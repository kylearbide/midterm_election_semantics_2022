HONORING THE LIFE OF NASSAU 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF’S 
DEPUTY 
JOSHUA MOYERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Nassau 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Deputy 
Joshua 
Moyers, who was tragically killed last 
weekend in the line of duty. 
On 
September 
26, 
2021, 
Deputy 
Moyers gave his last full measure of de-
votion to our northeast Florida com-
munity. He was only 29 years old. My 
heart breaks for his friends, fellow offi-
cers, and loved ones who already miss 
him dearly. 
Deputy Moyers graduated from Hill-
iard Middle-Senior High School, Flor-
ida State College, and St. Johns River 
State College before joining the Nassau 
County Sheriff’s Office in 2015. 
Madam Speaker, Joshua wasn’t just 
a good officer; he was a great officer. In 
fact, in 2018, Deputy Moyers received 
the ‘‘Above and Beyond the Call of 
Duty’’ award for his work on a very 
significant narcotics case. 
Having spent a career in law enforce-
ment, I have seen the names of far too 
many outstanding officers go up on our 
National Law Enforcement Memorial 
wall here in D.C. Deputy Moyers will 
be no exception. 
His death serves as a tragic reminder 
of the dangers facing law enforcement 
officers across the country every single 
day. We are so thankful for men and 
women like Officer Moyers, who volun-
teer to step into the breach in defense 
of our citizens, and we owe them a deep 
debt of gratitude. 
I am reminded of a quote from Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, which says: ‘‘The pur-
pose of life is not to be happy. It is to 
be useful, to be honorable, to be com-
passionate, to have it make some dif-
ference that you lived and lived well.’’ 
Officer Moyers’ life may have been 
cut short, but he lived with honor and 
compassion, and he made a real dif-
ference, a tangible difference, to so 
many lives on the First Coast. 
I am grateful to the Nassau County 
Sheriff’s Office for capturing the man 
responsible for his death, and I hope 
that justice will be swiftly served. 
May God bless the Moyers family, 
and may He give them the strength to 
persevere during this difficult time. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to now 
ask that this Chamber join me for a 
moment of silence in remembrance of 
Officer Moyers. 
TRIBUTE TO LIFE OF DR. DIANA 
NATALICIO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the life of 
Dr. Diana Natalicio, who will be re-
membered as an icon of higher edu-
cation and a trailblazer in El Paso. 
Dr. Natalicio served for 31 years as 
the president of the University of 
Texas at El Paso, my alma mater, 
UTEP, between 1988 and 2019. As the 
longest sitting president at UTEP, her 
imprint on the institution will be ever-
lasting. 
She devoted her life’s work to mak-
ing UTEP accessible and elevating it to 
a top-tier institution. As a first-gen-
eration college student herself, she 
knew the importance of working for an 
equitable college experience for first- 
generation and low-income college stu-
dents and access to higher education 
for all. In 2019, 51 percent of UTEP’s 
graduates were first generation. 
Dr. Natalicio taught us that no mat-
ter where you come from, everyone de-
serves a good education. She also un-
derstood the struggles that El Pasoans 
face and worked on finding solutions to 
those barriers. I am deeply grateful for 
Dr. Diana Natalicio’s service to our 
community and the vision she created 
for UTEP students. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me 
in honoring Dr. Diana Natalicio’s life 
and contributions to El Paso. 
May her legacy continue to inspire us 
all. 
f 
TIME TO CUT THROUGH THE 
NOISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because it is time to cut through 
the noise and recognize the oppor-
tunity at hand.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5556 
September 30, 2021 
Last month, the Senate passed the 
bipartisan Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act with the support of 19 Re-
publican Senators, including Minority 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL. Since then, 
I have heard the loudest voices in the 
room say a lot about this bill, except 
for calling it what it is, a once-in-a- 
generation investment in our Nation’s 
physical infrastructure. 
For myself and so many others, a bill 
like this is the reason we came to Con-
gress. 
We have heard from the mom or dad 
who hit a pothole and had to pay out of 
pocket to fix the family car. 
We have seen our children struggle 
and fall behind in school without reli-
able internet access. 
Our communities are the ones where 
basic access to clean drinking water 
has been jeopardized by aging pipes. 
Our workers and businesses are the 
ones calling for investments that will 
help them compete on the world stage. 
So, the question is: What will we, as 
Members of Congress, do about it? 
Will we allow blatant partisanship on 
both sides of the aisle to stand in the 
way of legislation that is objectively 
good for the American people? 
Will we ignore the very real crisis 
that is facing infrastructure systems in 
communities like the one I represent 
in central New York? 
Will we simply disregard the pleas 
from the most significant labor and 
business advocates in the country? 
I, for one, will not. I strongly support 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, and I urge the 
Speaker to bring the bill to the floor as 
a standalone vote today. 
This long-overdue legislation delivers 
comprehensive investment in our roads 
and bridges, ports and waterways, 
clean water systems, broadband net-
works, electrical grids, and airports. 
The bill takes essential steps to 
streamline Federal permitting proc-
esses and undertakes the crucial work 
of improving the resiliency of our hard 
infrastructure. 
Critically, this legislation includes 
responsible pay-fors in addition to its 
$550 billion in new spending for phys-
ical infrastructure. The CBO estimates 
that the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will have a 33 percent return 
on investment because of the economic 
benefits of long-term infrastructure 
projects. Experts from the American 
Enterprise Institute have argued that 
spending under this legislation would 
not contribute to inflation because the 
spending would be spread out over a 
decade and focus on improving long- 
term productivity. 
To be sure, no legislation is perfect, 
but this measure is the product of an 
honest, good faith, and bipartisan ef-
fort to reach consensus and deliver for 
our constituents. I know that because I 
have spent many years working with 
my colleagues in the Problem Solvers 
Caucus to reach this moment. 
Since 2017, our group has worked on a 
framework that would move the ball 
forward on infrastructure and present 
real policy solutions for the challenges 
we face. 
In presenting our work to a bipar-
tisan group of Governors, Senators, 
and Members of the House in Annap-
olis, Maryland, earlier this year, we 
helped lay the framework for the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill the House is 
now considering. 
I am grateful to all of my colleagues 
who worked on this, and I sincerely 
hope that this work will not have been 
done in vain. I hope that we can see 
through the cloud of misinformation 
and partisan efforts to hold this bill 
hostage. I hope my colleagues will look 
at this bill objectively, on its own mer-
its, and consider the benefits that it 
holds for the communities they rep-
resent. 
I would also remind my colleagues 
who are unsure of where they will fall 
this one simple thing: The world is 
watching. 
Our Nation’s adversaries, like the 
Chinese Communist Party, would like 
nothing more than to see this body 
yield to partisan interests and refuse 
to invest in its own people. These ad-
versaries would cheer our decision to 
ignore the crises of the past year and 
decide not to invest in cybersecurity 
for our infrastructure assets. They 
would be relieved if we continue a sta-
tus quo that erases our economy’s com-
petitive edge and allows malign actors 
to gain the upper hand. 
Simply put, with this bill, Congress 
is taking a critical step in deciding 
who will build the future. I will back a 
future built by American workers, en-
suring opportunities for American fam-
ilies and American businesses. 
I sincerely hope my colleagues will 
put down their swords just this once— 
just this once—and join me. 
f 
COVID INFECTION AND 
VACCINATION RATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, 
this morning, I wanted to share with 
the Chamber the latest statistics from 
the Centers for Disease Control and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services regarding infection rates and 
vaccination rates in the country. 
I am proud to say, the State of Con-
necticut, which the Speaker knows 
well, we ranked as the lowest infection 
rate in the country, 1.4 percent, 14 
cases per 100,000. 
Simultaneous with that report were 
the 
numbers 
regarding 
vaccination 
rates. For the population 18 and over, 
we are at an 80 percent vaccination 
rate, which, again, is the highest in the 
country. 
It is blindingly obvious there is a 
causal connection between commu-
nities that come together to boost vac-
cination rates and the benefit and the 
result of reducing infection rates. The 
benefit, in terms of our hospital system 
in the State of Connecticut, again, we 
have 9 per 100,000 COVID patients, 
which ranks number three in the coun-
try, right behind Vermont and the 
State of Massachusetts, which are 7 per 
100,000 and 8 per 100,000. 
What does that mean? It means there 
is no pressure on your ICU units. There 
is allowance for normal elective sur-
geries and the processes of hospitals to 
continue, which is the endgame of what 
we all should be focused on like a laser, 
which is to get beyond this pandemic. 
It didn’t happen by itself. 
Anecdotally, in my district, I was 
over at the Coast Guard Academy the 
other day: a 99 percent vaccination 
rate with the student body at the Coast 
Guard Academy. These are the future 
leaders of our coastal sea service, and 
they get it. They understand the bene-
fits, that they can attend class and 
have a normal campus life. 
Across the river, the submarine base 
in Groton, again, just shy of a 90 per-
cent vaccination rate. That is 10,000 
sailors and officers. These are people 
with families. These are folks who have 
pregnant spouses. But they get it. I 
mean, there is no way you can socially 
distance in a submarine. They are now 
the number one naval installation in 
America in terms of vaccination rates. 
Again, it did not happen by itself. 
Governor Lamont, back in the spring 
of 2020, basically tuned out all the 
noise. He brought together experts 
from the Yale School of Public Health. 
He brought together experts from the 
Hartford HealthCare hospital system, 
which is the largest hospital system. 
They brought together the community 
health centers. They brought together 
community groups. They stayed fo-
cused in terms of getting testing, 
masking, and vaccinations out there to 
the public at large. 
I would note, Madam Speaker, that 
when we passed the American Rescue 
Plan back in March, like every State, 
we were given an allocation to our pub-
lic health system for communication 
and education. Again, it has been put 
to good use, obviously, as these num-
bers show this morning. 
On Tuesday, the Biden administra-
tion announced the release of funding 
for community health centers, which 
have been the backbone in terms of 
reaching hard-to-get populations, to 
get the help that they need during this 
pandemic. In eastern Connecticut, the 
two 
community 
health 
systems— 
United Children and Family Services, 
and Generations—are getting close to 
$1 million for new equipment and new 
infrastructure to carry out their mis-
sion to make sure that we are going to 
beat this virus once and for all. 
All the issues that we talk about 
here—and they are all so important— 
right now, we still cannot be distracted 
from the need to get on the other side 
of this pandemic. These numbers from 
my State today show that when you 
work together, when you just combat 
all the misinformation and bad stuff

that is out there about vaccines and 
masking—we had a hearing in Hartford 
where we had people up there saying 
that the authorization from the FDA 
was only for the German vaccine, not 
the American Pfizer vaccine, which is 
ridiculous. That stuff is out there, but 
we have overcome that. 
Again, the numbers speak for them-
selves in terms of that success. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to make sure that we keep 
this priority number one, two, and 
three because that is how we recover 
our economy, and that is how we re-
cover a normal life in this country. So, 
let’s work together.

CONGRATULATING THE 
CHARLESTON RIVERDOGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Charleston 
RiverDogs on a defining victory in the 
Low-A East championship series this 
week. This 9–2 win is the City of 
Charleston’s first minor league base-
ball title in 99 years and the first in 
franchise history for the Charleston 
RiverDogs. 
The Charleston RiverDogs are a 
Lowcountry staple and are a vital part 
of our tourism and hospitality indus-
tries. 
This team worked extremely hard 
during their record-breaking season 
and showed great determination while 
representing our beloved Charleston. 
I am excited for the opportunity to 
go back-to-back, like Jordan in 1996 
and 1997. 
RECOGNIZING LAMBS FOR LIFE 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of Lambs for Life and its 
founders, Alex and Brandon Arrieta. 
On April 25, 2016, Alex Arrieta, age 10, 
was told his cancer was gone and a 
bone marrow transplant was scheduled 
for the next month. The very next day 
Alex passed away. 
In honor of Alex’s favorite childhood 
toy, Lamby, his parents founded Lambs 
for Life. Lambs for Life delivers Lamby 
Packs filled with toys and a stuffed 
lamb for Child Life departments of 
children’s hospitals, brightening the 
days of thousands of pediatric cancer 
patients. 
Lambs for Life, led by Alex’s dad, 
Brandon, has spent the last 5 years 
working with Congress and the White 
House to bring focus and solutions to 
pediatric cancer. 
I commend Brandon for working 
through his grief at the loss of two sons 
to make our country better. 
RECOGNIZING DEAN STEPHENS 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of Dean Stephens, a local 
news anchor, who is retiring after 31 
years with ABC News 4. 
Generations of Lowcountry families 
have welcomed Dean into their living 
rooms. I grew up with Dean, watching 
him in the Lowcountry. His first job 
with the station was as a weekend 
sportscaster, and he would eventually 
become a news anchor. 
Dean’s presence on our televisions 
will be greatly missed by our commu-
nity. I wish him well on his much-de-
served retirement. 
RECOGNIZING PORTER-GAUD SCHOOL STUDENTS 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the great work 
done by some amazing students at Por-
ter-Gaud School in Charleston. 
Last month, as part of the school’s 
Senior Day for Caring, 100 Porter-Gaud 
seniors packaged over 20,000 meals for 
the James Island Outreach Center and 
One80 Place, feeding the hungry across 
the Charleston area. They also pack-
aged over 350 hygiene kits to take care 
of our fleeing Afghan allies seeking ref-
uge right here in the United States. 
The leaders of these nonprofits tell 
me the tremendous work these stu-
dents did saved them thousands of dol-
lars in manufacturing costs, not to 
mention the good works that they are 
doing for our community. 
REMEMBERING LUCILLE WHIPPER 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of former South 
Carolina State Representative Lucille 
Whipper. 
Dr. Whipper was the first African- 
American woman elected to the South 
Carolina State House from Charleston 
County. She served her community as 
an activist during the civil rights 
movement. She was a teacher and a 
guidance counselor. She was also an 
administrator in Charleston County 
public schools. Dr. Whipper was also 
the first African-American adminis-
trator at the College of Charleston, 
where she developed the school’s diver-
sity program all the way back as early 
as the 1970s. 
Dr. Whipper will be greatly missed, 
but her influence will live on in our 
community. We thank her for her lead-
ership, and we offer our sincerest con-
dolences for her family during this 
time. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR THE INFRASTRUC-
TURE 
INVESTMENT 
AND 
JOBS 
ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
DAVIDS 
of 
Kansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. It 
would bring billions of dollars to much- 
needed infrastructure projects in my 
home State, from bridges to broadband, 
and it does so without raising taxes on 
people who make less than $400,000 a 
year. 
As I have said before, this bill is not 
absolutely perfect, but it is absolutely 
necessary. It is a product of com-
promise. That is, at the end of the day, 
what legislating often means. 
In the district I represent, this bill 
has received a remarkable amount of 
support, including everyone from labor 
unions to local chambers of commerce 
to climate groups. They are joined by 
national organizations like the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and 
hundreds of labor and trade associa-
tions. 
I urge my colleagues to listen to 
their communities who are calling for 
these investments and not to give in to 
the Washington machine that so often 
turns shared bipartisan goals into po-
litical games. 
This bill reminds me of the last time 
that we saw this level of investment in 
America’s infrastructure, when Presi-
dent Eisenhower, who was from Kan-
sas, recognized an opportunity to re-
build the economy and create jobs 
through infrastructure. We were then, 
as we are today, in a challenging time 
defined by a national crisis and eco-
nomic difficulty. 
I believe, as Eisenhower did, that in-
frastructure is key to building long- 
term economic growth. At the end of 
the day, infrastructure is made up of 
many everyday systems that connect 
us to one another and broaden opportu-
nities. 
If we don’t invest in the health of 
those systems, whether it is the safety 
of highways like U.S. 69 in the district 
I get to represent, or access to high- 
speed internet in areas across Kansas, 
both urban and rural, we pay the price, 
and it is not just in the ways we might 
think. 
We feel the impact of past decades of 
underinvestment in infrastructure, in 
our economy, in our educational sys-
tems, in the health of our kids, and in 
the health of our planet. 
That is why this bill is absolutely 
necessary 
because 
infrastructure 
touches so many parts of our lives and 
the lives of our future generations. 
This bipartisan bill boosts American 
competitiveness, 
tackles 
climate 
change, and advances equity now and 
into the future. It is projected to cre-
ate 2 million jobs per year for the next 
decade, with fair wage requirements 
written into the text. 
Independent studies have shown that 
the investments in this bill will have 
multiplier effects on the economy, im-
proving productivity and boosting eco-
nomic output without increasing infla-
tion. This infrastructure bill is large, 
but so is the problem. 
There are immediate infrastructure 
needs, from roads and bridges to public 
transit and rail, waterways, and air-
ports. All of these need attention. This 
bill will undoubtedly bring the Federal 
funding needed to address those issues 
here in the near term, and it makes 
significant 
progress 
toward 
longer- 
term goals, like replacing lead pipes so 
that every child can have access to 
clean drinking water or promoting Buy 
American provisions that create good- 
paying jobs for both construction and 
production of materials or modernizing 
our electric grid to prevent blackouts, 
like the ones we saw in Kansas and 
those we saw in Texas earlier this year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5558 
September 30, 2021 
For people sitting in traffic on U.S. 
69 or waiting for the bus in Wyandotte 
County or wondering why that one 
road floods every single year no matter 
how many times we fix it, this cannot 
wait. Not to mention, if we fail to act, 
critical surface transportation author-
izations are going to run out by Friday. 
I urge my colleagues to set aside 
gamesmanship and not see this as an 
opportunity for political points but in-
stead an opportunity to deliver for our 
communities, the opportunity that our 
communities have been asking for us 
to deliver on. 
f 
THE BIDEN ECONOMIC AND 
SPENDING CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. OWENS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to continue sounding the alarm 
on the Biden Administration’s eco-
nomic and spending crisis that is hurt-
ing families in my district and killing 
American jobs. 
This Big Government, ultra-infla-
tion, and massive spending agenda has 
a big problem: the economy. It is spik-
ing the price of groceries, gas, lumber, 
and everything in between. 
Gasoline is up 42.7 percent. Chicken 
is up 7.2 percent. Eggs are up 9.9 per-
cent. Public transportation is up 8.4 
percent. 
As I have heard from my families all 
across my district, Americans cannot 
afford this. 
Utahns say they are paying more for 
just about everything. In fact, a recent 
statewide poll found that 85 percent of 
Utahns are very or somewhat con-
cerned about inflation and rising costs. 
Inflation is a tax on every single 
American. 
With consumer prices reaching a 13- 
year high, it is clear this administra-
tion’s agenda is bad for economic re-
covery and unsustainable for working- 
class Americans trying to make ends 
meet. 
The 
Democrats’ 
solution? 
Rush 
through the most expensive piece of 
legislation in the history of our coun-
try. 
Another startling fact: This $3.5 tril-
lion spending plan is more than the 
GDP of Canada and Mexico combined. 
While the White House continues to 
spread false realities to the American 
people, let’s talk about the facts: The 
true cost of the bill is $5.5 trillion, not 
$3.5 trillion, and certainly not zero. It 
is going to increase the national debt 
by $2.4 trillion. It will lead to 5.3 mil-
lion jobs lost nationwide. The median 
family income will drop by $12,000. 
Each American household will be bur-
dened with $35,439 of debt. 
Americans across the country and 
Utahns in the Fourth District want to 
see fiscal responsibility restored at the 
Federal 
level. 
This 
out-of-control 
spending must stop. 
HONORING LIVES LOST TO 
SENSELESS VIOLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. BOWMAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor the lives of those lost due to 
senseless violence in my district: 
Leon Wayne, age 26, gun violence. 
Chevor Williams, age 28, gun vio-
lence. 
Cori Lowe, age 31, stabbing victim. 
Richard Black, age 39, gun violence. 
Joseph Ramirez, age 43, gun violence. 
Wray Harding, age 55, gun violence. 
Aliyah Waiters, gun violence. 
Marilyn Cotto Montanez, age 18, gun 
violence. 
Guy Vanlew, Jr., age 18, gun violence. 
Jeremy Logan, age 32, gun violence. 
Omari Ellis, age 18, gun violence. 
Warren Clahar, age 35, gun violence. 
Olivia Green, age 15, fentanyl over-
dose. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that we ob-
serve a moment of silence for the lives 
lost in my district due to senseless vio-
lence. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, the pandemic of 
senseless violence is not new. If you 
live in a poverty-stricken community 
and if you are Black or Latino in these 
communities, you are more susceptible 
to acts of senseless violence. 
When I was in high school, trying to 
just be a good student and play on the 
football team, I ended up caught up in 
a situation where I was almost shot 
and killed. A few months later, at a 
party with some friends, just trying to 
go out and have a good time, I ended up 
in a situation where I was almost shot 
and killed. 
If it weren’t for sheer luck, I would 
not be standing here as a Member of 
Congress today. 
Thankfully, at that time, I was able 
to move out of my community and 
move to a suburban community where 
it was much less likely for me to end 
up in a situation where I could be shot 
and killed. 
I have so many friends and family 
members who did not have the luxury 
of moving out and the privilege of mov-
ing out of their community. As a re-
sult, they ended up dead at some very 
young ages, some 18, some 21, some 
even younger. 
Oftentimes, when we have these con-
versations, we point to the perpetra-
tors of these acts of violence and of 
these crimes and we identify them as 
bad individuals and we say that we 
need law enforcement to respond to re-
move those bad individuals from these 
situations, and we think that that 
method is enough to end the violence 
in these communities. 
But we have invested in law enforce-
ment for decades; the 1994 crime bill 
being one example of how we have 
made such investments and targeted 
highly violent communities. But the 
violence hasn’t gone away, and the vio-
lence has only been exacerbated by the 
COVID–19 pandemic that has isolated 
many and has also created a mental 
health crisis. 
So I ask and I beg this Chamber to 
recognize that this is not just about in-
dividual bad actors in communities. 
Poverty is a policy choice, and the 
trauma related to poverty and the lack 
of opportunity in so many of our com-
munities will continue to lead to in-
creases in violence that we see in pov-
erty-stricken communities. 
b 1030 
We have to invest in education, 
healthcare, jobs, housing, mentorship, 
and so many other programs that could 
literally save the lives of our children 
before they ever decide to pick up a 
gun. 
Lastly, and very quickly, we passed 
H.R. 8, commonsense gun reform legis-
lation, in the House this year, and the 
Senate still has not acted on that legis-
lation. Seventy percent of the inci-
dents of gun violence that take place in 
New York are done with guns that 
come from outside of New York. So we 
have to move this gun legislation in 
the Senate.

BIDEN’S CRISES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
this week we learned that either Presi-
dent Biden ignored the advice of his 
top military advisers and lied to shift 
the blame for his disastrous Afghani-
stan withdrawal or that those advisers 
lied to Congress under oath. 
General McKenzie and Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff General 
Milley both informed the Senate and 
House 
Armed 
Services 
Committees 
that they recommended to President 
Biden that we keep 2,500 troops in Af-
ghanistan. Yet President Biden has 
adamantly claimed that he never re-
ceived such advice. 
Americans have been abandoned, left 
to the mercy of a terrorist regime that 
wants to destroy Western culture and 
institutionalize widespread and sys-
temic gender apartheid. 
Our military weapons and equipment 
have been turned over to our adver-
saries for their use against us. 
And our President continues to nego-
tiate with terrorists after our service-
men and -women have been murdered. 
Every last American must make it 
home. Anything less is inexcusable and 
a dereliction of his sworn oath. 
The President’s lack of leadership is 
not only failing us abroad, but it is 
also threatening our safety here at 
home. Just this year more than 1.3 mil-
lion people have illegally crossed our 
border, including known terrorists. 
An open southern border threatens 
our national security and the safety of 
all Americans, and I hope we can all 
agree that we must do something to 
stop this disturbing trend. 
The President has a duty to act. Our 
Federal Government must enforce our

Nation’s immigration laws, reimple-
ment 
successful 
policies 
from 
the 
Trump administration, and commit 
further support for our Border Patrol 
agents and our Customs enforcement 
officers. 
That is why I signed on to a resolu-
tion calling for the President to fully 
enforce our immigration laws in light 
of the current surge at the border and 
the ongoing self-created border crisis. 
Lastly, the President and his far-left 
Democrats are racking up debt that 
Americans cannot afford, exacerbating 
the current inflationary crisis that we 
are facing. 
The proposed $4.3 trillion tax-and- 
spending spree is a continuation of the 
Biden administration’s reckless poli-
cies that have created an unstable out-
look for our economy, for our Nation’s 
future, and for the next generation of 
Americans. 
Not only does this package unravel 
the progress we have made to encour-
age work and raise wages, but it in-
creases the national debt by up to $17 
trillion, putting our national security 
further at risk. 
The Speaker and the far left are wild-
ly spending tax dollars on their social-
ist priorities, while increasing taxes on 
small businesses, on family farms, and 
by raising the corporate tax to a rate 
higher than Canada, higher than Italy, 
higher than the U.K., and even higher 
than Communist China, which we know 
will directly hurt job growth and wage 
growth for men and women across our 
communities. 
Our economy is already running at 
the highest rate of inflation in 13 
years. 
To 
recklessly 
increase 
our 
spending is fiscally irresponsible and 
downright 
dangerous. 
As 
Senator 
MANCHIN even said, it is truly the defi-
nition of fiscal insanity. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear to me, 
just as I know it is clear to my con-
stituents, the President, time and time 
again, is failing to display the leader-
ship America needs and deserves. He 
must uphold the promises he made to 
the American people, and I call on him, 
I ask him to put an end to the era of 
crisis that we are now under. 
NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in celebration of National 
Hispanic Heritage Month and the his-
tories, cultures, and contributions of 
Latino 
and 
Hispanic 
Americans 
throughout the United States. 
Growing up in Sunnyside, Wash-
ington, I have witnessed firsthand how 
Hispanic Americans contribute to our 
communities 
through 
entrepreneur-
ship, military service, and cultural di-
versity. They are our friends, our fam-
ily, our neighbors, and our coworkers. 
They are small-business owners, doc-
tors, police officers, and soldiers. 
In central Washington and across the 
country, we are proud of our Hispanic 
friends and neighbors who prove that 
the American Dream is alive and well. 
Because of them, we are a stronger, 
more diverse, prosperous society. 
Today I ask my colleagues, join me 
in honoring our Hispanic-American 
neighbors and in recognizing National 
Hispanic Heritage Month. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
SMALL BUSINESSES IN COVID–19 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the small busi-
ness. I rise today in support of the 
hardworking man and woman who has 
bootstrapped an enterprise, a barber-
shop, a gym, a manufacturing firm 
that isn’t often represented by a large 
lobbying firm that is able to knock on 
the doors of the Halls of Congress and 
demand what they need. These people 
deserve to be heard. 
The pandemic resulted in the perma-
nent closure of roughly 200,000 U.S. es-
tablishments above historical levels 
during the first year alone. 
Individual companies, the small ones, 
account for about two-thirds or rough-
ly 130,000 of the extra closures. The 
gym across the street from my house, 
an independent enterprise run by a 
cancer survivor, closing today. The 
Milford House Bar & Grill, where peo-
ple celebrated anniversaries and grad-
uations, closed. 
We hear you. Your voice and what 
you do and the hard work that you rep-
resent matters in this body. 
A May 2021 Federal Reserve report 
found 35 percent of service-based busi-
nesses that closed during the pandemic 
were still closed. The report also esti-
mated that just 3 percent are likely to 
reopen. 
What does this mean? Poor neighbor-
hoods getting poorer. Less jobs. Open 
storefronts. A blight toward economic 
development. 
Absolutely this body acted when we 
needed to: PPP, $800 billion; $14 billion 
in grants and forgivable loans at the 
local level. In Michigan we acted 
quickly. We have seen tough times. 
Our manufacturers, the small ones, 
were the first to put up their hands: 
How can I source the protective per-
sonal equipment? I have got it in my 
back pocket. I am ready to act. 
And yet we are getting whacked by a 
chip crisis. We don’t have what we need 
to meet the demand, and people are 
suffering as a result. It is not just the 
billions of dollars, a loss of profit at 
the top. It is the jobs. It is the single 
moms who want to get back to work. 
And yet they are at $15 an hour, and no 
one is watching their kid for under $16. 
Here in this Congress, we have been 
working to reorganize the tapestry of 
this country so people can succeed, in-
dividual hardworking Americans can 
succeed. 
They are not following every line of 
our debate, but they are counting on 
us. Invest in daycare, give us paid fam-
ily leave, support the small business. 
That is what this week is all about, 
Madam Speaker. That is what compels 
me to come to work every single day, 
and we are not going to stop until the 
job is done. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FAILING 
TO LEAD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss the President’s 
complete and utter failure to lead our 
country effectively over the last 9 
months. 
Despite the optimistic vision he por-
trayed in his inaugural address, Presi-
dent Biden has created crisis after cri-
sis—from our economy and energy 
independence to national and border 
security. 
Back in February my Republican col-
leagues and I warned Democrats’ reck-
less spending would have a devastating 
inflationary effect. In fact, many ex-
perts at the time, including former 
President 
Obama’s 
top 
economist, 
warned spending trillions more would 
devalue our dollar and cause prices of 
goods and services to increase. 
Sure enough, just one month later, 
we learned that the Consumer Price 
Index had its highest monthly jump in 
nearly 10 years. The Producer Price 
Index has also skyrocketed by 8.3 per-
cent, which is also a record. 
While the Biden administration con-
tinues turning a blind eye to inflation, 
top economists are warning inflation is 
here to stay for years to come, and it 
will only get worse if the Democrats 
pass over $5 trillion in additional 
spending. 
This is a hidden tax hike on every 
American family, on top of their his-
toric tax increases that are part of the 
$4.2 
trillion 
tax-and-spending 
spree 
that we will be discussing over the next 
several days. This is completely reck-
less for our businesses, our farmers, 
and our families. 
Instead of reining in spending, Presi-
dent Biden and his Democrat col-
leagues are leaning into the economic 
crisis they have created. In fact, the 
President has attempted to gaslight 
the American people by making the 
false claim that their $5.5 trillion so- 
called infrastructure package will cost 
zero dollars. Even the leftists at The 
Washington Post aren’t buying it, call-
ing the claim truly misleading. 
The crisis at our southern border, 
which the Biden administration has 
gone to great lengths to ignore, has 
continued raging on. 
In May I went to Texas with Con-
gressman GONZALES to see the border 
firsthand. I received an aerial tour of 
the Big Bend sector, a remote part of 
the border where apprehensions of 
drugs, weapons, and other contraband 
are at record levels. 
Law enforcement on the ground told 
us directly that they needed more sup-
port from the administration. Sadly,

September 30, 2021 
several months later, it is still clear 
that no help has been on the way. 
In August, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection announced that they have 
made over 200,000 apprehensions of 
drugs, up 317 percent from just a year 
ago. 
Biden’s failure to lead and take con-
trol of this situation has created a de-
volving humanitarian crisis, a national 
security crisis, and a public health cri-
sis at our southern border. 
Biden has also failed to lead on our 
world stage. Our tragic and disastrous 
withdrawal from Afghanistan is the 
sole responsibility of President Biden 
and his colossal failure to lead as Com-
mander in Chief. 
The administration still owes the 
American people answers. Why were 
billions of dollars of military equip-
ment left behind for the Taliban? Why 
did we cave to the Taliban’s timeline? 
Why did we fail to evacuate every sin-
gle American before leaving? 
Just this week we learned Biden lied 
to the American people regarding the 
advice he received from his top mili-
tary generals. The commander of the 
U.S. Central Command testified under 
oath that he recommended keeping a 
small force of 2,500 troops in Afghani-
stan, yet Biden previously told the 
American people that no one rec-
ommended keeping this limited troop 
presence. 
Biden has been silent as the far left 
wing of his party has attacked Israel 
and their right to defend themselves. 
Abandoning our allies, abandoning and 
lying to the American people, this 
seems to be the Biden leadership doc-
trine. 
Under the President’s leadership, we 
are no longer energy independent. On 
his first day of office, Biden killed the 
XL pipeline, eliminating 11,000 great 
jobs. He put Paris over Paullina, Iowa, 
and other communities in my district 
by rejoining the climate accords, which 
will cause electricity to skyrocket. 
Yet this same woke progressive ad-
ministration that pretends to care so 
much about the climate is about to 
give a huge win to the oil industry. 
They are undermining clean-burning 
biofuels by attacking the renewable 
fuel standard, leaving crop growers and 
my biofuels producers behind in the 
dust. 
It seems the Biden leadership doc-
trine in a nutshell has been to ruin this 
economy and is undermining our inde-
pendence. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded again to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the 
President.

b 1045 
AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR 
ALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Chair, 
from the very first day I was sworn 
into Congress in January of 2019, I have 
been on a mission to expand access to 
high-quality, affordable healthcare for 
people in my northern Illinois district 
and Americans across the country. 
It is actually a mission that started 
long before I came to Congress. In fact, 
it started when I was in elementary 
school. That is when I was first diag-
nosed with a heart condition that I 
have lived with ever since. Because of 
that preexisting condition, I spent 
most of my life at risk of losing 
healthcare coverage. 
That all changed when the House 
passed the Affordable Care Act and it 
was signed into law in 2010, protecting 
people like me with preexisting condi-
tions and eventually extending cov-
erage to more than 20 million Ameri-
cans, many for the first time in their 
adult lives. 
These historic gains have always 
hung in the balance, subject to more 
than 50 attempts from Republicans to 
repeal the law over the past decade. 
But the ACA didn’t just survive; it is 
now stronger than ever before, thanks 
to the 2-year version of my Health Care 
Affordability Act that was included in 
the American Rescue Plan. 
Thanks to the advanced premium tax 
credit expansion that I championed, 
marketplace enrollees are seeing sav-
ings of more than $40 per person per 
month, a 40 percent reduction in their 
monthly spending on healthcare. That 
means 
more 
money 
for 
groceries, 
school supplies, and essentials that 
families depend on. 
Medium plan deductibles for new en-
rollees have dropped by nearly 90 per-
cent, from $450 to $50. 
Half of eligible uninsured Hispanic 
adults and 45 percent of eligible unin-
sured Black adults are now able to find 
a zero-premium plan. 
In just 6 months since the American 
Rescue Plan was signed into law by 
President Biden, we have cut our Na-
tion’s uninsured rate, provided sub-
stantial savings for individuals and 
families, and taken the most signifi-
cant step toward health equity since 
the Affordable Care Act was signed 
into law. 
But if we fail to act now and make 
the American Rescue Plan’s advanced 
premium tax credit plan permanent, 
all of this progress will be wiped out in 
just 2 years. Americans will lose the 
coverage they are now protected by or 
once again face premiums that render 
coverage unaffordable and lead them to 
forgo insurance altogether. The gains 
that we have made in closing coverage 
gaps in communities of color will be re-
versed. The millions of people who 
might now have health insurance for 
the first time in their adult lives will 
once again lay awake at night won-
dering if they are one illness away 
from bankruptcy. 
We cannot afford to backtrack on the 
historic progress we have made for the 
American people. This is our moment 
to stand on the right side of history 
and finish the job to reach universal 
coverage that was started by the 
Obama-Biden 
administration 
more 
than a decade ago. 
We must make the advanced pre-
mium tax credit from the American 
Rescue Plan permanent and close the 
Medicaid coverage gap in the Build 
Back Better Act. 
We have a once-in-a-generation op-
portunity 
to 
make 
high-quality 
healthcare affordable and accessible to 
all. The American people are counting 
on us to get this done, and we must de-
liver. 
f 
DAYS OF BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS 
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today with 
great disappointment as we await a 
vote on a secretive budget reconcili-
ation package. 
I am incredibly proud to serve as the 
Republican leader of the House Agri-
culture Committee, and it is an honor 
to work on behalf of the farmers, 
ranchers, 
and 
foresters 
who 
feed, 
clothe, and power our Nation. I am 
equally proud of the bipartisan work 
the House Committee on Agriculture 
has done on behalf of rural America. 
Sadly, though, since the start of the 
117th Congress, it seems the days of bi-
partisan, commonsense solutions are 
now few and far between. The most re-
cent reconciliation process for the Ag-
riculture Committee is especially con-
cerning, if not utterly bizarre. 
On Friday, September 10, my Repub-
lican colleagues and I participated in a 
9.5-hour markup only for the com-
mittee Democrats to recess until the 
following Monday to gain the votes 
they needed to ram through an incom-
plete and unvetted budget reconcili-
ation package to the tune of $66 billion. 
Noticeably missing from the package 
was a whopping $28 billion—$6 billion 
more than the committee’s instruc-
tion—in additional spending, left out 
due to the Democrats’ ongoing prob-
lems with the Congressional Budget Of-
fice and the Byrd rule in the Senate. 
During the markup, both Republican 
and Democrat members asked repeat-
edly when the committee would know 
more about the missing funds and 
whether the committee would be able 
to engage, review, and mark up the 
provisions. The committee’s majority 
indicated the $28 billion would be added 
at a later stage. 
This was a stunning admission and a 
departure from regular order for the 
House Agriculture Committee. This 
amount of money would traditionally 
demand dozens of public hearings, tes-
timony from stakeholders, and rounds 
of technical assistance from USDA, all 
conducted by the committee of juris-
diction. 
Unfortunately, that was not the case 
for this bill, a package that rivals

many titles of a 5-year farm bill in size 
and scope, I might add. 
Now, I wish I could say I was sur-
prised, but given how Republicans have 
been so brazenly ignored throughout 
the first reconciliation and this newest 
sham reconciliation, this dereliction of 
process has, sadly, become par for the 
course. 
As for the $28 billion of missing mys-
tery funds, members of our committee 
remain in the dark. Initial summaries 
leaked to the press by the stakeholder 
groups and Senate Democrats told one 
story. A draft leaked this week told a 
very different one, including what ap-
pears to be $34 billion beyond the 
Democrats’ own instruction. 
This past weekend, the Budget Com-
mittee spent time moving the total 
package forward, and now it looks as 
though the Democratic chairman of 
the Rules Committee gets to decide the 
fate of the Agriculture package. 
This is absurd. 
This sham of a process is an insult to 
the 201 years of the House Agriculture 
Committee’s bipartisanship. I refuse to 
stand idly by as this committee is driv-
en into the ground by a partisan proc-
ess that leaves rural America behind. 
Enough is enough, Madam Speaker. 
Congress is a circus, and Democrats in 
leadership are the ringleaders. 
This process is an absolute farce, and 
it has only further devolved into chaos 
as the press, lobbyists, and the Demo-
cratic leadership aides know more 
about the policy than committees of 
jurisdiction. Leaked documents and se-
cretive briefings should not be the way 
Washington does business. 
Process aside, this is simply a bad 
bill, and it does next to nothing for 
rural America. It is shameful that in 
the nearly $100 billion of excess spend-
ing that claims to be for agriculture, 
there isn’t one penny for the com-
modity safety net, crop insurance, 
broadband, or disaster assistance. 
Madam Speaker, I could go on and on 
about how this bill fails rural America. 
Five minutes simply is not enough 
time. So, I will close with this: Demo-
crats can either force this sham of a 
bill through and pat themselves on the 
back for explosive spending and lack of 
transparency, or we can start over and 
work together to put real solutions on 
the table for rural America. 
f 
SUPPORTING OVERLOOKED 
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as I do every day in strong 
support of the millions of undocu-
mented immigrants whose contribu-
tions to our communities cannot con-
tinue to be overlooked. 
We have a once-in-a-lifetime oppor-
tunity to provide sound immigration 
reform through reconciliation, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in 
prioritizing this timely and long-over-
due effort. We must find the collective 
will in this House, in the Senate, and 
in the White House to finally resolve 
this pending issue. 
The American Dream is for all of us, 
Madam Speaker. It is for TPS recipi-
ents. It is for Dreamers. It is for farm-
workers and essential workers who put 
their lives on the line during the pan-
demic. 
How can we build back better with-
out providing real reform for our un-
documented immigrants? Or are we to 
abandon a nation of immigrants? That 
is the question. 
Let me be very clear, Madam Speak-
er: Including immigration reform in 
budget reconciliation is not without 
any precedent. While the Senate Par-
liamentarian’s decisions have not gone 
our way, we must forge ahead and con-
tinue to bring solutions to this commu-
nity. 
If not now, then when? How many 
times will we be able to tell vital mem-
bers of our communities to wait in line 
to be treated fairly and equally in our 
country? 
These are our neighbors, Madam 
Speaker. These are folks who helped us 
through the pandemic. These are the 
food delivery people who came to our 
homes while we shivered in fear during 
the pandemic. These are the over 
400,000 farmworkers who picked the 
fruits and the vegetables that we put 
on our table during the pandemic. 
These are the home care workers that 
took care of our very frail seniors, that 
scrubbed themselves clean before they 
went to work, and when they went 
back home, had to do the same not to 
infect their children. 
They are heroes. These are American 
heroes who kept us alive during the 
pandemic. 
This is a once-in-a-generation oppor-
tunity to pass much-needed legislation 
that reforms our broken immigration 
system. More than two-thirds of all un-
documented immigrants work in front-
line jobs and are essential workers in 
industries such as healthcare, home 
care, transportation, agriculture, food 
production, and construction, among 
others. 
Including sound immigration reform 
would advance our economic recovery 
from the pandemic, reduce our national 
deficit, raise wages, add a cumulative 
$1.5 trillion to the GDP over a decade, 
and create more than 400,000 new jobs. 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS have repeatedly demonstrated 
their commitment to pass immigration 
reform and have expressed strong sup-
port for including immigration reform 
in our budget reconciliation process. It 
is also broadly supported by the Amer-
ican people. 
Congress has not passed substantial 
immigration reform in more than 35 
years, Madam Speaker. Due to the Sen-
ate filibuster, a cynical remnant of Jim 
Crow, budget reconciliation provides 
the only glimmer of hope that will turn 
this into a reality. 
It is an unfortunate truth that the 
other side of the aisle has rejected 
every proposal, Madam Speaker, every 
single proposal, and obstructed every 
single piece of immigration reform leg-
islation that we have put forward. The 
filibuster has once again blocked our 
progress every step of the way. 
For decades, we have failed to sign 
into law permanent legislative solu-
tions to this problem. Budget reconcili-
ation is the only tool we now have 
available. 
Millions of immigrants in our coun-
try have lived their lives in fear and 
uncertainty for far too long. They are 
counting on us to get this done, and I 
am committed to making it happen. I 
will always stand behind asylum seek-
ers, refugees, and families who come to 
this country to make a better life for 
themselves, just as I once did. That is 
the promise of America, Madam Speak-
er.

HONORING DAVID J. RYDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nevada (Mr. AMODEI) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. AMODEI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service of U.S. Mint 
Director David J. Ryder as he prepares 
to depart the Mint. 
As a Boise State Broncos alum, Di-
rector Ryder has served with distinc-
tion in both the government and cor-
porate worlds. 
In 1991, President George H.W. Bush 
nominated him to serve as the 34th Di-
rector of the U.S. Mint. He served until 
1993. In 2017, he was nominated by 
President Trump for a second tenure as 
Mint director. 
Madam Speaker, that was something 
the Bushes and the Trumps agreed 
upon. 
Under Director Ryder’s leadership, 
the Mint has introduced more new 
products than ever before. The Mint’s 
bullion 
and 
numismatic 
programs 
reached their highest levels of revenue 
in over 10 years. The Mint’s customer 
base grew to more than a half a million 
people—530,000, an increase of over 
100,000 in 2 short years. 
I was particularly impressed by Di-
rector Ryder’s leadership when we 
worked together on the 2021 Morgan 
and Peace Commemorative Silver Dol-
lars program, which produced 875,000 
Morgan silver dollars and 200,000 Peace 
silver dollars, all under the 2021 date. 
Carson 
City 
and 
New 
Orleans 
mintmarks were resurrected for the 
first time in years, even though those 
Mints had been closed by using them in 
a privy mark. Collectors went nuts, 
and rightfully so. The program netted 
over $30 million for the U.S. Treasury 
and profits from this program when 
they all sold out in less than 20 min-
utes.

As he moves on to greener pastures, I 
wish Director Ryder success in all fu-
ture endeavors he takes on. I thank Di-
rector Ryder for his all-American per-
formance as the 39th Director of the 
United States Mint. 
Madam Speaker, although it pains 
me to do this as a proud University of

Director 
Ryder, thank you for your service 
again, and go Boise State Broncos.

PENTAGON’S 
POLICIES 
FOR 
RE-
PORTING VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, let 
me start with a few facts. 
One: The Leahy Law prohibits the 
United States from giving military as-
sistance to foreign security forces that 
commit gross violations of human 
rights. 
Two: The State Department deter-
mines whether there have been gross 
violations of human rights based in 
part on information from the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
Three: That process is only as good 
as the information coming in. Without 
that information, we don’t cut off fund-
ing, and taxpayer dollars can go to for-
eign military units that commit rape, 
murder, torture, and other gross viola-
tions of human rights. 
When our servicemembers have infor-
mation on such abuses, they have an 
obligation to report it to their chain of 
command, but that is not technically 
true for Defense Department contrac-
tors. That is a problem. In fact, that is 
a big problem because contractors are 
a huge part of our military presence 
around the world. They make up more 
than half of DOD personnel in Iraq. 
At the end of the war in Afghanistan, 
they outnumbered U.S. troops 17 to 1. 
And there have been repeated allega-
tions of contractors who failed to re-
port gross violations of human rights, 
from sexual abuse of young boys in Af-
ghanistan to the torture of prisoners in 
Yemen. 
In December 2019, Congress required 
the Pentagon to update the relevant 
policies and regulations. Section 888 of 
that year’s Defense bill required spe-
cific guidance to Defense contractors 
on reporting gross violations of human 
rights. 
Section 888 said to the Pentagon very 
simply: Put this duty to report human 
rights violations in your contracts. In-
clude rules about reporting gross viola-
tions of human rights and put them 
right next to the rules for accounting, 
for purchasing equipment, and for sub-
contracting. 
How has this been working? Not at 
all. 
And why is that? 
It is because the Department of De-
fense has apparently decided it is bet-
ter to see no evil and hear no evil when 
Defense contractors witness gross vio-
lations of human rights. 
The requirements in section 888 are 
currently 469 days overdue. 
Madam Speaker, 204 days ago, my 
colleagues wrote to the Pentagon ask-
ing for an update; 97 days ago, the Pen-
tagon sent a response that is best de-
scribed with language that is prohib-
ited on the House floor. 
The Pentagon’s response provided no 
updates on time, no procedures for re-
porting gross violations of human 
rights, and provided none of the other 
information required under the law 
that Congress passed. This is com-
pletely unacceptable, and what it sug-
gests is that neither human rights nor 
Congressional oversight are priorities 
for the Department of Defense. 
I urge Secretary Austin and General 
Milley to find out what is going on 
with section 888 of the fiscal year 2020 
NDAA and fix whatever problems with-
in their departments have led to this 
unacceptable delay. 
This week, Secretary Austin and 
General Milley testified under oath 
that we are going to learn the lessons 
of the war in Afghanistan. The need for 
strong, clear procedures for contrac-
tors to report gross violations of 
human rights is one of those lessons. It 
should be an easy one to learn. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Ms. PORTER: The right to vote is 
fundamental. Any threat to any Amer-
ican at the ballot box is a threat to 
every American’s right to representa-
tive government. 
It is the duty of the Federal Govern-
ment to protect our Nation’s democ-
racy. We need to expand opportunities 
to vote, especially for young people, 
people of color, workers with atypical 
hours, and people with disabilities. We 
need to crack down on gerrymandering 
so that voters choose their leaders in-
stead of leaders choosing their voters. 
We need to modernize voter registra-
tion, reform our broken campaign fi-
nance system, and prevent election 
subversion. 
This is not a partisan issue. Every 
American, regardless of who they vote 
for or whether they even vote, deserves 
a government that works for them. 
And that cannot happen when the bed-
rock of our democracy, the right to 
vote, is undermined. 
In the House, I proudly voted for H.R. 
1, the For the People Act, and H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advance 
Act to safeguard our democracy. But 
until the President signs democracy 
protection into law, the work is not 
done. I will keep fighting for our de-
mocracy. 
f 
IN RECOGNITION OF DEBORAH 
HANSEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Ms. Deborah Hansen for 
her service to the people of Florida’s 
Sixth Congressional District over the 
last 3 years in my office. 
Deborah was born in Salem, Oregon, 
to her parents, Bill and Fae Hansen. 
After graduating high school, Ms. Han-
sen left Salem to attend the University 
of Utah where she received her bach-
elor’s degree in science and sociology 
with an emphasis in criminology, so-
cial work, and child welfare. 
Upon graduating from the University 
of Utah, Ms. Hansen began her stead-
fast and inspiring career of public serv-
ice. Deborah devoted over 30 years of 
work to the juvenile justice programs 
in Oregon and Utah. During this time, 
she 
also 
taught 
criminal 
justice 
courses as an adjunct professor for 
local community colleges. 
While attaining all of her accom-
plishments, Deborah is most proud of 
raising her four beautiful children— 
Dustin, Dalton, Dain, and Danelle. 
Prior to coming to my office, Ms. 
Hansen served with Representatives 
Cresent Hardy from Nevada and Rep-
resentative Jason Lewis from Min-
nesota. In 2019, I was fortunate enough 
to have Deborah join my team as my 
office manager. 
She quickly proved herself to be an 
invaluable asset, overseeing multiple 
meetings, the many requests we re-
ceived, managing the daily operations 
of my Washington, D.C., office, and 
most importantly, keeping a freshman 
Member of Congress on track—no easy 
task, for sure. 
Not only did she keep all of us in 
line, but Deborah also brought a great 
spirit to our office. She always brought 
in baked goods to share, had a new 
story to tell—whether it be a memory 
of her time on the West Coast, the lat-
est adventures of her grandchildren, or 
about some mischief her new puppy, 
Tucker, had managed to get himself 
into—we were all ears. 
Deborah is diligent; she is talented, 
hardworking, but above all, she is kind. 
And while I am sad to see her leave, I 
can say without a doubt, she has made 
both our office and our country a bet-
ter place. 
We wish Deborah a happy and hope-
fully, very relaxing retirement in the 
country filled with quality time with 
her four children, 13 grandchildren, and 
her favorite puppy, Tucker. However, I 
know this is not the end of Deborah’s 
public service but the start of a new 
adventure in service to her community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
and the United States House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in commending 
Ms. Deborah Hansen for her lifelong ca-
reer of servant leadership. From the 
bottom of our hearts, we wish Deborah 
the best as she embarks on this next 
chapter in her life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5563 
September 30, 2021 
Build Back Better plan embodied the 
vision of the American people and is 
the kind of legislation that assures our 
people, hardworking Americans across 
the country, that we will not abandon 
them in their time of need. 
Now, I love history. And tomorrow is 
a very special day in the Virgin Is-
lands. It is Contract Day. I can’t help 
but make the connection between the 
landmark provisions outlined in Build 
Back 
Better, 
this 
transformational 
piece of legislation, and what is hap-
pening in our Halls of Congress as we 
come to the point of passing that, with 
the struggle that took place in my 
home on St. Croix on October 1, 1878. 
Then known as the Danish West Indies, 
on that day in history, almost 150 years 
ago, four brave, stalwart women led 
the St. Croix Labor Rebellion, also 
known to us in the Virgin Islands as 
‘‘Fireburn.’’ We honor the memory and 
sacrifices made by our ancestors on 
this day, which we call Contract Day. 
Now, after slaves in the Danish West 
Indies organized, fought, and took 
their freedom from chattel slavery in 
1848, a new type of slavery was formed 
in a labor bill the following year to 
regulate the now free workers. The law 
stipulated a day wage and restricted 
and confined workers to remain on one 
plantation for the entire year. That lo-
cation could only change on Contract 
Day, October 1. 
Former slaves worked on the same 
plantation as before with little to no 
improvements in their living condi-
tions, healthcare, no childcare, edu-
cation, no change in income. These new 
restrictions forced the workers to bear 
an impossible, untenable burden. They 
soon realized that they were free in 
name alone. 
The untenable working and living 
conditions along with the false hope 
that labor laws may change and then 
finding out that they were not going to 
change, ignited a protest that led to a 
rebellion in Fredriksted on the island 
of St. Croix. That movement was 
bravely led by four women who we im-
mortalize in our history as the queens: 
Queen Mary Thomas, Queen Mathilde 
Macbean, 
Queen 
Susanna 
‘‘Bottom 
Belly’’ Abrahamson, and Queen Axeline 
‘‘Queen Agnes’’ Salomon, demanding 
all plantations improve workers’ wages 
and repeal the Labor Act of 1849. 
Many of the protestors were killed; 
hanged. The women were tied to a 
stake, covered in molasses, and burned, 
irony being that the same cane that 
they cut, made into sugar and molas-
ses, would be the instrument of their 
cruel death. 
The fight for appropriate pay, job 
creation, equity and improvement in 
working conditions, living wages, sani-
tary housing, clean drinking water, es-
pecially for those in need, continues 
today in America. And we are attempt-
ing to solve those with the provisions 
in President Biden’s Build Back Better 
plan. 
All people, they simply want support, 
a foundation for them to have a rep-
utable shot at the American Dream. 
Women want meaningful jobs and the 
ability to leave their children in sani-
tary, clean, safe, affordable childcare; 
the ability to buy a home so that you 
can obtain equity for your children’s 
college; to start a business. 
When I think of my ancestors and 
how bravely they fought—some to 
their death—for the causes of equity 
and improved labor conditions, I am 
encouraged to continue advocating, 
championing, fighting for the changes 
that I believe the Build Back Better 
plan will bring us closer to, bring our 
Nation and those within it to those 
dreams that we all have. 
I pray this same encouragement and 
spirit of boldness and perseverance for 
all of my colleagues who are standing 
with us in that fight.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF OF POLICE 
DAVID STEFFEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate a dedicated 
law enforcement officer from Penn-
sylvania’s 11th Congressional District. 
Northern Lancaster County Regional 
Chief of Police David Steffen was re-
cently selected to serve as the presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania Chiefs of Po-
lice Association, which represents over 
1,200 commanding level officers across 
local, State, and Federal law enforce-
ment entities in Pennsylvania. 
Chief Steffen has spent his 40-plus- 
year career in law enforcement, having 
served in Jackson Township, Hampden 
Township, and then the Northern York 
County Regional Police Department, 
before being named the first chief of 
Northern Lancaster County Regional 
Police Department in 2011. 
As chief of the department, Steffen 
leads over 30 full-time sworn officers 
and three civil staff, covering approxi-
mately 100 square miles in north cen-
tral Lancaster County. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Chief Steffen for supporting his 
fellow law enforcement officers, for 
achieving this recognition, and con-
gratulate him on his new and well-de-
served role. 
To Chief Steffen and law enforcement 
officers across Pennsylvania’s 11th Dis-
trict and across the country, thank you 
for your dedicated service and your ef-
forts to keep our community safe. 
HONORING ELIZABETHTOWN MAYOR CHUCK 
MUMMERT 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my congratulations 
to Mayor Chuck Mummert of Eliza-
bethtown Borough in Lancaster Coun-
ty. 
Mayor Mummert was recently named 
Mayor of the Year by the Associations 
of Mayors of Boroughs of Pennsyl-
vania. Mayor Mummert has served the 
residents of Elizabethtown since 2006, 
in his first 4 years as a member of bor-
ough council there, and then since 2010 
as mayor. 
In addition to this honor, Mayor 
Mummert, in 2018, received the Gov-
ernor’s Award for Local Government 
Excellence, and he previously served as 
president of the Pennsylvania State 
Association of Boroughs. 
Mayor Mummert is known as the 
singing mayor, as he is frequently 
called upon to lend his talented voice 
in singing the national anthem at 
events; something that I have certainly 
always enjoyed. 
So I want to congratulate Mayor 
Mummert on being named Mayor of the 
Year, and to thank him for all of his 
work in continuing to make Elizabeth-
town Borough an exceptional place to 
live, work, and raise a family.

HONORING FATHER EMIL JOSEPH 
KAPAUN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. ESTES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to honor one of the finest 
men to ever come from the State of 
Kansas, Father Emil Joseph Kapaun, 
or Kapaun, as he is frequently referred 
to in Kansas. 
Father Kapaun, or Kapaun, who grew 
up on a farm in Kansas, was ordained 
as a priest for the Wichita Diocese on 
June 9, 1940. He went on to become a 
U.S. Army Chaplain during World War 
II and the Korean war with the rank of 
captain. 
Father Kapaun died in a North Ko-
rean prison camp on May 23, 1951, at 
the age of 35. In 35 short years, Father 
Kapaun sacrificed more and saved more 
lives and souls than many could ever 
hope to do in 100 years. 
Many around the world rightly cele-
brate the story of Father Kapaun, who 
is being considered for sainthood by 
the Catholic Church; a first for a na-
tive Kansan. 
His Medal of Honor citation gives a 
small glimpse at the deep reservoir of 
Father Kapaun’s bravery and honor. It 
reads: 
Chaplain Kapaun calmly walked through 
withering enemy fire in order to provide 
comfort and medical aid to his comrades and 
rescue the wounded from no-man’s-land. 
After the battle, when given the op-
tion to escape to safety with his unit, 
Father Kapaun volunteered to stay be-
hind to care and minister to the 
wounded. He was subsequently cap-
tured by the Communists and taken to 
a prison camp where he was forced to 
march more than 60 miles in harsh 
weather. 
While in captivity, his frank, down- 
to-earth Kansas manner, along with 
the unassuming farm style and dry wit, 
made him the servant leader for all the 
POWs held by the Communists. Al-
though greatly suffering himself, he al-
ways put his needs second to others. 
His strength and optimism allowed his

fellow GIs to once again believe that 
they would one day return to freedom 
in America. 
We know that Father Kapaun suf-
fered unthinkable cruelty at the hands 
of his prison guards who had a special 
hatred for Christians. But as the many 
stories attest, their rage and violence 
did not deter Father Kapaun in the 
slightest. 
One of his fellow prisoners wrote a 
letter upon returning from Korea, say-
ing that, ‘‘with his scraggly beard and 
his odd-looking woolen cap made of the 
sleeve of an old GI sweater, pulled 
down over his ears, he looked like any 
other half-starved prisoner. 
‘‘But there was something in his 
voice and bearing that was different—a 
dignity, a composure, a serenity that 
radiated from him like a light. Wher-
ever he stood was holy ground, and the 
spirit within him a spirit of reverence 
and abiding faith went out to the si-
lent, listening men and gave them hope 
and courage and a sense of peace. By 
his very presence, somehow, he could 
turn a stinking, louse-ridden mud hut, 
for a little while, into a cathedral.’’ 
Another passage from that letter 
reads that, as Father Kapaun spoke, 
‘‘the agony in the garden, the road to 
Calvary, the Crucifixion, became very 
real to us, who ourselves lived daily 
under the threat of death, and who bore 
our own crosses of blows, and cold, and 
illness, and starvation. But Christ en-
dured, he told us, and we, too, must en-
dure, for the day of resurrection from 
the tomb of the prison camp would 
surely come.’’ 
For generations, Father Kapaun has 
inspired hundreds around the world to 
greater faith and service through ad-
versity. Today, I am proud that Father 
Kapaun has returned home to his na-
tive Kansas. He is truly an American 
hero of the first class. 
f 
DEMOCRATS’ WASTEFUL 
SPENDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JACOBS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I urge the Democratic leader-
ship to heed the message of Senator 
JOE
MANCHIN
and take a strategic 
pause on the $4.3 trillion reconciliation 
bill they are attempting to pass. To 
spend this amount of money on top of 
the nearly $6 trillion we have spent on 
COVID since last March is reckless to 
say the least. We should not forget the 
long-term debt crisis we are facing. 
The graph beside me shows how dire 
this fiscal outlook is. By 2051, as is 
shown in this chart, the Congressional 
Budget Office projects our debt will 
reach 202 percent of the GDP. In other 
words, more than twice our annual out-
put. And that does not include the $4.3 
trillion the Democrats are proposing to 
spend in this reconciliation package. 
This will far exceed the debt levels 
even after World War II. As you can see 
in the graph, at the end of World War 
II our debt fell sharply and continued 
falling for several decades. 
Madam Speaker, this body needs to 
come together now, just as we did back 
after World War II, to get our fiscal 
house in order. I know no one here 
wants to see this projection become re-
ality where we will have record and 
unsustainable debt loads for decades 
and decades to come. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to 
end their reckless spending proposals 
and work with us to get our fiscal 
house back in order. This cannot be the 
legacy we leave for our children and 
our grandchildren.

Then heal us, Lord, and we will be 
healed. Heal us from all that has 
wounded our spirits or hindered us 
from living into our best selves. 
Save us and we will be saved. Save us 
from the uncertainty and unrest of 
these days. Save us from all that dis-
tracts us from seeing You—Your hand 
in our lives or Your face reflected in 
those around us. 
We ask for a word from You. Speak 
that we may hear. Attend to our pleas 
that we may be assured of Your favor. 
Then may Your grace plan be fulfilled 
in our lives. 
At the end of the day, O Lord, reward 
us according to our faithfulness to the 
tasks You have laid before us. Give us 
not what our deeds deserve, but may 
we receive what Your grace provides. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT MAJOR DAN ALTIERI 
(Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and say goodbye to 
my friend and my brother, Sergeant 
Major Dan Altieri. We served together 
in Iraq. 
I have one minute to speak about a 
man who gave thousands of marines 
years of their life back, one minute to 
speak about a marine, a patriot, a 
brother, a legend, who loved us, uncon-
ditionally, both on the battlefield and 
off. 
In this magic minute, I must tell you 
about a marine that is timeless, one 
who will not be forgotten by his men. 
He laughed with us in the good times. 
He mourned with us in the bad times. 
He was always ready to be there and 
say: 
‘‘Hey, 
brother, 
how 
are 
you 
doing?’’ And like a father that many of 
us never had, he would always say: ‘‘I 
am proud of you.’’

REMEMBERING PRIVATE NICOLE 
BURNHAM 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Private Ni-
cole Burnham. Private Burnham didn’t 
die on the battlefield. Her life was sto-
len by the cruelty of her fellow soldiers 
and the apathy of her superiors. 
There are several tragedies in Ni-
cole’s story. 
The first is the horrific sexual as-
sault she endured at the hands of her 
fellow soldiers. 
The second is the failure of our mili-
tary leadership to protect her. 
The third is the amount of time it 
took to ensure something like this 
never happens again. 
Nicole did everything right. She re-
ported the incident and applied for a 
transfer. Instead, her superiors, who 
are capable of deploying soldiers into a 
war zone overnight, let her request lan-
guish for an unconscionable 82 days. 
During that time, she was harassed, os-
tracized, and assaulted a second time.

own life. 
On October 2, the Third Annual Ni-
cole Burnham Veteran Suicide 5k will

We cannot forget Nicole’s story, and

THE VIPER PROGRAM SHOULD BE 
EXTENDED 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, the Buffalo-Niagara region 
faces a serious and tragic rise in gun 
violence, as does the entire country. It 
has devastated neighborhoods and torn 
families apart. 
Crime data released this week con-
firms that this is a local problem and a 
national problem as well. 
In 2020, the number of murders in our 
country spiked by 30 percent, a record 
increase. 
This year, the Department of Justice 
created the Violence Prevention and 
Elimination 
Response 
Task 
Force, 
called VIPER. Its aim is getting illegal 
guns off our streets and stopping vio-
lent criminals. 
VIPER has been remarkably success-
ful at stemming gun violence and sav-
ing lives. 
Buffalo has seen a 50 percent decrease 
in homicides since the program start-
ed. 
Each person lost to gun violence is 
another human denied a lifetime of op-
portunity and a family left behind. 
VIPER is continuing through Octo-
ber, but the Department of Justice 
needs to make this a permanent pro-
gram to stop gun violence in Buffalo 
and throughout the Nation.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
SERGEANT 
MAJOR 
DAN 
ALTIERI 
(Mr. BALDERSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and service 
of Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th 
Marines, Sergeant Major Dan Altieri. 
Sergeant Major was the living em-
bodiment of the Marine Corps motto 
‘‘semper fi,’’ always faithful, dedi-
cating more than 30 years of service to 
the Corps. 
Suffering unprecedented losses dur-
ing its 2005 Iraq deployment, he led his 
marines 
in 
multiple 
combat 
oper-
ations, and Sergeant Major Altieri 
played a vital role in caring for Lima 
upon its return home. 
As his marines and so much more of 
Central Ohio mourned for Lima Com-
pany in the wake of tragedy, it was left 
to Altieri to hold his marines together, 
a task requiring both strength and 
compassion. 
Outside the Marines, he was a family 
man. He was a loving husband and fa-
ther. His devotion to family was re-
flected in the love for his wife, Kovette, 
two grown sons, a sister, and his 
mentorship of others. 
Today, the hearts of so many Ohio-
ans are with the Sergeant Major’s wife 
and family, his Marine Corps family, 
the law enforcement community, and 
to the countless lives touched by this 
remarkable U.S. marine.

RECOGNIZING CLARK COUNTY’S 
BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the tre-
mendous students, staff, and teachers 
at Nevada’s 2021 Blue Ribbon Schools. 
Not one, not two, but three Clark 
County schools, all in Nevada’s Third 
Congressional 
District, 
were 
just 
named National Blue Ribbon Schools 
by the U.S. Department of Education: 
Charlotte 
Hill 
Elementary, 
Frank 
Lamping Elementary, and Pinecrest 
Academy of Nevada Inspirada. 
These schools were recognized for 
their exemplary work to close the 
achievement gap, expand educational 
opportunities, and excel academically. 
I always say education is the key to 
opportunity, and I cannot wait to see 
where all of these incredible young Ne-
vadans will go. 
Congratulations, 
Clark 
County 
schools.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT MAJOR DAN ALTIERI 
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I, too, am pleased to be here 
today with my colleagues to recognize 
the life and incredible service of Ser-
geant Major Dan Altieri. 
Originally from the northeast Ohio 
community of North Canton, Sergeant 
Altieri served our country honorably in 
the United States Marine Corps for 30 
years, ending his career as the regi-
mental sergeant major for the 25th 
Regiment. 
His more than 10 overseas deploy-
ments included tours in Grenada, Leb-
anon, the Gulf war, Afghanistan, and 
Iraq, where he was with the Columbus- 
based Lima Company. 
When Lima Company was struck by a 
series of deadly attacks in 2005, sur-
viving officers turned to Sergeant 
Altieri to help them deal with the un-
speakable travesties that the war had 
brought upon them. A testament to his 
leadership and courage, his marines 
often said they would ‘‘Follow Ser-
geant Altieri.’’ 
Sergeant Altieri’s service also ex-
tended right here at home, serving in 
the Stark County Sheriff’s Office in 
Canton for 25 years as a deputy, keep-
ing our community safe. 
Northeast Ohio mourns the loss of 
Sergeant Altieri, who was taken from 
us far too soon last week at the age of 
62. 
We will forever be grateful to Ser-
geant Altieri’s service, and our commu-
nity and country are certainly better 
off having witnessed his kindness and 
leadership.

REMEMBERING SCOTT LAY 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember Scott Lay, a higher 
education advocate and beloved mem-
ber of California’s public policymaking 
community. 
I came to know Scott when he was a 
young staffer at the Community Col-
lege League of California. A product of 
Orange Coast College himself, Scott ex-
emplified the opportunity that a com-
munity college education avails to mil-
lions of Americans. He would himself 
rise to lead the Community College 
League as its CEO after finishing law 
school at UC Davis. 
He loved politics and technology and 
was a progenitor of highly read news-
letters such as The Roundup and The 
Nooner at the beginning of the online 
publishing boom. 
Scott’s death is untimely and heart-
breaking. He had an infectious enthu-
siasm. I know he would be proud of 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
community college initiative. I know 
he would want to be here to make it 
happen. 
I am very sorry for his loss, and I ex-
press my condolences to his family and 
loved ones.

THE $3.5 TRILLION TROJAN HORSE 
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, 
Democrats are here today proposing an 
elaborate spending scheme that will 
cost $3.5 trillion. 
President Biden claimed this week it 
would cost zero dollars. 
Well, what is the truth? Let’s find 
out what is in this Trojan horse of a 
spending bill: 
The largest tax increase in American 
history. 
A business tax that is going to be 
higher than Communist China, which 
is our number one adversary, putting 
us at a competitive disadvantage and 
causing jobs to go overseas. 
The highest inflation in four decades. 
Already, families are being hit with 
high costs at the gas pump and at the 
grocery store. It is only going to get 
worse with this bill. 
$630 billion for the Green New Deal.

A ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION OPPOR-
TUNITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF 
WORKING FAMILIES 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, even 
before the pandemic, American fami-
lies struggled to cover the expense of 
childcare, with the cost of care for two 
kids consuming 20 to 30 percent of the 
income of most families. 
Since the pandemic began, the situa-
tion has worsened dramatically. Hun-
dreds of Pennsylvania childcare agen-
cies, which operated on the slimmest of 
margins to begin with, have closed per-
manently, and already scarce childcare 
spots have become harder to find. 
Since the pandemic, the lack of 
childcare and continuing school clo-
sures has resulted in millions of par-
ents, mostly women, losing their jobs 
or being forced to leave work due to 
childcare obligations. 
Families 
need 
investment 
in 
childcare now. Women can’t be asked 
to bear the cost of not funding these 
crucial programs any longer. 
The Build Back Better Act is our 
once-in-a-generation 
opportunity 
to 
meet the needs of working families. 
Access to affordable childcare will 
strengthen the financial standing of 
our families, make sure that women 
are not left behind in our recovery, and 
help parents enter or reenter the work-
force and generate new economic activ-
ity. 
Let’s get this done for the American 
people.

GENERAL TRAN HUNG DAO POST 
OFFICE 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about an important fig-
ure in the Vietnamese-American com-
munity, General Tran Hung Dao. 
General Dao was one of the greatest 
Vietnamese military commanders of 
all time. He saved Vietnam from Mon-
golian invasion three times, which is 
considered one of the greatest military 
feats in history. 
General Dao remains a significant 
figure in the Vietnamese community 
today. 
I am proud to represent Little Sai-
gon, which is home to almost 200,000 
Vietnamese Americans, the largest Vi-
etnamese population outside of Viet-
nam. 
This week, in honor of the anniver-
sary of his death on October 3, I intro-
duced a bill that would rename a U.S. 
post office in Little Saigon as the Gen-
eral Tran Hung Dao Post Office. This 
renaming would mean so much to those 
in the Vietnamese-American commu-
nity, which I am so proud to represent.

LET’S WORK TOGETHER ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in opposition to the Democrats’ in-
frastructure proposal. This weekend 
the President said that his Build Back 
Better agenda costs zero dollars and 
that it adds zero dollars to the national 
debt. 
With all due respect, I disagree. The 
CBO’s report projects that it will add 
$398 billion to the deficit. Further, this 
multi-trillion partisan spending spree 
is projected to add as much as $1.75 
trillion to the deficit over the next 10 
years. 
This bill only dedicates less than 10 
percent of its multi-trillion dollar 
price tag to highways, bridges, and 
other projects. Less than 10 percent. 
Last month, Republicans offered our 
own counter bill, the STARTER Act, 
that offered targeted investments in 
core infrastructure that meets our Na-
tion’s needs. 
For years, Congress has worked to-
gether to get a targeted infrastructure 
package across the finish line. Let’s 
get back to doing that.

PROMOTING FISCAL SANITY 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, we are at an extraor-
dinary time in history where inflation 
is threatening every family. 
‘‘At some point, all of us, regardless 
of party, must ask the simple ques-
tion—how much is enough? What I 
have made clear to the President and 
Democratic leaders is that spending 
trillions more on new and expanded 
government programs, when we can’t 
even pay for the essential social pro-
grams like Social Security and Medi-
care, is the definition of fiscal insan-
ity. Suggesting that spending trillions 
more will not have an impact on infla-
tion ignores the everyday reality that 
America’s families continue to pay an 
unavoidable inflation tax. Proposing a 
historic expansion of social programs 
while ignoring the fact we are not in 
recession and that millions of jobs re-
main open . . . . ’’ 
Thank you, Senator JOE MANCHIN, for 
your courage. You and WVOC radio 
talk show host Gary David have ex-
posed insanity. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
our neighborhoods.

JIM VAN ENGELENHOVEN LEAVES 
A LEGACY OF SERVICE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of a man from my district whose legacy 
of serving his community will continue 
to resonate for generations. 
Last 
Monday, 
Jim 
Van 
Engelenhoven, a former Iowa State 
representative from Mahaska County, 
passed away. 
Jim began his career in public serv-
ice by serving in Iowa’s Air National 
Guard. In 1993, Jim was elected to 
Mahaska County’s Board of Super-
visors, where he served until 1998, and 
then began his run as an Iowa State 
representative. 
Jim was loved by many in the 
Mahaska 
County 
community 
and 
across the State of Iowa for his com-
passion and his willingness to go the 
extra mile to serve his community. 
My heart and prayers go out to Jim’s 
wife, Carol; his son, Jeff; and the rest 
of his loved ones. May he rest in peace.

CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF THE 
COMMUNITY FOUNDATION 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 20th anniversary 
of the Community Foundation for 
Rockbridge, Bath, and Alleghany Coun-
ties. 
In 2001, its first year as an inde-
pendent organization, the Community 
Foundation was able to provide $32,000 
in grants to the community. But 
through the support of many individ-
uals, families, and businesses over the 
years, the organization has grown ex-
ponentially. 
In the past 10 years, the Community 
Foundation has been able to grant a 
cumulative $2.5 million to nonprofit or-
ganizations, projects, and programs 
across the organization’s service area. 
Just this year alone, the group will be 
awarding more than $300,000 in commu-
nity grants and an additional $30,000 in 
scholarships. 
These 
grants 
are 
made 
possible 
through the generosity of individuals 
and businesses and primarily support 
projects related to art and culture, 
community 
betterment, 
education, 
health, and human services. 
In celebration of their 20 years, the 
organization pledged to give away 
$20,000 in 20 days to various nonprofits 
throughout our region. Their work is 
truly inspiring, and we thank them for 
their tireless efforts. 
I wish the Community Foundation 
another 20-plus years of success.

TRACY STONE-MANNING 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
today, of all days, amidst the ongoing 
flurry of dysfunction, Democrat leader 
CHUCK SCHUMER is inserting a vote to 
confirm Tracy Stone-Manning as direc-
tor of the Bureau of Land Management 
through the United States Senate, hid-
den from the view and the attention of 
local communities. 
For months, my Western Caucus col-
leagues and I have been pleading with 
our Senate colleagues to listen to the 
voices of those who have spoken up of 
Ms. Stone-Manning’s radical views, her 
violations of several Federal laws, and 
her collusion with ecoterrorists. 
Ms. Stone-Manning is simply, clear-
ly, and patently unfit to hold this of-
fice. Even several Obama administra-
tion officials, including his BLM direc-
tor, agree. 
Let me be clear, a vote for Tracy 
Stone-Manning is a vote against farm-
ers, ranchers, our public land users, 
and our rural communities throughout 
the West. 
This 
is 
a 
shameful 
display 
of 
hyperpartisanship. The Senate should 
reject her nomination and recognize 
that rural America deserves better.

WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I had the privilege of visiting 
the border with President Trump in 
June to see our Border Patrol agents 
doing one of the most dangerous jobs 
imaginable. They face the threat of 
MS–13 and violent drug cartels who 
have been empowered and enriched by 
the Biden administration. 
Sadly, the left is vilifying the Border 
Patrol the same way they vilified our 
police officers during the defund the 
police movement. 
The American people want secure 
borders and safe communities. Even 
President 
Obama 
this 
week 
said 
Biden’s 
open 
border 
policies 
are 
unsustainable because we are a nation 
with borders. I want to thank Presi-
dent Obama for affirming that we are a 
nation of laws and a nation with bor-
ders, and I hope the Biden administra-
tion will listen to him. 
f 
TAXES WILL BE RAISED 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, this 
debt 
ceiling 
increase 
being 
con-
templated isn’t just about paying off 
things we have already committed for. 
It is actually a blank check for unlim-
ited spending until December of 2022. 
Our collective national debt is some-
where around $28 trillion now, or about 
$85,000 per person. Every American. 
Now, in 2013 the lie of the year was 
named, ‘‘If you like your health plan, 
you can keep it.’’ In the Biden cam-
paign, it was, ‘‘Nobody making under 
$400,000 would have their taxes raised, 
period.’’ That is setting up to be the 
next lie of the year. 
The effects we see of this legislation 
will be 5 percent of taxpayers earning 
between $40,000 and $50,000 and 59 per-
cent of those earning between $200,000 
and $500,000 would be affected greatly 
by increased taxes. 
Let that sink in. The President’s 
plan will raise taxes on people making 
as low as $40,000, not the $400,000 he 
promised. 
We should be talking about hard caps 
on spending and getting our fiscal 
house in order instead of spending on 
the Green New Deal that is coming up. 
f 
PARTISAN SPENDING WILL HARM 
OUR COUNTRY 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
Democrats’ now estimated $4.3 trillion 
budget reconciliation bill that calls for 
the highest sustained Federal spending 
levels in American history. 
Combined with the infrastructure 
bill, this results in a partisan $5.5 tril-
lion package that will further hurt our 
economy and, most importantly, the 
American people. 
This legislation is filled with a spend-
ing spree of far-left policies before the 
government is funded for next year at 
a time when inflation is at a 13-year 
high. Everyday goods are more expen-
sive for Americans, while the pur-
chasing power of an hour of work has 
declined by 0.7 percent over the last 
year. 
Families are paying more and mak-
ing less, and trillions more in govern-
ment spending would only exacerbate 
this economic crisis. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple should not have to bear the brunt 
of the Democrats’ agenda. I firmly op-
pose the legislation that solely focuses 
on the left’s priorities while furthering 
our national debt. I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same.

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 
MATRIC GROUP 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the Matric Group located in 
Venango County, Pennsylvania. 
What originally started out as a 
hobby by two electrical engineers has 
now turned into a $60-plus million com-
pany with three locations across west-
ern Pennsylvania and more than 300 
employees. 
The Matric Group is celebrating a 
major milestone this year, 50 years of 
electronic manufacturing. 
The electronics field is developing at 
lightning speed, and Matric Group has 
continued to adapt to the ever-growing 
changes. It is this angle of their busi-
nesses which drives them to success. 
As customers discover outdated or 
obsolete components, Matric Group is 
there to help respin or redesign to keep 
their current products relevant. 
For the past 50 years, Matric Group 
has been a strong cornerstone in our 
community. The commitment and de-
termination of President Turner and 
the entire workforce is admirable. 
Congratulations to Rick Turner and 
the rest of the Matric Group team. May 
you find success for another 50 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5578 
September 30, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Extending Government Funding 
and Delivering Emergency Assistance 
Act. By extending government funding 
through December 3, this bill provides 
tens of billions of dollars to support 
working families who live paycheck to 
paycheck. 
It 
ensures 
that 
vital 
education, 
health, housing, and public safety pro-
grams continue to serve those who rely 
on them. And at a time of economic 
devastation in many parts of our coun-
try, we need a government that looks 
out for the middle class, for working 
families, for small businesses, and the 
vulnerable who work hard. 
The funding in this bill will grow op-
portunity and lift up hardworking 
American families. It will support our 
early childhood education programs, 
our schools, and our high-quality job 
training. It will continue to help the 
hungry put food on the table and keep 
food safety inspectors on the job. 
It will safeguard our consumers from 
product safety hazards and protect our 
environment from polluters, and it will 
ensure the most vulnerable remain 
healthy and housed with access to life-
saving resources and support services 
that they need. 
As I have made clear, this bill is not 
a permanent solution. I look forward to 
soon beginning negotiations with my 
counterparts 
across 
the 
aisle 
and 
across the Capitol to complete full- 
year government funding bills that re-
verse decades of disinvestment. 
In addition to the temporary funding 
extension, this bill responds to recent 
emergencies 
such 
as 
hurricanes, 
storms, wildfires, extreme heat, and se-
vere drought. Thousands of Americans 
across the United States are still suf-
fering from the impact of these many 
recent disasters. That is why this bill 
provides $28.6 billion in desperately 
needed Federal aid to all corners of our 
Nation, including $7.5 billion for Hurri-
cane Ida so that struggling families, 
small businesses, and hard-hit commu-
nities can get back on their feet and re-
build their lives and their livelihoods. 
Further, in addition to responding to 
these recent natural disasters, this bill 
addresses the humanitarian needs re-
sulting from the end of 20 years of war 
in Afghanistan. 
Today, we are providing $6.3 billion 
for urgent humanitarian assistance in 
the region, including assistance for 
vulnerable 
populations, 
including 
women, girls, and minorities. And it 
honors our commitments to our Af-
ghan allies and their families who are 
now in the United States. 
This bill supports temporary hous-
ing, security screenings, and long-term 
resettlement of these Afghan evacuees, 
and it paves the way to ensure that 
people who risk their lives for us can 
make a new life here where they will 
contribute richly to the fabric of our 
Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud of this 
bill. The moral test of government is 
defined by how we treat those who need 
our help. Investing in our citizens and 
delivering relief where it is needed lays 
the groundwork to build back better 
from the devastation of the pandemic. 
The American people are worth the 
investment. The American people are 
capable of building a future that is 
stronger and more prosperous as long 
as they have the tools they need to do 
it. This bill helps ensure that they 
have those tools. 
Madam Speaker, I especially thank 
the hardworking staff on both sides of 
the aisle of the Committee on Appro-
priations for their work on this bill, in-
cluding majority staff director, Robin 
Juliano; deputy, Matt Washington; the 
front office staff, and the clerks of the 
12 subcommittees; and the communica-
tions team. 
I thank Ranking Member GRANGER 
for her partnership and the work of the 
minority staff, including staff director, 
Anne Marie Chotvacs, and deputy, 
Johnnie Kaberle. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. This has 
been a bipartisan and a bicameral 
agreement in an effort of which we are 
proud. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to 
speak about H.R. 5305, a bill that will 
prevent the Federal Government from 
shutting down and provide a helping 
hand to Americans who have faced loss 
and 
devastation 
due 
to 
storms, 
wildfires, and other natural disasters. 
I should note that I opposed a similar 
package last week when it came to the 
floor. Since that time, the Senate has 
removed the debt ceiling from the bill. 
Madam Speaker, let me reinforce an 
important point for those listening to 
us debate this bill. We did not have to 
be in this place just hours before shut-
down. Republicans made it clear in Au-
gust that tying a debt ceiling vote to 
the continuing resolution was not 
something we could support. 
Our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, the party that controls the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House decided to do exactly what we 
asked them not to do. I hope we can 
soon move forward with the stopgap 
measure so that the critical function of 
government can continue and the Com-
mittee on Appropriations can finish 
the fiscal year 2022 bills. If we don’t 
pass a CR today, we will be faced with 
an unnecessary and costly government 
shutdown, which would impact mili-
tary readiness, border security, and so 
many important programs Americans 
rely on. 
Before I close, I must admit that I 
am disappointed that an issue I raised 
repeatedly on the floor of the House 
last week is not yet resolved. 
I firmly believe that we cannot wait 
any longer to replenish Israel’s Iron 
Dome missile defense system that was 
so successful this past spring when 
Israel was under attack. The Iron 
Dome bill that passed the House last 
week had overwhelming support of 420 
votes. The best solution would have 
been for the Senate to add back the 
Iron Dome funding to this CR. Since 
that did not happen, I hope my col-
leagues in the Senate will continue to 
work to get the Iron Dome bill passed 
as a standalone legislation as quickly 
as possible. 
Israel deserves our strong support. It 
is essential that the terrorists who 
wish to do them harm know that the 
United States stands by our allies and 
friends. I also have concerns about 
some of the provisions related to Af-
ghanistan. I hope the issues raised by 
Senator COTTON during consideration 
this morning can be addressed. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I really am pleased 
that we are here this afternoon to take 
up the continuing resolution bill. 
I would just make one point. It is a 
bill where the debt limit is not at-
tached. My colleague on the other side 
of the aisle brought up the issue of the 
debt limit. It is very hard for me really 
to understand the reluctance of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
both in the House and in the Senate, 
for their willingness to raise the debt 
limit. The debt limit is a shared re-
sponsibility of both parties. In the 
past, Democrats have voted to increase 
the debt limit under Republican Presi-
dents, because it certainly should be 
well-known here—maybe the general 
public doesn’t understand it—but I do 
it because when they incur bills and 
the bill comes in the mail, they don’t 
have the luxury of saying, I am op-
posed to paying my bills, and I will not 
do it. 
Ordinary people in this country un-
derstand that when you incur debt that 
you have to pay for it. You don’t have 
the luxury of saying no. Maybe our col-
leagues in both the House and the Sen-
ate believe that this is a luxury that 
they can just say no. But throwing the 
United States into default and destroy-
ing the full faith and credit of the 
United States is not governing. It is 
not a shared responsibility or shared 
principle of values and who we are. 
As it turns out, just because the prior 
administration was in the hands of my 
Republican colleagues, 97 percent of 
that debt was incurred under the prior 
administration, Republican adminis-
tration. So this is not about paying 
for—as some of my colleagues would 
like to say—spending going forward. It 
is not the case. It really is not the 
case. It is about paying for what we 
have already incurred.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5579 
September 30, 2021 
And in a bipartisan way, I might add, 
we did incur debt. We passed what was 
necessary, in a bipartisan way, to ad-
dress the issues of the greatest eco-
nomic and healthcare crisis that this 
Nation has experienced in a generation 
with the pandemic. 
And we came forward with CARES 
packages, with a rescue package, and 
we said it is a necessity. We have to 
make sure that we have an airline in-
dustry. We have to make sure that res-
taurants can stay open. We have to 
make sure that we have childcare fa-
cilities. We have to make sure that our 
hospitals can cope with what is coming 
in the door. We have to move to test-
ing, and we have to look at how we are 
able to get people in this country vac-
cinated. And we came together to incur 
that kind of a debt. Now it is time for 
us to recognize that we need to raise 
that debt ceiling in order to do that. 
I just might add—and I will speak 
personally about this—when the prior 
administration instituted the tax cut, 
$2 trillion in a tax cut that went to the 
richest one-tenth of 1 percent of the 
people in this Nation, I was opposed to 
that. I couldn’t support it. I spoke out 
against it here on the floor of the 
House, in my own community. 
But 
yet, 
when 
President 
Trump 
called for an increase in the debt limit, 
I said yes, because I believed it was my 
duty. It was my responsibility to make 
sure that the full faith and credit of 
the United States was addressed. So I 
still do not understand the reluctance, 
except maybe for political reasons, but 
nevertheless, we are here today. 
Madam Speaker, I would also make a 
comment on the Iron Dome, and as we 
pointed out last week, as I did, that we 
needed to, in fact, always really be 
there for our ally in the Middle East, 
our trusted ally in Israel, and we 
moved forward with a freestanding bill 
and a suspension, which we passed. And 
it is my understanding that the Senate 
is going to move in the same direction. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1445 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and for her extraordinary service and 
leadership as the chair of the Appro-
priations Committee. I commend her 
and I commend the ranking member 
for their leadership in bringing this bi-
partisan legislation to the floor. It was 
formulated in a bipartisan way. It was 
voted for in the Senate with a large bi-
partisan vote just earlier today, and 
now we will be able to pass this legisla-
tion, enroll it in a ceremony, and send 
it to the President of the United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, I thank not only the 
chair but the chairs of the subcommit-
tees. We call them the cardinals. They 
have all worked so hard to get us to 
this place, which will make such a dif-
ference. 
Actually, Madam Speaker, it helps us 
honor what the Constitution is about. 
The Preamble said to ‘‘establish jus-
tice, ensure domestic tranquility, pro-
vide for the common defense, promote 
the general welfare, and secure the 
blessings of liberty to ourselves and 
our posterity.’’ 
So establishing justice, justice in 
many broad senses of the word: helping 
hungry families, ensuring people have 
access to justice and the courts, ad-
vancing fairness in health and in the 
workplace. 
Ensure domestic tranquility: funding 
Interior, keeping the commerce and 
economy of America running smoothly. 
Providing for the common defense: 
paying our troops and diplomats and 
keeping our homeland safe. 
Promoting the general welfare: edu-
cating our children, keeping workers 
paid, fighting the climate crisis, pro-
tecting the environment, providing re-
lief for families suffering from natural 
disasters. 
Securing the blessings of liberty: in-
cluding by helping resettle Afghan ref-
ugees. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair 
for the important language she crafted 
in a bipartisan way in this legislation. 
What is important about it right now 
is that it meets the needs of people who 
are affected by Hurricane Ida across 
our country. That is why it is hard to 
believe, from time to time, that our 
colleagues cannot support something 
that helps the immediate needs of their 
constituents at home. 
When disaster strikes, it is clear in 
our country that we are there for them. 
There is a social compact. Disaster 
strikes. We are there. And this, in 
record time, has come out since Hurri-
cane Ida. And so many people af-
fected—both in elective office and peo-
ple affected by elective office who have 
to deliver the services—have said this 
is the fastest we have ever received re-
lief. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair 
and the ranking member for their tre-
mendous leadership in honoring the vi-
sion of our Founders and meeting the 
needs of the American people; honor 
our commitment to the Afghan evac-
uees who have come here, and in so 
many other ways; and, of course, ad-
dressing the disaster assistance, Hurri-
cane Ida and other disaster assistance 
that is needed. 
Again, it provides secure government 
funding through December 3, providing 
an appropriate amount of time for 
Democrats and Republicans, House and 
Senate, to address appropriations pri-
orities in the regular order process for 
fiscal year 2022. 
Democrats are for the people, and we 
will fight to protect their health, the 
national security, and their well-being. 
This legislation does just that, espe-
cially in time of natural disaster, 
which is especially important. 
Madam Speaker, I once again com-
mend the leadership on this, and I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chairman 
of the Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Energy and Water Development. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in solidarity with the American people 
who want our government to work by 
passage of this continuing resolution. 
When I talk to hardworking families, 
seniors, and veterans that I represent, 
not once did I hear a single person say 
they want their parks shut down, their 
Social Security offices closed and em-
ployees furloughed, or their VA bene-
fits and healthcare services delayed. 
So not to allow the government to 
function would be outrageous. The con-
tinuing resolution we have before us 
today will ensure the Federal Govern-
ment remains operational, that people 
are taken care of, and we must deliver 
the emergency relief to communities 
which have been devastated by recent 
natural disasters, as the Speaker ref-
erenced. 
As the chair of the Energy and Water 
Development Subcommittee, it is im-
portant to highlight that this con-
tinuing resolution will ensure that the 
Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau 
of Reclamation, and the Department of 
Energy have the resources necessary to 
continue their vital work to families 
and communities across our Nation, in-
cluding those that are running short of 
water and where fires are raging. 
As we continue to respond to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we implore our 
colleagues to work in the best interest 
of the people we represent, not throw 
up roadblocks that harm our Nation 
that is crawling its way out of a pan-
demic. 
The American people deserve the best 
we have to offer. Let’s pass this con-
tinuing resolution and continue our 
work to build back better for all of 
America. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. BISHOP), the chairman of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Agriculture. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 5305. Keeping our government 
funded and functioning is a basic re-
sponsibility of the Congress. This is 
must-pass legislation. 
Passage will give time to finalize the 
fiscal year 2022 funding bills without a 
government shutdown, and we should 
get that done as soon as possible. As 
chairman of the Agriculture, Rural De-
velopment, Food and Drug Administra-
tion, 
and 
Related 
Agencies 
Sub-
committee, I want to highlight several 
items in our jurisdiction. 
First, the bill includes $10 billion for 
agricultural disaster assistance pro-
grams to cover events in 2020 and 2021.

gency Watershed Protection Program 
to help communities address damages 
caused by natural disasters that impair 
the watersheds. 
Moreover, it ensures USDA can con-
tinue to help expand economic oppor-
tunity, create jobs in rural areas, and 
fully meet the demand for farm owner-
ship loans. And it provides the author-
ity and funding to allow the Food and 
Nutrition 
Service 
to 
increase 
the 
amount of fruits and vegetables in the 
WIC Food Package, increasing nutri-
tion security at a time when food inse-
curity is rampant across our country. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
committee staffs on both the Appro-
priations and the Agriculture Commit-
tees. I want to thank Chair DELAURO, 
the ranking member, and the com-
mittee members for their dedicated 
work on the many difficult issues ad-
dressed in this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill and keep the government open so 
that the programs meant to help Amer-
ica grow economically and recover 
from natural disasters can continue to 
help people all across this country. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE), the chair-
man 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chair DELAURO for 
her tremendous leadership, as well as 
our Speaker, for ensuring that our gov-
ernment stays open and responds to 
key emergencies here at home and 
abroad. 
It is really a shame that we have to 
vote on this measure here today a sec-
ond time with the end of the fiscal year 
looming because of the refusal of Sen-
ate Republicans to protect the full 
faith and credit of the Federal Treas-
ury. 
Nonetheless, we must get this bill 
done and to the President’s desk today. 
This bill contains crucial funding for 
my State in the West, our Western 
communities that have been so badly 
impacted by wildfires. In California, we 
are on the front lines of this climate 
emergency. 
This bill includes $28.6 billion to di-
rectly address the rising cost of cli-
mate change. Californians have lost 
homes, crops, livelihoods, and even 
lives because of the climate crisis. We 
need to get them this urgent help right 
away. 
As chair of the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Subcommittee, I am really 
pleased that this legislation also in-
cludes over $6.3 billion to continue sup-
port for Afghan evacuees, refugees, and 
the growing humanitarian needs of the 
Afghan people. 
At least 18.4 million people in Af-
ghanistan require humanitarian assist-
ance 
due 
to 
the 
conflict, 
severe 
drought, and the COVID pandemic. 
President Biden was right to end our 
war in Afghanistan. Now we have a 
moral responsibility to provide safe 
harbor for vulnerable Afghans who fear 
for their lives, but to also provide hu-
manitarian assistance to those suf-
fering inside Afghanistan. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), the chair of the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Military Con-
struction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, here we go again. Just 
last week we were here urging our Re-
publican colleagues to help us avert a 
government shutdown. 
Now, wait for it. We are back because 
congressional Republicans refused to 
pass the government funding bill since 
it included a provision to ensure that 
America pays our bills for debt already 
incurred on their watch under the 
Trump administration. 
The brinksmanship and the last- 
minute, hand-wringing, gut-wrenching 
angst that we are put through and that 
America is put through every single 
time when the Republicans just refuse 
to be fiscally responsible is jaw drop-
ping. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this clean continuing resolution be-
cause, first and foremost, it will keep 
government open through early Decem-
ber. It extends funding for critical edu-
cation, for health, for housing and pub-
lic safety programs. 
Secondly, the bill will provide mil-
lions of Americans with emergency as-
sistance to help rebuild from recent 
hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and 
blizzards. 
Third, Afghan evacuees will receive 
urgent humanitarian assistance to help 
them settle here. 
And, finally, I thank the gentle-
woman from Connecticut, the chair of 
the Appropriations Committee, for her 
help with this, as well as Speaker 
PELOSI and Chairman CARTWRIGHT. The 
bill includes $22 million for the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology to investigate the Surfside 
building collapse in my district. 
Madam Speaker, we have years in 
front of us to determine just exactly 
how this building collapse occurred, 
and to adopt policies to make sure that 
it never happens anywhere in the coun-
try again. 
Now, Republicans voted against all of 
this last week. We need to pass this CR 
today, but we also need to address the 
debt limit. You know, Republicans al-
ways talk as if the U.S. Government 
were a business, even though it is a 
specious and wildly inaccurate anal-
ogy. 
Nevertheless, for argument’s sake, I 
ask my Republican colleagues: If you 
were running a business and decided 
not to pay your creditors, would you 
think that is a smart business move? 
How long do you think your business 
would remain in business? Not very 
long. 
But at the end of the day, the govern-
ment is, of course, not a business. We 
are 
the 
globe’s 
leading 
economic 
power, and the dollar is the world’s re-
serve currency. In many cases, deficit 
spending by the U.S. Government can 
jump-start our economy, support the 
global economic system, and quickly 
create American jobs. 
And Republicans seemed to strongly 
agree with all of this during every year 
of the Trump administration, when 
they passed record-high budgets and 
didn’t pay for nearly any of it. 
Well, I say to my friends, the bill has 
come due. Let’s pass this continuing 
resolution today and keep the govern-
ment open. 
And tomorrow, let’s stop this legisla-
tive vandalism and get responsible 
about making sure we pay our bills and 
raise the debt ceiling. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1500 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity. 
I stand in support of this CR. This 
measure will provide $28.6 billion in 
emergency funds for communities and 
Federal agencies affected by the recent 
hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural 
disasters; including $10 billion for the 
Agriculture Department to cover crop 
losses that occurred during the ’20 and 
’21 storms. Of that amount, $750 mil-
lion will be provided to livestock pro-
ducers. 
Madam Speaker, $5.68 billion is for 
the Army Corps of Engineers. Of that 
amount, $3 billion would be used to ac-
celerate flood and storm risk reduction 
projects, and $2.08 billion would be used 
to repair disaster-related damages. 
Madam Speaker, $5 billion would be 
for the Housing and Urban Develop-
ment Department’s community devel-
opment fund for major disasters that 
occurred during the ’20 and ’21 hurri-
cane seasons; $2.6 billion for Transpor-
tation Department reimbursements to 
States and territories to repair damage 
to roads and bridges caused by natural 
disasters; $1.36 billion for the U.S. For-
est Service to address damage caused 
by natural disasters; $1.2 billion for the 
Small Business Administration’s dis-
aster loans programs; and $565 million 
for the Navy to repair facilities dam-
aged by the storms that occurred in 
2020 and 2021. 
The American people deserve the se-
curity of knowing that their govern-
ment will continue to function. Amer-
ica deserves to know that the Rep-
resentatives they send to Washington 
will rise above politics and partisan-
ship and fight for the American people

and make sure that at its core that we 
will maintain the full faith and credit 
of our country, that we will pay our 
bills, and that we will fight for the se-
curity of our people abroad. We must 
make sure that everywhere else under-
stands that America is open for busi-
ness, will continue to be open for busi-
ness, and we will remain the super-
power that we are because we are re-
sponsible. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I said a moment ago 
that the bill before us delivers to the 
survivors of recent disasters. 
One of things I am most proud of 
with this bill—and we did work on a bi-
partisan basis in this effort—is under-
standing that all parts of this Nation 
have suffered, whether it is a drought, 
whether it is a hurricane, or whether it 
is a wildfire, whatever it is, we have ex-
perienced these disasters all over our 
country. That was what was most im-
portant when we looked at how we 
wanted to address this, which is why 
we put in $28.6 billion in disaster relief. 
All over this country we are experi-
encing difficulty, and so this bill ad-
dresses that. 
If I take a look at where we are over-
all, agriculture has been mentioned. 
We have got $10 billion to cover the 
losses from natural disasters that oc-
curred in 2020 and 2021. We do $275 mil-
lion for emergency watershed protec-
tion programs to help the communities 
address the damages that were made to 
infrastructure caused by natural disas-
ters, and that impaired watersheds. 
When we talk about our Commerce- 
Justice-Science we look at—and my 
colleague from Florida talked about 
this—$22 million for investigations into 
building collapses. We saw the horror 
of those scenes every day and every 
night in the sadness of families who 
were not able to say goodbye to loved 
ones who were caught in the rubble of 
that collapse. But the funding is there. 
It is the proper role for the Federal 
Government to help to reduce the risk 
of future similar building failures. 
Again, with legal services as it ap-
plies to disaster relief; $25 million to 
cover unanticipated Hurricane Ida-re-
lated costs. 
In defense, we had damages to our de-
fense industry, our Air Force facilities, 
in which case we have put in funding to 
address that effort. 
Our colleague, Congresswoman KAP-
TUR, spoke about the Energy and Water 
Development, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee; $100 million to study 
potential projects in order to reduce 
risk from future floods and hurricanes. 
Army Corps of Engineers, $3 billion to 
accelerate construction of flood and 
storm damage reduction projects to re-
duce risk from future floods and hurri-
canes. The Army Corps of Engineers, 
Mississippi River tributaries, to look 
at flood and storm damage reduction 
projects. It is vast. The central Utah 
project, $10 million to address damages 
from wildfires. 
Department of the Interior, Bureau 
of Reclamation, Department of En-
ergy—Small Business Administration 
disaster loan programs; $1.2 billion to 
support $6.2 billion in low-interest 
loans to help businesses, nonprofit or-
ganizations. 
Homeowners, 
renters, 
helping them to recover from disasters 
that are beyond their control. 
This is the proper role for the Fed-
eral Government to be engaged and in-
volved in these efforts. 
We have Federal highways; $2.6 bil-
lion to reimburse States and territories 
for damage from natural disasters to 
roads and bridges in our National High-
way System. Community Development 
Block Grant, which is a lifeline to our 
communities; $5 billion, long-term dis-
aster recovery relief. It is restoration 
of housing and infrastructure, eco-
nomic revitalization, and mitigation 
measures. 
As I said years ago in the aftermath 
of Katrina, a journalist wrote that gov-
ernment had a covenant, if you will, 
with our communities in the face of 
natural disaster. And when he wrote 
about Katrina, he said, when the levees 
broke, that covenant was broken. 
We do not want to break that cov-
enant again because of a natural dis-
aster. We want to make sure that we 
can help to rebuild our communities 
and make sure that they have what 
they need in order to move forward. 
Again, as I mentioned, this helps to 
deliver for the survivors of the needs of 
Afghan refugees and evacuees. This is, 
as I have often said, really about our 
moral responsibility and imperative to 
be with those who helped us with sacri-
ficing their lives and the lives of their 
families. 
I reserve the balance of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, again, as I try to 
point out over and over again, besides 
natural disasters and besides Afghan 
evacuees, the critical services that 
have to do with healthcare, with edu-
cation, and with nutrition are carried 
over in this bill. And this is for people 
who live paycheck to paycheck. 
Today let us send this bill to the 
President’s desk and keep government 
open and serving those in need. 
Tomorrow let us continue the fight 
for funding bills that deliver for the 
people and truly build back better 
prioritizing working families who have 
been left behind by decades of dis-
investment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the order of the House of 
September 29, 2021, the previous ques-
tion is ordered. 
The question is on the motion offered 
by the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Republican leader is rec-
ognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
today the Senate will consider and pass 
a government funding bill and do our 
part to avoid a shutdown. 
The continuing resolution contains a 
number of key items that Republicans 
called for. That includes supplemental 
funds to help resettle vetted Afghan 
refugees and hurricane recovery aid for 
Louisiana. 
It is seriously disappointing that the 
Democratic side would not let us in-
clude funding for Israel’s Iron Dome in 
the base text. It honestly baffles me 
that defensive aid to our ally Israel has 
become a thorny subject for the polit-
ical left. 
But, overall, this is encouraging 
progress. The Democratic majority has 
begun to realize that the way forward 
on basic governing duties matches the 
roadmap that Republicans have been 
laying out for months. On government 
funding, what Republicans laid out all 
along was a clean continuing resolu-
tion without the poison pill of a debt 
limit increase. That is exactly what we 
will pass today. Earlier this week, the 
Democratic leader tried to muscle 
through something different through a 
partisan jam, but it failed. Now the 
government will be funded as we laid 
out. That is step 1. 
Next will come step 2: the debt ceil-
ing. And we have clearly laid out the 
way forward there as well. As I have 
explained since last July—last July— 
Democrats need to begin the fast-track 
process for handling this issue through 
reconciliation. Clumsy attempts at 
partisan jams by the majority will not 
change that reality. It didn’t work on 
government funding, and it won’t work 
on the debt limit. They will just be 
wasting valuable time. 
I think this reality is hopefully start-
ing to dawn on our colleagues. Multiple 
leading 
House 
Democrats 
acknowl-
edged just this week that their unified 
Democratic government is fully capa-
ble—fully capable—of fast-tracking a 
debt limit increase on their own. Non-
partisan experts have confirmed that 
they have plenty of time to get this 
done before late October. 
At the same time that the Senate 
Democratic leader says, incorrectly, 
that he doesn’t have enough time, he 
has spent weeks of the Senate’s time 
processing 
midlevel 
nominations. 
Today, the majority is spending mul-
tiple hours to confirm a Bureau of

Land Management nominee who lit-
erally collaborated with ecoterrorists, 
fiddling away day after day after day 
while they pretend they lack the time 
to do their most basic job. 
Senate Republicans have been totally 
transparent. We have given Democrats 
a step-by-step guide to governing in 
this environment and months of ad-
vance notice to get it done. The conclu-
sion to draw from this week is very 
clear: Clumsy efforts at partisan jams 
do not work. What works is when the 
majority accepts the reality of the sit-
uation. 
We are able to fund the government 
today because the majority accepted 
reality. The same thing will need to 
happen on the debt limit next week. 
TRIBUTE TO SUE THARP 
Now, Madam President, on an en-
tirely different matter, few public serv-
ants know Western Kentucky and its 
people as well as my good friend Sue 
Tharp. Sue has served as my team’s 
Paducah-based field assistant since 
1985. She is retiring this month after 
nearly four decades of uninterrupted 
service to the Commonwealth. 
Sue holds the record for being the 
longest continually serving employee 
from my entire career in public serv-
ice. She has been with me since day 
one of my Senate service. 
So, today, I would like to honor this 
one-of-a-kind Kentuckian whose steady 
leadership in Western Kentucky has 
been integral to my office’s mission to 
serve the Bluegrass and the people who 
call it home. 
Now, when you ask Sue’s colleagues 
to describe their coworker, you hear 
one word again and again and again: 
dedicated. In 36 years, Sue has scarcely 
missed a day in the office. She tackles 
each constituent problem with her 
quick wit and her smile. Her knowledge 
of Western Kentucky is encyclopedic. 
And Sue has played a key part in train-
ing almost every other field staffer on 
our team, sharing hard-won wisdom 
with the next generation of public serv-
ants. 
So when I think of Sue’s service to 
Kentucky, two images come to mind. 
The first is Sue winning over even the 
most impassioned callers to my office, 
whether the call started out friendly or 
not. Sue will listen carefully, record 
their concerns, and do all she can to 
help. But then she also invariably will 
end up discussing other favorite topics, 
such as quilting. Sue is an avid volun-
teer at the National Quilt Museum in 
Paducah. So when the conversation 
wraps up, Sue will be smiling, and you 
know the person who just hung up on 
the other end is smiling too. 
The second image comes from an 
event called Fancy Farm, which is an 
annual picnic in Graves County. It is 
the crown jewel of Western Kentucky’s 
heritage. Sue is one of the event’s most 
enthusiastic attendees. She often trav-
els down early to peruse the area’s 
many antique stores. She loves attend-
ing the church barbecue, taking in the 
speeches, and cheering with the crowd. 
Any politician who steps up to that po-
dium is guaranteed to notice Sue 
amidst the throng. 
Sue’s day job has been public service 
for more than three decades, but even 
that hasn’t soaked up all of her love 
and service for her community. She is 
also an enthusiastic volunteer, a fre-
quent participant in Paducah’s ambas-
sador program, and one of the city’s 
all-around biggest boosters. 
If you sample a Paducah boat tour or 
roll into town for a ribbon-cutting, it 
might well be Sue Tharp welcoming 
you to town, decked out in the ambas-
sador’s characteristic red jacket. Visit 
the Quilt Museum, and it will be Sue 
handing you a brochure. Vacation in 
one of Western Kentucky’s beautiful 
parks, and Sue Tharp will be waving to 
you from the door of her RV. 
Sue’s dedication to Western Ken-
tucky and its people is boundless. For 
all these years, she understood that 
while my staff report to me, all of us 
report to the people of Kentucky. In 
fact, at one point I believe Sue even 
lived directly across the street from 
our Paducah office. 
So while Sue is departing our team, I 
am positive she isn’t finished serving 
Kentucky. This is just the next chap-
ter. More time to volunteer, more time 
to be generous to her friends and her 
neighbors, and more time with her hus-
band Dan and son Benjamin. 
So, Sue, I couldn’t be more grateful. 
Thank you for your decades of hard 
work and for your lasting impact on 
the Commonwealth. 
TRIBUTE TO JANE LEE 
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, the pressing matters I discussed at 
the beginning of my remarks suggest I 
could not find a more appropriate time 
to honor the sterling staff expert who 
has advised me on budget issues and 
appropriations for over 5 years. But, in 
another sense, it pains me to say there 
couldn’t be a worse time because the 
occasion for this tribute is that Jane 
Lee is soon taking leave of the Senate 
and taking the next step in her career. 
Jane arrived in my office with a big 
job to do but the perfect skill set to do 
it. She studied at a couple of schools 
called Stanford and Columbia. She had 
worked in the private sector, risen 
through the ranks at OMB during the 
Bush 43 administration, worked for a 
House Budget chairman named Paul 
Ryan, and held leading rolls with Sen-
ate 
Appropriations 
and 
Republican 
Whip JOHN CORNYN. 
Jane’s resume was impeccable, her 
references unimpeachable. She was al-
ready a force of nature on Capitol Hill, 
so my expectations, as you can imag-
ine, were high from the start. But for 
about 51⁄2 years, day in and day out, 
through a never-ending catalog of seri-
ous challenges, Jane kept raising the 
bar higher and higher. 
Jane’s 
colleagues 
throughout 
the 
Senate admire her determination and 
her dogged focus. She is methodical 
and meticulous. She grasps both the 
big political picture and the finest pol-
icy details much more capably than 
most people could hope to grasp either. 
When you handle budget talks and 
funding negotiations for a leadership 
office, you are kind of a hybrid player- 
coach to offices and committees all 
across the Senate. Jane is a skilled 
leader. She can get a diverse team driv-
ing toward a goal with warmth and 
good humor but also tenacity and total 
professionalism. 
For countless major bipartisan and 
bicameral compromise bills over the 
past 5 years, Jane has been one of very 
last staff experts on either side holding 
the pen. She is a principled fighter, but 
once negotiations concluded, everyone 
on both sides trusted Jane to be an 
honorable and honest broker. That 
speaks volumes. 
Earlier this week, one of Jane’s col-
leagues remarked simply, ‘‘I don’t 
think I’ve ever worked with someone 
like Jane.’’ This turns out to be the 
universal consensus of everyone. Her 
knowledge and her instincts spill out-
side her portfolio and make everyone 
look better. The high standards to 
which she holds herself are infectious. 
She marshals the knowledge and the 
relationships that come with many 
years of government service but also 
inexhaustible earnestness, energy, and 
enthusiasm for the fray. 
So Jane is exactly the kind of person 
you would hope to find in the govern-
ment, just the kind of worker a Senate 
office is lucky to find, and just the sort 
of public servant the country deserves. 
I don’t think anyone would be ter-
ribly surprised if, one day, the Senate 
finds itself refamiliarizing ourselves 
with Jane’s qualifications in a formal 
capacity. 
I have to note that Jane would has-
ten to redirect all this praise toward 
her parents Michael and Jean, as well 
as her grandmother Hee Soon. She is a 
proud 
daughter 
of 
first-generation 
Americans and small business entre-
preneurs whose love of country and 
commitment to hard work have shaped 
their daughter’s life at every step. 
At clutch moments, these qualities 
have benefited not just me, not just 
our conference, but our entire country. 
Today, one such time especially stands 
out in my memory. 
It was a year and a half ago when 
COVID thrust our country into a 
health crisis and an economic crisis at 
the very same time. During the bipar-
tisan scramble that built a historic 
CARES Act, Jane, our Swiss Army 
knife, wound up as my liaison to the 
Small Business Committee. She poured 
herself into helping Senators set up, 
preserve, and protect the landmark 
Paycheck Protection Program that 
saved a huge, huge number of jobs and 
countless small businesses exactly like 
the ones she grew up watching her par-
ents manage. 
But while Jane’s commitment to her 
work has been peerless, her commit-
ment to her family is greater still. Her 
beloved husband Tom and her son 
Mitchell and her parents and grand-
mother need to see more of her than

September 30, 2021 
her bottomless Senate portfolio has 
often permitted. So while the whole in-
stitution will sorely miss her, we also 
join her in celebrating the new adven-
tures to come. 
To our incredibly competent budget 
expert, our cherished colleague, and 
one of the Senate’s most talented jazz 
and rock-and-roll singers, we say not 
just ‘‘farewell’’ and ‘‘good luck’’ but 
‘‘bravo’’ on a simply outstanding per-
formance. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
H.R. 5305 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
begin this morning with some good 
news: Today, the Senate will pass a 
continuing resolution that will elimi-
nate the possibility of a government 
shutdown tonight. The CR we are vot-
ing on will keep the government funded 
until December 3, provide funding to 
help process and resettle Afghan refu-
gees, and finally deliver on critical dis-
aster aid for Americans battered by the 
storms and wildfires this summer. 
As part of today’s agreement, we will 
hold a vote series starting at 10:30 this 
morning on three amendments offered 
by Senators COTTON, MARSHALL, and 
BRAUN. We will hold a vote on final 
passage soon thereafter, and I am con-
fident the House will approve this 
measure later this afternoon and send 
it to the President’s desk before fund-
ing runs out. 
This is a good outcome, one I am 
happy we are getting done. With so 
many things to take care of here in 
Washington, the last thing the Amer-
ican people need is for the government 
to grind to a halt. But, of course, we 
have more work to do. Just as our Re-
publican colleagues realize that a gov-
ernment shutdown would be cata-
strophic, they should realize that a de-
fault on the national debt would be 
even worse. I will have more to say on 
this later. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now on nomina-
tions, despite a week marked by Re-
publican obstruction, the Senate is 
making great progress on our responsi-
bility to confirm President Biden’s 
nominees to his administration. 
Last week, a handful of Members 
made a scene here on the Senate floor 
in a doomed effort to stymie a number 
of nominees critical to our national de-
fense. I am glad to say that, over the 
course of the week, we have success-
fully confirmed these individuals de-
spite these theatrics from that handful 
of Republicans Senators. 
This Chamber will not allow anyone 
to hijack the confirmation process to 
score political points and to prevent 
these 
nominations 
from 
being 
ap-
proved. It will not happen. We will 
move forward. It will take a little more 
time, but we will get it done. 
Today, the Senate will keep going. 
After passing the CR, we will turn to 
the nomination of Rohit Chopra to 
serve as the Director of the Consumer 
Financial 
Protection 
Bureau. 
Mr. 
Chopra is the right man to lead this 
Agency tasked with protecting Ameri-
cans from predatory financial institu-
tions. He is a veteran of the CFPB from 
the Obama years, where he specialized 
in protecting students from unscrupu-
lous practices of student loan pro-
viders. 
Under President Trump, who didn’t 
give a hoot about the average person, 
the CFPB spent more time protecting 
the likes of payday lenders and for- 
profit colleges than American con-
sumers. With Mr. Chopra’s confirma-
tion, the CFPB will return to fighting 
on the side of the American worker in-
stead of big financial institutions. I 
look 
forward 
to 
his 
confirmation 
today. 
After that, we will turn to the nomi-
nation of Tracy Stone-Manning to lead 
the Bureau of Land Management. Few 
Agencies are as important for pro-
tecting and promoting America’s pub-
lic lands. In the years to come, the 
BLM will play an even greater stra-
tegic role in our government’s effort to 
fight climate change. 
Ms. Stone-Manning is a familiar face 
here in the Senate. She served as a 
staffer for Senator TESTER before mov-
ing to Montana to work for then-Gov-
ernor Bullock. As head of Montana’s 
environmental agency, she earned the 
reputation not only as a skilled policy-
maker but also as an honest broker, 
one who commanded the respect of con-
servationists and ranchers alike. 
Of course, you would never guess that 
by listening to some of the histrionics 
coming from the other side. Unable to 
disqualify Ms. Stone-Manning on the 
merits, which is so obvious to just 
about anyone who studies it, some of 
our Republican colleagues have used 
her nomination to launch cheap, out- 
of-context attacks. Thankfully, no one 
is taking these attacks seriously. 
Because of her exceptional qualifica-
tions, Tracy Stone-Manning has broad 
support of the Democratic caucus to 
lead the BLM, and I expect her nomina-
tion to be approved later today. 
Finally, I am also pleased that today 
President Biden is announcing the 
nomination of another outstanding 
judge from my home State: Dale Ho to 
serve as district judge for the Southern 
District of New York. 
Like so many of President Biden’s ju-
dicial nominees, Mr. Ho is a prominent 
civil rights lawyer and voting rights 
expert. A graduate of Yale and Prince-
ton, a veteran of the NAACP and the 
ACLU, Mr. Ho would bring an impres-
sive resume to the judiciary. I am 
thrilled that President Biden has taken 
my advice to nominate Mr. Ho, and I 
look forward to working on his con-
firmation. 
In a more general note on this issue, 
I am proud that the Senate is not only 
increasing the demographic diversity 
on the bench—more women, more peo-
ple of color, and more individuals from 
immigrant families—but also its occu-
pational 
diversity 
as 
well—voting 
rights experts, civil rights lawyers, 
public defenders, and more. This is how 
we work to strengthen not only diver-
sity in our judiciary but the trust that 
it represent all Americans. 
DEBT LIMIT 
Madam President, finally, on the 
debt limit, just as our Republican col-
leagues realized a government shut-
down 
would 
be 
catastrophic, 
they 
should realize that a default on the na-
tional debt would be even worse. 
Throughout American history, the 
Federal Government has consistently 
paid its debt on time. The unbroken 
promise is what made the United 
States the leading economy in the 
world for so long, benefiting countless 
millions of families. So when we talk 
about extending the debt limit, that is 
what is at stake. 
All week long, Senate Democrats pre-
sented our Republican colleagues with 
reasonable proposals to prevent a de-
fault from happening. We offered to 
hold a simple majority vote so Demo-
crats could fix the debt ceiling our-
selves. They rejected that offer. 
We are not even asking Republicans 
to vote yes, even though we know they 
should, but, instead, just to get out of 
the way; just get out of the way, and 
let us keep the faith and credit in 
America’s finances intact. Unfortu-
nately, Republicans spent the week so-
lidifying themselves as the party of de-
fault; the party that says America 
doesn’t pay its bills; the party that 
would send our economy into unknown 
and dangerous territory. 
On 
Monday, 
Republicans 
unani-
mously blocked a measure that would 
have funded the government and raised 
the debt ceiling. 
On Tuesday, the Republican leader 
blocked the proposal to raise the debt 
ceiling with only Democratic votes— 
exactly what Republicans insisted they 
wanted from the start. 
By Wednesday, it was clear that Re-
publicans were committed not only to 
voting in favor of default but even pre-
venting Democrats from solving this 
risk crisis on our own. 
Every day that Republicans continue 
their cynical obstruction, they risk 
causing irreparable harm to the econ-
omy. The last time Republicans played 
games with the full faith and credit of 
the United States, our sovereign debt 
was downgraded. This time around, the 
consequences for American families 
could be far worse. 
Despite Republicans’ intransigence, 
the facts have not changed. We must 
raise the debt ceiling. We cannot allow 
America to default. 
Yesterday, the House approved legis-
lation providing for a clean debt limit 
extension until the end of 2022. At the 
appropriate time, I will move to pro-
ceed to its consideration, which could 
come as early as next week. 
By now, we are not asking Repub-
licans to vote with us to solve the debt 
limit crisis they have created. If they 
want to oppose this measure and bring

us closer to financial disaster, they can 
write their names in the history books 
as the Senators who let the country de-
fault for the first time ever. But Re-
publicans need to get out of the way so 
Senate Democrats can address the 
issue quickly and without needlessly 
endangering the stability of our econ-
omy. 
We cannot afford the risk of a drawn- 
out, unpredictable process sought by 
the minority, which could very well ac-
tually cause a default, no. The way to 
resolve this crisis is much more simple. 
Either Republicans snap out of their 
insane position and work with Demo-
crats or they get out of the way while 
we solve the problem ourselves. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the previously scheduled 
votes begin at 11:05 a.m. and that all 
provisions of the previous order remain 
in effect. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
H.R. 5305 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we 
will have before us a substitute amend-
ment identical to H.R. 5305, which we 
will be voting on today. H.R. 5305 is the 
House-passed 
continuing 
resolution, 
except that the provision raising the 
debt ceiling has been removed because 
Republicans continue to block raising 
the debt ceiling. 
But the stop-gap measure really 
keeps the government funded through 
December 3. It provides $28 billion to 
help States that have been ravaged by 
hurricanes and wildfires. It provides 
critical assistance to Afghan refugees 
who fled the Taliban in the wake of the 
U.S. 
withdrawal 
from 
Afghanistan. 
Many of those refugees have worked 
with American forces and helped us. So 
I urge all members to vote for it. 
But I agree with the majority leader 
that it is shameful we can’t reach an 
agreement today to raise the debt ceil-
ing and protect the full faith and credit 
of the United States. If Republicans 
don’t want to vote to protect the full 
faith and credit of the United States, if 
the Republicans don’t want to vote for 
the money that pays for the programs 
that they had supported under Donald 
Trump, well, then, stand out of the way 
and Democrats can raise the debt ceil-
ing. 
Over and over, the last few days, we 
heard from Members on the other side 
of the aisle speak about the importance 
of passing a continuing resolution that 
contained disaster relief to help hurri-
cane-ravaged States, like Louisiana 
and Texas. They are pleading for help. 
Well, we are about to pass a CR that 
provides that help. 
I have always taken the position that 
if there is a disaster in any State, that 
we should all come together to provide 
assistance because we are the United 
States of America; it is not just one 
State. Whether it is my State of 
Vermont or Texas or any other State, 
we can provide the assistance. 
But they may go home and say: Hey, 
we voted to get money, disaster relief 
for our hurricane-ravaged States. 
Somebody is going to say: Well, wait 
a minute, where does the money come 
from to help recover and build if the 
U.S. 
Treasury 
is 
literally 
out 
of 
money? 
In other words, they have a position 
where they can vote for something that 
would be popular back home, and it is 
kind of like ‘‘the check is in the mail.’’ 
We are not going to give you any 
money for it, but, boy, we are going to 
speak about how important it is to 
help. 
Many Senators here today want to 
provide a billion dollars to fund Israel’s 
so-called 
Iron 
Dome, 
even 
though 
Israel has not spent the money we have 
already given them. Well, we will pass 
a bill to do just that. But if there is no 
money in the U.S. Treasury to pay the 
bills, it is nothing but an empty prom-
ise to one of our closest allies. We are 
voting on a blank check. 
According to the Treasury Depart-
ment, we are going to reach the debt 
ceiling in 18 days. Now, I say that be-
cause we ought to know what we are 
not voting on. What we are not voting 
on—as the majority leader pointed out, 
we are not voting on the debt ceiling. 
We could say: Oh, we are helping hur-
ricane-ravaged areas; oh, we are mak-
ing others happy with things we vote 
for, but we are not voting for the 
money. 
If we don’t raise the debt ceiling, 
once that happens, we run out of 
money to pay our men and women in 
uniform. We all support our men and 
women in uniform. We are just not 
going to put in the money to pay them. 
We can’t send out Social Security 
checks. Find a Senator in this place 
that would say they are against Social 
Security. But to put the money in for 
it, they are not ready to do that. Just 
saying: Oh, we all support our veterans. 
Of course, we do. We are just not going 
to put the money in to support them. 
For the first time in history, the U.S. 
will default on its debt. The economy 
will take such a hit that it will take 
years to recover. Millions of people will 
be out of work. Bills will not be paid. 
Watch the stock market go down faster 
than we have ever seen and millions of 
Americans’ lifetime savings will be at 
risk. Oh, we are for all of those—we 
just—you are on your own. 
Now, the Republican Party is playing 
political games with U.S. economy and 
with people’s livelihoods, and it is 
shameful. Senator MCCONNELL said he 
would not provide a single Republican 
vote to raise the debt ceiling. It is in-
teresting because most of this debt was 
incurred under a Republican President 
and a Republican-controlled Senate. 
But as irresponsible as it is for the 
Republican leader to say we won’t vote 
to pay for the debt that we incur, we, 
on the Democratic side, are prepared to 
show what leadership looks like and do 
it all on our own. We are willing to 
pass this with Democratic votes. 
But the Republicans continue to fili-
buster. If we don’t resolve the debt 
issue in the coming days, make no mis-
take where the blame lies: squarely at 
the feet of the Senate Republicans. 
When we go back and say all these 
wonderful things we have done for you 
in the continuing resolution, but we 
are not going to pay for it—we need to 
pass the CR today, of course, to avert a 
government shutdown tomorrow. A 
government shutdown, as we know 
from those in the last administration, 
wastes billions, accomplishes nothing. 
But it is also essential not only to pass 
the continuing resolution, but to unite 
and pass the debt limit extension, or 
there is not going to be money in the 
Treasury—no money to pay for the 
funding of this bill for American fami-
lies, for the elderly, for our troops. 
Now, prior to the final passage, we 
will have a series of three amendment 
votes. With only 13 hours for the gov-
ernment set to shut down—13 hours 
and a few minutes—any one of these 
amendments could peril the continuing 
resolution. 
They 
are 
controversial. 
They could complicate House passage. 
So I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on all 
three amendments and an ‘‘aye’’ vote 
for final passage. 
Any one of those things in those 
three amendments, bring them up as 
legislation somewhere else, but don’t 
shut down the government because you 
didn’t get your political amendments.

stitute.)

September 30, 2021 
SEC. 4106. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This division shall take effect on Sep-
tember 29, 2023. 
Mr. LEAHY. We obviously have these 
amendments, so we will have them in 
order to be voted on. I call them up to 
have them all before us. 
I can assure you that the three 
amendments that I have referred to, I 
will strongly oppose them because, 
were they to pass, we would not be able 
to get the continuing resolution done, 
the government will be closed, billions 
of dollars goes out the window, and we 
would not have done our job. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I 
came down to the floor to talk about 
President Biden’s mishandling of Af-
ghanistan. 
Today, I want to talk about another 
situation the administration has mis-
handled and perhaps, more accurately, 
failed to handle; and that is the crisis 
at the southern border. 
I say ‘‘failed to handle’’ because, by 
and large, the Biden administration 
has completely failed to take any 
meaningful action in response to this 
crisis. Sure, they occasionally made 
half-hearted stabs at the problem—usu-
ally when the media starts noticing 
things like thousands of migrants and 
their children residing in a squalid ref-
ugee camp under a bridge in Del Rio, 
TX. Mostly, they seem content to ig-
nore it. 
More than 6 months into this crisis, 
there are no signs the President plans 
to travel to the border to get a look at 
the problem firsthand. In fact, it is not 
clear whether President Biden has ever 
visited the border at any point during 
his political career. 
The President seems to have adopted 
an ‘‘if I pretend the problem doesn’t 
exist, it will go away’’ attitude. It is 
kind of like earlier this year, when 
Biden administration officials refused 
to call the situation a crisis, despite 
overwhelming evidence border influx 
has reached crisis proportions. It is 
like they believed that if they didn’t 
use the word, they could somehow 
avoid the reality. 
Unfortunately for the administra-
tion, there is no way to avoid the fact 
we are facing a border crisis. 
Last month, the U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection encountered 208,887 
people attempting to cross our south-
ern border illegally, a 318-percent in-
crease from August of 2020. 
Madam President, let me repeat that. 
In August, Customs and Border Protec-
tion encountered 208,887 people at-
tempting to cross our southern border, 
a 318-percent increase from prior Au-
gust. 
For context, that number is bigger 
than the population of Sioux Falls, SD, 
the largest city in my home State—in 
a single month—in a single month. 
At this point, the situation at the 
border is beyond a crisis. It is com-
pletely out of control. The situation 
will soon deteriorate further with one 
outlet reporting yesterday that tens of 
thousands additional Haitian migrants 
are set to head to our southern border. 
Illegal immigration across the south-
ern border tends to slow down during 
the heat of the summer. Not under the 
Biden administration. Under the Biden 
administration, the numbers this sum-
mer just got worse. Encounters along 
the southern border in July were up 420 
percent from July of 2020—420 percent. 
Of course, these numbers only reflect 
individuals Customs and Border Pro-
tection has been able to apprehend. 
There are, undoubtedly, individuals 
who are successfully evading apprehen-
sion and illegally taking up residence 
in our country. 
Then there are the individuals being 
detained and released into the country 
with orders to appear at an immigra-
tion court. This so-called catch-and-re-
lease approach is notorious because the 
individuals released into the country 
often never show up to immigration 
courts as directed. In spite of this, the 
administration is using this strategy 
and is apparently employing it to deal 
with the surge of migrants from Haiti. 
Despite having committed to deporting 
these individuals, the administration is 
releasing thousands of Haitian immi-
grants into the United States. 
The situation at the border is a cri-
sis. It is a security crisis, it is a logis-
tics crisis, and it is a humanitarian cri-
sis. Attempting to cross the border ille-
gally is a dangerous enterprise. Mi-
grants face the risk of death, injury, 
heat exhaustion, and disease, to say 
nothing of the risk of exploitation from 
smugglers and traffickers, who are 
profiting to the tune of hundreds of 
millions of dollars by conveying people 
across the border illegally. 
By failing to stem the flow of illegal 
immigration, the President is perpet-
uating this humanitarian disaster, and 
Democrats in Congress are helping 
him. My colleagues across the aisle 
have been trying to add amnesty for il-
legal immigrants into the tax-and- 
spending spree that they are consid-
ering. That is a policy that is pretty 
much guaranteed to further encourage 
individuals to make the dangerous and 
illegal journey across our southern bor-
der. 
Most people are familiar with the ex-
pression ‘‘fiddling while Rome burns.’’ 
It is an expression I am forcibly re-
minded of when I consider the actions 
of my Democratic colleagues and the 
Biden administration on the crisis at 
the border. Our country is, as I have 
discussed, facing a massive security 
and humanitarian crisis at our south-
ern border. 
On top of that, we just completed a 
disastrous 
Afghanistan 
withdrawal 
that has put our country at greater 
risk from terrorists, damaged our 
standing among our allies, and con-
demned the Afghan people to Taliban 
tyranny. 
Meanwhile, on the economic front, 
we are facing a serious inflation prob-
lem, and it doesn’t look like it is going 
to go away anytime soon. Americans 
are seeing their purchasing power 
shrink as they face higher prices on ev-
erything from groceries to gas. The 
Democratic 
response? 
Essentially 
sticking their fingers in their ears and 
humming or checking their watches to 
see if the unpleasantness is over yet. 
If you were just going by the Demo-
crats’ legislative priorities, you would 
be forgiven for thinking that none of 
these problems I have discussed even 
exist. Rather than addressing our bor-
der crisis or our inflation problem, 
Democrats are, right now, attempting 
to tee up a massive—massive—reckless 
tax-and-spending spree to vastly ex-
pand the reach of government into 
Americans’ lives. Our border is in cri-
sis, our country is at risk, American 
families are struggling with inflation, 
and the Democrats’ top priority is ad-
vancing socialism. 
Not only does their bill fail to ad-
dress any of the major challenges I 
have outlined, it is pretty much guar-
anteed to make them worse. Dumping 
trillions of additional government dol-
lars into an economy already strug-
gling with inflation is pretty much 
guaranteed to send our already high in-
flation rate even higher. 
As I mentioned, the Democrats are 
frantically working to circumvent Sen-
ate rules and insert some type of am-
nesty into their spending bill, which 
will only aggravate the crisis at the 
border. Although, at this point, I am 
wondering if Democrats will even be 
able to pass their tax-and-spending 
spree. The Democratic Party is in dis-
array, and the story changes so often, I 
think reporters are starting to get 
whiplash. I certainly am. 
One minute, the Democratic leaders 
are united; the next minute, the Senate 
leader doesn’t know what the Speaker 
is doing. One minute, the House is 
going to consider the tax-and-spending 
spree and the infrastructure bill to-
gether; the next, it is going to consider 
them separately. Democratic leaders 
announce an agreement on a frame-
work for their tax-and-spending spree; 
their rank-and-file Members report 
they have never seen it. Their spending 
spree is going to cost $3.5 trillion. No. 
Wait. It is going to cost zero. 
Democratic progressives and Demo-
cratic moderates are at each other’s 
throats. The House Speaker is chewing 
out centrist Democrats, and Democrats 
can’t agree on a host of issues from 
Iron Dome funding, to prescription 
drug measures, to infrastructure. The 
Democratic Party is unraveling fast, 
and it is deeply unfortunate that 
Democrats can’t seem to rise to the 
challenges of governance. 
President Biden’s administration was 
supposedly going to usher in a new era

of domestic tranquility and inter-
national respect. The professionals, we 
were told, were back in charge. Well, 
instead, it looks like Democrats and 
the President are going to leave our 
country a lot worse off than they found 
it, burdened by tax hikes and govern-
ment spending—that is, if they can 
ever manage to agree on a bill—in 
greater danger from terrorism, and 
with a never-ending crisis at our south-
ern border. 
If Democrats don’t change their focus 
and get their act together, a weakened 
country is likely to be their legacy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yes-
terday afternoon, the Senate Parlia-
mentarian ruled that long overdue im-
migration reform could not be included 
in the budget reconciliation process. I 
respect 
the 
Parliamentarian 
very 
much, but I respectfully disagree. The 
pathway to citizenship has a substan-
tial 
and 
direct 
budgetary 
impact, 
which makes it appropriate to be in-
cluded in a reconciliation bill. 
The last measure which we put before 
the Parliamentarian literally was a 
date change. That was the sum and 
substance of the amendment—a date 
change that had a budgetary impact in 
it. We were not creating new categories 
of immigration. We were not creating 
any new laws other than the date 
change. 
I want to say to all of the Dreamers 
and immigrants and all of the mixed- 
status families who are desperately fol-
lowing the situation: We are not giving 
up, and you shouldn’t give up either. 
America needs you, and I will keep my 
promise to keep working on this as 
long as it is my honor to serve in the 
Senate. 
H.R. 5305 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, I can remember when ‘‘certainty’’ 
was the Republican refrain on tax cuts 
and the economy. They used to say 
businesses and families need certainty. 
That is what the Republicans used to 
say when they wanted to pass more tax 
cuts for wealthy people. American 
businesses couldn’t invest or hire new 
workers 
and 
American 
families 
couldn’t plan for their futures without 
certainty. We heard that repeatedly on 
the Republican side of the aisle. 
Now it is a radically different mes-
sage. Instead of preaching the gospel of 
certainty, as they used to, Senator 
MCCONNELL
and today’s Republicans 
are threatening to deliberately, cyni-
cally, recklessly push America toward 
an economic cataclysm. We are less 
than 3 weeks away from a default on 
our national debt—that has never hap-
pened in history, a default on our 
debt—and 14 hours away from a govern-
ment shutdown. 
Later today, the Senate is expected 
to vote on a clean continuing resolu-
tion. If it passes, we can keep the Fed-
eral Government functioning until De-
cember 3, and we obviously should do 
that in the midst of a pandemic and 
with all of the things that are threat-
ening America. We expect that the CR 
will also include emergency funding, as 
it should, to assist with the recovery 
from Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and 
the gulf coast, and with the wildfires in 
the Western States and to help Af-
ghans, who aided us in the longest war 
in history, to resettle in America. 
Even the threat of a government 
shutdown costs taxpayers money. It 
damages the economy, and it under-
mines confidence in America’s future. 
If reason and responsibility prevail, 
the continuing resolution will pass, 
and the threat of a government shut-
down will be off the table for now, but 
that CR will do nothing to resolve the 
far greater threat to our economy—the 
looming potential default on the na-
tional debt. 
The Democratic leader of the Senate, 
CHUCK SCHUMER of New York, came to 
the floor the day before yesterday, I be-
lieve it was, and said to the Republican 
leader: If you don’t want to cast any 
Republican votes to establish and rec-
ognize the debt ceiling, the Democrats 
will vote for it. Step out of the way. 
Let us take the responsibility for doing 
the right thing. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
objected. 
He 
wants it to happen, he wants the threat 
to be there, but it creates the uncer-
tainty which they used to decry in 
their Republican leadership days. This 
is a manufactured crisis ginned up by 
Republicans to score political points. 
The harm to the U.S. and global 
economies would be cataclysmic. Here 
in the United States, respected econo-
mists warn us that the results would 
trigger a painful recession—the oppo-
site of what we need at this moment in 
history—the loss of more than 6 mil-
lion American jobs—how can that be 
good for the Nation?—and 9 percent un-
employment. 
We would likely see a broad selloff in 
the markets, which would take a big 
bite out of Americans’ retirement sav-
ings. Interest rates could spike. Not 
only does that affect American con-
sumers and businesses, but it affects 
our government. We will be paying a 
higher interest rate. So taxes won’t be 
spent on highways; they will be given 
to banks and companies and countries 
that are buying our debt. For working 
families, higher interest rates would 
mean bigger monthly payments on 
their 
mortgages, 
car 
loans, 
credit 
cards. For the Federal Government, 
higher interest rates would result in 
larger deficits and even a larger na-
tional debt. 
Think about that. Republicans are 
threatening to default on America’s 
national debt because, they say, they 
are worried about deficits and debt, 
and defaulting on the national debt 
will make both worse. 
Because we have never been through 
a default, it is hard to know exactly 
which payments the government will 
have to stop immediately and which 
payments might continue for a while. I 
don’t want to sow seeds of fear across 
America, or panic, but we have got to 
be honest and realistic. If we don’t es-
tablish and recognize the national debt 
of this country, it will be the first time 
in history. 
Some of the payments that are at 
risk in my State of Illinois and my 
nearby State of Kentucky are obvious. 
More than 1.3 million families in Illi-
nois and more than 500,000 families in 
Kentucky could see their child tax 
credits delayed. Nearly 600,000 veterans 
in Illinois and nearly 300,000 veterans 
in Kentucky could see their benefits 
delayed. That includes disability pay-
ments, VA pensions, education bene-
fits, loan guarantees, and other bene-
fits that veterans have earned with 
their service and sacrifice. Seniors 
would be hurt. Almost 2.8 million sen-
iors in Illinois and more than a million 
in Kentucky would see their Social Se-
curity checks threatened. 
Defaulting on our national debt could 
trigger a global financial crisis. It 
would squander one of our Nation’s 
most valuable economic assets as trust 
by investors that America pays its bills 
and keeps its word would be at risk. 
The U.S. dollar could lose its valuable 
place as the world’s primary currency. 
That would be a gift to our competitors 
in China. 
American families and businesses are 
still struggling from financial devasta-
tion caused by the coronavirus. The 
crisis threatening America today is 
being manufactured right here in the 
Senate by politicians who believe, 
cynically, that it will help them politi-
cally to default on America’s debt. 
Haven’t the institutions of this great 
Nation suffered enough? 
Ten months ago, an angry man, en-
raged over losing an election, sum-
moned a mob to attack this Capitol 
Building on January 6 and tried to 
overturn the Presidential election. 
And now that former President’s 
party is refusing to do its part to avoid 
a default on our national debt. 
Let’s be clear about why Congress 
needs to address the debt limit. Ad-
dressing this debt limit allows Con-
gress to continue to borrow money to 
pay for expenses that have already 
been incurred. 
This measure that we are talking 
about, the acknowledgement of our 
debt ceiling, is to pay the debts of the 
Trump administration. The national 
debt of America increased by 36 percent 
under President Trump in one 4-year 
period. We are taking recognition of 
the fact that that money was spent and 
has to be paid for. 
Ninety-seven percent of the total 
Federal debt occurred before Joe Biden

September 30, 2021 
became President. This is debt that 
was built up under Presidents and con-
gressional majorities in both parties. 
As I said, $8 billion—nearly a third of 
the entire debt—was added under Don-
ald Trump, with the support of the 
same Republican Senators who will not 
acknowledge that that is now part of 
our responsibility. 
Now Senator MCCONNELL and his Re-
publican 
colleagues 
are 
playing 
a 
verbal shell game, claiming falsely 
that we need to address the debt limit 
to pay for future spending. That is not 
true, and they know it. 
If this Congress had not spent a 
penny since Joe Biden took office, we 
would still have to deal with the debt 
limit to pay for the Trump bills he left 
behind. 
Democrats have offered proposals 
twice this week. On Monday, Senator 
SCHUMER offered a proposal that dealt 
with the debt limit. It included a CR to 
avoid a government shutdown and pro-
vided emergency aid which is needed 
for the victims of Hurricane Ida, 
wildfires, and resettlement of Afghan 
refugees. The Republicans used the fili-
buster to stop it. 
On Tuesday, Leader SCHUMER offered 
a proposal to allow the Senate to ad-
dress the debt limit with just a major-
ity vote. Senator MCCONNELL objected. 
Not only are Republicans refusing to 
help pay the debt incurred under Presi-
dents of both parties, they are making 
it as difficult as possible for Democrats 
to address the debt limit in a respon-
sible way. 
Defaulting on this debt would be the 
ultimate dine-and-dash. It would be a 
grave, self-inflicted wound that would 
harm innocent Americans for decades. 
Our Republican colleagues used to 
preach the gospel of economic cer-
tainty. The only thing certain about 
defaulting on our national debt is that 
it would be ruinous to our economy, 
and it is a responsibility both parties 
should want to avoid. 
I yield the floor. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3833 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). Under the previous order, 
there will now be 2 minutes of debate, 
equally divided, prior to a vote in rela-
tion to the Cotton amendment, No. 
3833. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of this amendment. I think 
it is important that we pass it, and I 
hope my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle support it. 
As we all know, as a result of the 
rushed and chaotic evacuation from Af-
ghanistan, people were left behind, in-
cluding some American citizens and a 
lot of Afghans who had helped us. 
But because of the chaos, we also 
evacuated many Afghans who have no 
record of assisting us or our allies. In 
fact, we were told by the administra-
tion that the majority of the evacuees 
in the United States, called parolees, 
are neither U.S. citizens, green card 
holders, or SIV applicants who had 
helped us. 
This is a commonsense amendment 
to simply make sure those parolees are 
properly vetted like any other group of 
parolees or refugees would be. Part of 
that vetting, of course, comes from in-
dividuals applying for what is known 
as the REAL ID, a system designed to 
make identity documents more con-
sistent and secure. 
Remember, the REAL ID law came 
out of the 9/11 Commission. It was a 
key recommendation of that Commis-
sion. We supported it here. 
Our amendment does not stop Afghan 
parolees from getting driver’s licenses 
or qualifying for REAL ID cards after 
appropriate screening. It simply re-
quires the Afghan parolees to follow 
the same processes that other parolees 
must follow in order to be eligible. 
Unfortunately, the CR before us 
makes an exception to that normal, 
commonsense security process. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio’s time has expired. 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
think the Senator from Ohio is mis-
taken. In fact, this would—the Afghan 
refugees who are coming here are going 
to be properly vetted. 
In a September 2 letter led by Sen-
ator COTTON, he said that ‘‘[o]ur imme-
diate priority is the safety and well- 
being of American citizens, permanent 
residents, and allies who were left be-
hind in Afghanistan.’’ 
But it seems that that concern for 
our allies only extends so far for Sen-
ator COTTON and this amendment. As 
our Afghan allies are being brought 
into the United States on humani-
tarian parole, he wants to limit their 
ability to settle into a new life. 
We need to vote no on this amend-
ment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Cot-
ton Amendment short changes critical 
assistance provided to Afghan parolees 
that is included in the underlying bill 
and it should be defeated. 
It shortens the length of time that 
we provide refugee assistance to thou-
sands of Afghan men and women who 
fled to the U.S. to escape the wrath of 
the Taliban—financial assistance, med-
ical care, emergency housing, mental 
health care, job placement services, 
the things that they desperately need 
to begin their new lives in the U.S. For 
some, this would mean benefits for 
only a matter of months, and then they 
are on their own. This is not nearly 
sufficient for them to get on their feet 
in a new country. Especially when 
many of them came here with nothing. 
Many of these men and women were 
critical U.S. partners during the war in 
Afghanistan, putting their lives at risk 
along with our men and women in uni-
form. We cannot turn our backs on 
them now. 
The amendment also limits their 
ability to apply for a driver’s license. A 
driver’s license is vital to successful in-
tegration in this country—to securing 
a job, to getting an education, to start-
ing a small business. This is especially 
true outside of urban areas and with-
out public transit, where many are 
likely to resettle. 
This should not even be a debate. I 
urge a no vote on the Cotton Amend-
ment. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3833

via unconstitutional Executive actions 
that the administration recently ac-
knowledged they didn’t have authority 
to put in place. 
No precedent exists in American his-
tory for punishing private employers 
that don’t enforce government vaccina-
tion 
edicts. 
Astonishingly, 
House 
Democrats included fines of up to 
$700,000 
on 
businesses 
that 
have 
unvaccinated employees as a way to 
pay for their out-of-control spending. 
Make no mistake. This vaccine man-
date is not about public health or 
science. If it were, we would recognize 
natural immunity as a highly effective 
way to combat the virus. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, families 
across the country are frustrated, and 
so am I. 
People are doing everything they can 
to end this pandemic, only to see some 
Republicans trying to prolong it with 
bills like this. 
We are fighting a highly contagious 
virus. It has killed over 685,000 people 
in our country. 
And that that number is only going 
to keep going up if people don’t get 
vaccinated, and variants like Delta 
will continue to spread, undermine our 
economy, and take lives. 
We need to end this pandemic, and 
getting people vaccinated is one of the 
most important things we can do to ac-
complish that. 
So why would we pass an amendment 
that weakens one of our strongest tools 
to get people safely through this crisis? 
I urge all of my colleagues to stand 
with people across the country who 
have been following the public health 
guidance, and who are ready for this 
pandemic to an end, by voting against 
this 
dangerous, 
counterproductive 
amendment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

minutes of debate, equally divided,

Braun amendment No. 3832. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I left my 
business to run for Senate because I 
was fed up with business in DC as 
usual. Americans are fed up as well. 
I think the place is broken when it 
comes to our budgeting process. We 
don’t do them anymore. We are debat-
ing a funding bill for the fiscal year 
that ends today. That is how you end 
up $28 trillion in debt. 
Congress can agree on basically one 
thing: budgets, deficits, debt don’t 
matter anymore. Well, they do. Every 
business, every State, and local govern-
ment have to do them. Congress should 
as well. 
No budget, no pay is simple. If we do 
not fund the government by October 1, 
we don’t get a paycheck until we get it 
done. It is a popular bill because it 
works. 
In 2013—the only time we have done 
one on time in 20 years—it was in 
place. Many here voted for it, including 
the majority leader. 
Americans are watching. They are 
tired of the job we are doing. They de-
mand accountability. Vote for this 
amendment. It makes sense. Our pay is 
in the 94 percentile of income to boot.

Mr.

you

whatsoever being in a CR which has to

may make a great sound bite or polit-
ical ad, but it is not good policy. It is 
not a thoughtful solution to the many 
complicated reasons that we fail to 
enact budget resolutions or appropria-
tions bills precisely on October 1. 
We all have serious policy disagree-
ments that lead to inaction or delay. 
Let’s debate those policies. Threat-
ening to withhold pay or whatever has 
absolutely nothing to do with the 
structural issues, but it would do one 
thing. It would make sure that we had 
only multimillionaires in the House 
and Senate. It is a dangerous precedent 
and potentially corrosive influence of 
public policy. 
Let’s stop the political posturing. If 
you want this, do it as a freestanding 
bill, under regular order, by the Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee. The CR is not the 
place for it. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

make sure we could get a good con-
tinuing resolution passed, which we are 
about to do. I just want to thank ev-
erybody and urge—it will be a voice 
vote, but shout ‘‘yes’’ on this next 
vote. Thank you. 
I yield the floor, and I yield back the 
time on both sides. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3830 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment No. 3830. 
The amendment (No. 3830), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to. 
The amendment was ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the bill is consid-
ered read a third time. 
There will now be 2 minutes of de-
bate, equally divided, prior to the vote 
on passage of the bill, as amended. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me thank Senator LEAHY on the Ap-
propriations Committee, as well as 
Senator SHELBY
and all those who 
worked diligently and hard to put this 
continuing resolution together. 
This vote says we are keeping the 
government open. At this time—at any 
time, it is a very, very bad thing to let 
the government shut down but at this 
time in particular when there is so 
much going on in the country. And it is 
a glimmer of hope as we go through 
many, many other activities. 
I would say this: Just as the CR is so 
important and requires bipartisan co-
operation, I wish my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle saw the debt 
ceiling as equally important and equal-
ly requiring bipartisan cooperation. 
They don’t, and we are willing to move 
forward on debt ceiling ourselves. But 
for this moment, this is one of the larg-
er problems, the biggest problem that 
has faced us in the last while, making 
sure the government stays open, and 
now we can be sure it will. 
So I thank all of my colleagues who 
worked so hard on this issue. 
I yield back time on both sides. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON H.R. 5305 
The bill having been read the third 
time, the question is, Shall the bill 
pass? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 50, the nays are 50. 
The Senate being evenly divided, the 
Vice President votes in the affirma-
tive. 
The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, be-
fore you leave, I want you to know that 
sitting next to me is Emily Spain from 
Santa Barbara, CA, where I think you 
might have been married, who is leav-
ing today as my chief of staff. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Welcome. 
Welcome. It is a beautiful place. I did 
get married in Santa Barbara. 
Mr. CARPER. You are wonderful for 
coming to preside today and helping us 
to send her off. 
Now, if there is an extra box of Klee-
nex up there for me to use for my re-
marks, I would appreciate it. 
Godspeed. Godspeed. 
Madam President—soon to be Mr. 
President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Delaware is 
recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO EMILY SPAIN 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have 
already telegraphed my pitch here, but 
I rise today to thank from the bottom 
of my heart the woman who has spent 
nearly two decades serving in this in-
stitution, and luckily for me, nearly 13

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6811 
September 30, 2021 
of those years have been spent as a 
member of my team. 
Emily 
Spain 
has 
written 
many 
speeches like the one I am about to 
give, Mr. President, but today I have 
the privilege of giving a very special 
speech thanking Emily for her great 
service. 
Emily may have been born and raised 
in California, but she has become an 
honorary Delawarean, and we are so 
proud to have had the blessing of her 
service and her friendship. 
Anybody would be hard-pressed to 
find others who have been able to do all 
the things that Emily has done. She 
has helped to win campaigns, including 
a number of mine. 
She has worked in the House of Rep-
resentatives for her hometown Con-
gresswoman, Lois Capps, whom the 
Presiding Officer served with, I believe, 
in the House. 
She has helped to pass historic legis-
lation that improved the lives of mil-
lions of Americans, like the Affordable 
Care Act. When people ask me what I 
am proudest of that I have worked on 
in the U.S. Senate, I always say the ex-
tension of healthcare to millions of 
people who otherwise wouldn’t have it, 
through the Affordable Care Act. With-
out Emily’s support, I am not sure that 
it would have become law. 
She has served not only as our com-
munications director but also as our 
legislative director and as our chief of 
staff. For folks who are not familiar 
with Washington, DC, that may not 
sound like maybe a lot, but in this 
game, in this business, it is a hat trick. 
It is a hat trick. You don’t often find 
someone as talented or, frankly, as 
tireless as Emily Spain. 
Many of my colleagues know this 
about me, but I like to start my days 
off by going for a run or going to the 
YMCA in Wilmington for a workout, 
and then I head to the train station, 
the Biden Station, and jump on a train 
and come down here and come to work 
with all our colleagues. I am used to 
having a pretty full day of meetings 
and committee hearings and votes and 
events. And then almost every night, I 
go back to Union Station and climb on 
a train and take the train in the oppo-
site way, back to Biden Station in Wil-
mington. It is a full day every day. I 
enjoy it because I like to be busy, and 
I like to get things done. 
Well, let me just say, in terms of get-
ting things done, I have met my 
match—fortunately, I met her about 15 
years ago—because the person who al-
ways, without fail, demonstrates more 
energy in her small finger than I do in 
my whole body is Emily Spain. It is in-
credible. It is incredible. Her tenacity, 
her 
strength, 
her 
conviction—this 
woman is literally tireless and some-
how manages to get it all done and 
more. 
She has an incredibly demanding job 
managing a staff of nearly 50 people be-
tween our DC offices and my three of-
fices back in the State of Delaware. 
Dealing with the latest in Congress 
often requires, as the Presiding Officer 
knows, one’s attention 24/7 and espe-
cially of late. On top of all that, she is 
raising a young family and managing 
to give back to her community in ways 
big and small. Ask anyone who knows 
Emily—her energy is boundless, and 
you will never hear her complain— 
never hear her complain. She dives in 
headfirst to whatever task is before 
her, and she just gets things done. 
I know the Presiding Officer feels 
this way, but I love to be surrounded 
by people who are good at getting 
things done. I always like to be sur-
rounded by people who are smarter 
than me. That is not a high bar for me, 
but for others, it probably is. But she is 
smart as a whip—smart as a whip. 
I also consider myself a glass-half- 
full kind of person. My wife likes to 
say I am an eternal optimist, and 
Emily and I share that trait too. I 
think it is easy for people to come to 
Washington and, maybe after a couple 
years here, become cynical, maybe 
even jaded. That has never happened 
with her, even after all these years— 
not Emily. She always sees the best in 
other people. She always sees the po-
tential for what could be in a person or 
in a piece of legislation, and if a bill 
can be made better, Emily will give it 
all that she has to make it happen. 
If an intern in our office wants advice 
on how to succeed on Capitol Hill, 
Emily will take an hour out of her in-
credibly busy day to help that intern. 
If partisan politics are getting in the 
way of getting things done, Emily is 
not afraid to cross the aisle, make a 
connection, and get something over the 
finish line. 
There is a reason that, when I walk 
around the Capitol with Emily, she is 
the one people recognize and say hello 
to, and that is because, from staff to 
Senators alike, Emily has an incredible 
ability to connect with people from all 
walks of life. No matter how busy she 
may be, she always takes the time to 
really listen to others. She is a really 
good listener. My father used to say: 
God gives us one mouth and two ears; 
we should use them in that relation. 
And she is a great listener. 
Many people in this town will offer to 
help, but far fewer actually mean it. 
People say: If I can ever be of help, let 
me know. When Emily says that, you 
know she means it. She always follows 
through. No matter how much success 
she had throughout her career, no task 
was ever too small for her to take on. 
She is a team player in the best sense 
of the word, through and through. She 
is always willing to jump in and lend a 
hand to whoever might need it, wheth-
er that means negotiating an infra-
structure deal or helping to put binders 
together. 
The late Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg said: 
You can disagree without being disagree-
able. 
Emily is proof of that, living proof of 
that. 
She believes fiercely that climate 
change is the greatest challenge of our 
lifetime; that every American deserves 
quality, affordable healthcare; and that 
every child, no matter what their ZIP 
Code may be, should have clean air to 
breathe and clean water to drink. She 
has spent her time in Congress fight-
ing—fighting to advance those policies 
without fighting with others. 
She has a great deal of reverence for 
this institution and for her colleagues, 
no matter their political affiliation. 
She is respected and beloved by people 
on both sides of the aisle. That is why 
I say—sitting here for a number of 
minutes before we were brought back 
into session, I had the opportunity to 
get recognized and give these remarks. 
It is interesting how many people came 
up to her, Senators and staff alike, to 
say hello and to thank her and to wish 
her well. She treats people with re-
spect, and she earns their respect in re-
turn. 
Our country could use a lot more 
Emily Spains these days, and I believe 
she is an example to anyone—to any-
one—who may have hopes of having a 
career in public service and a career in 
political life as well. 
There is no doubt that Emily has had 
enormous professional success, but I 
know that her most important job has 
always been and I think probably al-
ways will be being a wonderful mom to 
Jack and Emma Spain. And the days 
they come to our office are some of the 
happiest days of the week. 
Over the last decade, Emily has spent 
a great deal of time in Delaware. She 
has gotten to know my family. My wife 
Martha and I have a couple sons of our 
own, Ben and Christopher. I have been 
lucky to get to know Emily’s husband 
Ken and have gotten a chance to know 
their children. They are wonderful chil-
dren, young children, just kids whom 
any mom or dad would be delighted to 
be able to call their own. Family is im-
portant to both Emily and to me. She 
has always gone out of her way to 
make 
sure 
that 
what 
we 
call 
Carpertown—that is the extended CAR-
PER team family—is a family-friendly 
place. It is always a good day when 
Jack Spain comes in and tells us about 
his latest baseball game, and we find 
Emma coloring in Emily’s office. 
At 
our 
annual 
CARPER
holiday 
Christmas party, there is now a table 
filled with gingerbread houses to deco-
rate and all kinds of arts and crafts, 
and that is because of Emily. She 
knows it is not enough to just say that 
we value family; she walks the walk. 
She makes sure that our policies re-
flect our priorities, and for that and 
many other things, I am very, very ap-
preciative. 
For folks who may not be all that fa-
miliar with the work or the role of 
chief of staff, Senate chief of staff, and 
a full-time mom, let me just tell you, 
neither one is easy. Put them together, 
and they are really hard. But no mat-
ter what the circumstances, she has 
risen to the challenge in both roles—in 
both roles—without fail. 
I just want to note that Emily has 
led our office under particularly dif-
ficult conditions and has done so with

grace and compassion. Her tenure in-
cluded, among other things, two im-
peachments; an attack on this very 
building on January 6 of this year; an 
unprecedented global pandemic, the 
worst in 100 years; and the worst econ-
omy since the Great Depression. 
There was no handbook for how to 
handle any of these things, let alone all 
of them at once. There was no guide to 
show her how to keep our office firing 
on all cylinders in remote settings so 
that we could keep our staff safe while 
also helping the people of Delaware 
when they needed that help the most. 
There was certainly no instruction 
manual to help her console our staff 
during an insurrection at this place of 
work. I know these were challenges 
that Emily never anticipated when she 
took on this role—none of us could 
have anticipated these challenges—but 
I am immensely grateful that she was 
the leader on our team during such tur-
bulent and trying times. 
You know, one of the glories of 
knowing someone like her is, she has 
had the compassion, as we have gone 
through this pandemic this year, to lit-
erally call just about everybody on our 
team in Delaware and our offices here, 
our three offices in Delaware and the 
folks who work here, including the 
members of the Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee, the Senate Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions that I have been privileged to 
help lead, and to make sure that they 
are doing OK, that they and their fami-
lies were doing OK as we go through 
this pandemic. That is the mark of a 
great and wonderful human being and a 
great leader. 
There was, again, no guide to show 
her how to keep our office firing on all 
cylinders in a remote setting so that 
we could keep our staff safe while also 
helping the people of Delaware with 
what they needed the most. And there 
was certainly no instruction manual to 
help her console the staff during the in-
surrection of this place of work, right 
here in this building. I know these were 
challenges Emily never anticipated 
when she took on this role, but I am 
immensely grateful that she is, again, 
the lead and one on our team during 
such critical, turbulent, and trying 
times. 
I will close with this. From the bot-
tom of my heart, I want to thank Jack 
and Emma—son and daughter of Ken 
and Emily Spain—for sharing your 
mom; and Ken for sharing your wife 
with all of us for these years. I know it 
has been a lot of early mornings and 
probably more late nights than you 
want to think about, and some unex-
pected things over too many weekends. 
But what we love to call Carpertown is 
better for your mom’s dedication, your 
wife’s dedication to this job and the 
people of Delaware, and I think the 
country is better off because of her 
dedication. 
I want to sincerely thank Emily for 
her service to the Senate, to the coun-
try, and to the people of Delaware. 
Sometimes it is hard to really know 
that we have made a difference, but I 
can assure Emily and her family that 
she has. She has left her mark on 513 
Hart. That is where we have been for 20 
years—all 20 years since I have come 
here—and made her mark on 515 Hart 
and on the First State, and she will be 
sorely missed. 
In the Navy, when people do an espe-
cially good job—I have had the privi-
lege of serving for, I guess, 23 years all 
in, plus midshipman before that. And 
we have a saying that we like to—when 
people do an extraordinary job, do a 
terrific job, we say: Bravo Zulu. Bravo 
Zulu. 
And I will say to Emily over and over 
again: Bravo Zulu. I probably say it 
just about every day of her service. But 
thank you for a remarkable, remark-
able congressional career that has been 
an inspiration to me and, I know, all of 
Delaware that you served. 
When people are ready—in the Navy, 
when they are ready to weigh anchor 
and sail off to their next chapter or 
their next adventure, we say these 
words: Fair winds and following seas. 
So I will say those today to Emily 
and her family, and I say those words 
with reluctance but also with joy that 
comes from having been able to know 
her, to work with her, and to get to 
know her and her family. 
We are lucky in life when we get the 
chance to work with people who push 
us to be the best versions of ourselves, 
who make our loads lighter, and who 
bring us people from all walks of life. 
Joy. Joy every day. 
And I am very lucky—we are very 
lucky in our team that Emily Spain 
has, in my case, let me work for her for 
all these years, and she has kept me on 
the payroll and, in no small way, 
helped make sure that I stay on the 
payroll here to be able to do all these 
things together. 
But Em, we will miss you, but we 
wish you and the Spain family nothing 
but the best. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 535 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, the 
time is now. We need a memorial to the 
fallen heroes of the Global War on Ter-
ror, and the memorial should be in its 
rightful place on the National Mall in 
Washington, DC. 
On Tuesday, I spoke with a group of 
nearly 30 Gold Star families who lost 
their loved ones during our Nation’s 
longest war. Their stories of heartache 
and sacrifice inspire me to continue 
fighting for this important memorial. 
The overwhelming theme on that call 
was this: the time is now to get the 
Global War on Terrorism Memorial 
built on our National Mall. 
And it is with that in mind that I 
come to the floor again to ask the Sen-
ate to join me in honoring our vet-
erans, our Gold Star families, and fall-
en heroes by supporting my bipartisan 
legislation, the Global War on Ter-
rorism Memorial Location Act. 
I believe our Nation has a responsi-
bility to properly honor and pay trib-
ute to our veterans, including those 
who have served in the longest conflict 
in the history of the United States. 
The Global War on Terrorism Memo-
rial belongs on our National Mall, in 
the same place as the memorials that 
honor the heroes of earlier conflicts, 
like Korea and Vietnam. 
This memorial, which has bipartisan 
support, will serve as a permanent re-
minder of the eternal gratitude of all of 
America. 
As a fellow veteran of the Global War 
on Terrorism and a friend and advocate 
for our Gold Star families, I firmly be-
lieve that placing this memorial any-
where but the National Mall is abso-
lutely unacceptable. 
We have an opportunity for biparti-
sanship right here with this bill. So 
let’s join together and show the coun-
try that the U.S. Senate will honor the 
sacrifice and properly memorialize the 
service of the brave men and women 
who fought and died to protect and de-
fend the Nation since the beginning of 
the Global War on Terror. It is the 
least we can do for those who have 
given so much. 
I ask you today to support my mis-
sion, to build a memorial to empower 
those who answered the call to serve in 
the Global War on Terror, who, for so 
long, protected us and allowed us to 
enjoy the freedoms that we have to 
this very day. 
This memorial is ready to go, so let’s 
get it built on our National Mall in 
Washington, DC, where it belongs. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 535 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed, and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, last week, 
Senator ERNST asked unanimous con-
sent to bypass the committee process 
and pass her bill. At the time, I com-
mitted to work with her and that we 
would schedule this bill for a vote at 
the next Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee legislative markup. 
That commitment remains. In fact, 
we are fulfilling it. In fact, just this 
morning, both of our staffs were on the 
National Mall walking through poten-
tial sites with the National Park Serv-
ice and representatives from the Foun-
dation to get a better understanding of 
the issues associated with the locations 
proposed in Senator ERNST’s bill. 
My goal is to get this memorial built 
as quickly as possible. I was the proud 
lead Democratic sponsor of this legisla-
tion to authorize construction of the 
National Global War on Terrorism Me-
morial 4 years ago and remain just as

supportive and committed to seeing 
the memorial built today as I was then. 
It is important that we commemo-
rate and honor the members of the 
Armed Forces who served on Active 
Duty and supported the Global War on 
Terrorism. The original legislation au-
thorizing construction of the Global 
War on Terrorism Memorial required 
that the memorial be located and de-
signed in accordance with the Com-
memorative Works Act. 
The Senator’s bill is now proposing 
to waive a key provision in that law. I 
am concerned that trying to legisla-
tively force a memorial into the Re-
serve area of the National Mall will re-
sult in a more contentious approval 
process that will take longer to get the 
memorial built than staying with the 
process that applies to all of our me-
morials. 
I restate my commitment to keep 
working with Senator ERNST and to 
schedule a vote on this bill at the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Commit-
tee’s next legislative business meeting 
so that committee members can weigh 
in, which is the process, on with what 
the appropriate policy should be. 
Again, I remain a very strong sup-
porter of the Global War on Terrorism 
Memorial, and I believe that all of our 
colleagues 
on 
the 
Republican 
and 
Democratic side feel the same. The Na-
tional Park Service should give it the 
highest priority, and they will, in find-
ing an appropriate site. 
But the memorial should be built fol-
lowing the same process—the same 
process—that applies to all of our me-
morials and commemorative works. I 
will continue to work with my friend 
and colleague from Iowa, but I must re-
spectfully object to the unanimous 
consent request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I just 
want to come forward and thank the 
Senator for the progress that is being 
made on the location for the Global 
War on Terrorism Memorial, and I will 
continue to pursue this. I think it is 
important to do that. I remain com-
mitted to the families of those who 
have fallen, as well as the many serv-
icemembers who have served across the 
spectrum in the Global War on Terror. 
I understand that many decades ago 
an act was put in place by Congress 
which limited activity on the National 
Mall, but understanding, since that 
time, we have seen many memorials 
and many monuments that have been 
placed on the Reserve on the National 
Mall. 
And so I am asking that, as Congress, 
we move forward quickly on this act. 
We have been working on this for a 
number of years. We need to move 
quickly and provide a time of healing 
for our Nation after we are closing the 
Global War on Terror. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. First of all, I want to 
thank the total commitment and dedi-
cation that my friend from my Iowa 
has; the same as, I think, all of us 
have. But on that, since 2003, when 
Congress acted about basically putting 
a moratorium on the Mall so the Mall 
would be preserved for all of us to 
enjoy, there were some that were still 
pending but were allowed to complete. 
There has not been any new approved 
since 2003. 
But we have a process, and I respect 
that, and I am going to work as hard as 
I can to make sure that that process is 
going to be honored and we go through 
it in our markup and everyone have 
input on it. And I think that is the 
proper way for us to proceed. 
And I appreciate the Senator work-
ing and understanding and working 
with us. Right now, we just have to 
continue to do what we are doing and 
let this process basically go forth as 
quickly as possible. That is my com-
mitment, and I will honor that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2843 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on HELP 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. 2843 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, this is out-
rageous. On September 27, there were 
over 80,000 new COVID–19 cases and 
over 1,000 COVID–19 deaths in our coun-
try; and yet, the next day, I had to 
come to the Senate floor to explain 
why undermining our efforts to end 
this pandemic would be reckless. And 
now, 2 days, with thousands more cases 
and deaths later, I have to do it again. 
And this is the second time today Re-
publicans have tried to do something 
like this. 
This virus has killed over 685,000 peo-
ple in our country. And if people do not 
get vaccinated, variants like Delta will 
continue to spread, undermine our 
economy, and take lives. 
So why in the world, for the second 
time in a week, do I have to come down 
here and explain to some of my Repub-
lican colleagues that weakening one of 
our strongest tools to fight this virus is 
a dangerous and deadly idea? 
Getting people vaccinated is one of 
the most important things we can do 
to stop COVID–19. And let’s be clear, 
immunization requirements are noth-
ing new in this country. So I hope we 
can stop with this political theater and 
focus on ending this pandemic, rebuild-
ing our economy, and keeping people 
alive. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, immuni-
zations are nothing new. To a degree, 
immunization requirements might not 
be new, but sweeping immunization 
mandates issued by a single individual 
within the Federal Government—that 
is, the President of the United States— 
are entirely new, entirely unprece-
dented, entirely unfounded, and dan-
gerous to our constitutional order, to 
say nothing of its tendency to discour-
age those who have been reluctant to 
get the vaccine from getting one. 
So I have returned to the Senate 
floor today, for the third time this 
week, to express my profound objec-
tions to that sweeping mandate—to 
President Biden’s sweeping, promised, 
and still inchoate vaccine mandate— 
and to offer legislation that this body 
could have passed right now; that it 
could have passed in order to protect 
countless Americans from this Federal 
intrusion. 
Now, look, the Federal Government 
has 
no 
legitimate 
role 
mandating 
COVID–19 vaccination for all Ameri-
cans. In fact, the President of the 
United States has acknowledged that. 
It doesn’t have that role. It doesn’t be-
long to this government. Yes, there 
have been vaccine mandates in the 
past. They have never been from the 
Federal Government, directed at the 
entire country. 
During a really difficult time, eco-
nomically and otherwise, in which in-
flation and the jobs market are causing 
a whole lot of businesses around the 
country to have to close their doors, 
President Biden has announced that he 
is going to enforce this mandate with a 
really hefty fine. Each incidence of a 
business not fulfilling the mandate 
could cost a business $14,000. President 
Biden, under the threat of massive pun-
ishment, is co-opting businesses to en-
force his mandate. They will have to 
police their workforce’s personal med-
ical decisions and order the receipt of a 
vaccination or, alternatively, be forced 
into bankruptcy. 
Now, some on the other side of the 
aisle think that the President’s punish-
ment doesn’t go far enough. In fact, in 
the reconciliation bill draft currently 
being circulated on the other end of the 
Capitol in the House of Representa-
tives, Democrats are pushing to in-
crease the fine to $70,000 per violation. 
Look, unvaccinated Americans are 
not the enemy; they are not the virus; 
and they are certainly not the enemy. 
Some are frontline doctors and nurses 
and other healthcare professionals who 
worked overtime throughout the pan-
demic, throughout the darkest of the 
dark hours of the pandemic, treating 
patients and saving lives. 
Others are workers whose industries 
were deemed essential and who showed 
up to work to ensure Americans kept 
having access to food and electricity 
and other essential items and services. 
Others still are simply neighbors, fam-
ily members, and other loved ones who

September 30, 2021 
have supported friends, families, and 
entire communities as Americans as a 
whole struggled through quarantines, 
shutdowns, financial difficulties, and 
social isolation. 
Let me reiterate, as I have said many 
times before and I will continue to re-
peat: I believe the vaccine’s develop-
ment is nothing short of a miracle. It 
is an answered prayer. I have been fully 
vaccinated, as has every member of my 
family, with my encouragement. But 
we certainly should not be forcing em-
ployers, through the Federal Govern-
ment, without congressional authoriza-
tion or constitutional authority, put-
ting employers in a position where 
they have to fire some of their most 
valuable and now increasingly hard-to- 
find workers. 
We shouldn’t be threatening business 
owners with closure simply because 
they don’t have any desire to police 
their workforce’s personal medical de-
cisions. That is not who we are as a 
country. I don’t care whether you are a 
Democrat or a Republican or an Inde-
pendent or a Libertarian; Americans, 
as a whole, don’t believe that that is 
who we are. We are not into that kind 
of draconian micromanagement associ-
ated with a nanny state, nor are we 
into the excessive accumulation of 
power in the hands of a few or, even 
worse, in the hands of one person. 
Many simply cannot incur the cost of 
this enforcement—certainly not in this 
economy. 
Additionally, 
this 
fine 
really 
amounts to a tax. It is government rev-
enue collected from the American peo-
ple, and the Constitution has a thing or 
two to say about how revenue bills 
must be enacted. The Constitution does 
not vest any taxing or, for that matter, 
any other revenue raising or fining au-
thorities in the President alone—no. 
This is a power that is reserved to the 
people’s representatives in Congress 
who are charged with precisely that re-
sponsibility. We have exclusively that 
authority, and that authority is not to 
be exercised by the President of the 
United States. 
It is no accident that the Founding 
Fathers, through the Constitution, put 
this power in the hands of those people 
occupying positions in the branch of 
government most accountable to the 
people at the most regular intervals 
and in no one else within our govern-
ment. 
President Biden’s mandate would im-
pose really significant costs on Ameri-
cans and on American businesses and 
on our Nation’s economy that is al-
ready in some really rough times. 
Look, 
it 
is 
unconstitutional. 
It 
hasn’t been passed by Congress. It is 
wrong for America. And that is why, 
today, as I did yesterday and the day 
before, I came here to offer a proposal 
that, if enacted, as we could have en-
acted it today, it would protect Ameri-
cans from some of the most disastrous 
effects of the mandate. 
While I believe the mandate will, I 
am quite certain, eventually be invali-
dated in court, it is going to take some 
time for us to get there because right 
now we don’t even have the mandate 
itself; we just have the threat of the 
mandate. And it is the imminent ap-
prehension of the mandate’s eventual 
issuance that is causing HR depart-
ments and general counsel’s offices in 
corporate America throughout this 
country today to scurry to try to get 
ahead of the curve, develop their own 
policy, so that they are in compliance 
as of day one when the mandate hits. 
But, in the meantime, there is noth-
ing to sue. There is no one to sue be-
cause there is no final Agency action. 
There is no order in place. There is just 
the threat of it. 
This, I fear, is a feature, not a bug, 
because by the time we actually have 
something on which to sue and by the 
time lawsuits are brought, by the time 
that litigation works its way to its 
natural conclusion—which, I believe, 
inevitably, culminates in a finding that 
it is invalid; it is unconstitutional; it is 
not warranted by law—months, if not 
years, will have elapsed, and a lot of 
the damage will be done. 
So, until that day—until that day I 
consider inevitable when a court rules 
that this is unlawful—these bills like 
the one that I have offered today can 
provide businesses and the American 
people with the certainty that they 
need to make their own decisions. 
My bill that I have offered up today, 
the No Taxation Without Congres-
sional Consent Act, would prohibit 
OSHA and other executive branch 
Agencies in the Federal Government 
from imposing fines, fees, or taxes with 
respect to these mandates. It would 
protect our constitutional order by re-
quiring that revenue measures be voted 
on by Congress, the branch of govern-
ment most accountable to the people 
and the only branch of government em-
powered to enact such policies. The 
other two branches cannot. 
As I mentioned yesterday, the people 
concerned about this mandate are ev-
eryday Americans. I have now heard 
from 158 Utahns who are at risk of los-
ing their jobs due to the mandate, and 
that number continues to grow every 
day. They are not our enemies; they 
are our neighbors. Many of them have 
been advised by board-certified doctors 
that they ought to not receive the vac-
cine. We shouldn’t be punishing them 
or forcing them into second-class sta-
tus. 
So today we have a choice. I hope 
that, at some point, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle will allow us 
to provide this certainty and peace of 
mind to those individuals and busi-
nesses at risk of suffering under the 
mandate. 
We can defend Congress’s role as the 
branch of government that determines 
how and from whom revenue is to be 
raised. Not only can we do that, but we 
have an obligation to do that. We have 
all sworn an oath to uphold and protect 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States, and that document 
doesn’t give the President this power. 
In fact, that document precludes, it 
prohibits the President from exercising 
this power in the absence of congres-
sional authorization, which we have 
not provided. 
So this bill, one of a dozen that I 
have submitted, could have passed this 
body today. I wish, for the sake of mil-
lions of concerned Americans, that it 
had, but regardless of this result today 
and of the objection that precluded it 
from passing the Senate today, I am 
going to continue to fight. I will keep 
coming back for as long as it takes in 
order to end this egregious and legally 
baseless and unconstitutional mandate. 
I find it interesting that my friend 
and colleague, the distinguished Sen-
ator from the State of Washington, re-
ferred to this as ‘‘outrageous,’’ as out-
rageous that we would be attempting 
to put in place protections for those 
Americans who are going to be victim-
ized by the vaccine, who are going to 
have to choose between, on the one 
hand, receiving a medical procedure 
that they don’t want and, on the other 
hand, being fired. Nobody should have 
to choose between submission and fi-
nancial ruin. They especially shouldn’t 
have to do that under the direction of 
an invalid, unconstitutional directive 
by the Federal Government. 
She also referred to what she de-
scribed as ‘‘our efforts,’’ ‘‘our efforts to 
end this pandemic.’’ This isn’t about 
whether we want to end the pandemic. 
There is not a single person—Demo-
crat, Republican, Independent—in this 
Chamber or in the other Chamber—I 
am not sure I know a single American 
anywhere who wouldn’t want to end 
this pandemic. This is not the pan-
demic. This is not going to end the 
pandemic. If anything, this will cause 
more people to be more reluctant to 
get the very vaccine that they are 
wanting to encourage others to pro-
vide. 
This is not about that. The minute 
we lose control of the government that 
is supposed to work for us, the minute 
we start to erode, willfully, even for 
those who might be convinced that it is 
good policy—and I would disagree with 
them on that. The minute we decide to 
give this power to the President of the 
United States and stand silently as he 
usurps authority that under article I, 
section 7, and article I, section 8, plain-
ly belongs only to Congress, to the ex-
tent we have any business operating in 
this area to begin with as a Federal 
Government, which we do not—then we 
have simultaneously undermined both 
the vertical protection that we call 
federalism and the horizontal protec-
tion we call separation of powers. 
Now, lest anyone might be left with 
the impression that this would be an 
esoteric or academic exercise or that 
that is not something that affects their 
freedom—there are those who would 
make that suggestion—they are sorely 
mistaken. You see, because anyone, 
anywhere can have a Bill of Rights. 
In fact, as the late Justice Antonin 
Scalia used to point out, any ‘‘tin horn

September 30, 2021 
dictator’’ around the world can have a 
Bill of Rights. And most of them do. 
Many of those Bills of Rights are scin-
tillating documents; they are glowing 
in terms of their expression of individ-
uality and the right of each human to 
exist and flourish. They will articulate 
a list of rights that is, in some cases, 
comparable to, if not even more protec-
tive of, individual liberty than our own 
Bill of Rights. 
Yet, as Justice Scalia continued, 
whether or not that Bill of Rights or 
any Bill of Rights is worth more than 
the paper that it is printed on ulti-
mately rests on whether there are pro-
tections in place that guard against 
the dangerous accumulation of power 
in the hands of the few. That is what 
makes that difference. 
So if we allow a President today to 
adopt whether you want to call it a tax 
or a fine or whatever revenue-raising 
tool that you choose to identify this as 
being, the President doesn’t have the 
power to impose that. That is a legisla-
tive function. 
Article 1, section 7 is very clear: You 
cannot enact legislation, including any 
legislation collecting revenue from the 
citizenry without passage in the House, 
passage in the Senate, and presentment 
to the President of the United States. 
He can’t do it alone. 
That is what this is about. This is 
about so much more than just this vac-
cine mandate. But this vaccine man-
date in and of itself is wrong. It is un-
constitutional. It is harmful, and it has 
a tendency to undermine the very in-
terest the President purports to be ad-
vancing. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today in having 
heard the Senator from Washington— 
the senior Senator from Washington, a 
Democrat leader—talk about some-
thing in this Senate Chamber, and she 
called it outrageous. 
Let me tell you what I find out-
rageous. Outrageous is the fact that 
people all across this country are fac-
ing crisis after crisis, all caused by the 
Democrats who are in charge of the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House. And on this day, the final day of 
the fiscal year, we are spending time 
on a nominee who is completely unfit 
for the job for which she has been nom-
inated. That is outrageous. 
But it has been one outrageous thing 
after another that I hear about in Wyo-
ming each weekend. In August, it was 
the chaotic abandoning of Afghanistan, 
resulting in the deaths of 13 American 
heroes; hundreds more individuals who 
lost their lives, or Afghani citizens— 
one of those brave soldiers, Rylee 
McCollum, a marine, age just 20, was 
from Wyoming. 
President Biden’s activities in Af-
ghanistan, they were outrageous. Be-
cause of his hasty retreat, the adminis-
tration has enraged—enraged—our al-
lies 
around 
the 
world 
and 
has 
emboldened our enemies at the same 
time. That is outrageous. 
You know what is happening at the 
southern border? 
And I would tell you, our weak immi-
gration policies that resulted in mil-
lions of illegal immigrants flooding 
into our country, that is outrageous. 
Across the West, a lack of fire miti-
gation and tree-thinning lacking has 
contributed to raging forest fires. 
These fires threaten lives, commu-
nities, and economies. 
And here in Congress, Democrats 
continue to create chaos. Runaway 
partisan spending has resulted in the 
biting pain of inflation and spiking 
costs for families all across the coun-
try when they go to the grocery store 
to buy food or go to the gas station and 
fill up. That is outrageous. 
So with all of these crises occurring 
across the Nation and the world, what 
is Leader SCHUMER
and the Senate 
Democrats choosing today as one of 
their top priority for the Nation? 
Well, it is confirming a nominee who 
has a history of having collaborated 
with ecoterrorists. 
We talk about the threat of terrorism 
around the world and the threat of ter-
rorism at home, and yet the Demo-
cratic leader is bringing to the floor 
today a nominee of the President of the 
United States and, apparently, en-
dorsed and agreed to by all of the 
Democrats, who has a history of 
ecoterrorism and has been involved in 
such. It is confirming a nominee who 
collaborated with ecoterrorists, lied to 
the U.S. Senate, wrote in favor of popu-
lation control as a problem related to 
the climate, and promoted the idea 
that homes built in the forest should 
be left to burn. This is outrageous. 
President Biden has nominated some-
one named Tracy Manning to serve as 
the Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management. Across the West, it is 
known as the BLM. 
Ms. Stone-Manning lied to the Sen-
ate—lied to this very Senate this year 
about her past association with an 
ecoterrorist cell that hammered hun-
dreds and hundreds of metal spikes— 
about 500 pounds of metal spikes—into 
trees in Idaho’s Clearwater National 
Forest. 
If these metal spikes are struck by a 
logger’s saw, the injuries to the logger 
can be fatal. And it is not just loggers 
who use saws; it is firefighters as well, 
going in to help fight fires. The same 
impact would occur to them. 
Ms. 
Stone-Manning 
anonymously 
sent a threatening letter to the U.S. 
Forest 
Service 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
ecoterrorists, of which she was one of 
the ring leaders, and then spent years 
covering up their crimes, as well as her 
own. 
The lead investigator on the case 
sent a letter to our committee, the En-
ergy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Com-
mittee. The lead investigator sent that 
letter to the committee to say that Ms. 
Stone-Manning was investigated and 
she refused to cooperate as a result of 
the crime. 
She had years to come forward, years 
to reveal the crimes, and she never did. 
It wasn’t until after she was caught 
and she was promised immunity and 
she received that immunity—it was 
only then that she agreed to testify. 
Earlier this year, Ms. Stone-Manning 
lied to the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee about her in-
volvement as an ecoterrorist and in 
ecoterrorism. When asked if she had 
ever done anything to support tree 
spiking in any forest, she replied ‘‘No.’’ 
This is blatantly false. Ms. Stone- 
Manning’s troubling record goes be-
yond lying and collaborating with 
ecoterrorists. She has written articles 
and a graduate thesis supporting the 
idea of human population control. 
And 1 year ago—not when she was a 
graduate student a number of decades 
ago, but 1 year ago—she tweeted an ar-
ticle that her husband had written, 
calling for homes built in the forest, al-
lowing them to burn during fires. She 
called the article a ‘‘clarion call.’’ 
Now, this is for the person nominated 
to be the head of the Bureau of Land 
Management—a clarion call. That is 
not part of the responsibilities and is 
the exact opposite of what we should 
expect from the head of the Bureau of 
Land Management. 
Tracy Stone-Manning is a dangerous 
choice to be put in charge of America’s 
public lands. And each and every Sen-
ator who votes to confirm her will be 
held personally responsible for that 
vote. Her nomination has been publicly 
opposed by the last two—the last two— 
BLM Directors, by outdoor organiza-
tions, by sportsman’s groups, pro-life 
organizations, by loggers, by the West-
ern States Sheriffs’ Association. The 
list goes on and on. 
And might I mention that one of 
those past two BLM Directors was 
President Obama’s BLM Director, who 
said she was unfit for the position to 
which President Biden had nominated 
her. 
She is the wrong choice for this job. 
She should never be confirmed, but 
that is exactly what Senate Democrats 
want to do today; and that is out-
rageous. 
At a time when America is facing 
mounting crises, Senate Democrats, 
each and every one, is determined to 
confirm a nominee who collaborated 
with ecoterrorists, lied to the U.S. Sen-
ate, and continues to hold very dan-
gerous views. 
I emphatically oppose her nomina-
tion. Every single Republican in the 
Senate opposes her nomination, and I 
urge courageous Democrats to stand up 
and do the same. 
I yield the floor.

TEZ MASTO). The Senator from West 
Virginia is recognized. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, my

this one different. We disagree.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6816 
September 30, 2021 
Stone-Manning to be the Director of 
the Bureau of Land Management. I do 
so after giving very, very, very careful 
consideration to this serious—and I 
mean serious—allegations that many 
of our colleagues have leveled against 
her. 
If there were any truth—a shred of 
truth—or 
evidence 
to 
support 
the 
charges, I wouldn’t be standing here; I 
couldn’t support her. But I have found 
no such evidence, and I have looked. 
Now, I have said this: Every one of 
us, we are entitled to our own opinion 
here. And we are not bashful to sharing 
that opinion with others. We are just 
not entitled to create our own facts to 
support our opinions. That is it. All I 
am asking for is look at the facts. That 
is all. 
The facts surrounding the spiking of 
the trees in the Clearwater National 
Forest in March of 1989 are well known. 
It is public. They are known because 
the facts were tried by a jury in a Fed-
eral district court in Spokane, WA, in 
June of 1993. 
I still believe we all believe the rule 
of law applies to all of us, and that is 
who we are. Trial by jury is how we 
find facts and discover the truth in this 
country. That is it. It is the keystone 
in our criminal justice system. 
A jury heard the evidence in the tree- 
spiking case. They weighed its credi-
bility and reached a unanimous verdict 
that four men spiked the trees. 
I repeat: Four help spiked the trees 
in the Clearwater National Forest. 
All four of them admitted that they 
spiked trees. All four of them admitted 
they spiked these trees. And each iden-
tified the other three as their accom-
plice. Each one identified the other. 
And you know what. Ms. Stone-Man-
ning was not one of them. None of the 
four said she was. 
Opponents of her nomination are now 
seeking to impute the guilt of the con-
fessed and convicted tree spikers to 
her. But Ms. Stone-Manning was never 
charged with tree spiking. She was 
never indicted or tried. There is no evi-
dence in the trial record that she par-
ticipated in the tree spiking. Her oppo-
nents claim that is because she was 
given immunity for her testimony. 
I have heard that, so I want to inves-
tigate that. 
But while the Federal prosecutor 
agreed 
not 
to 
use 
her 
testimony 
against her, she still could have been 
prosecuted if there was any other evi-
dence against her. If there was any evi-
dence against her, she could have been 
prosecuted. But there wasn’t. And no 
charges were ever brought against 
her—none. 
Finally, opponents of Ms. Stone- 
Manning’s nomination accused her of 
lying to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources, which is the com-
mittee that I do chair and the com-
mittee, Madam President, that you sit 
on with us so honorably. On her com-
mittee questionnaire, they said she lied 
to us. 
As the Chairman of that committee, 
I took that allegation seriously. I 
wanted to find out if she lied to us or 
not. 
Each nominee that comes to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources is asked whether he or she has 
ever been investigated, arrested, or 
charged with a violation of law. 
Ms. Stone-Manning responded, ‘‘No, I 
have never been arrested or charged 
and to my knowledge I have never been 
the target of such an investigation.’’ 
She then went on to disclose that she 
testified before a Federal grand jury as 
part of a tree-spiking investigation in 
1989, and later testified at the tree- 
spiking trial. This allegation seems to 
be that her response was false and mis-
leading because she was subpoenaed, 
because she was asked to come and tes-
tify and had been required to give fin-
gerprints and hair samples to the grand 
jury investigating the tree spiking in 
1989. 
Being required to testify or give 
physical evidence to a grand jury does 
not make someone the target of a 
grand 
jury 
investigation. 
It 
just 
doesn’t. 
Again, I go back to the rule of law, 
which is unique in this world today 
that we are still able to treat every-
body as innocent until proven guilty. 
And there is no evidence, and she was 
not involved. 
The Justice Department defines a 
‘‘target’’ as someone the grand jury is 
considering indicting. That is the tar-
get: They are considering to go after 
you. 
The Federal prosecutor in the case 
asked the Forest Service’s criminal in-
vestigator—they asked the criminal in-
vestigator whether the investigation in 
1989 had identified possibly anyone as a 
subject in the investigation. The For-
est Service investigator replied under 
oath—I repeat: under oath—no; no, it 
didn’t happen. 
She could not have been a target of 
an investigation that had not identi-
fied her or anyone else as a subject. 
Her response is further corroborated by 
recent comments in the press made by 
the former Assistant United States At-
torney who prosecuted this trial. 
You 
being 
a 
prosecutor, 
Madam 
President, understands. 
They 
prosecuted 
the 
tree-spiking 
case. This is the person who did that, 
who confirmed—he confirmed that Ms. 
Stone-Manning was not a target of the 
investigation in 1993. He confirmed 
that. 
In sum, I am unable to find any cred-
ible evidence in the exhaustive trial 
record of the tree-spiking case that 
supports the allegations levied against 
Ms. Stone-Manning. What I find in-
stead 
in 
the 
committee’s 
hearing 
record on her nomination is compelling 
evidence that Ms. Stone-Manning has 
built a solid reputation over the past 
three decades as a dedicated public 
servant and someone who has worked 
with one of our colleagues, a dear 
friend of ours from Montana, who is 
about to say what he believes in his 
heart, and as he knows, as that per-
son’s credibility. 
As a problem-solver, she has been and 
is a consensus-builder. She faithfully 
served Senator TESTER for 5 years in a 
position of trust and responsibility on 
his staff. She went on to serve Gov-
ernor Bullock of Montana for 2 years as 
director of Montana’s Department of 
Environmental Quality and 2 more as 
Governor Bullock’s chief of staff. That 
is the evidence on which I will base my 
vote to support her, and I would en-
courage every one of my colleagues to 
do the same. 
This is a person who basically has 
given herself to public service. This is 
a person, as a youth, basically in her 
compassion—all 
of 
the 
things 
she 
might have believed does not make her 
guilty. This is a person who basically 
deserves an opportunity to be able to 
serve all of us in America with her 
knowledge, her desire, and her abso-
lute, unwavering dedication to the out-
doors and everything that we hold near 
and dear. 
I just want to say that we are not 
here to prosecute people. That is not 
our job. We are not here to pass judg-
ment, basically, once judgment has al-
ready passed and basically regurgitate 
something that is not credible. So I say 
again: You are truly entitled to your 
own opinion. You really are. But before 
you pass judgment, look at the facts. It 
could be you. It could be me. That is 
not going to happen. 
So with that, I urge my friends, I 
urge all of them to please—John 
Adams, the first person to preside in 
the Senate, said: 
Facts are stubborn things; and whatever 
may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the 
dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the 
state of facts and evidence. 
They cannot. So let us put our par-
tisan passions aside. Put them aside 
and look at the facts. Let’s vote to con-
firm Ms. Stone-Manning’s nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, for 
Senator TOOMEY, I won’t be long be-
cause it doesn’t take long to tell the 
truth. 
I am here to support Tracy Stone- 
Manning as next Director of the BLM. 
Why? Because she understands the 
value of public lands. She understands 
public lands need to be managed and 
need to be managed in a way so they 
can stay in public hands. She under-
stands that the way you get things 
done is, be collaborative, bring people 
together, and talk issues out. That is 
Tracy Stone-Manning. 
I often wonder on the Senate floor, if 
you tell a lie enough times, if it be-
comes the truth. The chairman of the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee has laid out the facts. And the 
truth is, Tracy Stone-Manning did 
nothing wrong. In fact, the people who 
went to jail went to jail because of 
Tracy Stone-Manning. 
But that aside, character assassina-
tion isn’t something we should put up 
with in this body. God only knows, if

we look back into the past of every-
body who serves here, what we might 
find. 
But I am here to tell you, to listen to 
the Senator from Wyoming stand up 
and say: We are going to hold every 
Democrat accountable—you are damn 
right. Hold me accountable for Tracy 
Stone-Manning. I worked with her. I 
know what she does. I know she can get 
the job done. She can bring people to-
gether of all political ilks, and she can 
do what is necessary for the American 
people—in this case, with our public 
lands. 
I am going to point out one thing 
that Tracy Stone-Manning did that 
was wrong. She actually agreed to be 
Governor Bullock’s chief of staff. If 
somebody wants to go into the inves-
tigation and find out what has hap-
pened over the last 3 years with the 
Governor running against a sitting 
Senator in this body and her being the 
Governor’s chief of staff, you will find 
out why folks stand up and make stuff 
up about Tracy Stone-Manning because 
the facts don’t back up what they are 
saying. 
Yes. Listen to it again. If you are out 
there, the folks who have come to the 
floor on the Republican side of the 
aisle and bashed Tracy Stone-Man-
ning—the facts don’t back up what the 
claims are, and the character assas-
sination is not something you should 
be proud of. Ye who throws stones 
ought to be very, very careful. 
With that, I want to say this: Tracy 
Stone-Manning is not new to this proc-
ess. She has been a leader. She is some-
body who knows how to bring people 
together. She is somebody who has uti-
lized our public lands. She is somebody 
who knows how valuable these public 
lands are. She is somebody who will do 
a great job as the head of the BLM. 
I encourage any of the Senators on 
the other side of the aisle to take up 
any other claims with me, not her. I 
would love to answer them. 
I encourage this body to vote for the 
confirmation of Tracy Stone-Manning 
because it is the right thing to do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF ROHIT CHOPRA 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
rise to oppose the nomination of FTC 
Commissioner Rohit Chopra to be the 
CFPB Director. 
In the Banking Committee, every Re-
publican voted against him, and on the 
Senate floor, Republicans have uni-
formly voted against discharging his 
nomination from the committee. There 
is a reason for that. I think my col-
leagues have the same grave concern 
that I have that Commissioner Chopra 
would return the CFPB to the lawless, 
overreaching, highly politicized Agen-
cy that it was during the Obama ad-
ministration when he was there. 
CFPB, as you will recall, was created 
by our Democratic colleagues through 
the Dodd-Frank Act, and it was argu-
ably the most unaccountable Agency in 
the history of the U.S. Federal Govern-
ment. Think about it. It is an Agency 
with a single Director who, until re-
cently, even the President of the 
United States was unconstitutionally 
forbidden from firing. 
This Agency is not accountable to 
Congress through the appropriations 
process the way most Agencies are. 
Most rely on appropriations from Con-
gress for their funding. That is part of 
our power of the purse strings. Not 
with the CFPB. It simply draws vir-
tually unlimited funding at its discre-
tion from the Federal Reserve, whether 
Congress likes it or not. 
Now, during the Obama administra-
tion, the CFPB systematically pursued 
an activist, anti-business agenda. It 
limited consumer choice, it drove up 
the cost of credit for consumers, and it 
certainly unfairly burdened employers 
with overregulation. 
CFPB repeatedly engaged in over-
reach and abuse of its authority. Just 
one example: Instead of clearly laying 
out the rules of the road through a 
transparent 
regulatory 
process, 
it 
would invent rules on its own by 
springing lawsuits on the financial in-
stitutions that had no way of knowing 
that they were engaged in anything 
that the CFPB objected to because 
there was no rule. It was just rule-
making by enforcement. The DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals, quite rightly, 
held that this approach violates the 
fundamental bedrock principle of due 
process. 
But that is not all. Commissioner 
Chopra helped set up the CFPB, and 
then he served as a very high-ranking 
official there during the Obama admin-
istration. In that role, it has been 
widely acknowledged that he had a 
hostile relationship with lenders. He 
used ‘‘name and shame’’ tactics to 
pressure them. In one case, he took the 
‘‘shoot first; aim second’’ approach to 
the facts by posting online inaccurate 
allegations about credit unions, which 
the CFPB then later had to retract. 
At the FTC, Commissioner Chopra 
has continued his aggressive anti-busi-
ness stances, and he has continued to 
take a ‘‘shoot first; aim later’’ ap-
proach to the facts in order to advance 
his agenda. In one recent case, three of 
his fellow Commissioners publicly re-
buked Commissioner Chopra for ‘‘his 
disregard of the facts and the law, for 
making misleading claims, and for re-
lying on false assertions.’’ 
During this whole nomination proc-
ess, while Commissioner Chopra is 
under consideration to lead the CFPB, 
he has done very little to alleviate 
these concerns. 
I asked him a request for the record. 
Given its history, given the actions 
that have been overturned by courts, 
was there a single CFPB enforcement 
action that Mr. Chopra believed was 
too burdensome or was too punitive? 
He couldn’t identify a single one. 
In addition, Commissioner Chopra fa-
vors unaccountable regulators with 
vast powers. He actually in writing 
proposed this superagency that would 
regulate politicians and think tanks 
and nonprofits. At his nomination 
hearing, Commissioner Chopra once 
again defended the CFPB’s completely 
unaccountable structure. 
All this raises concerns about how he 
would wield power at the CFPB. Re-
member, at the CFPB, he would not be 
accountable to Congress in any mean-
ingful way, certainly not through the 
appropriations process, and since the 
CFPB is a single Director Agency, 
there would be no other Commissioners 
to restrain him. 
Commissioner Chopra has also shown 
a complete disregard already for con-
gressional oversight. According to mul-
tiple press reports, the Biden adminis-
tration’s political leadership at the 
CFPB has been taking unusual and pos-
sibly unlawful actions to push out top- 
level career, nonpolitical civil servants 
at the CFPB in order to fill those civil 
service positions with handpicked ac-
tivists who will support the Biden 
agenda. Now, the implication has been 
that this was done in preparation for 
Commissioner Chopra taking over as 
the Director. 
These were just allegations, but 
there were several of them. There was 
some credibility to them. So I sent 
Commissioner Chopra a letter simply 
asking in a straightforward way wheth-
er he was aware of or whether he had 
been involved in any efforts to dismiss 
these career civil servants at the 
CFPB. It has been over 100 days since I 
asked 
him 
these 
simple, 
straight-
forward questions, and he has refused 
to provide any response to me. 
His refusal to respond to my over-
sight requests—I am the ranking mem-
ber of the committee that has jurisdic-
tion over the organization he is meant 
to lead. This refusal to respond to a 
simple oversight request is completely 
unacceptable from a nominee, and it 
leaves very little doubt how he will 
treat congressional oversight if he is 
confirmed. 
As all of the Republicans on the 
Banking Committee have stated, ‘‘In 
our view, this should disqualify [him] 
from consideration as CFPB Director.’’ 
It is clear to me that Commissioner 
Chopra would very likely return the 
CFPB to the rogue, unaccountable, 
anti-business Agency it was during the 
Obama administration. We have every 
reason to believe he would continue to 
disregard 
legitimate 
congressional 
oversight requests. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting against his confirmation. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Ohio.

colleagues to support Rohit Chopra to 
serve as the next Director of the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
I have seen the good work they used 
to do. They used to have an Ohio Direc-
tor. The first Director there was Rich-
ard Cordray, a friend of mine, some-
body who stood up for consumers pret-
ty much every day of his work life. 
Rohit Chopra will become the CFPB 
Director at a time when far too many 
Americans feel that the system is 
rigged against them. You hear reports 
about billionaires not paying taxes. 
You hear these reports about record 
profits on Wall Street. You see the in-
fluence. Just check down the hall. 
Look down the hall. You can see the 
influence in the minority leader’s of-
fice, Senator MCCONNELL. Lobbyists 
are going in and out, always getting 
their way. When a Republican freight 
train goes down the railbed full of tax 
cuts, you know it never stops. It is al-
ways about helping those in charge get 
wealthier. 
As the CFPB Director, Rohit Chopra 
will be here when people feel like no 
matter how hard they work, they don’t 
get a fair shot in this country. His job 
will be on the side of the public. His job 
will be on the side of the workers. 
I know the Presiding Officer sees this 
job as I do—as putting workers at the 
center of our country, at the center of 
our economy, at the center of our work 
here. The Senator from Georgia sees 
the country in the same way: putting 
workers at the center of our agenda. 
That has not happened until we had 
this new President. Now, with Rohit 
Chopra, we have the chance to turn 
this around. 
The public has watched the largest 
corporations amass enormous power 
and use it to gain access and influence 
in this town to write the rules in their 
favor. Again, I won’t open the door to 
show you again, but if you look down 
that hall, you will see the people going 
in and out of the Republican leader’s 
office. They are always gaining access, 
always gaining influence, always writ-
ing the rules in their favor. 
So it is not surprising that most peo-
ple don’t believe there is anyone on 
their side, fighting for them in the Fed-
eral Government, but we know that is 
not true. That is why I know Rohit 
Chopra will prove them wrong, and he 
will fight for all of those who feel like 
they have been left on their own. 
Even before the pandemic, hard work 
wasn’t paying off. We all know that 
productivity has gone up in this coun-
try in the last many years; we know 
executive 
compensation 
has 
sky-
rocketed; and we know the stock mar-
ket has gone up. But do you know what 
we also know and what people feel 
every day? They feel like their wages 
have been stagnant. They feel like they 
are working harder and harder in Sa-
vannah or in Columbus, GA, or in Cin-
cinnati or Columbus, OH. They know 
they are working harder and harder 
every day, and they are simply not get-
ting ahead. They feel that they have 
been left on their own. 
Productivity is up, and wages have 
stagnated. Meanwhile, we know the 
cost of housing, the cost of childcare, 
the cost of higher ed, the cost of pre-
scription drugs—they all go up—and 40 
percent of Americans aren’t able to 
come up with $400 in an emergency. Be-
fore the pandemic, one-quarter of rent-
ers paid more than half their income in 
rent. You know what happens there. If 
you are paying half your income in 
rent and your car breaks down or your 
daughter gets sick or you miss a couple 
days of work from a workplace injury, 
your life changes. It goes upside down, 
and you can get evicted. 
Then the coronavirus hit, and mil-
lions of workers who were one emer-
gency away from draining their savings 
turned to a payday lender as they faced 
emergencies all at once. Millions of 
homeowners now have fallen behind in 
their mortgages and are at risk of fore-
closure—one in six Latino homeowners, 
one in five African-American home-
owners. 
Through it all, we have seen COVID- 
related scams emerge—scams that use 
a global pandemic as a means to cheat 
their fellow Americans. I mean, there 
is always somebody out there. Most of 
us aren’t that way. Most of us in the 
Senate and most of us in this country 
aren’t that way, but there is always 
somebody out there who will scam 
their fellow Americans. As a result, 
half a million Americans—that is a lot 
of people—reached out to the CFPB 
last year, seeking help. That is 54 per-
cent more than in 2019. Record num-
bers of consumers complained about er-
rors in their credit reports or harass-
ment by debt collectors. Those Ameri-
cans need someone willing to stand up 
to the biggest banks and to stand up to 
the most powerful corporations and 
fight for them. 
Rohit Chopra has the expertise and 
the track record to do that, and he will 
be America’s voice and America’s advo-
cate. He has a deep understanding of fi-
nancial markets, a strong record of 
protecting consumers and workers and 
small businesses, promoting competi-
tive markets, and holding bad actors 
accountable. 
In 2018, this body, this Senate, voted 
unanimously—unanimously—that is all 
of us—to confirm Rohit Chopra as an 
FTC Commissioner. They voted unani-
mously. In the Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs Committee—it used to be 
just called the Banking Committee be-
cause it was all about Wall Street; now 
the word ‘‘Housing’’ is in capital let-
ters in that committee. In that com-
mittee a few weeks ago, all 12 Repub-
licans voted against Rohit Chopra. Ev-
erybody here voted to confirm him 
when he was to go to the FTC. I don’t 
know if any Republicans in this body 
are going to vote for him now. It is 
really kind of shocking as he has 
worked with Members of both parties 
on a wide array of issues that are im-
portant to American consumers. 
As Commissioner, he worked with 
Democratic and Republican State at-
torneys general to protect American 
small businesses and consumers from 
foreign goods that were flooding the 
market with fake ‘‘Made in the USA’’ 
labels. 
I worked on this issue a lot. My col-
league Senator PORTMAN from Ohio—he 
and I worked together to strengthen, in 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 
‘‘Buy American’’ provisions—stronger 
than they have ever been—so that we 
won’t see a project like the Bay Bridge 
in 
California, 
Northern 
California, 
made entirely with steel produced by 
Chinese companies—all part of the Chi-
nese Communist Party. We are not 
going to see that again. We are going 
to see what ‘‘Made in the USA’’ means. 
Mr. Chopra’s job, in part—something 
that his predecessor didn’t do—will en-
force ‘‘Made in the USA.’’ If a company 
puts ‘‘Made in the USA’’ on a label, 
they should hear from the government. 
You just can’t commit that kind of 
fraud. In my State, Ohioans look for 
‘‘Made in the USA’’ because they want 
their dollars to support our economy. 
They know it also means a quality 
product, and it means made by Amer-
ican workers. 
He has led the FTC’s recent crack-
down on Big Tech. Americans across 
the political spectrum were concerned 
about these huge tech corporations 
that seemed to get bigger and bigger 
and to control more and more of their 
lives. 
Mr. Chopra authorized the Agency’s 
current lawsuit against Facebook. This 
is what he did in the last job he was in 
when he got unanimous support in this 
body for confirmation. 
He stood up for Amazon drivers when 
the company stole more than $60 mil-
lion. Imagine Amazon, as maybe the 
most successful corporation—certainly, 
one of the largest corporations in the 
world—stole $60 million of tips of work-
ers making $9, $10, $11, $12 an hour, and 
they are not getting away with it. I 
mean, maybe they got away with it be-
fore, but they didn’t get away with it 
because Rohit Chopra was there. 
Banks aren’t going to get away with 
that kind of stuff. Payday lenders 
won’t get away with that kind of stuff. 
All kinds of people who try to defraud 
American 
consumers—they 
are 
not 
going to get away with this because 
Rohit Chopra is going to be the cop on 
the beat. 
During his prior time, when he 
worked with Richard Cordray at the 
CFPB, he served as the Agency’s first 
student loan ombudsman. He looked 
out for students in the $1.7 trillion stu-
dent loan market—$1.7 trillion. That is 
1.7 thousand billion, this $1.7 trillion 
student loan market. He worked with 
State attorneys general of both parties 
to bring enforcement actions against 
scammers who preyed on students who 
were drowning in student loan debt. 
I see the pages on both sides, sitting 
here on the steps. Many of them are 
going to school in the next couple of 
years or are going to college. Many of 
them will take student loans. Many of

them may be preyed on by some of 
these scammers. I am guessing every 
one of these pages here, whether they 
are Republicans or Democrats, whether 
sponsored by CHUCK SCHUMER or MITCH 
MCCONNELL or me or ROB PORTMAN—I 
am guessing every one of you would 
vote for the confirmation if you could 
vote. Sorry. You are not even old 
enough to vote yet, but if you could, 
you would vote for Rohit Chopra be-
cause he is going to protect you. He is 
going to protect you when people try 
to scam you and your student loans. 
His commitment to protecting serv-
icemembers has been particularly im-
portant. He uncovered a predatory 
lending scheme. He was able to return 
more than $60 million to them and 
their families. Think about that. Peo-
ple are trying to scam our servicemem-
bers. The wife is away, serving our 
country, and the husband is home and 
they try to scam the husband, the hus-
band who worries about his wife every 
day overseas—these predatory lenders 
and others. That is why you need Rohit 
Chopra there to protect them. 
He has earned the endorsement of a 
bipartisan group of State attorneys 
general. He is supported by a broad co-
alition of 150 consumer groups, civil 
rights groups, labor groups, public in-
terest groups, and small business orga-
nizations. They know, like I do, that, 
with Mr. Chopra leading the CFPB, 
Americans can be confident they will 
have someone looking out for them. 
Corporations, big banks, payday lend-
ers—they all have high-priced lobby-
ists. You see them going in and out of 
Senator MCCONNELL’s office. We know 
that. They have an outsized voice in 
this town. Most people don’t have lob-
byists. 
I just introduced a bill to help those 
on SSI. They are the lowest income 
people, averaging $500 a month in in-
come. They didn’t have a voice. They 
hadn’t been heard from in 20 years 
until Congress did it. It is the same 
with people that Rohit Chopra will be 
paid to protect: They don’t have lobby-
ists. They don’t have a PAC. They cer-
tainly don’t have a super PAC. They 
are not able to unleash tens of millions 
of dollars of dark money to win elec-
tions. They don’t have an expensive 
lawyer they can get on the phone with 
a bank or a credit card company if 
something goes wrong. 
That is why we created the CFPB—to 
fight for them, to be a voice for ordi-
nary people—and, soon, Americans will 
have Rohit Chopra on their side. 
If you were scammed by a payday 
lender, if you were overcharged by a 
bank, if you took an unfair hit on your 
credit report, it doesn’t matter whom 
you voted for or what State. It doesn’t 
matter who your Senate sponsor is. If 
you are a page, it doesn’t matter whom 
you voted for. It doesn’t matter what 
State you live in. You need help. You 
want someone on your side, and Rohit 
Chopra will be on your side. He will 
stand up. He will be your advocate. 
That is why, as chair of the Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, 
I enthusiastically support Mr. Chopra’s 
nomination to serve as the next Direc-
tor of the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau. I urge all of my colleagues 
to support him.

ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL SHOOTING 
ANNIVERSARY 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
this is a difficult anniversary for peo-
ple in Nevada and across the country. 
Tomorrow marks 4 years since the 
Route 91 Harvest Festival attack. And 
on that day 4 years ago, thousands at-
tended a concert on a late summer 
night in my hometown of Las Vegas. 
They were at the festival to enjoy an 
evening with friends and loved ones. 
Fifty-eight of them never made it 
home. I will never forget waiting with 
families at the Reunification Center in 
Las Vegas, where they braced them-
selves for the worst possible news. 
Two more people have died of their 
wounds since the attack. Over 800 peo-
ple were injured in the shooting and in 
the chaos that followed, as people fled 
for safety. And countless members of 
our community are still dealing with 
the emotional scars left by the vio-
lence of that night. 
For those hundreds of concertgoers 
and for their loved ones, 1 October is a 
lingering presence—one that can re-
turn in a rush at the faintest reminder, 
like the sound of sirens or fireworks. 
The day remains the deadliest mass 
shooting in modern American history. 
While a nightmare unfolded around 
them, hundreds of people sprang into 
action to save lives, even at the risk of 
their 
own. 
Brave 
first 
responders 
rushed to the scene to direct people to 
safety and transport the wounded. 
Healthcare workers jumped into ac-
tion. Ordinary Nevadans stood in line 
for hours in the days after the shooting 
to give blood to those in need. And 
businesses all over the State and coun-
try provided every imaginable support, 
from food to blankets, to airline tick-
ets. 
I think about that contrast every 
time I think of October 1, 2017, between 
the darkness of the circumstances and 
the light of our community coming to-
gether in the aftermath. In the midst 
of terror and heartbreak, a whole city, 
a State, a country of people showed up 
to help one another. And I am so proud 
of Nevadans, whose first response to 
tragedy was to help their community 
heal these painful wounds. 
On that horrible night and the days 
after, every selfless act, large or small, 
made a difference. From bystanders 
who turned their pickup trucks into 
ambulances, to the thousands of Ne-
vadans who put ‘‘Vegas Strong’’ signs 
in their windows to show survivors 
that they weren’t alone, Nevadans 
came together to help. 
Now, we cannot undo the terrible ac-
tions or tragic events, but we can al-
ways do something to lessen the weight 
of these events. And even though years 
have passed, we still owe it to everyone 
touched by this tragedy to continue 
moving through our grief toward heal-
ing, and there is still so much that we 
can do. 
Every time we reminisce about those 
we have lost, we help their loved ones 
keep the memories alive. With every 
donation to the memorial scholarships, 
we honor those affected by the shoot-
ing. We help survivors deal with the 
impact of this tragedy when we talk 
about the mental health toll that the 
shooting has taken and when we work 
to decrease the stigma around mental 
health issues. 
I have consistently worked to expand 
treatment options for mental health 
and substance use issues, and I will 
keep pushing in the Senate to support 
life-changing care for those facing 
mental health challenges. 
We make it better when we advocate 
for commonsense laws to prevent gun 
violence as well, like the ones we have 
passed in Nevada. 
It is unbelievable that I am standing 
here on the Senate floor 4 years after I 
first spoke about this tragedy and that 
we still have not been able to pass 
background checks and commonsense 
gun safety measures. 
The majority of Americans are with 
us. We need to act because Las Vegas 
deserves it and so do communities all 
across the Nation. We cannot continue 
to stand by as mass attacks and shoot-
ings take a tragic toll all over the 
United States. 
To the people of Las Vegas who con-
tinue to grapple with the pain we expe-
rienced on that day, know that I am 
with you. We will continue to work to 
create a permanent memorial at the 
site of the shooting to be a tangible re-
minder of what we know; that even in 
the darkest times—especially in the 
darkest times—we can come together 
to help one another and we can make a 
difference. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, from 
Utah’s red rock canyons to our alpine 
meadows, from the sprawling salt flats 
to the towering mountain peaks, it is 
hard to overstate the beauty of Utah’s 
majestic landscapes. 
So much about being a Utahn is our 
connection to and care for our land. 
These values have been engrained in 
our culture since the pioneers found 
refuge here in 1847. We take great pride 
in the fact that folks from all over the 
country and all over the world travel 
to our State to experience these rich 
and diverse landscapes. 
Utah has nearly the highest percent-
age of its land owned by the Federal 
Government—nearly two-thirds of our 
52 million acres. And of that Federal 
land, more than 23 million acres is 
managed by the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. 
This land has been cared for and used 
by 
Utahns 
for 
generations— 
recreationists and sportsmen who take 
advantage of the access to hike, hunt, 
mountain bike, ATV, and camp; the 
ranchers who graze their livestock to 
provide our food and fiber; the commu-
nities that rely on the oil and gas de-
velopment in the Basin or the coal 
mines and powerplants to provide more 
than 70 percent of our electricity; indi-
viduals interested in exploring the cul-
tural anthropology of our land; and 
simply the residents who look to our 
open spaces for solitude. 
Utahns deserve and demand that our 
public lands be managed by someone 
they can trust. It is quite obvious that 
the President’s nominee for the Direc-
tor of Bureau of Land Management, 
Tracy Stone-Manning, is not worthy of 
our trust. 
Ms. Stone-Manning’s history of aid-
ing ecoterrorism is extremely trou-
bling and alone should be disqualifying 
for the position to which she has been 
nominated. It would be like nomi-
nating Bernie Madoff to serve as Treas-
ury Secretary. 
For those who aren’t familiar with 
tree spiking—an action with which Ms. 
Stone-Manning has been associated— 
let me offer a brief synopsis. Tree spik-
ing involves hammering a metal or ce-
ramic rod into a tree trunk. Loggers 
could be seriously harmed or even 
killed when they cut into the trunk of 
a tree that has been spiked. And the 
same goes for sawmill operators who 
are processing the log in the mill. 
Ecoterrorists who engage in tree spik-
ing are willing to cause the gruesome 
injury or death of hard-working Ameri-
cans who are simply trying to provide 
for their families. 
But it is not only her efforts assist-
ing ecoterrorists that are of concern. 
Ms. Stone-Manning’s blatant dishon-
esty about being investigated over a 
tree-spiking incident to the Senate 
should disqualify her serving as BLM 
Director. 
I take my constitutional duty to pro-
vide advice and consent with regard to 
Presidential nominees very seriously, 
as we all do. And with limited excep-
tion, I believe Presidents, regardless of 
party, should be able to put into place 
qualified individuals to 
lead 
their 
team. I have supported several of Presi-
dent Biden’s nominees even though I 
have disagreed with them on particular 
policy issues because I believe they 
were basically qualified for the posi-
tion to which they had been nomi-
nated. 
Simply put, however, Tracy Stone- 
Manning’s 
past 
involvement 
in 
ecoterrorism and her attempt to con-
ceal that participation before the Sen-
ate make her unfit to serve as Director 
of the Bureau of Land Management. 
I will be opposing her nomination 
and urge my Democratic friends—espe-
cially those who represent States with 
large amounts of Federal land—to op-
pose her nomination as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, back in 1987, 
a 
23-year-old

worker

a tree spike like this one—in the log 
that he was processing. His sawblade 
shattered, and it caused a wound

September 30, 2021 
stretching from his eye all the way 
down to his chin. His teeth were 
smashed, and his jaw was brutally 
dashed in half. The incident made na-
tional news. 
Just 2 years later, Tracy Stone-Man-
ning rented a typewriter to disguise 
her identity. She then typed and sent a 
letter to the U.S. Forest Service on be-
half of an ecoterrorist group. She con-
spired to spike trees with spikes just 
like this one—hundreds and hundreds 
of pounds of spikes just like this one. 
In so doing, endangered the lives of for-
esters, of loggers, and of firefighters. 
She ended the letter with the following 
words: 
You bastards go in there anyway and a lot 
of people could get hurt. 
Unfortunately, it wasn’t until after 
her 
nomination 
hearing 
that 
we 
learned 
of 
her 
work 
with 
the 
ecoterrorist organization EarthFirst!. 
It wasn’t until after her hearing that 
we learned that she had been issued a 
target letter by a Federal grand jury 
and had hired an attorney to negotiate 
an immunity deal prior to testifying in 
the tree-spiking case. 
It wasn’t until after her hearing that 
we read her words in a newspaper say-
ing that she ‘‘could have been charged 
with conspiracy were it not for her 
agreement with the U.S. attorney.’’ It 
wasn’t until after her hearing that we 
learned that she was compelled by that 
same Federal grand jury to submit fin-
gerprints, writing samples, and hair 
samples. 
Now, beyond her involvement with 
the ecoterrorist group, since her hear-
ing, we learned of public statements 
she made just months ago calling for 
homes to burn in forest fires. We 
learned of statements she made saying 
grazing is destroying the West and call-
ing for population control measures 
and even labeling children as environ-
mental hazards. 
After all of this, a White House offi-
cial called her nomination a ‘‘massive 
vetting failure.’’ It was that, but it is 
so much worse than that. She was and 
is a radical. She supported a criminal 
conspiracy to engage in ecoterrorism. 
Our committee asked her if she had 
ever been the subject of a criminal in-
vestigation. She, in a sworn statement, 
lied. Our committee never had the op-
portunity to ask her about these 
shameful acts. Her past actions, her po-
sitions, her statements, and her goals 
would each, individually, disqualify her 
from service. But combined, they make 
her a, frankly, offensive candidate to 
the countless people in Utah and 
throughout the West and beyond who 
rely on Bureau of Land Management 
cooperation for their livelihoods and 
for their way of life. 
Now, inexplicably, President Biden 
has not withdrawn this nomination, 
though Ms. Stone-Manning has seem-
ingly gone into hiding. She has left un-
answered dozens of questions formally 
posed to her by me and by my col-
leagues. If confirmed, she will lack the 
credibility with constituents through-
out the Nation that she would other-
wise need to perform this job. She just 
won’t have it. And any accomplish-
ments made by the Biden administra-
tion to steward our lands will be over-
shadowed by her specter of deceit. 
The Bureau of Land Management 
controls 42 percent of the land in Utah. 
In fact, the BLM controls more land in 
Utah than Utahns do—a lot more. 
So I speak for a lot of people back 
home today, people who are insulted by 
President Biden’s nomination of Tracy 
Stone-Manning to run the Bureau of 
Land Management. Her confirmation 
would be bad for Utah, bad for the Bu-
reau of Land Management, and bad for 
honesty and accountability in govern-
ment. 
Needless to say, she will not receive 
my vote. It defies logic, reason, and the 
greatest traditions of this body to 
think that we would confirm her today. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
nomination.

ator from Nevada. 
ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL SHOOTING 
ANNIVERSARY 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the memories of the 
lives that were lost in Las Vegas on Oc-
tober 1, 2017. Four years ago tomorrow, 
the Las Vegas community experienced 
tragedy on an unprecedented scale. 
Tens of thousands of people gathered 
that night for a country music festival. 
They were there to have fun, to dance, 
and to enjoy a concert with family and 
friends. That night, the fun quickly 
turned to terror when gunfire erupted, 
taking 60 innocent souls and injuring 
hundreds and hundreds more. In just 10 
minutes—10 minutes—dozens of lives 
were cut short and so many more were 
forever changed. 
These victims were friends and fam-
ily, brothers and sisters, parents and 
children, and that night, they were 
taken from us. The people that sur-
vived and the loved ones that didn’t are 
still grieving, still feeling that loss 
with every passing holiday, every pass-
ing birthday, every single day their 
lives are forever changed. 
Nevada will always feel that loss too. 
This was the worst mass shooting in 
American history, and it happened in 
our State. 
But I know our community is strong. 
We are resilient, and in our darkest 
hour—and in the days and weeks and 
months and now even years after—we 
remain 
united. 
We 
remain 
Vegas 
Strong. 
We are united in our grief for those 
we lost but also in our admiration for 
those who helped save lives and sup-
port others that night: heroic law en-
forcement officers and first responders, 
everyday citizens who ran toward the 
danger—they ran toward the danger to 
help others—and countless Nevadans 
who waited in line to donate blood and 
help people who were displaced in the 
chaotic aftermath of the shooting. 
As we reflect on the 4 years since this 
horrific event, I stand here today—I 
stand here today to honor the heroes 
who put themselves in harm’s way to 
save others. I stand here today to 
honor those who were injured phys-
ically, psychologically, and emotion-
ally, especially those who are still 
fighting to recover. Know that we are 
with you now and always. And I stand 
here today to honor those who lost 
their lives. They will never ever be for-
gotten. May their memories be a bless-
ing. And in their memory, we are resil-
ient. In their honor, we are strong. We 
are Vegas Strong. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, first of 
all, I ask permission to use an item to 
demonstrate in the speech that I am 
going to give, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow 
Senators, and the American public, I 
rise today to underscore a travesty 
that is about to take place here in 
about an hour on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. I am talking about the BLM 
matter, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment matter, the nominee the Presi-
dent of the United States has made to 
run the Bureau of Land Management as 
the Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management. That person is Tracy 
Stone-Manning. 
I think the facts have pretty well 
been laid out already in the media. At 
the same time, there is tremendous 
outrage, I can tell you, amongst not 
only BLM employees but among the 
people who earn their living and recre-
ate on the millions of acres of BLM. It 
is incredible, it is astonishing, and it is 
an embarrassment for this administra-
tion to nominate a person who is an 
ecoterrorist and a person who has per-
jured themselves before the committee 
that she appeared before on her con-
firmation and, in addition to that, has 
espoused a ‘‘let it burn’’ philosophy for 
people’s homes that she will take an 
oath to defend if she becomes head of 
the BLM, which I believe she is going 
to before the Sun goes down today. 
It is amazing to me that the adminis-
tration would put this person in this 
position. There are 330 million people 
in America. Almost every single one of 
those people, including some high 
school kids, could do this substantially 
better than she could and would not 
tarnish the name of the BLM, which is 
going to happen when she is confirmed 
as the Director of the BLM. 
So what did she do? Well, she en-
gaged in acts of ecoterrorism. She en-
gaged in a conspiracy to kill other peo-
ple. She engaged in acts with Earth 
First! that put her squarely in the tar-
get of the U.S. Government, along with 
her cohorts with whom she lived in a 
house in Montana at the time. But she 
got off the hook. She didn’t get pros-
ecuted because she turned on the oth-
ers and turned state’s evidence. She 
hired an attorney, and that attorney

negotiated with the U.S. attorney 
there, and she wound up testifying 
against the others, so she wasn’t con-
victed. Nonetheless, she was as deeply 
involved in this as they were. 
Let me read for you a letter that she 
wrote. She admits to writing this let-
ter: 
To whom it may concern, this letter is 
being sent to notify you that the Post Office 
Sale in Idaho has been spiked heavily. 
The post office sale was a Forest 
Service sale of standing timber in the 
Clearwater National Forest in Idaho. 
She writes this letter regarding that. 
The reasoning for this action is that this 
piece of land is very special to the earth. It 
is home to the Elk, Deer, Mountain Lions, 
Birds, and especially the Trees. 
She is absolutely correct on that. 
The next paragraph describes what 
she did. 
The project required that eleven of us— 
Most of whom lived in that house in 
Montana— 
spend nine days in God awful weather con-
ditions spiking trees. We unloaded a total of 
five hundred pounds of spikes measuring 8 to 
10 inches in length. 
For people who don’t understand 
what spiking trees is, and most people 
in America wouldn’t, you think, how 
could it be harmful in going out and 
putting a spike in a tree? 
This is a spike. It is not a particu-
larly large one, but it doesn’t take a 
particularly large one. What they do is 
they drive this item into a tree. They 
drive it in far enough that you can’t 
see it. It then stands there until some 
unsuspecting logger comes along and 
cuts the tree down. That logger could 
be injured, but it is unlikely they will 
be, but they could be because of the 
hidden spike that was in the tree. 
The tree is then, after it is cut down, 
cut into length—usually 16 foot—put 
onto a truck, and hauled to the mill. 
Once it gets to the mill, it is put in a 
millpond. It is then pushed eventually 
into the mill, and when it enters the 
mill, it goes on a carriage, and the car-
riage carries it to a saw. The saw may 
move back and forth, cutting the wood 
that is on this log in the carriage, or 
more likely, the carriage itself will 
move against the moving saw. 
There are a couple kinds of saws. One 
is a circular saw. It could be 5 feet. De-
pending on the size of the mill, it could 
5 feet, 6 feet, 10 feet. But in today’s 
world, more often than not, it is a 
bandsaw. A bandsaw is a piece of metal 
stripping that is a quarter-inch thick 
or so and probably a couple inches wide 
with teeth, and it circulates in the mill 
between the first floor, the second 
floor, even the third floor. As the car-
riage hits it, it then saws the log into 
boards. 
All is well unless there is one of these 
in the log. What happens when that 
saw hits this item in the log? In the 
best description I can give you, it is 
much like a hand grenade going off, ex-
cept that there is no fire explosion, but 
there is just as much shrapnel that 
goes out of this at a speed that is very, 
very fast because all of the moving 
parts are moving very fast. And what 
does it do? It kills, and it injures log 
workers who are right there on the 
floor. 
These are innocent people. They are 
people who are working to make a liv-
ing for themselves, for their families, 
for their children. They are people who 
go to work in the morning and do not 
come home because someone know-
ingly, intentionally, maliciously, with 
a black and an abandoned heart, stuck 
one of these in the tree. That is the 
only reason you put one of these in a 
tree, is to kill and maim fellow human 
beings who are absolutely innocent and 
who have done nothing wrong. 
She was involved in this. This person 
whom the administration wants to run 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Land 
Management, 
which manages millions of acres, the 
largest tracts of land in the United 
States of America—they want to put 
this woman in charge of this Agency. 
They sell timber all the time. She will 
be in charge of that. There is no need 
for this woman to be in charge of this 
Agency. There are plenty of people who 
could do this. 
Today, in the Clearwater National 
Forest, those trees are still there. 
Some of them will be there for 100 or 
more years. It is very possible one of 
these is going to kill somebody work-
ing in one of the mills at some point in 
time after all of us are dead and gone. 
They will ask at that time: How did 
this happen? 
They will say: Well, a woman who 
eventually became head of the BLM 
was involved in putting these spikes in 
these trees here. 
People will shake their heads and 
say: What were those people thinking? 
That is shameful. It is despicable. 
Yet that is what is about to happen 
here. 
Now, that was a while ago that this 
happened, but what has happened re-
cently? 
She will be in charge of firefighting. 
Firefighting is absolutely critical on 
public lands in the West. We need it on 
Forest Service land; we need it on Bu-
reau of Land Management land. But, 
like I said, she has embraced the idea 
that letting fires burn and burning 
down the houses that are in the inter-
face zones is perfectly fine. 
How do we know this? It is in writ-
ing. It is absolutely in writing. There 
was an article written, fortuitously, by 
her husband in 2018 but which she em-
braced on September 15, 2020, in a 
tweet, and I will get to the tweet in a 
minute. But this is the view that her 
husband takes of what should happen 
to houses—perfectly innocent people’s 
houses—that are built near public 
lands. The idea is, let it burn. 
He says: 
But the federal government then needs to 
make fighting wildfires—a social process— 
subject to a social contract. Perhaps the feds 
should commit themselves to refusing to 
send in the troops to any county that has 
not taken such measures. Perhaps the solu-
tion to houses in the interface is to let them 
burn. 
He says: 
There’s a rude and satisfying justice in 
burning down the house of someone who 
builds in the forest. 
She embraced this. Just a little over 
a year ago, she put out a tweet and 
said: 
Not a bad time to revisit this piece from 
my husband, Richard Manning, from two 
years ago. [This is a] clarion call. 
‘‘Let them burn,’’ she says; a clarion 
call to let people’s homes burn. 
She put that out on September 15, 
2020, just a little over a year ago. This 
is the person we are going to confirm 
to fight fires and protect people’s 
homes in the West. 
All of us in the West live relatively 
close to the interface zones, and many 
people, millions of people, live in the 
interface zones. She is saying it is a 
clarion call to let them burn, and, in-
deed, they will get a rude and satis-
fying justice in burning down the 
houses that were built in the interface 
zone. 
You can’t make this stuff up. If 
someone wrote a book about this, 
someone would toss it and say: That is 
too ridiculous. This could never hap-
pen. 
This is the woman this U.S. Senate is 
going to confirm on a straight party- 
line vote in about an hour here. 
So she comes before the committee, 
and although we didn’t have all of the 
facts at the time, as has been alluded 
to by my colleagues here, we were 
aware that she had attachments to 
ecoterrorist groups. So some questions 
were put to her, and as always happens 
before the committee, they are re-
quired to be signed under oath, which 
she did, and she was asked whether or 
not she had ever been arrested or 
charged or been the target of an inves-
tigation involving spiking. She says— 
now under oath after solemnly swear-
ing to tell the truth—‘‘No, I have never 
been arrested or charged, and to my 
knowledge, I have never been the tar-
get of such an investigation.’’ 
She hired an attorney to negotiate 
with the U.S. attorney because she was 
a target of the investigation, had re-
ceived a target letter, and had been 
told she was a target of that. 
What are we doing here? How in the 
world can somebody come before a 
committee, take an oath that they 
would tell the truth, and then flat lie? 
She was also asked: Did you have 
personal knowledge of—did you have 
personal knowledge of—participate in, 
or in any way, directly or indirectly, 
support activities associated with the 
spiking of trees in Idaho’s Clearwater 
National Forest on March 29, 1989? 
We read the letter she wrote where 
she admitted that she was involved in 
that. 
Her answer to that: ‘‘I had no in-
volvement in the spiking of trees.’’ 
Under oath, she said that. We know 
otherwise. 
She said, ‘‘Eleven of us [spent] nine 
days in God awful weather conditions

spiking trees,’’ and she under oath 
says, ‘‘No.’’ 
Next question: Did you have personal 
knowledge of, participate in, or in any 
way, directly or indirectly, support ac-
tivities associated with the spiking of 
trees in any forest during your life-
time? 
Answer: ‘‘No.’’ 
We know better. She admitted to 
signing this letter where she fessed up 
to it. 
Well, look, I know I am not going to 
talk the Democrats out of confirming 
her. I can tell you that this is a shame-
ful, shameful thing for the administra-
tion to do. It is a shameful thing for 
my friends in the majority to confirm 
her. 
What I can tell you is, when she 
comes before the committee that we sit 
on, where we have oversight of the 
BLM—and we have the Director in reg-
ularly because we have oversight re-
sponsibility—how will we believe one 
word she says when she has already 
perjured herself? 
This is wrong. It is a shameful mo-
ment for this administration. I can tell 
you the employees of the Bureau of 
Land Management are going to have a 
very difficult time working under a 
person who is an ecoterrorist and who 
is a perjurer. She should not be con-
firmed. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to associate myself with the re-
marks of the gentleman from Idaho 
and the gentleman from Utah, who just 
spoke about one of the most egregious 
nominations to ever receive a vote on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I am speaking of President Biden’s 
nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to 
be Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. 
I have been here in Washington, DC, 
for close to a decade now, and I know 
that oftentimes it feels there are few 
things that unite us as Democrats and 
Republicans. I would have hoped that 
just one of those things that would 
have united us would be opposition to 
ecoterrorism; and yet, in about an 
hour, the Senate will be voting to con-
firm a known ecoterrorist collaborator 
to lead one of the most consequential 
land management agencies. 
I am flabbergasted. I am aghast. I am 
horrified. This is a solemn, bad day for 
land management in the United States. 
Here we are, $28 trillion-plus in 
debt—28 trillion-plus in debt. Inflation 
is threatening every single American. 
We have a global pandemic, a major 
crisis at our southern border, a massive 
government expansion, and debt ceil-
ing debate, and Senate Democrats want 
to put an ecoterrorist collaborator to 
manage one of the biggest land man-
agement agencies in the United States. 
The Bureau of Land Management ad-
ministers about 245 million acres of 
land. It manages 18.4 million acres of 
public land surface in my State and 
nearly 43 million acres of Federal min-
eral estate in my home State of Wyo-
ming. 
As is required by law, the Bureau of 
Land Management operates under a 
multiple-use mandate that balances 
recreation needs, energy development, 
grazing, conservation, mining, wildlife 
habitat, and more. Leading this Agen-
cy requires someone who is balanced 
and committed to supporting this mul-
tiple-use mandate. It is the law that 
governs the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. 
Do we have that in Ms. Stone-Man-
ning? 
As reported by the Washington Post, 
of all places, Ms. Stone-Manning was a 
spokeswoman for Earth First!, the 
group responsible for the ecoterrorist 
tree spiking spoken of by Mr. RISCH 
and Mr. LEE moments ago in Idaho’s 
Clearwater National Forests. 
So what is the motto for the group 
for which Ms. Stone-Manning served as 
a mouthpiece? 
Here it is: ‘‘No compromise in the de-
fense of Mother Earth.’’ 
No compromise. None. And yet we 
are supposed to trust that Ms. Stone- 
Manning will compromise on the inevi-
table conflicts that will come before 
her as BLM Director, the requirement 
that she balance the interests on use of 
BLM land? 
For President Biden and my Senate 
colleagues across the aisle, do you real-
ly want your names associated with a 
‘‘no compromise’’ mouthpiece of a con-
victed ecoterrorist organization; some-
one who lied under oath to the Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee? 
In her testimony, she lied under 
oath. Someone who has advocated for 
population control as a means to save 
the environment; someone who has 
written that grazing is ‘‘destroying the 
West.’’ 
Now, pair that remark with what you 
just heard from Senator RISCH. Senator 
RISCH says: She and her husband want 
those houses in the interface with the 
forest to burn. 
What prevents them from burning? 
It is grazing. Grazing done right 
helps keep the forest floor and the 
grasses from igniting conflagrations. 
Grazing is good for the West, yet she 
has written that grazing destroys the 
West. Grazing is one of the elements of 
multiple use. 
Does that mean that she is going to 
use her position to try to eliminate 
grazing in the West? 
That would add to catastrophic fires. 
That would add to carbon emissions 
from these monster fires that we are 
having. 
Management requires land manage-
ment. That is why it is called the Bu-
reau of Land Management. It is not the 
bureau of land let it be, let it burn, let 
it rot, let it be ignored. It is the Bu-
reau of Land Management, with a mul-
tiple-use mandate. 
Ms. Manning is wholly unqualified to 
serve in this position—absolutely un-
qualified. 
I urge President Biden to withdraw 
her nomination before 7:00 tonight, and 
for Senate Democrats to join us in say-
ing no to this nominee. This nominee is 
an insult to the American West. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to use a 
prop on the Senate floor, a tree spike. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, you 
see some of my colleagues are down 
here. We are a little bit fired up. Right? 
And this is not some kind of partisan 
game. We are fired up for a reason— 
that the U.S. Senate is getting ready 
to confirm a nominee who has no busi-
ness being even considered on the Sen-
ate floor. No business being considered 
on the Senate floor. 
And with all due respect to my col-
league from Montana, this isn’t—what 
did he say—attacks against somebody. 
These are facts that we are going to 
talk about. These are facts—someone 
who is still continuing to not even tell 
the truth about her past as a violent 
ecoterrorist. 
Now, look, we know this administra-
tion has put forth far-left individuals. I 
am going to talk about a few. But to 
put forward a far-left, violent nomi-
nee—I think we all should recognize—is 
kind of a bridge too far for the U.S. 
Senate. 
But that is happening right now, and 
I am really hopeful that at least some 
of my Democratic colleagues, at the 
last 
minute, 
will 
go: 
Maybe 
we 
shouldn’t do this. Maybe we shouldn’t 
set this standard. 
So I have been on the floor a number 
of times talking about Tracy Stone- 
Manning’s nomination. It is actually 
the first time in my Senate career that 
I asked the President to withdraw a 
nominee, and for good reasons—be-
cause of all the things you have heard 
from my colleagues from Wyoming, 
Idaho; colleagues from mostly Western 
States. 
And I am going to ask my Demo-
cratic colleagues from Western States: 
Do you really want to set this prece-
dent? How are you going to go home 
and tell people who harvest timber le-
gally for a living that you were good to 
go with this; good to go with someone 
who put hundreds of these kinds of tree 
spikes in trees for people—our fellow 
Americans—to get hurt? 
But that is what we are seeing right 
here. 
You know, I think that maybe the 
Biden administration, after I and many 
others requested that they withdraw 
this 
nominee, 
that 
maybe 
they 
thought: Well, look. With all the noise 
going on around here—a reckless $31⁄2 
trillion 
tax-and-spend 
extravaganza, 
the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, 
the crisis on the southern border, infla-
tion going through the roof, the price 
at the pump hurting working families 
in my State and those across America,

the shutdown of the energy sector uni-
laterally and then going begging Rus-
sia and Iran for more oil that they can 
import to the United States—I mean, 
you can’t make this stuff up. 
But I think the Biden administration 
thought, with all this chaos that they 
are creating, maybe nobody will notice 
Tracy Stone-Manning’s confirmation 
process and vote. 
Well, they are wrong. As you see 
here, there are some really strong feel-
ings 
about 
this 
nominee—a 
past 
ecoterrorist; a member of Earth First!, 
an extreme group that performed vio-
lent acts as part of their platform for 
getting attention in America. 
In fact, she is so extreme that the Di-
rector of BLM from the Obama-Biden 
administration, Bob Abbey, made a 
statement saying that if her violent 
ecoterrorist past activities were true— 
and they were. They were. I am going 
to talk about them. Senator RISCH has 
already talked about them; Senator 
BARRASSO has; Senator LUMMIS has—if 
these 
were 
true, 
then 
President 
Obama’s BLM Director said she does 
not deserve the job. 
So this isn’t just Republicans. This is 
the former Democrat Director of the 
Agency that we are going to vote on 
that she wants to lead. 
So before I talk a little bit more 
about her—and I know we have had a 
number of Senators do it—I want to 
make another point. 
The reason I have been down here so 
much, focused on this nominee, is that 
BLM to some states—heck, if you live 
in Connecticut, probably nobody knows 
what that is. But the Bureau of Land 
Management in my State is one of the 
most powerful Federal Agencies there 
is in the great State of Alaska. 
The Alaska BLM manages more sur-
face and subsurface acres in my State 
than in any other State in the country, 
by far. 
The BLM Director in Alaska is our 
landlord, 
and 
I 
don’t 
want 
an 
ecoterrorist as my State’s landlord, 
and neither do my constituents. 
Let me give you some numbers. The 
BLM manager in Alaska manages over 
70 million surface acres of land and 220 
million subsurface acres of land in 
Alaska. 
A little context: That is the equiva-
lent land of about one-fifth of the en-
tire lower 48. Do you see why this is 
really important to me and my con-
stituents? Most States can’t even com-
prehend land that size. One-fifth of the 
lower 48 of the United States of Amer-
ica is about the amount of land BLM 
manages just in my State. This is a 
huge amount of land, and, of course, by 
definition, a huge amount of power 
that this Federal Agency has over the 
people I am privileged to represent— 
their work, their jobs, their hunting 
activities, their subsistence activities. 
And that is why I have been down here 
talking about this nominee. 
I know to some in East Coast 
States—forget it. We don’t know who 
she is. No power. She doesn’t have any 
power over New Jersey or some of 
these other small States on the East 
Coast. 
But in my State, massive power, and 
it is imperative that the Director of 
this Agency, the Bureau of Land Man-
agement, with so much power and so 
much control over the future of Alaska 
and its economic opportunity for work-
ing families, that the manager of BLM 
be trustworthy, be honest, be fair-
minded, beyond reproach, and certainly 
not someone who was involved in 
ecoterrorism earlier in their career. 
Is that too much to ask, my col-
leagues in the Senate? 
What we know about Tracy Stone- 
Manning is, she is none of these things. 
She hasn’t been trustworthy with the 
Senate, fairminded. 
Well, let’s go back to a little bit of 
her background because people need to 
know this. People need to know this. 
My colleagues have already done a 
good job, but I hope the American peo-
ple are watching this. She was not only 
a member of Earth First!, a radical far- 
left group that has engaged repeatedly 
in what is defined as ecoterrorism, she, 
herself, was complicit in putting metal 
spikes—see 
this—big, 
thick, 
metal 
spikes, by the hundreds, in trees that 
were meant either to hurt or gravely 
injure American citizens who were le-
gally harvesting trees. 
We are OK with that, Senate Demo-
crats? We are OK with that? Americans 
who were cutting down trees legally as 
part of their job to help their economy, 
to help their family, who were putting 
trees in saw mills legally. All the 
while, she and her buddies—comrades, I 
call them—were acting illegally, put-
ting these spikes, by the hundreds, in 
trees. 
This was a common technique—tree 
spiking is what it is called—developed 
by ecoterrorists in the 1980s and early 
nineties. Now, Ms. Manning’s group, 
Earth First!, began in the 1980s by dis-
affected 
environmentalists 
who 
thought their movement wasn’t radical 
enough: ‘‘So how can we get more at-
tention? 
Let’s 
perpetrate 
violence 
against fellow Americans.’’ That is how 
they could get more attention. Their 
slogan was ‘‘No compromise in the de-
fense of Mother Earth.’’ In their view, 
‘‘no compromise’’ meant destroying 
property, putting steel spikes in trees 
that could kill someone who harvested 
a tree. And they celebrated and even 
encouraged such actions. The group 
even put out a manual detailing tree 
spiking and instructions on how to do 
other sabotage activities: cutting down 
power lines, flattening tires, burning 
machinery—all directed at those who 
were trying to legally harvest trees. 
David Foreman, the founder of Earth 
First!, described all these activities as 
‘‘fun.’’ ‘‘This is where [you] can have 
fun.’’ 
Let me talk a little bit about ‘‘fun.’’ 
I have an article from the Washington 
Post during that time. They were talk-
ing about a tree-spiking incident, and I 
am going to quote from it: 
George Alexander, a third-generation mill 
worker, was just starting his shift at the 
Louisiana-Pacific lumber mill in Cloverdale, 
Calif., when the log that would alter his life 
rolled down his conveyor belt toward a high- 
speed saw. 
Now, we have some of these saws in 
these mills in Alaska—not nearly as 
many as we used to have. They are 
huge. They are giant. They are the size 
of people. They spin at incredibly fast 
speeds with huge teeth. They are dan-
gerous to work with normally. But 
when you put a steel spike in a tree 
that is going through a fastly spinning 
saw, you can imagine the explosion and 
the violence. 
I will continue the article: 
It was May 1987, and Alexander was 23 
[years old]. His job was to split logs. He was 
nearly three feet away when the log [he was 
working on] hit his saw and the [giant] saw 
exploded. One half of the blade [struck] . . . 
the log. 
It exploded when it hit one of these. 
The other half hit Alexander in the [fore-
head, with the giant saw] tearing through his 
safety helmet . . . [tearing through his]face 
shield. His face was slashed from eye to chin. 
His teeth were smashed and his jaw was cut 
in half. 
Good job, Earth First!—a fellow 
American, trying to kill a fellow Amer-
ican. These were the kind of activities 
that Tracy Stone-Manning once con-
spired in. 
I wonder if that disturbs anybody? 
I was up at our fish camp on the 
Yukon River this summer over the 
Fourth of July clearing some brush, 
trees, working a chain saw—a smaller 
chain saw—and I literally was think-
ing, ‘‘Boy, I wonder what would happen 
if my chain saw hit one of these?’’ 
It wouldn’t have been good. So I 
think if you are not disturbed by this, 
you really should be. 
So I know that some of my col-
leagues have already read the letter on 
the floor that she wrote, a profane, 
anonymous letter from this member of 
Earth First!, about the 500 pounds of 
tree 
spikes—500 
pounds—hammered 
into trees in Idaho. 
She rewrote the letter on a rented 
typewriter because, she later told a re-
porter, her fingerprints were all over 
it. So she didn’t want to be caught. So, 
obviously, she knew she was engaging 
in criminal activity. She didn’t just 
handwrite it; she typed it and then sent 
it to the FBI. Now, I know some of my 
colleagues have already read it. I am 
just going to notice a couple of high-
lights: 
This letter is being sent to notify you that 
the Post Office Sale in [the great State of] 
Idaho has been spiked heavily. . . . 
The project required that eleven of us 
spend nine days in God awful weather condi-
tions spiking trees. We unloaded a total of 
500 pounds of spikes measuring 8 to 10 inches 
in length. . . . 
Five hundred pounds of these. That is 
a lot of spikes. 
The majority of trees were spiked within 
the first ten feet, but many, many others 
were spiked as high as a hundred and fifty 
feet. 
Again, why would they go that high? 
That is not where you are going to cut

it down. So when it goes to the mill, 
you injure and kill the mill workers. 
She goes on further. 
Mr. President, I don’t know if I am 
allowed to swear, but you can call me 
out if I am not supposed to: 
P.S. You bastards go in there anyway and 
a lot of people could get hurt. 
That is real nice. 
Now, she kept quiet for many years 
on what she did. She later received im-
munity for her part in this tree spiking 
when prosecutors went after other 
members of Earth First!, and she testi-
fied about it. But in her narrative, she 
has always tried to portray herself as a 
victim. 
She wasn’t a victim. 
The investigator of this disputes that 
characterization 
dramatically. 
The 
U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Mi-
chael Merkley described her as vulgar, 
antagonistic, and extremely anti-gov-
ernment. She was uncooperative. 
It was also clear that only after she 
knew she was going to get in trouble 
that she began to cooperate. ‘‘Let me 
be clear,’’ Special Agent Merkley said 
recently, ‘‘Ms. Stone-Manning only 
came forward after her attorney struck 
the immunity deal, and not before she 
was caught.’’ 
In testimony to the Senate, she 
claimed that tree spiking was alleged. 
It wasn’t alleged. 
And that it was never investigated. 
That is not true. We know that is not 
true. 
So that was recent. 
So it is not just the tree spiking. She 
hasn’t been honest, but she is still 
clearly a radical. 
Let me give you another example. 
Her husband wrote an article for Harp-
er’s Magazine—Senator RISCH already 
talked about this—in 2018, claiming 
wildfires were a political issue and that 
such an issue should be solved by let-
ting houses in forests burn. 
Think about that. 
Perhaps the solution to houses in the 
interface is to let them burn. 
Those are his exact words. Now, look, 
that is her husband. We can’t blame 
her for her husband’s radical views. 
But here is what she did. She weighed 
in 
herself 
in 
2020—last 
year— 
retweeting the article and basically en-
dorsing his views. Here is what she 
said: 
Not a bad time to revisit this piece from 
my husband, Richard Manning, from two 
years ago. Clarion call . . . [on climate ac-
tion]. 
So think about that. 
So I was in charge of our lands in 
Alaska. We worked—including fighting 
wildfires—we worked really closely 
with the Federal Government, the 
State of Alaska, Federal officials, on 
fighting our wildfires. We have big 
wildfires in Alaska, always have had 
them, always will have them. Never 
ever, ever, in any time I was involved 
in issues relating to fighting wildfires, 
have I heard a State official or Federal 
official say, ‘‘Hey, if there is a fire near 
a bunch of homes, let them burn.’’ 
But do you see the problem? She is 
going to be in charge of that in Alaska. 
‘‘Let them burn.’’ 
You know what our Federal fire-
fighters do? They save structures. They 
save houses. They are very heroic. 
‘‘Let them burn,’’ she said last year. 
In a nutshell, this is potentially, if 
we don’t stop this vote tonight, the 
new head of the BLM. She was a mem-
ber of an ecoterrorist group who had a 
goal to actually threaten to hurt or ac-
tually hurt American citizens, hard- 
working Americans doing something 
legal. She has clearly been dishonest 
recently. 
With all due respect to my colleague 
from Montana, these are not some kind 
of ad hominem attacks. These are 
facts. 
Last year, she said: Hey, I agree with 
my husband’s article. Let it burn. Let 
the homes burn in these wildfires. 
That is not going to work in my 
State. She is going to head up an Agen-
cy with enormous power over my State 
and its future. 
So, look, we have differences on 
issues of resource development, energy 
for America, certainly on issues of 
jobs. In my State, unfortunately, the 
Biden administration seems to, weekly, 
want to shut down resources just in 
Alaska. I think we are up to almost 20 
Executive orders or related actions 
from this administration focused just 
on my State—to shut down jobs. 
I gave a speech here a while ago ask-
ing, not the President of the Senate, 
the President of the United States: Can 
you imagine if a Republican adminis-
tration came in and issued almost, who 
knows, 10, 15—it is hard to count—Ex-
ecutive orders shutting down Dela-
ware’s economy? What would you do, 
Mr. President, if you were a Senator? 
You would be furious. 
Well, I am furious, and I am furious 
because we have got another radical 
who is going to be in charge of my 
State’s future. 
‘‘Let it burn.’’ Tree spikes. 
But 
here 
we 
are, 
unfortunately, 
about to confirm this individual as the 
Director of BLM. But here’s the thing 
I want to know. If you are a western 
Senator—say, Arizona, Nevada, Cali-
fornia—good luck going home and ex-
plaining this to your constituents. 
Good luck with that. 
I am going to just mention another 
nominee to speak about briefly. If 
Tracy Stone-Manning weren’t radical 
enough, I would like to mention an-
other Biden nominee from the far-left 
socialist fringe. This is Saule Omarova, 
who was nominated by the President to 
be Comptroller of the Currency. 
So what does the Comptroller of Cur-
rency do? 
It charters and regulates and super-
vises all national banks—another very 
serious position. Not a lot of Ameri-
cans, you know, highlight this or think 
about it a lot. It is like BLM, but it is 
important 
and 
powerful. 
And 
you 
would think you would have somebody 
in that position who would understand 
or value and respect free markets in 
our financial system, particularly our 
banks. 
Ms. Omarova doesn’t value our sys-
tem and doesn’t seem to much like 
banks. She has other ideas. According 
to the Wall Street Journal today, they 
said that it might even make our col-
league Senator SANDERS blush. 
So who is Ms. Omarova? 
First, she is a 1989 graduate in Mos-
cow State University, where she re-
ceived the Lenin Personal Academic 
Scholarship. Yeah, you heard me right. 
I am not talking Moscow, ID. I am 
talking the real Moscow in the Soviet 
Union. Let me say that again. A grad-
uate 
of 
Moscow 
State 
University, 
where she received the Lenin Personal 
Academic Scholarship. You can’t make 
this stuff up. 
From her writings, it appears that 
she still significantly believes in what 
she learned at old Moscow U, particu-
larly about our free market system and 
communism and socialism. 
Here is what she tweeted in 2019— 
2019, 3 years ago—2 years ago: Until I 
came to the U.S., I couldn’t imagine 
things like gender pay gap still existed 
in today’s world. Say what you want 
about the old USSR, there was no gen-
der pay gap there. Markets don’t al-
ways know best. 
That is a tweet 2 years ago: Say what 
you want about the old USSR, about 
Stalin and Lenin and the roughly 100 
million 
people 
killed 
during 
their 
reigns. Say what you want about the 
old USSR, the famine, human degrada-
tion, about the ill-fated violent at-
tempts to snuff out the flame of free-
dom and liberty all across the world. 
Say what you want about the old 
USSR, the gulags, pogroms. At least 
there is no gender gap. There is no food 
either, by the way; and there is no free-
dom. 
So she is like: Hum, maybe I should 
clarify this. 
So here is her clarification: I never 
claimed men and women were treated 
absolutely equal in every facet of the 
old Soviet Union, but people’s salaries 
were set by the State in a gender-blind 
manner, and all women got very gen-
erous benefits, but those things are 
still a pipe dream in our American so-
ciety. 
Wow. That was her clarification. Oh, 
the golden days of the USSR, a mere 
pipe dream now. Her nostalgia for so-
cialist communist regimes and policies 
doesn’t end with pay disparities. She 
has advocated for expanding the Fed-
eral Reserve’s mandate to include dra-
conian controls over financial institu-
tions, wages, and consumer bank de-
posits. 
How would she do this? 
Through ‘‘a people’s ledger, a na-
tional investment authority, a public 
interest council.’’ 
Sounds like a modern-day version of 
the system set up by the Bolsheviks 
that I am sure she learned about at 
Moscow U. Plainly put, she is another 
radical who will have sweeping powers

September 30, 2021 
over the institutions of our United 
States Government. 
So I am going to conclude with this: 
If you are watching America, I hope 
you are seeing a theme here. The Biden 
administration, unfortunately with the 
help of some of my Senate Democratic 
colleagues, is trying to make us com-
fortable with far-left fringe radical ap-
pointments who will take over very 
significant posts in our government 
and will push us towards the path of so-
cialism. They are pushing a radical left 
lurch for our country that the vast ma-
jority of Americans don’t want. 
Just look at what my colleagues are 
coming up with, with their $31⁄2 trillion 
tax-and-spend bill written by the chair-
man of the Budget Committee, an 
avowed socialist. It is not an insult. 
That is a fact. 
All this is being done with no hear-
ings, no markups; the biggest social 
spending bill in decades with zero 
transparency. Even the House had a 
markup. But the Senate, once known 
as the most deliberative body in the 
world, is not having one hearing or one 
markup on a $31⁄2 trillion reckless tax- 
and-spend bill. 
But mainstream middle-class Amer-
ica does not want socialism, and they 
don’t want far-left radicals to run our 
Federal Government. My Democratic 
colleagues keep thinking they can ram 
through this far-left agenda without 
anyone noticing, but the American 
people are noticing. The American peo-
ple are wise, and they are already 
starting to feel the pain of the Biden 
administration’s far-left, anti-energy, 
anti-capitalism agenda, especially at 
the pump. 
They will remember which Senators 
are enabling this, and they will remem-
ber the Senators who have no problem 
voting for nominees who have a record 
of being part of organizations that 
sought to perpetrate violence against 
their fellow Americans. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues 
have a change of heart and vote 
against Tracy Stone-[Spike]-Manning 
because our country and my State real-
ly don’t need her in charge. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
there has been a lot of impassioned 
words about a nominee that we will 
have before us in just a matter of less 
than an hour, Tracy Stone-Manning. 
Know that I join my colleagues in the 
concerns that they have expressed, as 
we look to those individuals that we 
asked to take the helm of some of 
these very important Agencies—Agen-
cies, as my colleague from Alaska has 
pointed out—that have extraordinary 
impact on the activities and the ac-
tions that go on in our State. We need 
to have only the highest caliber of men 
and women. And in what we have seen, 
the background that we have seen with 
this particular nominee, I would hope, 
would shock us all. 
And so as we move forward with this 
nomination process and consider the 
impact to, again, not just an Agency, 
not just to a department, but the im-
pact that then comes to our commu-
nities, our States, the people who we 
work for, it is only appropriate and fit-
ting that we speak to the issues that 
we have learned of; we speak to the 
truth of the matter; and the truth of 
the matter is that this nominee is not 
an individual who should be in this po-
sition. 
NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE 
Mr. President, I did not come to the 
floor today to speak to this nomina-
tion. I have done it previously. I will be 
voting against her nomination in just a 
moment, but I came to the floor today 
because this is a day of special recogni-
tion, September 30. And I am joining 
colleagues and many people across our 
country and in Canada, who are coming 
together on what we are calling a Na-
tional Day of Remembrance, to give 
voice to the thousands of Native chil-
dren who tragically died in Indian 
boarding schools across America and in 
Canada and to acknowledge and sup-
port the thousands of Native children 
who survived but are perhaps still cop-
ing 
with 
intergenerational 
trauma 
from these experiences. 
Today, we recognize and honor the 
lives lost of thousands of innocent Na-
tive children who died and remain lost 
to their communities and families in 
misattributed 
or 
unmarked 
graves 
across America and in Canada. We re-
member not only the children that 
were lost but not forgotten, but also 
the families, again, that are still im-
pacted by this tragedy. 
Supporters like myself are wearing 
orange today because of the story of 
one First Nation’s boarding school sur-
vivor, Phyllis Webstad. Phyllis helped 
to elevate this issue by recounting her 
own boarding school experience in Can-
ada. She was just 6 years old—6 years 
old. She was living with her grand-
mother when she was taken away to a 
residential Mission school. 
You know, you think about what 
that means, to know that the child 
that is entrusted to you as the grand-
parent, that her education, the only 
education that she will be able to re-
ceive, will be away from the family, 
away from you at 6 years of age. 
Her family didn’t have a lot of 
money, but somehow, her grandmother 
managed to buy a new outfit for her to 
wear on the first day of school, and 
that outfit included a new shiny orange 
shirt that Phyllis had picked out for 
this occasion. And when that little girl 
arrived at school, excited for her first 
day, she was shocked to be stripped of 
her clothes and her new orange shirt 
and forced to wear a standard uniform. 
And it was that moment in time that 
would leave an indelible mark on a 
young girl that would later start a 
movement across nations to remind us 
how innocent Native children were 
truly stripped of their identities and 
made to feel as if they didn’t matter— 
they just didn’t matter. 
The stories of those children who 
were taken from their families and 
sent away to these boarding schools 
need to be shared, and they need to be 
heard. And we collectively, as a coun-
try, need to support indigenous sur-
vivors in their healing journey. 
Our Nation’s history in the treat-
ment of Native American people is not 
an easy one to tell. It is not easy to 
hear or to acknowledge, but our dis-
comfort in sharing painful, collective 
history probably pales in comparison 
to the lived experience and the reali-
ties that so many Native people con-
tinue to face today. 
For a long period of time, beginning 
with the enactment of the Civilization 
Act of March 3, 1819, there were thou-
sands of Native American children who 
were taken from their families and 
taken from their communities, often 
forcibly removed. They were relocated 
to residential boarding schools. Some 
of the schools were perhaps closer to 
their home and some of those schools 
not so close to home and not so close 
to their families. 
The Federal Government made at-
tendance compulsory for all indigenous 
children. Some of the children were as 
young as just 3 or 4 years old. I find 
that 
just 
incomprehensible, 
really, 
that a toddler—a toddler—could be re-
moved from their home and their par-
ents. 
While Indian boarding schools were 
in operation, many enrolled children 
were forced into manual labor. Some 
worked maintaining the schools that 
they were in, and a number of schools 
lent the children to nearby commu-
nities or surrounding States to work, 
and they worked as domestic servants. 
They may have worked as farm labor-
ers and at factories. 
While 
attending 
Indian 
boarding 
school, so many—so many—children 
were stripped of their Native identities 
and their culture. We have heard the 
stories. They were forbidden to speak 
in their traditional language. They 
were forbidden to practice their reli-
gious or their spiritual beliefs. They 
were forbidden to dress in traditional 
clothes, to wear their hair long or in 
braids. Native identity was replaced 
with a new identity that was viewed as 
being more acceptable to American so-
ciety at that time. And by cutting a 
child’s long hair, speaking to them 
only in English, dressing them in uni-
forms, shedding all parts of their indig-
enous cultures, our Federal Govern-
ment really stole from these children 
their identities, who they are. 
The stories are told—they are leg-
endary in many places—stories told 
about when a child disobeyed the rules, 
they were often physically, verbally, 
mentally abused, sometimes placed in 
solitary confinement like a prisoner. It 
has been commonly reported that nu-
merous Native children who attended 
the 
Indian 
boarding 
schools 
were 
abused both physically and sexually. 
Many 
children 
died 
while 
at 
the 
schools. 
This is what remains unknown. We 
know that they died from exposure to

disease. We know that there were 
deaths due to accidents. There were 
many unexplained reasons—but the 
abuse that some suffered. 
In recent months, we have seen 
shocking evidence of hundreds of un-
marked graves of First Nations chil-
dren who attended Canadian residen-
tial schools and were found at former 
schools in British Columbia and Sas-
katchewan. 
Here in this country, the Department 
of the Interior has begun a comprehen-
sive archival review of U.S. boarding 
schools that were here. This is going to 
be a very important and a very nec-
essary investigation. 
Mr. President, I want to share with 
you the story of one young Aleut girl 
from Alaska. She was an orphan. She 
was 17 years old when she died. She 
died on May 6, 1906. She was a student 
of 
the 
Carlisle 
Indian 
Industrial 
School. This was a rural boarding 
school that is located in Pennsylvania. 
Sophia Tetoff was Unangas, Aleut. 
She was one of the many children who 
were lent from the Carlisle School to 
live with and work for other White 
families. So keep in mind, when she 
left Alaska, she was 12 years old. She is 
12 years old. She thinks she is going off 
to boarding school, she is going to get 
her education, and she is lent from the 
school to live and work for White fami-
lies in that area. 
Within her first year of being at Car-
lisle, Sophia would be placed with fam-
ilies in New Jersey, in Maryland, and 
in Pennsylvania, where she worked es-
sentially as a servant. We don’t know a 
lot of the details of those 5 years that 
Sophia spent at Carlisle, but what we 
do 
know 
is 
that 
after 
the 
near 
monthlong journey it took to get this 
young girl from her home village on St. 
Paul Island in the middle of the Bering 
Sea—think about that. You are 12 
years old, and you are put on a ship, 
leaving your small village in the mid-
dle of the Bering Sea and crossing 
those waters to get over to the east 
coast—a monthlong journey, for a 12- 
year-old. 
She spent the majority of her time 
living with various non-Native fami-
lies, working as a servant, without her 
family or any familiarity to offer her 
any comfort. 
It was during her last placement that 
she contracted tuberculosis. She was 
returned to the school—not returned 
home. She was returned to the school, 
where she died a year later, alone in a 
school hospital. She died alone, 4,000 
miles from her home and her family. 
This year, in July, Sophia’s remains, 
along with the remains of nine Rosebud 
Sioux children, were repatriated from 
Carlisle, PA, back to their original 
homelands. 
Sophia was returned home to St. 
Paul for her final burial and her for-
ever resting place, surrounded by rel-
atives and people who loved her, even 
though most had never known her. 
It has been reported that Sophia was 
one of 188 students buried at Carlisle, 
and she was one of more than 100,000 
Native children who were placed in an 
estimated 375 boarding schools across 
our country in an effort to assimilate 
Indian people. 
So just let that kind of sink in for a 
moment here, the sheer number of 
young, young children who were taken 
from their parents, from their families, 
their Tribes, and their communities 
who would never return home. This is 
just—it is heartbreaking. 
Carlisle was one of the first off-res-
ervation, 
government-funded, 
assimilationist boarding schools that 
Native American children attended. 
We often hear the name BG Richard 
Henry Pratt mentioned when we learn 
of some of the atrocities that came 
from Indian boarding school policies. 
Mr. Pratt was the founder of the Car-
lisle School, and he coined the phrase 
‘‘Kill the Indian, save the man.’’ 
At that time in history, mainstream 
society largely believed that Native 
Americans were a problem that needed 
to be solved and regarded Indian people 
as almost less than human, savages 
who needed to be segregated or termi-
nated. Pratt, however, was of another 
mind and believed in the noble cause of 
assimilating Native Americans, and his 
mission was to civilize Indians and as-
similate them into mainstream Amer-
ican society. While Pratt may not have 
intended to be malevolent, the policies 
and practices that were carried out 
under his name and Federal mission 
tore 
thousands 
of 
Native 
families 
apart. 
The impact of these actions author-
ized by our government upon Native 
American people and cultures is some-
thing that we never can truly make 
whole. In many respects, Native cul-
tures were gutted by the impact and 
loss of Native children, and that is 
something that we as American people 
need to acknowledge, learn from, and 
reckon with in order to support Indian 
self-determination and healing. 
In 1886, a government report about 
the progress of Indian boarding schools 
stated that isolating Native children 
from their families was the key. The 
report stated: 
If it be admitted that education affords the 
true solution to the Indian problem, then it 
must be admitted that the boarding school is 
the very key to the situation. 
It went on to say: 
Only by complete isolation of the Indian 
child from his savage antecedents can he be 
satisfactorily educated. 
It wouldn’t be until a 1969 Kennedy 
report that found Indian education had 
failed and was a national tragedy that 
the Federal Government would look to 
begin improving Native American edu-
cation policies. I think Samuel Torres, 
of 
the 
National 
Native 
American 
Boarding School Healing Coalition, 
said it well when he said: 
If we can’t name the trauma, if we don’t 
know the extent and scope of that trauma, 
we’ll never heal from it. 
So as we are looking to the future 
and continuing our mission of edu-
cating people about America’s painful 
past treatment of so many Native 
American people, I would ask that you 
consider remembering the names of the 
children who were lost, like Sophia 
Tetoff, and start weaving the names of 
these innocent Native children into our 
collective memory. 
If we are going to accurately account 
for our history and truly support indig-
enous people, we need to include Native 
children in this narrative towards heal-
ing—say their names, remember their 
Tribes, and acknowledge the survivors 
and the families who are still with us. 
Mr. President, before I conclude, I 
want to mention that, to mark the sig-
nificance of this day, I have introduced 
a concurrent resolution designating 
September 30, 2021, as a national day of 
remembrance for the Native American 
children who have died while attending 
a U.S. boarding school and to recognize 
and honor the survivors of Indian 
boarding schools and their families. 
Now, my resolution is not meant to 
serve as a solution or an answer or 
even a long-overdue apology; it, in-
stead, seeks to honor the lives of the 
many Native children who died in In-
dian boarding schools and to recognize, 
support, and honor the survivors and 
their families and acknowledge the 
grief and the trauma that our country 
created, we condoned, and we codified. 
So my resolution is meant to open a 
door to the conversation and congres-
sional recognition of the atrocities 
that our government contributed to 
and the impact that it has had on so 
many. 
I know we are approaching Novem-
ber. It is usually when we recognize 
National Native American Heritage 
Month, but I think it is important that 
we remember every day, not only 
today, all those who fought to be here, 
especially our first peoples in this 
country. I would encourage all to look 
at our resolution and support and rec-
ognize September 30 for all of the Na-
tive American children who died while 
attending an Indian boarding school or 
survived the experience and are living 
to tell about it. 
We honor them, their Tribes, their 
parents, their families, and their com-
munities. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the 
Senate is currently taking up a nomi-
nee to the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment: Tracy Stone-Manning. There is a 
lot that I can say about Tracy Stone- 
Manning, but there are some key fea-
tures that come out if you are going to 
deal with the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. 
You walk into a leadership role 
where you have thousands of people 
working under you and around you, 
and you have care for the forests, and 
you have care for a lot of things that 
are running our environment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6828 
September 30, 2021 
This particular leader was involved, 
when she was in college, in a group 
that was gathering to be able to spike 
trees. She has admitted that she is the 
one who actually wrote the letter to be 
able to actually lay out what they had 
done, where they drove a spike into 
some trees, intentionally designed to 
be able to threaten loggers who would 
come through that area; that if they 
actually put a chain saw to that, there 
is a decent chance it would break the 
chain and it would come at the logger 
or that if they put that log in a saw-
mill, it would split the bandsaw and 
throw debris across all the workers 
who are there. To be clear, tree spiking 
is an act of ecoterrorism. 
Now, this individual will be voted on 
by this body to lead the Bureau of 
Land Management. I wish I could say 
that was the only issue that was there, 
but as you read through her writings— 
she wrote multiple different things 
about 
dealing 
with 
environmental 
issues, but one of the things that were 
most painful to me to be able to read 
was a section that she wrote where she 
had a picture of a child, and in the pic-
ture of the child, it said: ‘‘This is the 
greatest environmental threat that we 
face’’—children. In her philosophy, the 
world has too many kids, and the way 
that we can protect the environment is 
to have fewer children in the world. I 
happen to think children are a bless-
ing, not an environmental threat. 
But this body is about to vote on put-
ting Tracy Stone-Manning to lead the 
Bureau of Land Management. 
WORLD AFFAIRS 
Mr. President, I wish I could say that 
is the only issue that is actually mov-
ing right now. As I turn and look 
around the world, there are so many 
issues and things that are going on 
right now. 
Turkey has actually announced that 
they are going to buy more Russian 
missiles. They are completely ignoring 
what is going on. 
France is furious with the United 
States right now and feels like the 
United States stabbed them in the 
back in forming an alliance without 
them—withdrawing their Ambassador, 
which is the first they have done in 
centuries with the United States, be-
cause that is a broken relationship 
with France. 
We have put sanctions on individuals. 
I wish I could tell you it was due to a 
Russian pipeline, but no—those sanc-
tions were pulled. I wish I could tell 
you it was on Turkey for actually buy-
ing Russian surface-to-air missiles, but 
no—that hasn’t been done. We have 
added sanctions onto the Attorney 
General of Guatemala. Attorney Gen-
eral Porras, they are saying, is corrupt, 
although she is actually trying to ad-
dress corruption in her country. 
I wish I could tell you that is even 
the only issue we are dealing with. In 
Afghanistan, the Taliban has now an-
nounced their new leader for the 
Taliban in Afghanistan, Mullah Mu-
hammad Hassan, who is a U.N.-sanc-
tioned individual. That is the transi-
tion to the new government that we 
are going to work with, where hundreds 
of Americans still remain because they 
were left behind. 
In Iran, it doesn’t get any better. In 
Iran, they just announced again that 
they are not going to allow the IAEA 
inspectors to be able to come in and to 
deal with cameras in the centrifuge 
sites. They continue to be able to stiff- 
arm the world and to say that is what 
they are going to do, and there seem to 
be no new consequences for Iran. But 
there is for the Attorney General of 
Guatemala, but not in other areas. 
In the Armed Services Committee 
this week, the top brass for the United 
States made it very clear that they had 
recommended to the President leaving 
2,500 troops in Afghanistan. When the 
President announced, ‘‘No one ever 
told me that,’’ the top leadership all 
said they made it clear. 
I wish I could even tell you that is 
the only issue going on with the mili-
tary right now, but many people don’t 
know that President Biden, just a cou-
ple of weeks ago, fired every appointee 
from the Trump administration time 
period that President Trump put in for 
the Board of Visitors for all of our 
academies—the Naval Academy, West 
Point, Air Force—just cleared them 
all. It wasn’t based on their qualifica-
tions; it was just if Trump appointed 
them, they are all bad—and cleared all 
of those appointees from every single 
academy board. 
By the way, that has never been done 
by any President, ever. Just clear the 
deck. If Trump said they are good, they 
must be bad. 
On the southern border, we all know 
full well what is happening in the 
chaos that is there, as we have now 
topped well over a million individuals 
that we have interdicted from over 100 
different countries that have crossed 
our southwest border illegally. And the 
number, I would love to tell you, of 
those that have been allowed to able to 
come into the country, except DHS 
won’t tell us that number for months. 
Federal courts have stepped in and 
have told the Biden administration 
they have to reimpose the MPP process 
that President Trump put in that dra-
matically dropped the number of peo-
ple coming to our southwest border il-
legally. The Federal courts instructed 
the Biden administration a month ago 
that they have to put that back in 
place. And so far, the Biden adminis-
tration has said: We are thinking about 
it; we are examining it—and won’t even 
release a timeline to be able to follow 
the Federal court. 
Now, it is one thing for the Biden ad-
ministration to be angry at Congress, 
but currently, they are ignoring a Fed-
eral court order. That is a whole dif-
ferent issue on our democracy. 
Afghan evacuees have one set of 
standards to be able to come in; people 
on the southwest border have an en-
tirely different set. And in the middle 
of it, there is an ongoing dialogue 
about vaccine mandates for every 
American. The President gave a speech 
and dropped a mandate and said: Ev-
eryone that works in a company that 
has 100 people or more has to get the 
vaccine. It is his requirement. 
Now, he has yet to give the legal au-
thority for that. In fact, they have yet 
to put out a single document from the 
Department of Labor. They just put a 
deadline date out there, and they are 
asking every company to be able to im-
plement it simply based off his speech. 
The President cannot just give a 
speech and mandate to the country 
what to do. That is not how a rep-
resentative republic works, but yet 
that is what is happening. It is even 
more chaos among Federal workers and 
among Federal contractors because 
they did the same mandate to them. 
But, quite frankly, agency to agency, 
they are trying to figure out what do. 
And one agency handles it one way, 
and another agency is handling it com-
pletely different because no instruc-
tions have come down from the Office 
of Personnel Management and the Of-
fice of Management and Budget. 
They have failed to be able to put out 
the most basic instructions, so there is 
chaos. And, literally, we—I have indi-
viduals that are Federal contractors 
saying: We are just not going to do 
Federal contracting anymore on this— 
or they can’t complete a contract be-
cause so many people within their com-
pany have said: I am not going to take 
the vaccine. I have already had COVID. 
I have natural immunity. I am not 
going to do it. 
Currently, the President has only 
given a speech. And whether it is the 
National Guard that only has 40 per-
cent of the Guard vaccinated or wheth-
er it is in private companies, the chaos 
is running around the entire country. 
As people that are vaccinated like me 
encourage others to be vaccinated and 
say: I am glad that I have been vac-
cinated, and I am glad that I have the 
vaccine, others are saying: You know 
what, I am an American; why are you 
making me take this; why am I going 
to lose my job if I can’t do this? 
I have talked to union employees 
that work in Federal unions that are 
saying: Why isn’t my union protecting 
me? My union seems to be capitulating 
instead of actually helping me, I 
thought my union was supposed to rep-
resent me. But yet union bosses are 
telling their union members: We are 
not going to listen to you this time; we 
are going to listen to the President in-
stead of you as a union member. 
And I have talked to quite a few that 
are really ticked off because this was 
not 
in 
their 
collective 
bargaining 
agreement. And they are wanting to 
know when their voice actually gets 
heard. I will tell you, I don’t know 
when their voice actually gets heard 
because they have been locked out. 
All of those things are happening all 
around the world. And on the other 
side of the building, they are working 
on fighting over an infrastructure bill

September 30, 2021 
and a $3.5-trillion social welfare enti-
tlement bill that they are working to 
be able to move through as the left and 
the uber-left fight about how much 
they can spend today. The $3.5-trillion 
bill that is out there has an enormous 
cost. But, quite frankly, the content of 
the bill is more dangerous than the 
cost. 
I remember full well in the 1990s 
President Clinton standing in front of 
the Nation and saying: We are going to 
end welfare as we know it—and his 
statements about the welfare experi-
ment that we have had for decades to 
be able to send cash payments out to 
individuals we now know doesn’t work. 
We need to incentivize work. We need 
to incentivize individuals so that indi-
viduals are able to rise. 
Shockingly, in this $3.5 trillion enti-
tlement bill, they are literally going 
back to welfare as we once had it, rath-
er than ending welfare as we know it. 
They are returning to just checks rath-
er than encouraging jobs. 
We have seen already what that 
looks like in our economy just this 
year when in March, April, May, June 
so many States had such a hard time 
hiring individuals because individuals 
were getting just enough money to be 
able to get by. And so employers were 
trying to hire people, but people are 
saying: As long as I can get by, I am 
just going to be able to get by. 
And we watched company after com-
pany struggle to be able to actually 
bring staff on. We watched lots of res-
taurants cut their hours. We watched 
lots of stores cut their hours because 
they couldn’t get enough staff. That is 
the plan for this $3.5-trillion bill: to cut 
more checks to more individuals, to 
make it even harder to be able to func-
tion in our economy. 
And it is not just that; it is through-
out the bill. They changed the way 
that the Affordable Care Act funding is 
even done. According to the Kaiser 
Family 
Foundation 
study 
that 
is 
tracking all of these changes, a family 
of two adults with a 5-year-old child 
with an annual income of $100,000 will 
now get $10,500 a year in additional 
subsidies. A family of $100,000, they are 
going to give an additional $10,500 per 
year. 
That is not the only issue as well. 
Dramatic change in preschool entitle-
ments, $450 billion they want to spend 
on this massive childcare and preschool 
entitlement program—and that all may 
sound great like we need do more. Why 
aren’t they engaging in things like 
Head Start and some of the child devel-
opment block grants? They are ignor-
ing those to do an even bigger new pro-
gram. 
It is fascinating to me. In the budget 
documents they put out, they continue 
to attack the most basic issue of life. 
While they do childcare spending in 
one hand and say, We really want to 
help children, if you are a baby in the 
womb, you have no chance under their 
bill. 
If you are a child that they can see, 
they want to do $450 billion in new en-
titlement programs. But if you are 
child in the womb, the bill is full of ad-
ditional incentives to increase abortion 
in America and to do taxpayer-funded 
abortion in America. 
I have to tell you, I saw a New York 
Times article just recently that had a 
line where they were talking about 
abortion and encouraging abortion, and 
they were talking about the new Texas 
law dealing with abortion and life. And 
they added into it, ‘‘I think a majority 
of women are being sentenced to being 
parents’’—‘‘sentenced 
to 
being 
par-
ents.’’ How about welcoming a child 
and seeing them for who they are? 
This bill includes a methane fee that 
will kill the oil and gas industry in my 
State and around the country. This bill 
includes a new clean electricity per-
formance program, which will drive up 
the cost of electricity for every single 
American. If you think your electricity 
bill was expensive this summer, wait 
until the Clean Electricity Perform-
ance Program comes in and see how 
much your summer electricity bill is. 
Oh, but don’t worry: If you plug in 
your electric vehicle—if you are get-
ting an electric vehicle, they are going 
to give you a $12,500-tax credit if you 
get an electric vehicle—if it is pro-
duced in a union shop, because appar-
ently union shops are more carbon- 
friendly, I guess. They don’t say that. 
There is no requirement for that. 
It is not about a cleaner environ-
ment. It is just an extra perk to the 
unions on that and a shot to anyone 
who does production in a State that is 
nonunionized or a nonunion shop— 
$12,500 that they want to be able to pay 
towards an electric vehicle. And that is 
not just for some; that is for most 
every American would get that. 
It includes massive new subsidies for 
solar and for wind, even though wind 
and solar can make money right now, 
but because it is so expensive to do the 
transmission lines from far distances, 
they are including massive new sub-
sidies for that. 
They create $3 billion for the Civilian 
Climate Corps to be able to pay young 
people to do climate activism all 
around the country, so those folks that 
are climate activists will actually be 
paid for with your tax dollars. 
It includes what the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation states that tax-
payers—get this—at all income levels 
will see a tax increase under this bill— 
all income levels. Forty different tax 
hikes, over $2 trillion in tax increases 
that they have announced—it will cost 
zero dollars. We are going to spend $3.5 
trillion, and it will have absolutely no 
cost, except that Joint Tax has already 
looked at it and said: All taxpayers 
will have a tax hit on this. 
In addition to that, companies in the 
United States will have one of the 
highest tax rates in the entire world. 
Just basic economics: When you are 
trying to compete, do you want to have 
a lower price or a higher price? Just 
basic economics. If the United States is 
going to compete with China, should 
we have a lower tax rate than Com-
munist China or a higher one? 
According to this bill, the United 
States will have a higher tax rate than 
Communist China on our businesses. I 
don’t know of anyone that thinks that 
is a good idea other than the folks that 
are voting to increase taxes dramati-
cally on the American people. 
And for folks that continue to say, 
Well, it is only on corporations, and 
they think it is Apple and Ford and 
Conoco, you know what?—when you 
talk about corporations, 1.4 million 
small businesses are organized as C 
corps. Over 84 percent of C corps have 
20 employees or less. So if you think 
this is all about the big boys, oh, just 
wait. 
Not only that, in their tax policy, 
they include new marriage penalties to 
disincentivize marriage in America—or 
if you get married and file jointly, you 
are going to pay more taxes. 
It includes new enforcement from the 
IRS. Initially, it was a talk about $600. 
If you deposit or withdraw $600 from 
your bank account, then we are going 
to do new enforcement. That is going 
to have to get turned into the IRS. 
Then they changed it because they fig-
ured out people get nervous with that. 
So now, they are talking about if you 
do $10,000 of additions or subtractions 
in your bank account in a year, then 
we are going to track you. 
Can I tell you, almost every Amer-
ican in their bank account puts in 
$10,000 in or out in the year. If you 
make $12,000 in a year and deposit a 
check in your bank account, you will 
be turned into the IRS with your trans-
actions. 
This is a new way to be able to har-
vest data from every single American 
and turn it over to the IRS that is 
leaking information like a sieve cur-
rently, as information is being leaked 
out from ProPublica to be able to just 
release Americans’ tax returns. At the 
same time, my Democratic colleagues 
are saying, We want the IRS to have 
even more data. 
And if you don’t capitulate to the 
vaccine mandate, well, guess what, the 
$3.5-trillion new bill increases OSHA 
fines for you 10 times higher than what 
they used to be—10 times higher than 
what it used to be. 
This is about caving to their will. 
Yeah, there are a lot of things in this 
bill, and I didn’t even touch the hem of 
the garment on how many things are in 
it. 
We need to be engaged as Americans. 
And we need to know what is actually 
being proposed by this body and by this 
President and to be able to see the re-
sults of that worldwide. 
It is time for us to engage and to stay 
informed, and it is time for this body 
to consider, Is that really where the 
American people are? Is this really 
what the American people want? I can 
assure you, in Oklahoma, it is not. 
I yield the floor.

September 30, 2021 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 15 minutes and allowed 
to use a prop; and that, when I finish, 
Senator TESTER be allowed to speak for 
up to 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the 
Senate should emphatically oppose the 
nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to 
lead the Nation’s Bureau of Land Man-
agement. 
It is hard to believe, but she has 
colluded with ecoterrorists, plain and 
simple. She stonewalled a criminal in-
vestigation for years. She lied to the 
Senate, and she still holds radically 
dangerous views; and yet she is still 
the nominee of the President of the 
United States for this very important 
post. It is outrageous. 
Let’s 
begin 
with 
her 
ties 
to 
ecoterrorists. We worry about ter-
rorism in this world and in this coun-
try. By her own admission in her court 
testimony, when she was in graduate 
school, 
she 
collaborated 
with 
ecoterrorists who had hammered hun-
dreds of metal spikes into trees in a na-
tional forest. It was in Idaho. 
Tree spiking involves hammering a 
metal rod, like this one, into a tree 
trunk. This can do serious damage. 
They put about 500 pounds of these in 
tree trunks in a national forest. If a 
logger or firefighter cuts this rod—you 
say, Why would a firefighter be there? 
They have chainsaws and they work to 
clear areas to try to fight fires, or a 
logger taking down trees—the saw will 
shatter, shrapnel will fly in every di-
rection, and the user of that saw could 
become terribly injured or even killed. 
If a sawblade comes across a spike like 
this in a sawmill, the saw can explode. 
The results could be catastrophic to 
both life and limb. 
Well, ecoterrorists who spike trees 
absolutely know what they are doing. 
It is always premeditated. Even the 
Washington Post has labeled tree spik-
ing as one of the most vicious tactics 
of the ecoterrorists. That is what we 
are dealing with President Biden’s 
nominee to be the Director of Bureau 
of Land Management. 
You say: What is her connection to 
this horrible, horrible practice? 
Well, she has admitted that she edit-
ed, typed, and then anonymously sent 
a threat letter to the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice on behalf of known tree spikers. 
She and her Democrat defenders have 
claimed this letter was a warning so no 
one would get hurt. That is false. 
Here are just a few quotes from the 
letter she typed and she mailed to the 
U.S. Forest Service: 
You bastards go in there anyway and a lot 
of people could get hurt. 
And: 
I would be more than willing to pay you a 
dollar for the sale, but you would have to 
find me first and that could be your WORST 
nightmare. 
Think about these lines. Think about 
what it must be like if you had re-
ceived such a letter. She mailed this 
threatening letter to the target of the 
tree spiking—and that was the U.S. 
Forest 
Service—because 
she 
didn’t 
want any trees in that area to be har-
vested. 
She and her circle of friends were in-
vestigated for their involvement with 
this ecoterrorist network and the at-
tack. She was subpoenaed. She had to 
give hair samples, palm sample, hand-
writing, fingerprint samples to inves-
tigators. 
All this time, she knew who the tree 
spikers were. She could have gone to 
the authorities to identify them, but 
she refused, didn’t cooperate with in-
vestigators. The lead investigator on 
the case wrote a letter to Chairman 
MANCHIN and to me after she had testi-
fied in the Senate to the Energy Com-
mittee, and he referred to her as the 
‘‘nastiest of the suspects.’’ 
He also said she not only had knowl-
edge of the plan to spike the trees with 
spikes like this, she was one of the 
planners. She was a ringleader. The 
lead investigator in the criminal case 
wrote: 
It became clear that Ms. Stone-Manning 
was an active member of the original group 
that planned the spiking of the Post Office 
timber sale. 
Now, he wasn’t the only one who said 
she knew about it in advance. In an 
interview recently, within the last cou-
ple of months, with the E&E News, one 
of the convicted tree spikers, one of 
those who went to jail for doing this, 
he also confirmed that Tracy Stone- 
Manning, the President’s nominee to 
run the Bureau of Land Management, 
to be in charge of the national forests— 
that Tracy Stone-Manning knew of the 
plan to spike the trees well in advance. 
This was premeditated. 
So who have we heard from? 
We heard from the criminal who is in 
jail—went to jail. We heard from the 
cop who prosecuted the case. Both the 
cop and the criminal agree that she 
was involved and she knew about the 
plan to spike the trees. 
According to the investigator’s let-
ter, Ms. Stone-Manning’s lack of co-
operation would set back the investiga-
tion for years. From 1990 until the end 
of 1992, the case went cold. Remember, 
she knew who spiked the trees. She was 
protecting the ecoterrorists’ identities 
the entire time. 
Eventually, Ms. Stone-Manning was 
identified, and she received an inves-
tigation target letter to let her know 
she was being targeted as part of the 
investigation. The lead investigator 
said she only agreed to testify after she 
was caught and after her lawyer nego-
tiated an immunity deal to testify. 
Her defenders have said she helped 
put the bad guys away. In fact, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee is one of the bad 
guys. She helped plan the tree spiking. 
She covered up the terrorist activity 
for years. She did not cooperate with 
the authorities, and she only testified 
after she was caught and received im-
munity. 
After all of this, she lied to the Com-
mittee about the incident. On a sworn 
affidavit in her Committee question-
naire, she said she was not the target 
of any investigation. We know that is a 
lie. We know she received a letter that 
she was a target of the investigation. 
She complained in the press about 
how degrading it was to be inves-
tigated. Then why did she tell us she 
was never investigated and told the 
press how bad it was and degrading to 
be investigated? 
She also admitted to the press that 
she could have been charged with a 
crime if not for her immunity deal. 
She also lied about her involvement 
in the tree spiking. I asked her di-
rectly: 
Did you have personal knowledge of, par-
ticipate in, or in any way directly or indi-
rectly support activities associated with the 
spiking of trees in any forest during your 
lifetime? 
And she replied ‘‘no.’’ 
She sent their letter. She knew the 
plan in advance. She knew their identi-
ties, and she refused to tell the au-
thorities. 
How is that not supporting activities 
associated with ecoterrorism and tree 
spiking? 
Finally, Senate Democrats are very 
quick to say this tree-spiking episode 
was decades ago, can’t be relevant any-
more, in spite of the fact that it is a 
Federal crime—as if collusion with ter-
rorists is just a youthful indiscretion. 
But she lied this year when she came 
to testify to the U.S. Senate. She lied 
to our committee and she lied to this 
institution. 
It is clear to me that her radical 
views have not changed. In September 
of 2020, 1 year ago, she tweeted an arti-
cle written by her husband that calls— 
because she would be in charge of areas 
related to the forest—retweeted an ar-
ticle by her husband that calls for 
homes in forests to be left to burn dur-
ing wildfires. 
Senator SULLIVAN talked about the 
fires in Alaska. We have had fires in 
Wyoming. We have firefighters in there 
protecting structures and human life. 
Her husband says: Let them burn. 
Her husband wrote: 
There’s a rude and satisfying justice in 
burning down the house of someone who 
builds in the forest. 
‘‘Rude and satisfying justice in burn-
ing down’’ someone’s home. 
Tracy Stone-Manning isn’t respon-
sible for the views of her husband, but 
a year ago—not as graduate student 
decades ago—we are talking now, as 
wildfires burn across the country, she 
actually endorsed her husband’s views 
on letting the houses burn. In a tweet, 
she called her husband’s writing a 
‘‘clarion call.’’ 
Well, clarion call, if you look it up, 
means a call to action. 
As the Director of the Bureau of 
Land Management, Tracy Stone-Man-
ning would be in charge of firefighting 
operations on public lands. Yet her 
husband and the things she retweets 
say: Let it burn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6831 
September 30, 2021 
Apparently, she is comfortable leav-
ing the houses and homes of our con-
stituents in the Rocky Mountain West 
to burn because they built their homes 
in the forest. I have constituents who 
have homes in the forest. I am sure al-
most every Senator does. This tweet 
wasn’t 30 years ago. This tweet was 1 
year ago. 
Who actually thinks her beliefs are 
different today? 
Her views on firefighting are just the 
tip of the iceberg. In her graduate the-
sis, she actually argued that Ameri-
cans need to have fewer children. You 
know why? Because she says children 
are a threat to the environment. She 
actually 
called 
children 
‘‘environ-
mental hazards.’’ 
Can you find the environmental hazard in 
this photo? 
She told her readers to ‘‘stop at one 
or two.’’ 
She even made ads like this one to 
promote these ideas, the child as an en-
vironmental hazard. And she is the 
nominee of the President of the United 
States for an important position in 
this government. 
She answered her own question by 
saying: Oh, yes, you can find the envi-
ronmental hazard, ‘‘that’s right, it’s 
the cute baby.’’ 
This thesis isn’t the only time she ar-
gued for human population control. In 
an essay in the High Country News, she 
said Americans were ‘‘breeding our 
weapons’’ in the war on the grizzly 
bear. She concludes that essay by say-
ing: ‘‘We should wage war on over-
population.’’ 
These are ideas you hear in com-
munist China, not from the nominee to 
be the Director of the Bureau of Land 
Management in the United States. 
Mr. President, there are many quali-
fied Democrats who could run the Bu-
reau of Land Management and do a fine 
job of it. We should reject this nomina-
tion, and the President can nominate 
someone else. 
It is astonishing to me to see Demo-
crats digging in to defend a proven liar, 
an ecoterrorist collaborator who still 
holds very dangerous and threatening 
beliefs. 
Bob Abbey was the BLM Director 
under President Barack Obama. He 
said her actions ‘‘should disqualify 
her’’ from leading this important Agen-
cy. One Biden administration official 
admitted on NBC News her nomination 
was a ‘‘massive vetting failure.’’ So 
Obama’s BLM Director said she should 
be disqualified—her actions should dis-
qualify her—and a Biden administra-
tion official calls it a ‘‘massive vetting 
failure.’’ 
And when our Committee asked the 
Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland, about 
Stone-Manning’s views, her response 
was: ‘‘I didn’t nominate her.’’ 
Well, no, she didn’t. The President of 
the United States did. This is clearly 
not a rousing endorsement coming 
from 
fellow 
Democrats—the 
White 
House, former BLM Director under 
President Obama, and now the Sec-
retary of Interior. 
If she is confirmed, Senate Demo-
crats will be held wholly responsible. 
They should consider carefully if they 
want their name associated with Tracy 
Stone-Manning. Tracy Stone-Manning 
should never be the Director of the Bu-
reau of Land Management. 
I strongly oppose her nomination. 
Every Republican—every Republican— 
strongly opposes her nomination, and 
Senate Democrats should do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. I want to thank you, 
Mr. President, the fine Senator from 
Georgia, for the recognition. 
Look, I have been listening to the de-
bate here, or the conversation—how-
ever you want to say it—on the floor 
for the last hour and a half about 
Tracy Stone-Manning. 
I will tell you that I take advice and 
consent that the United States has, 
and the Members of this body has, very 
seriously. That means not just picking 
up talking points the leadership might 
give you and reciting them back on the 
floor time and time and time again— 
which, by the way, I heard the same 
talking points time and time and time 
again for the last hour and a half. But 
it is to find out what is going on with 
this person because it is our duty to 
make sure there are good people in 
these Agencies. 
I wish we had taken that same kind 
of thought with some of the folks 
President Trump put forth, but it 
seems, though, the rules have changed. 
Now we are going to take a good 
woman—a good woman—the State of 
Montana knows well. In fact, she was 
vetted in the State of Montana. They 
said all these accusations have no 
merit. We are going to run her through 
the ringer here—character assassina-
tion like I have never seen before. 
But let’s be honest. What is this real-
ly about? Is this about Tracy Stone- 
Manning? No. This is about the Repub-
licans in the Senate trying to make 
Joe Biden look bad. That is what this 
is about. Make no mistake about it— 
that is what this is about. 
So let’s get back to the issue at hand, 
and that is the person who has been 
nominated to run the BLM, Tracy 
Stone-Manning—somebody 
I 
have 
known for the last 25 years; somebody 
I have worked with for the last 20 
years; somebody who, when she was on 
my staff, worked with the wood prod-
ucts industry, worked with recreation 
folks—worked 
with 
everybody 
out 
there—to write a bill on how we could 
better manage our national forests 
with Montana input. 
She is somebody who lives by the 
statement ‘‘You have two ears and one 
mouth; act accordingly.’’ She is some-
body who knows the value of collabora-
tion. She is somebody who can listen, 
who can reason, and who knows our 
public lands and has recreated on our 
public lands for her entire life. 
She is somebody who will run the 
BLM in a hell of a lot better way than 
this dude by the name of Pendley, who 
sat in that office, unconfirmed, for 
months after months after months in 
the previous administration, and no-
body on the Republican side of the 
aisle said a thing about him. He is 
somebody who wanted to sell off our 
public lands, somebody who really 
didn’t care about access to them. 
But we have a person today we can 
confirm who can, once again, make the 
BLM the Agency it needs to be; some-
body who understands multiple use; 
somebody who understands that the 
BLM needs to be run by a professional. 
Tracy Stone-Manning is a professional. 
I would encourage everybody to vote 
for her. 
I thank the Presiding Officer.

IRON DOME 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it 
was my intention to come to the floor 
to ask unanimous consent for a $1 bil-
lion replenishment for Iron Dome. We 
Democrats believe that this is incred-
ibly important for the safety and secu-
rity of the State of Israel, our ally. 
Unfortunately, Senator PAUL, who 
has an amendment to my unanimous 
consent request, could not be here to-
night, and, as a courtesy to him, we are 
postponing until Monday, but on Mon-
day I intend to come to the floor and 
ask for that unanimous consent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague. 
Mr. President, so a few moments ago, 
the Senate voted to proceed to go into 
the House message on the debt ceiling 
suspension until December of 2022. For 
the information of all, this vote will 
only require a majority threshold and 
is a necessary procedural step before 
cloture can be filed on the House- 
passed legislation. 
Now, despite Republicans’ twisted 
logic for wanting the debt limit to be 
addressed while actively blocking that 
from happening, the basic facts have 
not changed. The debt must be ad-
dressed; it will be addressed; and Amer-
ica cannot default. 
We Democrats are not asking Repub-
licans to vote with us. If they want to 
vote to stop checks from going to vet-
erans and payments to Social Security 
recipients, they can do so. But what we 
are saying is simply the Republicans 
ought to get out of the way so Demo-
crats can suspend the debt limit. 
That is what Republicans have asked 
for. Leader MCCONNELL talked about 
that idea repeatedly on the floor over 
the last several weeks, and it is the 
best way to avoid financial catastrophe 
without 
endangering 
the 
American 
people.

TRIBUTE TO ANNE SEARS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, there 
is a lot going in the Senate, as we have 
been debating and voting on a number 
of 
things—important 
matters, 
no 
doubt—for 
the 
country. 
But 
that 
doesn’t mean that we are going to for-
get other important matters that we 
regularly take up here in the Senate. 
And what I am talking about, of 
course, is the Alaskan of the Week. 
Now, our pages are back, which is 
such great news. But you need to know 
this is one of the most exciting times 
in the Senate. Usually every Thursday 
I get an opportunity to come down here 
on the Senate floor and talk about 
somebody in Alaska who is making a 
difference. 
In fact, we talked about a Gold Medal 
Olympic athlete just a couple of weeks 
ago, making a huge difference for Alas-
ka, her community, the world, Amer-
ica. So we really enjoy this. We kind of 
have a cult following. But the pages 
really enjoy it because it is stories and 
adventure, all for the people who are 
doing wonderful things in my State. 
This week, on the actual day of her 
retirement from a long and rewarding 
career with the Alaska State Troopers, 
our Alaskan of the Week is Anne Sears. 
So before I talk about Anne and her 
extraordinary service to Alaska, about 
her being the first and only Alaskan 
Native female trooper, let me tell you 
a little bit about what is going on back 
home. 
In Wasilla, AK, where Anne recently 
moved—she was actually born in Nome; 
we will talk about that—the tempera-
ture 
has 
been 
in 
the 
midforties, 
twenties at night. The sun rose today 
at 8 a.m., sets at 7:30 p.m. You know, it 
moves fast in Alaska. We have already 
had several pretty good size snow-
storms. So winter is coming. Winter is 
coming—definitely coming to Alaska 
right now. 
But let’s get back to Anne. After dec-
ades of hard work as an Alaska State 
Trooper, it is time for Anne to settle 
into a new home, to rest, get some 
sleep, and think about her next steps— 
all of which she is planning on doing 
starting tomorrow because, today, she 
is retiring. 
So Anne Sears—well, let’s start with 
her mother Gladyce, who is from 
Nome. Gladyce actually left Nome for a 
little bit of time, moved to the lower 
48. And among other things, Gladyce, 
Anne’s mom, worked here in DC. She 
worked for Alaska Congressman Ralph 
Rivers. 
Most people don’t think we ever had 
any other Congressman but DON YOUNG 
because he has been there forever, but 
this was Congressman Ralph Rivers. 
And Gladyce, Anne’s mom, met her 
husband Cary, Anne’s father, who was 
an electrician in the Navy. But Cary 
and Gladyce decided to move back to 
Nome because they wanted to make 
sure Anne was going to be born in 
Nome, which she was.

S6834 
September 30, 2021 
So Gladyce, obviously, is a woman of 
ambition, and so was her daughter 
Anne. She passed that down to Anne. 
So after Anne was born and Cary, her 
father, left the Navy, he got a job as an 
electrician with the Federal Aviation 
Administration in Alaska, which took 
him and his family all around the 
State: Bethel, Kotzebue, Unalakleet— 
so many great villages in our rural 
part of Alaska. 
Now, eventually, they settled in Ju-
neau. And after high school, Anne got a 
job as a clerk for the Juneau Police De-
partment. All through her younger 
years, she knew she wanted to do some-
thing to help people. But it wasn’t 
until the tender age of 31 that her call-
ing came. 
As the clerk at the Juneau Police De-
partment, she decided: Hey, I can do 
this. 
So she took the test required to be-
come a police officer. Of course, a 
woman of this intelligence passed with 
flying colors, and she was offered the 
job. On the first day of on-the-job- 
training, Anne was in a police car, 
speeding to a site where a woman was 
hurt. She got there. She helped that 
woman. And her desire, motivation, to 
be a police officer was cemented. She 
was hooked. 
She met her future husband Jay at 
the police academy, and eventually, 
they became Alaska State Troopers as 
a couple—both of them working in 
rural Alaska together, where they had 
worked for over 15 years. 
It didn’t take Anne long to realize 
she was actually really good at her job. 
That is not being arrogant. She just 
knew. 
‘‘I could talk to people,’’ she said. 
‘‘Not being big and being a woman, 
you’ve got to use your words [in this 
job].’’ 
Anyone who has watched the reality 
show ‘‘Alaska State Troopers’’—now, 
there are a lot of Alaska reality shows, 
but anyone at home watching right 
now, if you have seen ‘‘Alaska State 
Troopers,’’ you will have seen Anne 
featured prominently in that series, 
and you will understand what she 
means when she talks about using her 
words. She is articulate. She is tough. 
She is firm. She is very clear, but she 
is also calming, which is what you need 
from a good officer. She is able to bring 
calm and ease to the most volatile sit-
uations and situations that can be ex-
traordinarily challenging for our law 
enforcement officers. 
Now, as some might have heard me 
talk about here on the floor, the hun-
dreds of small, rural villages in the hub 
communities of rural Alaska are lit-
erally the spiritual and cultural soul of 
my State. 
Like many areas across America, 
both urban and rural, rural Alaska also 
has many challenges. And one of them 
is that there is not enough public safe-
ty officers present in rural Alaska. We 
have dozens of communities with noth-
ing—no sheriff, no police officer, no 
trooper, no VPSO—nothing. 
It is a big issue. It is something I am 
certainly passionate about that we are 
all working on, more law enforcement 
presence in our rural communities. So 
being a law enforcement officer in 
rural Alaska, particularly in the hun-
dreds of villages that don’t have roads 
to get in and out of, can pose unique 
challenges. Anne has seen those chal-
lenges throughout her career. 
What are some of those? 
Well, first, you have to get to the vil-
lage, especially if it doesn’t even have 
an officer in the village when this is a 
crime or a challenge. That often re-
quires flying in a single-engine plane 
to a remote place in a giant State, in 
tough weather. Then when you get 
there, you have to figure out where you 
need to go. Sometimes, there is no fa-
cilities, no jail, no holding cell, no 
place to take people—maybe one city 
office, at the most. And then you have 
to figure out how to get into those of-
fices, which can be particularly chal-
lenging, particularly in the winter. 
When it is cold and dark, it might be 50 
below zero with the wind howling. 
So these are many, many of the chal-
lenges that Anne has dealt with. As she 
says: This is not ‘‘NCIS’’ or ‘‘Law and 
Order.’’ In rural Alaska, we have to do 
it all. 
Indeed, as a trooper, she has played 
many roles: a protector, an enforcer, a 
trooper, a friend, a confidant, a social 
worker. And she loved it all, and she 
was really good at it. Here is what she 
said: 
It was the best job I could have ever had 
and the hardest job I could have ever had. 
But I couldn’t have done it without my hus-
band, Jay, my sons, Hunter and Zachery, and 
my brother, Perry. 
Anne also credits the health aides 
and public safety officers, VPSOs, 
VPOs in these villages who have really, 
really important roles. 
One of the most difficult aspects of 
her job was handling cases of domestic 
violence and sexual assault. 
Now, I love my State. We are a great 
State. I come down on the floor once a 
week and brag about it with our Alas-
kan of the Week. But this is something 
we don’t like to brag about in Alaska: 
the horrific problems we have with do-
mestic violence, sexual assault, and the 
challenges 
that 
brings 
particularly 
with young people, too many people. 
But she has been very focused on 
these issues. Anne teamed up with 
local health providers to go into high 
schools, to give presentations about 
these horrible crimes, and talk about 
why it is wrong—this kind of abuse— 
and to try to change the culture of our 
State, which we need to keep focused 
on. 
She had groups and gatherings for 
parents too. She said mostly mothers 
would come and, heartbreakingly, al-
most inevitably tell stories of some of 
the victims and survivors of abuse that 
we have in our State. But she was 
undeterred. 
She said: If I could just touch one 
child on these kinds of crimes, to help 
them, I know I made a difference. 
Anne has made a difference—I would 
say a huge difference—for Alaska. 
Here is what fellow Trooper Bryan 
Barlow said about Anne’s service: ‘‘Her 
legacy as a caring, compassionate, and 
dedicated trooper and investigator has 
without a doubt made our State’’—the 
great State of Alaska—‘‘a much safer 
place.’’ 
James Cockrell, the commissioner of 
the Alaska Department of Public Safe-
ty, said that Anne’s dedication to rural 
Alaska was an extraordinary asset to 
the department’s mission to keep Alas-
kans safe. 
As I have said, Anne was the first fe-
male Alaskan Native trooper, but I 
guarantee you, she will not be the last. 
She has proved a role model for so 
many, a true trailblazer, an example 
that we need in Alaska and so many 
people look up to. 
Now, she hasn’t decided what the fu-
ture holds, but she is still young and 
still has the urge to help out. I have no 
doubt she is going to make a big im-
pact in other places, helping Alaskans. 
For now, though—you can tell this is a 
tough job—I think she needs a little 
rest and some sleep. 
So, thank you, Anne, for all you have 
done. Congratulations on your retire-
ment today. From the Alaska State 
Troopers: Thank you for being an in-
spiration, an example to so many in 
our great State. And, of course, con-
gratulations on being our Alaskan of 
the Week. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6838 
September 30, 2021 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT 
AND JOBS ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to discuss an important pro-
vision I authored in the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act. 
Section 40336 of the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, H.R. 3684, in-
cludes several provisions relating to 
the Act of June 29, 1940, 54 Stat. 703, 
chapter 460; 16 U.S.C. 835d et seq., that 
facilitated the construction of the 
Grand Coulee Dam. The portion of the 
Columbia River that flows through the 
Colville and Spokane Indian Reserva-
tions 
formerly 
supported 
abundant 
anadromous salmon fisheries that were 
significant culturally and nutritionally 
to the Confederated Tribes of the 
Colville Reservation and the Spokane 
Tribe of Indians. Upon completion of 
the Grand Coulee Dam in 1942, these 
fisheries were destroyed, and the Co-
lumbia River upstream of the Grand 
Coulee Dam was inundated by its res-
ervoir waters. In 1945, these reservoir 
waters were designated Franklin D. 
Roosevelt Lake and today are com-
monly referred to as Lake Roosevelt. 
The 1940 Act instructed the Secretary 
of the Interior to ‘‘set aside approxi-
mately one-quarter of the entire res-
ervoir area for the paramount use of 
the Indians of the Spokane and Colville 
Reservations for hunting, fishing, and 
boating purposes, which rights shall be 
subject only to such reasonable regula-
tions as the Secretary may prescribe 
for the protection and conservation of 
fish and wildlife . . . .’’ 16 U.S.C. 835d 
(emphasis added). Congress authorized 
the Secretary in the 1940 Act ‘‘to per-
form any and all acts and to prescribe 
such regulations as [it] may deem ap-
propriate’’ to protect these paramount 
use rights. 16 U.S.C. 835h. The portions 
of Lake Roosevelt ultimately set aside 
for the paramount use of the Colville 
and Spokane Tribes pursuant to the 
1940 Act are within the Colville and 
Spokane Reservations and are called 
the ‘‘Reservation Zone’’ of Lake Roo-
sevelt. 
In a 1945 Opinion, Interior Solicitor 
Warner Gardner interpreted the 1940 
Act and confirmed that the 1940 Act 
provided the Tribes ‘‘special rights’’ to 
hunt, fish and boat within the Reserva-
tion Zones. 59 I.D. 147 (Dec. 29, 1945). 
Solicitor Gardner also found that the 
Secretary has broad discretion to de-
termine how to protect the Tribes’ 
paramount rights, including the power 
to ‘‘give the Indians exclusive rights of 
hunting, fishing, and boating’’ in the 
Tribes’ respective Reservation Zones.’’ 
In 1990, Interior entered an agree-
ment with the Colville and Spokane 
Tribes establishing the framework for 
cooperative management of Lake Roo-
sevelt between the Tribes, Bureau of 
Reclamation, National Park Service 
and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The 
agreement, commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘S-Party Agreement,’’ provides for 
the Colville and Spokane Tribes to 
‘‘manage, plan and regulate all activi-
ties, development and uses that take 
place’’ within the Tribes’ applicable 
portion of the Reservation Zones. The 
5-Party Agreement also directs that 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs ‘‘shall as-
sist the tribes in carrying out the 
tribes’ management of the Reservation 
Zone, and undertake such other activi-
ties as are authorized by law in support 
of the tribes.’’ 
At the Tribes’ request, the Depart-
ment of the Interior and its agency 
stakeholders 
previously 
initiated 
a 
process to consider potential solutions, 
including various possible Federal ad-
ministrative actions to protect the 
Colville and Spokane Tribes’ para-
mount rights. This process involved 
government-to-government 
meetings 
and communications with both Tribes 
and with the State of Washington. The 
Department of the Interior considered 
several options, including rulemaking. 
A summary of the parties’ efforts in 
this regard were memorialized in a 
January 19, 2017, letter from Interior 
Solicitor Tompkins to the State of 
Washington and the Colville and Spo-
kane Tribes. 
The references to the Tribes’ para-
mount use rights in section 40336 are 
intended to reaffirm the 1940 act’s rec-
ognition of those rights and to recog-
nize that the Secretary of the Interior 
has both a federal trust responsibility 
and broad discretion to protect the 
Tribes’ paramount use rights. 
Thank you.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, un-
fortunately I was unable to attend the 
rollcall vote No. 389 on the confirma-
tion of Todd Robinson to be Assistant 
Secretary of State for International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs. Had I been able to attend, I would 
have voted in support of his nomina-
tion.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. MARK J. 
COCHRAN 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Mark J. Coch-
ran, who after almost 40 years of serv-
ice with the University of Arkansas 
System, is retiring today. 
In Dr. Cochran’s last role with the 
university he led the division of agri-
culture’s research and extension work 
as its vice president. The University of 
Arkansas System division of agri-
culture’s mission is to strengthen agri-
culture, communities, and families by 
connecting trusted research to the 
adoption of best practices. 
Dr. Cochran embodies that mission. 
So much so, that when it was an-
nounced that he would be stepping 
down, University of Arkansas System 
president Dr. Donald Bobbitt called Dr. 
Cochran ‘‘an unabashed cheerleader for 
Arkansas agriculture.’’ 
I would echo that descriptor and add 
that he has been an incredible partner 
in our efforts at the Federal level to 
ensure Arkansas producers remain on 
the leading edge; our rural commu-
nities remain strong; and the families 
that comprise them have opportunities 
to prosper. 
Agriculture is Arkansas’ largest in-
dustry, adding around $21 billion to our 
economy every year and accounting for 
approximately one in every six jobs. In 
order to reach and build upon that 
level of economic production, our pro-
ducers need to maintain a competitive 
advantage. 
Research 
provides 
that 
building block, and Dr. Cochran en-
sured the university is on the cutting- 
edge of it. Under Dr. Cochran’s leader-
ship, the University of Arkansas Sys-
tem division of agriculture helped 
guide this vital industry by providing 
science-based best practices and new 
technologies that led to advancements 
that benefit both producers and the en-
vironment. 
While remaining dedicated to our 
current 
agriculture 
community’s 
needs, Dr. Cochran also focused with 
equal intensity on cultivating and pre-
paring the next generation of Arkansas 
farmers and ranchers. In announcing 
his retirement, Dr. Cochran noted he is 
particularly proud of the impact the 
university has made on youth through 
its 4–H program and how that impact 
will carry into the future. 
During his tenure, Dr. Cochran devel-
oped a reputation as a well-respected 
advocate for Arkansas agriculture, our 
rural communities, and the families 
that call the Natural State home. His 
leadership at University of Arkansas 
System Division of Agriculture will be 
missed, but he left a legacy that will 
benefit Arkansas agriculture for years 
to come. It has been an honor to work 
with him during his tenure, and I wish 
him all the best in retirement.∑

ship, each week I recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize Kentucky Mist 
Moonshine, of Whitesburg, KY, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Kentucky Mist Moonshine is a family 
business nearly a century in the mak-
ing. In the 1920s, during Prohibition, 
Little Henry Holbrook started dis-
tilling and bootlegging corn liquor in 
the Appalachian Mountains. Despite a 
17-year stint in a Federal penitentiary, 
Henry continued bootlegging moon-
shine until he passed away in the 1980s. 
Decades later, in 2015, his grandson 
Colin Fultz decided to turn the Hol-
brook family tradition into a legal 
business. Using trade secrets and rec-
ipes passed down for generations, Colin 
perfected his family’s signature moon-
shine 
recipe 
for 
mass 
production.

government, he restored and outfitted 
a 
historic 
building 
in 
downtown 
Whitesburg to operate his craft dis-
tillery. In 2015, Kentucky Mist Moon-
shine opened its doors. 
Today, Kentucky Mist Moonshine is 
renowned for its moonshine, whiskey, 
and vodka. The company has grown at 
a significant clip, experiencing 105 per-
cent growth from 2019 to 2021. Fea-
turing over 12 varieties of moonshine, 
their spirits are made from an original 
recipe free of artificial flavors or addi-
tives. Their products are sold through-
out the United States and have drawn 
praise nationwide. Every batch is made 
in Kentucky under Colin’s watchful 
eye. The Kentucky Mist Moonshine 
team has grown to 15 employees and 
expanded to include 3 locations in Or-
ange Beach, AL, and North Myrtle 
Beach and Myrtle Beach, SC. Addition-
ally, the distillery supports local Ken-
tucky artisans and regional small busi-
nesses, selling hand-crafted goods at 
each of their locations. Uniquely, Ken-
tucky Mist Moonshine makes fruit-in-
fused moonshine and donates the fruit 
byproducts to local farmers for live-
stock feed. 
Like many small businesses, Colin is 
actively involved in his community. 
Kentucky Mist Moonshine is part of 
the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of 
Commerce, while Colin serves on the 
local board of tourism. Locally, Ken-
tucky Mist Moonshine has sponsored 
several Letcher County Central High 
School sports teams. They regularly 
participate 
in 
local 
and 
regional 
events, including the annual Mountain 
Heritage 
Festival. 
Kentucky 
Mist 
Moonshine is a member of the Ken-
tucky 
Distillers’ 
Association, 
Ken-
tucky’s premier bourbon and distilled 
spirits trade association. Their whis-
key, 
vodka, 
and 
moonshine 
have 
earned multiple awards at industry and 
trade shows. The company’s success 
has been profiled in several regional 
and industry publications. During the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Kentucky Mist 
Moonshine stepped up to manufacture 
hand sanitizer for local hospitals and 
clinics. 
During 
the 
summer, 
they 
hosted a series of concerts at their fa-
cility to support local artists and build 
community after a year of lockdowns. 
Kentucky Mist Moonshine is a re-
markable example of the resilience and 
adaptability of locally owned small 
businesses. Small businesses, like Ken-
tucky Mist Moonshine, form the heart 
of towns across Kentucky and play a 
critical role in Kentucky’s bourbon and 
whiskey industry. Congratulations to 
Colin and the entire team at Kentucky 
Mist Moonshine. I wish them the best 
of luck, and I look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

flation which results from this policy, is the 
greatest threat which faces our nation, we 
firmly believe that constitutional restraint 
is necessary to bring the fiscal discipline 
needed to restore fiscal responsibility’’; and

‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary shall 
make a determination about whether a fish-

has occurred, whether the fishery resource 
disaster was due to— 
‘‘(i) a natural cause; 
‘‘(ii) an anthropogenic cause; 
‘‘(iii) a combination of a natural cause and 
an anthropogenic cause; or 
‘‘(iv) an undetermined cause.

sult in a positive determination that a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred, based on 
the information provided or analyzed under 
paragraph (4)(B).

cent shall be evaluated to determine whether 
economic impacts are severe enough to de-
clare that a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred. 
‘‘(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not 
be eligible for a determination that a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred. 
‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred, the Secretary shall con-
sider the economic impacts to the charter 
fishing industry to ensure financial coverage 
for charter fishing businesses.

ject to overfishing in any of the 3 years pre-
ceding the date of a determination under 
this subsection is not eligible for a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred unless the Secretary de-
termines that overfishing was not a contrib-
uting factor to the fishery resource disaster. 
‘‘(D) EXCEPTIONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.—In an 
exceptional circumstance where substantial 
economic impacts to the affected fishery and 
fishing community have been subject to a 
disaster declaration under another statutory 
authority, such as in the case of a natural 
disaster or from the direct consequences of a 
Federal action taken to prevent, or in re-
sponse to, a natural disaster for purposes of 
protecting life and safety, the Secretary may 
determine a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred without a request. 
‘‘(6) DISBURSAL OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS.—

OF
DEADLINE.—The Sec-
retary may extend the deadline under clause 
(i) by 90 days to evaluate and make deter-
minations on eligible requests.

SENATE RESOLUTION 398—DESIG-
NATING 
SEPTEMBER 
2021 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
KINSHIP 
CARE 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. 
BROWN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.: 
S. RES. 398 
Whereas in September 2021, ‘‘National Kin-
ship Care Month’’ is observed; 
Whereas nationally, 2,800,000 children are 
living in kinship care with grandparents, 
other relatives, and family friends (‘‘fictive 
kin’’); 
Whereas, according to the Federal Inter-
agency Forum on Child and Family Statis-
tics, in 2019, 1,700,000 children were cared for 
by grandparents, 651,000 by other relatives, 
and 481,000 by nonrelatives who are not fos-
ter parents; 
Whereas nationally, nearly 1⁄3 of all foster 
care placements are in kinship foster care, 
with more than 133,000 children placed in 
kinship foster care; 
Whereas more than 2,600,000 children live 
in informal kinship care outside of the foster 
care system; 
Whereas ‘‘kinship’’ is the term used to de-
scribe the relationship between children and 
nonparent relative caregivers in recent fed-
eral enactments of law, including in the Con-
solidated Appropriations Acts enacted for 
each of fiscal years 2018 through 2021, in the 
COVID–19 response provisions of the Consoli-
dated Appropriations Act, 2021, and in the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; 
Whereas in over 40 States, more than 300 
State statutes that use the term ‘‘kinship’’ 
and there are more than 15 references to that 
term in the federal child welfare laws con-
tained in title 42 of the United States Code; 
Whereas while kinship care is the most 
common term for relative caregivers of chil-
dren, they are sometimes also referred to as 
kincaregivers or grandfamilies; 
Whereas federally-funded kinship navi-
gator programs and kinship guardian pro-
grams operate in over 40 States; 
Whereas the number of children placed in 
foster care continues to increase due in part 
to the opioid crisis, and child welfare agen-
cies are increasingly reliant on grandparents 
and other kinship caregivers; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
kinship caregivers, who are often grand-
parents with health vulnerabilities, are par-
enting children in their homes, often with 
limited support; 
Whereas kinship or relative care can be a 
critical 
tool 
in 
addressing 
disproportionality; 
Whereas African American and Hispanic 
children are more likely to be placed in kin-
ship care (32 percent and 48 percent, respec-
tively), than are White children (27 percent) 
and past evidence, such as reports and testi-
mony to Congress by the Government Ac-
countability Office and other research, sug-
gests that kinship care is an important prac-
tice in reducing disproportionality; 
Whereas kinship caregivers residing in 
urban, rural, and suburban households in 
every State and territory of the United 
States have stepped forward out of love and 
loyalty to care for children during times in 
which parents are unable to do so; 
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, 
promote well-being, and establish stable 
households for vulnerable children; 
Whereas kinship care homes offer a refuge 
for traumatized children;

Whereas kinship care enables a child to 
maintain family relationships and cultural 
heritage and remain in the community of the 
child; 
Whereas the wisdom and compassion of 
kinship caregivers is a source of self-reliance 
and strength for countless children and for 
the entire United States; 
Whereas children in kinship care experi-
ence improved placement stability, higher 
levels of permanency, and decreased behav-
ioral problems; 
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting 
challenges to keep children from entering 
foster care; 
Whereas, because of parental substance use 
disorders and other adverse childhood experi-
ences, children in kinship care frequently 
have trauma-related conditions; 
Whereas many kinship caregivers give up 
their retirement years to assume parenting 
duties for children; 
Whereas the Senate wishes to honor the 
many kinship caregivers who throughout the 
history of the United States have provided 
loving homes for children; 
Whereas the first President of the United 
States, George Washington, and his wife 
Martha were themselves kinship caregivers, 
as were many other great people of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize 
the many kinship care families in which a 
child is raised by grandparents, other rel-
atives, or fictive kin; 
Whereas National Kinship Care Month pro-
vides an opportunity to urge people in every 
State to join in recognizing and celebrating 
kinship caregiving families and the tradition 
of families in the United States to help kin; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress provided for 
kinship navigator programs and services in 
the Family First Prevention Services Act 
enacted under title VII of division E of the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2018; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress provided for the 
formation of the Advisory Council to Sup-
port Grandparents Raising Grandchildren to 
examine supports for grandparents and other 
kinship caregivers in the Supporting Grand-
parents Raising Grandchildren Act; 
Whereas, since 2018, Congress has contin-
ued to support kinship families by renewing 
funding for kinship navigators in the Con-
solidated Appropriations Acts, enacted for 
each of fiscal years 2018 through 2021, pro-
viding flexibility for how such funds may be 
used in the COVID–19 response provisions of 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, 
and implementing the National Technical 
Assistance 
Center 
on 
Kinship 
and 
Grandfamilies in the American Rescue Plan 
Act of 2021; 
Whereas more remains to be done to sup-
port kinship caregiving and to ensure that 
all children have a safe, loving, nurturing, 
and permanent family, regardless of age or 
special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Kinship Care Month’’; 
(2) encourages Congress, States, local gov-
ernments, and community organizations to 
continue to work to improve the lives of vul-
nerable children and families and to support 
the communities working together to lift 
them up; 
(3) urges all States to expand their support 
of kinship care and their use of kinship fos-
ter care: and 
(4) honors the commitment and dedication 
of kinship caregivers and the advocates and 
allies who work tirelessly to provide assist-
ance and services to kinship caregiving fami-
lies.

‘‘NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER

Mr. 
MANCHIN 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina, Mr. REED, 
Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. CASEY, Mr. GRAHAM, 
and Mr. HAWLEY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 400 
Whereas each year more than 15,500 chil-
dren under the age of 19 in the United States 
are diagnosed with cancer; 
Whereas every year more than 1,700 chil-
dren in the United States lose their lives to 
cancer; 
Whereas childhood cancer is the leading 
cause of death from disease and the second 
overall leading cause of death for children in 
the United States; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for chil-
dren with cancer has increased from 58 per-
cent in the mid-1970s to 84 percent in 2020, 
representing significant improvement from 
previous decades; 
Whereas more than 2/3 of children who sur-
vive cancer will develop at least 1 chronic 
health condition, and many survivors will 
face a late-effect from treatment that could 
be considered severe or life-threatening; 
Whereas cancer patients face a higher risk 
of contracting the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) due to weakened immune sys-
tems; and 
Whereas cancer occurs regularly and ran-

Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Childhood Cancer Awareness Month’’;

States, localities, and nonprofit organiza-
tions observe the month with appropriate 
programs and activities, with the goal of in-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

September 30, 2021 
Whereas, since the 1870s, minority groups 
such as Black Americans in the South have 
suffered from the oppressive effects of Jim 
Crow laws that were designed to prevent po-
litical, economic, and social mobility; 
Whereas Black Americans, Latinos, Asian 
Americans, Native Americans, and other 
underrepresented voters were subject to vio-
lence, poll taxes, literacy tests, all-White 
primaries, property ownership tests, and 
grandfather clauses that were designed to 
suppress the right of those individuals to 
vote; 
Whereas 5,200,000 people in the United 
States are currently banned from voting be-
cause of a felony conviction, including 1 in 16 
Black adults, due to the shameful entangle-
ment of racial injustice in the criminal legal 
system and voting access in the United 
States; 
Whereas members of the aforementioned 
groups and others are currently, in some 
cases, subject to intimidation, voter roll 
purges, and financial barriers that act effec-
tively as modern-day poll taxes; 
Whereas, in 1965, Congress passed the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) 
to protect the right of Black Americans and 
other traditionally disenfranchised groups to 
vote, among other reasons; 
Whereas, in 2013, in the landmark case of 
Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), 
the Supreme Court of the United States in-
validated section 4 of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, dismantling the preclearance for-
mula provision in that Act that protected 
voters in States and localities that histori-
cally have suppressed the right of minorities 
to vote; 
Whereas, since the invalidation of the 
preclearance formula provision of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, gerrymandered districts 
in many States have gone unchallenged and 
have become less likely to be invalidated by 
the courts; 
Whereas these gerrymandered districts 
have been found to have discriminatory im-
pacts on traditionally disenfranchised mi-
norities through tactics that include ‘‘crack-
ing’’, diluting the voting power of minorities 
across many districts, and ‘‘packing’’ or con-
centrating minority voters’ power in one dis-
trict to reduce their voting power in other 
districts; 
Whereas the courts have found the con-
gressional and, in some cases, State legisla-
tive district maps, in Texas, North Carolina, 
Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin 
to be gerrymandered districts that were cre-
ated to favor some groups over others; 
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court 
in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 
(2013), calls on Congress to update the for-
mula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965; 
Whereas these restrictive voting laws en-
compass cutbacks in early voting, voter roll 
purges, placement of faulty equipment in mi-
nority communities, requirement of photo 
identification, and the elimination of same- 
day registration; 
Whereas these policies could outright dis-
enfranchise or make voting much more dif-
ficult for more than 80,000,000 minority, el-
derly, poor, and disabled voters, among other 
groups; 
Whereas, in 2016, discriminatory laws in 
North Carolina, Wisconsin, North Dakota, 
and Texas were ruled to violate voters’ 
rights and overturned by the courts; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) 
public health emergency has only exacer-
bated the state of elections and the difficul-
ties voters face in obtaining access to the 
ballot; 
Whereas a lack of fair and safe election 
policies threatens minority communities, 
which have been disproportionately im-
pacted 
and 
disenfranchised 
due 
to 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and their access to the 
ballot; 
Whereas addressing the challenges of ad-
ministering future elections requires in-
creasing the accessibility of vote-by-mail 
and other limited-contact options to ensure 
the protection of voters’ health and safety 
amid a global pandemic; 
Whereas, as voting by mail becomes a safer 
and more accessible option for voters to ex-
ercise their constitutional right to vote dur-
ing the unprecedented times caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the work of the United 
States Postal Service will be of paramount 
importance in successfully conducting elec-
tions; 
Whereas Congress must work to combat 
any attempts to dismantle or underfund the 
United States Postal Service or obstruct the 
passage of the mail as blatant tactics of 
voter suppression and election interference; 
Whereas following the 2020 elections there 
has been a relentless attack on the right to 
vote with more than 400 bills having been in-
troduced to roll back the right to vote, in-
cluding such bills being introduced in almost 
every State and at least 31 of such bills hav-
ing been signed into law in 18 States; 
Whereas there is much more work to be 
done to ensure all citizens of the United 
States have the right to vote through free, 
fair, and accessible elections, and Congress 
must exercise its Constitutional authority to 
protect the right to vote; 
Whereas National Voter Registration Day 
is September 22; and 
Whereas September 2021 would be an appro-
priate month to designate as ‘‘National Vot-
ing Rights Month’’ and to ensure that, 
through the registration of voters and 
awareness of elections, the democracy of the 
United States includes all citizens of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Voting Rights Month’’; 
(2) encourages all people in the United 
States to uphold the right of every citizen to 
exercise the sacred and fundamental right to 
vote; 
(3) encourages Congress to pass— 
(A) the For the People Act of 2021 (S. 2093 
and H.R. 1 of the 117th Congress), to increase 
voters’ access to the ballot, prohibit the use 
of deceptive practices to intimidate voters, 
end gerrymandering, create automatic voter 
registration, limit the power of restrictive 
voter identification laws, make critical in-
vestments in election infrastructure and 
technology, and address corruption in cam-
paign finance and ethics; 
(B) the Freedom to Vote Act (S. 2747 of the 
117th Congress), to set basic national stand-
ards to make sure all people in the United 
States can cast their ballots in the way that 
works best for them, regardless of what ZIP 
code they live in, improve access to the bal-
lot for people in the United States, advance 
commonsense election integrity reforms, and 
protect the democracy of the United States 
from relentless attacks; 
(C) the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act of 2021 (H.R. 4 of the 117th 
Congress), to restore the protections of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et 
seq.) that prohibit discriminatory voting 
practices, remove barriers to voting, and 
provide protections for minority voters in 
States with a history of voting discrimina-
tion; 
(D) the Democracy Restoration Act (S. 481 
of the 117th Congress), to restore Federal 
voting rights to citizens after release from 
imprisonment, honoring the responsibilities 
of citizenship and civic engagement nec-
essary for building healthy and safe commu-
nities, while welcoming the contributions of 
people returning home after imprisonment; 
and 
(E) other voting rights legislation that 
seeks to advance voting rights and protect 
elections in the United States; 
(4) recommends that public schools and 
universities in the United States develop an 
academic curriculum that educates students 
about— 
(A) the importance of voting, how to reg-
ister to vote, where to vote, and the different 
forms of voting; 
(B) the history of voter suppression in the 
United States before and after passage of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965; and 
(C) current measures that have been taken 
to restrict the vote; 
(5) encourages the United States Postal 
Service to issue a special John R. Lewis 
stamp during the month of September— 
(A) to honor the life and legacy of John R. 
Lewis in supporting voting rights; and 
(B) to remind people in the United States 
that ordinary citizens risked their lives, 
marched, and participated in the great de-
mocracy of the United States so that all citi-
zens would have the fundamental right to 
vote; and 
(6) invites Congress to allocate the req-
uisite funds for public service announce-
ments on television, radio, newspapers, mag-
azines, social media, billboards, buses, and 
other forms of media— 
(A) to remind people in the United States 
when elections are being held; 
(B) to share important registration dead-
lines; and

Whereas 80 percent of older adults have at 
least 1 chronic condition and nearly 70 per-
cent of Medicare beneficiaries have 2 or more 
chronic conditions; 
Whereas more than 868,000 people in the 
United States die of heart disease or stroke 
every year, costing the health care system of 
the United States $214,000,000,000 per year 
and causing $138,000,000,000 in lost produc-
tivity on the job; 
Whereas, each year, more than 1,700,000 
people in the United States are diagnosed 
with cancer and almost 600,000 die from it, 
costing an estimated $174,000,000,000 in 2020; 
Whereas more than 34,200,000 people in the 
United States have diabetes and another 
88,000,000 adults in the United States have 
prediabetes, putting them at risk for type 2 
diabetes, both of which cost a total esti-
mated $327,000,000,000 in medical costs for di-
agnosed diabetes and lost productivity in 
2017; 
Whereas obesity affects 19 percent of chil-
dren and 42 percent of adults, including older 
adults who have obesity rates exceeding 37.5 
percent in males and 39.4 percent in females,

$147,000,000,000 per year; 
Whereas falls are the leading cause of in-

Whereas approximately 20 percent of older 
adults experience some type of behavioral 
health concern, including anxiety, depres-

Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. YOUNG, Ms. 
HASSAN, Mr. BARRASSO, and Mr. SCOTT 
of South Carolina) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 404 
Whereas people in the United States are 
living longer, and the cost of retirement is 
increasing significantly; 
Whereas Social Security remains the bed-
rock of retirement income for the great ma-
jority of the people of the United States but 
was never intended by Congress to be the 
sole source of retirement income for fami-
lies; 
Whereas data from the Employee Benefit 
Research Institute indicates that, in the 
United States— 
(1) up to 40 percent of households in which 
the head of household is between the ages of 
35 and 64 are likely to run out of money in 
retirement; and 
(2) the amount that workers have saved for 
retirement is much less than the amount 
those workers need to adequately fund their 
retirement years; 
Whereas the financial literacy of workers 
in the United States is important so that 
those workers understand the need to save 
for retirement; 
Whereas saving for retirement is a key 
component of overall financial health and se-
curity during retirement years, and the im-
portance of financial literacy in planning for 
retirement must be advocated; 
Whereas many workers may not— 
(1) be aware of their various options in sav-
ing for retirement; or 
(2) have focused on the importance of, and 
need for, saving for retirement and success-
fully achieving retirement security; 
Whereas, although many employees have 
access to defined benefit and defined con-
tribution plans through their employers to 
assist such employees in preparing for retire-
ment, many of those employees may not be 
taking advantage of those plans at all or to 
the full extent allowed by Federal law; 
Whereas saving for retirement is necessary 
even during economic downturns or market 
declines, underscoring the importance of 
continued contributions; 
Whereas all workers, including public and 
private sector employees, employees of tax- 
exempt organizations, and self-employed in-
dividuals, can benefit from developing per-
sonal budgets and financial plans that in-
clude retirement savings strategies that 
take advantage of tax-preferred retirement 
savings vehicles; 
Whereas effectively and sustainably with-
drawing retirement resources throughout an 
individual’s retirement years is as important 
and crucial as saving and accumulating 
funds for retirement; and 
Whereas the month of October 2021 has 
been designated as ‘‘National Retirement Se-
curity Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Retirement Security Month, including 
raising public awareness of the importance 
of saving adequately for retirement; 
(2) acknowledges the need to raise public 
awareness of the variety of tax-preferred re-
tirement vehicles that are used by many peo-
ple in the United States, but remain under-
utilized; and 
(3) calls on States, localities, schools, uni-
versities, 
nonprofit 
organizations, 
busi-
nesses, other entities, and the people of the 
United States to observe National Retire-
ment Security Month with appropriate pro-
grams and activities, with the goal of in-
creasing the retirement savings and personal 
financial literacy of all people in the United 
States and enhancing the retirement secu-
rity of the people of the United States.

‘‘(i) a natural cause; 
‘‘(ii) an anthropogenic cause; 
‘‘(iii) a combination of a natural cause and 
an anthropogenic cause; or 
‘‘(iv) an undetermined cause.

the Secretary shall apply the following 12- 
month revenue loss thresholds in deter-
mining whether a fishery resource disaster 
has occurred: 
‘‘(I) Losses greater than 80 percent may re-
sult in a positive determination that a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred, based on 
the information provided or analyzed under 
paragraph (4)(B). 
‘‘(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 per-
cent shall be evaluated to determine whether 
economic impacts are severe enough to de-
clare that a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred. 
‘‘(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not 
be eligible for a determination that a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred. 
‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred, the Secretary shall con-
sider the economic impacts to the charter 
fishing industry to ensure financial coverage 
for charter fishing businesses.

munity instead of applying the revenue loss 
thresholds described in clause (i). 
‘‘(C) INELIGIBLE FISHERIES.—A fishery sub-
ject to overfishing in any of the 3 years pre-
ceding the date of a determination under 
this subsection is not eligible for a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred unless the Secretary de-
termines that overfishing was not a contrib-
uting factor to the fishery resource disaster. 
‘‘(D) EXCEPTIONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.—In an 
exceptional circumstance where substantial 
economic impacts to the affected fishery and 
fishing community have been subject to a 
disaster declaration under another statutory 
authority, such as in the case of a natural 
disaster or from the direct consequences of a 
Federal action taken to prevent, or in re-
sponse to, a natural disaster for purposes of 
protecting life and safety, the Secretary may 
determine a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred without a request. 
‘‘(6) DISBURSAL OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS.— 
‘‘(A) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary shall 
allocate funds available under paragraph (9) 
for fishery resource disasters.

AVAIL-
ABILITY.—When there are appropriated funds 
for 1 or more fishery resource disasters, the 
Secretary shall notify— 
‘‘(I) the public; and 
‘‘(II) representatives of affected fishing 
communities with a positive disaster deter-
mination that is unfunded; 
of the availability of funds, not more than 14 
days after the date of the appropriation or 
the determination of a fishery resource dis-
aster, whichever occurs later. 
‘‘(ii) EXTENSION
OF
DEADLINE.—The Sec-
retary may extend the deadline under clause 
(i) by 90 days to evaluate and make deter-

HONORING JACKIE D. ME´ NDEZ FOR 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Jackie D. 
Me´ndez. Jackie is the founder and editor-in- 
chief of Tu Revista Mujer, Florida’s first Span-
ish, female-focused health magazine. Estab-
lished in 2009, the publication was created to 
address the health issues surrounding the 
Latina community. It is the first of its kind to 
interview celebrities and leaders of the His-
panic community to advocate for personal 
care and better quality of life. 
Jackie is also one of the founders of 
Talleres de Bienvenida, the informative con-
ferences for newcomers to Central Florida. 
Jackie is also the current executive director of 
the Pan American Medical Association of Cen-
tral Florida—producing events, developing 
medical directories, and hosting health-minded 
programming for the community. 
Born in Spain and raised in Puerto Rico, her 
career started with a degree in journalism from 
the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo 
in the Dominican Republic. She also worked 
at Casiano Communications as a sales man-
ager of Buena Vida Magazine and GTV Maga-
zine, and as the editor of Comercio and 
Produccı´on for the Puerto Rican Chamber of 
Commerce, before moving to Florida in 2002 
with her two daughters. There, she began a 
career in advertising at El Nuevo Dia Orlando, 
and in 2012, she became the communications 
director of the Puerto Rican Chamber of Com-
merce of Central Florida. 
Mrs. Me´ndez’s life’s motivation is to serve 
others through education and awareness on 
issues of health knowledge. Her philosophy is 
that knowledge is the primary tool to combat 
ignorance and leads to valuable new perspec-
tives. 
For this and more, we honor Jackie D. 
Me´ndez.

ANTHONY JIMENEZ, EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, in De-
cember of 2019, Anthony Jimenez earned the 
rank of Eagle Scout. He attends Rowan Uni-
versity in the music education program and 
just completed his first year. Anthony partici-
pated in the marching band and was awarded 
the rookie of the year award and has earned 
a leadership award every year after that. For 
Anthony’s Eagle Scout project, he started a 
music program at Daniel’s Den Community 
Center in Vineland, South Jersey. He donated 
and collected over 20 musical instruments 
needed for the project and put in 130 hours of 
work dedicated to the launching of the music 
program. Over the course of Anthony’s time 
as a scout, he earned 26 merit badges, and 
held positions as troop bugler, patrol leader, 
assistant senior patrol leader, and senior pa-
trol leader. In addition to all his successes, he 
is currently teaching eight merit badges to 
younger boy scouts online. Anthony is an in-
spiration to his peers and is looked up to by 
his fellow scouts and I know he will go on to 
achieve great things. God Bless Anthony and 
God Bless America.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I was un-
able to vote on September 30, 2021 due to 
not being physically present in the District of 
Columbia. Had I been present, I would have 
voted as follows: NO on Roll Call No. 311. 
Today I was unable to vote on the Con-
tinuing Resolution due to being at an impor-
tant hearing outside of the District of Columbia 
on behalf of a highly decorated Marine who is 
currently confined. The Democrats had a con-
clusive number of votes to pass the bill in the 
House of Representatives and my recorded 
vote of ‘‘no’’ would unfortunately not change 
the outcome. However, with the liberties of an 
American patriot and service member, Lieu-
tenant Colonel (LTC) Stuart Scheller, hanging 
in the balance, I came to his assistance to tes-
tify in person on his behalf. 
When a member of Congress with my prior 
experience can potentially help someone who 
has repeatedly risked his life for our nation, it 
seems I have a duty to fight for the liberty and 
rights of all American citizens. A weighty deci-
sion had to be made, but protecting the legal 
rights and liberties of Americans, particularly 
one who has sacrificed so much, was the only 
choice to make. It is unfortunate that Demo-
crats continue to spend at unsustainable lev-
els and without any appreciation of the fact 
that their irresponsibility today jeopardizes the 
freedom of all Americans—those living today 
as well as those not even born yet.

30TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co-chair 
of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Cau-
cus, I join Liberty lovers around the globe in 
congratulating Ukraine on its 30 years of re-
stored independence. 
Since my first trip to Ukraine in 1973, it has 
been an honor to watch Ukraine’s inspirational 
path to Liberty. In the dark days of Soviet- 
Russian occupied Ukraine, there were very 
few cars on the street, the buildings were 
gray, and people lived their lives in the shad-
ow of secret police oppression. Yet, while 
Ukraine’s progress has at times been jagged, 
even then, I personally witnessed her people’s 
thirst for Liberty, and their desire to live in an 
open society. 
Today’s Ukraine is religiously and ethnically 
diverse, vibrant, and yes, a democracy. Her 
people have decided to cast off the yoke of 
Russian oppression. They wish to join the 
community of democracies, the Euro-Atlantic 
nations, and importantly NATO. 
The U.S. Congress on a bipartisan basis 
has been the backbone over generations to 
support these aspirations. Ukraine’s success 
is critical for U.S. national security. Indeed, 
she is on the scrimmage line for Liberty on the 
European continent. 
The Congressional Ukraine Caucus strongly 
condemns Russia’s ongoing illegal war and 
occupation of Ukrainian territories. The U.S. 
House of Representatives voted to increase 
security assistance by $25 million for fiscal 
year 2021. To counter Russia’s weaponization 
of energy against our allies and partners, the 
House unanimously adopted our bipartisan 
amendment in the FY22 National Defense Au-
thorization Act to fully sanction the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline. The Congress also strongly 
supports the U.S. pledge for $1 billion in the 
Three Seas Fund to strengthen the region’s 
energy resilience. 
While our Caucus celebrates Ukraine’s 30 
years of restored independence, we also com-
memorate the 80th anniversary and honor the 
lives lost at the Babyn Yar massacre. We shall 
never forget the precious lives lost in this 
atrocity and in the Holocaust. We must work 
together to uncover historical truth to allow for 
historical reconciliation and to ensure acts like 
these never happen again. 
In conclusion, our Caucus looks forward to 
working with freedom defenders around the 
world to ensure a Ukraine that is democratic, 
secure, prosperous, and at peace. 
Onward Liberty, Onward Ukraine, Slava 
Ukrayna.

HONORING DR. DIANA MEJIA FOR 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Dr. Diana 
Mejia. Dr. Mejia is a dedicated and passionate 
advocate against domestic violence. As an ac-
tivist for Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse 
Advocacy for Change, Dr. Mejia aims to cre-
ate a highlighted awareness within municipal 
and government agencies of a need for 
change in policies and legislation to enhance 
education and services that protect victims 
and survivors of violence and sexual abuse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1048 
September 30, 2021 
Dr. Mejia has an 18-year track record of 
serving the culturally diverse population of Or-
lando, Florida, which is composed primarily of 
Hispanic women and their children. Through 
her work, Dr. Mejia has been able to mentor, 
teach, support, and advocate for many of 
these women and families. As a prevention 
practitioner provider, she continues to help 
families affected by sexual violence in the 
management of culturally relevant services, in-
cluding immigrant communities, faith-based or-
ganizations, seminars, and culturally specific 
programs geared to prevent sexual violence. 
She has a particular passion for advocating for 
male survivors as well, and she has been in-
vited to work in collaboration with the Mexican 
and Colombian consulates to educate their 
communities in Central Florida. 
For this and more, we honor Dr. Diana 
Mejia.

MATTHEW PAULSON, EAGLE 
SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Matthew Paulson who recently 
passed his Eagle Board of Review to become 
an Eagle Scout. Matthew graduated from 
Cumberland Christian School in Vineland, 
South Jersey where he was a four-sport start-
ing senior for basketball, baseball, soccer, and 
track. He was also a National Honor Society 
member and plans to attend Rowan University 
in the business management program. He is 
also very involved in his church where he vol-
unteers as the leader of the church’s tech-
nology crew. For Matthew’s Eagle Scout 
project, he completed a playground restoration 
for Cumberland Christian School. He recruited 
and supervised 34 workers for over 265 hours 
to complete the project. Students at the school 
have had the opportunity to enjoy the play-
ground renovation because of Matthew’s will-
ingness to make a difference for his commu-
nity. Matthew is a born leader, as he served 
as his troop’s patrol leader, assistant senior 
patrol leader, chaplain’s aide, quartermaster, 
and troop guide. God Bless Matthew and all 
he has done for his community and God Bless 
America.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF COUNTRY CLUB 
CHRISTIAN CHURCH 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to rise today to recognize the 100th anni-
versary of the Country Club Christian Church. 
Since 1921, this church has received every-
one, regardless of background, with open 
arms into their religious community. This 
church has made a tradition of service since 
its very inception, serving as a center of sup-
port for those who call Kansas City home. It 
is a great pleasure to have this house of wor-
ship and pillar of faith in my Congressional 
District. 
Country Club Christian Church was founded 
in 1921 and it bears the name of its location, 
the Country Club District. While the church’s 
name may bring to mind images of exclusivity, 
the church serves under the motto that ‘‘all 
means all,’’ and they have always been com-
mitted to providing for and including each and 
every one of their neighbors. The church has 
been led by both male and female pastors and 
ordained its first LGBTQ Minister in 2013. 
Through its inclusive and loving community, 
Country Club Christian Church has embodied 
the notion of loving thy neighbor, making it a 
central message and mission at this parish. 
Not only is Country Club Christian Church a 
center of worship but also a hub of service in 
its community. The church participates in com-
munity outreach and service, helping its 
marginalized members by partnering with 
Cross-Lines Community Outreach Food Kitch-
en every first Tuesday of the month to serve 
food to its members. Along with helping those 
neighbors within Kansas City, this church ex-
tends its arms to help newly arrived refugees 
and immigrants settle into their new homes in 
our community by providing them support 
through their transition into a new country. 
Around the world, this church has embarked 
upon missions in Nicaragua, Haiti, South Afri-
ca, and India as well as several locations in 
the United States to provide service, a place 
of worship, and support for others. While on 
these missions, Church members helped build 
water filtration systems for a community in 
Nicaragua, delivered clothing and gifts to chil-
dren in Haiti, and provided health services 
while in India. Additionally, the church orga-
nizes a Christian Community Camp each year. 
Held in the Rocky Mountains, this expedition 
allows members of the church to build friend-
ships with each other while also growing and 
expanding their faith. 
Country Club Christian Church has served 
for over a century, and that spirit of service 
holds true today. The assembly is a clearly 
devoted group which includes Federal District 
Judge Steve Bough and his wife, Kansas City 
Councilwoman Andrea Bough. Madam Speak-
er, because of the church’s decades of service 
and commitment to communities at home and 
abroad, please join me in celebrating and hon-
oring Reverend Carla Aday and the congrega-
tion of Country Club Christian Church for 
achieving this milestone. May the next 100 
years be just as fruitful.

HONORING 
THE 
60TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE DELAWARE RIVER 
BASIN COMMISSION 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in honor of the 60th Anniver-
sary of the Delaware River Basin Commission. 
60 years ago, under President Kennedy, 
governors from Delaware, New Jersey, Penn-
sylvania, and New York came together to sign 
concurrent compact legislation to form a re-
gional body in order to protect, manage, and 
improve the Delaware River Basin. This pro-
found coming together of the federal govern-
ment and state governments as equal partners 
in signing of the Delaware River Basin Com-
pact was a first in our nation’s history. 
Working together regardless of political 
boundaries, the Delaware River Basin Com-
mission has worked tirelessly to ensure the 
health of the Delaware River and the sur-
rounding 
ecosystems 
and 
communities 
through implementing flood damage reduction, 
protecting fisheries, abating and controlling 
stream pollution, improving water quality, and 
more. 
I thank the Delaware River Basin Commis-
sion for their work, and congratulate them on 
their 60th Anniversary.

HONORING 
CRAMER 
VERDE 
IN 
HONOR OF HISPANIC HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Cramer 
Verde. Cramer was raised in Peru and now 
makes Florida his home. As a child, his fa-
ther’s work as a city councilman and business 
owner sparked his interest in helping others. 
He continues this legacy to this day, and still 
remembers his early involvement in supporting 
his hometown through community efforts. 
Cramer received a degree in marketing and 
business administration from San Ignacio de 
Loyola University in Lima, Peru. There, he 
worked closely with the school administration 
and was president of the University Social Alli-
ance. This student nonprofit organization 
worked with the vice president of Peru to pro-
vide educational and medical material to kids 
in low-income communities. These experi-
ences helped cultivate Cramer’s drive for suc-
cess and spirit of hard work. 
When Cramer moved to Sarasota in 2003, 
he quickly saw a need to change immigration 
policies and other issues. He mobilized and 
got involved with numerous organizations like 
UnidosNow, the ACLU of Florida, and LULAC 
Florida. Presently, he serves as political direc-
tor of LULAC Florida and president of the 
Sarasota chapter of the ACLU of Florida. 
In his professional career, Cramer has 
worked with the Small Business Administration 
of Peru, Microsoft, Bank of America, and 
many other groups, organizations, and compa-
nies. Cramer is an entrepreneur and currently 
the owner of Casa Verde Real Estate and 
Cramer Strategic Consulting, a marketing-po-
litical consulting company. He is a car aficio-
nado, dog lover, husband, and is always look-
ing at different ways to support and defend his 
community from any threats or harm. 
For this and more, we honor Cramer Verde.

tended Ocean City High School and held mul-
tiple leadership positions and was heavily in-
volved in community service. She raised over 
$25,000 for Make-A-Wish and raised over 
$2,000 for Children’s Miracle Network hos-
pitals. Isabella was inspired to give back to 
her community because of her brother, Anto-
nio. Antonio was born with Hypoplastic Left 
Heart Syndrome, and qualified to receive a 
wish from Make-a-Wish. After Isabella wit-
nessed what Make-a-Wish did for her brother, 
she wanted to become a volunteer and ac-
tively fundraise to help other children like An-
tonio. Isabella says that our voices have the 
power to change the world, and she is abso-
lutely right. Our young generation will be our 
future leaders, and I am honored to be able to 
recognize Isabella for all of her accomplish-
ments. God Bless Isabella and God Bless

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE NASA ARM-
STRONG FLIGHT RESEARCH CEN-
TER 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research 
Center. Located on Edwards Air Force Base, 
NASA Armstrong is well-positioned in the 
western Mojave Desert of California for its in-
novative research and testing that keeps our 
Nation on the cutting edge of aeronautical ad-
vances. 
Formerly known as the Dryden Flight Re-
search Center in honor of Hugh Dryden, a 
former Director of Aeronautical Research for 
the National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics (NACA), the Center was founded in 
1946. With faith, ingenuity, and grit, 13 engi-
neers and technicians from NACA’s Langley 
Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory came to 
Edwards Air Force Base, then known as 
Muroc Army Air Base, to prepare for the X–1 
rocket plane’s first supersonic flight in the Mo-
jave Desert. Retired U.S. Air Force Captain 
Chuck Yeager completed this important super-
sonic mission, breaking the sound barrier on 
October 14, 1947 by flying the X–1 over 
Southern California. 
In 2014, the Center was renamed the NASA 
Armstrong Flight Research Center to honor 
Neil Armstrong, a former aeronautical re-
search scientist at Dryden and astronaut who 
became the first person to step foot on the 
moon. Since its inception, NASA Armstrong 
has been involved in historical space and 
aeronautical milestones, including supersonic 
and hypersonic flight and the development of 
our space shuttles. NASA Armstrong also de-
veloped the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle 
(LLRV) and served as the testing site for Apol-
lo’s famous X–15 rocket plane. The impor-
tance of the LLRV was recognized by Neil 
Armstrong, who said that the technology 
played a critical role in the success of the 
Apollo 11 mission. 
Today, NASA Armstrong is known as the 
premier research center for testing high-risk 
atmospheric projects in the United States. Its 
Research Aircraft Integration Facility can 
check the systems, electronics, and controls of 
aircraft simultaneously—the only facility con-
trolled by NASA that can achieve such a feat. 
In addition to its research, NASA Armstrong is 
a leader in safety. In 2020, NASA Armstrong 
won the Federal Aviation Safety Award among 
Premier Federal Aviation Programs. 
From the Stratospheric Observatory For In-
frared Astronomy (SOFIA) program to partner-
ships to advance commercial space, NASA 
Armstrong is helping America learn more 
about the vast unknown beyond Earth. As a 
faithful pioneer in aeronautics, NASA Arm-
strong is focused on advancing technology 
with projects like the X–59 which would dem-
onstrate that supersonic flight over land is fea-
sible by reducing the noise of the sonic boom. 
NASA Armstrong also supports progressing 
space technology with its management of the 
Flight Opportunities program to partner with in-
dustry to improve technologies for space ex-
ploration. 
On behalf of the 23rd District of California, 
it is my honor to celebrate NASA Armstrong’s 
historic 75th anniversary. I wish NASA Arm-
strong and its devoted team of nearly 1,100 
civil servants and contractors continued suc-
cess in maintaining America’s edge in space 
and aeronautic research.

HONORING 
VIRGINIA 
OLIVER, 
MAINE’S OLDEST LOBSTER HAR-
VESTER 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor Virginia Oliver, who at 101 years 
old is Maine’s, and perhaps the world’s, oldest 
lobster harvester. 
Known as Ginny to her friends, and affec-
tionately called ‘‘The Lobster Lady’’ by us at 
home, Mrs. Oliver has been hauling traps off 
and on since the age of seven, a decade be-
fore World War II and at a time when few 
women were working on the water. When 
asked recently how much longer she’ll con-
tinue lobstering, she shared that she has no 
plans to stop. 
Three long days a week, May through No-
vember, Mrs. Oliver and her son Max tend 
their traps off Rockland, working one of the 
most hazardous jobs in the country. She pilots 
the boat named after her, cleans and fills bait 
bags, and measures and bands lobsters. 
In Maine we take great pride in our strong 
work ethic, and Virginia Oliver, The Lobster 
Lady, is a bright example of why that pride is 
well-placed. I am honored to recognize this 
Mainer’s contribution to our heritage lobster in-
dustry.

HONORING ANTHONY CARRILLO 
FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Anthony 
Carrillo. Anthony Carrillo serves as the Florida 
regional director of the Puerto Rico Federal 
Affairs Administration. As director, he rep-
resents the government of Puerto Rico and 
over 1.3 million U.S. citizens from the island 
who now call the Sunshine State home. In this 
role, he has provided much-needed assistance 
to the Puerto Rican community in the post- 
Hurricane Maria era, assisting small busi-
nesses with opportunities, helping thousands 
of citizens who relocated from the island, and 
helping former inmates to get second chances 
by providing community services such as 
housing, healthcare, jobs, and vital docu-
ments. 
Mr. Carrillo is also the chairman of the 
Board of Directors of the National Puerto 
Rican Equality Coalition, a nonprofit organiza-
tion focused on educating and advancing 
equality to Puerto Ricans. In 2020, the people 
of Puerto Rico elected him as a presidential 
delegate for President Joe Biden at the Demo-
cratic National Convention. Prior to his ap-
pointment as regional director, he served as 
Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration’s 
District of Columbia office policy advisor in the 
government affairs division, where he was the 
lead advisor of the Puerto Rico Statehood 
Commission and handled multiple policy port-
folios. 
Moreover, from 2011 to 2015, Mr. Carrillo 
was the co-founder and elected chairman of 
the Young Democrats of America Hispanic 
Caucus, the largest youth Hispanic democratic 
organization promoting voter education and 
outreach in the United States. Mr. Carrillo re-
ceived his higher education in Puerto Rico, is 
an Army veteran and current captain in the 
U.S. Army Reserve Judge Advocate General 
Corps and serves as the national security law 
chief of the 79th Theater Sustainment Com-
mand. In his spare time, Mr. Carrillo enjoys 
volunteering for multiple voting, civil rights, 
and veteran advocacy organizations. 
For this and more, we honor Anthony 
Carrillo.

LIAM MILLAR, EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Liam Millar for achieving the rank of 
Eagle Scout. Liam graduated from Ocean City 
High School and has entered the Massachu-
setts Maritime Academy and is a Marine Engi-
neering major. While Liam was in high school, 
he participated on his school’s crew team and 
was also in the academic team club. For his 
Eagle Scout project, he put up a sign and 
shrubbery at his neighborhood playground, 
North Street playground. Before Liam stepped 
in to create this sign, there was no indication 
that the playground was there for people to 
enjoy. He worked directly with the mayor’s of-
fice to put up the sign and shrubbery to add 
a scenic view of the playground. I am so 
proud of Liam’s accomplishments and I wish 
him luck as he enters his sophomore year as 
a 3/C cadet. God Bless Liam and God Bless 
America.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BRINGING 
REGULATORY 
ADVANCES 
INTO 
NEUROSCIENCE (BRAIN) ACT OF 
2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I am pleased to introduce the Bringing Regu-
latory Advances into Neuroscience (BRAIN) 
Act of 2021. 
Today, brain and central nervous system 
(CNS) disorders account for an incredible bur-
den both on individual patients and their fami-
lies as well as the United States health care 
system. One in five adults in America—more 
than 50 million people—live with a mental ill-
ness while 20 million Americans suffer from a 
neurological condition. Brain diseases and dis-
orders cost the U.S. more than $1.5 trillion per 
year, a significant portion of which is paid for 
by the Medicare program. Seven of the 21 
chronic conditions tracked by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are 
related to the brain and this represents an av-
erage annual cost of $23,325 per Medicare 
beneficiary, higher than the average cost for 
all other chronic conditions. 
The BRAIN Act of 2021 would establish a 
Neuroscience Center of Excellence (NCOE) 
under the Food and Drug Administration. Mod-
eled after the FDA’s Oncology Center of Ex-
cellence, an NCOE would create opportunities 
for innovation in the development and regula-
tion of treatments for brain diseases and dis-
orders. By focusing on patients, it would en-
sure that investments in research are more 
likely to produce safe and effective treatments 
which would provide relief for those who have 
been waiting too long. 
The blueprint for a center of excellence like 
this was included in a discussion draft of 21st 
Century Cures 2.0, circulated by my col-
leagues 
Representatives 
DEGETTE
and 
UPTON. The draft legislation would require the 
FDA to create at least two new intercenter in-
stitutes, including one focusing on high preva-
lence and burdensome diseases like those af-
fecting the brain and CNS. 
It is clear that there is an enormous need to 
address these conditions and a Neuroscience 
Center of Excellence would make significant 
progress for people who have been suffering 
for far too long. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

SAINT LOUIS COUNTY NAACP 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, the rich roots 
of advocacy, activism, and community orga-
nizing etched in the NAACP’s history continue 
to reverberate through the countless lives you 
all have touched. I am deeply heartened at the 
opportunity to celebrate the Saint Louis Coun-
ty Chapter of NAACP on 84 years of service 
and leadership in our community. St. Louis 
has unquestionably been made better by the 
work that they all have committed themselves 
to, and I am honored to be their representa-
tive. 
The fight for justice for Black people has 
been one fraught with pain and strife, but that 
very pain produces a strength and resilience 
in each of us that gives us the courage to fight 
onward amidst the adversity. That resilience is 
beautifully evidenced in this chapter’s work 
throughout St. Louis. As our office continues 
to do the most for all people starting with 
those that have the least, I am grateful to be 
in this struggle alongside them. I thank the 
Saint Louis County Chapter of NAACP for 
their commitment and extend congratulations 
on 84 strong years.

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Dr. Jesus 
‘‘JV’’ Roa. Dr. Roa is an emergency medicine 
physician serving Central Florida in the Or-
lando Regional Medical Center Emergency 
Department. As the COVID–19 pandemic has 
evolved, Dr. Roa has been at the forefront of 
the response. As the director of resident pro-
fessional development and emergency medi-
cine clerkship director for Orlando Health, Dr.

room. His work involved inspiring team mem-
bers through challenging days while working 
long, strenuous hours. Dr. Roa contributed to 
developing treatment options including the use 
of emerging therapies for COVID–19 patients. 
Dr. Roa and his physician colleagues made 
critical decisions that impacted staff safety and 
allowed providers to clinically assess and treat 
patients, as well as deliver outstanding care. 
In addition to his work with Orlando Health, 
Dr. Roa serves as medical director of the Or-
lando Police Department SWAT team, volun-
teering his time to train with the team that 
takes on the most dangerous assignments to 
resolve critical incidents. Using his military and 
medical expertise, earned through 20 years of 
service in the United States Army Reserves 
combined with three years of active duty as a 
combat medic prior to medical school, Dr. Roa 
helps train officers in the use of advanced tac-
tics and specialized equipment, so they are 
prepared to handle dangerous, high-risk situa-
tions. 
Dr. Roa trained at the Chicago Medical 
School at Rosalind Franklin University and 
completed a residency in emergency medicine 
at Orlando Regional Medical Center. He is an 
assistant professor of emergency medicine at 
the University of Central Florida College of 
Medicine. 
For this and more, we honor Dr. Jesus Roa.

walk path were all hand laid and will be en-
joyed for years to come. This new walk path 
will greatly impact the accessibility of the com-
munity gardens for those who have mobility 
impairments and our elderly. Thomas was 
able to complete this project with the help of 
his troop, sponsorships from Home Depot and 
Atlantic Masonry, and his family. Thomas’ 
dedication to this project will give more people 
the ability to access the gardens and he 
should be proud of his accomplishments. God 
Bless Thomas and God Bless America.

HONORING JUANA DIAZ FOR 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Juana Diaz. 
Juana was born in Polk County, Florida. Her 
parents immigrated from Mexico to the United 
States and worked as migrant workers. When 
Juana was a child, she recalls living in a mi-
grant camp. There, she encountered a public 
health nurse who came to the camps to ad-
minister vaccinations and aid the workers in 
their overall health. The impact of that moment 
led her to believe that she could one day be 
a nurse and help her community. 
In 1996, Juana applied to work at Winter 
Haven Hospital as a ward clerk. After working 
in the surgical intensive care unit, she recalls 
how the intensive care nurses were compas-
sionate, caring, and brilliant, which inspired 
her to pursue a career in nursing. Juana un-
derstood that nursing was her calling. 
After graduating from Polk Community Col-
lege with her associates degree in nursing in 
2003, Juana began her career in the same 
unit she started as a ward clerk. Throughout 
her career, Juana has had the privilege of 
helping many of her fellow Hispanic patients 
and families. She understood that language 
barriers frequently affected the care of these 
patients and made it her duty to help when-
ever she could. Juana obtained her certifi-
cation in critical care nursing in June of 2009 
and recently graduated with her bachelor’s de-
gree in nursing. 
Juana has a strong work ethic, which she 
inherited from her parents. They came to this 
country not knowing the language or culture 
and achieved the American dream for them-
selves and their children. 
For this and more, we honor Juana Diaz.

MARGARET FAUERBACH’S 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of meeting Margaret 
Fauerbach who turned 100 years old on June 
17th. Margret was raised in Portland with her 
five brothers. While two of her brothers were 
serving in the U.S. Navy during WWII, Mar-
garet met a sailor whom she married after a 
year of dating. Margaret and her husband, 
Rudy, had a son, Rudy Jr., and moved to Mill-
ville soon after. After Rudy was honorably dis-
charged from the Navy, the two had their sec-
ond son, Donald. Margaret was involved in 
cub scouts, serving as a cub scout leader, and 
she was also a Sunday School teacher, a 
Babe Ruth league volunteer, and served as a 
sorority leader. For years, Margaret and Rudy 
traveled in an RV to seashore campgrounds 
over the summer months. Margaret and Rudy 
were blessed with four grandchildren and five 
great grandchildren, who they could not be 
more proud of. They were married for 72 
years before Rudy’s passing, and she now en-
joys cruises on the riverfront in her golf cart 
and taking care of her home. God Bless Mar-
garet and her wonderful family and God Bless 
America.

REMEMBERING ERICKA EDWARDS 
JONES 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize, remember and 
mourn the life of a dear friend and sister, 
Ericka Edwards Jones of Marrero and Algiers, 
Louisiana. 
She lived a life of service and activism 
throughout her 48 years of life, as a longtime 
employee of the parish courts, and staffer of 
former Congressman William J. Jefferson, and 
as chief deputy of 2nd City Court under the 
leadership of Clerk Darren Lombard. She 
served with compassion and honor. 
She thoroughly enjoyed politics, but, most 
importantly, public service. She was an incred-
ible wife, mother, daughter, and friend. We will 
sorely miss her incredible smile, her leader-
ship, her compassion for service. 
Ericka was a devoted elected member of 
OPDEC. She had a smile that would light up 
the room. Ericka was passionate, and com-
passionate, and generous to a fault. She had 
a strong sense of style. Ericka brought a 
sense of calm and ‘‘I’ve got it under control’’ 
into complex situations. 
We will miss Ericka, but her fingerprints will 
long live in the great works that she leaves 
behind. 
My thoughts and prayers are with her fam-
ily, with all that knew her, and all that will re-
member her forever. I’m sending prayers es-
pecially to her son Marcus Jones, Jr., her hus-
band Marcus Jones, Sr., and to her parents. 
The entire community of New Orleans will 
miss her deeply. I thank Ericka, and may she 
rest easy.

Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Rev. Robert 
Moore for serving as the Executive Director of 
the Coalition for Peace Action (CFPA) for 40 
years. Rev. Moore has worked tirelessly on 
critical issues of peace including gun control, 
disarmament, the reduction of nuclear weap-
ons, voter engagement, and countless other 
causes. 
In his role as Executive Director, he has led 
critical peacemaking efforts through the Coali-
tion for Peace Action, which celebrated its 40- 
year anniversary last year. Rev. Moore led 
many grassroots initiatives in the United 
States including the inaugural Peace Voter 
Campaign in 1995 as well as one of the larg-
est demonstrations in national history in 1982 
where one million people gathered in New 
York to call for a freeze on nuclear weapons. 
In honor of Rev. Moore’s illustrious career 
and dedication to peacemaking efforts, the 
Princeton Municipal Council declared that 
September 8, 2021 is ‘‘Reverend Robert 
Moore Day’’ in Princeton, New Jersey. Rev. 
Moore’s dedication to building a more peaceful 
world is an inspiration to us all and today we 
celebrate the impact and importance of his 
work. 
I congratulate Rev. Bob Moore on his nota-
ble achievements.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY

Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the honor of attending Thomas 
McGowan’s send-off party celebrating his ac-
ceptance to West Point. I nominated Thomas 
because of his strong commitment to his com-
munity and his academics. He graduated from 
Mainland Regional High School where he took 
a total of 13 advanced placement classes and 
was also a member of the National Honor So-
ciety. He achieved the rank of Eagle Scout 
and held positions in his troop as assistant pa-
trol leader, patrol leader, senior patrol leader, 
instructor, and order of the arrow representa-
tive. In addition to Thomas’ academic suc-
cesses, he also played on his school’s base-
ball team and also volunteered at numerous 
organizations. He was an American Legion 
volunteer since he was in 6th grade, and as-
sisted his local veterans by participating in 
over 300 hours of giving back to those who 
served their country. His Eagle Scout project 
took over 40 hours to complete and he also 
did over 225 hours of other community service 
projects. I know Thomas will go on to achieve 
great things and will represent South Jersey 
with pride. God Bless Thomas and God Bless 
America.

DRUG TREATMENT PIONEER MIKE 
WATANABE RETIRES 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, as he retires I 
rise to commemorate the career of a pioneer 
and advocate in drug treatment, Michael N. 
Watanabe. Mike and I became friends during 
the time that the crack cocaine epidemic dev-
astated neighborhoods across Los Angeles, 
but his dedication to serving those struggling 
with addiction goes back much further. 
Even as a high schooler in the 1960s, Mike 
had seen friends and neighbors of all races 
suffer and even die from drug overdoses. He 
was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1969, where 
he served as a Huey helicopter Crew Chief in 
Vietnam. His experiences there gave him fur-
ther insight into the role that substances like 
drugs and alcohol play in people’s lives. He 
emerged from his transition back to civilian life 
with a determination to help people. That led 
him to pursue a degree in social work at 
UCLA, earning a scholarship through the Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). 
In 1975 he joined the staff of the Asian 
American Drug Abuse Program (AADAP). 
With offices in the heart of the Crenshaw dis-
trict of Los Angeles, AADAP had been found-
ed to assist Asians, Pacific Islanders and 
other underserved communities. Mike quickly 
saw opportunities to extend services, and to 
treat the whole person. He has dedicated 46 
years of his life to AADAP, 39 of those years 
as the head of the organization. 
During his tenure, AADAP grew from a 
small grassroots organization with 20 staff to 
a large, comprehensive service agency with 
over 120 professional staff serving a signifi-
cant portion of Los Angeles County through 
ten service sites. AADAP boasts an impres-
sive track record, serving all races and cul-
tures, and offering residential and outpatient 
treatment, family support, job training, and a 
wide spectrum of programs providing preven-
tion, intervention, and diversion services for 
substance use disorders. 
In his nearly half-century of service, Mike 
has also leant his expertise to numerous na-
tional, state and local organizations and com-
missions. He has given workshops, seminars, 
testimony, and consultations to anyone who 
could benefit from his experience and vision 
for change. He has received innumerable 
awards and recognitions for his work as an 
educator, clinician and leader, including an 
Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (LHD) de-
gree from his undergraduate alma mater, Cali-
fornia State University Northridge. 
Countless lives have changed for the better 
due to Mike’s work. Now, as he hands over 
the reins of this vital organization, I wish him 
and his family the very best, and I look for-
ward to the next chapter of his life.

IRON DOME CRUCIAL TO DEFEND 
FAMILIES 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, last week, in a move that stunned 
me and my Republican colleagues, the Demo-
crats removed funding for the Israeli Iron 
Dome air defense system from the continuing 
resolution. Though I remain hopeful it will ulti-
mately be included in the final package, it is 
unbelievable that scrapping this essential sys-
tem was even being considered. 
The U.S. and Israel have an alliance mutu-
ally beneficial for joint security and Middle 
East stability of peace through strength. 
Israel is under regular rocket attack from the 
terrorist 
group 
Hamas, 
from 
Gaza 
and 
Hezbollah from Lebanon, and the Iron Dome, 
a product of U.S.-Israel security cooperation, 
is designed to intercept and destroy short- 
range rockets and shells the Iran-sponsored 
terrorists fire indiscriminately into their country, 
targeting civilians. Some 4,400 rockets were 
fired into Israel in May alone, and sadly, tens 
of thousands more projectiles may be stock-
piled. 
I have been to Israel and know first-hand 
the fear of attack felt by their citizens visiting 
mothers in Sderot who have traumatized chil-
dren by rocket attacks, and mothers in Jeru-
salem who have horribly injured children by 
suicide bombers at Hadassah Hospital. Mass 
murderers must be stopped. The American 
Israel 
Public 
Affairs 
Committee 
(AIPAC) 
makes a difference alerting Americans with 
the truth by sponsoring conferences with 
Christian civic leaders as this week with Hope 
Walker from South Carolina. 
So, we must continue to support their secu-
rity needs as an ally and as a matter of the 
broader U.S. national security. 
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who 
successfully protected America for 20 years as 
the Global War on Terrorism continues moving 
from abroad to our neighborhoods.

HONORING DR. LUIS HERRERA 
FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Dr. Luis Her-
rera. As medical director of the Orlando Health 
Cancer Institute Thoracic Oncology Program, 
Dr. Herrera serves Central Florida by pro-
viding the most advanced levels of innovative 
care for patients with lung and esophageal 
cancer at the busiest thoracic surgery location 
in Florida. After attending medical school at 
the University of Puerto Rico, Dr. Herrera 
completed a general surgery residency at the 
University 
of 
Pittsburgh, 
followed 
by 
a 
cardiothoracic surgery fellowship at the Uni-
versity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 
prior to joining Orlando Health in 2006. 
Dr. Herrera is widely regarded as a pio-
neering senior thoracic surgeon with advanced 
expertise in lung cancer treatment and mini-
mally invasive and robotic surgery. He has re-
ceived a number of prestigious research 
grants, published dozens of journal articles 
and scientific abstracts, and holds academic 
appointments at the colleges of medicine at 
the University of Florida, University of Central 
Florida, and Florida State University. 
In his current role as medical director, Dr. 
Herrera has led the significant growth of the 
Thoracic Oncology Program at Orlando Health 
Cancer Institute. Through effective recruit-
ment, innovative technology, and operational 
efficiencies, he has developed the leading tho-
racic surgery program in Florida. He is now fo-
cused on developing a state-of-the-art lung 
cancer screening program, the first of its kind 
to Florida. Dr. Herrera also serves as co-direc-
tor of the Orlando Health Advanced Robotic 
Surgery Program, chief of the Orlando Health 
Perioperative Governance Committee and 
member of Orlando Health’s Oncology Execu-
tive Cabinet. 
For this and more, we honor Dr. Herrera.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
NATIONAL 
PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS 
MONTH 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in honor of National Prostate Cancer 
Awareness Month and in support of the nearly 
half a million veterans living with prostate can-
cer in the Veterans Health Administration 
(VHA) system. Our nation’s heroes are diag-
nosed with prostate cancer at nearly twice the 
rate of the civilian population, and they de-
serve the best care our nation has to offer. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is 
already a notable leader in prostate cancer 
care through partnerships with the private sec-
tor and the nation’s leading prostate cancer 
researchers and physicians, but improvements 
are needed—especially when it comes to con-
sistent screening protocols and early diag-
nosis. 
I have introduced the Veterans’ Prostate 
Cancer Research and Treatment Act, which 
will give the VA the tools to do just that. 
Prostate cancer is the number one cancer 
diagnosed at the VHA and this bill will improve 
the care our veterans receive every step of 
the way. Whether it be at an early screening, 
the difficult moment a veteran receives a pros-
tate cancer diagnosis, during treatment, during 
recovery, or while receiving end-of-life care, 
our veterans deserve the best. 
16,000 veterans are diagnosed with prostate 
cancer annually—nearly 43 each day. The 
most common cancer diagnosed in the VA 
health system should be met with the most re-
cent clinical data, national expertise, and 
state-of-the-art technology. 
Where a veteran resides should not deter-
mine the quality of care they receive. Early 
screening saves lives and early screening 
should be the standard of care at every VA. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in 
supporting veterans with prostate cancer this 
month by supporting the Veteran’s Prostate 
Cancer Research and Treatment Act.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF COUN-
CIL MEMBER EMERITUS LEON-
ARD PAULITZ 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my constituent from 
the City of Montclair, Council Member Emer-
itus Leonard Paul Paulitz. It is with more than 
a heavy heart that I share that Leonard Paul 
Paulitz passed away on August 24, 2021. 
Leonard committed his life to serving his 
community. Leonard served his country in the 
U.S. Army after getting drafted for World War 
II during his senior year of high school. Shortly 
after earning his degree in accounting at Gan-
non College in Erie, Pennsylvania on the GI 
Bill, Leonard met Constance Marie Howard 
and married her in August, 1954 in Ohio. 
Leonard, his wife, and his children shortly after 
moved to Montclair, California in 1960 and into 
the home where he lived the rest of his life. 
Leonard took an active role in local policy-
making soon after moving to Montclair. He 
served on the Planning Commission starting in 
1965, and then was elected in 1978 to sit on 
the City Council. Leonard served humbly for 
nearly thirty-seven years on the Montclair 
Council Chamber and is the longest-serving 
council person in San Bernardino County, 
from March 1978 to December 2014. During 
this time, he also served as Mayor Pro Tem 
for eight years. 
Leonard’s leadership and vision resulted in 
countless projects that bettered Montclair and 
the 
region, 
including 
the 
expansion 
of 
Montclair Plaza before it became Montclair 
Place, Holt Boulevard, the Montclair Police fa-
cility, the Montclair Youth Center, and the 
Montclair Senior Center. He also served for 12 
years on the South Coast Air Quality Manage-
ment District Governing Board, as Montclair’s 
Representative 
to 
Omnitrans, 
the 
San 
Bernardino Association of Governments, and 
the League of California Cities, among many 
others. 
Leonard’s passion for local government and 
the betterment of his Montclair community is 
just one reason we will miss Leonard. Along 
with being dedicated to his public servant role, 
his love for gardening and tending to his citrus 
trees led Leonard to start the Montclair Com-
munity Garden and Orchard. 
Montclair would not be the beautiful commu-
nity it is now if it wasn’t for the 49 years of 
wise leadership Leonard provided. His service 
and contributions to Montclair will serve as a 
model for many generations and will be a 
good example for future leaders. 
Today, Madam Speaker, for his decades of 
commitment to our community and country in 
so many ways, we honor Leonard Paul Paulitz 
and thank him for the legacy he left in the City 
of Montclair and the greater Inland Empire 
community. May he rest in Peace.

HONORING ANGELITA SEDA FOR

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Hispanic Heritage Month, I honor Angelita 
Seda. Angelita was born in Brooklyn, New 
York to Puerto Rican parents. She began her 
career as a home health aide at a senior care 
center where she developed a passion for 
healthcare. After earning her nursing degree, 
she pursued higher education at Northern 
Essex Community College in Lawrence, Mas-
sachusetts, where she received degrees in 
medical assistance and billing. 
Angelita loves her family. She has four 
daughters and one grandson. Her biggest 
asset is her tenacious attitude and willingness 
to keep trying to help people in need. 
Throughout her career, she has seen many 
people in need of quality healthcare, which 
has led her to develop a work ethic based on 
empathy for her patients. 
As a senior licensed practical nurse at the 
Florida Department of Health in Osceola 
County, her responsibilities include school 
health and ensuring students remain healthy. 
Angelita has worked to provide back-to-school 
vaccinations and health screenings for school- 
aged children. She continues to play an impor-
tant role in COVID–19 testing and vaccina-
tions at the health department. 
For this and more, we honor Angelita Seda.

like to recognize Daniel Millar for achieving the 
rank of Eagle Scout. Daniel graduated from 
Ocean City High School and currently attends 
Rowan University majoring in electrical and 
computer engineering. While in high school, 
Daniel participated on his school’s crew team 
all four years, and also was a member of the 
National Honor Society and Latin club. For his 
Eagle Scout project, Daniel put together a 
public book library exchange located at the 
entrance of Seaspray Beach in Ocean City. 
He worked with the local mayor’s office and 
the Ocean City Public Library to help this 
come to fruition. Daniel thought of the idea be-
cause he worked as an Ocean City Patrol life-
guard and thought that people going to the 
beach would enjoy having the opportunity to 
read a book by the water. Daniel’s innovation 
will help him go on to accomplish anything he 
sets his mind to. God Bless Daniel and God 
Bless America.

REMEMBERING FIRE CHIEF 
WILLIAM F. GODDARD III 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to a Maryland hero and my dear friend, 
Chief William ‘Bill’ Goddard III of Huntingtown, 
Maryland, who passed away September 1. I 
was fortunate to meet Bill many years ago, 
when he was serving as Deputy Chief at the 
Prince George’s County Fire Department, and 
it was a privilege to watch him take on so 
many roles in public service over the years 
and to work closely with him on matters critical 
to the safety of Fifth District residents and all 
Marylanders. 
He began his life of contribution at the age 
of seventeen, serving in the Navy during the 
Vietnam War. After returning home, Bill be-
came a volunteer firefighter at the Glen Dale 
Fire Association. From there, he moved on to 
the Prince George’s County Fire Department, 
where he rose to the rank of Deputy Chief be-
fore leaving to serve the people of Maryland 
as Executive Officer for the State Fire Mar-
shal. In the years that followed, he held var-
ious positions in our state government, from 
Deputy Secretary of State, to Director of the 
Governor’s Board of Public Works, to Chief of 
Staff at the Maryland Department of Transpor-
tation. As we continue to mark the twentieth 
anniversary of 9/11, I would be remiss not to 
acknowledge Bill’s key role as a state safety 
official on that fateful day and in the months 
that followed, providing guidance and exper-
tise on preventing terrorism and ensuring pub-
lic safety. 
Bill had wanted to be a firefighter since he 
was fourteen years old, and his commitment 
to the job and the responsibilities it held never 
wavered. He said the saddest day of his life 
was when he retired from the fire service, and 
he didn’t stay away long. When he got the call 
to serve again in 2009, Bill donned his uniform 
once more as Fire Chief and Emergency Man-
ager for Howard County. In 2018, after retiring 
once more, he accepted an appointment as 
the City Administrator for Laurel, Maryland, re-
turning again to public service. 
In each of his roles, Bill was a tireless advo-
cate for others. Wherever there was need, he 
never hesitated to give of himself and encour-
age others to do the same. He was a true 
public servant in every sense of the term, and 
an irreplaceable community leader. 
More than that, Bill was a loving husband 
and father, and he was a cherished friend to 
me and so many others. All of us who served 
Marylanders alongside him and who knew him 
well share our deepest condolences with his 
beloved wife Marie, with his children—Kellie, 
Jordyn, Emily, and Stephen—and with his 
stepdaughter Brandi. We are grateful that they 
shared Bill with us all those years. Marie was 
truly a partner to Bill in public service, and she 
continues to give so much of her time and en-
ergy to their community. 
I am grateful to have known and worked 
with Bill, and I hope that all of my colleagues 
will join me in paying tribute to his life and leg-
acy. Keeping him in my thoughts, I will con-
tinue to fight for the health and safety of fire-
fighters in Maryland and across our country, 
on whose behalf he advocated so tirelessly 
and effectively.

IN MEMORY OF ALEX ODEH 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to remember October 11th the day that Alex 
Odeh was assassinated 36 years ago. This 
somber anniversary is a stark reminder that 
his killers have still not yet been brought to 
justice. In fact, not a single suspect has been 
named. The pipe bomb that killed Mr. Odeh as 
he opened the door to the American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee’s Santa Ana of-
fice that morning took his life and left a wife 
without a husband, three daughters without a 
father. 
Alex Odeh was a Palestinian-American ac-
tivist and civil rights icon who served as the 
West Coast regional director for the ADC. He 
worked to erode pervasive stereotypes against 
Arabs in the media and stood for the human 
rights of all. The lack of progress in the inves-
tigation into his death is, at the very least, dis-
turbing. For 36 years, the Department of Jus-
tice and FBI have been ignoring what they 
themselves deemed an act of domestic ter-
rorism. Just a year after Mr. Odeh ’s assas-
sination, Rev. Jesse Jackson stood up and 
criticized the FBI’s investigation, and that criti-
cism has only become more prophetic. 
In 2013, 28 years after the bombing that 
took Alex Odeh’s life, Ben Jealous, then the 
President of the NAACP, wrote an op-ed in 
which he compared Mr. Odeh to the civil rights 
icon Medgar Evers, highlighting ‘‘each man’s 
commitment to building bridges beyond his 
community’’. He wrote that Mr. Odeh’s ‘‘life 
and work shared strong parallels with Medgar 
Evers, as did his untimely and tragic death. 
Unlike Medgar Evers, however, the name Alex 
Odeh remains unrecognizable for too many 
Americans, and his murder remains unre-
solved.’’ 
Today, I am introducing a resolution to re-
member the life and work of Alex Odeh and to 
call for justice to be served. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in my call.
