prayer: 
Holy God, we pause in this moment 
to turn our hearts toward You. We ap-
pear before You and enter Your court 
of righteousness that You would re-
ceive our prayers and accept our hum-
ble offering. 
May our efforts not appear meaning-
less but may both our words and our 
actions reflect our trust in Your direc-
tion. May our concerns not burden 
Your patience but invoke Your mercy 
and tender care. 
Do not hide Your eyes from us. 
Though we are prone to wander from 
You, listen to the sincerity of our 
hearts as we yearn to return to You. 
Teach us to cease our wrongdoing that 
we may learn to do what is right. 
May we seek justice, defend the op-
pressed, be willing to bear the cause of 
the orphaned, and work on behalf of 
the grieving. May we in the business at 
hand and in the undertaking of our re-
sponsibilities, live into Your design for 
our days. 
Sanctify our work and purify our 
lives as we move from prayer to pur-
pose. 
We offer this prayer in Your holy 
name. 
Amen.

HONORING SHARON HAWKINS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, along with 
my colleagues Senator MIKE CRAPO, Senator 
JIM RISCH, and Congressman RUSS FULCHER, 
I rise to call attention to the outstanding career 
of Sharon Hawkins, who worked for over 30 
years on public policy to better the lives of 
Idahoans. Sharon, served the last fifteen years 
of her career as the Director of Operations for 
Idaho’s largest business association, the Idaho 
Association of Commerce and Industry, IACI. 
Sharon not only made sure every detail of the 
office ran smoothly, but she was an extremely 
vital resource to the 300 plus business mem-
bers who make up that important organization. 
Before joining IACI, she was the administra-
tive coordinator for the Idaho Consumer- 
Owned Utilities Association, executive assist-
ant to the Chairman and CEO of MGM and 
United Artists Communications, and the office 
administrator for the investment banking firm, 
Merrill Lynch. 
For many, Sharon is an encyclopedia of his-
torical and policy knowledge in the Gem State. 
She knows every player in the business world, 
not only because she worked with them, but 
because she became a caring friend to those 
who crossed her path. 
Sharon is the person you go to when you 
need things done right. She never left a detail 
on the table, or a task undone during her time 
of service. From orchestrating some of the 
most important business events in modern 
Idaho history—to making sure Vice President 
Dick Cheney had a Diet Coke, Sharon never 
missed a beat. 
Her ability to spark conversations, tireless 
work ethic, and thorough knowledge of Idaho 
policy history and business acumen will be 
missed among all who’ve worked with her 
over her three decades of service. We all wish 
her the best in her retirement and to get some 
much-needed rest and relaxation with her hus-
band Cory and her three sons. I thank Sharon 
for her service to Idaho.

HONORING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF JONAH KREPPS 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the distinguished ac-
complishments of Cadet Chief Petty Officer 
Jonah Krepps of Uncasville, Connecticut. As a 
young resident of Eastern Connecticut, Cadet 
Krepps’s committed service to the U.S. Naval 
Sea Cadet Corps (USNSCC) was recognized 
on February 4, 2022, in his promotion to the 
rank of Cadet Chief Petty Officer. 
Chartered in 1962 by an act of Congress, 
the Naval Sea Cadet Corps is a non-profit 
youth group that helps provide young Ameri-
cans aged 10 through 18 with key maritime, 
leadership and teamwork skills. Supporting 
9,000 cadets in 380 units in 47 states includ-
ing Connecticut, the program also provides 
young Americans with valuable experience 
that they can use if they go on to join the 
Armed Services. For Cadet Chief Petty Officer 
Jonah Krepps, this has meant their longtime 
membership in the Nautilus Division, which is 
stationed at the home of our nation’s undersea 
force, SUBASE New London. 
Madam Speaker, as a member of the 
House Armed Service Committee, which has 
made sure that Congress follows through on 
its commitments to this program, I know first-
hand the valuable work that the cadets and 
their leaders do each and every day. This year 
the Nautilus Division recognizes the dedication 
and work ethic of Jonah, and it is conferring 
the honor of being promoted to the position of 
Cadet Chief Petty Officer during the Corps’ 
60th anniversary of preparing our nation’s next 
generation of leaders. To that end, I ask that 
my colleagues in the House join me in thank-
ing Cadet Chief Petty Officer Krepps for his 
initiative and wishing him well in his future en-
deavors. Bravo Zulu.

SALUTING 
THE 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF NOAH 
ASSAD 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to salute Noah Assad for his many posi-
tive contributions to Los Angeles, both as a 
prominent soccer player and as an active 
member of our Los Angeles community. 
Noah Assad was born on May 5, 1990, in 
Puerto Rico. He is co-founder and CEO of the 
record company Rimas Entertainment and the 
Rimas Foundation and is the representative of 
the internationally known artist, Benito Antonio 
Martinez Ocasio. 
Mr. Assad acquired his gift for navigating 
the music business early. At age fourteen, he 
was organizing events in his native Carolina, 
Puerto Rico, bringing in hundreds of people; 
by age nineteen, he was booking local 
reggaeton acts to perform in Colombia. Assad 
started releasing free reggaeton compilations 
to increase demand for the acts he worked 
with. His success continued and Assad 
launched his own label, Rimas Entertainment, 
in 2014. 
Assad has established himself as active 
leader in his fields. He is a hands-on strategist 
and a philanthropic citizen who utilizes his tal-
ents to create unique opportunities for all ages 
to thrive and effectively impact the world. His 
efforts have improved the lives of others and 
laid the groundwork to improve the quality of 
life of those he encounters and the community 
at large. 
Madam Speaker, Noah Assad has shown 
exemplary commitment to the people of Los 
Angeles and beyond, and I am pleased to rec-
ognize his work as a music executive and phi-
lanthropist. I hope my colleagues will join me 
in recognizing his many contributions and his 
positive impact.

THREAT FROM FENTANYL FLOW-
ING OVER OUR SOUTHERN BOR-
DER 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to address a catastrophic mass death in our 
country because of our open borders—all due 
to fentanyl. 
Fentanyl is freely flowing across our south-
ern border as seizures increased by nearly 
135 percent in 2021 under Joe Biden’s laxed 
immigration enforcement. 
In FY 2021. Customs and Border Protection 
seized 11,201 pounds of fentanyl, a historic 
rate that is more than all that was seized in 
2018 and 2019 combined. This amounts to 
enough fentanyl to cause 2,540,341,996 
deaths, or more than 7 times the U.S. popu-
lation. 
The free flow of this deadly drug across our 
border is a direct result of the Biden adminis-
tration’s open border policies. The fact is, Joe 
Biden continues to ignore and fails to address 
the record high overdose deaths caused from 
deadly fentanyl-related substances crossing 
our border. 
As a result, the scourge of fentanyl is de-
stroying our communities, killing our children 
and devastating our families. 
According to the Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration (DEA), U.S. overdose deaths reached 
a devastating new height in 2021, claiming a 
new victim every five minutes. 
There is a direct link between fentanyl-re-
lated overdose deaths and criminal drug car-
tels in Mexico. The ease in which the drug 
cartels operate is shocking. The cartels control 
the borders and are taking full advantage of 
Joe Biden’s weak immigration policies. 
Last December, in my home state of Ari-
zona, the Scottsdale Police Department and 
the Arizona Attorney General’s Office seized a 
record 1.7 million fentanyl pills and 10 kilo-
grams of fentanyl powder. 
During a recent two-month public safety 
surge, the DEA Phoenix Field Division an-
nounced total seizures of over three million 
fentanyl pills and 45 kilograms of fentanyl 
powder. 
Just one fentanyl pill can kill. Yet our open 
borders remain a fentanyl pipeline. 
Instead of securing our southern border to 
stop the flow of fentanyl, Mr. Biden has dou-
bled down on his open-border policies that will

only worsen the ongoing border crisis and de-
stroy more communities and lives. 
Just because Joe Biden ignores the fentanyl 
crisis doesn’t mean Congress should. Con-
gress must address the crisis at the border. 
Congress must also take action and perma-
nently place fentanyl-related substances in 
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. 
The emergency class-wide scheduling order 
for fentanyl-related substances is set to expire 
on February 18, 2022. 
Speaker PELOSI and the Democrats are 
wrong to allow this order to expire.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
RETIRE-
MENT OF JULIE THOMAS FROM 
THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, along with 
my colleagues, Senator MIKE CRAPO and Sen-
ator JAMES E. RISCH, I rise to call attention to 
retirement of Julie Thomas from the U.S. For-
est Service. 
Like many Forest Service employees, Julie 
started her career in 1980 as a seasonal em-
ployee. She was hired as a Seasonal Recre-
ation Technician/Fire Technician on the Twin 
Falls Ranger District in Sawtooth Forest. Julie 
worked in a seasonal capacity on the District 
until August 1990, when she was offered the 
Resource Assistant position on the Twin Falls 
District. 
In October of 1994, while still a Forest Serv-
ice employee, Julie became the Mid-Snake 
Resource 
Conservation 
and 
Development 
(RC&D) Coordinator. She was one of only two 
Forest Service employees shared with the 
Natural Resource Conservation Service in the 
position of RC&D Coordinator. As coordinator, 
she worked and developed relationships with 
many local community leaders and initiated 
projects to help south central Idaho. During 
her tenure as coordinator, she accomplished 
many worthwhile projects, including spear-
heading a $2.5 million request for a congres-
sional funding through the Environmental 
Quality Incentives Program, which helped pro-
ducers in Minidoka County address closing 
antiquated drain wells and partnering with the 
Shoshone District Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, Idaho Power, South Central Idaho Tour-
ism and Recreation Development Association, 
and the College of Southern Idaho to update 
the Mid-Snake Recreation Study. 
Julie worked as the RC&D Coordinator until 
November of 2009, when she accepted the 
position as Public Affairs Officer on the Saw-
tooth National Forest. In this role, she worked 
with Incident Management Teams throughout 
the country, grew and maintained the South- 
Central Idaho Resource Advisory Committee, 
built relationships between the Forest Service 
and the Idaho Congressional Delegation, was 
a leader in Forest Civil Rights, and was recog-
nized in the Forest Service Intermountain Re-
gion as leader in employee deployment and 
engagement. Above all, Julie was a friend to 
all in the Forest Service. On December 31, 
2021, Julie retired from the Forest Service 
after a 41-year career. 
We thank Julie for her loyal service to the 
Forest Service and south-central Idaho. We 
have enjoyed working with her. We hope she 
enjoys her well-deserved retirement.

CONGRATULATING COLIN 
DEMAREST 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, congratulations to Colin Demarest, 
an appreciated journalist of Aiken, South 
Carolina, 
for 
his 
new 
assignment 
at 
C4ISRNET, a publication covering emerging 
issues and trends in global military trans-
formation in Washington. A graduate of the 
University of South Carolina, Colin began his 
journalism career at The Berkshire View as a 
featured writer. Later, he became an editor 
and reporter at Limestone Communications, 
where he covered government in five different 
cities and two regional school districts. 
When he joined the Aiken Standard, Colin 
initially focused on reporting on the Aiken city 
government. After some time, he was as-
signed to report on the Savannah River Site 
National Laboratory, a multi-billion dollar facil-
ity with about 11,000 employees. At times, this 
assignment brought him to Washington, D.C., 
where he reported on anything involving the 
Savannah River Site. 
Colin was thoughtful to come to many 
events over the years. He would report on my 
Legislative Agenda Tours, Bus Tours, and any 
other local events that I attended in South 
Carolina. As a former journalist myself, I know 
Colin will be successful at his new assignment 
reporting from the Pentagon. I wish the best 
for Colin Demarest in all his future endeavors.

HONORING BUILDER NAVY CHIEF 
PETTY OFFICER RAYMOND BOR-
DER 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the official renaming of the Gulf-
port Fitness Center in honor of Builder Chief 
Petty Officer Raymond Border. 
Raymond Border was born on July 22, 
1980, in Coshocton, Ohio. He enlisted in the 
Navy on September 22, 1999. Upon comple-
tion of Builder A-school Gulfport, MS BUC 
Border completed successful tours deploying 
twice with Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 
ONE. His daughter, Shelva Border and son 
Donavan Border currently still live in Gulfport. 
His father Craig Border and mother Julie Bor-
der live in West Lafayette, Ohio. 
A few months after returning home from de-
ployment in 2011 to Afghanistan’s Helmand 
Province with Naval Mobile Construction Bat-
talion 74 BUC Border volunteered for an Indi-
vidual Augmentee billet on a Provincial Recon-
struction Team and returned to Afghanistan, 
where he lost his life in the line of duty. 
For his outstanding service, BUC Border 
was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star 
(with combat V), Purple Heart, and Combat 
Action Ribbon. He was awarded the Navy and 
Marine Corps Achievement Medal and the 
Navy Commendation Medal during his pre-
vious naval service. 
Traditionally Seabee facilities are named 
after Seabees that have paid the ultimate sac-
rifice in the service of their country. BUC Bor-
der was killed when an improvised explosive 
device detonated while he was executing a 
road assessment for a convoy in Paktika Prov-
ince, Afghanistan, on October 19, 2011. 
BUC Border perfectly embodies what it 
means to be a true American hero and I can 
think of no better fit than BUC Raymond J. 
Border the first Seabee, and first Chief Petty 
Officer from the Seabee Fleet Concentration 
Area in Gulfport to receive this distinct honor. 
His memory proudly represents all Seabees 
that deployed to Afghanistan and made the ul-
timate sacrifice in service to our country. Our 
military servicemembers deserve to be recog-
nized for their commitment to our great nation 
and I am grateful for his unwavering dedica-
tion to our country. The naming of the Fitness 
Center will allow the Seabees to be able to 
permanently remember and honor one of their 
fallen Seabees and Chief Petty Officers.

have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name 
of freedom by maintaining memorials to their 
service and sharing their history with our na-
tion’s youth to ensure our nation’s Veterans 
will never be forgotten. The 470,000 members 
of the VFW Auxiliary all represent the families 
of those who have served or are currently 
serving on foreign soil protecting our freedom. 
Member volunteers have conducted nearly 
one million hours in Veterans Affairs Medical 
Centers and other hospitals throughout the 
country. I thank them for their tireless service 
to our country and to Veterans and their fami-
lies.

HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN 
OF TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the service, 
dedication, and sacrifice of the members of 
the 60th Air Mobility Wing, the 349th Air Mobil-
ity Wing, the 621st Contingency Response 
Wing, and their partner agencies at Travis Air 
Force Base, which I have the distinct privilege 
of representing as part of California’s Third 
Congressional District. They exemplify the 
best of America, and their tireless efforts guar-
antee the safety of all those who call America 
home. 
For eighty years, Travis Air Force Base has 
stood as a pillar of strength, projecting peace 
and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and pro-
viding support to American troops around the 
world. This mission is only accomplished 
thanks to the blood, sweat, and fortitude of the 
18,000 airmen and their families that maintain 
the highest levels of readiness and capability. 
Every single day this all-volunteer force pro-
vides essential aerial refueling, airlift oper-
ations, aeromedical evacuation, highly-special-
ized rapid response contingency operations 
capabilities, 
and 
unmatched 
support 
to 
produce and execute rapid global mobility in 
support of our national defense. 
Last year alone the men and women of 
Travis Air Force Base met a challenge of co-
lossal scale when they played a pivotal role in 
completing the drawdown of forces from Af-
ghanistan. Team Travis aircrews evacuated 
12,962 Afghans while managing security and 
operations at the airport in Kabul. 
The valor and heroism displayed by the 
men and women of Travis was imitable and 
worthy of recognition. Last month, I spoke with 
Captain Kayleigh Migaleddi, who helped evac-
uate 117 orphan children from the region dur-
ing Operation Allies Refuge. She spoke about 
how she would have been at the Abbey Gate 
the moment a suicide bomber killed 13 Ameri-
cans had it not been for an orphaned child 
who needed her assistance elsewhere on 
base. With tears in her eyes, she told me that 
she owed her life to that child, who she later 
helped reach safety and begin a new life. 
Captain Migaleddi’s story is just one of the 
many stories I heard that exemplify the char-
acter leadership, and bravery that is cultivated 
at Travis Air Force Base. Service records only 
scratch the surface of the courageous actions 
performed by these men and women. They 
put their hearts and lives on the line to save 
so many. I am grateful every day that I have 
the opportunity to represent such an upstand-
ing community in Congress. 
This total force effort of active and reserve 
airmen directly enabled the largest non-
combatant evacuation operation in known 
world history, ultimately saving over 124,000 
lives. Simply put, Travis Air Force Base is the 
very best our nation has to offer. Its strategic 
importance stands as a beacon of hope to our 
allies and a stern reminder of American re-
solve to our enemies. On behalf of a grateful 
nation and all the constituents of California’s 
Third Congressional District, I would like to 
thank the men and women of Travis Air Force 
Base and express my sincere gratitude for 
their sacrifice and contributions to the defense 
of this great nation.

RECOGNIZING 
JAMES 
BROGNA, 
UNICO 
NATIONAL 
SCRANTON 
CHAPTER’S 
UNICAN 
OF 
THE 
YEAR 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor James Brogna who will be 
named the UNICAN of the Year for the 
UNICO National Scranton Chapter. He will be 
recognized at the Chapter’s annual Charity 
Ball on February 26. 
James is the son of Frank and the late 
Marie Lombardo and the brother of Frank, re-
tired Lieutenant Colonel of the U.S. Marine 
Corps. He attended Bloomsburg University 
where he earned his BA in mass communica-
tions and public relations, and he earned his 
MS 
in 
organizational 
management 
from 
Misericordia University. 
James began his career in television and 
radio, spending five years at WVIA Public 
Broadcasting and working at WGGY–FM and 
part time at WBRE TV. In 1999, he joined Al-
lied Services Integrated Health System as the 
Director of Development. He currently serves 
as the Vice President of Strategic Partnership 
for the organization. 
James has been fiercely dedicated to serv-
ing his community. He is a current board 
member of the Greater Wyoming Valley 
Chamber and Leadership Wilkes-Barre, and 
he was elected to the Crestwood School Dis-
trict’s Board of Education in 2019. His exper-
tise in the health and human services industry 
helped guide Northeastern Pennsylvania dur-
ing COVID–19 through his service on the 
Luzerne County Pandemic Task Force and the 
S.O.S. NEPA Nursing Home Pandemic Task 
Force. He is a past member and former board 
member of the Rotary Club of the Abingtons 
and the Kiwanis Club of Mountain Top. He 
has been active with both Catholic Social 
Services of Lackawanna and Wayne Counties 
and the Association of Fundraising Profes-
sionals (AFP) as a past Chair and Board 
Member. 
In 2010, he co-founded WNEP–TV Ryan’s 
Run Campaign which has raised more than $4 
million for Allied Services. James himself has 
finished ten marathons, including the New 
York City, Scranton, and Marine Corps Mara-
thons. James is also an effective fundraiser, 
championing veterans’ causes like Catholic 
Social Services’ St. Francis Commons for Vet-
erans and Team Red, White & Blue, estab-
lishing a local chapter of the organization that 
helps veterans thrive in their transition from 
military to civilian life. 
His 
sharp 
business 
acumen 
and 
his 
unyielding generosity with his time have 
earned him recognition as a Top 40 under 40 
in Business in 2008 and the Outstanding 
Alumni Award from Leadership Wilkes-Barre. 
He was also named an Outstanding Fund-
raising Professional from the AFP and a Paul 
Harris Fellow Award recipient by Rotary Inter-
national. He shares his extensive knowledge 
as a guest lecturer at the University of Scran-
ton, Marywood University, and Misericordia 
University for undergraduate and masters level 
courses in marketing, non-profit leadership, 
and health care management. 
I am honored to join with the Scranton 
Chapter of UNICO National in recognizing 
James for his commitment to his community 
and the work he does to uphold Allied Serv-
ices’ mission. May he continue to feel inspired 
and moved to work on behalf of the people of 
Northeastern Pennsylvania.

CALLING FOR BALANCED BUDGET 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, the House is 
set to take up a third stopgap funding bill 
since the fiscal year started back in October 
2021. 
Let me phrase that differently. We are near-
ly halfway into fiscal year 2022 and Congress 
has yet to fund the government. 
America is flat broke. Last week the Treas-
ury Department announced that our national 
debt exceeds 830 trillion, reaching a calami-
tous level and tripling in the last decade. Infla-
tion is at a historic 40-year high. Yet Congress 
cannot do its basic job and pass a budget on 
time. 
Instead of addressing real issues facing our 
nation, the House of Representatives is once 
again kicking the can for three more weeks to 
give Congress additional time to try to pass 
another bloated budget. 
Congress cannot spend its way into pros-
perity, and we must end the frantic habit of 
governing from one crisis to another. Instead 
of running up bills we can’t pay for, we should 
be funding the common-sense priorities of the 
American people, including securing the bor-
der, adequately funding our military, reducing 
taxes and eliminating job-killing regulations. 
Today, I reiterate my call for a balanced 
budget. If we cannot balance the budget ra-
tionally, we need a balanced budget constitu-
tional amendment that would force Congress 
to live within its means, like everyone else. 
I have spent my time in Congress trying to 
reduce spending and stopping this nonsense. 
I will be voting against this irresponsible kick- 
the-can-down-the-road continuing resolution. 
Spending more money that we don’t have will 
not solve our nation’s fiscal problems. 
All of us will pay the price in the future. Un-
fortunately, our children and grandchildren will 
be most impacted. This is immoral to harm fu-
ture generations but that is what today’s con-
tinuing resolution does.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E142 
February 11, 2022 
State legislator, community businessman, and 
Magic Valley cultural historian. Steve, as he 
was called by his family and friends, passed 
away on December 31, 2021, at 77 years old. 
Steve was born on September 30, 1944 in 
Baltimore, Maryland, one of twin sons of Vin-
cent and Frances Hartgen. He grew up in rural 
Orono, Maine, spending his young years in 
the state’s forests, and along its trout streams 
and coastlines. He graduated from Hebron 
Academy in Hebron, Maine, in 1962, and from 
Amherst College in 1966. He later earned an 
MA degree from Brandeis University in 1968, 
and a PhD from the University of Minnesota in 
1976, both in American history. 
He began his newspaper career while in 
college as an intern reporter at the Bangor 
Daily News in Bangor, Maine. He went on to 
work as a reporter and editor at The Min-
neapolis Star, and later at the San Diego 
Union and the Casper Star-Tribune as man-
aging editor. He also taught journalism, media 
history and public affairs reporting at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota and Ohio State Univer-
sity. 
Steve came to Twin Falls in 1982 as editor 
of the Times-News. working alongside then- 
publisher William E. Howard and general man-
ager Richard High as Howard publications ex-
panded across the country. By 1990, he was 
promoted to publisher of the Times-News. 
In his years at the Times-News, Steve’s 
leadership raised the newspaper’s visibility 
and impact, making it one of the state’s lead-
ing conservative newspapers. His common- 
sense and fiscally responsible editorial per-
spectives earned him much respect among 
business leaders, public officials and the com-
munity. It was during his time at the Times- 
News when we had the opportunity to meet 
and talk with Steve during our many interviews 
with the editorial board. We greatly enjoyed 
our lively visits with Steve. 
Not one to be idle, Steve continued his in-
volvement in the Magic Valley community after 
he left the newspaper in 2005. He became Ex-
ecutive Director of Business Plus, a Magic 
Valley economic development group, which 
brought hundreds of new jobs and more than 
$2 billion investment dollars to the valley. The 
growth was so spectacular that then Governor 
C. L. ‘‘Butch’’ Otter called it the ‘‘Magic Valley 
Miracle.’’ 
Steve was a stalwart member of the Twin 
Falls County Republican Central Committee 
where he served as state committeeman for 
more than a decade, from 2008 to 2019. He 
also served on the Idaho Capitol Commission 
from 1998 to 2016, a group which oversaw the 
renovation and remodel of Idaho’s premier 
public building. 
In 2008, Steve was appointed to the Idaho 
House of Representatives by Gov. Otter 
where he served until 2019. While in the legis-
lature, Steve chaired the Commerce & Human 
Resources Committee. He retired from the 
legislature for health reasons at the end of 
2018 and was replaced by his wife Rep. Linda 
Wright Hartgen. 
Following his retirement, Steve wrote exten-
sively on the cultural history and patterns of 
Life in the Magic Valley and southern Idaho, 
publishing ‘‘Tradition & Progress: Southern 
Idaho’s Growth Since 1990’’ in 2019, and 
‘‘Spirit of Place: Southern Idaho Values Across 
Generations’’ in 2020. Additionally, he wrote 
columns for several Idaho newspapers and 
blog sites on southern Idaho politics and cul-
tural changes. His books and columns fre-
quently reflected his love of the Magic Valley, 
which he often called the best region in the 
best state in the best nation on the planet. 
Beyond his media work and his public serv-
ice, Steve maintained an interest in western 
history, particularly the settlement of southern 
Idaho. He was also an avid fly fisherman, an 
outdoor activity he learned as a young man in 
Maine. 
In his later years, Steve developed health 
problems, but he continued to serve in public 
roles and did not think of himself as disabled 
in any way. Steve is survived by his devoted 
wife Rep. Linda Wright Hartgen and his family. 
While we will miss Steve’s common-sense 
approach to public issues, fiscal policy and 
statewide public affairs, we will miss his friend-
ship the most. Rest in peace, good friend, and 
loyal servant.

HONORING QUINLAN-HAMMOND 
HALL OF HONOR 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, today we 
celebrate the dedication and ribbon cutting 
ceremony for the Quinlan-Hammond Hall of 
Honor at the University of Southern Mis-
sissippi. 
The Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor is a 
state-of-the-art facility that represents the Uni-
versity of Southern Mississippi’s commitment 
to honor our nation’s heroes. The dedication 
ceremony will honor Joe Quinlan, USM alum-
nus and lead benefactor for the Hall of Honor, 
as well as U.S. Army Major General (Retired) 
Jeff Hammond, USM alumnus and former 
Golden Eagles Football Team Captain and 
Quarterback. These two gentlemen have 
earned this recognition for their service to the 
Golden Eagle community. 
The University’s Center for Military Vet-
erans, Service Members and Families pro-
vides guidance and support to Student-Vet-
erans in their academic and professional pur-
suits. Major General Jeff Hammond, who 
serves as the Center’s Director, has led the 
University of Southern Mississippi to earn nu-
merous prestigious recognitions, including the 
top Military Caring University across the State 
of Mississippi, designation as a Purple Heart 
Institution, and ranking No. 1 in the Southeast 
by Military Times in its ‘‘Best for Vets: Col-
leges 2021 Rankings.’’ 
The new Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor 
will provide more than 1,700 USM Military Stu-
dents and Student-Veterans with a home of 
their own that is commensurate with the honor 
of which they are deserving. 
Today is a special day. The dedication and 
ribbon cutting ceremony for the Quinlan-Ham-
mond Hall of Honor symbolizes the University 
of Southern Mississippi’s continued commit-
ment and gratitude to our nation’s heroes for 
their unwavering dedication to our country. As 
a Marine veteran and USM alumnus, I want to 
thank the University’s Administration, the USM 
Foundation, and the more than 150 USM 
alumni donors who made the construction of 
the new Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor pos-
sible for their commitment to honor those who 
serve. SMTTT. 
Semper Fidelis.

IRAN UNVEILS MISSILE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the clearest revelation of Iran with 
duplicitous intent in the insane nuclear agree-
ment discussions is uninterrupted missile de-
velopment designed for nuclear attacks on 
Israel and the United States. 
The murderous boasting of capabilities is 
confirmed by a Reuters report by Parisa 
Hafezi published by February 9, 2022. While 
negotiators blather with meaningless dead-
lines, the delivery systems continue unabated. 
It is crucial we stand with Saudi Arabia and 
our Arab Gulf partners. 
I appreciate the efforts of the America Israel 
Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to alert the 
American people of the growing threats. Presi-
dent Betsy Korn and South Carolina Midlands 
coordinator Dr. David Kulbersh are crucial for 
raising the alarm over Iran’s murderous intent. 
I am also confident the venerated American 
Jewish Congress led by Jack Rosen will raise 
awareness of the growing threat. 
[From Reuters, Feb. 9, 2022] 
IRAN UNVEILS LONG-RANGE MISSILE AS 
VIENNA NUCLEAR TALKS RESUME 
(By Parisa Hafezi) 
DUBAI.—Iran unveiled a new domestically- 
made missile with a range of 1,450 kilometers 
on Wednesday, state TV reported, a day after 
Tehran and Washington resumed indirect 
talks to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal. 
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile 
programmes in the Middle East, says its bal-
listic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km 
(1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its 
arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region. 
State TV displayed the new surface-to-sur-
face ‘‘Kheibar Shekan’’ (Kheibar buster) mis-
sile, which refers to an ancient Jewish oasis 
called Kheibar in the Arabian Peninsula’s 
Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim 
warriors in the 7th century. 
‘‘This long-range missile is domestically 
manufactured by the Revolutionary Guards 
(IRGC). . . . It has high accuracy and is pro-
pelled by solid fuel and is capable of pene-
trating missile shields,’’ Iranian state media 
reported. 
Tehran regards its missile programme as 
an important deterrent against the United 
States, Israel and other adversaries. It has 
rejected Western demands to halt its bal-
listic missile work. 
‘‘Iran will continue advancing its ballistic 
missile programme,’’ Iran’s armed forces 
chief of staff Major General Mohammad 
Bagheri told a ceremony at an IRGC base

Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, my col-
league, Mr. DONALDS from Florida, and I are 
grateful to recognize the Spring Swing Sun 
Safety partnership between Moffitt Cancer 
Center and Major League Baseball. This part-
nership works to prevent skin cancer by offer-
ing sun safety education and free skin cancer 
screenings at Spring Training baseball games. 
Such efforts are important here in Florida, the 
Sunshine State, where we see a high inci-
dence of melanoma and other deadly forms of 
skin cancer. 
We are pleased, therefore, to join with 
Moffitt Cancer Center and Major League 
Baseball to raise awareness to combat this 
disease. It is important to limit sun exposure 
when possible, wear sunscreen if you are in 
the sun, and have your skin checked by a 
health care professional once a year. We 
hope all baseball fans safely enjoy Florida’s 
sunshine and the great tradition of Spring 
Training baseball in our state.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF 
ORVAL MULLEN’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. Orval Mullen, an outstanding cit-
izen from Van Wert, Ohio who will celebrate 
his 100th birthday on February 22, 2022. 
Orval has led a long, productive life, and his 
family is very grateful to have the opportunity 
to celebrate this significant birthday with him. 
Reaching this momentous milestone provides 
the opportunity to recognize Orval’s many ac-
complishments in life, but especially his serv-
ice to our country. 
During World War II, Orval served as a field 
lineman in the Eighth Regiment of the Fourth 
Infantry of the U.S. Army from October 14, 
1942, to September 25, 1945. Orval landed on 
Utah Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and he 
fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 
1944. In April of 1945, Orval and the soldiers 
of the Eighth Regiment assisted in the libera-
tion of the concentration camp in Dachau. He 
was awarded two Purple Hearts for his serv-
ice. He also received a Bronze Star and the 
French Legion of Honor, as well as several 
other medals. 
After completing his military service, he 
started O.H. Mullen Sales in the 1950s and 
owned and operated the business until the 
mid-1980s. His company manufactured, sold, 
and distributed archery equipment. He married 
Luella Conley on October 24, 1942, and they 
were together for 74 years until her passing in 
2016. They had three children: Dr. Orval Lee 
Mullen, James Mullen of Oakwood, and Judith 
Wieging of Willshire. The family has grown to 
include grandchildren and great-grandchildren, 
who will join the community in best wishes for 
his 100th birthday. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating Orval Mullen’s 100th birth-
day. Orval is most worthy of this recognition, 
and I thank him for serving our country. On 
behalf of the people of the Fifth Congressional 
District of Ohio, I wish Orval a very happy 
birthday and his family all the best.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
OSCAR G. JOHNSON VAMC DIREC-
TOR JAMES RICE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 33-year career of the 
Director of the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical 
Center, James Rice. Through his commitment 
to our Veterans and his local communities, 
James has become an indispensable part of 
the State of Michigan, the Upper Peninsula, 
and northern Wisconsin. 
James was born in Clare, MI and attended 
Central Michigan University for his Bachelor’s 
and Master’s degrees. Following college, he 
started his career in the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration (VHA) in 1990 as the Safety & 
Occupational Health Manager at the Allen 
Park VAMC in southeastern Michigan. In addi-
tion, he served in a VHA leadership position in 
Washington, D.C., as the Acting Director of 
Safety and Technical Services, After success-
fully serving in multiple roles within the Vet-
erans integrated Services Network (VISN) 11 
and 12 for over two decades, James was ap-
pointed to Acting Director for the Oscar G. 
Johnson VA Medical Center in 2011. 
Under Director Rice’s outstanding leader-
ship, Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center 
continues to set the national standard for med-
ical care within the VHA and serves tens of 
thousands of our nation’s Veterans across the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern 
Wisconsin. Along with his work at the Iron 
Mountain VAMC, he oversaw six Community 
Based Outpatient Clinics in Michigan and Wis-
consin including Ironwood, Hancock, Mar-
quette. Menominee, Sault Ste Marie and 
Rhinelander to offer Veterans the support and 
care they need closer to home. In addition, 
Oscar G. Johnson continues to receive 5-star 
ratings from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services and has been nationally 
recognized 
through 
several 
VHA-related 
awards including the Best Experience Award 
for Level 3 Medical Centers, the Best Patient 
Experience Award, and the Dickinson County 
Chamber of Commerce’s ‘‘Large Business of 
the Year Award.’’ For fiscal year 2021, James 
was also awarded the Meritorious Executive 
Presidential Rank Award for his decades of 
leadership in VISN 11 and 12 and longtime 
dedication to our Veterans. 
Madam Speaker. I ask you to join me in 
honoring the career and service of Director 
James Rice. The example he has set over the 
last three decades inspires us all and will con-
tinue to do so for future successors of his po-
sition, 
Michigan 
and 
Wisconsin’s 
retired 
servicemembers, their families, caregivers, 
and the VA staff he proudly led will forever be 
thankful for his contributions. We wish him the 
best on his future endeavors and look forward 
to seeing what his next mission will be.

COMMENDING 
ISRAEL-BAHRAIN 
SECURITY COOPERATION AGREE-
MENT 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend the historic signing of the security 
cooperation agreement between Israel and 
Bahrain, which took place on February 3, 
2022. This security agreement is the first of its 
kind between Israel and a Gulf nation. 
Since Bahrain signed the 2020 Abraham 
Accords and took the important step of nor-
malizing relations with Israel, the two countries 
have significantly deepened their bilateral rela-
tionship. Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gautz 
travelled to Manama, Bahrain’s capital, to sign 
this agreement and celebrates the agreement 
as ‘‘a new high point’’ in the countries’ rela-
tionship. 
The MoU agreement is designed to help ad-
vance intelligence cooperation, establish a 
framework for military exercises and strength-
en ties between the countries’ defense indus-
tries. As Israel and Bahrain continue to 
strengthen their cooperation, the signing of 
this memorandum of understanding (MoU) is a 
key step. 
This historic agreement comes at a time of 
increased danger in the region as Iran con-
tinues to threaten the security of its neighbors. 
The MoU will help deepen regional security 
cooperation and resilience, which is critical to 
defending the interests of the United States, 
Israel, Bahrain, and many other countries in 
the region.

Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise

U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps (USNSCC) was 
recognized on February 1, 2022, in his pro-
motion to the rank of Cadet Chief Petty Offi-
cer. 
Chartered in 1962 by an act of Congress. 
the Naval Sea Cadet Corps is a non-profit 
youth group that helps provide young Ameri-
cans aged 10 through 18 with key maritime, 
leadership and teamwork skills. Supporting 
9,000 cadets in 380 units in 47 states includ-
ing Connecticut, the program also provides 
young Americans with valuable experience 
that they can use if they go on to join the 
Armed Services. For Cadet Chief Petty Officer 
Whiteside, this has meant their longtime mem-
bership in the Nautilus Division, which is sta-
tioned at the home of our nation’s undersea 
force, SUBASE New London. 
Madam Speaker, as a member of the 
House Armed Service Committee, which has 
made sure that Congress follows through on 
its commitments to this program, I know first-
hand the valuable work that the cadets and 
their leaders do each and every day. This year 
the Nautilus Division recognizes the dedication 
and work ethic of Joe, and it is conferring the 
honor of being promoted to the position of 
Cadet Chief Petty Officer during the Corps’ 
60th anniversary of preparing our nation’s next 
generation of leaders. To that end, I ask that 
my colleagues in the House join me in thank-
ing Cadet Chief Petty Officer Whiteside for his 
initiative and wishing him well in his future en-
deavor. Bravo Zulu.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. BENITO 
ANTONIO MARTINEZ OCASIO 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the accomplishments and 
contributions 
of 
Benito 
Antonio 
Martinez 
Ocasio. 
Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio was born 
on March 10, 1994, in Almirante Sur, Vega 
Baja, Puerto Rico. Mr. Martinez Ocasio want-
ed to be a singer since he was five years old 
and pursued the studied audiovisual commu-
nication at the University of Puerto Rico at 
Recinto de Arecibo before leaving the program 
to pursue his music career. 
A native of Puerto Rico, Martinez Ocasio, 
has been a great force in the rise of the is-
land’s popular reggaeton music. His parents 
Lysaurie Ocasio Declet and Tito Martinez and 
family inspired his music aspirations. His 
mother Lysaurie encouraged Martinez Ocasio 
into music at a young age in his church choir. 
Benito’s family instilled in him the belief that 
life is not measured by the amount of money 
or trophies a person has but rather the chal-
lenges overcome and an appreciation for life. 
Mr. Martinez Ocasio is actively involved in 
the betterment of his community, Los Angeles 
County, and in neighborhoods across our 
great nation including his hometown of 
Almirante Sur, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. He 
has been recognized by countless local lead-
ers in Los Angeles County and throughout 
California for his tremendous support to the 
community and dedication to assisting those in 
need. 
In 2018, Martinez Ocasio was vacationing in 
Puerto Rico when he decided to make a gen-
erous donation of $100,000 to the nonprofit or-
ganization SER of Puerto Rico. The donation 
supported children with autism and muscular 
disabilities who require rehabilitation. At the 
end of a telethon that he participated in, SER 
received $1.7 million in donations. Martinez 
Ocasio has been a role model for disability 
communities and is working to ensure that one 
day the cure for autism is found. One in thirty 
five children born today will have Autism, but 
people like Mr. Martinez Ocasio have given 
hope to millions in the fight to find the cure 
one day. 
Martinez Ocasio has not forgotten his hum-
ble roots and the neighborhood that had a 
profound impact on his upbringing and has 
given back his time and resources to his com-
munity. In one instance, Martinez Ocasio 
helped a 13-year-old Cayman Islands boy who 
was residing in a hospital and in need of thou-
sands of dollars to cover his medical ex-
penses including a needed heart transplant 
surgery. When the boy’s story caught his at-
tention, Martinez Ocasio brought public aware-
ness to the boy’s critical need for an expen-
sive surgery and called on other artists as well 
as ordinary people to donate any amount they 
could afford. Together they successfully raised 
the necessary resources for the boy’s surgery. 
Martinez Ocasio has led the way in helping 
others in California in the City and County of 
Los Angeles, focusing on assisting Angelenos 
with developmental disabilities. He has estab-
lished himself as a leader and a charitable 
American utilizing his talents to create unique 
opportunities for all ages to thrive and impact 
the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Benito Antonio Martinez 
Ocasio and applauding his contributions and 
philanthropic endeavors.

CELEBRATING THE GOLDEN ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE TOLEDO CHAP-
TER OF DELTA SIGMA THETA 
SORORITY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Toledo Chapter of the Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority. Its members will gather 
in a special celebration in Toledo, Ohio on 
Saturday February 12, 2022 to celebrate this 
milestone occasion. 
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority is an organiza-
tion of college educated women dedicated to 
public service and the development of women, 
with a focus on the Black community. Its 
world-wide services offer support through the 
organization’s 
‘‘Five-Point 
Programmatic 
Thrust: Economic Development; Educational 
Development; International Awareness and In-
volvement; Physical and Mental Health; and 
Political Awareness and Involvement.’’ 
Since its founding, more than 350,000 
women have been part of Delta Sigma Theta 
Sorority. The sorority currently has over 1,000 
collegiate and alumnae chapters located in the 
United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, the 
Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Ja-
maica, the Republic of Korea, the Arabian 
Gulf, Southern Africa, and Western Africa. 
Among the chapters is one in Toledo, Ohio. 
The Toledo chapter notes in its history: ‘‘In 
1937, the first chapter of Delta Sigma Theta 
Sorority, Inc. in Toledo, Ohio was formed by 
seven young women. They were Louise 
Burgette, Mamie Duffy, Lillian Duffy, Con-
stance Heslip, Mayola Senior, Ella P. Stewart, 
and Frances Wade. Beta Lambda Mixed 
Chapter consisted of undergraduates at The 
University Toledo, Mary Manse College and 
graduates residing in the city.’’ 
‘‘On February 12, 1972, Lillian P. Benbow, 
the National President of Delta Sigma Theta, 
came to Toledo to establish the Alumnae 
Chapter. The graduate members formed the 
Toledo Alumnae Chapter and Beta Lambda 
became the city-wide undergraduate collegiate 
chapter.’’ 
‘‘Delta has been involved in numerous ac-
tivities that emphasize scholarship, public 
service, and international involvement. Break-
fast for M’Lady has been its annual fundraiser 
for years at which graduating high school sen-
iors are awarded scholarships. The chapter 
has also sponsored a Habitat for Humanity 
house in Africa. Voter registration activities, 
mentoring and tutoring children through its 
Delta Academy programs, sponsoring and par-
ticipating in mental and physical health aware-
ness events are just some of the ways the 
chapter has given back to our community.’’ 
Civil rights and social justice icon Angela 
Davis encouraged ‘‘We must always attempt 
to lift as we climb.’’ For fifty years, the mem-
bers of the Toledo Chapter of Delta Sigma 
Theta have done just that. Always in pursuit of 
higher goals through the generations, the 
women of the chapter have grown and nur-
tured future leaders. As they look back on a 
half-century of progress, I know they are in-
spired toward the next.

TRIBUTE TO RETIRED SERGEANT 
MARIO SALAZAR ON THE OCCA-
SION OF HIS PASSING 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 11, 2022 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor 
the passing of retired Sergeant Mario Salazar 
of the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Depart-
ment. Sergeant Salazar was born in Highland 
and served our community loyally for 28 years 
before retiring in January 2019. His passing 
on January 22nd of this year is a solemn loss 
for our San Bernardino County law enforce-
ment community and the people of California’s 
8th District. 
Sergeant Salazar began his career in Cali-
fornia’s 8th District in 1991 as a patrol duty of-
ficer at the Central Detention Center and the 
Fontana and Highland stations. He served our 
communities with outstanding dedication for 
14 years before being promoted to detective in 
2005 and then again to sergeant in 2009. 
Mario was critical to San Bernardino County 
Sheriffs Department operations during his 28- 
year tenure, and his leadership proved to be 
an invaluable asset. 
Throughout his life, Mario was committed to 
our community. As a part of our sheriffs de-
partment he relished opportunities to engage 
with the community, to meet new people, and 
to lend a helping hand. Mario is survived by

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the cost esti-
mate prepared by the Congressional Budget 
Office for H.R. 5633, the Department of 
Homeland Security Inspector General Trans-
parency Act. The cost estimate was not avail-
able at the time of the Committee report filing.

Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MR. CHAIRMAN: The Congressional 
Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost 
estimate for H.R. 5633, the Department of 
Homeland Security Inspector General Trans-
parency Act. 
If you wish further details on this esti-
mate, we will be pleased to provide them.

four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 
2032? No. 
Mandate Effects:

Contains private-sector mandate? No. 
H.R. 5633 would require the Office of the In-
spector General (OIG) at the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) to submit to the 
Congress any reports substantiating viola-
tions of certain personnel policies and alle-
gations of misconduct, fraud, or abuse within 
DHS involving members of the Senior Execu-
tive Service or political appointees. This re-
quirement would apply to reports finalized 
on or after 30 days from the bill’s enactment, 
and reports would need to be published on 
the OIG website. The bill also would require 
the OIG to include information regarding on-
going audits, inspections, and evaluations in 
its semiannual reports and submit an addi-
tional report on compliance to the Congress 
within one year. Finally, H.R. 5633 would re-
quire the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) to evaluate the OIG compliance report 
after one year. 
Based on information from the OIG, CBO 
expects the office would need three addi-
tional employees to conduct investigations 
and compile reports and two additional em-
ployees to communicate with and collect in-
formation from other DHS offices. Assuming 
they are hired at the beginning of fiscal year 
2023, CBO estimates the cost to the OIG for 
these employees would be about $5 million 
over the 2022–2026 period. Additionally, based 
on the cost of similar activities, CBO esti-
mates the cost to GAO of producing its eval-
uation would be less than $500,000 over the 
2022–2026 period. All such spending would be 
subject to the availability of appropriated 
funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Lindsay Wylie. The estimate was reviewed 
by Leo Lex, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.
