tinue to consider social concerns about 
peace and justice in our communities. 
As it is a time of high feeling and re-
action, we ask Your blessing of peace, 
patience, and good discernment in the 
days and weeks to come. 
Opinions and positions of interested 
parties are heightened. Calm our pas-
sions, that those responsible for mold-
ing a future in the wake of such monu-
mental shifts in our sense of what is 
normal or usual are taking place. 
We thank You that we, as Americans, 
have faced such challenges in the past. 
Help us to have faith in You, and con-
fidence in our constitutional way of 
proceeding, that we have good cause to 
have hope in what is to come. 
Bless us all this day, and every day, 
and may all that we do be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT LEVELS OF ON- 
BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FY 2020 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, June 11, 2020. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting 
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for 
fiscal year 2020. This status report is current 
through June 5, 2020. The term ‘‘current 
level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and 
revenues estimated for each fiscal year based 
on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s 
signature. 
Table 1 compares the current levels of 
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 3, 2019, as ad-
justed, for fiscal year 2020. These compari-
sons are needed to implement section 311(a) 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, 
which establishes a rule enforceable with a 
point of order against measures that would 
breach the budget resolution’s aggregate lev-
els. 
Table 2 compares the current status of dis-
cretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2020 
with the section 302(b) suballocations of dis-
cretionary budget authority and outlays 
among Appropriations subcommittees. The 
comparison is needed to enforce section 
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
because the point of order under that section 
equally applies to measures that would 
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending authorized 
in excess of the base discretionary spending 
limits under section 251(b) of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985. 
Table 3 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative 
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 3, 2019, for fiscal year 
2020. These comparisons are needed to en-
force the point of order under section 302(f) 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, 
which prohibits the consideration of meas-
ures that would breach the section 302(a) al-
location of new budget authority for the 
committee that reported the measure. It is 
also needed to implement section 311(c), 
which provides an exception for committees 
that comply with their allocations from the 
point of order under section 311(a). 
Table 4 displays the current level of ad-
vance appropriations in fiscal year 2020 ap-
propriations bills. This table is needed to en-
force a rule against appropriations bills con-
taining advance appropriations that: (i) are 
not identified in the statement of the Chair-
man published in the Congressional Record 
on May 3, 2019 or (ii) would cause the aggre-
gate amount of such appropriations to ex-
ceed the level specified in section 2 of H. Res. 
293. 
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact 
oflegislation enacted after May 3, 2019 
against the budget aggregate in force. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

Hon. JOHN YARMUTH,

Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report

mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as 
amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-

allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
May 3, 2019, as adjusted, pursuant to sections

Congress. 
Since our last letter dated January 15, 2020, 
the Congress has cleared and the President 
has signed the following legislation that has 
significant effects on budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues in fiscal year 2020:

Implementation Act (Public Law 116–113); 
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub-
lic Law 116–123);

An act to make technical corrections to 
the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition 
Act (Public Law 116–132);

curity Act (Public Law 116–136);

Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL,

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, H. Res. 293, which established budget enforcement procedures in the House of Representatives for 2020, does not include budget authority, outlays. 
or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. 
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which 
are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT LEVELS OF ON- 
BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FY 2021 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, June 11, 2020. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting 
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for 
fiscal year 2021. This status report is current 
through June 5, 2020. The term ‘‘current 
level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and 
revenues estimated for each fiscal year based 
on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s 
signature. 
Table 1 compares the current levels of 
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 1, 2020 for fiscal 
year 2021 and for the 10-year period of fiscal 
years 2021 through 2030. These comparisons 
are needed to implement section 311(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which es-
tablishes a rule enforceable with a point of 
order against measures that would breach 
the budget resolution’s aggregate levels. The 
table does not show budget authority and 
outlays for fiscal years 2022 through 2030 be-
cause annual appropriations will not be con-
sidered for those years until future sessions 
of Congress. 
Table 2 shows the current status of discre-
tionary appropriations for fiscal year 2021, 
which will be compared with the section 
302(b) suballocations of discretionary budget 
authority and outlays among Appropriations 
subcommittees. The comparison is needed to 
enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 because the point of order

under that section equally applies to meas-
ures that would breach the applicable sec-
tion 302(b) suballocation. 
Table 3 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative 
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 1, 2020, for fiscal year 
2021, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 
2021 through 2030. These comparisons are 
needed to enforce the point of order under 
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, which prohibits the consider-
ation of measures that would breach the sec-
tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-
ity for the committee that reported the 
measure. It is also needed to implement sec-
tion 311(c), which provides an exception for 
committees that comply with their alloca-
tions from the point of order under section 
311(a). 
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes the budget impact of legislation en-
acted since May 1, 2020. 
In you have any questions, please contact 
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, June 11, 2020. 
Hon. JOHN YARMUTH,

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on

mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-

partisan Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–

This is CBO’s first current level report for

Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and lmpoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $646 million in estimated prior outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 1, 2020, by the Chair of the House Committee on 
the Budget pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37), do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. 
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title lll and title IV of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which 
are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

S2901 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2020 
No. 108 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, thank You for Your 
great and precious promises. You have 
promised to keep a record of our pain. 
You have promised that no weapon 
formed against us will prosper. You 
have promised to supply our needs and 
to surround us with the shield of Your 
blessings. You have promised to keep 
us from stumbling or slipping. 
Lord, You have promised that noth-
ing can separate us from Your love. 
You have promised to do for us more 
than we can ask or imagine. Great and 
precious are Your promises. 
Give our lawmakers confidence in 
Your promises as they face these tu-
multuous times. Sustain them with 
Your unfailing love and keep them on 
the right path. 
We pray in Your matchless Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING 
REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. The miracles of sci-
entific innovation have cleared ill-
nesses that a generation ago delivered 
a death sentence to many Americans. 
Dr. Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine in 1953 
eradicated the fatal effects of the virus 
that killed thousands of children in the 
first half of the 20th century. 
I have every confidence that our sci-
entific community will unlock a vac-
cine to stop the coronavirus pandemic. 
Testing, developing, and reviewing vac-
cines take time, but all of that is well 
underway. 
However, there is no time to lose for 
Congress to pass my bipartisan Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. 
We have the responsibility to ensure 
that 
pharmaceutical 
treatments, 
therapies, and vaccines are affordable 
for all Americans facing this pandemic 
or any of the future ones. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Over the last sev-
eral weeks, major challenges have 
dominated the headlines on a daily 
basis. Following the sacrifices Ameri-
cans 
have 
made 
to 
fight 
the 
coronavirus, our Nation is gradually 
beginning to reopen. Our economy has 
started adding back jobs. But as some 
States are seeing their numbers in-
crease, the fallout for American work-
ers remains historic, and schools, uni-
versities, and employers are still look-
ing for smart and safe ways to step 
back toward normal. 
The Senate is working to ensure that 
our efforts to treat, contain, and re-
cover from the pandemic can succeed. 
We have confirmed a Special Inspector 
General for Pandemic Recovery. Com-
mittees are overseeing the CARES Act, 
and Senator CORNYN is crafting meas-
ures to make sure a second epidemic of 
frivolous 
lawsuits 
does 
not 
block 
schools and colleges from reopening or 
employers from rehiring workers. 
At the same time, the killings of 
Black Americans like George Floyd 
and Breonna Taylor have accelerated 
important 
conversations. 
With 
the 
leadership of Senator SCOTT of South 
Carolina, the Senate is preparing to 
add to the conversations surrounding 
law enforcement with our own serious 
proposal—policies 
that 
would 
take 
smart steps without attacking the vast 
majority of police officers who bravely 
do their jobs the right way. 
Of course there is also a long list of 
legislative priorities which the Senate 
was going to tackle before these new 
issues materialized. This week, Chair-
man INHOFE and the Armed Services 
Committee have been marking up the 
60th consecutive National Defense Au-
thorization Act, which I hope the full 
Senate will be voting on later this 
month. 
Here on the floor, we have also been 
considering a landmark bill to protect 
and preserve our Nation’s public lands 
for future generations. 
In my home State of Kentucky, we 
know all about the important role that 
public lands play in preserving our 
physical heritage, providing access for 
outdoor recreation, and sustaining jobs 
and prosperity in the process. Across 
the Commonwealth, outdoor recreation 
supports 120,000 jobs and drives nearly 
$13 billion in consumer spending. From 
natural wonders like Red River Gorge 
and Mammoth Cave National Park to 
historic sites like Mill Springs Battle-
field and Camp Nelson, Kentuckians 
have grown up enjoying our public 
lands, and we intend to protect them 
for future generations. 
Let me give just one example. As I 
mentioned yesterday, when I came to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2902 
June 11, 2020 
the Senate, Kentucky was the only 
State without its own national wildlife 
refuge. We had plenty of history and 
heritage. We just needed a little help to 
preserve it. 
With the support of hunters, boaters, 
and outdoorsmen in the Jackson Pur-
chase region, I led the establishment of 
the Clarks River National Wildlife Ref-
uge. It was a huge step to protect local 
species and our treasured Kentucky 
pastimes. This refuge has continued to 
grow over the years. Thanks to the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
and many willing sellers, it now makes 
thousands of acres available for appre-
ciation, recreation, and tourism. 
Like many public lands, these wild-
life areas make great neighbors. In a 
single year, more than 50 million visi-
tors come to America’s wildlife refuges 
nationwide and spend billions in near-
by communities. 
Decades 
later, 
another 
Kentucky 
community was looking to safeguard 
its own natural treasure. The Green 
River, which flows through Kentucky 
and meets the Ohio River near Hender-
son County, is one of the most bio-
diverse waterways on the entire con-
tinent. I was proud to take the lead 
once again, and alongside strong local 
supporters and a broad coalition of 
groups, we sent a bill to President 
Trump, and he signed it into law. We 
welcomed the Interior Secretary to 
Western Kentucky last year to cut the 
ribbon on the Green River National 
Wildlife Refuge. 
But Kentuckians know that ribbon 
cuttings are just the beginning. Our 
State has newly designated public 
lands that need attention to get off the 
ground. We have well-established pub-
lic lands that have opportunities to 
grow and improve, and we have places 
like the Daniel Boone National Forest, 
established more than 80 years ago, 
that need our careful attention and up-
keep. 
This legislation before the Senate 
will help all of them. It will help us re-
pair levees at the Clarks River Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge. It will also help 
our two wildlife refuges continue to 
grow. It will help Mill Springs Battle-
field and Camp Nelson continue to 
teach the history of emancipation and 
the Civil War to new generations. It 
will help us make infrastructure up-
grades at Mammoth Cave National 
Park for the safety of 2 million annual 
visitors. It will help enhance the Land 
Between the Lakes and its $600 million 
economic impact. It will fund transpor-
tation and structural maintenance in 
the Daniel Boone National Forest, 
which supports more than 900 jobs. It 
will help us rehabilitate the Cum-
berland Gap and give future Americans 
the opportunity to literally follow in 
the footsteps of our early explorers. 
Kentucky is proud of our public 
lands. We are proud of the role our nat-
ural inheritance plays in our vibrant 
present and our promising future. Of 
course, we are only just one State. 
Every one of my Senate colleagues has 
parks, forests, refuges, and historic 
sites they are equally proud of that are 
equally central in their communities. 
That is why we voted to advance this 
legislation earlier this week by an 
overwhelming bipartisan margin. 
President Teddy Roosevelt once said 
this about our Nation’s national treas-
ures: ‘‘We have fallen heirs to the most 
glorious heritage people ever received, 
and each one must do his part if we 
wish to show that the Nation is worthy 
of its good fortune.’’ 
I want to thank Senator DAINES and 
Senator GARDNER for their leadership 
in making sure that we keep up our 
end of the bargain with the generations 
of Americans who came before us and 
those yet to come. I am also grateful 
for 
Senator 
ALEXANDER, 
Senator 
PORTMAN, and our Democratic col-
leagues, Senators MANCHIN and WAR-
NER, for helping to assemble this bipar-
tisan bill. I will be proud to speak for 
Kentucky and to vote for it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior legislative clerk pro-

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
killings of George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, and Ahmaud Arbery catapulted the 
issues of racial justice, police violence, 
and systemic racism to the forefront of 
this Nation’s conscience. These issues 
are not new. Some are even older than 
the Nation itself. The anger felt by 
hundreds of thousands of protestors is 
about that historical and pervasive in-
justice. It is rooted in our decades-long 
failure to reform police departments 
and the yawning gap between our ideal 
of equal justice under law and the re-
ality of equal justice for only some. 
America 
is 
an 
experiment. 
The 
Founding Fathers said that. We know 
it deep in our bones. An experiment 
means you can change, and some of the 
best observers of the difference—I 
think de Tocqueville was one of these— 
of America and the difference between 
us and other countries—we are willing 
to change. 
I am touched and moved—I was with 
the demonstrators on Saturday in New 
York, in Brooklyn—by how many peo-
ple were there—great diversity—and 
how many were young and idealistic 
and doing things for just the right rea-
sons—not selfish reasons but for the 
betterment of the country, to make us 
a more perfect union. 
We must seize this moment. We can-
not let it pass. This isn’t about simply 
renewing a national dialogue, although 
dialogue is always important. It is 
about action. It is about making real 
and meaningful progress. And the way 
to do that is with comprehensive police 
reform legislation in Congress. 
House and Senate Democrats have al-
ready drafted legislation that would 
ban the use of choke holds and other 
tactics that have taken the lives of 
Black Americans like George Floyd 
and Eric Garner; that would also ban 
the use of no-knock warrants in drug 
cases, which is one of the reasons for 
the death of Breonna Taylor; that 
would limit the transfer of military 
equipment to police departments; and, 
crucially, that would make it easier to 
hold 
police 
accountable 
for 
mis-
conduct, as well as institute several re-
forms to prevent that misconduct in 
the first place. 
The moment does not call for cherry- 
picking one or two things to do; it calls 
for bold, broad change—whole-scale re-
form, not piecemeal reform. I know the 
inclination of some of my Senate col-
leagues would be to cherry-pick a few 
small improvements and say the job is 
done. It will not be. We need to start— 
start—with the Justice in Policing Act, 
a strong, comprehensive bill that peo-
ple, particularly Senators BOOKER and 
HARRIS, the CBC, spent a lot of time 
with experts who have studied this 
issue for many, many months and 
years. 
For too long, when major issues wash 
over the country, the waves of change 
and progress crash against the rocks of 
a disinterested Republican Senate ma-
jority. 
When Americans watched in horror 
as another spate of mass shootings 
rocked the Nation, they rose up and de-
manded change. President Trump and 
Senate Republicans initially tried to 
make the right noises. Leader MCCON-
NELL promised that a debate on ex-
panding background checks would be 
‘‘front and center’’ in the Senate after 
shootings in Dayton and El Paso, but, 
predictably, that debate never came to 
pass. 
That seems to be the M.O. of our Re-
publican friends. When there is a na-
tional crisis, major issues, people in 
the streets worried and concerned and 
wanting change, we hear words, and 
then the strategy is delay and, at the 
end, do nothing. We cannot go through 
these same motions again. 
This is about the original sin of 
America that we must try to deal with 
head-on. There are Americans in the 
streets, shouting at the top of their 
lungs for change, young people, ideal-
istic people—the best of America. The 
Senate must pursue comprehensive re-
form, not the lowest common denomi-
nator and certainly not more empty 
rhetorical resolutions. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Of course, there is 
another crisis in the country crying 
out for action and leadership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2903 
June 11, 2020 
The COVID–19 pandemic didn’t go 
away 
while 
the 
Nation 
rightfully 
turned its eyes to issues of racial jus-
tice. 
Yesterday, the United States eclipsed 
2 million cases of coronavirus. Another 
1.5 million Americans filed for unem-
ployment this week. Federal Reserve 
officials—sober, nonpolitical—are pre-
dicting that, best case, we will end the 
year around 10 percent unemploy-
ment—a staggering figure. One out of 
every 10. 
The disease is spiking in a number of 
States around the country. Arizona of-
ficials have warned that its hospitals 
could be filled by next month. Texas 
has gone 3 straight days with record 
numbers 
of 
hospitalizations. 
North 
Carolina, New Mexico, California, Or-
egon, and several other States are ex-
periencing a resurgence or peak levels 
of COVID–19. 
As the President continues to fixate 
on the stock market and Senate Re-
publicans are prematurely ready to de-
clare victory, we need to wrest the 
focus back to these crucial issues. So 
today I am requesting that Dr. Fauci 
and Dr. Birx and other members of the 
administration’s 
Coronavirus 
Task 
Force conduct a briefing for Demo-
cratic Senators on the recent spikes 
and do it next week. We need to under-
stand why these spikes are happening 
and how to adapt our national re-
sponse. 
The President—always interested in 
himself, not in the good of the coun-
try—was too quick to sideline the 
Coronavirus Task Force, too eager to 
pretend that everything was back to 
normal and better than ever. The coun-
try needs Dr. Fauci on billboards, but 
the President wants to put him on a 
milk carton. 
The Vice President yesterday was 
photographed with campaign staffers 
in a tight space, no social distancing, 
without anyone wearing a mask. The 
very least the administration could do 
is lead by example and often cannot 
even manage that much. 
At the same time, we cannot forget 
that the issues of racial justice and 
COVID–19 are intricately related. The 
COVID–19 pandemic disproportionately 
kills Black Americans. Communities of 
color have less access to quality 
healthcare, greater food insecurity, 
greater percentages of poverty, and a 
disproportionate number of our front-
line essential workers—41.2 percent— 
are African American and Latino. The 
majority of African Americans are 
renters and dedicate more than 50 per-
cent of their income to rent. 
The truth is, an emergency bill on 
COVID–19 is a racial justice issue too. 
Hazard pay for essential workers is a 
racial justice issue too. Healthcare is a 
racial justice issue too. Rent assistance 
and forbearance from eviction is a ra-
cial justice issue too. These are all 
items that must be discussed in an-
other COVID relief bill, and it is past 
time to get to work. 
African 
Americans, 
Latinos, 
and 
other minorities are taking the eco-
nomic hit from the coronavirus on the 
chin, but Senate Republicans, led by 
Leader MCCONNELL, are reportedly un-
willing to consider another emergency 
relief bill until late July. How many 
more workers will lose their jobs be-
tween now and late July? How many 
renters will be kicked out of their 
homes between now and late July? How 
many State and local government 
workers will lose their jobs, as State 
and local governments meet their 
budget deadlines on July 1 and don’t 
have the dollars to deal with them? 
How many of them will lose their jobs? 
Waiting until late July is callous, it is 
cold, and it is wrong for our economy. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Republican majority seems to have a 
whole lot of time to push rightwing 
judges. That is what they want to do 
next week. And both of the judges that 
they nominate—to show the hypocrisy 
of those who talk about wanting to 
help and compare it to their actions, 
both of those judges have an antipathy 
to our healthcare law. In the middle of 
a public healthcare crisis, the Repub-
lican majority thinks they can get 
away with stuff like this, but they 
can’t. Americans are catching on. One 
of the nominees, Cory Wilson, has an 
alarming record on voting rights in the 
middle of a national reckoning on ra-
cial injustice, and you are all going to 
vote for him? This guy has opposed 
voting rights, and you are going to 
vote for him. They oppose healthcare. 
You are going to vote for them. And 
then they are going to give nice 
speeches on how they want equality. 
The two have to add up together. 
f 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Republican ma-
jority also seems to have time to chase 
all of President Trump’s wild con-
spiracy theories about how he was 
wronged by law enforcement—the poor, 
beleaguered 
President 
Trump. 
My 
goodness. That is what is happening in 
Judiciary today. Republican Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL can devote time to 
that, but they can’t commit to time on 
the floor about how Black Americans 
are being wronged by law enforcement. 
In order to bring a small appearance 
of fairness to this ridiculous Judiciary 
Committee vote today, Democrats will 
be requesting subpoenas for Trump 
campaign 
associates 
like 
Michael 
Cohen, 
Rick 
Gates, 
George 
Papadopoulos, 
and 
Michael 
Flynn, 
among others. These men have at one 
time or another pled guilty to offenses 
related to Putin’s interference in the 
election. Let’s hear what they have to 
say, or should this be just a one-sided 
kangaroo court to please President 
Trump? 
If the Republican conspiracy caucus 
wants to waste the Senate’s time 
dredging up old conspiracy theories 
about the previous election, let’s at 
least get the straight story. Let’s at 
least hear witnesses who might have 
something different to say. This is not 
a dictatorship. This is not how courts 
or hearings are supposed to work, I 
would say to the Republican chairman, 
and it is beneath his dignity and the 
dignity of the body to conduct such 
sham, kangaroo court hearings. 
I yield the floor.

armed White residents in South Geor-
gia. 
These are just some of the most re-
cent examples of the senseless, re-
peated killings of Black people in our 
communities, including by police, that 
have led to the massive outpouring of 
anger and grief we have seen on display 
in streets across the country. We know 
that these protests are not only about 
unjust tragedies. They are also about 
Tony McDade, Sandra Bland, Mike 
Brown, 
Atatiana 
Jefferson, 
Walter 
Scott, Philando Castile, Aiyana Stan-
ley-Jones, and Tamir Rice, as well as 
Manny Ellis, Charleena Lyles, and Che 
Taylor, from my home State of Wash-
ington. There are countless Black peo-
ple and people of color whose vast ma-
jority of names we don’t know whose 
lives have been unfairly taken. 
Even more important, these protests 
are driven by people, including many 
young people, who are justifiably sick 
and tired of the systemic racism behind 
those killings that is deeply woven 
throughout the fabric of our democracy 
and our history and rightly believe we 
are not moving forward nearly fast 
enough. 
I know this is true in my home State 
of Washington, where according to data 
compiled by the Mapping Police Vio-
lence database, between 2013 and 2019, 
Black people were more than three 
times more likely to be killed by po-
lice. It is beyond clear that the dis-
proportionate impact of police violence 
on Black communities—as well as 
other communities of color—is not 
some accident, and it speaks to a rot 
that is deep in the design of our Na-
tion. I come to the floor today because 
our Nation has to change, because the 
people are demanding it, and I believe 
each of us, especially those of us privi-
leged enough to serve in the U.S. Sen-
ate, is responsible for being a part of 
the solution. 
It has been more than 2 weeks since 
George Floyd’s murder, and we are still 
seeing protests across the country in 
towns big and small, in urban and rural 
areas. More importantly, they don’t 
seem to be stopping. More and more 
people are getting engaged and learn-
ing and listening and signaling. We 
have a real opportunity to make 
change in our country. I believe strong-
ly this is a problem we can start to 
solve today, and we have policies to do 
it. 
One major step we can take is by 
passing the legislation offered this 
week by Senators HARRIS and BOOKER. 
I thank them for their moral leader-
ship on so many challenges but espe-
cially this week with the introduction 
of the Justice in Policing Act. Their 
legislation would, among other things, 
reform qualified immunity that is an 
antiquated judicial doctrine that has 
kept so many officers from being held 
accountable for violating Americans’ 
constitutional rights. It would ban the 
use of choke holds and carotid holds 
and make Federal funds available only 
for State and local departments com-
mitted to codifying an end to these 
shameful tactics in law. It would re-
form the use-of-force standards to 
make officers clear a higher bar before 
using deadly force and require deadly 
force to be used only as a last resort. 
It would ban the use of no-knock 
warrants in Federal drug cases and pro-
vide strong incentives to State and 
local governments to do the same. It 
would strengthen transparency of po-
licing through data, like creating a na-
tional police misconduct registry to 
prevent misconduct from being swept 
under the rug and requiring the Fed-
eral Government to finally begin na-
tional tracking of incidences of use of 
force. 
It would limit the transfer of mili-
tary-grade equipment to State and 
local law enforcement, as well as steps 
to restore and build on many of the po-
licing reform efforts initiated during 
the Obama administration. None of 
these policies should be controversial 
for any of us here in the Senate, Demo-
crat or Republican. We have all seen 
the same egregious violence and the 
same abuses of power from police in 
the communities we represent—com-
munities whose safety should be our 
priority. It is undeniable that change is 
not only necessary but long overdue, 
and there is absolutely no reason this 
body shouldn’t be able to take up these 
straightforward vital steps and pass 
them immediately. 
Now, I don’t think Senators HARRIS 
or BOOKER or any of us cosponsoring 
the bill think this is a panacea or a so-
lution to all of the longstanding prob-
lems the last few weeks have laid bare, 
but this is action that we can start 
taking now to begin ensuring justice 
and accountability in our laws and in 
our law enforcement and, hopefully, 
help put us on a path to begin to heal 
our Nation’s deep wounds. 
While we need to pass legislation to 
address police brutality, we can’t stop 
there. The Justice in Policing Act is 
the first of many steps we need to take 
in Congress to help reset our Nation’s 
moral compass. It isn’t lost on me—the 
massive uprising of peaceful protests 
against police brutality we have seen 
in recent days—that it is happening 
while many of our States are still 
working overtime to address the im-
pacts of the COVID–19 pandemic and to 
keep people safe as we reopen commu-
nities. 
Over the last couple of weeks, I have 
been in contact with Black leaders and 
activists on the ground back home, and 
I have heard over and over again about 
the connection between the racism at 
the heart of the policing of Black com-
munities and the disproportionate im-
pact of COVID–19 on them and their 
families, and, more importantly, how 
traumatizing multilayered challenges 
like these can be for Black people in 
our lives who deal with these injustices 
day in and day out. 
For instance, one Black civil rights 
leader in southwest Washington told 
me how their community has had a 
hard time getting vulnerable members 
of the Black community tested. She is 
fighting for more resources and sup-
port, and she is organizing car rallies 
to enable people to make their voices 
heard against police brutality while 
still maintaining social distancing. An-
other Black leader in Seattle shared 
with me how absolutely critical it is 
that Black and other underserved com-
munities have access to COVID–19 test-
ing and healthcare during this ongoing 
pandemic, that these were both impor-
tant, and that it isn’t an either/or prop-
osition. 
That people are rushing to the 
streets to make their voices heard in 
the middle of a global health emer-
gency underscores how serious this mo-
ment in our country is and highlights 
the depths of the injustices baked into 
our systems at every level. This means 
that during this unprecedented public 
health emergency, we must prioritize 
equity in our response, including en-
suring that we are collecting the nec-
essary demographic data to target our 
efforts toward those most in need and 
using this data to aggressively address 
disparities; making sure critical sup-
plies like testing kits and PPEs are 
getting to our hardest hit commu-
nities, which is not happening consist-
ently and is contributing to Black and 
Brown 
communities 
suffering 
dis-
proportionately from the health and 
economic impacts of this virus; not to 
mention planning now for equitable 
distribution of a safe and effective vac-
cine. 
More broadly, the protests are a pas-
sionate call for meaningful change in 
our systems and institutions to combat 
the status quo of racism and anti- 
Blackness that stains our democracy. 
In order to make the right policy and 
resource decisions to help us change 
America for the better and move to-
ward a more just and peaceful future, 
it is critical that we all try to stand in 
the shoes of those demanding change 
and hear what they are saying from the 
perspective of their life experience, not 
solely of our own, because like I have 
heard recently in my conversations 
with Black Washingtonians, it is not 
that these are new ideas or proposals, 
but that as a Nation we haven’t paid 
nearly enough attention to the pro-
found grievances Black people have 
been raising for a long time. 
What I hear is people crying out for 
this country to live up to its values, 
saying it is time for all of us, espe-
cially elected officials, to listen and 
act by reinvesting in supporting our 
communities, rather than allowing law 
enforcement to be an unaccountable, 
militarized nonanswer to perfectly un-
derstandable 
calls 
for 
better 
healthcare, better schools, and real 
safety. 
It means not only addressing the rac-
ism and police violence in our national 
COVID–19 response but also in how we 
address maternal mortality, which dis-
proportionately impacts Black women 
and families; and access to healthcare

more broadly for Black communities; 
and how we work to solve the climate 
crisis, which is a long-time demand of 
Black and Brown communities that 
have suffered some of the worst im-
pacts of growing pollution; in how we 
work to close the gender pay gap that 
has Black and Latina women hardest; 
and in how we ensure equity of re-
sources and opportunity and quality in 
our schools and our colleges and our 
universities; and much, much more. 
Now, none of this will happen over-
night, but it is important that we start 
the work now to dismantle systemic 
racism if we ever want to make justice 
and equality realities instead of dis-
tant ideas. 
There is also another big piece. I 
would be remiss if I didn’t mention it. 
I want to talk about something that I 
and so many people across this coun-
try—especially White people, who don’t 
live every day feeling the impacts per-
sonally—are grappling with right now, 
which is the part of this work that 
isn’t about our systems or our institu-
tions. It is about looking inward. 
Far too often the fear of finding out 
that you have been wrong or com-
pletely misunderstood closes us off 
from honest self-reflection and growth. 
We can’t let it. Let’s be clear: Change 
in our own hearts and our own minds 
and in our communities is as funda-
mental and essential to truly over-
coming racism in our country as re-
forming policies and systems. 
Instead of letting fear of getting it 
wrong lead to inaction or complacency, 
I urge you to let it motivate you to lis-
ten and to learn because we all have 
more to do. I am personally committed 
to doing more. We all need to play a 
role in this work, especially our Na-
tion’s leaders, which is why it is so 
frustrating that next week, instead of 
addressing 
the 
profoundly 
urgent 
issues we are hearing about from lit-
erally all corners of this country, the 
Senate will be working toward con-
firming a personal friend of the major-
ity leader’s to a lifetime judicial nomi-
nation—and very little else. I refuse to 
accept this, and we all should. 
I also haven’t mentioned the Presi-
dent of the United States yet. Before I 
do, I want to make one thing really 
clear: He is not the cause of all this in-
justice; he is the symptom. And we, all 
of us, are the only cure. Instead of ris-
ing to try to unify the country, the 
President has shown more interest in 
fanning the flames of divisiveness and 
making 
dangerous, 
unconstitutional 
threats to intimidate into silence and 
suppress these vital protests. 
To see this President at the helm of 
our country in this moment is tragic 
and frightening. But try as he might, 
the President cannot simply dismiss 
the legitimate anger on display in Se-
attle or Tacoma or Spokane or across 
the country at the pervasive and crush-
ing impact of racism on Black people 
and other people of color. 
For generations, we have seen in our 
newspapers and on our televisions and 
from our cell phones the dire and un-
fair and too often fatal impacts of sys-
temic racism on Black lives. Our focus 
must be on the painstaking work to ac-
tually address the deep, systemic rac-
ism in our country, which continues to 
create these moments of understand-
able despair. 
I am going to keep listening to the 
people who are at the forefront of these 
movements, including leaning on the 
work that has already been done to 
help reimagine our Nation’s approach 
to public safety, working to redirect 
taxpayer dollars towards community 
resources that invest in the health, 
safety, and security of Black people 
and others who have been historically 
overlooked, and acting, not just talk-
ing, to keep our momentum and efforts 
on this front progressing forward. 
I am so glad I have been able to con-
nect with leaders in Washington State 
on these issues. As an elected leader, I 
know I have to keep stepping up and 
amp up these necessary voices. Even 
though our country is at a crossroads— 
perhaps the most perilous one we have 
faced in recent memory—we have an 
opportunity for real progress right 
now. I feel it in the demands for change 
coming from the streets and on social 
media. I feel it in the energy, the resil-
ience, and the courage of civil rights 
leaders on the ground in Washington 
State. And I feel it in the Justice in 
Policing Act. 
In closing, I hope every single Sen-
ator in this Chamber will join Senators 
HARRIS, BOOKER, and myself in cospon-
soring this critical legislation and get-
ting it signed and on the books as 
quickly as possible. I challenge each of 
my colleagues and all of us to commit 
ourselves to a fairer, more compas-
sionate vision for our future. 
Some will say that nothing will 
change or can change, that we are 
stuck to live out this historical loop of 
racial intolerance in perpetuity. But, 
as Seattle-based writer Ijeoma Oluo re-
minds us, ‘‘you don’t have to pretend 
to be free of racism to be an anti-racist 
. . . [a]nti-racism is the commitment 
to fight racism wherever you find it, 
including in yourself. And it’s the only 
way forward.’’ 
As a country, let’s commit to fight 
racism in our laws and systems. As in-
dividuals, let’s commit to fight racism 
in ourselves and in our communities. 
This is the work before all of us. 
As a voice for my State and as some-
one committed to forming a more per-
fect union for everyone, I intend to 
work for justice every day until it ar-
rives. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
yesterday, our Senate Education Com-
mittee held a hearing on going back to 
school safely—a subject on the minds 
of tens of millions of American fami-
lies—since today two-thirds of married 
parents both work outside the home, 
and they have children. The children 
are ready to go back to school, and the 
parents are even more ready for them 
to go back to school. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD fol-
lowing my remarks this morning my 
opening statement from that hearing. 
The commissioner of education from 
Tennessee—and I know that the Pre-
siding Officer, while he is a proud Sen-
ator from Florida, also knows a little 
bit 
about 
Tennessee, 
having 
lived 
there—was one of our witnesses there. 
She said: We want children to do 
things. We want them to be safe, but 
we want them to thrive. 
That is the sense I got from all of the 
witnesses yesterday, which includes 
the Denver school superintendent; a 
national representative of education, 
Dr. Benjamin; and it included the com-
missioner of education for the State of 
Nebraska, who is also the head of the 
Chief State School Officers. 
Anyone who looks at the children in 
America today knows they need to go 
back to school. They have been out for 
5 to 6 months now. This is a time when 
we are especially concerned in our 
country, and our attention is focused 
on racial injustice, on problems that 
minority families and minority chil-
dren have. The single best thing we 
could do to help minority children and 
minority families is to help them go 
back to school safely in August and 
September. 
Any teacher can tell you and most 
parents can tell you that emotional, 
intellectual, and physical damage to 
children has been caused by being out 
of school since March, and that will 
continue to be the case until they re-
open in August. Articles have talked 
about 50 percent learning deficits. We 
have that every summer when children 
are away from school. Teachers in the 
fall know they have to catch back up. 
It has also shown us the limits, as 
well as the benefits, of remote learn-
ing. My daughter has three young sons, 
two of them in school. She said they 
have had it about up to here with re-
mote learning, even though they are in 
a very good public school system. 
There are limits as to what you can 
learn remotely. Teachers aren’t trained 
to teach remotely. In many parts of 
our country, broadband isn’t sufficient 
to allow students to learn remotely. 
Teachers haven’t made lesson plans to 
teach remotely, so they have to change 
the whole way they go about teaching. 
So much of the children being home 
affects homeschooling. Homeschooling 
is a good thing for parents who are able 
to do that, but homeschooling is hard. 
It takes a lot of time. If you are in a 
family, as two-thirds of married fami-
lies are, where you are both working

June 11, 2020 
outside the home, how are you going to 
do the homeschooling appropriately so 
that your child doesn’t get far behind? 
For the benefit of the children, for 
the benefit of the parents, and espe-
cially for the benefit of low-income 
children—many of whom get one or 
two meals a day at school—we need to 
go back to school as a country. When 
we do—when 100,000 public schools and 
36,000 private schools, 55 million chil-
dren go back to school and 20 million 
students go back to the college—that 
will be the surest step toward regain-
ing the rhythm of American life that 
we can have. That would show we are 
actually going back toward normal. 
It will be another year before we get 
to normal. I think we all understand 
that. We are going at warp speed to 
find a new vaccine. We are building 
manufacturing plants for vaccines be-
fore we even know that they work. We 
have never done that before. In fact, 
there has probably never been a time in 
our history where we had more sci-
entific brainpower in this world de-
voted toward a specific target than we 
do right now at trying to increase the 
number of fast, rapid, accurate diag-
nostic tests, the number of treatments 
to reduce the effects of COVID–19, and 
a vaccine for COVID–19. We probably 
have never had so many scientists in 
the world working on a single project 
like that. We will probably have good 
results, but it will take a while. 
All of the plans that are being 
made—and we heard about them yes-
terday—will take a whole year. In the 
next semester, we will have more tests, 
we will have more treatments, we will 
have more contact tracers, and there 
should be, hopefully, the beginning of 
vaccines, but our plan should be for a 
year. 
How do you make sure the schools 
are safe? The formula is pretty simple, 
although it is not as simple in its ap-
plication. The things that we know 
work are, No. 1, staying apart some 
distance; No. 2, washing your hands; 
and No. 3, wearing a mask. 
In colleges, that will be easy because 
colleges have more space. In fact, they 
are big wasters of space. They usually 
don’t teach in the morning or in the 
evening or on Saturday or in the sum-
mer, and colleges can spread out and 
create smaller classes. There are more 
lectures. You can do lectures more eas-
ily. 
You can have a culture of mask- 
wearing—as President Mitch Daniels of 
Purdue University testified the week 
before—at colleges. I think colleges 
will have an easier time than schools. 
In addition to that, we know that, 
unfortunately, COVID–19 affects older 
people. In Tennessee, for example, 5 
percent of the cases of COVID–19 are in 
nursing homes, and nearly 40 percent of 
the deaths are in nursing homes. The 
same is true in other States. COVID–19 
affects younger people a lot less. Dr. 
Fauci has warned us not to be cavalier 
about that, but the truth is, younger 
people seem not to be as affected by 
COVID–19. 
We have a population that is not as 
affected. We have a population that is 
in a smaller, controlled setting. You 
can shut a school if someone gets in-
fected and keep other schools open. We 
do that with the flu. We have children, 
who are more subject to being told 
what to do. So we have a setting where 
we should be able to create commu-
nities—there are 100,000 public schools, 
as I said—little communities that are 
among the safest in our country. On 
the other hand, little children may 
have a difficult time wearing masks. 
They aren’t the best at hygiene. Chil-
dren go home every day; they may 
come back and forth bringing germs 
with them. 
We have those basics that I talked 
about—plus, testing. What we know 
about testing is that we have the ca-
pacity to do about 10 million tests a 
month this month, according to Admi-
ral Giroir, the Assistant Secretary of 
Health. He says we will have a 40 to 50 
million test capacity by the time we go 
back to school in August, September. 
That is four to five times as many as 
we have today. 
What is going on now is that in Flor-
ida and in Tennessee—every State is 
making its plan for the tests that it 
needs and sending it to the admiral. 
They are working on it together. If the 
State has needs the State can’t deal 
with, the Federal Government helps 
with that. In our second month of that 
kind of relationship, that seems to be 
working pretty well. 
I know that in Tennessee, which is 
11th among all the States in terms of 
testing per capita, the Governor’s 
motto is, if in doubt, get a test. You 
can go to the local public health de-
partment and get one in 5 minutes. It 
takes 2, 3 days to get the result, but 
there are no delays. Anybody who 
wants it can get it. That has created an 
environment where everybody feels 
more comfortable. If they are worried 
about COVID–19, if they don’t want to 
go home and see their older relatives or 
their spouse, if they wonder if they are 
sick, they can go get a test. 
So tests should be available for the 
schools. 
We will have to be careful and recog-
nize that the way schools open will 
vary by community. There are many 
counties in Nebraska, the commis-
sioner of Nebraska said yesterday, 
where there is not a single case of 
COVID–19. So on his dial of green to 
red in terms of school opening, they 
would be very green and wouldn’t have 
to do much in response to the COVID– 
19 in terms of changing the way they 
operate. On the other hand, in Omaha, 
NE, it might be different. In Nashville, 
it might be different. In New York City 
or Phoenix, it might be different. 
The Denver school superintendent 
talked about perhaps having children 
come for 2 or 3 days a week on alter-
nate days in order to have smaller 
classes and about having extra time for 
disabled children or children from 
homes where they have less support, 
more vulnerable children needing more 
help in our schools. 
My hope would be that we can find 
ways for children to come back to as 
normal a school day as possible. It will 
take some flexibility. Some of those 
that will need to be flexible are the 
States, the Federal Government, and 
the unions with their rules and regula-
tions. Colleges have a lot of flexibility 
in rearranging class schedules, class 
sizes, and class times. Schools have a 
lot less because they have State rules 
and union rules that restrict what they 
can do. They need some flexibility so 
they can reschedule. 
Then there is the question of money. 
Just as we say we want children to be 
safe, we want them to learn, there are 
two arguments on behalf of more 
money from the Federal Government. 
One would be Federal spending to help 
them learn. Generally, that is the re-
sponsibility of State and local govern-
ments. They spend about 90 percent of 
that. 
In our first COVID–19 bill, the Fed-
eral Government was generous with 
schools, recognizing that we shut down 
the economy, and then that shut down 
the schools, and that caused a lot of ex-
pensive problems. The Federal Govern-
ment supplied $23 billion, and Ten-
nessee got about $260 million for just 
K–12 schools. There was another slug of 
money for colleges, and then there was 
$150 billion for States. As the Presiding 
Officer knows, a big part of the State 
budget—30 to 40 percent—goes to edu-
cation. So my thinking is that a part 
of that $150 billion—$23 billion we have 
already allocated for K–12 and the $25 
billion that we allocated to testing, 
which could include contact tracers, 
some of which could be a part of 
schools—should help pay for keeping 
schools safe enough to reopen. 
If there is more money, we need to be 
open to that, I think, here in the Fed-
eral Government, but not before we see 
whether it is really needed. 
The Tennessee commissioner—and I 
put a lot of stock in her thinking. Be-
cause Tennessee is a conservative 
State, it doesn’t spend a lot of money, 
has no debt, a big rainy day fund, low 
taxes—a lot like Florida. She esti-
mates that it will cost about $1.5 mil-
lion per school district, with the aver-
age school district being about $3,500, 
in her words, to provide the things the 
school districts need to reopen safely. 
Those are things like more sanitizing 
equipment, barriers that separate chil-
dren in the lunchroom or maybe even 
in class, extra money for busing be-
cause when you create a lot of new 
classes, a lot of new schedules, you 
may have to change the bus schedules, 
and that will cost more than most 
things. So it is about $1.5 million. 
I will be very interested to see how 
much of the money we have already ap-
propriated or how much of the money 
that we have appropriated that is very 
inflexible and might be made more 
flexible for Governors to use just for 
opening schools safely and whether we 
need to add any more.

June 11, 2020 
I think it is in our interest to make 
sure that principals and school boards 
know that they will have sufficient 
funds to open 100,000 public schools 
safely, because school administrators, 
with all respect, sometimes are a little 
bit conservative and reluctant to take 
risks. If there is the excuse that ‘‘We 
don’t have enough money to open safe-
ly,’’ they may just say ‘‘Let’s keep up 
with remote learning.’’ I think we are 
about up to here with remote learning 
in most places in the country. It is es-
pecially not good for the youngest chil-
dren and for children who are from dis-
advantaged 
families 
or 
low-income 
families. I think it is important to get 
the country going. It is good for the 
children and it is good for the parents 
to make sure that schools have suffi-
cient funds to reopen safely. 
It was a very good hearing yesterday. 
I thank the witnesses for their partici-
pation. It was all remote, even for all 
of the Senators. 
We will have another hearing next 
week on telehealth. We have had to 
cram 10 years of experience into 3 
months to learn about telehealth, 
telework, and telelearning. While this 
has been a very painful way to learn a 
lesson, we should take advantage of 
these lessons because, as we will find 
out in our hearing next week on tele-
health, we have gone from almost none 
of it to seeing that 40 or 50 percent of 
the physician-patient visits are done 
remotely. If that were to turn out to 
be, over the long term, 15 or 20 percent, 
that would produce a massive oppor-
tunity for change in the way we deliver 
medical services in the country. 
The one other thing I would mention 
is that I heard about liability yester-
day. Colleges and the schools I have 
talked to want to be included in what-
ever the Federal Government does to 
make sure that teachers and adminis-
trators and schools and universities are 
appropriately protected from lawsuits 
as a result of the COVID–19 epidemic. 
As long as they meet a standard of 
care that is reasonable, they should 
not have to worry about being liable if 
a child who is 8 years old forgets to 
wear a mask, coughs on another child, 
and that child goes home and makes 
Grandma sick and Grandma sues the 
school. 
Teachers are always worried about li-
ability. The teachers’ unions often use 
liability insurance as one of the major 
incentives to join the unions. Many 
States, like my State, provide tort li-
ability for teachers. 
I think we need to make sure that 
here in the Senate, as we consider any 
additional legislation that has to do 
with COVID–19, we include colleges and 
we include schools. We received a let-
ter from all of the colleges from the 
American Council on Education spe-
cifically asking us to do that. Other-
wise, we might discourage schools and 
colleges from opening. If we discourage 
schools from opening, that leaves chil-
dren sometimes home alone, some-
times home without being educated, 
some of them being left with remote 
learning that doesn’t help and devel-
oping a learning gap that will leave 
them at a disadvantage for the rest of 
their lives. 
As we look at all of the issues we 
have to deal with, I hope we include ap-
propriate steps to put limits on liabil-
ity, at least as a result of the COVID– 
19 experience. 
There being no objection, the mate-

COVID–19: GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY 
A May 28 story in the Memphis Commer-
cial Appeal about schools planning for the 
2020–2021 school year included a bittersweet 
image—a young girl reaching her hand out 
to touch a teacher, who is standing in line to 
welcome students to the first day of school 
in 2019. As the Commercial Appeal reporter 
writes: ‘‘The first day of school in August 
2019 would flunk 2020’s course on social 
distancing.’’ 
Today’s hearing is about how we reopen 
schools safely this fall—that means teachers 
welcoming students back without hugs or 
high fives. 
The opening of schools in 2020 is not going 
to look like 2019. 
But today’s witnesses will talk about their 
work to help 56 million students from kin-
dergarten to 12th grade go back to the 100,000 
public schools and 34,000 private schools in 
the fall as safely as possible. 
In doing so, they will help our country 
take its surest step toward normalcy. 
Witnesses: 
Dr. Penny Schwinn, Commissioner of Edu-
cation, Tennessee Department of Education, 
Nashville, TN 
Dr. Matthew Blomstedt, Commissioner of 
Education, Nebraska Department of Edu-
cation, Lincoln, NE 
Ms. Susana Cordova, Superintendent, Den-
ver Public Schools, Denver, CO 
John B. King, Jr., President and CEO, The 
Education Trust, Washington, DC 
The question for governors, school dis-
tricts, teachers and parents is not whether 
schools should reopen—but how. 
Any teacher can explain the risk of emo-
tional, intellectual and social damage if a 
child misses a school year. 
Schools need to assess how this year’s dis-
ruption has affected our children and get 
student learning back on track. 
At our hearing last week on the reopening 
of colleges, we heard about a variety of 
strategies that colleges are using to help 
keep classrooms and campuses safe, includ-
ing keeping class sizes small so students can 
stay 6 feet apart, creating campus-wide poli-
cies for wearing masks, and rigorous hygiene 
improvements. 
As with colleges, k–12 schools’ plans will 
vary for each community and will also de-
pend on the prevalence of the virus in the 
fall. 
The goals for schools working to reopen 
are fundamentally the same as the colleges 
we heard from last week: social distancing, 
aggressive hygiene practices, face masks 
where appropriate, and then a system of 
testing and contact tracing. 
In order to accomplish those goals, it’s 
clear that school boards, superintendents 
and principals need to be focused on: 
Creating an environment where students 
and teachers can socially distance 
Making modifications to the school year 
calendar and daily schedule 
Preparing 
to 
integrate 
more 
distance 
learning 
Restructuring 
classrooms 
and 
extra-
curricular activities 
Providing meal services in a safe way 
Making sure the school has gloves, masks, 
and other protective equipment 
Protecting students and adults in the 
school buildings who are at a higher risk. 
To accomplish this, schools will also need 
to create a strategy for testing and tracing 
students who may have been exposed. You 
want your school’s testing needs to be in 
your state plan. 
The availability of widespread testing will 
allow schools to identify teachers and stu-
dents who have the virus or have been ex-
posed to it and trace their contacts. 
Widespread testing not only helps contain 
the disease; it builds confidence that the 
school is safe. Fortunately, U.S. Assistant 
Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir 
says there will be 40–50 million tests avail-
able per month by September. That is 4–5 
times today’s number—and today’s number 
is twice as many as any other country. 
Dr. Francis Collins, who led the Human 
Genome Project, now leads a competitive 
‘‘shark tank’’ enterprise at the National In-
stitutes of Health to discover new ways to 
conduct tens of millions of additional accu-
rate tests with quick results. 
Schools’ COVID–19 plans should last for at 
least a year: The government is pursuing 
vaccines at warp speed, but no one expects 
one by August. 
In the second half of the school year, 
schools should be able to provide more tests, 
more treatments, better contact tracing and 
we should have vaccines. It will likely be the 
Fall of 2021 before school life approaches nor-
mal. 
There are several reasons schools have an 
advantage in providing a safe environment 
for students and faculty: 
The first reason is that younger people 
have been less hurt by COVID–19, although 
Dr. Anthony Fauci has warned against 
‘‘cavalierly’’ assuming that young people are 
not at risk. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention says it is ‘‘investigating re-
ports of multisystem inflammatory syn-
drome in children (MIS–C) associated with 
coronavirus disease.’’ 
Second, schools are generally small com-
munities that are closely supervised and 
monitored. Third, outbreaks can be traced— 
if a child becomes sick, that child’s class-
mates can be tested. Fourth, individual 
schools can close to control the spread of the 
virus—while other schools remain open. 
Schools are not unfamiliar with outbreaks of 
flu and other illnesses that have resulted in 
the temporary closure of individual schools 
to prevent further spread. 
But school environments pose challenges 
as well: 
First, there’s not much extra space in a k– 
12 school to enable distancing—whereas 
there’s a lot of extra space on most college 
campuses. 
Second, school administrators face more 
rigid rules as a result of state and local regu-
lations and contracts with teachers’ unions, 
so making changes to the academic calendar, 
class times and class sizes are more difficult. 
Third, creating a mask-wearing culture is 
harder with young children. Seeing facial ex-
pressions is also important for young chil-
dren—they learn to socialize and self-regu-
late, so obscuring faces with masks prohibits 
some learning for early elementary school- 
aged children. 
Fourth, rigorous hygiene isn’t always easy 
with children. 
Fifth, children go home at night, poten-
tially exposing older adults. 
Sixth, even systematic testing of children 
is a lot of tests. 
Today 91.3 percent of families with chil-
dren have at least one parent employed, and

among married families with children, 64.2 
percent had both parents employed, accord-
ing to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
And many children live in environments 
where the school is the safest place they’ll be 
all day. 
It’s also the place where almost 30 million 
students receive a school lunch—more than 
70 percent of those students qualify for free 
or reduced-priced meals. 
Administrators have a responsibility to 
make our schools among the safest small 
communities this fall. 
In doing so, they will help our country 
take its surest steps toward normalcy.

ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, on a 
recent Saturday afternoon, the world 
watched as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 lifted off 
from American soil, streaked through 
the sky, and sent the Crew Dragon cap-
sule beyond the Earth’s atmosphere. 
By Sunday, its crew was successfully 
docked at the International Space Sta-
tion. The following morning, Indianap-
olis-based Eli Lilly & Company an-
nounced the start of human testing of 
a potential treatment for COVID–19. 
Falcon 9, the first rocket to send men 
to space from America in a decade was 
traveling at 10 times the speed of 
sound, and Lilly’s COVID–19 therapy is 
moving nearly as fast. It often takes a 
dozen years to develop a drug. This one 
could be available in just months. 
Neither 
happened 
spontaneously, 
though. They are the result of years of 
savvy, technological, and scientific in-
vestments, of partnerships between pri-
vate industry and government. Such 
investments, such partnerships open 
new horizons in space exploration and 
disease fighting, and they show us the 
endless frontier into which American 
imagination and ingenuity can carry 
us. 
We Americans have always been 
drawn to the frontier—yes, the natural 
frontier of wildernesses and unfamiliar 
territories from which States such as 
mine spring, but also the frontier that 
bounds what we as humans were once 
imagined to be capable of accom-
plishing after our forbearers settled 
across this great continent. 
Americans see the heavens and don’t 
simply wonder what they hold. We see 
loved ones grow sick, and we don’t just 
resign ourselves to the prognosis. We 
create cures. Americans would always 
rather build a rocket ship than a rest 
home. We are driven by a deep need to 
lift one another, to discover break-
throughs that will lead to the better-
ment of all of mankind. 
And among the most powerful allies 
we have in accomplishing this are 
science and research and the innova-
tions that they fuel. 
In the 20th century, Vannevar Bush 
beautifully captured the essence of the 
American culture of discovery and in-
novation. He first coined the memo-
rable term ‘‘endless frontier.’’ Bush, 
you see, was a visionary, an unsung 
hero of World War II. He was the man 
who saw the importance of science and 
discovery in defeating the Axis Powers. 
As President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 
unofficial science adviser, he initiated 
the Manhattan Project and ensured 
that it received top priority from the 
highest levels of government. 
Later, in his 1945 report to the Presi-
dent, entitled ‘‘Science: The Endless 
Frontier,’’ Bush called for an expansion 
of public support for science and paved 
the way for the creation of the Na-
tional Science Foundation. He believed 
that America’s security and prosperity 
depended upon premarket investment 
in science and technology. Basic re-
search, in his words, was the ‘‘pace-
maker 
of 
technological 
progress.’’ 
‘‘New products and new processes do 
not appear full-grown,’’ he said. ‘‘They 
are founded on new principles and new 
conceptions, which in turn are pains-
takingly developed by research in the 
purest realms of science.’’ 
Bush was right. The years that fol-
lowed proved it. The National Science 
Foundation was created, a space age 
was ushered in, a space race was won, 
and an evil empire was defeated—all in 
an era of historic prosperity that was 
only possible because of America’s eco-
nomic and technological supremacy, 
itself built on government-funded pre-
market research. 
Bush originally articulated the im-
portance of science to the Nation’s for-
tunes in a time of peril. While the chal-
lenges we face today are of a different 
nature, we are again in such a time. A 
mysterious virus with no known cure 
has spread across the globe, killed 
thousands of Americans, and crippled 
our economy. A new power competition 
is now underway, and America’s pre-
dominant challenger is an unscrupu-
lous authoritarian regime whose values 
are the inverse of our own. 
For 
proof, 
witness 
Beijing’s 
leveraging of COVID–19 to further its 
goal of global dominance and author-
ship of this new century. To meet these 
new challenges, we must once again— 
once again—show the entire world the 
resiliency and dynamism of the Amer-
ican people, the American economy, 
the American spirit, and the American 
project itself. 
And to do this, we must not simply 
advance again toward the endless fron-
tier but accelerate into it. 
The Endless Frontier Act, authored 
by Senator SCHUMER and me, will pro-
vide the rocket fuel for America’s 
innovators and visionaries. Let us re-
solve here today to pass it so that this 
generation of American doers and 
dreamers and their children can propel 
us forward and win the 21st century. 
Here is how and why we should act. 
The Endless Frontier Act would bol-
ster U.S. leadership in science and tech 
innovation and boldly increase pre-
market investment in emerging tech. 
It will provide $100 billion in stra-
tegic 
investment 
in 
the 
National 
Science Foundation to bolster science 
and technology research and develop-
ment. 
It will deliver $10 billion to establish 
regional tech hubs across the country 
to launch innovative companies, revive 
American manufacturing, and create 
new jobs to jump start our local com-
munities. And in the coming years, it 
will strengthen American power, in-
crease American prosperity, and carry 
on America’s never-ending quest to 
continuously 
improve 
the 
world 
through innovation. 
Let us pass this act. If we do, another 
endless frontier will be before us, and 
with it, a stronger, freer, more pros-
perous nation, and a world in which 
free men and women author this new 
century. 
Dating back to the Cold War, after 
China had developed military might, 
its leaders focused on science and tech-
nology as a means to reorder the global 
balance of power. 
Since then, Beijing has aimed to 
overtake America, not with weapons, 
but with innovation. Offensively, China 
is investing in 5G, quantum computing, 
artificial intelligence, advanced energy 
systems—all of which have the poten-
tial to fundamentally change this cen-
tury’s economic and security environ-
ment for good or for ill. 
Defensively, China is shoring up do-
mestic industries while exploiting our 
economic 
downturn 
and 
cynically 
using the pandemic to play the part of 
concerned global citizen to further its 
position in the world. And that is not a 
conspiracy theory. It is public knowl-
edge. 
A new report from the Chinese Acad-
emy of Sciences bluntly observes: ‘‘It is 
possible to turn the crisis [of COVID– 
19] into an opportunity—to increase 
the trust and the dependence of all 
countries around the world in ‘Made in 
China.’ ’’ 
Tellingly, for China, the search to 
find treatments for COVID–19 is not 
simply a race to stop the virus but a 
race for bragging rights and global su-
periority. 
The CCP is dedicating millions of 
dollars to research into drug develop-
ment. Five out of the 10 top vaccine 
candidates are coming from China. 
As they have in other fields of re-
search, China has recently ramped up 
spending on pharmaceutical research, 
no doubt with an eye on surpassing 
America in yet another field. The first 
COVID–19 vaccine could be the key.

If all of these trends continue, Chi-
na’s overall investments in research 
and development will surpass our own 
within 10 years—just as their economy 
becomes larger than our own. 
Until now, we have primarily focused 
on 
defensive 
countermeasures 
to 
thwart the aggression of the CCP: 
blocking Huawei, tightening export 
controls, and improving foreign invest-
ment rules. These are important and 
must remain in place. 
But if America is to lead the world in 
the 21st century, it is neither realistic 
nor practical to build an economic iron 
curtain around China. 
We are not in a 20th century cold 
war, but we can learn and apply lessons 
from that Cold War. Just as we did in 
the 20th century, we must not simply 
contain 
a 
competitor 
but 
instead 
outinnovate and outgrow them. 
Something else is in the balance here 
too. China longs to become the world’s 
leader but lacks the attachment to 
human rights and dignity required of 
those that seek to fill that role. What 
becomes of liberty in a world led by 
such a power? 
However imperfectly, every Amer-
ican generation, from the founding for-
ward, has labored to preserve and pass 
down the blessings of freedom here and 
wherever its friends may be found, and 
this current generation must carry this 
on and provide the world with a 
choice—a choice between a great power 
that defends freedom or one that tram-
ples upon it. 
But we will be powerless to offer this 
alternative if we don’t keep pace with 
China, and we will not have a shot at 
this unless we invest in ourselves. Im-
plementing the Endless Frontier Act 
will provide that investment. It will 
prevent us from being outflanked, and 
it will pave the way for a second 
‘‘American century.’’ 
One of the primary reasons why the 
20th century was America’s rather than 
Russia’s was because we produced more 
prosperity. You see, wealth is a crucial 
weapon in global competition. Bold in-
vestment in premarket research, like 
that proposed in our Endless Frontier 
Act, will generate more of it and make 
us a wealthier nation. The connection 
is undeniable and historic. 
When human beings began to apply 
science and technology to industry and 
in pursuit of new goods and services, of 
greater efficiency and output, human 
wealth grew by historic bounds. Cog-
nitive scientist Steven Pinker charted 
this progress, and it is staggered. 
Human wealth barely advanced in the 
millennium after the year 1 A.D., and 
had only doubled a half millennium 
later. 
Then the industrial revolution ar-
rived. Between 1820 and 1900, the 
world’s income tripled. Fifty years 
later, it had tripled again, and again in 
25 years, and again 30 years after that. 
This represents a 100-fold expansion of 
the world’s gross domestic product 
since the industrial revolution, thanks 
to advancements in science and tech-
nology. 
And the technologies that ushered in 
this era were the result of curiosity, 
experimentation, 
failure, 
and 
ulti-
mately, discovery. This is the formula 
for innovation, and it is something 
Americans are particularly familiar 
with. 
We are a creative people with a 
penchant for plunging ahead when we 
have an idea and searching for a solu-
tion when we see a problem. 
You know, it takes courage to be cre-
ative, and in America, we encourage 
and honor that courage. We celebrate 
those who try and fail and coura-
geously get up and dust off their trou-
sers and try again. We venerate our in-
ventors—Bell, Edison, George Wash-
ington Carver, Jonas Salk, the Wright 
brothers, Tesla, Einstein, Page and 
Brin, Jobs, Musk. 
We know and remember their names, 
and we benefit daily from their con-
tributions. Their life’s work is a monu-
ment to human potential and Amer-
ican greatness. Their work would not 
have been possible without a hallmark 
of American culture: breathing space— 
yes, breathing space. It is space for the 
creative process—the very process re-
quired to connect things that already 
exist, that no one ever thought of con-
necting, and to take new discoveries 
and turn them into new products and 
services. 
When we join research with Amer-
ican creativity, we do more than 
produce faster cars and TVs with clear-
er pictures, and we do more than gen-
erate material wealth. You see, our 
innovators are part of something far 
more profound. It is an endless pursuit 
of human knowledge and progress and 
a quest that fulfills our deepest human 
needs as a people. That is what they 
are a part of. In the words of my friend 
Water Russell Mead, it is our ‘‘built-in 
human belief that through change we 
encounter the transcendent and the di-
vine.’’ Passing the Endless Frontier 
Act will keep this quest going, and the 
quest will make our lives richer in so 
many ways. 
That image of a Falcon 9 taking off 
and the orange streak of its engines 
cutting the blue sky sparked a memory 
dear to so many Americans. Over 10.3 
million people worldwide watched that 
launch. For many, it was no doubt a re-
minder of an era—that era when rock-
ets regularly setting out for space from 
that very same station was an awe-in-
spiring symbol of American optimism 
and accomplishments. 
There were images, too, from Indian-
apolis. There, Lilly’s scientists rushed 
cases containing the company’s poten-
tial COVID–19 treatment to the airport 
and sent them on their way to patients 
for trials. For those who saw these im-
ages, they inspired hope and amaze-
ment—hope that we can soon stop this 
virus 
and 
amazement 
that 
our 
innovators have moved so quickly to 
find remedies. 
These are both inspiring moments for 
all Americans, ones that transcend so 
many of the differences that threaten 
to divide us. They show us and they 
show the world what America is still 
capable of. They reveal the endless 
frontiers still before us. 
Let us come together now. Let us ac-
celerate boldly into the endless fron-
tier. When life resumes as normal, this 
generation of Americans must not be 
content with merely recovering our 
losses. Instead, we must push ourselves 
to lead. 
Now is the time to pass the Endless 
Frontier Act, to strengthen U.S. lead-
ership in science and tech innovation, 
and to dramatically increase public in-
vestment in emerging technologies. 
Let us choose to lead for ourselves and 
for our children. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. COTTON. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CANCEL CULTURE 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, ‘‘cancel 
culture’’—we hear that in the news a 
lot these days—the idea that we all 
need safe spaces from mean words, trig-
ger warnings on op-eds, or TV shows 
that might constitute a microaggres-
sion. 
This is the language of the campus 
social justice seminar, but increasingly 
it is the language of our workplace and 
our culture. 
We saw an instance of it just last 
week at the New York Times. I pub-
lished an op-ed there that said simply, 
while we respect peaceful protesters, 
we can have zero tolerance for looting 
and rioting, and if the police are over-
whelmed or outnumbered, the National 
Guard and, if necessary, Federal troops 
have to restore order. 
It has gotten support from a large 
majority of Americans, if you believe 
the polls. The New York Times pub-
lished it. The editorial page editor de-
fended it publicly. The publisher de-
fended the decision publicly. But a 
woke-child mob at the New York Times 
rose up and demanded heads on pikes. 
They demanded that the op-ed be taken 
down. 
They 
demanded 
that 
the 
grownups—maybe I should say the sup-
posed grownups—who run the New 
York Times apologize, and that is ex-
actly what happened. In what could 
only be called a struggle session from 
the Cultural Revolution, in the great-
est traditions of Mao, the publisher of 
the New York Times fired the editorial 
page editor, and he reassigned the dep-
uty editorial page editor. He apolo-
gized—prostrated himself—in front of 
the woke-child mob, and he said: ‘‘We 
will do much better.’’ 
The new editorial page editor has 
told everyone at the Times: If you see 
anything that gives you the slightest 
pause, please contact me immediately. 
If you have any trigger warnings, don’t 
worry; I will find a safe space for you.

The New York Times has made itself 
a laughing stock, but this is no laugh-
ing matter because the cancel culture 
threatens the very principles of free in-
quiry and open debate upon which our 
society is based. 
You see other manifestations of the 
cancel culture all across the country 
today. In many cases, they have adopt-
ed the spirit of a Jacobin mob in the 
French Revolution. In a reign of terror, 
they are trying to completely erase our 
culture and our history. Unfortunately, 
many Democrats are vying to be the 
Robespierre for this Jacobin mob. 
Look at what is happening in Se-
attle. Revolutionaries, anarchists have 
taken over city government buildings. 
They have taken over neighborhoods. 
They have declared themselves an au-
tonomous zone. They put up a sign that 
says ‘‘You are leaving the United 
States’’ when you enter this autono-
mous zone. 
The Democratic Party today, I sup-
pose, is still the party of secession. 
It is not just in Seattle. Look at 
what is happening to statues and 
monuments all around our country. In 
several cities, statues of Christopher 
Columbus have been pulled down, or 
they have been defaced or destroyed— 
statues that in most cases were put up 
by Italian American immigrants who 
were proud of their part in the great 
American story. This was not done in 
accordance with law. It was not done 
after thoughtful debate in city councils 
or State legislatures. It was done by 
mobs. Just last week, the Lincoln Me-
morial—a temple to the great emanci-
pator—was defaced. The World War II 
Memorial—a memorial to those who 
fought and liberated the world from 
fascism—was defaced. Now, across the 
Atlantic, the ideological kin of this 
Jacobin mob defaced statues of Church-
ill. Wait until they hear about what 
the other guy did on the other side. 
But, you know, history is not the 
long suit of these woke children. They 
didn’t take history classes, apparently, 
in high school and college. They were 
too busy taking social justice semi-
nars. You can see that, too, in Phila-
delphia, where the statue of Matthias 
Baldwin was defaced. Matthias Baldwin 
was a committed and devoted aboli-
tionist who funded education for freed 
African Americans. He gave them jobs, 
and they defaced his statue. 
Even more amazing, in Boston, the 
Shaw Memorial was defaced. The Shaw 
Memorial honors the 54th Massachu-
setts 
Regiment—the 
first 
African- 
American regiment formed after the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation, 
whose 
bravery and valor in battle on behalf of 
the Union cause was memorialized in 
the movie ‘‘Glory.’’ Yet it was defaced 
by these mobs. 
It is not just our history; it is pop 
culture and entertainment too. You 
may have seen the news that ‘‘Live 
P.D.’’ and ‘‘Cops’’ television shows 
were canceled. ‘‘Paw Patrol’’ was on 
the cutting board too. You may know 
that Chase is the police cop in ‘‘Paw 
Patrol.’’ There are calls to euthanize 
the police dog on social media. I wish I 
could say I am joking, but I am not. 
Legos has announced they are not 
going to advertise any of their police 
Lego sets for the next year. They are 
not going to take them out of distribu-
tion. They are not going to recall them 
from stores. No, no—woke capitalism 
only goes so far. They are still capital-
ists. They are just not going to adver-
tise police sets anymore. 
HBO announced they are not going to 
run ‘‘Gone with the Wind’’ anymore— 
‘‘Gone With the Wind,’’ for which Afri-
can-American actress Hattie McDaniel 
won the first Academy Award, the first 
Oscar ever given to an African-Amer-
ican women. HBO says: ‘‘No, we are 
going to cancel it.’’ 
If you think it is just limited to stat-
ues or TV shows or toys, you would be 
wrong. This woke mob could very soon 
be coming for any one of you. 
At UCLA, a college professor has 
been suspended and is under police in-
vestigation because he declined to 
postpone final exams so students could 
apparently go out and participate in 
protests. 
Another professor is being inves-
tigated for reading aloud from Martin 
Luther King, Jr.’s letter from a Bir-
mingham jail because it uses offensive 
language—Martin Luther King, Jr.’s 
letter from a Birmingham jail. 
A professional soccer player, Alex-
ander Katai, was fired for his wife’s 
tweet—not his own, his wife’s tweet. 
Multiple different business execu-
tives and editors at newspapers and 
magazines have been fired. 
If you think this is only for people 
who are not powerful and not rich, you 
would be wrong. Ivanka Trump was 
scheduled to give a commencement 
speech last weekend at a Wichita tech-
nical school. The speech was canceled 
because she was being too controver-
sial. It was a speech about workforce 
training and women’s opportunities in 
our economy, and Ivanka Trump was 
canceled. 
Where does this cancel culture take 
us? What is the logical conclusion? 
What is the end of the cancel culture? 
I will tell you what it is—it is right 
here in this city, Washington, the Dis-
trict of Columbia. That is where it will 
end if we don’t put an end to the mad-
ness now. Just up the Mall is the Wash-
ington Monument. Are we going to tear 
down the Washington Monument? Are 
we going to rename it the ‘‘Obelisk of 
Wokeness?’’ 
Up the hill is the Washington Na-
tional Cathedral, where so many times 
we have gathered as a nation over the 
years to mourn our great leaders, to 
pray for God’s protection and deliver-
ance in moments of national strife and 
struggle. Are we going to rename the 
Washington National Cathedral the 
‘‘Temple of Reason,’’ as the Jacobins 
did to Notre Dame during the French 
Revolution? 
What are we going to call this city? 
We can’t call it Washington. We can’t 
call it Columbia. We have to come up 
with new names all around because—I 
will 
say 
this—the 
cancel 
culture, 
whether in its malice or its Jacobin 
forms, ultimately is animated by a sin-
gle ideal: that America at its core is 
fundamentally irredeemable and wick-
ed. 
I reject that claim fully and whole-
heartedly. America is a great and noble 
nation. It is the noblest Nation in the 
history of mankind that has struggled 
throughout our history, imperfectly 
but ceaselessly, to live up to our found-
ing creed that all men are created 
equal—the 
single 
greatest 
defense 
against 
tyranny, 
against 
racism, 
against oppression. That is the stake of 
this debate. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE 
VICTIMS OF THE HEINOUS AT-
TACK AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB 
ON JUNE 12, 2016 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
Floridians will never forget the hor-
rific events of June 12, 2016. Four years 
ago, our State, Nation, the city of Or-
lando, and Hispanic and gay commu-
nities were attacked, and 49 innocent 
and beautiful lives were lost. It was an 
evil act. It was an act of terrorism de-
signed to divide us as a nation and 
strike fear in our hearts and minds, but 
we didn’t let it because Floridians are 
resilient. We came together, and we 
supported each other. 
The weeks following the attack will 
always stay with me—days spent in 
hospitals with families, at funerals, at 
wakes with loved ones, and countless 
events throughout the community. As 
a father and grandfather, it was one of 
the hardest things I ever had to do. It 
was heartbreaking. Yet, in this hor-
ribly dark time, the selfless courage of 
so many—from community members, 
to law enforcement, to healthcare 
workers—provided a sense of hope. This 
incredible strength, love, and bravery 
uplifted the community and helped us 
repair and rebuild. 
On the fourth anniversary of this un-
thinkable tragedy, the State of Florida 
comes together to honor the lives lost 
too soon, and we vow to always stand 
up and fight against evil and hatred in 
this world. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res. 614, submitted 
earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 614) honoring the 
memory of the victims of the heinous attack 
at the Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I ask unani-
mous consent that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,

f 
TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
Continued 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, as we 
continue our debate today on the Great 
American Outdoors Act, I thought I 
would come to the floor one more time 
to talk about the benefits of this his-
toric conservation package and what it 
means for the great State and the peo-
ple of Colorado. 
Several years back, this Congress 
worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass 
legislation by Senator SHAHEEN and me 
that required the Commerce Depart-
ment, for the first time in our coun-
try’s history, to break out the outdoor 
economy as a part of our economic 
numbers, to determine how many jobs 
this country had in the outdoor indus-
try in recreation, and to determine the 
overall revenues generated by the 
recreation economy. What we discov-
ered was what we knew intuitively: 
that the recreation economy is a huge 
part of jobs in this country, with over 
5 million jobs. 
In Colorado, you are looking at about 
a $28 billion part of our economy. If I 
could, I just want to talk a little bit 
more about what that means for Colo-
rado and what this bill means as ap-
plied to our State, the benefits envi-
ronmentally of this legislation and the 
economic impact it will have. 
I talked on the floor about the Great 
Sand 
Dunes 
National 
Park. 
Right 
around the year 2000, this legislation 
turned this national monument into a 
national park. Hundreds of thousands 
of people come to the valley to visit 
every year. What is neat about this is 
that it is not just a national park, the 
Great Sand Dunes National Park, but 
it is also an example of how the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund works 
together because it established the 
Great Sand Dunes National Park to 
make sure that the water resource was 
protected that is so instrumental to 
keeping the sand dunes in place. We 
used the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund to purchase elements of land 
around it, like the Baca Ranch and Za-
pata Ranch and other areas, to make 
sure we had this great resource main-
tained for future generations to come. 
Of course, Rocky Mountain National 
Park is the third most heavily visited 
park in the Nation. Almost 5 million 
visitors come to Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park every year. A few years 
back, there were 2.8, 3 million people. 
We have almost doubled the visitors in 
recent times, which has caused a lot of 
challenges for Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park. It has benefited as well 
from the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund because some of the last remain-
ing inholdings within Rocky Mountain 
National Park have been purchased 
using the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
If you look at the Restore Our Parks 
Act, the money in the Great American 
Outdoors Act that will go toward 
catching up with the maintenance 
backlog, this park has about $85 mil-
lion worth of needs in terms of that 
backlog. It has $85 million worth of 
projects, from visitors centers to roads 
and trails. 
Let me show you one of those trails 
right here. You can see this is what it 
looked like. You can see the erosion 
and washouts. This is what happens 
over time with heavy use and weather. 
You can see the work we have been 
able to do to maintain and to catch up 
with the needs in Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park. We can do this across our 
Park System thanks to the Restore 
Our Parks Act. We will put $1.9 billion 
a year—paid for by oil and gas reve-
nues—into our national parks to catch 
up with the maintenance and backlog 
needs at places like Rocky Mountain 
National Park. 
It is $85 million in Rocky Mountain 
National Park. It is $7 to $8 million in 
the Great Sand Dunes National Park. 
In Mesa Verde National Park, it is al-
most $75 million. I will show you Black 
Canyon of the Gunnison right now. 
Black Canyon of the Gunnison is in 
need of nearly $7 to $8 million as well 
for its backlog needs. 
This is a picture I actually took on 
my iPhone. This is a picture I had 
taken while attending a press con-
ference to celebrate a Land and Water 
Conservation Fund purchase. You can 
see 
Park 
Superintendent 
Noble 
is 
pointing across the canyon to the land 
that was purchased using the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. The canyon 
is right here. It is not over the horizon; 
it is right here. This land was on the 
rim of the canyon. It was not a part of 
the park. You can imagine, if some-
body had decided to build something 
there and said ‘‘Why don’t we develop 
that? Why don’t we do something 
else?’’ what that would have meant to 
the national park and enjoyment of 
that park. Using this, they were able to 
get the entire rim of the canyon for the 
National Park System. That is where 
that is. 
If you go to this next picture, you see 
it is not just about national parks. The 
Great American Outdoors Act is not 
just about Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. It is about our forests. It is 
about our national forests, our Bureau 
of Land Management, Fish and Wild-
life, and it is about the Bureau of In-
dian Education. 
This is actually a national monu-
ment. This is Dinosaur National Monu-
ment. If you go to Northern Colorado, 
Dinosaur National Monument straddles 
both the State of Colorado and the 
State of Utah. Some of the best white 
water rafting in the country goes 
through Dinosaur National Monument. 
This is amazing. This is absolutely 
cool. 
You can see these archaeologists who 
are actually hanging on to a wall as 
they do their work. This is known as 
the fossil wall. Hundreds of millions of 
years’ worth of fossils are in this long 
wall at Dinosaur National Monument. 
You can see the fossils and the bones in 
this picture, layer after layer. It is a 
remarkable resource in one of the most 
truly unique areas of Colorado. The 
needs here are tremendous, too, as they 
face erosion and challenges from visi-
tors and access needs to some of these 
resources. 
If you go to Mesa Verde National 
Park, this is truly spectacular. If you 
look at Mesa Verde—for those who 
never had a chance to go there, I hope 
people will have a chance to visit. This 
park was established in 1906. Look at 
this beautiful ridge. Look at the pla-
teau. Look at the cliff dwellings. It is 
remarkable. It was established in 1906 
to preserve and interpret the archae-
ological heritage of the ancestral Pueb-
lo people who made it their home for 
over 700 years. The park protects near-
ly 5,000 known archaeological sites, in-
cluding 600 cliff dwellings—some of the 
best and most notable preserved dwell-
ings in the United States. 
In 2019, they had about 556,000 visi-
tors. This is in the Four Corners area 
of the State, surrounded by towns like 
Cortez, CO; Mancas, CO; Durango, CO— 
areas that rely on tourism and recre-
ation and farming and ranching for 
their jobs. 
In 2018, visitors spent about $58 mil-
lion in these local gateway regions. 
This supported nearly 1,000 jobs, $22 
million in labor income, $40 million in 
value added, and about $72 million in 
economic help in the gateway economy 
surrounding the Mesa Verde National 
Park. They operate about $700 million 
worth of facilities, and they have about 
10 percent of that in need of deferred 
maintenance. So $76 million is their 
total deferred maintenance needs. 
They need to rehabilitate the Chapin 
Mesa 
Civilian 
Conservation 
Corps. 
They need to replace the water, elec-
tric, information, and sewer systems. 
They need to replace the campground, 
water, and road systems. They need to 
improve the historic maintenance op-
erations buildings. That is just some of 
the need at Mesa Verde National Park. 
When we talk about the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, we talk about na-
tional parks, national forests, and BLM 
land and monuments, but we should 
also talk about recreation, because so 
many times this gets lost in our con-
versation on the floor, because it is not 
only recreation in terms of parks and 
the National Forest Service, but it is 
sports complexes, baseball fields, soc-
cer fields, tennis courts—the ability for

States to determine how to use these 
dollars. It is not just the Federal Gov-
ernment that takes all of this money; 
40 percent goes back to the States. 
This is in Runyon Park in Pueblo, 
CO, another southern Colorado city. 
Look how beautiful that is and the 
work we can do with the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. 
Look at the total economic impact. I 
think it is important that we recognize 
that before coronavirus, we were work-
ing on the Great American Outdoors 
Act, this package that presented two 
great American values: the crown jewel 
of our conservation program, the Re-
store Our Parks Act, and the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, to catch up 
with our maintenance backlog, both of 
which are paid for by oil and gas reve-
nues. We talked about them, and we 
talked about how good it would be for 
our environment and the conservation 
and preservation for future genera-
tions. We also acknowledged, then, 
that there was a great economic ben-
efit. We talked about the numbers. We 
talked about the recreation economy. 
But now that economic benefit be-
comes even more important because 
the first industries that were hit by the 
shelter-in-place orders and the eco-
nomic shutdowns were the travel in-
dustry, hotels, restaurants, tourism, 
outfitters, and ski areas. In Colorado, 
they closed down the ski areas months 
ahead of time. The summer recreation 
start has been delayed because of lin-
gering effects of phases in restoring our 
economy. So the economic benefits of 
the Great American Outdoors Act be-
come all the more important. 
Some of the hardest hit communities 
by the coronavirus in Colorado in the 
first wave have some of the highest un-
employment levels in the State. Hotels 
emptied early, and restaurants emptied 
early. But this bill will create thou-
sands and thousands of jobs, according 
to a report that was just released by 
the National Park Service. In Colo-
rado, thousands of jobs will be cre-
ated—in Colorado alone. 
Look at the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. For every $1 million 
spent in the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund, it supports between 16 and 
30 jobs. Support for 16 to 30 jobs—do 
you know what that means in a com-
munity that may have 20 to 22 percent 
unemployment? Surrounded by public 
lands, the Great American Outdoors 
Act will help to put them to work 
while doing what we love in Colorado, 
and that is protecting our environ-
ment. If you look at the overall num-
bers that the National Park Service 
provided, we are going to create and 
help 
to 
support 
over 
100,000 
jobs 
through this legislation, and, again, 
this is legislation that is paid for 
through oil and gas revenues. 
It was a commonsense approach back 
in 1965 when the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund was put together so 
that we access one resource. We deplete 
a resource in oil and gas. They pay a 
severance tax and royalty to the Fed-
eral Government, and the Federal Gov-
ernment turns around and uses that to 
protect our other resources in other 
areas, national parks and national for-
ests. That is what the bill does through 
the Great American Outdoors Act. It 
creates opportunity. 
John Gayle, conservation director of 
the Backcountry Hunters & Anglers 
and a Colorado resident says: ‘‘The 
Great American Outdoors Act not only 
creates permanent certainty for the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
America’s most successful conserva-
tion and access program, it also en-
sures sound stewardship of our public 
lands and waters.’’ 
Carlos Fernandez, Colorado State di-
rector of the Nature Conservancy says: 
The Great American Outdoors Act is crit-
ical to Colorado’s recovery from this crisis. 
Of 
course, 
he 
is 
talking 
about 
COVID–19. 
Our mountains, trails, fields and streams 
have been a welcome respite for many during 
the pandemic, but local economies have 
struggled. Fully funding the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund and investing in our na-
tional parks will put Coloradans back to 
work, protecting important landscapes, in-
vesting in their care, and creating more out-
door recreation opportunities throughout 
the State. These are time-tested, effective 
investments 
in 
conservation 
that 
will 
strengthen Colorado’s economy and amazing 
outdoors. 
Larry Selzer, the president and CEO 
of the Conservation Fund said that the 
‘‘momentum to bring a vote on the 
Great American Outdoors Act to the 
Senate floor is critical to the future vi-
tality of America. Advancing legisla-
tion in both houses to fully fund 
LWCF, as well as to address the main-
tenance backlog on our public lands, is 
a huge step to support our public lands 
and rekindle and grow local outdoors 
and recreation economies.’’ 
Will Shafroth, president and CEO of 
the National Park Foundation—Will’s 
family is legendary in Colorado poli-
tics—says this: 
The National Park Foundation is thrilled 
that the Great American Outdoors Act is 
moving closer to becoming law. Years in the 
making, this bipartisan bill would go a long 
way toward addressing the critical mainte-
nance needs of our national parks. With the 
funds made available through this bill, we 
will ensure that these special places are even 
more special, remain accessible to all Ameri-
cans, and continue to serve as economic en-
gines for local communities. 
Theodore 
Roosevelt 
Conservation 
Partnership: 
The Great American Outdoors Act is smart 
conservation. Senate passage of this historic 
and bipartisan bill will improve our natural 
resources and enhance access for American 
hunters and anglers. It also makes lasting 
investments in our outdoor recreation econ-
omy at a time when we need to get Ameri-
cans back to work. 
Benji Backer, president and founder 
of the American Conservation Coali-
tion: 
Our national parks and public lands are 
part of our heritage as Americans. By pro-
tecting and investing in them we will ensure 
that generations to come will benefit from 
America’s best idea. The American Con-
servation Coalition is proud to support the 
Great American Outdoors Act because it will 
protect this heritage and support the hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans whose live-
lihoods are connected to our national parks. 
This list goes on and on, from the 
Archery Trade Association to the Out-
door Industry Association. The Out-
door Industry Association said: 
The outdoor industry applauds the U.S. 
Senate for seizing the opportunity to pass 
the Great American Outdoors Act, a land-
mark piece of bipartisan legislation. Along 
with the social and health benefits that 
being outdoors provides, there is also a 
strong economic case for doing this now. The 
outdoors are bipartisan, and investing in 
LWCF means investing in local economies 
and creating thousands of jobs, both of which 
we desperately need right now to help the 
country bounce back from COVID–19. 
There is the Corps Network, the Out-
door Recreation Roundtable, and the 
RV industry also. The Presiding Officer 
has a significant RV industry in the 
great State of Indiana. 
The National Marine Manufacturers 
Association—believe it or not, we have 
marine manufacturing in Colorado, 
even though we are a pretty dry, land-
locked State. 
Look at the Motorcycle Industry 
Council, the Specialty Vehicle Insti-
tutes of America, the Recreational Off- 
Highway Vehicle Association, and the 
Congressional 
Sportsmen’s 
Founda-
tion. Jeff Crane said: ‘‘The Great 
American Outdoors Act represents the 
largest commitment to public lands in 
our lifetime.’’ 
‘‘The Great American Outdoors Act 
represents the largest commitment to 
conservation and public lands in our 
lifetime.’’ 
The National Wildlife Federation: 
‘‘Now when we need it most, the Great 
American Outdoors Act will put hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans to 
work restoring public lands infrastruc-
ture, expanding healthy outdoor expe-
riences, and restoring wildlife habitat, 
all of which will help local economies 
recover across the country.’’ 
Suzanne O’Neal—I know Suzanne 
well—the executive director of the Col-
orado Wildlife Federation, said: ‘‘This 
commonsense legislation is long over-
due to help our national parks and 
other public lands meet the burgeoning 
demand of increased numbers of hikers, 
anglers, campers, and wildlife watchers 
who have been flocking to Colorado’s 
outdoor spaces in recent years.’’ 
I talked about that, the fact that 
Rocky Mountain National Park has 
gone from 2.8 million to nearly 5 mil-
lion visitors. It is the third-most vis-
ited national park in the country. 
What happens when one area of the 
State gets heavily visited? It is not 
like they just stay in one area. They 
actually start going to other areas of 
the State. For instance, if you are in 
Colorado, you go to the national park, 
and maybe it is busy one day. So you 
decide to go a little bit farther. You go 
over toward Walden or you go over to 
the North Sand Dunes area or maybe

June 11, 2020 
you spend a little bit of time in the 
White River National Forest, one of 
the most heavily visited forests in our 
State. The Arapaho and Roosevelt Na-
tional Forest and the Pike and San Isa-
bel National Forests are also some of 
the most heavily visited forests in the 
country. They are seeing more and 
more visitors because all of the other 
public lands are under pressure. When 
they are under pressure, that means 
they are more used, and when they are 
more used, they are experiencing more 
wear and tear and they are being loved 
to death. So we need to provide a way 
to fund it. That is what the Great 
American Outdoors Act does. 
There is the National Parks Con-
servation Association, the American 
Horse Council, and the Trust for Public 
Lands. 
Teresa Martinez, the executive direc-
tor of the Continental Divide Trail Co-
alition, said: ‘‘In the Rocky Mountain 
West, public lands and trails are vital 
to our region’s economy and our qual-
ity of life.’’ 
The 
Nature 
Conservancy’s 
Sally 
Jewell, former Secretary of the Inte-
rior, signed a letter with six other Sec-
retaries of the Interior to talk about 
the importance of this bill. Two of 
them are from Colorado. Secretary Ken 
Salazar and Secretary Gale Norton are 
talking about the need for this legisla-
tion. 
The American Society of Landscape 
Architects—the list goes on and on of 
people who support this legislation. 
They support it because we value the 
outdoors. We value our environment, 
and we value our public lands. 
Colorado has long been the gateway 
to public lands in this country, but now 
it is the headquarters to our Nation’s 
public lands with the Bureau of Land 
Management headquartered in Grand 
Junction, CO. 
So these two bills put together rep-
resent that chance in a lifetime, as we 
have heard from many of the sup-
porters of this legislation. In Colorado 
it was called ‘‘the holy grail of con-
servation legislation’’ by the Durango 
Herald this morning. 
It is an opportunity for every State 
to benefit. I have a list of every State 
in the country right here and the work 
they have done. I will just pull one out. 
In Alabama, if you look at Alabama, 
the national parks backlog is nearly 
$30 million. The Land and Water Con-
servation Fund has provided Alabama 
with $165 million in funding over the 
last five decades. Alabama National 
Forest, Blowing Wind Cave National 
Wildlife Refuge, Clear Creek Recre-
ation Area—that is just Alabama. 
Let’s just pull another one out and 
see: Florida. Florida has received $1.06 
billion in funding from the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund over the last 
five decades. There is the Big Cypress 
National Preserve, Everglades Head-
water National Wildlife Refuge, Apa-
lachicola National Forest—I hope I got 
that one right—and the Canaveral Na-
tional Seashore, plus 27 other areas. 
They have a $240 million backlog in de-
ferred maintenance projects, with $75 
million in the Everglades National 
Park. The Dry Tortugas National Park 
is $63 million in need. Gulf Islands Na-
tional Seashore is $60.6 million in 
needs. 
All of these States have benefited 
from coast-to-coast, from sea to shin-
ing sea, from Hawaii to Maine and 
Florida to Alaska. Those are the States 
that have benefited from the legisla-
tion covered by the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
In Colorado alone, the popularity of 
our outdoor recreation and public lands 
continues to grow. Over the last 5 
years, visitation numbers in national 
parks has continued to increase. Na-
tional park visitation in 2019 overall 
surpassed 2018 visits by more than 9 
million visits. That is 327 million 
recreation visits across the country, 
over 
1.4 
billion 
recreation 
visitor 
hours, 13.8 million over the United 
States. That is 2019. 
And 2020, of course, is going to look a 
little different. Some of our national 
parks are not opened yet. Some of 
them are staging their openings. Rocky 
Mountain National Park is open, but 
its reservations are reduced, and the 
entries are reduced to accommodate 
the need to protect people during this 
pandemic. These numbers are going to 
be different. 
So that means that places like Estes 
Park are going to have fewer people in 
their restaurants and fewer people in 
their hotels. Fewer people are stopping 
at the saltwater taffy shop on Main 
Street in Estes, and fewer people are 
doing things like bumper boats and 
putt-putt golf along the way. 
The Great American Outdoors Act is 
one of those pieces of legislation that 
brings everybody in the Chamber to-
gether for a bipartisan opportunity to 
help these communities at a time that 
they need it the most. By helping the 
land, we are helping the communities, 
because it is there for future genera-
tions and because it belongs to future 
generations. 
This really is an opportunity for this 
Nation to come together at a time of 
great need economically and spir-
itually, and, quite frankly, to succeed. 
I am reminded also at this time 
about something I read on the floor 
earlier this week by one of the moving 
leaders of Rocky Mountain National 
Park. He talked about how in our na-
tional parks and trails and forests, we 
find the space we need to think, the 
space we need to hope, to provide cour-
age, and that they can provide a little 
bit more kindness, that what they give 
to us is a little bit more kindness. I 
said often throughout the COVID–19 ex-
perience that we have to keep in mind, 
as we learned in Sunday school, that 
our struggles and tribulations give us 
perseverance, and that perseverance 
leads to courage, and courage leads to 
hope. 
So as we think about what Enos 
Mills, the father of national parks, said 
about the trails bringing back kindness 
that we all need, I think about other 
areas of our National Park System and 
some of our land areas and our na-
tional historic sites that maybe some-
day can benefit from the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. I think about a spe-
cific site in southeastern Colorado 
known as Amache. I have legislation in 
that is a resource study on whether or 
not Amache, CO, should be considered 
as part of the national park system. 
Let me tell you the history about 
Amache. There is a monument down 
the road from this building, just a cou-
ple blocks away from here. It was the 
site in 1943 of a Japanese-American in-
ternment camp. With Executive order 
9066, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said 
that Japanese people would be ripped 
from their homes unconstitutionally 
and put into these camps. 
In 1943, there was a high school es-
tablished at Amache, and a woman by 
the name of Marion Konishi Takehara 
became a valedictorian of the high 
school that they had created. In the 
speech she wrote for her valedictorian 
speech, she talked about what the 
country meant to her today. Did the 
country mean the same things it 
meant to her before she was behind the 
searchlights, removed from her home? 
Did it mean justice and equality and 
fairness? Did she believe in America? 
She went on to talk about all of the 
challenges and struggles and things in 
our history that we know are the dark-
est moments of our Nation—the origi-
nal sin of slavery, the continued dis-
crimination faced by African Ameri-
cans in our communities, the treat-
ment of others in our society, waves of 
immigrants. She talked about how the 
United States has learned from every 
one of those moments, and we can 
overcome them all because America is 
where we learn from our mistakes in 
the past, and we take the actions to 
correct them, and we get back to the 
idea of justice and fairness and equal-
ity. 
I don’t know about you, but I think 
that is the kind of spirit and the kind 
of hope and the kind of belief and faith 
in this country that we need right now 
as we face some of the biggest chal-
lenges this generation has ever seen, 
confronting the issues of racism, con-
fronting the issues of inequality. 
Our national parks, our historic 
areas, and our public lands provide us 
with one more opportunity, one more 
chance to not forget the dark moments 
as we look for greater inspiration 
ahead, as we use this to learn from the 
past, to reach our highest peaks as a 
nation. That is the inspiration of the 
Great 
American 
Outdoors 
Act—the 
work we can do with the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund to bring our 
parks up to snuff for future genera-
tions. 
I know my colleague from the great 
State of Iowa is on the Senate floor. I 
thank him for his support in the work 
we have been doing. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2914 
June 11, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
Wednesday, June 3, this year, the Asso-
ciated Press released an article detail-
ing China’s stonewalling and delay tac-
tics in withholding crucial data from 
the World Health Organization. That 
information that was held was about 
the novel coronavirus that caused 
COVID–19. 
Now, this article gives us a glimpse 
behind the scenes of the World Health 
Organization, and there are a lot of 
questions 
raised 
about 
the 
World 
Health Organization today in regard to 
their relationship with China. The po-
litical leaders at WHO pursued a strat-
egy of placating China in a seemingly 
haphazard attempt to coax China’s 
leader into cooperating more fully. 
Now, despite red flags raised by med-
ical experts within the organization 
about the lack of data coming out of 
China and also serious doubts about 
the Chinese Government’s claim that 
human-to-human transmission was not 
of 
any 
concern, 
WHO 
leadership, 
through all of that, continued lauding 
China’s approach and transparency on 
this whole virus issue. 
Many career officials openly voiced 
their frustration with how the World 
Health Organization leadership lacked 
the willingness to push China to hand 
over vital information about the virus. 
Remember, the World Health Organiza-
tion did publicly push China when it 
withheld information on the SARS out-
break in 2003 but didn’t seem to be as 
interested pushing China as much this 
time. 
The Chinese Government then re-
fused to share data about COVID–19 
test results that would have allowed 
researchers around the world to make 
independent assessments of the virus’s 
spread. 
Now, weeks passed before the Chinese 
Government allowed the World Health 
Organization to see the map of the 
virus genome, and that genome was 
created by Chinese researchers. So 
they had the information where other 
people could start out to try to find a 
vaccine. By that time, the virus was al-
ready spreading around the globe, 
which has led to countless needless 
deaths and immeasurable economic 
damage globally that now rests on the 
shoulders of the Chinese for that hap-
pening. 
I am glad that the World Health Or-
ganization member countries approved 
an investigation as to how the organi-
zation handled COVID–19. I hope this 
will be a truly independent investiga-
tion that will prevent future mishaps. 
Now, in the meantime, we already 
know enough about the actions by the 
World Health Organization manage-
ment to warrant immediate changes. 
Politics must never again get in the 
way of those medical professionals in 
the organization who are actually dedi-
cated to fulfilling the World Health Or-
ganization’s mission to share accurate 
and timely public health information 
and at the same time save lives. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RACISM 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, last week 
I attended a memorial service for my 
constituent Mr. George Floyd, who was 
murdered by Minneapolis police. Like 
so many Minnesotans, my heart is bro-
ken for Mr. Floyd and his family and 
for a Black community that has been 
here too many times. I will once again 
add my voice to the chorus demanding 
that the police officers responsible for 
his death face justice. 
But I keep finding myself thinking 
that Mr. Floyd’s death wasn’t just a 
tragedy and it wasn’t just a crime. It 
was a failure. It was our failure. Sys-
temic racism is built into every level 
of our society, and for 400 years, Black 
and Brown and Indigenous people have 
paid its price. 
Racism isn’t just evil, though it is. It 
is dangerous. And racism isn’t just a 
moral issue, though it is. It is a public 
health issue. And the death of Mr. 
Floyd, like the deaths of so many 
Black and Brown people before him, is 
an indictment of our failure as policy-
makers to fulfill our first and most im-
portant duty, which is to protect the 
lives of the people whom we serve. 
Black lives matter. We need to say it 
loud and often, with strength and with 
purpose, and if we truly mean it, then 
we need to be very clear about why it 
is that so many Black and Brown lives 
are being stolen, and that means we 
can’t just point to systemic racism 
writ large. We have to talk about the 
police. 
This is about the impunity with 
which police officers are allowed to kill 
Black and Brown Americans. This is 
about a society in which police depart-
ments have become fundamentally un-
accountable institutions. This is about 
the fact that law enforcement in Amer-
ica does not deliver equal justice for 
all. 
The institutional racism that plagues 
American law enforcement is real. This 
is not just a few bad cops. It is the en-
tire culture of policing—a culture that 
far too often encourages violence, con-
dones abuse, and resists reforms and 
accountability at every turn. 
This culture kills, and it will con-
tinue to do so unless we stop it. If we 
can’t see that, if we can’t say it, if we 
aren’t ready to use our power and our 
privilege to address this unforgiveable 
failure, well, then we might as well say 
nothing at all. 
So why is it so hard for us to talk 
about these issues? Why is it so hard to 
even admit that there is something 
dangerously wrong about the role that 
police play in our society? 
Well, I think, in part, it is because of 
the respect that we have for police offi-
cers themselves. We ask these men and 
women to put their lives on the line 
every single day. Their job is to run to 
trouble, and hundreds of thousands of 
police officers in my community and in 
all of yours fulfill their duty with skill 
and with courage every day. 
But I think there is something else 
lurking behind our inaction. The vast 
majority of policymakers, especially 
here in Washington, are White, and the 
vast majority of the interactions that 
White people have with police officers 
are positive. 
When we are scared or threatened or 
hurt, well, police officers come to help. 
And when we hear the siren or we see 
a blue uniform, we breathe a sigh of re-
lief, and it is uncomfortable for White 
people to acknowledge that this feeling 
of relief is really about privilege. It is 
uncomfortable to imagine giving up 
some piece of that privilege. 
After all, we all want clean, safe 
streets. We all want quiet, orderly 
neighborhoods. We want to be able to 
call 911 when we are in danger and 
know that the police officers will rush 
to our aid. 
We may even catch ourselves wor-
rying that a police force held account-
able for its abuse of power against 
Black and Brown bodies will be a police 
force a little less empowered to protect 
us. 
Often, when White people talk about 
racism, we define it as a hatred that 
lurks within people’s hearts, and then 
we search within ourselves and we can 
feel satisfied that we are free from 
prejudice. But racism, colleagues, is 
manifested as behavior—behavior that 
hurts, that kills. Who even knows what 
is in ‘‘how to change hearts and 
minds’’? But we do know, I think, let’s 
say: Let’s start with changing behav-
ior. 
So this is something that I think 
about a lot as a Minnesotan. In my 
home State we pride ourselves on our 
legacy of progressive activism. We be-
lieve deeply in civic participation, and 
we are proud to have the highest voter 
turnout in the whole country. We are 
home to a diverse array of commu-
nities—African 
American, 
Somali, 
Hmong, Latinx, Native, and more—all 
people who belong here just as much as 
anyone else. 
And we are home to some of the Na-
tion’s worst racial disparities. It is not 
just that Black men are more likely to 
be stopped, more likely to be searched, 
more likely to be assaulted and killed 
by police officers. A Black or Brown or 
Native child growing up in the neigh-
borhood where George Floyd was mur-
dered can expect worse education out-
comes, worse health, fewer opportuni-
ties than a White child that lives just 
a few miles down the road. 
The truth is that for all of the 
progress that we have made in America 
over the course of my lifetime and for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2915 
June 11, 2020 
all of the hearts and minds that have 
changed, racism was built into our sys-
tems from the very beginning. While it 
is still present in everything from 
healthcare to education, to housing 
and environmental policy, it jumps off 
the page when you look at our Nation’s 
criminal justice system. 
Consider 
this. 
African 
Americans 
make up less than 14 percent of the 
population, but they account for 23 per-
cent of fatal police shootings and near-
ly one-third of our prison population. 
Studies repeatedly show that Black 
people and White people use drugs at 
roughly the same rate, but Black peo-
ple are more than twice as likely to be 
arrested for drug offenses and nearly 
four times as likely when it comes to 
marijuana. 
No matter where you look, our crimi-
nal justice system unfairly targets 
Black and Brown and Native people, 
threatening their freedom and often 
their lives, and you can’t just blame 
that on racist cops. That is us doing 
that. Even if we harbor no hatred in 
our hearts, we are responsible for the 
racist impact of a system that was 
built historically by White Americans 
to serve White Americans. 
We are the beneficiaries of a system 
that killed George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, Ahmaud Arbery, Atatiana Jeffer-
son, Sandra Bland, Aiyana Stanley- 
Jones, Rekia Boyd, Jessica Hernandez, 
Eric Salgado, Philando Castile, Jamar 
Clark, and so many others. 
So that is a hard thing to admit, but 
right now hundreds of thousands of our 
fellow citizens are demanding that we 
face this ugly truth. 
The people marching in our streets 
have watched us forgive ourselves time 
and again for failing Black and Brown 
Americans, like George Floyd, and 
they are angry, they are grieving, and 
they are exhausted, and this time they 
will not be denied. 
It may make us uncomfortable to 
hear this anger, to see the images on 
television, to experience this turmoil 
when our country is going through so 
much already, but that is the whole 
point of protest. This crisis has long 
deserved our attention, and because we 
withheld that attention, these pro-
testers are demanding it now. 
We cannot claim to support the goal 
of justice if we object to being con-
fronted with the reality of injustice. 
We cannot walk away from this moral 
crisis. We have done that too many 
times after too many deaths, and every 
time we do, we fail the next Black or 
Brown American who dies in police 
custody. 
I just can’t live with that. We have to 
make a change, and this time, White 
people have to get past our discomfort. 
Black and Brown people have been try-
ing for too long to tell us that systemic 
racism isn’t just limiting their oppor-
tunities. It is killing their children. 
To the communities of color in Min-
nesota, whom I am proud to represent, 
I want you to know that I hear you and 
that I will do everything I can to make 
sure that everyone here in Washington 
hears you too. 
Most of all, we have to devote our 
time, our energy, our resources, our 
platforms, our power, and our privilege 
to helping this movement succeed. 
As Pastor Billy Russell from the 
Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist 
Church in Minneapolis said to me, ‘‘we 
need to make it right. It’s not right 
now, but we need to make it right.’’ 
I want to tell my Minnesota commu-
nity, my colleagues, and the American 
people exactly how I want to use my 
power and my privilege to help make it 
right. 
In the coming weeks, my office will 
be moving forward with legislative ac-
tion focused on three priorities: first, 
fundamentally transforming the role of 
the police in our society from the way 
we fund and train and equip officers to 
the relationships between departments 
and the communities that they serve. 
We must rethink the responsibilities 
we assign to the police and the author-
ity we give them to fulfill those re-
sponsibilities. We need to imagine and 
reinvent American policing from the 
ground up. 
Second, we must fix the systems in 
police departments that obstruct ac-
countability and transparency at every 
turn. Our system effectively puts cops 
above the law by insulating them from 
civil and criminal liability for their ac-
tions. This leads people of color to con-
clude that they can’t trust the police, 
and it leads the police to conclude that 
they will never face consequences for 
crossing the line. They are both right, 
and this means something is wrong. If 
we want to change the way officers act, 
we need to change the rules that shield 
them from accountability. Account-
ability and preventing this misconduct 
from being ignored will not only hold 
police departments responsible for per-
petuating violence and unequal justice, 
but it will help prevent violence and in-
justice the next time. 
The Justice in Policing Act, led by 
my colleagues Senator HARRIS
and 
Senator BOOKER, is an important step 
forward. I am proud to support it, and 
I urge all of my colleagues to join in. 
Racism is about behavior. We can’t leg-
islate what police officers believe, but 
we can and we must legislate how they 
behave. 
Third, restoring the communities 
that have been torn apart by injus-
tice—in the Twin Cities, neighbors are 
already coming together to clean up 
the damage sustained by the unrest 
and upheaval of the last 2 weeks, but 
the task of making our communities 
whole goes far beyond repairing the 
physical damage. We need a new and 
sustained push for racial and economic 
justice, not just law enforcement but 
in healthcare and education and in 
housing and in environmental policy. 
The people I spoke to when I was 
home last weekend are grieving, they 
are angry, and they are hurt, but most 
of all, they are exhausted. Commu-
nities of color have spent years fight-
ing to be heard, fighting for justice, 
fighting for resources, fighting for sur-
vival. As their Senator, it is my job to 
carry that fight here to Washington in 
the Senate. 
Four hundred years of structural rac-
ism cannot be overcome with a single 
piece of legislation or even by a single 
generation of legislators, but we can’t 
let the enormity of the task blind us to 
the urgency of this work. 
The last 2 weeks have been extraor-
dinarily difficult for Minnesotans and 
for our country. But, throughout his-
tory, the hardest times have always 
been the times of the greatest progress. 
I choose to find purpose in making sure 
that, in this moment, we lead to real 
progress towards justice and equality. 
That is why I came to the floor 
today. No statement of intent, no mat-
ter how thoughtful, will change the re-
ality of this crisis, but I want this 
statement to be on the record, part of 
my record as a U.S. Senator. I want to 
be accountable for these commitments. 
I want Minnesotans to hold me ac-
countable. I want to be a part of hold-
ing this body and all of us in the Sen-
ate accountable. 
This, then, will be the first in a series 
of floor speeches I intend to deliver ex-
amining the systemic injustice that 
plagues American policing and plagues 
Native, Black, and Brown communities 
more broadly. It will be about the steps 
we need to take to address this injus-
tice: redefining the role of the police, 
reinforcing accountability for police 
officers, and restoring the communities 
I am so blessed to serve. 
This is a big fight. The scale of the 
injustice is overwhelming. It can be 
hard to know where to start, but the 
people who took to the streets last 
week—in the Twin Cities, in commu-
nities large and small across Min-
nesota, and in cities across this coun-
try—are a movement for change, and 
they are showing us the path forward. 
This path requires us to be courageous, 
requires us to be humble, and requires 
us to be uncomfortable, but it is a path 
rooted in love and in trust and in hope. 
We saw it in the way the protesters 
brought joy to the most serious of 
fights they faced. We saw it in the way 
they stood up to those who would do 
damage to their communities and to 
their cause. We saw it in the way they 
kept their focus, even in the face of un-
imaginable brutality. 
So many Minnesotans have shown 
such courage and grace. I am proud to 
be your Senator, and I am proud to be 
your neighbor. I am committing myself 
to the path that you are forging. I hope 
my constituents, my colleagues in the 
Senate, and all of my fellow Americans 
will do the same. 
I yield the floor.

the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
and to address the deferred mainte-
nance backlog for our national parks. 
Under the expert leadership of Sen-
ators GARDNER, MANCHIN, and DAINES, 
59 bipartisan Senators have cospon-
sored this bill that will allow land-
owners, States, local communities, and 
conservation partners to plan for the 
future and to restore our national 
parks. 
More than 50 years ago, the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund Act estab-
lished America’s most successful con-
servation and outdoor recreation pro-
gram. There is truly nothing else like 
it. The fund was designed to ensure 
that outdoor recreational lands would 
be secured for future generations. 
I remember, in one of my first years 
in the Senate, working with my col-
league from Colorado, Senator and 
later Secretary of the Interior Ken 
Salazar, as we sought to boost the 
funding for the stateside part of the 
program. 
If you look at a map of the United 
States and put a pin in every place 
where there was a Land and Water Con-
servation Fund stateside supported 
program, you would find that every 
single county in the country had at 
least one project. Oftentimes, people do 
not realize that local ballpark or the 
trails that run along a local stream or 
lake are the result of funding from the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
and those are projects that are de-
signed by local people, selected by 
local people, and then the Federal Gov-
ernment helps in the funding to ac-
quire and maintain the land. 
Just last year, this important pro-
gram was permanently authorized, and 
now we have the opportunity to ensure 
for the American people that this pro-
gram will have consistent funding to 
play the strongest possible role in pre-
serving open spaces, special lands, and 
revitalizing communities for years to 
come. 
Investments in this landmark con-
servation program support access to 
the outdoors for all Americans, as 
LWCF, as I have mentioned, has in-
vested in literally every county in our 
country. Its funding has been used to 
open up key areas for hunting, fishing, 
and other recreational access; to sup-
port working forests and ranches and 
protect them from development; to ac-
quire inholdings and protect critical 
lands in national parks, national wild-
life refuges, national forests, Civil War 
battlefields, and other Federal areas; 
and, as I mentioned, my favorite part 
of the program, which is the stateside 
part of the program, which supports 
State and local projects, from ball-
parks to recreational trails. 
Over the past five decades, Maine has 
received more than $191 million in 
funding from LWCF. Examples of this 
funding include the Cold Stream For-
est, a Forest Legacy Program project 
in Somerset County to preserve a beau-
tiful area that continues the long and 
proud Maine tradition of conservation, 
public access to recreation, and work-
ing forests. 
In addition, we have the Rachel Car-
son National Wildlife Refuge in south-
ern Maine, where a once-undeveloped 
110-acre tract along the coast in Bidde-
ford was preserved for natural habitat 
and expanded recreational access. 
Of the more than 850 Land and Water 
Conservation Fund sites in Maine, 650 
are community-based projects, from 
Riverside Park in Fort Kent in north-
ern Maine to Haley soccer fields in 
Kittery, right near the New Hampshire 
border. 
I want to repeat that statistic again. 
Out of the 850 Land and Water Con-
servation Fund sites in the State of 
Maine, 
650 
are 
community-based 
projects, like the park in Fort Kent 
that I mentioned and the soccer fields 
in Kittery. 
In its more than 50-year history, 
however, this program has been funded 
fully only twice at the authorized level 
of $900 million. I believe that Congress 
should fully fund this program to de-
liver on the promise that was made to 
the American people back in 1964 to 
take a portion of the proceeds from 
natural resource development, such as 
offshore oil drilling, and invest a por-
tion in conservation and outdoor recre-
ation. 
I do want to recognize two of my col-
leagues who have other ideas—Senator 
CASSIDY and Senator WHITEHOUSE—for 
bringing up the issue of funding for 
coastal States. Representing a coastal 
State, I agree that we need to do more 
for our coastal States, and I support 
their efforts to ensure additional fund-
ing that can be directed to coastal 
States and coastal communities. I be-
lieve, however, that that issue, regret-
tably, is going to have to be dealt with 
at a later time, but I do support their 
effort. 
Furthermore, 
another 
important 
piece of this bill addresses our deferred 
maintenance backlog on our Nation’s 
public lands. Now, what I am most in-
terested in here is our national parks. 
Our national parks have a huge main-
tenance backlog, and that includes at 
Acadia National Park, a true gem of a 
park on the coast of Maine where we 
have seen record numbers of visitors in 
recent years. This bill will help Acadia 
National Park tackle the more than $60 
million of maintenance backlog work— 
on trails, roads, bridges, buildings—to 
ensure that every visitor can experi-
ence the absolute beauty of this true 
gem of a national park on the Maine 
coastline. 
I would urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this important legis-
lation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is telling 
that the bill we are considering this 
week called the Great American Out-
doors Act was written behind closed 
doors and has now been hermetically 
sealed, walled off from amendments, by 
the people’s elected representatives. 
Forget the theatrics in Seattle; this 
bill is the real Capitol Hill autonomous 
zone. In its current form, this bill en-
ables the Federal Government, if it is 
enacted, to purchase new lands in per-
petuity, without accountability and 
without oversight or any measures to 
make sure that it can actually care for 
the land that it owns, perpetuating and 
worsening our already highly problem-
atic Federal public lands policy. 
This policy will have one overarching 
impact: to make life easier for politi-
cians and bureaucrats and harder for 
the American people whom they, osten-
sibly, serve. 
This is not the way the Senate is sup-
posed to run. The point of this body, its 
whole reason for existence, is to take 
imperfect bills, bring them to the floor 
of the Senate, and then come together 
so that we can hone and fine-tune 
them, so that we can debate them and 
discuss them, so that we can identify 
their weak points and make them 
stronger—or at least less weak. 
The Senate is supposed to have an 
open debate and amendment process 
precisely so that we can raise concerns 
and we can find solutions and arrive at 
genuine, 
rather 
than 
forced, 
com-
promise and consensus. This week, I 
have been encouraged to discover just 
how many of my colleagues want to do 
just that. Many of my colleagues from 
different States and from both parties 
are filing amendments in response to 
this bill. Some of those amendments 
would significantly change it; others 
would present simply small tweaks to 
tighten up the language or to provide 
for better congressional oversight so 
that the American people are guaran-
teed that what it says in the law is 
going to reflect what happens on the 
ground. These amendments have al-
ready been written. They are waiting 
for consideration. 
Anyone watching C–SPAN 2 today 
will notice there is nothing else hap-
pening on the Senate floor—I mean, lit-
erally nothing else happening on the 
Senate floor. In fact, I would note for 
the record that there are exactly three 
Members of the Senate in the Chamber 
right now—two on the floor and one at 
the Presiding Officer’s desk. There is 
literally nothing else happening on the 
Senate floor. There is literally no other 
business with pressing deadlines pend-
ing before this body right now. The 
House of Representatives is adjourned 
and is apparently set to remain ad-
journed until June 30, so it is not as 
though we have any realistic deadline 
with the other side of the Capitol. 
The Senate, right now, would simply 
rather do nothing than vote on amend-
ments that those of us from the West, 
Senators from the gulf coast and from 
various States around the country, 
would like to propose and have, in fact, 
proposed. 
I myself have proposed several. One 
of my amendments would require State 
legislative approval for any land acqui-
sition proposed in that State so that

land acquisition would be something 
Washington does with the States rath-
er than to the States. 
Many people don’t realize there is a 
big disparity among and between the 
States with regard to how much Fed-
eral land is owned. In every State east 
of Colorado, the Federal Government 
owns less than 15 percent. In every 
State Colorado and west, the Federal 
Government owns more than 15 per-
cent. The average is more like 50 per-
cent in the Western United States, and 
in many of those States, including my 
own, it is more like two-thirds of the 
land. 
In these States and particularly the 
rural communities and those rural 
communities in particular where there 
is the highest concentration of Federal 
land, there is also poverty—poverty 
that is not just correlated with or coin-
cidental to the Federal land ownership, 
but it is causally connected to its wide-
spread existence. 
Another of my amendments would re-
quire the Federal Government to dis-
pose of current Federal lands before ac-
quiring new ones, forcing land agencies 
to exercise fiscal responsibility and 
prioritize which lands they want to 
keep under their control. 
So getting back to referring a few 
minutes ago to those areas, particu-
larly those rural areas in my State, 
places like San Juan County, UT—San 
Juan County, UT, happens to be the 
poorest county in the State. It is also 
a place where the Federal Government 
owns 95-plus percent of the land. This 
is not a coincidence. 
So there ought to be something in 
place that requires an offset so that 
when the Federal Government buys 
new land under the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund or otherwise, it has 
to offset it by disposing of land else-
where. 
There also ought to be some mecha-
nism in place so as to give the State’s 
sovereign lawmaking body, the State 
legislature, the ability to accept or re-
ject the proposed expansion of the Fed-
eral land footprint in that State. 
It is really easy for my colleagues 
from certain parts of the country—par-
ticularly those living east of the Rocky 
Mountains—to suggest that, you know, 
Federal land ownership is a great 
thing. First of all, a lot of people who 
say that do live east of the Rocky 
Mountains, and a lot of people who say 
that also incorrectly imagine that Fed-
eral public lands are more or less just 
national parks or declared wilderness 
areas. They are not. 
In my State, most of the Federal 
land is not a national park, is not a na-
tional recreation area, is not a declared 
wilderness area; it is just garden-vari-
ety BLM or Forest Service land that is 
chronically 
environmentally 
mis-
managed, and that leads to chronic en-
vironmental and economic problems. 
I also have a number of other amend-
ments that would reform the NEPA 
process—the process under the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act—to 
help address the maintenance backlog 
on neglected land that Washington, 
DC, already owns and controls from its 
perch generally thousands of miles 
from the land in question. 
Finally, I have an amendment to sup-
port Utah’s interests under the Antiq-
uities Act. Right now, other States 
have received protection and are pro-
tected from unilateral land grabs by 
the Federal Government for designa-
tion of national monuments. This is 
important, you see, because when they 
designate Federal land as a national 
monument, that changes the way that 
land can be accessed, the way it can be 
used. It goes from one Federal land 
classification to another. It is one of 
the strictest classifications in the 
sense that it is very, very difficult to 
use that land or for local affected popu-
lations to have influence over that land 
once it becomes a monument. 
This is significant for Utah because 
28 percent of the national monument 
acreage designated within the 50 States 
over the last 25 years has been in Utah. 
My State is due for the same types of 
protections that are already in place in 
Wyoming and in Alaska. Those States 
in years past have received far too 
many monument designations against 
their will. Eventually, they received 
statutory protection. 
Utah has borne far more than its 
share of the burden in the designation 
of national monuments—monuments 
designated that way, by the way, by 
Presidents who were acting in open 
willful defiance of the will of the lo-
cally affected populations. 
I believe that this is one of the most 
important changes we need to see in 
Federal lands policy. I will continue to 
fight for it until we achieve justice for 
Utah. In fact, this change could be 
achieved through a single 1-page bill, 
one mostly consisting of two words. In-
serting the words ‘‘Or Utah’’ enables 
Utah to receive the same protection 
from hostile designation of national 
monuments by a President not inter-
ested in the will of the local popu-
lation. 
As important as all of these amend-
ments are to me and my State, I am 
not even asking for the right to pro-
pose all of them this week. I am willing 
to set aside some of my priorities in 
order to help my colleagues pursue 
theirs and, most of all, to help the Sen-
ate as an institution to get back to the 
essential work that the Senate and the 
Senate alone can do. The Senate was 
created to be the place—the one place 
in 
our 
constitutional 
framework— 
where our diverse, divided Nation could 
come together, where we could air our 
disagreements 
and 
find 
common 
ground. 
Every time we have a national con-
troversy, a lot of people throw around 
the word ‘‘conversation.’’ We need to 
have a conversation about race, about 
police brutality, about freedom of 
speech, about the environment, about 
the national debt. The list goes on and 
on. These are all things about which we 
need to have conversations. This isn’t 
just a media trope. Senators say it too. 
I agree. We need to have conversations 
about each of these and so many other 
important national issues. 
Guess what. This, right here, is lit-
erally the room where America is sup-
posed to have these conversations. This 
place right here, within these four 
walls, is where these conversations are 
supposed to happen. It is not supposed 
to be done only on Twitter. It is not 
supposed to be done only on cable news 
shows. It is supposed to happen right 
here on this floor. 
Yet here we are on a Thursday after-
noon at 4:23, 4:24 p.m. Look around. 
Three Members are in the Chamber— 
two on the floor, one in the Chair. That 
is it. 
This is where the conversation is sup-
posed to happen. It is not occurring— 
not this conversation, nor any other, 
not on the Senate floor, not in the mid-
dle of the week. With a whole lot of 
things going on in the world, we are 
not having it. 
We are not even having it on this 
piece of legislation, which, significant 
as it is, is dwarfed in comparison to the 
magnitude of many other issues that 
we have to deal with. That doesn’t 
mean we don’t need to deal with this 
legislation. We do. But as long as we 
are going to deal with it, as long as we 
are being asked to pass it, we need to 
at least have a conversation about it, 
and we are not doing that. 
The only reason that the U.S. Senate 
was given the powers that we have in 
this body by the Founders and by our 
constituents is to facilitate those vital 
conversations. This isn’t the New York 
Times op-ed page. We are not supposed 
to be afraid of debate here. The Senate 
is here to provide the venue where all 
Americans and all views can be heard, 
to hash out our differences and arrive 
at a consensus and compromise in the 
public eye. 
It is especially important to do this 
in the Senate because this is the place 
where each State has equal representa-
tion. Big, heavily populated States 
have two Senators. So do small, sparse-
ly populated States have two Senators. 
This, by the way, is the one type of 
change that cannot be made to the 
Constitution. It is the one type of con-
stitutional amendment that is, itself, 
preemptively 
unconstitutional. 
You 
can’t pursue article VI of the Constitu-
tion or amend the Constitution in such 
a way—even if you follow the article V 
amendment procedures, you cannot 
amend it in a way that changes the 
principle of equal representation in the 
Senate among and between the States. 
It is especially important to have 
these debates and discussions when it 
comes to legislation like this one, like 
the Great American Outdoors Act, 
that, while important to the entire Na-
tion in many respects, affects some 
States differently than it does others. 
This bill has a very different impact in 
Utah than it does in Colorado or in 
Montana or in Tennessee or in Maine. 
It is very, very different.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2918 
June 11, 2020 
This is why we have the Senate—so 
that we can air out these grievances, so 
that we can air out our differences, so 
that we can make improvements to 
legislation. 
Perhaps we can’t improve it. There 
are a lot of things about this bill I 
don’t like. There are other things 
about it I can live with. Yet if we can’t 
have the conversation, we don’t have 
the ability to amend or improve the 
legislation. As a result, the conversa-
tion doesn’t happen. And most of the 
American people are excluded from 
this debate and this discussion and this 
conversation entirely. 
This is where these conversations are 
supposed to occur, where we can arrive 
at consensus and compromise in the 
public eye. And this, I should note, is 
not for our convenience and comfort. 
Rather, the Senate’s purpose as a delib-
erative body is to add another layer of 
republican and democratic legitimacy 
to the very laws we pass. The House ex-
ists to assert immediate public opinion 
on the basis of the proportional rep-
resentation they have on that side of 
the Capitol. 
The Senate exists to identify broad- 
based compromise and consensus that 
is essential to the political legitimacy 
in a nation as diverse as ours, and to do 
so in a way in which each State is 
equally represented. That is why we re-
quire supermajorities to end debate 
here. That is why we have 6-year 
terms. It is not to serve us. It is, rath-
er, so we can serve everyone else. 
But right now, we are abusing our 
constitutional privilege. We are will-
fully taking the powers of the Amer-
ican people—the powers that they gave 
us, that they have given us—to deny 
them their right to a diverse, delibera-
tive, transparent, accountable process. 
We are doing this for no other purpose 
than for our own convenience. No won-
der they can’t stand us. 
But it is not too late. It is not even 
too late for this week. There is still 
plenty of time to salvage this process, 
to flex our badly atrophied legislative 
muscles and to get to work. 
After speaking with my colleagues 
all week, and, frankly, all of last week 
on these topics, I believe the consensus 
concerns about this bill are as follows: 
one, the inequity of natural resource 
revenue-sharing between the Federal 
Government and the States; two, the 
cost of the National Parks and Public 
Land Legacy Restoration Fund; three, 
the cost of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, or LWCF; four, the im-
plications of an ever-expanding Federal 
land ownership; and, five, transparency 
for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. 
We could pick just one amendment 
for each of the aforementioned cat-
egories—just one for each of those cat-
egories. We could have just five amend-
ments all together. By so doing, we 
could make significant progress on this 
legislation. More than that, we could 
strengthen 
our 
legislative 
muscle 
memory and take a step toward restor-
ing the vital deliberative powers of this 
body. 
The Senate has long called itself the 
world’s 
greatest 
deliberative 
body. 
These days, when it doesn’t debate, 
when it shuts out amendments from in-
dividual Members—keeping in mind 
that this is supposed to be one of the 
two fundamental rules of the Senate, 
where each Member has access to un-
limited debate and unlimited amend-
ments—when it does this, it is neither 
great nor deliberative. It is not living 
up to its name, to its history, to its 
traditions, to its capacity, nor to its 
constitutional purpose. 
Five amendments are not a lot, espe-
cially considering this legislative text 
bypassed the committee process all to-
gether in the first place. This bill, as a 
bill, was never even processed by the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee, on which I serve. It by-
passed that committee all together. It 
didn’t go through it. Even if the Senate 
votes on these amendments and votes 
them down—notwithstanding the fact 
that we bypassed the committee—it is 
here now. There is nothing in the Con-
stitution that says it has to go through 
committee. It is better if we do. We 
didn’t here. We can still deal with some 
of the concerns that individual Mem-
bers have. This is the appropriate place 
to do that, after all, with or without 
committee action. 
Regardless of the outcome of those 
votes, even if the Senate votes those 
amendments 
down—every 
one 
of 
them—at least we will then be on 
record about our priorities and about 
our positions. At least then we have a 
chance to weigh in and say: Here is 
what I liked about the bill, and here is 
what I didn’t like about the bill. 
That, in turn, helps us to commu-
nicate to the public about why we ei-
ther do or don’t support whatever leg-
islation is intact at the end of that 
process. That, in turn, would strength-
en the bonds of accountability between 
the government and the governed, and, 
I would hope, restore some of the pub-
lic trust that Washington, DC, has 
squandered for the last several decades. 
If we require Senators to speak on 
their amendments and then move to a 
vote, we could dispose of all five of 
these amendments in just a few hours. 
We could do this today. We could have 
done it earlier today. We could have 
done it at any moment yesterday. It is 
just not too much to ask. We have to 
give this, like all legislation, the due 
consideration and the careful delibera-
tion that it deserves and that the 
American people deserve. 
Now, more than ever, our country 
needs us to be able to come together, 
work together, and find solutions to 
the problems that we face. I believe 
this bill presents us with an oppor-
tunity to do precisely that. I am hope-
ful that my colleagues and I will get 
the chance to take it. This is what we 
need to do. 
We know that the Senate in the past 
has functioned in such a way as to 
allow every Member of this body to 
represent his or her State. We also 
know that can’t really happen in a way 
that our system has always con-
templated unless every Senator has a 
chance to weigh in on and to propose 
improvements to each bill and not be 
shut out of a process. What we get 
when we jettison that is, instead, a 
process by which a small handful of in-
dividuals will write legislation, that 
legislation gets airdropped on to the 
Senate floor in a hermetically sealed 
Chamber, and then Members are told: 
You have to vote for this entire pack-
age or against this entire package. You 
have a simple binary choice: Take it 
all or leave it all. 
That isn’t fair. The American people 
deserve better. We have settled. It is 
time for us to no longer settle, but to 
expect more, to expect the Senate to do 
its work. 
Consistent with that, I think it is im-
portant for us to propose alternatives. 
I have nothing but a desire to see these 
things debated and discussed. In order 
to do that, I am proposing a solution. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to set aside the pending amend-
ments and call up the following amend-
ments en bloc: Kennedy amendment 
No. 1599, which would allow Gulf States 
to receive a greater portion of revenues 
produced from energy sources off their 
coast; Cruz amendment No. 1651, which 
would reflect honest budgeting prac-
tices, direct the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to sell off excess Federal lands to 
the public as the ‘‘pay for’’ for this leg-
islation, subject all Trust Fund spend-
ing to congressional oversight through 
the appropriations process, and strike 
the provision that allows the Trust 
Fund to receive credit for interest that 
will not really be earned based on 
money that does not really exist; 
Braun amendment No. 1635, which 
would prevent unrelated spending in-
creases in the future by reducing the 
discretionary budget limit by $450 mil-
lion; Lee amendment No. 1647, which 
would prohibit the Federal Govern-
ment from making acquisitions using 
LWCF funds until they have received 
from the State, where the proposed ac-
quisition would be located, notice that 
the State has enacted legislation ap-
proving the acquisition; and finally, 
Lee amendment No. 1639, which would 
require reports to Congress on costs of 
acquisition, maintenance, and adminis-
tration of lands obtained under the 
LWCF, reports to States and local 
units of government regarding lost 
property taxes due to LWCF land ac-
quisitions, and reports to Congress on 
Restoration Fund projects to be fund-
ed, currently being funded, and the 
amount of money expended for that 
project, as well as an estimate of ex-
penditures needed to complete each 
project. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate vote on the amendments in 
the order listed with no intervening ac-
tion or debate, and that the amend-
ments be subject to a 60-affirmative

that 
following 
disposition 
of 
the 
amendments 
listed, 
the 
remaining 
pending amendments be withdrawn, 
with the exception of the substitute

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection. 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like 
to note now for the record that there 
are exactly two Senators remaining in 
the Senate Chamber. It is now 4:38 p.m. 
Now we are three again—now four. We 
have four Senators in the Chamber at 
4:39 p.m. on a Thursday. This is not the 
end of the week, unless perhaps you are 
in the U.S. Senate. 
There is no reason why the Senate 
shouldn’t be convening and debating 
amendments right now in order to do 
this. There is no valid reason why 
Members who understand and appre-
ciate the legitimate concerns that are 
the focus of this or any other piece of 
legislation ought not be able to raise 
concerns with that legislation and offer 
up amendments to improve the legisla-
tion in question, especially as is the 
case here. 
There are particular States, includ-
ing my own, that would be dispropor-
tionately disadvantaged and harmed by 
this legislation. It is interesting to 
note that the Federal Government 
owns more of my State than in almost 
any other State, than it does in any of 
the States of any of the sponsors or 
prominent cosponsors of this legisla-
tion. Some of the cosponsors, in fact, 
are people who live in States where the 
Federal Government owns very little 
land. Look, I don’t complain—no fault. 
In some cases our disagreements here 
represent 
differences 
in 
our 
back-
ground or differences in the preferences 
of our constituencies, but as much as 
anything, I think they stem from and 
reflect differences in the States that 
we represent, not just the preferences 
of the voters, but also the way the pub-
lic land is owned—the extent to which 
Federal public land is owned and the 
impact that it has on our local econo-
mies. This is a big deal. 
So like I say, I don’t fault them. I re-
gard each of the people behind this leg-
islation as beloved friends and col-
leagues and as people who I deeply re-
spect and trust and admire. They are 
people with whom I have agreed and 
cooperated with on countless instances 
on many wide-ranging topics. 
They are not wrong to want to pass 
legislation that they believe is correct. 
They are, however, grossly mistaken in 
believing that it is appropriate in this 
circumstance to shut out Members of 
this body who have a different point of 
view, to exclude them from the debate 
process. 
One could argue and some might 
argue in connection with this: Fine, 
let’s debate it. We are debating it right 
now. What is debate after all other 
than giving speeches in a legislative 
body? 
That is what we are doing, and that 
statement is true as far as it goes. Nev-
ertheless, in order for that debate to 
have full meaning, we need to follow 
our own rules, and we need to allow 
Members, pursuant to our rules—and 
not just our rules, but also our prece-
dents—our time-honored traditions and 
the spirit of comity that once inhab-
ited and pervaded every corner of this 
room. It is that spirit of comity, those 
traditions, and those rules that really 
contemplate a much more collegial en-
vironment, one in which we don’t come 
to the floor with legislation and say: 
That is it. There is no more. That is it. 
This legislation was written as if on 
stone tablets. There is no more to be 
written. This book is sealed. You can’t 
have anything more to say. 
That is not how colleagues treat each 
other. That is how one would treat a 
subordinate, and frankly, I think it is 
insulting—not to me but to those I rep-
resent and to those represented by my 
colleagues doing it. 
What I find also offensive is the no-
tion that it is so important somehow 
and so urgent to pass this legislation 
that we do so now, and that we not 
wait until next week to consider it. 
But it is apparently not important 
enough to allow individual Members to 
introduce amendments—even amend-
ments crafted in good faith, amend-
ments that wouldn’t do any structural 
damage to the bill, amendments that 
may or may not pass, but that haven’t 
been written by the principal authors 
and principal proponents of this legis-
lation. This institution is better than 
that, and I thought we were. I think we 
owe each other more than that. 
Look, this isn’t always going to be 
the case in every single piece of legisla-
tion. There are a number of things that 
are passed by this body by unanimous 
consent. Others that come to the floor 
will receive an overwhelming vote one 
way or another and don’t necessarily, 
in every circumstance, trigger the need 
for amendments. Those are, in some 
cases, matters that are relatively non-
controversial. I see no reason for an 
open amendment process if we were, for 
example, to declare June 2020 to be Na-
tional Sofa Care Awareness Month. I 
don’t think anybody is going to care 
that much about that legislation, cer-
tainly not enough to care deeply about 
filing amendments. In other cases, 
some legislation might have been ade-
quately vetted through a process of 
committee action and public debate to 
the point where maybe no one really 
sees the need for additional amend-
ment by the time it gets to the floor. 
But that is not always going to be the 
case. It should come as no surprise 
with a piece of legislation like this 
one, sweeping in its effect, adding to 
our already unaffordable mandatory 
spending, putting Federal land acquisi-
tion on an equal footing with programs 
like Social Security and Medicare by 
making it mandatory. Any time you 
trigger any of these alarm bells, it 
ought to send a signal that this is not 
an appropriate moment to expect that 
no Member from any State will have 
any different perspective. It is not 
right. Deep down they know it is not 
right. 
I have seen each of my most vocal 
proponents of this legislation on the 
receiving end of this very kind of strat-
egy. I have stood with them as they 
have stood against it, even when I 
don’t agree with their substantive pol-
icy agenda, even if I don’t agree per-
haps with their strategic plan in ques-
tion, but I stand with them anyway be-
cause they are my colleagues. They are 
my friends. It is what colleagues do for 
each other. You see, the difference be-
tween a colleague and a subordinate is 
that you don’t purport to tell a col-
league what he or she can do if you 
don’t have the authority to do that. 
You don’t act offended if your col-
league doesn’t agree with you, and you 
don’t try to silence your colleague. 
That is how you treat a subordinate. 
It has happened for far too long here. 
I have been here for 91⁄2 years, and I 
have seen it under Democratic leader-
ship and I have seen it under Repub-
lican leadership. It is not how it used 
to work here. It is not how it should 
ever work. I find it revolting. It is one 
thing to say: I want to vote on this leg-
islation. It is quite another thing to 
have the gall to say: I want to vote on 
this legislation, but I don’t want any-
one else to have any say on what this 
legislation says, and I don’t care what 
this does to another State. I don’t care 
that there are other parts of other 
States in the Union, represented by my 
friends and my colleagues, where peo-
ple will suffer in this legislation. I 
don’t care—not my problem. I so don’t 
care that that is a problem for some-
body else, that I am going to make 
sure that the other person can’t care 
and that he can’t even make changes 
to this legislation. 
If I were their subordinate, perhaps I 
would understand. As their colleague, I 
don’t. This isn’t how you treat a col-
league. This isn’t how colleagues inter-
act in a body that considers itself de-
liberative and collegial. So say what 
they want about this being bipartisan, 
about there having been a collegial 
process about this bill’s creation—let 
them say what they want about that. 
Make no mistake. This is wrong, what 
they are doing. I am not even talking 
right now about the merits of the bill. 
I disagree with the bill. I don’t like the 
substantive policy end that it seeks to 
achieve, but I am not talking about 
that right now. What I am saying is 
wrong and even outrageous is the gall, 
the temerity that they have to tell col-
leagues that they don’t have an equal 
seat at this table, that their election 
certificate somehow matters less.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2920 
June 11, 2020 
Sooner or later, I believe that our 
best days lie ahead of us. I am an opti-
mist at heart. Optimism is something 
that is hard to have at a moment like 
this, when you have been completely 
shut out of a legislative debate. But 
the reason I am optimistic here has to 
do with a very simple reality. Sooner 
or later, in a system like this one, 
Members will find a way with the sys-
tem of rules of the Senate and as au-
thorized by the rules and procedures 
and traditions of the Senate. They will 
find a way to get around it, and I think 
you will see a growing dynamic in 
which Members will reach across the 
aisle in order to solve this very prob-
lem. 
This problem is not a Republican 
problem distinctively. It is not a 
Democratic problem distinctively. We 
have seen it under the leadership of 
both parties, regardless of who has the 
majority. This is a problem that Sen-
ators have among and between them-
selves, and I think in time you will see 
more and more Members coming to 
each other’s defense, regardless of po-
litical ideology and regardless of the 
substantive ends that we achieve in a 
piece of legislation. I think the sun is 
setting or at least preparing to set on 
the days of locking out individual 
Members from the amendment process. 
It isn’t right, and deep down we know 
it is not. 
I will note that other than the Pre-
siding Officer, at 4:53 p.m. on a Thurs-
day, I remain the only Member of the 
U.S. Senate within this Chamber—just 
the Presiding Officer and me. That is 
it. 
We could be voting now. We could 
have started voting hours ago. We 
could have started voting yesterday. 
We could have voted on all of these 
amendments. For all I know, all of the 
amendments that I am proposing could 
have been considered and voted down 
and they would have had their way. So 
what difference would it make? I am 
not certain whether they would all fail. 
It is not up to me for all to fail. Third-
ly, even if they did all fail—every last 
one of them—at least then Members of 
this body would be able to face their 
constituents at the end of that process 
and be able to say: Look, I liked this 
legislation. Even though it had these 
problems, the reasons to support it 
outweighed those for opposing it. 
Or they would be able to say: Look, I 
tried to make it better. I failed. These 
problems remained. So I voted against 
it. 
That increases accountability, rather 
than decreasing. That is good. That is 
good for a constitutional republic like 
ours. It is essential for the U.S. Senate. 
It is how it is supposed to work. 
So we could have done that yester-
day. We could have done that this 
morning. We could still do it right now. 
We could start that process right now 
in a matter of hours. We would have 
debated, discussed, and voted on these 
amendments. Then we could move on. 
We could put this whole thing behind 
us. We could do it right now. 
They are hearing nothing of it, which 
begs the question: Why? Who benefits 
from this? The only people who benefit 
are the small handful of individuals 
who, on any particular occasion, hap-
pen to be involved in this decision 
making and become more powerful. 
But they do so in a dishonorable way, 
at the expense of all of their col-
leagues, at the expense of their rela-
tionship with their colleagues, but 
most damning of all, at the expense of 
their relationship and obligations to 
the voters who elected them—and I 
mean those in every State. 
I am sure they think they are doing 
the right thing, that the end justifies 
the means. Nobody is immune to that 
line of thinking. It is something we 
have to be conscious of. The cir-
cumstance doesn’t make it OK. This is 
wrong. We can do better. We can, we 
must, and together, we will. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, we 
have a lot of problems in America 
today—a pandemic, a recession, a surge 
of violence in our major cities drown-
ing out a nationwide call for justice 
and hope. We have work to do in this 
body and this city to solve these prob-
lems and to heed that call. 
Our voters sent us here to make 
things better, to rebuild, to heal, but 
that is not what we are doing. No, for 
the last several weeks, my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle and their 
allies in the media and some profes-
sional political activists on a payroll 
have been trying to divide us against 
each other, to paralyze us, to stoke re-
sentment of our fellow citizens and ha-
tred of this Nation that we call home. 
It is really remarkable, if you think 
about it. Just a few short weeks ago, 
we were united in outrage at the mur-
der of George Floyd. We were united in 
impatience for justice for his family. 
And nothing has changed about that. 
All people of good will still want jus-
tice to be done. I do. But the call of the 
marchers has been weaponized by par-
tisans who want nothing more than to 
say that only some Americans really 
support equal justice under the law; 
only some institutions of government 
are really committed to that cause; 
only one party can be trusted to govern 
in good faith; only one political coali-
tion is righteous enough to rule over 
the other. 
You don’t hear talk of unity when 
watching MSNBC or reading the New 
York Times these days. Instead, those 
outlets are drawing up a new list of vil-
lains—not Floyd’s killer. No, not him. 
We are way past George Floyd now, I 
guess. No, we are talking about new 
grievances, structural evils endemic to 
America itself—the police, the mili-
tary, the flag, oh, and of course the 
President. It is always about the Presi-
dent. 
Actually, what it is really about is 
the President’s voters. It is about the 
people who elected him. It is about the 
red States, like mine. It is about the 
people who live there. The elite media, 
the woke mob—they don’t like these 
people, and they want the rest of 
America to dislike them too. This is 
why they are telling us that it wasn’t 
a homicidal cop who killed George 
Floyd. No, his death now is the product 
of systemic racism, we are told, and 
anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their 
role in his death, anyone who doesn’t 
bend their knee to this extreme ide-
ology, is complicit in violence. 
It is not enough, apparently, to bring 
Derrick Chauvin to justice for his 
crimes. No, now we have to defund all 
the police. There is no scab they will 
not pick at, no divide they will not ex-
ploit, no controversy they will not gin 
up to make us hate each other. Well, 
we cannot take their bait. 
In the last weeks, we have seen a pro-
fessor put on leave for quoting the 
words of Martin Luther King, Jr. Not 
woke enough. We have seen the New 
York Times fire its opinion page editor 
for daring to publish the words of a Re-
publican Senator. He forgot the party 
line. We have seen a literal insurrec-
tion in the streets of Seattle, a break-
away Antifa enclave ruled by a self-de-
scribed warlord—you cannot make this 
stuff up—lauded now, in some quarters 
at least, as an experiment in post-po-
lice governance. 
We have had a bill introduced in the 
House to bring that experiment in 
chaos to our cities and towns all across 
the country and to demonize the fine 
men and women who put their lives on 
the line day and night to protect pro-
testers’ rights to demand justice. 
The madness is accelerating this 
month, but the radical left has been at 
this for a while. 
The New York Times won a Pulitzer 
Prize for the 1619 Project—a propa-
ganda campaign designed to recast 
America’s founding as an evil event 
and American democracy as a system 
of violent racial oppression. It won 
that prize despite wide criticism by 
historians who objected to its histor-
ical revisionism. 
Now, with the Pulitzer’s seal of ap-
proval, the Times is developing a 1619 
grade school curriculum so that our 
children will be indoctrinated to hate 
this country at taxpayer expense. They 
want to do to our public schools what 
they have already done to the univer-
sities. 
What does any of this have to do with 
healing our Nation? What does it have 
to do with bringing about that more 
perfect union, whose achievement is 
our shared ambition and shared obliga-
tion as Americans? The answer is, 
nothing. And that is the point. 
As has been widely reported, this 
week one of my Senate colleagues in-
troduced a measure to strip all mili-
tary installations and bases in this 
country of reference to Confederate 
soldiers or Confederate history. And for 
what purpose? To achieve justice for

June 11, 2020 
George Floyd? To bring our Nation to-
gether? No, I don’t think so. The pur-
pose was to erase from history—erase 
every person and name and event not 
righteous enough—and to cast those 
who would object as defenders of the 
cause of slavery, to reenact in our cur-
rent politics that Civil War that tore 
brother from brother and divided this 
Nation against itself. 
You would think, the way some in 
the media talk about this country, 
that they are sad we are still not fight-
ing the Civil War. They would like us 
to fight a new civil war in our culture 
day and night, without end. 
I would suggest to my colleagues 
that the Civil War not only gave us vil-
lains, it also gave us heroes and a more 
perfect union to love. Maybe we should 
learn from those heroes. 
We should learn from Lincoln, who 
called our Nation to unity at Gettys-
burg. ‘‘It is for the living,’’ he told us, 
‘‘to be dedicated here to the unfinished 
work which they who fought here have 
thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather 
for us to be here dedicated to the great 
task remaining before us—that from 
these honored dead we take increased 
devotion to that cause for which they 
here gave the last full measure of devo-
tion—that we here highly resolve that 
these dead shall not have died in vain— 
that this nation shall have a new birth 
of freedom and that the government of 
the people, by the people, and for the 
people, shall not perish from the 
earth.’’ 
If you visit Gettysburg, you will find 
monuments to the dead of free States 
and slave States alike, and you will see 
children who are brought there by 
their parents after long car drives from 
their homes, drawn in by these old 
symbols and memorials to the lessons 
those teach about our Nation’s new 
birth of freedom. 
The Americans who visit these hal-
lowed grounds all across our country 
want to know why this Nation fought a 
war against itself, why brothers could 
not live under one flag together. We 
teach them there in those places how 
we became a better nation through the 
crucible of that terrible war, and we 
teach them there to be proud that we 
did so. 
That hard-fought pride in the shared 
struggle that unites us is now fading. 
That story is being erased. A nation 
united in the cause of justice is divid-
ing, and we are increasingly at war 
with ourselves. This cannot continue. 
This great Nation and its good people 
cannot continue our life of freedom to-
gether if we vilify and destroy each 
other from within. 
Now, before we vote on this floor on 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, I will offer an amendment to undo 
this effort at historical revisionism. I 
will offer it not to celebrate the cause 
of the Confederacy but to embrace the 
cause of union—our union, shared to-
gether as Americans. 
It is time for our leaders to stop 
using their position here to divide us. 
Let us work together instead to build 
on the history and the responsibility 
that we share as Americans to con-
tinue that unfinished work of this Na-
tion that we call home. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I just

TO 
PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND

Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 467, S. Res. 454. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 454) calling for the 
immediate release of Cuban democracy ac-
tivist Jose Daniel Ferrer and commending 
the efforts of Jose Daniel Ferrer to promote 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in 
Cuba. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic and with an amend-
ment to the preamble to strike the pre-
amble and insert the part printed in 
italic, as follows: 
Whereas Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcı´a is a Cuban 
democracy and human rights activist who has 
dedicated his life to promoting greater political 
pluralism and respect for fundamental freedoms 
in Cuba; 
Whereas Mr. Ferrer was born in Cuba on July 
29, 1970, in the province of Santiago de Cuba; 
Whereas, in the late 1990s, Mr. Ferrer joined 
the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), a 
peaceful political movement led by late Cuban 
activist Oswaldo Paya; 
Whereas, through coordination with the MCL, 
Mr. Ferrer helped lead the Varela Project, an 
initiative to collect the signatures of citizens to 
petition the Government of Cuba for democratic 
reforms and protections for freedom of speech, 
freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly; 
Whereas, in March 2003, as part of a series of 
sweeping arrests of 75 democracy activists, Mr. 
Ferrer was arrested by Cuban authorities for his 
work on the Varela Project and sentenced to 25 
years in prison; 
Whereas, in March 2004, Amnesty Inter-
national declared the group of 75 democracy ac-
tivists, including Mr. Ferrer, to be prisoners of 
conscience and called for their immediate and 
unconditional release; 
Whereas, in 2009, Mr. Ferrer was honored 
with the Democracy Award given annually by 
the National Endowment for Democracy; 
Whereas, in March 2011, as part of an agree-
ment brokered by the Catholic Church, Mr. 
Ferrer refused to abandon his homeland and 
was released from prison to remain in Cuba; 
Whereas, in August 2011, Mr. Ferrer founded 
the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), a non-
violent political movement dedicated to pro-
moting human rights, democratic principles, and 
fundamental freedoms in Cuba; 
Whereas, on June 7, 2012, Mr. Ferrer testified 
via digital video conference at a hearing of the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; 
Whereas, since he was released from jail in 
March 2011, Mr. Ferrer has been frequently har-
assed, regularly surveilled, and repeatedly jailed 
by Cuban authorities for his role in UNPACU; 
Whereas, on October 1, 2019, Mr. Ferrer was 
imprisoned arbitrarily by Cuban authorities for 
his leadership of UNPACU and outspoken advo-
cacy for human rights and democratic principles 
in Cuba; 
Whereas, on October 1, 2019, Cuban authori-
ties detained 3 other members of UNPACU, Fer-
nando Gonza´lez Vailant, Jose´ Pupo Chaveco, 
and Roilan Zarraga Ferrer; 
Whereas the family of Mr. Ferrer was per-
mitted to visit him only twice while he was im-
prisoned arbitrarily, and the wife of Mr. Ferrer 
reported that she saw evidence that he had been 
physically abused and mistreated; 
Whereas, on April 3, 2020, Mr. Ferrer was ar-
bitrarily convicted and sentenced to 4 years and 
6 months of house arrest for the purported 
crimes of ‘‘injuries’’ and ‘‘privation of liberty’’; 
Whereas, on April 3, 2020, Mr. Gonza´lez 
Vailant, Mr. Pupo Chaveco, and Mr. Zarraga 
Ferrer 
were 
also 
arbitrarily 
convicted 
to 
multiyear sentences of house arrest; and 
Whereas, since he was placed under house ar-
rest, Mr. Ferrer has informed international 
media outlets that during his time in prison he 
was subjected to ‘‘torture’’ and ‘‘constant hu-
miliation’’, and denied access to food and med-
ical treatment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the arbitrary conviction, sen-
tencing, and imprisonment of leading Cuban de-
mocracy and human rights activist Jose´ Daniel 
Ferrer and calls for his immediate and uncondi-
tional release; 
(2) calls for the immediate and unconditional 
release of all members of the Patriotic Union of 
Cuba (UNPACU) that have been arbitrarily im-
prisoned; 
(3) commends Mr. Ferrer for his unwavering 
commitment to advance democratic principles, 
human rights, and fundamental freedoms in 
Cuba; and 
(4) recognizes the important contributions of 
UNPACU and all of its members for their efforts 
to promote greater respect for democratic prin-
ciples, human rights, and fundamental freedoms 
in Cuba. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the com-
mittee-reported substitute amendment 
to the resolution be agreed to; the reso-
lution, as amended, be agreed to; the 
committee-reported amendment to the 
preamble be agreed to; the preamble, 
as amended, be agreed to; and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
The resolution (S. Res. 454), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble was agreed to.

TAXPAYER FIRST ACT OF 2019— 
Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today because I am concerned about 
the Great American Outdoors Act in 
its current form. It spends billions on 
places where Americans vacation but 
absolutely 
nothing 
protecting 
the 
areas where 42 percent of Americans 
live, which are the parishes and coun-
ties on coastlines. Of course these par-
ishes and counties are in coastal 
States, and 85 percent of Americans 
live in coastal States. 
To repeat, the Great American Out-
doors Act mandates spending billions 
on the outdoors where Americans vaca-
tion but does absolutely nothing to 
protect the outdoors where Americans 
live. 
Tonight, I will speak to why that is a 
problem for coastal States like my 
State of Louisiana and how one amend-
ment, the coastal amendment, address-
es this disparity. 
These 
are 
uncertain 
times. 
Coronavirus continues to kill. Our 
country struggles to confront and ad-
dress the issues raised by the George 
Floyd killing. Hindsight is 20/20, but we 
wish that we had stockpiled more per-
sonal protective equipment. We wish 
Minneapolis had instituted police re-
forms. If wise action had addressed 
these issues before, then these issues 
might be better now. 
It highlights the need for wise public 
policy—looking beyond the immediate 
and thinking about that which may 
occur. On the other hand, there are 
some things that occur that we know 
are going to happen because they hap-
pened before, so 20/20 hindsight is not 
needed. Coastal flooding is an example. 
Hurricanes happen regularly. Sea lev-
els are rising. There will be more coast-
al flooding, more pictures of families 
on life rafts, the Cajun Navy in small 
boats doing rescues, the Coast Guard

and helicopters pulling Americans up 
in harnesses. We know this will happen 
again. We actually have the oppor-
tunity to proactively address it. 
When the basics of the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act were being consid-
ered in committee, there was another 
bill passed to address coastal issues. 
The authors of the Great American 
Outdoors Act don’t live in coastal 
States, or if they do, their States ben-
efit greatly from the Great American 
Outdoors Act legislation. But that 
leaves the rest of us wondering, is it 
right to care more about parks than 
about people? Because that seems to be 
the priority the Senate is going on. 
Let’s establish context. The Senate is 
nearing a vote on the Great American 
Outdoors Act. The bill dedicates bil-
lions in funding for deferred mainte-
nance, mostly in national parks where 
Americans vacation and predominantly 
in seven States. It also puts an addi-
tional $900 million in the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, which is 
used to buy more land for the Federal 
Government, principally in Western 
States. 
I have no problem with the idea be-
hind the bill. National parks are na-
tional treasures. Americans flock to 
them to learn about history and to ex-
perience the natural majesty of our 
great country. I know some of the floor 
speeches extolling this bill have shown 
grizzly bears and mountains and pine 
trees and such like that. I am with it. 
I love them. I think they are beautiful. 
But I do take issue with how the bill 
ignores the environmental needs of 
coastal States in favor of fixing broken 
toilets and leaky roofs, because I can 
show the needs of coastal States, not in 
terms of grizzly bears and pine trees 
and majestic mountains but in terms of 
people being flooded out of their homes 
because of the lack of investment in 
coastal resiliency. 
As a pictorial of where the money is 
spent from the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, the blue States, most-
ly inland—they have West Virginia 
kind of poking out there, but it is not 
a coastal State—the coastal States ac-
tually don’t do very well at all, do 
they. Even though this is where 85 per-
cent of the American people live—the 
coastal States—we can see that the re-
maining 15 percent live in States that 
get the bulk of the funding. 
Coastal per capita spending in the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund is 
$7.53, but if you look at what inland 
States receive, it is $17.66 on a per cap-
ita basis. There is a lot of benefit in 
living here if you are putting more 
money into the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, but if you live on a 
coastline threatened by flooding, the 
benefit is not there, and that is my 
concern with this bill. 
Again, let’s establish these facts: 42 
percent of the population lives in par-
ishes and counties directly on a coast-
line; 82 percent live in coastal States. 
These figures—$17.66 spent on the in-
land and $7.53 spent on the coastal— 
show a stark disconnect between pro-
tecting Americans from flooding where 
they live, work, and help others earn a 
living and spending money to fix up the 
parks where they occasionally visit. 
To repeat, more money is being spent 
on places where people vacation, not 
protecting where they live. 
That is the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund aspects of it. Let’s talk 
about the parks with the deferred 
maintenance. 
These are the seven States that do 
pretty well. They do fantastic. Sixty 
percent, roughly, of the money will go 
to these—including Washington, DC— 
these States that are highlighted; ev-
eryone else, not so much. In fact, if you 
are in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, 
only 0.2 percent of the Nation’s de-
ferred maintenance is in those States. 
So out of the billions being spent in 
this program, 0.2 percent will go to 
those 
States 
collectively. 
Clearly, 
there are winners and losers. 
I spoke of Nebraska, Iowa, and Kan-
sas. Other States also get far less. The 
coastal States of Georgia, South Caro-
lina, 
Connecticut, 
New 
Hampshire, 
Minnesota, Delaware, Maine, and other 
coastal States do very poorly. 
Midwestern States like Kansas, Iowa, 
and Nebraska I have already men-
tioned, and why is this important? 
Well, I will mention it again in a little 
bit, but I have been to some of those 
coastlines. They are kind of going 
away too. If you go to a barrier island 
in Georgia, they are having to build 
seawalls because the waves are now 
crashing on beautiful homes, threat-
ening to wash them away into the sea. 
beautiful homes, threatening to wash 
them away into the sea. 
We should be spending money not 
just on parks but also where people 
live. That would be wise public policy. 
All the coastal States I just men-
tioned, including those which do re-
ceive disproportionate benefit from the 
Great American Outdoors Act, would 
also benefit, as would the Gulf Coast 
States, if we invest collectively as a 
nation in coastal resiliency. The reason 
this is so important—failure to invest 
in coastal resiliency costs lives, costs 
communities, 
costs 
taxpayers, 
and 
costs us a lot. Land lost due to rising 
sea levels and other factors threaten 
the safety of the 42 percent of Ameri-
cans who live in a county or parish di-
rectly on a coastline. 
We know that if you invest in coastal 
resiliency and flood protection on the 
front end, you can save billions on the 
back end protecting against the next 
hurricane or flood event. 
Again, we are spending billions on 
parks we occasionally visit, but there 
is nothing in this bill on where we live, 
raise families, and make our liveli-
hoods. 
Perhaps the greatest irony is how the 
Great American Outdoors Act is fund-
ed. The bill takes up to $1.9 billion a 
year in revenue generated from energy 
production principally from the Gulf of 
Mexico to spend it on the deferred 
maintenance, 
again, 
principally 
in 
seven States that I just pointed out. 
Ninety percent of that revenue is from 
the Gulf of Mexico. So the State—my 
State, for example—that produces the 
energy with the resources that dis-
proportionately 
fund 
programs 
in 
parks where people occasionally visit 
is 
the 
one 
which 
has 
its 
needs 
unaddressed. 
In my State of Louisiana, this is par-
ticularly troublesome. We are the hard-
est hit State in the Nation by land 
loss, so much so that if nothing is done, 
the energy infrastructure that comes 
off of the coast of Louisiana to support 
the oil and gas development that sup-
plies the revenue for the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act—that energy infra-
structure will be threatened, which 
means that the goose laying the golden 
egg dies, along with my working coast 
and the communities of the people who 
live there. 
If it seems like I am passionate about 
this, by golly, I am. By golly, why do 
people care more about parks than 
they do about people? That just dis-
turbs me. 
But it isn’t just the energy infra-
structure lost; it will be lives and live-
lihoods, communities and community— 
again, by the way, costing taxpayers a 
lot of money. 
Let’s have some examples of this. 
Hurricane Katrina. Federal taxpayers 
had to pay $125 billion in Louisiana, 
Mississippi, and other parts of the gulf 
coast for recovery; Hurricane Harvey, 
$125 billion in Texas and Louisiana; 
Hurricane Maria, $90 billion in Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; Hur-
ricane Sandy, $65 billion in the Mid-At-
lantic—New York, New Jersey; Hurri-
cane Irma, $50 billion in Florida; Hurri-
cane Ike, $30 billion in Louisiana and 
Texas. I could mention Rita. I could 
mention many others that have cost 
the Federal taxpayers billions in order 
to help States recover. 
The combined cost of hurricane dam-
age from every storm since 1990 is near-
ly $685 billion. Not all of this damage 
could have been avoided. It is clear 
that it couldn’t have been. But a lot 
could have been. If the marshes south 
of New Orleans had not been allowed to 
erode away, they would have instead 
eroded the power of Katrina, decreas-
ing its force when it hit New Orleans, 
perhaps preserving those levies. If we 
put money up beforehand, it saves us 
so much on the back end. 
The coastal amendment does not ask 
for billions. I feel like it should, but I 
know I couldn’t get it. I am only ask-
ing that some money in this bill be in-
cluded for coastal resiliency. I will say 
it once more: If we are spending bil-
lions 
on 
where 
people 
vacation, 
shouldn’t we spend something on resil-
iency for the parishes and counties 
where 42 percent of Americans live? 
Should we care more about parks than 
we do about people? 
These numbers I just went through— 
they are not just numbers; they rep-
resent people. I see their pictures. I see

the lives lost. I see the communities 
completely upended, taking years to 
recover—and by the way, communities 
that are vitally important not just to 
themselves but to the entirety of the 
United States. 
Ocean and coastal communities, in-
cluding the Great Lakes, account for 82 
percent of the U.S. population and 
economy. NOAA reports that the ocean 
economy contributes 2.3 percent of the 
Nation’s employment, 1.6 percent of 
GDP, 3 million jobs, 154,000 businesses, 
$129 billion in wages, and $304 billion in 
goods and services. These jobs are 
threatened when sea levels rise and 
erosion and flooding occur. Their con-
tribution to our economy is threat-
ened. 
By the way, I mentioned that energy 
production is threatened, and if we 
cannot produce energy, there is no 
funding 
mechanism 
for 
the 
Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
We are spending money where people 
vacation, not where they live and 
work. 
I will just use my own State as a case 
in point of the need for coastal resil-
iency. 
Will you look at that map? This is a 
reasonable scenario of what will hap-
pen to Louisiana if there is no invest-
ment in coastal resiliency. The red is 
the land that is lost. 
This is New Orleans. It effectively be-
comes an island protected by levees, 
and all of this is lost. Oh, well. That is 
Louisiana. It may not matter. Second 
most productive fisheries—in fact, the 
most productive fisheries in the lower 
48; Alaska beats us—but in the lower 
48, the most productive fisheries. Port 
systems that are throughout here sup-
port the economy of all of the inland 
waterways. These commodities that 
flow around the world at a competitive 
price advantage because of our fish and 
port system—threatened because of the 
absence of sustainability. And I could 
go on. 
We are losing roughly—by the time I 
finish talking, Louisiana will lose 
roughly a football field worth of land. 
Goggle Maps can’t even keep up—it 
will show you land, and it is open 
water. So if you have ever gone fishing 
in the gulf, you are watching your lit-
tle radar right there, and you think 
you are about to hit something, and it 
is just open. That land has melted 
away, and the maps can’t keep up. 
So what is at risk? Oil and gas pro-
duction. I have mentioned that. But oil 
and gas production do not do it justice. 
All of this is pipelines and energy in-
frastructure that benefit not just Lou-
isiana; it benefits the entire country. 
I am a physician. This is the way I 
look at it: If your body needs energy, 
so does our modern economy. And to 
the degree that we have oil and gas, jet 
fuel, plastics, resins, natural gas com-
ing from around the country, it prin-
cipally comes from here. To the degree 
that we support jobs by exporting 
clean-burning natural gas around the 
world to replace coal in, say, China so 
that hopefully they have fewer emis-
sions blowing over into the United 
States, it disproportionately comes 
from this gulf coast. This is what is 
sustained. This is what is at risk if we 
don’t invest in coastal resiliency—en-
ergy assets such as pipelines, refin-
eries, oil export sites, natural gas mar-
ket centers, processing facilities, lique-
fied natural gas export facilities, the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and ports 
like Port Fourchon that keep the gulf 
economy running. 
Again, the majority of this infra-
structure is based off the coast of Lou-
isiana. Without investment in flood 
protection and rebuilding barrier is-
lands, this critical part of the Amer-
ican economy—not to mention the 
funding stream for the Great American 
Outdoors Act—remains exposed and at 
risk. 
Again, these aren’t just numbers; 
these are people. There are 375,000 jobs 
directly tied to the oil and gas industry 
across the Gulf States, and it doesn’t 
include the jobs that are secondary 
there just because of the oil and gas in-
dustry stimulating demand on com-
mercial goods and services. 
But it doesn’t stop there. I men-
tioned the port structure being threat-
ened. 
By the way, somebody from Kansas, 
Iowa, or Nebraska might be saying: 
You know, I don’t do well at all in the 
Great American Outdoors Act, but how 
does what Senator CASSIDY is talking 
about help me? I don’t live on a coast-
line. 
Yes, but your commodities go around 
the world through the port system that 
is based on the gulf coast, and this 
shows it. 
After Hurricane Katrina and our port 
system in south Louisiana was so dam-
aged, this is what happened to the ex-
port of commodities from the heart-
land: Corn exports down 23 percent; 
barley, 100 percent; wheat, 54 percent; 
soy, 25 percent. Total grain exports 
were down 24 percent. Those aren’t just 
numbers; those are families who sud-
denly are struggling because they 
thought they had their budget worked 
out, and now their exports are down 100 
percent. 
That lower Louisiana, lower Mis-
sissippi port system is the reason we 
can ship our grains around the world at 
competitive prices relative to other 
countries. Without that port system, 
our farmers are at a disadvantage. 
So it isn’t just advocating for coastal 
resiliency for my State because I want 
those communities to be preserved and 
for the energy infrastructure we rely 
upon to, among other things, fund this 
bill we are about to vote on, it is also 
vital to the livelihood of these farmers 
and their families and their economy 
in these inland States. If we don’t pro-
tect that port system by investing in 
coastal resiliency, their livelihoods 
will be affected. 
Investing in coastal resiliency pro-
tects all these endeavors and prevents 
the astronomical costs associated with 
severe flooding events and hurricanes, 
and it can be done. 
I mentioned earlier about how you 
invest a little bit on the front end, and 
you can save billions on the back end. 
Terrebonne Parish recently put up a 
new flood system, and they put it up 
after a flood event in which a major 
portion of their lower parish flooded. 
They then built the flood system, and 
then they subsequently had another 
high-water event. Ten thousand homes 
that would have flooded did not flood 
because of that new flood wall. 
We invested in coastal resiliency. 
The Federal taxpayer, through the Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program, saved 
millions—hundreds of millions. More 
importantly, lives were saved and com-
munities were saved, and a vibrant 
community, with workers who go off-
shore to produce the energy that is 
funding the Great American Outdoors 
Act, was able to pick up and continue 
with their life without disruption. 
I am speaking of Louisiana; it could 
be any coastal area across the United 
States. So investing in coastal resil-
iency protects all these endeavors. 
I am not saying take any money 
away from the Great American Out-
doors Act. The coastal amendment, if 
folded in, doesn’t touch a dime of the 
billions going to the parks. All I am 
asking is to have some revenue to go to 
save the lives and the livelihoods of all 
these people, the 42 percent of Ameri-
cans who live in coastal communities. 
Instead, we spend it all on parks, pot-
holes, broken toilets, and leaky roofs. I 
have heard the argument that if you 
fix that leaky roof in time, you save 
more money down the road, and I ac-
cept that argument. I am just applying 
it to where people live. If we do some-
thing for coastal resiliency now, we 
save not just a leaky roof and not just 
a little bit of money. We save a com-
munity, we save lives, and we save lots 
of money. 
I recently spoke to 20 parish resi-
dents. As folks know, in Louisiana, we 
don’t have counties. We have parishes. 
I had another call with 100 different 
business leaders, and they just plead 
for fairness to the gulf and to coastal 
parishes and counties. And what is un-
fair, you ask? Again, if you live in a 
coastal area that generates the billions 
being spent in the Great American Out-
doors Act, you are upset to learn that 
the Senate is passing a bill spending 
more money on vacation spots than on 
protecting your homes, jobs, and envi-
ronment. 
It is not just the Louisiana coast. I 
have a friend who lives in Seal Beach, 
CA. I visited him a couple of years ago, 
and he said that water was coming up 
and flooding buildings it never had be-
fore. Well, in showing you that coastal 
resiliency investment can work, now 
Seal Beach, apparently, spends $1 mil-
lion a year building berms to protect 
from winter storms driving it in. 
So, first, coastal resiliency can work. 
But, two, sea levels are rising, and the 
beach is shrinking. It will require more

of Seal Beach to build those berms to 
protect those buildings. Now, that is 
just Seal Beach, but it does show you 
that resiliency can be effective, but it 
also shows you that it is needed. 
I also walked, as I told you before, 
along those barrier islands in Georgia, 
and I am just struck. Oh, my gosh, I 
couldn’t afford those beautiful homes. 
They had to build sea walls because the 
high tides are higher now and threat-
ening the foundations of those build-
ings. This bill invests nothing to pro-
tect the beaches and the outdoors 
where people live. 
I am told that the Army Corps of En-
gineers—this is hearsay. I think it is 
true, but I don’t know. It is a reliable 
source. The Army Corps of Engineers 
has recently proposed building a $3.5 
billion floodgate to protect the Miami 
harbor. I have also read that property 
values are declining on Miami Beach 
because as sea levels rise, the people 
who are insuring them and may be pur-
chasing are afraid that they will be in-
undated by rising sea levels. 
When I drive along the Mississippi 
gulf coast, they have homes elevated 12 
or 15 feet in the air. It is kind of a tes-
timony to the threat that our new en-
vironment poses to those who live on 
the beach. It kind of reminds me of a 
picture I saw of Venice, Italy, where 
they used to have shops on the ground 
floor, but now the ground floors are 
empty because sea level has risen and 
flooding has extended. So now there is 
such regularity of flooding that Venice 
no longer uses the ground floor. 
Now, we are not Venice in our coun-
try. We are not built in the middle of a 
marsh, but we are built and 42 percent 
of us live in a coastal parish. This is a 
threat. It does not take 20/20 hindsight. 
We can see that this is going to hap-
pen. We already hear the Army Corps 
of Engineers planning for this. We see 
property values declining. We see flood 
walls being built, and we scratch our 
chin and know that ultimately it will 
not be enough. 
The Senate could be investing in that 
coastal resiliency, not just, to say, in 
my State of Louisiana, where we are 
actually generating the funds that 
would be used for the Great American 
Outdoors Act, but, no, we are not. We 
are fixing potholes and parks where 
people visit but not investing in coast-
al resiliency where they live. 
What does the coastal amendment 
do? Because I do think this could fix 
this. Again, there are nationwide bene-
fits. Let me repeat. It doesn’t take a 
dime away from the Great American 
Outdoors Act. There will still be the 
billions going for the parks. But what 
this does do is it sends money to spend 
on coastal resiliency where people live. 
It ensures the stability of the port sys-
tem in the Lower Mississippi and down 
in the Texas gulf coast to help Amer-
ica’s farmers export. It helps treat the 
Gulf States fairly, which really dis-
proportionately do not benefit from 
these two acts that they are funding. 
Everybody wins. 
Indeed, if you are a State like Cali-
fornia or North Carolina that does real-
ly well under the Great American Out-
doors Act, you also get money for your 
coastline. We are not being prejudicial. 
We are just trying to do something to 
help create coastal resiliency in the 
parishes and counties where 42 percent 
of American people live, as opposed to 
not spending a dime to help protect it. 
Now, I said at the beginning of this 
speech about the coastal amendment— 
I just went over it—how does it func-
tionally work? This amendment re-
moves the cap on the amount of money 
Gulf States receive from energy pro-
duction on the Outer Continental Shelf 
and makes more leases eligible for the 
Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, 
or, as it is known, GOMESA, which 
thereby generates more money for a 
State like Louisiana. 
Simultaneously, by raising this cap, 
it puts more money into the current 
fund for the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. But, under the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund is getting an addi-
tional $900 million a year in perpetuity 
automatically, and Congress has no 
role over it after this bill passes. Any 
dollars that would additionally go to 
LWCF, above the $125 million it cur-
rently receives, would instead flow into 
a coastal fund, and that is the coastal 
fund that would help resiliency in all of 
our coastal States. 
Now, I can’t say how other States 
would spend it, but in Louisiana, our 
State constitution requires that if we 
get money from GOMESA, from the 
revenue sharing, that we in Louisiana 
dedicate these funds to turning the tide 
against land loss to preserve our won-
derful and ecologically diverse wet-
lands, which also blunts the effects of 
hurricanes. 
Now some might say: Why should 
anybody get this? It is Federal land. 
Well, I will point out that there is ac-
tually a cap on the amount of revenue 
the Gulf States receive from oil and 
gas revenue and from oil and gas pro-
duction in the Federal lands off our 
coast, which limits the amount we can 
receive. There is no such limit in any 
other State. 
If you are in a Federal land in New 
Mexico, you get 50 percent of the total 
generated. I think I read last year that 
New Mexico got $1.5 billion from shared 
royalty leases on Federal lands within 
New Mexico. I think Louisiana got $95 
million. Wait—$1.5 billion and $95 mil-
lion. We got a coast; they don’t. We got 
people; they don’t. We are funding 90 
percent of the Great American Out-
doors Act; they are funding a fraction. 
Now you know why my parish resi-
dents feel anger that the needs of our 
vanishing coastline are totally ignored, 
and not just ours but those of every 
coastal parish—those coastal parishes 
in which 42 percent of Americans live 
and who are wondering: Do we care 
more about parks than we do about 
people? 
We 
can 
care 
about 
parks, 
but 
shouldn’t we also care about people? 
Now, the coastal amendment, if 
added to the base bill, I can say, would 
pass with bipartisan support. I will say 
once more: It does not take any money 
away from the billions going to public 
parks in the Great American Outdoors 
Act. It doesn’t take any money away 
from buying more lands out in the 
Western States. What I am trying to do 
is to bring fairness and equity into this 
equation by directing dollars to all 
coastal States, including the Great 
Lakes States. Senators from both sides 
of this aisle represent States which 
would benefit. It doesn’t matter wheth-
er you are from a coastal State. You 
would recognize that it is wise public 
policy. 
I suggested inserting the coastal 
amendment into the Great American 
Outdoors Act, into the base bill. The 
COASTAL Act was originally written 
with DOUG JONES, the Senator from 
Alabama, and had bipartisan support in 
the Energy Committee from Senator 
ANGUS KING from Maine. 
Since, the coastal amendment has 
been modified. My Democratic col-
league, SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, who is 
from Rhode Island—a State greatly 
threatened by rising sea levels—sug-
gested that we create revenue sharing 
for wind energy. As we look forward 
into the next economy, we see that off-
shore wind will be a significant source 
of electricity for States like his, in 
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and other 
New England States. So we would use 
revenue sharing from offshore wind en-
ergy to also contribute to coastal resil-
iency. 
Now, that still is a little ways off. At 
first, it would principally be additional 
dollars coming from the Gulf Coast, 
but ultimately it would be the north 
and the south combining to benefit all 
coastal States, whether they were in 
the Northeast or in the South. Wher-
ever you live on a coastline, including 
the Great Lakes, it would benefit from 
inserting the COASTAL Act into the 
great American Outdoors Act. 
All I can say is, I would like to think 
that Senators—Republicans and Demo-
crats alike—can see what is at risk: 
lives, jobs, and energy production. In 
funding for the Great American Out-
doors Act, if you don’t give a twit 
about the coastal areas, at least you 
are concerned about the funding for the 
act. Again, if we only invest where peo-
ple vacation instead of investing in 
coastal resiliency, we do a disservice to 
the States, in those coastal States is 
where over 80 percent of Americans 
live. 
Now, by the way, we can have com-
mon ground on issues of the environ-
ment. Earlier today, one of the Great 
American Outdoors Act authors, Sen-
ator GARDNER from Colorado, addressed 
this Chamber to say that his bill is 
smart conservation. Let me say that 
two of my best friends here are Senator 
GARDNER and Senator DAINES, and we 
are on the other side of this issue. But 
if you are from their State, my gosh, 
you just better give them a real shout-

out, because they have done a good job 
for your State. I don’t feel good about 
the job for my State of Louisiana, but, 
you, by golly, better feel good about 
the job they have done for your State. 
I would add that I think that Senator 
GARDNER’s bill and my amendment 
work together on important issues of 
conservation and environment. I am 
told that 800 environmental groups 
support the Great American Outdoors 
Act as is and don’t want any changes. 
I find that hard to believe. Is there 
really an environmental group out 
there that doesn’t want to invest in 
coastal resiliency, that hasn’t looked 
at the devastation of Katrina, of Rita, 
of Ike, of Maria, of Irma, and doesn’t 
recognize that taking care of the envi-
ronment is essential to our coastal re-
gions? I am sure that if you poll those 
800 groups and say we are going to 
spend additional dollars on those coast-
al parishes where Americans live, they 
would stand up and applaud. And if we 
put it in there, they will support this 
bill. 
Now, I will say the GOMESA States 
is an irony here. They are often at odds 
with these environmental groups be-
cause the environmental groups claim 
that GOMESA incentivizes drilling or 
that we are spending money in a rev-
enue sharing program funded by oil and 
gas, but, needless to say, that argu-
ment is out of the window. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
has the exact same funding source as 
GOMESA, and it is supported by all the 
anti-fossil fuel environmental groups 
because they want to take care of 
parks. Well, I want to take care of peo-
ple, and I also want to take care of 
your parks, but my first priority is 
that working family. My first priority 
is that family which wakes up every 
day and struggles to make ends meet 
and wants their child to have a better 
future than they, but then they learn 
there is high water coming and they 
might be flooded and that better future 
is flooded away. I care about that fam-
ily. We, in the Senate, should care 
about that family. We should not care 
for parks more than we care for people. 
The coastal amendment supports the 
environment. As I said earlier, it goes 
directly to coastal resiliency initia-
tives that include recovering lost land 
and supporting the wetlands. I am not 
at odds with environmentalists. As I 
said before, every environmentalist is 
going to support restoring the wetlands 
of Louisiana. I am just asking that we 
be allowed to support that coastal en-
vironment. For people who live along 
the coast, these coastal systems are 
the ecosystems that make our homes 
special. It is why I look at those 
marshes in Louisiana, and, to me, they 
are just as beautiful as that grizzly 
bear and that pine tree and that majes-
tic mountain. It is all part of God’s cre-
ation, if we don’t let it wash away. 
This is more than potholes. It is more 
than leaky toilets and leaky roofs. It is 
about preservation and about it not 
being here in 50 years if we do not act 
now. We spend billions on the environ-
ment where people vacation but not 
anything on the environment where 
they live. 
So here is where we are in this de-
bate. We have established that over 80 
percent of our fellow Americans live in 
coastal States and stand to benefit 
very little from the Great American 
Outdoors Act. Oh, yes, if you live in 
the beach of North Carolina, you are 
kind of glad that the people in the 
Rocky Mountains and the Smoky Na-
tional Parks have a little bit more 
tourism, but your home is the one 
being washed away. And if you are in 
Seal Beach and your taxes are going up 
because they have to build a bigger and 
bigger berm every year because the 
winter storms are that much worse, or 
you are kind of glad in Yosemite—I am 
glad Yosemite is getting money, by the 
way. I love Yosemite. But on the other 
hand, it doesn’t help you with your 
taxes. It doesn’t help you with your 
building getting flooded. You begin to 
wonder, if you see a picture of Venice, 
is that what your home will look like 
in 25 years—a major investment of 
your life getting flooded so regularly 
that it loses all its value. Apparently, 
that is what they are looking at in 
Miami. That is what we hear in this de-
bate. 
We have established that most of the 
country that lives in coastal States 
stands to benefit very little from the 
Great American Outdoors Act. We have 
established that failing to invest in 
coastal resiliency leads to death— 
death. Think about Hurricane Katrina. 
It threatens millions of jobs and bil-
lions of economic activity. We have es-
tablished that both the coastal amend-
ment and the Great American Outdoors 
Act help the environment. They really 
do. We have established that that one 
amendment, the coastal amendment, 
added to the Great American Outdoors 
Act can address funding and equity— 
stop. Here we have billions for the 
Great American Outdoors Act and here 
will be a few million. So there isn’t any 
semblance of equality between the 
funding that I am proposing for coastal 
resiliency where 42 percent of Ameri-
cans live and the billions going to the 
parks that we visit occasionally, but at 
least there is some money going for 
coastal resiliency where most Ameri-
cans live. 
From where I am standing, including 
the coastal amendment in the Great 
American Outdoors Act is a win-win. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
passes with funding to address the 
needs of national parks and funding for 
coastal resiliency. It has bipartisan 
support. Democrats and Republicans 
can come together on it. The cause is 
just. If you just think about that fam-
ily, the cause is just. The support is 
there, but the ability to vote on it is 
not. 
The bill’s authors will not allow this 
amendment to come to the floor in-
cluded in their package. This is a dis-
service to the 82 percent of the country 
who live in coastal States and face the 
threats of hurricanes and flooding. I 
am asking that the Senate do what the 
Founders envisioned us doing. Consider 
ideas, vote on them, try and expand 
ourselves beyond our narrow parochial 
interest, and think about all Ameri-
cans, not just those Americans that 
live in your State. Put people before 
parks. 
That is not to say, with 20/20 hind-
sight, we know we should have invested 
in coastal resiliency because look at 
the pricetag of not doing so, because 
we have already seen that pricetag. In-
stead, let’s think, going forward, that 
we are going to make the investment 
now because we see that investing can 
save millions—if not billions—of dol-
lars, and I only speak of dollars. I 
should speak only of lives because 
sometimes I just think we take lives 
for granted. I don’t. We should invest 
in coastal resiliency most of all to pro-
tect those lives, those families, and 
those futures. 
I hope that we will include this. I 
hope the idea will be considered. It is 
germane. It is bipartisan. It will pass. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
this evening about something very im-
portant to me and those whom I rep-
resent. We know the gulf coast is pay-
ing for the bill, and it is not getting a 
fair share. All I am asking is that we 
amend the underlying bill to spend 
money now on resiliency projects so we 
don’t spend billions later on flood and 
storm recovery and perhaps thousands 
on funerals. 
It deserves a vote. It would pass. It 
protects so many lives and takes noth-
ing away from the Great American 
Outdoors Act, but it does establish that 
we in the Senate care about people and 
parks and that we not just care about 
where we vacation but we wish to pro-
tect where we live. I encourage my col-
leagues to consider what I have said to-
night. 
If you have heard this by other 
means, contact your Senator. Ask 
them what they think. I would hope 
they would ask whether it is appro-
priate for our country to spend billions 
on vacation spots, which are wonderful 
vacation spots, but spend nothing to 
prevent flood and devastation. 
Scripture says that if you build your 
home on shifting sand, the house will 
collapse. It is better to build it on a 
firm foundation. 
I would also add once more that we 
built this funding on the shifting 
sand—the literal shifting sand—of a 
Louisiana coastline, which is smaller 
since I began to speak, by about the 
size of a football field. That shifting 
sand supporting that infrastructure, 
which is shifting out into the Gulf, will 
erode not just my coastline but also 
the ability to pay for the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. Even if someone 
does not care about the 42 percent of 
the Americans who live in coastal par-
ishes and counties, they should care 
about that. 
I hope others join my coalition. I call 
upon the bill’s authors to include this

in the underlying amendment. It needs 
to be considered for the good of all 
Americans who call the coast home. I 
think it needs to be considered for the 
good of America. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
GARDNER). The Senator from Ten-
nessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
want to congratulate my colleague 
from Louisiana, one of the most dili-
gent Members of the U.S. Senate. He 
complimented the occupant of the 
Chair, Senator GARDNER
from Colo-
rado, for doing a great job for his 
State. I think Senator CASSIDY did a 
good job advocating for his State. But 
he left a little bit of perspective out on 
what he offered, and I would like to add 
some perspective. 
As he was speaking, I was thinking 
about the creation of the Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park. This oc-
curred in the 1930s. During the Great 
Depression, when everyone was worried 
about a job and everyone was worried 
about our country, the people of North 
Carolina and Tennessee appropriated 
through their State legislatures $2 mil-
lion each. Then John D. Rockefeller, 
Jr., heard about the effort, and he said: 
‘‘I will give $5 million if the States will 
match it.’’ 
So you had four—two from North 
Carolina, 
two 
from 
Tennessee—and 
then they set out to raise another $1 
million. They raised that from school-
children. They collected pennies and 
dimes and quarters in the middle of the 
Depression to create the Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park. 
At the time they did that, what did 
the people of Tennessee and North 
Carolina do? They gave it to the people 
of the United States of America. They 
gave it to all of us. They didn’t charge 
for it. In fact, they said: ‘‘The only way 
we will give it to you is if you will not 
put an interest fee on it.’’ 
They didn’t say: ‘‘Only Tennesseans, 
only North Carolinians can come.’’ 
They didn’t say: ‘‘We don’t want any-
body from Louisiana coming to the na-
tional park and the Great Smokies or 
from Colorado or from any other 
State.’’ They gave it to the people of 
this country. 
And what has happened? There are 
now 14 million people a year who come 
to the Great Smoky Mountains Na-
tional Park. We only have 6 or 7 mil-
lion in Tennessee, so we have a lot of 
people. We have a lot of interlopers, 
don’t we? We have a lot of people who 
don’t live where our park is, who use 
it. We are happy about that. We are 
proud of it. We are glad we gave it to 
the country, and we are glad Ken Burns 
includes it among one of the great 
treasures that he calls America’s Best 
Idea. It is a park for the country given 
by the people of Tennessee and North 
Carolina and the schoolchildren, and 
we didn’t object to everybody enjoying 
it. 
I believe I voted every single time 
that the coastal States have been deci-
mated by a hurricane. The Senator 
from Louisiana talked about $685 bil-
lion. I didn’t say, as a Senator from 
Tennessee: ‘‘You know, we don’t have a 
coast. We don’t have an ocean. It 
wasn’t us. Hurricanes don’t come here. 
Don’t charge me.’’ 
We gladly paid our share of the bill 
because we are part of one country. We 
are part of one country. That was four 
people, right? Six hundred and eighty- 
five billion dollars for people who were 
hurt, not just paid for by people who 
live on the coast but by people who live 
in Colorado and Tennessee and Iowa 
and places where there is not a coast— 
because we are one country. 
So the idea that we should only favor 
those items that come just from our 
State is not a very good argument for 
coastal resiliency because, if the Sen-
ator from Louisiana wants to bring 
that bill up based on the argument he 
made, why should anybody who doesn’t 
live on a coast vote for it? I voted for 
it in committee because I thought it 
was an important issue, even though 
we don’t have a coast. He is a very 
skillful advocate, a very diligent Sen-
ator. He is doing a good job of talking 
for his State, but he is missing the 
point. 
His other point is, let’s add it to this 
bill. Well, the Senate floor is littered 
with bills that never made it through 
here because they got loaded down 
with too many good ideas. People say: 
‘‘Well, there is a train that is likely to 
get to the station, let’s load it up.’’ 
And what happens? It just slows down, 
and after a while, it stops, and nothing 
happens. Because people have said: ‘‘If 
I don’t get what I want on the train, I 
am not for anything.’’ 
That is why the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund has never been perma-
nently funded. This was an idea Con-
gress passed in 1964, 60 years ago. In 
1985 and 1986, I was chairman of Presi-
dent Reagan’s Commission on Amer-
ica’s Outdoors. It looked at what we 
should do in the great American out-
doors. We didn’t say the great Ten-
nessee outdoors or the great Louisiana 
outdoors or the great Colorado out-
doors. We looked at the great Amer-
ican outdoors. We looked at the great 
American outdoors and said: ‘‘What 
can we do so our children and grand-
children can enjoy what we have en-
joyed?’’ 
The people of Wyoming aren’t the 
only ones who enjoy Yellowstone—or 
the people of Montana. Three or four 
million people a year go to a western 
park like that. They travel from all 
over the country to go there. 
When I look at the Great Smokies in 
football season, when we play LSU, 
those Tigers arrive on Tuesday. Well, 
the game is not until Saturday. Why do 
they come? Because they want to go to 
the Great Smoky Mountains National 
Park. We don’t put up a big sign and 
say: ‘‘Sorry, you didn’t pay for it. We 
gave it to the country. It is not for 
you.’’ They like it, and we like to have 
them there. 
So the point, though, was that some-
times you have a good idea, and if you 
add one more good idea to a piece of 
legislation, it sinks the whole ship. 
That would be the case here. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana is talking about a 
very big idea: What do we do about rev-
enue sharing from oil and gas revenues 
and coastal resiliency and climate 
change? He didn’t say too much about 
climate change, but if his sea level is 
rising, it is probably because of climate 
change, so maybe we ought to think 
about that too. So if we are going to 
bring up this whole issue of coastal re-
siliency, my guess is that some Sen-
ators will say: ‘‘All right, let’s talk 
about a moratorium on oil and gas 
drilling. Let’s talk about a fairer 
share.’’ 
Ninety percent of the drilling in 
Alaska goes to Alaska. Fifty percent of 
the drilling in Wyoming goes to Wyo-
ming. Twenty-seven percent of the 
drilling 3 miles off the coast of Lou-
isiana goes to Louisiana. If it is in the 
Federal lands beyond 3 miles, 371⁄2 per-
cent is split up among four States. 
That is the area where the oil comes 
from, but that land belongs to all 46 
States. So we could have a pretty good 
debate about that, about the morato-
rium. 
Then someone would say: ‘‘What 
about the oceans? The oceans deserve 
some of the care that comes from drill-
ing in the oceans, drilling in the water, 
so let’s talk about the oceans.’’ If we 
got into a moratorium on oil and gas 
drilling, adding the oceans, changing 
revenue sharing, there is no more dif-
ficult issue in the U.S. Senate than to 
adjust and say: ‘‘Well, Louisiana gets 
27 percent, maybe it ought to go to 40. 
Alaska gets 90, maybe Wyoming should 
go up to 90.’’ There is no more difficult 
issue than that to deal with. It sunk a 
lot of bills to bring that up. 
I remember the member of the con-
gregation who was disappointed be-
cause the preacher only preached a 
verse from the Gospel of Luke. Well, 
you can’t preach the whole Bible in one 
sermon, and we can’t pass every good 
idea in one bill. In fact, we have two 
bills together here that are, by them-
selves, about enough to stop the train 
before it gets to the station. 
Everybody here knows that it has 
been since 1964 that people have tried 
to pass the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund funding, even though the 
idea—money from environmental bur-
den, that is drilling offshore—for an en-
vironmental benefit—that is to let 
States and the Federal Government 
buy land that is treasured, as Senator 
DAINES from Montana says, 80 percent 
of the access good fishing in Montana 
comes with Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund money. So that bill has been 
out there a long time. 
How long have we tried to fix the na-
tional parks and the boat ramps and 
the wildlife refuges and the roads and 
the national forests and the Indian 
schools, which are in shambles in many 
cases? Decades. We have been going

and using up our parks and our public 
lands, and we haven’t been maintaining 
them. 
Again, you don’t just get to go to the 
public land in Kansas, if you are from 
Kansas, or to the Great Smokies, if you 
are from Tennessee or North Carolina, 
or to Yellowstone, if you are from Wyo-
ming or Montana—all of us go to that, 
and we have let them run down. That is 
about people. That is about people. 
Here we are in this big COVID–19 cri-
sis. What does everyone want to do 
today more than anything else? Get 
outdoors. Get out of the house. Here 
you are, cooped up with teenagers or 
Grandma or all of you, just a few peo-
ple sitting there for 3 months. You 
want a little space. 
The people who go to these open 
spaces are the people who live on the 
coast. They live in the big cities. They 
want a little variety in their lives, and 
we are glad for them to have it. When 
they go, they don’t want a bathroom 
that doesn’t work or a visitors center 
that is in shambles. They don’t want a 
pothole in the road or a trail that is 
worn down. They would like to have a 
place they could enjoy, that is in good 
shape, and they can go home. 
I think about the campground on 
Chilhowee Mountain just outside the 
Smokies. There might be a few camp-
ers from Louisiana who like to come up 
there whenever we play LSU. I don’t 
know, but probably there are. Well, it 
has been closed for 2 or 3 years because 
the sewage system doesn’t work. That 
is at least 500 families who don’t get to 
have the opportunity to do that. 
I am sympathetic to the Senator 
from Louisiana. I think he is one of our 
most able Senators. He is making a 
very forceful argument for a real prob-
lem: coastal resiliency. But I don’t buy 
this idea that just because this bill 
doesn’t fix that problem we should 
jeopardize this bill. 
Think about it. We have the Presi-
dent of the United States, who person-
ally is interested in this bill. His Sec-
retary of the Interior came down to 
Tennessee to see me 21⁄2 years ago. It is 
the first administration that said: ‘‘We 
are going to look at the money we get 
from energy exploration, and after we 
give some to Louisiana and after we 
give some to Wyoming and after we 
give some to Alaska and the other 
coastal States, we are going to take 
half of what is left for 5 years, and we 
are going to use it to fix all of those 
things that need to be fixed in our na-
tional treasures.’’ 
I said: ‘‘OK, if the President is going 
to support it and his Office of Manage-
ment and Budget is going to be the 
first Office of Management and Budget 
to allow money to be spent in that 
way, I am going to get behind it.’’ 
Then I came up here and fell into 
some pretty good company; the Sen-
ator from Colorado, the Senator from 
Montana, Senator WARNER from Vir-
ginia, and Senator PORTMAN from Ohio 
were already working on the subject. 
Senator KING of Maine, Senator HEIN-
RICH, Senator CANTWELL were involved 
in the land and water. It became abso-
lutely clear that, if we didn’t put these 
two bills together, none of them—nei-
ther of them—would pass. If they 
didn’t go together, neither of them 
would pass. 
We consulted with all of the people in 
the Senate who were working on this. 
There 
wasn’t 
complete 
agreement. 
There were a number of Senators who 
had other amendments that they would 
have liked to have, Senators whom I 
greatly respect and whose amendments 
I would probably support by the one. 
But as we looked at it and as we con-
sulted with the more than 800 groups— 
the sportsmen, the anglers, the envi-
ronmental groups—we all agreed that 
our only chance to get both bills was to 
put them together and say to the Sen-
ate: ‘‘Let’s vote on it; let’s send it to 
the House to see if they will vote on it; 
and after 60 years of trying, maybe we 
can get a good result.’’ 
I think that is why we got 80 votes. 
The first time, this came up on a proce-
dural vote, and 79 the second time it 
came up. 
A number of Senators have gone 
home tonight because this is a late- 
night vote. The reason we are having a 
late-night vote is because those who 
agree with Senator CASSIDY have in-
sisted on taking the maximum amount 
of time. That is their right to do, so we 
are here. If we succeed tonight, then we 
will have three votes on Monday, all of 
which are very important votes. So we 
are close to getting this train to the 
station. 
Senator CASSIDY has made an elo-
quent appeal to add an idea that is 
good, but an idea that is big and com-
plex and deserves its own day in the 
Sun, just as it came to our Energy 
Committee, of which I sit and he sits. 
I voted for it at that time, but we just 
can’t add it to this bill and get this 
train to the station. That is the fact of 
the matter. 
As much as I respect him and his 
ideas, I hope that he and others who 
agree with him would say: ‘‘Look, this 
is our one chance to get this kind of 
funding to make our national parks 
and all the rest of our public lands—the 
boat ramps, the trails, the roads, the 
sewage—our one chance to begin to fix 
the maintenance over a 5-year period of 
time instead of 10, 15, 25 years, or 
never. It is our one chance to do that.’’ 
I am sure it is our one chance to get 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
permanently 
funded, 
as 
Congress 
agreed to do in 1964 and as President 
Reagan’s Commission on America’s 
Outdoors, which I chaired in 1985 and 
1986, recommended as its No. 1 priority. 
Let’s not try to preach the whole 
Bible in one sermon. We have two good 
big ideas. Together, they make the 
most important piece of conservation 
legislation in a half century. 
You say: ‘‘Well, Senators are always 
exaggerating.’’ I don’t try to exag-
gerate too much, and I defy anyone to 
point me another bill that does more. I 
know we have been working on land 
and water since 1964. That is more than 
a half century. I know that this de-
ferred maintenance has been building 
up for a long, long time. It is the single 
biggest problem the national parks and 
our public lands have. 
I think 95 percent of the American 
people would wonder why we can’t pass 
it in 5 minutes. The reason is, there are 
lots of good ideas here, and if you load 
them all up in the same wheelbarrow 
or on the same train, the wheelbarrow 
collapses, and the train doesn’t get to 
the station. That is where we are. That 
is where we are. 
I hope that, with respect to the good 
ideas advocated tonight by the Senator 
from Louisiana—I know he will keep at 
it. I am on the same committee he is. 
I have voted for his idea before. I think 
it deserves its day in the Sun, and I 
will help him do that, but I would like 
to ask him to help us finish the job 
here on the most important piece of 
conservation legislation. I want him to 
know that those LSU Tigers are always 
welcome in the Great Smoky Moun-
tains, even if we bought it and paid for 
it and gave it to the whole country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING HECKY POWELL 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, even 
during this pandemic, people have been 
forming 
lines—6 
feet 
apart 
and 
masked—at the corner of Emerson and 
Green Bay Road in Evanston, IL, to 
pick up Hecky’s Barbeque. They come 
for the pulled pork, chicken wings, and 
especially the sauce. And for years, 
Hecky Powell was there with his fam-
ily’s recipes, his hard work, his smile, 
and his wisdom. Sadly, on May 22, 
Hecky passed away from pneumonia 
after a diagnosis of COVID–19. He used 
to say that people kept coming in for 
the sauce—that is what made the food 
great. Well, part of what made Evans-
ton great was Hecky. For 37 years, he 
brought good barbeque, leadership, and 
kindness to Evanston, and today we 
pay tribute to him. 
Harry William ‘‘Hecky’’ Powell was 
born in 1948 at Cook County Hospital.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2929 
June 11, 2020 
Verna, his mom, had to give birth 
there because there was no room at the 
Community Hospital of Evanston, the 
only hospital in town that accepted 
Black patients. Hecky was one of nine 
siblings. He had a successful career in 
public service, serving as the director 
of several nonprofit agencies. 
One day, Hecky got an idea for a res-
taurant. He was dating Cheryl Judice, 
a sociologist who would later become 
his wife. They didn’t know much about 
food, but Hecky’s mom did. Verna had 
lost her job at a restaurant, and his dad 
was unemployed at the time. So when 
the restaurant next to Hecky’s office 
went on the market, he figured he 
would buy it, and his parents could ac-
tually run the restaurant. On October 
13, 1983, Hecky’s Barbeque opened up 
with only $100 in the register. Many of 
the first recipes came from Verna and 
his Creole grandmother’s native New 
Orleans. 
Everyone enjoyed Hecky’s. Chicago 
Bears legend William ‘‘The Refrig-
erator’’ Perry was an early customer, 
drawn to the sauce-drenched ribs, fries, 
and two slices of Wonder Bread. Chi-
cago Bulls great Scottie Pippen had 
Hecky’s cater the team’s private plane 
on occasion. When the Northwestern 
Wildcats faced off with the University 
of Southern California Trojans in the 
Rose Bowl in 1996, then-mayor Lor-
raine Morton and Hecky bet the mayor 
of Pasadena that the Wildcats would 
win. The Trojans won 41 to 32, and 
Hecky made ribs and chicken for the 
entire Pasadena City Council. 
But it was more than a restaurant. 
Hecky used his place to help high 
school kids learn responsibility and so-
cial skills, giving many of them their 
first jobs. He worked long hours, start-
ing early in the morning, but he always 
had fun. No task was too small. He was 
cook, cleaner, and manager alongside 
his mother and the kids he was men-
toring. 
Hecky was a champion for local 
youth. In 1994, he founded the Forrest 
E. Powell Foundation. Named after his 
father, the foundation offers grant and 
scholarship opportunities. In 2016, he 
started the Evanston Work Ethic Pro-
gram, which helps young people pre-
pare for vocational or trade school. 
In 2011, Hecky left work early, think-
ing he had the flu. He made light of it, 
but his wife knew better. He later was 
diagnosed with liver failure and told he 
had 6 to 7 months to live. 
Hecky resolved that he was going to 
be fine and against tough odds, he lived 
to receive a liver transplant in 2015 and 
was able to get his life back. Hecky 
then joined the Northwestern Medicine 
Transplant Advisory Council Board to 
help people get their own lives back 
too. 
For all this work, Hecky received the 
key to the city of Evanston in 2014, 
Abner Mikva Lifetime Achievement 
Award in 2015, and the street in front of 
the restaurant was officially renamed 
‘‘Hecky Powell Way.’’ A person did not 
know Evanston until they experienced 
it with Hecky. 
When 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
reached Evanston, Hecky stepped up. 
Hecky’s kept the whole staff on payroll 
and donated meals to hospital workers, 
shelters, 
and 
the 
Evanston 
Fire 
Departm. Hecky, as the unofficial 
mayor of Evanston, was the face of the 
community poster that read ‘‘No Mask, 
No Sauce.’’ 
Evanston has lost a true leader of the 
community. He was kind and generous 
without ever asking anything in re-
turn. I was honored to count Hecky as 
a friend and enjoyed many great times 
together with him. Squeezing in a stop 
at Hecky’s was part of every Evanston 
visit. 
This June 19, people will celebrate 
with Hecky’s Juneteenth Strawberry 
pop. For years, Hecky was part of the 
Jubilee, celebrating the arrival of news 
in Galveston, TX, that the Civil War 
was over and President Lincoln had 
issued his Emancipation Proclamation. 
He was Evanston’s biggest supporter of 
making Juneteenth a holiday. This 
year, Evanston has its first Juneteenth 
Parade, and Hecky was going to be a 
big part of it, so it is fitting that the 
community will be dedicating part of 
the celebration to him. 
Hecky is survived by his wife Cheryl, 
seven children, Sharmin, Terry, Dawn, 
Joy, Hecky Junior, Jason, and Gigi, as 
well as his mother and seven siblings.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL THOMAS BERGESON 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize and congratulate Lt. 
Gen. Thomas W. Bergeson, of the U.S. 
Air Force, and the deputy commander 
of United States Central Command, 
MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, FL. 
Lieutenant General Bergeson is one 
our Nation’s finest military officers, 
and he will retire from Active military 
service on September 1, 2020, bringing 
to a close 35 years of distinguished 
service to our great Nation. 
In 1985, Lieutenant General Bergeson 
commissioned as a second lieutenant 
upon graduation from the U.S. Air 
Force Academy. He commanded units 
at every echelon from fighter squadron 
to a numbered Air Force. Lieutenant 
General Bergeson also held various 
staff assignments, including positions 
as chief of aviation, strategic oper-
ations, 
Multi-National 
Forces-Iraq; 
senior defense official and defense 
attache´ in the UK; and director, Legis-
lative Liaison, Office of the Secretary 
of the Air Force, at the Pentagon. 
Prior to his current assignment, he 
served 
as 
the 
deputy 
commander, 
United Nations Command Korea; dep-
uty commander, U.S. Forces Korea; 
commander, Air Component Command, 
South 
Korea/U.S. 
Combined 
Forces 
Command; and commander, 7th Air 
Force, Pacific Air Forces at Osan Air 
Base. Over the course of his career, 
Lieutenant General Bergeson flew nu-
merous fighter aircraft to include the 
F–15, the F–22, and the A–10. He is a 
graduate of the NATO Defense College 
in Rome and the Harvard Kennedy 
School of Government. 
At a time of great uncertainty in the 
world, particularly in the Middle East, 
Lieutenant General Bergeson served as 
a critical leader in Central Command, 
a combatant command that has an 
enormous influence and presence in 
some of the most volatile parts of the 
globe. Lieutenant General Bergeson is 
an exceptional leader and an American 
patriot who is committed to our Armed 
Forces, our national security, and our 
Nation. It is for Lt. Gen. Tom Bergeson 
that we, with profound admiration and 
deep respect, pay tribute to for all he 
has done for the defense of our Nation 
for over three decades as a leader and 
selfless servant. 
Mr. President, it is my pleasure 
today to recognize Lieutenant General 
Bergeson’s long and decorated career. 
On behalf of a grateful nation, I com-
mend Lieutenant General Bergeson for 
his dedicated service to the United 
States of America. I also wish to recog-
nize the sacrifices and contributions 
made by his wife, Pam, and his chil-
dren, Erik and Kristin. I extend my 
best wishes to Lieutenant General 
Bergeson and his family and wish them 
the best in retirement and the years to 
come. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN 
MARITIME WORKFORCE 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I offer 
remarks to honor the men and women 
of the American maritime workforce 
and to thank them for their service. 
June 5, 2020, marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the enactment of the U.S. Mer-
chant Marine Act of 1920. Commonly 
referred to as the Jones Act, the act 
has served over the last century as the 
foundation of the Great Lakes and do-
mestic shipping industry. This vital 
maritime law ensures that cargo mov-
ing between domestic ports is carried 
aboard vessels that are American-built, 
American-owned, 
and 
American- 
flagged, which in turn strengthens and 
supports U.S. homeland security while 
driving economic benefits to local com-
munities. Each and every day, 365 days 
a year, the Jones Act functions to pro-
tect our Nation’s 95,000 miles of coast-
line and inland waterways, limiting in-
land access to foreign vessels and crews 
while mariners serve as the eyes and 
ears to strengthen border and home-
land security. 
America’s dependence on the Great 
Lakes and the seas is integral to our 
economic health and our sovereignty. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in 
my own State of Michigan. According 
to The American Maritime Partner-
ship, Michigan’s Great Lakes domestic 
maritime industry contributes $2.8 bil-
lion annually to our State economy, 
including 12,140 jobs and $703.6 million 
in worker income. With 37 deep-draft 
ports, Michigan has more than the 7 
other Great Lakes States combined. 
Over the last 100 years, the men and 
women of the U.S. maritime workforce

have also unfailingly answered the call 
to duty, providing vital services to sup-
port the Nation in times of crisis. 
Their service was never clearer than 
during the activation of civilian mer-
chant mariners amidst the Second 
World War. These men and women 
moved critical supplies to overseas 
troops and allies, while enduring the 
highest rate of casualties of any serv-
ice. More recently our domestic mari-
time workforce has respond swiftly to 
a range of crises facing the Nation, in-
cluding facilitating the largest boatlift 
in world history following 9/11 and the 
current and ongoing delivery of essen-
tial medical supplies and goods to com-
munities in need during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
On this week’s centennial anniver-
sary of the Jones Act, I thank the men 
and women of the U.S. maritime indus-
try for their service, and I vow to con-
tinue to work here in the Senate to up-
hold the integrity of the act’s protec-
tions for our Michigan and Great Lakes 
workforce. 
f 
REMEMBERING JOE VANDEVER, 
SR. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I pay 
tribute today to Joe Vandever, Sr., 
who was one of the last surviving Nav-
ajo Code Talkers. 
Joe was born February 5, 1923, into 
the Red Running Into the Water People 
clan, born for Two Who Came to the 
Water clan. He passed away 5 days shy 
of his 97th birthday, on January 31, 
2020, in Haystack, NM. 
Joe enlisted in the Marines when he 
was 19. He went through boot camp at 
Camp Pendleton and spent 6 months of 
intensive training learning the code 
and how to operate communications 
equipment to become a Navajo Code 
Talker. 
Navajo Code Talkers transmitted key 
military information through a code 
based on the Navajo language that the 
Japanese never broke. They partici-
pated in every major Marine operation 
in the Pacific theater and gave the Ma-
rines a critical advantage throughout 
the war. However, when they returned, 
they couldn’t talk about their work, 
which remained classified until 1968. 
In 2001, Navajo Code Talkers, includ-
ing Joe, received the Congressional Sil-
ver Medal. 
Joe epitomized the bravery and skill 
of the Navajo Code Talkers. Joe’s Nav-
ajo name means ‘‘going places,’’ and he 
certainly did during the war. Serving 
in the 6th Marine Division from 1943 to 
1946, Joe was stationed on 16 battle-
ships—serving from Samoa to Guadal-
canal to Guam to Japan to China. Joe 
translated messages from Navajo to 
English and set up communications 
posts on the frontlines. 
Joe was a spiritual man, and he pro-
vided spiritual support for others in his 
Marine division. He liked to tell a 
story about how he knew he would 
come home from the war. Before he 
left, he had been blessed in a ceremony. 
When he was in Guam, a bird he called 
a sheep-face bird—which was a Cassin’s 
kingbird—came to him. There were no 
sheep-face birds in Guam, and that bird 
gave Joe a sign he would return home 
safely. And he did. 
After he returned, Joe honored his 
Navajo traditions as a medicine man. 
He held many different jobs over the 
years—working at an oil refinery, in 
construction, and as a miner, pros-
pector, farmer, and chauffeur. For 14 
years, he was employed at the Gallup 
Indian Medical Center as a custodian. 
Joe was fiercely proud of the Navajo 
language. According to Joe, ‘‘Our lan-
guage is powerful,’’ and ‘‘we [won]the 
war with our tongue.’’ He wanted 
younger generations to learn the lan-
guage and counseled them: ‘‘Don’t ever 
leave your language.’’ 
Joe was a loving family man. After 
the war, he came home and married 
Bessie, to whom he was married for 73 
years, until she passed away on Sep-
tember 24, 2019. He and Bessie had 9 
children, 36 grandchildren, 55 great- 
grandchildren, and 1 great-great-grand-
child. He inspired them and encouraged 
them to pursue higher education, and 
he was beloved by them all. 
Joe lived a long life, and a good life— 
with kindness, optimism, good humor, 
integrity, and commitment and love 
for family and community. His light 
will continue to shine bright in his 
children and his future generations. I 
am honored to pay tribute to Joe 
Vandever who faithfully served our Na-
tion and his family and Tribe. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DARRELL WILLSON 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today I 
rise to acknowledge the service of Mr. 
Darrell R. Willson, who is retiring as 
the Administrator of the National Gal-
lery of Art in July after a 50-year ca-
reer serving the public. 
Mr. Willson has spent the three past 
decades with the gallery overseeing the 
backbone of its operations—protecting 
and preserving its historic buildings, 
working to expand its footprint, and 
ensuring that it maintains a world- 
class staff. As an executive officer of 
the institution, he has worked closely 
with 
gallery 
leadership, 
executive 
branch officials and Congress—includ-
ing with the House and Senate Com-
mittees on Appropriations—to ensure 
that the gallery has had the people and 
resources it needs to fulfill its mission. 
During his tenure, the gallery has com-
pleted more than $400 million worth of 
renovations to the East and West 
Buildings and welcomed visitors to new 
public spaces such as the Sculpture 
Gallery and the Andrew W. Mellon Me-
morial Fountain. In short, his work has 
provided the gallery with a stunning 
backdrop to showcase its collection of 
more than 150,000 sculptures, paintings, 
drawings, 
and 
photographs 
to 
the 
American public. 
His work with the National Gallery 
of Art is not the only contribution on 
Mr. Willson’s resume that deserves rec-
ognition. Prior to joining the gallery, 
Mr. Willson worked for a decade at the 
Art 
Institute 
of 
Chicago, 
rising 
through the ranks to becom executive 
director of protective services. He also 
served the public as a local law en-
forcement official with the Waukegan, 
IL, police department. And of course, 
these positions are all in addition to 
his most important role—his service as 
a husband, a father, and a grandfather. 
Mr. Willson deserves to take great 
pride in all of these important accom-
plishments—especially 
his 
tireless 
work in support of our Nation’s great 
arts and cultural institutions—as he 
retires from the gallery. On behalf of 
the Senate, I send him our thanks and 
warmest congratulations for a job well 
done.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RAVI ZACHARIAS 
∑ Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, the 
State of Georgia and truly the entire 
world lost an exceptional beacon of 
goodness and faith when Ravi Zacha-
rias passed away on May 19, 2020. How-
ever, our loss is Heaven’s gain. Ravi 
was a man of deep faith, love, and serv-
ice to others. He embodied the com-
mand of Jesus in Mark 16:15 to ‘‘Go 
into all the world and preach the gos-
pel to all creation.’’ 
Ravi first came to know the teach-
ings of Jesus Christ when he was 17 
years old, when a nurse read the Word 
of God to him while he was recovering 
from a suicide attempt. From that day 
forth, Ravi made it his mission to 
share with others the joy and faith 
which had rescued him from despair. 
In 1971, when he was just 25 years old, 
Ravi traveled to war-torn Vietnam, 
where he ministered in hospitals, mili-
tary bases, and prison camps. The trip 
nearly cost him his life. Yet he went on 
to travel to every corner of the world 
sharing the Gospel. 
In 1983, Reverend Billy Graham per-
sonally invited Ravi to speak at the in-
augural International Conference for 
Itinerant Evangelists in Amsterdam. 
This helped Ravi develop a new passion 
for apologetics. Not only did he want 
to spread the Gospel, he wanted to help 
train others how to defend their faith 
in a rapidly secularizing world. A year 
later, Ravi founded Ravi Zacharias 
International Ministries to carry out 
this mission. 
Over the years, Ravi continued shar-
ing faith and love around the world 
through speaking engagements, books, 
and radio appearances, reaching untold 
numbers of people in need. 
Ravi built incredible institutions for 
sharing the Christian faith. He founded 
the Oxford Centre for Christian Apolo-
getics. He founded Wellspring Inter-
national, a humanitarian group helping 
women and children around the world. 
In 2017, he founded the Zacharias Insti-
tute to teach apologetics in Atlanta, 
Georgia.

Ravi spent the last 36 years of his life 
in Atlanta. He is remembered as a man

TRIBUTE TO LEE AXDAHL 
∑ Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Lee Axdahl for his years of 
leadership to the State of South Da-
kota and our Nation as a strong advo-
cate for highway safety. 
Lee has always been a leader. Before 
becoming involved in highway safety, 
he had a successful career in radio 
broadcasting where he won numerous 
broadcast journalism awards, owned 
several radio stations, and served as 
president of the South Dakota Broad-
casters Association. 
Lee got his start in highway safety in 
2007 when he began working at the 
South 
Dakota 
Office 
of 
Accident 
Records as the statistical program 
manager. In 2010, when I was working 
as Governor of South Dakota, I ap-
pointed Lee to serve as director of the 
South Dakota Highway Safety Office. 
He was subsequently reappointed by 
Governors Dennis Daugaard and Kristi 
Noem. 
Under Lee’s leadership, South Da-
kota has experienced record-low traffic 
fatality levels, including a 22-percent 
decline in 2019. Under his leadership, 
the State of South Dakota has secured 
a record five highway safety program-
ming commendations in its most re-
cent National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration Management Review. 
Over the years, Lee has worked to 
implement the State’s award-winning 
‘‘Grim Reaper’’ public awareness cam-
paign and advocated for expansion of 
South Dakota’s innovative 24/7 sobri-
ety program to reduce impaired driv-
ing. He also modernized South Dako-
ta’s crash reporting abilities by adopt-
ing an electronic system, which has 
improved data submission periods from 
more than 4 months to less than 7 days. 
Lee’s impact on highway safety has 
extended beyond South Dakota. He has 
served on the board of directors and ex-
ecutive committee of the Governors 
Highway Safety Association—GHSA—

BRAUN, 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY, 
Mr. 
ROUNDS, and Ms. ERNST): 
S. 3938. A bill to extend Federal guid-
ance concerning the use of certain al-
cohol-based hand sanitizer during the 
coronavirus public health emergency, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3938 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hand Sani-
tizer Guidance Extension Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON HAND SANI-
TIZER. 
(a) EXTENSION OF FEDERAL GUIDANCE.—The 
Food and Drug Administration guidance en-
titled ‘‘Guidance for Industry: Temporary 
Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol- 
Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the 
Public Health Emergency (COVID–19)’’, ini-
tially released on March 23, 2020, and updated 
on April 15, 2020, and on June 1, 2020, shall re-
main in effect until the date that is 2 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act. 
(b) EFFECT
OF EXTENSION.—During the 2- 
year period described in subsection (a), the 
Food and Drug Administration shall permit 
the production, sale, and use of hand sani-
tizer, consistent with the guidance described 
in subsection (a), provided that such hand 
sanitizer is manufactured using only the fol-
lowing ingredients in the preparation of the 
product: 
(1)(A) Subject to subsection (c), alcohol 
(ethanol) that is not less than 94.9 percent 
ethanol by volume; or 
(B) United States Pharmacopeia grade iso-
propyl alcohol. 
(2) United States Pharmacopeia grade or 
Food Chemical Codex grade glycerin (glyc-
erol). 
(3) Hydrogen peroxide. 
(4) Sterile water meeting United States 
Pharmacopeia 
specifications 
for 
purified 
water. 
(c) ETHANOL PRODUCED IN CERTAIN FACILI-
TIES.—Ethanol produced in facilities nor-
mally producing fuel or technical ethanol 
may be used as described in subsection 
(b)(1)(A) only if such ethanol— 
(1) meets United States Pharmacopeia or 
Food Chemical Codex grade requirements; 
(2) has been screened for any other poten-
tially harmful impurities not specified in the 
United States Pharmacopeia or Food Chem-
ical Codex requirements; or 
(3) has otherwise been approved for use by 
the Food and Drug Administration. 
(d) AUTOMATIC EXTENSION.—The effective 
period of the guidance described in sub-
section (a) shall automatically be extended 
for 1 additional year if the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services determines that 
a public health emergency exists at the time 
that the 2-year period described in sub-
section (a) expires. 
(e) EXEMPTION.—If the Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs determines that a public 
health emergency requires that the require-
ment for the use of denatured alcohol be re-
duced, or requires a waiver of any other re-
quirement with respect to hand sanitizer 
under the guidance, the Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs may waive or reduce such 
requirement, as applicable. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, like most 
other sectors of our economy, agri-
culture has taken a huge hit from the 
coronavirus. The pandemic has caused 
significant market volatility, sending 
many commodity futures prices plum-
meting. 
Increased consumer demand for beef 
led to significant increases in boxed 
beef prices, while cattle prices plum-
meted, which led to significant gaps 
between cattle producer and packer 
profit margins. To make the situation 
worse, temporary closures and reduced 
processing 
capacity 
at 
U.S. 
meatpacking plants as a result of the 
virus further diminished demand for 
livestock and depressed prices. This 
has aggravated an already difficult sit-
uation for farmers and ranchers. 
Unlike the majority of the economy, 
which 
was 
thriving 
before 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, the agricultural 
economy has been struggling for a 
while. Low prices, extended trade dis-
putes, 
and 
natural 
disasters 
have 
meant a tough few years for farmers 
and 
ranchers 
even 
before 
the 
coronavirus hit. Now things are even 
more challenging. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my 
State of South Dakota. So supporting 
farmers and ranchers during the crisis 
has been one of my top priorities. I 
fought to get agriculture relief money 
included in the Coronavirus Aid Relief 
and Economic Security Act, or the 
CARES Act, which was signed into law 
in late March. The final bill included 
$14 billion to replenish the Commodity 
Credit Corporation to allow the De-
partment of Agriculture to provide in-
come and price support for farmers and 
ranchers, plus an additional $9.5 billion 
in emergency support for agricultural 
producers affected by the pandemic. 
Days after the bill passed, I led a bi-
partisan group of Senators and Rep-
resentatives in a letter to Secretary of 
Agriculture Sonny Perdue urging him 
to use a portion of the funds to provide 
support for hard-hit cattle producers. 
In mid-April, the Department of Agri-
culture responded to that letter and 
other petitions by announcing that it 
would issue $16 billion in direct pay-
ments to agriculture producers af-
fected by the virus. Signups for this 
funding began at the end of May, and, 
as of June 8, South Dakota agriculture 
producers had received approximately 
$80 million. 
Over the past 2 months, I kept in 
constant contact with the Department 
of Agriculture and others to amplify 
producers’ concerns and to urge swift 
relief. I have also been focused on de-
veloping additional legislation to help 
farmers and ranchers weather this cri-
sis. 
Last week, I introduced legislation to 
allow emergency haying and grazing on 
Conservation Reserve Program acres 
for the duration of this crisis. Under 
current law, ag producers can hay or 
graze their CRP acres during weather- 
related disasters without a reduction 
in their CRP payments. My legislation 
would extend that provision to cover 
pandemics, including the COVID–19 
pandemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2935 
June 11, 2020 
Thanks to low prices and a reduction 
in capacity of meatpacking plants as a 
result of the pandemic, farmers and 
ranchers are having to hold on to their 
livestock for longer than expected. 
This bill would help ensure they have 
adequate forage for their animals. 
Earlier this week, I introduced an-
other bill, the Paycheck Protection for 
Producers Act, which would help more 
farmers and ranchers benefit from the 
Paycheck Protection Program. The 
coronavirus relief legislation that we 
passed in late March established the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
provides forgivable loans to small busi-
nesses to help them keep their employ-
ees on their payroll during this crisis. 
Self-employed Americans, which de-
scribes many farmers and ranchers, are 
eligible for these loans, but, in prac-
tice, the program’s guidelines have ex-
cluded a lot of agricultural producers. 
Low commodity prices and a chal-
lenging planting season meant that 
many farmers and ranchers had a nega-
tive income in 2019. And right now, the 
program’s guidelines excludes farmers 
and ranchers without employees with a 
negative net income for last year. My 
legislation would allow more farmers 
to access the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram by allowing them to use their 
2019 gross income instead of their 2019 
net income when applying for a loan. I 
am hoping to get both of these bills 
through Congress in the near future. 
In addition to direct relief, another 
thing that we can do to support our Na-
tion’s agriculture producers is to sup-
port the ethanol industry. Ethanol and 
biodiesel producers buy up a significant 
amount of American corn and soybean 
oil, but decreased demand for fuel as a 
result of coronavirus has significantly 
diminished this crucial market for our 
farmers, and that is why, in addition to 
direct relief measures for farmers and 
ranchers, I have also focused on what 
we can do to support the ethanol indus-
try. 
American ethanol has stepped up to 
help during the coronavirus crisis by 
providing ethanol or alcohol for hand 
sanitizer. Thanks to the FDA’s tem-
porary policy for preparation of certain 
alcohol-based hand sanitizer products 
during the public health emergency, 
qualifying ethanol can be used as an al-
cohol content in hand sanitizer. 
I imagine there are few Americans 
who haven’t significantly stepped up 
their purchase of hand sanitizer during 
the current crisis. In addition to meas-
ures like social distancing and mask 
wearing and frequent hand washing, it 
is key to preventing the spread of the 
virus. When water and soap are not im-
mediately available, hand sanitizer can 
step in as a substitute. We need a 
steady supply of hand sanitizer to help 
curtail virus transmission. 
To help us meet this need and sup-
port our Nation’s ethanol producers, 
today I am introducing the Hand Sani-
tizer Guidance Extension Act of 2020. 
Put simply, my bill will extend the 
FDA’s temporary ethanol-based hand 
sanitizer policy for at least 2 years. 
This will give ethanol producers that 
have made investments or changes in 
operations to meet the need for hand 
sanitizer a longer time to recoup their 
investment costs. 
I recognize that there is ongoing de-
liberation with the FDA about dena-
turants and other accepted chemical 
limits for hand sanitizer ethanol, and 
my bill would not hinder those discus-
sions. My bill would simply provide 
ethanol producers with a baseline of 
certainty while still allowing the FDA 
to make case-by-case approvals and to 
waive or reduce other requirements as 
necessary to meet the public health 
emergency. 
Now, the amount of ethanol required 
for hand sanitizer is just a drop in the 
bucket for our ethanol producers, and I 
am committed to finding additional 
ways to bring this clean American- 
grown fuel to market. Every little bit 
helps, and this legislation will at least 
give a small measure of certainty to 
producers while helping to meet the 
nationwide demand for hand sanitizer. 
The coronavirus crisis has high-
lighted just how much we rely on our 
Nation’s agriculture producers. I am 
grateful every day for their work, and 
advocating for them will continue to be 
one of my top priorities. I am com-
mitted to helping our farmers and 
ranchers through the challenges they 
are facing and seeing our Nation’s agri-
cultural economy thrive. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. SCHUMER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Mr. MARKEY, 
and Ms. HARRIS): 
S. 3946. A bill to require certain heli-
copters to be equipped with safety 
technologies, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the ‘‘Helicopter 
Safety Act.’’ 
On January 26, 2020, a helicopter car-
rying nine Californians flew into foggy 
weather, ultimately crashing minutes 
later. Los Angeles and the world soon 
learned that among the crash victims 
were basketball legend Kobe Bryant 
and his daughter Gianna. 
And in the time since, we have 
learned the names and stories of John, 
Alyssa, and Keri Altobelli; Sarah and 
Payton Chester; Christina Mauser; and 
Ara 
Zobayan. 
These 
were 
spirited 
friends and family members connected 
by their love of sport, traveling to a 
weekend basketball tournament. 
The sudden and shocking nature of 
the accident touched many, and I have 
been moved by the public remem-
brances in Los Angeles and elsewhere 
in honor of the victims. 
But this tragedy is one that could 
have been averted. While the National 
Transportation Safety Board is still in-
vestigating the incident, a preliminary 
report indicates the helicopter was fly-
ing through thick clouds and fog, yet 
was not equipped with a terrain aware-
ness and warning system among other 
safety technology. This technology 
provides 
pilots 
real-time, 
in-flight 
warning signals and an image of sur-
rounding terrain. 
Since 2006, the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board has recommended 
to the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA) that all new and existing 
helicopters capable of carrying six or 
more passengers be equipped with ter-
rain awareness and warning system 
technology. However, FAA has only re-
quired these warning systems for air 
ambulances. 
The lack of a terrain awareness and 
warning system left the pilot vulner-
able, 
without 
an 
adequate 
under-
standing of his surroundings. This 
technology has become standard on 
new helicopters from Airbus, Bell, 
Leonardo, and Sikorsky since Decem-
ber 2018. 
This bill also requires crash-resistant 
flight data and voice recorders. Other-
wise known as black boxes, this tech-
nology is important for when accidents 
do happen and mistakes are made. It 
would allow agencies like the NTSB to 
have a better understanding of the in-
cident and provide more information to 
the FAA to prevent future accidents. 
It is clear that additional steps are 
needed to ensure that helicopters can 
fly safely, both for the sake of pas-
sengers and those on the ground. Our 
bill offers a commonsense approach to 
preventing further accidents like this 
one. It would simply direct the FAA to 
implement 
the 
National 
Transpor-
tation Safety Board’s recommenda-
tions to require terrain awareness and 
warning systems and flight data and 
voice recorders on all helicopters car-
rying six or more passengers. 
I appreciate the hard work of the Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board in 
developing 
these 
important 
rec-
ommendations, and it is long past time 
that the FAA heed its call. 
My thoughts continue to be with the 
victims and their loved ones impacted 
by this heartbreaking accident. Our 
bill would help prevent future tragedies 
like the one that occurred this past 
January and it is critical that Congress 
pass it swiftly to ensure that such loss 
of life was not in vain. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

sions relating to the higher education

Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, on March

resulting from the COVID–19 pandemic.

provided nearly $14 billion in funding 
to ensure institutions of higher edu-
cation could make the transition to 
distance 
learning, 
provide 
students 
with essential supports and resources, 
and cover the enormous costs they’ve 
incurred during this time. Unfortu-
nately, the Administration has not fol-
lowed Congress’ intent to provide these 
colleges and universities with the in-
creased flexibility they need to meet 
the needs of their students. 
This is why I’m introducing the 
Coronavirus Relief Flexibility for Stu-
dents 
and 
Institutions 
Act, 
which 
would 
fix 
several 
implementation 
issues with the higher education funds 
in the CARES Act by providing institu-
tions of higher education and students 
with the flexibility Congress intended. 
This bill would make an additional 7.5 
million students eligible for emergency 
financial aid by expanding eligibility 
beyond just those who have filled out a 
FAFSA and are eligible under Title IV 
of the Higher Education Act. Addition-
ally, it would allow institutions of 
higher education to use CARES Act 
funds to cover revenue losses incurred 
as a result of COVID–19, rather than 
limiting the funding to the U.S. De-
partment of Education’s narrow inter-
pretation that funds can only be used 
for new expenses associated with the 
transition of instruction to distance 
learning. It would also ensure that col-
leges hardest hit by COVID–19 are re-
ceiving the support they need by re-
quiring an application to demonstrate 
such needs, rather than providing all 
colleges with $500,000 in taxpayer funds 
regardless of size. 
In this difficult time, colleges des-
perately need the flexibility to best 
serve their students. This bill will help 
ensure that Secretary DeVos and the 
U.S. Department of Education follow 
Congress’ intent to stabilize our insti-
tutions of higher education that are 
hurting from COVID–19 and provide 
emergency financial aid for the stu-
dents who need it, not just those that 
who have met bureaucratic require-
ments. I hope the Senate passes this 
bill quickly to ensure that institutions 
have the flexibility and supports they 
need to continue providing high qual-
ity and equitable access to education 
for all students as we continue to 
weather this pandemic. 
By Mr. CRUZ (for himself, Mr. 
LEE, Mr. SCOTT of South Caro-
lina, and Mr. SCOTT of Florida): 
S. 3949. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to permit kinder-
garten through grade 12 educational 
expenses to be paid from a 529 account 
during the Coronavirus Emergency Pe-
riod; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise at a 
time of crisis. For several months now, 
our Nation been dealing with two si-
multaneous 
crises—a 
global 
health 
pandemic that has claimed the lives of 
over 115,000 Americans and over 400,000 
people across the globe—and an eco-
nomic crisis that has cost over 40 mil-
lion Americans their jobs. We are also 
now dealing with a crisis of racial divi-
sion and anger over the killing of 
George Floyd on Memorial Day. 
As our Nation reels from the difficul-
ties of the past few months, it’s time to 
focus on what we can do to recover. 
One challenge that we’ve faced this 
year is the closures of schools all 
across the Country. Suddenly, because 
of the coronavirus pandemic, over 76 
million American students of all ages 
were faced with finishing the school 
year at home—including over five mil-
lion students in my home State of 
Texas—away from many of the re-
sources that school provides. 
To say that has been a staggering 
shift for many students and families is 
an understatement. That is why today, 
I’m introducing a bill to temporarily 
expand 529 accounts so that parents of 
children who are now learning from 
home as a result of the coronavirus 
pandemic can cover educational ex-
penses such as tuition, books and other 
instructional materials, online edu-
cational materials, tutoring, standard-
ized test fees, and educational thera-
pies for students with disabilities. 
This bill, the Helping Parents Edu-
cate Children During the Coronavirus 
Pandemic Act, is a version of a bill I 
introduced last year, the Student Em-
powerment Act, which would allow 100 
percent of American students to use 529 
accounts to help pay for K–12 edu-
cation. The Helping Parents Educate 
Children During the Coronavirus Pan-
demic Act has the benefits of the Stu-
dent Empowerment Act, but is tailored 
to navigate the educational challenges 
the coronavirus pandemic poses to stu-
dents nationwide. 
These bills would extend 529 accounts 
to cover educational expenses of all 
sorts, allowing public school families 
(who do not pay tuition) to participate. 
Around 90 percent of America’s stu-
dents attend public school, so this 
change would help many Americans af-
ford all the associated costs of an edu-
cation. 
These bills would also make 529 ac-
counts more accessible to low-income 
and 
middle-income 
families, 
public 
school families, families who send their 
children 
to 
religious 
schools, 
and 
homeschool families who need help 
paying for their child’s K–12 education. 
We’ve come a long way in making a 
quality education attainable for Amer-
ican students, but we have more to do. 
That is why I’m working to help par-
ents, guardians, and students across 
the country access the tools they need 
to continue school at home as long as 
we have a public health emergency be-
cause of the coronavirus pandemic. 
In closing, I want to thank the edu-
cators and parents who over the past 
three months have made education a 
priority for millions of American stu-
dents. Your hard work and dedication 
to ensuring your students continue to 
learn despite the challenges of a global 
pandemic is a good example for us all 
that we must keep going, we must 
move forward, and that one day, we 
will emerge from these challenges 
stronger than before. 
I yield the floor.

S2937 
June 11, 2020 
Nations furnish assistance to the Republic of 
Korea’’ and Resolution 84 on July 7, 1950, rec-
ommending Members make military forces 
and other assistance available ‘‘to a unified 
command under the United States of Amer-
ica’’; 
Whereas, on July 27, 1953, an Armistice 
Agreement was signed by United States 
Army Lieutenant General William Harrison, 
Jr. representing the United Nations Com-
mand with the Korean People’s Army and 
the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army to ‘‘in-
sure a complete cessation of hostilities and 
of all acts of armed force in Korea until a 
final peaceful settlement is achieved’’; 
Whereas the Armistice Agreement remains 
in force today and by its terms has neither 
formally ended the Korean War nor con-
stituted a permanent settlement of peace on 
the Korean Peninsula; 
Whereas, on October 1, 1953, a Mutual De-
fense Treaty between the United States and 
South Korea was signed in Washington, D.C. 
(5 UST 2368), with ratification advised by and 
consented to by the Senate on January 26, 
1954, and the treaty remains in force today 
‘‘to strengthen their efforts for collective de-
fense for the preservation of peace and secu-
rity’’; 
Whereas, during the Korean War, 1,789,000 
United States soldiers, sailors, airmen, and 
Marines served in theater, 36,574 paid the ul-
timate sacrifice with their lives in defense of 
freedom in South Korea, and more than 7,500 
members of the United States Armed Forces 
remain classified by the Department of De-
fense as Missing in Action; 
Whereas, on October 7, 2016, H.R.1475, enti-
tled the ‘‘Korean War Veterans Memorial 
Wall of Remembrance Act’’ was introduced 
in the 114th Congress by Representative Sam 
Johnson of Texas and became Public Law 
114–230; 
Whereas, according to House Report 114– 
433, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall 
of Remembrance Act (Public Law 114–230) au-
thorizes a Wall of Remembrance to be added 
to the Korean War Veterans Memorial with 
the names of those that died in theater, are 
listed as missing, or were prisoners of war, 
and would also list the number of personnel 
that were part of the Korean Augmentation 
to the United States Army (KATUSA) pro-
gram; 
Whereas the Korean War is no longer ‘‘The 
Forgotten War’’ but ‘‘The Forgotten Vic-
tory’’ and June 25, 1950, is considered the 
symbolic start of the ironclad United States- 
South Korea alliance that was forged in 
blood; 
Whereas, in the 70 years since the outbreak 
of the Korean War, the United States-South 
Korea alliance has transformed itself from a 
security relationship into a comprehensive 
global partnership; 
Whereas South Korea is considered one of 
the greatest post-World War II success sto-
ries, and its continued partnership with the 
United States remains the linchpin of United 
States foreign policy in Northeast Asia; 
Whereas the United States and South 
Korea have stood shoulder to shoulder in all 
four major conflicts the United States has 
faced since the Korean War, while maintain-
ing peace on the Korean Peninsula and con-
tributing to global prosperity through the 
shared values of democracy, human rights, 
the rule of law, and a free market economy; 
Whereas it is in the national interest of 
the United States to maintain its forward 
deployed presence in South Korea through 
United States Forces Korea (USFK), a pre-
mier Joint force that is ‘‘well led, dis-
ciplined, trained and ready to Fight Tonight 
and win’’; 
Whereas the Asia Reassurance Initiative 
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409) calls for the 
strengthening and broadening of diplomatic, 
economic, and security ties between the 
United States and South Korea; 
Whereas the 70-year transformation of the 
United States-South Korea alliance into a 
mutually beneficial partnership has recently 
led to important coordination and coopera-
tion in confronting global pandemics, includ-
ing H1N1 in 2009 and COVID–19 in 2020; 
Whereas the Government of South Korea 
has made significant contributions to the 
global community in combating COVID–19, 
including the manufacture and export of Re-
verse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reac-
tion (RT-PCR) test kits to the United States 
Government and various State governments, 
including Colorado; 
Whereas, on May 8, 2020, the Government 
of South Korea donated 500,000 masks to be 
distributed to Korean War veterans through-
out the United States, including the Navajo 
Nation, in a gesture of gratitude and in com-
memoration of the seventieth anniversary of 
the outbreak of the Korean War; and 
Whereas, on May 10, 2020, the Government 
of South Korea donated 2,000,000 masks to 
the United States to help fill shortages in 
hospitals most impacted by COVID–19: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that the United States-South 
Korea alliance serves as the linchpin of re-
gional stability and mutual security in 
Northeast Asia; 
(2) reiterates that the United States and 
South Korea share an enduring interest in 
the continued strength of the bilateral alli-
ance, including deepening the military, dip-
lomatic, economic, and cultural ties between 
the United States and South Korea, as well 
as broadening alliance cooperation to con-
front 21st century challenges, such as global 
health, the environment, and energy secu-
rity; 
(3) emphasizes that the United States- 
South Korea alliance espouses shared demo-
cratic values and remains committed to 
human rights, the rule of law, and free mar-
ket principles and therefore plays an expand-
ing role in stability and security far beyond 
the Korean Peninsula; 
(4) reaffirms that the Governments of the 
United States and South Korea must pursue 
a coordinated policy of diplomatic engage-
ment, economic pressure, and military deter-
rence 
to 
achieve 
peace 
and 
the 
denuclearization of North Korea; 
(5) emphasizes that United States Forces 
Korea (USFK) remains prepared in presence 
and disposition to counter any attempted 
third-party aggression or coercion, and relies 
on the vital contributions of the dedicated 
Korean national employees of USFK; and 
(6) reaffirms that the United States-South 
Korea alliance is a critical force to uphold 
the post-World War II liberal global order 
built by our two nations.

SENATE RESOLUTION 616—DESIG-
NATING 
JUNE 
12, 
2020, 
AS 
‘‘WOMEN VETERANS APPRECIA-
TION DAY’’ 
Mr. 
BOOKER 
(for 
himself, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, Ms. DUCKWORTH, and Mr. 
BRAUN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 616 
Whereas women have formally been a part 
of the United States Armed Forces since the 
establishment of the Army Nurse Corps in 
1901 but have informally served the United 
States since the inception of the United 
States military; 
Whereas women have served the United 
States honorably and with valor, including— 
(1) as soldiers disguised as males during 
the American Revolution and the Civil War; 
(2) as nurses during World War I and World 
War II; and 
(3) as combat helicopter pilots in Afghani-
stan; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, women con-
stitute approximately 17 percent of United 
States Armed Forces personnel on active 
duty, including— 
(1) 21 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Air Force; 
(2) 20 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Navy; 
(3) 15 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Army; 
(4) 9 percent of active duty personnel in the 
Marine Corps; and 
(5) 15 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Coast Guard; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, women con-
stitute nearly 21 percent of personnel in the 
National Guard and Reserves; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, women comprise 
nearly 25 percent of the personnel in the Na-
tional Guard and Reserves activated to sup-
port COVID–19 response efforts; 
Whereas, in 2020— 
(1) the population of women veterans 
reached 2,000,000, which represents an expo-
nential increase from 713,000 women veterans 
in 1980; and 
(2) women veterans constitute more than 
10 percent of the total veteran population; 
Whereas the United States is proud of, and 
appreciates, the service of all women vet-
erans who have demonstrated great skill, 
sacrifice, and commitment to defending the 
principles upon which the United States was 
founded and which the United States con-
tinues to uphold; 
Whereas women veterans have unique sto-
ries and should be encouraged to share their 
recollections through the Veterans History 
Project, which has worked since 2000 to col-
lect and share the personal accounts of war-
time veterans in the United States; and 
Whereas, by designating June 12, 2020, as 
‘‘Women Veterans Appreciation Day’’, the 
Senate can— 
(1) highlight the growing presence of 
women in the Armed Forces and the Na-
tional Guard; and 
(2) pay respect to women veterans for their 
dutiful military service: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates June 
12, 2020, as ‘‘Women Veterans Appreciation 
Day’’ to recognize the service and sacrifices 
of women veterans who have served valiantly 
on behalf of the United States.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
MOORE 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF 
LANE CARTER 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of former Moore 
County Sheriff Lane Carter. A strong and ex-
emplary leader, Sheriff Carter served the 
Moore County Sheriff’s Office for over thirty- 
five years. 
Sheriff Carter passed away on May 14, 
2020 and left behind a legacy of extraordinary 
accomplishment. He started his law enforce-
ment career in 1978 and rose through the 
ranks of patrol and investigations. After being 
elected Sheriff in 2002, he faithfully served 
and protected the people of Moore County 
until his retirement in 2013. 
Sheriff Carter was a compassionate public 
servant who was revered for the respect he 
afforded to all people. He treated the entire 
community as one big family and is credited 
with transforming public relations and commu-
nity outreach within the Moore County Sheriff’s 
Office. 
The greatest test to Sheriff Carter’s leader-
ship came on one of the darkest days in North 
Carolina history. On March 29, 2009, eight 
people were killed and two others wounded in 
a shooting at a Moore County nursing home. 
Sheriff Carter’s courage, strength, and his hu-
manity helped lead a brokenhearted commu-
nity through the pain and the grief. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Sheriff 
Carter’s wife, Anita; his children, Dana, Brent, 
Seth, and Ethan; and all who loved him. Sher-
iff Carter will live on in the hearts and minds 
of all who felt his kindness and I join the entire 
community in honoring his extraordinary life. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Sheriff Lane 
Carter.

Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following Proclama-
tion. 
CERTIFICATE OF CONGRESSIONAL RECOGNITION 
PRESENTED TO THE FLOYD FAMILY 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE LIFE OF MR. GEORGE PERRY 
FLOYD, JR. 
Whereas, Mr. George Perry Floyd, Jr. was 
born on October 14, 1973, to George Perry 
Floyd, Sr. and Larcenia Jones Floyd, in Fay-
etteville, North Carolina, was reared in Hous-
ton, Texas, and most recently resided in St. 
Louis Park, Minnesota, until his untimely pass-
ing; 
Whereas, Mr. George Perry Floyd, Jr. was

nity, revered for his kindness and athleticism 
having been a star football and basketball 
player at Jack Yates High School where he 
was a proud member of the class of 1993; 
Whereas, Mr. George Perry Floyd, Jr.’s 
athleticism allowed him to play both sports at 
the collegiate level—a rare but commendable 
accomplishment for any athlete, playing bas-
ketball at South Florida Community College 
and then football at Texas A&M Kingsville; 
Whereas, Mr. George Perry Floyd, Jr. met 
his tragic demise on May 25, 2020 while in 
police custody, and the events that led to his 
death have sparked a global demand for jus-
tice for George Floyd, a call to action against 
police brutality, and an end to systemic rac-
ism; and 
Whereas, Mr. George Perry Floyd, Jr. 
leaves to cherish his memory his five children, 
two grandchildren, three sisters, three broth-
ers, as well as a host of aunts, uncles, nieces, 
nephews, cousins, and close friends.

half of the constituents of the Ninth Congres-
sional District of Texas, I take great pride in

extend my heartfelt condolences to the Floyd 
Family during this time of remembrance. His 
legacy will stand the test of time.

REMEMBERING CHAIN SINGH 
SANDHU 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of the great Chain Singh 
Sandhu, who passed away on May 16th at his 
home in Northville, Michigan, after a coura-
geous, four-year battle with cancer at the age 
of 78. 
When Chain was five, his father was mur-
dered during the partition of India. His mother 
was illiterate and raised him on a small farm 
in Punjab. Despite his modest upbringing, 
Sandhu had big dreams. 
He came to the U.S. in 1969 with his wife, 
child, and eight dollars in his pocket. Though 
there were few opportunities for foreign engi-
neers, he found a job on the assembly line at 
General Motors and eventually earned a posi-
tion as a development engineer. At the time of 
his promotion, he was the first Indian ever to 
achieve a senior engineering title at General 
Motors. 
In 1986, Mr. Sandhu took the opportunity to 
run a small company named NYX with declin-
ing revenues and a cash crisis. By 1989, he 
had purchased NYX. His dream was to create 
a company where people of all backgrounds, 
religions, and languages would be welcome. 
Today, the Livonia-based automotive supply 
company is a multinational organization with 
17 locations and 4,200 employees in five 
countries. 
For decades, Mr. Sandhu assisted hundreds 
of students and families immigrating to the 
U.S. He worked to provide an immediate com-
munity landing spot and professional growth 
opportunities, taking pride in watching the chil-
dren of his employees become valued mem-
bers of their communities and citizens of this 
country that he dearly loved. 
Chain spent his final days at home on his 
farm in Northville surrounded by family. He 
was preceded in death by his brother, Raghbir 
Sandhu, 
and 
his 
daughter, 
Ramandeep 
Sandhu. He is survived by his wife Satwant, 
his brother Ram, his sons and their spouses: 
Jay (Roop) and Mick (Jessica); his four grand-
children who were the apples of his eyes: 
Nirvair, Naveen, Rajan, and Rohan; as well as 
the 4,200 employees of NYX he considered 
his family, and the indelible mark he left in a 
circle of people far and wide. 
He will be remembered for being a fiercely 
loyal companion, father, grandfather, and 
friend, and for his positive outlook on life. 
‘‘Every day is a good day’’ was a phrase he 
said each day, which is a memory that will 
continue to inspire everyone who knew him.

HONORING DR. CLINTON VASSETT 
TURNER, SR. 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to honor and rec-
ognize the esteemed Dr. Clinton Vassett Tur-
ner, Sr., a public servant and educator who 
dedicated his life to promoting the welfare of 
others. 
Dr. Turner left a lasting legacy, and the 
Commonwealth of Virginia is indebted to him 
for his years of service to our institutions of 
higher education. I greatly admire his dedica-
tion to academia, and the capable leadership 
that he brought to the roles he assumed, in-
cluding at Virginia State University, Virginia 
Tech, and the Virginia state government. 
As the first African-American in the nation to 
hold a cabinet-level position in a state depart-
ment of agriculture, Dr. Turner succeeded in 
the face of adversity and became a role model 
for young people across our Commonwealth. 
Dr. Turner was recognized countless times for 
his remarkable achievements, including receiv-
ing the 1994 Virginia Man of the Year Award, 
and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State 
University Agricultural Alumni Organization 
Distinguished Service Citation. I am especially 
pleased to see his name memorialized as the 
first Virginian in the George Washington 
Carver Public Service Hall of Fame. 
Dr. Turner challenged us to work with hum-
ble devotion to improve the lives of those 
around us, and I have no doubt that his legacy 
will continue to inspire generations of young 
men and women to pursue a life of service 
through academic excellence. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in expressing our deepest condolences to 
Dr. Turner’s family, and in honoring his life’s 
work.

CELEBRATING 140 YEARS OF DIP-
LOMATIC RELATIONS WITH RO-
MANIA 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. NUNES. Madam Speaker, I rise along 
with Representatives MIKE CONAWAY, MICHAEL 
TURNER, BRAD WENSTRUP, CHRIS STEWART, 
RICK CRAWFORD, ELISE STEFANIK, and WILL 
HURD, to celebrate 140 years of diplomatic re-
lations between the United States and Roma-
nia. 
Whereas, the United States established dip-
lomatic relations with Romania in June 1880; 
Whereas, the United States regards Roma-
nia as an important ally in Central and South-
east Europe, which is setting an example of 
steady commitment to democratic leadership, 
national and transatlantic security, and eco-
nomic development; 
Whereas, the United States and Romania 
have developed a strategic partnership built 
on longstanding friendship, historical ties and 
a joint promise to advancing the security and 
prosperity of their citizens and communities; 
Whereas, the United States recognizes and 
appreciates Romania’s lasting efforts to mod-
ernize its armed forces and meet its NATO 
burden-sharing commitments as one of the 
leading NATO members to allocate 2 percent 
of its gross domestic product (GDP) for de-
fense spending; 
Whereas, the Romanian Armed Forces 
have supported NATO and United States op-
erations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other thea-
tres for almost two decades, contributing more 
than 30,000 total combat and support per-
sonnel to those missions, fighting alongside 
U.S. service members, and helping to protect 
vital security interests; 
Whereas, Romania as a member of the 
Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS has deployed 
military trainers to train Iraqi Security Forces, 
provided humanitarian assistance to the peo-
ple of Iraq arid Syria, and is making remark-
able efforts to support combatting international 
terrorism, including through critical intelligence 
sharing with Coalition partners; 
Whereas, Romania has been a leading na-
tion in providing cybersecurity support to 
NATO and its partners, and the first country to 
have entered into a Memorandum of Under-
standing with the U.S. Government on the se-
cure implementation of fifth generation wire-
less communications (5G) technology aimed 
at protecting critical security infrastructure from 
disruption and interference; 
Whereas, Romania has been a driving force 
leading to the establishment of the Three 
Seas Initiative, and one of the first countries to 
invest in the Three Seas Initiative Investment 
Fund, which aims at increasing energy inde-
pendence 
and 
infrastructure 
connectivity 
across Central Europe thereby strengthening 
the United States and European security; 
Whereas, Romania has been a champion of 
energy security in Europe, supporting the U.S. 
Government’s Partnership for Transatlantic 
Energy Cooperation (P–TEC) initiative as 
leading partner on civil nuclear energy, helping 
to develop the next generation of nuclear tech-
nologies, and entering into a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the U.S. Government on 
strategic civil nuclear cooperation; 
Whereas, the United States and Romania 
have been deepening their economic relation-
ship through increased bilateral trade and in-
vestment, and Romania in 2017 hosted the 
tenth annual U.S. Commercial Service Trade 
Winds Forum and Trade Mission, helping 
American companies boost exports across 
Southeast Europe; 
Whereas, the Governments of the United 
States and Romania are working closely to-
gether to develop an ambitious bilateral eco-
nomic, trade, and investment agenda, includ-
ing through driving a record attendance over 
the past three consecutive years by more than 
50 Romanian companies to the United States 
SelectUSA Summit; 
Whereas, in 2018, as Romania celebrated 
its Unification Centennial, Governors from al-
most all 50 U.S. States issued Proclamations 
to congratulate Romanians and Romanian- 
Americans on that historic milestone, illus-
trating the close ties and friendship that exist 
between our nations and our people; 
Whereas, during the first half of 2019 Ro-
mania conducted its first Presidency of the 
Council of the European Union and promoted 
a successful agenda advancing important 
U.S.-EU goals such as energy security, intel-
lectual property, human rights and regional co-
operation across the Balkans and the Black 
Sea area; 
Whereas, in 2019 Romanians all across 
America commemorated 30 years since Ro-
mania’s liberation from the former communist 
regime, a powerful reminder of the fall of the 
Iron Curtain in 1989 and a celebration of the 
triumphant call of freedom, liberty and dignity; 
Whereas, over more than a century succes-
sive generations of Romanian-Americans have 
contributed their resources of talent and entre-
preneurship to American progress, and their 
rich cultural heritage represents a most pre-
cious feature of the American society; 
Whereas, during these times of unprece-
dented challenge caused by the Covid–19 
pandemic crisis the United States and Roma-
nia are strengthening their partnership, helping 
each other in meaningful ways such as U.S. 
assistance with targeted funds and medical 
emergency equipment, and Romanian support 
for the swift repatriation of U.S. nationals over-
seas, and working together to enhance their 
mutual security and economic recovery and 
prosperity; 
Whereas, as a sign of solidarity and friend-
ship between the Romanian and the American 
people, Romania has sent its first medical and 
expert support and advisory mission to the 
State of Alabama, assigning 15 Romanian 
doctors, medical staff and chemical and bio-
logical risk experts to exchange best practices 
and assist local Covid–19 efforts in care facili-
ties, nursing homes and hospitals across Ala-
bama, thus strengthening our mutual capabili-
ties to fight the virus pandemic and protect the 
health and lives of our citizens; 
Whereas, 2020 marks the 140th anniversary 
of diplomatic relations between the United 
States and Romania: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) celebrates the 140th anniversary of dip-
lomatic relations between the United States 
and Romania and congratulates Romania and 
the Romanian people for their historic achieve-
ments as a nation and their steadfast pursuit 
of democratic, political, social and economic 
progress;

United States and Romania, based on their 
common commitment to the values of free-
dom, liberal democracy, rule of law and eco-
nomic prosperity;

solidarity, and its leadership and contribution

He played offensive line at Indiana Univer-
sity from 2000 to 2004 and on three state 
championship-winning teams during his high 
school years at Cathedral High School. 
As a businessman, Chris managed several 
nightclubs in Indianapolis and owned his own 
events promotion, company, Fresh Marketing, 
LLC. 
Chris is survived by his mother, Debra A. 
Beaty-Cooper; father, Robert E. Beaty; sisters, 
Rhonda Cooper and Tracee Cooper, as well 
as seven nieces and nephews. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Chris Beaty. His impact on our com-
munity will not soon be forgotten. We lost a 
Hoosier Hero to a senseless act of violence, 
and our city mourns.

IN HONOR OF FRANK JOHN 
HENDRICKS, JR. 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Frank John Hendricks, Jr. Mr. Hen-
dricks lives in Lexington, Kentucky and cele-
brates his 101st birthday on July 6th. 
Mr. Hendricks joined the United States Army 
during World War II. He served with the 550th 
Army Airborne Glider Battalion and attained 
the rank of Sergeant First Class. He flew glid-
ers and fought in battles in North Africa, Sicily, 
Burma, Normandy, and all across Europe. He 
was a part of the D-Day invasion. He partici-
pated in the Battle of the Bulge and the inva-
sion of Germany, leading to the end of the war 
in Europe. As a glider pilot, he flew and fought 
behind enemy lines to drive the enemy into 
the U. S. Army front lines. He led a reconnais-
sance team to identify the enemy positions 
and determine the terrain for future glider mis-
sions. 
It is my honor to recognize Mr. Hendricks, 
celebrate his 101st birthday, and thank him for 
his service and sacrifice to our nation during 
World War II. As a part of ‘‘The Greatest Gen-
eration’’, Mr. Hendricks and his fellow soldiers 
fought to preserve the freedoms that we enjoy 
today, and we can never thank them enough. 
I am forever grateful for Americans like Frank 
John Hendricks, Jr.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JASON 
NORTON 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. 
Jason L. Norton, who sadly lost his battle 
against cancer last Wednesday. 
Jason was a native of Hamlet, North Caro-
lina and learned of his passion for helping oth-
ers and athletics early in his life. 
After graduating from Richmond Senior High 
School in 1990, Jason earned a Bachelor of 
Arts degree in Sociology from Catawba Col-
lege and a Master’s Degree in School Admin-
istration and Curriculum from the University of 
North Carolina at Pembroke. Jason served as 
a role model to many young people in Rich-
mond County, where he taught mathematics 
while coaching football, baseball, and basket-
ball. 
Jason would later become the Assistant 
Principal and Athletic Director for Pine Forest 
High School in Fayetteville, where he re-
mained dedicated lo the academic and athletic 
success of his students. He served as a men-
tor to all and was always eager to lend a help-
ing hand. Jason led the Educational Based 
Athletics program at Pine Forest and coordi-
nated the annual Play for Kay basketball fund-
raiser, which has raised thousands to advance 
research for women’s cancer. While Jason 
loved lo train student athletes, he instilled val-
ues of teamwork, perseverance and commit-
ment in all his students. 
Before starting his career in education, 
Jason served as the Assistant Parks and 
Recreation Director for the City of Hamlet for 
over a decade. He served as a referee, a 
scheduler, and anything else that was needed, 
living out the principles of service and dedica-
tion he spent his life teaching. 
Jason was a pillar in his community and 
was loved by all who knew him. He fought 
until his very last day with us. He is survived 
by his wife, Lauren, and his three children. 
While Jason left us far too young, he had a 
lasting impact on the lives of young people 
and created a community of folks connected 
by his leadership. 
Jason’s passing represents a grave loss in 
Hamlet and across North Carolina. May his 
selfless dedication and passion be an example 
for us all.

come their newest addition of pure pride and

of the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of 
America (BSA) as they undertake the BSA 
Mapathon. 
Headquartered in Hawaii’s First Congres-
sional District, the Aloha Council prepares 
young people in Hawai‘i to make ethical and 
moral choices throughout their lifetime by in-
stilling in them the traditional Hawaiian values 
of responsibility (kuleana), helpfulness (ko¯kua) 
and taking of the land (ma¯lama i ka ’a¯ina) with 
aloha. 
The BSA launched the BSA Mapathon on 
May 8, 2020. This national effort encourages 
Scouts to contribute to the Missing Maps 
Project. This project will update and improve 
the Red Cross’ maps for regions at the great-
est risk of humanitarian crises. The Missing 
Maps Project enables anyone with access to 
a computer to participate in humanitarian map-
ping by crowdsourcing volunteer efforts using 
a free and open-source mapping software. 
In Hawai‘i, the Aloha Council has embodied 
the values of responsibility (kuleana) by ad-
vancing the mission of humanitarian mapping. 
Their helpfulness (ko¯kua) in this noble national 
effort and their taking care of the land 
(ma¯lama i ka ’a¯ina) with their act of aloha will 
be remembered in Hawai‘i and our nation, es-
pecially if there is new crisis. 
I am proud to join with the Scouts in pro-
moting humanitarian mapping, especially in 
Hawai‘i where we have done so while pro-
moting Hawaiian cultural values. I urge the 
House of Representatives to recognize the 
work of the Aloha Council and other councils 
throughout our nation who have joined in on 
this important endeavor.

HONORING EAGAN RESIDENT RICK 
KLEVEN 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise together 
with my Minnesota colleague Representative 
EMMER to honor my Eagan constituent, Rich-
ard ‘‘Rick’’ Kleven, on the incredible milestone 
of his retirement from Thrivent this month after 
more than 39 years of dedicated service. It 
has been a great experience working with 
Rick through the years and knowing his pas-
sion for Thrivent’s unique mission as a fra-
ternal benefit society connecting financial se-
curity and community impact. 
A lifelong Minnesotan and proud ‘‘Iron- 
Ranger’’ who grew up in Grand Rapids, MN, 
Rick is a true Minnesota sports team fan, par-
ticularly a diehard for our Vikings. He received 
his J.D. from the University of Minnesota Law 
School and his B.A. from the University of 
Minnesota–Duluth. Rick has led Thrivent’s 
Government Affairs activities for more than 17 
years, and served previously in a number of 
roles as legal counsel and manager of cor-
porate legal functions within the organization 
through his long arc of service which began in 
1981 when Thrivent was Lutheran Brother-
hood. 
Rick has been a great advocate on policy 
matters on Thrivent’s behalf, but also walks 
the walk of Thrivent’s mission of service— 
something he learned from both of his par-
ents, including his Dad who was awarded 
Itasca County’s Outstanding Senior Volunteer 
of the Year in 2018. Rick has volunteered as 
a Big Brother, served as a board member for 
multiple nonprofit organizations, and epito-
mizes the ubiquitous Thrivent t-shirt that says 
‘‘Live Generously.’’ Recently, he served as 
Chairman of the Board of Gilda’s Club Twin 
Cities, and played a crucial role in helping to 
raise money to build the organization’s club-
house that provides support for people with 
cancer as well as their families and friends. 
Rick also served for 8 years on the board of 
Person to Person, a charitable organization 
that operates Meals on Wheels and various 
other programs to help the needy in the Twin 
Cities area. He also was part of the original 
start-up board of FINNEGANS, the first beer 
company in the world to donate 100 percent of 
profits back to local food shelves. Rick cur-
rently sits on the board of the American Fra-
ternal Alliance, the nationwide coalition of not- 
for-profit fraternal benefit societies. 
I know that Representative EMMER and I 
speak for many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle from Minnesota and beyond 
when I say that Rick’s presence will be missed 
here in DC. However, I hope to see Rick back 
home most likely either walking his dogs or 
still Living Generously helping our neighbors in 
need. We wish Rick the best in retirement. 
Congratulations.

RECOGNIZING TODD SPANGLER OF 
WHITEFISH 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Todd Spangler of Whitefish for 
providing his community with personal protec-
tive equipment during the COVID–19 out-
break. 
In March, Todd read about how a group in 
Billings created a 3D printer design for the 
‘‘Montana Mask.’’ The developers released the 
design and free open-source software to the 
public so others could produce the mask. 
Around that time, Todd’s wife, who works 
with a local ophthalmologist, told him the prac-
tice had about a week’s supply of masks. 
Todd, a chemistry teacher at Whitefish High 
School, contacted people he knew with 3D 
printers. In no time, an informal group of edu-
cators, physicians, and dentists started making 
the needed masks. 
Using a 3D printer from Todd’s classroom 
as well as others from Flathead Valley Com-
munity College, they got to work. In no time, 
the group produced 600 masks. Todd deliv-
ered the masks throughout the Flathead Val-
ley, including to independent health care prac-
tices, 
providers 
at 
Kalispell 
Regional 
Healthcare, and first responders throughout 
the region. 
Todd says the effort helped him find pur-
pose during the crisis. He admits being under 
quarantine was challenging for him and many 
Montanans but identifying a need and taking 
the initiative to help fulfill that need have guid-
ed him. When your families and friends need 
masks, Todd says, you must find a way to 
protect your loved ones and coworkers. For 
Todd, this crisis, while devastating for a lot of 
people, has brought out the best in so many. 
Madam Speaker, for taking the initiative and 
leading a project to protect Montanans in a 
time of crisis, I recognize Todd Spangler of 
Whitefish for his Spirit of Montana.

CELEBRATING 
CHRISTIAN 
GUZMAN’S 
ENTREPRENEURIAL 
SPIRIT 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an incredible entrepreneur in 
Stafford, Texas that is sharing his love of fit-
ness with our community. 
Christian Guzman does not view his job as 
simply work—to him, it’s his passion. Building 
his ‘‘playground’’ is his American Dream, and 
he is passionately pursuing it. 
At only 27 years old, Mr. Guzman has used 
social media to build up his business, starting 
from an online-only presence to being in 
charge of his own physical gym. Mr. Guzman 
has built up an immense following, not only in 
TX–22 but around the world, drawing an audi-
ence of more than one million fitness enthu-
siasts online. 
Now, thanks to his hard work and entrepre-
neurial 
spirit, 
Mr. 
Guzman’s 
business, 
Alphalete Gym, will be expanding into a com-
plex of gyms that will eventually feature a 
hotel and restaurant. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Guzman’s incredible 
accomplishment shows that through deter-
mination, hard work and perseverance, any 
person can build their own ‘‘playground’’ and 
find success while doing it. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I’d like to congratulate 
Mr. Guzman on his continued success.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E531 
June 11, 2020 
Schmidt, U.S. Army, Retired, of Anchorage, 
for his years of dedicated service to the United 
States of America. 
SGM Schmidt’s military career spanned 22 
years, over three decades, and three wars. 
What is even more remarkable than his years 
of dedicated military service, is how it began. 
In 1942, at the age of 14, SGM Schmidt lied 
about his age, joined the Army, and was sent 
off to training. He would go on to jump into 
Sicily with the 82nd Airborne Division during 
the war at just 15 years old. Subsequently, he 
was wounded and discharged once his true 
age was discovered after his mother wrote a 
letter to President Franklin Roosevelt regard-
ing her underage son fighting in the war. 
Undeterred, SGM Schmidt would once again 
lie about his age and join the Navy. However, 
after several months in the Navy, they would 
also find his age and remove him from serv-
ice. 
Thankfully, his determination to serve did 
not stop at the end of World War II. In 1946, 
at the age of 18, he would rejoin the Army and 
eventually fight in the Battle of the Chosin 
Reservoir in the Korean War. He would later 
go on to be accepted into, and serve in, Spe-
cial Forces. As a member of the 7th Special 
Forces Group, SGM Schmidt would fight in 
Vietnam and Laos during the Vietnam War. 
Eventually, he became the Sergeant Major for 
all 7th Group’s A Teams in Vietnam before 
moving to the 5th Special Forces Group. In 
1965 SGM Schmidt would return to Fort Bragg 
and retire after 22 years of honorable service. 
However, retirement clearly did not sit well 
with the Sergeant Major. He returned to Viet-
nam, for a few years as a member of Air 
America, a passenger and cargo airline that 
was secretly owned and operated by the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. SGM Schmidt is one 
of very few soldiers who has two stars on his 
Combat Infantryman Badge; he was also the 
recipient of the Silver Star with one Oak Leaf 
Cluster, Bronze Star Medal with two Oak Leaf 
Clusters, and the Purple Heart Medal with one 
Oak Left Cluster. 
It is my honor to recognize the selfless serv-
ice and sacrifice of SGM Schmidt on behalf of 
a grateful Nation.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
LEWIS FARMER REEVES, JR. 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the remarkable life of 
Lewis Farmer Reeves, Jr., of Clayton, Geor-
gia, who went to be with the Lord just last 
month. For 82 years, Lewis stood as a pillar 
of the community. 
After graduating from Rabun County High 
School and attending the Georgia Institute of 
Technology, Lewis committed his life’s work to 
his family’s business, Reeves Hardware. Dur-
ing his 55 years serving as President, he ex-
panded the company to additional locations in 
Dillard and Clayton, creating countless jobs 
across our community in northeast Georgia. 
Now, three generations of the Reeves family 
have followed in his legacy of carrying on the 
family business. 
Beyond his family business, Lewis further 
dedicated himself to his community by serving 
in a number of capacities. He served on the 
Rabun County School Board of Education 
from 1966 to 1984 and continued to give back 
to the next generation through his involvement 
with Future Farmers of America and Livestock 
Shows teams. A lifelong member of the Clay-
ton First United Methodist Church, founding 
member of the Walnut Flat’s Hunting Club, 
and an active member of the Clayton Volun-
teer Fire Department, there is hardly a facet of 
community life where Lewis has not left a 
positive impact. 
The loss of Lewis Reeves is a loss that will 
be felt by our entire community. I can tell you 
firsthand that his spirit of service is apparent 
each time I visit one of his stores, and his leg-
acy will continue to live on through his family 
business. On behalf of the people of Northeast 
Georgia, I join his family in mourning the loss 
of a life well lived, and I thank Lewis for leav-
ing this world better than he found it. May he 
rest in peace.

REMEMBERING AJAIB KAUR 
DHADLI 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS

Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Ajaib Kaur Dhadli, who 
passed away on May 12th at the age of 94. 
Born in Pakistan on March 26, 1926, Ajaib 
Kaur Dhadli was the oldest of five sisters of 
Ajit Singh and Sant Kaur. Ajaib Kaur was mar-
ried to late Sardar Harchand Singh Dhadli in 
1946, until his passing in 2015. Throughout 
the course of her life, she worked tirelessly 
throughout the house, while also raising her 
three children, Raminder Singh, Baljinder Kaur 
and Raminder Kaur. She was instrumental in 
molding her children which helped them find 
success in their careers and lives. As they 
grew older and had children of their own, Ajaib 
helped raise her grandchildren with pride. 
Those closest to Ajaib Kaur Dhadli would de-
scribe her as hard working, nurturing, and a 
woman of faith. 
Ajaib Kaur Dhadli is survived by her sisters 
Inderjit Kaur, Narinder Kaur and Kanwaljit 
Kaur, 
son, 
Raminder 
Singh, 
daughters 
Raminder Kaur, and Baljinder Kaur, five 
grandchildren 
including 
Shamsher 
Singh, 
Harleen Kaur, Amneet Kaur, Tejveer Singh 
and Harjap Singh, as well as four great grand-
children Kiran, Jasleen, Arjun and Tegvir. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in reflecting on the special life of Ajaib 
Kaur Dhadli.

MARK 
ANTHONY 
‘TONY’ DUNCAN 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to honor and recognize our friend, 
Mark Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Duncan who passed 
away on Saturday, June 6, 2020. 
Tony was a lifelong public servant, engaged 
civic leader, and activist. He dedicated himself 
to service for decades, first as Center Town-
ship Deputy Trustee to my grandmother, the 
late Congresswoman Julia Carson, when she 
served as Township Trustee. He later served 
when he was elected as the Center Township 
Constable in Marion County, a position he 
held until his passing, where he was leg-
endary for serving justice with compassion. 
As a lifelong Democrat, Tony advocated for 
the Democratic Party, holding all accountable 
for their actions and changing the electorate of 
Marion County, Indiana. He served as the 
Treasurer for the Marion County Democratic 
Party and worked tirelessly to elect local 
Democratic candidates. His passion and 
knowledge of our community will not soon be 
forgotten. 
On a personal note, Tony served as my life-
long mentor, confidant, and friend. Beginning 
at a young age, Tony took me under his 
wings, imparting political wisdom. He was part 
of my family, and always there if you needed 
him. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Tony Duncan, a dear friend, fellow 
Democrat, and public servant who will be 
dearly missed by me, as well as his family, 
friends, and community.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF WILMA WILSON 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Wilma H. 
Wilson of Charlotte, North Carolina on her 
100th birthday. 
Mrs. Wilson is a long time native of Char-
lotte, and currently resides in the South Park 
neighborhood. She and her husband spent 
their lives spreading God’s word as devoted 
Christians. And—as all who know her can at-
test—she embodies what she believes and 
sets an example for us all. 
Mrs. Wilson and her husband, Grady, were 
close friends of evangelist Billy Graham early 
in his life. The two quickly became involved in 
the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association 
(BGEA), and Grady became a top associate 
from its founding to his death in the late 
1980s. Mrs. Wilson had extensive involvement 
in the BGEA television and radio broadcasting 
department, where she was integral in making 
Billy Graham’s famous Crusades accessible to 
thousands. 
Wilma’s work stretched the reach of the 
message of Christ and helped spread the 
news of God’s love to many for the first time. 
Mrs. Wilson is the last surviving member of 
the founding generation of the Billy Graham 
Evangelistic Association. Her commitment to 
spreading God’s word has impacted millions of 
people in the United Stales and made our 
world a better place. 
It is an honor to wish Wilma Wilson a very 
happy 100th birthday.

STAGECOACH 
ELE-
MENTARY SCHOOL 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize the teachers and staff at 
Stagecoach Elementary School in Cabot, Ar-
kansas for going above and beyond for their 
students during the current public health crisis 
due to COVID–19. 
They have adapted their teaching process 
to ensure they are meeting the academic 
needs of their students, but they are also find-
ing creative ways to maintain relationships 
with students, their families, and the commu-
nity. 
The teachers and staff have gone above 
and beyond by delivering groceries to families 
in need, continuing to offer breakfast and 
lunch for their students, providing supplies like 
laptops to families who may not have the nec-
essary equipment for at-home learning, and 
conducting parades throughout the student’s 
neighborhoods to lift spirits, and bring the 
community together. 
This initiative has shined a light on how 
adapting to the situation at hand and respond-
ing with positivity can unite a community even 
amidst a public health crisis. 
I congratulate the teachers and staff at 
Stagecoach Elementary School for their cre-
ative way of continuing education for Arkansas 
students and for ending the year on a strong 
note.

BEARDED BAKER OF TX–22 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, we often tell 
our children that, when life gives you lemons, 
you make lemonade. When life gave Allan 
Hursig lemons, he made cookies and created 
a thriving business. 
After being ‘‘unfortunately, but fortunately 
laid off’ from his job as an oil and gas 
landman, Mr. Hursig turned to baking as a 
hobby. His elaborately decorated cookies 
found fame on the Internet, and he launched 
The Bearded Baker in 2016 to take his hobby 
to the next level. 
Mr. Hursig’s sweet treats garnered so much 
popularity that he even competed on the Food 
Network’s ‘‘Christmas Cookie Challenge.’’ 
Mr. Hursig is living proof of that creativity, 
artistry and perseverance are tools for suc-
cess in our great nation. On behalf of the 
Twenty-Second 
Congressional 
District 
of 
Texas, he has made our community very 
proud.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
DEFENSE 
NET 
ZERO 
REVIEW 
ACT OF 2020 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the National Defense Net 
Zero Review Act of 2020, legislation that will 
refocus the Defense Department’s (DoD’s) ef-
forts on Net Zero initiatives and require the 
Secretary to establish the first integrated mas-
ter plan for achieving Net Zero energy bench-
marks. 
The DoD consumes more energy than any 
other federal agency, spending nearly $12 bil-
lion on energy in FY2017, approximately two 
percent of the Department’s total budget. 
Since the early 2000s, the DoD has made 
commendable progress in implementing Net 
Zero projects. These initiatives have generally 
focused on efforts to produce more energy 
from renewable sources on installations, limit 
consumption of water in order to not deplete 
the local watershed, and reduce, reuse, and 
recover waste to prevent unnecessary addi-
tions to landfills. 
Unfortunately, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while 
progress has been made, it simply isn’t 
enough. In fact, many of the energy bench-
marks established by previous acts of Con-
gress have never been achieved by the DoD, 
and many of the goals announced by senior 
DoD leaders over the past decade are no 
longer being pursued. To quote from the find-
ings from a 2016 Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) study—the most systemic review 
of Net Zero with the DoD—the Department 
has ‘‘not established an integrated net zero 
strategy or policy for achieving Net Zero,’’ and 
‘‘none of the military departments have estab-
lished Net Zero as a funded program’’. Fur-
ther, the DoD has not fully identified the po-
tential costs of implementing net zero initia-
tives, due at least in part to insufficiently de-
fined statutory goals. 
On the operational side of energy usage, 
DoD emissions for all military operations be-
tween 2001 and 2017 are estimated to be 766 
million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The 
FY2017 Operational Energy Annual Report 
found that the Department used roughly 87 
million barrels of fuel per year, which comes 
out to some 240,000 barrels per day. These 
findings paint a clear picture, that absent Con-
gressional interest and oversight, pursuing and 
achieving Net Zero will not be prioritized in the 
way that it should be. 
The legislation that I am introducing today 
will get us back on track with a wholesale re-
view of Net Zero initiatives under the DoD. 
First, my bill commissions two studies from the 
Comptroller General of the United States—a 
follow-up to the 2016 study and a second ex-
amining options for increasing efficiency and 
resilience on the operational side of the DoD’s 
energy usage—that will analyze the extent to 
which these types of initiatives have been im-
plemented, and the associated costs, benefits, 
challenges, and opportunities that exist for 
moving forward. These studies also solicit new 
information from the DoD, including antici-
pated funding and infrastructure needs to get 
serious about achieving Net Zero, and options 
for achieving specific benchmarks. Once this 
information is at hand, my legislation requires 
the Secretary of the DoD to present Congress 
with a master plan outlining an integrated 
strategy for achieving these initiatives in a 
manner that continues to prioritize military 
readiness. 
Importantly, Madam Speaker, my bill does 
not impose any arbitrary deadlines or require-
ments of the DoD. Rather, this legislation fo-
cuses on gathering the data we need to know 
what is feasible, what we’ll need to get it 
done, and how much time it will take, so that 
Congress can make informed decisions in the 
future. This is the right way to move forward, 
and I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COVID–19 
MEMORIAL QUILT ACT OF 2020 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 11, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to introduce the COVID–19 Me-
morial Quilt Act of 2020 to honor all the vic-
tims of this pandemic with a national memorial 
quilt. 
The horrors of the COVID–19 pandemic 
have touched every corner of our country, 
wreaking unprecedented devastation on Amer-
icans’ lives. As I introduce this legislation 
today, COVID–19 has infected at least two 
million Americans. Tragically, this disease has 
quickly robbed our country of at least 112,000 
of our fellow citizens. We need to remember 
that these numbers are not just statistics: they 
are people. They are our moms, dads, chil-
dren, grandparents, neighbors, teachers, reli-
gious leaders and fellow Americans who have 
been taken from us due to this pandemic.

June 11, 2020 
Moreover, these numbers do not capture 
the depth of this disease’s devastation. While 
our television screens are often filled with im-
ages of empty streets and packed hospitals, 
we often don’t see the private isolation and 
loneliness of the individual struggles against 
COVID–19. In order to slow the spread of this 
disease, our hospitals, nursing homes, funeral 
homes, and businesses have had to impose 
strict social distancing and protective meas-
ures. While necessary for our public health, 
these restrictions come at a great human cost 
and deepen the private pain caused by this 
disease. 
For the thousands of brave patients fighting 
COVID–19, including the hospitalized patients, 
nursing home residents, and individuals at 
home in quarantine, the struggle against 
COVID–19 is a lonely, scary, and isolating 
fight. In hospitals and nursing homes, often a 
patient’s only human contact is a health care 
worker in full personal protective equipment 
(PPE). Family, friends, and loved ones can’t 
be there to provide comfort, to hold their 
hands, or to pray with them in this terrifying 
time. At best, loving words and support might 
be shared over the telephone or video call. At 
worst, there is only an isolating silence where 
a loved one should be. These scars need to 
be acknowledged and hopefully healed. 
The death toll from COVID–19 is even more 
wrenching. At least 112,000 Americans— 
whether in the hospital, the nursing home, or 
at home—have met the end of their lives with-
out the comfort of their family, friends, or loved 
ones. Yesterday, more than 1,100 Americans 
died from this disease, and many were forced 
to close their eyes without the support of their 
loved ones nearby. 
We know that at least 40,600 deaths from 
COVID–19—close 
to 
40 
percent 
of 
all 
deaths—have occurred in a nursing home, 
where restrictions are especially tight, and visi-
tations curtailed. In my home state of Indiana, 
we have lost at least 1,011 Hoosiers to 
COVID–19 at nursing homes. 
We also know that African Americans are 
dying at disproportionate rates from COVID– 
19. African Americans in Indiana, despite rep-
resenting 9.8 percent of the state’s population, 
account for 15.1 percent of deaths from 
COVID–19. Institutional racism, compounded 
by environmental and economic injustices, 
have made COVID–19 particularly devastating 
for African Americans. My heart grieves for my 
fellow Americans who took their last breath, 
because of this terrible disease, without the 
loving comfort and support they deserved. 
For the family, friends, and loved ones of 
those who died from COVID–19, the isolation 
and loneliness brought by this disease only 
grows after their loved one’s passing. Social 
distancing and the isolating fear of this dis-
ease prevent us from adequately honoring and 
memorializing the many victims of COVID–19. 
Large memorial services are not possible. 
Family gatherings to celebrate lost loved ones 
are curtailed, with supportive hugs replaced by 
six feet of distance and protective masks. Pri-
vate funeral services—if not cancelled or post-
poned altogether—have often had to take 
place with only 10 people or less. 
In addition to its sickness, death, and dis-
ruption, COVID–19 has robbed us of tradi-
tional ways of honoring our lost loved ones. 
Holding smaller funerals or forgoing them en-
tirely because of social distancing measures 
has denied us the opportunity to fully cele-
brate the lives of the deceased. Our ability to 
publicly grieve together, and to adequately 
honor and celebrate the lost has been largely 
denied due to this isolating and frightening dis-
ease. 
Many Americans will also remember another 
isolating and frightening disease: the AIDS 
epidemic. Ryan White, a brave and remark-
able Hoosier, faced isolation and many fright-
ening obstacles because of his AIDS diag-
nosis. However, Ryan’s courage, bravery, and 
advocacy for AIDS research galvanized many 
in support of AIDS treatment, research and 
recognition of this disease’s horrific impact. 
Since no official commemoration existed, con-
cerned Americans decided to celebrate and 
honor the lives of those who died from AIDS— 
often isolated and alone—by creating a me-
morial quilt. As a result, in 1987, the NAMES 
Project AIDS Memorial Quilt was displayed 
and stretched the length of the National Mall. 
This remarkable quilt allowed us to honor and 
celebrate the lives of those tragically lost to a 
frightening disease, which at that time, had no 
cure, vaccine or effective treatment. More than 
105,000 individual lives are commemorated 
through this quilt’s 50,000 individual panels 
that contain photographs, correspondence, 
and news clippings to remember those who 
died from AIDS. In these panels, the memory 
of the victims were able to live on in public 
view. 
Inspired by the brave advocacy and power-
ful legacy of the NAMES Project AIDS Memo-
rial Quilt, I am proud to introduce the COVID– 
19 Memorial Quilt Act of 2020. This legislation 
honors and celebrates the lives of those we 
have lost to the COVID–19 pandemic through 
the creation of a memorial quilt. Like the AIDS 
quilt, creating a memorial quilt to remember 
the lives lost due to COVID–19 will allow 
Americans to publicly grieve our lost loved 
ones, but also commemorate their lives in per-
manent, visible, and dignified way. 
The COVID–19 Memorial Quilt Act of 2020 
authorizes the design, creation, and display of 
a memorial quilt and other commemorative 
programming and exhibits to honor the victims 
of the COVID–19 pandemic. My legislation 
does this by creating a Congressional Advi-
sory Panel which will submit plans to the 
Smithsonian Institution and the American 
Folklife Center at the Library of Congress for 
how the quilt should be developed and dis-
played. Once complete, this memorial quilt will 
be displayed on the United State Capitol 
Grounds with a subsequent display on the Na-
tional Mall and other locations, continuing the 
legacy of the AIDS quilt. This legislation also 
supports the powerful creativity of artists 
around the country by providing them with 
grants from the National Endowment of the 
Arts (NEA) to help design and prepare panels 
for the memorial quilt. 
All Americans have been affected by 
COVID–19. All have felt the disruption wrought 
by this pandemic to our families, our work-
places, our businesses, our places of worship, 
and our social lives. But that is nothing com-
pared to the Americans who have not only 
faced disruptions, but also the wrenching loss 
of loved ones from this disease. Because of 
social distancing and protective restrictions, 
we have been denied the ability to adequately 
honor, commemorate, and publicly celebrate 
those we have lost. And unfortunately, as 
more Americans continue to die in isolation 
from this disease, this deficit in our collective 
grief will only grow. As a result, my legislation 
builds on the powerful legacy of the NAMES 
Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and will help our 
country to collectively grieve and appropriately 
honor the victims of COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join us in supporting the COVID–19 Memorial 
Quilt Act of 2020, and I urge the House to 
support this legislation.
