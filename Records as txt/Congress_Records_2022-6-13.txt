CELEBRATING NATIONAL DAIRY 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, as we celebrate National 
Dairy Month this June and recognize 
the incredible work that is done by 
small dairy farms in Pennsylvania, I 
am reminded of the words written by 
Rick Harvey: ‘‘And on the eighth day, 
God looked down on his planned para-
dise and said, ‘I need a caretaker.’ So 
God made a farmer. God said, ‘I need 
somebody willing to get up before 
dawn, milk cows, work all day in the 
fields, milk cows again . . . then go to 
town and stay up past midnight at a 
meeting of the school board.’ So God 
made a farmer.’’ 
In Congress, I am proud to represent 
the incredible dairy farmers of Penn-
sylvania’s 13th Congressional District 
who operate our farms and work to 
provide the milk, the butter, the yo-
gurt, and the ice cream that Americans 
eat each and every day. 
As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the 
advantages that providing whole milk 
has for our Nation’s young people. The 
nutrients, the vitamins, that milk pro-
vides are essential to the development 
of healthy brain tissue, healthy bones, 
and healthy muscles. That is why it is 
so important that we once again have 
whole milk back in schools in the cafe-
terias so our students can have this 
each and every day. 
This June, as we celebrate National 
Dairy Month, let’s remember and let’s 
thank our farmers who do so much to 
support our health, our nutrition, our 
Nation, and each and every one of us. 
STOP RUNAWAY SPENDING 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, right now, American families 
are facing higher prices and supply 
chain shortages in our Nation’s grocery 
stores. 
Right now, the cost of beef is up 10 
percent from last year. The cost of 
bacon is up 15 percent. The cost of or-
anges is up 16 percent. Chicken is up 19 
percent. The cost of eggs is up more 
than 30 percent. 
Last week, I spoke to a mother in 
Johnstown, Pennsylvania, who told me 
that she was still unable to find baby 
food on store shelves. When she could, 
that price had shot up nearly 15 per-
cent. 
These price hikes are unsustainable, 
and as prices are rising faster than 
wages, families doing their grocery 
shopping are forced to make hard deci-
sions about what they can buy and 
what they can provide for their fami-
lies. 
Inflation is a tax on all Americans, 
and the skyrocketing costs that we are 
seeing right now are a direct result of 
President Biden’s failed policies, poli-
cies that pumped trillions of dollars 
into our economy without a second 
thought about what that money would 
do to Pennsylvania families in my dis-
trict. 
It is time to stop this runaway spend-
ing, and it is time to get our economy 
moving once again. 
f 
PROTECT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, this is 
the third time I come to the floor to 
protect our Supreme Court Justices 
and their families. Speaker PELOSI said 
this bill would come to the floor this 
week, but it is not listed on our sched-
ule. 
The Speaker also said last week in 
her press conference that ‘‘no one is in 
danger. . . .’’ 
Think about that, Mr. Speaker. The 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives, last week, in a press conference, 
said no one is in danger. This is just 
after a day or 2 when a man came clear 
across the country from California to 
kill Justice Kavanaugh. He was on the 
street, had a weapon. He had zip ties. 
He had a plan. 
At the same time, the Speaker says 
no one is in danger. But at the same 
time, the Senate already unanimously 
passed a bill with agreement from all 
100 Senators. That wasn’t passed last 
week; that was last month. 
For 1 month, the majority of this 
House, Mr. Speaker, has held that bill,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5450 
June 13, 2022 
a bill that every single Senator, Repub-
lican and Democrat and Independent, 
passed in the Senate. It simply states 
that we will protect the Supreme 
Court. 
Mr. Speaker, you have probably no-
ticed, as you came on to this Capitol, 
the intensity of force you see out in 
front of the Capitol. Is that because 
something is happening here today? 
No. It is in anticipation of a decision 
by the Supreme Court. 
Everybody in the country knows that 
there could be a decision—not knowing 
which way it would go—but the antici-
pation is that people need protection in 
the Capitol. 
At the same time that is happening, 
that you are protecting the Capitol, 
you are holding a bill to deny protec-
tion to those Justices. 
It makes me wonder why. Why? Why, 
if 100 Senators approve it, would it hold 
here for an entire month? 
Why, even after holding it for a 
month, somebody travels all the way 
across the country with one thing in 
mind, to kill a Supreme Court Justice, 
gets arrested, and still the Speaker of 
the House will not move that bill that 
the majority actually holds? 
Just so the country can understand, 
no one on this side of the aisle, the Re-
publican side of the aisle, objects to 
this bill. We agreed that we would 
agree to a unanimous consent. 
All somebody had to do was make the 
motion and that could be on the Presi-
dent’s desk; it could be signed; and 
they could be protected. 
But for some reason, Mr. Speaker, 
the Democrats on the other side of the 
aisle, even though 100 Senators had 
agreed with us, everyone in your party 
on the Senate side said ‘‘yes,’’ you still 
say ‘‘no.’’ 
I do not understand that. I do not un-
derstand why we would risk that. I do 
not understand why you will make sure 
the Capitol is protected right now, 
knowing that something could happen 
in the Supreme Court this week, but 
you won’t protect those Justices. 
Now, the Speaker came to the floor 
at a press conference last week and 
said nobody, no one, is in danger. How 
can you make that statement in the 
same week someone is arrested in your 
neighborhood trying to kill you? It 
makes no sense. 
Mr. Speaker, if for some reason that 
we continue to come to the floor, that 
you feel some pressure on that bill, but 
you change it, the country will know 
why because if you change the bill and 
move it back to the Senate, you are 
trying to kill it. You are trying to 
delay it. That is exactly what you are 
doing. 
You can take a bill that every single 
Senator voted for and send it to the 
President to be signed. If you think 
something else needs to be added, run 
it by itself. 
But if you want to ping-pong it and 
delay the process, I think that is 
wrong. I think you are jeopardizing 
people’s lives. I think you are jeopard-
izing the safety of the Supreme Court. 
I think you are playing more games 
than anybody in this country can un-
derstand, and we do not understand 
why because there has been no clear 
answer. 
Why would you hold the bill for more 
than a month? 
Why would you hold the bill after 
somebody is arrested who traveled 
across the country to kill a Justice? 
Why would you continue to hold the 
bill now? 
If you change it, you are showing the 
country what you really believe. You 
don’t want the bill to pass. You want 
to delay it longer. 
There is no excuse. There is no rea-
son to delay this bill. This should be 
law, and the Justices should be pro-
tected. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to take from the Speaker’s table 
S. 4160, the Supreme Court Police Par-
ity Act, and ask for immediate consid-
eration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the House is in session 
solely for the purpose of conducting 
morning-hour debate. Therefore, that 
unanimous consent request cannot be 
entertained. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, later 
in this day, it could. There is no excuse 
why this bill continues to be held, and 
there will be no excuse if you try to 
change it to delay it. That is just a tac-
tic, Mr. Speaker, and I believe you 
thought it would be wrong as well.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until 2 
p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 11 
minutes p.m.), the House stood in re-
cess.

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
You, O Lord, ruler of the universe, we 
call on You today. Make us aware of 
Your presence here in this place. 
Gracious God, not a breath is taken, 
not a bird falls from the sky, without 
Your knowledge. Such knowledge is 
too wonderful to conceive and at other 
times a confounding mystery. 
Lord, we believe. Help our unbelief. 
Remind us of Your abiding love which, 
by the gift of Your eternal spirit, You 
have never withheld from us from the 
beginning of time even unto today. 
How wonderful it is to trust in Your 
sovereignty. How wonderful but how 
terrible when we come face to face with 
the tragedies we simply cannot accept, 
nor in which can we see Your merciful 
hand at work. 
Remind us again that You deigned to 
set the world in motion, then blessed 
us with the opportunity to participate 
in Your grace plan for creation. And 
with that blessing, which is truly be-
yond our imagining, You have also laid 
on us the mantle to uphold and protect 
the values You have imbued in us. 
In our attempts to live into these re-
sponsibilities as they reveal them-
selves in each encounter, may we feel 
Your nearness to us, and the guidance 
and direction You provide. 
We offer ourselves to You, responding 
with lives of faith and praying to serve 
You this day as a reflection of Your 
peaceful presence and unwavering love 
in our midst. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. PLASKETT led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
CARIBBEAN AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, in 
recognition 
of 
Caribbean 
American 
Heritage Month, I honor influential 
Haitian leader Henri Christophe. 
Born on the island of Grenada to im-
migrant parents, Christophe played a 
significant role in the American Revo-
lution, serving as a sergeant in the 
French unit in Savannah, Georgia in 
1780. 
Christophe was among the 545 Hai-
tian free slaves known as the Fontages 
Legion, fighting for the freedom of men 
and women who desired to be freed 
from the shackles of oppression. 
After the French forces were defeated 
and Haiti was declared an independent 
republic in 1803, Christophe was elected 
president of the northern State of Haiti 
in 1807. He was responsible for the con-
struction of Citadelle Henry in Haiti, 
introduced a monetary system based 
on gourds, declared Catholicism as a 
state religion, and established schools 
and hospitals, including a basic school 
of medicine.

June 13, 2022 
Let us honor the legacy of this great 
man who fought for the freedom of 
those who refused to do the same. 
f 
RISING ENERGY PRICES 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, last week, I heard from a 
woman in my district who told me 
about the direct impact that rising en-
ergy prices are having on her family. 
This year, her energy bill will climb 
from $135 to $398 a month. 
This constituent is not alone, and be-
cause of this record-setting inflation, 
two-thirds of Americans have been 
forced to use their savings just to pay 
for everyday expenses. 
With gas now costing more than $5 a 
gallon, with diesel costs up nearly 70 
percent higher than they were a year 
ago, it is Pennsylvania families who 
are now paying the price for President 
Biden’s failed energy policies. 
Instead of using American energy, 
President Biden is preparing to travel 
to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to bring 
more foreign oil into our markets here 
in America. 
Americans 
cannot 
afford 
these 
record-setting prices, and we cannot af-
ford to allow the Biden administration 
to continue its war on American en-
ergy. 
f 
ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s 
and Brain Awareness Month, a time to 
raise the level of attention to debili-
tating dementias. 
I appreciate the dedication of Taylor 
Wilson, the Director of Government Af-
fairs for the Alzheimer’s Association of 
South Carolina. 
Alzheimer’s is a brain disorder which 
slowly destroys memory and thinking 
skills. It is not a normal part of aging 
but a result of complex changes in the 
brain that start years before symptoms 
appear. 
I am grateful for the Lexington Med-
ical Center Carroll Campbell Place, in 
loving memory of former and late Gov-
ernor Carroll Campbell. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control, there are nearly 6 million peo-
ple in the U.S. that have Alzheimer’s 
and related dementias. We honor those 
families in America facing a dementia 
diagnosis, while supporting the hope of 
all that through research, we can find 
a prevention or treatment for this fatal 
disease. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism 
as it continues moving from the Af-
ghanistan safe haven to America. 
RECOGNIZING 
CRANBERRY 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
AND 
MIDDLE 
SCHOOL 
ROBOTICS TEAMS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate Cranberry High School and 
Middle School robotics teams from 
Venango County, Pennsylvania’s 15th 
Congressional District. 
Cranberry High School sent 19 stu-
dents and 2 teachers to Dallas, Texas, 
to compete in the 2022 VEX Robotics 
World Championship in May. While in 
Dallas, Cranberry High School teams 
competed against more than 800 other 
teams from around the country and the 
world. 
When it came time to compete, each 
team was paired randomly with an-
other team to showdown against two 
other randomly paired teams. Each 
team 
participated 
in 
10 
2-minute 
rounds throughout the tournament. 
To win, each team’s robot had to co-
ordinate with their allied team’s robot 
to complete certain tasks in the rink 
before their opponents did. This re-
quired each team to work together 
with a team of strangers, sometimes 
from another country. 
This opportunity allowed Cranberry 
High and Middle School students to 
broaden their horizons, as well as ex-
plore future careers in the robotics and 
engineering fields. 
Congratulations to the 19 students 
who participated in such a great event. 
f 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF WILMA 
MANKILLER 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
release of the third coin in the Amer-
ican Women Quarters Program which 
features 
Oklahoma’s 
own 
Wilma 
Mankiller. 
Ms. Mankiller lived an inspiring life, 
which has had a lasting impact on 
Oklahoma and beyond. Hailing from 
the Cherokee Nation, she was hired as 
an economic stimulus coordinator and 
founded the community development 
department. 
Through her incredible work, she be-
came the first woman elected as Prin-
cipal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. 
Under her leadership, she revitalized 
the Tribe’s economy, education sys-
tems, and health and well-being pro-
grams. 
Her remarkable leadership made the 
Cherokee Tribe a national role model, 
but she didn’t stop there. After leaving 
office, she remained an advocate for 
women across the globe. She received 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
highest honor given to civilians in the 
U.S., and was inducted into the Na-
tional Women’s Hall of Fame. 
Ms. 
Mankiller’s 
commitment 
to 
bettering her community and society 
as a whole is truly inspiring. May her 
legacy continue to live on forever. 
f 
WORLDWIDE UREA SHORTAGE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it is 
no secret that America is facing many 
crises today, most unnecessary, on the 
border, fuel, inflation, even baby for-
mula shortages. 
But one thing that is not being 
talked about a lot is that we have a 
worldwide shortage of urea, which is a 
component in fertilizer, as well as fluid 
called DEF used in diesel engines for 
trucks, tractors, et cetera, made after 
2010. 
It is very important that we have 
this essential element because if we 
don’t have our trucks and tractors and 
even trains running, then we are going 
to have even bigger supply crises than 
what we have now. 
China and Russia are two of the 
major exporters of this urea product, 
and they are actually cutting their ex-
portations of them in order to take 
care of themselves. 
What we need to do in this country is 
step up our own production once again. 
After Hurricane Ida—down on the Gulf 
Coast a few years ago—caused suspen-
sion of operations of some of these 
plants that we have, we have to get it 
back going again because we need urea 
for our fertilizer to continue to grow 
food and to have our diesel engines 
that require DEF, the diesel exhaust 
fluid, to keep going and deliver the 
items we need. 
Why do we need yet another crisis of 
running out and messing up the supply 
chain? 
f 
CONTINUATION OF THE 340B 
PROGRAM 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to highlight the positive ac-
complishments and ongoing challenges 
facing healthcare providers in rural 
and remote parts of our country, espe-
cially in places like Michigan’s First 
District, my home. 
Last week marked the 30th anniver-
sary of the 340B Federal drug pricing 
program, which provides discounted 
pharmaceutical products to providers 
that care for a disproportionate share 
of uninsured and at-risk patients. 
In my district alone, we have 20 340B 
hospitals providing care for our most 
vulnerable patient populations and en-
suring our rural and remote commu-
nities receive the best possible care 
available. 
This program has been a critical 
component of healthcare for so many

Michiganders, and I hope to work with 
my colleagues to ensure its continued 
success, especially as it faces new chal-
lenges that could threaten its efficacy 
in the future. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic has shown 
us, reliable access to care, along with 
the availability of prescription drugs 
and specialist medical treatments, is 
more important than ever. 
Our rural and remote providers will 
continue to do everything in their 
power to provide top-of-the-line care to 
our patients. In turn, Congress must 
continue to address those rural health 
priorities. 
f 
POTENTIAL GUN VIOLENCE 
LEGISLATION 
(Mr. GOOD of Virginia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, it is disappointing to see Repub-
licans in the Senate ready to make a 
deal that will do nothing except slide 
us down the slippery slope toward gun 
registration and confiscation. 
The gun deal being contemplated in 
the Senate will do nothing to stop 
criminals intent on doing harm. This is 
just another surrender by uniparty 
RINOs. This will do nothing to satisfy 
the radical left that wants, again, reg-
istration and confiscation. 
Why not do something that would 
truly reduce violent crime in blue cit-
ies where there are hundreds of shoot-
ings every weekend? Why not support 
our police, prosecute criminals, end no- 
cash bail, harden our schools, and do 
something that will actually make a 
difference in reducing the deaths by 
violent crime in this country?

SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this Act may be construed as 
conferring upon any person, State, local, or 
Tribal government the authority to deter-
mine the safety of any AAM operation or the 
feasibility of simultaneous operations by 
AAM and conventional aircraft within any 
given area of the National Airspace System. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon, the chairman of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6270, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6270, legislation sponsored by the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN) 
and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES). 
With the recent passage of the land-
mark Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, Congress renewed its com-
mitment to robust Federal investment 
in the Nation’s airport infrastructure 
to address the rising demand for air 
travel. As the needs of the traveling 
public evolve, we must build on this 
momentum 
to 
leverage 
innovative 
aviation technologies, such as ad-
vanced air mobility, called AAM, to 
help address future challenges. 
The success of these efforts depends 
on early and consistent engagement 
with State and local communities to 
ensure that AAM infrastructure is safe-
ly integrated into the national airspace 
system, accessible to all, and built to 
the appropriate Federal standards. 
H.R. 6270 continues Congress’ thor-
ough oversight of the emerging AAM 
industry and helps local communities 
across the country prepare for and take 
advantage of the tremendous potential 
of this technology. 
The bill invests $25 million to estab-
lish a 2-year U.S. Department of Trans-
portation pilot program to fund com-
prehensive planning grants for State, 
local, territorial, and Tribal govern-
ments to prepare for the deployment of 
AAM vertiports and related infrastruc-
ture in their communities. 
These comprehensive plans may in-
clude details on potential vertiport lo-
cations; physical and digital infra-
structure 
needs; 
potential 
environ-
mental effects; connectivity to existing 
transportation systems; and strategies 
to ensure community engagement and 
equity. 
The bill’s pilot program would also 
provide limited funding for some public 
vertiport construction activities, such 
as design, bidding, and environmental 
study activities, only after the FAA 
has certified at least two AAM aircraft 
models, issued airworthiness deter-
minations for at least two AAM opera-
tors, and published an advisory cir-
cular on vertiport design and perform-
ance and siting standards, among other 
criteria. 
H.R. 6270 has the support of cospon-
sors from both sides of the aisle and 
the endorsement of several organiza-
tions representing the U.S. aviation 
and aerospace sector, and State and 
local governments. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bipar-
tisan legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s start with the ba-
sics. What is advanced air mobility, 
AAM? This bill and the next one deal a 
fair amount with the concept. It is just

making sure that we have got in place 
a system so the remotely piloted or au-
tonomous or vertical takeoff and land-
ing aircraft are able to integrate into 
our existing air infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, it is incredibly impor-
tant to do that in a way that is effec-
tive and that is safe. As the chairman 
said, Mr. Speaker, that is where H.R. 
6270 comes in, the Advanced Aviation 
Infrastructure Modernization Act. It 
does establish a pilot program which 
would provide targeted grants related 
to the planning and construction of 
this AAM. 
We all know that the United States 
has a robust network of general avia-
tion airports and heliports. Their im-
pact on most every community in 
America is probably not fully grasped. 
They are a critically important part of 
our Nation’s infrastructure. 
We want to make sure that those fa-
cilities have the necessary infrastruc-
ture in place for innovative new en-
trants so we can make sure our Na-
tion’s airports and airspace system are 
used by these innovative new entrants 
in a way that is safe and safely inte-
grated with the existing traffic. 
Of course, as is the case with most 
transportation planning, it is State 
and local experts that are best suited 
to help plan for the integration of AAM 
into our national system. 
Mr. Speaker, that is the approach 
that this bill takes. It doesn’t give all 
the money to USDOT. It makes sure 
that these grants are targeted at the 
State and local level so we can get the 
best bang for our buck. Making certain 
that AAM works for all of our con-
stituent communities is the goal. It is 
the goal of this bill. I look forward to 
seeing how different communities em-
brace advanced air mobility oper-
ations. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Subcommittee 
Chairman RICK LARSEN and Ranking 
Member GARRET GRAVES for their work 
and leadership on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 6270 
takes an important step in giving our 
State and local transportation plan-
ning experts the tools they need to 
continue the introduction of advanced 
air mobility aircraft. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to reiterate, we have an 
emerging technology. For once, we 
need to get ahead of the curve, includ-
ing the FAA, so that we are not imped-
ing the tremendous potential of AAM 
across so many sectors and virtually 
every community in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6270, the Advanced Aviation 
Infrastructure Modernization Act, or the AAIM 
Act. 
H.R. 6270 would establish a pilot program 
to help state, local and Tribal governments 
prepare for advanced air mobility operations 
and ensure that communities can take advan-
tage of the potential benefits of the safe inte-
gration of these technologies in our nation’s 
airspace. 
The AAIM Act outlines a comprehensive set 
of considerations for infrastructure planning 
that will enable communities to maximize the 
societal benefits that Advanced Air Mobility 
(AAM) stands to offer. 
Air mobility is a promising industry set to ad-
vance and enhance American methods of 
transportation. 
For more than 100 years, the U.S. aero-
space and defense (A&D) industry has been 
at the forefront of innovation. 
From the first flight in the air to the first 
steps on the moon, the industry has led the 
United States’ economic and national security 
success domestically and internationally. 
AAM is a new concept of air transportation 
using electric vertical takeoff and landing 
(eVTOL) aircraft to move people and cargo 
between places not currently or easily served. 
The AAM market is estimated to reach 
US$115 billion annually by 2035, employing 
more than 280,000 high-paying jobs. 
To keep pace with this growing sector, 
states and localities need to prepare for antici-
pated AAM operations and ensure local com-
munities can take advantage of the potential 
benefits of the safe integration of AAM tech-
nologies in U.S. airspace. 
H.R. 6270 establishes a two-year pilot pro-
gram that invests $25 million in competitive 
grants for state, local, territorial, and Tribal 
governments to prepare for the development 
and deployment of AAM vertiports and related 
infrastructure. 
Powered by electric or hybrid propulsion, 
AAM offers significant potential to improve mo-
bility and complement existing public, trans-
portation networks while reducing congestion 
and carbon and noise emissions. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
6270 the Advanced Aviation Infrastructure 
Modernization Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 6270, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
ADVANCED AIR MOBILITY COORDI-
NATION AND LEADERSHIP ACT 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(S. 516) to plan for and coordinate ef-
forts to integrate advanced air mobil-
ity aircraft into the national airspace 
system, and for other purposes, as 
amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon, the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 516, as 
amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
516, the Advanced Air Mobility Coordi-
nation and Leadership Act. 
Last November, this Chamber took a 
critical first step in fostering innova-
tive advanced air mobility, AAM, in 
the U.S., by passing with an over-
whelming majority, H.R. 1339, com-
panion legislation also titled Advanced 
Air Mobility Coordination and Leader-
ship Act. 
That bill would establish an inter-
agency working group comprised of the 
Federal Government, States, localities, 
the aviation industry, labor unions, 
and other key stakeholders to plan and 
coordinate efforts to safely integrate 
AAM operations into our airspace sys-
tem. 
Today, we are one step closer to 
making what was once only thought of 
as a figment of the imagination—as 
people used to refer to flying cars and 
things like that. S. 516, as amended, re-
flects a bipartisan, bicameral agree-
ment that will make this a reality. 
It will require the development of an 
AAM National Strategy; include a Gov-
ernment Accountability Office study 
on the interests, roles and responsibil-
ities of Federal, State, local, and Trib-
al governments affected by AAM air-
craft and operations; and direct the De-
partment of Transportation to conduct 
an evaluation of whether the AAM 
working group should be terminated 
after the group submits its required 
recommendations to Congress. It will 
incorporate 
relevant 
language 
and 
technical corrections from H.R. 1339; 
and clarify the key stakeholders with 
whom the new AAM working group will 
collaborate. 
The Federal Government industry 
stakeholders alike recognize the poten-
tial for AAM aircraft to alleviate traf-
fic congestion, reduce the current bur-
den on surface infrastructure, create 
good-paying U.S. jobs, and provide a 
more 
environmentally 
sustainable 
mode of daily transportation. 
As these new aircraft emerge in an 
already complex national airspace, we 
must be certain that they are safe for

those on board, those on the ground, 
and fully and safely and effectively in-
tegrated into the national airspace sys-
tem. 
The interagency working group and 
subsequent AAM National Strategy on 
safety, security, and infrastructure 
will help support the development and 
deployment of AAM and advance U.S. 
leadership in this growing global indus-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of 
the original House bill, Representa-
tives SHARICE
DAVIDS
and GARRET 
GRAVES, for their bipartisan effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I support S. 516, as 
amended, and I urge all my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to maintain safe air-
space, we know we have to have coordi-
nation. Think about all of the moving 
parts that are required to keep people 
safe in that shared resource. That kind 
of coordination is also important at 
the Federal level if we want to keep ev-
erybody safe, and if we want to make 
sure AAM keeps moving in the right di-
rection. 
That is what S. 516 does, the Ad-
vanced Air Mobility Coordination and 
Leadership Act. It makes sure that we 
are able to continue moving forward 
and that AAM has the Federal support 
it needs from a variety of agencies to 
be successful. 
As the chairman mentioned, we had a 
similar bill, H.R. 1339, which passed the 
House overwhelmingly, 383 yeas to 41 
nays. 
b 1515 
I think we all realize that that kind 
of strong bipartisan support is not al-
ways as typical around here as we 
would like. Of course, this has got a 
Senate number so, of course, we have 
strong bicameral support as well. In-
deed, the text that is before us today 
has been amended, and so it reflects 
language that has been negotiated and 
agreed upon, Mr. Speaker, by both 
Chambers. 
This sort of bipartisan, bicameral 
agreement ensures that industry and 
government can start to hash out these 
questions on the tough and sometimes 
thorny issues that have to be addressed 
so that we make sure that innovative 
new entrants are able to operate safely 
within our transportation system. 
We know that it is not always easy to 
deal with the Senate—our colleagues 
on the other side of the Capitol—but 
my hope is that once we pass this legis-
lation, they will quickly take up the 
amended bill and send it to the Presi-
dent’s desk for speedy signing into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Congress-
woman SHARICE
DAVIDS, as well as 
Aviation Subcommittee Ranking Mem-
ber GARRET GRAVES, whom I am nor-
mally loath to say anything good 
about, but in this instance, I will. I 
thank them both for their leadership 
on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, ad-
vanced air mobility has the potential 
to 
revolutionize 
personal 
transpor-
tation in the United States. 
Imagine a future just a few years 
from now where instead of summoning 
a taxicab, Mr. Speaker, you walk sev-
eral blocks to a nearby vertiport where 
an autonomous aerial vehicle comes 
down to pick you up, hovers briefly, 
touches down, the doors open for you, 
and it takes you straight to your des-
tination at a cost similar to calling an 
Uber today. That is the potential of ad-
vanced air mobility. Unfortunately, it 
is going to require the coordination 
and cooperation of many different Fed-
eral, State, and local government agen-
cies to realize its potential. 
There are many thorny problems 
that have to be solved before that re-
ality is available to us, for example, 
problems around the certification of 
these vehicles and problems around the 
regulation of the industry. 
Are they regulated like a taxicab op-
erator, or are they regulated like an 
air carrier? 
Who pays for and conducts the plan-
ning for these vertiports? 
What considerations are there for 
aircraft noise? 
What certification standards sur-
round the autonomous vehicle software 
that controls these aerial vehicles? 
All of these are problems that will 
have to be solved before this can be-
come a reality. 
If we are not careful about laying the 
foundation for success with this indus-
try, then, unfortunately, regulation 
will serve to crush this optimistic fu-
ture instead of catalyzing it. 
That is why I am so happy that we 
are considering two important bills 
with respect to advanced air mobility 
on the floor of the House today. The 
first of these bills will establish a 
working group of different government 
agencies whose coordination and co-
operation will be necessary to solve 
some of these regulatory problems that 
face this burgeoning industry. 
The second of these bills will estab-
lish a new grant program for the plan-
ning and development of the infra-
structure necessary to support ad-
vanced air mobility. 
Mr. Speaker, together these bills rep-
resent a very meaningful first invest-
ment in this incredibly exciting new 
industry. I urge support, and I am 
happy to see the House take up these 
bills tonight. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I yield myself the balance of my 
time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman 
from California just did a wonderful 
job rattling off a number of key ques-
tions that policymakers have to settle 
on before we can make sure that AAM 
is safely integrated into our existing 
airports and airspace. This bill will do 
much to make sure that we have the 
coordination that will be necessary to 
answer those questions. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we have just heard the 
bipartisan consensus expressed by the 
two speakers on that side about the 
looming extraordinary importance of 
this industry and how we have to get it 
right as we move forward to not im-
pede it but also to protect safety. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend 
this legislation to my colleagues, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 516, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

POST-DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
ONLINE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2020) to provide for an online re-
pository for certain reporting require-
ments for recipients of Federal disaster 
assistance, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2020. This bill would create a new on-
line system for tracking Federal dis-
aster projects and assistance. 
When a major disaster strikes, the 
American people should know how and 
where their disaster funds are being 
spent without wading through reams of 
governmental paperwork. This legisla-
tion simplifies the data collection 
process for Federal disaster recovery 
projects. 
To increase transparency to the pub-
lic, the bill would also create a page on 
USAspending.gov where everyone can 
track agency disaster recovery activi-
ties and the amount of assistance ex-
pended by an agency on a quarterly 
basis. Federal agencies need to be held 
accountable to the victims of disasters 
so that they can have peace of mind 
when they are at their most vulner-
able. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides to join me and support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS,

Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO: I am writing 
with respect to H.R. 2020, the ‘‘Post-Disaster 
Assistance 
Online 
Accountability 
Act’’. 
Thank you for consulting with the Com-
mittee on Small Business regarding the mat-
ters in H.R. 2020 that fall within the Com-
mittee’s jurisdiction. 
As a result of your consultation with us on 
this measure and in order to expeditiously 
move the bill to the floor, I forego further 
consideration of H.R. 2020. The Committee 
on Small Business takes this action with our 
mutual understanding that we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and the 
Committee will be appropriately consulted 
and involved as the bill or similar legislation 
moves forward so that we may address any 
remaining issues that fall within our juris-
diction. Further, I request your support for 
the appointment of an appropriate number of 
conferees from the Committee on Small 
Business 
during 
any 
House-Senate 
con-
ference involving this or similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming our understanding 
regarding H.R. 2020 and would ask that a 
copy of our exchange of letters on this mat-
ter be included in the Committee Report and 
the Congressional Record during floor con-
sideration of the measure. Thank you for the 
cooperative spirit in which you have worked 
regarding this matter and others between 
our respective committees. 
Sincerely, 
NYDIA M. VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Chairwoman. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 10, 2022. 
Hon. NYDIA M. VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. VELA´ ZQUEZ: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R. 2020, the Post-Disaster 
Assistance Online Accountability Act. I appre-
ciate your decision to waive formal consider-
ation of the bill. 
I agree that the Committee on Small Busi-
ness has valid jurisdictional claims to cer-
tain provisions in this important legislation, 
and I further agree that by forgoing formal 
consideration of the bill, the Committee on 
Small Business is not waiving any jurisdic-
tion over any relevant subject matter. Addi-
tionally, if requested I will support the ap-
pointment of conferees from the Committee 
on Small Business should a House-Senate 
conference be convened on this legislation. 
Finally, this exchange of letters will be in-
cluded in the Congressional Record when the 
bill is considered on the floor. 
Thank you again, and I look forward to 
continuing to work collaboratively with the 
Committee on Small Business on this impor-
tant issue. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is often said that sun-
shine is the best disinfectant. It is said 
so often because it is true, and cer-
tainly, it is true in public affairs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5458 
June 13, 2022 
This is a commonsense account-
ability measure introduced by my Re-
publican colleague from Puerto Rico 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N), and I applaud 
her for this. 
It is going to increase transparency 
for post-disaster Federal assistance. It 
makes sure for citizens who are curi-
ous—exactly as the chairman said— 
who want this information about what 
the Federal Government has done to 
help communities in need without 
their having to go on some massive re-
search project. This gives them an op-
portunity in a clear and concise way to 
get a sense of what their Federal Gov-
ernment has done to respond to these 
disasters. This increased transparency 
is going to allow the American tax-
payers to see where their hard-earned 
dollars are going. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, again, as the gentleman 
has just said, having some trans-
parency when you have a number of 
Federal agencies coming into a com-
munity that has just been devastated, 
whether it is in my region by wildfire 
or on the Gulf Coast by a hurricane or 
in the Midwest and the South by tor-
nado, people need timely and good in-
formation about how the disaster relief 
is flowing from the Federal Govern-
ment, in what amounts, and to what 
places so that there can be actual over-
sight by people who were directly im-
pacted by the disaster. 
That is why I believe this legislation 
has tremendous merit. I recommend 
that my colleagues lend their full sup-
port to it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE, Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2020, the ‘‘Post-Dis-
aster Assistance Online Accountability Act.’’ 
H.R. 2020 is a bipartisan initiative to estab-
lish an online repository for reporting require-
ments for recipients of Federal disaster assist-
ance. 
I would like to thank my colleague, Delegate 
GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N, for introducing this legisla-
tion to increase transparency of post-disaster 
assistance. 
The Office of Management and Budget 
(0MB) along with the Sectretary of the Treas-
ury and the head of each covered Federal 
agency will collaborate to create a subpage 
within the website, www.usaspending.gov, to 
make the following information available to the 
public: 
Total amount of disaster assistance pro-
vided by the agency during quarter; 
Amount of disaster assistance provided by 
the agency that was expanded or obligated to 
projects or activities; and 
Detailed list of all projects or activities for 
which disaster assistance dispersed by the 
agency was expended including: 
Name and description of project or activity; 
Evaluation of the completion status; 
Any award identification number assigned; 
Catalog Disaster Assistance number as-
signed by FEMA; 
Location of the project, including zip codes; 
and 
Any reporting requirement information col-
lected by a covered Federal agency with re-
spect to that agency’s disaster assistance. 
H.R. 2020 will require the submission of in-
formation by covered federal agencies every 3 
months. 
When enacted, H.R. 2020 would include 
natural disasters that are major disasters or 
emergency declared by the President as well 
as any other natural disaster made by the 
Federal Government. 
Within the past decade, we have witnessed 
an increase in the number of natural disasters 
and extreme weather as a result of climate 
change. 
In 2021, the NOAA National Centers for En-
vironmental Information (NCEI) found that the 
United States experienced 20 separate billion- 
dollar weather and climate disasters. 
Houston alone has been the site of 7 feder-
ally declared disasters since 2015 notably in-
cluding Hurricane Harvey and Winter Storm 
Uri. 
The growing number of natural disasters 
makes this legislation increasingly relevant to 
maintain accountability of post-disaster funds. 
H.R. 2020 creates a necessary online ref-
erence portal that will be accessible by may-
ors, legislators, and residents to know the sta-
tus of funds and their use. 
These funds are vital to communities dev-
astated by natural disasters and it is important 
that we ensure the funds are used for their as-
signed use. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H.R. 2020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 2020. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

2019, amending section 206.48(b) of title 44, 
Code of Federal Regulations (regarding fac-
tors considered when evaluating a Gov-
ernor’s request for a major disaster declara-
tion), which revised the factors that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5459 
June 13, 2022 
Comptroller General shall submit to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a re-
port on the review required under this sec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7211. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7211. This bill amends the Stafford Act 
to expand the responsibilities of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy’s Small State Rural Advocate so 
they can better assist smaller States 
and rural communities that have dif-
ficulty dealing with the forms and all 
the requirements to apply for disaster 
funding. 
When disaster strikes the heart of a 
small or rural community, a signifi-
cant percentage of the overall infra-
structure or housing stock is often 
damaged or destroyed. However, the 
community’s size may make the total 
dollar amount of damage seem too low 
for FEMA to authorize Federal assist-
ance. 
This legislation will enable the Small 
State Rural Advocate to better help 
States demonstrate localized impact 
when applying for Federal disaster aid. 
It also directs the advocate to consider 
factors such as the impacted jurisdic-
tion’s per capita income and poverty 
status, among other factors. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to join me in support of this legis-
lation, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Small 
State and Rural Rescue Act. I thank 
my friends, Chairman DEFAZIO
and 
Ranking Member GRAVES, for their ef-
forts to bring this bill to the floor 
today. 
My constituents in central New York 
are all too familiar with the significant 
challenges that come with accessing 
Federal aid in the wake of a disaster. 
Rural 
communities 
along 
Lake 
Ontario’s southern shore in my district 
have seen historic flooding in recent 
years, and in the aftermath, local au-
thorities have struggled to navigate 
the 
complex 
bureaucratic 
malaise 
which is the Federal disaster declara-
tion process. 
Similarly, across the country, rural 
communities 
and 
relatively 
small 
States are forced to grapple with red 
tape and often struggle to demonstrate 
the severe localized impact of these 
disasters. In these instances, FEMA’s 
Small State and Rural Advocate plays 
a critical role in helping underserved 
communities access disaster relief. 
The Small State and Rural Advo-
cate’s office is intended to help ensure 
fair access to FEMA assistance for all 
disaster-impacted areas, and it is es-
sential that Congress reinforce its role 
in facilitating the delivery of essential 
aid. 
That is why I was proud to introduce 
the Small State and Rural Rescue Act 
alongside Chairwoman TITUS and Rep-
resentatives GIMENEZ, PAPPAS, GUEST, 
and DELGADO—a bipartisan bunch. 
This 
legislation 
takes 
important 
steps to expand and codify the respon-
sibilities of FEMA’s Small State and 
Rural Advocate when it comes to help-
ing State and local officials respond to 
a disaster. Additionally, this legisla-
tion directs GAO to conduct a review of 
how FEMA mobilizes individual assist-
ance to disaster zones, an essential 
part of the disaster relief process. 
Legislation like this will go a long 
way in providing support for the rural 
communities and small States that 
many of us represent. This is especially 
important for any of my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle who may be con-
cerned about their districts not receiv-
ing a fair share or an equitable share of 
the Federal disaster aid programs they 
pay into. 
Mr. Speaker, the Small State and 
Rural Rescue Act is about fairness for 
rural communities. I firmly believe we 
should pass it into law, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
H.R. 7211. 
b 1530 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I don’t have any other 
speakers, so I would view this as my 
closing. 
When you see a small community get 
hit by disaster, it just breaks your 
heart. I remember, as chief of staff to 
Governor 
Daugaard, 
being 
on 
the 
ground in Wessington Springs just 
hours after a tornado ripped up that 
town. I was struck by this young 
mayor, Melissa Mebius, a part-time 
mayor, as small-town mayors are. She 
was not an expert in disaster recovery. 
She didn’t know how to navigate the 
FEMA process. 
I was reminded of her strength and 
her persistence just a couple of weeks 
ago when I was in Castlewood and was 
able to meet with that mayor, Brian 
Ries, and get his sense of how their 
town had been devastated by a tornado. 
Mr. Speaker, these are not big towns. 
To be specific, Castlewood is 627 people, 
and Wessington Springs has 956. These 
are good mayors. These are good public 
works directors. These are good city 
councilors. These are able leaders, but 
this is not an area of their expertise. 
The gentleman from New York says 
it right when he says that this is about 
fairness. H.R. 7211 makes sure that 
FEMA will have an advocate who will 
help these small communities better 
collect and present the information 
that is vital to a disaster declaration. 
We all get it. If the information that 
is filed with FEMA is deficient, if it 
does not prove a certain amount of 
damage, then you are not going to get 
the declaration that is needed by these 
communities so that they can move 
forward with the recovery that these 
small and rural communities need 
every bit as the larger, more sophisti-
cated communities do. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the gen-
tleman from New York for his leader-
ship on this issue, and I ask my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank the gen-
tleman from New York for his leader-
ship on this issue and his friendship on 
the committee. We are both moving on 
to maybe greener pastures, but this is 
an important piece of legislation as 
part of his legacy. There is much more 
to it, but at this point, this will be 
something that will help people around 
the country. 
I lost the entire town of Blue River 
in my district in the Labor Day fires 
just 2 years ago. We had winds that we 
had never experienced before, gusting 
up to hurricane force down and out of 
the Cascade Mountains. A power line 
broke and started an inferno that 
moved at an incredible pace down the 
valley. 
We are lucky a lot of people didn’t 
die. The evacuation—there is only one 
way in and one way out of that town, 
and it is a miracle that more people 
weren’t trapped. It was an extraor-
dinary effort. 
The town, except for the high school, 
which was a little way out of town, was 
totally 
devastated. 
They 
are 
now 
struggling back. They didn’t have any 
technical expertise, in terms of a pro-
fessional city manager or a grant writ-
er or anything like that. 
The State has rendered a lot of as-
sistance to them, as has the county and 
as has the regional FEMA office. So, 
they are beginning to rebuild. This leg-
islation will make it a lot easier for 
communities like that in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7211. 
The question was taken.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 3580. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 3580, the Ocean Shipping Reform 
Act of 2022, bipartisan and bicameral 
legislation to strengthen our Nation’s 
supply chain and address unfair ship-
ping practices, which became broadly 
apparent during the pandemic. 
Once again, we have come together 
to find common ground to address the 
needs of the American people. I par-
ticularly want to express great appre-
ciation for the extraordinary leader-
ship of my colleague from California, 
JOHN GARAMENDI, and DUSTY JOHNSON, 
for their tireless work fighting for this 
legislation. 
I would also like to acknowledge SAM 
GRAVES, the ranking member of the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee, Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation Subcommittee Chair-
man SALUD CARBAJAL, and Coast Guard 
and 
Maritime 
Transportation 
Sub-
committee 
Ranking 
Member 
BOB 
GIBBS. Their contributions were many, 
and I appreciate the time they took to 
work with all the stakeholders. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has altered 
the practice of business worldwide, per-
haps permanently. It shuttered fac-
tories, changed consumer demand, and 
inundated our ports with containers. In 
no other time have we had such an un-
precedented need for a resilient supply 
chain, yet if anything, the trials of the 
past 2 years have highlighted the inef-
ficiencies of our transportation system, 
both domestically and internationally. 
One response will be, hopefully, with 
the COMPETES Act, to onshore crit-
ical industries and components in the 
future. But the other is to deal with 
the inefficiencies of the existing sys-
tem during that transition. 
The importance of the maritime sec-
tor as part of America’s supply chain 
cannot be overstated. $4.6 trillion in 
activity takes place annually at all the 
U.S. seaports. 
Despite historic demand and profit 
levels, we have been alerted to in-
stances of large ocean carrier conglom-
erates taking advantage of American 
exporters and importers. In fact, the 
three largest shipping conglomerates 
in the world enjoyed more profits last 
year than the total of their profits in 
the previous decade. We might call 
that price gouging. 
Foreign-flag 
commercial 
carriers 
transport more than 98 percent of U.S. 
foreign commerce. Again, we need 
more significant steps to rebuild a U.S. 
maritime industry so, as a maritime 
nation, we are not dependent upon 
Communist China and other places, a 
whole bunch of developing or even non-
existent countries with flags of conven-
ience that are substantially under the 
thumb of the Chinese. 
Foreign-flag 
commercial 
carriers 
transport 98 percent, as I said, which 
means we must be robust in our ap-
proach to the oversight and enforce-
ment of trade to secure fairness and 
economic prosperity. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 
2022 gives the Federal Maritime Com-
mission updated authority to protect 
exporters, importers, and consumers 
from unfair practices by expanding its 
oversight and enforcement capabilities, 
and it amends title 46 to increase pen-
alties for retaliation against shippers 
and encourage reciprocal trade. It en-
sures that ocean carriers cannot refuse 
U.S. export cargo bookings for arbi-
trary reasons and makes several re-
forms to the way carriers levy deten-
tion and demurrage charges. 
These reforms include requiring writ-
ten confirmation that the fees charged 
are fair and comply with Federal regu-
lations and establishing that shippers 
have straightforward and appropriate 
recourse in the event of improper de-
tention and demurrage charges or 
other unfair shipping practices. 
This legislation also authorizes fund-
ing levels that would adequately equip 
the Federal Maritime Commission to 
utilize its expanded oversight and en-
forcement 
capabilities. 
Specifically, 
the legislation increases the FMC’s au-
thorization from $32.9 million in 2022 to 
$49.2 million in fiscal year 2025, a 50 
percent increase over 4 years. 
This increase would ensure that key 
leadership positions remain filled at a 
time when one in five current FMC em-
ployees are eligible to retire and allow 
for the hiring of additional staff to im-
prove the Commission’s enforcement 
actions and provide timely informa-
tional and dispute resolution assist-
ance to consumers. 
The Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee has held multiple 
hearings focusing on relieving the 
strain on our supply chain. One rec-
ommendation we heard repeatedly is 
that increased data transparency and 
information sharing are essential to re-
ducing lag time at trade-off points in 
the supply chain. 
The supply chain consists of thou-
sands 
of 
moving 
pieces—vessels, 
trucks, trains, planes—that are con-
trolled by small teams of people mak-
ing their decisions about cargo loading, 
timing, and routes based on weather, 
pricing, and other factors. We need to 
make it easier for all players in this 
system to talk to each other and share 
real-time information with their sup-
ply chain partners so that the goods 
keep flowing even when a shipper’s 
transit plans change. 
This bill works in harmony with ac-
tions taken by President Biden, the De-
partment of Transportation, and the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
make pathways for the shipping com-
munity to improve its internal commu-
nication and, in turn, relieve conges-
tion at ports. 
In closing, I stress that this legisla-
tion is vital for ensuring fair and effi-
cient shipping, which is integral to the 
well-being of our economy. 
Allow me, once again, to thank Rep-
resentatives GARAMENDI and JOHNSON 
for their leadership. I look forward to 
unanimous passage in the House, even 
if a vote is called for. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, one of my favorite mov-
ies is the 1993 comedy starring Bill 
Murray, ‘‘Groundhog Day.’’ In that 
movie, every day when Bill Murray 
wakes up, he goes through the same set 
of activities and processes. I can’t help 
but feel a little bit like Bill Murray, 
given that this is the fourth time this 
body is taking up the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act, but I think we are going 
to get it done this time. 
We first passed it in December as a 
standalone bill with strong bipartisan 
vote totals. Then, in January, it was 
attached to a larger bill. A few weeks 
later, it was attached to yet another 
larger package of legislation. 
Now, we have before us the Senate 
bill, and I do think that we are well po-
sitioned to get this across the finish 
line. 
I thank the chairman for his kind 
words earlier. He mentioned the word 
‘‘tireless.’’ When it comes to talking 
about Mr. GARAMENDI, I would also use

the word ‘‘tenacious.’’ He was a won-
derful partner to try to actually get 
something done. 
There are so many Members of Con-
gress that are more interested in com-
plaining about problems or about hav-
ing the hot tweet of the day. But in 
JOHN GARAMENDI, there is a Member 
who actually wants to get things done. 
What a delightful characteristic to 
have in a Member of Congress. 
Our version of H.R. 4996, of course, I 
thought it was the perfect piece of leg-
islation. But the Senate is entitled to 
their own opinions, so we will bring up 
their version. 
I think it is worth us reminding our-
selves, how did we get here? We talk 
about a supply chain crunch. We talk 
about a supply chain crisis. How did we 
get here, and will this bill actually 
help? 
The influx of Federal dollars injected 
into the economy and the way in which 
the pandemic shifted consumer spend-
ing has forced U.S. ports to face un-
precedented volumes of cargo, just 
stuff incoming, nonstop, at a level at 
which this country has not seen. 
This pressure on our ports has trick-
led down to other parts of the supply 
chain that has led to delays in product 
arrivals. It has led to product short-
ages, just as all the capacity in our 
system has been overwhelmed. 
Those soaring freight rates and ca-
pacity shortages have made it difficult 
not only to receive imports but also to 
get our American agriculture and man-
ufactured goods exported for timely de-
livery abroad. U.S. importers and ex-
porters, U.S. consumers, have been hit 
on both fronts. 
Some might be wondering why a Con-
gressman from South Dakota cares so 
much about maritime law. The reality 
is that 60 percent of South Dakota’s 
soybeans are exported, as are a tremen-
dous amount of dairy, beef, and corn. 
This is not just a coastal issue. This 
impacts lives from the farm gate to 
Main Street. Whether people realize it 
or not, this supply chain crunch is im-
pacting them. 
I got most involved in this issue 
when I heard from South Dakota busi-
nesses like Strider Bikes, out of Rapid 
City, or Valley Queen Cheese, out of 
Milbank, about how their ability to do 
business was seriously impacted by the 
crunch at the ports. 
b 1545 
Valley Queen Cheese had 2 million 
pounds of lactose. It already had a 
buyer in Asia. They couldn’t get it on 
a container. At a time when 60 percent 
of containers going back to Asia were 
going back empty, they couldn’t get 
space on a container headed back to 
their customers. Strider couldn’t get 
the parts they needed so that they 
would be able to sell finished products 
to American consumers and consumers 
elsewhere. 
These are real impacts that take mil-
lions and billions of dollars out of the 
American 
economy. 
The 
American 
Farm Bureau estimates that more than 
$25 billion of ag sales have been forgone 
because of this problem at the ports. 
One industry, the U.S. dairy industry, 
in just 6 months last year, experienced 
a $1.6 billion hit. 
So, Mr. Speaker, the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act addresses these problems 
in a few ways. It addresses the supply 
chain bottlenecks, it promotes Amer-
ican competitiveness, and it holds for-
eign-flagged ocean carriers accountable 
for any unfair practices that they en-
gage in. 
I just said that this bill is about U.S. 
competitiveness, and that is exactly 
right. My sense is that if you are a for-
eign-flagged ocean carrier, and you are 
using U.S. ports, you need to submit 
yourself to some basic rules of the 
road. 
This legislation provides the appro-
priate authority to the Federal Mari-
time Commission so that they can bet-
ter protect U.S. shippers who import 
and export items. They should be able 
to do that free from unreasonable anti-
competitive actions. 
So this bill does a lot, Mr. Speaker, 
but I want to hit just on three that I 
think are most noteworthy. First off, 
under this legislation, the FMC will be 
able to set minimum contract stand-
ards for ocean shipping service con-
tracts. That is critically important. 
Again, those are the basic rules of the 
road we need to make sure are in place. 
Secondly, it increases protections for 
U.S. shippers from retaliation if the 
shippers file a complaint with the 
FMC. There has been a fair amount of 
discussion in committee about how 
loath shippers are to file complaints 
against carriers because of concerns 
about retaliation. 
Third, this bill sets standards for de-
tention and demurrage charges levied 
by foreign ocean carriers. These are 
perfectly 
reasonable 
requirements. 
This bill says that the charges must be 
accurate, and of course, they should be, 
and the bill sets penalties for false or 
inaccurate fees. 
The House-passed bill placed even 
more weapons in the FMC’s arsenal. 
Again, the Senate version is not quite 
that robust, but Mr. Speaker, I see no 
value in us having perfect be the 
enemy of the good. This does move us 
in the right direction, so I would ask 
my colleagues to vote for S. 3580, the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022. 
A ‘‘yes’’ vote is a vote to put U.S. 
shippers, 
farmers, 
manufacturers, 
truckers, 
retailers, 
and 
consumers 
first. I support this crucial legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI), who played a 
very principal role in this legislation. 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
thank you so very much for the oppor-
tunity to present this. 
First, let me throw back comments 
that Mr. JOHNSON made. I would say it 
precisely the same. Far too kind, but 
as they apply to you, certainly in 
order, each and every one of them. 
The pleasure of working across the 
aisle, but really in common, on a set of 
problems that plague our constituents, 
and frankly, the constituents of every 
Representative, perhaps that is why we 
had such unanimous or nearly unani-
mous support here on our legislation 
which, correctly, you said, will now 
pass this House four times. 
This bill attacks inflation, and it will 
reduce consumer costs. It is not going 
to solve every problem in the supply 
chain or every problem for U.S. export-
ers, but it will make a very real dif-
ference for American businesses and 
consumers by lowering the exorbitant 
ocean shipping costs and prohibiting 
unfair business practices by foreign- 
flagged ocean carriers. 
Let me continue with a few thank- 
yous. Mr. DEFAZIO, heads up. Pay at-
tention. You and your staff and Mr. 
GRAVES and his staff deserve extraor-
dinary thanks here for really putting 
together some of the details and push-
ing this bill along. 
Also, Mr. CARBAJAL, the maritime 
staff, both minority and majority for 
their work on it, and, of course, the au-
thor of this bill on the Senate side, 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Mr. JOHNSON’s 
staff and ours—and others—worked 
with her early on in the process as she 
was preparing to introduce the Senate 
version of the House version of the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act. 
So where do we go? It was almost 12 
months to the day, June 15, that I 
reached out across the aisle on the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act to work 
with my friend, Congressman DUSTY 
JOHNSON. 
It is 12 months later, and I am 
thrilled that the House is passing this 
bill. In a conversation I had earlier last 
Friday with President Biden, he wants 
to sign this bill as soon as it could pos-
sibly get to his desk. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act, S. 
3580, is the first major overhaul of our 
Nation’s laws and Federal regulations 
for the international ocean shipping in-
dustry since 1998. For decades, the 
United States has run a significant 
trade imbalance, due in large part to 
export-driven, non-market economies 
like mainland China. 
In late 2001, the People’s Republic of 
China was granted permanent, normal 
trade relations with the United States, 
the so-called most-favored-nation sta-
tus—certainly favorable to China, but 
not to the United States—following 
that country’s admission to the World 
Trade Organization. 
The United States’ trade imbalance 
with the People’s Republic of China in 
2001 was approximately $83 billion. In 
2020, our trade imbalance with main-
land China was $310 billion in nominal 
dollars, having increased almost every 
year. 
Concurrently, the ocean shipping in-
dustry underwent considerable consoli-
dation, coinciding with the continual 
decline of U.S.-flagged international 
fleet in favor of foreign flags of conven-
ience—another way of saying, ‘‘do it on 
the cheap.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5466 
June 13, 2022 
Some nine foreign-flagged carriers 
now dominate the global ocean ship-
ping industry, several of which are ef-
fectively controlled by foreign govern-
ments or foreign state-owned enter-
prises. 
These foreign-flagged ocean carriers 
have an alliance with each other. They 
are not subject to the normal Amer-
ican laws of anticompetitive behavior 
so they go about their business. In that 
business, we have found the American 
consumer and the American exporter 
are at a disadvantage. 
The global COVID–19 pandemic made 
all of these longstanding issues in the 
ocean shipping industry and high-
lighted the staggering vulnerabilities 
in the integrated supply chain that 
drives global commerce. 
According to The Journal of Com-
merce, the foreign-flagged ocean car-
riers made a record profit of $150 bil-
lion—billion—in 2021, compared to just 
$25.4 billion in 2022. 
Even after more than quintupling 
their profits during the height of the 
pandemic, an independent analysis by 
the maritime research consultancy, 
Drewry, projects that the foreign- 
flagged ocean carriers will best their 
2021 record profits in 2022, and I might 
add, at the expense of American con-
sumers and at the expense of American 
exporters. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
better get on with it. 
For every American shopper, shipper, 
agricultural exporter, manufacturer, 
retailer, or small business struggling 
with 
skyrocketing 
ocean 
shipping 
costs, I am saying this bill will be help 
on the way. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
cracks down on many of the issues. The 
Federal Maritime Commission is em-
powered. 
The bill shifts the burden of proof re-
garding reasonableness to the ocean 
carriers, so if they want detention and 
demurrage, they have to prove it. 
The bill also requires ocean carriers 
or their billing agencies to ensure that 
those charges comply with Federal reg-
ulations. 
Third: 
The 
bill 
increases 
the 
antiretaliation protections for ship-
pers. 
Fourth: The bill establishes a new ex-
ception in Federal law that ocean car-
riers make a good-faith effort to nego-
tiate vessel space and accommodate 
the cargo bookings for U.S. exports. 
The bill authorizes the Federal Mari-
time Commission to regulate shipping 
exchanges. 
Finally, this is one fine piece of legis-
lation, and I urge its passage. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I would like to engage in a brief col-
loquy with my majority colleague to 
ensure that we agree on section 7(b)(1) 
of S. 3580. 
I would ask Chairman DEFAZIO: Sec-
tion 7(b)(1) of the bill requires the FMC 
to initiate a rulemaking ‘‘further’’ de-
fining prohibited practices by common 
carriers, marine terminal operators, 
and 
ocean 
transportation 
inter-
mediaries under section 41102(c) of title 
46, United States Code. 
Section 7(b)(2) states that the con-
tents of the additional rule required 
under paragraph 1, ‘‘shall only seek to 
further clarify reasonable rules and 
practices related to the assessment of 
detention and demurrage charges to 
address the issues identified in the 
final rule published’’—by the FMC— 
‘‘on May 18, 2020, entitled, ‘Interpretive 
Rule on Demurrage and Detention 
Under the Shipping Act.’’’ 
So, Mr. Chairman, my understanding 
is that any rule prepared under para-
graph 1 of section 7(b) is subject to the 
limitation set in paragraph 2, and such 
rule shall only clarify the May 18, 2020 
rule. 
I also understand that any rule pre-
pared under section 7 shall be in addi-
tion to, not in place of, the May 2020 
rule and that that May 18 rule shall re-
main in place during the preparation of 
the additional rule after the promulga-
tion of such an additional rule unless 
the FMC chooses, unrelated to the re-
quirements of section 7, to undertake 
any amendment to the May 18, 2020 
rule. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is my under-
standing that, though characterized as 
an ‘‘interpretive rule,’’ this final rule 
was promulgated through notice and 
comment and is changing ocean carrier 
behavior with respect to these fees and 
has already led to enforcement cases 
by the Commission to address unrea-
sonable 
detention 
and 
demurrage 
charges. 
Does the Chair share my under-
standings with respect to section 7? Of 
course, I yield time for the gentleman 
to respond. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Oregon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. I thank him for the col-
loquy. 
Yes, I totally agree with the gen-
tleman from South Dakota’s under-
standings with respect to any addi-
tional promulgated rules pursuant to 
section 7 and to the May 18, 2020 rule 
now in place. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, reclaiming my time. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s com-
ments, our agreement as well as your 
engagement. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time because I had 
one additional speaker, but I think he 
is delayed in transit. 
b 1600 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
It has been a bit of a journey. The 
gentleman from California was right, it 
is almost a year to the day, but we are 
here, and we are about ready to punch 
this into the end zone. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3580 provides the 
FMC the crucial tools they need to 
help protect U.S. shippers. Both Mr. 
GARAMENDI and myself are former reg-
ulators at the State level, and we had 
shared that it is unusual in this kind of 
a highly complex and sophisticated 
commerce environment that the FMC 
has lacked these basic authorities in 
the past. 
This bill moves us in the right direc-
tion. It is going to help during this cur-
rent crisis. And even more impor-
tantly, Mr. Speaker, it will make a fu-
ture crisis less likely. People will un-
derstand that the cop on the beat, the 
FMC, has the authority they need to 
shave the most jagged edges off of un-
reasonable behavior from these for-
eign-flagged ocean carriers. 
Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank my 
colleagues across the aisle for working 
with so many of us on this side on this 
important legislation. It is a strongly 
bipartisan and strongly bicameral suc-
cess. I think this time we are going to 
get it across the finish line, signed into 
law by the President. I urge support. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I will just expand a lit-
tle bit on the gentleman from Cali-
fornia when he raised the MFN for 
China in 1990, most-favored-nation sta-
tus. Until then, we had been able, on an 
annual basis, to threaten China with 
substantial retaliation restrictions if 
they violated international norms in 
trade. 
The Clinton administration mistak-
enly felt that if the Chinese were given 
most-favored-nation status and put 
into the World Trade Organization that 
somehow they would reform their prac-
tices. They haven’t; they didn’t; they 
won’t. 
Interestingly, I was cleaning out a 
drawer in my desk today and came 
across a headline story where it said, 
‘‘DeFazio predicts the largest export to 
China will be U.S. jobs,’’ and it has 
been. We have hemorrhaged hundreds 
of thousands, millions of good, family- 
wage manufacturing jobs in this coun-
try, developed extraordinary depend-
ence. 
The Senate version of the COM-
PETES 
Act, 
thanks 
to 
Senator 
TOOMEY, would actually make us more 
dependent on China, do away with all 
tariffs, including on medical protective 
gear and other things. 
Did we learn nothing during this pan-
demic?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5467 
June 13, 2022 
This bill is just one first step in be-
ginning 
to 
reestablish 
the 
United 
States’ competitive position in the 
world with free and ‘‘fair’’ trade—fair, 
underlined eight times—including the 
shipping companies and those who uti-
lize or dominate those shipping compa-
nies. 
This is critical legislation. I am hop-
ing that we can make even more 
progress in the COMPETES Act on the 
Senate side and not adopt their pa-
thetic, total kowtowing to China. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
support of S. 3580 to defend the right of 
American business owners and farmers to re-
ceive fair pricing for the exportation of their 
valuable products across the world. 
Since the COVID–19 pandemic brought the 
world to a halt, the international exchange of 
goods has struggled to recover. 
Many Americans have felt the impact of the 
supply chain disruption in their homes and 
pockets. 
Products manufactured in factories overseas 
take too long to arrive at our ports. 
When they do arrive, they spend days 
docked on shore before distribution to Amer-
ican warehouses. 
However, the true crime in this broken sys-
tem has been the theft of economic oppor-
tunity to American exporters. 
In the months of October and November 
2021, when the global supply chain was at its 
most unstable, shipping carriers had the gall 
to arrive on U.S. soil, deposit foreign products 
and then reject the exports of American farm-
ers and business owners. 
In these two months, ocean carriers turned 
away more than 175,000 containers from ports 
in California, New Jersey, and New York. 
According to some reports, nearly 40 per-
cent of scheduled pickups of U.S. agricultural 
exports were cancelled or simply not com-
pleted. 
Three out of four shipping containers left 
American ports empty. 
That’s a loss of over $630 million for Amer-
ican businesses. 
When shipping containers were available for 
export, price gouging ate into already small 
profit margins of our hard-working farmers. 
In just two years the price of a shipping con-
tainer leaving the U.S. quadrupled. 
Our business owners, our producers, our 
farmers are being robbed. 
Foreign shipping companies should not be 
making all time high profits off the backs of 
American business owners. 
The Ocean Shipping Competition Reform 
Act will empower the Federal Maritime Com-
mission to ensure that American companies 
stand on equal footing with foreign manufac-
turers and that these unjust practices come to 
an end. 
S. 3580 will ensure that shipping companies 
commit to fair and equitable pricing practices. 
S. 3580 will support the American economy 
and will empower our business owners and 
agricultural leaders to compete on an even 
playing field on the international stage. 
That is why I stand in support of the Ocean 
Shipping Competition Reform Act of 2022, and 
why I encourage my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
express my support for the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2022. I want to especially com-
mend Reps. GARAMENDI and JOHNSON, on 
their tremendous work cultivating a bipartisan 
agreement to address supply chain issues and 
unfair practices in the shipping industry. 
I would also like to thank my colleagues for 
working with me and Chair DEFAZIO on this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, the need for this legislation is 
clear by the fact that every American now 
knows the phrase ‘supply chain disruption’. 
Whether its delayed shipments of agricul-
tural goods or the current infant formula short-
age, every family in America has been 
touched in some way by these bottlenecks 
and kinks in our supply chain. 
We need robust solutions to address this 
crisis 
This bill is the first step in doing so. 
It eases our stressed supply chain by cre-
ating more transparency within our intermodal 
system and improves efficiency in transporting 
goods at a time when supply chain congestion 
is severe. 
The increase in funding for the Federal Mar-
itime Commission in this 4-year authorization 
is indicative of Congress’s strong support for 
finding an effective solution to the supply 
chain crisis. Now is the time to ensure that the 
Commission has the ability to enforce fairness 
in ocean shipping practices. 
I am pleased that the bill contains a number 
of provisions aimed at addressing wrongfully 
issued detention and demurrage charges. This 
includes holding shipping companies respon-
sible for proving the reasonableness of the 
charges when challenged. 
To optimize supply chain efficiency and 
streamline operations, the bill calls for a study 
to develop best practices for chassis pools 
that provide service to different types of stake-
holders in the intermodal transportation sys-
tem. 
It also authorizes the collection and publica-
tion of equipment dwell time statistics at the 
top 25 ports. 
I am proud of the Committee’s work on this 
important legislation, and I look forward to 
seeing it signed into law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 3580. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE 
CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR 
OF H.R. 2974 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that I may hereafter be 
considered to be the first sponsor of 
H.R. 2974, a bill originally introduced 
by Representative Delgado of New 
York, for the purpose of adding cospon-
sors and requesting reprintings pursu-
ant to clause 7 of rule XII. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection.

HONORING DR. ALEX JOHNSON ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Alex Johnson, 
who will soon be retiring after nearly a 
decade of service as Cuyahoga Commu-
nity College’s president. 
Dr. Johnson retires as a pillar of the 
Cleveland community. His deep com-
mitment to Tri-C’s students and for-
ward-thinking leadership helped shape 
graduates, like myself, who were pre-
pared for a lifetime of success in north-
east Ohio. 
During Dr. Johnson’s tenure, Tri-C 
produced a record number of graduates 
and increased its graduation rates, all 
while remaining committed to the 
school’s core mission of delivering af-
fordable higher education, providing 
equitable job opportunities, and ensur-
ing 
successful 
degree 
completion. 
Meanwhile, throughout the tumult of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, Dr. Johnson 
served as a steady hand at the helm, 
ensuring students’ continued success. 
As a Tri-C graduate and the Rep-
resentative for Ohio’s 11th Congres-
sional District, I deeply appreciate Dr. 
Johnson’s 
extraordinary 
leadership, 
unparalleled vision, and lasting accom-
plishments. His legacy will only con-
tinue to grow through the countless 
students, teachers, and administrators 
he impacted. 
f 
REMEMBERING RUSSELL 
PETERSON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in memory of Russ 
Peterson, a remarkable Georgian. 
Russ was born in Park Ridge, Illi-
nois, and was the son of the late Russ 
and Helen Peterson, devoted husband 
to his wife, Louise Peterson, and loving 
father and grandfather. 
Russ was known for his good sense of 
humor, his love for life, and contagious 
laughter among friends. 
Russ earned his bachelor’s degree 
from 
DePauw 
University 
in 
Greencastle, Indiana, and went to work 
with Allstate Insurance. He retired as a 
regional vice president after more than 
35 years of service. 
Russ was heavily involved in the bet-
terment of his community, serving as 
president of the Landings Association. 
Russ also served on the Board of 
Marshes of Skidaway Island, St. Jo-
seph’s Hospital Foundation Board, the 
Chatham Leadership Board, and was 
involved in the American Cancer Soci-
ety. 
He played a major role in the build-
ing of the beautiful bridge to Skidaway 
Island and started a Parkinson’s sup-
port group that continues to benefit 
people today. He was also very involved 
in the Republican Club of Skidaway Is-
land. 
A loving father and husband, out-
doorsman, community advocate, and 
agent of change, Russ will be dearly 
missed. 
f 
CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF DACA 
(Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 10th anni-
versary of the DACA program on June 
15, 2022. 
In the last decade, this program has 
allowed young Americans to pursue the 
American Dream in the only country 
they know to be their home. They have 
been able to live without fear of being 
separated from their families and have 
been able to pursue higher education 
and their dream jobs. They are our 
friends, our family members, trusted 
community leaders, coworkers, and fel-
low Americans in every way but on a 
piece of paper. 
Madam Speaker, we need to do more. 
Since I have been in Congress, I have 
been proud to support the DACA recipi-
ents, including through introducing 
legislation to give them a pathway to 
citizenship and advocating for DACA 
recipients to work in Congress and 
across the Federal Government. 
I am proud to work with my col-
leagues in the Hispanic Caucus to fight 
for immigrant communities and to 
urge the U.S. Senate to take up meas-
ures that the House has passed time 
and time again. 
f 
A MILLION CRISES 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, last 
week the Wall Street Journal reported 
that a whistleblower employee at Ab-
bott Nutrition filed a complaint with 
the FDA in February of last year, 
months before the originally reported 
date of October. If true, President 
Biden and his FDA must answer for 
why 
they 
ignored 
these 
alarming 
claims. 
Parents in middle Tennessee are 
struggling to find baby formula as the 
out-of-stock rate has skyrocketed to 92 
percent. 
Ultimately, this is just another crisis 
that has been made much worse by the 
Biden administration, about which one 
White House official on the Domestic 
Policy Council gave the excuse that 
the administration’s plate was full 
with ‘‘a million crises going on.’’ 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s 
failed far-left agenda caused the mil-
lion crises. Those many crises very 
well may have distracted his adminis-
tration from initially taking the baby 
formula shortage seriously, as well as 
contributed to the administration’s in-
excusably slow reaction to the crisis, 
allowing it to get much worse than it 
should have. 
We must get to the bottom of this 
failure and hold those accountable re-
sponsible, but in any case, the Presi-
dent must do better.

servants have increasingly become tar-
gets for criminals. 
Criminals will steal a carrier’s mail-
box key and then use that stolen key 
to steal mail and packages. Between 
2018 and 2021, robberies of mail carriers 
more than tripled, and robberies in-
volving a gun quadrupled. 
Until 2020, postal police officers pa-
trolled our neighborhoods to protect 
letter carriers and deter mail theft, but 
in August 2020, right before the Presi-
dential election, the Trump adminis-
tration ordered the postal police to 
stop patrols and limited them to guard-
ing post offices. 
This policy needs to change imme-
diately. Our mail carriers are at risk, 
and they deserve the protection of the 
law enforcement officers employed by 
the post office.

HONORING DR. SHIRLEY ANN 
JACKSON ON HER RETIREMENT 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an inspiring pioneer 
and brilliant mind, Dr. Shirley Ann 
Jackson, on the occasion of her retire-
ment. 
Dr. Jackson, president of Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute, was the first 
Black woman to receive a doctorate de-
gree in physics from MIT, and in 1999 
became the first Black woman to lead 
a top-ranked research university. 
Ever the trailblazer, Dr. Jackson was 
the first Black person and the first 
woman to chair the United States Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission. 
Dr. Jackson’s historic achievements 
in public service and in her field of the-
oretical physics, combined with her 
tireless advocacy for increased Black 
representation in STEM fields, con-
tinue to provide inspiration to so many 
in New York’s capital region and, for 
that matter, across our Nation. 
It is no surprise that Time magazine 
has called her ‘‘perhaps the ultimate 
role model for women in science.’’ 
It is indeed my honor to congratulate 
the unmatched Dr. Jackson as she em-
barks on the next chapter of her life. I 
thank her for inserting herself, her 
strength, and her vision into the fabric 
of RPI. 
Dr. Jackson, thank you for your out-
standing leadership. 
f 
EXPRESSING STRONG SUPPORT 
FOR STEEL TARIFFS 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my strong support for 
the continuation of section 232 steel 
tariffs for our domestic manufacturers, 
our workforce, and our national secu-
rity. 
Indiana’s First Congressional Dis-
trict is home to an incredible founda-
tion of steelworkers and the American 
steel producers who create products 
that are essential not just to the 
strength of our national economy but 
also to our national security. 
It is necessary that the American 
steel industry has a level playing field 
in our global economy so that our in-
novative companies and skilled work-
force can continue to lead the world in 
manufacturing 
the 
most 
environ-
mentally friendly and efficiently pro-
duced steel. 
As co-chairman of the Congressional 
Steel Caucus, we have been actively ex-
pressing our strong support for the con-
tinuation of section 232 steel tariffs. I 
look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues and members of the 
administration to advocate for the 
value of these current tariffs and en-
sure that we all recognize how unfair 
trade and global steel overcapacity 
negatively impact our Nation’s future.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
THE 
WESTERN 
BALKANS—MES-
SAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. 
NO. 117–122) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio) laid before the House 
the following message from the Presi-
dent of the United States; which was 
read and, together with the accom-
panying papers, referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and ordered 
to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
Western Balkans that was declared in 
Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, 
under which additional steps were 
taken in Executive Order 13304 of May 
28, 2003, and which was expanded in 
scope in Executive Order 14033 of June 
8, 2021, is to continue in effect beyond 
June 26, 2022. 
The acts of extremist violence and 
obstructionist activity, and the situa-
tion in the Western Balkans, which 
stymies progress toward effective and 
democratic governance and full inte-
gration into transatlantic institutions, 
outlined in these Executive Orders, 
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity and foreign policy of the United 
States. Therefore, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13219 with respect to the Western 
Balkans.

The actions and policies of certain

CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and submit additional materials 
and statements. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to proceed under this 
Special Order of the Congressional 
Black Caucus. It is my pleasure now to 
begin to frame this very important 
week to commemorate Juneteenth, the 
second acknowledgment of the Federal 
holiday created on June 17, 2021, by 
President 
Joe 
Biden—present, 
of 
course, was Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS—when the first holiday for 
nearly 40 years, Federal holiday, was 
established. 
I am pleased to be able to yield to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio 
whose vision has helped us craft this 
recognition 
and 
this 
Congressional 
Black Caucus Special Order and her 
recognition of the cruciality of hon-
oring those who have never been hon-
ored, 
the 
acknowledgment 
of 
Juneteenth, a day of freedom, and as 
well recognizing H.R. 40, the Commis-
sion to Study and Develop Reparation 
Proposals. We thank her for her leader-
ship and her guidance. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), 
the chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, the chair of our Special Order, ex-
ecutive board member, a person who 
you want to be out front. Whether it is 
an issue on civil rights, criminal jus-
tice, reparations, voting rights, or do-
mestic 
violence, 
Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE has earned this 
day and this right. I could not think of 
a better person to stand here as we 
talk 
about 
commemorating 
Juneteenth. We know the history all 
too well of what happened in Texas. 
Congresswoman SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE 
hails from Texas. 
Today, as we talk about Black excel-
lence, as we talk about the members of 
the 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus, 
Madam Speaker, we speak to America 
tonight. We want America to know 
that as we commemorate Juneteenth, 
it is about our work; it is about our 
scholarship; it is about our fight. You 
will hear a broad range of issues that 
we are so proud to stand up for and let 
America know we are there. 
I could not think of a better issue to 
weave into Juneteenth than repara-
tions, H.R. 40. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, if 
you have been in the room with her, 
you have heard her say it at the White 
House, you have heard her say it at 
caucus, you have heard her go in the 
Halls of Congress talking about H.R. 
40. I could stop there, but I can tell you 
that piece of legislation has her finger-
prints on it and the signatures of 200- 
plus Members. What a great way for me 
to start and to stand here as chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Tonight, we commemorate a day in 
our Nation’s history that can only be 
described as a celebration of freedom, 
Juneteenth. 
On June 19, 1865, enslaved African 
Americans in Texas received the joyous 
news of emancipation and that they 
were finally free. 
Despite that, we are still enslaved in 
many ways, so it is critical for Amer-
ica to know of our fight and our 
progress. 
Tonight, you will hear Members dis-
cuss our work on criminal justice, rep-
arations, uplifting of our Black men 
and boys, racial equity, fair housing, 
and so much more. We are leading the 
charge and laying the foundation to de-
liver on voting rights, student loan 
debt, and gun control. Tonight, we tell 
our story of Black excellence. 
Nearly 1 year ago, on June 17, 2021, 
the Congressional Black Caucus went 
to the White House and joined with 
President Joe Biden and Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS as he signed the his-
toric legislation that made Juneteenth 
the 11th national holiday and the first 
new Federal holiday since Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. Day in 1983. 
Now, more than a century-and-a-half 
later, I stand here as chairwoman of 
the largest Congressional Black Caucus 
in the Nation’s history. 
Every day, 58 Black members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus legislate 
in these Halls built by our enslaved an-
cestors. Six full committee chairs, 
chair of the Democratic Caucus, the 
House majority whip, former senior ad-
viser to the President, and Vice Presi-
dent of these United States are all ac-
tive and former members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. 
Madam Speaker, we have come so 
far, but we realize there is still work to 
do. Yes, from being considered one- 
third of a person, we want the Amer-
ican people to know that we continue 
fighting. 
It was the Congressional Black Cau-
cus that brokered the $1 trillion infra-
structure law for our roads and bridges 
and 
provided 
little 
children 
a 
broadband network. It was the $1,400 in 
the pockets of everyday Americans, the 
$300 a month for working families with 
children, 
the 
historic 
funding 
for 
HBCUs, and each Congressional Black 
Caucus member bringing community 
dollars to their district. 
We have seen one of the most con-
sequential civil rights legislations aim-
ing at interrupting the school-to-prison 
pipeline and uplifting Black men and 
boys, the U.S. Commission on Social 
Status of Black Men and Boys, created 
and birthed by our very own Congress-
woman FREDERICA WILSON, a sojourner 
for our Black men and boys. 
Tonight, you will hear other mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Caucus 
commemorate our successes in the 
spirit of Juneteenth. 
But, Madam Speaker, in the immor-
tal words of Dr. Maya Angelou: Bring-
ing the gifts that our ancestors gave, 
we are the dream and the hope of the 
slave. 
I am proud to proclaim on this floor 
tonight: Happy Juneteenth Day. Our 
power, our message. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for her dis-
tinguished presentation. 
I will take a moment, as other Mem-
bers are on the floor, so I can at least 
set the framework of this evening of 
which she has done so ably. I think the 
cornerstone of the chairwoman’s re-
marks is that we have been building on 
Juneteenth, as members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, for all of our 
tenure in Congress. We have done it by 
the myriad of legislative initiatives 
that continue to build and repair what 
was generated from the 246 years of 
slavery. 
Let me, first of all, read into the 
RECORD that order of General Gordon 
Granger on June 19, 1865, on the shores 
of Galveston, Texas:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5473 
June 13, 2022 
‘‘The people of Texas are informed 
that, in accordance with a proclama-
tion from the Executive of the United 
States, all slaves are free. This in-
volves an absolute equality of personal 
rights and rights of property between 
former masters and slaves, and the 
connection heretofore existing between 
them becomes that between employer 
and hired labor. The Freedmen are ad-
vised to remain quietly at their present 
homes and work for wages. They are 
informed that they will not be allowed 
to collect at military posts and that 
they will not be supported in idleness 
either there or elsewhere.’’ 
Most people have not heard the en-
tire order. 
Union soldiers, up to 200,000, fought 
in the Civil War and died. Union sol-
diers were killed by Confederate sol-
diers. Rather than, under the laws of 
the military protocol, captured as pris-
oners of war, they shot them dead. 
Blood was shed by slaves, or Freed-
men, and the order that we all so often 
praised, let me be very clear, General 
Granger said you are free, but your 
posture, your framework, the guide-
post, is you are not to leave. You are 
now employer and not even employee 
but hired labor. 
There was no obligation for Freed-
men to stay and take a job, and most 
of the slaves looked askance. They 
didn’t understand what ‘‘employer’’ 
was. That is not a word they had ever 
heard, in any large sense, and ‘‘hired 
labor.’’ We are free. 
Tonight, we speak about freedom. 
They were free. Yet, even in the good-
ness of that order, they were advised to 
remain at their present homes, prob-
ably something that had been given to 
the plantation and the masters and to 
work for wages. It did not say what 
kind of wages, what kind of work con-
ditions you had, what kind of workers’ 
comp, insurance. No, they were in-
formed that they would not be allowed 
to collect at military posts, and as if 
that had been the slaves’ mantra, they 
even challenged them to not be sup-
ported in idleness either there or else-
where. 
Let me tell you, by this very potent 
picture, what the ancestors had gone 
through for 246 years. For those who 
were born, lived, and died in the bru-
tality of slavery, this was their lives, 
the separation of families and the 
unnaming of families. They had first 
names, or they were called ‘‘husband’’ 
or ‘‘wife.’’ They were not given the dig-
nity of a name. This was their lot. 
So Juneteenth, its essence was free-
dom, but the words were hesitant. Even 
though slavery had been abolished, as 
most people will know, except for con-
victed persons, which made them as a 
challenged amendment, if you will, be-
cause that process of prisoners contin-
ued into the 20th century. 
But I say this to say, as we begin our 
discussion, and I will just make this 
point, I am here to honor those who 
never were honored, whose names were 
never called, whose funerals or burials 
were never given the dignity of a 
human being. They died as less than a 
person, as the Constitution dictated, 
for at least a century. They never had 
that dignity of who they were and the 
work they did and the building of the 
economic engine of America and the 
shedding of blood in both the Revolu-
tionary War and the wars in between 
and the Civil War. 
As we look at these scars, that is why 
I am so adamant about H.R. 40, the 
Commission to Study and Develop Rep-
aration Proposals. Because even in the 
pronouncement 
of 
freedom, 
Chair-
woman BEATTY, Chairman JEFFRIES, 
Chair BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN—even 
in the proclamation of freedom, they 
did not have freedom. They were quali-
fied in their freedom. 
With that in mind, I continue to 
raise up this bill, with almost 217 co-
sponsors, to this week even become an 
executive 
order, 
pronouncement 
of 
such, or ultimately passed by the 
House of Representatives, that is, H.R. 
40, the Commission to Study and De-
velop Reparation Proposals. 
I am prepared to yield to the chair-
man of the House Democratic Caucus, 
who has certainly evidenced the es-
sence of freedom in our work together 
on criminal justice reform. I think he 
well knows what the 13th Amendment 
left us with, as well as General Grang-
er’s order. I hope that he has heard 
that even in freedom, we were given 
qualifications and structures and stric-
tures, and we were denied the true free-
dom of this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
b 2000 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished gentlewoman 
from the great State of Texas, the 
Chair of the Crime, Terrorism and 
Homeland 
Security 
Subcommittee, 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE, for yielding and 
for her leadership in so many different 
areas, particularly as it relates to the 
effort to make sure that we explore to 
the greatest extent possible the legacy 
that still remains in terms of the dam-
age that was done relative to the en-
slavement of people of African descent 
here in the United States of America. 
We have come a long way in this 
great country, but we still have a long 
way to go, racism is in the soil of 
America going all the way back to 1619. 
It is an honor to stand here with my 
distinguished colleagues, the chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, the 
Honorable JOYCE BEATTY, who has done 
such an amazing job leading us forward 
in this Congress and, of course, the dis-
tinguished gentlewoman from the great 
State of New Jersey, Congresswoman 
BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN. I thank you, 
Madam Speaker, for presiding over this 
particular discussion. 
Juneteenth as a Federal holiday is an 
amazing development. An effort was 
led by the Congressional Black Caucus 
and, of course, the legislation was 
signed into law by President Joe Biden. 
I thank the distinguished gentlewoman 
from Texas for leading the effort. 
I first came to know of Juneteenth 
when I was a student at the LBJ 
School of Public Affairs in the summer 
between my junior year and my senior 
year and had not heard—I am just a 
kid from Brooklyn—had not heard 
about Juneteenth. Folks down there 
said 
we 
are 
going 
to 
celebrate 
Juneteenth. I said June what? I was 
unsure of it, growing up proudly as an 
African American in New York City, 
something that had been in the heart 
and soul of the people of Texas and 
throughout the south but hadn’t nec-
essarily made it into my consciousness. 
I was thankful for that moment. 
I think about that journey to a point 
now where we have a Federal holiday 
to mark the journey of African Ameri-
cans and the progress that has been 
made but the need to continue, of 
course, to do more. 
As Chairwoman BEATTY talked about 
some of the things that the Congres-
sional Black Caucus has worked on, I 
think this Juneteenth marker is an im-
portant point in time both to reflect 
upon what has been done, but also, of 
course, to mark what still needs to be 
done to continue America’s march to-
ward a more perfect Union. 
We weren’t promised a perfect coun-
try. We know the Framers of this great 
Republic themselves were imperfect. 
We were never promised a perfect coun-
try. Slavery was in existence when the 
Republic was founded, but they did 
promise a march toward a more perfect 
Union that America could try to con-
tinue to be the best version of herself. 
And that is what the Congressional 
Black Caucus has really been all about. 
In our 51 years I can’t stand here in 
the time that I have to catalogue all 
that has been done, but if you just look 
at what has occurred in the last 10 or 15 
years; signature pieces of legislation 
year after year after year; Congress-
man DANNY DAVIS leading the effort to 
pass the Second Chance Act to make 
sure that incarcerated individuals and 
others who need a second chance at life 
could successfully reintegrate into so-
ciety in a way that helps them as indi-
viduals, their families, our commu-
nities, as well as taxpayers. That was a 
bill that was signed into law by a Re-
publican President George Bush. Lead-
ership from the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
Certainly, in that criminal justice re-
form space we know that Chairman 
BOBBY SCOTT in 2010 led the effort to 
pass the Fair Sentencing Act, which 
lowered the 100 to 1 egregious crack co-
caine sentencing disparity—that dis-
parity between crack cocaine and pow-
der cocaine—and dropped it down to 18 
to 1 in a way that allowed thousands of 
individuals, the overwhelming major-
ity of whom were Black men, to be re-
leased back into society to live produc-
tive lives. 
There was still more work that need-
ed to be done. We took up the effort in 
2018, and collectively the Congressional

to do in 2010, and enact a wide variety 
of sentencing reforms that created a 
fairer more equitable criminal justice 
system resulting in thousands of indi-
viduals being able to successfully re-
integrate back into society, save tax-
payer dollars, but also repaired lives, 
repaired 
families, repaired commu-
nities. 
The overwhelming majority of folks, 
again, who were released, 90 percent, 
Black men. 
Why? 
Because it was Black men who bore 
the brunt of the failed war on drugs 
and the failure of so-called lock ‘em up 
and throw away the key sentencing 
schemes, all of which didn’t make us 
safer, as people were banished, often 
for nonviolent drug offenses. That was 
the Congressional Black Caucus. 
It was the Congressional Black Cau-
cus led by FREDERICA
WILSON
that 
passed into law the Commission on the 
Social Status of Black Men and Boys 
and it was signed into law by a Repub-
lican President, passed through a Re-
publican-controlled United States Sen-
ate. Because the Congressional Black 
Caucus stays on the case. And as was 
said during its founding, no permanent 
friends, no permanent enemies, only 
permanent interests, and the interests 
to make sure that these principles: 
equal protection under the law, liberty 
and justice for all, and fundamental 
fairness apply to all Americans regard-
less of race. 
And so that is a very important piece 
of legislation. That commission is a 
foundation that, under the leadership 
of JOYCE BEATTY, we can continue to 
make progress, particularly for those 
Black men and boys who have been iso-
lated and under-resourced and targeted 
in our society. 
I am thankful that during that same 
Congress there was an effort to more 
fully and robustly fund historically 
Black colleges and universities. That 
effort was led by Representative ALMA 
ADAMS. It was also legislation that 
made it through a Republican-con-
trolled Senate, Republican-controlled 
House, signed into law by a Republican 
President. The CBC stays on the case. 
And that is certainly what occurred 
this particular Congress with passage 
of historic infrastructure legislation. 
That effort was, in part, when we were 
at a stalemate led by our chairwoman, 
JOYCE BEATTY, who worked to bring 
the caucus together to a place where 
we could enact groundbreaking legisla-
tion that will create millions of good- 
paying jobs, make sure that there is 
clean water in every single community, 
and we know that it is Black commu-
nities that often suffer from water that 
has been poisoned. 
And, of course, it was our great whip, 
JIM CLYBURN, who led the effort to 
make sure that we put into place a 
process so that we can get high-speed 
internet access in every single commu-
nity. This is the CBC staying on the 
case. 
So I am thankful for the leadership 
of my colleagues within the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, thankful that our 
chair has continued to pull us together 
and lead us in such a phenomenal way, 
thankful for BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN, 
who is one of the most principled pub-
lic servants you will find anywhere in 
these United States, thankful for SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE and what she is doing 
to lead us forward to examine through 
H.R. 40 the legacy of slavery and the 
fact that perhaps the least that we can 
do is have a study to figure out the 
damage that was done through the sys-
tematic rape and kidnapping, lynching, 
and oppression decade after decade, 
century into century and then its prog-
eny in the context of Jim Crow and the 
institutional discrimination that re-
mains with us today. The least that 
perhaps we can do at some point is fig-
ure out how we can study the issue, 
building upon all of the work that the 
CBC has been able to do today. 
Juneteenth gives us an opportunity 
to mark the progress that we have 
made, and of course, think about a vi-
sion for the future as we continue our 
long, necessary, and majestic march 
toward a more perfect Union. 
I thank you, Madam Speaker, for pre-
siding. I thank my classmate and good 
friend, JOYCE BEATTY, for her work, 
and I certainly approve any message 
that she articulates. I thank my col-
leagues 
SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE
and 
BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN who are help-
ing to lead the charge with this Special 
Order. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for taking us 
through this powerful journey of a con-
tinued fight for freedom by the Con-
gressional Black Caucus and incor-
porating all of the relief given for the 
continued ailments and disparities of 
African Americans and leading us to 
H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and 
Develop Reparation Proposals for Afri-
can Americans Act, which really are 
components of the work that we have 
been doing. They are the building 
blocks of trying to cure extensive dis-
parities. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WAT-
SON
COLEMAN), a Member that has 
worked on disparities focused on the 
journey of Black women, leading on 
issues of Black women maternity mor-
tality, as well as my colleague on the 
Homeland Security Committee and a 
number of other collaborations. 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the leader of our Spe-
cial Order hour, the magnificent, ex-
quisite, and always on point the Honor-
able SHEILA JACKSON LEE for her work 
on H.R. 40 and reminding us every day 
that within that word ‘‘reparations’’ is 
repair and our opportunity to study 
how we can repair the pain and the in-
justice that was accorded to our com-
munity. 
I need to recognize my leader, JOYCE 
BEATTY, because under her leadership 
she has amplified our voice is our 
power. And on whatever level we decide 
that we must speak and we must act, 
JOYCE BEATTY has reminded us that 
our voice is our power because the Con-
gressional Black Caucus believes in ex-
ercising that power on behalf of com-
munities that have been underrep-
resented for so very long, whether it is 
environmental justice, social justice, 
criminal justice reform, housing, or 
just whether or not the whole system 
needs to be examined as it impacted us. 
I thank the chair of our caucus, who 
took us through a journey that re-
minded me, as I was sitting there, of 
the good work that we have been able 
to do. I tell you that I feel like I am 
standing here in a very sacred space, 
and I want to speak in the spirit that 
flows through us that was left by Shir-
ley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, John 
Lewis, Elijah Cummings, and Alcee 
Hastings, and so many more that have 
gone before us and have opened the 
doors and pushed through the doors so 
that we might be here this evening to 
address you. 
So, yes, slavery—supposedly freedom 
from it—came to us in 1865, and today 
we commemorate and we celebrate this 
end of slavery and all the progress that 
we have made over the last 157 years. 
b 2015 
We must also acknowledge, as Chair-
man HAKEEM
JEFFRIES
reminded us, 
the long road ahead toward what would 
be full equality for Black Americans. 
Let Juneteenth be not just a celebra-
tion or a commemoration, but a ral-
lying cry as we recommit ourselves to 
the centuries-long struggle for civil 
rights. 
Through historic measures like the 
American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, and executive or-
ders on policing and advancing racial 
equity, 
the 
Biden 
administration, 
along with this Congress, has taken 
important steps to address the unique 
needs of Black communities across the 
country. The time is now to keep that 
momentum going. 
Our current moment presents an op-
portunity to dismantle systemic injus-
tices by bringing Black people from the 
margins to the mainstream of Amer-
ican society. We as a society must stop 
treating Black people as an after-
thought. That means we must take di-
rect action to end the racial discrimi-
nation that, contrary to what our col-
leagues across the aisle might like us 
to believe, still exists today. 
It means ensuring that Black people, 
especially Black women, are in the 
rooms where decisions are made. It 
means passing legislation like the 
CROWN Act, which would put an end to 
the insidious discrimination against 
Black people because of their hair.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5475 
June 13, 2022 
In the fight for a more perfect Union, 
we can, we should, and we must think 
bigger and bolder. Through policies 
like those that are outlined in the 
Black Women Best economic frame-
work—which include everything from 
guaranteed basic income to sweeping 
criminal justice reform—we can bring 
the Black community from peril to 
prosperity. When we do that, we bring 
everybody else along with us. Only 
then will all Americans have the free-
dom to thrive. 
Today, we celebrate this turning 
point in our Nation’s history. Today, 
we look back on the milestones we 
have achieved since then. Today, we 
continue fighting for that more inclu-
sive, that more equitable, that fairer 
society that really represents the best 
that America can be. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for bringing 
to our attention some very unique as-
pects, 
again, 
of 
the 
Congressional 
Black Caucus and her work. 
As I travel the country, it is inter-
esting to hear that our community has 
been so deprived as it relates to the 
discrimination against you with re-
spect to your hairstyle. Congress-
woman 
BONNIE
WATSON
COLEMAN, 
among other things, was able to lead 
on something, and I hear it often, that 
they are so proud of this legislation be-
cause it has given dignity to people 
whose dignity was taken away. 
These are the building blocks that 
the Congressional Black Caucus pours 
into 
the 
symbolism 
of 
honoring 
Juneteenth and H.R. 40, the commis-
sion that studies slavery. 
Madam Speaker, as I prepare to allow 
for an additional speaker to come, let 
me make this point—let me just take 
this moment as we prepare to yield. 
Madam Speaker, would you give us 
the time, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 26 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me put this into the record as I pre-
pare to yield, and emphasize what H.R. 
40 does. As I do so, let me emphasize 
why H.R. 40 is so important. 
This is what you see—it is the hang-
ing of Black men, and it is the presence 
of individuals who are making a spec-
tacle of this. There is one Black man 
already on the ground. There is no evi-
dence of a trial, no evidence of guilt. 
This is an example of what preceded 
1865. 
When you talk about H.R. 40—or even 
when 
we 
were 
trying 
to 
make 
Juneteenth a Federal holiday—I intro-
duced resolutions over and over again 
and finally got the bill introduced as a 
Federal holiday, which then we pro-
ceeded and worked to get it passed. 
There was always a question: Why? 
There was always a question about 
this issue of freedom. You are already 
free. You live in America. The same 
goes for this issue of: Why H.R. 40? Be-
cause the continuing—continuing—ail-
ments that ailed our community did 
not end. 
This was obviously not in 1865. This 
was into the 1900s, the 20th century, as 
evidenced—or maybe the late 1800s that 
Black men were being hung, Black 
women were being raped and separated 
from families, and the abuse of racism 
was deep and abiding. The Klan would 
raid and burn communities, hospitals, 
churches, homes, and have a reign of 
terror. 
This work of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, with the many splinters of leg-
islation, can be culminated by the pas-
sage through a vote on the floor of the 
House or through an executive order 
that clearly would provide an answer 
to the language here that says: 
Following the abolition of slavery, 
the United States Government, at the 
Federal, State, and local levels, contin-
ued to perpetrate, condone, and often 
profit from practices that continued to 
brutalize 
and 
disadvantage 
African 
Americans, including share cropping, 
convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, 
unequal 
education, 
and 
dispropor-
tionate treatment at the hands of the 
criminal justice systems, and lack of 
access to healthcare. Harvard Univer-
sity said, If we had it, we would not 
have been that impacted by COVID in 
terms of dying and sickness. This is a 
symbolic depiction that racism and 
discrimination continue to exist. 
This legislation was updated to say: 
And develop reparation proposals. That 
is the key. It is an action item. We 
want a response to Black America; a 
response to African Americans; we 
want a response to the 57 members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus—com-
ing from a variety of districts—some 
with small measures of African Amer-
icas. Yet, the recognition of wherever 
they live in America, and as our mem-
bers represent all people, millions of 
Americans, they understand the stark 
disparities they see even in their con-
gressional districts. 
That is why we stand here today, to 
honor Juneteenth which equals free-
dom. That is why we are here today, to 
say that we are never giving up the 
fight. We are most proud of the fact 
that we collectively came as a body, 
embraced our work as individual mem-
bers, and got Juneteenth signed. We 
will now go into this week speaking 
about freedom, but also speaking about 
truth and the work we have to do. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
yield to gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. 
BEATTY). 
f 
CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) 
is recognized for the remainder of the 
hour as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, to-
night we have heard from leadership in 
the Congressional Black Caucus and 
leadership in the Democratic Caucus of 
the United States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE for thread-
ing the needle, for reminding us of the 
history of how we started; 1863. And 
then 2 years later in 1865 when it was 
announced that Juneteenth would exist 
because 
Black 
people 
were 
free. 
Juneteenth, independence day, freedom 
day, all of it makes a difference for us 
because we know freedom is never 
given, it is won. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure now—another colleague from 
the great State of Ohio. Someone who 
knows the value and importance of 
fighting because she is a fighter. She is 
a sojourner who understands that her 
voice speaks for thousands of individ-
uals, especially Black individuals. 
It is a great honor to have a col-
league that hails from the same State 
that I hail from, the great State of 
Ohio. She walks in the footsteps of 
Congresswoman Marsha Fudge, Con-
gresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, 
and a Congressman—one of the found-
ers of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus—Congressman Lou Stokes. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. BROWN), from 
the 11th District. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, thank you for the kind introduc-
tion. I thank Chairwomen Beatty and 
all my Congressional Black Caucus col-
leagues for highlighting the signifi-
cance of Juneteenth during today’s 
Special Order hour. 
Madam Speaker, the date was Mon-
day, June 19, 1865; the location, Gal-
veston, Texas. It was 21⁄2 years after 
President Lincoln issued the Emanci-
pation Proclamation and 2 months 
after the Civil War ended, 250,000 
enslaved Black people in Texas still did 
not know they were free. 
That was until—on that Texas sum-
mer day—Federal troops rode into 
town and a Union general read aloud 
an order announcing their freedom. 
Emancipation didn’t happen all at 
once, and slavery wasn’t formally abol-
ished until the passage of the 13th 
Amendment later that year. That 19th 
day in June came to be known as 
Juneteenth, a day celebrating the end 
of slavery in America. 
The year following the 1865 declara-
tion, freedman in Texas organized the 
first of what became the annual June 
19 
celebration. 
Slowly 
but 
surely, 
Juneteenth celebrations spread across 
the country. 
Last year, thanks to the hard work of 
my friend, my colleague, the dynamic 
incomparable Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, President Biden signed a 
bill into law recognizing Juneteenth as 
a Federal holiday. 
Juneteenth is a time to celebrate, 
and it is a time to take pride in the 
many contributions of African Ameri-
cans to our society and our country 
across the generations. 
It is also a time of remembrance and 
action. On Juneteenth, we acknowledge 
a dark period in our history and its 
lasting legacy of inequality and injus-
tice—a legacy that continues to influ-
ence our country today. We have made

much progress as a Nation, yet we still 
have a long way to go. Progress is not 
possible without a full accounting of 
both our brightest days and our dark-
est nights. 
As we honor those enslaved Texans 
who finally learned of their freedom 157 
years ago, let us recommit to fulfilling 
the promise of Juneteenth—and indeed 
of our Nation at large—by fighting for 
equality, liberty, and justice for all. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, we 
stand here listening. We stand here re-
visiting our history. We stand here 
thinking about our ancestors. 
b 2030 
As members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus 50-plus-1-years-old, we 
understand that the fight must con-
tinue. 
We understand when we walk in 
these hallowed Halls of justice that we 
carry that torch—that torch, freedom, 
that torch, justice and liberty for all. 
It is that responsibility that we ac-
knowledge. 
It is that responsibility when I think 
about the 173 Black people in the his-
tory of this Congress who have served 
out of some 12,000 people who have 
served in these Halls—173 Black people. 
When I think about being the ninth 
Black woman to serve as chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, I think of 
the other women: the sojourners and 
the truth tellers who served as chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus. 
I think of people like Congresswoman 
KAREN BASS, whom I followed. 
I think about Congresswoman, and 
now Secretary of HUD, Marcia Fudge. 
I think about Congresswoman MAX-
INE WATERS—who is one of six Black 
Members of Congress—serving as chair 
of the Financial Services Committee. 
I think about Congresswoman BAR-
BARA LEE from California who is al-
ways out in the forefront and remind-
ing us of the words of Shirley Chis-
holm. 
I think about Congresswoman EDDIE 
BERNICE
JOHNSON, another colleague 
from the great State of Texas. She is a 
woman who reminds us about equality 
and justice and reminds us about the 
value of collaboration and standing to-
gether in unity. She is the founder of 
the Tri-Caucus. She is another fighter 
for justice, someone who mentors us 
and stands back and gives us enough 
room so we can lead and follow in her 
footsteps. 
There are so many strong, Black 
women in the Congressional Black Cau-
cus. 
Then there are the men. There are 29 
Members who are female and 29 Mem-
bers who are male serving now in the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
So tonight, Madam Speaker, I say, 
thank you. The two most powerful 
words that one can say. I say thank 
you to our chair of our Special Order 
hour, Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE. 
As we begin to bring this night to a 
close, I am reminded of so many things 
that great leaders have said. Someone 
said that liberty, when it begins to 
take root, is a plant of rapid growth. 
We have begun to take root as mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus. And we, too, have that same rapid 
growth of all the things in this Cham-
ber we have brought to the floor, in 
this Chamber that we have voted out 
and sent to the Senate and to the 
White House to be signed into law. So 
often people will come up to us on the 
great streets of America, and they will 
say: Tell me, what is it that the Con-
gressional Black Caucus is doing? 
But, Madam Speaker, I say no more. 
No more will you question who we are. 
Because our power and our message of 
Black excellence, of lifting up and ele-
vating our message and power has 
reigned through the United States of 
America 
because 
you 
see, 
Madam 
Speaker, when you talk about an exec-
utive order or police reform, it was the 
Congressional Black Caucus that was 
there when the President signed it. 
When you talk about our dealing 
with student debt, it is the Congres-
sional Black Caucus that just finished 
a 2-day issues conference. We brought 
before our Congressional Black Caucus 
issues forum 10 of the top civil rights 
leaders in America. They didn’t bring 
or send a designee. They came them-
selves before us. 
So I want to say, Madam Speaker, 
that tonight was about Juneteenth. 
But tonight was also about letting 
Americans know that we are fighting 
for them, that we stand with them, and 
that we understand that we must con-
tinue to fight against systemic racism, 
and we must continue to fight for our 
children and our families. 
That is what we do because we are 
the Congressional Black Caucus. Our 
power and our message is Black excel-
lence unapologetically strong. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
for over 150 years, June 19th, also known as 
Juneteenth Independence Day, has served as 
a source of reflection, inspiration, and hope for 
generations of Black Americans. It is a day 
when we are reminded of the trials and tribu-
lations of those who came before us, and cel-
ebrate the incredible progress we have made. 
It is a day when we can rejoice together in the 
freedom and liberties that we all share, and 
recommit ourselves to everlasting equality and 
justice. It is a day that means so much, but for 
too long had not been formally recognized as 
a federal holiday. 
That was, Madam Speaker, until our advo-
cacy was finally met with action from the rest 
of Congress and the White House. I was 
proud to join my colleagues here in Congress 
and the Biden Administration last year to 
make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Now, just 
one year later, many more Americans under-
stand and appreciate the day’s history. 
Today, I am especially thankful for Texas’s 
very own, Ms. Opal Lee. Colloquially known 
as the ‘‘Grandmother of Juneteenth,’’ Ms. Lee 
has worked tirelessly over the years to edu-
cate, inform, and advocate on behalf of the 
Juneteenth movement. I have had the pleas-
ure of meeting her several times over the 
years and am constantly reminded that we 
stand on the shoulders of icons like her. 
Madam Speaker, I want to wish those in 
Texas’s 
30th 
Congressional 
District 
and 
across the country a Happy Juneteenth. 
f 
REVERSE THE CURSE: RESTORING 
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 4, 2021, 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
tonight we are going to talk about a 
subject that gets too little attention in 
this Chamber and too little debate and 
consideration among lawmakers. Yet 
the storm clouds are gathering, and an 
epic crisis looms large over the future 
of our great Nation. Our mountainous 
and unsustainable national debt is the 
most significant, in my opinion, long- 
term threat to our economic prosperity 
as well as our national security. We 
have sown the wind of fiscal irrespon-
sibility, and our children will reap the 
whirlwind of economic calamity. We 
will rob generations of Americans of 
the freedoms and the opportunities 
that we have enjoyed and have been so 
blessed with. 
Madam Speaker, we all take an oath, 
but there is an unwritten covenant be-
tween lawmakers today and our Found-
ing Fathers and our future generations 
of Americans, and that unwritten sa-
cred promise that all American leaders 
have subscribed to is to leave this Na-
tion better than we found it. 
I believe the question is still hanging 
out there. The jury is still out on 
whether our Nation’s leaders today in 
this generation are willing to make the 
sacrifices necessary to take on what I 
believe is the greatest challenge of the 
21st 
century, 
and 
that 
is 
this 
unsustainable, 
unconscionable, 
and 
even immoral fiscal path that we are 
on. It is a collision course with a disas-
trous future. 
We have to do something. We have all 
the reforms and policy solutions. But 
what we don’t have and what I have 
not seen in now 6 years in this Cham-
ber is the collective political will to do 
something about it. It is very simple. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to be 
joined by fellow lawmakers who I know 
share these sentiments. One such man 
hails from Ohio’s Sixth District. He is 
a dear friend, he is a patriot, and he is 
a veteran. He has served on the Budget 
Committee. He is the co-chair of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus, a task force 
on addressing our broken budgetary 
processes and getting our arms around 
the debt and reining this in. 
Madam Speaker, I am so glad he has 
joined us tonight. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding.

H5477 
June 13, 2022 
This is such a huge problem. There 
are so many different paths we could 
go down with this discussion. It is so 
big of a crisis that it is almost impos-
sible to get it all articulated well with-
in one Special Order series. 
Madam Speaker, late last month, the 
CBO released its ‘‘May 2022 Budget and 
Economic Outlook.’’ This is the first 
time the CBO has produced a baseline 
that properly incorporates the run-
away, destructive inflation that is rip-
ping through our economy today. 
According to the CBO report, infla-
tion is not going anywhere anytime 
soon except up. This is a dramatic 
change from the insistence of the 
President, the Treasury Secretary, and 
my Democrat colleagues that inflation 
is merely transitory and is nothing to 
worry about. 
They are, in fact, so out of touch that 
they have begun to change their nar-
rative. They now claim that Americans 
are financially prepared—get this—fi-
nancially prepared to weather $5 a gal-
lon 
gasoline, 
skyrocketing 
energy 
costs, and grocery prices that would 
have been unthinkable just 18 months 
ago. 
Now, I am not sure what Americans 
they are talking to, but they are not 
talking to Americans who live in Appa-
lachia where I live—seniors who live on 
fixed incomes and others who struggle 
to make ends meet in this high infla-
tionary period. But inflation is not just 
a sticker-shock sensation. It will have 
ripple effects throughout the economy. 
Debt will continue to rise to 110 per-
cent of GDP over the next decade. 
Don’t be fooled by President Biden’s 
propaganda claiming victory on debt 
reduction either. CBO projects that 
deficits will be $2.4 trillion larger over 
the next 10 years. The more President 
Biden continues to pour gasoline on 
the inflation fire with his failed poli-
cies, the more that number is going to 
keep growing. 
Madam Speaker, we must get our fis-
cal house in order. The American peo-
ple have to live by a budget, and the 
American government should live by a 
budget, too. The United States does 
not have a revenue problem, we have a 
spending problem. And the first step in 
fixing this problem is to fix our broken 
budget process. 
That is why I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of H.R. 2575, the TRUST Act, 
to establish special rescue committees 
to begin developing recommendations 
and legislation to protect and ensure 
the longevity of Social Security and 
Medicare. These are some of the coun-
try’s main drivers of our debt. They are 
mandatory spending programs that are 
absolutely out of control. Doing noth-
ing about it is not an option. 
I am also, as was mentioned, the co- 
lead on a bipartisan debt and deficit 
working group as a member of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus, and I am will-
ing to work with anyone, Republican 
or Democrat, to find real solutions to 
ensure Medicare and Social Security 
are around for our children and our 
grandchildren to benefit from in the 
years to come. 
Madam Speaker, this is a big prob-
lem. I look forward to hearing what my 
colleagues have to say tonight. We 
need bold ideas to address the fiscal 
crisis that looms in front of us. 
b 2045 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend from Ohio and 
echo his sentiments. We must get our 
fiscal house in order. 
It is shameful. I would say, a case in 
point, to the cries from our citizens, 
citizens who say that this body and 
politicians in both Chambers, in Wash-
ington, play by a different set of rules. 
Do you know what? They are right. 
There is no further you have to look 
than at our budget and appropriations 
process. 
We haven’t had a budget in the last 4 
years under the leadership of our Dem-
ocrat colleagues, but quite frankly, 
both parties have been guilty. I think, 
over the last 50 years, we have only 
gone through regular order and passed 
a budget in all 12 appropriations and 
run the people’s House the way our 
States and local governments and our 
families run their fiscal affairs. 
They don’t get to waive pay-fors. 
They don’t get to borrow infinitum. 
This place is so broken, and it is 
going to catch up to us. You don’t feel 
the pain until you feel the pain. 
When the dominoes fall, you cannot 
borrow and spend your way out of that 
situation and that particular crisis, 
like we have seen with COVID and oth-
ers prior to it. 
We have a champion for this issue, 
fiscal responsibility, restoring that in 
our own Conference as well as the 
broader United States Congress, a fel-
low Texan, a man who I am proud to 
serve with from Texas’ 21st District, 
and a member of the House Judiciary 
Committee and Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Texas for yielding. I 
know that he cares deeply about this 
issue and spends a whole lot of time 
working across the aisle and with our 
own Conference, trying to get this body 
to focus on this issue of spending. 
Frankly, that is on both sides of the 
aisle. 
We are sitting here now, $30.5 trillion 
of debt. That is a number that nobody 
in America can possibly understand 
what that means. We talk about it. We 
say it. We put charts up, but nobody 
knows. $30.5 trillion, if you set out to 
count to that, one Mississippi, it would 
take you 967,000 years. I mean, think 
about that. It is patently absurd. 
Yet, we are going to rack up another 
trillion and a half here in the next 
year, and then another couple of tril-
lion. We are just going to keep piling it 
on. Interest rates are going up, and in-
terest rates are going to keep going up, 
so that debt is going to pile up even 
further. 
The American people know this. 
They can’t live their lives that way. 
Yet, here we are in this body, this so- 
called people’s House, and we haven’t 
had a single actual debate on spending 
in this body the entire time I have been 
here, much less this year. 
We just passed another milestone in 
this great body, the United States 
House of Representatives, in which we 
just spent the sixth year in which not 
one amendment was offered on the 
floor of this body in open debate, not 
one amendment. 
Has any rank-and-file Member of the 
United States House of Representatives 
been able to come to the floor and offer 
an amendment? You wonder why this 
place is broken? 
I mean, we just passed that milestone 
yet again. You never get a chance to 
have open debate here in the so-called 
people’s House. 
I gave a speech a little while back 
from this podium on this floor that I 
called the United States House of free 
stuff because that is the way people 
view this body. 
Oh, we just got another check we can 
go write, another bill we can pass. It 
sounds good. It has something great in 
the title. You are talking about infant 
formula. Oh, you better vote for that. 
You can’t vote against a bill that has 
infant formula in the title. Doesn’t 
matter what it does. Doesn’t matter if 
it will make it worse. Didn’t matter 
what the power of the government is. 
If you put ALS in the title, don’t 
vote ‘‘no’’ on an ALS bill. Well, then 
you hate people with ALS, right? 
Don’t vote ‘‘no’’ on any bill that has 
something in the title. United States 
House of free stuff. 
Yet, this week, what are we going to 
vote on? We are going to have a bill, 
H.R. 7606, which will likely come up, 
that will give $400 million to ethanol 
producers. Never mind that that jacks 
up 30 cents a gallon on the price of gas-
oline. 
We are going to have a bill that has 
$12.7 billion over 10 years on wildlife re-
covery. Man, we are really being great 
stewards of the public trust here in the 
United States House of Representa-
tives. 
That is the problem. That is what is 
broken, and the American people see it. 
They see that we are here not doing 
the work of the people because we 
never actually debate, vote, and figure 
out something, roll our sleeves up and 
say: ‘‘Do you know what? We have X 
trillion dollars of income so we can 
only spend X trillion.’’ We never do 
that. 
That fundamentally is what my 
friend from Texas is getting at, what 
my colleagues are here on the floor 
talking about. 
I would ask the Speaker where my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are having any conversation whatso-
ever about only spending that which 
we take in. But, no, we can never have 
that conversation in the United States 
House of free stuff because it is a hell

of a lot easier to go out on the steps 
and go preen and posture to a bunch of 
people in the media, saying about how 
evil people are if they dare vote against 
spending money we don’t have. 
Madam Speaker, we should do our 
job, both sides of the aisle, to stop 
spending money we don’t have. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
say a hearty amen to my fellow Texan 
who has put his money where his 
mouth is. Certainly, he has put the 
votes of his constituents where his 
mouth is and has taken a stand. 
It is not fun to be voting against 
things that have these wonderful titles 
that are going to do these grandiose 
things for the country. But the ques-
tion is, who is going to pay for it? 
I don’t even call the $30 trillion of 
debt ‘‘debt.’’ I call it what TOM 
MCCLINTOCK once mentioned in a budg-
et hearing. It is a deferred tax on our 
children. It is so easy for us to pass 
these bills and not consider the incal-
culable cumulative cost. 
But there will be a payday someday. 
As James Madison said, ‘‘A public debt 
is a public curse.’’ We are not blessing 
our children. We are not giving them 
the benefit of the quality of life that 
we have known as Americans second to 
no other nation and society in the 
world and in the history of the world. 
Yet, to do nothing and to keep this 
runaway freight train of fiscal irre-
sponsibility running off the cliff is to 
curse them. Indeed, it is to curse them, 
as James Madison said. 
Another friend and colleague and a 
new Member of Congress, but not new 
to public service, is PETER MEIJER from 
Michigan’s Third District. He serves on 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
We appreciate his deep concerns and 
convictions on this issue facing our 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend from Texas for 
yielding. 
When I was in middle school, we had 
a textbook for U.S. Government, and it 
showed our debt. The line went up and 
the line went down over administra-
tions. It spiked in World War II. It was 
coming down in the nineties. This is 
the debt, mind you, not the deficit, the 
debt. There was a little dotted line an-
ticipating we would have the debt fully 
paid off by, I think, 2002. 
Now, some things got in the way 
around the turn of the millennium, and 
that number has spiked. Now, we are at 
those World War II highs. 
As many of my colleagues have al-
luded to, this is a bipartisan affliction. 
Deficit spending knows no party pref-
erence. But the idea that, in just a few 
short years, we tripled that debt—well, 
added 50 percent, went from $20 trillion 
to $30 trillion, $5 trillion of that in the 
last 2 years alone. 
We were facing the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Those were dark and fright-
ening days, and this body reacted 
swiftly, reacted in good faith. Yet, the 
good faith became a good excuse to just 
keep spending, keep spending, keep 
going. That catches up. 
The inflation that we are experi-
encing right now has many fathers. 
You have the challenges of unwinding 
over a decade of quantitative easing, 
and that money printer just rolling on 
and on. 
We have the American Rescue Plan, 
which many of us in this body, prob-
ably many of us here behind me to-
night, were warning about the infla-
tionary impacts that were dismissed at 
the time, except for a few brave econo-
mists on the left. Larry Summers was 
pointing that out, but we just kept 
going. 
Now, the American people, the con-
sumers, are feeling that impact. They 
see it every time they drive past the 
gas station. 
I just filled up my gas tank. For the 
first time, it cost me over $100. That 
has never been the case. I know many 
who have more than a 20-gallon tank 
are experiencing that even worse. 
The question on behalf of constitu-
ents we talk to is: What are you going 
to do? What are you going to do in Con-
gress about this? 
The 
challenge 
is 
inflation, 
debt 
spending. These are challenging issues, 
right? You can’t put the genie back in 
the bottle. I mean, maybe we could ac-
celerate the creation of a time machine 
and go back and show what occurred 
and what the consequences were of 
those policies, come back into this 
body to February 2021 with the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, or even go back to 
when that middle school textbook I 
had was written, showing the dangers. 
But just in the time I have been here, 
our cost to service the debt, that 10- 
year Treasury bond, has tripled in 
terms of what this impact will be on us 
fiscally. 
We talk about the budgets that we 
pass, that spending. That is only a 
third of how much money is going out 
the door. 
I applaud my colleagues who are 
working on the TRUST Act and other 
efforts to just come to some bipartisan 
consensus because this will be some-
thing that impacts all generations. 
I am acutely aware of that, looking 
at young families and the burden this 
is putting on them, and just how much 
that debt very rapidly is going to be a 
long-term drag on our fiscal growth, on 
our economic vitality that underpins 
our standing in the world and our posi-
tion as a superpower. 
If we don’t get that house in order 
and get it in order fast, and start lay-
ing down the groundwork—it doesn’t 
have to be bold right away. It will need 
to be bold eventually. But, by golly, we 
need to start heading down that right 
path and that right path soon. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Michigan, 
my friend, for his comments. I am, 
again, proud to serve with him, and he 
brings such reason and common sense. 
He is right to say that it is not a par-
tisan issue and that the debt and those 
things that have led to this massive $30 
trillion, over 120 percent of the size of 
our entire economy, exceeding World 
War II with our entire debt—and by the 
way, in peacetime. He is right. 
We have to have an honest conversa-
tion with ourselves before we have an 
honest conversation with the American 
people, and both parties have contrib-
uted to this mess. Until we decide to 
accept that and take ownership of it, 
we will never lead us to the path of re-
storing that responsibility, that good 
footing, and the prospects of having 
saved this country and our children 
and grandchildren from the disastrous, 
calamitous future if we don’t. I appre-
ciate his approach to it. 
We are reaching out to our col-
leagues, our Democrat colleagues, to 
fix some of these broken systems, the 
perverse incentives that let us get 
away with this reckless and irrespon-
sible process that we call budget and 
appropriations. Nowhere else in the 
world can you do what we do. 
But the results are indisputable. You 
get a broken process, a dysfunctional 
system like we have, and you are going 
to get broken outcomes. 
Look no further than the debt clock, 
and look no further than CBO’s 10-year 
forecast: $16 trillion more over the next 
10 years of just the public debt. It went 
from almost a trillion in annual defi-
cits leading up to COVID, and now the 
average will be $1.6 trillion in annual 
deficits over the next 10 years, leading 
up to 2032, where we will have $2.3 tril-
lion in annual deficits. The interest we 
pay on the debt just to service them, 
think about this. 
b 2100 
We will spend more to service the 
debt to pay the interest, which you get 
nothing for. You get no infrastructure. 
You 
don’t 
get 
a 
farm 
bill 
with 
strengthening of the food supply. You 
don’t get a better or bigger army to 
put on the field against the threats 
around the globe. 
We will see a tripling of the interest 
payments that will exceed in 10 years, 
cumulative, over $8 trillion, but the an-
nual amount will exceed what we spend 
on national defense. We get nothing for 
this interest. It is the largest growing 
mandatory spending item in the budg-
et. 
Woe to the country if we don’t take a 
hard look in the mirror and if we don’t 
decide to muster the political courage 
to take this on for the sake of our kids 
and for the sake of our country. 
Now, one of my closest friends in 
Congress who claims to come from a 
State that does more agriculture than 
the Lone Star State, which already dis-
credits him from the outset, but I don’t 
want to see the numbers because I 
would be afraid if he were right. I 
would be afraid to go back to Texas. 
We are just going to say Texas is big-
ger in every way, including ag produc-
tion.

He is a Ways and Means Committee 
member, and this guy, he is passionate 
about our debt, our deficits, and get-
ting our fiscal house in order. He is 
going to be helping lead the charge in 
the 118th Congress when the people, I 
pray, give our conference, Republicans, 
a chance to prove that we are serious 
on this: RON
ESTES
from the great 
State of Kansas. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Mr. ARRINGTON, for hosting 
this very important hour on this very 
important topic. I will concede that 
Texas is bigger geographically than 
Kansas and several other States as 
well. 
You know, it is important that we 
talk about this important issue, and I 
really appreciate the work that he 
does, and I appreciate serving with him 
on the Ways and Means Committee on 
so many of the important issues that 
we have to address for our country. 
Madam Speaker, tonight, as many 
Americans put their kids to bed, they 
are checking their schedules for the 
next day and doing a quick review of 
the bank accounts. They are deeply 
concerned about how they are going to 
be able to live with the crushing price 
increases in Joe Biden’s America. 
We are talking a lot about the debt 
tonight. We are talking about, you 
know, how do you afford to make your 
payments on the issues that you have 
to address today? But also, how do you 
have to plan for the future, knowing 
how that debt is going to weigh down 
on people, weigh down on Americans, 
weigh down on them as individuals, but 
also weigh down on their kids and 
grandkids? 
You know, there is a lot of noise that 
happens in this bubble we call Wash-
ington, D.C., but everyday Americans 
have the same top concerns about the 
economy and rising prices. 
In fact, it has been a top concern for 
months now. Even last year during a 
townhall in October, 98 percent of the 
respondents said that they had seen an 
increase in the cost of regular neces-
sities. 
Last week, I had an opportunity to 
speak with Treasury Secretary Janet 
Yellen about why it is taking the ad-
ministration so long to recognize infla-
tion as a problem. She complained 
about other challenges the Biden ad-
ministration faced in January of 2021. 
Let’s look at what really has hap-
pened over the last 18 months. When 
President Biden took office, he was 
met with a growing economy that was 
already recovering from a global pan-
demic. We were already seeing the debt 
being addressed and starting to work in 
that direction. 
The COVID vaccine that had been de-
veloped from Operation Warp Speed 
was 
being 
distributed 
around 
the 
world, as well as throughout the 
United States. We were actually start-
ing to see inflation stabilized at a mere 
1.4 percent, and filling up your gas 
tank only cost $2.39, thanks to Amer-
ican energy independence. 
Despite 
all 
the 
pandemic-related 
challenges that Americans have gone 
through over the past year; consumer 
sentiment was relatively high at 79. 
But after a year of total Democrat con-
trol in the city, Americans no longer 
have a positive outlook on the econ-
omy. 
Our economy shrank in the first 
quarter. Americans are paying more 
for everything they buy on a regular 
basis. Gas has skyrocketed to an aver-
age above $5 per gallon, and consumer 
sentiment has dropped to a record low 
of 50.2. It is bad news for our country. 
Joe Biden and the Democrat policies 
are taking away the prosperity and the 
American Dream from families and 
small businesses across the country. 
You know, on Friday, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics released a staggering 
higher-than-expected inflation rate of 
8.6 percent, but that is the year-over- 
year number. It really doesn’t show the 
impact of inflation that has come up 
during the Biden administration, what 
a lot of people are calling Bidenflation. 
If we go back to January of 2021 when 
President Biden took office, we can see 
that month-over-month inflation is ac-
tually up a cumulative 11.4 percent. 
Think about that. If you bought some-
thing in January of 2021, it now costs 
11.4 percent more than it did. 
That is a marketplace average. Some 
products have been a whole lot higher 
than that. You see it in gas. You see it 
in meat, bacon, and milk. 
Now, what does that mean for the av-
erage American? We are looking at, for 
the average American household, an 
additional $635 in monthly costs. As 
you can see, prices have continued to 
climb 
for 
American 
families 
each 
month, meaning that on average, each 
household has already paid an addi-
tional $5,000 for these failed policies 
under the Biden administration. Even 
if inflation stays the same, households 
will pay an additional $7,620 over the 
next 12 months. 
My Republican colleagues and I un-
derstand how devastating this is for 
Americans. We warned for months that 
kneecapping American energy produc-
tion, while flooding the economy with 
Federal dollars and deficit spending, 
would create runaway inflation, as it 
has. 
Today, right now, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle could ease 
the burden on families by encouraging 
American energy production and stop-
ping their pursuit of Big Government 
spending sprees. We would have a 
stronger 
economy 
and 
a 
stronger 
America through energy independence, 
an ability to balance the Federal budg-
et, and a smaller government. 
These are the keys that will reverse 
course on a disastrous economy, and I 
would encourage my colleagues in the 
majority to disband this far left, ex-
treme agenda to face the crisis they 
have created. 
As we have talked about tonight, the 
debt continues to increase, and we need 
to focus on that. We need to focus on 
lowering the amount of ‘‘free stuff’’ 
that comes out of the United States 
Government and focus on what we need 
to do to help everyday Americans with 
the things that they go through and 
things that they have to deal with, 
their families and their small busi-
nesses. 
Again, I would like to close in thank-
ing my friend, JODEY ARRINGTON, for 
hosting this so that we can talk about, 
you know, the fiscal state of the coun-
try and what the problems are that we 
have to address going forward. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
couldn’t be more proud to serve along-
side of RON ESTES. The people of Kan-
sas are well served, letting him be their 
voice in the people’s House. 
You mentioned the disastrous eco-
nomic plan and policies of this admin-
istration. It is hard to believe what you 
didn’t mention that this President and 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle somehow think that the largest 
tax-and-spend bill is the solution. More 
spending. More spending. More flooding 
the market with Federal moneys. More 
expansion of welfare without work. 
We all want to take care of those 
folks who are working hard and still 
struggling. But, for example, the re-
fundable tax credit, child tax credit, 
where we would be paying thousands of 
dollars per child, per person, with no 
requirement to work, to contribute, to 
have ownership in this society, it is 
reckless. 
And, quite frankly, it is heartless be-
cause those policies trap people in pov-
erty. They don’t lift them out. They 
trap them in a life of dependency on 
the government. 
We want Americans to be the very 
best that God has created them to be 
and have the best quality of life and a 
chance for a better life for their fami-
lies. I thank my friend from Kansas. 
I am reminded of some great warn-
ings from our wise Founders. Ben 
Franklin said, ‘‘ . . . when you run into 
debt; you give another power over your 
liberty.’’ We are talking about robbing 
our children of their freedom, not just 
their economic opportunity and future 
prosperity. 
Thomas Jefferson said, ‘‘To preserve 
our independence, we must not let our 
rulers load us with perpetual debt.’’ 
Warning after warning. 
One of my favorites, our great father 
of this country, our first President, 
Commander in Chief George Wash-
ington, in his farewell address—think 
about it, penning a relatively short set 
of remarks, not only for those of his 
time, but for posterity, for future lead-
ers of the greatest country in the 
world. 
b 2110 
He gave three major warnings. He 
said: Be careful of foreign influence, be 
careful of the factions that will divide 
you within our own country, weak-
ening our bonds of unity, as I stand 
under the ‘‘e pluribus unum’’ motto, 
out of many one, that unifying spirit 
that made this country exceptional.

But he warned about fiscal irrespon-
sibility, and just to paraphrase, he 
said: We must avoid the accumulation 
of debt, not only by shunning occasions 
of expense, but by vigorous exertions in 
time of peace to discharge the debts, 
which unavoidable wars may have oc-
casioned, not ungenerously throwing 
upon posterity the burden, which we 
ourselves ought to bear. 
I mean, we are ungenerously throw-
ing upon posterity a burden of debt 
that we are not willing to bear. We are 
not willing to take the tough votes and 
pay for this and reduce our debt and 
deficit spending and give the next gen-
eration a chance, a fighting chance to 
have what we have had in this great 
country. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CLOUD), another freedom-fighting 
Texan who serves the coastal commu-
nities in the Lone Star State, Over-
sight and Reform Committee member 
and proud Texan, the lone Texan on 
the Agriculture Committee. I have tre-
mendous respect for him and his love 
for freedom, his love for the Lord, and 
his love for the people of this great 
country, from Texas’ 27th District. 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
JODEY for putting this together. I have 
enjoyed sitting with him in many of 
the meetings that he has called to 
work on fiscal responsibility, reaching 
across the aisle to see about having 
those important conversations, real-
izing the heavy task ahead of us, but 
also how important it is that we take 
it on. 
We are $30 trillion in debt. I like how 
JODEY framed it because $30 trillion is 
a hard number for us to grasp, but the 
idea that it is a deferred tax on our 
kids, it is nothing that we will have to 
pay, but it is a burden we are passing 
on to our kids in the name of spending 
today. 
Right now what we see happening in 
our Nation is families are struggling 
with inflation, inflation, and inflation. 
Right now many families are having to 
make the choice between food and fuel. 
You have families on a fixed income 
who suddenly their money doesn’t go 
as far as it went, and they are having 
to make tough choices, sometimes be-
tween medicine and food. 
You have others who have saved 
their whole life, worked their whole 
life, 
thinking 
their 
money 
would 
stretch a certain distance, and sud-
denly their life savings is not worth 
what it was. 
The Washington solution, of course, 
has been to spend more money, exacer-
bate the problem, put more money out 
there that causes more and more and 
more inflation. Typically what we see 
happen from big-spending politicians is 
they try to get away with selling this 
idea to the American people that their 
personal compassion is defined by how 
much of other people’s money we give 
away. 
That is the most absurd notion, the 
fact that we could spend other people’s 
money and somehow go back to the 
American people and say, How much do 
I care about you? It is not our money 
to spend. Real compassion would be 
doing the due diligence to make sure 
that we are not just voting on a bill 
that has some warm and fuzzy title but 
that we are doing the due diligence to 
make sure that it is actually accom-
plishing the objectives it was set forth 
to do. 
When we start a program or we start 
an agency, we come back and we check 
and we see, are they meeting their 
benchmarks, are they actually accom-
plishing it? A lot of times in Congress 
we will pass a bill out of the best of in-
tentions and find out later on that it is 
actually doing the opposite of what we 
intended it to do. 
Right now in Washington if you try 
to get a straight answer on how many 
programs or agencies exist in Wash-
ington, in our Federal bureaucracy, it 
is hard to get a straight answer, much 
less to know whether they are doing a 
good job or not, whether we are being 
wise with the taxpayer dollar or not. 
This is one reason I have authored 
and introduced here the Federal Sunset 
Commission Act. We have one in Texas. 
It has been effective at helping rein in 
government. It would bring every agen-
cy, every program before a commission 
and review it to see if it is something 
we should keep doing. Maybe there are 
a couple programs that are similar 
that we can consolidate, make them 
more efficient. Maybe there are some 
things that are just not accomplishing 
what they were set out to do. They 
may have been put out there with the 
best of intentions, but we need to stop 
it and give the taxpayer back their tax-
payer dollars. 
You know, when you study how na-
tions rise and fall throughout history, 
usually they crumble from within. 
Right now that is where we are at in 
the United States. We are not so much 
in danger of some invading force com-
ing across our borders, but we have not 
been diligent to spend wisely. We have 
been irresponsible. 
We are the world’s reserve currency, 
but we have not acted like the world’s 
reserve currency. If we are not careful, 
we will lose that very important stand-
ing that has helped us have the free-
dom and prosperity and, frankly, to be 
a light, to be a city on a hill, to be a 
nation that advances freedom and lib-
erty not only here at home but, frank-
ly, across the world. 
Some years ago, it was actually 
under the Bush administration, there 
was an intelligence report that came 
out that said basically the greatest 
transfer in all of history of wealth and 
power is happening right now from the 
Western countries to the Eastern coun-
tries. They said it was almost inevi-
table. It was a virtual certainty is the 
way it was phrased that this transition 
would happen. 
They said it was happening for two 
reasons. They said it was happening be-
cause we are sending oil and gas reve-
nues overseas and we are sending man-
ufacturing overseas. So basically the 
elites were taking the wealth and hard 
work of the American worker and send-
ing it to nations that have our not best 
interests in mind. And they call that 
good, sound policy. 
They said it was virtually inevitable. 
Well, in the last administration, we 
saw that we could, indeed, bring those 
oil and gas revenues back. We saw that 
actually brought peace and security to 
the world. We saw that we could begin 
to bring manufacturing back. 
If we release the American worker to 
do their job, to innovate, they can 
meet the challenges of the supply chain 
we face now. Let’s get government out 
of the way and let them do their best 
work. 
There is a story in Scripture of a 
good king Hezekiah, and history will 
record that he was a good king, but 
later on in life he made a big mistake. 
He invited an enemy country to come 
see the storehouses, to see where the 
temple treasuries were, to see where all 
the gold and weapons were stored up. A 
prophet came to him a couple days 
later, and he said, guess what, every-
thing that your ancestors have stored 
up will be taken away one day because 
of what you just did. And that was a 
tragic thing to hear. But what was 
even more tragic was his response 
when he said: Well, what you are say-
ing is good because at least it will not 
happen in my lifetime. 
We have too many people in this 
House who when it comes to legislation 
are willing to sugarcoat, willing to ac-
quiesce, willing to vote on that good 
and fuzzy bill because they know that 
the damage will not come in their life-
time, it won’t come in their political 
career. 
We have got to do what is right by 
the American people; do what is right 
for generations to come; and do what 
we need to do to save this great bastion 
of hope and freedom for the world, the 
United States of America. Thank you 
for hosting this. God bless you. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
wow, I have to really hold back here 
because I have other colleagues that 
have important things to say, but when 
I listen to my friend MICHAEL CLOUD, I 
am inspired because he is a man driven 
by conviction. I have watched him, and 
I admire his drive for truth, his seeking 
out what is best for the country. That 
is his measuring stick. 
In an institution full of so much ba-
loney and so many, pardon me, par-
tisan hacks, it is nice to have some-
body that just says, I want to do right 
by the Constitution, my constituents, 
and my kids. And that is what drives 
MICHAEL CLOUD. I am proud to serve 
with Representative CLOUD. I thank 
him for joining us for this discussion. 
We have another Kansan. I think we 
have had three Texans and two Kan-
sans, so we are still winning, we are 
still up one. TRACEY MANN is a new 
Member of Congress but not new to 
public service. He has led his great 
State as Lieutenant Governor.

Now, he might boast more wheat and 
sorghum there in his district, but he 
will never be able to produce more cot-
ton than Texas 19. I love that he is a 
champion for our producers, our ag 
producers, and I love that he is equally 
concerned about making sure we live 
within our means, we rein in our spend-
ing, and we reduce our national debt 
and get back to the fiscal footing that 
we all have confidence will be a gift, 
not a curse, and that we will, in fact, 
reverse the curse. 
We are going to get a chance in the 
next term. God willing, I think the peo-
ple are going to give us the chance to 
lead. And lead we must, which will re-
quire courage, and I know you have it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN), from 
the First District of Kansas. 
b 2120 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. ARRINGTON for doing this tonight. I 
thank him for being such a champion 
and continuing to raise this issue, 
which is incredibly important to all of 
the Midwest, the West Coast, the East 
Coast, our entire country, vitally im-
portant. 
I enjoyed the trip to west Texas the 
other day, and, yes, they grow more 
cotton than we do in Kansas, without a 
doubt. 
As mentioned already, we are more 
than $30 trillion in debt. We have added 
almost $6 trillion in the last 21⁄2 years, 
mostly in the name of COVID. We 
spent more money in the name of fight-
ing COVID than we spent to win World 
War II, in inflation-adjusted dollars. 
Let that sink in. It is absolutely mind- 
blowing. 
The debt is now $92,000 per American. 
For every American, your share of the 
American debt is $92,000. For my wife 
and four kids, our family’s share is 
$552,000. 
When you rack up this kind of debt, 
you really only have two choices. When 
you spend out of your means, you can 
pass it on in debt or you can raise 
taxes. I am really concerned with the 
potential tax increases that this out- 
of-control spending will lead to. 
That is why I rise today, because 
America is facing an economic crisis, 
and Democrat leaders are failing to 
provide the American people with any 
real solutions. Instead, they are just 
making things worse. Two aspects of 
this administration’s budget proposal 
will cause irreparable harm to the 
economy and health of rural America. 
House Democrats, for their part, 
want to distract the Federal Reserve 
with social policy while inflation is at 
a 40-year high. We have to solve this 
problem by decreasing spending, not by 
increasing taxes. 
In America today, farmers, ranchers, 
and ag producers are coping with prob-
lems that this administration has 
caused, like a broken supply chain, 
rampant inflation, and labor shortages. 
Now, the administration is threatening 
the stepped-up basis again and seeking 
to impose new capital gains taxes on 
the people who feed, fuel, and clothe us 
all. When the assets of family farms 
transfer to the next generation, the 
Federal Government should not jump 
in and impose taxes on the unrealized 
gain of these assets to pay for this out- 
of-control spending. This principle is 
called the stepped-up basis. It has a 
long precedent in the tax code, and 
President Biden wants to dismantle it 
to pay for all of this spending. 
Adding insult to injury, the Presi-
dent’s budget imposes capital gains 
taxes on farms that have been in fami-
lies for more than 90 years. Think 
about that. In 1940, the average cost of 
Kansas farmland was $50 an acre. Now, 
irrigated land is over $4,000 per acre. 
Imagine the capital gains tax implica-
tions on that history of ownership. 
This proposal would impose hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in new capital 
gains taxes on farmers, killing most 
farms overnight. 
In March, I introduced a bipartisan 
resolution, along with 82 of my col-
leagues, that supports the preservation 
of the stepped-up basis and opposes any 
efforts to impose new taxes on family 
farms and small businesses. 
The President’s budget is an attempt 
to extort money from rural Americans 
to pay for his party’s Big Government, 
socialist spending spree. The farm-kill-
er tax and the elimination of the 
stepped-up basis aren’t game changers 
for American family farms; they are 
game enders. Congress owes unwaver-
ing support to the American farmers, 
ranchers, and ag producers. 
A few days ago, the Department of 
Labor released yet another report of 
record-breaking 
inflation 
for 
the 
month of May, the highest in over 40 
years. House Democrats are responding 
this week by forcing a vote on a bill 
that would handcuff the Federal Re-
serve and force them to focus on social 
policy in addition to their statutory 
mandates of fighting high inflation and 
dealing with the unemployment rate, 
the missions for which the Federal Re-
serve was created. As if the economists 
at the Fed don’t have enough to worry 
about, House Democrats now want to 
assign them the task of setting social 
policy. Unbelievable. 
President 
Biden 
and 
Washington 
Democrats are completely out of touch 
with the American people on this issue 
of inflation, and they are out of touch 
with the needs of rural Americans. 
They need to wake up to reality and 
get to work on providing real solutions 
to the problems that Americans are 
facing. 
Record spending and debt will lead to 
America’s demise, and we cannot allow 
that to happen under our watch. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative MANN for bring-
ing up the stepped-up basis repeal. Re-
publicans didn’t get a vote in this larg-
est tax-and-spending bill that was 
called Build Back Better, that some 
have not so affectionately referred to 
as build back broke. Really, it adds, 
even according to CBO, trillions of dol-
lars in new debt. 
Worst of all, the Democrats nego-
tiated some of these provisions out be-
fore they passed it out of the House. 
One of them was the repeal of the 
stepped-up basis. Then, this President 
puts it back in the ‘‘Green Book’’ and 
says to the American farmers and 
ranchers, who put food on the table and 
give us food security, which is national 
security—we talk about energy inde-
pendence; you wait until the pain is 
felt by the food shortage, a whole other 
level of concern when it comes to sup-
ply chain. Less than 1 percent, a frac-
tion of a percent, we spend as a nation 
to have ag independence and have a 
stable ag economy through farm poli-
cies and a farm bill. This stepped-up 
basis, as I told Secretary Yellen, would 
create the largest fire sale of farm as-
sets in the history of our country. 
Farmers are cash poor. If the next 
generation of farmers inherits a death 
tax, after paying taxes out the wazoo 
on every level—income, sales, fran-
chise, you name it, they have paid it. It 
is an unfair, un-American double tax, 
and they don’t have the cash for it. It 
amounts to selling off the family farm 
because the vast majority will be 
forced to do that to pay more taxes. 
Mr. MANN. Which will lead to hun-
gry Americans. When you are well fed, 
you have a lot of problems. When you 
are not well fed, you have one problem. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Amen. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive MANN for his contributions to this 
important conversation with the Amer-
ican people. 
I am proud to have also met and be-
friended a gentleman from the great 
State of Utah. The first time we met, I 
talked about this bipartisan effort to 
get at the root causes of this broken 
budget process and reach across the 
aisle and simply force us, through the 
right incentives, to be responsible 
stewards, to get budgets out on time 
with budget outcomes that would re-
duce the debt. I remember that Rep-
resentative MOORE lit up at that dinner 
meeting and said: Sign me up. 
Ever since then, he has been on a 
mission. He has worked with his con-
stituents, put a task force together. He 
is prepared, as he looks at joining the 
Ways and Means Committee, which, by 
the way, when you look at 70 percent of 
our budget on auto-spend—that is, en-
titlement, mandatory programs. The 
vast majority of those, certainly the 
big drivers of our debt, are under the 
auspices and the authority and juris-
diction of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. I will heartily welcome him to 
the team in that regard. I appreciate 
his passion for this issue. 
Again, we will get an opportunity to 
serve and lead and govern, and we are 
going to need people like him to not 
only sound the alarm but assemble the 
team of people, the coalition of the 
willing, on both sides of the aisle, to do 
the right thing by the American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5482 
June 13, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE), who 
represents Utah’s First District. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Representative ARRINGTON 
for yielding. I am so appreciative that 
he brought up the night that we broke 
bread and the excitement that I had. I 
did, I lit up knowing that there was a 
real concerted effort to be able to forge 
a path forward to solve our Nation’s 
biggest problem. 
Make no mistake: This is our Na-
tion’s biggest problem. This is a na-
tional security threat. This is some-
thing that affects every single Amer-
ican. I am looking forward, and I owe it 
to every constituent, to make sure 
that I am working on solving the prob-
lem. 
b 2130 
I will not go back every couple years 
when we run for reelection and com-
plain about how much debt we have. I 
put the task force together so I could 
explain where we are at, what the ideal 
State looks like, what it should look 
like, what we need to strive for, and 
what are some near-term recommenda-
tions for us to be able to accomplish. 
You 
heard 
from 
Representative 
CLOUD. I have a provision that he put 
forth. 
I 
have 
numerous 
workforce 
ideas. We have 11 million jobs. That is 
a participation rate that would create 
an enormous amount of revenue if we 
could get all of those jobs filled. 
We have the opportunity ahead of us. 
There is a strong bipartisan collabora-
tion going on led with your motiva-
tion, and I believe in it, and I am will-
ing to work tirelessly because it is our 
Nation’s biggest problem. 
Among all my comments today, what 
I want to make sure that I highlight is 
that we have to look at the data at 
what works. We have to look in 2017— 
didn’t solve every problem; we still 
have a spending issue that Republicans 
weren’t able to address with the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, but it got our taxes 
on a globally competitive scale. That 
allowed for us to keep companies and 
workers here in America, growing the 
economy, growing that revenue that is 
needed so badly. 
What we did in 2017 was actually em-
powering Americans. What we have 
done in 2021—I greatly fear is what 
President Biden and the administra-
tion has focused on—is empowering 
government. In 2017 we empowered 
Americans. We empowered ingenuity. 
We empowered that to drive us for-
ward. And in the last year we have 
been 
empowering 
government. 
The 
massive amount of government spend-
ing has directly led to the inflation 
that we are seeing today. 
Few things impact the lives of our 
constituents as directly as the state of 
our economy. Utahns I know are des-
perately hurting. Grocery prices are 
out of whack. Gas prices—I will talk 
about that—they continue to sky-
rocket, reaching $5. I filled up for $5, 
the national average, in Utah, and it is 
predicted we could be at $6 a gallon in 
July. 
The Biden administration’s blatant 
economic mismanagement has put us 
on the precipice of a recession. We are 
seeing the effects of that. The indica-
tors are already there. From the Con-
sumer Price Index to the stock market 
to confidence indicators. We are seeing 
a recession come about as we have to 
raise interest rates to solve the self-in-
flicted mess that was created a year 
and a half ago when Democrats put in 
the 
American 
Rescue 
Plan 
masqueraded as the COVID bill, sup-
pressed our workforce and rampant in-
flation. This has been mishandled at 
every turn. 
The administration claimed that in-
flation posed a small risk and that the 
effects would be short lived, but Fri-
day’s Consumer Price Index report, 
which stated that the price of goods 
has increased 8.6 percent in the last 12 
months, validated what I have been 
hearing for months from my constitu-
ents, that inflation is hurting us, and it 
isn’t going away. 
Due to inflation, the average house-
hold pays an additional $460 per month 
for the same goods and services that 
they purchased just a year ago at this 
time. 
Last month, we experienced the high-
est inflation in 40 years, yet again 
breaking the Biden administration’s 
inflation records. 
Republicans sounded the alarm last 
year when Democrats in Congress 
rammed through trillions in partisan 
spending priorities. According to the 
Congressional Budget Office’s ‘‘May 
2022 Budget and Economic Outlook,’’ 
over the next 10 years our total deficits 
will equal $15 trillion with a deficit of 
$2.3 trillion in 2030 alone. 
This isn’t free money. Sooner or 
later, reckless spending like this will 
force tax increases on hardworking 
Americans. Inflation is already a tax 
on hardworking, lower-income Ameri-
cans that we say we are trying to help, 
and it does not help. That is an extra 
$460 a month on average. 
To reverse our poor economic out-
look, I organized a debt and deficit 
task force, and I already spoke about 
that a little bit, but it is with a group 
of really concerned citizens. These are 
experts in their field, across industry, a 
group of people that want to do this be-
cause they have fear, they have seen 
this in their lifetime with stagflation 
before, and they want to be a part of 
this and advise me in my role and how 
I can share that with all of my col-
leagues in Congress to be able to do 
four simple things: Grow the economy; 
save and strengthen vital programs; 
focus America’s spending; and fix Con-
gress’ budgeting process. That fourth 
piece is something that we have to 
come together on immediately, and I 
know there is bipartisan support to be 
able to do that. 
This task force will continue to de-
velop a clear vision for how we can best 
bring Utah’s fiscally sound policies to 
Washington 
to 
relieve 
inflationary 
pressure on hardworking families. I 
will continue to share our framework 
of solutions with my colleagues in Con-
gress. 
The United States has a flexible 
economy with a wealth of natural re-
sources and competitive demographics. 
We are the envy of the world, and we 
need to continue to remain the envy of 
the world. 
For the sake of each and every Utah 
family, we must get our fiscal house in 
order. Our plan will help do just that. I 
sincerely thank the gentleman from 
Texas for the encouragement. As I en-
tered into Congress to find a niche of 
something that I am so passionate 
about, I will continue to beat this 
drum until we make it work. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
MOORE), beating the drum and sound-
ing the alarm is a big part of it. I think 
at some point it is hard to calculate 
and get your mind around the trillions 
of dollars that are amassing. 
We have added $7 trillion in addi-
tional debt since COVID alone. And 
what happens, I believe, is when you do 
that and there is no consequence, there 
is no trade-off, we are not hitting them 
in the pocketbook saying, we need 
more of your hard-earned dollars to 
pay for this stuff, and we are not cut-
ting the favorite programs of our fel-
low Americans, so there is no pain. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Moral hazard. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Moral hazard. We 
are sleepwalking off the cliff. The prob-
lem with this crisis is, as I said, when 
Humpty Dumpty falls and shatters it is 
going to be difficult to put him and the 
exceptional nature and the superpower 
leadership of this great country back 
together. There is just not a lot of time 
and heads up and warning before you 
go over the precipice. 
It is incumbent on us, as young fa-
thers and young family men, to be able 
to take this on head-on with the cour-
age that our Founders had who gave 
birth to this great country. 
Madam Speaker, I hear you rattling 
the gavel, so God bless America, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) until 10 p.m. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we heard a little bit about inflation, 
and we are going to talk about the 
economy a little bit more. 
As has been widely reported, infla-
tion is at a 40-year high, the worst it 
has been since 1981. Over 8 percent. 
However, I feel that we are doing a dis-
service to the current situation to pre-
tend that inflation is only 8.3 percent. 
In the official figures they talk about 
housing going up 51⁄2 percent. Does any-
body think the cost of housing has only 
gone up 51⁄2 percent in the last year? I

know somebody who builds houses; the 
cost of a new house that he sells has 
gone up over 25 percent in the last 
year. 
We look at interest which has to be 
eaten by landlords or a person buying a 
house that has gone up from 21⁄2 per-
cent on a house to 41⁄2 percent in a 
year. That doesn’t sound like any 51⁄2 
percent to me. 
You look at, anecdotally, how much 
rent has gone up. You look at assess-
ments, how much they have gone up on 
property taxes. In Wisconsin, I am told 
it is not unusual to find 10 to 20 percent 
increases in assessments. 
When politicians talk about this 8.3 
figure, I think it is really a lot higher 
than that. There is no way the cost of 
housing and rentals in this country has 
only gone up 51⁄2 percent in the last 
year. 
I also had the pleasure in the last few 
days to talk to people in the auto-
mobile industry. The official numbers 
say used cars have gone up 16.1 percent 
in the last year. Where are you going 
to find that? People I know in the 
automotive retail industry talk about 
used cars going up 30 or 40 percent in 
the last year. 
First of all, we ought to be honest 
with the American people. When we 
talk about inflation at 8.3 percent, it is 
a lot higher than that. 
Now, in order to correct it, we have 
to look at the cause. What is the 
cause? 
We can start with the American Res-
cue Plan, one of the first things Presi-
dent Biden did. Larry Summers, an 
economist for President Obama called 
it 
the 
‘‘least 
responsible’’ 
macro-
economic policy in the last 40 years. So 
they had advanced warning. The expert 
who worked under Barack Obama told 
them this was going to be irrespon-
sible, but what did they do? They 
charged ahead anyway, spending an-
other $1.9 trillion the taxpayers didn’t 
have. 
b 2140 
And not long after that we got the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act. Nice sounding, wasn’t it? Amer-
ican Rescue and Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act. I always think it is 
kind of interesting the way they come 
up with names of irresponsible bills 
under here. That was another $1.2 tril-
lion. 
Between these two bills—at a time 
where it was so important that Con-
gress stop spending money—we hit the 
gas for another $3 trillion. If it weren’t 
for our friends, the Senators from Ari-
zona and West Virginia, they would 
have doubled that with a Build Back 
Better bill for another $4 trillion. I beg 
you all, please stop spending. 
In any event, the American Rescue 
Plan and the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, I think, are more 
than anything responsible for the out- 
of-control inflation. I believe they are 
artificially holding down the numbers 
to only 8.3 percent. 
When I talk to people back home, 
particularly on housing, particularly 
on used cars, to a certain extent on 
food, I think those numbers are artifi-
cially low. I think it is higher than 
that. 
People say: What can we do to get 
things back to where they should be? 
We just have to work our way back 
from that level of irresponsibility. 
Right now we are working on the budg-
et for calendar year 2023. In that budg-
et we have a 13.5 percent increase in 
nondefense discretionary spending. The 
days of 13.5 percent increases have got 
to be over. That number has to be re-
duced to zero, and I mean zero for de-
fense as well. 
We all know there are things in the 
defense budget that—at least rumors 
are—that are done more to benefit the 
people who are making the equipment 
than are actually going to be helpful in 
an all-out war. 
My suggestion is for both sides to 
agree that inflation is out of control. 
To recognize the only way to get it 
under control is to stop having the Fed 
print money and to show the rest of the 
world that we can contain things by 
committing ourselves to a zero percent 
increase in discretionary spending for 
2023. 
Part of the problem here, too, by the 
way, is the press corps. I don’t know if 
the press corps ever listens to us here. 
If the press corps wants to make a 
name for itself—as people with jour-
nalism degrees used to—they can do 
some poking around on that 8.3 percent 
and do their own research by talking to 
car dealers, by talking to people who 
build housing, and by talking to land-
lords. They can find out, is that 5.5 per-
cent housing cost up in the last year, is 
that accurate, or is the government 
trying to pull somebody’s leg? I know 
the answer, and it is time the press 
corps stops allowing people to get away 
with it. 
Madam Speaker, the second issue 
that I think has been underreported is 
what is going on in Ukraine. We last 
had a briefing, for Congress collec-
tively on Ukraine, on March 30, 2022. I 
want to know, and I would like to re-
quest right now of the majority party 
another briefing, by that I mean rep-
resentatives from the Department of 
Defense and representatives from the 
State Department, to see how exactly 
we are going to get out of this. 
I voted for more money for the plan 
because I felt that it is important for 
America to appear united, and in that 
vote, we knew it was going to pass. We 
know the majority party wanted a 
commitment 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
Ukraine was not short of munitions. 
However, I think it is important for 
the majority party to bring representa-
tives of the key departments before 
Congress as a whole. The reason I 
would like to talk to them is I don’t 
think enough has been talked about 
this. Are they working toward ending 
this war or not? 
We all know there are people in this 
building who, for whatever reason, 
seem to want to heighten the tensions 
in the war and get more American 
troops over there. There are the re-
sponsible people—of which I will clas-
sify myself as one—in which they want 
to work toward some sort of peace 
treaty here before things get even more 
out of control. 
We are dealing with a country, Rus-
sia, that has the ability to create eco-
nomic havoc all over Western Europe, 
and, 
quite 
frankly, 
economic 
and 
human 
dislocations 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
We should be briefed to see where the 
administration is on this topic. These 
are confidential briefings. In the past, I 
have sometimes gotten answers I like, 
and sometimes I have gotten answers I 
don’t like. It would be good if the ad-
ministration would hear from Congress 
and see what they want. 
Do they want this war heightened— 
tensions heightened? Do they want the 
United States to provide troops as 
backup here? Do they want the admin-
istration to be working toward an end 
to the war? 
As I said before, we are dealing with 
two countries who have problems. 
Their birth rates are low. Ukraine has 
the second lowest birth rate of the 100 
largest countries in the world. Russia’s 
birth rate is not that high either. Both 
countries have people leaving their 
countries, sometimes to the United 
States and sometimes other places. 
In any event, I would like to make a 
request to the majority party that we, 
one more time, be briefed collectively 
to see what is going on. I think, by the 
way, that is something that our incuri-
ous press corps ought to be looking at 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, the next thing I 
would like to address—not one of my 
top 20 topics—but for the mainstream 
media, they feel what happened Janu-
ary 6, 2021, is very important. It is im-
portant. We are having a committee on 
it. 
I don’t think I would rather spend my 
time on the committee. I would rather 
spend my time fighting inflation, try-
ing to find solutions to the Ukraine 
problem, trying to find solutions to the 
border, trying to do something about 
the huge number of people who are 
dying of drug overdoses in this coun-
try. 
Nevertheless, it is in the news that a 
committee is looking into what hap-
pened on January 6. I feel it is impor-
tant to put all the cards on the table, 
and it is important that America know 
exactly all we have available to deter-
mine what happened on January 6. 
A considerable time ago, me and two 
congressmen—8 months ago—myself, 
Congressman 
NORMAN
from 
South 
Carolina, and Congressman GOHMERT 
from Texas wrote a letter to Merrick 
Garland and asked the Department of 
Justice to release any footage of tapes 
as far as what went on here that day. 
Unless it is going to be released, we 
really don’t know all we should know. 
I am sure there are both Democrats 
and Republicans who would like to

June 13, 2022 
know all we have as far as what actu-
ally happened that day. What tapes 
were available because they are taking 
picture of us all the time from this 
building. 
To my dismay, 8 months later, the 
Department of Justice has still not an-
swered our plea for these tapes. Even-
tually it gets beyond the idea of just 
we want everything to be available, 
people begin to think that the Depart-
ment of Justice is hiding something. 
Madam Speaker, I will make the re-
quest verbally and eventually follow up 
with some sort of written document 
asking the Department of Justice to 
release all the video footage of what 
happened in and around this building 
on January 6. I think until it is re-
leased there are going to be members of 
the public who believe that something 
is being hidden that day. Right now it 
is part of this country’s history, but I 
see no reason to continue this game of 
not allowing the American public to 
know what the Justice Department 
must already know about what hap-
pened that day. 
By the way, I also feel if Congress-
woman CHENEY wants to be a little bit 
of an asset on that committee because 
she has a bigger mouthpiece than my-
self, she could demand and create a lit-
tle bit of a raucous on that committee 
and demand to see all these tapes, so 
we know who really was behind things 
and what to make of various theories 
that are out there. 
b 2150 
That is another issue that the press 
corps back in the good old days, where 
they liked to report on what is going 
on in this country, would routinely be 
against secrecy in government and 
would demand that those tapes be re-
leased. I do not know where the press 
corps is. They have the potential to im-
prove this country, but they don’t like 
to get out there and apparently inform 
the people. And they are not ade-
quately skeptical of people in power. 
Now I will address another issue that 
I think the press corps ought to be 
picking up and the American public 
ought to know more about. I have ad-
dressed COVID many times. Over 1 mil-
lion people have died. When COVID 
broke, several briefings were held for 
all Congressmen and others for the 
Oversight and Reform Committee on 
which I serve. I would bet in the first 3 
months of the COVID crisis I must 
have attended five or six hearings in 
which I had a chance to talk to the rel-
ative experts, Anthony Fauci and oth-
ers, about COVID. 
Then we switched to an isolated, 
small subcommittee where only a 
small fraction of the people in this 
Congress got a chance to ask questions. 
And at that time, with the rest of us 
left out, I think there are a lot of top-
ics that the press should be looking 
into that we would have a chance to 
ask questions about but are not being 
asked. 
As I said, when over 1 million Ameri-
cans have died, I would think the press 
would express an interest. I, many 
times before, have stood at this micro-
phone and talked about the benefits of 
vitamin D, and experts beginning two 
Septembers ago, well before the vac-
cine was even released, were putting 
papers out there saying how much vita-
min D could prevent deaths. Now peo-
ple who don’t like to push vitamin D 
will say that the studies out there only 
show correlation, not causation. But 
the same thing could be said about 
other things that clearly are connected 
with COVID deaths. 
Recently, Dr. Amiel Dror of Israel 
found that people with vitamin D lev-
els under 20 nanograms per milliliter 
were 11 times more likely to die than 
people who weren’t. 
Isn’t that something interesting? 
Can you imagine, Madam Speaker, 
how many less people would have died 
if the public health establishment and 
the medical establishment had pushed 
vitamin D initially? 
This study is interesting and con-
sistent with prior studies. 
Where is the medical establishment? 
Where is the public health establish-
ment in either pushing vitamin D or 
apologizing for not pushing it in the 
past? 
By the way, when calculating vita-
min D deficiency—which they are cal-
culating at 20 nanograms per milliliter, 
not very much—84 percent—I don’t like 
talking about race; I don’t think Amer-
ica is this horrible racist country that 
some people on the other side of the 
aisle claim—but when calculating vita-
min D deficiency, about 84 percent of 
Blacks in the country are vitamin D 
deficient compared to 35 percent of 
Whites. Blacks are 70 percent more 
likely to die of COVID. Every expert I 
have talked to believes the reason of 
heightened deaths in the Black com-
munity is the result of a lack of vita-
min D. 
By the way, it is even higher among 
Native Americans. 
I do not know why the public health 
establishment and the politicians have 
not gone out of their way to share 
these numbers with people of color. All 
Americans should have been alerted to 
the benefit of vitamin D. All people 
over age 60 should have been given a vi-
tamin D test to see if they were under 
that 20 nanograms threshold. I think 
anyone of color regardless of age 
should be given the test. But for what-
ever reason, no money was put into 
this, not a lot was publicized. 
One million Americans died. Black 
Americans were 70 percent more likely 
to die than White Americans, and noth-
ing was done. I think that is a scandal. 
I think we ought to have more hearings 
before Congress collectively so we can 
have a chance to ask the public health 
establishment why they were dropping 
the ball here. 
I think the American press corps— 
which was asleep at the switch here— 
should have been publicizing these 
numbers a lot more. And the American 
press corps should have been out there 
asking questions to Anthony Fauci and 
the other bureaucrats as to why it was 
not more publicized and why didn’t 
they specifically highlight the in-
creased number of deaths among people 
of color. 
I personally believe if it was the 
other way around, they might have 
been a little bit more forthright in ex-
plaining what is going on and the de-
gree to which a lack of vitamin D cor-
related with additional deaths from 
COVID. 
One 
other 
thing 
for 
the 
sub-
committee to look at, if they get done 
talking about vitamin D, now that 
COVID is a lot less likely to lead to 
death, recently a new drug called 
Paxlovid was introduced. You can get a 
5-day dosage of that drug, which is rec-
ommended, for $530. It is not cheap. 
Pfizer right now, I am told, expects to 
earn $27 billion dollars in sales from 
Paxlovid—$27 billion. That is a lot of 
money. They made a lot of money on 
other things as well on the COVID. 
When you are talking about making $27 
billion on a drug, just a few little pills, 
a 5-day dosage, $530, I would think the 
subcommittee would want to look into 
that and see if there is an excessive 
amount of money being charged for 
that drug. I would think the slum-
bering press ought to be looking into it 
as well. 
Twenty-seven billion dollars in sales? 
That is what it says. 
So if anybody out there wants to find 
something to talk about rather than 
some of the trivial issues that domi-
nate our newspapers, they can look 
into the rich and powerful one more 
time and see whether the payment for 
Paxlovid are a little bit excessive. 
The final topic tonight is a topic that 
is no secret but right now people are 
planning for the next session and see-
ing what problems in America we 
should address. 
I personally have been outspoken. I 
think one problem that needs imme-
diate attention is what is going on at 
the border. We also have to do some-
thing to make sure that we don’t wind 
up in a more serious war with Ukraine 
or a war with China. These are vitally 
important. 
But in the long run, the future of 
America comes down to its moral fiber. 
This country has since the mid 1960s 
strongly subsidized or strongly dis-
criminated against the American nu-
clear family. 
We know that Karl Marx—and there 
are a surprising number of academics 
in America who are drawn to social-
ism—Karl Marx felt in order for social-
ism to exist, you had to get rid of the 
family. We all know that in the last 
election Black Lives Matter was a pow-
erful group and that Blacks Lives Mat-
ter, the founders anyway, were opposed 
to the traditional American nuclear 
family—or as they describe it, the 
Western 
prescribed 
nuclear 
family, 
which is a lie by the way. We have nu-
clear families in countries that are not 
Western countries. There are nuclear

families all over Latin America, sub- 
Sahara Africa, and Asia. But, in any 
event, it is apparent that powerful 
groups in this country want to destroy 
the nuclear family. And probably no 
policy did more to aid in the destruc-
tion of the American family than Lyn-
don Johnson’s war on the family. I 
think he called it the War on Poverty, 
but it was really the war on the family 
is what it amounted to. 
I hope after almost 60 years or ap-
proaching 60 years after the war on the 
family and the huge expansion of the 
welfare state that this Congress would 
begin to address the discrimination 
against the traditional family. 
Madam Speaker, if you look at the 
welfare programs—whichever program 
that you look at, be it health insur-
ance, be it SNAP, but be it WIC, be it 
the earned income tax credit—which 
was a very anti-marriage program 
which was actually initiated by a Re-
publican—all 
low-income 
housing, 
daycare, TANF, Pell grants, and other 
provisions—program 
after 
program 
after program—are designed to take 
tax dollars from the traditional family 
and give it more to other families. It is 
no problem to help everybody, but I 
think when you clearly set up pro-
grams designed not to go to the nu-
clear family, you are discriminating 
against them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, Democratic and Republican 
negotiators announced an agreement 
on a framework for bipartisan gun safe-
ty legislation, bringing the Senate one 
step closer to finally—finally—respond-
ing to the plague of gun violence that 
afflicts our Nation and terrorizes our 
children. 
For the first time in a long time, the 
Senate has a path forward on legisla-
tion that will save lives, reduce gun vi-
olence, and keep our communities safe. 
Make no mistake about it, we have a 
lot of work left to do before we actu-
ally pass a bill, but yesterday’s an-
nouncement was a positive and nec-
essary step in the right direction. 
Now comes the important work of 
turning this framework into legislation 
and legislative language that can pass 
Congress and be signed by the Presi-
dent. We must continue working with 
the urgency that this moment demands 
because, if we can save even one life 
from gun violence, it will well be worth 
it. 
Once the text of this agreement is fi-
nalized, and I hope it will be as soon as 
possible, I will put this bill on the 
floor, quickly, so the Senate can move 
quickly to make gun safety reform a 
reality. 
As I said, I will put this bill on the 
floor as soon as possible once the text 
of the final agreement is finalized so 
the Senate can act quickly to make 
gun safety reform a reality. So I urge 
my colleagues to continue working 
with the same good faith and urgency 
that has brought us to this point. 
Certainly, 
yesterday’s 
agreement 
does not have everything Democrats 
wanted, but it nevertheless represents 
the most significant reform to gun 
safety laws that we have seen in dec-
ades. If enacted, this legislation will 
make it harder for mass shooters to ac-
cess assault rifles by enhancing back-
ground checks for those under 21. It 
will prevent tragedies before they hap-
pen by helping States with their red 
flag laws. It will prevent gun violence 
at home by closing the so-called boy-
friend loophole and establish new pen-
alties for gun traffickers. It will make 
our neighborhoods safer by investing in 
mental health and community violence 
intervention 
programs. 
The 
lion’s 
share of gun violence happens outside 
the national spotlight, and these inter-
vention programs are some of the most 
effective ways to reduce crime and 
make our communities safer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2900 
June 13, 2022 
Altogether, this framework is a good 
and necessary first step towards chang-
ing the reality of gun violence in 
America. It will lay the foundation for 
future action. Most importantly, this 
legislation will go a long way toward 
saving lives. 
I want to thank Senators MURPHY, 
SINEMA, CORNYN, and TILLIS for work-
ing assiduously on this framework. 
Senator MURPHY asked me for space 
to let the negotiators do their work, 
and I was glad to give it to them be-
cause we knew that any chance of get-
ting something real done on gun safety 
was worth the effort. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
who were part of the bipartisan guns 
working 
group, 
including 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL, MANCHIN, COONS, HEIN-
RICH, and others. 
I want to thank all the advocates, 
families, and volunteers who lost loved 
ones, who shared their stories, who 
marched to make a change. Without 
the advocates, the families, and the 
volunteers who lost loved ones, this 
bill wouldn’t have happened because 
year after year after shooting after 
shooting, they didn’t give up. They per-
sisted, and it helped bring us to this 
important moment. 
For decades, families across the 
country have seen the same dismal pat-
tern play out whenever a mass shoot-
ing strikes the Nation—tragedy fol-
lowed by inaction. From Columbine to 
Virginia Tech, to Sandy Hook, to Las 
Vegas, to Parkland, to Buffalo, to 
Uvalde, and to so many others, grid-
lock has prevented Congress from 
bringing solace to families in grief. 
But no matter how many shootings 
have traumatized this Nation, these 
families have never given up in their 
hope of making change happen. Rather 
than curse the darkness, these families 
have responded to tragedy by lighting 
candles. They have shared their sto-
ries, they have marched for change, 
and they have done everything in their 
power to make sure no other parent, 
spouse, or sibling has to suffer the pain 
they have felt and live with every day. 
The same is true for all the advo-
cates, and there are so many groups 
who have worked on gun safety. Many 
members of these groups are survivors 
of gun violence. I have a person on my 
staff who is a survivor of Aurora. They 
all worked tirelessly for years to enact 
commonsense gun safety laws. 
Despite decades of frustrating grid-
lock, I hope that yesterday’s announce-
ment brings some sense of accomplish-
ment to these grieving families and to 
all of those who have marched and pro-
tested and written letters and tweeted 
because it is thanks to them we are at 
the threshold of progress. 
Nearly 30 years ago, I was the author 
of the Brady background checks bill, 
and that was the last time Congress 
took meaningful action to address gun 
violence. It was a different era back 
then, but the lesson of that experience 
remains relevant today: The right law 
can decrease gun deaths. I believe that 
there are tens of thousands of people 
alive today because the Brady law was 
passed in 1994. They don’t know who 
they are, we don’t know who they are, 
but it is virtually certain that that law 
saved thousands and thousands of lives. 
I urge my colleagues to think of all 
the lives we can now save by turning 
this framework into law. Americans 
have waited long enough for us to take 
action. Too many lives—too many— 
have been already lost. Too many fami-
lies—too many—have been left griev-
ing. 
While we can’t undo the tragedies of 
the past, we can act now to make them 
less likely in the future. If this frame-
work is enacted into law, it will do pre-
cisely that, and I urge all of us to con-
tinue working to pass gun safety legis-
lation soon. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Madam President, now on the PACT 
Act, as negotiations continue off the 
floor on gun safety reform, today, the 
Senate will move forward with the 
most significant expansion of veteran 
healthcare benefits in decades—in dec-
ades. In a few hours, the Senate will 
vote on cloture on the substitute 
amendment for the PACT Act, which 
Chairman TESTER and Ranking Mem-
ber MORAN have been working on for 
months. It is my hope that we can fi-
nally pass this legislation in the next 
few days, well before the week is out. 
The changes outlined by the PACT 
Act are long overdue. It would make 
sure any veteran suffering from toxic 
exposure in the line of duty could get 
the VA benefits they deserve. It would 
end the indignity that too many vet-
erans face right now of carrying the 
burden of toxic exposure on their own 
and being forced to jump through hoop 
after hoop after hoop by the VA before 
they can get any benefits, and many of 
them never get them. As many as 31⁄2 
million veterans could benefit from the 
reforms brought about by this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to keep working 
so we can push this bill over the finish 
line A-S-A-P because both sides want 
it, our veterans deserve it, and the vet-
erans 
service 
organizations—the 
VSOs—have been telling Congress for 
years that change is needed at the VA. 
So before the week is out, the Senate 
should do its job and pass this bill. 
SHIPPING REFORM 
Madam President, now on the ship-
ping bill, a few months ago, the Senate 
unanimously passed legislation to fight 
inflation by fixing unfair shipping 
practices that are clogging our ports 
and straining our supply chains. To-
night, the House will finally act on 
that bill and send it to the President’s 
desk. 
Inflation is the greatest frustration 
America has right now, and backlogs 
at our ports are one of the biggest driv-
ers of price hikes that we will address 
through this bill. 
By now, we have all seen pictures of 
scores of ships lining up in ports from 
Las Vegas to Savannah, to Seattle, to 
New York and New Jersey. These back-
logs have not only caused great harm 
for American exporters trying to send 
their products out into the world, they 
have also skyrocketed the price of 
goods coming into this country. The 
backlogs create a brutal double wham-
my that ultimately leaves American 
families paying the price. 
I applaud Speaker PELOSI and all of 
my House colleagues for taking action 
on this shipping reform bill, and I want 
to thank my colleagues here in the 
Senate—Senators 
KLOBUCHAR
and 
THUNE, the authors of the legislation; 
Chairwoman 
CANTWELL, 
who 
shep-
herded it through; and others for their 
leadership when this bill was before the 
Senate. 
By reforming unfair shipping prac-
tices, Congress is taking a much need-
ed step to lowering costs, clearing our 
ports, and relieving supply chains. I 
thank all of my colleagues for a job 
well done.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The minority leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
runaway inflation has pushed workers 
and families to the breaking point. Ac-
cording to one recent poll, nearly 60 
percent of Americans are making an ef-
fort to drive less and cut back on elec-
tricity use. Three in four are pinching 
their budgets for food and entertain-
ment outside the home, and two-thirds 
are bracing for prices to climb even 
higher in the coming year. 
Six months ago, in December, Presi-
dent Biden told the American people 
we had reached the ‘‘peak’’—the peak— 
‘‘of the crisis’’ with inflation. He said 
that prices would start falling ‘‘over 
the next couple months.’’ But like so 
many of Democrats’ other confident 
predictions about our economy, the 
President’s statement has proven com-
pletely false. 
Friday morning’s inflation report 
provided more official confirmation of 
what American consumers know pain-
fully well: The Democrats’ out-of-con-
trol inflation is not letting up. In fact, 
it is actually getting worse. 
This year to May, consumer prices 
rose 8.6 percent, blowing away expecta-
tions, jumping a full percentage point 
over the previous month and setting— 
you guessed it—a new 40-year high. The 
data underneath tell a brutal story for 
working families and American busi-
nesses. The categories driving inflation 
last month were the ones they can’t do 
without. 
Overall energy prices clocked a year- 
on-year increase of nearly 35 percent. 
Drivers are paying 48.7 percent more at 
the pump. And fuel oil consumers have 
seen prices more than double. 
Food costs continue to climb at over 
10 percent. Grocery prices, in par-
ticular, hit nearly 12 percent inflation, 
the worst year since 1979. And full serv-
ice restaurant prices saw their largest 
increase on record. 
Of course, that is not to mention the 
31-year high for inflation in the serv-
ices sector, the 35-year high for rent in-
flation, or the 42-year high for rising 
airfare. 
Day by day, all of these painful mile-
stones add up to one simple reality: 
Americans’ hard-earned dollars aren’t 
going nearly as far as they once did. 
Runaway inflation has swallowed up 
any shot of rising pay bringing more 
prosperity. In fact, the average worker 
has seen a 3.9-percent pay cut in the 
last year. 
One mother of two in Indiana re-
cently reported that she is earning 
more than she ever has in her career 
but ‘‘says she still feels like she is fi-
nancially losing ground.’’ This is what 
she had to say: 
I should be able to live on my own. I’m get-
ting ready to pay rent and it’s going to take 
every single dime I’ve made. 
As 
one 
of 
my 
constituents 
in 
Barbourville put it recently, ‘‘We’re 
cutting back on everything—and I 
mean everything. Gas, meat, bread, it’s 
all expensive as hell. One moment you 
think you can afford to buy something, 
then you go to the store and it’s like, 
‘Nope, can’t get that anymore either.’’’ 
And here is a real kicker. One young 
couple in Utah has taken to asking 
themselves 
weekly, 
‘‘What 
did 
we 
spend money on that we could not have 
spent money on?’’ 
Imagine if Washington Democrats 
were willing to engage in that sort of 
self-reflection. Remember, it was their 
policy choices that made this painful 
situation possible. It was the Demo-
crats’ choice to insist on flooding— 
flooding—the economy with trillions of 
dollars in liberal spending last spring. 
And it was Democrats’ choice to spend 
months last summer and fall working 
on ways to pour even more gasoline on 
the fire, even though working families 
were already feeling the pinch of infla-
tion. 
The Democratic leader himself said 
last spring: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation, at 
least in the near term, are very real. 
None other than some of his own par-
ty’s top economists warned the exact 
opposite. But Washington Democrats 
were not to be deterred. Working fami-
lies’ budgets took a backseat to the 
far-left’s wish list, and now Democrats’ 
decision is literally driving them off a 
cliff. 
H.R. 3967 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the Senate is in the middle of pro-
posing major legislation to expand 
healthcare access for veterans exposed 
to toxic substances in the line of duty. 
Doing right by our vets is a bipartisan 
priority. An 86-vote majority of us 
voted to begin processing this bill a few 
days back, myself included. 
This legislation is not a minor fix; it 
is a series of major—major—changes to 
help more veterans. So the precise lan-
guage of the final bill will have major 
consequences for veterans, for policy, 
and for government spending. 
Republicans have pushed to get votes 
on a few commonsense amendments 
that would make this bipartisan bill 
even stronger for our veterans. For ex-
ample, one of these amendments would 
make sure the veterans who are al-
ready in line—those who are waiting 
now, already in line—waiting for treat-
ment under the current rules are not 
disserved or treated unfairly as an un-
intended consequence of the new ex-
pansion. Surely that should be com-
pletely without controversy. 
Another amendment would clarify 
how the government accounts for the 
new funding to make sure the new leg-
islation does not impose major unin-
tended consequences on the appropria-
tions process. 
Another amendment would make it 
clear that new medical presumptions 
must rest on sound science, so Con-
gress does not substitute our judgment 
for the experts’. 
These are not controversial amend-
ments. They are directly related to the 
substance of this bill. And given the 
magnitude of the changes under consid-
eration, the Senators sponsoring these 
amendments have every right to expect 
votes on the floor. There is no reason 
why this important bipartisan bill 
should be denied a bipartisan floor 
process. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2902 
June 13, 2022 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GUN LEGISLATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I got 
the news, along with others, Sunday 
morning about the decision of 10 Re-
publican and Democratic Senators to 
move forward with the proposal to deal 
with our Nation’s epidemic of gun vio-
lence. I had a conversation with Sen-
ator CHRIS MURPHY, who has been one 
of our leaders on the Democratic side, 
about exactly what that meant and the 
help that we might be able to offer to 
him from the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
I just want to say, at this moment, 
that I really want to commend my col-
leagues on both sides, Democrats and 
Republicans. I believe they made a 
good-faith effort to negotiate a pack-
age of reforms. Senator MURPHY, Sen-
ator CORNYN of Texas, made it bipar-
tisan, timely, and I believe did an ex-
cellent job. Is it the package that I 
would have written? No—nor yours, 
Madam President. You would have in-
cluded things, and I would have in-
cluded others. But it is within our 
reach. 
We have a bitterly politically divided 
nation. That is a fact. We have a Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee evenly di-
vided 50–50. We have a Chamber evenly 
divided 50–50. So it is difficult to say 
that any one party or one person will 
get exactly what they want in this po-
litical atmosphere, but it is equally 
important to note that we have all 
gone home and gotten the message 
over and over again. Whether it was in 
reference to the supermarket killing in 
Buffalo, the fourth grade school class 
in Uvalde, TX, or the doctor and other 
bystanders being killed in a Tulsa, OK, 
hospital, all of that has occurred in the 
last few days. 
The American people have reacted 
with one voice, and they have said to 
us two words: ‘‘Do something.’’ To 
Members of Congress, don’t just tell us 
you are going to give us your thoughts 
and prayers. Do something. 
Well, I think this decision to move 
forward could help. Every provision in 
this agreement could save a life. For 
that reason, if for no other, I will be 
supporting it. 
This agreement would support ‘‘red 
flag’’ laws. It is one way they charac-
terize them. ‘‘Crisis intervention or-
ders’’ is another. Many States—19—al-
ready have them. It would also close 
dangerous gaps in Federal law that en-
able domestic abusive boyfriends to get 
guns. 
I want to commend Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, who has been the leader in the 
U.S. Senate on that issue. We tried to 
help her on a previous piece of legisla-
tion, and it didn’t have the votes to do 
it, but if it is included in this package, 
I will definitely support it, and I thank 
her for her leadership. 
It also would strengthen the back-
ground check system by clarifying 
which gun sellers would be required to 
conduct background checks. That is a 
step in the right direction. I hope there 
is more coming. 
The agreement would provide funds 
for desperately needed mental health 
and trauma support services, including 
more school counselors for enhanced 
school safety. 
I can’t tell you how critically impor-
tant that is. Half of the people who die 
because of a gun in America commit 
suicide. It is a plea for help that we 
should be answering. This could help. 
We also know that some of the people 
who pick up these guns and go shooting 
children and innocent people have seri-
ous mental illness problems. They need 
counseling, too, and we need to find 
ways to reach them. 
I also want to add that we have a dif-
ferent form of gun violence in big cities 
like Chicago. Many of these crimes are 
committed by kids and gangs, and 
these kids—90 percent-plus of them— 
have been victims of trauma in their 
lives. Things have happened to them 
which they can never forget, and they 
need help to deal with them. So mental 
health counseling and trauma coun-
seling are critical to reducing gun vio-
lence at all of these different levels. 
Importantly, the framework would 
crack down on the straw purchasing 
and the illicit trafficking of guns. Last 
August, an amazing young woman who 
was 
a 
Chicago 
policewoman, 
Ella 
French, was on duty with her partner, 
sitting in the squad car, when a man 
walked up and shot her in the head and 
killed her. Then he shot the other offi-
cer and blinded him in one eye. The 
gun that he used to kill the police-
woman was the subject of a straw pur-
chase. 
What does that mean? That means 
that he could never have cleared a 
background check. He was a convicted 
felon. So he finds a friend or a 
girlfriend to go in and buy it—someone 
who has no criminal record—and then 
he hands the gun over to him, and he 
turns around and kills a wonderful Chi-
cago policewoman. The outpouring of 
sentiment in favor of Ella French and 
her family was overwhelming. 
I hope that we can get this provision, 
which I have worked on with Senators 
Collins and Leahy, included in the final 
passage so as to tighten up the pen-
alties on those who make straw pur-
chases. 
If you are going to stand up and lie to 
buy a gun so that you can give it to 
someone who can’t pass a background 
check, you ought to pay dearly for 
that. It cost Ella French her life, and I 
hope that we stick with this provision 
all the way through. 
The last point is especially impor-
tant because I have met her mother; I 
have met the officer who was in the car 
with her; and I met his family. I know 
how much this particular incident has 
meant to each and every one of their 
lives. 
Does an agreement like this do ev-
erything that I would like? No, it 
doesn’t, but this, if we can pass it, will 
be the most significant gun violence 
reform in 30 years in Congress—30 
years. We now have more guns than 
people in this country. They estimate 
some 400 million guns. They can’t even 
give me anywhere close to an exact 
number of how many AR–15s we have in 
this country. I have heard estimates 
that people are convinced the number 
ranges from 10 to 20 million of these 
AR–15 military assault-type weapons. 
We have a long way to go before we 
reach the finish line, but I want to 
commend those Senators who have 
worked so hard to bring us to this 
point. I will just make it very clear: I 
am prepared to do everything I can as 
a Senator and as whip to bring the 
votes together to get this done as 
quickly as possible. 
STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS 
Now, Madam President, on another 
matter, 2 weeks ago, the Education De-
partment announced it would wipe out 
$5.8 billion in student loan debt owed 
by 560,000 borrowers who had attended 
for-profit Corinthian Colleges in the 
last 20 years. Corinthian Colleges was 
one of the largest, most corrupt, most 
unscrupulous companies in the for- 
profit college industry, but it wasn’t 
alone in its shady dealings—far from it. 
So the basic primer on for-profit col-
leges and universities—the question 
that you are going to face on the final 
exam—is this: What two numbers tell 
the whole story about for-profit col-
leges and universities? The numbers 8 
and 30. What do they mean? Eight per-
cent of high school graduates go to for- 
profit colleges and universities—8 per-
cent. Thirty percent of all of the stu-
dent loan defaults in the United States 
are of students from for-profit colleges 
and universities. 
Why? Why are these students who at-
tend for-profit schools failing to make 
their student loan payments? 
Well, first, these for-profit industry 
schools charge too much in tuition. 
The students can’t keep up with the 
debt, so they borrow more. They reach 
a point where something happens, and 
they have to drop out—afraid of the 
debt they have accumulated. 
At the next stage, some finish. They 
take their diplomas from their for- 
profit schools, and they learn, unfortu-
nately, that they are almost worthless. 
Westwood College is one of those fraud-
ulent for-profit colleges. It operated 15 
campuses in 5 different States, includ-
ing Illinois—Westwood College. I re-
member driving out to O’Hare Airport 
and looking up at the side of one of 
those tall office buildings. They had a 
sign for Westwood College, and I 
thought: What a fraud. 
Like 
the 
Corinthian 
Colleges, 
Westwood used high-pressure sales and 
marketing tactics and outright lies to 
pressure students to take on huge 
amounts of student debt. Students in 
Westwood’s criminal justice program 
in Illinois were told that a Westwood

criminal justice degree would all but 
guarantee them a good-paying job with 
the local police department, maybe 
even with the FBI. What a lie. 
Victoria Vences is one of the thou-
sands of Illinois students who heard 
those lies and is paying the price for it. 
Victoria is the first person in her fam-
ily ever to attend college, and that is 
the case more often than not. These 
students come from families with no 
college experience and don’t know 
where to turn. They look at the adver-
tising and, unfortunately, fall for it. 
They sign up for these for-profit 
schools like Westwood. 
Victoria enrolled in the criminal jus-
tice program at Westwood in 2007, be-
lieving it would help her land a job as 
a probation officer or maybe even with 
the Immigration Services. After 3 
years of juggling full-time jobs and 
going to school full time, Victoria was 
shocked to learn that a Westwood de-
gree would not pay off at all. At that 
time, she owed $50,000 in student loans 
that she had taken out at Westwood. 
Not wanting to take out more loans for 
a useless degree, she dropped out. She 
started applying for law enforcement 
jobs, showing them the certificate of 
her transcript from Westwood, and 
they told her that it was worthless. 
Victoria now works for the Illinois 
Domestic Violence Hotline. She likes 
her job, and she helps a lot of people, 
but she has never earned enough of an 
income to make the monthly payments 
on her student loans. Victoria Vences 
isn’t someone who shirks responsi-
bility. She is helping to raise a niece 
and a nephew who live with her. She 
doesn’t believe that she should have to 
pay back $50,000 in loans because of the 
deception. I agree. 
Last week, I wrote to Education Sec-
retary Miguel Cardona, asking him for 
a second time—and I like him, but if he 
doesn’t start answering my letters, I 
am going to have to think of a way to 
get his attention. I asked him to cancel 
the student loan debt of all former 
Westwood criminal justice students in 
Illinois who were defrauded by this 
company. 
I first made this request in April of 
last year. It is time for a response, Mr. 
Secretary. 
Last July, the Education Secretary 
canceled the student loan debts of 1,600 
former 
Westwood 
students. 
Among 
them were 488 Illinois students who 
had 
taken 
on 
debt 
to 
enroll 
in 
Westwood’s worthless criminal justice 
program. These students had all ap-
plied for relief under something known 
as borrower defense that allows the 
Education Department to cancel their 
student debts. 
There are still more than 3,000 
Westwood criminal justice students in 
Illinois who haven’t gotten that same 
break. Some of them, like Victoria 
Vences, have carried that debt for more 
than 10 years. It has ruined their credit 
ratings, and it has made it harder for 
them to find a job, rent an apartment, 
or think about a future. 
We have known for more than a dec-
ade that Westwood used misleading 
marketing tactics. Now they have to be 
called to account. The unethical behav-
ior was documented in detail by Illi-
nois’ former attorney general, Lisa 
Madigan, who sued Westwood 10 years 
ago. I remember that. I joined her in a 
press conference announcing it. 
The Education Department also has 
concluded that Westwood defrauded its 
criminal justice program students in 
Illinois. The Education Department 
should grant automatic loan forgive-
ness for all of the approximately 3,000 
students who are still burdened with 
Westwood’s criminal justice program 
deception. 
During the Trump years, the Edu-
cation Department decided to take a 
blind eye to the situation of these for- 
profit schools. The Trump administra-
tion actually hired people who worked 
in that industry—for these schools—to 
regulate them. You can guess what 
happened—no regulation. 
It is time for the Education Depart-
ment to make a difference, and let me 
say that it is time for us to make a dif-
ference when it comes to student loan 
debt. It was in 1998 when we decided— 
in a bill which was loaded with extras 
that people didn’t discover until long 
after it passed—that you couldn’t dis-
card your student loan in bankruptcy. 
If you had a mortgage on a home and 
filed for bankruptcy, you could dis-
charge that mortgage, even on a second 
home, even on a car loan, even on a 
loan for a boat, even on a loan for ap-
pliances—just about everything except 
a student loan. 
Well, that was the wrong decision. 
That was the wrong policy. There are 
more than 3 million student loan bor-
rowers who owe more than $100,000 in 
student loans, but we have decided 
these would be nondischargeable in 
bankruptcy. There is a provision in 
there that says, if there is an undue 
hardship, you might be able to dis-
charge your loan. Almost never does a 
court rule that there is an undue hard-
ship. 
This situation is unsustainable. Sen-
ator JOHN CORNYN of Texas and I have 
introduced a bipartisan bill to change 
it to make sure the Bankruptcy Code 
gives student debt a break. I will con-
tinue working with him and others to 
get this done. Bankruptcy should al-
ways be the last resort, but it ought to 
be an option for those who truly need 
relief, and these student borrowers do. 
The bottom line: Even with other re-
form measures, like relief for the Co-
rinthian Colleges students, bankruptcy 
reform ought to be part of the solution 
to the student debt crisis. I hope that 
it will. 
H.R. 3967 
Madam President, I recently received 
a letter from a man in Chicago who 
was writing on behalf of his dad who 
was a Vietnam war vet, and he was 
writing for hundreds of thousands of 
other veterans just like his dad. 
These people are sick with illnesses 
connected to their military service. 
These veterans served our Nation in 
many different wars, in many different 
places, and at many different times in 
different branches of the military. 
They have one thing in common: They 
were unknowingly poisoned with toxic 
chemicals during their service. They 
came home from war and thought they 
were safe as they managed to escape 
the fate of some of their colleagues, 
but years and sometimes decades later, 
they became sick with rare cancers, 
with debilitating lung diseases, heart 
conditions, and other illnesses as a re-
sult of toxic exposure during their 
service. 
One veteran said: 
It’s like an I.E.D. that goes off in your 
body 8 or 10 or 20 years [after you are out of 
the service]. 
Al LaHood, who is not related to the 
Congressman or the Congressman’s 
son, is the father my constituent wrote 
to me about. Al was 22 years old when 
he was drafted in the Army, and he 
went to Vietnam in 1968. He was an in-
fantryman, 
a 
machinegunner, 
sta-
tioned at Camp Cu Chi, northwest of 
Saigon. He came home after a year, 
with a Bronze Star for valor, but he 
brought something else home, although 
he wouldn’t know it for almost 50 
years. His body had absorbed Agent Or-
ange, the toxic defoliant used by the 
U.S. military in Vietnam to clear the 
jungles. 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH 
assumed 
the 
Chair.) 
After his service, Al LaHood earned a 
college degree and an MBA, got mar-
ried, 
had 
a 
family—the 
American 
dream. 
Every 2 years, he and his Army bud-
dies made a point of having a reunion 
somewhere. One by one, over the years, 
his buddies started getting sick. Heart 
disease, prostate cancer, esophageal 
cancer—it turns out all related to the 
toxic exposure to Agent Orange. 
Four years ago, the toxic timebomb 
caught up with Al LaHood. He was di-
agnosed with a rare form of non-Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma; last year, even worse 
news—diagnosed 
with 
another 
rare 
cancer. Doctors tell him he has a 30- 
percent chance of surviving 5 years. 
The VA ruled that his cancers are 
service-related and declared Al a hun-
dred percent disabled. It amazes him to 
think that he now receives more in dis-
ability compensation each month than 
he received in combat pay for an entire 
year in Vietnam. 
‘‘People don’t understand the true 
cost of war,’’ Al says. 
Exposure to toxic substances is not 
new. In World War I, it was mustard 
gas; World War II, exposure to nuclear 
tests; Vietnam, Agent Orange. In the 
Persian Gulf wars and the wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, there was a new form 
of exposure. It was called burn pits. 
The military dug massive pits, filled 
them with everything imaginable— 
from ruined humvees and aircraft to 
medical waste, human waste, com-
puters, batteries, plastics—every bit of 
trash produced in a war on a military

base. Then they doused it all with jet 
fuel and lit it on fire. The thick black 
smoke from the fire contained invisible 
deadly chemicals. They filled the air 
and covered everything around. And 
the soldiers, they breathed them into 
their lungs and into their bodies. 
Al LaHood’s son said his dad was con-
cerned for the veterans from Iraq and 
Afghanistan. He hopes they receive 
early screening, so if they develop can-
cer, this just might be able to save 
their lives. 
Al and his family say they want more 
research into the kinds of rare cancers 
and other illnesses that toxic-exposed 
veterans developed so they can be de-
tected earlier. Al would give up gladly 
all of his disability payments if the 
money could be spent on research for 
illnesses that might hit his fellow vic-
tims exposed to toxic substances. 
I want Al LaHood and the hundreds 
of thousands of toxic-exposed veterans, 
their families, and caregivers to know 
the U.S. Senate not only honors your 
service; we hear your voices. 
This week, the Senate is taking up 
SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our 
PACT Act. The PACT Act is the most 
important piece of veterans legislation 
in a generation. It is about keeping 
promises, the promises that we made 
to veterans that if they risked their 
lives for our Nation and became wound-
ed as a result, that we would not leave 
them 
behind; 
they 
would 
have 
healthcare and benefits they needed 
and earned. 
The PACT Act builds on the historic 
Agent Orange Act. Let me, at this 
point, note that a friend of mine, now 
deceased, was one of the major movers 
on the Agent Orange Act of 1991. His 
name was Lane Evans. He was from the 
Quad Cities in Illinois. He and I were 
elected to the U.S. House in the same 
year, 1982. 
Lane was a Vietnam-era veteran who 
came back determined to help his fel-
low veterans, and he made Agent Or-
ange his cause. He recognized that ill-
nesses caused by Agent Orange are ac-
tually war wounds and should be treat-
ed that way. 
The PACT Act takes that principle 
that Congressman Lane Evans stood 
for and applies it to other situations. It 
applies it to all American veterans 
from all wars who were exposed to 
toxic chemicals during their service, 
whether overseas or in the United 
States. 
As we continue to learn about the 
cost of exposure, it provides a frame-
work to add more conditions related to 
toxic exposure in the future. Veterans 
will no longer have to fight a second 
war with the VA to prove their illness 
was service-related. They can focus on 
fighting their disease instead of fight-
ing the bureaucracy. 
It is estimated that the PACT Act 
will affect 1 out of every 5 veterans—3.5 
million veterans in all. The act directs 
the VA to devote resources and per-
sonnel needed to process new claims 
and treat new patients. 
In another provision, which I strong-
ly support, the PACT Act directs the 
VA to work collaboratively with the 
Department of Defense and Health and 
Human Services and EPA—a whole-of- 
government search for better ways to 
detect, treat, and cure these hidden 
deadly wounds of war. Our veterans de-
serve nothing else. 
I have heard some critics say: This is 
going to cost a lot of money. 
Right. It just might do that. But can 
you think of a more deserving cause? 
Can you think of anything better than 
for us to really face the true causes of 
war than to stand by our veterans? 
Madam President, you know that 
story far better than I do. 
I have long supported this whole-of- 
government approach to research—es-
pecially at the VA—and treatment for 
our veterans. 
Many VA researchers are veterans 
themselves, determined to find innova-
tive treatment and cures. 
I commend Senator JON TESTER of 
Montana and Senator JERRY MORAN— 
they are the chairman and ranking 
member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee—for their leadership in pro-
ducing this excellent, timely, and his-
toric bipartisan bill. 
I especially thank the more than 60 
veteran service organizations, like the 
VFW—I spoke to their statewide con-
vention in Springfield just last Fri-
day—and so many others that helped 
produce this bill and the veterans who 
fought to reach this point—fought 
sometimes literally with their last 
breath. 
I will vote proudly for the PACT Act. 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll.

Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, to-
morrow will mark 3 weeks since the 
devastating school shooting in Uvalde, 
TX. 
Over those last 3 weeks, Senator 
MURPHY
from Connecticut, Senator 
SINEMA from Arizona, Senator TILLIS 
from North Carolina, and others have 
been working to identify steps that 
Congress should take to prevent simi-
lar tragedies from occurring in the fu-
ture. 
This is not an easy debate. It is emo-
tional. It can be divisive, but it is also 
very important that we act. 
Most often, you hear people say: Do 
something. Well, they don’t give you a 
lot of guidance on what that something 
looks like. And when you begin to dig 
down into the details, you find out that 
there is not a lot of consensus about 
what that something should look like. 
The good news is, as a result of the 
work we have been doing these last 3 
weeks, working with our colleagues, I 
believe we are making good progress. 
Over the weekend, there was an 
agreement reached between 20 Sen-
ators—10 Republicans and 10 Demo-
crats—on a framework, or principles, 
for bipartisan legislation to keep our 
kids and our communities safe. 
Before I go through some of the de-
tails of this agreed framework, I want 
to explain what it does and what it 
does not include. 
From the beginning, I promised my 
constituents that when I took an oath 
to uphold the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, I did not take that 
oath with the intention of violating it. 
And so I said at the outset I would not 
support any additional restrictions on 
the rights of law-abiding gun owners. 
There are hundreds of millions of 
guns in America today, and the vast 
majority—almost all of those gun own-
ers—are responsible. They are not a 
threat to public safety. And so this 
being a constitutional right to keep 
and bear arms, there is no basis to re-
strict the rights of law-abiding gun 
owners or to restrict the constitutional 
rights of many of our citizens. 
I made clear this is a redline of mine 
from the outset. And this bipartisan 
agreement on principles makes good on 
that commitment. 
The gun-related provisions in this 
proposal will only impact criminals 
and those adjudicated mentally ill. 
Law-abiding gun owners will not be 
subject to any new restrictions, period. 
Our agreement also strengthens the 
existing background check system, 
something we have had strong bipar-
tisan support for and where we have 
had some notable successes in the past, 
for example, the Fix NICS bill that 
passed after this tragic Sutherland 
Springs shooting, where an individual, 
who should not have been able to get a 
firearm because of his record of felo-
nies and domestic violence and mental 
health commitments, was able to do so 
because the Air Force had not uploaded 
that information into the background 
check system. 
I am proud of the fact that, on a bi-
partisan basis, we passed that legisla-
tion which compelled Federal Agencies 
to post this derogatory information, 
which disqualifies people under current 
law, into the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System. Since 2018, 
when that bill was signed into law, 
there have been 111⁄2
million new 
records uploaded into the background 
check system. 
As I said, our agreement on the back-
ground check system in this particular 
legislation is an attempt to try to 
make sure that existing law works the 
way Congress intended. I am very 
proud of the bipartisan work that led 
to this framework, and I am eager to 
share more with my Republican col-
leagues this week. 
The various portions of this proposal 
can be grouped into three broad cat-
egories. 
One is mental health support. To pre-
vent violence, we need to improve the

availability and accessibility of mental 
health services across the country. If 
you look at the profile of these young, 
male shooters—whether it is in Sandy 
Hook or it is in Uvalde, TX—they fit a 
familiar profile: alienated from their 
peers, suffering increasingly deterio-
rating mental health, not getting any 
treatment. It is like circling down the 
drain. Unless they get some help, they 
are likely to do what, unfortunately, 
too many of our young people do, and 
that is commit suicide. In the case of 
Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook and Sal-
vador Ramos in Uvalde, they not only 
commit suicide—because they know 
they are not coming out of this alive— 
but they take innocent lives with 
them. So access to mental health sup-
port is absolutely critical. 
So, too, is the investment in our 
schools. This includes everything from 
physically hardening school buildings 
to training personnel, to more effective 
violence prevention efforts. We know 
at Uvalde the door had a lock on it but 
it didn’t work, allowing the shooter 
easy access to this elementary school. 
All of our students—all—deserve to 
feel safe in their schools, and no parent 
should send their child to school wor-
ried that they may not come home. 
They deserve to know their child will 
be safe at school and the peace of mind 
that goes along with that. That is why 
I think these resources for additional 
school hardening of that soft target is 
very important. 
The final portion provides targeted 
reforms to keep guns out of the hands 
of individuals who already, by law, 
should not have guns to begin with. 
Our proposal includes resources for 
States to implement crisis interven-
tion orders. 
Now, some have talked about red flag 
laws, but that is actually a broader 
category than red flag laws that exist 
in 16 States. As I said, some of this as-
sistance for crisis intervention orders 
will help administer existing red flag 
laws, but my hope is that others will 
qualify for these resources for other 
important measures to help provide 
support for our communities to aid in 
crisis intervention, things like assisted 
outpatient treatment centers. As I 
said, 16 States have red flag laws. 
Texas does not, and they certainly 
shouldn’t miss out on access to those 
resources for crisis intervention. 
But one of the things you hear people 
concerned with most when it comes to 
these red flag laws where people who 
are found, after an adjudication, to be 
a danger to themselves and others and 
can lose access to their firearms on a 
temporary basis—it is absolutely crit-
ical that each and every one of those 
includes protection that comes from 
due process of law and particularly 
when it comes to the rights of law- 
abiding gun owners. 
Our framework also includes protec-
tions for victims of domestic violence. 
It shouldn’t matter whether the victim 
is married to their abuser; if the abuser 
is convicted of domestic violence, they 
should not be able to purchase a fire-
arm. 
Our proposal also cracks down on il-
legal sellers and manufacturers of fire-
arms, like the man who sold a gun to 
the shooter who killed 7 people and in-
jured 25 others in Midland and Odessa 
out in West Texas. The shooter knew 
he couldn’t pass a traditional back-
ground test, so he traveled to Lubbock, 
TX, and purchased a firearm from 
somebody who made knockoff AR–15s 
out of parts that he purchased over the 
internet. And, of course, no back-
ground check was done, and tragedy 
ensued. 
Our provisions also include a review 
of juvenile records for buyers under the 
age of 21. In Uvalde, Salvador Ramos 
was able to pass a background check 
only because no one had any insight— 
official insight—into his tortured back-
ground. I have said before he was a 
ticking time bomb: somebody who mu-
tilated himself; threatened assaults, in-
cluding sexual assaults, against his fel-
low students; somebody who posted 
pictures online of the weapons that he 
had bought and threatened online to go 
shoot up a school. 
We need to know before somebody 
walks in and buys a firearm when they 
turn 18 what their mental health and 
criminal record history looks like, to 
the extent feasible. Then we need to 
incentivize 
more 
States, 
like 
the 
States of South Carolina and Virginia 
that currently upload mental health 
adjudications even for juveniles. 
To be clear, we agreed on a press 
statement, a set of principles. That was 
very important and hard-fought. But 
now comes the even more difficult task 
of trying to agree on legislative text to 
actually implement those principles, 
and that is what we are working on 
this week. My hope is that we can com-
plete that job in the next few days— 
hopefully by the end of the week—so 
that the bill will be available for all 
Senators—indeed, all the world—to 
read, and then Senator SCHUMER will 
have that available, should he choose 
to do so, to put it on the floor of the 
Senate next week. 
There has been a lot of talk and spec-
ulation in the press about what was in-
cluded in the bill, and I am pleased to 
say that I believe the principles we 
came up with will save lives. To me, 
that is the ultimate goal, just like the 
legislation we passed in 2018 to fix the 
background check system after Suther-
land Springs. 
I believe the principles we have ar-
ticulated, if carried out in legislative 
text, which I expect them to be, will 
save lives. That is our goal. But we 
also understand that we are operating 
here in the Senate with a 60-vote 
threshold, that 59 votes won’t get it 
and any lesser number will not allow 
us to vote to close off debate and then 
to pass a bill. So I want to just talk 
about ideas that were left out of this 
deal because we knew they would jeop-
ardize our ability to get to 60 votes. 
There was a lot of desire on both 
sides to include additional things, but 
they were excluded in large part be-
cause of our necessity of getting to 60 
votes in order to get a bill—for exam-
ple, proposals on universal background 
checks, assault weapon bans for 18- to 
21-year-olds, mandatory waiting peri-
ods, a 21-day waiting period for pur-
chases of all firearms for 18- to 21-year- 
olds, high-capacity magazine bans, un-
constitutional mandatory safe storage 
requirements of all firearms in homes, 
licensing requirements for purchasing 
an assault weapon, criminal penalties 
for negligent storage of firearms in a 
home, and low mens rea—that is a 
criminal state of mind—standard for 
straw purchasing and trafficking fire-
arms. 
All of these had been proposed by ei-
ther President Biden or many of our 
Democratic colleagues and were not in-
cluded in the statement of principles 
that was agreed to by 10 Republicans 
and 10 Democrats. We knew including 
any of these components would jeop-
ardize our ability to get a deal. So any-
time our Democratic colleagues tried 
to push the envelope as far as they 
could, we had to remind them of that 
requirement and push back. 
Again, my view, my redline, my 
starting point, my premise in all of 
this is law-abiding gun owners are not 
the problem. Law-abiding gun owners 
who have passed a background check 
have a Second Amendment right to 
purchase a firearm, and no limitation 
on their rights is going to prevent 
shootings like Uvalde or Sandy Hook 
or Sutherland Springs. So focusing on 
the problem, which is keeping crimi-
nals and people with mental health 
problems from purchasing firearms 
under existing law, I believe, is the 
right formula to build consensus and 
get a bill on the President’s desk. 
We are still working, as I said, 
through a lot of the details, but I am 
encouraged about where things stand 
right now. As I said, my goal all along 
is the art of the possible. That is what 
politics is; it is the art of the possible. 
It is not everything I want and nothing 
you want or everything you want and 
nothing I want. That is how not to get 
a deal. That is how not to accomplish 
anything. 
I am hoping that 10 Republicans sup-
porting the bill is not a ceiling but is 
the floor, and we intend to continue to 
work with our colleagues to help them 
understand these principles that we 
have agreed to, the 20 of us, and to 
write legislative text that can earn 
broad bipartisan support, maybe super-
majority support, here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
I want to personally thank our col-
leagues 
Senator 
MURPHY, 
Senator 
SINEMA, and Senator TILLIS for work-
ing in good faith to get us to this 
point, as well as a number of other 
Senators who contributed to this bipar-
tisan proposal. 
We still have a lot of work ahead of 
us. I think in many ways this is the be-
ginning—not the middle or the end—of 
our work because now we need to put

these principles into legislative text, 
and then we need to get it on the Sen-
ate floor, get it passed, get it passed in 
the House, and then get it to President 
Biden’s desk. 
I will be sharing further updates with 
my colleagues in the Republican con-
ference this week, and I hope, working 
together with Senator TILLIS and oth-
ers, to build additional support on our 
side of the aisle. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, I just want to 
close on one final note. The bipartisan 
work that we have done here in the 
Senate on this school safety, mental 
health, and gun safety bill is a sharp 
contrast from what is happening on the 
other side of the Capitol. House Demo-
crats, unfortunately, have a history of 
prioritizing politics over policy, but 
now, their games have reached a dan-
gerous low. I am talking about the 
safety and security of the members of 
the U.S. Supreme Court and their fami-
lies. 
It has been more than a month since 
the Senate passed bipartisan legisla-
tion to protect them from threats of vi-
olence. The legislation Mr. COONS, a 
Senator from Delaware, and I intro-
duced—a bipartisan bill—passed the 
Senate unanimously. Do you think 
that happens every day? Not by a long 
shot. To get all 100 Senators to support 
a piece of legislation means it is really 
not controversial. But, unfortunately, 
once it went to the House, it sat there 
and languished for a month. 
Even as members of the Supreme 
Court and their families are being 
threatened, the House hasn’t allowed a 
vote on that bipartisan bill. The reason 
given by our Democratic colleagues in 
the House is, well, they want to extend 
further protection to Court employees 
and their families. That could include 
around-the-clock security details for 
everyone from clerks to IT staff and 
their spouses, children, siblings, and 
parents. That makes a mockery of 
what Senator COONS and I tried to do. 
All we wanted to do is give the police 
at the Supreme Court the very same 
authority that the Capitol Police have 
to provide protective details to Mem-
bers of Congress. In fact, the leadership 
in both Houses have permanent details 
assigned to them, but if a Member of 
Congress receives a credible threat, 
Capitol Police will provide a protective 
detail for them. That is all we want to 
do for the members of the Supreme 
Court and their families. 
Last week, we received a terrifying 
reminder of the failure to act and what 
the consequences of that might be. U.S. 
marshals arrested a man outside of 
Justice Kavanaugh’s home who had 
traveled all the way from California to 
assassinate a sitting Justice on the 
U.S. Supreme Court. When he was ar-
rested, he had a Glock 17 semiauto-
matic pistol. He had ammunition, a 
knife, a crowbar, and some zip ties. He 
told authorities his plan was to break 
into Justice Kavanaugh’s house, kill 
Justice Kavanaugh, and then commit 
suicide. That was his plan. Thank 
goodness law enforcement authorities 
were able to stop him. 
But this close call immediately set 
off calls for the House to pass the bi-
partisan legislation that I was dis-
cussing a moment ago—again, that 
passed unanimously in the Senate a 
month ago—but unfortunately, House 
Democrats have still refused to do 
that. They still claim that the law 
clerks and other Supreme Court staff 
who were virtually anonymous to the 
public are in dire need of protection 
too. I think this is pretty trans-
parently a stalling tactic. It is a pretty 
lame excuse for not providing the Su-
preme Court Justices and their fami-
lies with the very same protection that 
Capitol Police provide Members of Con-
gress. 
The bill that the Democratic House 
Members say they want to pass instead 
was introduced on May 10, almost 5 
weeks ago, but they haven’t even voted 
on that bill yet. Again, this is a trans-
parent attempt to stall legislation that 
passed 100 to 0. If House Democrats ac-
tually believed in the snake oil they 
are trying to sell, they would have 
passed their own bill a month ago, but 
they didn’t, and they haven’t. They 
wasted precious time and left Justices’ 
families vulnerable to grave danger. 
If House Democrats want to vote on a 
bill that extends protection to other 
people, including the leaker of the Su-
preme Court opinion, they are welcome 
to try to do so, but first, they need to 
pass the bipartisan bill Senator COONS 
and I introduced. 
The line between legitimate public 
discourse and acts of violence has been 
crossed, and House Democrats cannot 
continue to turn a blind eye. We don’t 
have time to spare when it comes to 
protecting the members of the Court 
and their families. If, Heaven forbid, 
something were to happen because of a 
lack of authority that would be con-
ferred by the Supreme Court Police 
Parity Act, shame on Members of the 
House of Representatives. It would be 
on them for their failure to act on this 
commonsense, bipartisan bill. 
Madam President, the House needs to 
pass the Supreme Court Police Parity 
Act today and, if not today, tomorrow. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
FREE SPEECH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
there has been a lot of well-deserved 
attention to free expression limits on 
college campuses. My colleagues have 
heard me right here on this very Sen-
ate floor speak about the need for free 
expression many times. But one reason 
we have this issue at colleges is be-
cause students aren’t exposed to the di-
verse ideas in our public schools and 
other 
K–12 
institutions. 
So 
when 
brandnew college students encounter 
opposing ideas for the first time, you 
have heard it—they lash out. They de-
mand what are called safe spaces on 
the college campuses. 
Now, that tells me that students are 
coming to college very unprepared to 
hear diverse views. If your own views 
have never been challenged, then you 
almost certainly have not developed 
the skills to evaluate different view-
points and then go ahead and make up 
your own mind. 
So let’s raise this question: Why are 
students arriving in college so resist-
ant to hearing diverse views? 
I have been following some news sto-
ries on this subject last month, and all 
of this may not be entirely accidental, 
that our high school students aren’t 
prepared to hear diverse viewpoints 
when they get to college. 
The American Federation of Teach-
ers recently announced that it wants 
to put an extension on the computers 
of its 1.7 million members. The goal of 
this NewsGuard extension is to provide 
‘‘trust ratings’’ of news websites. Al-
though numerous studies have pointed 
to 
a 
clear 
leftwing 
bias 
from 
NewsGuard, the AFT still wanted to 
bring it into the classrooms across 
America. Now, that should not be our 
goal. Our goal should be to get political 
bias out of K–12 schools, not ingrain it. 
Contrariwise, a major focus that I 
have heard from Iowa teachers has 
been that we need to develop among 
our students critical thinking. Well, 
critical thinking requires listening to 
different ideas. If all students just 
agree with their teachers, that is rep-
etition, not independent thinking. 
The disease that has infected so 
many colleges now seems to spread 
throughout our K–12 schools. I hope for 
our country’s future we find a way to 
continue to show kids both sides of an 
argument rather than shutting down 
ideas that teachers may disagree with. 
I have heard from many Iowans con-
cerned about exactly that kind of bias. 
But we can’t fix it here in Washington, 
DC. 
The first rule of education policy 
should be that decisions are made as 
close to the family as possible. If you 
have issues with how your school is 
being run, your local school board 
should be your very first step. These 
elected officials are directly account-
able to the parents in their own com-
munities. A problem should only go up 
to the State legislature if it is caused 
by State law, and only a select few 
issues should go to this national level, 
where Federal intervention is found 
out to be the source of the problem. 
So if you see political bias or lack of 
diverse viewpoints in your kids’ school, 
go to the people who can fix it. Make 
your voice heard both at school board 
meetings and at the ballot box. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Madam President, on another sub-
ject, we had the good fortune of hear-
ing a series of speeches last week led 
by my colleague from Iowa, JONI 
ERNST, on the critical situation at our 
southern border, with people violating 
our laws, coming into this country, and 
almost being invited into this country 
in violation of our laws because our

S2907 
June 13, 2022 
laws say you need the permission of 
the United States to come to this coun-
try. 
So I didn’t speak last week on that 
subject, but, as I have done on a num-
ber of occasions otherwise, I want to 
once again come to my colleagues 
about the border crisis created by 
President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, 
and maybe more throughout this ad-
ministration. 
The crisis at our southern border is 
one of the top issues I hear at my coun-
ty meetings. Iowans are understand-
ably upset by President Biden’s poli-
cies that have incentivized illegal im-
migration and created a historic crisis 
at the southern border. 
In the first 15 months of this admin-
istration, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection—CBP, as we call it—has ex-
perienced over 2.7 million encounters 
with illegal immigrants at the south-
ern border. That number is staggering. 
It is larger than the population of 15 
States and Washington, DC. It is al-
most three times larger than the Presi-
dent’s home State of Delaware. 
Make no mistake about it, this crisis 
is entirely the fault of President Biden 
and the policies that he put in place al-
most his first day in office. 
Since taking office, this administra-
tion has terminated physical barrier 
construction at the southern border. In 
other words, the wall that works to 
keep people from entering our country 
was stopped being built. 
Next, this administration attempted 
to severely limit the ability of ICE to 
deport illegal immigrants; also at-
tempted to terminate the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ policy; rolled back asylum co-
operative 
agreements; 
openly 
sup-
ported sanctuary city policies; em-
braced mass catch-and-release policies; 
put forward mass-amnesty legislative 
proposals that would do nothing to se-
cure the border; and even attempted to 
terminate title 42 without any plan in 
place to deal with what happened when 
we increased the number of people ille-
gally crossing our border from about 6- 
to 7,000 a day to 18,000 a day, and that 
figure comes from the estimates of our 
own executive branch government. 
Now, listing all these things, there-
fore, it shouldn’t be a surprise to see a 
record-shattering surge of illegal im-
migration at our southern border. This 
is what happens when you make it 
clear that you have no intention of 
fully enforcing the Nation’s immigra-
tion laws or cracking down on illegal 
immigration. 
As I have said before, it is an unfor-
tunate reality that the President and 
his administration believe the surge in 
illegal immigration at the southern 
border due to his policies is a process 
to be managed rather than a crisis to 
be 
stopped. 
Until 
that 
mindset 
changes, this historic crisis at our 
southern border will continue. And 
President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, 
and the irresponsible and reckless poli-
cies of this administration deserve all 
of the blame for the situation that we 
are in. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

H.R. 3967 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, as 
you know, the Senate is currently con-
sidering the Heath Robinson Honoring 
Our PACT Act. This bipartisan legisla-
tion is the most comprehensive toxic 
exposure bill ever considered for vet-
erans. 
My colleagues deserve a fair consid-
eration of common sense and reason-
able amendments to improve this bill 
for our veterans. The House of Rep-
resentatives had six votes and adopted 
27 amendments. Part of the agreement 
between 
the 
chairman, 
Chairman 
TESTER, and I was that amendments 
would be considered for this legisla-
tion; and, specifically, I have pushed 
for two amendments to be considered. 
Given the magnitude and size of this 
legislation, there needs to be a bipar-
tisan process, and given the magnitude 
of the bipartisan support of this legis-
lation, there needs to be a bipartisan 
process on the Senate floor; and I 
would ask the leadership of the Senate 
to make certain that is the case. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, the 
Senate has a once-in-a-lifetime oppor-
tunity to pass bipartisan legislation 
this week. The Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT 
Act will honor this country’s commit-
ment to our country’s toxin-exposed 
veterans and their families. 
Generation after generation of vet-
erans have been exposed to toxic sub-
stances during their time serving this 
country. And when they return from 
their military service, they have faced 
yet another battle right here at home— 
that battle to get the care and benefits 
that they have earned and that they 
desperately need. 
In the worst cases, folks are praying 
and praying with the price of their 
lives—veterans and heroes like SFC 
Heath Robinson, for whom this bill is 
named. Like many Americans, Heath 
answered the call of duty and deployed 
to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio Na-
tional Guard. 
When he deployed, he was a healthy 
and active soldier. While deployed, he 
was exposed to toxins from burn pits. 
And 13 years—13 short years—after his 
deployment, he lost his life to a rare 
autoimmune disease and stage 4 lung 
cancer, conditions undoubtedly related 
to his exposure to toxins from burn 
pits while he was on active duty serv-
ing this Nation. 
Heath 
left 
behind 
an 
8-year-old 
daughter. He also left behind a wife and 
family. And this family is now com-
mitted to ensuring that this country 
provides for other veterans what it 
could not provide for Heath—the sup-
port he needed to survive. 
This bill will address decades of inac-
tion and failure by our Government. It 
expands eligibility for VA healthcare 
to more than 31⁄2 million combat vet-
erans exposed to burn pits, supporting 
our post-9/11 and Vietnam-era veterans 
by removing the burden of proof for 23 
presumptive conditions caused by toxic 
exposure, from cancers to lung disease. 
It establishes a framework for the es-
tablishment of future presumptions of 
service-related toxic exposures, giving 
the VA the tools it needs to bolster its 
workforce, establish more healthcare 
facilities, and improve the claims proc-
ess to better meet the immediate and 
future needs of every veteran that the 
VA serves. 
There is always a cost to war. And we 
often look at it with ships and air-
planes and tanks, but the fact is, the 
cost of the wars we have fought are 
never fully paid. This bill will help 
right that wrong. 
Congress has a chance to show our 
Nation’s veterans that their govern-
ment has their back. Our men and 
women in uniform answered the call of 
duty. The Presiding Officer of the Sen-
ate knows exactly what I am talking 
about. They upheld their end of the 
bargain; we need to uphold ours. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that we yield back all time and

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

CLOTURE MOTION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the

MORNING BUSINESS 
50TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
JUNETEENTH IN PORTLAND, OR-
EGON 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator 
MERKLEY and I wish to recognize the 
50th anniversary of the Juneteenth Or-
egon Celebration in our hometown of 
Portland, OR. Every year on June 19, 
people in Portland and across the State 
of Oregon and the Nation join together 
to celebrate when, on June 19, 1865, 
more than 250,000 enslaved people in 
Texas were finally declared free more 
than 2 years after the signing of the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom 
and recognition that emancipation was 
delayed for many enslaved people even 
after the Civil War was over. This day 
is among the most important days of 
commemoration in our Nation. 
The 
Juneteenth 
celebration 
was 
brought to Oregon in 1945 by the late 
and beloved community leader Clara 
Peoples. 
She 
led 
the 
first-ever 
Juneteenth celebration in Oregon at 
work. When her supervisor told her 
that if the celebration ran over 15 min-
utes she would be fired, she announced 
to her coworkers, ‘‘Hear ye, hear ye. 
It’s Juneteenth. We have 15 minutes to 
celebrate.’’ Thanks to Clara’s tireless 
efforts in the community and her work 
to create the nonprofit organization 
Juneteenth OR, the first official city-
wide celebration of Juneteenth oc-
curred 50 years ago on June 19, 1972— 
and is today celebrated with a parade 
and other festivities like delicious 
food, art and live music. 
Clara Peoples continued fighting for 
her community by lobbying at all lev-
els of government to make Juneteenth 
a recognized holiday on the State and 
national level. While, sadly, Clara did 
not live to see her efforts realized, she 
clearly paved the way for Juneteenth 
to at long last be declared a Federal 
holiday and a State holiday in Oregon. 
Today, we remember and honor her as, 
in the words of the Rev. Dr. Ronald 
Myers, ‘‘the mother of Juneteenth.’’ 
Soon after Clara Peoples passed away 
in 2015, her granddaughters Jenelle 
Jack and Jynnefer Robinson took over 
as leaders of Juneteenth OR. Jenelle 
and Jynnefer continue to champion 
this special and important event, cre-
ating and coordinating online celebra-
tions for 2 years during the peak of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. They even sent 
Oregon’s candidate for last year’s Miss 
Juneteenth, Aceia Spade from Eugene, 
OR, to Galveston, TX, where she was 
crowned 
National 
Miss 
Juneteenth 
Queen. It was through Jenelle and 
Jynnefer’s efforts—and the efforts of 
the dedicated staff and volunteers of 
Juneteenth OR—that Portlanders and 
Oregonians across the State will once 
again be able to celebrate Juneteenth 
in person this year. We look forward to 
another Clara Peoples Freedom Trail 
Parade this year, as well as another 
Miss Juneteenth competition where 
young Black women will have the op-
portunity to showcase who they are, 
their talents, and their confidence. 
While celebrating a victory in the 
fight to keep the film ‘‘Birth of a Na-
tion,’’ which celebrated the terrorism 
of the Ku Klux Klan, from being played 
in Portland, another Oregon hero and 
notable civil rights advocate Beatrice 
Morrow Cannady said, ‘‘human rights, 
the greatest of all rights, and human 
happiness once again triumphed.’’ So 
we want to say that when enslaved peo-
ple in Texas finally learned that they 
were free, human rights and human 
happiness triumphed. When Juneteenth 
became a citywide celebration in Port-
land 50 years ago, human rights and 
human 
happiness 
triumphed. 
When 
Juneteenth became a national holiday 
in 2021, human rights and human happi-
ness triumphed. And now, on the 50th 
anniversary 
of 
Portland’s 
first 
Juneteenth and the first time that Or-
egon has recognized this important day 
as a State holiday, human rights and 
human happiness have triumphed. 
Juneteenth is an opportunity to cele-
brate the emancipation of Black Amer-
icans and progress made in the fight 
for human rights and human happiness. 
It is also a reminder, however, that the 
fight for true equity for all Americans 
is far from over. Together, we must

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING JOSEPH L. 
MURCHISON, JR. 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Joseph L. ‘‘Joe’’ Murchison, 
Jr., an extraordinary public servant 
who passed away last year and who 
would have turned 92 on June 19, 2022. 
Joe was born in North Carolina in 
1930 and enlisted as early as he could in 
the U.S. Army. Determined to commit 
himself to his Nation, Joe eventually 
joined the all-Black 555th Parachute 
Infantry Battalion. The members of 
this battalion were called the ‘‘Triple 
Nickles.’’ 
In 1947, a year before the Army was 
desegregated, Major General James 
Gavin oversaw the troopers’ transfer 
into the 3rd Battalion, 505th Parachute 
Infantry Regiment. This was the first 
step toward integrating the 82nd Air-
borne Division and made the Triple 
Nickles some of the first Black soldiers 
to train alongside White soldiers. 
Even after this trailblazing shift, the 
troopers continued to consider them-
selves Triple Nickles. Despite the ra-
cial separation of most soldiers, the 
paratroopers gained the respect of 
many units as a result of their special 
airborne status. As Joe said, ‘‘We knew 
we had something to prove and we had 
to be better than the best.’’ 
In 1958, Joe retired from the military 
as an officer. He followed his impres-
sive service by starting several success-
ful businesses across the United States 
and helping to found a newspaper in 
Greensboro called the ‘‘Carolina Peace-
maker.’’ As part of these endeavors, 
Joe was one of the first Black owners 
of a North Carolina automobile dealer-
ship and worked with a major car man-
ufacturer to promote an alternative 
fuel vehicle. 
Joe founded the 555th Parachute In-
fantry Association, Inc., in 1979. The 
organization enables the paratroopers 
to stay connected. Throughout his 
three terms as president of the associa-
tion, Joe saw it grow to include over 
1,500 members across 26 chapters. 
Throughout his remarkable lifetime, 
Joe dedicated himself to sharing the 
importance of the Triple Nickles, even 
visiting the White House. While he was 
alive, 
Joe 
was 
pleased 
to 
see 
Juneteenth—also 
his 
birthday—be 
named a Federal holiday by President 
Biden. He passed away on November 11, 
2021, Veterans Day. 
My wife Cynthia and I extend our 
best wishes to his daughter, Joelle, 
along with her 10 siblings, as well as 
Joe’s 
grandchildren, 
great-grand-
children, 
and 
great-great-grand-
children as they celebrate his out-
standing life this Sunday. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in recognizing

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing,

Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
Western Balkans that was declared in 
Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, 
under which additional steps were 
taken in Executive Order 13304 of May 
28, 2003, and which was expanded in 
scope in Executive Order 14033 of June 
8, 2021, is to continue in effect beyond 
June 26, 2022. 
The acts of extremist violence and 
obstructionist activity, and the situa-
tion in the Western Balkans, which 
stymies progress toward effective and 
democratic governance and full inte-
gration into transatlantic institutions, 
outlined in these Executive Orders, 
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity and foreign policy of the United 
States. Therefore, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13219 with respect to the Western 
Balkans.

The existence and risk of the pro-
liferation of weapons-usable fissile ma-
terial on the Korean Peninsula; the ac-
tions and policies of the Government of 
North Korea that destabilize the Ko-
rean Peninsula and imperil United

pursuit of nuclear and missile pro-

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and Mr. ROM-
NEY): 
S. 4382. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to mint coins in 
commemoration of the 2028 Olympic 
and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles, 
California; to the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4383. A bill to provide assistance 
for surface transportation projects re-
lating 
to 
international 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, 
and 
Special 
Olympics 
events; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Transpor-
tation Assistance for Olympic Cities 
Act 
and 
the 
LA28 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic 
Games 
Commemorative 
Coin Act, which I introduced today. 
While the eyes of the world will be on 
the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 
Los Angeles in 2028, the work preparing 
our region for this grand stage is al-
ready starting. That is why I am proud 
to introduce these bills that will help 
carry out the Games and make invest-
ments in the region and across our Na-
tion. 
The Transportation Assistance for 
Olympic Cities Act would ensure the 
Federal Government provides critical 
assistance for surface transportation 
projects and plans relating to inter-
national Olympic, Paralympic, and 
Special Olympics events. The transpor-
tation plans made in the coming years 
will not only make the Olympics and 
Paralympics run smoothly but will 
also be an investment in infrastructure 
that will benefit commuters and the re-
gion for years to come. 
This bill would also allow the Depart-
ment of Transportation to prioritize 
Federal 
transportation 
grants 
for 
projects 
relating 
to 
an 
Olympic, 
Paralympic, or Special Olympics Inter-
national event and to provide funding 
for temporary facilities, equipment, 
operations, and maintenance that meet 
the 
extraordinary 
needs 
associated 
with hosting such events. 
The LA28 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games 
Commemorative 
Coin 
Act 
would direct the Treasury Department 
to mint coins in commemoration of the 
ninth time that the United States will 
host the modern Olympics and the 
third time that our Nation will host 
the Paralympics. This bill would come 
at no cost to the Federal Government. 
Any surcharges from the sale of the 
coins would support the hosting of the 
2028 Games and aid in the execution of 
legacy programs, including the pro-
motion of youth sports in the United 
States. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
BROWNLEY
and Representative SHER-
MAN for co-leading these bills with me, 
and I hope our colleagues will join us 
in support of these bills that will help 
Los Angeles, California, and our entire 
Nation prepare for the successful ad-
ministration of the 2028 Olympics and 
Paralympics.

government, and to help the people of 
Ukraine. 
Last week, I talked about a grim 
milestone, 100 days of this war. It is be-
coming a war of attrition. The Rus-
sians expected a quick victory, you re-
member. That didn’t happen. Now they 
are grinding it out in one area called 
the Donbas region. And unfortunately, 
they are making some incremental 
progress there. In a minute, I will have 
a map here to show you where the

June 13, 2022 
Donbas region is. But that is where the 
focus is right now. That is where the 
Russians are grinding it out. 
The fate of Ukraine, its future, may 
be decided here in the next few months 
or maybe even weeks, given what is 
happening in the Donbas. The Russians 
have regrouped, and they are using 
their superior weapons, particularly 
long-range artillery. The Ukrainians, 
although they are fighting valiantly, 
just don’t have that longer range artil-
lery to be able to counteract what Rus-
sia is doing. So the Russians are sitting 
back with this long-range, more accu-
rate artillery. They are hitting Ukrain-
ian positions, taking out Ukrainian 
cities, flattening them. And then the 
Ukrainians can’t reach them because 
they don’t have artillery that is long 
range. 
There 
has 
been 
some 
Ukrainian 
progress in the past week. If you look 
at this map, you can see that in the 
northeast, around Kharkiv—up here, 
you see this light blue—Ukrainians 
have made some progress. In fact, in 
one case, they actually pushed the Rus-
sians back to the Russian border. 
They also made some progress here 
in the south. And you see the city of 
Kherson, that was one of the first big 
cities that the Russians took during 
this most recent attack. The Ukrain-
ians are now moving toward that area. 
That is positive news. 
But, frankly, one reason they are 
making the progress is the Russians 
are all focused right here. This is the 
Donbas region we talked about earlier, 
and this is where the Russians are 
making incremental progress and kill-
ing, frankly, a lot of Ukrainian civil-
ians but also Ukrainian soldiers. 
Russia is grinding it out, as I said 
earlier, meaning that they are using 
their superior artillery fire. They have 
more troops. They have more weapons. 
But the Ukrainian defenders are fight-
ing hard. They are making the Rus-
sians pay for every single inch of terri-
tory that is being taken. This is par-
ticularly true in Severodonetsk, which 
is right in here. 
In Severodonetsk, there is an ongo-
ing battle tonight as we talk. The Rus-
sians are engaged in urban combat 
there, and the Ukrainians have fiercely 
defended their homeland. But I will 
say, the Russians are still advancing 
bit by bit, in some cases kilometer by 
kilometer, every day, because they 
have the firepower, especially the 
longer-range, accurate, and deadly ar-
tillery. 
Reports yesterday indicate that un-
less Ukrainians can get access to that 
long-range 
artillery 
themselves, 
Severodonetsk and the entire Luhansk 
region could fall to Russia soon. Pos-
sibly within weeks. This should alarm 
all of us. It should alarm the adminis-
tration; it should alarm the Congress. 
Because every time Russia gains more 
territory, they reduce it to mostly rub-
ble, destroy it, and then they dig in, 
making it twice as hard to get that ter-
ritory back. 
Because the Russians have more ar-
tillery than the Ukrainians and their 
weapons have longer ranges, the Rus-
sian forces concentrate their massive 
firepower on Ukrainian positions from 
a distance, as I said, which the Ukrain-
ian forces cannot reach. And then they 
move in. 
They destroy the territory. They oc-
cupy it. This disparity in the quality 
and quantity of artillery has put 
Ukraine at a distinct disadvantage. 
The good news is that we can fix this 
problem. We can level this playing field 
and address this disparity. America 
and her allies have the ability to do it, 
and it is urgent that we do it now. 
In our inventory, we have hundreds 
of what are called High Mobility Artil-
lery Rocket Systems or HIMARS. It is 
an advanced system that is actually 
superior to the Russian artillery in al-
most every way, more mobility, faster 
reload time, more accuracy, and—more 
importantly—more range. 
Getting 
these 
systems, 
these 
HIMARS systems to Ukraine could be a 
game changer. It could save so many 
lives. With these systems in the arse-
nal, the Ukrainians could turn the ta-
bles on the Russians here in the Donbas 
region. 
They could grind the Russian ad-
vance to a halt and maybe even push 
the Russian forces back, as they are 
doing in Kharkiv up here or down here 
in the south. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has been unwilling to act quickly 
on these HIMARS. Two weeks ago, 
after weeks of Ukrainian requests, 
echoed by some of us here in the U.S. 
Congress, President Biden announced 
that he would provide Ukraine with 
some of these systems. I was really 
pleased we were finally taking that 
step. 
However, according to the Depart-
ment of Defense, I now learned that the 
administration is only sending four of 
these systems—four. The administra-
tion has said that it is only providing 
Ukraine with mid-range missiles as 
well, meaning Ukrainian troops will 
need to fire from closer to Russian po-
sitions and put themselves at greater 
risk. 
That announcement of our decision 
to send four systems will be 2 weeks 
old on Wednesday. We were told these 
systems require almost 3 weeks in 
training to be able to operate. That 
means, at best, Ukraine will have four 
U.S. 
artillery 
systems 
operational 
sometime late this week or maybe next 
week. 
Ukraine has been fighting for its life 
for weeks along a massive front line, 
this front line all along here. And the 
Biden administration is only now send-
ing this military support; and, frankly, 
it is just not enough. Combine this 
with the public reporting that the M777 
howitzer promised to Ukraine months 
ago back in mid-April are arriving very 
slowly, and you have a picture that 
shows that we are not responding with 
urgency to the situation in Ukraine. 
You don’t have to take it from me. 
Listen to the military advisor and 
President Zelenskyy’s chief of staff 
Oleksiy Arestovych: ‘‘If we get 60 of 
these [rocket artillery] systems,’’ that 
is the HIMARS I am talking about, 
‘‘then the Russians will lose all ability 
to advance anywhere, they will be 
stopped [dead] in their tracks. If we get 
40, they will advance, albeit very slow-
ly with heavy casualties; with 20, they 
will continue to advance with higher 
casualties than now.’’ 
So he is talking about the need for 60 
or at least 40; 20 won’t be enough. Un-
fortunately, we are talking about four. 
To their credit, the British announced 
last Tuesday that they will send some-
thing similar to these multiple launch 
rocket systems to Ukraine. It is a larg-
er version, actually, of the HIMARS 
rocket artillery system that they are 
sending. I appreciate that. However, 
the BBC reports that they are now only 
sending three, at least initially. 
The world looks to America for lead-
ership, and if America leads with only 
four rocket artillery systems, the rest 
of the world is going to follow with 
similarly modest support. I hope this 
will change. I hope we will see that 
these numbers improve. I would like to 
be proven wrong that those artillery 
systems are already on their way. I 
hope they are, but the best information 
we have is that is not true. 
It has been months now, and the 
Ukrainians cannot afford to have im-
precise and low-level assistance from 
the world’s most powerful military. 
This Congress sent $40 billion in aid to 
the Ukrainians, $21 billion of that was 
military assistance. I think we should 
expect and demand that the adminis-
tration utilize that funding as much as 
possible and provide Ukraine with the 
precise and powerful military equip-
ment it actually needs to be able to 
fight this war, to stop the bloodshed, 
by pushing the Russians back, $21 bil-
lion is a lot of money, let’s be sure it 
is spent properly. 
Another Ukrainian official, Vadym 
Skibitsky, Ukraine’s Deputy head of 
Military Intelligence, told a British 
outlet: ‘‘Everything now depends on 
what [the West] gives us. Ukraine has 
one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian 
artillery pieces.’’ 
Ukrainians need our help. And Con-
gress has done its job in an over-
whelming, 
bipartisan 
fashion. 
We 
should not be tentative now—not now. 
Russia’s brutal unrelenting rocket and 
missile attacks throughout Ukraine, 
including 
attacks 
on 
schools 
and 
churches, 
hospitals 
and 
apartment 
buildings, have killed tens of thousands 
of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, 
while entire cities have been laid to 
rubble by the Russian barrages. While 
the media coverage has waned signifi-
cantly here in the United States, the 
people of Ukraine are still feeling the 
effect and the terrible impacts of this 
bloody and illegal invasion of their 
homeland in so many ways. One is the 
blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2917 
June 13, 2022 
Since the war began, Russia has put 
this blockade in place preventing the 
export of millions of tons of grain and 
other agricultural products desperately 
needed, by the way, in Africa, in the 
Middle East, and other developing 
countries. 
Just this past Saturday, Deputy Ag-
riculture Minister Taras Vysotsky re-
ported that 300,000 tons of grain were 
destroyed when Russia shelled a ware-
house near one of these ports. 
So Russia is actually shelling grain 
bins to destroy the grain. Let me be 
clear: Food should never be a target 
and should never be used as leverage in 
negotiations. Malign actors around the 
world have used food as a weapon—the 
Houthis in Yemen, Assad in Syria, and 
now Russia in Ukraine. 
Russia has the rest of the world hos-
tage with its barbaric food blockade. 
President Putin recently suggested 
that he would lift his stranglehold on 
Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, including 
Odesa, but he said he would only do so 
if all the sanctions were lifted on Rus-
sia. In other words, Russia would like 
to be rewarded for releasing the hos-
tage it has taken. 
Russia must release its blockade im-
mediately, without any conditions. 
Millions of lives depend on it. I would 
expect the administration and allies— 
including Turkey—to come up with 
contingency plans now, if they don’t 
have them already. This impacts na-
tions in Africa, the Middle East, East 
Asia, and particularly, again, these 
poor countries in Africa depend on the 
Ukrainian grains, otherwise there will 
be massive food shortages. 
In Turkey, President Erdogan con-
tinues to negotiate an exit corridor for 
Ukrainian grain through the Black 
Sea. I thank him for doing that. He 
should continue to do so. And even in 
China—no friend of the United States 
and a very good friend of Russia right 
now—President Xi Jinping has warned 
of a bad winter wheat harvest. I hope 
he can persuade Vladimir Putin that 
needlessly causing a global hunger ca-
tastrophe will not do him any favors. 
The dire warnings of global food inse-
curity and price hikes if this blockade 
continues should concern everyone in 
this Congress, everyone in America, 
and everyone in this administration, 
certainly. 
The world is looking to our leader-
ship to help solve this problem. What 
we need is a creation of a humanitarian 
corridor that can go out, at least 
through the port at Odesa through 
which Ukrainian agricultural products 
can reach the world market. 
Until then, other avenues have to be 
explored. When I was in Romania 2 
weeks ago, the prime minister there 
told me that they intend to boost their 
road and rail and canal infrastructure 
to the port in Romania to help export 
as much Ukrainian grain as possible. 
This would help, and I appreciate— 
really appreciate—the Romanian ef-
fort, but it can’t match the capacity of 
Odesa or these other ports in Ukraine. 
At a security conference in Singapore 
on Sunday, Ukraine’s deputy foreign 
minister announced that Ukraine will, 
indeed, try to export its grains through 
Romania as well as through Poland, as 
well as any place they can get it out. 
They are looking for a third route as 
an example through the Baltic States, 
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. That is 
a desperate attempt by Ukraine to try 
to get this grain out, but, again, it can 
never match the huge volumes that can 
go by ship from its own ports. 
As the head of the Ukraine Grain As-
sociation said last week: 
I can tell you we won’t find a solution [for] 
exports [without Black Sea port access]. 
Unfortunately, I think he is right. It 
is clear that Russia is trying to starve 
the world into pressuring Ukraine to 
surrender. Meanwhile, Russia’s crimes 
within Ukraine continue. A few days 
ago, Ukrainian prosecutors announced 
that eight more war crimes have been 
filed against Russian soldiers. These 
cases are part of a more than 16,000 in-
vestigation that Ukraine has opened 
into possible war crimes committed 
during the war, according to Ukraine’s 
prosecutor 
general—16,000 
investiga-
tions right now into war crimes. 
In the past war crimes trials, two 
captured Russian soldiers were each 
sentenced to 111⁄2 years in prison in late 
May after pleading guilty to shelling a 
town in Eastern Ukraine. And a Rus-
sian soldier was handed a life sentence 
for shooting a 62-year-old Ukrainian ci-
vilian in the head. 
These heinous acts of violence are 
going to continue unless Ukraine has 
the ability to push back. We do need 
more of these sentences of war crimi-
nals to try to act as a deterrent to stop 
the 
further 
Russian 
barbarity 
in 
Ukraine. Maybe some officers, maybe 
some officials in the Kremlin looking 
at these war crime convictions will 
say, 
you 
know 
what, 
maybe 
we 
shouldn’t be attacking our peaceful 
neighbors and killing them and raping 
them and terrorizing this country. 
There is another important issue I 
want to mention, one that is worth the 
world’s attention: Ukrainian orphans. 
Unfortunately, there are hundreds of 
Ukrainian orphans who are stuck in 
Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe. A lot 
of these orphans have ties to America 
and unique ties to about 200 American 
families who are ready, willing, and 
able to host these children. These fami-
lies have been in the process of adopt-
ing these children for a long time, from 
before the invasion. Many of these chil-
dren have actually previously visited 
the United States to meet with their 
soon-to-be adopted families. 
Unfortunately, many of these chil-
dren returned right before the invasion 
and are unaccounted for now. Many 
have lost contact with their soon-to-be 
families. I have constituents in Ohio, 
and I know hundreds of other families 
across the country ready to welcome 
these children into their homes. 
In March, along with 26 colleagues, I 
wrote to the State Department, I have 
yet to hear back from that letter, but 
we asked for two things: one, to help 
identify these children, this needs to be 
done in collaboration with the Ukrain-
ian government, of course, and U.S.- 
based organizations; and, two, my let-
ter urged the administration to issue 
travel visas to allow adoption-eligible 
kids to come live with their American 
host families now. 
The State Department should use its 
powers under the law to immediately 
process nonimmigrant visas that will 
allow these kids with in-process adop-
tions to travel to the U.S. and stay 
with their host families in the United 
States instead of requiring these chil-
dren to remain in other locations for 
displaced persons in Europe or in 
Ukraine. 
Many of these children may be given 
refuge in neighboring countries. How-
ever, I believe in the unique cir-
cumstances where children already 
have established relationships with 
these families in the United States, 
they should be able to come here and 
be with their host families who can en-
sure the child’s safety and stability. 
At the same time, we could continue 
to work with the Ukrainian govern-
ment, which has been open to finalizing 
the adoptions that were in process be-
fore the war began. 
I will close with this: I have now 
come to the floor every week since just 
before President Putin began this ille-
gal and unprovoked invasion against 
the people of a democratic Ukraine 
who just wanted to live in peace with 
their neighbors—including Russia. 
This is the fight during our genera-
tion where democracy is on the line. I 
am not surprised, because I have seen 
the spirit and bravery of the Ukrainian 
people firsthand in my many trips to 
Ukraine, 
including 
meeting 
with 
Ukrainian troops on the front line be-
fore this latest invasion. I am not sur-
prised that they have held off Russia so 
far. Their strength and resiliency is a 
marvel. 
Again, it is not what Vladimir Putin 
expected. It is, frankly, not what our 
own U.S. military expected. They have 
fought hard, and they continue to 
every day. But they need more help. 
Last week, I met with a great fighter 
in this cause, my friend Andy Futey 
from Ohio, who leads the Ukrainian 
World Congress for the Ukraine dias-
pora all over the world. He has been a 
strong and consistent advocate for 
Ukraine and joined me at a rally, actu-
ally, at the White House with hundreds 
of 
Ukrainian 
Americans 
a 
couple 
months ago. 
When I met with Andy last week and 
other members of the Ukrainian World 
Congress who had just returned from 
Ukraine, 
they 
spoke 
with 
passion 
about the destruction they had seen in 
Ukraine, about the steep price that the 
Ukrainian people have paid and con-
tinue to pay to be able to remain free 
and independent. 
With them was a young woman from 
Ukraine who was very emotional in her

appeals, with tears, saying, America 
needs to do more during this hour of 
need. As they made the case passion-
ately that the U.S. needs to continue 
sending weapons and artillery and 
sooner not later, they talked about the 
need for these long-range weapons we 
talked about tonight, so the Ukrain-
ians have a fighting chance. 
Every day the United States fails to 
sufficiently 
support 
Ukraine 
only 
serves as a detriment to the Ukrain-
ians, who need us to lead the free world 
in helping them win this war. Brave 
Ukrainians are dying every day. We 
just can’t afford to delay. 
My colleague Senator DICK DURBIN 
and I cochair what is called the Senate 
Ukraine Caucus, which we founded 
back in 2015. Later this week, we will 
bring the caucus together to meet with 
the leaders in the Ukrainian par-
liament, the Rada, who are here vis-
iting Washington to urge greater sup-
port in America for their country. We 
are eager to hear what they have to 
say. 
Many of us here in this Chamber get 
it. We know that America can’t afford 
to stay on the sidelines and be a spec-
tator in this conflict. At this crucial 
time in the battle for freedom, democ-
racy, and the ability for countries to 
have their territorial integrity re-
spected, at this critical hour, America 
cannot afford to be tentative. 
We must remember the lessons of the 
late 1930s: that appeasing tyrants will 
not satiate their desire to violently 
conquer and subjugate their neighbors. 
Some folks in this town may not un-
derstand that, but Ukrainians under-
stand it. They know what it is like to 
live under the thumb of authoritarians, 
and they broke away from that and to-
ward democracy, first in 1991 and again 
in 2014. 
I was in Ukraine after the Revolution 
of Dignity, in 2014, where Ukrainians 
decided for themselves that they want-
ed to turn away from Russian domina-
tion and turn to us and to Europe and 
to pursue a hopeful future of democ-
racy and freedom. Now, President 
Putin is trying to extinguish that 
hope. We must not let him. 
One question that many of us have of 
the administration is: What is the end 
goal here? Is our objective to help 
Ukraine grind down Russia’s military 
so that for some number of years it is 
unable to undertake another violent 
campaign like this? Is our objective to 
topple President Putin’s regime? Or is 
our objective to help the Ukrainians 
expel the Russian invaders from their 
sovereign Ukrainian territory, includ-
ing Crimea and the Donbas? 
The 
administration 
dodges 
these 
questions by saying: It is up to the 
Ukrainians to decide. 
I understand that, but the Ukrain-
ians have already decided. They want 
their sovereign territory back—all of 
it. I have discussed this at length with 
Ukrainians, and they have consistently 
said what I have heard from their par-
liamentary leaders in the past and will 
again this week: Nothing less than the 
full restoration of Ukrainian sovereign 
territory is their goal. 
Saying that we support Russia walk-
ing away with any Ukrainian territory 
would just embolden Russia in this 
conflict and embolden aggressors and 
authoritarians in the future. 
It has now been 110 days of unrelent-
ing 
Russian 
attacks 
on 
our 
ally 
Ukraine, and it has been 110 days of 
pushing the administration to help 
more. This happened with Russian oil, 
Russian gas exports. It happened with 
trade and banking sanctions and var-
ious kinds of military assistance. Now 
it is the HIMARS. They need these 
weapons. 
America has made its stand. We are 
on the side of freedom over tyranny, 
democracy and self-determination over 
authoritarianism and conquest. The 
countries of the free world are with us, 
but more so when we lead. Now is not 
the time to be tentative or equivocal. 
At this critical juncture, let’s work 
with allies to provide our democratic 
brothers and sisters in Ukraine what 
they need to protect the homeland and 
defend democracy.

RECOGNIZING THE REPUBLIC DAY 
OF AZERBAIJAN 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, as Co- 
chair of the House Azerbaijan Caucus, I am 
honored to recognize the Republic Day re-
cently celebrated in Azerbaijan. 
On May 28, 1918, the National Assembly of 
Azerbaijan adopted their Declaration of Inde-
pendence, becoming the first secular democ-
racy in the region. After being invaded by the 
Soviet Union and incorporated into the USSR, 
Azerbaijan again restored its independence on 
August 30, 1991. 
Azerbaijan is a significant partner to the 
United States and plays a key role in energy 
security, supporting Israel, and ensuring sta-
bility in the region. 
Azerbaijan has been a leader in the South-
ern Gas Corridor, which will ultimately de-
crease the Caspian region’s dependence on 
Russian oil, a critical effort especially at this 
time of Russian aggression. 
A strong ally to the U.S. and other inter-
national partners, Azerbaijan has stood strong 
with the U.S. and NATO forces by providing 
critical refueling stations and fighting side-by- 
side with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Azer-
baijan contributed to the security of Kosovo 
and Iraq, and promotes peacekeeping oper-
ations under the United Nations and NATO. 
Committed to global nonproliferation efforts 
and peacekeeping operations, Azerbaijan also 
participates as a member of the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
Given Azerbaijan’s position as a partner of 
the United States in a critical area of the 
world, I urge my colleagues to join me in ex-
pressing support for Azerbaijan’s independ-
ence and commending the people of Azer-
baijan on their Republic Day.

IN MEMORY OF DR. ANTHONY 
OWENS PARKER 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to an awesome vi-
sionary, college administrator, educational ex-
pert, consensus building community leader 
and friend of long standing—Dr. Anthony 
Owens Parker. Sadly, Dr. Parker transitioned 
on June 6, 2022. His homegoing service was 
held at the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist 
Church in Albany, Georgia on June 10, 2022, 
at 11:00 a.m. The amazing story of Dr. An-
thony Parker began with his birth on January 
12, 1953, in Orangeburg, S.C. to the union of 
the late Mr. Lee and Mrs. Henretta Parker. He 
was reared in St. Matthews, South Carolina 
where he spent his formative years. He at-
tended John Ford High School, but ultimately 
graduated from St. Matthews High School in 
1971. 
His higher education journey took him to his 
beloved South Carolina State University where 
he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
Accounting and Master’s Degree in Rehabilita-
tion Counseling. Always seeking to improve 
himself through education, he went on to earn 
a Specialist in Education Degree from Augusta 
State University and his PH.D from the Univer-
sity of South Carolina. In addition, he is also 
a graduate of the Institute of Educational Man-
agement at the Harvard University Graduate 
School. His professional journey of excellence 
began as a marketing instructor at Augusta 
Technical College before becoming the Vice 
President of Student Services at both South-
eastern Technical College and Aiken Tech-
nical College. These positions were the foun-
dation for his next post which would change 
the course of technical education in Southwest 
Georgia when he was named as the fifth 
president of Albany Technical College in 1995. 
At the time of his passing, he was the long-
est serving President in the Technical College 
System of Georgia with 27 years. During his 
presidency, he raised the bar of excellence for 
himself, Albany Technical College, and South-
west Georgia. Dr. Parker’s vision was keenly 
focused on establishing the college as a work-
force development institution that placed grad-
uates in sustainable employment opportunities 
that would improve the quality of their lives 
and by extension the Southwest Georgia Re-
gion. He was truly community focused and 
knew the college could not reach its full poten-
tial unless it had the support of the commu-
nity. He developed partnerships with commu-
nity organizations, industry and other institu-
tions of higher learning in the State which en-
hance the impact of Albany Technical College 
in fulfilling its mission. Because of his vision-
ary leadership, Albany Technical College is 
ranked among the top technical colleges in 
Georgia and in the Nation. 
Anthony Parker was a man of faith. 
Throughout his life he demonstrated Christian 
principles and during his later years worshiped 
faithfully at Bethel AME Church in Albany, 
Georgia. Moreover, he achieved many suc-
cesses during his life and career, but none of 
this would have been possible without the 
grace of God; his high school sweetheart and 
loving wife of 49 years, Sandra Pinkney 
Parker; his children, Dr. Kimberly A. Parker, 
Commander Andrea Parker Smith and Richard 
Anthony Parker; along with his granddaughter, 
Parker Elizabeth Smith. 
On a personal note, Dr. Parker was my 
friend and my brother in the bond of Kappa 
Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. I was always im-
pressed by his calm demeanor and his knack 
for dealing with people in a respectful way 
even under the most difficult circumstances. 
He was humble and always treated people the 
way they deserved to be treated. Dr. George 
Washington Carver was often quoted as say-
ing: ‘‘How far you go in life depends on your 
being tender with the young; compassionate 
with the aged; sympathetic with the striving; 
and tolerant of the weak and the strong be-
cause someday in your life you will have been 
all of these.’’ Dr. Anthony O. Parker was such 
a man. He rose from humble beginnings and 
achieved the pinnacle of success because he 
accepted and fulfilled God’s purpose for his 
life. Albany Technical College, Southwest 
Georgia, our Nation, and the world are better 
because Dr. Anthony Owens Parker passed 
this way. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Con-
gressional District, in paying tribute to Dr. An-
thony O. Parker and in extending our deepest 
sympathies to his family, friends, and loved 
ones during this difficult period of bereave-
ment. Moreover, we pray that they will be con-
soled and comforted by an abiding faith and 
the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months 
ahead.

RECOGNIZING DR. GRISWOLD 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor a man who has dedicated his life 
to public service and thank him for his service. 
After 22 years on the Miller County Health 
Center Board of Trustees, Dr. Scott Griswold 
is retiring. For more than two decades Dr. 
Griswold has been instrumental in the oper-
ations of the board. Dr. Griswold had multiple 
roles on the board of Trustees. He provided 
medical oversight and standing orders for the 
agency, while giving continuous quality im-
provements for the agency and community. 
Most notably, in 2000, Dr. Griswold worked 
with the citizens of Miller County to establish 
sustainable funding for the Board, and he de-
veloped 
the 
agency’s 
annual 
Health 
& 
Wellness Grant, where non-profits can apply 
for funding to improve nutrition, increase phys-
ical activity, and other initiatives to improve 
health and wellness in the county. 
My fellow Miller County residents and I have 
been truly blessed to have such a gifted and 
dedicated physician on the County’s Health- 
Center Board. We are endlessly grateful for 
Dr. Griswold’s service. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Dr. Griswold for his 22 years of service 
and congratulating him on a well-deserved re-
tirement.

HONORING 
ERIN 
PIERONE 
FOR 
HER CAREER OF SERVING THE 
STATE OF NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and thank Erin Pierone on her 
retirement for faithfully serving the state of 
New York for over thirty years. 
In 1989, Erin graduated from the State Uni-
versity of New York in Plattsburg with a bach-
elor’s degree in criminal justice. After she 
graduated, Erin dedicated her life to serving 
some of the youngest members of her com-
munity. For sixteen years, she worked as a 
Child Protective Services caseworker in both 
the Saratoga and Warren County Departments 
of Social Services. During this time, she 
worked tirelessly as an advocate for the chil-
dren of Saratoga and Warren Counties. She 
conducted numerous investigations into abuse 
and maltreatment to ensure a better future for 
every child with which she worked. Following 
her career as a caseworker, Erin continued to 
dedicate herself to improving the lives of those 
in her community by working as a Crime Vic-
tim Specialist in the Saratoga County District 
Attorney’s office and for the New York State 
Police. During this time, Erin worked relent-
lessly to provide victims emotional support, 
rights information, help in finding necessary 
resources and assistance in filling out crime- 
related forms. Erin also often accompanied 
victims and their family members throughout 
the criminal justice proceedings. 
In addition to her professional accomplish-
ments, Erin was a board member with the 
Saratoga Center for the Family. For five years, 
she also served as vice president and presi-
dent of the New York Crime Victims Assist-
ance Task Force. Erin received many well-de-
served accolades throughout her career; in-
cluding the Betty Martin award for Victim Ad-
vocacy through the Albany County District At-
torney’s office, awards for Victim Advocacy 
from the Warren County and Saratoga County 
District Attorney offices, the New York State 
Police Troop G Special Recognition award, 
and the New York State Police Superintend-
ent’s award. 
As a Child Protective Services worker and 
Crime Victim Specialist, Erin has been an in-
valuable resource to law enforcement and her 
community. Her dedication and passion will be 
forever remembered by the countless people 
that she has helped throughout her 32-year 
career. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, 
I thank Erin for her incredible service to our 
community and wish her a happy and blessed 
retirement.

HONORING RETIRED MAJOR GEN-
ERAL GARY HARRELL FOR 35 
YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Major General Gary Harrell for 35 
years of extraordinary military service and his 
recent induction as a Distinguished Member of 
the Special Forces Regiment by the U.S. 
Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Cen-
ter and School. 
Maj. Gen. Harrell has made immeasurable 
contributions to our great Nation and con-
tinues to personify the core U.S. Army values 
of honor, integrity, personal courage, and self-
less service. He began his career in 1973 with 
the 82nd Airborne Division and retired in 2008 
as the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army 
Special Operations Command. 
Over the course of his remarkable career, 
Maj. Gen. Harrell served as a special oper-
ations action officer, deputy commander, com-
mander, and director among other positions in 
military operations around the globe. In some 
of his most notable assignments, he helped 
rescue American hostage Kurt Muse in Pan-
ama as part of Operation Just Cause, de-
ployed with Joint Special Operations Com-
mand in Operations Desert Shield and Desert 
Storm, served as Commander of Task Force 
Bowie and Assistant Division Commander for 
the 10th Mountain Division in Operation Ana-
conda in Afghanistan, and served as Com-
mander of Special Operations Command 
where he oversaw more than 20,000 troops in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. He continues to 
serve our military in retirement as an execu-
tive board member for the Task Force Dagger 
Foundation. Through this role, he has helped 
secure donations to benefit injured or ill spe-
cial operations service members and their 
families. 
On account of his exemplary service, Maj. 
Gen. Harrell received many of our Nation’s 
most impressive distinctions and awards, in-
cluding the Defense Superior Service Medal, 
the Bronze Star Medal with a Valor Device 
and Two Oak Leaf Clusters, a Purple Heart 
Medal, 
the 
Defense 
Meritorious 
Service 
Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with an 
Oak Leaf Cluster, the Air Medal and the Army 
Commendation Medal with Two Oak Leaf 
Clusters among other awards and distinctions. 
He represents the best our nation has to offer, 
and we will look up to his leadership for gen-
erations to come. 
As Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I know I 
speak for our Nation and community when I 
say we are truly grateful for Maj. Gen. Har-
rell’s exceptional service. There is no one 
more deserving of being named a Distin-
guished Member of the Special Forces Regi-
ment. I would like to offer my sincerest appre-
ciation and wish him and his family success in 
all their future endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Major General Gary Harrell for 35 
years of distinguished military service and 
leadership.

INTRODUCTION OF BRIDGE CORRO-
SION PREVENTION AND REPAIR 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Bridge Corrosion Prevention 
and Repair Act,’’ with Congressman ANTHONY 
G. BROWN (D–MD). Our legislation is en-
dorsed by the International Union of Painters 
and Allied Trades (IUPAT) and the Association 
for Materials Protection and Performance (for-
merly called the National Association of Corro-
sion Engineers and the Society for Protective 
Coatings). 
This legislation would require all federally 
funded bridge projects to use certified contrac-
tors for any corrosion control work and employ 
industry-recognized standards for corrosion 
mitigation and prevention. Specifically, my leg-
islation would prompt State, county, and mu-
nicipal transportation departments to employ 
qualified, trained corrosion control profes-
sionals who have completed federally reg-
istered apprenticeship programs. 
In July 2021, the House passed my ‘‘Bridge 
Corrosion Prevention and Repair Act’’ as Sec-
tion 1116 from Chairman PETER A. DEFAZIO’s 
(D–OR) ‘‘Investing in a New Vision for the En-
vironment and Surface Transportation (IN-
VEST) in America Act,’’ of which I was a co-
sponsor. While it was ultimately not included 
in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
(Public Law 117–58), I plan to build upon 
Chairman DEFAZIO’s’ work on corrosion pre-
vention policy and promoting apprenticeships. 
In the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–81 ), I 
secured Section 813 (Office of Corrosion Pol-
icy and Oversight employee training require-
ments) directing the U.S. Department of De-
fense to make use of federally registered ap-
prenticeship programs for training military per-
sonnel, civilian employees, and military con-
struction contractors on anti-corrosion activi-
ties. Under my amendment to the FY2022 
NOAA, the DOD’s Office of Corrosion Policy 
and Oversight Employee Training Require-
ments is charged with coordinating this work. 
Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 
Congress and the Biden Administration are 
making the largest federal investment to mod-
ernize our nation’s infrastructure since the 
Interstate Highway System was established in

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
LOCAL 
TASK FORCES ON 21ST CENTURY 
POLICING ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Local Task Forces on 21st Cen-
tury Policing Act, which would assist localities 
in carrying out the recommendations of the 
federal Task Force on 21st Century Policing 
and the Department of Justice’s Office of 
Community Oriented Policing Services, both of 
which have detailed the need to strengthen re-
lations between local communities and local 
law enforcement. The bill would provide grants 
to local governments to create local task 
forces on 21st century policing to bring police, 
representatives of the community and public 
officials together to identify best policing prac-
tices for local police and other ways to 
strengthen relations between the community 
and police departments. No new funds are 
needed. Existing funds from the Department of 
Justice would support local governments es-
tablishing the task forces by listing these task 
forces as an acceptable use of Byrne Justice 
Assistance Grants. Given the continuing con-
troversy surrounding police shootings of un-
armed African American men, with no solu-
tions in sight, this bill is timelier every day. 
The task forces, modeled after the federal 
Task Force on 21st Century Policing, would 
allow local communities to identify the best 
ways to create an effective partnership be-
tween local law enforcement and the commu-
nities they serve, while reducing crime, in-
creasing trust and combating racial profiling. 
The task forces could create a partnership to 
implement practical policing practices accept-
able to all concerned. 
The creation of task forces could be an im-
portant step toward easing the tensions be-
tween local law enforcement and many com-
munities. In addition, the task forces could 
serve to engage local law enforcement and 
local stakeholders in a transparent public 
problem-solving process instead of the current 
situation that encourages parties to choose 
sides. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING 
KEVIN 
SPRAGUE 
FOR HIS 30-YEAR CAREER WITH 
THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGI-
NEERS 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Kevin Sprague for his 30 
years of service with the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (USACE). Over the last three dec-
ades, Kevin’s steadfast devotion to the Soo 
Locks and the Upper Peninsula has ensured 
the economic and operational success of the 
locks and made him an indispensable part of 
Michigan’s First District. 
A graduate of South Lyon High School and 
Lawrence 
Technological 
University, 
Kevin 
worked as a mechanical engineer in the pri-
vate sector before joining the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers in June 1992. Throughout his 30- 
year career with USACE, he served as sur-
veyor, Assistant Chief of the St. Mary’s River 
Section, Chief of Soo Lock Operations, Chief 
of Facility Maintenance Branch, Assistant Soo 
Area Engineer, and Soo Area Engineer—a po-
sition he has held for 12 years. 
Kevin’s efforts have played a crucial role in 
the success of the Soo Locks, which is a vital 
infrastructure system for not only the Great 
Lakes region, but the entire country. His lead-
ership overseeing the operations and ongoing 
expansion of the Soo Locks have greatly ben-
efited the region. 
In addition to this project, Kevin worked dili-
gently to improve the Soo Area Office to ben-
efit his coworkers and community. This in-
cluded reorganizing the local office to provide 
more opportunities in professional develop-
ment, improving budgetary capabilities, and 
addressing safety concerns for workers. Over 
the pandemic, he also assisted in converting 
three storage containers into intensive care 
units (ICUs) for those affected by COVID–19. 
These efforts brought needed relief and assist-
ance to the local community, and USACE’s 
collaboration with local medical exports helped 
this project become a huge success. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Kevin Sprague for his 30 years of service with 
the 
U.S. 
Army 
Corps 
of 
Engineers. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such a dedicated 
and selfless citizen. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish Mr. Sprague all the best in his fu-
ture endeavors.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF THE 
HONORABLE JOHN F. DEBRUHL 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the extraordinary life and 
achievements of the Honorable Judge John F. 
DeBruhl of Galveston, Texas. 
John F. DeBruhl was born a slave on No-
vember 14, 1841, in Columbia, South Caro-
lina. He was later sold and brought to Texas. 
In June 1861, he married Alice V. Taylor from 
Parkersburg, WV, and together, they raised 
and educated seven children in Galveston. 
John DeBruhl was well known and re-
spected in his community and was appointed 
one of the first black Reconstruction Justices 
of the Peace in Galveston, Texas. He also 
served as County Court Judge and twice 
served as a Galveston City Alderman along-
side luminaries like N.W. Cuney. He was a 
prominent member of the Republican County, 
State and National Conventions. His leader-
ship efforts led to his nomination as a can-
didate for the United States Congress. 
John DeBruhl presided over diverse court 
cases with important issues during Recon-
struction Era Texas and had a substantial im-
pact on the early history of Galveston, Texas. 
Numerous state newspapers reporting on his 
judicial rulings, official meeting notes, op-eds 
and community speeches are still available to 
read today. 
When the Grand Lodges of the Negro Free 
Masons were expanding into the South, John 
DeBruhl was a founding member and officer of 
the Galveston Most Worshipful Prince Hall 
Grand Lodge Free & Accepted Masons of 
Texas. 
John DeBruhl was also instrumental in orga-
nizing the ‘‘docks’’ of Galveston to ensure 
black men could work and in better conditions. 
Moreover, John DeBruhl was a founding mem-
ber of the ‘‘Black Stevedores’’ in Galveston. 
Judge John F. DeBruhl is remembered as a 
man of purpose, honor, and an unwavering 
determination for the betterment of African 
Americans during one of the most tumultuous 
times in American history, the Post-Civil War 
Reconstruction years. 
Judge DeBruhl’s enduring legacy as a 
champion for education, equality, activism, 
and duty was passed on to his family. The 
phenomenal life of the Honorable John F. 
DeBruhl was nearly lost to history without the 
persistent and intentional efforts of his great- 
granddaughter Dr. Nanette DeBruhl. The re-
search done revealed a life of extraordinary 
accomplishments and whose influence has 
reached across time to impact today’s Texas.

RECOGNIZING THE CONGREGATION 
KNESETH ISRAEL OF ELGIN, IL-
LINOIS ON THEIR 130TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 13, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in recognition of the Congregation 
Kneseth Israel (CKI) of Elgin, Illinois for their 
130th anniversary. The Congregation provides 
spiritual support to a diverse and growing Jew-
ish population throughout areas in and around 
my district, including Kane, McHenry, DuPage, 
DeKalb, and Northwest Cook Counties. Mark-
ing CKI’s 130th anniversary is a fitting way to 
honor the lasting impact of its exemplary ef-
forts to build and strengthen community, foster 
inclusive environments, and give back to those 
in need. 
CKI has been a spiritual anchor for the com-
munity since 1892 when a small group of Jew-
ish residents organized the first Illinois syna-
gogue west of Chicago. However, the roots of 
the Jewish community in Chicagoland go back 
even further. In making Illinois their home, 
Jewish settlers were a critical part of the group 
of farmers, merchants, and tradesmen that 
laid the groundwork for the region we are so 
proud of today. CKI is an important part of this 
history, and I am honored to stand here in rec-
ognition of the Congregation’s continued ef-
forts to meet the needs of the surrounding 
community. 
Since its founding 130 years ago, CKI has 
demonstrated a commitment to serving others 
that stands as an example to all of us. 
Through education initiatives for adults and 
children, youth and senior interest groups, and 
through its worship services, CKI positively

shapes the lives of its members and all those 
who are touched by the Congregation. More-
over, through a series of social action projects, 
including canned food drives, blood drives, or-
ganized volunteering to advance local causes, 
and other forms of service, CKI goes beyond 
worship to serve the most vulnerable among 
us. 
I know I speak for many constituents in Illi-
nois’ 8th District when I say that I am thankful 
for the tremendous work that the Congregation 
Kneseth Israel has done in the last 130 years. 
This remarkable anniversary is worth com-
memorating, and we all look forward to what 
the next 130 years will bring for CKI as it con-
tinues to be a cultural and religious hub for the 
Jewish community in the area surrounding 
Elgin.
