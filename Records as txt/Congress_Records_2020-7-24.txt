PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of all creation, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
Continue to bless the Members of 
this people’s House as they move 
through 
the 
appropriations 
process 
here on the Hill. 
Amid the influences causing uncer-
tainty about the future, may they be 
filled with Your spirit of wisdom and 
understanding in the forming of legis-
lation to address the demands of our 
time. 
Bless the men and women who attend 
to those who are sick and those men 
and women responsible for the safety 
and 
security 
of 
our 
communities 
throughout the country. 
May all Americans live and act wise-
ly, being sensitive to the dangers of 
group dynamics that can override per-
sonal good sense in times of high emo-
tion and turmoil. 
Dear God, call us back to Your mes-
sage to be not afraid and to receive the 
peace You offer in nonviolence as it 
was lived and modeled by our good 
friend John Lewis. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

HONORING JUDGE MICHAEL W. 
KWAN 
(Mr. MCADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
MCADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I wish to recognize the treasured 
life and significant contributions of 
Judge Michael W. Kwan, a pillar of our 
community, who passed away on July 
21, 2020. 
Judge Kwan was a trailblazer in my 
State, known for leading on innovative 
judicial programs that respect the 
rights of the accused and improve pub-
lic safety for Utahns. 
A pioneer in his field through offer-
ing a drug court, Judge Kwan’s for-
ward-thinking approach emphasized re-
habilitation. This has served as a 
model for other courts across the 
United States. 
Judge Kwan stood as an example to 
many of those dedicated to public serv-
ice, holding fast to our common ideal 
of justice for all. 
Judge Kwan was a stalwart voice in 
Utah’s 
Asian-American 
community, 
fighting for the full story and to recog-
nize the significant contribution of 
Chinese workers to the completion of 
the transcontinental railroad over 150 
years ago. 
As the great-grandson of one of those 
workers, Judge Kwan helped found the 
Chinese Railroad Workers Descendants 
Association. 
I was privileged to have known Judge 
Kwan. I mourn the loss of this extraor-
dinary public servant together with his

munity. I am certain that his impact 
will be felt for decades to come.

SOUND MONEY CAUCUS IS 
FORMED 
(Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to announce the forma-
tion of the Sound Money Caucus. To-
gether, we will study and highlight the 
impact of monetary and fiscal policy 
on the United States dollar as a store 
of value and a means of exchange. 
As you can see, the supply of dollars 
has gone up dramatically, really since 
the gold standard ended in 1971. It is a 
gradual slope. But if you see since the 
recession, it has been aggressive. And 
then, obviously, here, this year, it has 
been nearly vertical. 
The value of the dollar is critical. 
That is the store of value for all Ameri-
cans. 
I am pleased to be joined by Co- 
Chairman ANDY
BARR, and Members 
like BRADY, BUDD, and ZELDIN. We look 
forward to working with everyone to 
highlight the importance of sound 
money. 
f 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 7183 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be removed 
as a cosponsor of H.R. 7183. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Vir-
ginia? 
There was no objection.

NATION’S DEFENSE WORKERS 
DESERVE OUR SUPPORT 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the National De-
fense Authorization Act. 
The heart of our Nation’s defense ca-
pabilities runs right through the con-
gressional district that I serve, from 
the Rock Island Arsenal to aerospace 
manufacturing in Rockford, to the Peo-
ria Air National Guard Base. 
Because of COVID–19, the last several 
months have relied on the service of 
our National Guard in new ways. 
The Peoria Air National Guard set up 
health clinics and testing centers in 
Bloomington, Illinois. They built a 
field hospital when Chicago needed it 
most. They have protected and served 
us throughout this pandemic. They de-
serve our support, and the National De-
fense Authorization Act will do just 
that. 
I was proud to help secure provisions 
that protect the benefits of our Na-
tional Guard members that they have 
earned, expand student loan benefits to 
make sure that they have a bright fu-
ture ahead, and to give our men in uni-
form a much-earned pay raise. 
The district I represent is steeped in 
rich tradition of service to our Nation. 
The bipartisan defense package that we 
passed this week honors and upholds 
that tradition. 
f 
RECOGNIZING E. SHAVER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Savannah’s 
E. Shaver, Bookseller, which was voted 
the South’s Best Bookstore 2020 by the 
readers of Southern Living magazine. 
This cherished bookstore is Savan-
nah’s oldest independent bookstore, 
and it makes its home in a building 
erected in the 1840s by Eliza Jewett, 
one of the few female builders in the 
city at the time. 
Ed and Esther Shaver turned this 
space into a bookstore in 1975, after 
selling antiques for a short time, and it 
has been thriving for over 40 years. 
In 2015, Jessica Osborne took the 
helm in leading this special bookstore 
to make it the success that it is today. 
This bookstore is more than just a 
store. It is an important part of down-
town Savannah’s character and charm. 
I am thankful for Mrs. Osborne’s 
commitment to keeping reading alive 
and well and for putting a smile on all 
faces that enter. 
During difficult times like these, it is 
imperative we support small businesses 
like E. Shaver now more than ever. 
f 
ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENT 
DELAYS 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I am out-
raged that the CARES Act stimulus 
checks, the economic impact pay-
ments, have not arrived to many of my 
constituents months after being signed 
into law. 
The stimulus checks provide timely 
and critical relief to families and indi-
viduals across our country who are 
struggling because of the coronavirus 
pandemic, but many constituents have 
told me they were forced to wait 
months for their stimulus checks or 
have yet to receive them at all. 
To make matters worse, when my of-
fice has contacted the IRS on their be-
half, the responses have been wholly 
inadequate, merely quoting what is on 
their website or failing to answer ques-
tions altogether. 
This is unacceptable. 
Families are unable to make ends 
meet, workers are choosing between 
keeping the lights on and buying gro-
ceries, and people have been laid off 
and are wondering where their next 
meal will come from. 
My constituents are in dire need of 
urgent assistance. 
The IRS must act immediately to ex-
pedite these stimulus checks so the 
American people can get through this 
tumultuous time. 
f 
BUST OF JUSTICE THURGOOD 
MARSHALL 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address what I guess I 
will refer to as the statue bill that we 
passed a couple days ago in this House. 
It was well known all the statues 
that were supposed to be removed 
there. And to be honest, I always bris-
tle a little bit when I hear Mr. Ste-
phens from Georgia, the former vice 
president of the Confederacy, getting a 
statue in this building. 
However, I don’t think enough people 
knew that in that bill, we are also 
going to require a statue or bust of 
Thurgood Marshall. 
In 1973, during Roe v. Wade, Justice 
Marshall was one of seven Justices who 
found a right to abortion, after it was 
illegal in this country for years and 
years, found a right to abortion in the 
Constitution put together by Alex-
ander Hamilton and James Madison. 
Worse, in the deliberations, there 
originally was going to be abortion al-
lowed in the first 3 months. Justice 
Marshall, along with Justice Brennan, 
weighed in to make it until viability. 
So the United States is, right now, one 
of only seven countries in the world to 
allow abortions this late, which is real-
ly just a horrific thing. 
I will say, if his bust is ever put in 
the Capitol, or a statue, I will always 
remember in 1973 when Justice Mar-
shall was one of the ones who weighed 
in to legalize abortion in the country 
as well as weighed in to make sure we 
were one of seven countries to allow 
abortion up to viability.

WAGE-GRADE 
WORKERS 
IN 
THE 
CIVIL DEFENSE INDUSTRY WILL 
BE PAID FAIRLY 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this morning to congratulate the 
House for passing the NDAA, National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
It is a win for Pennsylvania, and it is 
a win for civil defense workers all over 
this country. 
Namely, Tobyhanna Army Depot in 
my district is a winner here, because 
this fixes a problem. 
There is a wage and salary disparity 
between the maps. There is a map mis-
match that has been going on that I 
have been fighting ever since I got to 
Congress. 
This year, my bill, the Locality Pay 
Equity Act, got in the NDAA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3843 
July 24, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to 
Chairman SMITH of the Armed Services 
Committee and the entire Armed Serv-
ices Committee and the overwhelming 
vote on a bipartisan basis of the U.S. 
House to pass this. 
At long last, wage-grade workers in 
the civil defense industry in these par-
ticular districts will be paid fairly and 
equally alongside the salaried people 
they work side by side with. 
This is a great day for Tobyhanna 
and a great day for the people who 
have the backs of the people who are 
our warfighters all over the world.

NATIONAL HIRE A VETERAN DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowl-
edge tomorrow, July 25, as National 
Hire a Veteran Day. 
Veterans are an important part of 
our community. They sacrifice a great 
deal to ensure that we live in a Nation 
that is free and safe. Sadly, when re-
turning to civilian life, many of our 
Nation’s veterans find themselves un-
employed or underemployed. 
I am an Army dad. My son was 
wounded in combat during a tour in 
Iraq, and so this issue is personal. My 
daughter-in-law is also a veteran. 
Our veterans are highly trained and 
highly skilled. They deserve our sup-
port while deployed and when they re-
turn home. One of the best ways to do 
this is to prepare them for the work-
force outside of the military. That is 
one of the reasons I was proud to co-
sponsor the Veterans in Effective Ap-
prenticeships Act last year with Con-
gresswoman KATHERINE CLARK. 
The bill instructs apprenticeship pro-
grams to account for a participant’s 
competencies and prior experiences, in-
cluding those gained during military 
service, among other things. 
Mr. Speaker, the best way to thank a 
veteran is to hire a veteran. The skills 
obtained in service are invaluable. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE AMERICANS 
WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to mark the 30th anniversary on 
Sunday of the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act being signed into law by 
George H.W. Bush, President of the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to be the 
lead sponsor of that legislation in the 
House; a task that was assigned to me 
by our former whip, Tony Cuello of 
California. 
The ADA is an example of what we 
can do together, in a bipartisan way, to 
protect equal rights and help Ameri-
cans access opportunities to get ahead, 
to be included, to be a part of one Na-
tion indivisible. 
It was a landmark piece of civil 
rights legislation which passed the 
House and Senate with strong, bipar-
tisan support, and was signed into law, 
as I said, by President George H.W. 
Bush. 
And when the Supreme Court ruled a 
narrow interpretation of the law that 
was overly limiting, Democrats and 
Republicans came together to pass the 
ADA Amendments Act in 2008, to re-
store the original intent and expand on 
its protections. 
The ADA hasn’t just led to the con-
struction of accessible spaces, it has 
also helped change America’s percep-
tion of those with disabilities. And it 
brought dignity and recognition to mil-
lions who previously were excluded and 
thought to be lesser-than because of 
their disabilities. 
I have often said that the bill was 
misnamed. It should have been called 
the Americans with Abilities Act. Drop 
the ‘‘dis.’’ Drop dissing people. Under-
stand what they can do, which is what 
is important. 
Over the past 30 years, the ADA has 
made it possible for so many of our fel-
low citizens to participate in the work-
force, in government, and in every area 
of our society in ways they were pre-
viously unable to do without great dif-
ficulty. 
The law, Mr. Speaker, breathed new 
life into the words of our Declaration, 
that all are ‘‘created equal, that they 
are endowed by their creator with cer-
tain unalienable rights, that among 
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness.’’ 
Indeed, the ADA was, in so many 
ways, a declaration of independence for 
the millions of Americans living with 
disabilities, yearning not only to be 
seen and accepted, but to be treated 
equally as they pursue happiness and 
the American Dream. 
And it set a global standard, with its 
provisions adopted by literally scores 
of other countries throughout the 
world, so that the actions of this body 
and the United States Senate, and 
President George H.W. Bush were a sig-
nal to the world to include your citi-
zens as well. 
As we celebrate this anniversary, Mr. 
Speaker, let us remember that Ameri-
cans with disabilities still face many 
hurdles in employment, education, ac-
cess to healthcare, accessible tech-
nology, and the ability to live inde-
pendently. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope our country will 
use this moment, not only to reflect on 
the enormous differences we have made 
for people with disabilities, but also to 
rededicate ourselves to the task of con-
tinuing that work. 
I want to take a moment to thank a 
number of my colleagues and former 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who were instrumental in getting the 
ADA passed and signed into law. 
But before I mention them, let me 
mention the literally unnamed, un-
known thousands of people with dis-
abilities who had the courage and the 
conviction to come to this body and 
say to us, I have great ability, but I am 
being shut out. Hear me. See me. Help 
me. And we responded, as a country, as 
a Congress. 
Among them, of course, I have men-
tioned Tony Cuello, but then there was 
Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Bob 
Dole, Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator 
David Durenberger, Steve Bartlett, as 
well as Ham Fish, Teddy Kennedy, 
Major Owens, and Silvio Conte, who 
are no longer with us. 
And, of course, the late President 
George H.W. Bush. 
I want to thank the many advocates 
who were instrumental in building 
grassroots support for the ADA, as well 
as the Congressional and White House 
staff. 
I would mention my own staff, Me-
lissa Shulman, who did such an ex-
traordinary job in shepherding the 
ADA through multiple committees, 
through hundreds of hours of discus-
sion and debate as to how to make this 
a viable document, a workable docu-
ment for inclusion and honoring the 
dignity of those with disabilities. 
We worked late nights and we pro-
duced a text and built consensus. 
I want to mention, in particular, 
Chai Feldblum, former lead attorney 
for the ACLU at the time and, later, an 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
missioner, as well as former White 
House Counsel Boyden Gray, under 
President Bush. 
I also, again, want to thank Melissa 
Shulman, who served on my staff and 
was critical to getting this law en-
acted. 
I want to thank Representatives JIM 
LANGEVIN and DON YOUNG, who today 
serve as co-chairs of the Congressional 
Disability 
Caucus. 
Representative 
YOUNG, of course, was also involved in 
the passage of the law. 
There are too many others—includ-
ing the former chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee, the gentleman 
from Wisconsin, Jim Sensenbrenner— 
to name here, individuals who gave 
their time, energy, and talents to mak-
ing the ADA possible. 
I want to mention Senator Orrin 
Hatch, who worked so diligently in the 
Senate, not only on the passage of the 
bill, but on the amendments as well, 
passed years later, after the Supreme 
Court tried to narrow the protections 
afforded by the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act. 
And I am proud to join my friend 
from 
Rhode 
Island, 
Representative 
LANGEVIN, in introducing a resolution 
today to recognize the importance of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act, a 
celebration of the advancement of in-
clusion, and recognize the barriers that 
still remain for people with disabil-
ities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3844 
July 24, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues will join in supporting that res-
olution, and in celebrating this anni-
versary as well, in our shared commit-
ment to further progress in the march 
for the rights, dignity, and full equal-
ity of those with disabilities. 
RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
MICHAEL COLLINS 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we will 
honor next week, as we have honored 
this week, an extraordinary American, 
John Robert Lewis. He will lie in state 
just a few yards from here. He will be 
honored by thousands who will walk by 
the Capitol and his casket, and that 
will be right. 
In the Gospel of Matthew, Christians 
read, and others read, the parable of 
the talents, in which a returning mas-
ter praises his servants for being good 
stewards of his house. 
‘‘Well done, good and faithful serv-
ant,’’ he says. 
Last Friday, I believe that God wel-
comed John Lewis into His embrace 
with those very same words: ‘‘Well 
done, thou good and faithful servant.’’ 
Faithful to his God, faithful to our 
people, and faithful to his country. For 
such he was, God’s faithful servant on 
Earth, spending his life in service to all 
of God’s children, to their equal dig-
nity and equal rights, to their safety 
and success. 
That is how he approached his serv-
ice as a Congressman as well. 
Those of us who served with John in 
this House and who were his friends 
know that he did not perform that 
work alone. 
And, therefore, I rise to honor, to 
thank, and to revere another good and 
faithful servant. His name, Michael 
Collins. We all know him. He was, ar-
guably, John’s closest friend, closest 
confidant, and greatest supporter. His 
Chief of Staff deserves great praise for 
not only all he did for John Lewis, but 
for all of us. 
Michael Collins was at John’s side for 
more than two decades as his chief ad-
viser, confidant, and manager of his 
Washington office. Michael did not just 
work for John. They were family. Not 
‘‘like’’ family; they were family. 
Michael was like a second son to 
John Lewis, and all of us who are 
grieving with John Lewis’ family this 
week have been grieving with Michael 
as well. A void will exist in his life that 
we should all help fill. Thank him. 
Michael was an example, Mr. Speak-
er, of the best of those who work for 
this institution, the House of Rep-
resentatives. Those who sit at the 
desk, those who appear on the floor 
with us, those who work in our offices, 
those who work back in our districts, 
they do it because they love their 
country. 
And I know, Mr. Speaker, for myself, 
I love those who work with me. And my 
great benefit in life is they love me. We 
Baptists would call it an agape love; 
not a physical love, but a love of spirit, 
a love of soul, a love of vision. 
Michael Collins and John Robert 
Lewis were of one mind, of one spirit, 
and Michael reflected the best that was 
in John Lewis. Let us all do the same. 
Michael Collins can be an example for 
all of us. 
When I called John for the last 
time—actually, Michael Collins called 
me. It was Saturday, before the Friday 
of John’s passing. And he put John on 
the phone with me. He said, Mr. HOYER, 
John would like to talk to you. 
His was a weak voice, but a strong 
conviction, evidencing the courage he 
displayed throughout his life. 
And, of course, Mr. Speaker, I cried 
because I knew that it was probably 
the last time that I would talk to 
John. And I am so thankful to Michael 
Collins that he got me on the phone so 
that I could say goodbye to my dear, 
dear friend. 
b 0930 
It was a dear, dear friend, Michael 
Collins, who got him on the phone from 
Atlanta with me. 
As we mourn John this week, I have 
heard from countless people, telling me 
how much Michael made sure John 
never missed an opportunity to do 
good, to do right, and to do justice. 
So on behalf of us all, I want to 
thank Michael. 
Michael Collins enriched John’s life 
as John enriched his. He took good 
care of our friend, and he was at John’s 
side with such loyalty and good coun-
sel for all those years. 
To him, let us all say: Well done, 
good and faithful servant. 
God blessed John Lewis with Michael 
Collins, and God blessed us all with 
John Lewis.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as 
amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill, as amend-
ed. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentlewoman opposed to the bill? 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I am in 
its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Granger moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 7608 to the Committee on Appropria-
tions with instructions to report the same 
back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment: 
Page 33, line 10, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(increased by $102,500,000)’’. 
Page 35, line 22, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(reduced by $102,500,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in 
support of her motion. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion 
today to restore funding levels for a bi-
partisan priority to counter China. 
The amendment adds $102 million to 
restore funding for the Countering Chi-
nese Influence Fund to the current fis-
cal year level of $300 million.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3847 
July 24, 2020 
We can all agree that the Chinese 
Communist Party is actively working 
against U.S. interests all over the 
globe—from space technology to decep-
tive trading practices, to their outsized 
influence in pharmaceuticals and med-
ical equipment. 
The threat from China is real and im-
mediate, and now is not the time to re-
treat in our efforts to stop their de-
structive actions. 
The Countering Chinese Influence 
Fund was established last year to ad-
dress the growing reality that Beijing 
has a foothold in areas of critical im-
portance, including in our own back-
yard. 
China is now the largest investor in 
Latin America, practicing the same 
type of corrupt and predatory financ-
ing it uses elsewhere around the world. 
The commander of the U.S. Southern 
Command testified this year that some 
of China’s investments in the region 
could enable the Chinese military to 
threaten sea lanes vital to global com-
merce and the movement of U.S. 
Forces. He also expressed concern 
about Chinese telecommunications in-
vestments and how they could be detri-
mental to our security. 
We must directly address Chinese ac-
tions in order to protect our national 
security and maintain U.S. leadership 
throughout the world. This fund is one 
way to do that. 
I hope Members on both sides of the 
aisle will agree that it is more produc-
tive to fund programs with bipartisan 
support than to fund partisan efforts 
that have no chance of becoming law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this motion, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I share my colleague’s 
concern about China’s malign activi-
ties. That is why, last year, I nego-
tiated $300 million on a bipartisan basis 
to counter Chinese influence. And that 
is why I wrote this bill to give the 
State Department the flexibility to 
spend more than $300 million, if that is 
necessary. 
A President who has America’s best 
interests at heart would use this flexi-
bility to invest in a whole-of-govern-
ment response to the China threat. Un-
fortunately, President Trump refuses 
to spend the money that we have ap-
propriated and have given to him. 
On Twitter, President Trump, I am 
told, lavishes praise on President Xi. In 
private, according to his National Se-
curity 
Advisor, 
President 
Trump 
begged Xi for help in winning reelec-
tion. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
has 
turned a blind eye to Xi’s human rights 
abuses and endorsed a trade deal that 
allows China, frankly, to continue to 
cheat. 
Worse still, this motion to recommit 
is really an attack on America’s envi-
ronmental leadership. That is what 
this motion to recommit is all about. 
As the Republican whip has announced, 
this MTR slashes funding for the Green 
Climate Fund, which is essential to 
combat climate change. 
This amendment ratifies the Trump 
administration’s head-in-the-sand ap-
proach to climate change, which weak-
ens our standing in the world and 
leaves our Nation vulnerable to this ex-
istential threat. 
At its heart, the motion to recommit 
asks us to weaken American leadership 
in climate while trusting President 
Trump to prioritize the United States’ 
national security against our enemies. 
The last four years makes clear that 
this just is not correct. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the motion to recommit, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 183, nays 
228, answered ‘‘present’’ 1, not voting 
18, as follows:

30TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
AMERI-
CANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, 30 
years 
ago 
this 
Sunday, 
President 
George H.W. Bush signed the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act into law and 
ushered in a new era of equality and 
justice for people with disabilities. 
This law was ushered through Con-
gress with the great leadership of peo-
ple like Senator Tom Harkin; Con-
gressman Tony Coelho; our current 
majority leader, STENY
HOYER; Con-
gressman 
JIM
SENSENBRENNER; 
and 
countless others who rallied behind 
this cause, including from the private 
sector, people like Justin Dart. This 
was an extraordinary grassroots effort 
from around the country. 
The ADA guaranteed that the one in 
four Americans living with a disability 
have the right to learn, work, and live 
in their communities, free from dis-
crimination. 
As someone who has lived with a dis-
ability since the age of 16, I have wit-
nessed the transformation we have 
made into a more accessible and inclu-
sive society. In fact, without the ADA, 
I quite possibly wouldn’t have the 
privilege of representing Rhode Island’s 
Second Congressional District in the 
United States Congress. 
However, our work is not yet fin-
ished. We must strengthen the promise 
of the ADA to ensure that all people 
with disabilities can pursue the life 
that they choose. Accessible transpor-
tation, comprehensive home and com-
munity-based services, inclusive work-
places, and universally designed tech-
nology are only a few of the challenges 
that we must tackle moving forward. 
Madam Speaker, inclusivity benefits 
us all, and we must continue fighting 
for a world where accessibility is the 
default, not an afterthought. 
Happy 30th anniversary to all those 
who have been a part of this effort to 
include all those with disabilities in 
achieving a more active and inclusive 
life in our country.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I in-
quire of the majority leader the sched-
ule for the coming week. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I will say that on 
Monday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. 
for morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for 
legislative business, with votes ex-
pected to occur, Madam Speaker, ap-
proximately 12 p.m. 
On Tuesday, the House will not be in 
session as we pay respect to Congress-
man John Lewis while he lies in state. 
On Wednesday, the House will meet 
at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 
10 a.m. for legislative business. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 10 
a.m. for legislative business. Members 
are advised that votes on Thursday will 
be postponed until 6:30 p.m. 
I know that all Members would like 
to attend the funeral on Thursday of 
our brother and great Member and 
great American John Lewis, however, 
COVID–19 makes a small-group-only 
possible. And we will be returning, 
which is why votes will be delayed 
until the 6:30 hour. 
On Friday, the House will meet at 9 
a.m. for legislative business. Members 
are advised that last votes could occur 
later than 3 p.m. 
We got out earlier today, and I want 
to congratulate our floor director, 
Shuwanza Goff, who got us a schedule 
that is working very, very well. 
The suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business today. 
The 
House 
will 
consider 
two 
childcare bills. H.R. 7027 would create a 
$50 billion Child Care Stabilization 
Fund within the existing Child Care 
and Development Block Grant. This 
would immediately address the prob-
lems childcare providers are having in 
staying open and covering their in-
creased operating costs with limited 
revenue during this pandemic. 
The House will also consider H.R. 
7327, Child Care for Economic Recovery 
Act. This bill would expand the avail-
ability of childcare by providing tax re-
lief to families, providers, and employ-
ees, significantly increasing funds for 
the Child Care Entitlement to States 
programs, providing funds to improve 
childcare safety and infrastructure and 
ensure dependent care for essential 
workers during the pandemic and rec-
ognizing all childcare workers are es-
sential. 
These two bills are obviously a re-
sponse to the extraordinary challenge 
to childcare providers and those who 
need childcare services. 
In addition, Madam Speaker, the 
House will consider H.R. 7617, the De-
fense, Commerce, Justice, Science, En-
ergy and Water Development, Finan-
cial Services and General Government, 
Homeland Security, Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, Transpor-
tation, Housing and Urban Develop-
ment Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 
2021 appropriations bill. 
With that, we will have passed 
most—almost 97 percent, maybe 98 per-
cent, of the spending requirements of 
the Nation for the year to come. 
Members are advised that additional 
legislative items are possible, which we

will be discussing with the minority as 
well. 
Lastly, Members are further advised 
that conversations are ongoing regard-
ing additional coronavirus relief legis-
lation. 
Members should keep their schedules 
flexible for the week of August 3. Let 
me remind Members that are listening, 
and on the floor, the week of August 3 
was scheduled to be a week where we 
would begin the August work period. 
However, the Senate is not beginning 
its August work period until August 8. 
It is very likely, therefore, that we 
may 
not 
reach 
an 
agreement 
on 
COVID–19 until that week. 
I want to tell all Members that it is 
the intention of the Speaker and my-
self not to go on a work period until 
such time as we have passed legisla-
tion, hopefully, in a bipartisan way, 
and sent it to the President and the 
President signs it, which will help the 
American people, American businesses, 
and our country meet the ever-grow-
ing, quickly metastasizing crisis that 
we are confronting. 
Further information regarding the 
timing of a coronavirus relief bill will 
be announced as soon as possible. 
I would simply add that I will make 
a determination, along with discus-
sions with others, including the minor-
ity, next week at some point in time as 
to exactly how we should schedule. I 
think it will depend upon where we are 
in the negotiations and how quickly we 
can reach an agreement on COVID–19 
legislation. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for laying out the 
course of next week, as well as what 
could come beyond. We will surely go 
through some of those items. 
I will start with the gentleman’s 
schedule conversations about Monday 
and Tuesday, the ability for us to pay 
true tribute to our dear colleague that 
we lost, John Lewis. This week, of 
course, we mourn him. We look at the 
spot where John used to sit and think 
about the giant that he was. 
There were some wonderful tributes 
here on this House floor earlier this 
week, and it is very fitting that he will 
be lying in the rotunda, which is a rare 
tribute that we pay to special, unique 
people. He clearly fits that bill as a 
colleague, but also someone who was a 
legend, a giant. 
We got to serve with someone who we 
will tell our kids and our grandkids 
about. For that, we are all better for it. 
This body is better for John’s service, 
and this country is better for what 
John Lewis gave, both his blood, his 
sweat, his passion, his ideas, and his 
voice. 
And if the gentleman wanted to add 
to that—I know we share those same 
sympathies for the family, but also the 
same reverence that we did get to serve 
with someone who truly was larger 
than life. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
Mr. HOYER. I have spoken a lot 
about John. I spoke this morning about 
John and about his extraordinary chief 
of staff, Michael Collins, who was such 
a positive part of his life and who ex-
hibits so many of the traits that made 
John Lewis a wonderful, good, decent 
person who loved all of his brothers 
and sisters, whoever they were, what-
ever color they had, whatever religion 
they pursued. John Lewis was the best 
of us, and we will honor him appro-
priately. 
He will be one of the few Americans 
who is laid in state in the rotunda, in 
the center of our democracy, in the 
symbol of a free people. John Lewis de-
serves that honor. He enhances that 
honor by being so honored. 
And I thank the gentleman for his 
comments. 
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman 
and thank the leader and the Speaker 
for providing that privilege to John, to 
his family, and to all of us, to be able 
to send him off to a much better place, 
where I know he already is. 
As it relates to the schedule, as the 
gentleman talked about for potentially 
coming back in August, the negotia-
tions that are going on between the 
House and the Senate and the White 
House on a potential next relief pack-
age, clearly we are not in agreement 
yet. 
I know there was a House-passed bill. 
There is going to be a Senate bill 
brought forward that is probably a 
very different direction than the House 
bill. The White House has been talking 
about some items that the President 
liked. I know the President talked 
today about the payroll tax cut, which 
is something that I surely would advo-
cate for, as a way to help get people 
back to work and to help families have 
more money in their pockets during 
these tough times and also an incen-
tive to have businesses bring more 
workers back. 
He acknowledged that is probably 
not something that we will reach 
agreement on, but he also laid out the 
olive branch to try to find other ways 
we can get agreement, if we do get 
agreement. 
I would offer that. And as the gen-
tleman talked about, whatever we do 
would need to be a bipartisan bill. And 
I agree, if there is one, it is going to 
have to be one where we come to-
gether, if it is going to be signed by the 
President. 
I would offer that up, as we have 
looked at the trillions of dollars we 
have 
already 
appropriated—and 
we 
came together, Republicans and Demo-
crats in both Chambers, with the White 
House to send a number of relief pack-
ages that have provided dramatic help 
to millions of families, to millions of 
small businesses, and they are still 
struggling. 
But as we look at what we spent, we 
have identified over $500 billion of that 
money that still hasn’t been spent that 
is in various accounts. You look at the 
Paycheck Protection Program, over 
$120 billion still unspent. Of course, 
there are limitations on each of these 
funds. It might be possible that we 
would look at making those existing 
funds more flexible before we look at 
spending new dollars, if we can get 
agreement on that. 
I would also like to suggest, as we en-
courage the opening of schools, where 
kids can go back to the classroom, 
there is a healthy debate going on 
around the country. Many school sys-
tems have already made the respon-
sible decision to safely provide an envi-
ronment where kids can come back in 
school and they can have that oppor-
tunity. 
There is a lot of data out there. The 
American Academy of Pediatrics has 
laid out strong guidelines for how you 
can reopen schools safely. And safety 
clearly has to be the top issue. But 
they also talk about the danger and 
the damage to the children, the over 50 
million children in this country who do 
go to in-school settings, the damage 
that is done by not having that oppor-
tunity. 
They were denied it, of course, in the 
middle of a pandemic. Millions of par-
ents became home-schoolers. Myself 
and my wife were part of that. It was 
quite an experience. We would be more 
than happy to allow our children to go 
back into the classroom. And in New 
Orleans, they are scheduled to do that. 
They are going to be reopening schools 
there, as so many other systems. 
But we also know there are some sys-
tems that are contemplating not allow-
ing the children to come back in the 
classroom. I would just hope that we 
would urge all school systems to find a 
way to get it done safely. Others are 
doing it safely. It can be done safely. It 
doesn’t mean it is easy to do it, but we 
know it can be done. We owe it to those 
children, the millions of children that 
would be harmed by not having that in- 
classroom experience. 
You look at the billions of dollars 
that are still unspent, including money 
we sent to the States. We sent $150 bil-
lion directly to States for COVID–19 re-
lief. This money, without any change 
in law, would be eligible for those 
States to send to their local school sys-
tems to buy sanitizer, to buy masks, 
whatever else they need to safely re-
open the schools. 
And I would encourage, if there are 
any limitations that States identify, I 
would hope they share it with us be-
cause I think we can find agreement 
even there. 
But I think we should also look at an 
opportunity that if school systems are 
not going to provide that safe environ-
ment for kids to come back in the 
classroom and those parents still want 
their children back in the classroom, 
we should look, at least during this 
pandemic, to allow the dollars to be 
able to go somewhere else where they 
are willing to safely educate those chil-
dren. 
If the parents want to make that 
choice, if one school system is going to 
deny the children that opportunity, 
and there are other school systems

that are willing to safely educate those 
children, we should give them that op-
portunity to be able to let those dollars 
follow the children so that they are not 
denied 
those 
opportunities 
as 
the 
American Academy of Pediatrics dis-
cussed. I hope we can have all of these 
conversations in the mix of the nego-
tiations that are ongoing. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman 
for his comments. 
As the gentleman knows, we passed a 
bill on May 15th that included within 
that bill $100 billion for specific assist-
ance—not from the State’s excess 
funds, but specifically for educational 
institutions to accommodate the ex-
penditures necessary to provide for safe 
schooling. 
I will tell you, I represent five coun-
ties. We only have 23 counties in Mary-
land. We have relatively few political 
jurisdictions in our State, unlike some, 
who have many, many and are smaller. 
All five of the counties that I rep-
resent, including one of the largest 
school districts in the country, Prince 
George’s County, have decided through 
their elected school boards to open up 
virtually. And they are following the 
medical advice and the advice of sci-
entists as to how that can be done. 
I think all of us hope that our chil-
dren can go back to school as quickly 
as possible. I will tell the gentleman, I 
have three great-grandchildren, all of 
them in school. My granddaughter is 
extraordinarily happy with how the 
teachers of those three students—one 
is in pre-K, one is in third grade, and 
one is in seventh grade—how well the 
teachers have responded to the parents 
and to the children. But everybody 
wants to go back to school. 
I will tell you, I received a text from 
my granddaughter shortly after the 
President spoke about, well, you have 
to go back to school, and she said: ‘‘He- 
pop,’’ which is what she calls me—‘‘He- 
pop, I am terrified about sending our 
kids back to school.’’ 
b 1345 
We need to get an agreement. We 
passed a bill over 2 months ago through 
this House, and unfortunately, our 
friends in the United States Senate 
have not passed a bill, so we don’t have 
anything to go to conference with. 
Unfortunately, yesterday, we learned 
that the Senate can’t agree with itself 
on the Republican side of the aisle and 
has not got an agreement with the ad-
ministration. So at this point in time, 
as the gentleman knows, we have no al-
ternative, frankly, to discuss. But we 
are hopeful that that will happen soon. 
We are hopeful that at least the Senate 
Republicans will come to an agreement 
on an alternative they want to suggest, 
and then we can discuss that. 
Frankly, in order for the Senate to 
pass something, it has to be bipartisan, 
and there has been no bipartisan agree-
ment reached at this point either. So, 
we will wait. Hopefully, there will be 
an alternative, and hopefully, we can 
move forward quickly. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
agree. We worked very closely over a 
period of weeks to come up with the 
CARES Act, which I have heard from 
so many families and small businesses 
throughout my district, as well as 
through my colleagues and their dis-
tricts, how much of a lifeline that was, 
truly saving millions of jobs, saving 
millions of small businesses so that 
they can still work to reopen safely, 
hopefully get back to the successes 
they were having before. 
We know we are not there yet, but 
with the encouraging signs we are see-
ing on the medical front, with both 
therapies as well as vaccines, showing 
incredible promise in the testing stages 
through Operation Warp Speed, where 
we are able to test on thousands of peo-
ple. Nobody is cutting any corners, but 
we have a wider array of people to test 
now because the disease is so wide-
spread, 
not 
only 
in 
America 
but 
throughout the world. 
So, that testing that is being done in 
a very aggressive fashion is showing in-
credible promise. Hopefully, that gets 
us to a point where we have a vaccine. 
But as we know, today, we are not 
there yet. 
So, hopefully, we can continue work-
ing to help those businesses get back 
open or stay open and help families 
through the tough time. That is just 
why I would suggest that, as we 
haven’t gotten an agreement, whether 
the Senate hasn’t even gotten an 
agreement amongst themselves, as the 
gentleman pointed out. The bill that 
came out of the House recently was not 
bipartisan, but we were able earlier, 
through the CARES Act, to have a bi-
partisan agreement. So, the ability is 
still there. 
But, in the meantime, while those 
negotiations aren’t resulting in an 
agreement, I would just offer up that 
there are hundreds of billions, well 
over $500 billion, that we have appro-
priated that haven’t been spent and, in 
some of those categories, probably 
won’t be spent because of the limita-
tions. 
Maybe we can look at providing more 
flexibility with existing dollars before 
we talk about another trillion, to allow 
more uses for that for the people who 
need it as a bridge to maybe get to an-
other point, or a bridge to get to a 
healthier economy that takes off on its 
own. Hopefully, that would be one 
more option we can put on the table. 
I would ask if we do continue these 
negotiations, I know the gentleman re-
ferred to the possibility that that first 
week in August, we may come back. If 
we are to come back, and the majority 
decides to bring Congress back at a 
time that it is not currently scheduled, 
could we at least get a 72-hour notice, 
as normally is the case, so that Mem-
bers can adjust their schedules and 
know what is ahead of us without very 
short notice? 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, let me 
respond to my friend. 
Obviously, if there is money that we 
have already appropriated that is not 
needed and not disbursed, I think the 
gentleman is right that we can reallo-
cate that and repurpose that money. 
So, that can be part of it. But we sort 
of need to get to some parameters that 
the other side, meaning the Senate, 
can put forward. 
Secondly, let me say, I did, in fact, 
say when we were out for some period 
of time that I would give 72 hours’ no-
tice. I can’t promise that today. The 
reason I can’t promise it today is be-
cause we are going to have literally 
millions of people who are without help 
after the 31st of this month. 
As you know, the unemployment in-
surance goes out. In the HEROES bill, 
of course, we extended that unemploy-
ment insurance until January 31 of 
next year, as you know. 
What I can say and what I have told 
my Members is that if in fact we can’t 
get an agreement, and it doesn’t appear 
that we can come to the floor Monday 
or Tuesday, I think that is the 3rd or 
the 4th of August—I think the 1st and 
2nd of August are Saturday and Sun-
day. So, the 3rd and 4th or 5th, if we 
can’t get an agreement before then, 
there is no point in having Members 
sitting in their offices, twiddling their 
thumbs. I agree with that. 
I will have discussions with you and 
with Leader MCCARTHY. We will cer-
tainly not want to keep your Members 
here just waiting while negotiations 
are going on. 
I certainly will assure every Member 
that they will have 24 hours’ notice. 
But the need for action is so great and 
the consequences of inaction so harm-
ful, that I think we need to act as soon 
as we possibly can. And that 48 hours 
difference may make a difference to a 
lot of people. So, I will give an assur-
ance that there will be 24 hours’ notice, 
but I cannot give a 72-hour notice as-
surance. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for that. Maybe 
as we get toward the middle or end of 
next week, we will have a better idea 
where we are, and that number could 
change. Maybe there is an agreement 
by then, so we will continue this dis-
cussion. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s candor 
and willingness to work with us, to try 
to make sure that the Members are at 
least aware of where they will be, if 
they already have plans to do other 
things, that they can adjust that in a 
reasonable amount of time to address 
these challenges. 
Finally, I would want to ask the gen-
tleman, I know we have had a debate a 
number of times about this experiment 
with proxy voting. It was going to ex-
pire in July, and it was renewed until 
August. I don’t know if the gentleman 
knows yet if the intention is to con-
tinue going on with that, but there 
have been a number of cases where you 
have had Members that were here one

day and sent in a note the very same 
day saying they are unable to be here 
and then proxy-voted or were out on a 
boat or other things. 
I would hope this process ends, that 
we get back to voting in person. It has 
been very safe. The environment here 
is safe. Members are wearing masks 
when they are in close contact with 
one another. Obviously, we are at a 
very safe social distance, and you don’t 
need to wear a mask in this kind of en-
vironment. But when you are close, 
you have seen the Members following 
the protocols. There is a lot of safety 
equipment around. 
I would just hope we could get back 
to the ability to be here physically. It 
is a much better working environment 
when you can see your other colleagues 
and share experiences and talk about 
best practices that we are seeing in 
each of our districts, people that are 
doing things better, that we can help 
other people in other districts do. It is 
hard to get that when you are just not 
here. 
I would hope that we would work to-
ward getting back to as normal of a 
process as possible, recognizing where 
we are, but where we are doing that 
work here in the Capitol in the same 
place together at a safe distance, but 
at least here physically. 
I would hope we could continue to 
have this conversation. Clearly, there 
are a few more weeks and no decision 
has to be made yet. I don’t know if the 
gentleman has already made a deci-
sion. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his question 
and his comments. Let me say this. I 
think we have a different perspective 
on where we are in this country. In 
point of fact, I think there is reason for 
great, great, grave concern about what 
we see as an explosion, not just of test-
ing. If it were just testing—but it is of 
hospitalizations and of deaths. 
We have seen a geometric increase in 
the number of sick people, not just be-
cause they were tested, but because of 
a very heightened number of sick peo-
ple. There are some areas of the coun-
try which, frankly, leadership was very 
vigorous in imposing what some felt 
were 
draconian 
requirements, 
but 
which did, in fact, apparently make a 
significant difference in the trans-
mittal of the disease one to another. 
So we see the situation as more dire. 
We certainly agree with you that we 
are hopeful to accelerate—we have 
made big investments in not only a 
vaccine but therapeutics. There are 
some therapeutics that seem to be 
working in some respects. The sooner 
we can get there, the more confidence 
there will be in the American people 
that they can reengage, that we can re-
start and not only see one another, but 
do business with one another, and com-
merce can be pursued vigorously. 
We are not heartened by the figures. 
I know our President talks about 
things getting better, but we don’t see 
it that way. We don’t think the figures 
confirm that, which is sad for our 
country. Therefore, we need to con-
tinue to take the precautions we need. 
But having said that, let me speak to 
the proxy voting. 
I know your side has been very con-
cerned about the proxy voting. A, I 
don’t think the proxy voting has made 
any difference in the outcomes of the 
decisions we have made in this House. 
B, a relatively small number—I know 
the last time we met, there were some 
30. I am not sure this time, I think it 
is less this time. 
Let me say, I agree with the gen-
tleman. I have talked to some Mem-
bers. It is not for when you have an-
other thing to do. It is not for doing 
something you would rather do. I can 
name a number of Members—I won’t— 
on your side and my side who have sig-
nificant health problems and chal-
lenges, either themselves or in their 
families, and, therefore, they are con-
cerned about not so much getting to-
gether on this floor, but we don’t live 
on this floor. We have places that we 
live and eat, and we go to the cleaners. 
So, it is not just on this floor where 
we have wipes and sanitizer and a way 
to keep us healthy, and we do wear 
masks, most people wear masks. Unfor-
tunately, all of us don’t wear masks, 
and I think that is not good judgment. 
But the proxy voting has really not 
made any difference in whether this 
House has been able to act. 
How long will it go on? Right now, we 
are seeing an explosion of cases, an ex-
plosion of infections. Certainly, during 
that explosion, it is no time to say to 
people—and, again, I almost want to 
mention names because you will know 
the folks. They are not feigning it. 
Most of them are somewhere around 
my age who are very concerned about 
their health, the health of their fami-
lies, and the health of those to whom 
they will go home from here if they 
come here. 
I think the gentleman is absolutely 
right. Speaker PELOSI, myself, Leader 
MCCARTHY, Leader MCCONNELL, and I 
think Senator SCHUMER, have all said, 
as you have just said, it is better for us 
to be here together, to interchange 
with one another, discuss with one an-
other, to make suggestions to one an-
other, to have that personal engage-
ment 
that 
I 
think 
makes 
for 
a 
healthier legislative environment. 
But until we can do that with safety 
and ensure Members that if they come 
here that they will not be a danger for 
themselves or for others—and the doc-
tors advise us that the pandemic is 
still a danger to us—then we will con-
tinue to follow this rule. 
But I want to assure you that I make 
it very clear to Members: The rule con-
templates a danger to health to indi-
viduals or others, and that is why the 
proxy is available to them. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, look, 
obviously, we can have a disagreement 
over whether or not there should be a 
proxy voting system. But if there is 
going to be, I would just hope that we 
would see an increase in the integrity 
of that. 
I mean, for a Member to literally be 
here physically on the House floor, and 
then later in that same day, sign a doc-
ument—it is not a notarized document, 
but you are signing a document on 
your stationery to the Clerk of House 
saying you are physically unable to be 
here when you were physically here 
that day. It reduces the integrity when 
we see roughly a 15 percent increase in 
people that are here all week that all 
of a sudden sign a document saying 
they physically can’t be here on the 
fly-out day. It reduces the integrity. 
So if it is going to continue—clearly, 
our side does not want to see it con-
tinue, but if your side feels it should 
continue, I hope you would at least 
look at strengthening the integrity so 
if somebody signs a document, that 
you have confidence that that docu-
ment is an accurate depiction to the 
Clerk of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
b 1400 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, what I 
said to him was I agree with him on 
that point. But if Mr. SCALISE wants to 
make it again, he can make it. 
But I made it to my Members. I 
agree. It is for illness. It is for the 
threat of illness. It is not for conven-
ience. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I re-
spect that, and I appreciate the gen-
tleman discussing that. I know we have 
additional negotiations that will go on, 
hopefully, next week. And we will have 
a clearer picture if those will result in 
actual legislation we can come to-
gether on and get a clearer picture of 
the timeline. 
But at least until then, I know I ap-
preciate the opportunity to not only be 
able to pay tribute to our dear friend 
John Lewis here in this Chamber where 
we served together but then to go in 
the rotunda, as the gentleman ac-
knowledged, in a rare moment when a 
nonformer President of the United 
States gets to lie in that beautiful ro-
tunda. No one is more fitting of that 
honor than the great John Lewis. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman if he has anything else. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 3, 2019, 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOH-
MERT) is recognized for 60 minutes as 
the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED CORONAVIRUS 
RELIEF MONEY 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas. It is 
very gracious of him to yield me time. 
I just wanted to point out, in the re-
cent CARES Act, there was money to 
be directed to our State and local gov-
ernments around the country. In my 
own home State of California, larger 
governments 
have 
been 
fortunate 
enough 
to 
receive 
aid 
from 
the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund, but many of 
our smaller counties and cities have 
not. 
Under 500,000 population, there seem 
to be strings attached to distributing 
that money. The problem is that is not 
State money; that is Federal dollars di-
rected to go to local governments. 
So, at the hands of our California 
Governor, many of our rural counties 
are facing extreme budget deficits as a 
result of the coronavirus and have yet 
to receive a penny of those allotments 
from that fund that we in Congress fed-
erally have set up for them. 
While the virus cases increase across 
the country, counties that have yet to 
receive the aid will have to bear the 
brunt of even more coronavirus costs, 
as well as the other issues that they 
deal with in their budgets, keeping law 
enforcement on the road, our highways 
and roads repaired that are county ju-
risdiction, and all that. 
As the House and Senate plans to 
take up more coronavirus relief in the 
coming days and weeks, we need to 
make sure that the localities that the 
money we sent to in the CARES Act 
actually have the money distributed to 
them as it was intended by the Federal 
Government, to those local smaller en-
tities, cities, and counties. This is be-
fore we even consider sending even 
more money to the States or other 
forms of local government. 
It is not the State’s money. The next 
bill needs to go directly to all those 
forms of local government that was im-
plied and promised and intended by 
Congress. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BANKS). 
ALL AMERICANS SHOULD ROOT FOR COVID–19 
FIGHT SUCCESS 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend for yielding. 
Like my great colleague from the 
great State of Texas, I love America, 
but I want to know: Why does it seem 
like some want America to fail this 
test? We should all be rooting for 
America’s success in its fight against 
COVID–19. 
President Trump has overseen the 
unprecedented Operation Warp Speed, 
an effort to develop and disseminate a 
vaccine in record-breaking time. 
We learned this week that one vac-
cine in particular shows great promise. 
Thanks to President Trump, the U.S. 
will have access to the vaccine imme-
diately if it proves effective. 
Nothing like this has ever been done 
before, and if successful, this Presi-
dent’s achievement will be a defining 
moment in American history. 
We have already developed lifesaving 
antiviral treatments that have caused 
America’s fatality rate to plummet. 
Together, we can defeat this virus. 
We must fight it with science and facts 
and leave fear behind. 
Madam Speaker, I believe in Amer-
ica, and I ask all of my colleagues to 
stand up and support our President 
during this present crisis. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SHIMKUS). 
HONORING GENE AND KATHLEEN SHIMKUS 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for yielding. 
I also recognize AL GREEN, who was 
going to do the same thing. AL GREEN 
is a Democrat. Those stories don’t get 
reported very much when you go to a 
colleague, a friend, a Democrat, and 
say, ‘‘Hey, I really want a few minutes 
so I can talk about my parents,’’ and 
he was happy to do that, but he just 
ran out of time and had to run to the 
plane. So, my thanks to him. 
It was about this time 5 years ago 
that I came to the floor to honor my 
mom and dad, Gene and Kathleen 
Shimkus, as they were celebrating 
their 65th wedding anniversary. It was 
my hope that I would do so again this 
week, honoring their 70th wedding an-
niversary, but that was not to be. My 
mom passed away on April 6 of this 
year. 
Now, as I have done this week a cou-
ple of times, it is time to thank my 
parents for their incredible support 
throughout my life and particularly 
these last 24 years. 
My mom and dad were both local Col-
linsville kids. Dad was raised on South 
Clinton by his grandparents, and my 
mom was raised on Fairway Boulevard 
in State Park. So from Collinsville 
High School, Holy Cross Lutheran 
Church, and raising seven children, 
they knew a lot of people. 
Mom kept the local yard sign book. 
It was difficult for anyone to tell my 
mom no. She was loved. My dad would 
put up the yard signs and take them 
down. Mom also was involved in many 
early envelope stuffing parties for po-
litical mailings. 
Mom and dad covered the parades in 
Madison County, those that I attended 
and those that I could not. Dad drove 
and mom organized the walkers, signs, 
and candy. She helped fill the ranks 
with grandchildren, especially Adam, 
Gene, Elizabeth, Niki, Tim, Terry, and 
Dusty. And when out-of-state grand-
children were in town, they, too, were 
drafted to fill the ranks. Among these 
were Matthew, Maria, and Emily, along 
with Jennifer and Katy. Of course, I al-
ready spoke about my sons, about Da-
vid’s, Joshua’s, and Daniel’s participa-
tion in these parades. 
Mom and dad could be counted on to 
watch our kids at a moment’s notice. 
Dad picked me up from the airport 
when rides failed. It would be dad who 
would respond quickly when we locked 
ourselves out of the car or locked our-
selves out of the house. And who can 
forget the Minnie Winnie that they 
purchased to make it easier for my 
family to get around during the 1996 
campaign. 
Mom was elected to my open town-
ship seat. She served for 20 years. She 
loved being a trustee and supporting 
the local senior center run by the 
township. 
She continued to be friends to all, 
even those who identified as political 
opponents. In a story covering her re-
tirement, she called herself the inde-
pendent grandma. She referred to her-
self as the momma bear protecting her 
cubs. She sure defended me. She went 
on the attack against those who she 
thought were inappropriately attack-
ing her son. 
Collinsville has historically been a 
blue-collar and Democratic commu-
nity. But the Collinsville Democrats 
are conservative Democrats. They sup-
port organized labor, attend church, 
are fiscally conservative, and support 
the right to life and the Second 
Amendment. The love and respect that 
the community had for my parents al-
lowed them to give me, a Republican, a 
chance at elected office. 
I still believe that family is the 
major building block of our society. My 
family is the building block that I 
stood on multiple times as I served the 
people of southern Illinois. I am not 
sure I could have even taken on the 
challenge to run without the help of 
my mom and dad. I recognize their sac-
rifice and support and thank them. 
Hebrews 4:9 says, ‘‘There remains, 
then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of 
God.’’ My mom is enjoying her Sab-
bath-rest, but we still miss her. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
am greatly appreciative to hear that 
about Mr. SHIMKUS’ mom. What an ex-
traordinary woman. 
Mr. SHIMKUS and I both have been 
blessed in that regard. I know we both 
miss our mothers. 
My mother was an English teacher. 
Some people may find that hard to be-
lieve. My mother never quit teaching 
English even though I had her as a 
classroom teacher in the eighth grade, 
never quit teaching English. I would 
come home from football practice and 
say, ‘‘Oh, I am exhausted. I am going 
to go lay down.’’ And I would be hit 
with, ‘‘Oh, what are you going to lay 
when you get there?’’ ‘‘Okay. I am 
going to lie down. I hope you are 
happy, mom.’’ It is important to have a 
good, loving mom. 
It is a blessing to be in a country 
where there has been more freedom, 
more opportunity, more individual as-
sets for more people than anywhere 
else. But it is important to take stock 
because no country lasts forever. That 
is just the way of history, and it is im-
portant we learn from history, good 
and bad. 
There are a lot of characters that are 
represented by statues in this building 
that I have serious problems with, the

background, the things they did. But 
there is something to be learned from 
everyone, the good, the bad, the ugly. 
It is important because if you have a 
good basis in history, then it is easier 
to see the road ahead and which roads 
lead to what. 
Many in this country have begun to 
see that China really does intend to 
displace the United States, not just 
grow alongside it as a superpower but, 
ultimately, be the superpower. 
I have an article here from a maga-
zine by Charles ‘‘Sam’’ Faddis titled 
‘‘The ‘United Front’—How China Has 
Co-opted The U.S. Media.’’ It starts 
with a quote from Xi Jinping: ‘‘Wher-
ever the readers are, wherever the 
viewers are, that is where propaganda 
reports must extend their tentacles.’’ 
The article then points out: ‘‘We are 
now weeks into what amounts to a na-
tionwide insurrection,’’ and it needs to 
be looked at. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Texas for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, today is a sad and 
mournful day for worldwide Christians, 
the 
most 
persecuted 
believers 
on 
Earth. 
In accordance with Turkish Presi-
dent Erdogan’s grand plan to reconsti-
tute the Ottoman Empire, the beau-
tiful, majestic jewel of Christendom for 
nearly 1,000 years, Madam Speaker, the 
Hagia Sophia, Church of the Holy Wis-
dom, was converted to a mosque and 
Muslim religious services were ob-
served there today. 
b 1415 
As the Christian faithful and their 
houses of worship continue to dwindle 
in Turkey, this move by Erdogan was a 
step to extinguish Christianity once 
and for all, sadly. But it also poisons 
respect between religions and people of 
faith, Turkish citizens included. 
Turkey 
must 
reestablish 
Hagia 
Sophia’s status as a historic monument 
of universal significance and as an un-
questioned symbol of respect between 
religions and among people. 
The holy wisdom that we all call 
upon requires this approach, in the in-
terests of common humanity and good-
will. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), my 
good friend, for yielding to me. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate 
Congressman 
BILIRAKIS 
being here tonight. Great observations, 
history of family devotion to this coun-
try, very impressive. I appreciate the 
bringing up of the once great cathedral 
being made into a mosque. I had seen it 
in the news. It is very concerning. 
You look at our country: Where are 
we going? It helps to know where we 
have been. 
Mr. Faddis points out that at this 
time 
of 
nationwide 
insurrection: 
‘‘Monuments have been defaced, stat-
ues toppled, and the commercial cen-
ters of our great cities gutted. Yet, 
throughout, most of our mass media 
has characterized violence and lawless-
ness on an unprecedented scale as 
‘peaceful protests.’ The scope of the de-
struction has been concealed. The de-
mands of the anarchists and Marxists 
rampaging across America seemingly 
systematically mischaracterized sim-
ply as demands for justice and reform. 
‘‘What’s going on? How, in a nation 
rooted in the rule of law and respect 
for the democratic process, have we 
reached a point where violence and 
lawlessness are not only condoned but 
championed? Why are the guardians of 
the First Amendment seemingly in 
league with groups dedicated to de-
stroying existing social order? 
‘‘Some of the explanation no doubt 
lies in the fact that much of what 
passes for our mainstream media is 
simply so blind in its hate for Donald 
Trump that it will support anyone and 
anything that seems to oppose him. 
There are other factors at work, how-
ever, and some of what is transpiring 
may, in fact, be due to a decidedly 
anti-American agenda and the desire of 
a particular foreign actor not only to 
damage this great Nation but to pro-
mote its own particular ideology. 
‘‘The Chinese Communist Party uses 
propaganda and influence operations as 
a means of projecting its power and 
weakening its enemies. Chief amongst 
the targets for these kinds of oper-
ations is the United States. These oper-
ations are not run on some kind of ad 
hoc basis. They are coordinated and di-
rected at a national level by the CCP’s 
United Front Work Department. 
‘‘The CCP’s United Front system mo-
bilizes the party’s ‘friends’ to strike 
the party’s enemies. The system has 
existed for a long time, but it has been 
greatly energized and expanded in re-
cent years by Xi Jinping. It operates 
inside foreign political parties, dias-
pora communities, colleges, and cor-
porations, all with the goal of pro-
moting the party’s interests. The ex-
press goals of the United Front system 
include undermining social cohesion, 
exacerbating racial tension, and influ-
encing politics.’’ 
I want to insert parenthetically here, 
a lot of people were led to believe that 
Vladimir Putin in Russia had a number 
one desire of seeing Donald Trump 
elected President, but Russia also did 
some things to help Hillary Clinton 
with her campaign. 
But anybody who studies Putin and 
studies Russia would understand his 
number one goal and some of the 
former communist leaders’ goals in 
Russia are not for an individual can-
didate. They want to see the United 
States divided until it falls. They want 
to see the United States crushed. 
They were not able to do it from 
without, but they understand they can 
be divisive enough to turn us on each 
other in such a way that we would fall 
from within, as Lincoln said. 
You know, if murder is going to be 
our lot, it is going to have to be by sui-
cide, and some seem to be helping that 
along. 
In this article, Faddis goes on: ‘‘Of-
fices known as ‘Confucius Institutes’ 
on dozens of U.S. campuses have ‘long-
standing and formal ties’ with the 
United Front Work Department. As of 
this writing, there are 81 such insti-
tutes in the United States. The express 
purpose of these institutes is to shape 
American attitudes toward the Chinese 
Communist Party and Communism. 
The institutes are staffed by Chinese 
nationals, and their purpose within the 
United Front system is to feed Amer-
ican students and faculty members 
positive images of communism and the 
Chinese Communist Party. The stu-
dents whose minds are shaped then, ob-
viously, go on to careers not only in 
academia but throughout America, in-
cluding in the media. 
‘‘Perhaps even more insidious than 
the obvious efforts of the Confucius In-
stitutes to mold the thinking of both 
students and professors at institutions 
of higher learning across the Nation, 
however, are the direct inroads the 
Chinese Communist Party has made 
into the so-called mainstream media in 
this country. Armed with massive 
amounts of cash and leveraging the 
lure of the Chinese market, the CCP 
has, in essence, bought the voices of 
much of the ‘free press.’ 
‘‘ ‘You often see representatives from 
American companies with financial 
ties to China naturally become defend-
ers of the CCP’s policies and spreading 
the CCP’s propaganda’. . . .’’ 
You have even seen that in profes-
sional sports right here in the U.S. 
‘‘Most of the major American media 
outlets are owned by parent companies. 
These companies all have significant 
business interests inside China. They 
are dependent on Chinese goodwill and 
the approval of the Chinese Govern-
ment to safeguard those interests. 
‘‘The New York Times. Carlos Slim, a 
Mexican billionaire, owns 17.4 percent 
of the company and votes for one-third 
of the board. Slim has massive business 
dealings with Chinese companies tied 
to the CCP. Among those ties is 
Huawei, which is currently subject to 
U.S. sanctions for espionage and ac-
tions detrimental to American na-
tional security.’’ 
With regard to The Washington Post: 
‘‘In 2013, Amazon CEO and billionaire 
Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington 
Post for $250 million. Bezos has direct 
and massive ties to the Chinese mar-
ket, which is controlled by the CCP. 
The production of Amazon’s most pop-
ular products like Echo and the Kindle 
takes place almost exclusively in Chi-
nese factories. When you purchase a 
Washington Post subscription, it comes 
with an advertising supplement called 
‘China Watch.’ This supplement is sup-
plied courtesy of China Daily, a Chi-
nese state-run media outlet. 
‘‘CNN. The company is owned and 
run by WarnerMedia, which has signifi-
cant financial and organizational ties 
to the CCP. WarnerMedia is invested in

China Media Capital, a media company 
overseen by the Chinese Communist 
Party. CNN, via its President Jeff 
Zucker, is involved with NBA broad-
casts into China and efforts to expand 
NBA programming there. 
‘‘MSNBC and NBC. Both MSNBC and 
NBC News are operated by NBC Uni-
versal, a company with huge financial 
ties to the CCP. NBC is in partnership 
with China’s state-run media organiza-
tion. Xinhua has been identified by the 
U.S. State Department as a ‘foreign 
mission,’ meaning it is completely an 
arm of the CCP and does not function 
as an independent news outlet. NBC 
Universal’s Oriental DreamWorks is 
fully owned by a Chinese investment 
group. 
‘‘ABC. Walt Disney and ESPN are 
both owned by ABC. Both companies 
have large investments in the Chinese 
economy. In 2019, when the NBA re-
fused to denounce Chinese actions in 
Hong Kong, ESPN’s senior news direc-
tor instructed the network’s staff to 
avoid discussing Chinese politics or 
matters related to Hong Kong. 
‘‘Bloomberg. Both former New York 
City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his 
company Bloomberg LP are heavily in-
vested in China. Bloomberg LP sells 
terminals to its website in the Chinese 
market and helps finance Chinese com-
panies by sending billions of dollars 
from U.S. investors to the Chinese 
bond market. Bloomberg LP supports 
364 Chinese firms. Of these, 159 are 
owned by the CCP. In 2014, Bloomberg 
killed an investigation into the fi-
nances of the CCP elite. When the 
story was ready for publication, Edi-
tor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler crushed 
it, saying, ‘It is for sure going to, you 
know, invite the Communist Party to, 
you know, completely shut us down 
and kick us out of the country. So, I 
just don’t want to see that as a story 
that is justified.’ 
‘‘In 
short, 
essentially 
all 
major 
American media outlets other than 
those of a more conservative or liber-
tarian bent are subject to powerful Chi-
nese influence. What they cover is 
what the CCP wants them to cover. 
What they say is what the CCP wants 
them to say. 
‘‘A recent example is telling. In a re-
port looking at evening news broad-
casts from January 17 through March 
13, the Media Research Center found 
that out of 634 minutes of coronavirus 
coverage, just 3 minutes and 14 seconds 
were in any way critical of the Chinese 
Government’s actions. In 20 percent of 
the stories, reporters cited Chinese sta-
tistics. Those statistics, regarded as 
fraudulent by most objective observers, 
went unchallenged 97 percent of the 
time. 
‘‘This relationship between the U.S. 
news media and the CCP is only get-
ting cozier. Recently, the State De-
partment asked all U.S. employees of 
the Chinese state TV network CGTN to 
fill out detailed questionnaires with 
personal information. Based on the re-
porting, at least six former CNN re-
porters were found to now be working 
for the Chinese company. 
‘‘Perhaps, then, when we turn on the 
television and see the actions of Marx-
ists and revolutionaries being cele-
brated, we should not be surprised. 
When we see the President and law en-
forcement vilified, we should not be 
shocked. It’s just Beijing and the CCP’s 
minions doing their job. It’s the United 
Front.’’ 
So, when you have got not the coun-
try but the Chinese Communist Party 
and leaders in Russia wanting to see 
the United States collapse—and espe-
cially China. They are very dependent 
upon our money and our economy, but 
they are working hard and fast to get 
to a place where they can see our econ-
omy fall and they survive as the lone 
existing superpower. 
b 1430 
It has been well over a year, as I re-
call, but there were three people from 
Australia here, and I thought they 
would find it amusing, and I related to 
them that I had been in a conversation 
with some other Republican Members 
of Congress, and one of them said, 
LOUIE, we don’t have to worry. If we 
lose our freedom in the United States, 
we can all just go to Australia. And 
that, I thought, would evoke a smile 
from all of the Australians. 
There was no smile. And one of them 
said, do you not understand, if you lose 
your freedom here in the United 
States, China will take us over before 
you could even think about getting 
there. 
That was a sobering thought, and it 
still is. 
It is also important to note, as in 
this article by Christopher Holton, he 
points out in the headline, Eerie Par-
allels Between Antifa and the Chinese 
Cultural Revolution. 
He says: ‘‘If you think the tactics and 
rhetoric of antifa and Black Lives Mat-
ter demonstrators in America’s streets 
are new, think again. They’re old. 
‘‘The date is August 1966. Large num-
bers of students have organized them-
selves into a violent social movement 
to promote communism. 
‘‘The students ransacked whole vil-
lages, burned down homes and killed 
thousands of civilians, all in the name 
of communism. 
‘‘This activity 54 years ago happened 
in Communist China. The name of the 
student movement was the Red Guards. 
They were inspired and encouraged by 
the chairman of the Chinese Com-
munist Party; a person named Mao 
Zedong. He dubbed this violent reign of 
terror the ‘Cultural Revolution.’ ’’ 
It sounds familiar. 
‘‘The goal of the Cultural Revolution 
was to eliminate what Mao called the 
‘‘Four Olds.’’ The Four Olds were old 
customs, old culture, old habits, and 
old ideas—everything that predated 
communism in China. Mao saw them as 
a threat to his Communist rule, so he 
unleashed the Red Guards to eliminate 
them. The Four Olds had to be replaced 
with new customs, new culture, new 
habits and new ideas—communist cus-
toms, communist cultures, communist 
habits, and communist ideas. 
‘‘The Red Guards didn’t start out by 
killing people and destroying property. 
They started out with intimidation to 
back up Mao’s Cultural Revolution to 
change place names, especially street 
names. People even changed their own 
names so as to break with any associa-
tion with the Four Olds. 
‘‘The 
movement 
escalated 
from 
there. Anyone who seemed to cling to 
any of the Four Olds was harassed and 
intimidated. 
Property 
damage 
was 
next. Examples of old Chinese architec-
ture began to be targeted for destruc-
tion by Red Guards mobs. Chinese lit-
erature books were seized by the Red 
Guards and burned. Artwork was de-
stroyed by gangs of thugs who would go 
into homes to search for anything con-
sidered old. The Red Guards ransacked 
homes of those who were not consid-
ered reliable supporters of the Com-
munist Party. Ancient, sacred Chinese 
temples were destroyed. Cemeteries 
were desecrated and corpses were even 
dug up and torn apart. Monuments 
were taken down. 
‘‘Does any of this sound familiar to 
you? 
‘‘I’m sure it does. And that’s not sur-
prising. 
‘‘Counterinsurgency experts, intel-
ligence analysts, law enforcement offi-
cials and political scientists alike 
throughout America and the West are 
starting to wake up to the parallels be-
tween today’s insurrection and the Red 
Guards’ reign of terror during Mao’s 
Cultural Revolution in China. 
‘‘Antifa rhetoric parrots Mao’s com-
munist philosophies. Some antifa af-
filiates have even called themselves 
‘Red Guards’. Antifa’s modern roots in 
West Germany during the height of the 
Cold War included the notorious Red 
Army Faction terrorist organization, 
which had a Maoist orientation. 
‘‘The antifa insurgents started by 
targeting 
Confederate 
monuments, 
gaining sympathy, particularly from 
those on the left, such as liberals and 
progressives. But it sure didn’t stop 
there. Just as the Red Guards did in 
China a half century ago, the antifa 
thugs have moved on to statues and 
monuments 
of 
George 
Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, 
Andrew Jackson, Winston Churchill, 
Christopher Columbus, and even Ma-
hatma Gandhi. 
‘‘Now they are calling for tearing 
down statues and depictions of Jesus 
Christ. 
‘‘There have been calls for renaming 
Columbus, Ohio, St. Louis, Missouri, as 
well as U.S. Army forts named after 
generals who served in the Confederacy 
during the Civil War. 
‘‘When and where will it end? 
‘‘It won’t end if American Patriots 
who aren’t paying close attention don’t 
wake up to the fact that what antifa is 
doing is waging a Communist insur-
gency within our own country. We

must stop the mass virtue signaling 
and capitulation and stand up for 
America, the greatest Nation on Earth. 
‘‘Back in 1966, eventually even Mao 
and the Chinese Communist Party 
leadership had to rein in the Red 
Guards so that they did not become un-
controllable and threaten to compete 
for power. In just a matter of weeks, 
they had murdered an estimated 10,000 
people. Probably the only reason this 
episode is not widely known is because 
10,000 deaths during the Mao Zedong 
era in China was barely a drop in the 
bucket. Mao was the largest mass mur-
derer of the 20th century, responsible 
for the deaths of as many as 70 million 
people by forced starvation, exposure, 
and execution. That’s more than Hit-
ler, Stalin and Pol Pot combined. 
‘‘One cannot help but be suspicious 
that, at a time when the Chinese Com-
munists have covered up the origins 
and spread of an unprecedented pan-
demic and used force belligerently on 
their border with India, in the South 
China Sea, in Hong Kong, and over the 
skies of Taiwan, an insurrection remi-
niscent of the Chinese Cultural Revolu-
tion led by American communists has 
sprang up seemingly out of nowhere. 
Who’s 
been 
supporting 
Maoists 
in 
America and the West? Who is edu-
cating and indoctrinating them? Who 
is funding them? Who stands to benefit 
from the chaotic insurrection? These 
are questions that must be answered. I 
would not be surprised if the con-
necting of the dots leads to Beijing. 
‘‘Meanwhile, today in America, many 
Democrat Party leaders have taken a 
paternal, protective view of antifa, re-
fusing to condemn their violence and 
denying that they are a terrorist orga-
nization. Like the Chinese Communist 
Party, the Democrats may find them-
selves wishing they could reign in 
antifa as the violence escalates and 
further chaos ensues in cities that have 
been dominated by Democrat rule for 
decades.’’ 
Rather eye-opening, and it should 
find people waking up across America. 
I go back to the summer I spent in 
the Soviet Union, when it was the So-
viet Union. I saw socialized medicine in 
its purest form, and I thank God that 
our healthcare system was so much 
better. Of course, that was before there 
was so much control here by the gov-
ernment, insurance companies, phar-
maceuticals. 
It is a different system now. It is still 
better than what they have got. 
I have seen that in China, the system 
from inside, going into a hospital in 
Shanghai. It is interesting, as a for-
eigner, I was taken into this beautiful 
new little section where an MRI was 
conducted; not on me, but somebody I 
was there visiting. And it looked like it 
was really nice. 
But then, to pay for the MRI, we had 
to go through the biggest part of the 
hospital, where the Chinese people 
went, and it wasn’t nice at all. And I 
was glad to get out of there. It seemed 
filthy. 
But it was very clear; if you are a 
foreigner, they didn’t show you this big 
nice—well, it wasn’t that big, but it is 
going to look like everything is mod-
ern, beautiful, wonderful. But for the 
people that are citizens, it is just not 
so at all. 
We need to wake up in this country. 
Violence is not the way to go. It leads 
to an end. There will be an end and, as 
the Australians over a year ago pointed 
out, you guys lose your freedom, and 
there really isn’t going to be a safe 
place because the Communist Party of 
China will have big enough tentacles, 
no matter where you go. 
It is supposedly no longer communist 
in Russia, but it certainly appears to 
be totalitarian, under the vise grip of 
Vladimir Putin. 
But it is one of the reasons we have 
to have patriots that will defend our 
freedom, because if we are not willing 
to defend that with which we have been 
endowed by our creator, then we won’t 
keep it. 
Some wonder, well, if it is really and 
truly an endowment bequeathed to us 
by God, our creator, as the Declaration 
of Independence said, then why do we 
have to fight for it? It is ours. 
But in this world, like anything you 
inherit, if you are not willing to fight 
for it, there are evil forces that will 
take it away. Jealousy abounds in 
some people that are just mean. It is 
tough to come to grips with that fact. 
Some many people used to call them 
sociopaths. Then it became—I think it 
was the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual III or IV, maybe III, got away 
from sociopath, psychopath, and we 
called them personality disorders; anti-
social personality. 
But those personalities—as a judge 
that was trying to formulate the ap-
propriate sentence for a felon that had 
either been found guilty or pled guilty 
before me, it is important to under-
stand who is before you. And when you 
hear testimony about the antisocial 
personality, that they are not—the 
odds of rehabilitating them are not 
good, then you begin to understand de-
terrents, general and specific deter-
rents need to be guiding principles for 
their 
sentencing. 
Apparently, 
the 
mayor of New York hasn’t figured that 
out. 
b 1445 
So, Madam Speaker, if you release 
somebody who is an antisocial person-
ality, they are likely to just keep re-
peating the violence. In the same way 
if you just keep looking the other way 
from these people, you will destroy— 
and I still will say it—the most free 
country, at least it has been, with 
more opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, it is still a place 
where you can tell your child that if 
you 
want 
to 
be 
something 
badly 
enough and you work hard enough, you 
have a real shot at doing that. We have 
still got that here no matter what 
background you come from. It is worth 
fighting for, and it is worth protecting. 
We must suppress the violence and 
the victimization, especially in minor-
ity communities in downtown urban 
areas. Whether it is antifa or BLM, 
whatever the group is, the violence has 
got to stop. These people are not in-
spired by Dr. King. They are anathema 
to what he preached as an ordained 
Christian minister. 
People have got to wake up. This 
country is at risk. Our freedom is at 
risk. 
This is the way you go. There are so 
many people, whether it is George 
Soros or other billionaires, who are 
funneling money to make this a Marx-
ist country. Sadly for them, they 
didn’t learn enough history because the 
truth is, yeah, sure, the Marxists will 
take your money, and they will use it 
to create a Marxist country. But once 
that is achieved, the wealthiest don’t 
end up in that tiny little group of rul-
ers. Of course, there is no middle class. 
It is all the little rulers and then ev-
erybody else. 
They say: Thank you for getting us 
to this Marxist level. Now you are ei-
ther going to die or you are going to a 
gulag, and we are going to take your 
money from you. 
That is how it works. Unfortunately, 
they haven’t figured that out. I hope 
they wake up before it is too late for 
them and realize how fortunate they 
are to have been able to make the 
money they have in a country that had 
the freedom where they could make 
that kind of money. Unless they do, 
this country is in grave danger. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 22, 2020 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I join in the tributes to John Lewis 
with great personal appreciation for his ex-
traordinary life and work and for the oppor-
tunity to have served alongside him as friend 
and colleague for more than thirty years. 
My wife Lisa and I first got to know John 
and his late wife Lillian as new members of 
the House, classmates first elected in 1986. I 
have seen him advance to a senior position 
on the Ways and Means Committee, fighting 
especially to secure good, affordable health 
care for all. He has also invested great effort 
in protecting, and then restoring, the Voting 
Rights Act after the Supreme Court eliminated 
the crucial preclearance process. 
From the start, however, John used his po-
sition to interpret and educate as well as to 
legislate. Most famously, he led the annual 
Faith and Politics pilgrimage to that bridge in 
Selma, the site of Bloody Sunday, where John 
almost lost his life, among other civil rights 
sites. But a day did not go by that he did not 
recount to colleagues or constituents or total 
strangers the history and meaning of the 
Movement. He was never too busy—I expect 
all of us have witnessed this—to stop what-
ever he was doing to greet a school group 
with a word of inspiration or to answer a visi-
tor’s questions. 
While John’s place in history is secured by 
his bold and visionary civil rights leadership, 
exemplified by his courage to press forward 
on that bridge, his greatness also consists of 
a lifetime telling and retelling the story and 
calling our country and all of us to our better 
selves. His leadership had biblical qualities, 
evoking both the call to justice of the Hebrew 
prophets and the love ethic of the Sermon on 
the Mount. We often say that someone was 
‘‘one of a kind’’, but of John it was really true. 
John’s death leaves a huge void. His mem-
ory leaves us profoundly grateful to have 
shared some portion of his journey and also 
compels us to carry forward his vision of jus-
tice that ‘‘rolls down like waters’’ and the 
struggles it requires.

SPEECH OF 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, let me thank 
Chairman SANFORD BISHOP and Chair NITA 
LOWEY. I also appreciate the commitment that 
Ranking Members JEFF
FORTENBERRY
and 
KAY GRANGER have shown to support the hard 
work of our farmers and the safety of con-
sumers. I had the honor of chairing this sub-
committee a number of years ago, and I know 
firsthand the amount of work it takes. We face 
a health crisis and an economic crisis that 
have exposed serious disparities in our sys-
tems. This pandemic has further demonstrated 
how many were living on a knife’s edge, and 
I strongly believe we must be doing more, not 
less. 
This 2021 bill is recommending an increase 
of $487 million, almost $24 billion. It builds on 
the work we have done in the emergency re-
sponse bills for our nation’s farmers, families, 
frontline food workers. This pandemic has pin-
pointed to us where our system of supports, 
our social safety net, is not as strong as we 
believed it to be, as strong as our families, our 
farmers and our food workers need it to be. 
So, I am glad this bill is making short-term and 
long-term investments. Let me touch on a few 
areas of strength. 
The bill makes strong investments to ad-
dress the scourge of hunger in our country. 
The Census Bureau recently conducted a 
Household Pulse Survey to gather household 
information during the COVID–19 Pandemic. 
They found, quote, ‘‘Households with children 
were more likely to report permanent loss of 
employment and food shortages since the 
start of the pandemic.’’ 
Along with providing the necessary funding 
for the Food Stamp Program, Women, Infants 
and Children, and Child Nutrition Programs, 
the bill includes language to block implemen-
tation of rules that would threaten benefits for 
hundreds of thousands of people. I want to re-
mind my colleagues that food stamp spending 
is a powerful anti-recession tool. It has pre-
viously been estimated that for each dollar 
spent from benefits, a $1.70 is generated in 
economic activity. 
The bill also takes action to ensure the safe-
ty of our nation’s food supply, as well as the 
health of the workers producing that food. 
Workers on the frontline of our food supply 
chain—food processing, meat and poultry 
plant employees, and farmworkers—play an 
essential role in the availability of food. I thank 
the Chairman for his leadership on including 
language to prevent USDA from granting 
linespeed waivers to corporate meatpackers 
as well as the inclusion of language encour-
aging USDA to prioritize financial assistance 
to employers of farmworkers who can show 
they are complying with the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention guidelines. We 
must push for leadership and accountability. 
Recently, FDA Commissioner Hanh refused 
to refute the president’s false claim about the 
severity of the virus. As has been reported by 
the Boston Globe, quote, ‘‘the World Health 
Organization has said about 20 percent of 
those diagnosed with COVID–19 progress to 
severe disease, including pneumonia and res-
piratory failure.’’ But, the president said 99 
percent of cases were, quote, ‘‘totally harm-
less.’’ CNN’s Dana Bash pressed Commis-
sioner Hahn on this false claim. But, Commis-
sioner Hahn said, quote, ‘‘I’m not going to get 
into who’s right and who’s wrong.’’ That is the 
mission of the FDA, as the public’s primary 
regulatory agency for public health. The man-
date of the agency is to distinguish between 
right and wrong, especially as it relates to mis-
leading claims about this virus. So, as we in-
vest in the FDA’s mission, I look forward to 
working with others on the subcommittee and 
the full committee to make sure the agency 
provides the most accurate information to the 
public. 
Finally, I am proud of the $2 billion in inter-
national food aid provided by this bill. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has increased hardship 
around the globe and I believe we have a 
moral obligation to lend a helping hand. The 
bill includes $1.775 billion for Food for Peace 
grants, $235 million for McGovern-Dole, and 
again provides $1 million in funding for the 
International Agricultural Education Fellowship 
program. 
I close by thanking the leadership of this 
committee for continuing to be taking the long 
term and near-term actions necessary to be 
protecting the public, for food security, for food 
safety, and worker safety. This is what the so-
cial safety net is for: To assist members of our 
community in their time of need. No one 
should fall through the cracks. No one need 
suffer.

SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
express my support for H.R. 7608, the State 
and Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Rural De-
velopment, Interior, Environment, Military Con-
struction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations 
Act for Fiscal Year 2021. This year’s legisla-
tion includes a number of priorities that I have 
advocated for which will benefit my home 
state of Rhode Island, protect our environ-
ment, benefit families, serve our nation’s vet-
erans, and strengthen our national security. I 
would like to thank Chairwoman LOWEY and 
Ranking Member GRANGER, as well as the 
Subcommittee Chairs and Ranking Members 
for their work on this year’s House legislation. 
The State and Foreign Operations division 
makes important strides in strengthening our 
national security. For the past three and a half 
years, the Trump Administration has made us 
less safe. The State Foreign Operations and 
Related Agencies funding bill, however, would 
make the country, and Rhode Islanders, safer. 
Along with funds for diplomacy—something 
that the United States should be investing in,

E676 
July 24, 2020 
rather than making a mockery of—this bill in-
vests in emergency appropriations for global 
coronavirus preparedness, response, and re-
lief efforts. Because if we do not address the 
global pandemic, it will continue to come back 
to us. 
In addition, this bill supports global repro-
ductive health and family planning programs; 
and promotes equality for LGBTI people and 
people with disabilities. In particular, it con-
tains my increase-decrease amendment to 
draw attention to the State Department’s 
shameful attempt to turn back time and strip 
women and LGBTQI individuals of their civil 
and human rights. 
Members of the House and Senate have 
now sent five letters to Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo expressing our strong, contin-
ued concern regarding the work of the Depart-
ment of State’s Commission on Unalienable 
Rights (‘‘the Commission’’), but we have re-
ceived no reply. It is simply inexcusable that 
the Department of State would not respond in 
any way to our repeated oversight attempts, in 
particular as the Commission has proven time 
and time again that it could undermine our na-
tion’s ability to lead on critical human rights 
issues, including with respect to sexual and 
reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and 
protections for millions of people globally in 
the LGBTQI community. 
As a member of the House Foreign Rela-
tions Committee I am particularly disturbed 
that the Secretary has chosen to create the 
Commission rather than honor the advice of 
the State Department’s Assistant Secretary for 
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, which 
is vested with the authority to advise the De-
partment on U.S. foreign policy related to 
human rights. I believe that the Department’s 
strategic priorities should be guided by the As-
sistant Secretary, Congressionally mandated 
reporting on human rights, and well estab-
lished and lasting human rights standards, 
rather than the Commission. By signaling, 
through the Commission’s mandate and mem-
bership, a desire to place religious freedom 
above all other rights, the State Department is 
undermining commitments the United States 
has made abroad. Indeed, the Commission’s 
actions create a risk that the United States will 
breach those legally binding obligations that 
do not align with the Commission’s view of 
human rights. Further, the Commission’s work 
could undermine priorities that the United 
States has encouraged other nations to adopt. 
The Trump Administration has shown, time 
and time again, that it is unwilling to rein in the 
behavior of despots and dictators. We must 
not allow the Commission to give them per-
mission to run roughshod over the human 
rights of even more people around the world. 
The United States should be on the front 
lines of protecting human rights at home and 
abroad, including those guaranteeing SRHR 
and protections for millions of people globally 
in the LGBTQI community. Looking to ‘‘natural 
law’’ as a method of undermining long estab-
lished human rights protections for minority 
groups and elevating religious freedom over 
other rights is both illegal and immoral. 
The Agricultural, Rural Development, and 
Related Agencies division provides funding for 
important agricultural research. It is critical for 
Congress to support research and educational 
programs to ensure the United States remains 
a global leader in agriculture. The U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture’s National Institute of 
Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) and their 
Agriculture 
and 
Food 
Research 
Initiative 
(AFRI) provide investments and grants in key 
areas of transformative research and develop-
ment. This year’s bill provides an additional 
$10 million above the enacted level for USDA- 
NIFA and AFRI, which will provide educational 
institutions with grants to continue work in key 
areas of transformative agricultural and food 
research. We must ensure that these institu-
tions have the funding needed to continue 
their vital work and demonstrate our commit-
ment to addressing agricultural challenges. 
This year’s Interior, Environment, and Re-
lated Agencies division will include a number 
of key priorities which will provide significant 
benefit to my home state. This bill increases 
funding for the Operation of the National Park 
System (ONPS) by $200 million from the 2020 
Fiscal Year. An increase for ONPS funding will 
allow for continued development and mainte-
nance of the Blackstone Valley National His-
toric Park, which commemorates and pre-
serves the birthplace of the American Indus-
trial Revolution. 
The bill also provides an increase for the 
Southern New England Estuaries Geographic 
Program. This critical program engages with 
stakeholders in my home state, and through-
out Southern New England, to preserve our 
region’s estuaries, which provide significant 
and economic benefit. It also helps to pre-
serve fragile ecosystems and wildlife habitats, 
and helps to manage the impacts of human 
activity along our coastline. 
I also strongly support this bill’s commitment 
to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) 
and the National Endowment for the Human-
ities (NEH). The increased funding for NEA 
and NEH will boost Rhode Island’s arts econ-
omy, and support our renowned community of 
artists. 
I was also very glad to see this year’s Inte-
rior and Environment appropriation will con-
tinue to restrict the issuing of new oil and gas 
leases in the Outer Continental Shelf. Rhode 
Island’s ocean economy generates more than 
$2 billion annually, and supports more than 
41,000 jobs in industries such as commercial 
fishing, tourism, and other recreational activi-
ties. Expansion of oil and gas drilling off the 
coast Rhode Island, and throughout New Eng-
land, would devastate our local ocean econ-
omy, destroy critical marine habitats, and con-
tinue to exacerbate the effects of climate 
change. 
Finally, in this year’s Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies divi-
sion, the committee took significant steps to 
strengthen suicide prevention programs for our 
nation’s veterans. In particular, this bill pro-
vides $313 million for Suicide Prevention Out-
reach programs. It will also ensure that $115 
million for the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL), a 
dedicated toll-free hotline for veterans experi-
encing mental health crises and thoughts of 
suicide, is available in FY21. This amounts to 
a $4 million increase for the VCL from the 
2020 level. It is estimated that each day 20 
American veterans take their own life. We owe 
it to the brave men and women who have 
served our nation in uniform to ensure that 
they have the best mental health care and 
available services for them when they return 
home. 
I thank you for the opportunity to express 
my support for H.R. 7608, and I urge passage 
by the entire House of Representatives.

SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 23, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 7608, a bill to provide Fiscal Year 
2021 funding for the Departments of Agri-
culture, Interior, and Veterans Affairs, among 
others. This package includes critical pro-
grams that help address important priorities 
such as helping our most vulnerable escape 
hunger and our veterans to receive the care 
and benefits they have earned. 
Our country has been hit by an economic 
freight train and many families have been reel-
ing for months and will continue to do so if the 
federal government does not step up in the 
fight against this deadly virus. Food insecurity 
was a challenge before COVID–19 but it has 
only gotten worse as tens of millions of Ameri-
cans have lost their jobs. We have seen long 
lines at food banks and pantries. 
The bill before us ensures that SNAP can 
continue to help struggling Americans. It 
blocks ongoing attempts by the Trump Admin-
istration to force more people to lose food aid. 
It supports the WIC program to ensure that we 
help some of our most vulnerable pregnant 
women, infants and children. 
It also increases funding for grants to help 
increase access to school breakfast, a priority 
for me. Unfortunately, too many kids begin the 
school day without a healthy breakfast and 
participation in school breakfast lags well be-
hind school lunch. Studies repeatedly show 
that students who consume nutritious break-
fasts have better health outcomes, and better 
educational outcomes. These dollars will help 
support innovative and proven interventions 
that can help increase participation. 
I appreciate Chairman BISHOP’s leadership 
in helping to make sure that more families can 
keep food on the table. 
Likewise, I appreciate Chairwoman MCCOL-
LUM’s continued efforts to protect our environ-
ment and the Great Lakes. I am pleased that 
the committee provides a $15 million increase 
for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
which has been an unmitigated success in 
working to help our communities address 
some of the biggest challenges facing these 
valuable waters. 
This bill also increases funding to help pro-
tect water quality. I thank the Chairwoman as 
well as Congresswoman LORI TRAHAN who 
worked with me to help push for greater fund-
ing to help address combined sewer over-
flows, which endanger both our waters and 
the public’s health. A great number of CSO’s 
are in the Midwest and Northeast and commu-
nities need all the support they can to help 
make the investments to reduce this threat to 
our waterways. The bill’s investment of $57 
million in regular appropriations and $400 mil-
lion in emergency funding will go a long way 
in helping address this problem. 
The bill also includes funding for the Clean 
Water and Drinking Water State Revolving 
Funds, which are the main federal programs 
supporting investments in critical water infra-
structure. Our communities are struggling to

deal with aging infrastructure and the funds in 
this bill are sorely needed. 
And I also appreciate Chairwoman MCCOL-
LUM’s leadership in protecting and strength-
ening programs that help Native communities. 
For example, the bill would provide $6.5 billion 
for the Indian Health Service, including $66 
million for Urban Indian Health. 
And the State-Foreign Operations bill rejects 
a variety of harmful cuts proposed by the 
President that would further damage our diplo-
macy and development efforts. The bill also 
includes language to permanently repeal the 
global gag rule, rejects efforts to defend the 
UNFPA, invests in global health, education, 
and environment programs, including to ad-
dress climate change. 
It is critical that we invest in our international 
affairs budget and I applaud chairwoman 
LOWEY for her steadfast leadership again in 
helping to protect these key programs. Sadly, 
this is her last appropriations cycle. While I 
wish her the best of luck in her retirement, she 
will be sorely missed. 
Lastly, the MilCon-Va bill makes needed in-
vestments in health care for our veterans, sup-
ports increases for homelessness assistance 
grants, and to process and pay benefit claims. 
This is a good package and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting it.

REMOVAL OF CONFEDERATE 
MONUMENTS IN NEW ORLEANS 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD the following speech, 
‘‘Truth: Remarks on the Removal of Confed-
erate Monuments in New Orleans’’ delivered 
by Mitch Landrieu at Gallier Hall in New Orle-
ans, LA on May 19, 2017. 
Thank you for coming. 
The soul of our beloved City is deeply root-
ed in a history that has evolved over thou-
sands of years; rooted in a diverse people 
who have been here together every step of 
the way—for both good and for ill. 
It is a history that holds in its heart the 
stories of Native Americans—the Choctaw, 
Houma Nation, the Chitimacha. 
Of Hernando de Soto, Robert Cavelier, 
Sieur de La Salle, the Acadians, the Islenos, 
the enslaved people from Senegambia, Free 
People of Color, the Haitians, the Germans, 
both the empires of France and Spain. The 
Italians, the Irish, the Cubans, the south and 
central Americans, the Vietnamese and so 
many more. 
You see—New Orleans is truly a city of 
many nations/a melting pot/a bubbling caul-
dron of many cultures. 
There is no other place quite like it in the 
world that so eloquently exemplifies the 
uniquely American motto: e pluribus unum— 
out of many we are one. 
But there are also other truths about our 
city that we must confront. 
New Orleans was America’s largest slave 
market: a port where hundreds of thousands 
of souls were brought, sold and shipped up 
the Mississippi River to lives of forced labor 
of misery of rape, of torture. 
America was the place where nearly 4,000 
of our fellow citizens were lynched, 540 alone 
in Louisiana; where the courts enshrined 
‘separate but equal’; where Freedom riders 
coming to New Orleans were beaten to a 
bloody pulp. 
So when people say to me that the monu-
ments in question are history, well what I 
just described is real history as well, and it 
is the searing truth. And it immediately begs 
the questions; why there are no slave ship 
monuments, no prominent markers on public 
land to remember the lynchings or the slave 
blocks; nothing to remember this long chap-
ter of our lives; the pain, the sacrifice, the 
shame . . . all of it happening on the soil of 
New Orleans. 
So for those self-appointed defenders of 
history and the monuments, they are eerily 
silent on what amounts to this historical 
malfeasance, a lie by omission. 
There is a difference between remembrance 
of history and reverence of it. For America 
and New Orleans, it has been a long, winding 
road, marked by great tragedy and great tri-
umph. But we cannot be afraid of our truth. 
As President George W. Bush said at the 
dedication ceremony for the National Mu-
seum of African American History & Cul-
ture, ‘‘A great nation does not hide its his-
tory. It faces its flaws and corrects them.’’ 
So today I want to speak about why we 
chose to remove these four monuments to 
the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but also 
how and why this process can move us to-
wards healing and understanding of each 
other. 
So, let’s start with the facts. 
The historic record, is clear, the Robert E. 
Lee, Jefferson Davis, and P.G.T. Beauregard 
statues were not erected just to honor these 
men, but as part of the movement which be-
came known as The Cult of the Lost Cause. 
This ‘cult’ had one goal—through monu-
ments and through other means—to rewrite 
history to hide the truth, which is that the 
Confederacy was on the wrong side of hu-
manity. 
First erected over 166 years after the 
founding of our city and 19 years after the 
end of the Civil War, the monuments that we 
took down were meant to rebrand the his-
tory of our city and the ideals of a defeated 
Confederacy. 
It is self-evident that these men did not 
fight for the United States of America, they 
fought against it. They may have been war-
riors, but in this cause they were not patri-
ots. 
These statues are not just stone and metal. 
They are not just innocent remembrances of 
a benign history. 
These monuments purposefully celebrate a 
fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the 
death, ignoring the enslavement, and the 
terror that it actually stood for. 
After the Civil War, these statues were a 
part of that terrorism as much as a burning 
cross on someone’s lawn; they were erected 
purposefully to send a strong message to all 
who walked in their shadows about who was 
still in charge in this city. 
Should you have further doubt about the 
true goals of the Confederacy, in the very 
weeks before the war broke out, the Vice 
President of the Confederacy/Alexander Ste-
phens/made it clear that the Confederate 
cause was about maintaining slavery and 
white supremacy. 
He said in his now famous ‘corner-stone 
speech’ that the Confederacy’s ‘‘cornerstone 
rests upon the great truth, that the negro is 
not equal to the white man; that slavery— 
subordination to the superior race—is his 
natural and normal condition. This, our new 
government, is the first, in the history of the 
world, based upon this great physical, philo-
sophical, and moral truth.’’ 
Now, with these shocking words still ring-
ing in your ears . . . 
I want to try to gently peel from your 
hands the grip on a false narrative of our his-
tory that I think weakens us. And make 
straight a wrong turn we made many years 
ago—so we can more closely connect with in-
tegrity to the founding principles of our na-
tion and forge a clearer and straighter path 
toward a better city and a more perfect 
union. 
Last year, President Barack Obama echoed 
these 
sentiments 
about 
the 
need 
to 
contextualize and remember all our history. 
He recalled a piece of stone, a slave auc-
tion block engraved with a marker com-
memorating a single moment in 1830 when 
Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay stood and 
spoke from it. 
President Obama said, ‘‘Consider what this 
artifact tells us about history . . . on a stone 
where day after day for years, men and 
women . . . bound and bought and sold and 
bid like cattle on a stone worn down by the 
tragedy of over a thousand bare feet. For a 
long time the only thing we considered im-
portant, the singular thing we once chose to 
commemorate as history with a plaque were 
the unmemorable speeches of two powerful 
men.’’ 
A piece of stone—one stone. 
Both stories were history. 
One story told. 
One story forgotten or maybe even pur-
posefully ignored. 
As clear as it is for me today . . . for a long 
time, even though I grew up in one of New 
Orleans’ most diverse neighborhoods, even 
with my family’s long proud history of fight-
ing for civil rights . . . I must have passed by 
those monuments a million times without 
giving them a second thought. 
So I am not judging anybody, I am not 
judging people. We all take our own journey 
on race. I just hope people listen like I did 
when my dear friend Wynton Marsalis helped 
me see the truth. 
He asked me to think about all the people 
who have left New Orleans because of our ex-
clusionary attitudes. 
Another friend asked me to consider these 
four monuments from the perspective of an 
African American mother or father trying to 
explain to their fifth grade daughter who 
Robert E. Lee is and why he stands atop of 
our beautiful city. 
Can you do it? 
Can you look into that young girl’s eyes 
and convince her that Robert E. Lee is there 
to encourage her? Do you think she will feel 
inspired and hopeful by that story? 
Do these monuments help her see a future 
with limitless potential? Have you ever 
thought that if her potential is limited, 
yours and mine are too? 
We all know the answer to these very sim-
ple questions. 
When you look into this child’s eyes is the 
moment when the searing truth comes into 
focus for us. This is the moment when we 
know what is right and what we must do. 
We can’t walk away from this truth. 
And I knew that taking down the monu-
ments was going to be tough, but you elected 
me to do the right thing, not the easy thing 
and this is what that looks like. So relo-
cating these Confederate monuments is not 
about taking something away from someone 
else. This is not about politics, this is not 
about blame or retaliation. 
This is not a naı¨ve quest to solve all our 
problems at once. 
This is however about showing the whole 
world that we as a city and as a people are 
able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile 
and most importantly, choose a better future 
for ourselves making straight what has been 
crooked and making right what was wrong. 
Otherwise, we will continue to pay a price 
with discord, with division and yes with Vio-
lence. 
To literally put the Confederacy on a ped-
estal in our most prominent places of honor 
is an inaccurate recitation of our full past, it

is an affront to our present, and it is a bad 
prescription for our future. 
History cannot be changed. It cannot be 
moved like a statue. What is done is done. 
The Civil War is over, and the Confederacy 
lost and we are better for it. Surely we are 
far enough removed from this dark time to 
acknowledge that the cause of the Confed-
eracy was wrong. 
And in the second decade of the 21st cen-
tury, asking African Americans—or anyone 
else—to drive by property that they own; oc-
cupied by reverential statues of men who 
fought to destroy the country and deny that 
person’s humanity seems perverse and ab-
surd. 
Centuries old wounds are still raw because 
they never healed right in the first place. 
Here is the essential truth/we are better 
together than we are apart. 
Indivisibility is our essence. 
Isn’t this the gift that the people of New 
Orleans have given to the world? 
We radiate beauty and grace in our food, in 
our music, in our architecture, in our joy of 
life, in our celebration of death; in every-
thing that we do. 
We gave the world this funky thing called 
jazz/the most uniquely American art form 
that is developed across the ages from dif-
ferent cultures. 
Think about second lines, think about 
Mardi Gras, think about muffaletta, think 
about the Saints, gumbo, red beans and rice. 
By God, just think. 
All we hold dear is created by throwing ev-
erything in the pot; creating, producing 
something better; everything a product of 
our historic diversity. 
We are proof that out of many we are one— 
and better for it! Out of many we are one— 
and we really do love it! And yet, we still 
seem to find so many excuses for not doing 
the right thing. Again, remember President 
Bush’s words, ‘‘A great nation does not hide 
its history. It faces its flaws and corrects 
them.’’ 
We forget, we deny how much we really de-
pend on each other, how much we need each 
other. 
We justify our silence and inaction by 
manufacturing noble causes that marinate in 
historical denial. 
We still find a way to say ‘wait’/not so fast, 
but like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, 
‘‘wait has almost always meant never.’’ 
We can’t wait any longer. We need to 
change. And we need to change now. No more 
waiting. This is not just about statues, this 
is about our attitudes and behavior as well. 
If we take these statues down and don’t 
change to become a more open and inclusive 
society this would have all been in vain. 
While some have driven by these monu-
ments every day and either revered their 
beauty or failed to see them at all, many of 
our neighbors and fellow Americans see them 
very clearly. 
Many are painfully aware of the long shad-
ows their presence casts; not only literally 
but figuratively. 
And they clearly receive the message that 
the Confederacy and the cult of the lost 
cause intended to deliver. 
Earlier this week, as the cult of the lost 
cause statue of P.G.T Beauregard came 
down, world renowned musician Terence 
Blanchard stood watch, his wife Robin and 
their two beautiful daughters at their side. 
Terence went to a high school on the edge 
of City Park named after one of America’s 
greatest heroes and patriots, John F. Ken-
nedy. 
But to get there he had to pass by this 
monument to a man who fought to deny him 
his humanity. 
He said, ‘‘I’ve never looked at them as a 
source of pride . . . its always made me feel 
as if they were put there by people who don’t 
respect us.’’ 
‘‘This is something I never thought I’d see 
in my lifetime. It’s a sign that the world is 
changing.’’ 
Yes Terence it is and it is long overdue. 
Now is the time to send a new message to 
the next generation of New Orleanians who 
can follow in Terence and Robin’s remark-
able footsteps. 
A message about the future, about the next 
300 years and beyond; let us not miss this op-
portunity New Orleans and let us help the 
rest of the country do the same. 
Because now is the time for choosing. 
Now is the time to actually make this the 
City we always should have been, had we 
gotten it right in the first place. 
We should stop for a moment and ask our-
selves—at this point in our history—after 
Katrina, after Rita, after Ike, after Gustav, 
after the national recession, after the BP oil 
catastrophe and after the tornado—if pre-
sented with the opportunity to build monu-
ments that told our story or to curate these 
particular spaces . . . would these monu-
ments be what we want the world to see? Is 
this really our story? 
We have not erased history; we are becom-
ing part of the city’s history by righting the 
wrong image these monuments represent and 
crafting a better, more complete future for 
all our children and for future generations. 
And unlike when these Confederate monu-
ments were first erected as symbols of white 
supremacy, we now have a chance to create 
not only new symbols, but to do it together, 
as one people. 
In our blessed land we all come to the table 
of democracy as equals. 
We have to reaffirm our commitment to a 
future where each citizen is guaranteed the 
uniquely American gifts of life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
That is what really makes America great 
and today it is more important than ever to 
hold fast to these values and together say a 
self-evident truth that out of many we are 
one. That is why today we reclaim these 
spaces for the United States of America. 
Because we are one nation, not two; indi-
visible with liberty and justice for all . . . 
not some. 
We all are part of one nation, all pledging 
allegiance to one flag, the flag of the United 
States of America. 
And New Orleanians are in . . . all of the 
way. 
It is in this union and in this truth that 
real patriotism is rooted and flourishes. 
Instead of revering a 4-year brief historical 
aberration that was called the Confederacy 
we can celebrate all 300 years of our rich, di-
verse history as a place named New Orleans 
and set the tone for the next 300 years. 
After decades of public debate, of anger, of 
anxiety, of anticipation, of humiliation and 
of frustration. 
After public hearings and approvals from 
three separate community led commissions. 
After two robust public hearings and a 6–1 
vote by the duly elected New Orleans City 
Council. 
After review by 13 different federal and 
state judges. 
The full weight of the legislative, execu-
tive and judicial branches of government has 
been brought to bear and the monuments in 
accordance with the law have been removed. 
So now is the time to come together and 
heal and focus on our larger task. Not only 
building new symbols, but making this city 
a beautiful manifestation of what is possible 
and what we as a people can become. 
Let us remember what the once exiled, im-
prisoned and now universally loved Nelson 
Mandela and what he said after the fall of 
apartheid. 
‘‘If the pain has often been unbearable and 
the revelations shocking to all of us, it is be-
cause they indeed bring us the beginnings of 
a common understanding of what happened 
and a steady restoration of the nation’s hu-
manity.’’ 
So before we part let us again state the 
truth clearly. 
The Confederacy was on the wrong side of 
history and humanity. It sought to tear 
apart our nation and subjugate our fellow 
Americans to slavery. This is the history we 
should never forget and one that we should 
never again put on a pedestal to be revered. 
As a community, we must recognize the 
significance of removing New Orleans’ Con-
federate monuments. 
It is our acknowledgment that now is the 
time to take stock of, and then move past, a 
painful part of our history. 
Anything less would render generations of 
courageous struggle and soul-searching a 
truly lost cause. 
Anything less would fall short of the im-
mortal words of our greatest President Abra-
ham Lincoln, who with an open heart and 
clarity of purpose calls on us today to unite 
as one people when he said: 
‘‘With malice toward none, with charity 
for all/with firmness in the right/as God 
gives us to see the right/let us strive on to 
finish the work we are in/to bind up the na-
tion’s wounds . . ./to do all which may 
achieve and cherish—a just and lasting peace 
among ourselves and with all nations.’’ 
Thank you.

HONORING CORPORAL LANCE 
MORRIS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Corporal Lance Morris 
of the Roaring Spring Police Department as 
he receives the Law Enforcement Medal of 
Valor in recognition of his distinguished serv-
ice to the citizens of Blair County. Awarded by 
the Blair County District Attorney, the Law En-
forcement Medal of Valor is presented for ex-
traordinary acts of valor and heroism. 
On the afternoon of July 26, 2019, Corporal 
Morris was dispatched to the parking lot of 
True Value Hardware Store in Roaring Spring 
to respond to a dangerous situation. As he ar-
rived at the scene, the armed suspect pointed 
his weapon at Corporal Morris, who quickly 
fired two shots hitting him in the chest. Cor-
poral Morris’ heroic actions protected the lives 
of innocent bystanders. 
Today, we commend Corporal Morris for his 
courage, commitment to duty, and tactical ex-
pertise in this dangerous situation. His actions 
have made Roaring Spring and Blair County a 
safer community. 
For his valiant actions in the highest tradi-
tions of Law Enforcement and the Roaring 
Spring Police Department, the Medal of Valor 
is bestowed upon Corporal Lance Morris. 
It is my sincere pleasure and privilege to 
honor Corporal Morris as he receives this 
highest award. On behalf of the 13th District of 
Pennsylvania, I thank Corporal Morris for his 
commitment to our community and congratu-
late him on his many achievements.

HON. FRED UPTON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise before 
you today to recognize a celebration as the 
Kalamazoo Gospel Ministries breaks ground 
on an expansion to their ministry. 
I want to recognize the extraordinary ac-
complishment of Pastor Brown and all the staff 
and volunteers at the Kalamazoo Gospel Min-
istries. I am incredibly proud of the work they 
are doing and send my sincere congratula-
tions today as they break ground on the new 
women’s and children’s center. 
For over 80 years, and in these uncertain 
times, the Kalamazoo Gospel Ministries has 
been a place of hope and healing in the Kala-
mazoo community. This new expansion, ‘‘A 
Shelter From Their Storm,’’ will no doubt be 
filled with the same heart and care that they 
have shown for decades. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
the Kalamazoo Gospel Ministries and their 
team and thank them for their continued serv-
ice to the Kalamazoo community.

HABITAT 
FOR 
HUMANITY 
IS 
MASKING 
A 
DIFFERENCE 
ACROSS SOUTH CAROLINA 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the following was published in the 
Aiken CEO on Thursday, July 23, 2020: 
As the coronavirus continues to impact the 
Palmetto State, South Carolina Association 
of Habitat for Humanity announces a state-
wide effort to ensure nonprofits have the re-
sources needed to safely serve communities 
during the pandemic. Masking a Difference 
is a one-day collaboration which will dis-
tribute 175,000 masks and 2,800 gallons of 
hand sanitizer among nonprofit organiza-
tions and Volunteer Organizations Active in 
Disasters (VOAD) partners at 17 Habitat lo-
cations throughout SC. 
‘‘Our toolkit has expanded beyond ham-
mers and shopping carts,’’ shared Nancy Lee, 
executive director of the state association of 
Habitat for Humanity. ‘‘As nonprofits are 
being called on to do more with fewer re-
sources, I’m grateful Habitat has been given 
the opportunity to share these supplies with 
our fellow philanthropic partners.’’ 
Since February, Habitat for Humanity has 
been working alongside state and federal 
agencies to ensure the safety of Habitat 
teams, partners, and communities. Habitat 
credits South Carolina Emergency Manage-
ment Division (SCEMD) and Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA) for ena-
bling this collaboration to occur. 
As of July 12, Habitat for Humanity has al-
ready distributed over 150,000 masks and 630 
gallons of hand sanitizer throughout 37 coun-
ties. Upon conclusion of Masking a Dif-
ference, Habitat will have dispersed a total 
of 325,000 masks and 3,400 gallons of hand 
sanitizer to assist in South Carolina’s 
coronavirus response. 
Nonprofit organizations seeking additional 
information 
are 
encouraged 
to 
visit 
southcarolinahabitat.org. Masking a Dif-
ference request forms for cloth face cov-
erings and 50-gallon drums of hand sanitizer 
will remain open through noon on July 20, 
2020. Submissions from eligible organizations 
will be accepted in the order received. Notifi-
cations will be sent out the week of July 20 
announcing the locations of pick-up and offi-
cial distribution date of Masking a Dif-
ference.

HONORING THE MCALLEN POLICE 
DEPARTMENT 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the McAllen Police De-
partment for another successful year lowering 
overall crime in the City of McAllen, Texas. 
This is the 10th consecutive year the 
McAllen Police Department has successfully 
lowered crime, resulting in a 35-year low. 
McAllen’s estimated population of 158,044 had 
a crime volume of 3,735 and a crime rate of 
2,363 per 100,000 residents in 2019. 
In 2018, the population was 154,634 with 
the crime volume being 3,978 and the crime 
rate being 2,573 per 100,000 residents. This 
shows that with a 2.2 percent growth in popu-
lation, the McAllen Police Department was 
able to decrease the crime volume by 6.1 per-
cent, and the crime rate by 8.1 percent in one 
year. 
I want to thank Police Chief Victor Rodri-
guez for his leadership in achieving this in-
credible milestone. Though he credits federal 
resources, technology and home surveillance 
systems for his department’s success, it takes 
a true leader and an exemplary team to make 
a difference of this magnitude. 
I also want to thank the brave officers of the 
McAllen Police Department. Every day, they 
risk their lives in order to make our community 
safer. Our city is safer because of devoted of-
ficers like Edelmiro Garza, Jr. and Ismael 
Chavez who unfortunately made the ultimate 
sacrifice. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the decade long achievement of 
the McAllen Police Department in lowering the 
crime in McAllen. Each member of the police 
department is an incredible leader in our com-
munity, and their legacy will no doubt inspire 
public service and volunteerism of future gen-
erations. 
IN MEMORIAL: RABBI ISAAC 
FURMAN 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Rabbi Isaac Furman. 
Rabbi Isaac Furman was a pillar of the 
southern New Jersey Jewish community. 
Rabbi Furman was the Rabbi of Congregation 
Beth El in Voorhees, New Jersey and helped 
found the Beth El Academy in 1961, now 
known as the Kellman-Brown Academy. 
An 
immigrant 
to 
this 
country, 
Rabbi 
Furman’s family left Poland in 1939 after the 
German occupation. His family initially fled 
east to Siberia before making their way south 
and then west at the conclusion of the war. It 
was at the displaced persons camps of Poland 
that Rabbi Furman met the love of his life, 
Molly. 
Southern New Jersey was truly fortunate 
that Rabbi Isaac and Molly Furman chose our 
community to settle down. A graduate of Ye-
shiva University, Rabbi Furman found his true 
calling as a teacher. Throughout his nearly 60 
years as a rabbi in southern New Jersey 
Rabbi Furman taught tens of thousands of 
Jewish children. His former students remem-
ber him as kind, funny and generous of spirit. 
Rabbi Furman and Molly raised their daugh-
ters, Esther and Phyllis in the community, and 
took great pride as they began families of their 
own. Molly Furman was an accomplished 
teacher who was a fixture of the community 
and I’m told that their love for one another 
lived on after her passing in 2016. Through 
Esther and Phyllis, the Furmans were blessed 
with six grandchildren and eleven great-grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I am told that his family 
was truly much larger than his children, grand-
children 
and 
greatgrandchildren. 
Rabbi 
Furman was beloved by generations of stu-
dents, his congregation and his community. 
Though Rabbi Furman passed away earlier 
this month I know his memory will be a bless-
ing for many years to come.

CONGRATULATING CHARLES AND 
SHERRY DOBIS ON THEIR 50TH 
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Charles and Sherry 
Dobis on their 50th wedding anniversary. July 
25th marks five decades of devoted matri-
mony for these two esteemed citizens of Ir-
ving, Texas. 
Originally from Gary, Indiana, ‘‘Chuck’’ and 
Sherry married in their hometown, and have 
since accompanied each other on a journey of 
personal and professional accomplishments. 
In 1971, Chuck graduated from the School 
of Pharmacy at Purdue University where he 
was a member of Pi Kappa Psi. For the past 
49 years, he has been licensed to practice 
pharmacy in Indiana, Mississippi, Louisiana,

reer, he has assumed a variety of leadership

roles which include President of the St. Jo-
seph County Pharmacist Association; Chair-
man and President of the Indiana Pharmacist 
Association (IPA); founding Chairman of the 
IPA PAC; and Chairman and Treasurer of the 
American Pharmaceutical Association (AphA) 
PAC. 
In 1979, Sherry also graduated from Purdue 
University with a Bachelor of Science degree, 
and continued to enhance her qualifications 
through a program at the South Bend Medical 
Foundation. Seeking to further her studies, 
she obtained her Masters in Public Administra-
tion (MPA, ’90) from Indiana University where 
she was involved in the Pi Alpha Alpha honor 
society. Sherry’s professional roles have been 
extensive. Over the span of her fruitful career, 
she has served as a Medical Tech. at 
Mishiana Community Hospital, Lab Director at 
LaPorte 
Hospital, 
Lab 
Administrator 
at 
Parkview Hospital in Vicksburg, MS, Senior 
Director for Laboratory, Respiratory and Busi-
ness services at VHA in Dallas, and Vice 
President for Business Development at Health 
Network Laboratories in Allentown, PA. 
Chuck and Sherry are now semi-retired, but 
they remain actively involved in the Catholic 
community and enjoy travelling, reading, gar-
dening, crafting, orchestra and fly tying/fishing. 
They are also the proud parents of Diane 
Dobis and loving grandparents of Anthony, 
Christina, and Vivian Dobis, all of whom reside 
in Irving, Texas. As Chuck and Sherry’s jour-
ney continues to unfold, may their commitment 
to one another continue to serve as an exam-
ple of how love and dedication can enrich our 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all my distinguished 
colleagues to join me in recognizing this note-
worthy milestone, the 50-year wedding anni-
versary of Chuck and Sherry Dobis.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR CHRISTIE 
PAPILLA CUNNINGHAM 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay special tribute to Major Christie Papilla 
Cunningham for her exemplary dedication to 
duty and service as she transitions from her 
previous position as a Congressional Budget 
Liaison for the Assistant Secretary of the Army 
(Financial Management and Comptroller). 
A native of Los Angeles, California, Major 
Cunningham was commissioned as a Military 
Intelligence Officer upon her graduation from 
the University of Southern California with a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Business Ad-
ministration. She has also earned a Master’s 
degree in Legislative Affairs from the George 
Washington University. 
For the past 13 years, Major Cunningham 
has honorably served in command and staff 
positions in the California Army National 
Guard, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. 
Army Special Operations Command, U.S. 
Army Cyber Command, and the U.S. Army In-
telligence and Security Command. She has 
been assigned to Fort Huachuca, Arizona; 
Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Belvoir, Vir-
ginia; and Fort Meade, Maryland. Christie de-
ployed to Afghanistan twice in support of Op-
eration Enduring Freedom, first as the Execu-
tive Officer for the Bagram Theater Joint Inter-
rogation Facility and then as the Joint Intel-
ligence Officer for Joint Task Force Paladin 
South, a Counter-Improvised Explosive Device 
Task Force in Kandahar, Afghanistan. 
In 2018, Major Cunningham was assigned 
as a Congressional Budget Liaison for the 
U.S. Army’s Assistant Secretary of the Army 
for Financial Management and Comptroller. In 
this role, Christie effectively managed the 
Army’s Research, Development, Test, and 
Evaluation portfolio and worked tirelessly with 
Members of Congress and their staffs to accu-
rately articulate the Army’s budget position to 
the Appropriations Committees. Christie’s pro-
fessionalism, integrity, and dedication to the 
mission are unmatched. 
Christie cherishes family. Her husband, Pat-
rick, also an active duty Major in the U.S. 
Army, and her children, Esai, Kai, Kaleo, and 
Kira, are the foundation of Christie’s success. 
As we know, military families share in the sac-
rifices made by our servicemembers. The 
Cunninghams’ selfless service to the U.S. 
Army and to their community is a shining ex-
ample of what makes our military the best in 
the world. 
Throughout her career, Major Cunningham 
has positively impacted countless soldiers of 
all ranks. Our country has benefited tremen-
dously from her extraordinary leadership, intel-
ligence, and passion. I join my colleagues 
today in honoring her dedication to our nation 
and her invaluable service to the U.S. Con-
gress as a Congressional Budget Liaison. 
I must also note that, as a Defense Legisla-
tive Fellow in my office, Major Cunningham 
consistently provided me with sage advice and 
quickly became a trusted source of counsel to 
me, my personal staff, and the House Appro-
priations Committee. Christie’s sterling intel-
lect, versatility, and team-first disposition 
proved indispensable in addressing the num-
ber of challenging tasks placed before her. 
Further, her incomparable work ethic, poise 
under pressure, and generosity will be sorely 
missed. To put it simply, Major Cunningham’s 
performance as a Defense Legislative Fellow 
was outstanding and reflects great credit upon 
the U.S. Army and the Department of De-
fense. I am deeply appreciative of her con-
tributions to my office and the U.S. Congress. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a genuine 
pleasure 
to 
have 
worked 
with 
Major 
Cunningham. On behalf of a grateful nation, I 
recognize and commend Christie for her serv-
ice to our country and I wish her all the best 
as she continues her service in the U.S. Army.

MEMORY OF OSCAR TEMORES 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, we 
pray for the soul and family of Navy Master- 
at-Arms 3rd Class Oscar Temores. 
Oscar, a native of Lemoore, California and 
a dedicated husband, father, son and brother, 
was proudly serving his country and protecting 
his fellow sailors at Joint Expeditionary Base 
Fort Story, Virginia Beach, when he tragically 
lost his life in December 2019. 
Unfortunately, the tragedy did not stop there 
for the family of Oscar Temores. When Beth-
any Temores, the wife of this fallen hero, 
joined the Congress as my guest for this 
year’s State of the Union, I learned just how 
difficult the experience had been for her and 
the family of Master-at-Arms Temores. Numer-
ous, compounding issues with the Casualty 
Assistance Program turned the process of lay-
ing Oscar to rest—one of the most traumatic 
things a spouse and family can endure—into 
what Bethany described as ‘‘a nightmare.’’ 
All service-connected families deserve our 
respect. We owe it to our fallen heroes to 
honor their legacy and to ensure military fami-
lies have support in their time of need, includ-
ing timely communication, travel and accom-
modation assistance, and an understanding of 
all benefits and other forms of relief. 
To ensure that no other family endures what 
the Temores family endured, I introduced an 
amendment to the FY2021 National Defense 
Authorization Act that includes key changes to 
the way the Department of Defense (DoD) 
handles the transportation of fallen heroes and 
to direct the Department to review the current 
Casualty Assistance Calls Officer (CACO) pro-
cedure in order to make improvements to ben-
efit all military families. Specifically, the 
amendment 
seeks 
to 
correct 
the 
miscommunication between the DoD, airports 
and transportation agencies in order to ensure 
survivors do not have to travel excessive dis-
tances, or experience undue effort, just to get 
their loved one home.

RECOGNIZING BRET BAIER COM-
MITMENT TO SERVICE IN JOUR-
NALISM 
HON. MICHAEL WALTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and career of news an-
chor Bret Baier as he celebrates his 50th 
birthday. Mr. Baier has dedicated many years 
to hard-hitting journalism and pursuit of con-
veying hard truths to the American people, 
often putting his own life on the line in 
warzones to do so. His informative journalism 
and steadfast moral compass embody the 
principles of a true servant leader. 
Bret Baier earned his bachelor’s degree in 
Political Science and English from DePauw 
University in 1992. He made his way into the 
television scene by working for several news 
stations from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Rock-
ford, Illinois and Beaufort, South Carolina be-
fore sending his audition tape to Fox News in 
1998 and serving as the Atlanta bureau’s first 
reporter. 
When our nation was attacked on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, Bret didn’t shy away from 
danger. He drove all the way to Arlington, Vir-
ginia to cover the attack on the Pentagon. The 
reporting he did during this time landed him a 
job as the Pentagon correspondent, covering 
key national security, intelligence, military, and 
foreign policy issues. In 5 years time, he cov-
ered some of the nation’s most impactful na-
tional security events, including the wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. He again did not shy 
away from danger, reporting from Iraq 12 
times and Afghanistan 13 times. Baier has 
interviewed President Donald Trump, Vice 
President 
MIKE
PENCE, 
former 
President 
Barack Obama, former President George W. 
Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney, 
traveling with these administrations and top 
military officials to report in 74 countries. 
In 2006, he served as the chief White 
House correspondent, covering the second 
term of the Bush administration. He has since 
covered the political cycles of the 2012 and 
2016 elections, moderating five Republican 
primary debates in 2012 and anchoring three 
GOP debates for Fox News in the 2016 cycle. 
Bret currently is Fox News Channel’s Chief 
Political Anchor and the anchor of his own 
show, ‘‘Special Report with Bret Baier.’’ It is 
worth noting that Special Report is the top- 
rated cable news program in its timeslot and 
consistently one of the top five shows in cable 
news. 
In a world defined by political division, Baier 
is known and respected as a straight shooter. 
His accolades include the 2016 Kenneth Y. 
Tomlinson Award for Outstanding Journalism 
by the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship 
Program, the 2017 Sol Taishoff Award for Ex-
cellence in Broadcast Journalism by the Na-
tional Press Foundation, and the 2018 Urbino 
Press Award by the Municipality of Urbino. He 
is a New York Times bestselling author, a lov-
ing father to his two sons Daniel and Paul, 
and a devoted husband to his wife Amy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the career and lifelong serv-
ant leadership of Bret Baier. It is with great 
pride that we thank him for his service and 
wish him continued health and happiness with 
his friends, family, and loved ones. We hope 
his 50th birthday is filled with joy, love, and 
peace. Here’s to many more.

HONORING SERGEANT JUSTIN 
DAVIS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Sergeant Justin Davis 
of the Martinsburg Police Department as he 
receives the Law Enforcement Medal of Valor 
in recognition of his distinguished service to 
the citizens of Blair County. Awarded by the 
Blair County District Attorney, the Law En-
forcement Medal of Valor is presented for ex-
traordinary acts of valor and heroism. 
On the evening of February 26, 2020, Ser-
geant Davis stopped a vehicle in Martinsburg 
Borough. The suspects began high-speed 
chase, which took place for 1.4 miles reaching 
speeds of nearly 100 mph. Though the sus-
pects attempted to flee, Sergeant Davis skill-
fully apprehended both of them. As a result of 
the arrest, the police found suspected heroin 
and a loaded .380 pistol in the defendants’ 
possession. A search warrant of the vehic1e 
yielded plastic bags, two scales, and approxi-
mately 15 grams of raw heroin. 
Today, we commend Sergeant Davis for his 
unflinching courage, commitment to duty, out-
standing tactical expertise, and communication 
in this dangerous situation. His actions have 
made Martinsburg Borough and Blair County a 
safer community. 
For his valiant actions in the highest tradi-
tions of Law Enforcement and the Martinsburg 
Police Department, the Medal of Valor is be-
stowed upon Sergeant Justin Davis. 
It is my sincere pleasure and privilege to 
honor Sergeant Davis as he receives this 
highest award. On behalf of the 13th District of 
Pennsylvania, I thank Sergeant Davis for his 
commitment to our community and congratu-
late him on his many achievements.

RETIREMENT 
OF 
HUMMELSTOWN 
CHIEF 
OF 
POLICE WILLIAM RYAN 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m truly hon-
ored to congratulate Chief William Ryan upon 
his retirement on July 31, 2020, from a distin-
guished career in law enforcement. Chief 
Ryan has dedicated nearly 35 years to South-
east PA and the Hummelstown Borough Po-
lice Department (HBPD), and I’m proud to rec-
ognize his exceptional career here today. 
Bill Ryan became a Hummelstown Police 
Officer in 1992, after five years with the 
George Mason University Police Department. 
Early in his career, he developed the ‘‘Witch 
Watch’’ program that organized high school 
volunteers to patrol for safety issues during 
Halloween, and keep trick-or-treaters safe. In 
1994, he formed the Hummelstown Neighbor-
hood Crime Watch Group, encouraging com-
munity volunteers to patrol the Borough on 
weekends. By 1995, he was promoted to Cor-
poral, and approached the then-chief with the 
idea of teaching DARE in the Lower Dauphin 
School District. He continued to organize 
events, like the National Night Out for 
Hummelstown, and the infamous ‘‘Turkey 
Bowl’’—first a football game, and later a bowl-
ing tournament between law enforcement and 
local schoolteachers to support the local food 
bank. 
In 1996, Bill was promoted to Sergeant, and 
subsequently Detective, serving as the HBPD 
criminal investigator. Just a year later, he 
began teaching DARE at the Lower Dauphin 
Middle School, which continued for 17 years, 
forming lasting connections with students and 
teachers alike—many of whom still refer to 
him as ‘‘Sergeant Ryan’’ and hold dear their 
memories of him from those classes. 
In 1997, Bill joined the Capital Region Fo-
rensic Unit, responsible for the collection of 
evidence in serious, high profile crimes. That 
same year, he completed the PA Commission 
on Crime and Delinquency Crime Prevention 
Course, and joined the County child abuse 
multidisciplinary team. In 1998, he appeared in 
a DUI training/public service announcement, 
which was shown Nationwide. 
In 1999, Bill was named PA Police Officer of 
the Year by the American Legion, and was 
named Officer of the Year for the Northeast 
Region—and the National runner-up, He also 
began teaching at the Harrisburg Area Com-
munity College Police Academy, and in 2001, 
joined the Dauphin County Child Abduction 
Response Team. 
By 2008, Bill was honored with a Career 
Service Award from the Dauphin County 
Chiefs of Police Association. He continued to 
teach the DARE program, and taught his final 
class in 2013. In 2014, he was awarded the 
PA VFW John Radko Gold Medal. Finally, in 
2016, he earned his highest rank, and was 
named Acting Chief of Hummelstown Police 
Department. 
Bill was known for ending his e-mails with, 
‘‘Be safe, stay sharp, and make good deci-
sions,’’ and every phone call with, ‘‘Peace’’— 
something we pray for everyday for those who 
stand on the Thin Blue Line.

TESTIMONY ON THE ROBERT E. 
LEE STATUE REMOVAL ACT 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 24, 2020 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
I include in the RECORD. the following testi-
mony, per Mitch Landrieu, who testified in 
support of my bill, H.R. 970, the Robert E. Lee 
Statue Removal Act, at the House Committee 
on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Na-
tional Parks, Forests, and Public Lands legis-
lative hearing on July 21, 2020. The testimony 
addresses Confederate statues and symbols 
on public lands. 
I want to thank Chair HAALAND, Ranking 
Member YOUNG, and the other Members of 
the Subcommittee for the opportunity to 
discuss the important matter of Confederate 
symbols. It is a pleasure to be with you this 
morning. 
My name is Mitch Landrieu I am the presi-
dent and founder of a social impact organiza-
tion called E Pluribus Unum, named after 
our nation’s founding motto. Our goal is to 
help advance racial and economic equity in 
the South. I also served as mayor of the city 
of New Orleans from 2010 to 2018 and Louisi-
ana’s Lieutenant Governor from 2004 to 2010. 
As many of you know, as mayor of New Or-
leans, I removed four Confederate statues 
from public land, with a process that started 
in 2015 and ended in May of 2017, with the re-
moval of a Robert E. Lee statue from the 
city’s most prominent circle. 
That process helped reintroduce historical 
facts and a more proper telling of the history 
of how and why many of these statues or 
monuments were put up in the first place. 
The historic record is clear, most statues 
of Confederate leaders were erected not just 
to honor these men, but as part of the move-
ment which became known as The Cult of 
the Lost Cause. 
The Lost Cause had one goal—through 
monuments and other means—rewrite his-
tory to hide the truth, which is that the Con-
federacy was on the wrong side of humanity. 
It sought to continue to oppress Black Amer-
icans. 
James W. Loewen, a retired University of 
Vermont professor, and the author of Lies 
Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get 
Wrong, put it succinctly in a Washington 
Post oped: ‘‘The Confederates won with the 
pen (and the noose) what they could not win 
on the battlefield: the cause of white su-
premacy and the dominant understanding of 
what the war was all about. We are still 
digging ourselves out from under the misin-
formation they spread, which has manifested 
in our public monuments and our history 
books. 
According to the work of the Southern 
Poverty Law Center, there are some 700 Con-
federate memorial monuments and statues 
erected well after the Civil War. There are 
over 1000 streets, buildings and other mark-
ers named after Confederate leaders. Accord-
ing to their research, ‘‘two distinct periods 
saw a significant rise in the dedication of 
monuments and other symbols. The first 
began around 1900, amid the period in which 
states were enacting Jim Crow laws to dis-
enfranchise the newly freed African Ameri-
cans and re-segregate society. This spike 
lasted well into the 1920s, a period that saw 
a dramatic resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, 
which had been born in the inunediate after-
math of the Civil War. The second spike 
began in the early 1950s and lasted through 
the 1960s, as the civil rights movement led to 
a backlash among segregationists. These two 
periods also coincided with the 50th and 
100th anniversaries of the Civil War.’’ 
In summary, the South lost the war and a 
group of people got together and decided 
that they were going to adorn the country 
with monuments that revered those who 
fought on behalf of a cause that was lost, 
which they wanted to make seem noble. It 
was a propaganda campaign of epic propor-
tions. 
You see, these statues are not just stone 
and metal. They are not just innocent re-
membrances of a benign history. These 
monuments purposefully celebrate and per-
petuate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; 
ignoring the death, the enslavement, and the 
terror that it actually stood for. 
The truth is they were fighting for the 
right to own and sell black human beings. 
History cannot be changed. It cannot be 
moved like a statue. What is done is done. 
The Civil War is over, and the Confederacy 
lost. We are all the better for it. 
But in this, the 20th year of the 21st cen-
tury, we should not debate whether the 
United States of America should revere the 
Confederacy. It is self-evident that these 
men did not fight for the United States of 
America. They fought to destroy it. They 
may have been warriors, but they were not 
patriots. 
Ultimately, as a country, we must grapple 
with a simple notion—there is a difference 
between remembrance of history and rev-
erence of it. 
To literally put the Confederacy on a ped-
estal is an inaccurate recitation of our full 
past, it is an affront to our present, and it is 
a bad prescription for our future. It ensures 
that all that our fellow brothers and sisters 
once fought to end will still continue. 
As President George W. Bush said at the 
dedication ceremony for the National Mu-
seum of African American History & Cul-
ture, ‘‘A great nation does not hide its his-
tory. It faces its flaws and corrects them.’’ 
Members, you now have an opportunity to 
do your part correct this past. This is an im-
portant first step. 
Let me close with a plea to your humanity. 
I noted in a speech upon removing the 
monuments that a friend asked me to con-
sider these monuments from the perspective 
of an African American mother or father try-
ing to explain to their fifth grade daughter 
who Robert E. Lee is and why he is revered 
with a statue. 
Can any of you look into her eyes and con-
vince her that Robert E. Lee is there to en-
courage her? Do you think she will feel in-
spired and hopeful? Do these monuments 
help her see a future with limitless poten-
tial? Have you ever thought that if her po-
tential is limited, yours is too? 
We all know the answer to these very sim-
ple questions. When you look into this 
child’s eyes is the moment when the searing 
truth comes into focus. This is the moment 
when we know what is right and what we 
must do. 
We cannot continue to walk away from 
this truth. We must remove these Confed-
erate symbols that dirty the soil of our be-
loved country. Once that is done, we can bet-
ter confront the racist systems that have di-
vided us by design for generations and get us 
closer to that more perfect union we all as-
pire to be. 
Thank you.
