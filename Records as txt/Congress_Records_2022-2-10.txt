FORCED ARBITRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it 
has been a busy, productive, and truly 
bipartisan week here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
After days of fruitful cooperation 
from both sides, the Senate is now a 
few moments away from approving one 
of the most significant changes to em-
ployment law in years, eliminating for 
good the awful practice of forcing vic-
tims of sexual harassment and assault 
into arbitration. 
An hour from now, we will be able to 
say this: The House has acted; the Sen-
ate has acted; and we are sending bi-
partisan forced arbitration reform to 
the President’s desk. It is a momentous 
reform bill and one that is painfully 
overdue. 
For decades, arbitration clauses have 
been routinely tucked into the fine 
print of employment contracts. Today, 
they impact about 60 million Ameri-
cans. And many people may not even 
realize such clauses affect them, until 
it is too late. 
All of us have heard the searing testi-
monies of those who have faced harass-
ment or abuse at work, only to dis-
cover their jobs offered precious little 
in accountability. 
Countless careers have been derailed 
or undone. Worse still, countless lives 
have been forever damaged. And for 
decades, 
workplace 
practices, 
like 
mandatory arbitration, have perpet-
uated 
cultures 
of 
abuse 
and 
unaccountability. 
We can’t ignore a basic reality of 
these clauses. They deprive victims of 
sexual harassment and assault of their 
basic rights by mandating they seek

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S620 
February 10, 2022 
remedy only behind closed doors of pri-
vate arbitration, with no other alter-
native. 
This is wrong; it is unfair; and it is 
about time it changed. And that is ex-
actly what we will accomplish through 
this bipartisan legislation. It will not 
only ensure that those who have suf-
fered sexual harassment or assault 
have the option to go to court if they 
choose, it will also be retroactive. Peo-
ple locked into these clauses right now 
will benefit just as much as new em-
ployees will in the future. That is an 
important point that hasn’t gotten 
enough attention. It will undo the per-
nicious effect of these clauses that al-
ready exist. 
I want to thank my friend and fellow 
New Yorker, Senator GILLIBRAND, for 
spending years advocating for this leg-
islation. 
This 
accomplishment 
wouldn’t be possible without her lead-
ership and her commitment to working 
with the other side. 
Likewise, I want to thank Senator 
GRAHAM and Senator ERNST for reach-
ing across the aisle and working with 
us to get this bill done. 
Yesterday, 
Senators 
GRAHAM
and 
ERNST met in my office, and we came 
to an agreement to move this forward. 
And we very much appreciate that. It 
was truly a collaborative effort by the 
Senate, and thanks to everyone’s work, 
forced arbitration for sexual assault 
and harassment will soon be a thing of 
the past. 
As I said in my very first speech as 
majority leader, Democrats will always 
be open to working with Members of 
the other side of the aisle when the op-
portunity arises. The differences be-
tween the parties are real and cannot 
be ignored, but we can neither ignore 
the genuine chances for progress when 
both parties agree to move forward on 
certain topics. 
Last year, it was precisely this ma-
jority’s commitment to bipartisan co-
operation that cleared the path for his-
toric hate crimes legislation. Together, 
we also passed a historic jobs and sup-
ply chain bill, which we hope is enacted 
soon. 
And together, Democrats and Repub-
licans secured the first stand-alone in-
frastructure package in years. 
f 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this week has been a continuation of 
that commitment to working with the 
other side when possible. The legisla-
tion on forced arbitration is a prime 
example. And yesterday we saw an-
other 
example: 
Appropriators 
from 
both 
parties 
announced 
that 
they 
reached a framework agreement for a 
yearlong appropriations package. 
This is a huge step forward for arriv-
ing at an omnibus, and it is great news 
for our goal of avoiding a yearlong CR, 
which would have been painful and 
costly. 
There is a lot of work left to do be-
fore we pass a government spending 
bill, but yesterday’s announcement 
shows appropriators are now on a very 
good path. 
We are driving forward toward an 
omnibus, and I am very, very hopeful 
and optimistic that we will get there. 
In the meantime, the Senate will do 
the responsible thing by passing a tem-
porary CR next week in order to give 
the appropriators enough time to put 
their funding packages together. 
f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, our colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle came together to an-
nounce an agreement on reauthorizing 
the Violence Against Women Act, 
which was last acted on nearly a dec-
ade ago by this Chamber. 
I want to commend my colleagues 
Senators FEINSTEIN and DURBIN, as well 
as Senators ERNST and MURKOWSKI, for 
all the work they have done to bring us 
closer to reauthorizing VAWA. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
who are cosponsoring this legislation. 
And I have a particular interest be-
cause when I was in the House, I helped 
carry the original VAWA legislation 
that became law and has now lapsed. 
Most importantly, I want to thank 
every single person who participated in 
yesterday’s 
press 
conference 
who 
shared their own experiences of abuse. 
The Violence Against Women Act is 
one of the most important laws passed 
by Congress in the last 30 years, and it 
is my hope that the Senate can take 
action on this bill in the near future. 
There are nine Republicans cospon-
soring this legislation so we need one 
more, at least, in order to clear a path 
forward. 
If we can find more support for 
VAWA, I would expect that the Senate 
will seek to take action. 
VAWA must be reauthorized. We can-
not allow inaction to persist for a mo-
ment longer, and with yesterday’s bi-
partisan announcement, we are closer 
than ever to achieving that goal. 
f 
POSTAL REFORM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on postal, there is one more sign 
of progress this week that I want to 
mention, another bipartisan effort like 
VAWA and like all of the other bills I 
have mentioned—arbitration and the 
CR—and this is the bipartisan efforts 
by both Chambers to pass the most sig-
nificant postal reform bill in decades. 
Later today—soon—I will file cloture 
on the postal reform bill approved 
overwhelmingly by the House earlier 
this week. For the information of all 
Senators, this will set up the first vote 
this coming Monday evening. 
Postal reform has been decades in the 
making and is one of the best steps we 
can take to strengthen one of our coun-
try’s 
most 
important 
institutions. 
Tens of millions of Americans depend 
on the post office every day. Seniors 
and veterans need it for things like 
medication. Businesses need it to func-
tion. Rural communities need it to 
stay connected. Countless people rely 
on the post office to connect with each 
other for things like birthdays, travel, 
the holidays, or any one of life’s many, 
many special occasions. 
By passing postal reform, we can en-
sure that Americans will continue to 
rely on a speedy, dependable, and well- 
run post office. We have all heard com-
plaints about how the mail delivery 
has slowed down. This is a strong, im-
portant effort to rectify that bad prob-
lem. It will be a win for everyday 
Americans and for the dedicated men 
and women who work to deliver our 
mail every single day. 
f 
CANNABIS LEGISLATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, fi-
nally, on cannabis legislation. All of 
these issues I have mentioned—forced 
arbitration 
reform, 
appropriations, 
VAWA, and postal reform—have been 
bipartisan efforts. They reflect a com-
mitment that Democrats made at the 
start of the year to work with the 
other side when the opportunities pre-
sented themselves, and I thank my Re-
publican colleagues for working with 
us. Before I close, there is one more ap-
peal I want to make for bipartisan co-
operation, and that is on cannabis re-
form. 
This morning, I joined with Senators 
BOOKER and WYDEN in sending a ‘‘Dear 
Colleague,’’ inviting Members from 
both sides of the aisle to join in an ef-
fort to draft and finalize comprehen-
sive cannabis reform. Last summer, I 
joined 
with 
Senators 
BOOKER
and 
WYDEN in introducing our framework 
legislation for Federal reform of can-
nabis, and we want to build on this 
framework as we prepare to introduce 
legislation in the near future. 
Today, millions—hundreds of mil-
lions of Americans live in States, both 
blue and red, where cannabis has been 
legalized in some way. It is long past 
time for the Federal Government to 
catch up. 
This is about individual freedom and 
about basic fairness. For decades, Fed-
eral cannabis laws have caused im-
mense damage to millions of Ameri-
cans, particularly Black and Hispanic 
people, who have been unfairly tar-
geted by these laws. We need to change 
that. We need to create opportunities 
for entrepreneurs and small businesses 
to legitimately pursue new opportuni-
ties, and comprehensive Federal can-
nabis legislation is critical—critical— 
to reaching that goal. 
I want to thank Senators BOOKER and 
WYDEN and all my colleagues who have 
worked with us on this important and 
long-overdue change. I hope we can 
make more progress on cannabis re-
form in the near future.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
moments ago, the country got yet an-
other terrible monthly inflation report 
under the Biden administration. Yet 
again, the data confirmed what work-
ing families already know painfully 
well: Rampant inflation and soaring 
prices 
are 
crushing—crushing—the 
American people. 
Experts had predicted another red- 
hot inflation report, around 7 percent. 
Even that alone would have meant we 
were still trapped inside the worst in-
flation in 40 years, but reality turned 
out to be even worse than that. It turns 
out inflation this past year hasn’t been 
7 percent; it has been 71⁄2 percent. In 
other words, if you haven’t personally 
gotten a pay raise of 8 percent or more 
in the last year, then Democrats’ poli-
cies have given you a pay cut—pay cut. 
To add insult to injury, reporters say 
the worst of this inflation was driven 
by the most painful categories for 
working families: food prices, energy 
prices, and rent. 
This is not about financial inconven-
ience for wealthy people who can afford 
to stomach it; this is about massive 
price increases for essential goods that 
make up a huge share of working fami-
lies’ budgets. Gas is up about 40 per-
cent since this time last year. Used car 
prices are up about the same. Meat, 
fish, and eggs cost over 12 percent more 
than they did just 1 year ago. The cost 
of natural gas for home heating has 
soared by 24 percent since this time 
last year. Fuel oil has shot up almost 
47 percent. The cost of essentials has 
absolutely exploded since Washington 
Democrats took power. 
To be clear, the worst inflation in 40 
years is not something that just spon-
taneously happened to Democrats on 
their watch. As a Pew report dem-
onstrated late last year, it is true that 
countries around the world are facing 
inflation—they are—as a result of 
COVID, but America has it worse than 
almost everybody else in the developed 
world. This is a direct result of liberal 
policy choices. 
Here is how Jason Furman, President 
Obama’s CEA Chairman, explained it 
recently. I will quote from the New 
York Times: 
‘‘The United States has had much more in-
flation than almost any other advanced 
economy in the world,’’ said Jason Furman, 
an economist at Harvard University and 
former Obama administration economic ad-
viser, who used comparable methodologies to 
look across areas and concluded that U.S. 
price increases have been consistently faster. 
The difference, he said, comes because ‘‘the 
United States’ stimulus is in a category of 
its own.’’ 
Obviously, he is referring to the $2 
trillion so-called rescue package last 
year. 
The severity of this inflation was di-
rectly fueled by the reckless, far-left 
spending spree that every single Demo-
crat in this Chamber voted to ram 
through at President Biden’s behest 
last year. 
Even the most prominent liberal 
economists knew this would happen 
and tried to warn the Democrats. A 
year ago, Larry Summers warned that 
Democrats’ binge could set off ‘‘infla-
tionary pressures of a kind we have not 
seen in a generation.’’ Ah, but Demo-
crats ignored their own experts. They

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S622 
February 10, 2022 
plowed ahead, using the pandemic as a 
pretext—a pretext—to dump $2 trillion 
into left-wing policies that were over-
whelmingly 
unrelated—unrelated—to 
the healthcare fight against the virus, 
and we see the results all around us. 
Families are living with the results 
every day. 
As recently as the last few days, 
some of my Democratic colleagues 
have come here to the floor to boast 
about the increase in nominal wages. 
They want a round of applause because 
the numbers on many Americans’ pay-
checks have gone up. But that is stag-
geringly out of touch with the reality. 
Yes, in an inflationary spiral, lots of 
people will see the numbers on their 
paychecks go up. The problem is that 
even those bigger paychecks are buying 
Americans less in real terms today 
than their smaller paychecks bought 
them before Democrats were sworn in. 
It is like this: Democratic policies 
have created an inflation riptide that 
is forcing families and small businesses 
to swim as fast as they possibly can 
just to avoid getting sucked out to sea, 
but Democrats are trying to call this a 
success because of how fast everybody’s 
arms and legs are moving. Talk about 
an absurd effort to spend your way out 
of reality. The truth is plain for every-
body to see. 
A few weeks ago, the Washington 
Post ran a story with the headline 
‘‘’That raise meant nothing:’ Inflation 
is wiping out pay increases for most 
Americans.’’ The story explained, and 
this is a direct quote: 
[M]any [workers] said that despite consid-
erable pay raises—as much as 33 percent, in 
some cases—they were still struggling to 
cover basic expenses. Several workers said 
they had taken second jobs to keep up with 
rising costs for groceries, gas and rent. 
So American workers are not buying 
the Democratic spin for 1 second. One 
year after President Biden took office 
with massive economic tailwinds at his 
back, with an economy that was 
primed for a roaring comeback, 75 per-
cent of Americans say our economy is 
doing badly. About 90 percent of Amer-
icans say they are concerned with in-
flation. Ninety percent of Americans 
say they are concerned with inflation. 
A 60-percent supermajority say their 
family’s income is falling behind the 
cost of living. 
It didn’t have to be this way. This 
was a policy choice. This all-Demo-
cratic government was warned that 
their radical agenda would supercharge 
inflation, and they pushed ahead any-
way, and our country is paying the 
price. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Washington. 
NOMINATION OF MAX VEKICH 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to talk about a cou-
ple of items this morning. One is the 
nomination of Max Vekich to be Com-
missioner of the Federal Maritime 
Commission and also to talk about the 
very important issue of our colleagues 
working together on America’s innova-
tion investment for the future. But let 
me just speak first about the nomina-
tion of Max Vekich to be a Commis-
sioner of the Federal Maritime Com-
mission. 
The COVID pandemic has caused un-
precedented congestion at our ports 
and supply chain disruptions. Busi-
nesses and Americans are feeling the 
pinch of the rising prices and shortages 
of products every day. The news is that 
our colleagues can do something about 
that this morning. They can do some-
thing about that this morning. 
At a time when our country is in 
need of a strong Federal Maritime 
Commission, it is important that they 
do their oversight role—that they in-
vestigate, that they regulate unfair 
practices by foreign shipping compa-
nies and make sure U.S. shippers, our 
growers, and manufacturers get a fair 
deal. The Federal Maritime Commis-
sion is particularly important when it 
comes to ensuring that American prod-
ucts get access to markets around the 
globe. 
While I don’t agree with the conclu-
sion of the minority leader on our in-
vestment in helping Americans during 
the pandemic, I know this: Right now, 
the 
Federal 
Maritime 
Commission 
should be investigating international 
shippers who are overcharging U.S. ex-
porters. 
Farmers have been hard hit by con-
gestion and shipping challenges. U.S. 
agriculture exporters have experienced 
a 22-percent decrease in exports. Agri-
culture accounts for about one-tenth of 
America’s goods exports, and roughly 
20 percent of what U.S. farmers and 
ranchers produce is sent abroad. That 
is why they deserve a fair deal on ship-
ping prices. 
Many of these products move by con-
tainerized freight, and containerized 
freight costs have more than doubled 
since the pandemic. Washington hay 
producers estimate that the freight 
costs could be three times more expen-
sive by this winter. 
In addition to freight costs, ships are 
returning to Asia with empty con-
tainers and stranding U.S. exports at 
the docks. This is an unprecedented na-
ture of shipping and has had a major 
impact on American exporters. It is 
important that we understand that we 
need to do something about it. 
The National Milk Producers Federa-
tion estimates that shipping disruption 
cost the U.S. dairy industry nearly $1 
billion in the first half of 2021. 
Apples are Washington’s most valu-
able agricultural commodity, with $2.1 
billion in sales in 2020. About 30 per-
cent of the State’s product is exported. 
According to the Washington State 
Apple Commission, port congestion has 
producers concentrating this year more 
on North American markets as opposed 
to overseas markets, cutting into their 
profit. For every 1 million boxes of 
fresh apples shifted into the U.S. do-
mestic market, the price drops about 50 
cents per box as supply begins to over-
take demand. These losses impact real 
American jobs and the American econ-
omy. 
But let’s look at the other side of the 
equation. As Washington growers and 
American growers and American manu-
facturers struggle, foreign shipping 
companies are reporting more than $200 
billion in profits—more than double 
the profit they made over the last 20 
years combined. That is what these 
international shippers are profiting. So 
it doesn’t have anything to do with the 
fact that we helped Americans get a 
paycheck during the pandemic; it has 
to do with foreign companies that are 
overcharging U.S. producers of goods. 
At this critical time in our country, 
we need a Federal Maritime Commis-
sion to move decisively to put in place 
practices and regulations to address 
port congestion and support U.S. ex-
porters and help them not be the target 
of unfair practices such as exorbitant 
shipping costs and a lack of access to 
ships. We need a Commission that will 
take action and improve the informa-
tion flow at ports, investigate these il-
legal practices, and take enforcement 
action against foreign bad actors who 
are overcharging U.S. exporters and 
other shippers. We need a Commission 
that will stand up to foreign shipping 
interests and protect American manu-
facturers, farmers, and other exporters. 
So, yes, there is something we can do 
about our supply chain woes, particu-
larly for States that have big export 
economies. 
That is why American shippers and 
producers—‘‘American shippers’’ mean-
ing the people who are actually ship-
ping product—that is why American 
shippers and producers are behind the 
nomination of Max Vekich, because 
Mr. Vekich knows the ports, knows the 
shipping community, and has spent 
more than 40 years working on the wa-
terfront. He spent his life working in 
the maritime industry and knows the 
challenges we face in maritime, inter-
modal transportation, congestion, and 
continuing to move forward on how we 
advance our ports. 
If you have worked on the docks for 
40 years, I guarantee you, you know 
about every product, and you know 
what challenges we face from this 
international competition. 
We are on the precipice of moving 
important competitive legislation, but 
part of that competitive legislation is 
getting our products on vessels instead 
of being stranded at the docks and pre-
venting shipping companies from re-
taliating against U.S. exporters. 
Again, the majority of this product is 
moved by international shippers. It is 
an international business. So we need a 
Commission in place that is willing to 
act, a Commission that is willing to 
use their authority to enforce our cur-
rent laws and to make sure we are pro-
tecting American exporters. 
That is why exporters like the Idaho 
Dairy Association support Max Vekich, 
because they know he knows how to 
move product.

February 10, 2022 
That is why the American Associa-
tion of Port Authorities, a trade asso-
ciation representing more than 80 ports 
across the United States, supports Max 
Vekich, citing his unique leadership as 
a longtime maritime worker in the sec-
tor. 
The Pacific Northwest Waterways 
Association represents ports, tug and 
barge companies, steamship operators, 
grain elevator operators, agricultural 
producers, forest products manufactur-
ers, electric utilities, irrigation dis-
tricts, and other businesses throughout 
Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. This 
organization does not typically endorse 
candidates for these Federal offices, 
but today, they are calling for Mr. 
Vekich to be confirmed on the basis of 
his ‘‘firsthand knowledge of maritime 
industry operations.’’ 
Mr. Vekich knows what it takes to 
move product from the heartland. He 
knows that in our Washington ports, 
we are helping U.S. farmers get their 
products to market. So I know that 
whether it is wheat or soybeans or 
other ag products, he knows what it 
takes to move them and what it takes 
for us to continue to improve the effi-
ciency of our ports. Whether it is the 
Midwest manufactured products like 
cars and jeeps, he knows what that 
takes and what it takes to continue to 
grow a skilled workforce who will help 
us do that cost-effectively. He knows 
how to work with industry, like agri-
cultural producers and the waterfront 
workforce alike. 
So at a time when we are asking our 
dock workers and our longshoremen to 
work around-the-clock to help elevate 
our efficiencies and improve port con-
gestion—and, I might say, at the loss 
of life. The amount of death in the 
longshoreman community would break 
your heart. They continued to work 
during the COVID–19 crisis and lit-
erally lost their lives. This is what 
these people are doing. They are help-
ing us keep our supply chain going. So 
the least we can do is invest in some-
body who is going to help us under-
stand what it takes to do that on a 
day-to-day basis. 
We need to make sure that we have a 
competitive and fair environment for 
U.S. companies. So I ask my colleagues 
to confirm Max Vekich as Commis-
sioner of the Federal Maritime Com-
mission this morning. 
Madam President, I would ask unani-
mous consent to have printed in the 
RECORD
a list of supporters I men-
tioned. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

UNITED STATES INNOVATION AND COMPETITION 
ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
now I would like to turn our attention 
to an issue that is also dealing with our 
supply chain, and that is the issue of 
Congress moving forward on the dif-
ferences between the House and Senate 
bills on America’s investment in R&D 
and innovation. 
As the chart shows, our investment 
today equals U.S. jobs in our economy 
tomorrow. So the United States Com-
petition Act or, as we passed it here, 
the United States Innovation and Com-
petition Act is at a crossroads because 
we need to get it into conference. 
Other 
countries 
definitely 
aren’t 
waiting—I guarantee you that. They 
are making investments in innovation 
and technology. Where we are in the 
United States is we are at a 45-year low 
in the amount of investment in R&D 
against our GDP. So we are not keep-
ing pace. 
Many times I have been out on the 
floor here talking about why we are 
not keeping pace. We tried. Unfortu-
nately, we tried several years ago and 
then had an economic downturn. So ev-
erybody signed up: Let’s put more into 
R&D investment. Then we had an eco-
nomic downturn, and we never fulfilled 
that promise. So the real consequences 
of that are we are now behind in some 
very key sectors that we need to make 
investments in. 
The good news for us is that people 
are willing to make those investments, 
like the Intel company, which just de-
cided recently to make a multibillion- 
dollar investment in the State of Ohio 
to grow chip fabrication there. So we 
have opportunities if we make these in-
vestments. 
When the world presents a challenge, 
the American people, the people in our 
State—they rise to the challenge, and 
the American spirit has never ceased to 
amaze me. I guarantee, innovation is in 
the DNA of Americans. Why? Because 
we live in a country where you are free 
to do what you want. You are free to go 
and start a company and try your skill 
set. We encourage it. We need to have 
that same spirit here working collabo-
ratively to get this legislation rectified 
and onto the President’s desk. There 
isn’t a moment to wait for revolution-
izing science, creating jobs, and invig-
orating our new economic centers 
around the Nation. 
My colleague Senator WICKER and I 
worked on a very important aspect of 
the bill, which is driving more innova-
tion dollars into research institutions 
in States that haven’t traditionally 
had large research footprints. This will 
be an issue of contention, I am sure, 
with some of our colleagues, but my 
point is, innovation can happen any-
where, and innovation infrastructure 
should be everywhere. So if we want 
that to happen in Reno, NV, we need to 
make an investment in Reno, NV. I be-
lieve in that because I am pretty sure 
the Sierra company is a very big leader 
in the aerospace sector, and I think 
they are headquartered in Reno, if I am 
not mistaken. This is what I am talk-
ing about. You can build. 
Guess what. Not everything has to 
happen in Seattle or San Francisco or 
Boston or out here on the corridor here 
in Virginia. That is because the inno-
vation age means that innovation can 
happen at a very flat level. It can hap-
pen anywhere. 
So why would we constrict it? We 
don’t want to constrict it. We want to 
empower it. American leadership can’t 
wait. What we need is to be collabo-
rative here in the U.S. Senate because 
that collaboration between govern-
ment, academia, and industry is what 
drives the next level of innovation. 
Just think about what happened with 
ARPA, DARPA as we made the innova-
tions with the internet. As the Acting 
President pro tempore knows, because 
she is a programmer, that innovation 
allowed us to then build out a commer-
cial aspect of the internet that would 
not have happened, at least at that mo-
ment in time. In 1993, it wouldn’t have 
happened. Look at where we are today 
with an internet economy, all because 
we had U.S. innovation. 
So technology after technology has 
been invented, and our U.S. companies 
have continued to innovate, develop a 
workforce, and skill people for the op-
portunities of tomorrow. But that lead-
ership is not guaranteed, and time and 
time again, history has shown us that 
while we innovate here, other people 
are going to follow. 
In aviation, the Wright brothers were 
the first to demonstrate this with the 
Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, but the 
United States soon fell behind in avia-
tion as European governments invested 
and built out this new industry. By 
1913, the U.S. military had 6 planes and 
14 trained pilots. France had 216 air-
planes and 171 trained pilots. 
So leadership can’t wait. You can’t 
wait. I think people get this. We do a 
lot of the innovation, and other people 
take that innovation and implement it. 
That is why a major section of the bill 
is about translational science. It is 
about taking that innovation in the 
United States and translating it into 
faster adoption applications for indus-
tries. 
Congress finally decided to invest in 
American leadership in 1915 by creating 
the National Advisory Committee for 
Aeronautics, which worked with aca-
demia and industry to regain Amer-
ica’s dominance and find how we build 
planes that even last today. That is 
what we are talking about. That is why 
we feel that NASA is part of this bill. 
NASA is our R&D Agency for aviation. 
That is what NASA is. Yes, it deserves 
a place in this legislation. 
A new aviation industry and new 
aviation 
supply 
chains 
sprung 
up

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S624 
February 10, 2022 
across the country in places like Wich-
ita, KS, and Seattle, WA. The story 
would repeat itself after the Soviet 
Union challenged U.S. leadership in the 
1950s. Almost immediately, Congress 
recognized that leadership could not 
wait, and that is when we did NASA. 
Bringing together government, aca-
demia, and industry to create new gen-
erations of American expertise and 
technical advancements is what even-
tually put a man on the Moon and what 
will put someone—a woman this time— 
on the Moon, but America had to 
choose to lead. 
That is what we are going to be 
asked about with USICA in getting it 
done. We have to choose to lead, to in-
vest in technology. That technology 
brought us places like Huntsville, AL, 
and Houston, TX. In 2020, the aerospace 
industry supported 2 million good-pay-
ing jobs, with an average salary of over 
$100,000 per year, and generated $900 
billion in revenue. That is what the in-
novation economy did for us. 
That is why we want to now upgrade 
the innovation, particularly as it re-
lates to semiconductors. The avail-
ability of these tiny chips is one of the 
most pressing issues facing our country 
now. People can’t get access to them. 
It is so bad that, of the people who now 
have electric cars or hybrids, if you 
have a used car, you know that your 
price goes down; that it just continues 
to go down. Now used car prices are ac-
tually going up. So few cars are avail-
able that the consumers want in this 
area that, actually, used cars are get-
ting more money. Prices are going up 
and not down. 
This shortage cost the transportation 
sector $210 billion last year alone. We 
can’t wait. We can’t wait on these 
issues. We can’t wait. The essence of 
acting now—getting together, commu-
nicating with our colleagues, working 
together in a collaborative spirit—is 
what is going to get this legislation 
over the goal line and help us. 
The first transistor, as part of this 
chip industry, was invented in 1947 in 
New Jersey, representing a collabora-
tion from scientists across physics, 
electrical engineering, and chemistry, 
but in the 1980s, the U.S. semicon-
ductor industry faced a serious chal-
lenge from an ally of ours—Japan. 
Leadership did not wait. We did not 
wait. The government set up a govern-
ment-industry partnership, Semitech, 
with specific goals of creating new col-
laborations and investing in American 
manufacturing. 
The 
United 
States 
maintained that leadership role, and in 
the 1990s, we produced 37 percent of the 
global chip supply. The semiconductor 
industry now supports more than a 
million jobs because people didn’t 
stand around and wait. 
But today we see overseas competi-
tors who are investing heavily in the 
technologies of the future—everything 
from AI, to composites, to clean energy 
solutions—and they are trying to do 
everything from driving their own en-
ergy independence to combating cli-
mate change. They are investing in the 
resilience of their supply chains by pro-
moting domestic production. They are 
training their workforce. 
So the aspects of the legislation that 
we passed that help to skill and keep 
Americans working and trained for the 
workforce are very important policies. 
In fact, the administration just re-
leased yesterday another round of in-
vestment as part of what was the aero-
space and manufacturing jobs program 
that helped keep the aviation worker 
in place or actually try to recapture 
some of them who were laid off during 
the pandemic. 
It is a very important piece of legis-
lation that we have worked on that my 
colleagues over here, for the most part, 
didn’t support in the final package. 
Some of them supported it as a concept 
and as an idea but did not support the 
final package. 
Right now, it is 30 to 50 percent 
cheaper 
to 
build 
a 
semiconductor 
foundry in Asia than in the United 
States, mostly because of foreign gov-
ernment investment. Moreover, as I 
said, we are being hard hit by a semi-
conductor supply chain crisis. Car 
manufacturers, including Tesla, GM, 
and others, are removing some of their 
most advanced and desirable features 
from their cars just to reduce the num-
ber of chips that are needed. Literally, 
we are cutting our innovation skill set 
just because we don’t have the chips. 
Ford announced last week that it will 
either halt or cut production at eight 
plants. 
Are we really going to sit around and 
wait to get this legislation done? Are 
we really going to sit around and wait? 
We have eight plants that are going 
to shut down because they don’t have 
chips, and we are going to sit around 
and wait for another 3 or 4 weeks be-
fore we go to conference to resolve 
these issues. It has been projected that 
this chip shortage cost the global auto 
industry, in 2021, $210 billion in revenue 
and a loss of production of 7.7 million 
cars. So leadership can’t wait. It can’t 
wait. 
Fortunately, the United States is 
showing that we can respond, and we in 
the Senate did pass legislation. Now we 
have an opportunity to go to con-
ference and work with our colleagues, 
but some people want to wait another 
3 weeks or 4 weeks to do that. I don’t 
want to wait. I don’t want to wait an-
other second. The competitiveness of 
U.S. manufacturers that are competing 
on an international basis and that re-
ceive the investments that we make in 
technology just can’t wait. 
Recent investments from the com-
mercial sector from Intel show that 
over 10,000 new jobs will bring a domes-
tic semiconductor industry to the Mid-
west, specifically to Ohio, and our ex-
perience has shown us that, if we make 
the investments that we are talking 
about in USICA, in the competitiveness 
act, that we will grow an even larger 
U.S. 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
business. 
Yet foreign competitors are not sit-
ting still. When it comes to technology 
leadership, they are, obviously, going 
to try to do their part. So our solution 
is simple. All we have to do is work to-
gether. All we have to do is be collabo-
rative. As someone once said, collabo-
ration is the next phase of innovation. 
You can have all the science; you can 
have all the creativity, but if you can’t 
get it implemented because people 
don’t sit around the table and talk and 
innovate and work together, then you 
can’t get it implemented. 
That is where we are. We know we 
need to do this investment in R&D. We 
know that we need to invest in chips, 
and we are not doing it because some 
people don’t want to move ahead and 
get this done. 
The Senate Commerce Committee 
passed the legislation, and we, obvi-
ously, got and understood the urgency 
of it. We got and understood the ur-
gency of it. Trust me. There are many 
other things we thought we were going 
to put on our agenda. The Acting 
President pro tempore knows—because 
she sat through the hundreds of amend-
ments that were marked up—the proc-
ess that we went through, the regular 
order, the regular order that we went 
through here on the Senate floor, and 
the regular order we are willing to go 
through. So no one is asking for any-
thing else but for regular order. 
Of the people who want to hold up 
and don’t want to move forward, I 
would ask them to think about our 
competition that is working very hard 
at beating us on semiconductors and 
the issues that it represents as it re-
lates to the investments we should be 
making. 
I want us to make the investments in 
semiconductors. I want us to make the 
investments in manufacturing exten-
sion programs, in STEM education, in 
tech hubs, and in making sure that the 
United States of America maintains its 
leadership role. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S625 
February 10, 2022 
harassment has been one of my top pri-
orities here in the Senate. In fact, yes-
terday, I introduced the bipartisan Vio-
lence Against Women Act Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2022, which now has the sup-
port of 10 of my Republican colleagues. 
Today, we are here to talk about an-
other issue that is impacting too many 
in our Nation’s workforce. The Ending 
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault 
and Sexual Harassment Act of 2022 pro-
vides survivors of sexual assault and 
sexual harassment with a choice be-
tween litigation and arbitration so 
their voices will not be silenced. 
Earlier this Congress, I was glad to 
see progress in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee as they moved forward on 
this bill. The committee took action 
that I supported. They removed the 
provision 
on 
collective 
bargaining 
agreements. Just this week, I was even 
more encouraged when the House made 
further changes to the bill that im-
proved the definition of sexual harass-
ment. 
While these changes are important 
and significant, it is still not a perfect 
solution. That is why, when I sat down 
earlier this week with the majority 
leader and the lead Republican sponsor 
of this bill, my friend from South Caro-
lina, we agreed to come to the floor 
and ensure the congressional intent of 
the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sex-
ual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act of 2022 was crystal clear. 
During our meeting, my colleagues 
agreed with me that this bill should 
not be the catalyst for destroying 
predispute arbitration agreements in 
all employment matters. Specifically, 
we agreed that harassment or assault 
claims should not be joined to an em-
ployment claim without a key nexus. 
Harassment and assault allegations are 
very serious and should stand on their 
own. The language of this bill should 
be narrowly interpreted. It should not 
be used as a mechanism to move em-
ployment claims that are unrelated to 
these important issues out of the cur-
rent system. These clarifications are 
needed. 
I care very much and support sur-
vivors of sexual harassment or assault 
having access to the appropriate proc-
ess to ensure swift justice, but it is 
also very important to me that those 
claims stand separate from any other 
kind of claim. I am grateful that Sen-
ators SCHUMER and GRAHAM stand with 
me today in knowing that those claims 
are meaningfully different. 
There is one other important piece 
here that I would like to mention and 
that, I hope, my colleagues can agree 
with me on. If an employment agree-
ment contains a predispute arbitration 
clause and a sexual assault or harass-
ment claim is brought forward in con-
junction 
with 
another 
employment 
claim and the assault or harassment 
claim is later dismissed, a court should 
remand the other claim back to the ar-
bitration system under this bill. 
I think we can all agree that we want 
to ensure survivors of sexual assault 
have their voices heard. We just have 
to do this in a thorough and thoughtful 
way. 
My hope is that the legislative intent 
of this bill reflects the conversation 
with my colleagues discussed here 
today; namely, that the Ending Forced 
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sex-
ual Harassment Act of 2022 should not 
effectively destroy arbitration in em-
ployment litigation. 
This bill is narrow and scoped to ad-
dress sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment cases. These clarifications we are 
making here reflect the specific chal-
lenges that victims of these particular 
allegations face. And if any subsequent 
litigation manipulates the text to 
game the system, Senators SCHUMER 
and GRAHAM have pledged to work with 
me on a bipartisan bill to further cod-
ify the intent and language of this bill. 
I would yield to Senator GRAHAM for 
further discussion. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CARDIN). The Senator from South Caro-
lina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I say to 
the Senator, I agree with everything 
you said. You said it well. So what is 
the goal here? 
Senator GILLIBRAND and I and many 
others have been working to stop the 
practice of someone signing an employ-
ment contract, having a sexual harass-
ment or assault problem in the work-
place, and being forced into arbitration 
that 
is 
skewed 
for 
the 
employer 
against the employee for these things 
to be hidden. 
We do not intend to take unrelated 
claims out of the contract. What we 
are preventing here is sexual assault 
and sexual harassment claims being 
forced into arbitration, which perpet-
uates the problem. The light of day in 
a courtroom is what we are hoping for. 
The plaintiff still has to prove their 
case. The defendant has robust due 
process. 
But Senator ERNST’s concerns, I 
share. If lawyers try to game the sys-
tem, they are acting in bad faith. They 
could be subject to disciplinary pro-
ceedings by courts. What we are not 
going to do is take unrelated claims 
out of the arbitration contract. So if 
you have got an hour-and-wage dispute 
with the employer, you make a sexual 
harassment, sexual assault claim, the 
hour-and-wage dispute stays under ar-
bitration unless it is related. That is 
the goal. 
I hope people won’t game the system. 
I hope it will bring about the reform we 
are all hoping for: to make it harder to 
hide these problems in the workplace 
and easier to get justice without gam-
ing the system. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
body is at its best when we come to-
gether to support our most vulnerable 
neighbors. Today, and in the coming 
days, we have a chance to do just that. 
The Senate will be considering two 
pieces of legislation that will provide 
vital support to survivors of domestic 
violence and sexual assault: the VAWA 
Reauthorization Act of 2022 and the 
Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual 
Assault and Sexual Harassment Act. 
Both of these bills are the product of 
months of bipartisan negotiations. And 
they will ensure that survivors of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault can 
reach for a lifeline in a moment of cri-
sis and seek justice against their abus-
ers. 
At a time when nearly one in three 
women living today say they have ex-
perienced some form of physical or sex-
ual violence, this Senate must be 
united in standing with survivors. With 
these two pieces of legislation, we can 
prove to them and every survivor in 
America that they are not alone. 
Every day, domestic violence hot-
lines throughout the country receive 
roughly 20,000 calls from victims or 
people who are at risk of intimate part-
ner violence. That number is a sobering 
reminder that the crisis of sexual and 
domestic violence touches every com-
munity in America. 
We need to ensure that every victim, 
whether they live in a Native commu-
nity in rural Alaska or in a city like 
Chicago or Las Vegas, can reach for 
help the moment they need it. 
Mr. President, yesterday, I joined 
Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator ERNST, 
Senator MURKOWSKI—and 16 of our 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
col-
leagues—in introducing a reauthoriza-
tion of the Violence Against Women 
Act—also known as VAWA. 
Since VAWA was first enacted nearly 
30 years ago, it has transformed the 
way we address domestic and sexual vi-
olence in America. And it has helped 
save the lives of countless survivors. 
Let me tell you about one of them. 
Her name is Meaghan. Years ago, 
Meaghan was brutally assaulted by her 
ex-husband. The beating was so violent 
that she is still suffering from hearing 
loss to this day. While Meaghan was 
being attacked, her 2-and-half-year-old 
son, who is on the autism spectrum, 
ran over to help her. As he was run-
ning, the ex-husband picked up the 
child and threw him into a closet. 
Meaghan says the experience was so 
traumatizing that her son didn’t speak 
for a full year after the attack. 
When Meaghan finally broke free 
from her ex-husband, she packed her 
bags, buckled her two children into the 
car, and fled for her life. And today, 
her ex-husband is on the run with six 
open warrants for his arrest. Meaghan 
says she and her kids are constantly 
looking 
over 
their 
shoulders. 
As 
Meaghan and her family have begun to 
heal from this horrifying ordeal, she 
says they have found much-needed 
compassion and support in the detec-
tives and social workers who came to 
their aid. 
She wrote that service providers 
‘‘were patient with me and didn’t push 
me, [they] only showed me they cared, 
and most of all didn’t give up . . . with 
their support and guidance I found the 
light at the end of the tunnel and I 
fought my way out of the darkness

that my ex-husband had cast . . . on 
my life.’’ 
Meaghan’s story is just one example 
of the world of difference VAWA has 
made for victims of sexual and domes-
tic violence. In her case, VAWA pro-
vided critical resources to law enforce-
ment and social service agencies that 
helped her and her family escape a per-
ilous situation. 
And with the bill we introduced yes-
terday to update and modernize VAWA, 
we can build on that lifesaving legacy. 
To be sure, this legislation is a com-
promise. It does not include every pro-
vision I would like—nor every provi-
sion that Senators FEINSTEIN, ERNST, 
or MURKOWSKI would like. 
But it will deliver critical assistance 
to survivors across the country—in-
cluding funding for legal services, trau-
ma-informed 
law 
enforcement 
re-
sponses, and access to services for sur-
vivors who require culturally specific 
services, like LGBTQ survivors, sur-
vivors living with disabilities, sur-
vivors in rural areas, and members of 
other underserved communities. 
We have crafted a proposal that will 
save lives—and has a pathway to pas-
sage in the Senate. 
In fact, the broad, bipartisan coali-
tion in support of this effort was on 
full display yesterday, when we an-
nounced this legislation alongside sur-
vivors and advocates, district attor-
neys, the Baltimore police commis-
sioner, 
and 
actor 
and 
advocate 
Angelina Jolie. 
Let me just say: If Thena, the god-
dess of war, can’t convince 60 Senators 
to support this bill, well, I certainly 
have my work cut out as whip. 
It has been 9 years since we last reau-
thorized VAWA and 4 years since that 
reauthorization 
expired. 
Survivors 
can’t wait any longer. Let’s send this 
law to President Biden’s desk as soon 
as possible. 
Mr. President, there is more we can 
do to support survivors of sexual mis-
conduct. These acts of abuse and har-
assment leave behind scars, both visi-
ble and invisible, that can last a life-
time. Every survivor deserves the right 
to seek justice on their own terms. 
That is why, this morning, the Sen-
ate will vote to enact the Ending 
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault 
and Sexual Harassment Act. It was in-
troduced in the House by my friend and 
Illinois colleague Representative CHERI 
BUSTOS and was passed in that Cham-
ber on Monday with a resounding, bi-
partisan vote of 335–97. 
The members of this Senate will join 
the House in passing this legislation on 
a bipartisan basis. This bill was intro-
duced last year by Senators GILLI-
BRAND, GRAHAM, and myself. 
The premise of this legislation is 
simple: Survivors of sexual assault or 
harassment deserve their day in court. 
They should be able to choose whether 
to bring a case forward, instead of 
being forced into a secret arbitration 
proceeding where the deck is stacked 
against them. 
It has become increasingly clear that 
forced arbitration clauses have enabled 
sexual abusers to escape scrutiny while 
their victims are compelled to stay si-
lent. That is wrong. 
Survivors 
deserve 
accountability. 
And that is exactly what this law will 
deliver. 
Far too many survivors have been 
locked out of the court system because 
of a forced arbitration clause buried in 
the fine print of a contract they signed. 
Consider the case of Lilly Silbert. 
She had a monthly membership to a 
therapeutic massage company, ‘‘Mas-
sage Envy.’’ And one day, she was sexu-
ally assaulted by a massage therapist. 
Afterwards, Lilly tried to cancel her 
membership. To do so, she had to 
download the company’s app and agree 
to its terms and conditions. But there 
was a detail buried deep within those 
terms and conditions: a forced arbitra-
tion clause. Lilly didn’t even know it 
was there. 
So when she tried to file a lawsuit 
against the company, they responded 
by trying to force her into a secret ar-
bitration proceeding rather than let 
her get her day in court. 
Even national figures have been 
trapped by forced arbitration clauses, 
people like Gretchen Carlson, a jour-
nalist and FOX News anchor who has 
been a champion in bringing this issue 
to light. 
You may remember that Ms. Carlson 
brought a sexual harassment case 
against her former boss, Roger Ailes. 
He responded by invoking a forced arbi-
tration clause in her employment 
agreement. 
Forced arbitration clauses not only 
deny survivors their right to a day in 
court, they also conceal their allega-
tions from public view. That is a green 
light for abusers to continue harming 
and harassing victims. 
Hidden in fine print, these agree-
ments silence survivors and enable 
abusers. We must end this injustice. 
The bill we will pass today will en-
sure that every survivor has the choice 
to go to court. It will not change the 
law around what constitutes sexual 
harassment or assault. 
But it will give survivors a choice of 
whether or not to bring a claim in 
court after the sexual assault or har-
assment claim has arisen, notwith-
standing the presence of a forced arbi-
tration clause. 
There are a few other points about 
the bill that I want to emphasize. 
The Senator from Iowa discussed her 
concerns about the bill being used to 
move claims that are ‘‘unrelated’’ to 
allegations of sexual harassment or 
sexual assault. 
The bill is clear on this point. Under 
the bill, if the survivor so chooses, no 
predispute arbitration agreement shall 
be valid or enforceable ‘‘with respect to 
a case which is filed under federal, trib-
al or state law and relates to the sex-
ual assault dispute or the sexual har-
assment dispute.’’ That resolves the 
Senator’s concern. 
I do want to clarify, though, that the 
bill text does not require any court to 
adopt new dismissal mechanisms for 
survivors’ claims. Current State or 
Federal law governs how and when a 
case moves forward, and the bill does 
not create any new mechanism to 
allow for dismissal, nor does it require 
that victims have to prove a sexual as-
sault or harassment claim before the 
rest of their related case can proceed in 
court. 
Furthermore, the bill should not be 
interpreted to require that if a sexual 
assault or harassment claim is brought 
forward in conjunction with another 
related claim and the assault or har-
assment claim is later dismissed, the 
court must remand the other claim 
back to forced arbitration. That is not 
what the bill requires. 
There is nothing in the bill directing 
courts to dismiss related claims and 
compel them to forced arbitration if a 
victim ultimately does not prevail on 
her 
sexual 
assault 
or 
harassment 
claim. 
If there were such a requirement, it 
would have the undesirable effect of 
hiding corporate behavior such as re-
taliation and discrimination against 
women who report assaults and harass-
ment. 
Take the real-world example of Ms. 
Taylor Gilbert. In 2015, at age 22, she 
had just started working for a company 
called Indeed, Inc. While at a company 
training at a hotel, she was assaulted 
and raped by a company manager. 
Fearing she would lose her job, she did 
not initially report the assault to the 
company, but after repeated further 
sexual harassment from colleagues, she 
filed complaints with the company and 
told her supervisor what happened. 
The company took no action, and Ms. 
Gilbert claimed she faced retaliation 
for having reported her complaints, in-
cluding being bypassed for promotions 
and raises. Ms. Gilbert tried to bring a 
case in court against the manager who 
raped her and against the company— 
not just for the rape and harassment, 
but also for the retaliation that ad-
versely affected her career path. But 
there was a forced arbitration clause in 
her employment contract, and her case 
was sent to forced arbitration. 
Under this bill, that would change. 
Her case and all of its claims were re-
lated to the assault and harassment. 
Under this bill, the survivor would get 
the choice to bring that case in court, 
and the bill does not require dismissal 
of some claims in the case if other 
claims are not ultimately proven. 
In Ms. Gilbert’s case, it was essential 
that the company’s conduct in ena-
bling the abuse and harassment and 
also retaliating against her be brought 
to light, not covered up by being sepa-
rated and forced into arbitration. 
So to clarify, for cases which involve 
conduct that is related to a sexual har-
assment dispute or sexual assault dis-
pute, survivors should be allowed to 
proceed with their full case in court re-
gardless of which claims are ultimately

proven. I am glad that is what this bill 
provides. 
With this bill becoming law, sur-
vivors like Lilly Silbert, Gretchen 
Carlson, and Taylor Gilbert will finally 
have the right to make their case in 
court. And it will prevent abusers— 
along with those who enable them— 
from hiding behind a veil of secrecy. 
I want to thank my colleague, Con-
gresswoman CHERI BUSTOS, once again 
for her leadership on this proposal in 
the House. And I want to thank Sen-
ator GILLIBRAND for her leadership as 
well—and for all the work she does to 
support survivors. 
Senator GRAHAM has also been a vital 
partner in this effort; he held a hearing 
on this legislation when he served as 
chair of the Judiciary Committee. And 
he has been a great partner in getting 
it across the finish line. 
Finally, I want to thank the mem-
bers of our staffs who have worked day 
and night on this legislation—in par-
ticular: Alexandra Lowe-Server on Sen-
ator 
GILLIBRAND’s 
staff, 
Katherine 
Nikas on Senator GRAHAM’s staff, and 
most of all Shanna Winters on my Ju-
diciary 
Committee 
staff, 
who 
has 
worked tirelessly on this effort. 
Today will be an historic day in the 
U.S. Senate. With the Ending Forced 
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sex-
ual Harassment Act, the rights of 
every survivor will be protected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
just want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ator GRAHAM and Senator ERNST for 
their outstanding work in this regard. 
We have worked over many years to 
get a bill that can be agreed upon. Sen-
ator ERNST made sure that her con-
cerns were met in several ways. But I 
agree with both of their statements. I 
do not believe that survivors of sexual 
assault and harassment will abuse the 
ability to file cases in court. 
The bill plainly reads, which is very 
relevant to Senator ERNST’s concerns, 
that only disputes that relate to sexual 
assault or harassment conduct can es-
cape the forced arbitration clauses. 
‘‘That relate to’’ is in the text. The 
language of the bill specifically states 
that ‘‘the term ‘sexual harassment dis-
pute’ means a dispute relating to con-
duct that is alleged to constitute sex-
ual harassment under applicable Fed-
eral, Tribal, or State law,’’ and ‘‘the 
term ‘sexual assault dispute’ means a 
dispute involving a nonconsensual sex-
ual act or sexual conduct.’’ 
To be clear, there are no new legal 
burdens to sexual harassment estab-
lished in the bill. This was another 
concern that Senator ERNST had. It is 
all tied to existing Federal, State, and 
Tribal law. 
This bill will basically give survivors 
the ability to go to court where they 
are ‘‘alleging conduct constituting a 
sexual harassment dispute or a sexual 
assault dispute.’’ When a sexual assault 
or sexual harassment survivor files a 
court case in order to seek account-
ability, her single case may include 
multiple claims. But as Senator ERNST 
said, if those claims on harassment or 
assault are dismissed, then she would 
go back to the arbitration process. 
But it is—and this is important to 
Senator GRAHAM and I—it is essential 
that all the claims related to the sex-
ual assault or harassment can be adju-
dicated at one time for the specific 
purpose that Senator ERNST
is well 
aware of. We don’t want to have to 
make a sexual assault or harassment 
victim relive that experience in mul-
tiple jurisdictions. So we want to be 
able to deal with all the harassment- 
and assault-related claims in one goal. 
But, again, if those aren’t part of it, 
then this bill does not apply to it. 
So you are quite right in your clari-
fication, and that is exactly what we 
intended the bill to do. 
Every State and Federal court in the 
country requires a person to allege cer-
tain things in a certain way in order to 
properly plead a case such that it won’t 
be 
immediately 
dismissed. 
Victims 
here must follow the rules and plead a 
case correctly, and then they must also 
affirm to the Court that they have a 
good-faith basis for doing so. Attorneys 
must do the same thing. 
If victims and attorneys break those 
rules, they can be sanctioned in court, 
as Senator GRAHAM mentioned. To en-
sure that a victim is able to realize the 
rights and protections intended to be 
restored to her by this legislation, all 
of the related claims will proceed to-
gether. 
I yield back to my colleagues. 
Can I just read my full statement 
now? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Sure, please. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Do you have 
more to say, Senator ERNST? 
Ms. ERNST. I am good. 
I will yield the floor but want to 
thank my colleagues. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
just want to, for the record, talk about 
this legislation and how important it 
is. 
I am extremely grateful for the work 
of Senator GRAHAM
over the last 5 
years in writing this bill. And I am 
very grateful to the majority leader for 
meeting with Senator ERNST and Sen-
ator GRAHAM yesterday to make the 
final decisions on this bill and to close 
the deal. 
Senator SCHUMER is one of the great-
est listeners and has the ability to 
bring legislation to fruition, and that 
is exactly what he did yesterday. And I 
am very grateful. 
This bill represents one of the most 
significant workplace reforms in Amer-
ican history. It will help us fix a bro-
ken system that protects perpetrators 
and corporations and end the days of 
silencing survivors. 
Too often, when survivors of sexual 
assault or harassment in the workplace 
come forward, they are told they are 
legally forbidden to sue their employer 
because somewhere buried in their em-
ployment contract was a forced arbi-
tration clause, often accompanied by a 
nondisclosure agreement. 
Instead of being allowed their day in 
court, these survivors are pushed into a 
system designed by the same corpora-
tion that they are challenging. They 
are blocked from seeking information 
that could prove their case, and they 
are left in the hands of an extrajudicial 
arbitrator who is typically selected by 
their employer and is not always a 
trained lawyer. 
The arbitration process not only al-
lows the corporations to hide sexual 
harassment and assault cases in this 
secretive and often biased process, but 
it shields those who have committed 
serious misconduct from the public 
eye. Across the board, employees are 
less likely to win an arbitration than 
they are in court. Even when they do 
win, they typically receive much lower 
monetary awards. And because the re-
sults of arbitration are secret and bind-
ing, there is no chance for an appeal, 
and repeat offenders are often not held 
to account. 
Estimates suggest that more than 60 
million Americans are subject to arbi-
tration clauses. Many don’t even know 
it because the clauses are hidden in the 
fine print. Forced arbitration clauses 
are especially common in female-domi-
nated industries. 
The ACLU has reported that 57.6 per-
cent of female workers are subject to 
this practice. It is also especially prev-
alent in low-wage fields and industries 
with disproportionately high numbers 
of women of color. These clauses leave 
those women who often cannot afford 
to challenge their employers without 
recourse. But this affects women in 
every industry. 
A 2018 analysis of sexual harassment 
claims made on Wall Street found that 
in 30 years, just 17 women—30 years, 
just 17 women—won their claims before 
Wall Street’s oversight body, and most 
cases were dismissed or denied. 
I want to share the stories of two sur-
vivors to illustrate how broken the sys-
tem is. 
First is Lora Henry, who worked at a 
Kia dealership in Ohio where her boss 
sexually harassed her, touching her in-
appropriately, making inappropriate 
comments, bringing her inappropriate 
gifts. When she reported him, the com-
pany did a sham investigation and 
forced her into arbitration. She was 
only able to share her story because 
Congress issued her a subpoena. She 
should not have needed the protection 
of a congressional subpoena to speak 
out. She testified, ‘‘The cycle of har-
assment will continue if you force 
women to be quiet and allow sexual 
harassers and the companies that allow 
them to hide behind arbitration agree-
ments.’’ 
The second story is about Andowah 
Newton, who was working for the vice 
president of legal affairs at the luxury 
goods company LVMH Moet Hennessy 
Louis Vuitton, Inc., in New York, when 
she reported being sexually harassed 
and assaulted by a colleague. Even

February 10, 2022 
though she filed her sexual harassment 
case in a New York State court, the 
company moved to compel forced arbi-
tration on the grounds that Federal 
law supersedes New York State law 
that attempts to protect victims of 
harassment from being forced into ar-
bitration. She said: 
Because of forced arbitration and [con-
fidentiality agreements], I may never know 
the extent to which [this perpetrator] sexu-
ally assaulted or harassed others, [and] if 
LVMH retaliated against others as they did 
me. . . . His sexual harassment, attempted 
assault, and assault made me feel scared, de-
meaned, and ashamed. I found myself con-
stantly 
agitated, 
distressed, 
and 
hypervigilant, preoccupied with avoiding the 
trauma of encountering him. 
Even with her legal expertise and ex-
perience as vice president of legal af-
fairs, she was powerless in this system. 
She said the company convinced her 
‘‘that . . . harassment was just a by-
product of being an attractive woman 
who works at a company with a French 
culture.’’ That is the same company 
running the arbitration process. That 
is why this bill fixes the problem. 
Survivors deserve a real chance at 
justice, and that is what this bill does. 
This bipartisan, bicameral bill would 
amend the Federal Arbitration Act to 
void all forced arbitration provisions 
for sexual assault and harassment sur-
vivors. 
Removing 
those 
provisions 
would give survivors their day in court, 
allow them to discuss their case pub-
licly, and end the days of institutional 
protection of harassers. 
This legislation passed with bipar-
tisan, broad support in the House, and 
I hope my colleagues will join us in 
supporting this critical workplace re-
form in the Senate. 
Again, I thank Senator SCHUMER and 
Senator GRAHAM. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me compliment my colleague from 
New York. Her persistence, her intel-
ligence, her determination and passion 
to change the law so these injustices, 
which occur so many times that we 
don’t know about, will no longer be 
there is so vital. 
So thank you for a job well done. 
Thanks to my colleague Senator 
GRAHAM, the lead Republican sponsor, 
who, when he gets behind something, it 
gets done. So I want him behind more 
things with us in the future. 
And to Senator ERNST, who is not 
here, she has been a great leader on 
this as well. And when we met in my 
office with Senator GRAHAM, Senator 
ERNST was very amenable to getting 
this done. 
It is an outrage, just an outrage, that 
women and men who are abused cannot 
seek justice, are forced to be quiet, are 
forced to keep the agony inside them-
selves. It is outrageous. 
For decades, this forced arbitration 
has just deprived millions of people, al-
most all women, from basic rights to 
justice. We need justice in so many 
areas, but when you can’t seek justice 
when you are harassed, it is just one of 
the greatest marks of injustice, one of 
the greatest times of injustice. 
The good news about this legislation 
is all the clauses that people already 
signed in their employment contracts, 
even when they didn’t know about it, 
will no longer be valid. So it not only 
affects the future but affects those who 
signed in the past. 
If you could ever say that any legis-
lation is long overdue, this is it. It is 
time for a change. And moments from 
now, the Senate will finally act to 
make forced arbitration for sexual har-
assment and assault a thing of the 
past. 
We are now going to voice vote this 
wonderful, needed legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I will be real quick. 
Senator SCHUMER, thank you for 
making this happen. You made sure it 
would come up today, we would get a 
voice vote. 
Senator ERNST has been great. 
Kirsten, it has been a hell of a ride. 
We talked to Microsoft about 3 or 4 
years ago about this. They jumped on-
board and started changing it inter-
nally. 
I have heard from the Chamber. I am 
open-minded about making sure we 
don’t hurt business. It does not hurt 
business to make sure that people who 
are harassed in the workplace get 
treated fairly. It is better for business. 
I just want to say, this shows that we 
can function up here, that we are lis-
tening to the world as it is. So the days 
of taking sexual harassment and sexual 
assault claims and burying them in the 
basement of arbitration are over. 
Arbitration has its place between 
business. It can be a good thing. But 
when you sign a document—multiple 
pages—just to get a job, you really 
don’t know what you are signing. We 
are saying, you are not going to sign 
away your life in terms of having your 
day in court if somebody treats you 
poorly. You still have got to prove 
your case. The defendant has robust 
due process rights, which they should, 
but the abuse of arbitration that per-
petuates sexual harassment and sexual 
assault in the workplace is soon to be 
done away with. 
Thank you, Senator SCHUMER. 
Thank you, Senator GILLIBRAND. 
And to all of my colleagues on the 
Republican side, thank you. 
This is not bad for business. This is 
good for America.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Max Vekich, of Washington, 
to be a Federal Maritime Commis-
sioner for a term expiring June 30, 2026. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to support 
three extraordinarily qualified Depart-
ment of Defense nominees: Melissa 
Dalton, to be Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Homeland Defense and 
Hemispheric Affairs; Dr. David Honey, 
to be Deputy Under Secretary of De-
fense for Research and Engineering; 
and Dr. Celeste Wallander, to be Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Inter-
national Security Affairs. 
These three individuals have been 
nominated to serve in critical national 
security positions, and they are tasked 
with confronting those challenges of 
national security and securing U.S. in-
terests at home and abroad. 
As a senior member of the Armed 
Services Committee, I attended the 
committee nomination hearings for all 
three nominees, and I came away con-
vinced that all three were qualified for 
their positions and deserving of swift 
confirmation. 
Melissa Dalton previously served as a 
career civil servant in various posi-
tions at the Department of Defense— 
for a decade—under both President 
Bush and President Obama. So she had 
bipartisan support, clearly, in that po-
sition. She also was a senior fellow and 
director at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies. 
If confirmed, one of Ms. Dalton’s core 
responsibilities as Assistant Secretary 
for Homeland Defense would be over-
seeing the Department’s ability to op-
erate through impacts to critical infra-
structure, an area in which we have in-
creasingly seen our adversaries are try-
ing to exploit, particularly through 
cyber attacks. As Ms. Dalton has said, 
the resilience of our capabilities and 
infrastructure at home strengthens de-
terrence of aggression abroad, and DOD 
must be able to demonstrate its resil-
ience. 
The recent news of increased threats 
from Russia’s cyber attacks, associated 
with their unprecedented troop buildup 
near Ukraine, underscores the need for 
this position to be filled as quickly as 
possible. 
I also want to express my support for 
Dr. David Honey, who has dedicated a 
lifetime of service to the defense of 
this country. Dr. Honey has served in 
various research and development posi-
tions at the Department of Defense, in-
cluding roles at the Defense Advanced

Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, 
which is so important to our innova-
tion. He has also served on the Air 
Force Scientific Advisory Board and as 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Research. 
Today, more than ever, we need tal-
ented, qualified individuals like Dr. 
Honey at the forefront of DOD’s inno-
vation and technological efforts. Seem-
ingly every few weeks we hear in the 
press about shocking technological 
breakthroughs made by the Chinese 
military that raise concerns about 
eroding our technological advantage. 
Former Vice Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, General Hyten, de-
scribed the Chinese test of a fractional 
orbital bombardment system last sum-
mer as ‘‘stunning.’’ 
Our 
technological 
advantage 
has 
been a foundational part of deterrence 
for decades, and if lost it would be 
enormously destabilizing for global se-
curity. But if we are truly committed 
to preserving our defense technological 
superiority, it is vital that we confirm 
Dr. Honey as quickly as possible. 
Finally, I want to speak to support 
Dr. Celeste Wallander, who is the nomi-
nee to serve as Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for International Security Af-
fairs. And as part of that role, she is re-
sponsible for defense policy toward Eu-
rope, NATO, the Middle East, and Afri-
ca—all places right now which are hot-
beds of potential conflict. 
In light of the ongoing and unprece-
dented Russian threat to post-Cold War 
European stability and Ukrainian sov-
ereignty, Dr. Wallander’s nomination 
comes at a particularly critical time. 
Dr. Wallander has demonstrated a his-
tory of expertise on Russia. As former 
President of the U.S.-Russia Founda-
tion, top Russia expert on the National 
Security Council, and former Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rus-
sia, 
Ukraine, 
and 
Eurasia, 
Dr. 
Wallander is highly respected on both 
sides of the aisle. 
With a bipartisan delegation, I trav-
eled to Ukraine several weeks ago. We 
met 
with 
Ukrainian 
President 
Zelenskyy and his national security 
team to discuss the Russian threat and 
how we can do everything possible to 
help our Ukrainian friends. You can’t 
turn on the radio, read a paper, or 
watch the news at night without seeing 
the Russian troops that are massed on 
Ukraine’s border. 
The message from the Ukrainians 
was clear when we met with them. 
They see their future in partnership 
with the West. They share our demo-
cratic values, and the people are proud 
of their hard-won independence. 
And every step that Putin takes to-
ward escalating the situation at the 
border is a step closer to threatening 
not only Ukraine’s future but the lib-
eral democratic system that he fears 
and that we all have benefited from. 
I can think of no one more qualified 
for this position at DOD at this time of 
immense 
instability 
than 
Dr. 
Wallander. 
So, for these reasons, I believe we 
must move to confirm these three 
nominees as quickly as possible so they 
can fulfill the duties of these crucial 
positions that are so vital to our na-
tional security. 
So with that, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of the fol-
lowing nominations en bloc: Calendar 
Nos. 476, 692, and 694; that the Senate 
vote on the nominations en bloc with-
out intervening action or debate; that 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate; that 
any statements related to the nomina-
tions be printed in the RECORD; that 
the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, here we are 6 
months since the last foreign policy 
disaster into which this administration 
led this country, the disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan: 13 service-
members killed, including 1 from my 
home State of Missouri; dozens more 
wounded; hundreds—hundreds—of civil-
ians killed; hundreds more, maybe 
thousands, of American civilians left 
behind enemy lines to terrorists, to 
fend for themselves; still hundreds of 
Americans stranded there in Afghani-
stan as we speak. 
And what accountability has there 
been in this time? Who has been re-
lieved of duty? Who has been shown the 
door? What have we learned? 
The answer is there has been no ac-
countability. No one has been relieved 
of duty. No one has been shown the 
door. 
And now this administration has 
bumbled to the brink of another for-
eign policy crisis that they have helped 
create, having denied Ukraine military 
aid, lethal aid, when it asked for it last 
spring; having stuffed dollars in Vladi-
mir Putin’s pockets by greenlighting 
the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline. And 
now here they are, on the verge of an-
other foreign policy crisis, and still we 
have no answers, still we have no ac-
countability. 
I will say this, though. We did learn 
a few interesting details this week 
about what happened in Afghanistan. 
And by the way, if you think that 
Vladimir Putin and the other dictators 
around this world weren’t emboldened 
by this administration’s weakness, by 
their utter failure in Afghanistan, then 
you have got another thing coming. 
But what have we learned this week 
about Afghanistan? What have we 
learned? Actually, a couple of inter-
esting things, a number of interesting 
things. We learned that, in fact, the 
White House and the State Department 
were warned for months on end— 
months on end—that their failure to 
evacuate civilians would result in dis-
aster; that the Afghan Government was 
on the verge of collapse. They were 
told over and over. 
One servicemember who was in Kabul 
told investigators ‘‘the writing was on 
the wall. The country and its govern-
ment were actively collapsing,’’ and 
‘‘we should not have waited [to start 
evacuations] until every provincial 
capital had fallen except for Kabul.’’ 
Yet that is exactly what the adminis-
tration did. Our top military com-
mander in Kabul tried to get the Am-
bassador on the ground to see the secu-
rity threat for what it was but to no 
avail. As one military official told in-
vestigators—we learned this week— 
‘‘The Embassy needed to position for 
withdrawal.’’ Yet they weren’t doing it. 
Why weren’t they doing it? Why 
weren’t civilians evacuated in a timely 
manner? Why wasn’t the White House 
prepared? Because the White House 
wasn’t taking it seriously. 
According to Marine Corps Brig. Gen. 
Farrell Sullivan, as late as August 6, 
‘‘the National Security Council was 
not seriously planning for an evacu-
ation.’’ Mind you, by this point, our 
military presence is gone. We have 
withdrawn militarily from the country. 
Here we are in August, and the Na-
tional Security Council—the White 
House—was not seriously planning for 
an evacuation. 
The State Department hadn’t even 
put a team together that was respon-
sible for informing individuals, includ-
ing American citizens, that they were 
eligible for evacuation or started col-
lecting the information they would 
need to put those Americans on flights 
to safety. 
And it wasn’t as if the White House 
and the State Department didn’t know 
better. Our top military commander on 
the ground in Afghanistan warned as 
early as March—as early as March, he 
has testified—that he said the security 
situation in Afghanistan was dire and 
collapse could come quickly; when the 
United States withdrew, collapse could 
come quickly. He said it in March. By 
July, our troops were gone. In August, 
the administration still hadn’t started 
planning. 
Here is what the top commander in 
Kabul said. He said: 
I think we could have been much better 
prepared to conduct a more orderly [civilian 
evacuation]— 
That is what a NEO is— 
if policy makers had paid attention to the 
indicators of what was happening on the 
ground, and the time lines associated with 
the Taliban advance, and the Taliban intent 
to conduct a military takeover. 
That is what we learned this week: 
that the White House was told over and 
over and over again and did nothing; in 
fact—worse than that—rejected the 
counsel of military commanders on the 
ground, saying that the situation was 
urgent, saying that civilians needed to 
be evacuated, saying that there needed 
to be other steps taken, new measures 
taken. And the White House drug their 
feet, did nothing. 
So what was the consequence of that? 
Well, we also learned this week that 
the consequence was a rapid, chaotic

rush for the exits once the White House 
suddenly and belatedly realized they 
had bumbled into a crisis—once they 
realized that they had left American 
civilians with nowhere to go, once they 
realized that they had a collapse on 
their hands that they had not planned 
for, despite being warned repeatedly. 
As the CENTCOM found—Central 
Command found—and we learned this 
week, 
‘‘Commanders 
at 
each 
gate 
[around the airport] exercised author-
ity to open or close their respective 
gates, as they deemed appropriate, ac-
cording to the situation on the ground. 
. . . However, there was tremendous 
pressure from the strategic level,’’ 
meaning the Combatant Command, the 
Joint Staff, and, yes, the White House, 
‘‘to continue to process and evacuate 
civilians to the maximum extent pos-
sible, so gate closures were done rarely, 
locally, and temporarily.’’ 
In other words, it was a rush—a mad 
rush—to the exits once the administra-
tion realized that, in fact, the govern-
ment was collapsing; realized they 
hadn’t done the preparation they need-
ed to do; realized that hundreds, if not 
thousands, of American civilians were 
in grave danger. 
And we know the result of that. The 
result 
is 
13 
servicemembers 
were 
killed, 
hundreds 
of 
civilians 
were 
killed, and hundreds of Americans— 
maybe more—were left behind to the 
enemy. 
Now, I said we learned all this this 
week. You might wonder, well, where 
did we learn it? I mean, maybe at least 
we are making some progress. We are 
getting 
some 
accountability. 
We 
learned something. 
Did we learn it in an oversight hear-
ing before this body? Did we learn it in 
sworn testimony given in public on the 
evacuation of Afghanistan? No, no. Oh, 
no. We learned it from a press report. 
We learned it because the Washington 
Post obtained what were previously 
confidential, 
unpublished, 
nonpublic 
reports from within the military—from 
within 
Central 
Command 
in 
par-
ticular—and the Washington Post pub-
lished them. 
In what has become an all-too-typ-
ical scenario, we learned nothing from 
any hearings this body is doing because 
they aren’t doing any in public. What 
we have learned is entirely from leaked 
reports, secondhand sources—the pub-
lic having been shut out, having been 
denied access. 
You know, we had multiple hearings, 
actually—or briefings—on Afghanistan 
and the security situations in Ukraine 
last week. Did that happen in public? 
No. Was there testimony taken in pub-
lic? No. Were there questions asked by 
Senators in public? No. 
I am willing to come to this floor as 
long as it takes and insist on regular 
order as long as it takes until there is 
accountability for what this adminis-
tration has done in Afghanistan and 
now what it is bumbling towards in 
Ukraine. We have got to get answers. 
Why is it that commanders on the 
ground warn over and over that dis-
aster is imminent and the White House 
does nothing? Why is it that the White 
House and the State Department de-
nied a request for a civilian evacu-
ation? Why is it that we are still here 
all these months later, and the only 
answers we can get are from leaked re-
ports in the press? Why has not this 
body done its job to conduct rigorous 
and serious oversight hearings in pub-
lic for the American people to see? 
I will come to this floor and insist on 
regular order, insist that this body do 
its job and vote on Defense Department 
nominees until we get accountability, 
until there are public hearings, and 
until we can learn what actually hap-
pened in Afghanistan and who is re-
sponsible. 
I will tell you this: I wasn’t alive for 
Vietnam, but I am not willing to par-
ticipate in the kind of coverup that 
happened for years in the Vietnam war. 
I am not willing to kick this oversight 
responsibility off to some Commission 
that won’t report for years from now 
most of its findings, probably in a clas-
sified annex. And by that point, some-
body will say: Oh, well, it is just too 
late to do anything about it. 
The American public was lied to for 
years on the Vietnam war. It has been 
lied to for years on Afghanistan. It is 
time to get answers. So, yes, I will be 
here insisting on those answers, insist-
ing on oversight, and insisting on ac-
countability until we get it. Until that 
time, it is not too much to ask the 
Senate to do its job. 
I believe the majority leader said 
just the other day that the Senate is 
here to vote; that is what the Senate is 
here to do. Well, that is an apt phrase, 
and for once, I agree very much with 
the Senate majority leader. 
For those reasons, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate my colleague’s grandstanding 
on Afghanistan when he knows that in 
the NDAA, we passed a provision to 
create a Commission to look at Af-
ghanistan. And I want those answers 
just as much as he does. I stood up and 
said, when the President announced 
the withdrawal, that I didn’t support 
that withdrawal. 
But that is beside the point that we 
are dealing with now because what we 
are dealing with now and what my col-
league from Missouri is doing is mak-
ing us less secure because he is holding 
nominees—he is complaining about the 
problems 
we 
have 
in 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine, and he is making it worse be-
cause he is not willing to allow those 
nominees who can help with that prob-
lem to go forward. 
He is absolutely incorrect about Nord 
Stream 2. I opposed Nord Stream 2. I 
authored the legislation with Senator 
CRUZ to sanction Nord Stream 2. For 
the 4 years that the previous President 
was in office, they didn’t take any ac-
tion to sanction Nord Stream 2 until 
the day Donald Trump left office. 
The fact is, that pipeline is not oper-
ating now because it hasn’t been cer-
tified, and so Russia is not making any 
money from the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line. So he needs to get his facts cor-
rect. 
He sits on the Armed Services Com-
mittee with me, where he has access to 
the same information about our press-
ing national security challenges. Yet 
he is holding up these nominees. He is 
disregarding the threats that we face 
because he would rather stand here and 
grandstand on Afghanistan. Well, we do 
need to get answers, and I am willing 
to work with him on that, but this is 
not the way to do it. 
So 
let’s 
remember 
that 
Senator 
HAWLEY declared China as the biggest 
threat to American security, and that 
is a quote. Yet he is blocking the con-
firmation of Dr. Honey, whose job 
would be to ensure that our defense re-
search and development efforts are 
continuing on par with China’s. So if 
his goal is to ensure that China’s tech-
nological capabilities surpass ours, I 
can think of no better way to do that 
than to refuse to confirm Dr. Honey. 
On Russia, my colleague has claimed 
that the Biden administration has cod-
dled Russia. We heard him say it just 
now—that they failed to aid Ukraine. 
But in a recent op-ed, my colleague 
made his views clear on the current 
Russian-created crisis. In it, he sug-
gests that the United States is better 
off closing NATO’s doors to Ukraine 
and stating that our Nation’s history 
of promoting and defending liberal 
democratic values across the globe has 
been a failure. Well, I am not going to 
agree to that. 
We have an international order that 
developed after World War II that has 
had as a large part the containment 
first of the Soviet Union through 
NATO and now of Russia. Part of that 
world order says that a sovereign na-
tion should be able to help determine 
their own future. 
So I am not going to be part of some 
agreement that says we are going to 
turn our backs on NATO, we are going 
to turn our backs on Ukraine, and we 
are going to say to Russia: You go 
ahead; you go into Ukraine. 
He argues that we should reduce our 
commitments to places like Europe be-
cause, he claims, Russia poses a great-
er threat to our European allies than 
to the United States. Well, the last 
time I looked, when the United States 
got attacked in 2001—and maybe he 
doesn’t remember 9/11 because he was 
too young—the countries that came to 
our aid were our NATO allies. 
So, with all due respect, I find my 
colleague’s assessment both disturbing 
and shockingly uninformed. As mem-
bers of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, my colleague and I have 
been briefed on the multitude of evi-
dence of Russia’s attempts to subvert 
democratic 
institutions—including 
right here in the United States, by the 
way—to attack our own infrastructure, 
and to compromise the sovereignty of 
our allies around the globe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S631 
February 10, 2022 
In 2018, Russian private military con-
tractor forces even assaulted an out-
post of Americans in Syria. They were 
forced to defend themselves, and, of 
course, they did, and they ultimately 
routed the Russian force. 
So my colleague’s stated sentiments 
do just what Vladimir Putin wants. He 
wants to divide the United States from 
our NATO allies and other democ-
racies. He wants to diminish U.S. pres-
ence in Europe and to rewrite the Eu-
ropean security order in a way that fa-
vors his authoritarian interests. We 
simply cannot allow that to happen. 
I could not disagree with my col-
league any more on how he has chosen 
to associate himself. Continuing to 
block qualified leaders such as Dr. 
Wallander, Dr. Honey, and Ms. Dalton 
does not make us stronger, it does not 
contribute to productive discourse over 
our national priorities, and it doesn’t 
accomplish what he is trying to accom-
plish. 
If what he wants is answers on Af-
ghanistan, then work with us. Let’s 
work together. Let’s make this Com-
mission that we passed in the NDAA— 
let’s make it work. What he wants 
casts us an unreliable partner to our 
allies, and it forces the Department of 
Defense to operate with one hand tied 
behind their back. 
So I am disappointed to hear my col-
league—and he talks about regular 
order. Well, in the last 24 hours, we 
have confirmed three nominees by reg-
ular order. We held up the Senate to 
get cloture votes. Then we passed Alex-
andra Baker, the Deputy Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy, 75 to 21. 
We passed Douglas Bush, Assistant 
Secretary of the Army, 95 to 2. I don’t 
know if Senator HAWLEY was one of 
those two. I assume he was. We passed 
Patrick Coffey, general counsel for the 
Navy, 79 to 17. Then on February 2, by 
unanimous consent, we passed Gabriel 
Camarillo, Under Secretary of the 
Army, and Andrew Hunter, Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force, by unani-
mous consent. 
So this is not about regular order; 
this is about trying to use the Senate 
process for his own personal ambitions, 
and that is unfortunate. It is unfortu-
nate because it doesn’t get us the indi-
viduals we need to get confirmed to 
make government run, and it is unfor-
tunate because it doesn’t accomplish 
what he says he wants. 
So I am disappointed to hear that we 
are not going to move these nominees 
forward, and I hope at some point my 
colleague will reconsider. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 
15-minutes prior to the scheduled roll-
call vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ECONOMY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the aver-
age American household spent an esti-
mated $3,500 more in expenses last year 
as a result of inflation—$3,500. Now, 
that may not sound like much to a 
wealthy Democrat politician, but for 
most American families, that is a lot of 
money. For a lot of families, $3,500 is 
the difference between putting some-
thing in savings or living paycheck to 
paycheck. An additional $3,500 in ex-
penses can mean having to forgo essen-
tial home repairs or needed car work. 
It can mean putting off braces for a 
child or forgoing needed medical care. 
Now, the White House Chief of Staff 
may have the budget to regard infla-
tion as a high-class problem, which is 
how she referred to it, described it, but 
for ordinary Americans, inflation is a 
very real problem—a problem that is 
eating up their wage increases and low-
ering their standard of living. 
We are in the midst of an inflation 
crisis, a supply chain crisis, and as if 
those weren’t enough, a border crisis. 
Huge numbers of illegal immigrants 
are pouring across our southern border 
and have been pouring across our 
southern border for months, creating a 
security, enforcement, and humani-
tarian nightmare. 
So there is a lot for our country’s 
leadership in Washington to be focused 
on right now. What is the majority 
party doing about these crises? Well, 
not much. In fact, most of the time, 
you can be forgiven for thinking that 
neither the President nor Democrat 
leaders even realize there is an infla-
tion crisis or a supply chain crisis or a 
border crisis. The President, for one, 
seems to be hoping that if he ignores 
these crises for long enough, they will 
just go away. 
So what are the President and con-
gressional Democrats doing with their 
time if they are not addressing our bor-
der crisis or inflation crisis? Well, for 
one thing, they are attempting to dou-
ble down on the strategy that helped 
get us into this mess in the first place. 
That is right. The inflation crisis 
Democrats would like to ignore is actu-
ally something they helped create by 
flooding the economy with excessive 
government spending in their so-called 
American Rescue Plan last March. 
For months, they have tried to dou-
ble down on that bill with another 
massive spending spree that would 
flood the economy with more govern-
ment money and undoubtedly make 
the inflation crisis worse. 
The President has attempted to jus-
tify this massive spending legislation 
by claiming that it will help inflation. 
Right. So the first massive spending 
spree helps push us into an inflation 
crisis, but a second massive spending 
spree will fix it? I am pretty sure that 
the definition of ‘‘insanity’’ is doing 
the same thing over and over again and 
expecting different results. 
But 
massive 
inflation 
concerns 
haven’t stopped Democrats. After all, 
why deal with a boring inflation crisis 
when you could be thinking up new 
ways to expand the Federal Govern-
ment and new ways of taxing Ameri-
cans to pay for it? Of course, Demo-
crats’ Build Back Better plan isn’t all 
tax hikes. Democrats did manage to in-
clude a tax break in their tax-and- 
spending proposal—a tax break for blue 
State millionaires. If they succeed in 
passing it, I am sure wealthy Democrat 
donors will be grateful. 
While an inflation crisis has raged, 
Democrats have pushed for new ways 
to spend taxpayer dollars and expand 
the reach of the Federal Government 
into Americans’ lives: a huge expansion 
of 
government’s 
involvement 
in 
childcare that would disadvantage the 
religious providers so many Americans 
choose for their children; a massive in-
crease in the size of the IRS; a proposal 
to allow the IRS to examine the details 
of Americans’ banking transactions; 
energy policies that would drive up the 
cost of electricity and gasoline for 
American families; billions for prior-
ities like tree equity and environ-
mental justice programs at well-funded 
colleges and universities. The list goes 
on. 
But it would be unfair for me to sug-
gest that Democrats have expended all 
their 
energy 
on 
tax-and-spending 
sprees. The administration has also 
found time to implement provisions of 
Democrats’ original spending spree, the 
American Rescue Plan, including, ap-
parently, until they got caught, free 
government crack pipes and other drug 
paraphernalia. 
Democrats spent a lot of time push-
ing election legislation that they hope 
will give them an advantage come No-
vember. 
On the COVID front, the administra-
tion struggled with testing, but it has 
found time for vaccine and mask man-
dates, some of which I believe have far 
exceeded the administration’s author-
ity. 
Fortunately, 
the 
courts 
have 
stepped in to check some of the admin-
istration’s excesses, like the adminis-
tration’s attempt to impose a vaccine 
mandate on large private-sector em-
ployers or the administration’s deci-
sion to impose a mask mandate for 2- 
year-olds—yes, for 2-year-olds. 
Your 
Democratic 
government 
at 
work, ladies and gentlemen. 
In 
November, 
the 
administration 
issued a mask mandate for Head Start 
programs requiring all children 2 years 
of age and up to be masked inside and 
outside—out on the playground. Now, 
is there scientific evidence to support 
this? Not really. The World Health Or-
ganization, 
in 
fact, 
recommends 
against masking for children aged 5 
and under, but that hasn’t stopped the 
administration. Democrats seem deter-
mined that nothing, including science, 
will pry their masks from them—or 
perhaps I should say pry our children’s 
masks from them—since Democratic 
politicians 
have 
not 
always 
dem-
onstrated the consistency of mask- 
wearing that they expect from our chil-
dren. 
Democrats wonder why Republicans 
think we should be careful how much 
power we give the Federal Government.

If Democrats really wanted to help 
American families, they would be fo-
cusing on our inflation and supply 
chain crises and addressing the secu-
rity nightmare posed by our border cri-
sis. Instead, they are busy focusing on 
ways to secure their hold on power and 
vastly expand the reach of the Federal 
Government into Americans’ lives. I 
guess we will have to see how that 
strategy works out for them. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, before 
I begin, I would like to ask unanimous 
consent to put into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD an open letter to the Russian 
leadership from the Russian Congress 
of Intellectuals, who state: 
Our position is simple: Russia does not 
need a war with Ukraine and the West. Such 
a war is devoid of legitimacy and has no 
moral basis. 
This is a very brave statement made 
by Russian intellectuals. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Review of Books, Feb. 
4, 2022] 
AN OPEN LETTER TO THE RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP 
RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF INTELLECTUALS 
Our position is simple: Russia does not 
need a war with Ukraine and the West. Such 
a war is devoid of legitimacy and has no 
moral basis. 
There is an ever-increasing flow of alarm-
ing news about a possible Russian invasion 
of Ukraine. Reports are emerging about 
stepped-up recruitment of mercenaries with-
in Russia and the transfer of fuel and mili-
tary equipment to Ukraine’s Donetsk and 
Luhansk regions. In response, Ukraine is 
arming itself and NA TO is sending addi-
tional forces into Eastern Europe. The ten-
sion is not abating, but rather mounting. 
Russian citizens are becoming de facto hos-
tages of a reckless adventurism that has 
come to typify Russia’s foreign policy. Not 
only must Russians live with the uncer-
tainty of whether a large-scale war will 
begin, but they are also experiencing a sharp 
rise in prices and a devaluation of their cur-
rency. Is this the sort of policy Russians 
need? Do they want war—and are they ready 
to bear the brunt of it? Have they authorized 
the authorities to play with their lives in 
this way? 
But no one asks Russian citizens for their 
opinion. There is no public debate. State tel-
evision presents only a single viewpoint— 
that of the warmongers. Direct military 
threats, aggression and hatred are aimed at 
Ukraine, the US, and the West. But the most 
dangerous thing is that the war is being de-
picted not only as permissible, but as inevi-
table. This is an attempt to deceive the pop-
ulation, to impose upon them the idea of 
waging a crusade against the West, rather 
than investing in the country’s development 
and improving living standards. The cost of 
the conflict is never discussed, but the 
price—the huge, bloody price—will be paid 
by the common Russian people. 
We, responsible citizens and patriots of 
Russia, appeal to Russia’s political leader-
ship. We openly and publicly call out the 
Party of War that has been formed within 
the government. 
We represent the viewpoint of those in 
Russian society who reject war, who consider 
unlawful the use of military threats and the 
deployment of a blackmailing style in for-
eign policy. 
We reject war, whereas you, the Party of 
War, consider it acceptable. We stand for 
peace and prosperity for all Russian citizens, 
whereas you put our lives on the line for the 
sake of political games. You deceive and ma-
nipulate people, whereas we tell them the 
truth. You do not speak in the name of the 
Russian population—we do. For decades, the 
Russian people, who lost millions of lives in 
past wars, have lived by the saying: ‘‘if only 
there were no war.’’ Have you forgotten this? 
Our position is quite simple. Russia does 
not need a war with Ukraine and the West. 
No one is threatening us, no one is attacking 
us. Policies based on the idea of such a war 
are immoral and irresponsible and must not 
be conducted in the name of the Russian peo-
ple. Such a war is devoid of legitimacy and 
has no moral basis. Russian diplomacy 
should take no other position than a cat-
egorical rejection of such a war. 
Not only does such a war not reflect Rus-
sia’s interests, but it also threatens the 
country’s very existence. The senseless ac-
tions of the country’s political leadership, 
which is pushing us in this direction, will in-
evitably lead to a mass anti-war movement 
in Russia. Each of us will naturally play a 
part in it. 
We will do everything in our power to pre-
vent this war, and if it begins, to stop it.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as I 
speak today Europe, for the first time 
in almost 80 years, is faced with the 
threat of a major invasion. A large na-
tion threatens a smaller, less powerful 
neighbor, surrounding it on three sides 
with well over 100,000 troops as well as 
tanks and artillery. 
My colleagues, as we have painfully 
learned, wars have unintended con-
sequences. They rarely turn out the 
way the planners and experts tell us 
they will. Just ask the officials who 
provided rosy scenarios for the wars in 
Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, only 
to be proven horribly wrong. Just ask 
the mothers of the soldiers who were 
killed or wounded in action during 
those wars. Just ask the families of the 
millions of civilians who became col-
lateral damage in those wars. 
The war in Vietnam cost us 59,000 
American deaths and many others who 
came home wounded in body and spirit. 
The casualties in Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia are almost incalculable, but 
they were in the millions. In Afghani-
stan, what began as a response to the 
horrific attack against us on 9–11–2001 
eventually became a 20-year war, cost-
ing us $2 trillion and over 3,500 Ameri-
cans who were killed, not to mention 
tens of thousands of Afghan civilians. 
George W. Bush claimed in 2003 that 
the United States had ‘‘put the Taliban 
out of business forever.’’ Well, not 
quite the case—the Taliban is in power 
today. 
The war in Iraq, which was sold to 
the American people by stroking fear 
of a mushroom cloud from Iraq’s non-
existent weapons of mass destruction, 
led to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. 
troops and the wounding—physical and 
emotional—of tens of thousands of oth-
ers. It led to the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of Iraqis, the displacement 
of over 5 million people, and regional 
destabilization whose consequences the 
world continues to grapple with today. 
In other words, despite all of the rosy 
scenarios we heard for those foreign 
policy and military interventions, it 
turned out that the experts were wrong 
and millions of innocent people paid 
the price. That is why we must do ev-
erything possible to find a diplomatic 
resolution to prevent what would be an 
enormously 
destructive 
war 
in 
Ukraine. 
No one knows exactly what the 
human costs of such a war would be. 
There are estimates, however, that 
come from our own military and intel-
ligence community that there could be 
over 
50,000 
civilian 
casualties 
in 
Ukraine, not to mention millions of 
refugees flooding neighboring countries 
as they flee what could be the worst 
European conflict since World War II. 
In addition, of course, there would be 
many thousands of deaths within the 
Ukrainian 
and 
Russian 
militaries. 
There is also the possibility that this 
regional war could escalate to other 
parts of Europe, a continent with many 
nuclear weapons, and what might hap-
pen then is beyond imagination. 
But that is not all. The sanctions 
against Russia that would be imposed 
as a consequence of its actions and 
Russia’s threatened response to those 
sanctions could result in massive eco-
nomic upheaval with impacts on en-
ergy and gas and oil prices in our coun-
try, banking, food supplies, and the 
day-to-day needs of ordinary people 
throughout the entire world. It is like-
ly that Russians will not be the only 
people suffering from sanctions. They 
would be felt throughout Europe. They 
would be felt right here in the United 
States and likely around the world. 
And by the way—and we haven’t dis-
cussed this terribly much—at a time 
when the scientific community tells us 
that climate change is an existential 
threat to the planet, any hope of inter-
national cooperation to address global 
climate change and to address future 
pandemics would likely suffer a major 
setback. 
It should be absolutely clear about 
who is most responsible for the loom-
ing crisis, and that is Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin. Having already 
seized parts of Ukraine in 2014, Putin 
now threatens to take over the entire 
country and destroy Ukrainian democ-
racy. There should be no disagreement 
that that behavior is totally unaccept-
able. In my view, we must unequivo-
cally 
support 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
Ukraine and make clear that the inter-
national community will impose severe 
consequences on Putin and his fellow 
oligarchs if he does not change course. 
With that said, I am extremely con-
cerned when I hear the familiar drum-
beats 
in 
Washington—the 
bellicose 
rhetoric that gets amplified before 
every war—demanding that we must 
show strength, demanding that we 
must get tough, demanding that we 
must not engage in appeasement. 
A simplistic refusal to recognize the 
complex roots of the tensions in the re-
gion undermines the ability of nego-
tiators to reach a peaceful resolution. 
Now, I know it is not very popular or 
politically correct, I guess, in Wash-
ington, to consider the perspectives of 
our adversaries, but I think it is impor-
tant that we do so if we are going to 
formulate good policy. I think it is 
helpful to consider this. One of the pre-
cipitating factors of this crisis—one, 
not the only one—at least from Rus-
sia’s perspective, is the prospect of an 
enhanced security relationship between 
Ukraine and the United States and 
Western Europe, including what Russia 
sees as the threat of Ukraine joining 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, NATO, a military alliance origi-
nally created in 1949 to confront the 
Soviet Union. 
It is good to know some history. 
When Ukraine became independent 
after the Soviet Union collapsed in 
1991, Russian leaders made clear their 
concerns about the prospect of former 
Soviet states becoming part of NATO 
and positioning hostile military forces 
along Russia’s border. U.S. officials 
recognized these concerns as legiti-
mate at the time. One of those officials 
was William Perry, who served as De-
fense Secretary under President Bill 
Clinton. In a 2017 interview, Perry said: 
In the last few years, most of the blame 
can be pointed at the actions that Putin has 
taken. But in the early years I have to say 
that the United States deserves much of the 
blame. 
Further: 
Our first action that really set us off in a 
bad direction was when NATO started to ex-
pand, bringing in eastern European nations, 
some of them bordering Russia. 
That is former Secretary of State 
William Perry. 
Another U.S. official who acknowl-
edged these concerns is former U.S. 
Diplomat Bill Burns, who is now head 
of the CIA in the Biden administration. 
In his memoir, Burns quotes a memo 
he wrote while serving as counselor for 
political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow in 1995. 
Hostility to early NATO expansion is al-
most universally felt across the domestic po-
litical spectrum here. 
Over 10 years later, in 2008, Burns 
wrote in a memo to Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice: 
Ukrainian entry into NATO is the bright-
est of all redlines for the Russian elite (not 
just Putin). In more than two and a half 
years of conversations with key Russian 
players . . . I have yet to find anyone who 
views Ukraine in NATO as anything other 
than a direct challenge to Russian interests. 
So, again, these concerns were not 
just invented yesterday by Putin out of 
thin air. Clearly, invasion by Russia is 
not an answer, neither is intransigence 
by NATO. It is important to recognize, 
for example, that Finland, one of the 
most developed and democratic coun-
tries in the world, borders Russia and 
has chosen not to be a member of 
NATO. Sweden and Austria are other

examples of prosperous and democratic 
countries that have made the same 
choice. 
Vladimir Putin may be a liar and a 
demagogue, but it is hypocritical for 
the United States to insist that we as 
a nation do not accept the principle of 
spheres of influence. For the last 200 
years, our country has operated under 
the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the 
principle that as the dominant power 
in the Western Hemisphere, the United 
States has the right—according to the 
United States—to intervene against 
any country that might threaten our 
alleged interests. That is U.S. policy. 
And under this doctrine, the United 
States has undermined and overthrown 
at least a dozen countries throughout 
Latin America, Central America, and 
the Caribbean. 
As many might recall, in 1962, we 
came to the brink of nuclear war with 
the Soviet Union. Now, why was that? 
Why did we almost come to the brink 
of nuclear war with the Soviet Union? 
Well, we did that in response to the 
placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba, 
90 miles from our shore, and the Ken-
nedy administration saw that as an un-
acceptable threat to national security. 
We said it is unacceptable for a hostile 
country to have a significant military 
presence 90 miles away from our shore. 
Let us be clear. The Monroe Doctrine 
is not ancient history. As recently as 
2018, Donald Trump’s Secretary of 
State, Rex Tillerson, called the Monroe 
Doctrine ‘‘as relevant today as it was 
the day it was written.’’ 
In 2019, former Trump National Secu-
rity Advisor, John Bolton, declared 
‘‘the Monroe Doctrine is alive and 
well.’’ 
To put it simply, even if Russia were 
not ruled by a corrupt, oligarchic, au-
thoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, 
Russia, like the United States, would 
still have an interest in the security 
policies of its neighbors. 
I want people to think about this: 
Does anyone really believe that the 
United States would not have some-
thing to say, if, for example, Mexico or 
Cuba or any country in Central or 
Latin America were to form a military 
alliance with a U.S. adversary? 
Do you think that Members of Con-
gress would stand up and say, ‘‘Well, 
you know, Mexico is an independent 
country. They have the right to do 
anything they want’’? I doubt that 
very much. 
Countries should be free to make 
their own foreign policy choices, but 
making those choices wisely requires a 
serious consideration of the costs and 
benefits. The fact is that the United 
States and Ukraine entering into a 
deeper security relationship is likely 
to have some very serious costs for 
both countries. 
I believe that we must vigorously 
support the ongoing diplomatic efforts 
of the Biden administration to deesca-
late this crisis. I believe we must reaf-
firm Ukrainian independence and sov-
ereignty and that we must make clear 
to Putin and his gang of oligarchs that 
they will face major consequences 
should they continue down their cur-
rent path. 
My colleagues, we must never forget 
the horrors that a war in the region 
would cause, and we must do every-
thing possible to achieve a realistic 
and mutually agreeable resolution, one 
that is acceptable to Ukraine, Russia, 
the United States, and our European 
allies and that prevents what could be 
the worst European war since World 
War II. That approach is not weakness; 
it is not appeasement. Bringing people 
together to resolve conflicts without 
war is strength, and it is the right 
thing to do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
listened carefully to the remarks of my 
friend and colleague, Senator SANDERS 
of Vermont. I read his published article 
in the Guardian newspaper yesterday, 
and it paralleled many of the things 
which he said on the floor today. 
We have a very positive starting 
point between us. I think my record on 
voting to go to war may be identical to 
his, if not very close. Neither of us 
wants war—that is the last resort—and 
it is frightfully predictable that there 
will be innocent people killed, even in 
the best of times and in the best of 
military force. 
Secondly, I couldn’t agree with the 
Senator more that we should be pro-
moting all that we can in terms of di-
plomacy at this moment. The other 
night, I had the opportunity to be in a 
meeting with some Senators and with 
the new Chancellor of Germany, Chan-
cellor Scholz. He was on his way, soon, 
to Moscow; President Macron of France 
has been there; and others are going. I 
encourage that communication, that 
dialogue, as much as possible. I think 
it is hopeful that these efforts can lead 
to a peaceful resolution in the con-
troversy that we are now facing in 
Ukraine. 
The third point, which I agree with, 
is that it is certainly in the interest of 
the United States, for our values, to 
make it clear that we want to protect 
and defend—at least not in a military 
fashion but, let me say, in a general 
fashion—the 
notion 
of 
sovereignty 
when it comes to Ukraine. It is up to 
the Ukrainian people to chart their 
course and make their future. 
Where I think we disagree, Senator, 
is on this whole question of sphere of 
influence. I am afraid that that sugges-
tion is the green light for Vladimir 
Putin. If you will concede that he is 
somehow entitled because of the size of 
his country to reclaim Soviet Repub-
lics or to move into other theaters, I 
am sorry, but I have to part company 
with you at that point. 
I was fortunate enough, 30 years ago 
or so, to be on the ground in the Bal-
tics when I saw a dramatic demonstra-
tion of courage rarely seen in the 
world. This tiny nation of 3 million 
people broke away from the Soviet 
Union and scheduled a free election. I 
was there at the time the election took 
place, and we knew that it was an invi-
tation for Mikhail Gorbachev to retali-
ate, and he did. He moved in the Soviet 
tanks and started killing innocent peo-
ple. Before it was all over, more than a 
dozen innocent Lithuanians—and sev-
eral in Latvia—had given their lives 
because they wanted to be free again. 
And who would question why they 
would want that? 
I happened to have visited that 
area—my mother was born in Lith-
uania; I must put that on the record— 
in 1978, and I saw what life was like in 
the Baltic States under Soviet rule. It 
was sad. It was enraging. It was dis-
gusting. What they have done in the 
Soviet Union is to forcibly take those 
countries and others—some through 
the Warsaw Pact, some through the di-
rect accession to the Soviet Union— 
and control every aspect of their lives 
with communism. 
I went to the University of Vilnius, 
which I believe dates back to the 16th 
century. They took me to their Catho-
lic chapel, which, under Soviet times, 
had been converted into what they 
called a museum in tribute of atheism. 
On display in the middle of this former 
chapel setting were showcases of boo-
merangs from Australia in this holy 
space, in which they were trying to 
eradicate religion by demonstrating a 
new materiel approach to the entity. 
I only say this because, when the 
time came and they finally, through 
their courage, broke from the Soviet 
Union, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia 
came to me, knowing that I had an in-
terest in the region, as did the Polish 
people, and said: We don’t want to be 
under the thumb of Russia ever again. 
We want our freedom. We want to de-
cide our future. The only way that we 
can achieve that is if we can ally with 
the United States. Can we be consid-
ered for NATO membership? 
Eventually, through a lot of hard 
work and determination, that is what 
occurred. Poland and the Baltic States, 
along with others, joined in the NATO 
alliance. 
It is worth noting here that the 
NATO alliance is a defensive alliance. 
The Suwalki Gap, which links Russia 
as it now exists in Kaliningrad with 
Belarus, is a gap, a land bridge, and on 
either side is Poland and Lithuania. It 
is still contested territory by the Rus-
sians, and they are concerned about it. 
When the Russians put tens of thou-
sands of troops and military exercises 
on the Baltic border in Belarus, it is 
understandable they are concerned. 
They are small countries that could be 
easily pushed over. The only thing that 
saves them, I believe, is their NATO al-
liance. 
Should Ukraine be part of the NATO 
alliance? Well, there are two decisions 
that must be made, and the first and 
most important one is by the Ukrain-
ian people. They have to decide if they 
believe that it is in their best interest

for their future. We cannot decide it for 
them nor should we try to. 
Secondly, the NATO alliance has to 
decide. Under article V, are we willing 
to risk the lives of the NATO allies if 
some terrible event should occur in 
Ukraine? 
That is what the sovereign nations of 
Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, 
and so many other countries did when 
they decided to ask for membership in 
NATO. 
I don’t understand this theory of the 
Senator’s 
that, 
somehow, 
Vladimir 
Putin is entitled to a sphere of influ-
ence or control. That, to me, is unac-
ceptable and inconsistent with the no-
tion of Ukrainian sovereignty. If they 
are to decide their future, how can we 
say that Vladimir Putin has any voice 
in that process? 
There is a way that he can find a 
more peaceful situation in the world, 
and that is if he will stop being a thug 
and stop sending his troops to the bor-
ders of countries and stop cutting off 
gas supplies to countries that he 
doesn’t like. 
I mean, his strong-arm tactics de-
serve a response from the United 
States, and I am afraid simply sending 
him a harsh letter is not enough any-
more. So we have made it clear that he 
will pay a price if he invades, the 
NATO alliance has. The price will be a 
string of sanctions, and we have in-
cluded some of them in the legislation 
that Senator MENENDEZ is working on, 
which I cosponsored. But that is the 
only way to make it clear to him that 
such a price will be paid. 
What he has done is very obvious to 
me. He has united the NATO alliance 
in a way we didn’t expect. There were 
some divisions within the alliance— 
some serious and some not serious—but 
he has brought us together. And we 
should be together in standing in de-
fense of the territory of the NATO al-
lies and in making it clear that if 
Vladimir Putin is going to try to ex-
tend his reach into Ukraine or into any 
other area, he will at least meet with 
political resistance. 
I think, at a minimum, that is where 
it should be. I hope it doesn’t go any 
further. I share the Senator’s feeling 
on that. I don’t want the military situ-
ation to escalate or to threaten Amer-
ican lives or to involve us at that level 
at all, but unless we are firm with him 
now and don’t concede that he has any 
sphere of influence in Ukraine, I am 
afraid he will take advantage of the 
situation. 
I am open to a question if you have 
one. I would like to have a dialogue, if 
possible, on this through the Chair, of 
course. 
Mr. 
SANDERS. 
I appreciate the 
thoughts of my friend from Illinois. 
With much of what he said, I, obvi-
ously, agree. My father came from Po-
land as a matter of fact. 
I think, maybe, the difference of 
opinion that we have has something to 
do with what we don’t talk about very 
often openly but that, I think, every-
body knows exists. 
I mentioned—and I think you will 
not disagree with me—that, over the 
last many, many decades, the United 
States has overthrown governments 
throughout Latin America, Central 
America, and the Caribbean. There is 
no denying that we almost went to a 
nuclear war in 1962 under the Kennedy 
administration, which felt—and prob-
ably correctly—that Soviet missiles in 
Cuba, 90 miles away from us, were a 
threat to this country and not to be 
tolerated. 
So I would only ask my friend from 
Illinois to put himself into the mindset 
of the Russians in that nobody here— 
not I, certainly—is ever talking about 
reclaiming other countries. You men-
tioned that, and it is certainly not any-
thing that I support. 
But if the United States has a right 
to 
overthrow 
countries 
throughout 
Latin America to protect our so-called 
interests and if there would be an up-
roar in this Chamber, perhaps from you 
and me as well, if Mexico, which is an 
independent nation, decided to form a 
military alliance with China or Russia, 
and people were to say you can’t do 
that, should we not put ourselves a lit-
tle bit in Russia’s position in under-
standing that if we consider Latin 
America and Central America and the 
Caribbean to be within our sphere of 
influence and have the right to inter-
vene, that Russia itself might have 
some legitimate concerns about mili-
tary forces 5 miles from their border? 
That is the question I would pose. 
Mr. DURBIN. It is a legitimate his-
toric question. 
But if you are saying that in the 
name of the Monroe Doctrine, to pro-
tect ourselves in this hemisphere we 
have done things which we are not 
proud of today, interfering with the 
sovereignty of nations—the term ‘‘ba-
nana republic’’ emerged from that 
Monroe Doctrine. 
And what happened in many of these 
countries is that they became vassals 
of the U.S. economy, and I don’t say 
that with any pride. We wouldn’t want 
to welcome that to happen in Europe, 
would we, I mean, Putin invading some 
sphere of influence and the sovereignty 
of other nations? 
Mr. SANDERS. No, we would not. 
But my point is, the Monroe Doctrine 
remains in existence today. It is not 
just history. 
You and I can agree that maybe the 
United States should not have over-
thrown governments over the years. 
The Monroe Doctrine exists today. Two 
years ago, the Secretary of State said 
it is in existence. I don’t know how 
many people in this Chamber would 
tell you that it does not exist today. 
I use that example, to my friend from 
Illinois—if Mexico were to enter into 
an alliance with China, would my 
friend say: Well, Mexico is an inde-
pendent country; they have the right 
to do anything they want. 
Mr. DURBIN. I think that hypo-
thetical is just that. Of course, it is 
only a hypothetical. But look at the re-
ality. It wasn’t that long ago when Ec-
uador elected a new President. At the 
inauguration of that President were 
representatives of Russia, Cuba, and 
Iran. Now, you wouldn’t put any of 
those countries today on a list of close 
American allies. And yet did we invade 
Ecuador? Never considered it. Never 
considered it. 
We live in a different time in the 21st 
century. I understand the Monroe Doc-
trine and the days of gunboat diplo-
macy and the days of moving a handful 
of troops in to take control back on the 
Dominican Republic. But to posit the 
notion that somehow there is going to 
be a military alliance on the border of 
the United States, therefore Putin is 
able to compromise the sovereignty of 
Ukraine, that doesn’t follow, Senator. 
Mr. SANDERS. No, it does. 
All that I am saying is, 2 years ago, 
the Secretary of State of the United 
States of America said the Monroe 
Doctrine is alive and well. 
Yes, of course, it is hypothetical. I do 
not believe that Mexico is going to 
enter into an alliance with China. But 
all I ask is to put what is going on in 
Russia into a context and to look at 
American policy and history as well. 
This is a complicated issue, and I think 
it is important for us to at least look 
at the concerns that Russia has. 
There is no disagreement that if 
Putin were to commit the horrible, 
horrible blunder of invading Ukraine, 
count me in as somebody who will go 
as far as we can to make sure there are 
real consequences against the oligarchs 
and that policy. But I do think if we 
are going to reach a settlement in a 
very complicated issue, it is important 
for us to understand a little bit about 
Russia’s concerns. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would only disagree 
in this respect: I believe Ukraine has 
been a victim of Russian aggression for 
a long period of time. The leader 
Yanukovych 
who 
was 
deposed 
in 
Ukraine when the Maidan demonstra-
tions took place was clearly a servant 
and vassal of Moscow. 
I believe it was the Russians who in-
vaded Crimea and reclaimed that terri-
tory for their own. It was the Russians 
who sent in little green men with no 
symbols or emblems on their uniforms 
to invade eastern Ukraine and contin-
ued to kill innocent Ukrainians for 8 
years now. So it is clear to me that 
Ukraine has been a victim of Russian 
aggression for a long period of time. 
To suggest the notion that this is 
somehow within Putin’s sphere of in-
fluence is to rationalize Putin’s con-
duct, to forgive his conduct. And I am 
not about to do that. I don’t think we 
should. 
You don’t put 110,000 Russian troops 
on the border and prepare for war un-
less you believe you can pressure that 
country into acceding to your de-
mands. Ukraine is not a military 
power. It won’t last very long, sadly, if 
the Russians do invade. But at this mo-
ment saying spheres of influence, that 
the United States has made its own

mistakes in the past in the name of 
sphere of influence and therefore we 
should look the other way at what 
Putin is doing is just contradictory. 
Mr. SANDERS. The Senator knows I 
am not for looking the other way. That 
is not a fair statement. As I have said 
many, many times, I am strongly sup-
portive of major, major, major con-
sequences if Putin invades Ukraine, 
and we have got to do everything we 
can to protect Ukrainian sovereignty. 
All right, I have made my point. 
Mr. DURBIN. And I thank you for it. 
And I just want to close by saying 
that there is a—I see the Senator is 
waiting to speak. I close by saying that 
I hope very soon, in the next couple of 
weeks, to make a trip to Poland and to 
the Baltics. 
And I will tell you that the people of 
Polish descent and Ukrainian descent 
and Baltic descent in the State that I 
represent are watching these events by 
the day. They lived through the Soviet 
takeover of their countries. They un-
derstand what happened to their basic 
freedoms of speech and political ex-
pression and religious belief as a result 
of it. They don’t want to return to 
those days. 
The United States has said we are 
committed to their democracy and 
their values, and I think we have dem-
onstrated it, and we should continue 
to. 
I sincerely hope Putin does not take 
advantage of the situation and invade 
Ukraine. I am not calling for a mili-
tary response, but we should have a 
type of response that he will never for-
get if he does something that fool-
hardy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I just 
feel the need to just make a simple 
point, although it should be obvious. 
But let me just state to be clear that 
what we are witnessing in the Russian 
buildup at the Ukrainian border has 
nothing to do with Russian security. 
There is no Russian security interests 
at stake here. There is no threat to 
Russian security. Ukrainians could not 
mount a credible attack on Russia if 
they wanted to, and they don’t want 
to. What this is all about entirely is an 
authoritarian leader of Russia who 
wants to reestablish hegemony over 
the states of the former Soviet Union. 
He wants to reestablish the Russian 
Empire. It has nothing do with any le-
gitimate concerns that Russia has. 
I strongly feel that if he makes the 
outrageous 
mistake 
of 
invading 
Ukraine, that we will use the many 
very, very powerful tools at our dis-
posal to ensure that he regrets that de-
cision. 
MONETARY POLICY 
The reason I rise today, Mr. Presi-
dent, is to discuss an issue that really 
should be of serious concern to every 
Member of this body, and it goes to the 
heart of the very nature of account-
ability in a democratic republic such 
as ours. 
There is an awful lot in our culture, 
in our country, that has been politi-
cized and polarized—we all know that— 
even sports, certainly news, maybe 
even music, and definitely our govern-
ment. We have seen that manifested in 
many way, including a recent debate 
over the filibuster. But there are some 
things that Congress has tried hard to 
keep from being at least overly politi-
cized in our government, and one of 
those is monetary policy. 
I think it is exceptionally important 
that we try the best we can, to the 
maximum extent we can, to not let pol-
itics infuse our monetary policy be-
cause that is going down a very bad 
and dangerous road. Unfortunately, I 
would suggest that we have started to 
see that encroachment. We started to 
see politics at the historically inde-
pendent Federal Reserve. 
In the past month, the Banking Com-
mittee has held nomination hearings 
for five of President Biden’s nominees 
for the Fed: Jerome Powell for Chair-
man of the Fed, Lael Brainard for Vice 
Chair of the Fed, Sarah Bloom Raskin 
for Vice Chair for Supervision at the 
Fed, and Lisa Cook and Philip Jeffer-
son for Fed Governors. 
What I think about this slate of 
nominees, so to speak—and I have dif-
ferent views on the different can-
didates, but one thing is clear: This 
moment where we are going to decide 
whether or not to confirm these nomi-
nees is not just about the qualifica-
tions of the individuals; it is really a 
referendum on the role that the Fed is 
going to play in our country and 
whether it is going to remain an inde-
pendent entity. 
Let me explain what I mean. I know 
there are folks on the left, including 
within the Biden administration—cer-
tainly some within the Biden adminis-
tration—who are openly advocating 
that the Fed use its enormous super-
visory powers over financial institu-
tions to resolve some very complex but 
essentially political issues, like what 
we should do about global warming; 
even social justice; even, in some cases, 
education policy. 
Let me be clear. These are very im-
portant issues. These are big chal-
lenges for our country. But they are 
entirely unrelated to the Fed’s limited 
statutory mandates and expertise, for 
that matter. 
Addressing these challenging issues 
of climate and social justice and edu-
cation policy—all of them necessarily 
involve making tradeoffs and some 
tough decisions. In a democratic soci-
ety, those tradeoffs must be made by 
elected representatives, the people who 
actually report to the American peo-
ple. That is us. It is a legislative body. 
These 
big, 
tough 
policy 
decisions 
should not be made by unelected and 
unaccountable central bankers. 
The question is not about the impor-
tance of these issues. It is not about 
the specific policies. It is about who 
should decide—who should decide—how 
we proceed on these. 
Just take the case of global warming. 
We could decide to limit domestic oil 
and gas production. If we do that, en-
ergy prices will rise. Americans will 
pay more at the pump to accomplish 
the intended goal of decreasing emis-
sions. Well, how much of that is appro-
priate? To what degree should we pur-
sue that policy? If we move aggres-
sively to limit energy production but 
other countries don’t, then scientists 
tell us that global warming won’t 
change in any significant way. Well, 
should we do it anyway? And how much 
of a change in the projected tempera-
ture of the planet should we insist on 
for any given amount of economic pain 
that we inflict on the American people? 
Look, I am not here to debate the an-
swer to those questions. Those are 
tough questions, it seems to me. It is 
not about whether you think those are 
important questions. I think they are 
very important questions. My point is 
that they are difficult choices, and 
they have to be made by the account-
able representatives of the American 
people through a transparent and delib-
erative legislative process. That is how 
we ought to make big decisions in this 
country. 
My concern about the Fed is it is 
wandering away from its mandate, it is 
overreaching, and there are some who 
are advocating that it use its enormous 
powers to make some of these decisions 
that the American people should be 
making through their elected rep-
resentatives. 
By the way, this is not just a hypo-
thetical; I have a number of examples. 
I will just share one example where the 
Fed is clearly exceeding its mandate, 
engaging in political advocacy—the 
Minneapolis Fed. 
The Minneapolis Fed—the leader, the 
President of the Minneapolis Fed—with 
apparently the full support of the 
board of the Minneapolis Fed, is ac-
tively lobbying to change Minnesota’s 
Constitution and specifically to change 
it with respect to K–12 education pol-
icy. Does anybody think that how we 
pursue primary and secondary edu-
cation is the role of the Fed to decide? 
I can assure you, it is not. 
By way of warning, if this kind of po-
litical activism by what is supposed to 
be an independent central bank—if this 
is tolerated, then the potential for 
abuse is endless. Again, you don’t have 
to take my word for it. I would argue 
that three of President Biden’s five 
nominees—Ms. Brainard, Ms. Raskin, 
and Professor Cook—have made a num-
ber of concerning statements that tell 
us exactly what they think the Fed 
should do outside of their mandated 
areas. 
Let’s start with Governor Brainard. 
Now, to her credit, she has chosen her 
words much more carefully than, say, 
Ms. Raskin has, but Ms. Brainard has 
nonetheless urged the Fed to take an 
activist role on global warming. 
According to the New York Times, 
she has ‘‘endorsed the use of super-
visory 
guidance—the 
Fed’s 
rec-
ommendations to banks—to encourage

February 10, 2022 
financial institutions to curb their ex-
posures.’’ That is exactly what I am 
talking about—using the powers of the 
Fed to pressure financial institutions 
to decide who gets credit and who 
doesn’t. 
I am particularly concerned that she 
has specifically advocated for the Fed 
to shape environmental policy through 
the so-called climate scenario analysis. 
Now, Miss Brainard and others suggest 
that they just want to understand the 
systemic risk that arises from global 
warming. First of all, the Fed doesn’t 
have any expertise in environmental 
policy. 
The fact is, there is no reason to 
think that global warming actually 
poses systemic risk to the financial 
system. It doesn’t. As I have stated re-
peatedly, we haven’t found a single 
bank, a single financial institution 
anywhere in America that has failed in 
modern times due to any weather 
event. We get hit with very severe 
weather events every single year, year 
in and year out, but never has a finan-
cial institution—not a single one, 
much less the entire system. 
Now, 
Ms. 
Raskin—Sarah 
Bloom 
Raskin—who is the nominee to actu-
ally be in charge of the supervision of 
Fed-regulated banks, has gone even 
further than Ms. Brainard in advo-
cating for financial regulators to take 
this activist role with respect to global 
warming. She has repeatedly, publicly, 
and forcefully advocated for using fi-
nancial regulation in general—and the 
Fed in particular—to allocate capital 
and debank energy companies. 
Now, again, Ms. Brainard and Ms. 
Raskin will say that this is just about 
assessing risk; but in reality, Ms. 
Raskin has also said the quiet part out 
loud. In a 2020 report from a progres-
sive organization, Ms. Raskin urged fi-
nancial regulators to adopt policies 
that will ‘‘allocate capital’’ away from 
energy companies. In a 2021 speech at 
the Green Swan Conference, she pro-
posed ‘‘portfolio limits or concentra-
tion limits’’ on banks’ loans to energy 
companies. 
It is not because the banks can’t 
withstand a credit loss if that should 
occur. Actually, the American banking 
system is more heavily capitalized 
than it has ever been. That is not what 
it is about. It is about her view about 
climate change. 
In May of 2020, at the height of the 
pandemic, she wrote an op-ed in the 
New York Times specifically calling 
for excluding a single sector, the fossil 
energy sector, which she called a 
‘‘dying industry,’’ from the Fed’s emer-
gency lending facilities. Now, the Fed— 
you could argue about whether the Fed 
should have ever stood up these facili-
ties, but at least the Fed, at the time, 
had the good sense to say: If we go in 
and buy corporate bonds, we are going 
to do it through a vehicle where we do 
not discriminate at all among the 
many, many sectors of our economy 
because it is not our job as the Fed to 
decide which ones get favorable treat-
ment and which ones don’t. That is up 
to markets to decide. 
That is not Ms. Raskin’s view. She 
was very clear. She criticized the Fed 
precisely because they did not inten-
tionally exclude the fossil energy sec-
tor. 
This is a bad idea on many, many 
levels. One of which is, by the way, 
central committees that try to allocate 
capital in economies usually do a real-
ly bad job. And that is one of the rea-
sons 
why 
our 
economy 
has 
out-
performed the rest of the world. We 
tend not to do that, and many other 
countries tend to do that. 
I can give you an example of where 
this can go. She wrote at the time, 
back in 2020, that ‘‘Even in the short 
term’’—in the short term—‘‘fossil fuels 
are a terrible investment.’’ 
Well, whatever you might think 
about the long term, the jury is back 
in on the short term. Investment in 
fossil fuels was absolutely terrific. 
That is just the data, right? The S&P 
500, over the last 12 months, is up 21 
percent. Oil and gas indices are up 65, 
70 percent. 
That is the kind of mistake that too 
much hubris in government can lead 
to. And Ms. Raskin’s proposals would 
not be just devastating for energy 
workers but also consumers, who would 
end up inevitably having to pay much 
more for energy. 
Again, what is the basis on which she 
defends exercising these extraordinary 
powers? Well, it certainly is her belief 
that climate risk is so imminent, so 
threatening, and so devastating that it 
just requires this. 
And let me be clear: The folks—Ms. 
Raskin and Ms. Brainard—they divide 
this into two categories—climate risk, 
that is. There is the physical risk, and 
then there is what they call transition 
risk. Now, the data is very clear about 
the physical risk, right, like an adverse 
event from severe weather events. 
They don’t pose a threat to our finan-
cial system. Think about the things 
that we have withstood in the last few 
years: Hurricane Sandy, forest fires, 
and devastating events. Name one fi-
nancial institution in America that 
failed as a result. There isn’t one. Not 
even close. They weren’t even harmed, 
much less our entire financial system. 
So even Chairman Powell agreed that 
there is no physical risk to financial 
institutions. 
So the one that they rely on is, well, 
but there is transition risk. Transition 
risk. Well, transition risk is really 
about changing customer preference. 
And that happens all the time. Cus-
tomers’ preferences change. 
I would suggest that bankers know 
how to manage changes in their cus-
tomers’ preferences better than central 
bankers do or regulators do. That is 
not that different from the risk they 
run every day. They lend money to 
companies that have a permanent risk 
that consumer preferences will change 
in ways that could be adverse for the 
company to which they lend. It is a 
fundamental part of their business to 
understand the risk they take of that 
sort. 
So what is a transition risk, really? 
What transition risk really is: It is a 
political risk. And Chairman Powell 
pretty much acknowledged that too. 
The real nature of the transition risk 
is unelected officials like Ms. Raskin 
exercising the power she thinks the 
Fed should exercise, which is to step in 
and make it prohibitively expensive, 
for instance, for banks to provide cred-
it to the energy sector or put caps on 
how much exposure they can have to 
this. That is the risk. 
And I don’t know how you do a sce-
nario analysis when the scenario you 
have to analyze is one in which there 
are political moves to constrain your 
business. As I said, Ms. Raskin says the 
quiet part out loud. 
Now let me turn to Professor Cook. 
Now, the administration cites her role 
as a director of the Chicago Fed as one 
of the main qualifications for her ele-
vation to Federal Reserve Board of 
Governors. She is a director of the Chi-
cago Fed. She was put in that position 
2 weeks before she was nominated to be 
a Fed Board Governor. 
She has a Ph.D., but she has done no 
academic work in monetary economics. 
And the few times that she has spoken 
about monetary policy, it has been a 
cause for considerable concern. 
So we have got unemployment at or 
maybe below 4 percent, inflation above 
7 percent, and Professor Cook refused 
to endorse the Fed’s recent decision to 
at least begin to withdraw the easy 
money policy that they have been pur-
suing. 
Let’s keep in mind, today the Fed is 
still buying bonds. The Fed is still 
throwing gasoline on the inflation fire. 
They are throwing a little less gasoline 
than they did before, and they do in-
tend to phase it out completely by 
March. So we have got inflation roar-
ing along; we are pretty close to full 
employment; and she couldn’t bring 
herself to suggest that, yeah, at least 
we should accelerate the pace at which 
we withdraw the easy money we have 
been pouring into the economy. 
I don’t know how Professor Cook 
could come to that conclusion. I mean, 
the fact is, inflation is way, way—it is 
multiples of what the Fed target is. It 
is at a 40-year high. And while wages 
have been growing, they are not grow-
ing as fast as inflation. So people’s 
take-home pay goes up, but the cost of 
the things they need to buy goes up by 
more. 
That 
unambiguously 
leaves 
workers further and further behind. 
I am also concerned that most of 
what Professor Cook has focused on in 
her writing and speaking and, cer-
tainly, tweeting is very extreme polit-
ical advocacy. So, for instance, she is a 
big supporter of race-based reparations. 
She has promoted conspiracies about 
the Georgia voter laws. She has sought 
to cancel those who disagree with her 
views. In fact, she publicly called for 
the firing of an economist who dared to

tweet that he opposed the idea of 
defunding the Chicago Police. 
And after Banking Committee Re-
publican staff highlighted some of 
these tweets and others and brought it 
to the public’s attention, Professor 
Cook blocked the Banking Committee 
Republican Twitter account. Maybe 
she realizes just how inflammatory her 
partisan tweets have been. 
But, look, I mean, the Fed is already, 
in my view, suffering from a bit of a 
credibility problem because it has wan-
dered outside of its lane. It has sought 
to influence policy beyond its mandate. 
And I am concerned that Professor 
Cook will further politicize an institu-
tion that absolutely should remain 
apolitical. 
So, Mr. President, I will conclude 
with this. Let’s think about what is the 
danger here if we went ahead and con-
firmed all of these nominees. We would 
be confirming partisans to the Fed 
Board, contributing to its movement in 
a partisan direction, and ratifying the 
idea that the Fed ought to engage in 
what, in my view, certainly should be 
the domain of accountable elected rep-
resentatives. They have told us this. 
It would be in global warming. It 
might very well be in issues of social 
justice. It might even be education pol-
icy, as we are seeing today. And this is 
not the role of the Fed. This is not ap-
propriate. And it probably doesn’t end 
there. 
If this is ratified and if the Fed starts 
to go down this road, well, someday 
Republicans will be in control, Repub-
licans will populate the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Fed. And will those ap-
pointees decide, well, maybe the Con-
gress doesn’t spend enough money on 
defense, so maybe we should allocate 
some financial resources to defense 
companies? Or maybe Congress doesn’t 
spend enough money building a border 
wall. Maybe we ought to find a way to 
subsidize companies engaged in that. 
Or maybe there is not enough offshore 
oil development, and we should do 
that. 
Look, that would be a terrible idea. 
That would be a terrible idea. I might 
support those policies. I would ada-
mantly oppose the Fed having the au-
thority to decide anything about those 
policies. 
I know my Democratic colleagues 
have spent the last several months 
talking about how passionately dedi-
cated they are to democratic values 
and democratic principles. Look, I 
think there is a lot of sincerity on the 
part of my Democratic colleagues. But 
certainly one of those democratic prin-
ciples has to be that unelected Gov-
ernors of America’s central bank can’t 
exercise responsibility that belongs 
with the American people and their 
elected representatives. 
So I think the vote on these nomi-
nees isn’t just about the individual 
nominees. It is about whether we are 
going to keep the Fed apolitical and 
independent and ensure that elected 
accountable representatives make the 
difficult decisions for our country. If 
that doesn’t convince my colleagues, 
then I would urge them to remember 
that in this line of work one thing is 
always true, and that is that, eventu-
ally, the shoe is on the other foot. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
really believe you can tell a lot about 
an administration’s priorities based on 
the people that they put in place in 
each location. And that is true for 
every administration. 
There are more than 300 million 
Americans. Many of them are pas-
sionate about serving our Nation. We 
have many great Federal employees 
who spend their entire life serving our 
Nation. So there are a lot of individ-
uals to be able to choose from to be 
able to put in different administration 
roles, but their background tells you a 
lot about what the priority is and the 
purpose is. 
For instance, I would say Xavier 
Becerra, who is leading HHS, who has 
no healthcare background at all, who is 
an attorney now leading our Nation’s 
healthcare focus—the major issue for 
him: He was the most vocal proponent 
of abortion while he was in Congress. 
While he was attorney general in Cali-
fornia, he was an activist pushing abor-
tion in every single country—even 
suing other States when they limited 
abortion as the attorney general of 
California. 
He was an activist about abortion. He 
would increase abortions in America. 
That was a major reason he was put in 
that spot with HHS. Why else would 
you put an activist attorney leading 
our Nation’s healthcare area? 
You can say the same thing with 
some of the major nominations that 
have come in for DOJ: Kristen Clarke, 
Vanita Gupta. Both of them are out-
spoken proponents of the ‘‘defund the 
police’’ movement, and now they are 
actually in the Department of Justice. 
Kristen Clarke wrote: ‘‘We must in-
vest less in police and more in social 
workers.’’ She also wrote: ‘‘We must 
invest less in police’’ and more in so-
cial supports for our schools; less in po-
lice, more in mental health aid. It was 
the main focus of the ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ movement that she continued to 
be able to drive in her op-eds and her 
writings. That is why she was selected, 
clearly, to go to the Department of 
Justice. 
Vanita Gupta did the same thing. 
She said: It is ‘‘critical for state and 
local leaders to . . . decrease police 
budgets and the scope, role, and re-
sponsibility of police in our lives.’’ 
There is a reason she is selected to be 
able to be in that spot. It matches with 
the priorities and values of the admin-
istration. 
It is the same thing when you look at 
Defense. In national Defense, Alex-
andra Baker, when she was put to be 
Under Secretary of Defense, she said 
she is outspoken in beliefs that climate 
change is the leading national security 
challenge that we face—the leading na-
tional security challenge. I am sure the 
folks in Russia and Ukraine would be 
glad to be able to hear that our leading 
challenge currently is climate change 
in the Department of Defense. 
Listen, these are all sets of priorities 
when you look at them and you look at 
the different individuals, and it is the 
same when we look at what is hap-
pening right now with Ms. Sarah 
Bloom Raskin being nominated to be 
the Vice Chair of Supervision at the 
Federal Reserve. This is no just ordi-
nary position. The Vice Chair of Super-
vision of the Federal Reserve will have 
an immense amount of regulatory and 
supervisory power to push her agenda 
and to control many aspects of the 
Federal economy. 
She is in lockstep with President 
Biden’s agenda to take on fossil fuels. 
The problem is, the direction that she 
is trying to lead the Federal Reserve is 
to be able to engage in picking winners 
and losers, not just from a policy as-
pect but from a capital aspect, from 
the Federal Reserve. 
This is not something I am just writ-
ing in to be able to say. This is some-
thing she stated over and over and over 
again—that the Federal Reserve should 
be able to reach in and to be able to 
make it more difficult to get capital 
for anyone who handles fossil fuels. 
Why is that important to us? Well, 
because 70 percent of the energy in the 
United States is fossil-fuel related. So 
what happens if, suddenly, it gets hard-
er to be able to do natural gas invest-
ment, it gets harder to do oil invest-
ment in the United States? 
Well, two things happen with that. It 
is pretty straightforward. We import 
more energy, and the prices go up. 
That is what happens, because we are 
not going to have a decreasing amount 
in the foreseeable future. That is not 
just me saying that. That is President 
Biden’s U.S. Energy Information Ad-
ministration. 
If you look at the charts and details 
that they put out about what is going 
to happen for oil and natural gas usage, 
they would forecast all the way up to 
2050 that it is going to be about what it 
is. Worldwide, it is going to go up sig-
nificantly, but in the United States, we 
are still going to need oil and natural 
gas at about the level we are at right 
now, at least through 2050. 
Now, we can talk a lot about carbon 
capture, and I am all in on that con-
versation. But making it harder and 
more expensive to actually get oil and 
natural gas while we know we are 
going to need the same amount or 
more, who pays for that? Well, con-
sumers do. 
So let’s look at the simple facts on 
this. In January of 2020, before COVID 
starts striking worldwide, natural gas 
prices: $2.02 a unit. Natural gas prices 
in January of 2022, the latest number 
we have: $4.38. 
Let’s look at gasoline for every per-
son that is actually filling up their

tank. If we go back to, let’s say, Feb-
ruary 2019, well before the pandemic— 
we will just compare February to Feb-
ruary. Before that time period, it was 
$2.39 a gallon. Today, the average price 
is $3.47 a gallon. 
What are we experiencing? Policy 
pressure on limiting access. And what 
is happening right now is that Sarah 
Bloom Raskin has been nominated to 
step into the Federal Reserve, and her 
primary issue is: Make it even harder. 
When our gasoline prices have gone 
up almost 50 percent in the last year, I 
would have to say this administration 
is intentionally finding ways to be able 
to make the price of energy more ex-
pensive, to be able to push people to 
other energy resources. Who feels the 
pain of that? Every single American. 
I wish I could just say this was hy-
perbole, but let me read just a few 
things to you. 
During the COVID pandemic, the 
Federal Reserve was stepping in and 
trying to stabilize companies around 
the country that were struggling and 
that were challenged. And we all know 
plenty of companies that were strug-
gling or challenged. 
One of the things the Federal Reserve 
did, like they did for every other com-
pany, was also to stabilize oil and gas 
companies, because if those oil and gas 
companies tanked, that means we have 
got to get energy from overseas in the 
days ahead. So they did what they did 
to every other entity. They were neu-
tral in it and said: If you are a com-
pany that is providing an infrastruc-
ture, we are going to provide you ac-
cess to resources the same as everyone 
else—except 
Sarah 
Bloom 
Raskin 
wrote this: The Federal Reserve ‘‘buy-
ing troubled assets from the fossil fuel 
industry’’ is ‘‘dangerous.’’ 
She said: ‘‘It’s bad for the economy, 
bad for the environment, bad for all of 
us.’’ 
If Sarah Bloom Raskin was in the 
Federal Reserve during the COVID pan-
demic, we would have likely seen mul-
tiple energy companies across the 
United States collapse for lack of cap-
ital, and, right now, we would be buy-
ing even more gasoline and even more 
oil or natural gas from Russia instead. 
I am not sure how that solves the 
problem, but her priority is this simple 
statement she has made: ‘‘Financial 
regulators must reimagine their own 
role so they can play their part in the 
broader, reimagining of our economy.’’ 
Now, I don’t know how many people 
who I would run into in Oklahoma who 
would say: Do you know who I want re-
imagining our economy? Not the free 
market but someone in DC—I would be 
interested in them at their office, 
working with the capital assets across 
the country and managing who gets ac-
cess to capital and who doesn’t. I would 
like to have someone I have never met, 
in DC, reimagining our economy based 
on their preferences. 
I don’t meet many people like that in 
Oklahoma. They want a fair playing 
field, they want a level playing field, 
and they want free markets. 
Do we want a clean economy? Abso-
lutely, we do. 
I would challenge anyone in this 
Chamber to look at the energy break-
down in Oklahoma and compare it to 
your State’s energy breakdown, in the 
amount of renewables that we use in 
our State versus what you are using in 
yours. 
We are passionate about a clean-en-
ergy future, but we are also realists in 
the process and not trying to drive the 
price up for every person in the proc-
ess. 
Maria Robinson has also been nomi-
nated to be Assistant Secretary of the 
Office of Electricity. I met with her 
earlier this week. Ms. Robinson is from 
Massachusetts. She has vocally op-
posed natural gas pipelines coming into 
New England. She was pretty clear 
that she understands they use dirtier 
home heating oil in the Northeast, but 
she doesn’t want natural gas pipelines 
coming in. But she didn’t seem to op-
pose when a Russian tanker pulled in 
and offloaded natural gas into Boston 
Harbor. So, literally, buying natural 
gas from the Russians, not from the 
United States, didn’t seem to be an 
issue. But she did make this statement: 
‘‘I would certainly be a part of [the] 
group of folks who oppose any new gas 
pipelines.’’ 
In my conversation with her, I asked 
her about—I just picked a day. January 
16, 2022, is the day picked just in our 
conversation. I said: That particular 
day in New England, 24 percent of the 
energy generation was from fuel oil. 
Over 30 percent was from natural gas. 
And 8 percent was from renewables—8. 
That particular day, 24 percent was 
from home heating oil, over 30 percent 
natural gas, and 8 percent from renew-
ables. 
So my simple question was this: 
What are you planning to substitute in 
that? How is this going to work? 
Her response was, well, in our area in 
New England, we are working on con-
necting our grid more to other parts of 
the country to deliver electricity to us. 
What that really means: We don’t 
like windmills. We don’t like to look at 
them in Boston Harbor. We don’t like 
offshore wind. We want windmills built 
in Oklahoma, and you guys just ship us 
our electricity so we can flick on the 
light. 
Ms. Laura Daniels Davis. She has 
been nominated to be Assistant Sec-
retary for the Office of Land and Min-
erals Management. She is currently in 
her role already with DOI. In her role 
in DOI, she has already made the 
change that routine permitting deci-
sions that are typically made in the 
field to expedite the process of making 
permits, those have all been pulled up 
to her desk in Washington, DC, where 
they have slowed down dramatically. 
The clear signal was this: If you want 
to do any oil and gas development, it 
has to come through me, and it is not 
going to be rapid like it used to be. So 
if you are going to invest capital, just 
understand your capital is whether I 
make that decision or not. 
They have not held a single onshore 
oil and gas lease sale, even though they 
are required by law to do so. They just 
ignored it for a year and said: We are 
studying it. 
There is also a 5-year leasing plan 
that is required for offshore oil and gas 
development. So while they have cut 
off onshore, offshore there is a 5-year 
lease plan that has to be put in place 
that is due by June of this year. So far, 
we have no signal they have even 
begun that, and it takes months to be 
able to develop it. 
Why are these individuals being se-
lected for these positions? Because it is 
very clear they have certain priorities 
in place. They were selected because 
they are going to block out anything 
that deals with oil and gas, and their 
focus is to cut it off right now—cut off 
pipelines, cut off new leasing, cut off 
offshore leasing, make it harder to be 
able to get access to capital. All of that 
will raise prices for American con-
sumers. 
Today—today—it 
was 
announced 
that the inflation rate in the United 
States is now at 71⁄2 percent. It con-
tinues to rise month after month after 
month. I would say to you: That is di-
rectly connected to a group of policies 
that have been put in place to make 
energy more expensive—and it is—to 
make it more difficult to be able to do 
a lot of things in permitting and such— 
and it is. 
Yes, we are recovering from COVID. I 
am very aware. But the policies that 
are put in place are also driving this. 
We have 2 million people that have 
illegally crossed the border last year— 
2 million. That is an enormous number. 
That 2-million number did not happen 
by just the calendar and by COVID. 
Policies were put in place that have led 
to a flood of people illegally crossing 
our border. Policies are being put in 
place by individuals who are directly 
leading to 71⁄2 percent inflation in our 
country. 
Can I say to you this? Half of Ameri-
cans alive have never in their lifetime 
experienced inflation like they are ex-
periencing right now? Half of the 
Americans alive do not know what 71⁄2 
percent inflation is going to mean to 
them personally, but they are learning 
quickly because what they thought 
they were going to buy last month, 
they can no longer afford this month. 
And it doesn’t look better next month. 
And if we don’t deal with real con-
sequences for people, including who is 
put into different positions, this never 
gets better.

f 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of Black History 
Month. 
Black History Month provides an op-
portunity for our Nation collectively 
to reflect on and celebrate the con-
tributions and legacies of Black Ameri-
cans. And while we have chosen this 
month, February, to engage in collec-
tive celebration, we must also remem-
ber that we benefit from the contribu-
tions and legacies of these great Amer-
icans every single day. 
Today, I would like to focus my re-
marks on our Nation’s black entre-
preneurs. From Madame C.J. Walker to 
Baltimore’s own Reginald F. Lewis and 
beyond, Black entrepreneurs have long 
been vital to the success of the Amer-
ican economy. 
Unfortunately, throughout history, 
those who seek to hold back the 
progress of the Black community view 
the successes of Black entrepreneurs as 
a threat. 
One need only look to the 1921 Tulsa 
Massacre—a dark incident in our Na-
tion’s history that has belatedly en-
tered our collective consciousness. 
White 
residents 
of 
Tulsa, 
OK, 
bombed, burned, and destroyed the 
Greenwood District. In addition to an 
untold number of lives lost—estimates 
range from dozens to hundreds—the 
riot 
destroyed 
homes, 
churches, 
schools, and businesses in the district. 
At the time, Greenwood was known as 
‘‘Black Wall Street’’ due to its thriving 
Black middle class and successful busi-
nesses, and its destruction was one of 
the worst instances of racial violence 
in our Nation’s history. 
It is with instances like Greenwood 
and the dozens like it in mind that I 
stand here today because while Black 
entrepreneurs no longer work under 
the threat of such violence, they still 
face many longstanding systemic bar-
riers. 
My late friend and mentor, former 
Congressman Parren J. Mitchell, be-
lieved very strongly that the Federal 
Government had an important role to 
play in our efforts to right these his-
torical injustices and support Black en-
trepreneurs. 
In 
1977, 
Congressman 
MITCHELL 
fought to pass an amendment to a $4 
billion Federal public works program 
requiring city and State recipients to 
set aside 10 percent of the funds for mi-
nority-owned businesses. He would go 
on to call the amendment his proudest 
congressional accomplishment. 
I was incredibly proud last year to 
build on his legacy by working across 
the aisle and finally codifying the Mi-
nority Business Development Agency, 
MBDA, and giving the agency the re-
sources and leadership necessary to 
help 
support 
entrepreneurs 
in 
the 
Black and other minority commu-
nities. 
This accomplishment is particularly 
important in Maryland, as the Pre-
siding Officer knows, since we are the 
home to the highest concentration of 
minority-owned businesses in the coun-
try. 
While we have made progress, we 
must also continue working together 
to address these systemic inequities. 
At the height of the pandemic, we 
came together to create the Paycheck 
Protection Program, the PPP program, 
and we worked in a bipartisan manner 
to improve the program once it became 
clear that it was leaving far too many 
of our most vulnerable small busi-
nesses behind. 
We invested in non-bank financial in-
stitutions like the community deposi-
tory financial institutions and micro-
lenders. We strengthened relationships 
between the Small Business Adminis-
tration and our Nation’s historically 
Black colleges and universities and mi-
nority-serving institutions. We created 
grant programs that reduced structural 
barriers instead of reinforcing them. 
Recent studies have shown that these 
policies directly address the inequities 
present during the phase 1 PPP, which 
favored 
larger 
businesses. 
Through 
thoughtful policy, we made the pro-
gram more equitable with the share of 
loans made to minority-owned busi-
nesses during phases 2 and 3 of the pro-
gram in proportion with their overall 
share of small businesses. 
As I speak here today, the Senate is 
still trying to find a path forward on 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
budget, which implements many of the 
lessons we have learned over the past 2 
years. The bill contains many key pro-
visions that will provide the SBA and 
the MBDA with resources to empower 
Black entrepreneurs even more. 
For instance, the Build Back Better 
Act would create a direct loan program 
at the SBA. It would create a new Up-
lift Accelerator program to deepen the 
relationships between SBA and HBCUs, 
and it would make the SBA existing 
loan products more accessible and af-
fordable. 
The pandemic has demonstrated that 
when we come together to address the 
problems in our society free from par-
tisanship and in good faith, we are able 
to make great strides. It also confirms 
that the Federal Government has a key 
role to play in addressing the historic 
injustices that have harmed—and con-
tinue to harm—Black entrepreneurs 
and the Black community at large. 
This Black History Month, let us 
commit to pairing our words with ac-
tions, just as we did during the pan-
demic. We need to enact these proven 
policies as quickly as possible. We can-
not let this opportunity pass us by.

TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JOHN GERRARD 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to celebrate the distinguished 
career of a Nebraska public servant, 
U.S. 
District 
Court 
Judge 
John 
Gerrard.

eral bench in the District of Nebraska,

February 10, 2022 
he announced Monday that he will 
move to senior status starting next 
year. Judge Gerrard’s impressive ca-
reer has spanned more than four dec-
ades, and it is not over yet. After his 
successor is confirmed, he will remain 
on the bench with a reduced caseload. 
Judge Gerrard is a native Nebraskan. 
He grew up in Schuyler and attended 
Nebraska Wesleyan University in Lin-
coln. He left the good life, temporarily, 
to pursue an MPA at the University of 
Arizona and a JD at the University of 
the Pacific in California. 
I am grateful that he came home to 
Nebraska after law school. In 1981, 
Judge Gerrard began his career in pri-
vate practice in Norfolk. A year later, 
he also began serving as a part-time 
city attorney for the neighboring com-
munity of Battle Creek. That was the 
start of 40 years and counting of self-
less public service. 
In 1995, he was appointed to the Ne-
braska Supreme Court by then-Gov-
ernor Ben Nelson. He was just 41 years 
old at the time, making him the 
youngest-ever 
Nebraska 
Supreme 
Court Justice. 
After more than 15 years on our 
State’s highest court, he was nomi-
nated by President Obama to the Fed-
eral judgeship he holds now in 2011, 
serving as chief judge for 3 of those 
years. 
At every turn, Judge Gerrard has 
used his respect for the law to advance 
the greater good of Nebraskans and all 
Americans. During his time on the 
bench, I have appreciated hearing his 
views about many pressing judicial 
matters. His perspective as a sen-
tencing judge has also been crucial in 
helping me to unpack how proposed 
legislation in Congress would affect 
Federal judges. 
It has been an honor to know Judge 
Gerrard and to work with him for over 
a decade. He is an accomplished, 
skilled, and respected jurist, and I am 
glad that he has chosen to continue his 
service after moving to senior status. 
Everyone who knows Judge Gerrard 
can attest that his wisdom extends far 
beyond the law. He has never failed to 
impress me with his keen observations 
about life. He is a good man with a 
servant’s heart, and I am proud to call 
him a friend. 
On behalf of all Nebraskans, I would 
like to thank him for his four decades 
of dedicated public service. I look for-
ward to working with President Biden 
to confirm a district court judge who 
will live up to Judge Gerrard’s legacy 
of ruling fairly in accordance with the 
Constitution. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RED CROSS NATIONAL BLOOD SUPPLY SHORTAGE 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, last 
month, the American Red Cross began 
sounding the alarm on a national blood 
crisis, the first they have ever de-
clared. COVID–19 has added extra vola-
tility to the blood supply, and this 
shortage strains hospitals and patient 
care throughout America. 
We continue to face that critical 
blood supply shortage today, with Kan-
sas’s blood supply standing at a 1- to 2- 
day inventory. 
I have heard from medical profes-
sionals—doctors, nurses, others in Kan-
sas about the tough decisions rural 
doctors and healthcare providers are 
having to make, including canceling 
surgeries, blood transfusions, and pos-
sibly not delivering babies because 
bleeding complications may require 
blood that these facilities just don’t 
have. 
My hometown of Plainville, KS, has a 
population of about 2,000. We are fortu-
nate to have a county hospital with 
dedicated healthcare professionals and 
physicians. One of my hometown physi-
cians, Dr. Sanchez, who I am told is not 
on Facebook very often but posted his 
plea—his plea for people to donate 
blood. 
Dr. Sanchez’s Facebook post says— 
this is his story: Today we had to tell 
a patient with heart disease that the 
blood transfusions that had prolonged 
his life with marked improvement in 
quality could no longer happen at 
Rooks County Health Center. My pa-
tient and his son were understandably 
upset. It just so happens that the same 
patient was told a few days previous 
that the melanoma cancer that he beat 
for 40 years back returned. And now no 
blood transfusion. 
The doctor said that the hospital is 
considering canceling surgeries, pos-
sibly even not delivering babies. Our 
stock of common blood type A-positive 
and donor O-positive blood units are 
down over 30 percent, from six units to 
four units. Universal donor O-negative 
blood has been in short supply for 
months and maybe for years. Blood 
supplies are usually replenished at the 
American Red Cross every 3 weeks, but 
we have had no new units given or re-
placed. 
That is one doctor, one hometown, 
one hospital—but it is people. It is peo-
ple in Kansas. It is people in this coun-
try whom we know and care for, people 
we love, people in our families, and 
people we don’t even know. 
The most vulnerable patients among 
us rely on blood donations for trans-
fusions to support essential treatments 
such as those of battling cancer or liv-
ing with chronic diseases. There is no 
substitute. There is no alternative. 
Our Nation can turn to the absence of 
blood donations. The only answer is for 
each of us stepping up to donate, help-
ing to end this crisis and contribute to 
saving lives of those in our commu-
nities. 
The shortage is severe, and it is af-
fecting Kansas health providers and 
their ability to care for their patients. 
It will cost us lives. 
Kansans pull together in times of 
need, and I encourage everyone in Kan-
sas and across the country to donate. 
In the United States, every 2 seconds 
someone needs blood or platelets, and 
donating blood is one of the most tan-
gible actions we can give to help save 
lives. 
Donation centers provide specific 
guidance on blood donation process and 
safety measures taken within their 
centers. You can find a location that is 
accepting blood donations near you, 
and you can visit the American Red 
Cross website. 
So this is a plea that we all consider 
donating blood to help save the lives of 
our friends, our neighbors, and our fel-
low Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO DON NEAGLE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
after more than six decades as a staple 
of Logan County radio, Don Neagle is 
retiring this year. As the host of the 
WRUS morning show and the ‘‘Feed-
back’’ program, Don brings high-qual-
ity news to his community, inter-
viewing everyone from politicians, to 
writers, to theologians. As one local 
leader put it so aptly, Don is Logan 
County’s ‘‘bulletin board,’’ relaying all 
of his community’s most important 
news in one place. Today, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring Don in 
his retirement. 
For decades, Don arrived at his office 
every weekday at 4:15 am, preparing 
the day’s news while most listeners 
were still fast asleep. By the time 
Logan County residents were on their 
morning commute, he was already half-
way through his workday. Through his 
incredible work ethic and scrappy 
style, Don stayed ahead of breaking 
news and at the pinnacle of Kentucky 
journalism. 
Don is a legendary interviewer, and 
his ‘‘Feedback’’ show is the highlight 
of WRUS’s entire programming lineup. 
Any leader in Kentucky government, 
myself included, knows that it’s basi-
cally a requirement to be interviewed

by Don when visiting Logan County. I 
have had the pleasure of speaking to 
him many times, and it is always an 
enlightening conversation full of in-
formed, probing questions. 
Don’s 
calm, 
constant 
voice 
has 
earned him many fans across the Com-
monwealth. He joined the Kentucky 
Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2005 and 
the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame 
in 2006, demonstrating that his influ-
ence reaches far beyond Logan Coun-
ty’s borders. While his skill brought 
him acclaim from around Kentucky, he 
never strayed in his commitment to his 
Logan County home. Don’s career was 
more than just a job; he formed a deep 
bond with Logan County, and even 
after six decades, he seems loath to 
give it up. 
Though Don is taking a step back 
from his expansive role at WRUS, he 
will remain at the station for the time 
being as host of ‘‘Feedback’’ and an oc-
casional guest interviewer. In the 
meantime, he will have more time to 
spend with his two daughters, six 
grandchildren, and six great-grand-
children. He will also be able to pursue 
his favorite lifelong pastime, reading, 
with new gusto. 
In honor of Don’s retirement, I would 
like to thank him for his service to the 
Commonwealth and unflagging loyalty 
to strong local journalism. He has de-
livered an invaluable service to Logan 
County residents for more than 60 
years, and we will all miss his ever- 
present voice. 
Mr. President, Bowling Green Daily 
News paid tribute to Don’s career in a 
recent article. I ask unanimous con-
sent the article be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Bowling Green Daily News, Jan. 31, 
2022] 
‘VOICE OF LOGAN COUNTY’ ANNOUNCES 
RETIREMENT 
Logan County residents have trusted Don 
Neagle as their source of news for more than 
63 years. But on Jan. 27, the hall of fame 
broadcaster and journalist announced his ca-
reer was coming to an end. 
While he will continue to host his popular 
show ‘‘Feedback’’ and will conduct other 
interviews for WRUS radio, Neagle is perma-
nently stepping away from his duties as 
morning host. 
At 84 years old, Neagle said the decision to 
retire was mostly because of health con-
cerns. 
‘‘I have shingles, and I’m awfully uncom-
fortable now. I’m dealing with back problems 
as well. I thought this would be an ideal time 
to cut back,’’ Neagle said. ‘‘It’s just an obvi-
ous time to wrap it up. My wife died three 
years ago, and she always said that when it 
was time to retire—you’ll know it. And I 
know it now.’’ 
Neagle joined WRUS on Sept. 1, 1958, after 
a stint at WKCT-AM in Bowling Green. 
Over the course of his career in Russell-
ville, Neagle has interviewed political fig-
ures, 
Pulitzer 
Prize-winning 
writers, 
theologians and newsmakers of all types. He 
has earned several honors, including his in-
duction into the Kentucky Broadcasters Hall 
of Fame in 2005 and the Kentucky Jour-
nalism Hall of Fame in 2006. 
Neagle said what he will miss most about 
his time as morning host is bringing the 
news to Logan County. 
‘‘I enjoyed promoting activities in our 
community and particularly in our African 
American community,’’ Neagle said. ‘‘I real-
ly enjoyed breaking news stories. We also 
put our obituaries right in the front of our 
newscast. We wanted people to know that in-
formation.’’ 
In 
2002, 
Neagle 
partnered 
with 
Bill 
McGinnis and Chris McGinnis to form Logan 
Radio Inc. and purchase WRUS. 
Chris McGinnis will take over the WRUS 
morning show on an interim basis, while the 
search begins for a permanent host. He told 
the Daily News that Neagle was viewed wide-
ly across the state as ‘‘the voice of Logan 
County.’’ 
‘‘He became the local trusted source for 
news and information here,’’ Chris McGinnis 
said. ‘‘Don earned the trust of the commu-
nity. Through the years, Don Neagle was 
that constant voice that soothed the commu-
nity. He became that comfort voice.’’ 
Chris McGinnis described Neagle as a man 
of faith who was very educated, addicted to 
reading books and still a bit shy. 
‘‘You will not ever find a more gentle spir-
it than Don,’’ he said. ‘‘He is an individual 
that cares and wants the best for everyone. 
He is quick to lift up everyone. It’s hard to 
put into words what a kind spirit he is.’’ 
Neagle confirmed his love for reading and 
said in retirement he hopes to become a 
night owl who stays up late with his nose in 
a good book. 
He said his love for reading first came from 
his parents while he grew up in rural Green 
County. Neagle would go on to be valedic-
torian of his high school class. 
Besides reading, Neagle said he is looking 
forward to spending more time with his 
friends and family. 
He had two daughters, and his late wife, 
Vivian Gray Neagle, had two sons. Alto-
gether, Neagle said he has six grandchildren 
and six great-grandchildren. 
Neagle specifically thanked his daughter 
Lisa Whitt, his granddaughter Anna Haley 
and the people of Oak Grove Baptist Church 
for their support during his career. 
‘‘I’m looking forward to having a quiet 
life,’’ Neagle said. ‘‘I got all the traveling 
out of the way with my wife. I’m looking for-
ward to dealing with my pain and living in 
peace with those who have been just so good 
to me.’’ 
Retired Logan County Circuit and Ken-
tucky Supreme Court Judge William Fuqua 
said he has been doing an oral history pro-
gram every Thursday morning with Neagle 
for over 25 years. 
Fuqua told the Daily News that Neagle’s 
knowledge 
would 
be 
‘‘irreplaceable’’ 
to 
Logan County. 
‘‘I call him the community morning bul-
letin board,’’ Fuqua said with a laugh. ‘‘He is 
always accessible. He is a class guy, who 
loves his job and is dependable in every way 
I know. He is a keystone of the community. 
People stop me on the street and ask me 
about Don. I can’t say enough good things 
about him.’’ 
As he now heads into what Neagle hopes is 
a peaceful retirement, the man who spent 
more than half a century informing Russell-
ville and Logan County leaves with a word of 
thanks to his listeners. 
‘‘I’ve enjoyed the support from the peo-
ple,’’ Neagle said. ‘‘For the most part, they 
have been very kind to me. I love and respect 
them very much.’’ 
f 
ENDING FORCED ARBITRATION OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT ACT 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I was proud to support and cosponsor S. 
2342, the Ending Forced Arbitration of 
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act of 2021. This bill is critically im-
portant in supporting survivors who 
have experienced sexual assault and 
sexual harassment in the workplace. 
Forced arbitration clauses have be-
come increasingly common in employ-
ment contracts. According to the Eco-
nomic Policy Institute, 56.2 percent of 
private sector, nonunion workers are 
subject to forced arbitration. That 
means approximately 60 million work-
ers in the United States are denied the 
right to have their employment cases 
heard by a court. 
When it comes to matters of sexual 
assault and sexual harassment, forced 
arbitration clauses protect predators 
and prevent survivors from seeking jus-
tice in the courts for the wrongs they 
have experienced. 
This practice of forced arbitration is 
deeply 
concerning. 
Employees 
are 
often not aware that their employment 
contracts contain arbitration clauses, 
and they often do not understand their 
effect. Scholars have estimated that 98 
percent of workers will abandon their 
legal claims instead of pursuing them 
through the arbitration process. Em-
ployees who choose to arbitrate are 
then forced to use company-appointed 
arbitrators and are not able to appeal 
the decisions. 
Even more troubling, forced arbitra-
tion clauses have been used to silence 
survivors of workplace sexual assault 
and sexual harassment, and that is un-
acceptable. 
This bill will help protect the rights 
of survivors by allowing courts to in-
validate 
forced 
arbitration 
clauses 
when the case involves sexual assault 
or harassment. This will ensure that 
survivors can bring their claims in 
court if they choose to do so. 
I am proud to cosponsor this bipar-
tisan bill, and I am happy to see my 
colleagues overwhelmingly support it 
on the floor today. 
f 
ENDING FORCED ARBITRATION OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL 
HARRASSMENT ACT 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to be clear, there is noth-
ing in the bill requiring any court to 
adopt new dismissal mechanisms for 
victims’ claims. How and when a case 
moves forward is by virtue of current 
existing State or Federal law. There is 
no new mechanism in this bill to allow 
for dismissal, and there is no reason to 
require victims to have to prove a sex-
ual assault or harassment claim prior 
to trial or have it go back through a 
forced arbitration process. Civil assault 
and battery claims are very difficult to 
prove under especially arcane State 
laws. But this bill allows any conduct 
alleging a violation of those laws, and 
any claims related to such conduct, to 
move forward together in one case.

f 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND HON-
ORING 
BRIGADIER 
GENERAL 
CHARLES E. MCGEE AND STAFF 
SERGEANT WAVERLY B. WOOD-
SON, JR. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as 
we celebrate Black History Month, I 
rise today to honor two American he-
roes from our Greatest Generation: 
Brigadier General Charles E. McGee 
and Staff Sergeant Waverly B. Wood-
son, Jr. 
McGee was a Tuskegee Airman who 
passed away peacefully in his home in 
Bethesda, MD, on January 16, 2021. He 
was 102. Woodson, an Army medic as-
signed to the 320th Barrage Balloon 
Battalion, landed on Omaha Beach on 
D-day and saved the lives of as many as 
200 soldiers over the next 30 hours of 
continuous duty. 
Both of these Marylanders fought 
with valor and distinction on behalf of 
a Nation that discriminated against 
them. 
Brigadier General McGee’s incandes-
cent spirit, courage, and resolve led us 
to victory through some of our darkest 
times. He has left lasting impact on 
our country as a pilot, patriot, and 
civil rights advocate. He was born on 
December 7, 1919, in Cleveland, OH. His 
mother died soon after. His father, who 
was a minister, teacher, and social 
worker, moved the family frequently 
during McGee’s childhood in search of 
work opportunities that were not easy 
to come by. Despite this adversity, 
McGee graduated from high school in 
Chicago in 1938 and joined the Civilian 
Conservation Corps, CCC. 
McGee used the money he made in 
the CCC to help pay for college, attend-
ing the University of Illinois as an 
ROTC student. 
When we look at the extraordinary 
life of Charles McGee, one thing is ex-
plicitly clear: No matter how dan-
gerous or difficult the call, if his coun-
try needed him, he always answered. 
This inspiring pattern of behavior 
started during his sophomore year in 
college when, on McGee’s 22nd birth-
day, Japanese forces attacked Pearl 
Harbor. McGee began searching for a 
way to serve in the war. After he heard 
that President Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt had authorized a unit of Black 
soldiers to train as pilots in the Army 
Air Corps, he applied and to start flight 
training at the Tuskegee Army Field in 
Alabama and was accepted. 
Charles McGee battled racial dis-
crimination 
but 
completed 
flight 
school as 1 of only 1,000 pilots, earning 
his spot as a Tuskegee Airman in the 
first-of-its-kind, all-Black 332nd Fight-
er group. In 1944, just a year after grad-
uating, he deployed to Italy as a fight-
er pilot in World War II. He moved up 
the ranks quickly, from lieutenant to 
captain. McGee’s squadron was respon-
sible for escorting heavy bombers of 
the 15th Air Force across Europe and 
for 
target-of-opportunity 
missions. 
McGee flew 136 missions across Europe. 
Our victory in World War II, however, 
was not the end of McGee’s service. He 
remained in the Army Corps and the 
Air Force for another 30 years, flying 
in both the Korean and the Vietnam 
wars. He tallied a record of 409 aerial 
fighter 
combat 
missions 
over 
the 
course of three wars. In 2020, McGee re-
ceived an honorary promotion to briga-
dier general. 
While there are few individuals living 
or dead who have had careers as suc-
cessful 
or 
significant 
as 
Charles 
McGee’s, what made him so remark-
able was his undying positive attitude 
and kind nature, even in the most try-
ing situations. As a member of the 
Tuskegee Airmen, he was constantly 
subject to racial discrimination, both 
in the military and back home where 
Jim Crow Laws prevailed. In an essay 
McGee penned for the Smithsonian Na-
tional Air and Space Museum, he 
wrote, ‘‘The prevailing opinion was 
that blacks did not possess the intel-
ligence or courage to be military pi-
lots. One general even said, ‘The Negro 
type has not the proper reflexes to 
make a first-rate fighter pilot.’ The 
Tuskegee Airmen certainly proved men 
like him wrong.’’ 
Until 
the 
day 
he 
passed 
away, 
Charles McGee educated others about 
the Black experience during this time 
and spoke of the ‘‘equality of oppor-
tunity’’ that he and the Tuskegee Air-
men valiantly fought to achieve. 
I am humbled and proud to call 
Charles McGee a fellow Marylander. 
His daughters Charlene McGee Smith 
and Yvonne McGee, 10 grandchildren, 
14 great-grandchildren, and a great- 
great-grandchild survive him. His leg-
acy is intertwined with our Nation’s 
legacy. He is a true American hero. 
Waverly Bernard Woodson, Jr., is an-
other true American hero. He was born 
on August 3, 1922, in Philadelphia and 
attended Lincoln University in Oxford, 
Pa, where he was a pre-med student. 
McGee enlisted in the Army 8 days 
after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He 
joined the anti-aircraft artillery Offi-
cer Candidate School after scoring 
highly on a test, where he was one of 
only two Black Americans. He learned, 
however, that he could not become an 
officer because of his race. He trained 
as a combat medic at Camp Tyson in 
Paris, TN, where he experienced seg-
regation and discrimination. He was 
assigned to the 320th Barrage Balloon 
Battalion, reaching the rank of cor-
poral by the time Operation Overlord 
commenced. 
On D-day, the 320th Barrage Balloon 
Battalion was the only African-Amer-
ican battalion to participate. While 
Corporal Woodson was coming ashore 
at Omaha Beach, his landing craft 
tank—LCT—hit a naval mine and then 
was hit by an ‘‘eighty-eight’’ shell. 
Woodson suffered shrapnel injuries to 
his groin, inner thigh, and back. Once 
he reached shore and received treat-
ment for his wounds, he set up a first- 
aid station and began treating other 
wounded soldiers. He worked continu-
ously from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. on the 
following day, setting fractured limbs, 
removing bullets, amputating a foot, 
dispensing plasma, and reviving three 
men who nearly drowned while exiting 
their LCT; Woodson provided artificial 
respiration to the three men, reviving 
them. 
Woodson’s commanding officer rec-
ommended him for a Distinguished 
Service Cross for his actions, but the 
office of General John C. H. Lee deter-
mined that Woodson’s actions war-
ranted the greater honor of a Medal of 
Honor. U.S. Department of War special 
assistant to the director Philleo Nash 
proposed that President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt should give Woodson the 
award personally. Woodson ultimately 
received a Bronze Star Medal and a 
Purple Heart. The Philadelphia Trib-
une wrote, ‘‘The feeling is prevalent 
among Negroes that had Woodson been 
of another race the highest honor 
would have been granted him.’’ 
After World War II ended, Woodson 
hoped to study medicine, but was un-
able to find a medical school that 
would admit him as a Black American. 
He returned to Lincoln University 
and graduated with a degree in biology 
in 1950. Woodson served in the Korean 
war, initially training combat medics 
before running an Army morgue. He 
served in the United Kingdom, France, 
and the Asia-Pacific. Within the United 
States, he also served at Fort George 
G. Meade, Valley Forge General Hos-
pital, the Communicable Disease Cen-
ter, and Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center. 
Woodson left the Army in 1952 with a 
final rank of staff sergeant. After leav-
ing the Army, Woodson went on to 
work in the bacteriology department of 
the National Naval Medical Center. In 
1959, he began working in the clinical 
pathology department of the National 
Institutes of Health until he retired in 
1980.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

February 10, 2022 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Woodson 
married 
Joann Katharyne Snowden in 1952; the 
couple had two daughters and a son. He 
died in 2005 and was buried with mili-
tary honors in Arlington National 
Cemetery. 
Last month, I joined Senator VAN 
HOLLEN and Representative TRONE in 
writing to Army Secretary Christine 
Wormuth to request that an award de-
cision authority formally review and 
consider awarding the Medal of Honor 
to Waverly B. Woodson, Jr., post-
humously. In June 2021, Commanding 
General of the First United States 
Army Thomas S. James, Jr., wrote in 
favor of Woodson receiving the Medal 
of Honor. 
Woodson’s widow Joann announced 
that if he were to receive the Medal of 
Honor posthumously, she would donate 
it to the Smithsonian’s National Mu-
seum of African American History and 
Culture. 
These stories are just two examples 
of Black-American soldiers who fought 
to defeat fascism during World War II 
while simultaneously enduring virulent 
racial discrimination as servicemen 
and back home in America as civilians. 
After the Civil War and Reconstruc-
tion, powerful White officials in south-
ern States sought to nullify the polit-
ical outcome of the Civil War. They 
passed laws and instituted policies that 
enforced segregation. 
We all know those laws: the Jim 
Crow laws, the Black Codes, the insti-
tutionalized segregation. The intent 
was to disenfranchise minority voters 
with poll taxes and literacy tests and 
voter intimidation. 
Thanks to courageous leaders, we 
were able to reverse those laws. Presi-
dent Harry Truman integrated our 
military in 1948. Then, there was the 
landmark decision in 1954 of Brown v. 
Board of Education. We Marylanders 
are proud of Thurgood Marshall, a na-
tive son, with respect to the role that 
he played in arguing that case before 
the Supreme Court. In 1964, Congress 
passed the Civil Rights Act and fol-
lowed that historic legislation with the 
Voting Rights Act in 1965 and the Fair 
Housing Act in 1968. 
Black Americans and other people of 
color have fought and died to preserve 
our freedom. As we celebrate Black 
History Month, if we want to honor 
Brigadier General Charles E. McGee 
and Staff Sergeant Waverly B. Wood-
son, Jr., and countless others like 
them, we need to continue to expand 
equal opportunity in America, and we 
can start by passing voting rights leg-
islation, the need for which I have fre-
quently spoken about on the Senate 
floor.

FLOOR VOTES 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that this letter be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, February 2, 2022. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: As you know, 
despite our collective efforts to encourage 
Members to vote on the Senate floor in a 
timely manner, votes are often left open well 
beyond the allotted time, frustrating a ma-
jority of Members from both sides of the 
aisle. Often, the outcome of the vote is not 
in doubt. 
With this in mind and in order to expedite 
floor votes, we are instructing the Presiding 
Officer to close any vote in which: (a) one of 
the signatories below is the last remaining 
vote; and (b) the Member’s vote would not 
change the outcome. However, on any par-
ticular vote, if a signatory requests that the 
vote be held open, they may do so by pro-
viding notice to their Cloakroom.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING CRUISE CUSTOMS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Cruise Cus-
toms of Shepherdsville, KY, as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
It is not every week that I have the 
privilege of honoring a veteran-owned 
small business, but when I do, it is with 
profound respect and gratitude not 
only for this Kentucky entrepreneur, 
but for our men and women in uniform. 
Cruise Customs was started by Chris 
Cruise, a veteran paratrooper who 
served in the 82nd Airborne Division 
during Operation Iraqi Freedom. After 
serving his country, like many vet-
erans, Chris Cruise returned to the U.S. 
carrying with him the traumas of war. 
Woodworking became a sort of therapy 
for him, and he combined that passion 
for working with his hands with his 
deeply rooted patriotism and founded 
Cruise Customs in 2017. 
Cruise Customs not only honors the 
great Nation that we live in, it also 
pays tribute to the wonderful State of 
Kentucky. The idea behind his business 
came from Chris and his wife Amber’s 
desire to create something that hon-
ored both the Nation that he fought for 
and his wife’s native State. The final 
product was a large American flag con-
structed from the wood used in old 
Kentucky bourbon barrels. While bour-
bon-barrel flags continue to be their 
most popular item, the business has ex-
panded their scope of products offered. 
The Cruises’ patriotic mission has re-
mained at the heart of their business 
throughout its steady growth, as they 
broadened their service to the veteran 
community and to their local area 
when Cruise Customs’ unique crafts-
manship gained national recognition. 
The whole Cruise Customs team use 
their dedication for service as inspira-
tion for designing new products. These 
days, one can buy Chris’ signature 
bourbon-barrel flag not only in a vari-
ety of sizes, one can also find various 
flags with a different colored stripe 
running through the center of the flag. 
The colors symbolize the business’ sup-
port for various causes: blue, in honor 
of our Nation’s police officers; red, to 
show their support for our Nation’s fire 
fighters; pink, to spread breast cancer 
awareness and to champion its sur-
vivors. While these limited edition 
pieces stand out against their array of 
merchandise, the America ‘‘One Heart-
beat’’ 
flag 
is 
perhaps 
their 
most 
impactful creation. 
Their America ‘‘One Heartbeat’’ flag, 
a limited edition piece displaying the 
EKG sign of a heartbeat down the cen-
ter stripe, was designed by Chris and 
Amber Cruise during the early days of 
the pandemic. Always wanting to give 
back to their community, Cruise Cus-
toms donated all proceeds from the 
sale of their America ‘‘One Heartbeat’’ 
flags to the medical frontline heroes at 
Norton Healthcare and U of L Health 
in Louisville. This noble idea quickly 
gained national attention, which al-
lowed Cruise Customs to sell over 4,500 
of these flags and donate over $70,000 to 
their local medical community. 
Cruise Customs’ dedication to their 
community has not gone unnoticed. 
Last year, Chris Cruise was named one 
of Louisville Business First’s Business 
Impact Award Nominees. Chris and 
Amber Cruise have also broadened 
their venture by opening and co-
directing Kentucky’s first local chap-
ter of USA Cares, a nonprofit dedicated

to ‘‘providing military families with fi-
nancial and advocacy support during 
their time of need.’’ From serving his 
country, to founding a small business 
dedicated to giving back to the veteran 
community, Chris has consistently dis-
played a generous and patriotic spirit 
which permeates throughout his busi-
ness and his family. Congratulations to 
Chris and Amber Cruise and the entire 
Cruise Customs team. I thank you for 
your brave service to this country and 
for your charitable spirit. I wish them 
the best of luck and look forward to 
watching their continued growth and 
success in Kentucky.∑

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
511—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT ESTABLISHING A 
REGIONAL NUCLEAR FUEL BANK 
WOULD ASSIST INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS TO AVOID A DESTA-
BILIZING ARMS RACE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST AND WOULD PRO-
MOTE THE PEACEFUL USE OF 
NUCLEAR POWER 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
GRAHAM) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 511 
Whereas the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), on October 17, 2019, estab-
lished and began operating a Low Enriched 
Uranium 
(LEU) 
Bank 
in 
Oskemen, 
Kazakhstan; 
Whereas the IAEA LEU Bank currently has 
physical stock of 90 metric tons of low en-
riched uranium hexafluoride suitable to 
make fuel for nuclear power reactors world-
wide; 
Whereas the IAEA Bank mission is to en-
sure member states of the IAEA are able to 
obtain fuel for their reactors if there is a dis-
ruption in their existing fuel supply arrange-
ments and LEU cannot be obtained by any 
other means; 
Whereas a member state of the IAEA who 
wants to buy LEU from the fuel Bank must 
be in compliance with all of their nuclear 
safeguard agreements and not under inves-
tigation by the IAEA Board of Governors; 
Whereas the establishment and operation 
of the IAEA LEU Bank is fully funded by 
voluntary contributions; 
Whereas these voluntary contributions 
have come from the United States, the Euro-
pean Union, Kuwait, the United Arab Emir-
ates (UAE) , and non-government actors such 
as the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI); 
Whereas, in April 2009, President of Iran 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad welcomed the then 
proposal to set up a global nuclear fuel re-
pository, under strict international controls; 
Whereas, in an April 2005 statement at the 
IAEA, the Islamic Republic of Iran said it 
will only pursue nuclear activities in the 
peaceful domain, and the Leader of the Is-
lamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
Ayatollah 
Ali 
Khamenei had issued a fatwa that the pro-
duction, stockpiling, and use of nuclear 
weapons are forbidden under Islam and that 
the Islamic Republic of Iran shall never ac-
quire these weapons; 
Whereas the provision of LEU fuel enables 
a state to forgo domestic uranium enrich-
ment and reprocessing for commercial nu-
clear reactors; 
Whereas the UAE has successfully devel-
oped commercial nuclear power without a 
domestic capability to enrich uranium or re-
process spent fuel; 
Whereas many states in the Middle East 
are seeking to establish commercial nuclear 
power reactors to supply power to their elec-
trical grid; 
Whereas the development of uranium en-
richment and reprocessing capabilities in-
creases the proliferation risk associated with 
nuclear technology, materials, and weapons; 
and 
Whereas Iran’s nuclear program is leading 
other Middle East states to consider how to 
match Iran’s enrichment capabilities: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the establishment of a regional nuclear 
fuel bank, or a rules modification and expan-
sion of the existing LEU Bank, in coordina-
tion with other international actors, should 
be part of a comprehensive plan for con-
fronting nuclear nonproliferation in the Mid-
dle East; 
(2) the United States should implement a 
policy that guarantees that any Middle East 
state that forgoes domestic uranium enrich-
ment and reprocessing will be able to pur-
chase fuel for their commercial nuclear reac-
tors from an international nuclear fuel bank; 
(3) in order to expand the existing IAEA 
LEU Bank or establish a new regional nu-
clear fuel bank, the United States should 
provide technical experience and funds and 
should encourage others to make financial 
donations to such bank; 
(4) the United States should seek bilateral 
and multilateral nuclear cooperation agree-
ments with various Middle Eastern states, 
including Iran, pursuant to section 123 of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153) 
(‘‘123 agreements’’) that include the adoption 
of 
IAEA 
Additional 
Protocols 
for 
verification of nuclear safeguards that in-
clude a commitment by states to forgo do-
mestic uranium enrichment and reprocessing 
of spent fuel; 
(5) if Iran enters into and implements a nu-
clear agreement in which it forgoes domestic 
uranium enrichment and reprocessing of 
spent fuel, the United States should commit 
to and provide sanctions relief beyond that 
agreed to in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action (JCPOA) signed at Vienna on July 14, 
2015, by Iran and by France, Germany, the 
Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of 
China, the European Union, the United King-
dom, and the United States; 
(6) any such sanctions relief should include 
the termination of certain United States 
‘‘primary’’ sanctions, as appropriate, but 
other United States sanctions should remain 
in place until Iran verifiably ceases its ma-
lign activity, including its support for ter-
rorism, its human rights abuses, its hostage- 
taking, and its destabilizing activities in the 
region, and refrains from resuming such ac-
tivities; and 
(7) any international agreement limiting 
Iran’s nuclear program and providing sanc-
tions relief to which the United States is a 
signatory should be submitted to the Senate 
for its advice and consent to ratification pur-
suant to Article II of the Constitution.

S. RES. 467 
Whereas the Department of Defense began 
developing the Arecibo Observatory located 
in Barrio Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, 
during the 1950s, and its characteristic in-
strument, a large radio telescope of 305 me-
ters in diameter was completed in 1963; 
Whereas the facility was later owned by 
the National Science Foundation, and sup-
ported by the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration and various university 
partners; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory’s 305- 
meter fixed spherical radio telescope, was 
the world’s largest single-dish radio tele-
scope until the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture 
Spherical Radio Telescope located in Gizhou, 
China, began observing in 2016; 
Whereas the 305-meter radio telescope 
made unparalleled contributions to the fields 
of radio astronomy, planetary, and atmos-
pheric sciences, and played a role in inspir-
ing thousands of students in Puerto Rico, the 
Nation, and the world to pursue careers in 
STEM fields through the Arecibo Observ-
atory Education and Public Outreach Pro-
grams; 
Whereas the radio telescope significantly 
advanced the field of radio astronomy, in-
cluding the first indirect detection of gravi-
tational 
waves, 
the 
first 
detection 
of 
extrasolar planets, innumerable contribu-
tions to the field of time domain astronomy 
and the study of the interstellar medium, 
and played a key role in the search for extra-
terrestrial intelligence; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory had the 
best planetary radar system in the world, 
used by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration for near-Earth object detec-
tion and was a part of the agency’s planetary 
defense program; 
Whereas the planetary radar at the Are-
cibo Observatory has contributed fundamen-
tally and significantly to the knowledge of 
the solar system; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory’s Inco-
herent Scatter Radar and supporting facili-
ties 
have 
provided 
fundamental 
under-
standing of the ionosphere and upper atmos-
phere, and the interface between the atmos-
phere and space that protects the planet 
from solar wind, meteors, and other poten-
tial threats; and 
Whereas December 1, 2021, marks the 1- 
year anniversary of the uncontrolled col-
lapse sustained by the radio telescope after a 
series of cable failures in tower 4: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) acknowledges the loss of the Arecibo 
Observatory’s radio telescope due to its col-
lapse and its implications for the loss of a 
unique world-class multidisciplinary science 
facility which conducted research in the 
areas of space and atmospheric sciences, 
radar astronomy and planetary sciences, as-
tronomy, and astrophysics; 
(2) acknowledges that the uncontrolled col-
lapse of the 305-meter radio telescope rep-
resents a remarkable loss of astronomical 
observation capabilities, scientific research 
and development, planetary defense capabili-
ties, and applied science advantage for the 
United States; 
(3) recognizes the rich scientific, edu-
cational, and economic benefits that the 
Arecibo Telescope has made to the people of 
Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world; 
(4) recognizes the work and contributions 
made by the thousands of dedicated staff 
who have supported the Arecibo Observatory 
for close to 6 decades; 
(5) commends the National Science Foun-
dation for convening a virtual workshop in 
June 2021, to explore ideas for future sci-
entific and educational activities at the Are-
cibo Observatory; and 
(6) encourages the National Science Foun-
dation, in consultation with the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and 
other agencies to study means of replacing 
the scientific capabilities that were lost at 
the Arecibo Observatory, utilizing new state- 
of-the-art technologies at the site.
