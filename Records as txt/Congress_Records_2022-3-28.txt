DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, unite us in Yourself. And 
in that union, may we find mutual 
comfort in Your loving embrace and 
the desire to share together in Your 
spirit. May our manner reflect Your 
tenderness and our motive reflect Your 
compassion. In so doing, may we make 
Your joy and Your satisfaction in us 
complete. 
Reveal to us how like-minded we are, 
despite the wide variety of opinions 
and passions. Remind us that we each 
belong to You, even more than to our 
allegiances and associations. Cause us 
to reflect how we each have received 
the bounty of Your love, no one of us 
more so than another. 
In our interactions, may we be ves-
sels of that same love, acknowledging 
that both our spirits and minds should 
be filled with Your own. 
Do not allow our self-ambition or 
vain conceit to govern our actions, but 
humble us that we would esteem and 
uphold all others above ourselves. 
Prevent us from appealing only to 
our own interests, but lift up our eyes 
that we each would take the time to 
attend to the welfare of all those with 
and for whom You have called us to 
serve. 
For You have shown us the example 
of selfless service. In this may we find 
our inspiration this day. 
We offer our prayer in the strength of 
Your name. 
Amen.

f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. FOSTER led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has passed bills of the fol-
lowing titles in which the concurrence 
of the House is requested: 
S. 253. An act to expand research on the 
cannabidiol and marihuana. 
S. 2102. An act to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to direct the Under Secretary 
for Health of the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs to provide mammography screening for 
veterans who served in locations associated 
with toxic exposure. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
PROUD OF 360 YOUTH SERVICES 
(Mr. FOSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, for 
decades, the issue of homeless LGBTQ- 
plus youth hasn’t gotten the attention 
it deserves, even as it is estimated they 
make up between 20 and 40 percent of 
all homeless youth in the United 
States. 
That is why I am so proud that the 
Federal omnibus recently passed by 
Congress included $3 billion for 360 
Youth Services in Naperville so that 
they can launch a youth-affordable 
housing resource center to provide 
youth-specific housing and homeless-
ness prevention services in DuPage, 
Kane, Will, and surrounding counties. 
In the 11th Congressional District, we 
value our young people of all gender 
identities and sexual orientations. I am 
proud of what 360 Youth Services has 
planned for this funding. 
Altogether, our office secured nearly 
$19 
million 
for 
very 
worthwhile 
projects in Illinois’ 11th Congressional 
District that will benefit our entire 
community. This will be taxpayer 
money well spent. 
f 
SECRETARY WALSH IS A BAD- 
FAITH ACTOR 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Labor 
Secretary Marty Walsh needs to re-
member that he is a Cabinet member, 
not an activist. His one-sided involve-
ment in active labor disputes is unfair 
and unprecedented. 
He is a former union president and 
the first union member in nearly half a 
century to lead the Department of

Labor. If you believe he can be an im-
partial arbiter, then I have swampland 
in New Mexico to sell you. The head of 
the AFL–CIO herself expressed ap-
proval of Walsh’s willingness to work 
‘‘behind the scenes.’’ 
Walsh’s infamous picket line partici-
pation with strikers at the Kellogg’s 
factory won’t be his last attempt to 
interfere with labor-management dis-
putes. Politico recently reported Walsh 
is ‘‘eager to help with others.’’ 
Walsh’s pro-union advocacy disquali-
fies him from acting as an honest 
broker. He would rather protect his 
union boss cronies than protect work-
ers and job creators. 
f 
OUR ECONOMY IS STRONGER 
THAN EVER 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the country’s tremen-
dous economic improvements. 
While our economy is stronger than 
ever, the America COMPETES Act will 
strengthen the economy even more in 
the near future. But one key economic 
accomplishment during Biden’s first 
year I would like to highlight is the 
large budget deficit decrease he pro-
duced. 
In his first year, the deficit decreased 
by $360 billion. That is an average drop 
of $30 billion each month. That is huge. 
This is a night-and-day difference 
from the past administration, which 
only increased the budget deficit year 
after year during his time in office. But 
even better, Biden is on track to reduce 
the deficit by more than $1 trillion this 
year. This is truly remarkable. 
We really are building a better Amer-
ica for generations to come. 
f 
VICTORY FOR UKRAINE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, Ukraine, led by President 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is winning and 
will be victorious over Putin. Biden 
must send military aid now. 
The ruse provided by incompetent 
Russian generals to claim eastern 
Ukraine is a trick. Just as America 
would not surrender by giving up a 
small part of the Eastern United 
States, such as Delaware, we know 
Putin must be defeated by peace 
through strength. 
Victory is the only option to stop au-
tocracy by rule of gun against democ-
racy by rule of law, a clash of civiliza-
tions. The Chinese Communist Party 
will be stopped from mass murder in 
Taiwan. 
Iranian 
mullahs 
will 
be 
stopped from vaporizing the people of 
Israel. The world’s largest democracy 
of India can thrive in a stabilized 
world. 
I have faith in the Russian people, a 
great culture with great cultural influ-
ence adopted in America. There is leg-
islation for defecting Russian troops, 
diplomats, and Duma members to be 
provided immediate refugee status to 
America and up to $100,000 for any Rus-
sian military equipment turned over to 
Ukraine. 
God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. 
Long live Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

CONGRATULATING 
IOWA’S 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
BASKETBALL 
ALL- 
STATE HONOREES 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
achievements of several young men 
from Iowa’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Earlier this month, the Iowa high 
school basketball State championships 
were held in Des Moines. It was a week-
end of competition and sportsmanship. 
While no school from the Second Dis-
trict won the championship, several 
young men recently earned all-State 
honors from the Des Moines Register. 
Dayton Davis of Fort Madison and 
Shawn Gilbert of Central DeWitt were 
named to the Class 3A team. Eric 
Mulder of Pella Christian was named to 
the Class 2A team, and Maddox Griffin 
of Wapello was named to the Class 1A 
team. 
In addition, Kaden Hall of English 
Valleys, Carter Harmsen of Mid-Prai-
rie, Karl Miller of Pella, Pete Moe of 
Iowa City West, and Blaise Porter of 
New London earned honorable mention 
recognition. 
Congratulations to all of these young 
men, teams, families, schools, and 
communities on achieving these hon-
ors. They are all well deserved. 
Madam Speaker, I also knowledge 
that tomorrow, March 29, my daughter, 
Taylor Miller-Meeks, was born, which 
was one of the best days of my life. 
f 
BIDEN FOOD INSECURITY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to talk about the situation 
we have with agriculture and water in 
California and the President’s acknowl-
edgment just a couple of days ago that 
we are going to see a food shortage in 
the world but partially even in the 
United States of America. 
That is unbelievable to me. How 
could we, the United States of Amer-
ica, be facing possible food shortages? 
Indeed, already on the store shelves is 
empty space. 
I remember a story just a few years 
ago where Boris Yeltsin, President of 
Russia, of all places, came over and 
was visiting. They took him to a gro-
cery store in the United States, and he 
was amazed and blown away and even 
emotional by the variety we have here. 
Yet, the priorities don’t seem to be 
producing for Americans or even pro-
ducing for those we help around the 
world. It seems to be based more on en-
vironmental needs, like in my home 
State of California where they are re-
leasing more water out to the ocean 
than what is going to go to agriculture 
this year. 
Why does this affect all Americans? 
Why does this affect you? Because so 
many of the crops that we grow in Cali-
fornia supply somewhere between 90 
and 98 percent of what Americans eat 
of those crops, and we are still doing 
this environmental stuff in California.

BETTER CYBERCRIME METRICS 
ACT 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 2629) to establish cybercrime re-
porting mechanisms, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2629 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Better 
Cybercrime Metrics Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) 
Public 
polling 
indicates 
that 
cybercrime could be the most common crime 
in the United States. 
(2) The United States lacks comprehensive 
cybercrime data and monitoring, leaving the 
country less prepared to combat cybercrime 
that threatens national and economic secu-
rity. 
(3) In addition to existing cybercrime 
vulnerabilities, the people of the United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3869 
March 28, 2022 
States and the United States have faced a

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on S. 2629. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2629, the Better Cybercrime Metrics 
Act. This legislation improves our un-
derstanding 
and 
tracking 
of 
cybercrime so that we can do more to 
prevent it. 
A 2018 Gallup Poll found that 1 in 4 
Americans 
had 
been 
a 
victim 
of 
cybercrime. And I might say that it 
has exponentially grown during the 
pandemic. From stolen financial infor-
mation, to system-wide shutdowns, to 
ransomware 
attacks, 
these 
crimes 
harm our families, our businesses, and 
our government. 
The Council of Economic Advisers es-
timates that malicious cyber activities 
cost our economy as much as $109 bil-
lion in 2016, and experts believe these 
costs are growing. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has increased opportunities for 
cybercrime with increases in remote 
work and the time people are spending 
online. Hackers also took advantage of 
our recovery efforts, stealing identities 
to file fake unemployment claims or 
fraudulent 
loan 
applications. 
And 
again, in the midst of other innocent 
Americans not being able to secure 
those dollars, and not being able to se-
cure unemployment claims because of 
the fake process that clouded this sys-
tem. 
Many of the victims of these scams 
only learned that they were attacked 
when they went to file genuine claims 
and were told had already been sub-
mitted using their names or businesses. 
Sadly, cybercriminals often target 
older Americans. In 2020, people over 60 
accounted for the most complaints of 
any age group as collected by the FBI 
Internet Crime Complaint Center. Peo-
ple over 60 also had the greatest losses, 
with 
over 
$966 
billion 
lost 
to 
cybercrime in 2020. 
We must do more to protect Ameri-
cans from cybercrime, and that starts 
with a better understanding of what it 
is and how it occurs. The Better 
Cybercrime Metrics Act will gather ex-
perts in law enforcement, business, and 
technology to create a taxonomy of 
cybercrime so we can define it and 
classify it in a uniform way. 
This legislation also adds cybercrime 
to two important law enforcement 
tools used to track crimes: The Na-
tional Incident-Based Reporting Sys-
tem and the National Crime Victimiza-
tion Survey. Together, these provisions 
will ensure that law enforcement has a 
complete picture of when and where 
cybercrime occurs and who is harmed 
by it. 
Finally, this bill directs the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to conduct 
a study on reporting mechanisms for 
cybercrime 
and 
the 
disparities 
in 
cybercrime data relative to other types 
of crime data. Together, this legisla-
tion will put in place the tools to clear-
ly define and classify cybercrime, to 
track cybercrime, and to better under-
stand this serious threat. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a very serious 
threat. And in addition to the mone-
tary damages, people have been person-
ally and psychologically impacted by 
losses, by lack of employability, by 
being rejected, for some of these claims 
having to be delayed when the indi-
vidual who needs it is desperate and ex-
periencing a desperate economic condi-
tion, to find that they have been, in es-
sence, gamed by a cybercriminal. We 
must stop this. 
And as I said earlier, one of the most 
vulnerable populations are individuals 
over 60. And really when you find those 
in their seventies, eighties, nineties, 
who have lived their lives, supported 
this Nation, and become victims of 
cybercrime, it is something that com-
pels you to really want to stop this 
threat. 
I commend Senators BRIAN SCHATZ 
and THOM TILLIS for their work on this 
bipartisan legislation. I also thank 
Representative 
ABIGAIL
SPANBERGER 
for her leadership on the House com-
panion to this bill. I was proud to stand 
with her in introducing the House com-
panion, along with our Republican col-
leagues, Representative BLAKE MOORE 
and 
Representative 
ANDREW 
GARBARINO. 
We must give law enforcement the 
tools to keep pace with new technology 
and to get a step ahead of the threats 
faced by our ever-evolving world. This 
bill takes an important step in that ef-
fort, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

March 28, 2022 
MEMORANDUM EXCERPT 
To: Members of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee 
From: The Honorable Jerrold Nadler, Chair-
man, Committee on the Judiciary 
Re: Markup of H.R. 4977, the ‘‘Better 
Cybercrime Metrics Act’’; H.R. 55, the 
‘‘Emmett Till Antilynching Act’’; H.R. 
5338, the ‘‘Radiation Exposure Compensa-
tion Act Amendments of 2021’’; and H.R. 
5796, the ‘‘Patents for Humanity Act of 
2021’’ 
Date: Tuesday, December 7, 2021 
On Wednesday, December 8, 2021 at 10:00 
a.m. in 2141 Rayburn House Office Building, 
the House Judiciary Committee will mark up 
the 
following 
measures: 
H.R. 
3359, 
the 
‘‘Homicide Victims’ Families’ Rights Act of 
2021’’; H.R. 4977, the ‘‘Better Cybercrime 
Metrics Act’’; H.R. 55, the ‘‘Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act’’; H.R. 5338, the ‘‘Radiation 
Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 
2021’’; and H.R. 5796, the ‘‘Patents for Hu-
manity Act of 2021’’. 
II. H.R. 4977, THE ‘‘BETTER CYBERCRIME METRICS 
ACT’’ 
H.R. 4977, the ‘‘Better Cybercrime Metrics 
Act’’ would improve the U.S. government’s 
understanding, measurement, and tracking 
of cybercrime. The bill would direct the De-
partment of Justice to work with the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, in consultation 
with relevant stakeholders, to develop a tax-
onomy of cybercrime that could be used by 
law enforcement to ensure that the National 
Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), 
or any successor system, include cybercrime 
reports from federal, state, and local offi-
cials. It also directs the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics to include questions relating to 
cybercrime in the National Crime Victimiza-
tion Survey. The bill also directs the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office (GAO) to re-
port 
on 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
current 
cybercrime reporting mechanisms and high-
light disparities in reporting data between 
cybercrime data and other types of crime 
data. This bipartisan bill was introduced on 
August 6, 2021 by Representative Abigail 
Spanberger (D–VA) and currently has 18 co-
sponsors. An identical Senate companion, S. 
2629 (Schatz–HI, Tillis–NC, Cornyn–TX, Dur-
bin–IL), was marked up by the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee on November 18 and favor-
ably reported on a unanimous voice vote. 
The Chairman will offer an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4977. 
A. GENERAL BACKGROUND 
Cybercrime continues to be a significant 
threat to businesses, governments, and indi-
vidual Americans. Cybercrime includes a 
broad range of conduct including phishing, 
ransomware, 
identity 
theft, 
and 
data 
breaches.1 A recent survey found one in five 
Americans 
have 
been 
victims 
of 
ransomware.2 The COVID–19 pandemic cre-
ated new opportunities for cybercrime, in-
cluding 
COVID-related 
phishing 
and 
malware, with 35.9% of the world’s COVID–19 
cyber 
threats 
occurring 
in 
the 
United 
States.3
Cyber attackers mainly rely on 
phishing attacks, which is the most common 
attack as measured by the number of vic-
tims.4 Attackers also use online tools for ex-
tortion, data breaches, identity theft, ex-
tracting 
ransoms, 
email 
compromise 
schemes, impersonating charities and gov-
ernment actors, and other schemes.5
Re-
searchers attribute the rise in attacks to the 
increase in remote work and the lower secu-
rity protections at one’s home compared to 
an office.6 
Cybercrime is costly and harms individ-
uals, government entities, and businesses 
across a broad range of industries. The aver-
age data breach in 2020 cost companies $3.83 
million dollars.7 Email compromise schemes, 
in which email accounts are compromised to 
conduct unauthorized transfers of funds, ac-
counted for over $1.8 billion in losses in 2020.8 
In 
the 
first 
six 
months 
of 
2021, 
six 
ransomware organizations hacked 292 organi-
zations and stole $45 million dollars.9 Organi-
zations that experienced cybercrime this 
year include the Colonial Pipeline, the 
Steamship Authority of Massachusetts, JBS 
Foods, and the Washington D.C. Metropoli-
tan Police Department.10 As shown by the 
gas shortage due to the Colonial Pipeline 
breach, these attacks can shut down critical 
infrastructure, create shortages, increase the 
cost of goods and services, and cost organiza-
tions money from both operational shut-
downs and paying ransoms to hackers.11 
Likewise, the December 2020, SolarWinds at-
tack targeted SolarWinds’ 300,000 customers 
and endangered the cybersecurity of many 
federal government agencies, including the 
Department of Defense, as well as 425 of the 
U.S. Fortune 500 companies.12
Cybercrime 
harms businesses across all industries, but it 
had a particular effect on companies re-
sponding to the COVID–19 pandemic by dis-
rupting COVID–19 supply chains and the gov-
ernment’s efforts to address the spreading 
virus.13 
Bad actors gravitate to cyber-attacks be-
cause of the anonymity the internet provides 
and the low chances of getting caught. The 
detection and prosecution rate of cyber 
criminals in the United States is .05%.14 
Given the difficulty in tracing and pros-
ecuting these crimes, it is important to fur-
ther study and track them so that we can 
work to prevent cybercrime. H.R. 4977, the 
Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will provide 
law enforcement with the tools to uniformly 
classify and track cybercrime, furthering the 
government’s understanding of this serious 
problem and building the foundation for im-
proved cybercrime prevention efforts. 
B. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS FOR THE 
AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE 
Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 sets forth 
the short title of the bill as the ‘‘Better 
Cybercrime Metrics Act.’’ 
Section 2. Cybercrime Taxonomy. Section 2 
requires, within 90 days of the passage of the 
Act, the DOJ and the National Academy of 
Sciences to develop a taxonomy that can be 
used by law enforcement to categorize and 
track cybercrime, and requires that the tax-
onomy be presented to Congress. The bill au-
thorizes $1,000,000 to carry out this section. 
Section 3. Cybercrime Reporting. Section 3 
requires, not later than 2 years after the pas-
sage of the Act, the DOJ to establish a cat-
egory in the National Incident-Based Report-
ing System to enable the collection of 
cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime reports 
from Federal, State, and local officials, in-
corporating the taxonomy developed under 
Section 2 as appropriate. 
Section 4. National Crime Victimization Sur-
vey. Section 4 requires cybercrime to be 
added to the National Crime Victimization 
Survey. The bill authorizes $2,000,000 to carry 
out this section. 
Section 5. GAO Study on Cybercrime Metrics. 
Section 5 directs the GAO to do a study on 
the 
current 
reporting 
mechanisms 
of 
cybercrime and the disparities in data be-
tween (A) data relating to cybercrime and 
cyber-enabled crime; and (B) other types of 
crime data.

Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, American businesses 
and American citizens face a growing 
number of cybercrimes. Cybercrime is 
a particularly complicated form of 
criminal conduct and one that costs 
Americans billions of dollars a year in 
theft. 
This bill would require the Attorney 
General to enter into an agreement 
with the National Academy of Sciences 
to develop a method for categorizing 
different types of cybercrime. The At-
torney General would also establish a 
cybercrime category in the National 
Incident-Based Reporting System so 
that 
States 
can 
better 
report 
cybercrime data to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
The bill would also require the Bu-
reau of Justice Statistics to include 
cybercrime victimization questions in 
the National Crime Victimization Sur-
vey. There is no question that we must 
do more to bring cybercriminals to jus-
tice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3871 
March 28, 2022 
In August of 2021, the Biden adminis-
tration released a notorious Russian 
cybercriminal early from Federal cus-
tody. The individual is described as, 
‘‘one of the most connected and skilled 
malicious hackers ever apprehended by 
the U.S. authorities.’’ And for unknown 
reasons, the administration let him out 
of Federal prison early and shipped him 
back to Moscow. 
We have asked the Biden administra-
tion’s Justice Department for more in-
formation about this early release of 
this cybercriminal, but we have re-
ceived nothing as of yet. Similarly, we 
don’t have enough information to de-
termine whether this legislation will 
bring more cybercriminals to justice. 
We haven’t heard from relevant stake-
holders on these issues, and we haven’t 
held hearings with experts to deter-
mine whether this is the right step at 
this time. 
This bill would require GAO to sub-
mit a report to Congress that assesses 
the effectiveness of reporting mecha-
nisms for cybercrime and disparities in 
reporting data between cybercrime and 
other types of crime. 
Why aren’t we starting with that? 
Why are we making changes to 
cybercrime reporting mechanisms be-
fore the GAO can evaluate whether the 
existing reporting mechanisms are ef-
fective? 
It makes more sense for us to have 
hearings, evaluate GAO’s findings, and 
hear from experts. Then we can exam-
ine whether the other provisions of this 
bill are necessary and appropriate. 
In another instance of putting the 
cart before the horse, the Committee 
on the Judiciary is scheduled to hear 
from Bryan A. Vorndran, the assistant 
director of Cyber Division at the FBI 
tomorrow. Perhaps we should have 
waited to see what he had to say before 
rushing this legislation to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), who 
was astute enough to be able to offer 
the companion bill, and I thank her for 
her leadership and career leadership on 
these issues. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my Better 
Cybercrime Metrics Act and its com-
panion bill in the U.S. Senate, S. 2629. 
And I thank the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for that in-
troduction and for her support of this 
bill since the moment we introduced it. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation is under 
constant attack from cybercriminals. 
And with the range of new threats 
emanating from adversaries around the 
world, including the Russian Federa-
tion, Congress has an obligation to 
move legislation forward that can bet-
ter protect the American people, their 
data, their finances, and their personal 
information. 
Over the last few years, we have seen 
massive rates of cybercrime. Millions 
of Americans have had their personal 
data compromised, their money stolen, 
their identity taken, or their safety 
put at serious risk. In fact, cybercrime 
remains the most common crime in 
America, and this trend was only exac-
erbated by the pandemic and the many 
fraudsters looking to scam vulnerable 
Americans in a moment of crisis or 
make a quick buck off of a global ca-
tastrophe. 
Unfortunately, a vast majority of 
these crimes are not properly reported 
or tracked by law enforcement. Far too 
often, they are not measured or even 
documented. And to make matters 
worse, our government lacks the pre-
paredness required to fully address the 
next generation of cybercrime and 
cyberattacks. 
Our legislation would give law en-
forcement agencies the tools they need 
to 
better 
track 
and 
identify 
cybercrime, prevent attacks, and hold 
perpetrators 
accountable. 
Our 
bill 
would require Federal reporting on the 
effectiveness of current cybercrime 
mechanisms. 
And it would go one step further—it 
would also highlight disparities in re-
porting data between cybercrime data 
and other types of crime data. This is 
such an important step for strength-
ening our understanding and our de-
fenses against the phishing attempts, 
extortion, 
identity 
theft, 
and 
ransomware attacks that are plaguing 
everyday Americans in communities 
and across our country. Additionally, 
our bill would make sure America’s law 
enforcement is prepared for the next 
generation of cyberattacks. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud former 
Federal law enforcement officer, and I 
understand that local and State police 
and sheriff’s departments are often 
strained for resources. And I know that 
their time is precious, so I recognize 
the importance of having their backs 
and making sure that we have as much 
information as possible about potential 
threats. 
This legislation follows through on 
that commitment and it is why I am 
glad to see it endorsed by several na-
tional organizations—including the Na-
tional Fraternal Order of Police, the 
National Association of Police Organi-
zations, the Major Cities Chiefs Asso-
ciation, and the National White Collar 
Crime Center, which has a presence in 
Virginia’s Seventh District. 
In fact, this legislation—bipartisan 
and bicameral—was partially inspired 
by the attack on the Colonial pipeline 
last year, something that impacted 
many communities across my district. 
After thousands of Virginians, their 
gas tanks, and their wallets were im-
pacted by this disruptive ransomware 
attack, I was proud to build a bipar-
tisan coalition focused on improving 
America’s efforts to undercut hackers, 
protect 
critical 
infrastructure, 
and 
strengthen existing cybercrime preven-
tion efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
in the U.S. House of Representatives 
who joined this bipartisan coalition. I 
thank 
Congressman 
BLAKE
MOORE, 
Congressman ANDREW GARBARINO, and 
Congresswoman SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE 
for their partnership. Clearly, there is 
still bipartisan consensus for cyberse-
curity reforms and protections. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank our friends 
across the Capitol complex for ushering 
the Senate version through the proc-
ess. Thank you to Senators SCHATZ, 
TILLIS, CORNYN, and BLUMENTHAL for 
your cooperation and leadership on 
this important bicameral effort. 
When our bipartisan bill passes the 
House tonight, it will head to the 
President’s desk to be signed into law. 
And with a stroke of a pen, we will en-
sure that our national crime classifica-
tion 
system 
can 
properly 
identify 
cybercrimes and prevent future at-
tacks. 
Once our legislation is signed into 
law, we will be protecting more fami-
lies who bank online. We will be pro-
tecting more businesses who manage 
their employees’ payroll information 
over the internet. We will be protecting 
more seniors who are using the inter-
net to communicate with their loved 
ones far away or rely on the internet to 
manage their Federal benefits, such as 
Social Security. 
Together, 
we 
will 
thwart 
cybercriminals. And together, we will 
prevent more Americans from becom-
ing targets or victims online. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just take an op-
portunity to thank Congresswoman 
SPANBERGER
for the knowledge she 
brings to this issue and to this legisla-
tion. We have already said that this is 
not a harmless crime. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
Cybercrime 
predictions 
for 
2022: 
Deepfakes, cryptocurrencies, and mis-
information, to further emphasize the 
lack of the harmlessness that it is. It is 
harmful. One sentence says it all: Fake 
news 2.0 and the return of misinforma-
tion campaigns. They cite in particular 
COVID–19. I think all of us can attest 
to the terrible damage that was done 
during the pandemic with the huge 
issues of the question of COVID and the 
vaccination. Fake vaccine passport 
certificates were on sale for $100 to 
$125, and the volume of advertising 
groups and group sizes publishing sell-
ers and multiplied over and over again.

will also find new opportunities to attack 
such as deepfakes, cryptocurrency and mo-
bile wallets. 
In 2021, cyber criminals adapted their at-
tack strategy to exploit vaccination man-
dates, elections and the shift to hybrid work, 
to target organizations’ supply chains and 
networks for them to achieve maximum dis-
ruption. 
The 
sophistication 
and 
scale 
of 
cyberattacks will continue to break records 
and we can expect a huge increase in the 
number of ransomware and mobile attacks. 
Looking ahead, organizations should remain 
aware of the risks and ensure that they have 
the appropriate solutions in place to prevent 
them without disrupting their normal busi-
ness flow. To stay ahead of threats, organiza-
tions must be proactive and leave no part of 
their 
attack 
surface 
unprotected 
or 
unmonitored or otherwise risk becoming the 
next victim of sophisticated, targeted at-
tacks. 
GLOBAL CYBERCRIME PREDICTIONS FOR 2022 
Fake news 2.0 and the return of misinformation 
campaigns 
The claim of ‘fake news’ surrounding con-
tentious issues has become a new attack vec-
tor over previous years without people really 
understanding its full impact. Throughout 
2021, misinformation was spread about the 
COVID–19 pandemic and vaccination infor-
mation. The black market for fake vaccine 
certificates expanded globally, now selling 
fakes from 29 countries. Fake ‘vaccine pass-
port’ certificates were on sale for $100–120 
and the volume of advertisement groups and 
group sizes publishing sellers multiplied 
within the year. In 2022, cyber groups will 
continue to leverage these types of fake news 
campaigns to execute cybercrime through 
various phishing attacks and scams. 
In addition, prior to the 2020 US presi-
dential election, Check Point researchers 
spotted surges in malicious election-related 
domains and the use of ‘‘meme camouflage’’ 
aimed at shifting public opinion. In the run- 
up to the US midterm elections in November 
2022, we can expect to see these activities in 
full effect and for misinformation campaigns 
to return on social media. 
Cyberattacks targeting supply chains 
Supply chain attackers take advantage of 
a lack of monitoring within an organiza-
tion’s environment. They can be used to per-
form any type of cyberattack, such as data 
breaches and malware infections. 
The well known cybercrime—SolarWinds 
supply chain attack stands out in 2021 due to 
its scale and influence, but other sophisti-
cated supply chain attacks have occurred 
such as Codecov in April, and most recently, 
Kaseya. Kaseya provides software for Man-
aged 
Service 
Providers 
and 
the 
REvil 
ransomware gang exploited the company to 
infect over 1,000 customers with ransomware. 
The group demanded a ransom of $70 million 
to provide decryption keys for all affected 
customers. 
Supply chain attacks will become more 
common and governments will have to estab-
lish regulations to address these attacks and 
protect networks. They will also look into 
collaborating with the private sectors and 
internationally to identify and target more 
threat groups operating on global and re-
gional scales. In 2022, expect to discover 
more about the global impact of the infa-
mous Sunburst attack. 
The cyber ‘cold war’ intensifies 
The cyber way is intensifying, and taking 
place online as more nation-state actors 
push Western governments to continue to de-
stabilize society. Improved infrastructure 
and technological capabilities will enable 
terrorists groups and political activists to 
further their cybercrime agendas and carry 
out more sophisticated, widespread attacks. 
Cyberattacks will increasingly be used as 
proxy conflicts to destabilize activities glob-
ally. 
Data breaches are larger scale and more costly 
Going into 2022 we will see an increase in 
data breaches that will be larger scale. These 
breaches will also have the potential to cost 
organizations and governments more to re-
cover. In May 2021, a US insurance giant paid 
$40 million in ransom to hackers. This was a 
record, and we can expect ransom demanded 
by attackers to increase in 2022. 
TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY PREDICTIONS FOR 
2022 
Mobile malware attacks increase as more people 
use mobile wallets and payment platforms: 
In 2021, 46 percent of organizations had at 
least one employee download a malicious 
mobile application. The move to remote 
work for almost entire populations across 
the world during the COVID–19 pandemic saw 
the mobile attack surface expand dramati-
cally, resulting in 97 percent of organizations 
facing mobile threats from several attack 
vectors. As mobile wallets and mobile pay-
ment platforms are used more frequently, 
cybercrimes will evolve and adapt their tech-
niques to exploit the growing reliance on 
mobile devices. 
Cryptocurrency becomes a focal point for 
cyberattacks globally 
When money becomes purely software, the 
cybersecurity needed to protect us from 
hackers stealing and manipulating bitcoins 
and altcoins is sure to change in unexpected 
ways. As reports of stolen crypto wallets 
triggered by free airdropped NFTs become 
more frequent, Check Point Research (CPR) 
investigated OpenSea and proved it was pos-
sible to steal crypto wallets of users by 
leveraging critical security. In 2022, we can 
expect to see an increase in cryptocurrency 
related attacks. 
Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in microserv-
ices to launch largescale attacks 
The move to the cloud and DevOps will re-
sult in a new form of cybercrime. With 
microservices becoming the leading method 
for application development, and microserv-
ices architecture being embraced by Cloud 
Service Providers (CSPs), attackers are 
using vulnerabilities found in microservices 
to launch their attacks. We can also expect 
to see large scale attacks targeting CSPs. 
Deepfake technology weaponized 
Techniques for fake video or audio are now 
advanced enough to be weaponized and used 
to create targeted content to manipulate 
opinions, stock prices or worse. As in the 
case of other mobile attacks that rely on so-
cial engineering, the results of a phishing at-
tacks can range from fraud to more advanced 
espionage. For instance in one of the most 
significant deepfake phishing attacks, a 
bank manager in the United Arab Emirates 
fell victim to a threat actor’s scam. Hackers 
used AI voice cloning to trick the bank man-
ager into transferring $35 million. Threat ac-
tors will use deepfake social engineering at-
tacks to gain permissions and to access sen-
sitive data. 
Penetration tools continue to grow 
Globally in 2021, 1 out of every 61 organiza-
tions was being impacted by ransomware 
each week. Cybercrime through ransomware 
will continue to grow, despite the efforts of 
law enforcement to limit this growth glob-
ally. Threat actors will target companies 
that 
can 
afford 
paying 
ransom, 
and 
ransomware attacks will become more so-
phisticated in 2022. Hackers will increasingly 
use penetration tools to customize attacks 
in real time and to live and work within vic-
tim networks. Penetration tools are the en-
gine 
behind 
the 
most 
sophisticated 
ransomware attacks that took place in 2021. 
As the popularity of this attack method 
grows, attackers will use it to carry out data 
exfiltration and extortion attacks. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD the article: ‘‘Ho, 
Ho, Ho, Holiday Scams’’ FBI Portland. 
During the 2020 holiday season, this ar-
ticle says this FBI Internet Compliance 
Center received more than 17,000 com-
plaints regarding the nondelivery of 
goods resulting in losses of more than 
$53 billion. 
[From FBI Portland, December 1, 2021] 
HO, HO, HO, HOLIDAY SCAMS! 
(By Beth Anne Steele) 
If you’re doing online shopping this holi-
day season, be on the lookout for scammers 
trying to steal a deal, too! 
During the 2020 holiday shopping season, 
the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center 
(IC3.gov) received more than 17,000 com-
plaints regarding the non-delivery of goods, 
resulting in losses of more than $53 million. 
The FBI anticipates this number could in-
crease during the 2021 holiday season due to 
rumors of merchandise shortages and the on-
going pandemic. 
‘‘Oftentimes when we talk about cyber 
crimes, we are referring to massive intru-
sions 
into 
financial 
institutions 
or 
ransomware attacks against large providers. 
Smaller cyber scams run by individuals or 
groups can be just as frustrating and dif-
ficult for families this time of year when all 
you want to do is provide the perfect gift for 
your family. The best thing you can do to be 
a savvy shopper is to know what scams are 
out there and take some basic precautions,’’ 
says Kieran L. Ramsey, special agent in 
charge of the FBI in Oregon. 
Here’s a look at some of the more common 
scams: 
Online Shopping Scams: 
Scammers often offer too-good-to-be-true 
deals via phishing emails, through social 
media posts, or through ads. Perhaps you 
were trying to buy tickets to the next big 
concert or sporting event and found just 
what you were looking for—at a good deal— 
in an online marketplace? Those tickets 
could end up being bogus. Or, perhaps, you 
think you just scored a hard-to-find item 
like a new gaming system? Or a designer bag 
at an extremely low price? If you actually 
get a delivery, which is unlikely, the box 
may not contain the item you ordered in the 
condition you thought it would arrive. In the 
meantime, if you clicked on a link to access 
the deal. you likely gave the fraudster access 
to download malware onto your device, and 
you gave him personal financial information 
and debit/credit card details. 
Social Media Shopping Scams: 
Consumers should beware of posts on social 
media sites that appear to offer special 
deals, vouchers, or gift cards. Some may ap-
pear as holiday promotions or contests. Oth-
ers may appear to be from known friends 
who have shared the link. Often, these scams 
lead consumers to participate in an online 
survey that is designed to steal personal in-
formation. If you click an ad through a so-
cial media platform, do your due diligence to 
check the legitimacy of the website before 
providing credit card or personal informa-
tion. 
Gift Card Scams:

store if it looks like the security PIN on the 
back has been uncovered and recovered. Your 
best bet is to buy digital gift cards directly 
from the merchant online. Another twist on 
this scam involves a person who receives a 
request to purchase gift cards in bulk. Here’s 
how it works: the victim receives a spoofed 
email, a phone call, or a text from a person 
who they believe is in authority (such as an 
executive at the company). The fraudster 
tells the victim to purchase multiple gift 
cards as gifts. The victim does so and then 
passes the card numbers and PINs to the ‘‘ex-
ecutive’’ who cashes out the value. 
Charity Scams: 
Charity fraud rises during the holiday sea-
son when people want to make end-of-year 
tax deductible gifts or just wish to con-
tribute to a good cause. These seasonal 
scams can be more difficult to stop because 
of their widespread reach, limited duration 
and, when done online, minimal oversight. 
Bad actors target victims through cold calls, 
email campaigns, crowdfunding platforms, or 
fake social media accounts and websites. 
Fraudsters make it easy for victims to give 
money and to feel like they’re making a dif-
ference. The scammer will divert some or all 
the funds for personal use, and those most in 
need will never see the donations. 
Tips to Avoid Being Victimized: 
Pay for items using a credit card dedicated 
for online purchases, checking the card 
statement frequently, and never saving pay-
ment information in online accounts. 
Never make purchases using public Wi-Fi. 
Beware of vendors that require payment 
with a gift card, wire transfer, cash, or 
cryptocurrency. 
Research the seller to ensure legitimacy. 
Check reviews and do online searches for the 
name of the vendor and the words ‘‘scam’’ or 
‘‘fraud.’’ 
Check the contact details listed on the 
website to ensure the vendor is real and 
reachable by phone or email. 
Confirm return and refund policies. 
Be wary of online retailers who use a free 
email service instead of a company email ad-
dress. 
Don’t judge a company by its website. 
Flashy websites can be set up and taken 
down quickly. 
Do not click on links or provide personal 
or financial information to an unsolicited 
email or social media post. 
Secure credit card accounts, even rewards 
accounts, 
with 
strong 
passwords 
or 
passphrases. 
Change 
passwords 
or 
passphrases regularly. 
Make charitable contributions directly, 
rather than through an intermediary, and 
pay via credit card or check. Avoid cash do-
nations, if possible. 
Only purchase gift cards directly from a 
trusted merchant. 
Make sure anti-virus/malware software is 
up to date and block pop-up windows. 
What to Do if You Are a Victim: 
If you are a victim of an online scam, the 
FBI recommends taking the following ac-
tions: 
Report the activity to the Internet Crime 
Complaint Center at IC3.gov, regardless of 
dollar loss. Provide all relevant information 
in the complaint. 
Contact your financial institution imme-
diately upon discovering any fraudulent or 
suspicious activity and direct them to stop 
or reverse the transactions. 
Ask your financial institution to contact 
the 
corresponding 
financial 
institution 
where the fraudulent or suspicious transfer 
was sent. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD
the article: 
‘‘Without major changes, more Ameri-
cans can be victims of online crime’’ 
The Hill. ‘‘When you turn on the TV or 
read the newspaper, it is hard to ignore 
headlines: ‘Colonial Pipeline a Victim 
of Massive Ransomware Attack.’ ‘50 
Million People Affected by T-Mobile 
Data 
Breach.’ 
‘Hackers 
Exploit 
SolarWinds to Spy on U.S. Government 
Agencies.’ ’’ 
[From The Hill, Aug. 30, 2021] 
WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES, MORE AMERICANS 
COULD BE VICTIMS OF ONLINE CRIME 
(By Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D–VA)) 
When you turn on the TV or read the news-
paper, it’s hard to ignore the headlines: ‘‘Co-
lonial 
Pipeline 
a 
Victim 
of 
Massive 
Ransomware Attack.’’ ‘‘50 Million People Af-
fected by T-Mobile Data Breach.’’ ‘‘Hackers 
Exploit SolarWinds to Spy on U.S. Govern-
ment Agencies.’’ 
These major attacks represent a serious 
threat to our economy and our national se-
curity. After the Colonial Pipeline attack 
impacted thousands of our neighbors in Cen-
tral Virginia, I was adamant about how our 
government must vastly improve its efforts 
to undercut the activity of hackers, protect 
critical infrastructure, and strengthen our 
cybercrime prevention efforts. 
But the story of cybercrime in 2021 goes far 
beyond these news-making cyberattacks—it 
extends into our communities, our neighbor-
hoods, and our homes. 
If you are a family banking online, a busi-
ness managing your employees’ payroll in-
formation, or a senior accessing federal ben-
efits on the internet, you are no stranger to 
thinking about how a cyber breach or attack 
could affect you. Even worse, you might al-
ready be one of the millions of Americans 
whose personal data has been compromised, 
money or identity stolen, or safety put at 
risk. 
In 2018, Gallup found that nearly one in 
four U.S. households has been a victim of 
cybercrime—making it the most common 
crime 
in 
America. 
To 
confront 
cybercriminals and their enablers, we need 
to have a better understanding of these inci-
dents. However, many of these cases—a vast 
majority of these crimes—are not properly 
reported or tracked by law enforcement 
Often, they are not measured at all. 
By some estimates, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) may only collect about 
one in 90 of all cybercrime incidents in its 
Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) data-
base. The lack of information about cyber 
and cyber-enabled crime is divorced from 
what Americans are actually facing on a 
day-to-day 
basis 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
cybercrime. What’s more, these crimes are 
rising at an alarming rate. 
Compounding this challenge is the fact 
that federal, state, and local governments do 
not have a comprehensive, effective system 
to measure cybercrime. In 2021—decades 
after the dawn of the internet age—we re-
main woefully unprepared to prevent or re-
spond 
to 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
cyberattacks. 
Accountability for these crimes—and pro-
tection against them—can’t fully take shape 
until we have a clear picture of the current 
state of play. For this reason, we need to 
take real steps to improve how we track, 
measure, analyze, and prosecute cybercrime. 
Earlier this month, I introduced the bipar-
tisan Better Cybercrime Metrics Act, which 
would allow our federal government and law 
enforcement to better track and identify 
cybercrime, prevent attacks, and go after 
perpetrators. This bill would strengthen our 
understanding and our defenses against the 
phishing attempts, extortion, ransomware, 
and identity theft that are plaguing every-
day Americans. 
As a former federal law enforcement agent, 
I understand that local and state police and 
sheriff’s departments are often strained for 
resources and time. And as a former CIA case 
officer, I recognize the importance of gath-
ering as much information as possible about 
potential threats—so that we can prevent at-
tacks on American citizens and American 
businesses. 
If signed into law, the Better Cybercrime 
Metrics Act would improve our cybercrime 
metrics, anticipate future trends, and make 
sure law enforcement has the tools and re-
sources they need. 
Our bill would require federal reporting on 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
current 
cybercrime 
mechanisms and highlight disparities in re-
porting data between cybercrime data and 
other types of crime data. 
Additionally, it would require the National 
Crime Victimization Survey to ask questions 
related to cybercrime in its surveys—and it 
would make sure that the FBI’s National In-
cident Based Reporting System include 
cybercrime reports from federal, state, and 
local officials. 
Notably, our bill would also require the 
U.S. Department of Justice to contract with 
the National Academy of Sciences to develop 
a standard taxonomy for cybercrime. These 
metrics could be used by law enforcement 
across the board. 
I was proud to introduce this legislation 
alongside my colleagues U.S. Reps. Blake 
Moore (R–Utah), Andrew Garbarino (R–N.Y.), 
and Sheila Jackson Lee (D–Texas). Clearly, 
there is consensus for these reforms and pro-
tections across the political spectrum. 
In the Senate, a companion bill is being led 
by Sen. Brian Schatz (D–Hawaii). Joining 
him are Thom Tillis (R–N.C.), John Cornyn 
(R–Texas), and Richard Blumenthal (D– 
Conn.). I am proud to have their partnership 
on this important, bicameral effort. 
With this legislation and an improved un-
derstanding of the threats ahead, we can pre-
vent more Americans from becoming tar-
gets—or victims—online. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD the article ti-
tled: ‘‘U.S. Military Has Acted Against 
Ransomware Groups, General Acknowl-
edges.’’ 
[From the New York Times, December 5, 
2021] 
U.S. 
MILITARY
HAS
ACTED
AGAINST 
RANSOMWARE GROUPS, GENERAL ACKNOWL-
EDGES 
(By Julian E. Barnes) 
SIMI
VALLEY, CALIF.—The U.S. military 
has 
taken 
actions 
against 
ransomware 
groups as part of its surge against organiza-
tions launching attacks against American 
companies, the nation’s top cyberwarrior 
said on Saturday, the first public acknowl-
edgment of offensive measures against such 
organizations. 
Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of U.S. 
Cyber Command and the director of the Na-
tional Security Agency, said that nine 
months 
ago, 
the 
government 
saw 
ransomware attacks as the responsibility of 
law enforcement. 
But the attacks on Colonial Pipeline and 
JBS beef plants demonstrated that the 
criminal organizations behind them have 
been ‘‘impacting our critical infrastruc-
ture,’’ General Nakasone said. 
In response, the government is taking a 
more aggressive, better coordinated ap-
proach against this threat, abandoning its 
previous hands-off stance. Cyber Command, 
the N.S.A. and other agencies have poured 
resources into gathering intelligence on the 
ransomware groups and sharing that better 
understanding across the government and 
with international partners.

‘‘The first thing we have to do is to under-
stand the adversary and their insights better 
than we’ve ever understood them before,’’ 
General Nakasone said in an interview on 
the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense 
Forum, a gathering of national security offi-
cials. 
General Nakasone would not describe the 
actions taken by his commands, nor what 
ransomware groups were targeted. But he 
said one of the goals was to ‘‘impose costs,’’ 
which is the term military officials use to 
describe punitive cyberoperations. 
‘‘Before, during and since, with a number 
of elements of our government, we have 
taken actions and we have imposed costs;’’ 
General Nakasone said. ‘‘That’s an impor-
tant piece that we should always be mindful 
of.’’ 
In September, Cyber Command diverted 
traffic around servers being used by the Rus-
sia-based REvil ransomware group, officials 
briefed on the operation have said. The oper-
ation came after government hackers from 
an allied country penetrated the servers, 
making it more difficult for the group to col-
lect ransoms. After REvil detected the U.S. 
action, it shut down at least temporarily. 
That Cyber Command operation was re-
ported last month by The Washington Post. 
Cyber Command and the N.S.A. also as-
sisted the F.B.I. and the Justice Department 
in their efforts to seize and recover much of 
the cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial 
Pipeline. The Bitcoin payment was origi-
nally demanded by the Russian ransomware 
group known as DarkSide. 
The first known operation against a 
ransomware group by Cyber Command came 
before the 2020 election, when officials feared 
a network of computers known as TrickBot 
could be used to disrupt voting. 
Government officials have disagreed about 
how effective the stepped-up actions against 
ransomware groups have been. National Se-
curity Council officials have said activities 
by Russian groups have declined. The F.B.I. 
has been skeptical. Some outside groups saw 
a lull but predicted the ransomware groups 
would rebrand and come back in force. 
Asked if the United States had gotten bet-
ter at defending itself from ransomware 
groups, General Nakasone said the country 
was ‘‘on an upward trajectory.’’ But adver-
saries modify their operations and continue 
to try to attack, he said. 
‘‘We know much more about what our ad-
versaries can and might do to us. This is an 
area where vigilance is really important,’’ he 
said, adding that ‘‘we can’t take our eye off 
it.’’ 
Since taking over in May 2018, General 
Nakasone has worked to increase the pace of 
cyberoperations, focusing first on more ro-
bust defenses against foreign influence oper-
ations in the 2018 and 2020 elections. He has 
said that his commands have been able to 
draw broad lessons from those operations, 
which were seen as successful, and others. 
‘‘Take a look at the broad perspective of 
adversaries that we’ve gone after over a pe-
riod of five-plus years: It’s been nation- 
states, it’s been proxies, it’s been criminals, 
it’s been a whole wide variety of folks that 
each require a different strategy,’’ he said. 
‘‘The fundamental piece that makes us suc-
cessful against any adversary are speed, agil-
ity and unity of effort. You have to have 
those three.’’ 
Last year’s discovery of the SolarWinds 
hacking, 
in 
which 
Russian 
intelligence 
agents implanted software in the supply 
chain, giving them potential access to scores 
of government networks and thousands of 
business networks, was made by a private 
company and exposed flaws in America’s do-
mestic cyberdefenses. The N.S.A’s Cyberse-
curity Collaboration Center was set up to 
improve information sharing between the 
government and industry and to better de-
tect future intrusions, General Nakasone 
said, although industry officials say more 
needs to be done to improve the flow of intel-
ligence. 
General Nakasone said those kinds of at-
tacks are likely to continue, by ransomware 
groups and others. 
‘‘What we have seen over the past year and 
what private industry has indicated is that 
we have seen a tremendous rise in terms of 
implants 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
zero-day 
vulnerabilities and ransomware,’’ he said, re-
ferring to an unknown coding flaw for which 
a patch does not exist. ‘‘I think that’s the 
world in which we live today.’’ 
Speaking on a panel at the Reagan Forum, 
General Nakasone said the domain of cyber-
space had changed radically over the past 11 
months with the rise of ransomware attacks 
and operations like SolarWinds. He said it 
was likely in any future military conflict 
that American critical infrastructure would 
be targeted. 
‘‘Borders mean less as we look at our ad-
versaries, and whatever adversary that is, we 
should begin with the idea that our critical 
infrastructure will be targeted:’ he told the 
panel. 
Cyber Command has already begun build-
ing up its efforts to defend the next election. 
Despite the work to expose Russian, Chinese 
and Iranian efforts to meddle in American 
politics, General Nakasone said in the inter-
view that foreign malign campaigns were 
likely to continue. 
‘‘I think that we should anticipate that in 
cyberspace, where the barriers to entry are 
so low, our adversaries are always going to 
be attempting to be involved;’’ he said. 
The recipe for success in defending the 
election, he said, is to provide insight to the 
public about what adversaries are trying to 
do, share information about vulnerabilities 
and adversarial operations, and finally take 
action against groups trying to interfere 
with voting. 
While 
that 
might 
take 
the 
form 
of 
cyberoperations against hackers, the re-
sponse can be broader. Last month, the Jus-
tice Department announced the indictment 
of two Iranian hackers the government had 
identified as being behind an attempt to in-
fluence the 2020 election. 
‘‘This really has to be a whole-of-govern-
ment effort,’’ General Nakasone said. ‘‘This 
is why the diplomatic effort is important. 
This is why being able to look at a number 
of different levers within our government to 
be able to impact these type of adversaries is 
critical for our success.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The roll call 
goes on and on and on. 
I thank my colleagues for their words 
of support for this bipartisan legisla-
tion. I believe the time is now. We are 
going to continue this journey. This is 
not the last legislative initiative, that 
is why we will be holding a hearing to-
morrow with the representative from 
the FBI because this is a growing con-
tinuing project and problem. If I might 
use the terminology, we will have to 
re-image constantly. 
This legislation is also supported by 
law enforcement groups and those with 
particular expertise in cybercrime, in-
cluding the National Fraternal Order 
of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Asso-
ciation, and the National Association 
of Police Organizations, the National 
White Collar Crime Center, and the 
Cybercrime Support Network. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Senator 
SCHATZ, Senator TILLIS, and as I indi-
cated, our colleague, Representative 
SPANBERGER
for their leadership on 
this bipartisan legislation. I am glad to 
have joined it and I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 2629, the ‘‘Better Cybercrime 
Metrics Act.’’ 
This legislation improves our understanding 
and tracking of cybercrime so that we can do 
more to prevent it. 
A 2018 Gallup poll found that one in four 
Americans has been a victim of cybercrime. 
From stolen financial information, to system-
wide shutdowns, to ransomware attacks, these 
crimes harm our families, our businesses, and 
our government. 
The Council of Economic Advisers esti-
mated that malicious cyber activities cost our 
economy as much as $109 billion in 2016, and 
experts believe these costs are growing. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has increased op-
portunities for cybercrime, with increases in re-
mote work and the time people spend online. 
Hackers also took advantage of our recov-
ery efforts, stealing identities to file fake unem-
ployment claims or fraudulent loan applica-
tions. 
Many of the victims of these scams only 
learned they were attacked when they went to 
file genuine claims and were told that one had 
already been submitted using their name or 
business. 
Sadly, cyber criminals often target older 
Americans. In 2020, people over 60 accounted 
for the most complaints of any age group, as 
collected by the FBI Internet Crime Complaint 
Center. 
People over 60 also had the greatest 
losses, 
with 
over 
$966 
million 
lost 
to 
cybercrime in 2020. 
We must do more to protect Americans from 
cybercrime, and that starts with a better un-
derstanding of what it is and how it occurs. 
The Better Cybercrime Metrics Act will gath-
er experts in law enforcement, business, and 
technology 
to 
create 
a 
taxonomy 
of 
cybercrime so that we can define it and clas-
sify it in a uniform way. 
This legislation also adds cybercrime to two 
important law enforcement tools used to track 
crimes, the National Incident-Based Reporting 
System and the National Crime Victimization 
Survey. 
Together these provisions will ensure that 
law enforcement has a complete picture of 
when and where cybercrime occurs, and who 
is harmed by it. 
Finally, this bill directs the Government Ac-
countability Office to conduct a study on re-
porting mechanisms for cybercrime, and the 
disparities in cybercrime data relative to other 
types of crime data. 
Together this legislation will put in place the 
tools to clearly define and classify cybercrime, 
to track cybercrime, and to better understand 
this serious threat. 
I commend Senators BRIAN SCHATZ and 
THOM TILLIS for their work on this bipartisan 
legislation. I also thank Representative ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER for her leadership on the House 
companion to this bill. I was proud to stand 
with her in introducing the House companion, 
along with our Republican colleagues, Rep-
resentative BLAKE MOORE and Representative 
ANDREW GARBARINO.

HOMICIDE VICTIMS’ FAMILIES’ 
RIGHTS ACT OF 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3359) to provide for a system 
for reviewing the case files of cold case 
murders at the instance of certain per-
sons, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3359 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Homicide Vic-
tims’ Families’ Rights Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. CASE FILE REVIEW. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The head of an agency shall 
review the case file regarding a cold case murder 
upon written application by one designated per-
son to determine if a full reinvestigation would 
result in either the identification of probative 
investigative leads or a likely perpetrator. 
(b) REVIEW.—The review under subsection (a) 
shall include— 
(1) an analysis of what investigative steps or 
follow-up steps may have been missed in the ini-
tial investigation; 
(2) an assessment of whether witnesses should 
be interviewed or reinterviewed; 
(3) an examination of physical evidence to see 
if all appropriate forensic testing and analysis 
was performed in the first instance or if addi-
tional testing might produce information rel-
evant to the investigation; and 
(4) an update of the case file using the most 
current investigative standards as of the date of 
the review to the extent it would help develop 
probative leads. 
(c) CERTIFICATION
IN LIEU
OF REVIEW.—In 
any case in which a written application for re-
view has been received under this Act by the 
agency, review shall be unnecessary where the 
case does not satisfy the criteria for a cold case 
murder. In such a case, the head of the agency 
shall issue a written certification, with a copy 
provided to the designated person that made the 
application under subsection (a), stating that 
final review is not necessary because all pro-
bative investigative leads have been exhausted 
or that a likely perpetrator will not be identi-
fied. 
(d) REVIEWER.—A review required under sub-
section (a) shall not be conducted by a person 
who previously investigated the murder at issue. 
(e) ACKNOWLEDGMENT.—The agency shall pro-
vide in writing to the applicant as soon as rea-
sonably possible— 
(1) confirmation of the agency’s receipt of the 
application under subsection (a); and 
(2) notice of the applicant’s rights under this 
Act. 
(f) PROHIBITION
ON MULTIPLE CONCURRENT 
REVIEWS.—Only one case review shall be under-
taken at any one time with respect to the same 
cold case murder victim. 
(g) TIME LIMIT.—Not later than 6 months 
after the receipt of the written application sub-
mitted pursuant to subsection (a), the agency 
shall conclude its case file review and reach a 
conclusion about whether or not a full reinves-
tigation under section 4 is warranted. 
(h) EXTENSIONS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The agency may extend the 
time limit under subsection (g) once for a period 
of time not to exceed 6 months if the agency 
makes a finding that the number of case files to 
be reviewed make it impracticable to comply 
with such limit without unreasonably taking re-
sources from other law enforcement activities. 
(2) ACTIONS
SUBSEQUENT
TO
WAIVER.—For 
cases for which the time limit in subsection (g) 
is extended, the agency shall provide notice and 
an explanation of its reasoning to one des-
ignated person who filed the written application 
pursuant to this section. 
SEC. 3. APPLICATION. 
Each agency shall develop a written applica-
tion to be used for designated persons to request 
a case file review under section 2. 
SEC. 4. FULL REINVESTIGATION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The agency shall conduct a 
full reinvestigation of the cold case murder at 
issue if the review of the case file required by 
section 2 concludes that a full reinvestigation of 
such cold case murder would result in probative 
investigative leads. 
(b) REINVESTIGATION.—A full reinvestigation 
shall include analyzing all evidence regarding 
the cold case murder at issue for the purpose of 
developing probative investigative leads or a 
likely perpetrator. 
(c) REVIEWER.—A reinvestigation required 
under subsection (a) shall not be conducted by 
a person who previously investigated the murder 
at issue. 
(d) PROHIBITION
ON MULTIPLE CONCURRENT 
REVIEWS.—Only one full reinvestigation shall be 
undertaken at any one time with respect to the 
same cold case murder victim. 
SEC. 5. CONSULTATION AND UPDATES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The agency shall consult 
with the designated person who filed the written 
application pursuant to section 2 and provide 
him or her with periodic updates during the case 
file review and full reinvestigation. 
(b) EXPLANATION OF CONCLUSION.—The agen-
cy shall meet with the designated person and 
discuss the evidence to explain to the designated 
person who filed the written application pursu-
ant to section 2 its decision whether or not to 
engage in the full reinvestigation provided for 
under section 4 at the conclusion of the case file 
review. 
SEC. 6. SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS. 
(a) CASE FILE REVIEW.—If a review under 
subsection (a) case file regarding a cold case 
murder is conducted and a conclusion is reached

cant evidence. An agency may continue an in-
vestigation absent a designated person’s appli-
cation. 
(b) FULL REINVESTIGATION.—If a full reinves-
tigation of a cold case murder is completed and 
a suspect is not identified at its conclusion, no 
additional case file review or full reinvestigation 
shall be undertaken with regard to that cold 
case murder for a period of five years beginning 
on the date of the conclusion of the reinvestiga-
tion, unless there is newly discovered, materially 
significant evidence.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3359, the 
Homicide Victims’ Families’ Rights 
Act of 2021, and urge my colleagues to 
support 
this 
bipartisan 
legislation, 
which establishes a procedure for fami-
lies of murder victims in cases inves-
tigated at the Federal level to continue 
to pursue justice for their murdered 
family member when the trail has gone 
cold. There is nothing more dev-
astating for a family to live without 
answers in the midst of a violent death 
of their loved one. 
This legislation gives a designated 
family member the right to request a 
review of their murdered loved one’s 
case file after 3 years. Unfortunately, 4 
out of 10 murder victims’ families in 
this country never receive any closure 
in the loss of their family member. 
FBI data shows the percentage of 
homicides cleared by an arrest or other 
means has declined significantly from 
1965 to today, while the number of un-
solved homicides grows by the thou-
sands nationwide every year. 
In 2019, four Texas cities cleared 40 
percent or less of reported homicides, 
according to the FBI statistics. Low 
clearance rates lead to low confidence 
in law enforcement and reduce citizen 
cooperation, which led to even lower 
clearance rates. The backlog of cases 
and low clearance rates disproportion-
ately affect murder victims who are 
poor, undereducated, unemployed, and 
Black, and without resources to pursue 
this with a private investigator or with 
an extended legal team. They are left 
to their own devices. Mr. Speaker, you 
know what that is, remorse, sadness, 
devastation, family breaks-ups, loss 
that can never be repaired. 
Poor Black and Brown victims and 
their families tend to receive less at-
tention to their cases from law enforce-
ment 
than 
those 
of 
other 
socio-
economic 
backgrounds 
and 
racial 
groups, and their cases go unsolved. 
This, 
of 
course, 
however, 
impacts 
Americans across the board. The pain 
is deep without easing, without ceas-
ing. This legislation is important. This 
disparate treatment is unacceptable as 
well. We can and we must provide jus-
tice for all victims and their families. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope this legislation 
will set a new tone—eliminating dis-
parate treatment—impacting vulner-
able communities of poor Black and 
Brown families who never receive clo-
sure, while serving as a model for 
State, local, and Tribal governments 
where the vast majority of unsolved 
murders lie, and as well, help all Amer-
icans no matter what their condition 
and station in life and no matter where 
they live. 
H.R. 3359 will require Federal law en-
forcement agencies to use fresh eyes— 
and I have seen this actually work—to 
complete a case file, review, and deter-
mine if a full reinvestigation could 
lead to new probative investigative 
leads. 
This legislation will encourage equi-
table treatment of victims and their 
families by requiring that Federal law 
enforcement, including the victims’ 
families in the case file review and re-
investigation process. That means no-
tifying them and giving them hope; 
provide written certification to a des-
ignated family member if a final re-
view is not necessary; update that fam-
ily member throughout the case file re-
view and full reinvestigation; and meet 
with and discuss the evidence with that 
family member if a full reinvestigation 
is not pursued. 
There is nothing like closure. It has 
been shown that cold case investiga-
tions can be very effective by using 
agents and investigators who have 
never worked the cases before, and by 
deploying 
up-to-date 
investigative 
techniques. Cold case investigations 
help take violent criminals off the 
street and to bring closure. 
Let me take note of the fact that the 
Judiciary Committee as a whole is very 
active in pursuing the issue of cold 
cases to the extent that this Depart-
ment of Justice has established a unit 
that works on it. I would say, however, 
an infusion of energy and excitement 
and utilization of this effort would be 
welcomed because this is an important 
message and effort for our families. 
In 2010, the FBI and a cold case detec-
tive began a joint reexamination of the 
death of Ellen Beason in 1985, whose re-
mains were found south of Houston in 
an area called the killing fields. Al-
most 30 years later, the cold case de-
tective requested x-rays of the body 
which showed that the woman’s skull 
had been cracked on both sides from a 
forceful blow. Her body had never been 
x-rayed. 
The main suspect in the murder was 
finally convicted of involuntary man-
slaughter in 2014. He was sentenced to 
20 years in prison, and was named as 
the leading suspect in the murder of 
other women found in the killing 
fields, though he was never charged. 
H.R. 3359 mandates that a law en-
forcement agency must conduct a full 
reinvestigation 
like 
the 
one 
that 
brought justice to Ellen Beason’s fam-
ily if probative investigative leads re-
sult from a full investigation. How nec-
essary this is for mourning and very, 
very devastated families. 
This bipartisan legislation represents 
an important step in fostering renewed 
hope for families and is supported by a 
broad array of advocates, including the 
Federal Law Enforcement Officers As-
sociation, the National Organization of 
Parents of Murdered Children, the Na-
tional Coalition Against Domestic Vio-
lence, and the Association of Pros-
ecuting Attorneys. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to Con-
gressman ERIC SWALWELL, a member of 
the House Judiciary Committee, for his 
passion on this issue and his astute 
continued effort on this bipartisan bill 
that will bring light and hope to fami-
lies of victims who seek justice for 
their loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill today, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3359, the Homicide Victims’ Families’ 
Rights Act of 2021. This bill creates a 
process for relatives of homicide vic-
tims to request that Federal agencies 
rereview the case of their lost family 
member once the case has gone cold. 
To be clear, this bill would only 
apply to Federal cases of murder, and 
it wouldn’t apply to murder cases in-
vestigated by State and local law en-
forcement, which are most cases. 
The majority of cold cases at issue 
under this bill are likely to be cases 
arising from Tribal jurisdictions. For-
tunately, 
President 
Trump 
already 
took steps to try to solve cold cases in 
Tribal jurisdictions. In November of 
2019, President Trump signed an execu-
tive order to create the Operation Lady 
Justice Task Force. 
In its first year, this task force 
opened seven offices across the country 
to address the number of missing and 
murdered indigenous women. The task 
force held listening sessions, Tribal 
consultations, webinars, meetings with 
law enforcement, and victims’ services 
programs, and formed domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault coalitions.

The task force put out guidance and 
protocols, developed relationships with 
entities like missing persons clearing-
houses, began training for investiga-
tors and volunteers, and started a pub-
lic awareness campaign. This was all in 
2020. 
This legislation is cut from similar 
cloth as President Trump’s executive 
order creating that task force. Hope-
fully, it will motivate the Biden ad-
ministration 
to 
continue President 
Trump’s good work. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SWALWELL), the author 
and leader of this bill. I thank him so 
much for his very astute leadership. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her contin-
ued leadership in this area and the gen-
tleman from Oregon for his support. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation plainly 
says and will plainly make so that the 
sun will never set on justice for victims 
of homicides and their families seeking 
closure. 
I want to thank the chairman and 
ranking member for their unanimous 
support of my bill, H.R. 3359, the Homi-
cide Victims’ Families’ Rights Act of 
2021. I really appreciate the majority 
leader and the Speaker for allowing 
this measure to be considered before 
the floor today. 
I also want to thank my co-lead on 
this legislation, former Federal pros-
ecutor, Congressman MIKE
MCCAUL 
from Texas, for his dedication to bring-
ing justice to victims of unsolved 
homicides. 
His 
perspective, 
having 
served in the Federal courts, brought 
with him a wealth of knowledge on 
criminal investigations at both the 
State and Federal level. 
I also want to acknowledge former 
Assistant United States Attorney from 
the District of Columbia, Glenn Kirsch-
ner, who worked with my office, after 
spending many years serving as a pros-
ecutor in the District of Columbia to 
detail the pain and suffering that far 
too many families face when they see 
their loved ones’ cases go unsolved. Mr. 
Kirschner’s expertise has been invalu-
able as I drafted this legislation to en-
sure no victim is forgotten. 
I also have relied upon my own expe-
rience as a prosecutor, knowing that 
no jury verdict, no criminal sentence 
can bring back to life a lost loved one. 
However, I have been in the courtroom 
when a guilty verdict is delivered in a 
murder case and I have seen the clo-
sure that the families experience when 
that occurs for them. 
I have also met with a number of 
families where they have not yet seen 
their family member’s killer brought 
to justice. There is a marked dif-
ference. This revitalizes the review and 
reinvestigation processes for cold case 
homicide files. Upon request by a loved 
one or a family member 3 years after a 
case goes cold, my legislation requires 
a complete reexamination of the file 
and accompanying evidence, new or re-
newed interviews with potential sub-
jects and witnesses and other methods 
to identify possible missteps. 
b 1715 
Improvements 
in 
technology, 
re-
sources, and evidence-based techniques 
will also better equip law enforcement 
agencies with tools they need to review 
files under a novel lens, one that would 
assist in identifying new leads and wit-
nesses to solve crimes and obtain jus-
tice that victims’ families and loved 
ones so rightfully deserve. 
It also assists investigators in homi-
cide cases that serve important under-
served communities such as Native 
Americans 
on 
Indian 
Reservations, 
Federal law enforcement officers killed 
in action, U.S. citizens who are mur-
dered abroad, or homicides that take 
place on Federal land and the high 
seas. 
It will also serve as a crucial model 
for the States to look at a Federal law 
that could inspire in their own States, 
the ability to adopt a local Homicide 
Victims Bill of Rights. 
This law enforcement with additional 
disaggregated and detailed information 
about cold case homicides that will as-
sist agencies across State lines to help 
triangulate homicide trends and inves-
tigate and identify new leads. Valuable 
information, combined with existing 
commitments toward finding justice 
for unsolved murders, has led to full 
endorsements of my bill by both advo-
cacy groups and law enforcement asso-
ciations alike. 
The need for this bill is great. And 
every year, countless homicides leave 
mothers and fathers without children, 
spouses widowed, and sons and daugh-
ters without parents. The crimes spare 
no one, whether it is the unfortunate 
victim, or the family member who is 
left with lasting shock, turmoil, and 
grief. And after all, murder never dis-
criminates, nor does it prioritize. 
Special care is especially needed for 
cold case crimes. The FBI Uniform 
Crime Report estimates 250,000 homi-
cides cases are unsolved. And as of 
today, we have more than 3,000 un-
solved homicide cases right here in our 
own Nation’s Capital. The number of 
unsolved homicides that eventually at-
tain cold-case status increases each 
year by an average of 6,000. 
That is why I am urging my friends 
on both sides of the aisle to swiftly 
pass H.R. 3359, and to join our col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee 
who unanimously supported the pas-
sage of this legislation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a member 
of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
Homicide Victims’ Families’ Rights 
Act, legislation that will help tackle 
the backlog of cold cases and bring 
long overdue justice to more than a 
quarter of a million unresolved or un-
solved murder cases. 
It is estimated that every murder 
victim leaves behind more than four 
family members. This means that more 
than a million grieving loved ones, 
families, friends, and communities, are 
still waiting for answers. 
And this is not just a problem in 
older cases. In 2017, the FBI Uniform 
Crime Report estimated that across all 
levels of law enforcement, investiga-
tors were only able to close 62 percent 
of murder cases. We can help remedy 
this with the Homicide Victims’ Fami-
lies’ Rights Act. 
This bill empowers families by af-
fording them the right to have their 
loved ones’ homicide cases examined 
by a Federal investigator to see if the 
case should be reinvestigated. 
This is an important review process 
to establish, especially since our tech-
nological and scientific investigation 
techniques are constantly evolving and 
being improved, providing law enforce-
ment new tools to investigate even the 
oldest of cold cases. 
This is a straightforward, smart bill 
that will hopefully bring peace to vic-
tims’ loved ones who are too often left 
in the dark. 
I want to thank my friend and col-
league, Congressman SWALWELL, for his 
extraordinary leadership on this bipar-
tisan bill and encourage all my col-
leagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a national victims’ organization group 
coalition letter of support; individual 
letters of support from The American 
Investigative Society of Cold Cases, 
Parents of Murdered Children, Inc., and 
Murder Accountability Project; and in-
dividual letters of support from the As-
sociation of Prosecuting Attorneys, 
and the Federal Law Enforcement Offi-
cers Association.

evant resources to law enforcement agencies 
by updating and categorizing the types of 
crimes that lead to homicide, cold cases. 
With our collective goals towards supporting 
families and loved ones who seek justice for 
unsolved, crimes, we collectively agree that 
HVFRA will provide important resources 
which will provide justice. 
The HVFRA assists families and loved ones 
of homicide victims by: 
Reinvigorating reviews of cold case mur-
ders files. Reviews are initiated upon request 
by a loved one or family member three years 
after a case goes ‘‘cold.’’ A case is ‘‘cold’’ if 
no suspect is readily identifiable and all 
leads have been exhausted. 
Providing a full reinvestigation using the 
most up-to-date technologies and investiga-
tive standards. Following a review request, if 
law enforcement concludes that new pro-
bative investigative leads would result, a full 
re-analysis must be undertaken. This in-
cludes a complete review of the file and ac-
companying evidence, new or renewed inter-
views with potential subjects and witnesses, 
and other methods to identify possible 
missed steps. 
Increasing transparency in national crime 
databases. The National Institute of Justice 
would annually publish detailed statistics on 
the number of cold cases, aggregated by the 
types of associated crimes and agency. This 
information will assist law enforcement 
agencies across state lines to help identify 
trends and hopefully find new leads. 
Ensuring reviews and reinvestigations are 
working. Federal law enforcement agencies 
would be required to provide annual reports 
to Congress on what is working and what is 
not working with new investigations. This 
will aide in ensuring that programs are bi-
ased towards assisting family members and 
loved ones find justice. 
The undersigned organizations proudly 
support the HVFRA. This important legisla-
tion is completely aligned with our collec-
tive commitment towards assisting those 
who suffer following a cold case homicide. It 
is our hope that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee will promptly markup this legislation 
so that it can be received before the full 
House floor for swift passage.

support the HVFRA. This important legisla-
tion is completely aligned with our collec-
tive commitment towards assisting those 
who suffer following a cold case homicide. It 
is our hope that the House Judiciary Com-

will 
promptly 
markup 
this 
legis}ation so that it can be received before 
the fall House floor for swift passage.

MEMBER JORDAN: The National Organization 
of Parents Of Murdered Children (POMC), a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to solely to 
the aftermath and prevention of murder. 
POMC makes the difference through on- 
going emotional support, education, preven-
tion, advocacy and awareness. POMC is very 
supportive of the Homicide Victims’ Fami-
lies Right Act under consideration before 
your commlttee. 
POMC has many families of victims of un- 
solved homicides. We listen to the survivor 
talk about the story of their loved one’s 
homicide and the questions they have be-
cause it has not been solved. Their emotions, 
frustration and devastation they feel, along 
with the helplessness that anything can be 
done to bring justice and closure to the mur-
der of their loved one. 
POMC has a program called Second Opin-
ion Service that we refer families to when in-
vestigators have not been able to solve the 
case or don’t understand why the case is not 
going to court. The Second Opinion Service 
is made up of retired law enforcement, med-
ical examiners, prosecutors who volunteer 
their time to look at the family’s case and 
they will give their opinion to the family. 
Most of the time these are cold cases and we 
will not look at an open case. The family’s 
are relieved and comforted that someone will 
look at the case. This is why the ‘‘Support 
Homicide Victims’ Families Rights Act’’ 
would be so important to a family whose 
loved one’s case is a cold case and just the 
thought that law enforcement would look at 
it again is comforting to them. 
POMC believes that the policies within the 
Homicide Victims’ Families Rights Act 
should be Adopted by law enforcement agen-
cies as best practices for unresolved murder. 
It is our hope that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee will promptly markup this legislation 
so that it can be received before the full 
House floor for swift passage.

the Homicide Victims’ Families Rights Act. 
More specifically, this legislation allows 
family members or loved ones to seek addi-

that have achieved a ‘‘cold case’’ status. It 
would also ensure that older files are re-

profit organization whose mission is to sup-
port and enhance the effectiveness of pros-
ecutors in their efforts to create safer com-
munities. We are a national organization 
supporting all prosecutors, including both 
appointed and elected, as well as their depu-

On behalf of the APA, I am writing in sup-
port of your efforts regarding the proposed 
Homicide Victims’ Families Rights Act. This 
Act will give homicide victims’ families and 
loved ones a reignited hope that justice may 
still be afforded to the victims of these 
crimes. The provisions in this Act will grant 
the opportunity for cold cases to be reopened 
so that new investigations, utilizing the lat-
est testing and investigative techniques, 
may produce results which previous methods 
were unable to achieve. With the steady in-
crease of cold cases this Act is integral to 
providing an opportunity to ensure that jus-
tice is upheld in our communities. 
The APA remains committed to working 
with congressional leaders, victims’ families 
and loved ones, and victims’ rights organiza-
tions in support of this Act. We believe that 
this Act will not only aid the grieving fami-
lies and communities but will improve the 
entirety of the criminal justice system. 
APA appreciates your time and efforts on 
the Homicide Victims’ Families Rights Act.

DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE
SWALWELL: 
We 
write to you today on behalf of the 30,000 fed-
eral law enforcement members in FLEOA to 
express our strong support for H.R 3359, 
‘‘Homicide Victims Rights Act of 2021.’’ 
The loss of a family member is tragic, 
made more so when they are the victim of a 
crime that remains unsolved. It is impera-
tive that all families have a resolution. As 
technologies have improved, the chance of 
getting to that resolution of a crime has also 
dramatically improved. Agencies with these 
types of cases should endeavor to use every 
modern means available to review these 
cases and if possible, bring the new tech-
nologies and science to bear to try to solve 
them. These agencies will also be more capa-
ble if resourced and funded appropriately in 
this important work. 
Thank you again for your leadership on 
this effort. We look forward to continuing to 
work with you on these matters and if we 
can be of any additional assistance, feel free 
to contact us. 
Sincerely, 
LARRY COSME, 
National 
President, 
Federal 
Law 
En-
forcement 
Officers 
Association. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me thank the gentleman from 
Oregon for his support of this legisla-
tion; and as well, again thank Mr. 
SWALWELL
for that commitment to 
helping families who are typically des-
perate for help in these cold cases. 
Let me cite as a comparison that 
does not deal with the end of a case, 
but it does deal with the intervention 
of the Federal Government, the FBI, in 
particular, on a child predator case in 
a local neighborhood, where local law 
enforcement were doing their very 
best. 
But when we were able to reach out 
to the FBI, although the case was not 
cold in its conclusion, it was cold in its 
investigation, its current investiga-
tion, and the FBI did bring new and 
fresh eyes to help us with that terrible 
case. 
So when we have cases that are a 
cold case, the backlog of cold case mur-
ders continues to grow, and I think this 
legislation means a lot to these fami-
lies. When they grow cold, this means 
that thousands of murderers evade 
prosecution and continue to walk the 
streets, able to commit more crimes 
and possibly more murders, while thou-
sands of mothers, fathers, husbands, 
wives, sons, and daughters, have yet to 
find closure in the loss of their loved 
ones. 
And let me just say, Mr. Speaker, I 
think you realize, that pain is so deep, 
and it never goes away. That is why 
this bill is so important. This legisla-
tion would result in more closed cases, 
justice for victims, closure for their 
families, and greater faith in law en-
forcement. 
Mr. Speaker, again I want to indicate 
that this bill is important. I thank my 
colleagues for supporting this bill in a 
bipartisan manner, and I ask them to 
join me in supporting this bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I support 
H.R. 3359, the ‘‘Homicide Victims’ Families’ 
Rights Act of 2021,’’ and urge my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation, which es-
tablishes a procedure for families of murder 
victims, in cases investigated at the federal 
level, to continue to pursue justice for their 
murdered family member when the trail has 
gone cold. 
This legislation gives a designated family 
member the right to request a review of their 
murdered loved one’s case file after three 
years. 
Unfortunately, four out of ten murder victims’ 
families in this country never receive any clo-
sure in the loss of their family member. 
FBI data shows the percentage of homi-
cides cleared by an arrest or other means has 
declined significantly from 1965 to today while 
the number of unsolved homicides grows by 
the thousands nationwide every year. 
In 2019, four Texas cities, including Hous-
ton, cleared 40 percent or less of reported 
homicides, according to FBI statistics. 
Low clearance rates lead to low confidence 
in law enforcement and reduced citizen co-
operation, which lead to even lower clearance 
rates. 
The backlog of cases and low clearance 
rates disproportionately affect murder victims 
who are poor, undereducated, unemployed, 
and black. 
Poor, black, and brown victims and their 
families tend to receive less attention to their 
cases from law enforcement than those of 
other socioeconomic backgrounds and racial 
groups and their cases go unsolved. 
This disparate treatment is unacceptable. 
We can and we must provide justice for all 
victims and their families. 
I hope this legislation will set a new tone— 
eliminating disparate treatment—impacting vul-
nerable communities of poor black and brown 
families who oftentimes never receive closure, 
while serving as a model for state, local, and 
tribal governments where the vast majority of 
unsolved murders lie. 
H.R. 3359 will require federal law enforce-
ment agencies, using ‘‘fresh eyes,’’ to com-
plete a case file review and determine if a full 
reinvestigation could lead to new probative in-
vestigative leads. 
This legislation will encourage equitable 
treatment of victims and their families by re-
quiring that federal law enforcement: (1) in-
clude the victim’s family in the case file review 
and reinvestigation process; (2) provide written 
certification to a designated family member if 
final review is not necessary; (3) update that 
family member throughout the case file review 
and full reinvestigation; and (4) meet with and 
discuss the evidence with that family member 
if a full reinvestigation is not pursued. 
It has been shown that cold case investiga-
tions can be very effective. By using agents 
and investigators who have never worked the 
cases before and by deploying up-to-date in-
vestigative techniques, cold case investiga-
tions help take violent criminals off the street 
and bring closure to families. 
In 2010, the FBI and a cold case detective 
began a joint reexamination of the death of 
Ellen Beason in 1985, whose remains were 
found south of Houston in an area called the 
‘‘Killing Fields.’’ 
Almost thirty years later, the cold case de-
tective requested x-rays of the body, which 
showed that the woman’s skull had been 
cracked on both sides from a forceful blow. 
Her body had never been X-rayed. 
The main suspect in the murder was finally 
convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2014, 
sentenced to 20 years in prison, and named 
as the leading suspect in the murder of other 
women found in the Killing Fields, though he 
was never charged. 
H.R. 3359 mandates that a law enforcement 
agency must conduct a full reinvestigation like 
the one that brought justice to Ellen Beason’s

result from a full reinvestigation. 
This bipartisan legislation represents an im-
portant step in fostering renewed hope for 
families and is supported by a broad array of 
advocates, including the Federal Law Enforce-
ment Officers Association, the National Orga-
nization of Parents of Murdered Children, the 
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 
and the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. 
I thank Chairman ERIC SWALWELL for his as-
tute effort on this bipartisan bill that will help 
families of victims seek justice for their loved 
ones. 
The backlog of cold case murders continues 
to grow nationally. This means that thousands 
of murderers evade prosecution and continue 
to walk the streets, able to commit more 
crimes, and possibly more murders, while 
thousands of mothers, fathers, husbands, 
wives, sons, and daughters have yet to find 
closure in the loss of their loved ones. 
That is why this bill is so important. This 
legislation would result in more closed cases, 
justice for victims, closure for their families, 
and greater faith in law enforcement. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in sup-
porting this bill today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3359, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the

in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

PROHIBITING PUNISHMENT OF 
ACQUITTED CONDUCT ACT OF 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1621) to amend section 3661 of 
title 18, United States Code, to prohibit 
the consideration of acquitted conduct 
at sentencing, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1621 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prohibiting

end. 
(2) APPLICABILITY.—The amendment made 
by paragraph (1) shall apply only to a judg-
ment entered on or after the date of enact-
ment of this Act.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on H.R. 1621. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to sup-
port H.R. 1621, the Prohibiting Punish-
ment of Acquitted Conduct Act, which 
offers a solution to a long-identified 
problem within our criminal justice 
system. 
This bill provides necessary reform 
to current Federal sentencing practice 
that allows judges to sentence defend-
ants based on conduct for which a jury 
has found them not guilty. 
The Sixth Amendment to the Con-
stitution provides that anyone accused 
of a crime shall enjoy the right to a 
speedy and public jury trial, while the 
Fifth Amendment provides that no per-
son shall be deprived of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law. 
These provisions mean that the gov-
ernment is bound to move each and 
every element of an offense for which a 
defendant is charged beyond a reason-
able doubt during a jury trial, or that 
defendant must admit each element of 
an offense to support a plea of guilty. 
Absent that, those offenses are not 
found guilty, if you will, to the indi-
vidual. 
Notwithstanding this constitutional 
obligation, Federal judges routinely 
nullify not guilty verdicts rendered by 
juries and sentence defendants to sig-
nificantly higher penalties based on ac-
quitted conduct. 
In its current form, 18 U.S.C. 3661 
prohibits any limitation of the conduct 
a judge may consider when sentencing 
a defendant, even when a jury has de-
termined that there was insufficient 
evidence to prove the defendant com-
mitted the charged offense; it seems 
clearly a constitutional violation. 
Additionally, under the concept of 
‘‘relevant conduct,’’ the U.S. Sen-
tencing Guidelines allow judges to con-
sider a range of conduct, including dis-
missed charges, uncharged conduct, 
and acquitted conduct when imposing 
sentences. Again, might I say, seem-
ingly a very unfair direction given 
without 
limitations, 
and 
certainly 
without adherence to the constitu-
tional amendments. 
The fact-finding made by judges at 
sentencing is based on a lower evi-
dentiary standard than at trial—that 
is, by a preponderance of evidence— 
which many scholars defined as a 50 
percent chance that a claim is true. 
The reform proposed in this bill en-
sures that judges punish defendants on 
facts 
proven 
beyond 
a 
reasonable 
doubt, criminal standard, the higher 
evidentiary standard of proof required 
during a jury trial, which some schol-
ars attach a value of 90 to 95 percent 
surety. 
Justice Ginsberg, a moderate liberal 
who became more liberal in later 
years, joined Justice Thomas and Jus-
tice Scalia, a staunch conservative, in 
his dissent in Jones v. United States, 
lamenting the failure of the Court to 
determine if the Sixth Amendment is 
violated when judges impose sentences 
based solely on judge-found facts. 
While the Sentencing Guidelines sug-
gested prison sentences from 27 to 71 
months for the three defendants in the 
case, the trial judge imposed—if you 
can believe it—overwhelming sentences 
of 180, 194, and 225 months, based on the 
conduct 
the 
prosecution 
failed 
to 
prove. 
Justice Scalia’s often-quoted dissent 
was issued more than 7 years ago. Yet 
nothing has been done about this un-
just, undemocratic practice and, real-
ly, unconstitutional, which diminishes 
the sanctity of the jury trial, the 
standard of reasonable doubt, which 
any layman can tell you. When you ask 
them what the standard is for proving 
guilt or innocence in a criminal trial, 
everybody knows the words, ‘‘with rea-
sonable doubt.’’ 
Can you imagine? That is not the 
case.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3881 
March 28, 2022 
The public check on the govern-
ment’s power and the overall integrity 
of the criminal justice system must be 
maintained. 
H.R. 1621 would restore fairness to 
jury trials by amending Section 3661 to 
ban consideration of acquitted conduct 
at sentencing unless the conduct is 
considered for mitigation purposes. 
Though I wish we were doing more to 
advance substantive criminal justice 
reform, I am happy to support this bi-
partisan bill that addresses an acute 
need while restoring the basic propo-
sitions of due process and the right to 
a trial by jury. 
I want to express enthusiastic sup-
port and appreciation to Representa-
tive STEVE COHEN, chair of the Sub-
committee on the Constitution, Civil 
Rights and Civil Liberties, for his com-
mitment to justice and for taking the 
lead on this significant, bipartisan bill, 
along with Representative KELLY ARM-
STRONG. 
A broad coalition of advocates sup-
port this measure, including—R Street 
Institute, the ACLU, The Innocence 
Project, Brennan Center for Justice, 
the American Bar Association, Fami-
lies Against Mandatory Minimums, 
The Leadership Conference on Civil 
and Human Rights, and the Federal 
Public and Community Defenders. 
It is for that reason I hope that the 
Senate will take up this bill and pass 
the House version as soon as possible. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
bill and to continue working on addi-
tional measures to make our justice 
system more equitable and more trans-
parent. I look forward to coming to the 
floor with those initiatives. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1621, the Prohibiting Punishment of 
Acquitted Conduct Act of 2021. 
The Sixth Amendment of the Con-
stitution ensures that criminal defend-
ants have the right to a trial by jury. 
This right is so important that our 
Founding Fathers preserved it in the 
Bill of Rights. It is a hallmark of our 
great country and one of the many 
things that separates us from other 
countries. 
Our commitment to trial by jury 
means we accept the jury’s decision 
whether we agree with it or not. 
This bill would prohibit Federal 
judges from increasing a defendant’s 
sentence based on conduct for which 
the defendant had been acquitted by a 
jury. 
In 1987, the United States Sentencing 
Commission established Federal sen-
tencing guidelines. These guidelines 
allow judges to consider conduct that 
was not formally charged or proven be-
yond a reasonable doubt at a trial, so 
long as the judge finds the conduct rel-
evant by a preponderance of the evi-
dence. 
There are numerous examples of this 
happening. Judges have intervened to 
overrule the determinations of juries 
and have handed down harsher sen-
tences after considering conduct for 
which 
the 
defendants 
have 
been 
charged and acquitted. 
b 1730 
Allowing judges to consider acquitted 
conduct punishes people for a crime for 
which they have not been convicted. It 
is wrong and violates the spirit of our 
Bill of Rights. 
Both Justice Kavanaugh and the late 
Justice Antonin Scalia recognized the 
fundamental unfairness of using ac-
quitted conduct at sentencing. Both 
said it must stop. 
In 2015, as a judge on the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, then- 
Judge Kavanaugh wrote: ‘‘Allowing 
judges to rely on acquitted or un-
charged conduct to impose higher sen-
tences than they otherwise would im-
pose seems a dubious infringement on 
the rights to due process and to a jury 
trial.’’ 
I agree with Justice Scalia and Jus-
tice Kavanaugh. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), the author of 
this legislation; the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on the Constitution, 
Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties of the 
Committee on the Judiciary; and a 
strong advocate for justice. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, first, I 
want to take a point of personal privi-
lege. This is the first day that I have 
walked into the House without Don 
Young being in it. 
Don Young was an outstanding Con-
gressman and a good human being. He 
was my friend. Every day I walked in 
those doors and he sat on the aisle, I 
would say hello, and we would talk. 
This is the first day he hasn’t been 
there to say hello. 
I will join with other Members to me-
morialize him in the services tomorrow 
here in the Capitol and also at his 
church in Virginia on Wednesday. Mr. 
YOUNG was the dean of the House, just 
a good human being, and he had a won-
derful wife. 
On this bill, I want to thank Mr. 
ARMSTRONG for working with me on it. 
He was a strong proponent of the bill, 
and it is truly bipartisan and bi-
cameral. It has already passed the Sen-
ate in some form, I believe. 
It has been mentioned that Justice 
Scalia was a great proponent of this, as 
was 
Justice 
Ginsburg 
and 
Justice 
Kavanaugh. 
Mr. BENTZ and Ms. JACKSON LEE have 
made all the arguments. I have a few 
pages of speeches here, but there is no 
reason to read them. A long time ago, 
I was told if you make the sale, sit 
down. The sale has been made, I be-
lieve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to 
vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 1621, the 
Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct 
Act. This bill is a bipartisan, bicameral effort to 
prevent judges from punishing defendants for 
conduct they have not been found to be guilty 
of. I’d like to begin by thanking my co-lead on 
this bill, Congressman KELLY ARMSTRONG, for 
all his hard work on this issue. 
The U.S. Constitution’s Fifth and Sixth 
Amendments guarantee the right to due proc-
ess and the right to a jury trial for those ac-
cused of a crime—these are two foundational 
principles meant to foster justice and fairness 
in the American criminal legal system. These 
rights ensure that we are presumed to be in-
nocent unless and until the government 
proves a defendant’s guilt to a Jury. 
Our system requires the government to 
prove an individual’s guilt to a jury beyond a 
reasonable doubt; however, under current fed-
eral law, judges may impose sentencing en-
hancements for conduct that they find to have 
been committed based on a less demanding 
standard—preponderance of the evidence. 
The result of this discrepancy in the law is 
that even if a defendant has been found by a 
jury of their peers to not be guilty of a crime, 
a judge may still use and consider that con-
duct for the purposes of sentencing them. This 
means that people are spending time in jail for 
conduct that the government failed to prove 
they had committed, and a jury has acquitted 
them of. 
This 
is 
entirely 
antithetical 
to 
the 
foundational principles of our criminal justice 
system and Constitution—it not only under-
mines due process, but it undercuts the impor-
tant role juries play in our criminal system by 
allowing judges to sentence individuals for 
conduct regardless of the decision of the jury. 
The Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted 
Conduct Act would correct this inexplicable 
discrepancy by prohibiting the consideration of 
such acquitted conduct in sentencing by fed-
eral judges, unless being considered for the 
purpose of mitigating a sentence. This would 
ensure that no one spends time in jail for con-
duct prosecutors were not able to prove at 
trial. 
It does so by amending Section 3661 of 
Title 18 to expressly state that, except for pur-
poses of mitigating a sentence, a court of the 
United States shall not consider acquitted con-
duct when sentencing a defendant. 
Ending the consideration of acquitted con-
duct is and should be a bipartisan effort—two 
of the fiercest champions of this policy position 
include the late Justices Ginsburg and Scalia. 
Allowing judges to continue to sentence de-
fendants based on conduct they have been 
acquitted of demeans and diminishes due 
process and is a blatant attack on the Con-
stitutional rights of Americans. We must pre-
serve and protect these rights by passing the 
Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct 
Act. 
No one should be put behind bars for some-
thing the government was unable to prove 
they did to a jury of their peers beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bicameral, bipartisan bill to end 
this un-American practice. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield as 
much time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. 
ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Prohibiting 
Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3882 
March 28, 2022 
I thank Mr. COHEN for introducing this 
important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, due process is more 
than an ideal. It is a fundamental right 
enshrined in our law. The Constitution 
confirms that right and explicitly en-
sures procedural fairness to those ac-
cused and convicted of crimes. Yet, the 
criminal justice system often grants 
judges with discretion to increase the 
length and severity of punishment 
based on conduct for which an indi-
vidual was proven not guilty. 
We can all agree that holding crimi-
nals accountable is essential to law and 
order. However, sentencing based on 
acquitted conduct is an affront to all 
Americans’ constitutional rights. The 
Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted 
Conduct Act will bring an end to this 
unfair practice. 
This bipartisan, bicameral legisla-
tion bars judges from considering an 
individual’s acquitted conduct during 
sentencing, except for purposes of miti-
gating a sentence. 
This bill is a crucial step toward re-
storing some fairness in our criminal 
justice system and commands a broad 
coalition of support, including Senate 
Judiciary Committee Chairman DICK 
DURBIN, the ACLU, Americans for Pros-
perity, and the American Conservative 
Union. 
I thank both Chairman NADLER and 
Ranking Member JORDAN for moving 
this bill through the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
One last thing: Judges have a range 
of sentences in the sentencing guide-
lines. Prosecutors, after conviction, 
make recommendations. There is a pre-
trial sentencing report. Again, the sen-
tencing can vary very highly up and 
down in that vein. There is absolutely 
no reason, in the interest of justice or 
fairness, 
where 
acquitted 
conduct 
needs to be used in sentencing offend-
ers. 
Mr. COHEN. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. BENTZ. I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say how much I enjoyed working with 
Mr. ARMSTRONG on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
When I came back for the new Con-
gress and he wasn’t on the committee, 
that was a loss. But it has been good to 
work with him on this bill, and he has 
worked on this in the past. I appreciate 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to incor-
porate by reference everything that 
Mr. ARMSTRONG said into my previous 
lack of remarks. It can be done. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I thank the gentleman from Oregon 
for supporting this legislation. He cited 
a number of judges and courts who 
added their support to this important 
legislation. 
Mr. COHEN’s eloquence was in the ef-
forts he has made to help those who 
have suffered injustice. 
We thank Congressman ARMSTRONG 
for his work as well. The fact that they 
are speaking in tandem speaks loudly 
on this floor. 
As I close, I include in the RECORD 
the dissenting opinion of Justices 
Scalia, Thomas, and Ginsburg, with 
simple comments from their opinion: 
‘‘On petitioners’ appeal, the D.C. Cir-
cuit held that even if their sentences 
would have been substantively unrea-
sonable but for judge-found facts, their 
Sixth Amendment rights were not vio-
lated.’’ 
That was found by the D.C. Circuit. 
‘‘We should grant certiorari to put an 
end to the unbroken string of cases dis-
regarding the Sixth Amendment.’’ 
So, you are more than affirmed that 
the Sixth Amendment in these cases is 
patently disregarded. 
I include in the RECORD the Supreme 
Court dissent on the Jones v. United 
States case. 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
JOSEPH JONES, DESMOND THURSTON, AND 
ANTWUAN, BALL V. UNITED STATES 
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE 
UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT 
No. 13–10026.—Decided October 14, 2014 
The petition for a writ of certiorari is de-
nied. 
JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOM-
AS and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting 
from denial of certiorari. 
A jury convicted petitioners Joseph Jones, 
Desmond Thurston, and Antwuan Ball of dis-
tributing very small amounts of crack co-
caine, and acquitted them of conspiring to 
distribute drugs. The sentencing judge, how-
ever, found that they had engaged in the 
charged conspiracy and, relying largely on 
that finding, imposed sentences that peti-
tioners say were many times longer than 
those the Guidelines would otherwise have 
recommended. 
Petitioners present a strong case that, but 
for the judge’s finding of fact, their sen-
tences would have been ‘‘substantively un-
reasonable’’ and therefore illegal. See Rita v. 
United States, 551 U.S. 338, 372 (2007) (SCALIA, 
J., joined by THOMAS, J., concurring in part 
and concurring in judgment). If so, their con-
stitutional rights were violated. The Sixth 
Amendment, together with the Fifth Amend-
ment’s Due Process Clause, ‘‘requires that 
each element of a crime’’ be either admitted 
by the defendant, or ‘‘proved to the jury be-
yond a reasonable doubt.’’ Alleyne v. United 
States, 570 U.S. ll, ll (2013) (slip op., at 3). 
Any fact that increases the penalty to which 
a defendant is exposed constitutes an ele-
ment of a crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 
U.S. 466, 483, n. 10, 490 (2000), and ‘‘must be 
found by a jury, not a judge,’’ Cunningham v. 
California, 549 U.S. 270, 281 (2007).* We have 
held that a substantively unreasonable pen-
alty is illegal and must be set aside. Gall v. 
United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). It unavoid-
ably follows that any fact necessary to pre-
vent a sentence from being substantively un-
reasonable—thereby exposing the defendant 
to the longer sentence—is an element that 
must be either admitted by the defendant or 
found by the jury. It may not be found by a 
judge. 
For years, however, we have refrained from 
saying so. In Rita v. United States, we dis-
missed the possibility of Sixth Amendment 
violations resulting from substantive reason-
ableness review as hypothetical and not pre-
sented by the facts of the case. We thus left 
for another day the question whether the 
Sixth Amendment is violated when courts 
impose sentences that, but for a judge-found 
fact, would be reversed for substantive 
unreasonableness. 551 U.S., at 353; see also 
id., at 366 (Stevens, J., joined in part by 
GINSBURG, J., concurring) (‘‘Such a hypo-
thetical case should be decided if and when it 
arises’’). Nonetheless, the Courts of Appeals 
have uniformly taken our continuing silence 
to suggest that the Constitution does permit 
otherwise unreasonable sentences supported 
by judicial factfinding, so long as they are 
within the statutory range. See, e.g., United 
States v. Benkahla, 530 F. 3d 300, 312 (CA4 
2008); United States v. Hernandez, 633 F. 3d 370, 
374 (CA5 2011); United States v. Ashqar, 582 F. 
3d 819, 824–825 (CA7 2009); United States v. 
Treadwell, 593 F. 3d 990, 1017–1018 (CA9 2010); 
United States v. Redcorn, 528 F. 3d 727, 745–746 
(CA10 2008). 
This has gone on long enough. The present 
petition presents the case the Court claimed 
to have been waiting for. And it is a particu-
larly appealing case, because not only did no 
jury convict these defendants of the offense 
the sentencing judge thought them guilty of, 
but a jury acquitted them of that offense. Pe-
titioners were convicted of distributing 
drugs, but acquitted of conspiring to dis-
tribute drugs. The sentencing judge found 
that petitioners had engaged in the con-
spiracy of which the jury acquitted them. 
The 
Guidelines, 
petitioners 
claim, 
rec-
ommend sentences of between 27 and 71 
months for their distribution convictions. 
But in light of the conspiracy finding, the 
court calculated much higher Guidelines 
ranges, and sentenced Jones, Thurston, and 
Ball to 180, 194, and 225 months’ imprison-
ment. 
On petitioners’ appeal, the D.C. Circuit 
held that even if their sentences would have 
been substantively unreasonable but for 
judge-found facts, their Sixth Amendment 
rights were not violated. 744 F. 3d 1362, 1369 
(2014). We should grant certiorari to put an 
end to the unbroken string of cases dis-
regarding 
the 
Sixth 
Amendment—or 
to 
eliminate the Sixth Amendment difficulty 
by acknowledging that all sentences below 
the statutory maximum are substantively 
reasonable. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I will say that 
the failure to address this issue for so 
many years has contributed to the 
epidemics 
of 
overincarceration 
and 
mass incarceration, weakened the fi-
nality that a jury trial is meant to pro-
vide, and undermined overall public 
confidence in our justice system. 
I really think this legislation has ex-
posed some incredulous behavior be-
cause most people believe that you are 
sentenced on the reasonable doubt con-
victions as opposed to additional side-
bar conversations that may come to 
the judge’s attention in terms of other 
offenses. 
Today, we consider a simple, nar-
rowly tailored bill that builds on our 
bipartisan effort to create a fair justice 
system. This bill will make sure that 
defendants are punished only for the 
conduct that prosecutors are able to 
prove at trial, consistent with the con-
stitutional guarantees of due process 
and the right to a trial by jury of their 
peers, and consistent with the prin-
ciples on which country was founded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3883 
March 28, 2022 
Before I close, I join with my col-
league from Tennessee’s remarks and 
indicate the deepest sympathy to the 
family of the dean, Congressman Don 
Young. He is a voice—and I speak in 
the present. His presence was larger 
than life. He spoke to everyone. His 
booming voice is something that I am 
certainly going to find a great loss, as 
well as his love and passion for not 
only his family and his great State but 
also for this institution. 
I don’t know if we will ever find an 
institutionalist such as Don, but we 
can certainly follow in his footsteps 
and his desire for order when he cited 
the words ‘‘regular order.’’ 
We were blessed by having him here, 
and may he rest in peace. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in supporting this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass H.R. 1621, the ‘‘Prohibiting Punish-
ment of Acquitted Conduct Act of 2021, as 
amended. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 1621. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
OPENING STATEMENT 
Mr. Speaker. I am proud to support of H.R. 
1621, the ‘‘Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted 
Conduct Act,’’ which offers a solution to a 
long-identified problem within our criminal jus-
tice system. 
This bill provides necessary reform to cur-
rent federal sentencing practice that allows 
judges to sentence defendants based on con-
duct for which a jury found them not guilty. 
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution 
provides that anyone accused of a crime shall 
enjoy the right to a speedy and public jury 
trial, while the Fifth Amendment provides that 
no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law. 
Together these provisions mean that the 
Government is bound to prove each and every 
element of an offense for which a defendant is 
charged beyond a reasonable doubt during a 
jury trial, or that a defendant must admit each 
element of an offense to support a plea of 
guilty. 
Notwithstanding this constitutional obliga-
tion, federal judges routinely nullify not guilty 
verdicts rendered by juries and sentence de-
fendants to significantly higher penalties based 
on acquitted conduct. 
In its current form, 18 USC § 3661 prohibits 
any limitation of the conduct a judge may con-
sider when sentencing a defendant, even 
when a jury has determined that there was in-
sufficient evidence to prove the defendant 
committed the charged offense. 
Additionally, under the concept of ‘‘relevant 
conduct,’’ the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines 
allow judges to consider a range of conduct, 
including dismissed charges, uncharged con-
duct, and acquitted conduct when imposing 
sentences. 
The fact-finding made by judges at sen-
tencing is based on a lower evidentiary stand-
ard than at trial—that is by a preponderance 
of the law—which many scholars define as a 
50% chance that a claim is true. 
The reform proposed in this bill ensures that 
judges punish defendants based on facts 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt—the high-
er evidentiary standard of proof required dur-
ing jury trials, which some scholars attach a 
value of 90 to 95% surety. 
Justice Ginsburg moderate-liberal who be-
came more liberal in later years, joined Justice 
Thomas and Justice Scalia, a staunch con-
servative, in his dissent in Jones v. United 
States, lamenting the failure of the Court to 
determine if the Sixth Amendment is violated 
when judges impose sentences based solely 
on judge-found facts. 
While the Sentencing Guidelines suggested 
prison sentences from 27 to 71 months for the 
three defendants in the case, the trial judge 
imposed sentences of 180, 194, and 225 
months, based on conduct the prosecution 
failed to prove. 
Justice Scalia’s often-quoted dissent was 
issued more than seven years ago. 
Yet nothing has been done about this un-
just, undemocratic practice, which diminishes 
the sanctity of the jury trial, the public check 
on the government’s power, and the overall in-
tegrity of the criminal justice system. 
H.R. 1621 would restore fairness to jury 
trials by amending Section 3661 to ban con-
sideration of acquitted conduct at sentencing 
unless the conduct is considered for mitigation 
purposes. 
Though I wish we were doing more to ad-
vance substantive criminal justice reform, I 
support this bipartisan bill that addresses an 
acute need while restoring the basic propo-
sitions of due process and the right to trial by 
jury. 
I thank our colleague, Representative STEVE 
COHEN, for his commitment to justice and for 
taking the lead on this significant, bipartisan 
bill alongside Representative KELLY
ARM-
STRONG. 
A broad coalition of advocates support this 
measure, including R Street Institute, the 
ACLU, The Innocence Project, Brennan Cen-
ter for Justice, the American Bar Association, 
Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, and Federal Public & Community De-
fenders. 
It is my hope that the Senate will take up 
and pass the House version of this bill soon. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill and 
to continue working together on additional 
measures to make our justice system more 
equitable and more transparent. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Prohibiting Punishment of Ac-
quitted Conduct Act—commonsense bipartisan 
and bicameral legislation to restore a key as-
pect of fairness to our criminal justice system. 
Under the U.S. criminal justice system, you 
are innocent until proven guilty. A principle 
that is foundational to our system of law and 
order. 
Coupled with this principle, is that if you are 
charged with a crime, you are entitled to a trial 
by a jury of your peers. If they find you inno-
cent, your case is finished. 
This all makes sense—and aligns with our 
understanding of our justice system. But, in 
too many cases, tour courts are punishing 
people for crimes they’ve been found innocent 
of. 
Currently, even if one jury finds you inno-
cent and acquits you of a crime, a different 
judge can still use that allegation as a basis of 
providing a harsher punishment for a crime 
you are convicted of. 
This means that the second judge can ef-
fectively unilaterally overturn a prior acquittal 
when considering a future sentence—dis-
missing the presumption of innocent until prov-
en guilty. 
This is absurd. 
I was a litigator and defense attorney for 
many years, and I understand exactly how un-
just it is for someone found innocent to have 
this ticking timebomb looming overhead. 
This bill will end the practice of judges in-
creasing sentences based on conduct for 
which a defendant has been acquitted by a 
jury—restoring a foundation pillar of fairness in 
our criminal justice system. 
I want to thank Congressman COHEN and 
Congressman ARMSTRONG for their leadership 
on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1621, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

COVID–19 AMERICAN HISTORY 
PROJECT ACT 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4738) to direct the American 
Folklife Center at the Library of Con-
gress to establish a history project to 
collect video and audio recordings of 
personal histories and testimonials, 
written materials, and photographs of 
those who were affected by COVID–19, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4738 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 
American History Project Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
(1) COVID–19 is a highly infectious res-
piratory illness caused by a virus called 
SARS–CoV–2. This disease has caused a 
worldwide pandemic affecting millions of 
people and has fundamentally altered the op-
erations of the world’s cities, businesses, and 
schools. 
(2) The outbreak of COVID–19 was first de-
tected in Wuhan, China, and on January 21, 
2020, the first confirmed case of COVID–19 
was diagnosed in the United States. 
(3) The World Health Organization (WHO) 
declared COVID–19 a global pandemic on 
March 11, 2020, and the President of the 
United States issued a national emergency 
declaration concerning the pandemic on 
March 13, 2020.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3884 
March 28, 2022 
(4) To date, 194 million individuals have 
tested positive for COVID–19. Of those, 35 
million are Americans; that is, more than 
one of every 10 Americans. Almost 4.2 mil-
lion people have died from COVID–19 glob-
ally, and over 610,000 deaths have occurred in 
the United States. 
(5) The first American received the COVID– 
19 vaccine on December 14, 2020. Since then, 
163 million Americans have been vaccinated 
and 188.5 million have received at least one 
dose. The vaccine became available to every 
American adult 18 and older on April 19, 2021. 
(6) While there are still remaining cases, 
and healthcare professionals and researchers 
are tirelessly working to eradicate the dis-
ease, it is important we begin work to fully 
capture the firsthand personal stories of 
those impacted by COVID–19, a major na-
tional event in the history of this country. 
(7) Oral histories are of immeasurable 
value to historians, researchers, authors, 
journalists, film makers, scholars, students, 
and citizens of all walks of life. Survivors of 
the pandemic, survivors of loved ones who 
lost their lives to COVID–19, and frontline 
healthcare workers should be remembered 
and can provide valuable firsthand knowl-
edge on how this pandemic impacted their 
everyday lives. 
(8) It is in the Nation’s best interest to col-
lect and catalog oral histories of Americans 
who were affected by the pandemic so that 
future generations will have original sources 
of information regarding the lives and times 
of those who lived through or died from the 
COVID–19 pandemic and conditions under 
which they endured. These accounts will 
allow an opportunity for Americans to re-
member those who lost their lives and may 
learn firsthand of the heroics, loneliness, 
horrors, and triumphs of the healthcare 
workers who combated this pandemic. 
(9) The Library of Congress, as the Nation’s 
oldest Federal cultural institution and larg-
est and most inclusive library in human his-
tory, is an appropriate repository to collect, 
preserve, and make available to the public 
an archive of these oral histories. The Li-
brary’s American Folklife Center has exper-
tise in the management of documentation 
projects and experience in the development 
of cultural and educational projects for the 
public. 
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act 
to create a new federally sponsored, author-
ized, and funded project that will coordinate 
at a national level the collection of video 
and audio recordings of personal histories 
and testimonials, written materials, and 
photographs of Americans who contracted 
COVID–19, individuals who lost family mem-
bers and friends to COVID–19, and healthcare 
workers who fought to treat the illness. 
These stories will inform, assist, and encour-
age local efforts to preserve the stories of 
this pandemic and the ones who lost their 
battle to the pandemic.

titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) and the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4738 establishes a 
COVID–19 history program within the 
Library of Congress’ American Folklife 
Center. 
March 11 of this year marked the sec-
ond anniversary of the World Health 
Organization’s official designation of 
COVID–19 as a pandemic. Since then, 
more than 6 million people worldwide 
have succumbed to the disease, almost 
a million in the United States alone, 
and hundreds of millions more have 
suffered from its debilitating effects. 
Experts agree that current statistics 
are likely undercounting the disease’s 
actual toll. Indeed, the true scale of so-
cial and economic devastation caused 
by the virus may never be known. 
Although the virus continues to dis-
rupt daily life in ways both seen and 
unseen, through American ingenuity 
and sheer force of will, several effective 
vaccines were developed in record time. 
These vaccines continue to be an im-
portant tool as the fight to eradicate 
the coronavirus goes on. 
As the country and world enter this 
next phase of the pandemic, it is im-
portant that we preserve the stories of 
those who lived through it. COVID–19 is 
not the first pandemic, and it will not 
be the last. Humanity has endured 
Black Death, cholera, influenza, HIV, 
AIDS, and the list goes on. As dev-
astating as these diseases can be, there 
are lessons to be found in each: lessons 
of love and loss, of peace and strife, of 
failure and triumph. 
Tragically, few know this firsthand 
better than my colleague, the gentle-
woman from Louisiana and sponsor of 
this bill, who lost her husband, Luke, 
to the disease. 
We applaud her for bravely answering 
the call of public service at such a dif-
ficult time, and we hope she and her 
family continue to heal and his mem-
ory serves as an inspiration to them in 
all that they do. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3885 
March 28, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4738, the COVID–19 American 
History Project Act. I thank my col-
league, Congresswoman JULIA LETLOW 
of Louisiana, for championing this im-
portant legislation. 
When 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
reached our shores, our lives were all 
impacted. Some of these changes were 
temporary, and some of them were per-
manent. 
Congresswoman LETLOW continues to 
live every day with the impact this 
pandemic has had on her family, and I 
am inspired by her courage and willing-
ness to share her story. Unfortunately, 
her story is not entirely unique, and 
many families across this Nation have 
been forced to say good-bye to a loved 
one far too soon. 
Their lives and memories deserve to 
be recorded, collected, and preserved so 
that this unprecedented pandemic is 
accurately understood by historians, 
students, 
and 
Americans 
from 
all 
walks of life. 
Over the last 2 years, we have all felt 
fear of the unknown. In a lot of ways, 
when the pandemic hit, our Nation was 
caught off guard. This project will help 
ensure future generations can learn 
from the trials we have overcome and 
the triumphs we have been able to 
achieve. 
The American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress is the largest and 
most extensive library in human his-
tory, and I can think of no better place 
to house the personal histories, testi-
monies, written materials, and photo-
graphs of Americans whose lives were 
lost, those who bravely stood on the 
front lines, and also all those who dem-
onstrated the American spirit through 
innovation, resilience, and compassion. 
As Congresswoman LETLOW has ex-
pressed, this project is about providing 
healing and hope for the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1745 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to my col-
league from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, over the last 2 years, every-
body has a COVID memory. It might be 
the masks that were mandated on folks 
across the United States. It might be 
that cup of coffee that you tried to 
drink, forgetting that your mask was 
on. It might be how we have seen in-
credible evolution— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, against my better judgment, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Illinois for his evolution in thought 
there and for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, we 
have seen just an absolutely incredible 
experience going through COVID. It 
might be the mask mandates that were 
thrust upon people, and as I mentioned, 
it might even be a funny memory of 
people trying to eat or drink coffee 
through their mask, as I know I have. 
We have seen this evolution in the 
workforce where people are working re-
motely all over the United States, and 
we have seen millions and millions of 
people choose to leave the workforce. 
This is something that has affected 
so many people. We have seen multi- 
generational businesses close, and we 
have seen fledgling businesses surge as 
a result of COVID–19, as a result of this 
pandemic. 
We have seen the record speed at 
which vaccines, plural, have been de-
veloped under Operation Warp Speed. 
We have seen treatment protocols that 
have evolved. And, by some measure, 
we have seen up to a million Americans 
that have lost their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, there is so much his-
tory behind COVID–19, behind this pan-
demic. There have been things that 
have been just absolutely remarkable, 
like the innovation in our pharma-
ceuticals, in developing vaccines, inno-
vation in technology with the evo-
lution of incredibly convenient tech-
nology like Zoom or Webex or GoTo 
Meeting or other technologies allowing 
people to videoconference, sometimes 
wearing shorts or pajama pants with 
their suit up top. This has been abso-
lutely amazing, watching what has 
happened. 
But perhaps, Mr. Speaker, the most 
powerful impact of COVID–19 is not 
necessarily the successes and failures, 
the misfires, the things that have 
worked well, but it has been our per-
sonal losses. 
Mr. Speaker, the sponsor of this bill, 
Congresswoman JULIA
LETLOW
from 
my home State of Louisiana, lost just 
an incredible man, a man who had a 
servant’s heart, a man who cared so 
much for those that couldn’t nec-
essarily fight for themselves. 
Congressman-elect LUKE LETLOW was 
elected to represent the small commu-
nities around Louisiana and around 
this Nation, I will say it again, to fight 
for those that were, in many cases, in-
capable of having a voice by them-
selves that was needed to change pol-
icy. But, collectively, Congressman- 
elect LETLOW was going to change that. 
I want to thank Congresswoman 
LETLOW, Luke’s wife, and the Rep-
resentative from that area, for having 
the leadership, for bringing this bill up, 
for making sure that we don’t ever for-
get about all of the powerful lessons 
learned from COVID–19, that we don’t 
forget about all of these powerful peo-
ple, the heroes that lost their lives car-
ing for others, in some cases; those 
people that were on the front lines try-
ing to allow this country to continue, 
our economy to continue, our society 
to continue. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
LETLOW for her leadership on this legis-
lation, and I want to thank her for rec-
ognizing all the lives that were lost in 
the history here. I urge adoption of the 
bill. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
GARBARINO), my good friend. 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4738, the 
COVID–19 American History Project 
Act. 
I am proud to co-sponsor this bill and 
stand with my friend, Congresswoman 
LETLOW, who knows better than most 
the devastation of this pandemic. 
Two years ago this month, an un-
known virus swept across the world, 
taking lives and changing others for-
ever. Our way of life was brought to an 
abrupt halt, and even now, we are still 
trying to claw our way back to normal. 
Our State was hit hard and early. 
Nearly 70,000 New Yorkers lost their 
lives to COVID–19. Too many families 
are now missing fathers, mothers, 
brothers, and sisters. Too many friends 
are lost. 
Hardly anyone has made it through 
the last 2 years unscathed. It is un-
likely that those of us living through 
this pandemic will ever forget these 
years of strife. 
What about those after us? Only by 
preserving and remembering times of 
difficulty can we ensure that future 
generations are prepared for what may 
come their way. 
Mr. Speaker, the memories of our 
friends and loved ones lost to COVID 
deserve to live on. The memory of 
Luke Letlow and that of hundreds of 
thousands of Americans like him de-
serve to live on. 
This bill would ensure that they do 
and that their loss will serve as a re-
minder for future generations. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. LETLOW), the sponsor of 
this piece of legislation and my good 
friend. 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as the House considers H.R. 4738, 
the 
COVID–19 
American 
History 
Project Act. 
The last 2 years have been unimagi-
nable for every single American. As 
COVID–19 ravaged our Nation, we lost 
nearly 1 million citizens to this dev-
astating virus. 
For countless families, those deaths 
were not just a number on the news but 
the visceral loss of a loved one: a 
grandparent, a husband, a wife, a mom, 
a dad, a sister, a brother, a daughter, 
or a son. 
My own family faced the pain of this 
pandemic as we lost my husband, Luke, 
just days before he would take a seat in 
this very Chamber. 
Studies tell us that when a person 
dies, approximately nine people from

their inner circle, their family, friends, 
coworkers, and neighbors suffer pro-
found grief. 
This bill is dedicated to them, the 
now nearly 9 million Americans who 
live every day with newfound empti-
ness and suffering. 
For families like mine, that loss 
means an empty chair at the dinner 
table, a son who won’t be able to go 
fishing with his dad anymore, and a 
daughter who won’t be able to dance 
with her father on her wedding day. 
But this bill also values our people’s 
personal experiences during the pan-
demic which will help inform the col-
lective narrative. Their accounts will 
facilitate healing and give hope to the 
generations of Americans to follow. 
The 
COVID–19 
American 
History 
Project Act will task the Library of 
Congress to record, collect, and keep 
the stories of Americans impacted by 
the pandemic, personal accounts from 
those who survived this virus, from 
those who lost loved ones, and from our 
healthcare heroes, the doctors, nurses, 
technicians, ambulance drivers, and 
custodians who served on the front 
lines of this pandemic, and to whom we 
owe an enormous amount of gratitude. 
This bill will allow us to use our 
voices as citizens to write the history 
of this time. Personal stories are pow-
erful and can promote healing while 
also helping others who are hurting. 
Medical research tells us that shar-
ing a story through verbal or written 
means has a cathartic effect on a griev-
ing individual. I know from my own 
life experiences that when we tell our 
stories of tragedy and loss, that is 
when true healing begins. 
It is time for the American people to 
heal. It is time for us to finally put the 
fear and divisiveness of this pandemic 
behind us. It is time to let the values of 
hope and peace guide our Nation once 
again. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe it is fitting for 
this bill to come up for a vote on the 
first day this House begins to reopen. 
As we welcome the American people 
back inside their House, let us also 
welcome the countless stories of those 
we lost throughout these last 2 years. 
Every day when I look into my tod-
dlers’ faces, I see their dad’s amazing 
spirit, and I find comfort in knowing 
that his greatest legacy will live on 
through them. 
But it is my children’s generation 
and those not yet born who will need to 
know the personal history and indel-
ible impact of this pandemic, and it 
should be written by the very people 
who lived it and were impacted di-
rectly. 
My husband, Luke, loved history and 
had a tremendous passion for pre-
serving our shared American heritage. 
His knowledge of the past profoundly 
shaped his public service. 
I think of the hours he spent poring 
over historical documents, writing and 
publishing the stories of the people 
who came before us. 
Let us preserve today’s stories, not 
just to write a record, but to inform 
the decisions of those who will stand in 
this Chamber decades from now and 
chart the course for our Republic. 
It is the dawn of a new day in Amer-
ica, one where we can finally begin to 
move forward from COVID–19. And 
while we vow never to forget the great 
suffering and loss so many of us en-
dured, we stand emboldened by the col-
lective healing of the American spirit. 
The Library of Congress’ mission is 
to engage, inspire, and inform Congress 
and the American people with a uni-
versal and enduring source of knowl-
edge and creativity. 
Let us amplify the voices of the 
American people. Let us use their sto-
ries and experiences to write this his-
tory, and never let us forget those we 
lost. 
In closing, I am reminded of a quote 
from Rick Warren who said, ‘‘Other 
people are going to find healing in your 
wounds. Your greatest life messages 
and your most effective ministry will 
come out of your deepest hurts.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for to us let 
our country heal. It is time for us to 
share our stories. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I have been in this institution 
now and had the privilege to serve here 
for over 91⁄2 years. And that was, by far, 
one of the most inspiring personal sto-
ries that I have had a chance to wit-
ness. 
I can tell you, based upon what I 
learned about Luke Letlow from my 
colleagues like GARRET
GRAVES
and 
STEVE SCALISE and CLAY HIGGINS and 
others, was that Luke Letlow was so 
excited to be a part of what we some-
times take for granted here in the 
House. 
I was a former staff member just like 
Mr. Letlow was, but his runoff election 
was right at the time between orienta-
tion, where I would have had a chance 
to meet him, and a chance for him to 
be sworn in. And that is when the trag-
edy 
that 
Congresswoman 
LETLOW 
talked about her family facing took 
place. 
Luke Letlow didn’t get a chance to 
raise his right hand and be a part of 
this House, but his legacy will live on 
forever as part of this oral history 
project. 
I cannot think of a better way for a 
mother to be able to give her children, 
in honor of their dad and her husband, 
the legacy that he deserves than by 
passing this bill tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone in this 
institution to vote ‘‘yes’’ to preserve 
the legacy of not only Luke Letlow but 
of those whose families have been im-
pacted the exact same way as the 
Letlow family by this pandemic. 
Let’s move beyond this pandemic but 
let us never forget. Let us remember 
our heroes, and let us remember those 
families, and let us remember how 
great our country is to be able to move 
beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Congresswoman for bringing for-
ward this very poignant and important 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues as 
well to support this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 4738, the 
‘‘COVID–19 American History Project Act.’’ 
This bill directs the American Folklife Center 
at the Library of Congress to establish the 
COVID–19 American History Project which will 
collect and make publicly available individual 
stories and records of experiences during the 
COVID–19 pandemic in the United States. 
The bill includes a requirement to collect 
video and audio histories and testimonials of 
those who were affected by the pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States will soon 
reach a grave milestone. As of 9 o’clock this 
morning, there have been 974,277 American 
deaths from COVID–19. In the coming weeks, 
we will reach 1,000,000 deaths. 
However, I believe that only focusing on that 
horrific number, though nonetheless important, 
makes us forget about who we lost. 
Therefore, with this time I would like to tell 
the stories of my fellow Houstonians who 
sadly passed because of this unprecedented 
public health crisis. 
The stories I will be recounting are all cour-
tesy of Houston Public Media, of whose jour-
nalists I have been a strong supporter. 
Knowing that his daughter would be unable 
to walk at her college graduation commence-
ment due to the COVID–19 pandemic, Dr. 
Carlos Araujo-Preza threw his daughter, An-
drea Araujo, a belated graduation celebration 
with her close friends and family in late Octo-
ber. She said he really put in the effort to give 
her the best ceremony he could. 
Dr. Araujo-Preza always went out of his way 
to make sure his daughter and her brother 
were taken care of, despite a busy work 
schedule at Tomball Regional Hospital. The 
siblings and their father spent their weekends 
together binge-watching movies and TV shows 
together. 
But in 2020, Andrea Araujo was forced to 
spend her 23rd birthday without her father. 
Araujo-Preza was two weeks away from re-
ceiving his first round of the COVID–19 vac-
cine before he passed away. He died Nov 30, 
2020, at the age of 51. 
He knew at a young age he was meant to 
pursue a career in the medical field. Coming 
from a family of doctors himself, Araujo-Preza 
was viewed as a loving caregiver and some-
one his patients could always rely on. 
Araujo-Preza was the leading doctor at his 
hospital who specialized in plasma research, 
while also distributing COVID–19 vaccines to 
nurses. 
‘‘His colleagues were fans of him,’’ she said. 
‘‘They loved when he came into work.’’ 
He would go out of his way to give his per-
sonal phone number to patients and would ac-
commodate their needs at any time of day. 
Araujo said her father would wake up as early 
as 3 a.m. to go into work. Araujo-Preza would 
sleep in the hospital for days and sometimes 
weeks at a time to always be on call for his 
patients. 
Now, Araujo said she tries to live by a say-
ing her father used to share in Spanish: ‘‘The 
sun always rises the next day.’’ Araujo-Preza 
would tell his children to not let daily chal-
lenges in life hold them back. Because, he 
said, as life goes on, you should too.

‘‘I feel like people always say, ‘with time, 
things get better’, but I’ve noticed it’s quite the 
opposite,’’ she said. ‘‘Every day gets harder.’’ 
That 
story 
was 
courtesy 
of 
Emily 
Jaroszewski at Houston Public Media. 
The next story is one that is especially close 
to my heart: Dick Cigler from the University of 
Houston. 
Those who were mentored by Dick Cigler 
would tell you he left a lasting impression as 
one of the most influential staff members at 
the Daily Cougar—a highly regarded cham-
pion of free speech at the University of Hous-
ton’s newspaper. 
‘‘He taught us about the importance of jour-
nalism,’’ said Tanya Eiserer, an Emmy-award 
winning reporter for WFAA in Dallas and 
former Daily Cougar student editor. ‘‘He really 
taught us the importance of doing the right 
thing, doing it for the right reasons; and stand-
ing up for the underdog.’’ 
Nowhere was that more evident than when, 
in the 1990s, a group of UH journalists wrote 
a series of articles challenging the decreased 
university budget for UH downtown students 
and the increased budget for subsidiary cam-
puses. 
Dick allowed the students to voice their con-
cerns brazenly. 
‘‘He didn’t try to, you know, tell us to back 
down,’’ Eiserer said. ‘‘He ran interference, and 
they knew that we were an independent news 
operation.’’ 
Eiserer remembers Cigler as being a listen-
ing ear and a guiding mentor when she trans-
ferred from Baylor University to UH. She re-
garded him as one of the people who helped 
her become the reporter she is today. 
‘‘I learned how to be a journalist at the Daily 
Cougar,’’ said Eiserer. ‘‘I would not give that 
time back for all the money in the world.’’ 
Cigler worked as Director of UH’s Student 
Publications department, now known as the 
Center for Student Media, for 23 years until 
his retirement in 2010. 
His impact on the Daily Cougar can be felt 
to this day. 
Cigler died on Jan. 24, 2021, at the age of 
79. He leaves behind his two daughters Kerri 
Runge and Michelle Cigler.

Houston Public Media. 
The last individual I want to mention is 
someone who is a local hero but should be a 
national one. That person was John Bland. 
More than 60 years ago, a group of Texas 
Southern University students took seats at the 
lunch counter at Weingarten’s Supermarket at 
4110 Almeda Road, knowing they wouldn’t be 
served. 
It was Houston’s first sit-in, and that spring, 
Black college students in cities across the 
country forced the beginning of an end to ra-
cial segregation—at lunch counters, depart-
ment stores, and city halls. 
One of the TSU students at the sit-in was 
John Bland, a 20-year-old who spent the rest 
of his life working to advance civil rights and 
equal opportunity. 
Bland worked as a bus operator at 
HouTran, now called Metro, and he spent 
more than 50 years organizing with the Trans-
port Workers Union. He served as a vice 
president of the Texas State AFL–CIO, a 
president of the Houston chapter of the Coali-
tion of Black Trade Unionists, a precinct judge, 
and a member of the Houston Police Depart-
ment Citizen Review Committee. 
‘‘When workers would doubt their ability to 
beat the odds and make change, Mr. Bland 
would say, ‘When we fought for integration in 
the 1960s, they arrested me 27 times, jailed 
me, and fined me, but that didn’t stop us,’ ’’ 
Hany Khalil, Executive Director of the Texas 
Gulf Coast Area Labor Federation, said. 
Bland died on July 9, 2020, at the age of 
80. He leaves behind his wife, Betty Davis 
Bland, and their two daughters and grandson. 
That story was courtesy of Jen Rice at 
Houston Public Media. 
I wish I could mention every Houstonian and 
honor their lives because they all deserve it. 
They were mothers, wives, fathers, husbands, 
sons, daughters, and so much more. They will 
all be missed and are not just another num-
ber. 
It is for that reason, Mr. Speaker, that I 
strongly support H.R. 4738 and urge my col-
leagues to support it as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4738, as 
amended . 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(S. 3294) to obtain and direct the place-
ment in the Capitol or on the Capitol 
Grounds of a statue to honor Associate 
Justice of the Supreme Court of the 
United States Sandra Day O’Connor 
and a statue to honor Associate Justice 
of the Supreme Court of the United 
States Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3294 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
(a) SANDRA DAY O’CONNOR.—Congress finds 
the following: 
(1) Sandra Day O’Connor was born in 1930 
in El Paso, Texas, and spent her childhood 
on her family’s isolated Arizona cattle 
ranch. She lived with her grandmother in El 
Paso during the school year, away from her 
home and parents. 
(2) O’Connor matriculated to Stanford Uni-
versity at the age of 16, and combined her 
undergraduate and law school curricula, 
graduating with a bachelor’s degree in eco-
nomics and a law degree in just 6 years. She 
was third in her law school class, behind Wil-
liam Rehnquist, her future colleague on the 
Supreme Court of the United States (in this 
section referred to as the ‘‘Supreme Court’’). 
(3) Despite her qualifications, O’Connor 
could not find work as an attorney because 
of bias against women in the law. She ended 
up negotiating for an unpaid position in the 
San Mateo County District Attorney’s office 
at a shared desk, while her husband, John, 
finished at Stanford Law School 1 year later. 
(4) O’Connor traveled to Frankfurt, Ger-
many, in 1954 with her husband John, who 
had joined the United States Army Judge 
Advocate General’s Corps, where she was 
able to find work as a civilian attorney with 
the United States Army Quartermaster 
Corps. In 1957, O’Connor returned to Arizona 
and still could not find work with a tradi-
tional law firm due to her gender, so she 
‘‘hung out a shingle’’ as a sole practitioner. 
(5) In 1965, O’Connor was hired as an Assist-
ant Attorney General for the State of Ari-
zona. 
(6) Active in Republican Party politics and 
well-received for her work at the Arizona 
State Capitol, O’Connor was appointed to an 
Arizona State Senate seat in 1969 when the 
incumbent, also a woman, was appointed to 
a Federal position and vacated the office. 
(7) In 1970, O’Connor was elected to the Ari-
zona State Senate and served 2 consecutive 
terms. In 1972, she was selected as Majority 
Leader of the Arizona State Senate, the first 
time a woman held such a position in any 
State. 
(8) In 1974, O’Connor ran for office as a trial 
court judge. She won and was later ap-
pointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 
1979. 
(9) On August 19, 1981, President Ronald 
Reagan nominated O’Connor to be an Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court, to fill 
the seat vacated by Associate Justice Potter 
Stewart. On September 21, 1981, the Senate 
confirmed O’Connor’s nomination by a unan-
imous vote, making her the first woman to 
serve on the Supreme Court. 
(10) O’Connor established herself as a prag-
matic, independent voice on the Supreme 
Court, casting decisive votes during a time 
when the Court was being asked to resolve 
politically charged issues. 
(11) In the 1982 case of Mississippi Univer-
sity for Women v. Hogan, O’Connor wrote the 
majority opinion holding that the State 
could not prevent men from enrolling in an 
all-women’s nursing school, writing that 
laws discriminating on the basis of sex would 
be allowed only if there was an ‘‘exceedingly 
persuasive justification’’ for them. 
(12) O’Connor sought, when possible, to 
find the middle ground between her often-di-
vided colleagues, frequently joining the ma-
jority decision but presenting her views in 
concurring opinions that eschewed broad 
constitutional doctrine in favor of resolving 
the cases before the Court. 
(13) O’Connor put a very public face on the 
role of the Supreme Court, domestically and 
around the world. She became the Court’s 
most prolific public speaker, traveling to all 
50 States and to countless law schools, li-
braries, and public events to describe how 
the Court works and its role in our constitu-
tional form of government. She traveled 
worldwide as an ambassador for the Rule of 
Law and the independence of judiciaries ev-
erywhere. 
(14) After 24 years on the Supreme Court, 
O’Connor announced her retirement to care 
for her ailing husband, who had Alzheimer’s 
disease. President George W. Bush nomi-
nated John Roberts, Jr., for the vacancy, but 
before Roberts was confirmed, Chief Justice 
Rehnquist passed away, creating a second 
vacancy. President Bush personally appealed

to O’Connor to remain on the Court so he 
could nominate Roberts for the Chief Justice 
vacancy and have more time to make a sec-
ond nomination to the Court. In yet another 
act of public service, O’Connor agreed to 
serve until Samuel Alito was confirmed to 
fill her seat on January 31, 2006. 
(15) O’Connor began her retirement with 2 
goals. One was to convince more States to 
adopt merit selection of judges for filling va-
cancies in State courts. The second was to 
educate the public on the importance of an 
independent judiciary. Her judicial independ-
ence work led to her awareness of a national 
civics education deficit. 
(16) In 2009, O’Connor created iCivics.org to 
educate young Americans about civics and 
what it means to be a citizen. That endeavor 
grew to become the largest civics education 
platform in the country, with over 7,000,000 
students annually enrolling in the programs. 
Its popularity was due to a captivating on-
line, interactive gaming approach. The pro-
gram was free to all and had no advertising. 
iCivics played a crucial role in Educating for 
American Democracy, a federally funded ini-
tiative to improve civics and history edu-
cation, which released its reports in March 
2021. 
(b) RUTH BADER GINSBURG.—Congress finds 
the following: 
(1) Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born in 1933 in 
Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in a low- 
income, working-class neighborhood. 
(2) Ginsburg graduated from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1954, finishing first in her class. 
Following her graduation, Ginsburg enrolled 
at Harvard Law School in 1956, entering into 
a class of 552 men and only 8 other women. 
(3) As a law student, Ginsburg became the 
first female member of the Harvard Law Re-
view, a prestigious legal journal. She also 
cared for her husband, Martin Ginsburg, who 
had been diagnosed with cancer, and their 
young daughter. Ginsburg finished her legal 
education at Columbia Law School, where 
she graduated first in her class in 1959. 
(4) Ginsburg taught at Rutgers University 
Law School from 1963 to 1972 and at Colum-
bia Law School from 1972 to 1980, where she 
became the school’s first female tenured pro-
fessor. 
(5) During the 1970s, Ginsburg served as the 
director of the Women’s Rights Project of 
the American Civil Liberties Union. In this 
position, she led the fight against gender dis-
crimination and successfully argued 6 land-
mark cases before the Supreme Court. 
(6) Ginsburg won 5 cases on gender dis-
crimination before the Supreme Court, in-
cluding the case Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 
which involved a portion of the Social Secu-
rity Act that favored women over men, be-
cause the Act granted certain benefits to 
widows, but not widowers. 
(7) In 1980, President Jimmy Carter nomi-
nated Ginsburg to a seat on the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. 
(8) On June 22, 1993, President Bill Clinton 
nominated Ginsburg to be an Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court, to fill the seat va-
cated by Associate Justice Byron White. On 
August 3, 1993, the Senate confirmed Gins-
burg’s nomination to the Supreme Court by 
a 96 to 3 vote. 
(9) Ginsburg became the second female jus-
tice to serve on the Supreme Court, as well 
as the first Jewish female justice to serve on 
the Supreme Court. 
(10) As a justice, Ginsburg presented a 
strong voice in favor of gender equality, vot-
ing rights, the rights of workers, and the sep-
aration of church and state. 
(11) In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the Supreme 
Court’s landmark decision in United States 
v. Virginia, which held that the State-sup-
ported Virginia Military Institute could not 
refuse to admit women. 
(12) 
Ginsburg 
famously 
dissented 
in 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 
where the plaintiff, a female worker being 
paid significantly less than males with her 
same qualifications, sued under title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et 
seq.), but was denied relief under a statute of 
limitation issue. Ginsburg broke with tradi-
tion and wrote a high colloquial version of 
her dissent to read from the bench. In her 
dissent, she also called for Congress to undo 
this interpretation of the law. 
(13) 
Ginsburg’s 
impactful 
dissent 
in 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. led 
to the successful passage of the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (Public Law 
111–2; 123 Stat. 5), which was the first piece of 
legislation 
signed 
by 
President 
Barack 
Obama. 
(14) Until the 2018 term, Ginsburg had not 
missed a day of oral arguments, not even 
when she was undergoing chemotherapy for 
pancreatic cancer, after surgery for colon 
cancer, or the day after her husband passed 
away in 2010. 
(15) Ginsburg passed away on September 18, 
2020. 
SEC. 2. STATUES HONORING JUSTICE SANDRA 
DAY O’CONNOR AND JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) and the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the mat-
ter under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This bill, by creating statues in the 
Capitol, honors former Supreme Court 
Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, two women who 
made groundbreaking contributions to 
American history and jurisprudence. 
The United States Capitol is a global 
symbol 
of 
democracy. 
This 
iconic 
building, where we debate and craft 
law, is also a museum of American art 
and history, with a rich collection of 
portraits, paintings, and statues. 
Among the hundreds of sculptures, 
just 14 honor women leaders. By adding 
statues of these two pioneering Su-
preme Court Justices, we will honor 
their legacy and inspire all who pass 
through these Halls. 
In 1869, Arabella Mansfield became 
the first woman admitted to practice 
law in the United States when she was 
admitted to the Iowa bar. 
Ten years later, Belva Lockwood be-
came the first woman admitted to 
practice before the Supreme Court of 
the United States. One hundred years 
would pass before Sandra Day O’Con-
nor became the first woman to serve on 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States. 
Born in the early 1930s, Sandra Day 
O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
both achieved extraordinary academic 
success. One of only five women in her 
class at Stanford Law, O’Connor served 
on the Board of Editors of the Stanford 
Law Review and graduated near the 
top of her class. 
Ginsburg first attended Harvard Law 
School, one of nine women in her class. 
She became the first female member of 
the Harvard Law Review, while also 
caring for her husband, who had been 
diagnosed with cancer, and their young 
daughter. When her husband took a job 
in New York City, Ginsburg transferred 
to Columbia Law School and graduated 
first in her class. 
Despite their outstanding academic 
qualifications, O’Connor and Ginsburg 
faced barriers to employment after 
graduation, as law firms were unwill-
ing to hire women lawyers. Each per-
severed and rose to prominence. 
O’Connor obtained a position as a 
deputy county attorney in California. 
Then, when her husband was stationed 
in Germany, she served as a civilian at-
torney with the United States Army 
Quartermaster Corps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3889 
March 28, 2022 
In 1957, the O’Connors settled in Ari-
zona, where they raised their three 
sons. O’Connor started a law practice, 
became involved in local politics and 
community service, and served as an 
assistant state attorney general. 
In 1969, O’Connor was appointed to 
the Arizona State Senate, where she 
was twice reelected and became the 
first woman majority leader in any 
State. In 1974, she was elected as a trial 
judge, a position she held until 1979, 
when she was appointed to the Arizona 
Court of Appeals. 
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ful-
filled his campaign promise to appoint 
a woman to the Supreme Court by 
nominating 
O’Connor. 
The 
Senate 
unanimously confirmed her appoint-
ment. In her nearly 25 years on the 
Court, Justice O’Connor established 
herself as a pragmatic, independent 
voice. 
In a 1982 case, O’Connor wrote the 
majority opinion, holding that the 
State could not prevent men from en-
rolling 
in 
an 
all-women’s 
nursing 
school. She wrote that laws discrimi-
nating on the basis of sex are allowed 
only if there is an ‘‘exceedingly persua-
sive justification’’ free of archaic and 
stereotypic notions of the roles and 
abilities of males and females. 
Justice O’Connor retired from the 
Supreme Court in 2006. In retirement, 
she remained active as a tireless advo-
cate for judicial independence and 
civics education. 
Following 
law 
school, 
Ginsburg 
served as a law clerk to Judge Edmund 
L. Palmieri of the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Southern District of 
New York. She then became associate 
director of a comparative law project 
sponsored by Columbia University be-
fore joining the faculty of Rutgers Law 
School in 1963. From 1972 to 1980, she 
taught at Columbia Law School, where 
she became the first female tenured 
professor. 
In the 1970s, Ginsburg also served as 
a fellow at the Center for Advanced 
Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 
Stanford, California, and as the direc-
tor of the Women’s Rights Project of 
the American Civil Liberties Union. In 
this position, she led the fight against 
gender discrimination and won five 
landmark cases before the Supreme 
Court. 
In 1980, President Carter appointed 
Ginsburg to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit. In 1993, President Clinton nom-
inated Ginsburg as an Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court. The Senate 
confirmed her nomination by a vote of 
96–3, and she became the second female 
and the first Jewish female to serve on 
the Court. 
Justice Ginsburg was a strong voice 
for gender equality and voting rights. 
She authored the landmark majority 
opinion in United States v. Virginia, 
which held that the State-supported 
Virginia Military Institute could not 
refuse to admit women. Justice Gins-
burg served on the Supreme Court for 
27 years, until her death in September 
2020. 
It is difficult to overstate the impor-
tance of these two Justices as role 
models and inspiration for generations 
of American girls, women, and women 
lawyers. 
Justice O’Connor was sworn in as the 
first female Supreme Court Justice the 
same month that I started law school, 
and I had the privilege of working with 
both Justices on issues of civic edu-
cation and access to justice. Both 
women were brilliant and funny. They 
were stars on the bench and in our na-
tional firmament. 
Now we are presented with another 
moment of equal significance, with the 
nomination of Judge Jackson under 
consideration in the Senate. One more 
barrier has fallen, and soon young 
women of color will be able to see 
themselves in future Associate Justice 
of the Supreme Court Ketanji Brown 
Jackson, as I once saw myself in Jus-
tices O’Connor and Ginsburg. 
Today I ask my colleagues to honor 
these incredible women, Justice O’Con-
nor and Justice Ginsburg, and help in-
spire our next generation of leaders by 
voting to create these statues for the 
Capitol of the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 3294. As all Members of Congress 
and every American who has visited 
the United States Capitol when it was 
completely open know, the Halls of 
this foothold of democracy are lined 
with statues to honor and commemo-
rate the lives of great Americans from 
all corners of this country, all walks of 
life, and different political leanings. 
The National Statuary Hall collec-
tion includes two statues donated from 
each State, and in addition to the base 
collection, Congress has been able to 
accept donations or authorize the com-
mission of statues of other individuals 
who have shaped our Nation and con-
tributed to the excellence of this coun-
try. 
Such additions have included the 
statue of Abraham Lincoln, commis-
sioned by Congress in 1866, the portrait 
monument to Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony 
in 1920, and most recently, the statue 
of Rosa Parks, which was officially un-
veiled in 2013. It is among these giants 
that today we consider the addition of 
the first two women confirmed to serve 
on the Supreme Court of the United 
States. 
It took nearly 200 years after the cre-
ation of the Supreme Court for the 
first woman to sit on America’s high-
est bench. Appointed by President 
Reagan and confirmed by the Senate in 
1981, with a vote of 99–0, a record for 
the most votes in support of a Supreme 
Court Justice that stands to this day, 
Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Con-
nor blazed a trail that has forever 
changed the Court for the better. 
In the years that have followed, the 
Senate has confirmed Associate Jus-
tices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom this 
bill also honors, Sonia Sotomayor, 
Elena Kagan, and, most recently, Jus-
tice Amy Coney Barrett. I have no 
doubt that the legacy of women on the 
Court will continue. 
The art collections throughout the 
Capitol Grounds play a very important 
role. The pieces honor the ingenuity, 
courage, creativity, and patriotism of 
so many who came before us. They in-
spire us and remind us of the extreme 
weight and honor of our duties as elect-
ed representatives. Congress 
rarely 
commissions the addition of statues to 
its collections, a practice that signifies 
a rare and high honor. The addition of 
the first two female Justices to serve 
on the Supreme Court is welcomed, and 
I look forward to their presence in 
these great Halls. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I am very excited to be sup-
porting this bill today. The gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCAN-
LON) did a great job with the biog-
raphies of these two incredible women, 
Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, our first two women on the 
United States Supreme Court. 
I am thinking back to my childhood. 
It is not that easy to think back to my 
childhood, but I am thinking back to 
my childhood, and probably one of the 
most exciting things that I did was a 
family trip with my parents and my 
brother to the Capitol. Now when I 
think back, and coming through the 
Capitol and seeing all those statues, I 
must have wondered as a child, did 
women do anything? It is just amazing, 
of the 266 statues here in the Capitol, 
only 14 are women. To me that is 
crazy. It is just crazy. 
We are honoring these two Supreme 
Court Justices not just because they 
are women. I am not going to go 
through their biographies again, but 
think about it. They went through 
their careers at a time when there was 
no Title IX, there was no equal pay, 
there were limitations on how many 
women could actually get into law 
school, and then if you did get into law 
school—because I was in law school 
back in the day when there weren’t a 
lot of us—you were bullied. I mean, you 
were bullied in the classroom. Their 
achievement is absolutely remarkable. 
I am very proud that future genera-
tions are going to come through these 
Halls, and they are going to see rep-
resentations of these two women. Mil-
lions of children from all over the 
country and all over the world—be-
cause we are opening up, I hope soon, 
as we pass COVID—can be inspired, and 
I cannot wait. I cannot wait to bring 
my two little grandsons so they can see 
that the girls can do it, too.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3890 
March 28, 2022 
Just to add, this is a bipartisan bill. 
I am proud to be one of the sponsors 
here in the House. Women did this to-
gether, but we thank the gentlemen for 
being on board. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this legislation to 
honor our U.S. Supreme Court Justices 
Ginsburg and O’Connor with statues in 
our U.S. Capitol. I am so proud to hear 
my co-chair LOIS FRANKEL talk about 
the importance of our history being 
recognized in these hallowed Halls. 
Both Justices O’Connor and Ginsburg 
did exactly that. They showed what it 
meant to blaze trails and to break the 
glass ceilings as the first and second 
women to serve on the Supreme Court, 
the highest court. 
Their story is an American story, and 
it is one that our country should be 
proud of. It is not what you say, it is 
what you do, and today we are taking 
action. 
Through their long and legendary ca-
reers, they have paved the way for 
countless women and girls in the legal 
and judiciary system. Their life-chang-
ing words and actions will live in the 
hearts of Americans across this coun-
try. I am grateful and I am excited to 
be part of the Democratic Women’s 
Caucus that is helping to lead this ef-
fort in honoring the life and the leg-
acies of these two giants. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
didn’t point out a bit of irony that ex-
ists as we discuss honoring anyone by 
adding a statue or a bust to the Halls 
of the Capitol when for the past 745 
days this building has been closed to 
the American people. Despite what is 
being called a reopening, it continues 
to be closed to most Americans. 
b 1815 
This is about the last place in Amer-
ica to remain closed, and for no legiti-
mate reason whatsoever. The honor of 
being memorialized in the Halls of Con-
gress is far less an honor when no one 
is around to see it. 
It is past time for Speaker PELOSI to 
reopen the people’s House to the Amer-
ican people. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of S. 3294, a bill to 
honor Supreme Court Justices Sandra 
Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Gins-
burg with statues here in the United 
States Capitol. 
Both overcame formidable barriers 
and defied the odds, paving the way for 
future generations of women, but Jus-
tice Sandra Day O’Connor holds a spe-
cial place in the hearts of all Arizo-
nans. 
Born on a ranch in eastern Arizona, 
Justice O’Connor brought a tough, no- 
nonsense attitude with her throughout 
her career in public service. She blazed 
every trail she set foot on. And just 
this past Saturday, she celebrated her 
92nd birthday. 
Justice O’Connor served as Arizona’s 
assistant attorney general, the first fe-
male majority leader to serve in any 
State senate across the United States 
of America, and as a Maricopa County 
Superior Court judge. In 1981, she took 
her Arizona brand of independence and 
pragmatism with her to the United 
States Supreme Court. 
Justice O’Connor shattered the high-
est glass ceiling in the legal profession, 
but Arizonans most admire her for the 
way she made it there, with unparal-
leled talent, intelligence, and relent-
less grit. 
Her 
independent-minded 
commit-
ment to interpreting the Constitution 
and reaching workable decisions served 
our Nation and the rule of law well. 
One of the things that I most admire 
about Justice O’Connor is what she did 
after she retired from the United 
States Supreme Court. She foresaw 
deep divisions in our society and our 
politics. She knew that we needed to 
improve civil discourse if we hoped to 
keep our democracy strong. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Arizona. 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, after 25 
years on the Court, she came back to 
Arizona and got right back to work. 
She founded the Sandra Day O’Con-
nor Institute For American Democracy 
in Phoenix to promote civic education, 
inspiring future generations to not 
only participate in our democracy but 
to contribute to it with the same de-
gree of thoughtfulness, civility, and 
grace that she has throughout her 
amazing career. 
I have been lucky enough to work 
with her and the institute through the 
Camp O’Connor civics education pro-
gram for middle school students. I saw 
firsthand the difference that program 
makes in the lives of our next genera-
tion of leaders, and I saw how much 
Justice O’Connor truly cares about 
those children and about all people. 
That is her legacy to me. 
Justice O’Connor and Justice Gins-
burg were deeply committed in their 
service to the American people. They 
are more than deserving of this rec-
ognition. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
One of the things I most appreciate 
about this bill is the balance that it 
brings in recognizing the first two 
women Justices of the Supreme Court, 
and they have very different ideologies 
and views. While I may have signifi-
cant disagreements with Justice Gins-
burg and her rulings and positions on 
certain issues, that doesn’t mean her 
role in the history of this country is 
not worthy of being recognized. In the 
same way, Justice O’Connor is worthy 
of recognition despite the fact that I 
am sure many people on the other side 
of the aisle take issue with her beliefs 
and positions on certain issues. 
Cancel culture is a disease infecting 
our society today. Those who seek to 
wipe out the accomplishments and con-
tributions of historic figures simply 
due to opposing politics is wrong. I am 
certainly not going to engage in that 
kind of mentality even though I may 
not have cared for Justice Ginsburg’s 
politics. 
In fact, Justice Ginsburg herself 
spoke out against cancel culture. She 
was once asked how she could be 
friends with the late Justice Antonin 
Scalia. 
They 
held 
vastly 
different 
views. In her response, she quoted Jus-
tice Scalia by saying: ‘‘I attack ideas. 
I don’t attack people, and some very 
good people have some very bad ideas.’’ 
She is also famously quoted as say-
ing: ‘‘Fight for the things you care 
about, but do it in a way that will lead 
others to join you.’’ 
In short, Mr. Speaker, it is okay to 
fight for what you believe in. It is okay 
to disagree or even despise what some-
one else believes, but it doesn’t mean 
they don’t have a right to those beliefs. 
Unfortunately, this contrasts with 
some of the actions of my friends on 
the other side of the aisle these past 
few years. I hope this serves as an ex-
ample that we can disagree without 
being disagreeable, that we choose to 
rise above being easily offended and in-
stead respect alternative points of 
view, and that the Halls of Congress 
are a place where everyone feels their 
viewpoints and beliefs are given equal 
credence. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the 
balance of this bill. I rise in support of 
this legislation. I urge everyone to 
adopt it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I am so proud to rise in support of 
this bill to recognize the brilliant and 
groundbreaking legal careers of Sandra 
Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, but I am also so proud to recog-
nize them because of their unrelenting 
focus on our young people. 
We have heard a couple of times 
about Justice O’Connor’s interest in 
civics 
education. 
She 
founded 
her 
civics nonprofit when she found that 
more Americans knew the names of the 
judges on ‘‘American Idol’’ than they 
did the Justices of the Supreme Court. 
She was really committed to helping 
our next generation understand the im-
portance of our civics. 
I had the opportunity to meet Jus-
tice Ginsburg with my daughter when 
my daughter was about 10. My daugh-
ter was very anxious to ask a question 
of her. She asked her: ‘‘When will we

have a female President?’’ Justice 
Ginsburg turned to her and said: 
‘‘Probably not in my lifetime, but cer-
tainly in yours.’’ 
My daughter graduated from law 
school this year. We look forward to 
the fulfillment of Justice Ginsburg’s 
prophecy. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill and support these statues. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, Women’s History 
Month offers an opportunity to reflect on the 
courageous, patriotic women who have helped 
write our Nation’s story. 
Indeed, in every chapter of our history, 
women have been at the forefront: fighting for 
our rights, forging progress in every aspect of 
society, and pushing our nation to live up to 
our most cherished ideals. 
So, it is in that powerful, pioneering spirit 
that I rise today in support of legislation that 
will honor two of these historic Americans: 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
From their seats on the highest Court in the 
land, they were not only instrumental to up-
holding and defending our Constitution—but 
they paved a path in the field of law for gen-
erations of women to follow. 
With this bill, we honor their extraordinary 
service by welcoming to the United States 
Capitol statues of these two trailblazing 
women. 
Thank 
you 
to 
Congresswoman 
LOIS 
FRANKEL for your tireless, persistent leadership 
in establishing this special tribute—and for all 
that you do for America’s women and girls. 
Thanks also to Chair ZOE LOFGREN: who, at 
the helm of the Committee on House Adminis-
tration, has been a steadfast champion in 
bringing more diversity and inclusion to monu-
ments that fill the halls of the Congress. 
These statues will not only ensure that Jus-
tices O’Connor and Ginsburg take their rightful 
place here, among the many heroes of our 
history. 
But they will also ensure that all those who 
walk these hallowed halls—from Members and 
foreign leaders to young girls on school trips— 
can learn about and be inspired by the leg-
acies of these two legendary leaders. 
It is with great pride that, with this bill, we 
will soon welcome to the halls of Congress a 
statue of a living legend: Justice Sandra Day 
O’Connor. 
Justice O’Connor has earned her deeply de-
served place in history, as the first woman 
ever to sit on the Supreme Court. 
But beyond the barrier-breaking nature of 
her service, she brought to the bench a pillar 
of courage, integrity and justice: our nation’s 
highest ideals. 
On the Court, she was always an inde-
pendent and influential voice—bringing great 
wisdom, judgment and consideration to her 
opinions. 
She also inspired the world as a proud 
working mother, proving that a woman can 
both excel in her career and care for her fam-
ily. 
She raised her three young sons while serv-
ing in the Arizona State Senate—where she 
was the first woman Maiority Leader of a State 
Senate anywhere in the country. 
And all were in awe of her strength in serv-
ing as her late husband’s caregiver during his 
battle with Alzheimer’s. 
Justice O’Connor once said: ‘‘It’s good to be 
first—but you don’t want to be last.’’ Indeed, 
she always held open the door behind her: 
mentoring so many young women in law, in-
cluding our beloved Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
And our Nation is so proud that Justice 
Ginsburg will join that of Justice O’Connor 
here on Capitol Hill. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg truly embodied justice, 
brilliance and goodness—and nearly every 
family in America benefited from her quarter 
century on the Court fighting for equality, op-
portunity and justice for all. 
The ‘‘Notorious RBG’’ quickly became an 
icon on the bench: 
an outstanding and independent legal mind; 
a tenacious defender of our fundamental 
rights; and 
the author of fiery opinions still referenced 
to this day. 
And throughout her entire career, she was a 
tireless advocate for gender equality, whether: 
working at the ACLU as the founder of its 
Women’s Rights Project; 
arguing cases before the Supreme Court; 
or handing down legal opinions cementing 
the precedent that all men and women are 
created equal. 
After her devastating loss two years ago, it 
was my solemn privilege as Speaker to wel-
come her one final time back to the Capitol to 
lie in state. 
Now, it is with great respect and admiration 
for her legacy of powerful progress for women 
that the Congress passes this legislation to 
ensure her statue will be a permanent fixture 
of our Temple of Democracy. 
It is fitting that we enact this legislation amid 
the historic confirmation process of Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
She was magnificent during the Committee 
proceedings last week—demonstrating her 
brilliant legal mind, her remarkable confidence 
and poise, and her unyielding commitment to 
justice. 
And this is a moment of great pride and pa-
triotism for our nation, as she will soon make 
history as the first Black woman on the Su-
preme Court. 
Indeed, Judge Jackson is a blazing new trail 
for the next generation of public servants—in 
the same pioneering spirit as the two extraor-
dinary leaders we are honoring with this legis-
lation today. 
God blessed America with the leadership of 
Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Gins-
burg—and many of us today stand on their 
shoulders. 
With this bill, we ensure that all visit the 
Capitol feel their eternal presence and that our 
children will learn about their towering leg-
acies. 
I urge a strong, bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of S. 3294, a bill to place in the Cap-
itol or on the Capitol Grounds a statue to 
honor Associate Justice of the Supreme Court 
Sandra Day O’Connor and a statue to honor 
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was the first 
woman nominated to the United States Su-
preme Court by President Ronald Regan and 
was the 102nd appointee to the position. 
Justice O’Connor served from September 
25, 1981, until her retirement on January 31, 
2006. 
During her tenure on the court, Justice 
O’Connor was often the crucial swing vote in 
5–4 decisions that included many of the most 
controversial issues of our time. 
Justice O’Connor has had a long and distin-
guished career as a public servant, including 
three terms as an Arizona State Senator, and 
serving as a judge on the Superior Court of 
Maricopa County, and the Arizona Court of 
Appeals. 
Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was 
the second woman appointed, and the first 
Jewish woman, to preside on United States 
Supreme Court. 
Justice Ginsburg was appointed to the court 
by President Bill Clinton on August 10, 1993 
and served on the court until her death on 
September 18, 2020. 
Justice Ginsburg was an advocate for wom-
an’s rights long before she was appointed to 
the court. She co-founded the Women’s 
Rights Project at the ACLU. 
In the words of the late Justice Ginsburg, 
‘‘women’s rights are an essential part of the 
overall human rights agenda, trained on the 
equal dignity and ability to live in freedom all 
people should enjoy.’’ 
These women broke down barriers that 
once stood in the way of equality. Their deter-
mination and persistence allowed for women 
across the nation to fight for their rights and 
achieve their dreams. 
Their sacrifices paved the way for many 
firsts en the Federal bench. Justice Sonia 
Sotomayor was the first Hispanic woman to be 
appointed to the position, and just last month, 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was the first Af-
rican American woman to be nominated to the 
court. 
Although these are monumental steps for 
women and gender equality, there is still much 
work that needs to be done. 
It is our duty as Members of Congress to 
acknowledge and commemorate these inspir-
ing Supreme Court Justices. The two statues 
in our nation’s Capital will honor the lives and 
legacies of these two pioneering women. 
Moreover, by celebrating Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor 
we celebrate the impact of women nationwide 
and showcase these two leaders as remodels 
for future generations. I urge all my colleagues 
to support S. 3294. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
LEGACY 
OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
DONALD E. YOUNG 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, to-
night, Congress opens back up for the 
first time in 49 years without Congress-
man Don Young, and this Chamber is 
going to feel a big hole, especially, off 
to my left in the back side in that 
chair. No one in here has assigned seat-
ing, except our dean did. 
For the first time in 49 years, we will 
not hear Don’s booming voice yelling 
‘‘regular order.’’ 
For the first time in 49 years, we 
won’t see that big smile or friendly 
laugh. 
For the first time in 49 years, we 
won’t hear that strong voice when it 
comes to an issue about Alaska. But we 
will never forget him or the legacy he 
leaves behind. 
Don taught all of us, and especially 
me, three big lessons. 
First, he taught us how to fight for 
what you believe in, regardless of 
party. 
Second, he taught us how deep a love 
can be for your own family, and savor 
every moment together. 
Third, he reminded us of what an 
honor it is to serve our constituents. 
We will miss Don deeply. But more 
importantly, we will not forget him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House 
rise to observe a moment of silence for 
our dean, Congressman Don Young.

our world, particularly in Ukraine. 
Give wisdom to our world leaders so

Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,

(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. President Biden 
likes to say, and has said again today, 
that budgets are statements of values. 
Indeed, they can be, and the White 
House budget request that President 
Biden published today offers the clear-
est possible reminder that the Biden 
administration’s far-left values are 
fundamentally disconnected from what 
American families actually need. 
I mentioned around President Biden’s 
State of the Union that the speech 
gave the President a chance to pivot. 
He has had a chance to assess the poll 
numbers, read the tea leaves, and make 
a dramatic course correction back to-
ward where Americans would like for 
him to be. But he chose not to, and this 
budget proposal is just the mathe-
matical version of that failure to pivot. 
The White House is desperately spin-
ning to call this budget centrist, but 
there is nothing remotely moderate 
about what is in it. 
First and foremost, at a dangerous 
time, the President’s budget falls woe-
fully short on defense spending. Our 
Commander in Chief has again failed to 
budget for the resources that our 
Armed Forces actually need. The Biden 
administration proposes a nominal 4- 
percent increase for defense over the 
bipartisan bill Congress just passed for 
this year. 
That is a nominal 4-percent increase 
before any of the Democrats’ historic 
inflation is taken into account, and in-
flation right now is about twice that. 
So even if you accept the White 
House’s rosiest predictions about where 
inflation is headed, this would amount 
to flat-funding defense, with none of 
the robust growth we need to keep pace 
with Russia and China. Even in the 
best case scenario for their budget, it

would leave our Armed Forces simply 
treading water. 
And what if Democrats’ historic in-
flation does not plummet downward as 
quickly as they would like? What if the 
inflation they have caused keeps stick-
ing around? Then, President Biden’s 
budget would actually cut funding for 
our Armed Forces in real dollars. 
Look, the world is a dangerous place 
and growing more dangerous by the 
day. Putin’s escalation in Europe has 
created significant new requirements 
for the Pentagon and our defense in-
dustrial base. We have growing threats 
from Iran. China is pouring money into 
high-tech weapons systems. Beijing an-
nounced that they are increasing de-
fense spending again this year by more 
than 7 percent. 
So, amid all this, the White House 
has proposed no meaningful increase in 
resources 
for 
protecting 
innocent 
Americans, promoting our interests, 
supporting 
our 
partners, 
assisting 
Ukraine, or replenishing our stock-
piles. President Biden likes to give 
speeches about the need for American 
leadership in the world, but when the 
rubber meets the road, when it is time 
to invest so we can rise and meet chal-
lenges like Russia and China, this 
President has, again, decided to do ex-
actly the opposite. Putin and Xi will 
sleep more soundly at night if the 
Biden administration gets its way on 
defense funding than if Republicans get 
ours. 
Now, let’s look at the places where 
President Biden does want to pull out 
all the stops and hand out massive 
funding increases. Our Armed Forces 
may get the short end of the stick from 
this White House, but plenty, plenty of 
far-left domestic priorities will be lit-
erally swimming in cash. 
While they limit defense to 4 percent 
growth before inflation, nondefense 
spending would get a significantly larg-
er increase—not all of domestic spend-
ing however. Border security and the 
Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
barely tread water, just like our 
troops. But other Agencies and Depart-
ments that are more useful for the far- 
left agenda, like the IRS, the EPA, 
Commerce, HUD, and Labor make out 
like bandits with gigantic—gigantic— 
increases of 20 and 30 percent since 
2021. 
They want to pour money into ab-
surdities like the U.N. Green Climate 
Fund—borrow from China to fund a 
global bureaucracy that will hand free 
money back to China. There is plenty 
of money for things like antigun regu-
lations, free lawyers for illegal immi-
grants, and something called ‘‘environ-
mental justice.’’ 
This whole far-left feast leaves out 
the reckless taxing-and-spending spree 
that Democrats failed to pass last year 
and are now trying to revive. The 
Biden administration still wants all 
that spending, too, but they couldn’t 
even budget for it honestly. 
And all of the bloated liberal non-
sense comes paired with the biggest tax 
hike in American history—a 2.5-plus- 
trillion-dollar 
bomb 
of 
tax 
hikes 
dropped on top of an economy that the 
Democrats’ policies have already hurt 
badly, literally—literally—the largest 
tax hike in history. 
Among those increases, President 
Biden wants to use colossal tax hikes 
to punish domestic producers of Amer-
ican energy. World events are remind-
ing us every day how important Amer-
ican oil and natural gas production is 
for our national security and for our 
partners, but President Biden would 
rather grind his ideological ax and es-
calate his holy war on ‘‘Made in Amer-
ica’’ fossil fuels. 
This—this—is the budget request of 
an administration that is completely 
disconnected from reality, of a Presi-
dent who has decided not to pivot, of a 
Democratic Party that has chosen not 
to correct course on its own. 
Every data point suggests that the 
American people want and need a 
major course correction. It appears 
that in about 7 months, they may have 
to provide it themselves. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
week, 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee, which I chair, held its hearing 
on the nomination of Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson to serve as Associate 
Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
It was an opportunity to learn a lot 
about her: her qualifications, her expe-
rience, her approach to cases, her judi-
cial temperament, and her tempera-
ment before the committee. 
She proved to the public what many 
of us suspected and some knew: She is, 
without a doubt, ready to serve on the 
Supreme Court. 
I have spoken before about Judge 
Jackson’s background and qualifica-
tions, but some of it bears repeating 
because this is the critical week before 
we consider her nomination next week 
on the floor of the Senate. 
She is the daughter of two school 
teachers, public school teachers. Judge 
Jackson discovered her passion for the 
law at the age of 4. See, her dad decided 
to give up teaching. He had another 
profession in mind; he was going to be-
come a lawyer. And so he would sit at 
the kitchen table with his law books 
all stacked up, and Judge Jackson, at 
the age of 4, would gather her coloring 
books and sit next to her daddy. She 
was going to study too. 
She believes that might have been 
the first time that she thought seri-
ously about becoming a lawyer. 
After graduating from public high 
school in Miami—she had distinguished 
herself as president of the student body 
and as the lead on the high school 
speech and debate team. She competed 
nationally successfully and visited the 
campus of Harvard University. She 
loved it. She decided that she was 
going to apply to go to school there. 
When she went back to her high 
school in Florida, she sat down with 
her counselor to talk about that op-
tion. The counselor discouraged her; 
she was aiming too high. But she did it 
anyway, and she was accepted and then 
went on to Harvard Law School. 
She has clerked at every level of the 
Federal judiciary. If you are not a law-
yer, that may not mean much; but if 
you are a lawyer, it is a big deal. To 
think that she started off at the lowest 
Federal district court level clerking for 
a judge, then was accepted to move up 
a level to the circuit judge position to 
serve as a clerk as well, and then to fi-
nally grab the gold ring of being a Su-
preme Court clerk to none other than 
Justice Stephen Breyer whose vacancy 
she is hoping to fill. 
She worked in private practice as a 
lawyer, and she proved that she was a 
consensus builder all the way along. On 
the bench, she served as a district 
court judge and now circuit court in 
the DC Circuit. 
It is no surprise that she has won the 
admiration and friendship of so many 
people throughout her career. In fact, 
she has come before the same Senate 
Judiciary Committee on three separate 
occasions with her background care-
fully reviewed and emerged with the 
approval of the committee with bipar-
tisan support. 
In fact, when you look at it, if you 
watched last week’s hearing before the 
Judiciary Committee, no one ques-
tioned her qualifications, her knowl-
edge, her experience. She really has a 
platinum resume when it comes to 
that. 
On the final day of the hearing, the 
committee heard from Anne Williams. 
Anne Williams is well-known to the 
Presiding Officer as well as to myself. 
She served as a district court judge in 
the Northern District of Illinois and 
then as a circuit judge on the Seventh 
Circuit. I believe she was the first Afri-
can-American woman to do so. 
She is retired at this point, but she 
has volunteered with the American Bar 
Association to do the careful review of 
Judge Jackson to make certain that we 
know every comment that has been 
made by professionals who have been 
familiar with her work experience. 
Judge Williams is an anomaly politi-
cally. Those who are looking for evi-
dence as to whether she is Democrat or 
Republican, she was initially appointed 
to the district court by President 
Reagan and then to the circuit court 
by 
President 
Clinton—a 
bipartisan 
nominee all the way. 
She came to report to the committee 
that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 
who had been reviewed with careful 
personal interviews of 250 separate in-
dividuals in her legal career, had 
emerged unanimously well-qualified to 
serve on the Supreme Court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1791 
March 28, 2022 
Judge Williams said that in inter-
viewing these lawyers and judges, they 
asked the hard questions—the ones 
that you can ask in confidence and in 
private—and the answers were all the 
same. 
Judge Jackson has a career that has 
distinguished her as outstanding, ex-
cellent, superior, superb, the list of ac-
colades went on and on. The ABA found 
that Judge Jackson has a sterling rep-
utation 
for 
thoughtfulness 
and 
collegiality 
and 
exceptional 
com-
petence. 
I also asked Judge Williams, serving 
as the spokesperson for the ABA, to 
comment on the allegations that Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson is somehow 
soft on crime. It is a common mantra 
coming from the other side of the aisle. 
And I said, in the course of asking 250 
different judges, prosecutors, defense 
lawyers, and all the people who worked 
with and around her, Was there any 
evidence that she was soft on crime? 
No. None. None. That is amazing when 
you think that is the No. 1 talking 
point against her from the Republican 
side of the aisle. ‘‘None whatsoever’’ is 
exactly what Judge Williams said. An-
other ABA witness, Jean Veta, said 
that the ABA ‘‘heard consistently from 
not only defense counsel, but [from] 
prosecutors’’ of how unbiased Judge 
Jackson was throughout her career. 
And just as impressive as her quali-
fications was her performance and can-
dor before the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. If you ask her a question about 
stare decisis, she will start responding 
by defining it in plain English, just to 
make sure everybody at home, lawyer 
or nonlawyer, can follow along. She ex-
presses her thinking with surgeon-like 
precision, which I am sure her husband, 
Dr. Patrick Johnson, who is an actual 
surgeon at Georgetown University Hos-
pital, deeply admires. Clarity and im-
partiality, that is Judge Jackson. 
During the hearing, several of my 
colleagues asked her to describe her ju-
dicial philosophy. Pick a label: Are you 
an originalist; are you a textualist; are 
you a liberal; are you a conservative? 
Previous Supreme Court nominees like 
Chief Justice Roberts have said that 
they do not have an ‘‘overarching judi-
cial philosophy’’ that they bring to a 
case. 
That was a good enough answer for 
many Republicans if it was given by 
Chief Justice Roberts or Justice Amy 
Coney Barrett, but they have com-
plained now that she just won’t come 
up and admit to a label. 
She did us one better. She gave a 
thorough, step-by-step explanation of 
how she decided a case—every case— 
and she has some 580 separate written 
opinions. You don’t need an electron 
microscope to find this judge’s judicial 
philosophy. She has written it down 
and published it over and over and over 
again. 
She established her independence, 
she says, by ‘‘clearing [her] mind of 
any preconceived notions’’ when she 
gets a case, sets aside her personal 
views, evaluates the facts, listens to 
the arguments, and then she interprets 
and applies the law, keeping in mind 
the limits of judicial authority. 
What I have just described is what 
she told the committee, and it is ex-
actly what we look for and should look 
for in every judge. I can’t recall ever 
hearing a nominee give such a clear 
and thorough explanation of their ap-
proach to deciding a case. And Judge 
Jackson’s evenhanded record on so 
many different issues—criminal law, 
labor 
relations, 
executive 
power— 
shows that it works. 
Finally, the Judiciary Committee 
hearing allowed the public to observe 
Judge Jackson’s incredible judicial 
temperament. We spend a lot of time as 
Senators with the authority under the 
Constitution to advise and consent, 
interviewing nominees for courts, try-
ing to determine just what kind of a 
judge they will be. What will their tem-
perament be? Will they be all swollen 
and big-headed over this black robe and 
lifetime appointment, or will they re-
member the real-life experiences that 
many people in their courtroom have 
lived through? 
Well, I can tell you, Judge Jackson’s 
temperament 
has 
shown 
through. 
Frankly, she was tested time and time 
again. You see, I might just go out on 
a limb and tell you: There are some 
Senators that don’t show a very good 
temperament themselves under these 
circumstances. And they tested her 
over and over and over again with base-
less, wild charges, some of which were 
just offensive on their face. 
I listened to those, and I would look 
up and think, if she stands up at this 
point and says, ‘‘That’s enough. I am 
taking my family, and I’m going 
home,’’ nobody would have faulted her 
for it—some of the questioning was 
just that bad—but she didn’t. 
My Republican colleagues promised a 
fair and respectful hearing. The major-
ity of them, starting with Senator 
GRASSLEY, did just that; and I com-
mended them for it today in the com-
mittee. They set an example of a mi-
nority party with a Supreme Court 
nominee 
and 
how 
the 
questioning 
should come down. Unfortunately, oth-
ers, however, on that side of the table 
did not. 
But in the face of the constant badg-
ering and interruptions, offensive in-
sinuations by a select few Republicans, 
Judge 
Jackson 
never 
lost 
her 
composure—never. She was patient, 
calm, and dignified. 
Many times, the questions were so 
mean-spirited. And I thought, there 
sits her husband and her daughter lis-
tening to these charges on how she is 
soft on crime and doesn’t care about 
the plight of children. And when you 
think about that, what they must 
think of to hear those things said 
about the doctor’s wife and the kid’s 
mother. It is just hard to take. 
She was patient and kind. She didn’t 
lose her temper at one time. Some of 
my colleagues attended the commit-
tee’s hearing intent on tearing her 
down. It didn’t work. Instead, she 
showed America that she can rise to 
any challenge as a Justice on the Su-
preme Court. 
And despite some of my colleagues’ 
behavior in the committee hearings, 
last week was an inspiration for so 
many people across this country. I in-
vited law students from Howard Uni-
versity and my alma mater George-
town Law to come over and sit through 
the hearing. We invited interns from 
the Congressional Black Caucus Foun-
dation. They wanted to be there at this 
history-making moment. 
They watched her prove that through 
hard work, a commitment to the law, 
and in the words of Senator BOOKER, 
her grit and grace, she has earned a 
seat on the highest Court in the land. 
I strongly urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to take a look at 
this woman and what she will bring to 
the Court. 
It is time, America, after all these 
years, never having had an African- 
American woman serve on the Court. It 
has got to be a challenge to find some-
body who is ready to take on the job 
and take on the challenge. She can 
meet that challenge and will success-
fully. She is the best and deserves our 
support. 
REMEMBERING MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
On another topic, Madam President, 
last week, America and the world lost 
another trailblazing woman and de-
fender of justice and democracy—and a 
friend. 
Madeleine Korbel Albright came to 
the United States at age 11 as a ref-
ugee. Her family had been driven out of 
their native Czechoslovakia twice by 
murderous regimes, in 1938 by the 
Nazis and 10 years later by the com-
munists. 
Those searing childhood upheavals 
helped to produce in this young woman 
a lifelong vigilance against dictators 
and a fierce commitment to democ-
racy. 
Her father had been a diplomat who 
received political asylum in America. 
Like nearly all immigrants and refu-
gees who come to this country fleeing 
the tyranny of autocracy, he was keen-
ly aware that this was a land of free-
dom. He told his daughter many times, 
‘‘Americans don’t know how fragile 
their democracy is—and how resilient 
it is.’’ 
She also knew persistent autocracy. 
It can rise at any age in any nation. We 
see it today in the leadership of Russia. 
That is why we must protect the rule 
of law, the most potent defense against 
dictators. 
In 1997, she made history. She be-
came America’s first woman Secretary 
of State under President Clinton, pre-
viously serving as our Nation’s Ambas-
sador to the United Nations. She was a 
hardline critic of tyrants and despots 
who advocated the policy of assertive 
multilateralism, and she called the 
United States ‘‘the indispensable na-
tion.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1792 
March 28, 2022 
She believed that the best hope for a 
free and peaceful world lay in America, 
exercising leadership and working with 
the family of Democratic nations to 
protect democracy, just as we are 
today in Ukraine. 
She was deeply committed to NATO. 
As Secretary of State, she supported 
NATO expansion to include Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic—three 
nations that lived under the boot heel 
of Soviet oppression. Today, all three 
nations are providing a haven for 
Ukrainian civilians, mostly women and 
children, 
who 
are 
fleeing 
Putin’s 
unprovoked and barbaric war on that 
young democracy. 
Madeleine Albright understood that 
any democracy could fall victim to the 
siren song of autocracy if its citizens 
were not vigilant. After her historic ca-
reer in public service, she was chair of 
an organization called the National 
Democratic Institute, helping young 
democracies build independent court 
systems and a vibrant civil society. 
She spoke to me about this impor-
tant work and understood that for de-
mocracies to endure, they must offer 
more than promises. In one of her last 
interviews, Madeleine Albright offered 
a warning that we in this Senate 
should be wise to remember. She said: 
What is important is that democracy has 
to deliver. People want to vote and eat. And 
therefore it is very important for democ-
racies, and certainly for the world’s oldest, 
to understand the rule of law—because cor-
ruption is the cancer of democracy . . . The 
people need to be the beneficiaries of [democ-
racy]. 
Likely because of her family’s own 
experience with fleeing tyranny, Mad-
eleine Albright was quicker than many 
at recognizing dictators when she saw 
them. She first met Vladimir Putin in 
the year 2000, 1 year after his meteoric 
rise from a mid-level, mediocre KGB 
apparatchik to President of the Rus-
sian Federation. She recorded her first 
impressions of Vladimir Putin over 20 
years ago. She wrote: 
Putin is small and pale, so cold as to be al-
most reptilian. 
She went on to note presciently that 
Putin was ‘‘embarrassed about what 
happened to his country and deter-
mined to restore its greatness.’’ 
The violence and destruction that 
Vladimir Putin is willing to wage in 
pursuit of this delusion to make Russia 
great again is now horrifyingly obvious 
to the entire world. 
Let me say at the outset: I have no 
quarrel with the people of Russia. They 
are good people and have a great his-
tory. There were chapters in there that 
were oppressive and terrible to their 
neighbors and the countries that suf-
fered under Stalin and the reach of the 
Soviet Union. But at their heart, I be-
lieve the Russians are good people. 
Sadly, I cannot say the same about 
their leader. 
The brutal assault on Ukraine is now 
in its second month. Yesterday, at the 
water tower in downtown Chicago, we 
had a rally for Ukrainians. It was cold. 
This time of year, it is cold in Chicago. 
It was probably 30 degrees, and the 
wind was blowing. But what a crowd 
showed up—several hundred people— 
many bearing Ukrainian flags and, of 
course, proud of their Ukrainian herit-
age, but from so many other places as 
well. Groups of people were there who 
were Indian Americans who wanted to 
show support. 
I was proud that the Baltic Ameri-
cans—Lithuanians, 
Latvians, 
Esto-
nians—once again were there in force. I 
was also proud that the Polish people 
came, because they have a special kin-
ship to Ukraine at this moment in his-
tory. 
Poland is accepting more refugees 
from Ukraine than any other nation 
and is making great personal sacrifice 
to do it. 
As the Polish Ambassador told us 2 
weeks ago, when people get off that 
train for the first stop in Poland, fi-
nally, they are on safe soil, out of 
Ukraine. They don’t look for people— 
soldiers and police—to guide them. 
What they find is that people are in 
their cars, waiting, with the doors 
open, to bring them in even if they are 
total strangers. 
The Polish Ambassador said: You 
don’t see any refugee camps in Poland. 
No. People are going into the homes 
of other Polish families and are being 
welcomed into those homes. 
He said: The reason we are feeling 
this way about our neighbors is that, 
when it happened to us many years 
ago, no one would take us in. We re-
member those days. 
What a reminder to us in the United 
States. 
You know, when the President said 
last week that he wants to accept 
100,000 refugees from Ukraine, I ap-
plauded it, as did others, but just for a 
point of reference, a nation of 5 mil-
lion, known as Ireland, has also agreed 
to accept 100,000 refugees. So the 
United States is showing some charity, 
but we can do more. We shouldn’t limit 
it just to refugees from Ukraine. There 
are refugees from wars and calamities 
around the world who also need an op-
portunity to be in a safe place. The 
United States has enjoyed that reputa-
tion for almost 80 years, and we did it 
after World War II. We should return to 
those days. 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Ref-
ugees 
calculates 
that 
10 
million 
Ukrainians—almost a fourth of the 
population—have 
been 
driven 
from 
their homes and displaced—1 out of 4. 
Another 3.5 million Ukrainians have 
fled to neighboring nations, especially 
to Poland. The city of Warsaw alone is 
admitting 1,000 Ukrainian children to 
its schools every day—1,000 Ukrainian 
kids a day into Poland. 
Joe Biden, our President, under-
stands the same truth that Madeleine 
Albright saw—that the struggle be-
tween dictatorships and democracy did 
not end with the defeat of Nazism or 
the fall of the Berlin Wall. It continues 
in this century, and Ukraine is now the 
new frontline in this old battle. 
Critics of the President’s will no 
doubt fixate on one unscripted line of 
his speech in Poland. I say to those 
critics: Who among you has not uttered 
the same thought? Who doubts for one 
second this world would be more secure 
without the likes of such a tyrant? 
The Russian people have to make 
that decision, and if they are given the 
truth, I am sure they will make the 
right decision. That is why Vladimir 
Putin is trying to control the media. 
The Russian people will decide for 
themselves whether Putin stays or 
goes. 
The duty of democracy is to make 
sure that people have the final word as 
to their own destinies within their own 
borders. President Biden is leading a 
historic effort of the NATO alliance on 
behalf of the people of Ukraine. I salute 
him for his leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
BUDGET PROPOSAL 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this morning, President Biden released 
his budget for fiscal year 2023. 
When you compare the President’s 
agenda with the nasty Republican pro-
posals, like the one from the Senator 
from Florida, it is clear that the con-
trast between the two parties is stark 
and glaring. One budget is for the 
ultrarich, and the other budget is for 
the middle class and those working to 
get there. 
President Biden’s vision for America 
is refreshingly bold, responsible, and 
taps 
into 
our 
Nation’s 
greatest 
strength—the American people them-
selves. It is a good, strong budget that 
will help build on the historic growth 
of the past year. 
For starters, the President’s budget 
zeros in on fighting inflation. It calls, 
for instance, on increasing domestic 
manufacturing and relieving supply 
chain bottlenecks, especially at our 
ports. 
It increases help for American fami-
lies to afford childcare, pre-K, and pro-
vides more funding to help schools with 
the academic and mental health re-
sources to help students thrive. 
It builds on the President’s promise 
to expand healthcare and supports ef-
forts to lower prescription drug costs. 
Lowering prescription drug costs is one 
of the highest priorities of Senate 
Democrats, and we are eager and ready 
to work with the administration on 
this front. 
After years of Trump budgets that 
didn’t even mention the word ‘‘cli-
mate,’’ President Biden’s plan would 
boost investments in clean energy, 
lower the costs of energy for low-in-
come Americans, and speed up our 
transition to clean cars made right 
here in America, which will create 
thousands and thousands of good-pay-
ing new jobs.

fair share. Most Americans think it is 
unacceptable for those at the top to 
pay less in taxes than teachers and 
firefighters. God bless the rich—I have 
nothing against them—but I applaud 
the President’s proposal for making 
sure the ultrarich chip in to growing 
our country. 
Finally, I commend the President for 
releasing a budget that honors our Na-
tion’s promise to Ukraine while keep-
ing Americans around the world safe 
from harm. 
Now compare the President’s budget, 
President Biden’s budget, to the bewil-
dering vision laid out by Senate Repub-
licans in recent weeks. 
While Democrats want to lower costs 
for American families, Republicans are 
openly calling on raising taxes on most 
Americans. 
Yesterday, the junior Senator from 
Florida went on FOX News Sunday to 
deny this part of his plan, only for the 
anchor—the FOX anchor—to remind 
everyone watching: ‘‘No, it’s in the 
plan.’’ 
While Democrats want to strengthen 
Medicare and make healthcare more 
affordable, Republicans have resur-
rected calls to repeal healthcare and 
even possibly put Medicare on the 
chopping block. And lest anyone for-
get, a few months ago, the junior Sen-
ator from Florida, in another example, 
openly said inflation was a ‘‘gold 
mine’’—a gold mine—for the Repub-
lican Party, a gold mine. People are 
hurt; it is a gold mine for the Repub-
lican Party. 
Just how callous, how retrograde, 
how backward is the Republican vision 
for America? raising taxes on working 
people? cheerleading inflation? stoking 
divisions and even putting things like 
Medicare at risk while pushing tax 
breaks for the ultrarich? If that is 
their pitch to the American people, 
God help Republicans. 
In the meantime, I thank President 
Biden for releasing a strong, opti-
mistic, and responsible plan that will 
build on the historic recovery our Na-
tion has seen in the past year. 
Senate Democrats will work with the 
administration to put these proposals 
into concrete legislation in the weeks 
and months to come. 
H.R. 4521 
Madam President, now on the com-
petition bill, it is an important day 
here on the Senate floor. In a few 
hours, we will hold a vote on final pas-
sage for the bipartisan jobs and com-
petitiveness legislation many of us 
have worked on for over a year. 
For the information of all, today’s 
action will come in two steps. We will 
first vote on cloture on the substitute 
amendment, which contains the text of 
the Senate-passed United States Inno-
vation and Competition Act. Then we 
will proceed to final passage. Both 
votes are set at a 60-vote threshold, 
and I am confident that we will wrap 
up this important work by the end of 
the day. 
As I have said since the beginning of 
this process, the actions we are taking 
on the Senate floor will enable us to 
enter a conference committee with the 
House, which we need in order to final-
ize our competitiveness bill. I believe 
we can see a conference committee ini-
tiated by the end of this work period. 
If enacted, I believe this legislation 
will be one of the most important ac-
complishments of the 117th Congress. 
This bill, for all its provisions, is really 
about two big things: creating more 
American jobs and lowering costs for 
American families. 
It will help lowering costs by making 
it easier to produce critical tech-
nologies here at home, like semi-
conductors. It will create more jobs by 
bringing 
manufacturing 
back 
from 
overseas. 
And just as importantly, this legisla-
tion will fuel another generation of 
American innovation. Whichever na-
tion is the first to master the tech-
nologies of tomorrow will reshape the 
world in its image. America cannot af-
ford to come in second place when it 
comes to technologies like 5G, AI, 
quantum computing, semiconductors, 
bioengineering, and so much more. 
This bill is a necessary step toward 
securing the bright future of American 
ingenuity, which has always helped us 
lead the way. 
I want to thank my colleagues from 
both sides of the aisle for everything 
they have done to help us each this mo-
ment. It has been a long, hard road, but 
almost every Member of this Chamber 
has had a hand in putting this bill to-
gether. It was a blend of various pro-
posals across various committees, and 
it was a product of a healthy amend-
ment process both in committee and on 
the floor. 
We are, hopefully, just a few hours 
away from reaching the next important 
step in the process, putting us on a 
glidepath to initiating a conference 
committee with the House. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on COVID, over 
the past few weeks, our country has 
made major strides in the fight against 
COVID. Cases, deaths, and hospitaliza-
tions are coming down and staying 
down. Schools and communities are 
opening up and staying open. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
this 
progress, Congress must now act to 
make sure that our communities, our 
healthcare workers, and our families 
have the resources they need to keep 
our country open. Sadly, public fund-
ing for COVID relief is in critical dan-
ger of actually running out. 
That is why right now I am working 
with my Republican colleagues to 
reach a bipartisan agreement on an-
other COVID–19 package. The White 
House has been unambiguous in saying 
they need more funding with all due 
haste, so that is what we are working 
to secure ASAP. 
A new bipartisan bill will pay for all 
the tools we know work best against 
new variants: It will ensure we have 
enough 
vaccines; 
enough 
testing; 
enough therapeutics, which do amazing 
things if you get them in time; and 
support our schools to stay open in a 
safe way. We also need to do more to 
boost global vaccination efforts and 
support cutting-edge research into new 
vaccines. 
We already know what to do in order 
to keep life going as normally as pos-
sible should another variant threaten 
to unravel our progress. Now we simply 
need to secure the funding to make 
sure we can keep schools open and our 
communities as safe as possible. If you 
don’t go for the funding and a new vari-
ant hits and it gets bad, shame on you. 
Everyone should be for this. 
Over the next few days, we will keep 
negotiating with our Republican col-
leagues in good faith. While we are not 
there yet, talks have been encouraging, 
and I hope we can reach an agreement 
very soon.

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, during the first few months of 
President Biden’s term, he has tried to 
brush off the surge of illegal immigrant 
apprehensions as nothing more than a 
seasonal trend. But after month 6, sea-
sonal migration was no longer a valid 
explanation for what turned out to be a 
recordbreaking year. 
This border surge wasn’t by accident. 
President Biden pledged to enact an 
open border agenda by halting border 
wall construction, reversing successful 
Trump-era immigration policies, and 
hamstringing our law enforcement offi-
cers. It was one promise he has kept.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1794 
March 28, 2022 
And over a year into the Biden admin-
istration, we are seeing the con-
sequences of that promise. 
Just last year, nearly 2 million ille-
gal immigrants were apprehended at 
our southern border from more than 160 
different countries. And for 2022, it 
looks like we are on track to exceed 
that record, as this February was the 
12th—the 
12th—consecutive 
month 
with over 100,000 illegal immigrant ap-
prehensions. And if President Biden’s 
administration stops invoking title 42, 
and it doesn’t secure the border, the 
crisis is going to be dramatically dif-
ferent. 
A lot of attention is paid to who is 
coming across the border, and right-
fully so, but it is time we all turn our 
attention to what is coming across the 
border, and it is called deadly fentanyl. 
Just as our border continues to be 
overwhelmed by illegal immigrants, 
our communities are overwhelmed with 
this lethal drug. I have been to the bor-
der, and I have seen firsthand the im-
pact of President Biden’s open border 
policies and agenda. 
At a checkpoint in McAllen, TX, I 
saw a truck bed filled with fentanyl, 
filled to the brim—a deadly synthetic 
opioid. 
Thankfully, our Border Patrol officer 
stopped this particular truck from 
making it across the border, but for 
that one being stopped, there are sev-
eral more that get across the border. 
Thankfully, our Border Patrol officer 
stopped this truck, stopped it from 
making it across the border, and it 
saved many lives. But for every truck 
of fentanyl, many, many more con-
tinue to come across. 
It is hard to understand the signifi-
cance of a truck bed full of fentanyl, so 
just let me break it down. 
Look at my chart. Two milligrams of 
fentanyl is considered a lethal dose; 2 
milligrams is the weight of a mosquito. 
Ten pennies weigh one ounce. One 
ounce of fentanyl can kill nearly 30,000 
people. A football weighs 1 pound. Just 
1 pound of fentanyl can kill over 200,000 
people. 
In October of last year, in South Ala-
bama, Baldwin County sheriff deputy 
seized 14 grams of fentanyl. That is 
enough to kill upward of 7,000 people. 
And, of course, in any arrest, some-
times 
you 
have 
problems 
with 
fentanyl. One of his deputies just hap-
pened to touch fentanyl and was imme-
diately put into the hospital. 
We are seizing these deadly drugs 
across America every day. Last year, 
in San Diego, a trucker was arrested 
after attempting to smuggle more than 
389 pounds of fentanyl, which is enough 
to kill 88 million people. 
The connection between President 
Biden’s open border policies and the 
rise of fentanyl is clear, and the Amer-
ican people are paying a heavy, heavy 
price. 
Since President Biden’s inaugura-
tion, Customs and Border Protection 
seized nearly 3,000 pounds of illicit 
fentanyl. That is a 41-percent increase 
from last year. 
Over the last year, opioids took the 
lives of over 100,000 Americans. To put 
that into perspective, that is half the 
size of our capital city in the State of 
Alabama, which would be almost wiped 
off the map. This is bone-chilling. 
But these numbers are more impor-
tant than a stat. They are the sons and 
daughters, the mothers and fathers, 
the brothers and sisters who were all 
taken too soon—bright futures dark-
ened by deadly drug addiction. 
I spent 40 years traveling across this 
country visiting young athletes and 
their families from every walk of life. I 
had players who battled addiction or 
who had close friends who battled ad-
diction. It is a heartbreaking procedure 
to watch a student worry about step-
ping in for a parent who is suffering 
from addiction. That happens daily. 
When they should be only worrying 
about studying or getting ready for a 
game, they are also covering for par-
ents who are addicted to drugs. 
It is true that drug addiction has 
plagued our country for decades, but 
we have seen a sharp rise since the pan-
demic: isolations, loss of work, depres-
sion, all making the problem worse. 
And the data confirms this. So it only 
makes sense to do all we can to help 
Americans. That would include cutting 
off the drugs at the primary source, 
which is the southern border. Yet the 
President refuses to take decisive ac-
tion to stop these deadly substances 
from flooding into the country. 
In fact, the answer from the Biden 
administration is there will be a strat-
egy for dealing with addiction and 
fentanyl crisis coming ‘‘soon.’’ 
When President Biden’s drug czar, 
Dr. Gupta, was asked about the admin-
istration’s plans to address the addic-
tion crisis, he responded that the drug 
control strategy was in its ‘‘advanced 
stages of being finalized.’’ 
To that I say, Americans are losing 
their lives right now. Lives are being 
lost every day when we are coming up 
with a strategy. We don’t need a bu-
reaucratic talking point or a bureau-
crat wasting our time. We need a 
plan—and we need a plan now—to stop 
these drugs. 
Since President Biden has been in of-
fice, he has failed to take charge in 
every situation. Sadly, the drug over-
dose epidemic is no different. While the 
folks at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue con-
tinue to work on their strategy, I pro-
pose President Biden take a logical and 
long-overdue first step today: enforce 
our immigration laws at the border— 
that would be a great start—end the 
free flow of fentanyl, and stop the loss 
of innocent lives. 
For a White House that is so laser-fo-
cused on the health of Americans as it 
relates to the pandemic—masks, 6 feet 
apart, airports—the same emphasis 
should be cast on the people’s lives 
that we are losing and the deadly drugs 
coming into our country illegally. 
By creating and then failing to ad-
dress this disastrous situation at the 
southern border, President Biden has 
fueled another crisis as fentanyl rav-
ages our communities. 
You know, we all watched this week-
end as President Biden gave a great 
speech in Poland. He put the wrath 
down on the Russian people, military, 
and the President of Russia, Vladimir 
Putin. He showed anger—and he should 
have—at the destruction that is going 
on in Ukraine and the innocent lives 
lost. 
President Biden needs to show the 
same anger. We will lose more people 
in the next 6 months than they will 
lose in this war in Ukraine—people in 
our country—and it is being over-
looked. It is not being worked on. The 
problem is not trying to be answered. 
It is like we are having to just deal 
with it. 
We have got a problem here, Mr. 
President, and we need to address it. 
The President has the tools and the 
authority to act quickly and save lives. 
I just hope, sooner or later, somebody 
recognizes it and does something about 
it because, as we speak, we are not an-
swering this problem. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING RAY MARK LINDSEY 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, in 
May of 2013, one of my constituents, 
Bob Evans from Lawrence County, was 
placed on the kidney transplant list. 
His particular kidney ailment was he-
reditary, meaning family members who 
might have been a match could not do-
nate. So Bob was left waiting for some-
one—someone—to step forward. 
Unbeknownst to Bob, an acquaint-
ance, Ray Lindsey, quietly went to get 
tested. Now, Ray took several days off 
work, traveling 3 hours round trip to 
Indianapolis to see if he would be a 
match. He was. And only then did Ray 
tell Bob what he had been up to. In the 
summer of 2014, Ray donated a kidney, 
and he saved Bob’s life. 
Yesterday, Ray, one of the most self-
less people I have ever met, passed 
away after a courageous battle with 
cancer. 
Ray was a humble and unassuming 
family man with a sense of humor. On 
his Facebook page, he called himself a 
‘‘part-time hillbilly.’’ Ray worked hard 
and, by the way, didn’t get any com-
pensation whatsoever for the weeks he 
had to take off while recuperating from 
surgery. 
Ray’s sacrifice has made a lasting 
impact on public policy. His story im-
pacted and informed my interest in 
organ donation policy. I introduced the 
PRISE Act to incentivize new break-
throughs in kidney disease treatment 
options. In 2018, the Trump administra-
tion created a similar program called 
KidneyX. 
We know Ray saved one life, but his 
story and selflessness impacted poten-
tially thousands more. 
Bob, by the way, is still going strong 
today, 8 years after the transplant sur-
gery. 
Ray was a man of deep faith, and I 
can think of no better tribute to Ray 
than words found in John, chapter 15:

My command is this. Love each other as I 
have loved you. Greater love has no one than 
this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. 
Ray lived those words, and I and 
countless others are going to miss him 
deeply. I offer my condolences to all 
who loved Ray, including his wife 
Debbie, 
three 
children, 
and 
eight 
grandchildren. Ray’s incredible life and

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, well before we gaveled in to last 
week’s Supreme Court confirmation 
hearing, our friends in the mainstream 
media had made it clear what the ap-
proved narrative was going to be. Ac-
cording to them, we were supposed to 
talk about what a historic moment it 
was and what a historic nominee Judge 
Jackson is. 
My Democratic colleagues on the Ju-
diciary Committee spent most of their 
time focusing on the approved talking 
points memo, but those of us who 
didn’t play along were punished in 
print. 
But, back home in Tennessee, these 
unhinged attacks by the media went 
over like a lead balloon, and I think 
my Democratic colleagues would ben-
efit from listening to what people out-
side of Washington, DC, have to say be-
cause they—the people—are the ones 
who 
will 
bear 
the 
practical 
con-
sequences of what happens here in DC. 
Now, on Thursday, my Democratic 
colleagues declared victory for Judge 
Jackson, but Tennesseans I talked to 
this weekend still have a lot of ques-
tions. They expected more from her. 
They don’t appreciate being called rac-
ist for saying they expected more. 
They wanted her to answer tough ques-
tions about the Constitution. They 
wanted assurance that a Justice Jack-
son would protect their constitutional 
rights. 
They have no problem with having a 
former public defender on the Court. 
That could even be a good thing. But 
they wanted her to account for her 
record of granting light sentences to 
dangerous 
criminals. 
Why 
did 
she 
choose to let some of them out of jail 
on compassionate release? 
I asked those questions, and I com-
mend all of my colleagues on the com-
mittee who dug in and did the same 
thing. Many of my Democratic col-
leagues, on the other hand, accused us 
of ‘‘tarnishing’’ their historic moment. 
But Tennesseans didn’t see it that way. 
They say it was the Democrats who 
tarnished the proceedings by ignoring 
their duty to vet Judge Jackson, who is 
up for a lifetime appointment to the 
highest Court in the land. They feel it 
was the media that tarnished the mo-
ment by politicizing—politicizing—the 
hearings. 
Now, I cannot support Judge Jack-
son’s 
nomination 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court, but I am withholding my sup-
port for reasons my Democratic col-
leagues and the media have chosen to 
ignore. For all the focus my colleagues 
placed on ‘‘judicial philosophy’’ in pre-
vious confirmation hearings, I had 
hoped that Judge Jackson would come 
ready to tell us about hers, but she 
didn’t. Instead, she came armed with a 
methodology that spoke to the thor-
oughness of her process but said very 
little about her approach to constitu-
tional interpretation. 
After the hysteria that broke out 
during Justice Barrett’s hearings about 
the so-called dangers of originalism, I 
thought we might discover what sort of 
jurist my Democratic colleagues think 
would be more effective than a con-
stitutionalist. But oh no—to ask that— 
you are not supposed to do that. 
But, suddenly, judicial philosophy 
meant nothing. As I said, don’t ask 
that question. What role the Constitu-
tion plays in Judge Jackson’s ‘‘meth-
odology’’ meant nothing to them. 
Don’t ask that question. 
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad 
news, but this is not a subject the 
American people are willing to ignore. 
They want you to ask the questions 
and get answers. They don’t expect to 
agree with a Justice 100 percent of the 
time, but they do expect those nomi-
nees to adhere to a standard. They 
want a constitutionalist, not a judicial 
activist, and at this point, they have 
no idea what rules she will follow if in-
deed she is confirmed. 
All we can do is look at her record. 
Judge Jackson spent a lot of time de-
fending her work. Tennesseans are just 
as worried about what she was trying 
to distance herself from. What did she 
want us to not know? 
Associations are important. You can 
tell a lot about a person by looking at 
who their friends are, and, as it turns 
out, Judge Jackson has some pretty 
controversial friends. 
Over the past few years, we have seen 
progressive activists use critical race 
theory to try and redefine our history 
and change the way Americans view 
their place in the world. It is a per-
nicious philosophical lens, and the ef-
fect it has on kids in the classroom is 
weighing heavily on the hearts of Ten-
nessee parents. 
Now, in her hearing, Judge Jackson 
brushed aside my questions about her 
views on CRT. She wrote it off as an 
‘‘academic theory,’’ which it is, but my 
questions were about how she may or 
may not apply that academic theory to 
her decisions. Why does she choose to 
give that academic theory the same 
weight as administrative law or con-
stitutional law when she is making 
those decisions? 
One particular item she tried to dis-
tance herself from is her praise for the 
so-called progressive curriculum at 
Georgetown Day School, where she sits 
on the board. Here is what she said in 
the winter 2019 edition of the school’s 
magazine. 
Since becoming part of the GDS commu-
nity 7 years ago, I have witnessed the trans-
formative power of a rigorous progressive 
education. 
As 
Judge 
Jackson 
pointed 
out, 
Georgetown Day is a private school— 
an elite private school. They can teach 
what they want, and parents can 
choose to take their kids out and go 
elsewhere if they don’t like it. 
But here is the wrinkle. It is getting 
harder for parents in Tennessee to do 
that because so-called progressive edu-
cation is taking over public schools 
also. And part of that progressive edu-
cation requires getting in between par-
ents and their children. 
Here is why it was so important to 
air this out during a confirmation 
hearing. We were examining a nominee 
who has spent nearly a decade on the 
bench yet cannot describe her funda-
mental approach to the law—not her 
approach to deciding cases or sen-
tencing criminals but to reading and 
interpreting the Constitution. 
So when Tennesseans hear a nominee 
refuse to answer these questions—when 
she gives an opening statement and 
talks about how she makes decisions 
by starting from a point of neutrality, 
by looking at the facts of the case, by 
looking at precedent, you have to say: 
Where does the Constitution fit into 
your decision? 
At the same time that she is prac-
ticing that methodology of deciding 
cases, she is associating herself with 
philosophies meant to divide children 
from their parents. They feel entitled 
to know what role these associations 
are going to play in her decision ma-
trix. 
Questions are not attacks, and that 
is a point that needs to be made. To 
ask questions is not an attack. How do 
we keep our Nation free and strong? We 
do it by robust, respectful debate. That 
requires that you ask questions of indi-
viduals who come before you, that you 
ask questions of individuals who have a 
different opinion than you have or who 
hold a different political or govern-
mental philosophy than you hold. 
Questions are not attacks. 
Challenging the application of CRT 
in elementary school classes is not 
‘‘racism.’’ Standing firm on the defini-
tion of ‘‘woman’’ is not ‘‘transphobia.’’ 
This isn’t personal. We are talking 
about a lifetime appointment, and the 
people deserve to know who this nomi-
nee is and what she believes. 
I thought it was so interesting that 
so regularly through the hearing, peo-
ple would reference her background 
and her family and the strong connec-
tions as part of what makes her who 
she is and informs her decisionmaking 
and how important that is. The letters 
of support to her all mention that. But 
if you question some of this, then the 
media, then my Democratic colleagues

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1796 
March 28, 2022 
say that is an attack. No, my friends, 
it is not. It is not an attack because 
words have meaning. You don’t leave 
words like ‘‘parenthood’’ and ‘‘woman-
hood’’ up for interpretation. You know 
what they mean. 
Judge Jackson had 3 days to con-
vince this country that her method-
ology—not her judicial philosophy but 
her methodology—can help her answer 
these questions. In my opinion, she 
failed at that task. 
In this building, I don’t speak for my-
self; I speak for the people of the great 
State of Tennessee. I cannot in good 
conscience give their endorsement to a 
nominee who by all accounts is legally 
and constitutionally adrift. What is her 
standard? We still don’t know. What 
keeps her grounded in the law? We are 
not sure about that one either. What 
keeps her from infusing politics into 
her rulings? We don’t have an answer 
for that. Those are things that, this 
weekend, Tennesseans would say: I 
want to know this. 
My Democratic colleagues don’t want 
to talk about this; neither does the 
media. They have spent their time 
whipping up people, looking for out-
rage, looking for click bait. But here is 
what I will say in conclusion: Every 
single one of Judge Jackson’s contem-
poraries have been more than happy to 
answer these questions. They do regu-
larly as they have come before us for 
Supreme Court confirmation hearings. 
So why will not Judge Jackson? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
BIDEN FAMILY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today, Senator JOHNSON and I begin a 
series of speeches on our investigations 
into the Biden family’s financial deals. 
We will make these presentations with 
two themes. 
First, we will refute and we will dis-
mantle the talking points that the lib-
eral media and our Democratic col-
leagues pushed onto the American peo-
ple. Their talking points said that our 
investigations over the years advanced 
and spread Russian disinformation. On 
November 29, 2021; May 11, 2021; March 
18, 2021; December 14, 2020; December 
10, 2020; October 19, 2020; and September 
29, 2020, I came to this Senate floor to 
rebut those false charges. 
Now—or at least then—the liberal 
media and my Democratic colleagues 
ought to be ashamed of themselves for 
the outright lies that they peddled 
about our investigative work. As a re-
sult, Senator JOHNSON and I did what 
any good investigator would do: We 
gathered even more records to prove all 
these people wrong, which brings me to 
the second theme. 
Senator JOHNSON and I will produce 
new records to show additional connec-
tions between the Biden family and the 
communist Chinese regime. Before we 
get to those records, I am going to dis-
cuss the background of our investiga-
tion. 
We started this investigation last 
Congress. Then, I was chairman of the 
Finance Committee, and at that time, 
Senator JOHNSON was chairman of the 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee. 
It began in August 2019. I started at 
that time an inquiry into a transaction 
involving Hunter Biden that was re-
viewed by the Federal Government’s 
Committee on Foreign Investment. 
On September 23, 2020, Senator JOHN-
SON and I released our report. On No-
vember 18, 2020, we released our supple-
ment to that report. Those reports 
were based in large part on Obama ad-
ministration government records and 
also almost a dozen transcribed inter-
views of government officials. 
In both reports, Senator JOHNSON and 
I made financial information public 
that hadn’t ever been known before. 
Our report exposed extensive financial 
relationships 
between 
Hunter 
and 
James Biden and Chinese nationals 
connected to the communist regime. 
More precisely, these were Chinese na-
tionals connected to the Chinese Gov-
ernment’s military and intelligence 
service. 
One of those individuals was a person 
by the name of Patrick Ho. According 
to reports, Hunter Biden said of Pat-
rick Ho: 
I have another New York Times reporter 
calling about my representation of Patrick 
Ho— 
Then Hunter Biden says the f-word— 
[denoting] the spy chief of China who started 
the company that my partner, who is worth 
$323 billion, founded and is now missing. 
We will get into more detail with re-
spect to Patrick Ho in future speeches. 
We will do the same with Gongwen 
Dong, another close associate of Hun-
ter Biden’s who was connected to the 
communist regime. 
Now, Hunter Biden’s reference to 
‘‘my partner’’ is an apparent reference 
to Ye Jianming. Ye had connections to 
the People’s Liberation Army. Ye had a 
company called CEFC, which had mul-
tiple variations. Today and in future 
speeches, Senator JOHNSON and I will 
simply refer to that company as CEFC. 
Documents show that CEFC’s cor-
porate mission was ‘‘to expand co-
operation in the international energy 
economy and contribute to national de-
velopment.’’ Now, let me emphasize 
that word ‘‘national’’ in that quote, 
‘‘national development.’’ CEFC existed 
for 
the 
communist 
state. 
Indeed, 
records show that CEFC is dedicating 
itself to serving China’s national en-
ergy 
strategy, 
developing 
national 
strategic 
reserves 
for 
oil, 
and 
‘‘partnering 
with 
centrally-adminis-
tered and state-owned enterprises.’’ 
Records prepared by one of Hunter 
and James Biden’s business associates, 
James Gilliar, say the following about 
this company, CEFC: 
At the time, China was hungry for crude, 
but its state-backed companies were having 
difficulty closing some deals abroad. The op-
tics of China’s state-backed giants marching 
into a country to buy and extract oil weren’t 
great for central Asian politicians. This 
paved the way for private firms like CEFC, 
which can strike oil deals in Europe and the 
Middle East where Chinese State Owned En-
terprises could bring political liabilities. 
Documents also show that CEFC ‘‘is 
building an energy storage and logis-
tics system in Europe’’ to connect 
China, Europe, and the Middle East. 
You may ask, why? Plainly, to serve 
‘‘China’s ambitions to have overseas 
storage locations connected with world 
markets.’’ 
The document further states that 
CEFC’s investment bank division has 
investments 
in 
the 
energy 
sector 
‘‘which are in tandem with the govern-
ment’s 4 trillion dollar One Belt One 
Road foreign investment program.’’ 
Then CEFC operated under the guise 
of a private company but was for all in-
tents and purposes an arm of the Chi-
nese Government. 
Hunter 
Biden 
and 
James 
Biden 
served as the perfect vehicle by which 
the communist Chinese Government 
could gain inroads here in the United 
States through CEFC and its affiliates. 
And these inroads were focused on 
Chinese advancement into the global 
and U.S. energy sector. Hunter and 
James Biden were more than happy to 
go along, of course, for the right price. 
So now let’s turn to the first poster, 
which shows bank records that haven’t 
been made public before now. This is a 
portion of a document that we—mean-
ing Senator JOHNSON and I—will re-
lease in full. 
The topic of this poster shows a wire 
transaction on August 4, 2017, from 
CEFC to Wells Fargo Clearing Services 
for $100,000. 
Now, look at the bottom of the post-
er. This is the underlying data of this 
transaction. It states: 
Further credit to OWASCO. 
OWASCO is Hunter Biden’s firm. 
Now, there is no middleman in this 
transaction. This is $100,000 from what 
is, effectively, an arm of the com-
munist Chinese Government direct to 
Hunter Biden. 
So a second question, a question to 
the liberal media and my Democratic 
colleagues, who accused us, over the 
last 2 years, of distributing Russian 
disinformation: Is this official bank 
document Russian disinformation? 
Now, beyond this document, in future 
speeches, Senator JOHNSON and I will 
show you more transfers between and 
among 
such 
companies 
as 
CEFC, 
Northern International Capital, Hud-
son 
West 
Three, 
Hunter 
Biden’s 
OWASCO, and James Biden’s Lion Hall 
Group. 
In doing so, please keep in mind the 
players in this game: Hunter Biden, 
James Biden, Ye Jianming, Gongwen 
Dong, Mervyn Yan, and Patrick Ho, to 
name a few. All of these individuals 
mixed and mingled with related cor-
porate entities over a period of years 
and with respect to millions of dollars. 
Now, the next poster, those connec-
tions are illustrated by this second 
poster which I made public last Novem-
ber. It is an original bank record with 
one typographical error and all. Here

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1797 
March 28, 2022 
you have Hunter Biden, Gongwen Dong, 
and Mervyn Yan executing an assign-
ment and assumption agreement to-
gether. 
Now, a third question to those who 
accuse us of disseminating Russian 
disinformation, so especially to the lib-
eral media who are the ones who ought 
to be policing our government system 
to make sure that everything is done 
honest—they shouldn’t have to have 
Members of Congress giving all this in-
formation out—but is this official 
record Russian disinformation? 
In our next speeches, we will show 
you more records that haven’t been 
seen before, records that undeniably 
show strong links between the Biden 
family and communist China. 
Today is just a small taste. I would 
like to note one thing before Senator 
JOHNSON takes over. He is going to de-
scribe to you the ridiculous attacks 
that we received, claiming that our re-
ports were Russian disinformation. 
On March 16 of this year, the New 
York Times unwittingly substantiated 
our reports by reporting on Hunter 
Biden’s connection to foreign corpora-
tions and his potential criminal expo-
sure. 
So what Senator JOHNSON and I made 
public last Congress is now a prevailing 
fact pattern that even the liberal 
media can’t ignore any longer and 
falsely label ‘‘Russian disinformation.’’ 
I will turn it over to Senator JOHN-
SON to provide additional examples of 
the media’s attack last Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I 
first want to thank the senior Senator 
from the State of Iowa for his tenacity 
in pursuing the truth and ignoring all 
of the false attacks lobbed against us 
during the course of our multiyear in-
vestigations into corruption at the 
highest levels of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Both of us have been firsthand wit-
nesses and at the same time victims of 
the dishonesty of our Democratic Sen-
ate colleagues and their willing accom-
plices in the media. 
When it comes to our investigation 
into the vast web of foreign financial 
entanglements of the Biden family, 
those attacks have had one goal in 
mind, to cover up the extent to which 
President Biden might be and almost 
certainly is compromised. 
Over the course of our investigation 
into how Hunter Biden used his fa-
ther’s position and name to enrich 
himself and his family, the dishonest 
press published countless stories re-
porting on the Democrats’ false charge 
that Senator GRASSLEY and I were so-
liciting 
and 
disseminating 
Russian 
disinformation. 
Once we issued our September and 
November 2020 reports, which were 
based 
almost 
exclusively 
on 
U.S.- 
sourced documents and interviews with 
U.S. citizens, the media largely ignored 
it. When they did write a story, they 
declared that our reports found noth-
ing new, a classic media coverup. 
I have always said the bias in the 
media is revealed far more in what 
they don’t report than what they actu-
ally do report. But all the false attacks 
did not deter us. We have continued to 
uncover the truth and, fortunately, our 
reports also served as a catalyst for 
others to come forward and for more 
investigative 
journalists 
to 
keep 
digging. 
The American people deserve the 
truth. That is why we are presenting 
additional evidence today and over the 
next few days. For example, this is the 
first time this document is being made 
public. As Senator GRASSLEY described 
in detail, it shows that money from 
CEFC, which is effectively an arm of 
the Chinese Government, went directly 
to Hunter Biden. 
Bank records like this piece of evi-
dence are pretty hard to deny and 
sweep under the rug. Our reports were 
chockful of irrefutable evidence like 
this, and yet the media buried those 
details in an attempt to keep it hidden 
from the American people. 
Because the mainstream media and 
our Democratic colleagues had no sub-
stance to refute our reports, they re-
verted to their time-honored tradition 
of lying, making false accusations 
against us, and engaging in the politics 
of personal destruction. 
Again, their goal was to destroy the 
credibility of our reports before the 
American people even had a chance to 
read them. They were fully aware that 
the lie can travel halfway around the 
world before the truth has a chance to 
put on its shoes. For example, listen to 
what New York Times journalist Nich-
olas Fandos said about our report: 
‘‘lack of meaningful new information’’ 
and, again, ‘‘overlap [of the] Russian 
disinformation campaign.’’ 
The then-Democratic minority leader 
was quoted saying about our report, 
‘‘as if Putin wrote it, not United States 
Senators.’’ A Democratic Senator de-
scribed our investigation as being 
‘‘rooted in disinformation’’ from Rus-
sian operatives. 
Separately, a Democratic Senator 
also said about our report: 
Bottom line: the Johnson-Grassley inves-
tigation is baseless. It’s laundering Russian 
propaganda for circulation in the U.S. 
But, of course, all those quotes were 
disinformation, 
disinformation 
de-
signed to distract all of us from the 
truth. As Senator GRASSLEY reiterated, 
our reports were based almost exclu-
sively on government records from the 
Obama administration and transcribed 
interviews of government officials. 
So how did the Democrats and the 
liberal media allies carry out this false 
attack on us? We describe part of what 
they did in section 10 of our September 
2020 report. Their disinformation and 
smear campaign against us in our re-
ports was extensive, but in the interest 
of time, I will give you a shorter Cliff’s 
Notes version. 
On July 13, 2020, then-Minority Lead-
er SCHUMER, Senator WARNER, Speaker 
PELOSI, and Representative SCHIFF sent 
a letter to the FBI to express a pur-
ported belief that Congress was the 
subject of a foreign disinformation 
campaign. The letter included a classi-
fied attachment that had unclassified 
elements that attempted to tie Senator 
GRASSLEY’s and my work to Andriy 
Derkach, a Russian agent. 
The 
Democrats 
speculated 
that, 
based on this unclassified information, 
Senator GRASSLEY and I had received 
materials from Derkach. This was 
false. Nothing could be further from 
the truth, but this information pur-
portedly linking Senator GRASSLEY and 
I to Derkach was leaked to liberal 
media outlets to start a false narrative 
to smear us. 
Until news reports of this false alle-
gation surfaced, I had never even heard 
of Andriy Derkach. We immediately 
and forcefully denied the false allega-
tion, but Democrats and the media 
continued to spread the lie. To this 
day, no one has ever apologized to ei-
ther of us for spreading that lie, even 
though it was proven conclusively to 
be a lie and disinformation. 
Next, my staff and Senator GRASS-
LEY’s staff did a transcribed interview 
with George Kent. During that inter-
view, Democratic staff members intro-
duced Derkach’s materials into our 
record. Then Democratic staff mem-
bers asked Mr. Kent about it. He stat-
ed: 
What you are asking me to interpret is a 
master chart of disinformation and malign 
influence. 
That was Mr. Kent’s evaluation of 
the 
Derkach 
disinformation 
that 
Democrats were spreading that they 
entered into our record. 
So the actual truth of the matter is 
that Democrats—not Senator GRASS-
LEY nor I—introduced known Russian 
disinformation into our investigatory 
record. They did the exact thing they 
were falsely accusing us of doing. 
Again, not my staff, not Senator 
GRASSLEY’s staff, Democrats were dis-
seminating 
Russian 
disinformation 
just like they did with the Steele dos-
sier. Then-Ranking Members WYDEN 
and PETERS
sent me and Senator 
GRASSLEY a letter asking for an intel-
ligence briefing relating to our inves-
tigation. 
Now, such a briefing was completely 
unnecessary, but it was an effort by 
our Democratic colleagues to further 
falsely taint our investigation, hoping 
to discredit it and discredit the truth. 
On July 28, 2020, Senator GRASSLEY 
and I reminded them that the FBI and 
relevant members of the intelligence 
community had already briefed the 
committees in March of 2020 and as-
sured us that there was no reason to 
discontinue our investigation. 
Then, in August 2020, Senator GRASS-
LEY and I were provided a briefing from 
the FBI, a briefing that we did not re-
quest that was also leaked to the press 
to further smear us. 
This unsolicited FBI briefing was 
also not necessary and was completely

S1798 
March 28, 2022 
irrelevant to the substance of our in-
vestigation. 
The FBI briefers did tell us that they 
weren’t there to ‘‘quash, curtail, or 
interfere’’ in our investigation in any 
way. 
No government entity ever warned us 
that our investigation into the Biden 
family’s financial deals was connected 
to any kind of Russian disinformation 
campaign—because it wasn’t. 
But, again, the substance of that FBI 
briefing was later leaked and contorted 
to smear us, which was exactly why we 
suspect we were given the unsolicited 
briefing in the first place. 
Those briefers promised confiden-
tiality. Clearly, that confidentiality 
was breached and resulted in another 
smear operation on Senator GRASSLEY 
and me to deflect allegations of corrup-
tion and conflict of interest that could 
compromise a President Biden. 
To date, we do not know who all was 
involved in this smear campaign, but 
even after repeated requests, Director 
Wray and Director Haines have refused 
to come in and fully explain who re-
quested and directed this briefing and 
why it was provided. 
I think we know why it was provided. 
So to review, senior Democrats and 
liberal media cooperated to smear Sen-
ator GRASSLEY and me with false accu-
sations of receiving and spreading Rus-
sian disinformation. They created doc-
uments, leaked them, asked for brief-
ings, and then leaked those, too, and 
then they themselves disseminated 
Russian disinformation. 
You can’t make this up. 
Fortunately, they failed to discredit 
our investigation because we stayed 
true to government records. We stayed 
true to the facts and the evidence. And 
the evidence is stunning, and it is 
growing. 
Over the next few days, Senator 
GRASSLEY and I will come to the floor 
to present additional evidence that has 
not yet been made public. These 
records show extensive connections be-
tween the Biden family and elements of 
the communist Chinese regime. We are 
talking high-dollar transactions, some 
of which we have already highlighted 
in our September and November 2020 
reports, but our speeches will introduce 
new 
financial 
documents 
into 
the 
record for all to see. 
Now, we expect Democrats and the 
media to continue to use their power to 
smear us and cover up for the Bidens. 
But the truth has a power of its own, 
and we intend to continue to reveal the 
truth. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be able 
to complete my remarks before the 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 4521 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor tonight happy that 
the Senate is going to move forward on 
substituting what is originally the 
Senate-passed Schumer-Young bill on 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act. That is what we are going to be 
voting on and then sending that over to 
the House of Representatives to basi-
cally convey that that is our desire 
here in the Senate and, hopefully, get 
this process of going to conference and 
a response back from the House of Rep-
resentatives so we can move forward on 
reinvigorating America’s supply chain. 
Madam President, I know you know 
how important this is, but the Senate 
bill, again, brought to us by Senators 
SCHUMER and YOUNG, I think, was quite 
prescient on the problems that we were 
going to face as it relates to supply 
chains. But I don’t think that every-
body really understands that the Sen-
ate position is really about the fact 
that we need to have technology trans-
fer happen at a faster rate; that other 
countries, because the United States 
has been such a prolific publisher of in-
formation and content, actually have 
taken that content and information 
and been able to turn it into actual 
commercial applications. 
So in the United States we want to 
do something to create, while still pro-
tecting NSF, the National Science 
Foundation, on basic research and ad-
vanced research and the Department of 
Energy on research, and also work fast-
er at translating the successes of our 
science into true application and trans-
lating that into helping our manufac-
turers here in the United States of 
America. 
This is so important because we 
know that in various sectors of our 
economy, we are seeing much of the 
supply chain controlled in other parts 
of the world. We see that Asia now con-
trols much of the supply chain for 
pharmaceuticals. 
We are having a big debate about how 
we are going to drive down the cost of 
pharmaceuticals. We are going to in-
vest here in the United States, I think, 
in more biotechnology and synthetic 
biology to find new ways to discover 
and make lifesaving drugs, and it is 
very important that we do that re-
search here. 
In the Senate bill, we are very fo-
cused on: In what areas do we want to 
do faster translational science to help 
bring the supply chain back to the 
United States? 
As we talked last week, we see that 
Taiwan makes more than 90 percent of 
the world’s leading-edge chips which 
drive our national security and our 
economic security, and we want to do 
the research here in the United States 
through the acceleration with the Tech 
Directorate to invent the next genera-
tion of chips and build them here do-
mestically. 
And we have heard about the risk of 
Americans falling behind on advanced 
communications, like 5G or 6G, and so 
we have ideas here about how to trans-
late that into faster deployment of 
technology that could help our manu-
facturing base. 
So I am actually very excited about 
all of that innovation because if we all 
work together, we collaborate, we have 
done the R&D, and we actually work 
harder at getting it translated, I think 
there are lots of solutions that we can 
put before our manufacturers here to 
help them with their competitiveness 
on a worldwide basis. 
That is what the Tech Directorate 
does. The Manufacturing USA Insti-
tutes, the technology hubs, and the 
technology centers are all parts of this 
legislation that would help us move 
technology out into the world at a fast-
er pace and work collaboratively to 
solve these problems that, again, would 
bring the manufacturing and the sup-
ply chain back into the United States 
of America. 
I get really excited about the issues 
related to the automobile sector and 
the grid. Coming from a State that has 
had cheap electricity for a long time, it 
has built our economy over and over 
and over again; that is, that people 
want to locate there because the elec-
tricity is so affordable. 
It is one of the reasons why we have 
one of the highest deployments of elec-
tric vehicles in the country, because it 
really only costs you about a dollar a 
gallon to fill up versus the rising, well- 
above $4 a gallon that we are seeing 
today. 
So people are very excited about an 
electricity grid and a supply chain here 
in the United States that would build 
here the battery technology, imple-
ment this faster integration into our 
economy, and get a grid that works 
and enables that kind of electrification 
of the transportation sector. 
I guarantee you the United States 
could be world leaders in the deploy-
ment of this if we get this legislation 
passed and we continue to make invest-
ments in the National Science Founda-
tion and the Tech Directorate. 
Now, I know some of our colleagues 
have been concerned that this somehow 
takes away from the National Science 
Foundation’s focus on basic research. I 
would tell you that it does both. The 
Senate bill that we will be voting on 
does both. It basically continues to in-
vest in the NSF in their traditional 
role and also gets this idea of a Tech 
Directorate 
which 
focuses 
on 
the 
translational science—again, to help us 
get more of the supply chain back in 
the United States. It does both. 
This underlying bill, also, as I said, is 
the Senate version which made the 
same investment in the Department of 
Energy, which was so important be-
cause the Department of Energy plays 
such an important aspect in this. 
It also does something that my col-
league Senator WICKER and I and oth-
ers worked on, which is trying to make 
sure that we are getting more tech-
nology development in a variety of 
places; that is, that we are building on 
STEM and the amount of investment 
in STEM education—the fact that we 
want to have innovation everywhere so 
that opportunity is also anywhere.

And we also make more investments 
in the idea of our EPSCoR Program, 
which is helping areas of the United 
States that may not have as much tech 
investment, to continue to increase the 
investment in their institutions. 
I hope this is something my col-

growing the capacity for us to innovate 
in many different parts of the United 
States and across many different sec-
tors of our economy and with increas-
ing the capacity of women and minori-
ties to also participate in the kinds of 
programs that will help America be 
competitive. 
So I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the underlying Senate bill. Help 
us get it moved forward and to also 
send this over on the second vote to

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). On this vote, the yeas are 
68, the nays are 28. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn having voted in the af-
firmative, the motion is agreed to. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
few minutes, the Senate is going to 
take a final vote on the major bipar-
tisan jobs and competitive legislation. 
As we all know, it has been a long 
road to reach this point. I want to 
thank my Democratic and Republican 
colleagues for working in good faith on 
the bill. Nearly every Member of this 
Chamber has had a hand in shaping 
this legislation. 
There are three important reasons 
for passing the bill. It will create more 
American jobs. It will lower costs for 
American families. It will help ignite 
another generation of American sci-
entific research and innovation. 
After we pass this bill, we will be one 
step closer to initiating a conference 
committee so we can resolve the House 
and Senate bills. I am hopeful we will 
be able to reach a conference com-
mittee before the end of this work pe-
riod. 
I thank all my colleagues for their 
good work on this bill and ask for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture 
having been invoked, the motion to 
commit falls, as inconsistent with clo-
ture; and, under the previous order, the 
remaining amendments are withdrawn, 
amendment No. 5002 is agreed to, the 
cloture motion on the bill is with-
drawn, and the bill, as amended, is con-
sidered read a third time. 
The amendments were withdrawn. 
The amendment (No. 5002) was agreed 
to. 
The cloture motion on the bill (H.R. 
4521) was withdrawn. 
The bill, as amended, was ordered to 
a third reading and was read the third 
time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill, as amended, 
pass? 
The yeas and nays have been re-
quested. 
Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators

REMEMBERING ROBERT JULIANO 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last fall, 
Robert Juliano passed away at the age 
of 80 after a lifetime of fighting on be-
half of the restaurant workers of Amer-
ica. For decades, he shaped and shep-
herded nearly every piece of legislation 
that helped restaurant workers in the 
United States. Along the way, he made 
extraordinary friendships with Mem-
bers of congress of both parties, Capitol 
Police, congressional staff, and many 
of the people who make things work 
around here. Bob was to some Bobby, 
others Cool Bobby J, and even Uncle 
Bobby, but most of all, I, like so many 
others, called him our friend. In April, 
his union that represents 300,000 hotel, 
restaurant, and other service workers 
across the United States—known as 
UNITE HERE—will gather to celebrate 
the man who, even with so many pow-
erful friends, never stopped thinking of 
himself as ‘‘a kid from Taylor Street in 
Chicago.’’ 
Bob was born in the City of Big 
Shoulders—Chicago—on the West Side, 
to Emil and Mary Salvaria Juliano. He 
attended Saint Ignatius College Pre-
paratory, on Roosevelt Road, and Loy-
ola University in Chicago. Both are 
Catholic 
Jesuit 
institutions 
that 
taught him the importance of service 
to one’s community. 
As a young man, he got his start as 
an elevator operator, eventually work-
ing his way up to become the personnel 
manager 
of 
the 
legendary 
Palmer 
House Hilton Hotel in downtown Chi-
cago. Through his work at the Palmer 
House, Bob met labor leaders and union 
members. This included Edward Han-
ley, the leader in Chicago of HERE, 
which later became UNITE HERE, rep-
resenting the workers of the Palmer 
House. In 1973, Hanley became the 
International President of HERE. 
It was around this time that Bob met 
then-Mayor Richard J. Daley through 
then-Chicago Alderman Vito Marzullo. 
These were the days when Mayor Daley 
was a true political force. Mayor Daley 
immediately learned a lesson we all 
have in the decades since. You could 
not help but like Bob. The mayor 
called then-House Majority Leader Tip 
O’Neill and endorsed Bob going to 
Washington, DC. With the support of 
Daley and O’Neill, one of then-Presi-
dent Hanley’s first acts was to name 
Bob as HERE’s first full-time legisla-
tive representative. He had no lobbying 
experience, but Daley told him, ‘‘Go to 
Washington. Everything’s going to be 
fine. You’re in your mother’s arms.’’ 
It was the beginning of four decades 
of Bob’s work on nearly every major 
piece of labor legislation. He was proud 
to help guide the passage of the Black 
Lung Benefits Act of 1972 that ensured 
coal miners had access to the same 
health plan as Federal employees. Bob 
received numerous honors throughout 
his life, and he was especially proud of 
his honoree status with the Sons of 
Italy Foundation. 
Bob was one of a kind; he was friends 
with such different people as Senators 
Bob Dole, Ted Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, 
Sam Brownback, and myself. We dis-
agreed on a lot, but we could always 
agree on Bob. What made Bob special 
was that he knew everyone—everyone 
from the chiefs of staff, to the front 
desk assistants, to the food service 
workers, the Capitol Police, and every-
one in between. Bob cared about them, 
and he was known to talk their ear off 
for an hour from time to time. From 
his days at the Palmer House to his 
days in the Capitol, his hospitality was 
a feature of who he was. Bob directly 
connected 
with 
people. 
He 
never 
learned how to use a computer, but he 
was successful because of how he treat-
ed people. 
The late Cardinal Joseph Bernadin of 
Chicago called Bob his lobbyist. All 
kidding aside, Bob’s love of people is a 
great representation of faith. Bringing 
people from all walks of life together 
with kindness is something we all 
should work toward. 
I will miss the kid from Taylor 
Street in Chicago. They do not make 
them like Bob anymore, and we are 
lesser for it. 
Robert E. Juliano is survived by his 
son, Robert E. Juliano, Jr.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, last week

fornia, to be U.S. District Judge for the 
Southern District of California; yea on

tion on the nomination of Cristina D. 
Silva, of Nevada, to be U.S. District 
Judge for the District of Nevada; yea 
on vote No. 105, on the confirmation on 
the nomination of Anne Rachel Traum, 
of Nevada, to be U.S. District Judge for 
the District of Nevada; yea on vote No. 
106, on the confirmation on the nomi-

nation of Andrew M. Luger, of Min-
nesota, to be U.S. Attorney for the Dis-
trict of Minnesota. 
I am grateful to have only experi-
enced mild symptoms of the virus as a 
result of being fully vaccinated and 
boosted. I encourage anyone who has 
yet to be vaccinated to do so and to get 
boosted if they are eligible.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER SAMANTHA 
FAORO 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we have all 
heard the phrase ‘‘law enforcement 
family.’’ This law enforcement family 
is a diverse family with representatives 
from all walks of life. This family is 
not bound by traditions of race, reli-
gion, color, or sex. This family is all in-
clusive. Today, I want to provide an ex-
ample of this family and how they 
came together to save the life of a fel-
low law enforcement officer. 
On January 28, 2022, Kentucky State 
Police Trooper Michael Sanguini was 
shot multiple times, while conducting 
a traffic stop in Harrison County. Ac-
cording to the preliminary investiga-
tion, he was struck six times, of which 
three shots were stopped by his bal-
listic vest. One shot struck his portable 
radio, and another struck his issued 
taser, with one shot striking his body. 
Although many officers from mul-
tiple agencies responded to assist the 
injured trooper, I want to recognize 
Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Officer 
Samantha Faoro for her quick response 
and 
actions 
of 
assistance. 
Officer 
Samantha Faoro is a native of Colo-
rado, who move to Kentucky to pursue 
her career with the Kentucky Depart-
ment of Fish and Wildlife. She grad-
uated from the police academy in Feb-
ruary 2021 and was assigned to work in 
Harrison County. Officer Faoro comes 
from a family of first responders, con-
tinuing the life of service to protect 
the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Officer Faoro was working in the 
area of Cynthiana, KY, when she heard 
Trooper Sanguini state he had been 
shot. Without hesitation, Officer Faoro 
responded directly to the scene to pro-
vide assistance to a fellow officer in 
need. Upon arrival to the scene, she ob-
served the wounded trooper and quick-
ly transported him to the hospital. 
Trooper 
Sanguini 
quickly 
received 
medical treatment for his gunshot 
wounds because of the quick action of 
Officer Faoro. 
It is my privilege to stand here today 
and recognize another great officer 
such as Officer Samantha Faoro. She

move essential goods and supplies, and there 
was no discernible increase in truck acci-
dents on the Interstate Highway System in 
Colorado; and 
Whereas, Increasing the gross vehicle 
weight for the Interstate Highway System to 
match that of other state highways may re-
sult in fewer trucks, less vehicle miles trav-
eled, and lower emissions of greenhouse 
gases, and this helps the state to meet its 
greenhouse emission rules and comply with 
emission standards of the United States En-
vironmental Protection Agency; and 
Whereas, Governor Polis, the Colorado 
General Assembly, the Colorado Department 
of Transportation, and the Colorado State 
Patrol may be best positioned to determine 
if it is in the best interests of the state to 
harmonize 
the 
maximum 
gross 
vehicle 
weight for the state’s Interstate Highway 
System with other state highways; and 
Whereas, A study performed by the Colo-
rado Department of Transportation consid-
ering safety, environmental, mobility, and 
economic factors is the best way to assess 
the benefits and costs of changing the max-
imum gross vehicle weight for trucks on Col-
orado interstate highways; and 
Whereas, Such a study should engage a 
broad range of stakeholders both from the 
public and private sectors to ensure that all 
perspectives are considered; and 
Whereas, if approved by the United States 
Congress and if the study finds that it is in 
the best interests of the state to raise the 
maximum gross vehicle weight on the Inter-
state Highway System to 85,000 pounds to 
harmonize it with other state highways, the 
state of Colorado, with the approval of the 
General Assembly and the Governor, would 
move forward with a change to state statute: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
the Seventy-third General Assembly of the State 
of Colorado, the Senate concurring herein. That 
the Colorado General Assembly requests: 
(1) That Congress allow the Colorado De-
partment of Transportation to conduct an 
analysis of increasing the gross vehicle 
weight limit for the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem in Colorado to harmonize it with other 
state highways where 85,000 pounds is the 
maximum weight; and 
(2) That if the completed study determines 
that it is in the best interests of Colorado to 
harmonize the weights for the Interstate 
Highway System and other state highways, 
the Colorado General Assembly and the Gov-
ernor be permitted by state statute to in-
crease the gross vehicle weight limit to 
85,000 pounds for vehicles traveling on the 
Interstate Highway System in Colorado, and 
be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolu-
tion be sent to the President of the United 
States, the President Pro Tempore of the 
United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
each member of Colorado’s congressional 
delegation.

support for Ukraine’s freedom, sovereignty,

Foreign Relations. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 3658 
Whereas, Ukraine is a sovereign and inde-
pendent nation located in Eastern Europe 
and an ally, under a bilateral investment 
treaty of the United States; and 
Whereas, Russia, a transcontinental coun-
try spanning Eastern Europe and Northern 
Asia, has launched an all-out invasion of 
Ukraine by land, air, and sea; and 
Whereas, Russian forces have dramatically 
escalated their offenses by deploying a forty- 
mile long convoy of tanks and other military 
equipment advancing south to attack the 
people of Ukraine, including the City of 
Kyiv; and 
Whereas, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is 
the largest invasion of a sovereign nation in 
Europe since World War II; and 
Whereas, the combat is directly respon-
sible for massive civilian casualties, includ-
ing a Russian mortar attack on a children’s 
hospital that inflicted devastating loss of 
life; and 
Whereas, Russia’s attack on Ukraine was 
unprovoked and unjustified; and 
Whereas, as the attack intensifies, the hu-
manitarian crisis could reach unprecedented 
levels, with the United Nations estimating 
that between one million and five million 
people will be in need of urgent health care, 
safety, and security; and 
Whereas, Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy, declared that Russia had ‘‘em-
barked on a path of evil, but [Ukraine] is de-
fending itself and won’t give up its freedom 
. . .’’: Now therefore be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the 
House of Representatives of the One Hundred 
First General Assembly, Second Regular Ses-
sion hereby: 
(1) Proudly stand alongside Ukraine, its 
people, and its leaders during this horrific 
and unnecessary war and vow to support 
Ukraine and hold Russia fully accountable 
for its catastrophic decision to invade; 
(2) Condemn, in the strongest possible 
terms, Vladimir Putin’s violent attack on 
the people of Ukraine and strongly endorse 
the swift and severe economic sanctions and 
stringent export controls that President 
Biden’s administration has imposed on Rus-
sia; 
(3) Urge Russia to immediately cease its 
violent, illegal, and immoral assault upon 
Ukraine, end the needless bloodshed, and re-
turn to diplomacy and the rules-based inter-
national order that has ensured peace and 
prosperity for so many; and 
(4) Recommend to the President of the 
United States and the United States Con-
gress to reaffirm our country’s unwavering 
support for Ukraine’s freedom, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity within its inter-
nationally recognized borders, extending to 
its territorial waters; and be it further 
Resolved, that the United States should 
take prudent and responsible measures to en-
sure that the required force posture is 
present in Europe to deter and, if necessary, 
defeat Russian aggression against any NATO 
member; and be it further 
Resolved, That the United States should 
immediately strengthen additional sanctions

ther

S. RES. 558 
Whereas the United States has a responsi-

mocracy, and human rights across the globe; 
Whereas there are several universal dec-
larations promoting human rights, laws of 
war, and upholding the dignity of individ-
uals; 
Whereas the preamble to the United Na-
tions Charter states that member countries 
‘‘reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights 
[and] in the dignity and worth of the human 
person’’; 
Whereas the preamble of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights states, ‘‘Mem-
ber States have pledged themselves to 
achieve, in cooperation with the United Na-
tions, the promotion of universal respect for 
and observance of human rights and funda-
mental freedoms’’; 
Whereas the Russian Federation, as the 
former Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, 
joined as an original member of the United 
Nations on October 24, 1945, and as such has 
a duty to abide by the conditions of the 
United Nations Charter;

bers of the Security Council of the Russian 
Federation, and President Putin’s military 
commanders have severely undermined the 
international rule of law through their var-
ious actions;

a missile attack on January 24, 2015, in 
Mariupol, Ukraine, that indiscriminately 
targeted civilians, resulting in the death of 
at least 30 people and injuring many more; 
Whereas 
intelligence 
assessments 
have 
concluded Vladimir Putin and his regime 
have destroyed the rule of law in the Russian 
Federation and engaged in countless crimes 
against humanity, including ordering the 
poisoning of Alexi Navalny, the poisoning of 
Sergei and Yulia Skripal, and the false im-
prisonment and torture ultimately leading 
to the death of Sergei Magnitsky; 
Whereas armed forces of the Russian Fed-
eration, under the leadership of President 
Vladimir Putin and the Security Council of 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
initiated 
an 
unprovoked war against Ukraine based on 
false security claims and threats in February 
2022; 
Whereas President Vladimir Putin has al-
legedly committed war crimes in his reckless 
quest to decimate Ukraine and the people of 
Ukraine, including civilians, children, and 
women; 
Whereas the people of the Russian Federa-
tion are suffering economic hardship from 
global sanctions as a direct result of Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin’s erratic, illogical, and 
irrational actions; 
Whereas the United States Government 
seeks the most productive relationship pos-
sible with the people of the Russian Federa-
tion for the sake of their own liberty and 
prosperity; and 
Whereas the United States Government 
should use its voice, vote, and influence to 
pursue war crimes allegations against Vladi-
mir Putin and his military commanders in 
international institutions of which it is a 
member and encourage other allies and part-
ners to do the same: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the economic relationship between the 
United States and the Russian Federation 
should be considered to return to the level of 
that relationship before the invasion of 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation that 
began on February 24, 2022, only when— 
(A) the Armed Forces of the Russian Fed-
eration and proxies of such forces withdraw 
from all territory of Ukraine such forces or 
proxies have occupied since February 24, 
2022, and that withdrawal is verified by a su-
pervision mission of the United Nations in 
Ukraine; 
(B) the Government of the Russian Federa-
tion has ceased engaging in cyberattacks and 
disseminating 
anti-Ukraine, 
pro-Russian 
Federation propaganda and has committed 
to not engaging in such attacks or dissemi-
nating such propaganda in the future; and 
(C) a free and fair election is held in the 
Russian Federation, as determined by the 
Secretary of State; 
(2) as soon as possible after the date of 
agreement to this resolution— 
(A) the President should direct the United 
States Representative to the United Nations 
to use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United States to immediately promote the 
establishment of an international justice 
mechanism for alleged war crimes and other 
alleged crimes of the Russian Federation 
against Ukraine and to prosecute the per-
petrators of such crimes committed during 
the period of conflict in Ukraine; 
(B) in the event that the United Nations is 
unable or unwilling to establish a mecha-
nism described in subparagraph (A), the 
President should convoke and convene the 
world’s democracies for the purposes of es-
tablishing a regional or international justice 
mechanism for crimes described in that sub-
paragraph; 
(C) in working with other countries to es-
tablish such a regional or international jus-
tice mechanism, the United States should as-
sist all partners in that effort to develop ju-
dicial procedures that enable the fair and 
open prosecution of persons accused of perpe-
trating such crimes; 
(D) the United States should encourage, 
support, and collect any and all information 
that can be supplied to a justice mechanism 
described in subparagraph (A) or (B) for use 
as evidence to support the indictment and 
trial of any persons accused of crimes de-
scribed in subparagraph (A), including the 
crime of aggression in Ukraine, as an imme-
diate priority; and 
(E) the United States should urge all other 
interested countries to apprehend and de-
liver into the custody of a justice mechanism 
described in subparagraph (A) or (B) persons 
indicted for crimes described in subpara-
graph (A) and urge all interested countries 
to provide any and all data and information 
pertaining to such crimes to that mecha-
nism; and 
(3) when the economic relationship be-
tween the United States and the Russian 
Federation returns to the level of that rela-
tionship before the invasion of Ukraine by 
the Russian Federation, as described in para-
graph (1)— 
(A) the President should organize and lead 
a presidential summit on Eastern European 
peace and security with the head of the suc-
cessor government of the Russian Federa-
tion, which should include topics such as 
arms control and existing international fora 
such as the Collective Security Treaty Orga-
nization, the European Union, the Organiza-
tion for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope, the Minsk Group, and the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization; 
(B) the Secretary of State should— 
(i) begin a formal, consultative process 
with the United Nations Secretary General 
and all member countries of the United Na-
tions to reimagine the United Nations Secu-
rity Council; and 
(ii) initiate talks with all Western allies 
regarding the reconstruction of Ukraine and 
humanitarian support to those affected by 
the war waged by President Vladimir Putin; 
(C) the Senate should establish a special, 
interdisciplinary commission to make rec-
ommendations for the reimagination of a 
post-war, 
long-term 
collective 
security 
strategy for Europe, which includes consider-
ation of the security concerns of Ukraine, 
the Russian Federation, and other non-trea-
ty partners; and 
(D) the United States Government should 
call on the successor government of the Rus-
sian Federation to release all political pris-
oners held under the authority of the Rus-
sian Federation.

AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO 
MEET 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
one request for committees to meet 
during today’s session of the Senate. 
They have the approval of the Majority 
and Minority Leaders. 
Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 
5(a), of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate, the following committees are au-
thorized to meet during today’s session 
of the Senate: 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY 
The Committee on the Judiciary is 
authorized to meet during the session 
of the Senate on Monday, March 28, 
2022, at 3 p.m., to conduct an executive 
business meeting. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor, again today, to 
stand in solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine. This is the seventh week in a 
row I have come out here to talk about 
the atrocities being committed by Rus-
sia and what more the United States 
and this Congress can do to support 
Ukraine in its fight for survival. 
It has now been more than a month 
since Russia’s assault on our ally 
Ukraine, an independent sovereign de-
mocracy, a democracy that just wants 
to live in peace. 
Earlier today, Russia continued its 
cowardly and brutal bombing attacks 
on civilian targets in Ukraine. Some 
civilians, like those trapped in and sur-
rounding Mariupol, are dying due to a 
lack of access to water and food. 
Russia continues its assault on hu-
manitarian corridors which are de-
signed to allow safe passage for civil-
ians fleeing the conflict and for life-
saving humanitarian aid to come in to 
those who can’t get out. 
You 
may 
recall 
the 
theater 
in 
Mariupol, where people were taking 
refuge in the basement and using it as 
a bomb shelter. The words ‘‘children’’ 
in Russian were emblazed with huge 
letters clear enough to see from the 
sky so that it would not be a target, 
but it was. 
We just learned Friday that roughly 
300 Ukrainian civilians were killed in 
that basement when the theater was 
hit by Russian bombs about a week 
ago—mostly women and children. 
Vladimir Putin’s war has resulted in 
death and destruction not seen in Eu-
rope since World War II. Thousands of 
civilians have been killed. Roughly, 10 
million people have been displaced 
from their homes, and 3.6 million refu-
gees, almost all women and children 
and the elderly, have fled the country 
they love, while men have stayed be-
hind to fight the invaders. 
In my recent visit to the Polish- 
Ukrainian 
border 
with 
three 
col-
leagues, I talked to dozens of refugees. 
Through their tears, they spoke of 
their apartments or houses that were 
destroyed. They spoke about their 
friends or family members who were in-
jured or even killed. They talked about 
the pain of being separated from their 
husbands or fathers or brothers who 
had stayed behind to fight, not know-
ing their fate. 
They pleaded for us to do more—to 
stop the missiles, stop the bombs, and 
they all said they wanted to return to 
their homeland as soon as they pos-
sibly could. 
President Biden is just back from the 
region where he, too, met with refu-
gees, and I am glad he went. He was 
clearly moved by what he saw and 
heard. I thought his speech in Poland 
Saturday was a powerful indictment of 
Russia’s invasion and a strong state-
ment of support for Ukraine, as well as 
a reminder that this battle in Ukraine 
is about the larger issue of freedom and 
democracy 
versus 
tyranny 
and 
authoritarianism.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1807 
March 28, 2022 
Unfortunately, a compelling speech 
was overshadowed by an off-the-cuff re-
mark at the end, saying of Putin that 
‘‘this man cannot stay in power.’’ 
This was read as supporting regime 
change in Russia. There is no question 
in my mind that the world would be a 
better place and a safer place without 
Vladimir Putin as President of Russia, 
but this remark unfortunately played 
into Russia’s propaganda efforts from 
the start, that NATO, Ukraine, and 
NATO support of Ukraine are all 
threats to Russia and attempts to over-
throw the Russian Government. 
None of that is true, of course. All 
Ukraine wants to do is live in peace 
with its neighbor. NATO is a purely de-
fensive pact, not offensive in any re-
spect—simply countries pledging to de-
fend one another from attacks. Regime 
change is neither our policy in this in-
stance or our broader strategic objec-
tive. 
I can imagine that having met with 
the refugees and having heard their 
heartbreaking stories that the Presi-
dent was expressing his frustration. I 
get it. But the President’s words and 
the reaction to them reminds us that 
this is a true national security crisis, 
and in this sensitive moment, it re-
quires the United States to speak with 
clarity and to speak, wherever possible, 
in unity with our allies in NATO and 
beyond. 
Unfortunately, that did not always 
happen on this trip, whether it was the 
President talking about our response 
to the use of chemical weapons, U.S. 
troops who may end up in Ukraine, or 
regime change. 
But tonight I want to focus on an-
other positive aspect of the President’s 
trip that relates to sanctions and offer 
a few ideas of where we go from here. 
With regard to our sanctions on Rus-
sia, I believe there are a number of ad-
ditional steps we can and should take. 
I was glad to hear on March 24 that the 
Treasury Department issued sanctions 
against dozens of defense companies, 
328 members of the duma legislative 
body, 
and 
the 
chief 
executive 
of 
SberBank. Gold-related transactions 
involving Russia may be sanctionable 
by U.S. authorities, the Treasury De-
partment has also said in a statement. 
We should do that. 
But we should also expand full block-
ing sanctions to all Russian banks, re-
voking international tax and trade 
agreements that give Russia privileges 
not appropriate for a pariah country; 
seizing, not just freezing, assets from 
Kremlin supporters; keeping oligarchs 
from laundering money through expen-
sive art and more. 
I have introduced legislation on some 
of these ideas. I have advocated for all 
of them here on the floor of the Senate 
and elsewhere, and I will continue to 
do so, but tonight I want to focus on 
what I think is the single most impor-
tant sanction, the one that could make 
the biggest difference. 
Our top priority should be cutting off 
Russia’s No. 1 source of income that 
fuels the war machine, and that is re-
ceipts from energy. Energy is, by far, 
Russia’s biggest export. It accounts for 
roughly half of Russia’s entire Federal 
budget. Over the past year, the average 
oil revenues going back to Russia from 
their exports to the United States 
alone was about $50 million a day. 
Under pressure from Congress, the 
administration changed its view and 
chose to block Russian oil, natural gas, 
and coal imports. And that is good. It 
made no sense for to us to help fund 
the Russian war effort, especially when 
we have our own natural resources here 
in North America that we can gain ac-
cess to and actually do so in a way that 
is better for the environment than Rus-
sian oil, that is produced in a way that 
emits more methane and CO2, and, of 
course, has to be shipped by sea to our 
shores, causing more emissions. 
I recognize that sanctioning Russian 
energy is far more difficult for some of 
our allies in Europe which are far more 
dependent on Russian energy than we 
were. But the same argument applies. 
We can’t be funding this brutal war. 
I welcomed the announcement during 
the President’s trip on the creation of 
a joint United States-European Union 
task force to help reduce Europe’s de-
pendence 
on 
Russian 
energy 
and 
strengthen Europe’s energy security. 
Specifically, this initiative will help 
provide at least 15 billion cubic meters, 
bcm, of LNG exports from the United 
States, liquefied natural gas, this year, 
with the goal of shipping 50 bcm of U.S. 
LNG to Europe annually through at 
least 2030. 
This is a very positive step forward 
because it is telling the Europeans you 
can cut your dependency on Russia and 
stop spending money that goes into the 
war machine and we will back you up. 
The United States has plenty of nat-
ural gas; it is produced in a cleaner 
way, by the way; and we are happy to 
back you up. 
This agreement is not a silver bullet, 
but it is a step in the right direction. It 
is smart to support our domestic en-
ergy producers as a means of sup-
porting our national and our economic 
security but also as a way to support 
our allies in Europe. 
And in light of this Russian invasion, 
the importance of the United States 
having a robust, ‘‘all of the above’’ ap-
proach to power our Nation, which in-
cludes fossil fuels, renewable energies, 
carbon capture technologies, nuclear 
power, hydrogen, that cannot be over-
stated. 
For context, Europe imported ap-
proximately 155 bcm of gas from Russia 
in 2021 and approximately 22 bcm from 
the United States through LNG. So 50 
bcm from the United States on top of 
that will lead to a significant increase 
in U.S. LNG exports and really help 
Europe. 
But if this is to work, the adminis-
tration is going to have to follow 
through on these commitments to help 
get more hydrocarbons on the global 
market to consumers in Europe. 
If the price is higher in Europe, as 
predicted, some of the LNG supply will 
go to Europe instead of Asia, and that 
will help. That will be based on market 
forces, but in order to ensure that we 
meet this increased supply to Europe, 
we have to increase our production 
here at home and develop the associ-
ated infrastructure, such as pipelines 
and terminals, to get that natural gas 
to market. 
Unfortunately, we aren’t off to a 
great start. The President’s tax pro-
posals released with their fiscal year 
2023 budget request to Congress elimi-
nates important tax provisions used by 
our domestic producers, like the deduc-
tion for intangible drilling costs, or 
IDCs, which allows natural gas and oil 
producers to deduct costs that are nec-
essary for the drilling and preparation 
of wells. 
This includes things like wages, fuel, 
survey work. Taxpayers get to deduct 
their cost of doing business. IDCs are 
one such cost for energy companies, 
and shortsighted proposals like those 
in the budget would only serve to dis-
courage domestic energy production at 
a time when we need it. 
On Friday, I spoke at a natural gas 
seminar in Ohio and met with energy 
producers that are working in the 
Marcellus and the Utica shale in Ohio. 
We are now a major gas-producing 
State, thanks to those Utica and 
Marcellus shale finds, and the pro-
ducers in Ohio had a lot of thoughts 
about what was going on that day in 
Europe. 
They were glad about the agreement 
between the EU and the United States, 
but they drove home to me the key 
point that we have energy here in the 
ground, but the current administra-
tion’s policies have made it very dif-
ficult to get that product to market, 
both domestically and internationally. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has consistently sent a message to 
these producers and others that one of 
their goals is to phase out the use of 
fossil fuels altogether. This rhetoric, 
combined with actions like canceling 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, suspending 
new 
leases 
on 
Federal 
lands 
and 
waters, redefining waters of the United 
States, or WOTUS, which makes it 
harder to permit energy projects, has 
led to a lot of uncertainty within the 
oil and gas industry, which has a 
chilling effect on domestic energy pro-
duction—again, at a time when we need 
it. We need ‘‘all of the above.’’ 
In light of this new LNG initiative 
with the European Union, the Biden 
administration’s 
actions 
must 
now 
meet its commitments. An important 
part of building out our domestic en-
ergy infrastructure for gas, renewables, 
and everything in between is stream-
lining the Federal permitting process, 
whether it is a wind power project, 
solar power project, or a natural gas 
project. Historically, it can take a dec-
ade or more for the Federal Govern-
ment to issue permits to build pipe-
lines and other necessary infrastruc-
ture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1808 
March 28, 2022 
I coauthored a law called FAST–41, 
which improves the permitting process 
for these big projects by requiring 
Agencies to work together to set out a 
plan and a timeline for permitting 
projects. 
It also created the Federal Permit-
ting Improvement Steering Council, 
which can help resolve disputes over 
the permitting process and get a green 
light on a project much more quickly. 
FAST–41 has worked. It has helped 
projects save billions of dollars and 
years of time, all while upholding envi-
ronmental standards. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill ex-
panded the Council’s authorities and 
made it permanent, and the recent fis-
cal year 2022 government funding bill 
included $10 million for the Council to 
help support its operations. I urge the 
Biden 
administration 
to 
use 
this 
FAST–41 process to reduce bureau-
cratic redtape in permitting these 
projects so we can deliver the liquefied 
natural gas to Europe, as we promised, 
in a timely fashion so that we can 
begin to reduce their dependency on 
Russian oil and stop sending billions of 
dollars to fund the Russian war ma-
chine. 
This is where energy security and na-
tional security come together. We need 
to lead our European allies in doing all 
we can to sanction Russian’s energy 
sector. 
We have talked a lot about cutting 
off the natural gas and the revenue 
that fuels the war machine in Russia, 
but we also need to tighten up these 
bank sanctions as they relate to en-
ergy. As an example, it is simply unac-
ceptable that sanctions against Rus-
sia’s biggest banks, including VTB 
Bank, do not apply to energy trans-
actions until June 24. This is simply 
too late. We need to act much more 
quickly. 
While President Biden was in Poland, 
inside Ukraine, Russian missiles were 
striking cities all across the country, 
including the western city of Lviv, not 
very far from the Polish border. 
President Biden must lead the alli-
ance to redouble their efforts to stop 
this madness to ensure Russia is not 
rewarded for its war crimes. It is one 
thing to keep the alliance together; it 
is another to lead the alliance out of 
its comfort zone to a more aggressive 
stance to actually win this war. 
So in addition to the energy and 
other sanctions we have discussed to-
night, what more can we and our allies 
do to help Ukraine win this war? And 
note I say ‘‘win this war’’ because if we 
act swiftly, I think we can help 
Ukraine actually win and keep Ukraine 
as a viable democracy and save thou-
sands of lives. But they need our help, 
especially to stop the missiles and ar-
tillery that are raining down on civil-
ians every day and every night. As we 
talk here tonight, this is happening in 
Ukraine. 
The Ukrainians have made it very 
clear they desperately need more air 
defense. President Zelenskyy talked 
about it again in the last 24 hours. 
Based on the news media reports, the 
United States is providing some SA–8s, 
an older, Soviet-era defense system, to 
Ukraine. I was glad to hear that. How-
ever, the media reports also say that 
the more capable S–300 Soviet-era sys-
tems we have in our inventory are not 
being sent. If this is true, this is a big 
disappointment and shows a lack of ur-
gency. 
While I commend the President for 
the strong speech he delivered over the 
weekend, the actions of the adminis-
tration have to match that rhetoric. 
There are additional weapons that they 
are desperately needing that we are not 
yet providing, particularly these anti- 
air systems and more munitions for 
their own anti-air systems. Often it is 
a matter of us facilitating the transfer 
of these weapons from former Warsaw 
Pact countries that are all along the 
border—the Eastern European, Central 
European countries that are close to 
Ukraine and can provide these incred-
ibly important military anti-air sys-
tems, but we need to help them. We 
need to facilitate that and backfill 
their needs at home. 
They have asked for our help across 
the board, but specifically for tanks, 
for anti-ship systems, which is really 
important right now because so many 
of these missiles are coming from these 
ships in the Black Sea. 
President Zelenskyy needs to be lis-
tened to. He knows what they need. He 
says: We need more, and we need it 
more quickly. 
We must also keep sending Stinger 
missiles, which are effective at shoot-
ing 
down 
Russian 
helicopters 
and 
planes at lower altitudes. 
We must find ways to quickly provide 
Ukraine with more armed drones, such 
as the Turkish TB2s and one-use loi-
tering munitions, which the Ukrain-
ians know how to use and have been 
very effective on the battlefield with. 
Two weeks ago, it was announced 
that we were sending 100 so-called 
Switchblade loitering munitions. One 
hundred will go very quickly. We need 
to send more, and we need to send 
them quickly. 
To our Israeli friends, I would ask 
them to sell to us or other countries, 
and we should agree to buy, their 
Harop drones, which Ukraine could 
really use right now. The bottom line 
is we need to flood the zone when it 
comes to providing Ukraine with mili-
tary assistance. 
They are not asking us to fight for 
them, but they are asking for the tools 
to be able to defend themselves, par-
ticularly with regard to this endless 
bombing. And they have a chance to 
win if we do that. There should be no 
gaps in our weapons transfers. We need 
to lead the NATO allies and others 
when it comes to providing and coordi-
nating support. 
There are loopholes in the sanctions 
we talked about tonight. We need to do 
more to ensure that those are closed. 
We need to do more to ensure that the 
weapons are being received. 
We should act fast to let the people 
of Ukraine know with certainty that 
we do stand with them. The popular 
Ukrainian national rallying cry ‘‘Slava 
Ukraini’’ when translated into English 
is ‘‘Glory to Ukraine.’’ The response to 
it is ‘‘Glory to the Heroes,’’ ‘‘Heroyam 
Slava.’’ 
In the midst of this atrocity, there 
are so many heroes, and we need to 
back them up. There are so many he-
roes to glorify in Ukraine: the soldiers, 
professionals, and civilians who have 
taken up arms; the doctors and the 
nurses and the firefighters; and the vol-
unteers providing food and water and 
blankets. We pray for them all, and we 
pray for their families. Godspeed to 
them in their simple quest, a battle for 
a free and independent Ukraine, a 
country that can chart its own course. 
America needs to stand with the peo-
ple of Ukraine. We must show the 
world, both our adversaries and our al-
lies, that we stand with Ukraine. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF LISA DENELL COOK 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
a few moments I will file a discharge 
petition to move forward on the nomi-
nation of Lisa DeNell Cook to serve on 
the Federal Reserve Board of Gov-
ernors. 
Not very long ago, a nominee like 
Ms. Cook would have sailed toward 
final confirmation. She serves on the 
advisory board of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Chicago. She is a professor of 
economics at Michigan State and has 
served on the White House Council of 
Economic Advisers. She would also be 
the first Black woman to sit on the 
Federal Reserve Board of Governors. 
Sadly, every single Republican in the 
committee voted in lockstep against 
Ms. Cook—that was in the Banking 
Committee—providing no good expla-
nation for obstructing this qualified 
and historic nominee. 
Nonetheless, the step I am taking 
now will make sure Ms. Cook’s nomina-
tion will move forward, setting up a 
vote as soon as tomorrow.

IN RECOGNITION OF KATHERINE 
FLEMING 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my former legislative assistant, Kath-
erine Fleming. 
Katherine served Kentucky’s Second District 
in my Washington, D.C. office for over five 
years. After interning in my office in 2013 as 
a student at Furman University, she joined my 
office full-time in 2016. Katherine advised me 
on issues ranging from financial services to 
transportation, as well as my work for the 
House Education and Labor Committee and 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
A native of Louisville, Kentucky, Katherine is 
a dedicated public servant, who cares deeply 
about helping the Commonwealth. I thank 
Katherine for her service to the Second Dis-
trict and wish her the best in this next chapter 
of her career.

RECOGNIZING MICHAEL J. ‘‘MIKE’’ 
MCGREVEY’S 
DEDICATION 
AND 
SERVICE 
TO 
MISSISSIPPI 
AND 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMER-
ICA 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, it is my privi-
lege to recognize Mr. Mike McGrevey for his 
outstanding service to the people of Mis-
sissippi and the United States of America. He 
has committed himself to the service of his fel-
low man through a long and distinguished ca-
reer, and I rise today to recognize him as a 
dedicated American leader whose example 
will inspire many who wish to make the world 
around them a better place for their neighbors, 
friends, and family. 
Most recently, Mr. McGrevey served as 
Deputy Director and Chief Financial Officer of 
the Mississippi Development Authority, but he 
also served in senior leadership positions in 
the academic, public, and private sectors as 
well as in the military. 
He served as Chief of Staff, Chief Financial 
Officer, and Vice President of Finance and Ad-
ministration at Mississippi State University, 
where, under his leadership, the university re-
ceived high accolades for research and was 
praised as a top university for military and vet-
erans. In his tenure, Mississippi State Univer-
sity was designated as one of ‘‘America’s Best 
College Buys.’’ 
Mr. McGrevey also served as President of 
The Montgomery Institute, where he led an ef-
fort to create a network for public and private 
entities that promoted entrepreneurial activities 
and workforce development systems across 
36 counties and 8 community college districts. 
As President and Chief Operations Officer 
of a Mississippi-based education company, 
Mr. McGrevey led a team of over 200 edu-
cation professionals to improve student per-
formance in over 400 schools throughout 12 
states. 
Mr. McGrevey also served our nation for 20 
years in the United States Air Force with 
honor and distinction. His military career in-
cluded tours in Washington, D.C., at the Pen-
tagon and on Capitol Hill, as well as in Eu-
rope, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. 
It is my honor to recognize Mr. Mike 
McGrevey in the House of Representatives for 
the many contributions he has made to create 
a brighter future for our state and our Nation, 
and I ask my colleagues in the House to join 
me in thanking Mr. McGrevey for his service 
and commitment to Mississippi and to the 
United States of America.

ROSS 
REYNOLDS, GUNNERY SERGEANT 
JAMES SPEEDY AND CORPORAL 
JACOB MOORE, UNITED STATES 
MARINE CORPS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in great sorrow. On 
March 
18, 
2022, 
Captain 
Matthew 
Tomkiewicz, Captain Ross Reynolds, Gunnery 
Sergeant James Speedy and Corporal Jacob 
Moore were killed as a result of a training ac-
cident in northern Norway under stormy condi-
tions north of the Arctic Circle. 
All four marines were participating in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) 
exercise, Cold Response 2022, when their 
MV–22B Osprey tragically crashed. These four 
brave Marines were assigned to Marine Me-
dium Tiltrotor Squadron 261 (VMM–261) at 
Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River 
in Jacksonville, North Carolina. 
Losing four brave, dedicated service mem-
bers is heartbreaking and our prayers are with 
the families of these fallen heroes. Their duty 
and commitment to our great country will 
never be forgotten and I am forever grateful 
for all that they accomplished and for their 
service to our beloved country. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in re-
membering these great American patriots and 
recognizing all the sacrifices that they made 
for our beloved country. 
TRIBUTE TO MRS. CLEO JACKSON 
WILLIAMS 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a mother, grandmother, 
homemaker, dedicated church goer, and long-
time resident of South Carolina. On Saturday, 
April 2nd family and friends of Mrs. Cleo Jack-
son Williams, will gather to celebrate her 
100th birthday. Mrs. Jackson Williams was 
born on April 5, 1922 in the Centreville Com-
munity of Hartsville, to Mr. and Mrs. Boykin 
Jackson, Sr. 
A jewel in the Hartsville community for near-
ly a Century, Mrs. Williams graduated from 
Hartsville Butler High School. She later mar-
ried the late Hercules Williams, with whom she 
shared three children: Carolyn, Ted, and 
Doris. Although Mrs. Williams was unable to 
attend college, she recognized the importance 
of education. She made every effort to set her 
children on a path towards higher education, 
providing opportunities for Carolyn to study 
nursing, Ted to obtain a degree from Morris 
College in Sumter, South Carolina, and Doris 
to receive her degree from Claflin University in 
Orangeburg, South Carolina. 
Mrs. Williams has always been the consum-
mate homemaker. She took care of the chil-
dren, prepared meals for the family and 
worked in her garden as her husband oper-
ated a farm. A woman with a benevolent 
heart, she would make sure that the people 
who worked on her husband’s farm, located 
three miles outside of Hartsville at Lees 
Crossroads, were well fed. 
Mrs. Williams showed true strength and re-
silience when her husband’s health began to 
fail, and he could no longer oversee the farm. 
She went to work at the Fifth Street Dry 
Cleaners and was later employed at Legg’s 
Hosiery Corporation from which she retired 
after 20 years of dedicated service. 
Mrs. Williams is a woman of great faith, and 
the church plays an important part in her life. 
As a child, the entire Jackson family attended 
Centerville AME Church. After her marriage, 
she became a member of Kingsville United 
Methodist Church where she served on sev-
eral ministries. She lives by the golden rule as 
Luke 6:31 instructs us, ‘‘Do unto others as you 
would have them do to you.’’ 
Mrs. Williams is known by family and friends 
for her delicious sweet potato pies; and is af-
fectionately known as ‘‘Mrs. Cleo,’’ ‘‘Aunt 
Cleo,’’ ‘‘Grandma Cleo,’’ and ‘‘Mother.’’ She 
has five grandchildren and seven great grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in wishing centenarian Mrs. 
Cleo Jackson Williams a heartfelt happy birth-
day. She has led a life of being an inspiration 
to her family and friends while serving many 
others in her community. I extend sincere con-
gratulations on reaching this significant mile-
stone and offer best wishes for many more 
happy and healthy days.

HONORING BRUCE DAGGY 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a fellow Hoosier, Mr. Bruce Daggy, who 
will be retiring after a four-decade career with 
the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. 
After graduating from Indiana University in 
1981 with a degree in recreational program-
ming and leadership, Bruce became an invalu-
able member of the community by leading the 
Boys & Girls club in Wayne County. 
Bruce has been a true public servant lead-
ing the Wayne County Boys & Girls Club to 
greatness. Under his leadership, the Wayne 
County Boys & Girls Club received the Merit 
Award for Best Overall Programs in 2010 and 
2019. 
The youth of Wayne County are better off 
for having such a dedicated public Servant. I 
congratulate Bruce on a wonderful career.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DISTIN-
GUISHED VETERAN, LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL 
CHARLES 
EDWARD 
DRAKE, SR. 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Life of Lieutenant Colonel 
Charles Edward Drake, Sr. who selflessly 
served the United States Army for 26 years. 
Lt. Col. Drake was born in DeFuniak 
Springs, Florida, on January 26, 1930. In 
1948, Lt. Col. Drake attended Florida State 
University where he met his wife, Anne. After 
graduation, the couple were schoolteachers in 
Panama City, Florida. Lt. Col. Drake was 
drafted to the Army in 1951. He served for 
twenty-six years as an officer in the Corp of 
Engineers, a fixed and rotary wing master avi-
ator, and an instructor pilot. His service in-
cluded a tour in Korea and two tours in Viet-
nam. For his achievements and service, Lt. 
Col. Drake was awarded the Bronze Star, with 
a V for Valor and an Oak Leaf Cluster, the Air 
Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished 
Flying Cross, and the Army Commendation 
Medal. 
Lt. Col. Drake retired from the Army in 
1975, but his dedication to service and his 
country was far from over. Upon retiring in 
Greenwood, South Carolina, Lt. Col. Drake 
served as the head of the business depart-
ment at Piedmont Technical College, opened 
a life insurance company, and was active in 
several community and church organizations. 
Lt. Col. Drake also spent many hours men-
toring aspiring pilots and officers. It is difficult 
to put into words how impactful Lt. Col. Drake 
was, but I am reminded of 1 Peter 4:10: ‘‘Each 
one of you should use whatever gift he has re-
ceived to serve others, faithfully administering 
God’s grace in its various forms.’’ 
In 2011, I had the privilege of escorting the 
Drake family on a private tour of the Smithso-
nian National Air and Space Museum where 
we viewed a Huey Helicopter that Lt. Col. 
Drake flew during the war in Vietnam. Seeing 
this helicopter displayed reminds me of the 
bravery Lt. Col. Drake and many others had in 
serving our great nation. I am continually in-
spired by the selflessness and dedication Lt. 
Col. Drake demonstrated not only in his serv-
ice to our country but his service to the com-
munity in Greenwood. 
Lt. Col. Drake passed away on November 
25, 2020 and will soon be interred at Arlington 
National Cemetery with thousands of other 
American heroes. His legacy will live on in his 
children, grandchildren, and great grand-
children as well as the countless lives he 
touched in his community. Lt. Col. Drake’s ex-
ample of sacrifice and dedication to country 
and community is something we should all 
strive to attain. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to honor our veterans, like Lt. Col. Drake, 
who have dedicated their lives to the safety 
and prosperity of the United States. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his family and 
friends during this time.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF PAUL 
CAIRNEY 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tremendous contributions of 
outgoing 
Argyle 
ISD 
Police 
Chief 
Paul 
Cairney, who has served with the school dis-
trict since October 2014. He was named Po-
lice Chief in May 2015. Under his capable di-
rection, the stated mission of the AISD Police 
Department to protect and serve Eagle stu-
dents, staff and the community has been ful-
filled as Chief Cairney and his staff have pro-
vided a safe educational environment for stu-
dents and staff. 
Chief Cairney is a 1992 graduate of the 
U.S. Air Force Academy and holds masters 
degrees from Liberty University in Religious 
Studies and from Colorado State University 
Global in Criminal Justice. In addition, he at-
tained a PhD in Leadership from Louisiana 
Baptist University and Theological Seminary. 
After two decades serving in the U.S. Air 
Force, Chief Cairney retired as a Lieutenant 
Colonel. During his extensive military service 
overseeing security forces at more than ten 
Air Force bases in both the United States and 
abroad in the United Kingdom, Turkey, Ger-
many, and Iraq, he served in multiple leader-
ship positions in law enforcement and emer-
gency preparedness. 
His last duty assignment was as Com-
mander/Police Chief of a 400-plus police force 
which included U.S. military members and 
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and United 
Kingdom Ministry of Defense civilians. He 
worked closely with DoD schools to improve 
classroom safety and was instrumental in de-
veloping training for active shooter scenarios 
on DoD school campuses. 
Within Argyle ISD, Chief Cairney has devel-
oped a robust and proactive security program 
that has garnered positive national attention. 
The AISD Police Department engaged in cru-
cial partnerships with local police and fire de-
partments to force multiply the district’s ability 
to prepare and respond to emergency haz-
ards, both natural and man-made. To prepare 
staff, they have hosted large active shooter 
training exercises and deployed updated com-
munications technology across all campuses. 
This has afforded the district the capability to 
identify concerns and address potential prob-
lem situations as well as alert staff to rapidly 
respond to crisis events and emergencies. 
In addition to his military and law enforce-
ment career, Chief Cairney is to be com-
mended for the philanthropic contributions of 
time, talents, and funding as he and his wife, 
Lynn, established Thor and Athena’s Promise 
Sanctuary. Through this effort they have res-
cued many neglected and abused horses and 
brought them to their ranch to provide rehabili-
tation and a safe refuge. Chief Cairney also 
honorably served as a member of my Service 
Academy Advisory Board. 
I am pleased to join the students, families, 
staff and administration of Argyle ISD in salut-
ing Chief Cairney’s exemplary tenure and pub-
lic service to the school district and commu-
nity. We wish him all the best as he moves to 
Colorado to take another law enforcement po-
sition.

RECOGNIZING DR. RICHARD WOOD-
RUFF, CITY MANAGER OF JACK-
SONVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of a devoted 
public servant in our community who will retire 
this upcoming May, Dr. Richard Woodruff of 
Jacksonville, North Carolina. A selfless and 
dedicated administrator and City Manager, Dr. 
Woodruff has been in the service of others for 
over 27 years. 
With over 50,000 marines and sailors sta-
tioned at Camp Lejeune and New River Air 
Station, Jacksonville is truly the home of the 
Marines. Jacksonville strives to provide quality 
services and a safe environment in which the 
marines, sailors and their families can live a 
peaceful life and work in recognition of their 
dignity. The services of the city provide sup-
port to the military families as their loved ones 
are deployed. 
Operating under the Council Manager form 
of City government, the City Manager is ap-
pointed by the Mayor and City Council and is 
the chief administrative officer of the city. 
Working with a team of professional depart-
ment directors, the City Manager is respon-
sible for the daily operations of city govern-
ment, the preparation of the annual budget 
and the hiring and, when necessary, the re-
moval of city employees. Jacksonville is a full- 
service city, with an annual operating and cap-
ital budget of approximately $100 million in-
cluding general government services. Man-
aging the City of Jacksonville is no easy task 
and Dr. Woodruff has shown exemplary lead-
ership ability in his role as City Manager. 
After a 27-year career in public and private 
sector employment, Dr. Woodruff accepted the 
position of City Manager for the City of Jack-
sonville in 2010. Working with the Mayor and 
Council, the City Manager is leading a major 
renaissance in the historic downtown area of 
Jacksonville, including a new multi-purpose

ment of the ‘‘Freedom Fountain’’ located adja-

Dr. Woodruff is a graduate of Wofford Col-
lege in Spartanburg, South Carolina and 
earned a master’s degree and Doctorate in 
Public Administration from Nova University in 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He and his wife 
Gwendolyn have three sons and six grand-
children. He served on Governor Perdue’s 
Military Land Compatibility Task Force, which 
identified methods of land use to help protect 
the training mission of the military bases 
throughout North Carolina.

the retirement of this incredible and noble man 
and wishing Dr. Woodruff a happy retirement 
from his life of public service.

IN MEMORY OF MS. LINDA BAILEY 
JOHNSON 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of the extraordinary life of 
Ms. Linda Bailey Johnson who peacefully 
passed away on August 30, 2020. Linda was 
an incredible friend, spouse, mother, and men-
tor to many and is greatly missed. 
It was an honor to have spent many years 
learning from Ms. Johnson. Linda was known 
as a strong, compassionate, and loving soul 
with an infectious laugh, characteristics that so 
many fondly recall. Those of us who were for-
tunate enough to spend time with Linda know 
that she was full of life and joy, an endearing 
persona that she maintained through the end 
of her life. Her quick wit and wisdom made a 
profound impact on me and all those around 
her, showing each person in her life that she 
truly cared. 
The example that Linda set is imprinted on 
those who survive her, continuing to inspire 
others to live a life of kindness and connec-
tion. This legacy continues through her de-
voted husband, Carl Eugene Johnson, and be-
loved daughters, Elizabeth Bailey Johnson 
and Jessica Reid Dunevant (Robert). Linda 
would have also been proud of her new 
grandchild, Lillia Elizabeth Dunevant, who 
joined the family since her passing, and would 
have mastered the role of grandmother. In ad-
dition to her family, Ms. Johnson will be fondly 
remembered and genuinely missed by the 
many friends and community members who 
knew her and were touched by her warm de-
meanor. 
Madam Speaker, the scope of Ms. Linda 
Bailey Johnson’s impact on her expansive 
community is endless, and we are fortunate to 
live in a world that was made better by her 
positive influences. Please join me in remem-
bering the life of Ms. Linda Bailey Johnson 
and her many contributions. 
SHERMAN RIOT OF 1930: AN IMPOR-
TANT 
EVENT 
THAT 
CHANGED 
AMERICA 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in solemn remembrance of the 
Sherman Riot of 1930. Many may be unfa-
miliar with the Sherman Riot, as it is all too 
often overlooked in the teaching of Texas his-
tory. 
The violence began at the Grayson County 
Courthouse in Sherman, Texas on May 9, 
1930 and spread throughout the town, dev-
astating the Black community. The riot began 
in response to the trial of George Hughes, a 
Black farm laborer, accused of allegedly as-
saulting his white employer’s wife. In the mid-
dle of Hughes’ trial, a white mob gathered and 
attempted to take over the county courthouse. 
The crowd eventually made its way into the 
courtroom, forcing law enforcement to relocate 
Hughes to a vault in order to protect him from 
the mob. However, protesters set the court-
house on fire and, despite efforts to rescue 
Hughes, it burned to the ground with Hughes 
still inside. After the fire was put out, Hughes’ 
corpse was pulled from the rubble and 
dragged by automobile to the center of Sher-
man’s Black business district where it was mu-
tilated, then hanged from a tree, and a fire 
was subsequently set beneath it. The rioting 
continued and culminated in the burning and 
looting of many Black-owned businesses. The 
Sherman Black community was terrorized by 
angry white mobs. The National Guard was 
deployed and ultimately martial law was de-
clared by the Texas Governor. Among those 
victimized included noted civil rights lawyer 
William J. Durham, whose office was de-
stroyed. Despite the attack, Durham would go 
on to work with Thurgood Marshall on the 
cases that led to the integration of the Univer-
sity of Texas School of Law and the end of 
white primaries in the State of Texas, and ulti-
mately throughout our Nation. 
In February of 2022, the Texas Historical 
Commission approved plans to place a State 
of Texas Historical Marker on the grounds of 
the current Grayson County Courthouse to fi-
nally commemorate the riot, with an expected 
unveiling date of May 9, 2023. 
Madam Speaker, tragically the lynching of 
George Hughes was only one of many inci-
dents like these that occurred in Texas and 
throughout the South during the Great Depres-
sion era. Now, nearly 92 years later, the fight 
for equality continues. Today, we remember 
and reflect upon the heinous violence of the 
Sherman Riot. Americans everywhere must 
remain vigilant in our efforts to combat racism 
and hatred everywhere it may occur.

HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF 
THE IDAHO CLEANUP PROJECT 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, the Cold 
War began in 1947 with the Truman Doctrine 
and ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union. Who can forget the momentous 
sights and sounds of East Germans defiantly 
climbing the Berlin Wall in 1989 and then 
knocking down sections of that very wall as a 
statement that they would no longer be held 
captive by their Communist leaders? 
Through the leadership of Presidents Ron-
ald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, 
the United States won the Cold War. Our 
great nation did so through our military 
strength and by showing the world what is 
possible in a free nation of free people. 
Although not officially part of the weapons 
complex, the Idaho National Laboratory in my 
district in eastern Idaho, reprocessed spent 
nuclear fuel to recover unused uranium. That 
uranium was then refabricated into nuclear 
fuel rods and used in production reactors near 
the east coast. 
Also during the Cold War, the INL became 
the Nation’s repository for nuclear weapons 
waste. Thousands of truckloads of plutonium- 
contaminated wastes were sent to the INL 
from the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, the 
Mound Site in Ohio, and other waste genera-
tors throughout the country. During the 1950s 
and 1960s, the waste was disposed of in an 
unlined landfill in the southcentral portion of 
the INL. That landfill also sits 585 feet above 
the Snake River Plain Aquifer, the second- 
largest continuous aquifer in the U.S. that is 
relied upon by farmers and municipalities 
throughout eastern Idaho. More than 130,000 
people in my district get their water exclusively 
from that aquifer. 
Over the years, barrels and boxes of waste 
deteriorated, leaching their contents into the 
surrounding soil. Rain and snowmelt then 
moved those contaminants toward the under-
lying aquifer. 
Former Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus recog-
nized this impending environmental threat and 
put pressure on the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion to remove the buried waste from the 
landfill and ultimately the state of Idaho. Up 
until 1979, thousands of drums and boxes of 
material were removed. Then, as priorities 
changed, waste removal stopped. Subsequent 
Idaho governors kept pressure on the AEC 
and then its predecessor agency the Depart-
ment of Energy. 
Several agreements were signed by the 
state of Idaho and the DOE, but a lawsuit over 
the word ‘‘all’’ stalled further progress. 
Luckily, science won out over politics. An 
environmental investigation that lasted more 
than a decade determined it was safer and 
more cost effective to remove only the worst 
of the radioactive and hazardous wastes rath-
er than all. The DOE, state of Idaho, and Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency all agreed. This 
proposed 
cleanup 
approach 
was 
dem-
onstrated and proven by the Accelerated Re-
trieval Project, which used highly specialized 
backhoes to dig through and visually remove 
the so-called bad actor wastes. After removing 
more than 10,000 cubic meters of waste mate-
rial from a combined area of 5.69 acres, the 
first phase of the project is complete. 
Madam Speaker, I want to personally thank 
the cleanup contractors and most importantly 
the dedicated employees who made this hap-
pen. They achieved this milestone more than 
18 months ahead of schedule. On behalf of 
myself, my constituents, and the citizens of 
Idaho, I applaud their hard work and thank

them for protecting one of Idaho’s most impor-
tant natural resources—the Snake River Plain 
Aquifer. 
Now, current cleanup contractor Idaho Envi-
ronmental Coalition led by a qualified manage-
ment team and the same hard-working em-
ployees is setting its sights on the second 
phase of this project. A cover will be con-
structed over the entire 97–acre landfill to fur-
ther protect the aquifer. This will be a massive 
undertaking that will require the Congress and 
the DOE to be in lockstep in terms of con-
tinuing to fund this critically important conclu-
sion to the buried waste project. 
The Cold War is part of this Nation’s history. 
Idaho played its part in this country winning 
the Cold War. Employees of the Idaho Clean-
up Project are helping to clean up the legacy 
of the Cold War. Again, please join me in 
thanking them for their dedication, profes-
sionalism, and commitment to protecting the 
environment in Idaho.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
L. GUTIERREZ, SR. 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Richard L. Gutierrez, 
Sr., who proudly served his country in uniform 
in World War II and the Korean War. 
Born August 15, 1925, in East Los Angeles, 
California, Mr. Gutierrez was the son of Frank 
F. and Esther L. Gutierrez. He attended Riggin 
Elementary School, Garfield High School, 
Compton College, and the University of South-
ern California. 
Mr. Gutierrez fought in World War II, enlist-
ing in 1943 as a Navy Seabee, assigned to 
the 4th Division of the Marines, Platoon 133 
Seabee support, Company B. He participated 
in battles on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, and 
Iwo Jima where he earned the Purple Heart. 
He also served as a Marine in the Korean 
War, during which, he was recalled to Camp 
Pendleton and served as a Drill Instructor. 
Mr. Gutierrez was married in 1948 to Vir-
ginia Lopez. This marriage lasted for 50 years. 
He leaves behind six children: Priscilla, 
Michelle, Richard Jr., Thomas, Aida, and Mi-
chael, who is a dedicated Catholic priest in La 
Puente; eleven grandchildren; and six great- 
grandchildren. 
After his military career and college training, 
he worked as an aerospace engineer for 
Douglas Aircraft, North American/Rockwell 
until he retired. During his professional career 
he was a team member who developed the 
Apollo and lead engineer on the command 
module of the Space Shuttle. Mr. Gutierrez 
died on March 6, 2022, in Duarte, California. 
I extend my deepest sympathies to the fam-
ily and friends of Richard L. Gutierrez, Sr., and 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Gutierrez’s service to our Nation. 
HONORING PAUL THIEM 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 104th birthday of Paul Thiem. 
Born on April 1, 1918, Mr. Thiem is a veteran 
and a resident of Wakefield, New Hampshire. 
During World War II, he answered the call of 
his nation and joined the U.S. Army Corps. 
Paul is an honorable member of our commu-
nity, and is a beloved husband, father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather. 
As a young patriot, Paul went above and 
beyond the call of duty in his service to his 
country, but his service to others does not end 
there. Following his military service, Paul trav-
eled around the world, building factories that 
made shoes for nurses. His travels brought 
him to places such as Poland, Italy, Spain and 
Korea. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
wish Mr. Thiem a happy 104th birthday and 
thank him for his service to our Nation. I hope 
that he has a wonderful celebration with his 
loved ones and fellow veterans. His sacrifice 
will not be forgotten.

CHERRY 
POINT, NORTH CAROLINA 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of a critical and 
strategic asset for Marine Corps Aviation— 
Fleet Readiness Center East (FRC East) lo-
cated in Havelock, North Carolina. Since 
1943, FRC East on board Marine Corps Air 
Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, has 
played an important role in securing the na-
tional defense of our great country. Their 
workforce has earned a reputation for excel-
lence in providing world-class maintenance, 
engineering and logistics support for Navy and 
Marine Corps aviation, as well as other armed 
services, federal agencies and foreign govern-
ments. 
FRC East has accomplished this vital mis-
sion while maintaining a safe and healthy work 
environment. The depot’s Safety and Occupa-
tional Health programs have been recognized 
at the state and federal levels, as well as with-
in the Department of Defense. FRC East 
closed out calendar year 2021 with the lowest 
number of Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration (OSHA) recordable mishaps in the 
command’s nearly 80-year history. The de-
pot’s superior standard of safety has also 
earned recognition from the OSHA Voluntary 
Protection Program (VPP). VPP highlights em-
ployers with effective safety and health man-
agement systems that record injury and illness 
rates below the average for their industries. 
In 2019, FRC East became the first Naval 
Aviation command to achieve OSHA VPP Star 
Status. The depot is one of only 21 VPP Star 
recognized sites in the entire Department of 
the Navy. FRC East was recently chosen as 
one of five sites for a Department of the Navy 
and National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health study aimed at evaluating VPP’s 
effectiveness in reducing noncombat injuries. 
FRC East has also been recognized by the 
North Carolina Department of Labor. The 
depot was presented with two ‘‘Million Hour’’ 
awards and its fourth consecutive ‘‘Gold 
Award.’’ Million Hour safety awards are given 
to organizations that accumulate one million 
employee hours with no injuries or illnesses 
involving days away from work. To meet the 
Gold Award standard, an organization must 
have had no fatalities during the award year, 
and also post a Day Away, Restricted or 
Transferred (DART) rate at least 50 percent 
below the industry average. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
and recognizing FRC East for its unwavering 
commitment to workplace safety. FRC East’s 
culture of safety ensures the depot’s most val-
uable resource, the highly skilled men and 
women who work there, are protected. I would 
also like to express my appreciation to the 
outstanding employees of FRC East for their 
dedication and continued service to our nation, 
our allies, and the Eastern North Carolina 
community.

JUDICIARY 
COM-

AND 
NY’S 
10TH 
CON-
GRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
thank Kayla Hamedi for her service to the 
House Committee on the Judiciary and to my 
office. 
Kayla first worked for me as an intern, serv-
ing the people of New York’s 10th Congres-
sional District, as she finished up her studies 
at the George Washington University, where 
she received her bachelor’s degree. She con-
tinued to work in the federal policy field after 
her internship ended, working for Active Policy 
Solutions and Rep. KRISHNAMOORTHI of Illinois. 
During this time, she also received her mas-
ter’s degree from the George Washington Uni-
versity’s College of Professional Studies. 
A little more than two years after her intern-
ship with my office had concluded, my staff 
and I excitedly welcomed Kayla back as a full- 
time staff member. Due to her strong work 
ethic and intellect, Kayla moved up several 
times in my office, first from Staff Assistant to 
Press Assistant/Legislative Correspondent and 
then to Legislative Assistant/Press Assistant. 
In these capacities, she staffed my front office, 
communicated with my constituents, handled 
press and digital communication, and worked 
on several policy portfolios. Notably, she 
helped assist my office during my campaign to 
become Ranking Member of the House Judici-
ary Committee. 
In November 2019, Kayla transitioned from 
my personal office to the Committee, where 
she first served as Deputy Press Secretary 
and was then promoted to Deputy Commu-
nications Director. Kayla joined the committee

during a particularly busy time, as we geared 
up for the first impeachment of President 
Trump and played an instrumental role in our 
communication work surrounding the impeach-
ment, including helping book TV interviews, as 
well as the second impeachment a year later. 
Kayla played an integral role in commu-
nicating to the public the work the Committee 
was doing for the American people. In addition 
to making sure every statement went out to 
the press as it was delivered, Kayla worked 
with other committees and other member of-
fices to coordinate press releases, press con-
ferences, and communication strategies; co-
ordinated briefings with reporters ahead of 
major breaking news events; and worked with 
national and international reporters on a range 
of issues before the committee. She also 
worked with our chief counsels to shape and 
perfect their messaging prior to the start of nu-
merous hearings and worked on communica-
tion campaigns relating to a range of judiciary 
issues, including but not limited to our work on 
voting rights, prohibiting forced arbitration for 
sexual harassment claims, and the reauthor-
ization of the Violence Against Women Act. 
Kayla helped roll out the Staff Report on our 
Antitrust Subcommittee’s Investigation of Com-
petition in Digital Markets, served as our pri-
mary point of contact for all press inquiries 
and communication efforts for several months 
when we transitioned between Communication 
Directors, and served as our primary digital 
staffer when we transitioned between Digital 
Directors. 
For more than four years, I have been fortu-
nate to count Kayla among my staff. I, and the 
American people, have greatly benefited from 
her work ethic, intellect, and strategic thinking. 
Kayla is calm in even the most stressful situa-
tions, always willing to lend a hand whenever 
one is needed, and brings a positive energy 
and a good spirit to everything she does. She 
has played a critical role in both serving New 
York’s 10th Congressional District and inform-
ing the American people of the work of my of-
fice and the Committee on the Judiciary. We 
will greatly miss Kayla as she embarks on the 
next chapter of her career on Capitol Hill. 
We thank Kayla for her service to the Com-
mittee and wish her the best of luck with this 
new chapter.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF 
CAPTAIN ROSS A. REYNOLDS 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the late 
Captain Ross A. Reynolds. A United States 
Marine and constituent of mine from Leomin-
ster, Massachusetts, Captain Reynolds, along 
with three other Marines, tragically lost his life 
in a NATO training exercise near Bodoe, Nor-
way on March 18, 2022. At only 27 years old, 
Captain Reynolds had accomplished so much 
and yet had so much life ahead—for that I’m 
heartbroken. 
Captain Reynolds joined the Marine Corps 
in 2017 and served as an MV–22 Osprey pilot 
until the time of his death. During his service, 
he was awarded the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service 
Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, 
and countless other certificates and letters of 
appreciation. These accolades exemplify Cap-
tain Reynolds commitment to the ideals of this 
nation and to serving a cause greater than 
himself. 
Often described as an exceptional leader 
and an even better friend, Captain Reynolds 
was known for his smile and the joy he 
brought into any room. From a young age, he 
exhibited pride for his country and a desire to 
be of service to others. As an Eagle Scout, 
Captain Reynolds often volunteered to hold up 
the American flag at community events and 
his good spirit was infectious as a camp coun-
selor at Camp Wanocksett in Dublin, New 
Hampshire. His presence was a light in the 
lives of everyone who had the privilege of 
knowing him. 
Madam Speaker, Captain Reynolds lived a 
life fuller than the one I can paint with these 
words. His service to his community, his coun-
try, and the people he loved cannot be under-
stated. Captain Reynolds was compassionate, 
caring, and showed up every day as good Ma-
rine, son, husband. He was the best version of 
the kind of people and citizens we all should 
aspire to be—put simply, Captain Reynolds 
was a good man. My wife Lisa and I extend 
our deepest condolences to his family, and we 
will keep them in our prayers. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and the entire Second Con-
gressional District of Massachusetts, I extend 
my deepest regrets to everyone who has been 
impacted by this terrible tragedy. May Captain 
Reynolds’ loved ones find peace in knowing 
that so many people across the Nation join 
them in remembering his life and service dur-
ing this difficult time.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING EQ-
UITY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Federal Government Advertising 
Equity Accountability Act, which would require 
all federal agencies to include in their annual 
budget requests to Congress the amount they 
spend on advertising contracts with small dis-
advantaged businesses (SDBs) and busi-
nesses owned by minorities and women. Fed-
eral agencies would be required to provide 
prior and projected total expenditures for such 
contracts. The Committee on Appropriations, 
at my and Representative BARBARA LEE’s re-
quest, has been requiring such information 
from many agencies for the last several years, 
but my bill would codify this requirement and 
apply it to all federal agencies. 
In 2007, the Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) examined spending on advertising 
contracts with minority-owned businesses by 
five agencies—the Department of Defense, 
the Department of the Treasury, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, the De-
partment of the Interior and the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration—and found 
that only five percent of the $4.3 billion avail-
able for advertising contracts went to minority 
businesses. In light of these concerning find-
ings, several Members of Congress and I sent 
a letter to GAO in April 2016 requesting up-
dated information on the amount of federal ad-
vertising dollars spent with SDBs and busi-
nesses owned by minorities and women. That 
GAO report, released in July 2018, showed 
that in fiscal year 2017, only 16 percent of the 
federal government’s advertising contract obli-
gations went to SDBs and businesses owned 
by minorities and women. 
The federal government is the largest adver-
tiser in the United States, and it has an obliga-
tion to ensure equitable access to its contracts 
for SDBs and businesses owned by minorities 
and women. The GAO’s findings demonstrate 
that there is still much progress to be made. 
The regular collection of information on fed-
eral advertising contracts with SDBs and busi-
nesses owned by women and minorities, 
along with the provision of this information to 
legislators and stakeholders, is essential to 
bridging the gap between what current statis-
tics show and a more inclusive advertising 
landscape. This bill would achieve these goals 
while also promoting transparency and en-
couraging federal agencies to strive to reach 
minorities, who often receive the news from 
smaller media outlets that serve communities 
of color. The requirement that agencies submit 
prior and projected information regarding the 
amount of advertising dollars spent with SDBs 
and businesses owned by minorities and 
women would allow federal agencies to evalu-
ate their progress over time. The regular col-
lection of this information would also dem-
onstrate that the promotion of equity in adver-
tising, and in all areas of government, should 
be a continuous effort that is important to the 
mission of every agency. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
11-YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONFLICT 
IN SYRIA 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week marked the 11- 
year anniversary of the beginning of the con-
flict in Syria. Now over a decade old, the crisis 
in Syria grinds on. Despite claims to the con-
trary, Bashar al-Assad has not won or extin-
guished the revolution. But he continues to 
weaponize and steal UN humanitarian assist-
ance, something the United States must work 
to stop. Thousands remain in detention, in-
cluding American citizens Majd Kamalmaj and 
Austin Tice, subject to brutal torture. The Cae-
sar photos provided heart wrenching and 
damning proof of Bashar’s crimes in regime 
jails. And more, Assad is flooding his country 
and the surrounding region with the lethal 
drug, Captagon, turning Syria into a narco- 
state. It is why I introduced legislation with my 
colleague to require the U.S. to prepare an 
inter-agency strategy to combat Captagon. 
Congress cannot remain silent on the atroc-
ities of the Assad regime. To that end, we 
must remain dedicated to preventing the reha-
bilitation of the regime. Bashar al-Assad and 
his henchmen must be held accountable for 
the genocide they are carrying out on the Syr-
ian people. It is why I am proud to serve as

the co-chair and co-found of the Friends of a 
Free, Stable, and Democratic Syria Caucus. I 
was honored to work with my colleagues on 
the caucus in passing the Caesar Act, strong 
bipartisan legislation that punishes Bashar al- 
Assad for his crimes against humanity. 
The humanitarian dimensions of the conflict 
in Syria also extend to areas outside Assad’s 
control. Millions struggle in the Northwest 
under harsh conditions, particularly the inter-
nally displaced who lack proper shelter living 
in tents with limited access to basic essentials. 
The U.S. cannot allow Russia to block reau-
thorization of the remaining cross-border point 
at Bab al-Hawa. The implications of denying 
much needed aid could produce the worst hu-
manitarian disaster of the entire conflict. 
We must also push back against the resur-
gence of ISIS in eastern Syria. I applaud the 
Biden Administration for the resumption of 
funding stabilization projects to gradually re-
build ISIS-liberated areas. Stabilization efforts 
must be robust and sustained to achieve a 
positive outcome. 
Syria is a nation with many challenges but 
one that the United States and the world can-
not ignore or look away from. I salute the ef-
forts of the Syrian-American community’s ad-
vocacy to address these challenges in calling 
for a free Syria and look forward to continuing 
to work with my colleagues to achieve that 
goal.

JEWISH FAMILY SERVICE OF 
COLORADO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud the Jewish 
Family Service of Colorado (JFS) for 150 
years of service to our community. 
Jewish Family Service of Colorado has 
been an outstanding pillar in our community, 
improving the lives of individuals and families 
throughout Colorado by delivering comprehen-
sive support services. In 1872, JFS was 
founded with the establishment of the Hebrew 
Ladied Benevolent Society to help the needs 
of Denver’s 300 Jewish pioneers. Later, in re-
sponse to the growing need for refugee settle-
ment during World War II, JFS merged with 
the Denver Coordinating Committee for Immi-
grants, forming the Jewish Family and Chil-
dren’s Services, what is now the Jewish Fam-
ily Service of Colorado. Today, the organiza-
tion offers over 30 services, including housing 
stability, food security, employment support, 
and disability services. JFS continues to have 
an exceptional impact in our district and 
across the Denver Metro region and Colorado, 
serving all people in need by aiding in crises 
and committing to a continuum of care. 
I applaud the Jewish Family Service of Col-
orado for their incredible work and commit-
ment to our community. I want to extend my 
deepest appreciation for their 150 years of 
service, and look forward to their continued 
service in the coming years. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MEGAN 
MELISSA BUGG 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 28, 2022 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Megan Bugg of Coal City, Illinois, 
who passed away in her home on Wednes-
day, March 9, 2022 after a seven year and 
three 
month 
battle 
with 
Alveolar 
Rhabdomyosarcorma. Megan will be greatly 
missed by many, but most especially her fam-
ily, whom she loved dearly. Megan believed 
that everyone deserved the honor of dignity, 
respect, and kindness, and she lived her life 
spreading that message. 
Throughout Megan’s battle with childhood 
cancer, she maintained a positive attitude and 
zest for life that became an inspiration for fam-
ily, friends, and many others. Although Megan 
was fighting her own personal battle, she 
made her fight about something much bigger 
than herself by becoming a passionate advo-
cate for childhood cancer awareness and the 
need for increased funding for cancer re-
search. She lobbied legislators for the cause 
and helped lead marches in-Washington, D.C. 
calling for increased funding for childhood can-
cer research. I was lucky enough to meet 
Megan on one of these visits and was incred-
ibly impressed by her courage, passion, and 
spirit. It’s no wonder she was chosen as the 
2019 American Red Cross Youth Hero, one of 
the Morris Daily Herald ‘‘Women of the Year’’ 
recipients, a Joliet Herald News ‘‘Everyday 
Hero’’, the Grand Marshall of the Grundy 
County Comfest Parade, and had her efforts 
honored by the Illinois Legislature in House 
Resolution 1071. In recognition of her achieve-
ments, the Children’s Cancer Therapy Devel-
opment Institute of Oregon is opening the 
‘‘Megan Bugg Global Rhabdomyosarcoma Re-
search Lab’’ to carry on Megan’s goal of mak-
ing sure no more children go through what 
she endured. 
Without a doubt, the world feels a void in 
the absence of Megan’s steadfast presence. 
As her family shared, Megan had a sense of 
humor that could light up the room and held 
a genuine Jove for all of those around her. 
They will remember all the lives she touched 
and by honoring her in this way, they can 
keep her spirit alive and continue to inspire 
others as she inspired so many. 
Megan is survived by her father, mother, 
and sister. She is also survived by her pater-
nal grandparents and her maternal grand-
parents. May the memories of her light be a 
comfort to her family and friends, and may we 
all carry her legacy forward in putting an end 
to childhood cancer. 
Madam Speaker, in expressing my condo-
lences, I want to take this time to also encour-
age the family, friends, and the community to 
celebrate the life of Megan Bugg—not only for 
her service in helping address the specific ob-
stacles related to childhood cancer aware-
ness, but for being a beacon of light and hope 
for all of those who had the opportunity to 
meet her. She remains an inspiration to not 
only her community, but to me as well.

woman of God, Pastor Rolesta B. Ellis. Sadly, 
Pastor Ellis transitioned from labor to reward 
on Monday, March 7, 2022, at the age of 89. 
Pastor Ellis lay in Honor at her beloved 
church, Calvary Pentecostal Tabernacle of 
Faith, on Thursday, March 10, 2022, and a 
homegoing service, celebrating her life was 
held on Friday, March 11, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. 
at the Cathedral of Prayer Church of God in 
Christ in Columbus, Georgia. 
Pastor Rolesta Bernice Boddie Ellis was 
born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on De-
cember 3, 1932, as the daughter of the late 
Mr. Octavis Boddie and Mrs. Julia Scott Vines 
as well the late Fred Vines. 
Pastor Ellis met the love of her life, Master 
Sergeant Clarence Ellis, Sr., USA, Retired, her 
first year in high school, and the two married 
in 1951. For over 30 years, she was a dedi-
cated military spouse who traveled extensively 
with her husband in the continental United 
States and abroad to Germany and France. 
In addition to being a devoted spouse, Pas-
tor Ellis was also a true Woman of Faith. Her 
commitment as a believer and servant of her 
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, began at the 
age of 11 and continued through every stage 
of her life. She maintained lifelong member-
ships with two congregations, Parks Chapel in 
Fayetteville, North Carolina, and The Calvary 
Pentecostal Tabernacle in Richmond, Virginia, 
throughout her life. Once Pastor Ellis an-
swered the call to minister to God’s people, 
she established the Calvary Pentecostal Tab-
ernacle of Faith in Columbus, Georgia, where 
she served as Pastor until she departed from 
this realm. She was also a founding member 
of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. 
Mother Teresa once said that ‘‘At the end of 
life we will not be judged by how many diplo-
mas we have received, how much money we 
have made, how many great things we have 
done. We will be judged by whether ‘‘. . . 
when I was hungry, you gave me something 
to eat, when I was naked, you clothed me, 
and whether, when I was homeless, you took 
me in.’’ Pastor Rolesta B. Ellis lived her life to 
help other people. Because of her love for 
Jesus Christ and her service to the least of 
these, the world is indeed a better place. 
On a personal note, Pastor Ellis was a spe-
cial friend to me and encouraged me through-
out my career as an attorney, state legislator, 
and Member of Congress. I will always value 
the wise counsel and sage advice she shared 
with me over the years. She did not tell me 
just what she thought I wanted to hear, but 
what she felt I needed to hear. My life was en-
riched because she touched me through her 
prayers and affirmations. 
Pastor Ellis accomplished much in her life, 
but none of it would have been possible with-
out the Grace of God and the love and sup-
port of her family including her late husband of 
66 and a half years, Clarence, Sr.; and her 
children, Clarence, Jr., Rolesta, Mario, and

Shelia. She will be greatly missed by her fam-
ily, her congregation, her community, and all 
those whose lives she touched. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of the Second Congressional 
District of Georgia, in paying tribute to Pastor 
Rolesta B. Ellis for her lifetime of service to 
her God, her nation, and humankind. We ex-
tend our deepest condolences to Pastor Ellis’ 
family during this difficult time of bereavement. 
We pray that they will be consoled and com-
forted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit 
in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise

after a 26-game win streak and only one de-
feat in their entire season. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing the accomplishments and hard 
work of the student-athletes, coaches and staff 
of Randolph-Macon’s men’s basketball pro-
gram. I look forward to seeing their continued 
excellence on the court and future victories.
