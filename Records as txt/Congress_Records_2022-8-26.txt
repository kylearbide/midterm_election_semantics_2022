PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
To You, O Lord, we lift up our souls. 
All that we are, all that we hope to be, 
we give to You. For in You, O God, we 
place our trust, knowing that Your 
grace is our shield, Your love our de-
fense. 
Show us Your ways, O Lord, and lead 
us according to Your paths. Do not 
allow Your will to be hidden from us, 
but guide us in the light of Your truth. 
Forbid it that we remain ignorant or 
indifferent to Your direction, but may 
we respond to Your clear instruction 
and discern the way You would have us 
go. 
For You are the God of our salvation. 
In You, time, as we measure it, cannot 
contain the depth of Your grace plan. 
We need only wait on You, and all 
things will be made known in accord-
ance with Your infinite intent for our 
lives. 
Such knowledge is too wonderful for 
us, too great for us to understand. So 
may we trust that You will hem us in 
behind and before, that You will lay 
Your hand on us. In this may we trust 
in and enjoy Your abiding presence 
with us this day. 
We offer our prayers in the power of 
Your most holy name. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING AURORA FIRE 
RESCUE FOR CAMP SPARK 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Aurora Fire Rescue for inspiring the 
next generation of women firefighters through 
an annual summer camp. 
Aurora Fire Rescue aims to increase the 
number of women in firefighting through Camp 
Spark—a summer program for female-identi-
fying middle and high schoolers with an inter-
est in the fire service. 
This three-day camp focuses on problem- 
solving, leadership, knowledge, and physical 
ability drills, to tackle a challenging curriculum, 
while introducing these young women to the 
daily lives of firefighters. From participating in 
a firehouse work out, rolling hoses, and repel-
ling, this camp provides hands-on experience 
to the physical demands of the profession. 
Camp Spark has both female and male fire-
fighters volunteering as instructors—providing 
a realistic representation of the fire service. 
The goal of Camp Spark is to supply these 
young women with invaluable insight into the 
profession and motivate them to consider a 
career in fire service. Aurora Fire Rescue 
places emphasis on adaptability as being key 
to the success of their campers—a skill that 
will stick with them long after camp ends. 
I commend Aurora Fire Rescue for their 
leadership, working to build a more inclusive 
department and profession. By introducing 
women to the world of firefighting from a 
young age, Aurora Fire Rescue aims to make 
a career in fire service a realistic and tangible 
goal for young women. I thank Aurora Fire 
Rescue and their volunteers for motivating and 
inspiring the next generation of women fire-
fighters.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO MIKE DEAN 
FOR HIS DECADES OF SERVICE 
IN THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF 
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the House’s lead upholsterer, Mike 
Dean—a master craftsman from Maryland’s 
Fifth Congressional District whose work has 
touched the lives of every person who serves 
the House of Representatives. After nearly 
four decades of hard work on Capitol Hill, 
Mike recently announced his well-deserved re-
tirement. 
If you have ever sat on a bench, chair, or 
sofa in the Capitol, you have benefited from 
Mike’s steadfast commitment to his craft. To 
Mike, upholstery is an art as much as it is a 
trade. He and his colleagues do not cut cor-
ners. From the ‘‘eight-way tie’’ to the ‘‘fox 
edge,’’ Mike and his team have mastered tra-
ditional techniques that most people in their 
field have sacrificed to save time and money. 
He operates perhaps the most interesting con-
traption in the Capitol complex: a vintage 
horsehair picker from the 1930’s. Most of the 
House’s furniture contains horsehair that Mike 
has recycled and fluffed using the picker, and 
experts at the Smithsonian believe it is the 
only machine of its kind still in active use 
today. 
To reupholster just one of the beautiful, cen-
tury-old Turkish chairs you see around the 
Capitol, it can take Mike and his team eighty 
hours of labor and forty pounds of horsehair. 
Unsurprisingly, the chairs remain just as com-
fortable today as I imagine they did in Speaker 
Joseph Cannon’s time. Although modern tech-
niques and materials would be easier to use, 
Mike knows that there is no substitute for 
quality and durability. 
As Members of Congress, we strive to up-
hold longstanding political and procedural 
norms and traditions to treat this institution 
with the reverence it deserves. Mike’s work is 
not so different. He is committed to historical 
preservation and authenticity because he 
knows it is the only way to produce and main-
tain furniture worthy of adorning the People’s 
House. For as long as the Capitol has stood, 
artisans 
like 
Mike 
have 
served 
as 
its 
custodians. For that, they will always be a part 
of its history. 
I ask all my colleagues to join me in thank-
ing Mike Dean for his decades of diligent serv-
ice and in wishing him a happy retirement.’’

HONORING NAPA PARKS AND 
RECREATION FOUNDATION 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Napa Parks 
and Recreation Foundation for its outstanding 
work to preserve our public lands and bring 
excellent outdoor experiences to our commu-
nity. 
The Napa Parks and Recreation Foundation 
is increasingly becoming a stronger and more 
recognized voice for supporting the parks and 
recreation opportunities in the City of Napa. In 
the last two years, its board membership has 
risen from five members to nine members, 
fostering a more diverse representation of our 
community. As a non-profit, the Napa Parks 
and Recreation Foundation is primarily fo-
cused on supporting and improving our com-
munity parks and recreation resources for 
families, individuals, and youth. The Napa 
Parks and Recreation Foundation collaborates 
with the Napa Parks and Recreation Services 
Department to continually assess the needs of 
the community and to improve accessibility 
and awareness of parks and recreation oppor-
tunities. 
Today, the Napa Parks and Recreation 
Foundation comes together in celebration of, 
‘‘A Day in the Park,’’ to bring awareness and 
support for the Foundation at Westwood Hills 
Park in honor of National Park and Recreation 
Month. Westwood Hills Park was established 
by the Napa City Council in 1976. The park is 
used by many in our community and by visi-
tors for hiking, running, enjoying the beautiful 
summit vista overlooking Napa Valley, experi-
encing the natural wildness of the outdoors 
within the town and walking the trails through-
out the park. 
The focus of ‘‘A Day in the Park’’ is to intro-
duce the community to Westwood Hills Park 
and to support the work of the Napa Parks 
and Recreation Foundation and Napa Parks 
and Recreation Services. This event will also 
support the purchase of trail markers for the 
Westwood Hills Park and the eventual installa-
tion of interpretive displays at the summit 
vista. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
Napa Parks and Recreation Foundation has 
been an important part of the Napa commu-
nity. It is therefore fitting and proper that we 
honor it today.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF DANIEL H. 
WHITELEY 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Chief Danny Whiteley who 
will soon retire after proudly serving as Poplar 
Bluff’s Police Chief for 22 years. 
Chief Whiteley is the proud husband to Gale 
Whiteley of 53 years and father to Jason 
Whiteley and Erika Boucher. Chief Whiteley 
also has 3 wonderful grandchildren. He has 
served the community as Mayor Pro Tem and 
as a member of the Poplar Bluff City Council. 
Additionally, he has served on the Poplar Bluff 
School Board, the Public Water District Board, 
and the Poplar Bluff Municipal Airport Board. 
Chief Whiteley is currently serving as project 
director for the Southeast Missouri Drug Task 
Force and is on the Board of Directors for the 
Missouri Police Chiefs’ Association. Prior to 
his career serving the community, he was a 
professional rodeo athlete and toured the 
country competing in many events, including 
bull riding and steer wrestling. 
As the longest-serving police chief in Poplar 
Bluff history, it is obvious to the Poplar Bluff 
community that Chief Whiteley loved and took 
great pride in his job. He has never wavered 
in his commitment to serving and protecting 
the town in which he grew up and has always 
been there for the community during chal-
lenging times. He did not limit himself to only 
working with local law enforcement, but 
reached out to other law enforcement agen-
cies at the state and federal level to share his

knowledge and offer his assistance to help 
make a positive difference in communities far 
beyond Poplar Bluff. Thanks to his innovative 
approach and strong leadership, he trans-
formed the Poplar Bluff Police Department into 
a 21st century law enforcement agency, an 
achievement that will benefit the city for years 
to come. 
Chief Whiteley is retiring after successfully 
moving the police department into their new 
facility. The residents of Poplar Bluff are sad 
to see Chief Whiteley go, but also hope he en-
joys his well-deserved retirement. We thank 
him for over two decades of outstanding serv-
ice and for selflessly protecting Missouri. I 
thank Chief Whiteley.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE FIRST PRES-
BYTERIAN CHURCH OF BONHAM, 
TEXAS 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the First 
Presbyterian Church of Bonham, Texas. Since 
its founding on the third Sunday in August of 
1872, it has continued to deliver exceptional 
worship services to the people of Bonham and 
Fannin County. 
The great state of Texas was granted state-
hood only 27 years prior to the First Pres-
byterian Church’s establishment. Since then, it 
has served as a safe place of worship and 
focal point of the community. Its members 
have organized many charitable events includ-
ing food drives and back-to-school initiatives. 
I have no doubt that every man, woman, 
and child of First Presbyterian are upstanding 
citizens who wish to preserve the word of 
Christ. First Presbyterian exemplifies our Na-
tion’s resolve and has helped countless indi-
viduals through difficult times. I am honored to 
recognize their anniversary and devotion to 
God on the floor of the House of Representa-
tives. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
the First Presbyterian Church’s contributions 
to the Bonham community, and I ask that my 
colleagues join me in honoring them today. I 
thank them, and God Bless.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND MEM-
ORY 
OF 
OFFICER 
DANIEL 
VASQUEZ 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart and an indescribable 
sadness. I rise, on behalf of Missouri’s Fifth 
Congressional District, to honor and celebrate 
the life of Officer Daniel Vasquez. Our com-
munity has lost a remarkable man, one who 
dedicated his life to protecting and serving the 
people of North Kansas City as a police offi-
cer. Officer Vasquez was described by his col-
leagues as a ‘‘shining star’’ in the department, 
always working with a smile. He worked tire-
lessly to keep his hometown safe, putting his 
life on the line each and every day until mak-
ing the ultimate sacrifice on July 19 of this 
year, when he was senselessly killed in the 
line of duty. Officer Vasquez was only 32 
years old. 
Daniel was born on January 19, 1990, in 
North Kansas City. Daniel is the youngest of 
three children and the first of his Mexican- 
American family to be born in Kansas City. In 
his childhood, Daniel’s carefree nature led to 
a variety of interests, ranging from playing the 
drums in church to tackling kids on the football 
field. In his adult life, Daniel’s free time con-
sisted of playing video games, going to the 
gym, and trying new restaurants. Officer 
Vasquez was a loving son, brother, fiance´, 
uncle, and friend; he brought joy to all those 
who had the great fortune of knowing him. 
Officer Vasquez began his career in security 
with the Independence Avenue Community 
Improvement District, serving both Wyandotte 
County and Jackson County as an ‘‘Avenue 
Angel.’’ In 2019, Daniel continued his service 
by joining the Kansas City Missouri Police De-
partment as a Detention Officer. Here, Officer 
Vasquez worked diligently each day in hopes 
of achieving his lifelong dream of becoming a 
police officer. After years of hard work and 
perseverance, Daniel joined the police force in 
January of 2021 and, after completing his 
training at the KCPD Regional Police Acad-
emy with Graduating Class No. 171, he was 
sworn into office. He embodied the highest 
standards of ethics each day as he devoted 
himself to making our community a safer, 
stronger, and better place to call home. Even 
with his short time on the force, those he 
worked with speak highly of Daniel and re-
count his positive attitude, cheerful spirit, and 
infectious smile. 
On July 19, 2022, a tragedy ensued, and 
Daniel’s life was cut short by an act of un-
speakable violence. When a police officer is 
slain in the line of duty, the whole community 
grieves. My thoughts and prayers go out to 
everyone 
who 
knew 
and 
loved 
Daniel 
Vasquez. With his passing, Daniel leaves be-
hind a long list of loving family and friends. To 
his parents, Francisco and Guadalupe, I 
mourn with you. No parent should outlive their 
child. I hope that you may find some comfort 
in seeing the outpouring of love and support 
Daniel has received. The world now knows 
what’s always been clear to you, that Daniel 
was a remarkable young man destined for 
great things. 
The highest form of recognition from the 
North Kansas City Police Department, The 
Medal of Valor, has since been bestowed 
upon Officer Vasquez. This tribute cannot 
begin to remedy the loss felt by those who 
knew Daniel, but it is a symbol of gratitude for 
his distinguished service and boundless brav-
ery. While I did not have the good fortune of 
knowing Officer Vasquez personally, I have 
learned of his kind, compassionate, and de-
pendable nature. Officer Vasquez went above 
and beyond the call of duty to protect his com-
munity and his service will never be taken for 
granted or forgotten. When tragedies like this 
occur, it is difficult to comprehend the loss we 
all feel. In times like these, I am called to 
Scripture. John 16:22 says, ‘‘So with you: Now 
is your time of grief, but I will see you again 
and you will rejoice, and no one will take away 
your joy.’’ Let us find solace in the word of 
God and remember that we will be reunited, 
once more, in the Kingdom of Heaven. 
Today, my thoughts, and the thoughts of 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, are with 
Officer Vasquez and his family, as we illu-
minate his lifetime of service and sacrifice. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the life and legacy of Officer Daniel Vasquez. 
May his dedication to this community never be 
forgotten and may his memory continue to live 
on within us all. Let us admire the courageous 
nature of Officer Vasquez and face each day 
as he would, with a smile on our face and 
spirit in our heart.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL MACK 
HAYNES HORNBEAK 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and memory of Lt. 
Col. Mack Haynes Hornbeak for his service to 
our country, Louisiana State University, and 
the community of Baton Rouge. 
Lt. Col. Hornbeak was born on June 23rd, 
1906, to Pleasant and Ada Hornbeak in 
Hornbeak, Tennessee. Although he was born 
in Tennessee, Lt. Col. Hornbeak soon became 
a proud Louisianian and Tiger fan. He earned 
his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy 
from Louisiana State University. He even be-
came a part of LSU’s faculty as an Associate 
Professor of Business Administration and Ac-
counting. He served the university during a 
time of great need and financial strain and 
was appointed as the university’s purchasing 
agent to ensure responsible spending. How-
ever, he most loved teaching and greatly 
missed LSU’s campus and its students when 
they were let out of school in the summer. 
Like so many brave men and women, Lt. 
Col. Hornbeak paused his career in academia 
and readily enlisted in the United States 
Armed Forces at the outbreak of World War II. 
He served in the European theatre from 1942 
to the war’s end in 1945. A decorated veteran, 
he was recognized for his valiant service in 
combat and earned the Legion of Merit, the 
Bronze Star, the Croix de Guerre of France, 
Belgium, Luxembourg, and one oak leaf clus-
ter. After the war, he returned to Baton Rouge, 
where he married Barbra Marie Thomas on 
June 5th, 1958, and they welcomed their 
daughter Anne Haynes Hornbeak on August 
12th, 1961. Anne fondly recalls her father’s 
love for fishing and taking her back to Ten-
nessee every summer to fish in Lake Reelfoot. 
Lt. Col. Hornbeak played an active role in 
his community of Baton Rouge and was a 
member of the Baton Rouge Chamber of 
Commerce and served as president from 
1958–1959. He worked in the banking industry 
until his retirement. I am pleased to honor his 
memory and am thankful for his service to our 
great country and state. I wish his family all 
the best as they continue to uphold his legacy.

RECOGNIZING HANDS OF THE 
CARPENTER 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Hands of the Carpenter, an organi-
zation that provides affordable cars and main-
tenance for single mothers in the Denver- 
metro area. 
Founded in 2003 by Dan Georgopulos, 
Hands of the Carpenter opened its first loca-
tion in Golden, Colorado. Dan recognized that 
affordable, reliable transportation was integral 
to self-sufficiency—especially for single moth-
ers with dependent children who rely on trans-
portation to get themselves to work and their 
children to school. Hands of the Carpenter 
was created to provide car placement and 
maintenance to single moms, allowing them to 
achieve self-sufficiency and independence. 
Recently, Hands of the Carpenter opened a 
second location, in Aurora, Colorado, which 
will allow the organization to serve twice as 
many women as it was serving at the Golden 
location. They have adapted to the needs of 
women over the course of two decades and 
have created what’s known as the ‘‘Hands 
Community’’—a conglomerate of organiza-
tions, businesses, and churches working to-
gether to assist single moms—providing not 
only practical assistance, but also hope. 
It goes without saying that Hands of the 
Carpenter has an incredible impact in the lives 
of women throughout our community and the 
entire state of Colorado. I am proud to recog-
nize them for their tireless work assisting sin-
gle mothers with automotive services, and I 
thank them for their dedication in serving our 
community.

BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 12, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
offer some additional thoughts in support of 
our historic legislation, the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022 (IRA or the Act). 
The electric power sector presents unique 
issues because it is evolving rapidly. Renew-
able and other low-emitting electricity genera-
tion are rapidly replacing coal-fired generation. 
The costs of the former continue to fall, leav-
ing many of the coal-fired plants that remain in 
operation with thin profit margins. 
The IRA includes numerous provisions and 
substantial funding designed to accelerate this 
transition to clean energy. Of particular rel-
evance, Section 13204 of the IRA creates a 
new federal tax credit (at Internal Revenue 
Code Section 45V) for production of clean hy-
drogen, and Section 13104 extends and in-
creases the federal tax credit (at Internal Rev-
enue Code Section 45Q) for carbon oxide 
capture, also referred to as carbon capture, 
utilization, and storage (CCUS). Congress an-
ticipates that while this tax credit will make 
CCUS more affordable for coal-fired electricity 
generating plants and will allow some to con-
tinue to operate while reducing their GHG 
emissions, power companies will also continue 
to choose to retire such plants in favor of 
cleaner forms of generation. 
The IRA also includes provisions that sup-
port EPA rulemaking to reduce GHG emis-
sions from the electric power sector. Congress 
understands that this rulemaking will have the 
incidental effect of expediting the transition to 
clean energy because by requiring fossil fuel- 
fired power plants to reduce emissions, it will 
require additional investments by these plants 
that will not be needed for plants using clean-
er forms of generation. In particular, Section 
60107 establishes new CAA Section 135 that 
requires EPA to account for this transition to 
clean energy in promulgating regulations to re-
duce GHG emissions. Section 60107(a)(1) 
through (4) provide EPA $68 million to support 
actions—such as consumer-related education 
and technical assistance to State, Tribal, and 
local governments—to reduce GHG emissions 
that result from domestic electricity generation 
and use, and Section 60107(a)(5) provides $1 
million for EPA to conduct an assessment of 
the reductions in GHG emissions that will re-
sult from changes in domestic electricity gen-
eration and use anticipated to occur on an an-
nual basis through fiscal year 2031. Section 
60107(a)(6), as previously noted, provides $18 
million for EPA to promulgate additional re-
quirements under its CAA authorities to en-
sure reductions in GHG emissions, incor-
porating the assessment under paragraph (5). 
Congress has full confidence that EPA has 
sufficient expertise to make the assessment 
under Section 60107(a)(5) and conduct the 
rulemakings 
contemplated 
under 
Section 
60107 through the authority of CAA Section 
111 and other CAA provisions. EPA has a 
long history of action in this sector. In fact, 
EPA initiated rulemaking to control air pollut-
ants from the electric power industry shortly 
after enactment of the 1970 CAA Amend-
ments and, in the five decades since, has pro-
mulgated numerous regulations affecting the 
industry, under several CAA provisions, that 
are among the most significant in EPA’s his-
tory. Congress considers these activities as 
clear evidence of EPA’s robust understanding 
of the electric power industry, its underlying 
economics, its sources of electricity genera-
tion, its infrastructure, its mechanisms to main-
tain reliability, its rate structure, and other 
components. Congress believes the U.S. Su-
preme Court correctly recognized EPA’s ex-
pertise in the electric power sector in 2011 in 
American Electric Power v. Connecticut and 
notes the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in 
West Virginia v. EPA does not call EPA’s ex-
pertise into question. (American Electric Power 
v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 426, 427, 428 
(2011); West Virginia v. EPA, No. 20–1530, 
Slip Op. at 25 (2022)). 
The IRA authorizes EPA to make use of the 
additional funding that Section 60107 provides 
to promulgate regulations for GHGs under 
Sections 111(b) and 111(d) for new and exist-
ing industrial sources. Section 111 is the sin-
gle most important tool in EPA’s toolkit for reg-
ulating new and existing industrial sources of 
GHGs, and Congress expects EPA to make 
increasing use of it. Section 111 authorizes 
EPA to base regulatory requirements on the 
‘‘best system of emission reduction . . . ade-
quately demonstrated’’ (BSER) for controlling 
air pollutants, taking into account, among 
other things, cost. As previously noted, Con-
gress expects that EPA will interpret Section 
111 broadly, consistent with its meaning since 
it was enacted in the 1970 CAA Amendments, 
so that EPA will be able to promulgate 
impactful regulations for these sources, includ-
ing ones that may be innovative, as appro-
priate. 
Congress intends for all of the technologies 
funded under this Act (such as the tax credits 
for CCUS and clean hydrogen production) to 
be available to EPA to tackle the climate cri-
sis, along with any other technologies or sys-
tems that EPA finds meet statutory criteria, 
such as those identified in its April 2022 draft 
White Paper. (Available and Emerging Tech-
nologies for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emis-
sions from Combustion Turbine Electric Gen-
erating Units (Apr. 21, 2022)). While the draft 
White Paper identified methods EPA or States 
could use to reduce GHGs from combustion 
turbines (which are generally natural-gas 
fired), many of these methods could also 
apply to steam boiler units (which are gen-
erally coal-fired) and to other 
industrial 
sources. Section 111, as enacted, clearly au-
thorizes EPA to adopt any of these measures 
as the BSER—if EPA determines that they 
meet the applicable requirements concerning, 
for example, cost—and therefore as the basis 
for regulatory requirements for new and exist-
ing sources. The Supreme Court’s decision in 
West Virginia v. EPA does not preclude those 
types of controls as BSER or as a component 
of the best system and, in fact, recognizes 
many of them as traditional air pollution con-
trol measures. The IRA recognizes this ex-
traordinary time of transition in the energy sec-
tor and the rapid pace of technological 
change, and we urge EPA, where feasible, to 
base its emissions requirement on both tech-
nologies that are available now and those that 
will be available in the near term, including be-
cause of incentives contained within this Act. 
This approach may allow EPA flexibility to ad-
dress more fully GHG emissions from par-
ticular source categories in its rulemaking. 
The tax credits for CCUS and clean hydro-
gen production included in this Act may also 
figure into CAA Section 111 GHG regulations 
for new and existing industrial sources as well 
as other CAA requirements, such as permit-
ting under Section 165. As noted above, Con-
gress anticipates that EPA may consider 
CCUS or clean hydrogen as candidates for 
BSER for electric generating plants as well as 
for other fossil fuel-fired industrial sources. 
Further, Congress anticipates that EPA may 
consider the impact of the CCUS and hydro-
gen production tax credits in lowering the 
costs of those measures. As I noted above, 
Congress anticipates that regulatory require-
ments to reduce emissions imposed on coal- 
fired electricity generating plants will require 
additional investments by these plants—in-
vestments that non-emitting plants will not 
have to make. Such a rulemaking would be 
clearly authorized under Section 111, con-
sistent with its meaning since enactment. 
Congress intends that, for purposes of rules 
under Section 111 and other CAA require-
ments based on CCUS or clean hydrogen, the 
cost of CCUS or clean hydrogen may be cal-
culated on the assumption that the amount of 
the tax credit is the increased amount avail-
able under Internal Revenue Code Sections 
45Q(h)(1) or 45V(e)(1), respectively, as added 
by this Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E880 
August 26, 2022 
Section 60105(g) provides EPA $5 million to 
provide grants to states to adopt and imple-
ment GHG and zero-emission standards for 
mobile sources pursuant to Section 177 of the 
CAA. Congress supports states taking actions 
to address their air pollution and climate 
needs. An important tool that many states 
have available is the ability to adopt Califor-
nia’s GHG, zero-emissions vehicle, and cri-
teria pollutant emissions standards for mobile 
sources under Section 177, which they may 
submit to EPA afterwards as part of their state 
measures. 
Funding 
available 
in 
Section 
60105(g) is intended to support states wishing 
to use this tool. 
A necessary predicate for states adopting 
California’s standards under Section 177 is 
that EPA issue a waiver of preemption pursu-
ant to CAA Section 209. By making these 
funds available specifically for states to adopt 
and implement California’s GHG and zero 
emission mobile source standards, Congress 
indicates its approval of EPA’s decision to 
grant a waiver to California for such standards 
where the statutory criteria have been met. 
EPA has done this several times in the past 
including, but not limited to, in 2009 for Cali-
fornia’s GHG standards for new motor vehi-
cles; in 2013 for California’s advanced clean 
car standards, including its zero-emission ve-
hicle sales mandate; and in 2014 and 2016 for 
California’s heavy-duty GHG emission stand-
ards. California may continue to need such 
standards to address compelling and extraor-
dinary conditions. 
Congress recognizes the reductions in GHG 
emissions from motor vehicles and engines 
owing to increased engine efficiency, improved 
vehicle design, and the transition to low- and 
zero-emission vehicles, including fuel-cell and 
battery-powered electric vehicles. EPA’s re-
cent light-duty vehicle regulations establishing 
standards for motor vehicles and engines for 
2023 and later model years identify and 
incentivize these technological developments. 
(86 Fed. Reg. 74434 (Dec. 30, 2021)). Con-
gress recognizes EPA’s longstanding authority 
under CAA Section 202 to adopt standards 
that rely on zero emission technologies, and 
Congress expects that future EPA regulations 
will increasingly rely on and incentivize zero- 
emission vehicles as appropriate. Other provi-
sions in the IRA will further support the transi-
tion to zero-emission vehicles including, but 
not limited to, Section 60101, funds to support 
clean heavy-duty vehicles; Section 60102, 
funds to reduce air pollution and support zero- 
emissions technology at ports; Section 60104, 
funds to support diesel emissions reductions; 
and Sections 13401 through 134003, tax cred-
its for clean vehicles. 
The IRA provides additional funding for EPA 
to carry out provisions of the American Inno-
vation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, which 
Congress expects EPA will use to adopt ro-
bust measures to address hydrofluorocarbons, 
which are potent GHGs, and where appro-
priate, their substitutes. Specifically, Section 
60109(a)(1) provides $20 million to carry out 
subsections (a) through (i) and subsection (k) 
of the AIM Act. Section 60109(a)(2) provides 
$3.5 million to deploy new implementation and 
compliance tools to carry out those same sub-
sections 
of 
the 
AIM 
Act, 
and 
Section 
60109(a)(3) provides $15 million for competi-
tive grants for reclaim and innovative destruc-
tion technologies under those same sub-
sections of the AIM Act. EPA’s rulemaking 
under 
the 
AIM 
Act 
to 
address 
hydrofluorocarbons is vital to limiting the cli-
mate impacts from these potent GHGs and an 
important tool in helping to address the cli-
mate crisis. Congress recognizes that ad-
dressing hydrofluorocarbons, and where ap-
propriate their substitutes, under the recently 
enacted AIM Act may present novel and com-
plex issues that may require innovative regu-
latory approaches, including robust measures 
to ensure compliance with regulatory and stat-
utory requirements. In providing this additional 
funding under Section 60109, Congress in-
tends that EPA construe its authority under 
the AIM Act broadly, consistent with the mean-
ing of AIM since its enactment, to help ensure 
compliance 
so 
requirements 
are 
fully 
achieved. Promulgating and implementing 
these regulations may be resource-intensive, 
and this additional funding will allow EPA to 
prioritize those efforts and devote the nec-
essary resources to them, including adopting 
innovative and impactful requirements and 
successfully implementing those regulations to 
ensure that Congressional goals of addressing 
climate-damaging 
hydrofluorocarbons 
are 
achieved. Congress further recognizes that the 
Agency has developed a robust set of tools 
and worked closely with industry to meet 
these ambitious goals. Previous EPA actions 
include protecting our borders from illegal 
trade and facilitating transitions to innovative 
alternatives and technologies, many of which 
have been developed and deployed by Amer-
ican companies. This additional funding pro-
vides further support for the Agency to con-
tinue with this important work. 
By passing the IRA, Congress is making a 
critical and historic down payment toward a 
stable climate and shared economic oppor-
tunity powered by American-made clean en-
ergy. The IRA gives us an opportunity to meet 
our science-based climate goals and be a 
global clean energy leader through American 
innovation, manufacturing, and job creation 
while bolstering policy action and partnerships 
by federal agencies, states, and local govern-
ments to reduce GHGs and create a clean fu-
ture for all. 
The CAA is one of the most powerful and 
enduring tools available to achieve our climate 
and clean energy goals. Congress recognizes 
EPA’s longstanding authority and responsibility 
to regulate GHGs as air pollutants under the 
CAA, and with the IRA clearly and deliberately 
instructs EPA to use it. As discussed, the IRA 
combines economic incentives to reduce cli-
mate pollution with regulatory drivers to spur 
greater reductions under EPA’s CAA authori-
ties. 
The IRA also builds on EPA’s time-tested 
responsibility and authority under the CAA by 
making critical amendments to provide EPA 
with important new tools and new funding to 
protect the public. These changes to our na-
tion’s clean air law, and the many other his-
toric provisions of the IRA, will ensure the 
promise of the CAA to promote the public 
health, welfare, and the productive capacity of 
the American people is strengthened and con-
tinues for years to come. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF AMEDIO 
THOMAS FERDINANDI 
HON. CONNIE CONWAY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Amedio Thomas 
‘‘Tom’’ Ferdinandi. Born in 1930 on Valentine’s 
Day, Tom peacefully entered the arms of our 
Lord on June 23, 2022. He was a family man 
and charismatic leader who helped and sup-
ported many members of our community. 
In 1945, Tom and his younger brother John 
moved with their parents, John and Natalina 
(Cicellini) Ferdinandi, to Fresno, where Tom 
started his sophomore year at the newly built 
San Joaquin Memorial High School. There, he 
first met the love of his life, Anna Laura 
‘‘Jane’’ Ochinero. Jane was a cheerleader at 
San Joaquin Memorial High School, and Tom 
was a football player. Tom and Jane married 
shortly after high school and welcomed four 
children into their lives, Laura, Tom, John, and 
David. Tom and Jane would go on to cele-
brate 72 years of marriage, sharing true love 
for each other and for their family. 
Over 60 years ago, Tom, with his partner 
and high school friend Jim DeMera, were sell-
ing pizzas from Me-n-Ed’s original location in 
Fresno, as well as from locations in Hanford 
and in Orange County. They grew the pizze-
rias from the original three locations to over 
twenty 
restaurants 
by 
the 
mid-1980s. 
Headquartered in Fresno and still family oper-
ated, the company now owns, operates and 
franchises over 60 restaurants under the Me- 
n-Ed’s, Piazza del Pane, and Blast & Brew 
brands, and is one of the top 50 U.S. pizza 
chains. The company has been honored with 
community service and philanthropy awards 
for its many contributions to schools, church-
es, hospitals, and other Central Valley non- 
profits. 
Tom was an avid supporter of numerous 
community organizations and institutions, in-
cluding the Fresno State Bulldogs, San Joa-
quin Memorial High School, Saint Anthony of 
Padua Catholic Church, Saint Agnes Hospital, 
the Serra Club, Catholic Charities, the Catholic 
Diocese of Fresno and the Poverello House. 
He was also a member of the Young Men’s 
Institute and the Italian Catholic Federation, a 
president of the Serra Club, and a board 
member of Catholic Charities. 
He is survived by his loving wife Jane 
Ochinero 
Ferdinandi; 
their 
children 
and 
spouses, John and Laura Mahoney, Tom Jr. 
and Karen Ferdinandi, John and Christine 
Ferdinandi, and David and Wendy Ferdinandi; 
and their twelve grandchildren, nine great- 
grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Amedio Thomas 
‘‘Tom’’ Ferdinandi. His service and contribu-
tions to the San Joaquin Valley will long be re-
membered.

HONORING ALLEN E. IVERSON ON 
HIS BETHEL HIGH SCHOOL FOOT-
BALL JERSEY RETIREMENT 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Allen Ezail Iverson 
for his contributions as an amateur and pro-
fessional athlete as Bethel High School, his 
alma mater, retires his football jersey in a 
ceremony today. 
As a student at Bethel High School in 
Hampton, Virginia, Allen was a standout ath-
lete on the football field and on the basketball 
court. He excelled as a quarterback, punt re-
turner and defensive back while leading his 
teammates to a Division 5 State Champion-
ship in 1992. Allen was equally talented on the 
basketball court, and he had the distinction of 
winning an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) 
Under 17 National Championship in 1992 as a 
member of the Boo Williams AAU Team. 
Allen also excelled as Bethel’s starting point 
guard. He led Bethel’s basketball team to an-
other Division 5 State Championship in the 
spring of 1993, which resulted in the rare feat 
of winning State Championships in two sepa-
rate sports in the same school year. Allen was 
widely-recognized as one of the best athletes 
in the nation. During his high school career, 
he was named the Associated Press Group’s 
AAA Football and Basketball Player of the 
Year and a McDonald’s High School All-Amer-
ican in Basketball. 
After graduating from Bethel High School, 
Allen went on to attend Georgetown University 
in Washington, DC, where he was a member 
of the basketball team. During his two years 
on the basketball team, he led the Hoyas to 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Basketball Tournament with berths to 
the Sweet 18 and Elite 8. As a Hoya, Allen re-
ceived the Big East Rookie of the Year Award 
and was selected for All Rookie Tournament 
First Team. He was also selected as Big East 
Defensive Player of the Year and a First Team 
All American. 
To the delight of his fans, Allen was drafted 
to the Philadelphia 76ers in 1996. He made an 
impact with the team immediately and was 
named the National Basketball Association’s 
(NBA) Rookie of the year in 1997. During the 
2000–2001 season, he was named Most Valu-
able Player and led the 76ers to the NBA 
Finals. Ultimately, Allen spent ten seasons 
with the 76ers before he was traded to the 
Denver Nuggets. He played for the Nuggets 
for two seasons before also playing for the 
Detroit Pistons and the Memphis Grizzlies. He 
concluded his NBA career by reuniting with 
the Philadelphia 76ers for twenty-five games. 
Over the course of his career, Allen re-
ceived numerous accolades. He led the NBA 
in scoring on four separate occasions. He was 
named to the All-Star team eleven times and 
was twice named the All-Star Game’s Most 
Valuable Player. He was named to an All-NBA 
Team seven times. Known for his grit and de-
termination, Allen has had tremendous impact 
on the game on the court and basketball cul-
ture at large. Allen was rewarded for his many 
contributions with his induction to the Naismith 
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. 
During the NBA’s 75th Anniversary, Allen was 
recognized as one of the 75 best players in 
NBA history. 
Madam Speaker, Allen Iverson has inspired 
and impacted basketball fans in his hometown 
of Hampton, across our Nation, and around 
the world. Off the court, he has given so much 
back to his hometown community, including 
donating toys to children and helping to fund 
a new basketball court at the local Boys and 
Girls Club in Newport News where he played 
as a child. Bethel High School renamed its 
gymnasium the Allen Iverson Gymnasium and 
his basketball jersey was retired in 2003. As 
his family, friends, fans, and supporters gather 
this weekend to celebrate his numerous ac-
complishments and the retirement of his high 
school football jersey, I join them in congratu-
lating Allen on a truly legendary career. I also 
want to thank his wife Tawanna, his mother 
Ann, his five children, and his family for all the 
support they have given Allen throughout his 
career. Allen, who is also affectionately known 
as ‘‘AI’’, ‘‘the Answer’’ and ‘‘Bubba Chuck’’, I 
thank him for representing our community dur-
ing his career and congratulate him on the re-
tirement of his Bethel High School football jer-
sey.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GARY 
GUSTAFSON 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and recognize the life of Staff 
Sgt. Gary Gustafson, USAF, Ret. Born on Au-
gust 16, 1932, Gary peacefully entered the 
arms of our Lord on August 21, 2022. He was 
a family man, military veteran, and beloved 
member of his community. 
Gary was born and raised in the ‘‘Swedish 
village’’ of Kingsburg, California, where he 
grew up on the banks of the Kings River. He 
worked as a carpenter for most of his life, 
building his family home on acreage in the 
country. He helped operate the Royal Oak Re-
sort family campground business, and he 
farmed grapes and tree fruit for the Central 
Valley. Gary was a man of simple tastes and 
pleasures who immensely valued family and 
hard work. 
A varsity football player at Kingsburg High 
School, Gary continued playing football after 
joining the Air Force, where he served 4 years 
working on various top-secret projects and as-
signments. While stationed in Utah, Gary met 
the love of his life, Elma Lee Kerr, and the two 
married in April 1955 shortly before Gary re-
tired from military service. The couple moved 
back to Kingsburg, where they welcomed their 
two children, Gregg and LeeAnn, into their 
lives. Gary and Elma Lee shared many won-
derful memories together over their 52 years 
of marriage before Elma Lee suddenly passed 
and peacefully made her way to our Lord in 
2007. 
Gary retained his passion for planes long 
after his retirement from the Air Force. He 
spent many years flying his plane to Air Force 
reunions, where he reminisced with old friends 
and football buddies. Gary was a man of few 
words but many actions. He worked tirelessly 
to support his family and deeply loved his 
community—he spent nearly his entire life in 
Kingsburg, where he has left a lasting impres-
sion as a hardworking husband, father, and 
U.S. military veteran. 
He is survived by his companion, Greta Wil-
liams, along with his daughter and her hus-
band, LeeAnn and Jim McClusky, as well as 
six grandchildren, and eight great-grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Gary Gustafson. His 
service to our country and contributions to the 
Central Valley will be widely celebrated and 
long remembered by those who knew and 
loved him.

CELEBRATING BEALE AIR FORCE 
BASE’S 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 75th anniversary of the 
United States Air Force and the positive con-
tributions Beale Air Force Base has made to 
the Yuba Sutter Community since 1942. 
Madam Speaker, for 75 years, American air-
men have excelled as they execute the Air 
Force mission to fly, fight, and win—delivering 
airpower anytime, anywhere in defense of our 
Nation. Airmen are called to ‘‘Innovate, Accel-
erate and Thrive’’ as the U.S. Air Force ap-
proaches its 75th anniversary on September 
18, 2022. Airmen will always be there to pro-
vide America with the airpower it needs to de-
fend the Nation, deter or defeat our adver-
saries, reassure our partners and allies, and 
help diplomacy proceed from a position of 
strength. Airmen continue to push techno-
logical and cultural boundaries which make 
America 
the 
leader 
in 
airpower 
and 
spacepower. Innovation is an integral part of 
how we train and employ our squadrons, de-
velop our capabilities, and continue to move 
toward an even more effective Air Force. From 
its inception 75 years ago, the United States 
Air Force has excelled at keeping pace with 
rapid changes in technology and in meeting 
the demands placed on the Air Force’s five 
core missions: air superiority; global strike; 
rapid global mobility; intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance; and command and con-
trol. 
Camp Beale opened in October 1942 as a 
training site for the 13th Armored and the 81st 
and 96th Infantry Divisions. Today, Beale Air 
Force Base is home to the U–2 Dragon Lady, 
T–38 Talon and RQ–4 Global Hawk. The 
base, covering nearly 23,000 acres, is home 
to more than 4,500 military personnel. Beale 
AFB has a unique name and mission, a his-
toric past, and a promising future. Beale Air 
Force Base is the very best our Nation has to 
offer. Its strategic importance stands as a bea-
con of hope to our allies and a stern reminder 
of American resolve to our enemies. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Na-
tion and all the constituents of California’s 
Third Congressional District, I would like to 
thank the men and women of Beale Air Force 
Base and express my sincere gratitude for 
their contributions to the Yuba Sutter commu-
nity, and to the defense of this great Nation.

PAYING 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
GIUSEPPE 
‘‘JOE’’ QUATTRONE, HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES BARBER 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want to 
honor a remarkable constituent of Maryland’s 
Fifth Congressional District who is beloved by 
me and many others on Capitol Hill: House of 
Representatives Barber Giuseppe Quattrone, 
more commonly known as ‘Joe Q.’ After a rich 
career of 52 years, he recently announced his 
retirement. 
Joe has cut hair on the Hill for more than a 
fifth of American history. Indeed, he has 
worked in the Capitol five years longer than 
the most senior senator and more than ten 
years longer than the most senior House 
Member. From Presidents Gerald Ford and 
George H.W. Bush to Congressional leaders 
like Speaker Tip O’Neal and Senator Ted Ken-
nedy, those at the forefront of American poli-
tics have frequented Joe’s barbershop in the 
Rayburn Building. 
Joe’s story is an American story—and not 
just because of his impressive clientele. He 
grew up in Archi, Reggio Calabria, in Southern 
Italy under Mussolini’s rule but dreamed of 
making it to America, just as his older brother 
had done. As fate would have it, America 
came to him. During the Second World War, 
Joe and his family would hide in local caves 
to escape the aerial bombing. When they 
emerged from the cave one morning in 1943, 
they found a U.S. Navy armada that stretched 
all the way to the horizon. Joe went down to 
the beach and waved an American flag to wel-
come the liberators. In time, Joe would be 
able to call that flag his own. 
A few years after the war, Joe joined his 
brother in America where he quickly became 
a naturalized citizen. I first met him in 1966 
when Joe helped me campaign for State Sen-
ate in Maryland, and I was grateful for his as-
sistance and his support. Later, in 1970, he 
began his work as a barber for the House of 
Representatives. His barbershop has served 
as an oasis for Democrats and Republicans 
alike ever since—one of the few places free of 
partisanship left on the Hill. Joe’s clients didn’t 
come to talk politics; they came to enjoy his 
wit and geniality. 
Joe’s story is not just a paragon of the 
American dream but also a testament to the 
dedicated support staff who serve behind the 
scenes to help Congress function. Although 
they do not draft legislation or vote on amend-
ments, their work is no less important. Wheth-
er cleaning the Capitol, serving food, or cutting 
hair, they do their jobs so we can do ours rep-
resenting our constituents. 
I ask all my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating Joe on his well-deserved retirement 
and in thanking him and the many other sup-
port workers who enrich our lives here on 
Capitol Hill. Although Members of Congress 
often have trouble reaching consensus, we 
can all agree that we will miss seeing Joe 
roam the halls. 
HONORING DETECTIVE JAMIE R. 
HUNTLEY-PARK 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the late San Diego Police Depart-
ment (SDPD) Detective Jamie R. Huntley- 
Park. 
A San Diego native, Detective Huntley-Park 
grew up in the La Jolla area, where she ex-
celled as a hockey player, going on to play at 
Elmira College (EC) in New York. At EC, De-
tective Huntley-Park was a four-year letter 
winner on the women’s ice hockey team. She 
helped the EC Soaring Eagles win two East-
ern College Athletic Conference West titles 
and reach the National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation Division III Tournament three times, 
including a runner-up finish as a senior in the 
2009 national championship game. 
Detective Huntley-Park was honored as a 
member of the All-ECAC West Second Team 
after scoring a career-high 40 points (19g– 
21a) in her senior season. She also spent two 
seasons as an outfielder on the softball team. 
As a sophomore in 2007, Detective Huntley- 
Park started 18 games and recorded nine hits, 
14 runs, and a team-high eight stolen bases. 
Additionally, Detective Huntley-Park earned a 
master’s degree in Criminal Justice. 
In 2012, Detective Huntley-Park enrolled as 
a recruit in the San Diego Police Academy. It 
was there where she would meet her future 
husband, and fellow recruit, SDPD Detective 
Ryan Park. They married in February of 2016 
and were both promoted to homicide detec-
tives on the same day two years later. Detec-
tive Huntley-Park went on to work in the 
SDPD Southern Division, her husband, Detec-
tive Park, in the SDPD Homicide Unit. 
Amongst her peers, Detective Huntley-Park 
was tremendously respected. Her rapid ascent 
to a homicide detective in the department’s 
Southern Division was a testament to her abil-
ity as an officer as well as her desire to serve 
the public. She gracefully and diligently upheld 
this promise to her community until her End of 
Watch on June 4, 2021. 
Detective Huntley-Park also gave back to 
her community through the sport she loved, 
coaching and refereeing girl’s hockey during 
her free time. She was a referee for USA 
Hockey, the International Ice Hockey Federa-
tion, and the National Women’s Hockey 
League. She was a role model for many girls 
and young women in Southern California, she 
coached several age groups in the San Diego 
Angels and Jr. Gulls programs. Detective 
Huntley-Park also made history as part of the 
first-ever all-female officiating crew for the 
2021 National Women’s Hockey League 
(NWHL) season. 
As an official, Detective Huntley-Park had 
worked for the NWHL since its inaugural sea-
son in 2015. She also gained significant expe-
rience in big games on the international stage. 
She officiated three International Ice Hockey 
Federation (IIHF) Women’s World Champion-
ships in 2015, 2016, and 2019, and, before 
her passing, bad been assigned to work the 
2021 championship tournament in August. De-
tective Huntley-Park was a giving community 
member who will be remembered for her self-
lessness and positive character. 
Sadly, both Detective Jamie R. Huntley- 
Park, and her husband Detective Ryan Park, 
were killed when their department vehicle was 
struck head-on by a wrong-way driver. Detec-
tive Huntley-Park is survived by her parents, 
Edward and Cherisse. Detective Park is sur-
vived by his mother, Lana; brother, Justin; and 
father, Richard. 
On behalf of the residents of California’s 
51st Congressional District, I would like to ex-
press my deepest condolences to the family of 
Detective Jamie Huntley-Park. Furthermore, I 
would like to formally extend my sincere grati-
tude to Detective Huntley-Park for her unwav-
ering commitment to providing the highest 
level of service to her community throughout 
her nearly decade-long career with the San 
Diego Police Department. She is greatly 
missed.

HONORING 
THE 
CHARLES 
M. 
SCHULZ 
MUSEUM 
AND 
RE-
SEARCH CENTER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Charles M. 
Schulz Museum and Research Center in cele-
bration of its 20 years of operation in Califor-
nia’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Founded in 2002, the Charles M. Schulz 
Museum and Research Center commemorates 
Charles M. Schulz, creator of the ‘‘Peanuts’’ 
comic strip, and his artwork. As a longtime 
Sonoma County resident, Mr. Schulz made a 
tremendous impact on the community of Santa 
Rosa, and the museum aims to honor the 
famed cartoonist himself as well as his comic 
strip legacy. 
Mr. Schulz, or ‘‘Sparky’’ to those who knew 
him, was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 
1922 and moved to Sonoma County, Cali-
fornia in 1958. He passed away in Santa Rosa 
in 2000 after writing and drawing ‘‘Peanuts’’ 
for almost 50 years. His creations ran in more 
than 2,600 newspapers and he personally cre-
ated and drew 17,897 strips, even after a 
tremor in his hand affected his ability to draw. 
Along with its 20th anniversary, the museum 
plans to honor Mr. Schulz’s 100th birthday on 
November 26, 2022, making this an especially 
eventful year for the institution. 
In the recent years, the museum has 
worked to represent and diversify exhibits, 
speakers, and cartoons. The staff hope to 
honor the memory of Mr. Schulz by encour-
aging a new generation of cartoon artists from 
a variety of backgrounds as the museum con-
tinues to fulfill its mission to encourage under-
standing and appreciation of comic strip art. 
In celebration of its 20th anniversary, the 
museum welcomed more than a dozen profes-
sional cartoonists from Sonoma County for a 
panel discussion and book signings, bringing 
local talent into the mix of those being rep-
resented by the museum. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that the 
Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research 
Center has been a meaningful establishment 
in our community, providing joy and entertain-
ment for so many in our district. Therefore, it 
is fitting and proper that we honor the mu-
seum here today.

HONORING 
THE 
172ND 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF PLEASANT VIEW MIS-
SIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. DAVID ROUZER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, on Sep-
tember 4 of this year Pleasant View Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Sunset Beach, North 
Carolina, will celebrate 172 years, a major his-
torical milestone by any measure. Established 
prior to the American Civil War, the church is 
one of the oldest active historical African- 
American churches in the Southeast Region of 
the United States and is the mother church of 
several churches in the local area. 
In the year 1850, a group of devoted Chris-
tians assembled together and organized the 
church. A bush shelter was constructed on 
property purchased in Hickory Hall, now 
known as Calabash, North Carolina. The 
group agreed to the name Pleasant View Mis-
sionary Baptist Church. The first pastor was 
Reverend Bateman. The first ordained deacon 
was Deacon Sam Satchel. 
For the past ten years, Pleasant View Mis-
sionary Baptist has been under the leadership 
of Pastor Nathan Vereen, who continues the 
church’s legacy of great evangelical outreach, 
worship and service to the community. While 
many churches were no longer meeting in per-
son during the height of the Covid–19 pan-
demic, Pastor Vereen continued worship in 
person while implementing and maintaining 
critical safety measures. Pastor Vereen con-
tinues to lead the church by prioritizing youth 
ministry, community outreach, and serving oth-
ers. 
Since its founding, Pleasant View Mis-
sionary Baptist has stood the test of time be-
cause of the church’s adherence to the Word 
of God and work to spread the Gospel. The 
church’s foundational roots are held firm by 
her commitment to our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. 
I am proud to represent this dedicated con-
gregation and the leadership of Pleasant View 
Missionary Baptist Church in the U.S. House 
of Representatives. One hundred seventy-two 
years of Godly worship, instruction and service 
is a notable achievement in our country’s his-
tory. May God continue to bless this church, 
her members, and outreach for years to come.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF ADAIAH CURRY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of Adaiah Curry. 
Adaiah Curry graduated with a Bachelor of 
Science degree in Accounting in 2008 and ob-
tained a Master’s in Business Administration in 
2014. He was a member of the Mississippi 
Valley State University track and field team as 
well as men’s basketball team from 2003 to 
2007. After completing his undergraduate, he 
worked in the Office of Admissions at MVSU 
from 2008 to 2010. He later became a Grad 
Assistant under Sean Woods MVSU Men’s 
Head Basketball Coach and an Assistant 
Coach under Chico Potts and Andre Payne. 
After leaving the MVSU family, Adaiah Curry 
continued his career as a coach and teacher 
at Leland High School. Adaiah Curry later ob-
tained a job where he currently worked at 
Amite County. While at Amite County he was 
fortunate enough to make a deep run into the 
state boys’ basketball tournament, and later in 
2022 he was able to win a state championship 
in track and field. He was also a member of 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Adaiah Curry.

HONORING WORLD WAR II VET-
ERAN PAUL LANDSBERG ON HIS 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 26, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100th birthday of a decorated 
World War II veteran and community servant, 
Mr. Paul Landsberg of Rochester Hills, Michi-
gan. 
Paul was born on August 31, 1922 in De-
troit. His family moved to Pennsylvania when 
he was young but returned in time for him to 
attend the University of Detroit and the Univer-
sity of Michigan, where he was a member of 
the wrestling team. 
Like many brave young men of his genera-
tion, he put his collegiate studies on hold in 
1943 to join the Navy, where he volunteered 
for submarine service. After completing boot 
camp at Great Lakes Naval Base, he was se-
lected to participate in a fire control training 
program, which preceded his 16-week sub-
mariner training. Paul shipped out on the USS 
Blower, but after departing from New London, 
Connecticut, the Blower was damaged when it 
collided with a ship and had to return home for 
repairs. The Blower was damaged a second 
time going through the Panama Canal, play-
ing, leapfrog with 2 other submarines. During 
this trip, the submarine’s braking system for 
the diesel engines failed to operate, creating a 
vacuum inside the sub. A quick-thinking motor 
machinist on board opened the engine air in-
duction, flooding the sub with enough water to 
stop the engines. Paul recalls that when the 
reverse current relay kicked down, it could 
have easily killed all 108 aboard. The incident 
caused significant damage to the 8-cylinder 
dinky and caused Paul to lose his hearing, but 
he continued on in his dedication to be of 
service to his Nation. Paul and his crew 
trained for a month in Pearl Harbor, then left 
for Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. 
From there the Blower sailed to Australia, and 
when the war ended, the sub and its crew pa-
trolled IndoChina before serving occupational 
forces in Japan. In the course of its service, 
the crew brought 2 Japanese subs back to 
Pearl Harbor for analysis by the Navy. Paul 
was awarded the American Campaign Medal, 
the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the 
World War II Victory Medal, as well as several 
unit level commendations, before being honor-
ably discharged in March, 1946. 
Paul returned to Detroit, Michigan where he 
worked at Montgomery Ward for several years 
before leaving to become a draftsman. He 
eventually started his own heating, cooling 
and ventilation company, PLS Mechanical. He 
proudly hung up his hat and retired in 2001, 
after three decades of serving the community 
in business. 
Of all his accomplishments, one of the most 
significant was his marriage to IdaRuth 
Chernoff, whom he loved deeply for 67 years. 
Together they raised their four children around 
metropolitan Detroit. As he approaches the 
century mark, Paul remains a regular figure 
around Rochester Hills on his bike, and still 
drives himself to his great grandchildren’s soc-
cer, baseball and wrestling events. He is look-
ing forward to attending the graduation cere-
mony of his great grandson from Army Na-
tional Guard boot camp. He has a dem-
onstrated talent and love for woodworking and 
is especially proud of the cradle he made that 
has been used by all 24 of his great grand-
children. He has volunteered with local organi-
zations including Meals on Wheels and the 
Optimist Club and has been active in local 
government service. Paul has some advice for 
people looking for the secret to longevity that 
we would all do well to heed: spend time with 
family and friends, and always find something 
to do that helps others. 
Paul has set an inspirational precedent for 
all who know him, including his colleagues, his 
community, and his large and loving family. 
Today, I honor Paul for his service and com-
mitment to his family, his country, and the 
many communities and organizations he has 
helped to uplift over the course of his long and 
fruitful life. It is my distinct privilege to cele-
brate the longevity of his life and the immense 
impact he has had on so many over the past 
century. May we honor Paul for his willingness 
to go above and beyond the call of duty in 
both his military service and his personal pur-
suits. May these words stand as an enduring 
tribute to a life lived in the service of others.
