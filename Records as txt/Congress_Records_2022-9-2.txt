RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following resigna-

tives: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, August 31, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I hereby resign my 
office as the Representative for Florida’s 
13th Congressional District, effective today, 
Wednesday, August 31, 2022. I have also at-
tached my official resignation letter that 
has been transmitted to the Governor of 
Florida. It has been an honor and privilege 
to represent my childhood home of Pinellas 
County, Florida. 
I have always made it my top priority to 
improve the lives of my bosses—the residents 
of Florida’s 13th Congressional District. This 
has been reflected in my legislative prior-
ities, some of which, through your leader-
ship, I am proud to have seen become law 
and already positively impact the American 
people. This includes laws that have: 
1. Expanded and enhanced Veteran Treat-
ment Courts to get Veterans who find them-
selves in the criminal justice system into 
treatment instead of jail time; 
2. Created an Interagency Spam Calls Task 
Force to crack down on illegal phishing and 
scam calls; 
3. Extended the Solar Tax Credit for 10 
years so that residents of the Sunshine State 
can better afford to put solar on their roofs; 
4. Protected Coast Guard retiree pay in the 
event of a future government shutdown; and, 
5. Made survivors of domestic violence eli-
gible for waived costs when replacing critical 
documents that are lost while escaping an 
abuser, such as social security cards, driver’s 
licenses, and birth certificates. 
As a member of the House Appropriations 
Committee, I have focused heavily on get-
ting resources and funding directly to the 
community I represent, securing millions in 
Community Project Funding for local gov-
ernments and non-profit organizations. My 
office has also worked tirelessly to restore 
earned 
benefits 
and 
resources 
back 
to 
Pinellas residents, helping return over $11 
million to the people of FL-13, including over 
$3 million in Veterans’ benefits. 
I sincerely thank every person who has 
helped me serve my neighbors since I was 
first sworn-in in January 2017, including 
community leaders, local elected officials, 
my colleagues in the Florida Delegation, fel-
low Members of my Committees, Majority 
Whip Clyburn, Majority Leader Hoyer, and 
you, Madam Speaker. 
During my time in Congress, I have made 
a point to treat all people with respect, even 
if we may disagree, while also standing up 
for my constituents and being their voice in 
Washington. 
Devotion to service, listening before speak-
ing, treating others how you want to be 
treated—these are all things this country

E891 
September 2, 2022 
RECOGNIZING THE COMMUNITY OF 
ODESSA AND MIDLAND, TEXAS 
AND ITS MEDICAL LEADERSHIP 
ON THE 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE 
AUGUST 
31, 
2019 
MASS 
SHOOTING 
HON. AUGUST PFLUGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the victims of the August 31, 
2019 mass shooting event in Odessa and Mid-
land, Texas, recognize the citizens of these 
communities, and thank the EMS and other 
first responders, hospitals, emergency rooms 
and trauma centers, as well as city leadership. 
I commend the preparedness of those who 
were flooded with casualties, and wish to em-
phasize the importance of medical leadership 
and preparedness throughout the United 
States. 
Medical and law enforcement throughout the 
area were propelled into action during this 
shooting event, including city EMS medical di-
rector Dr. Sudip Bose, Incident Commander 
Chief Rodd Huber; Odessa Fire Rescue Chief 
John Alvarez; Medical Center Hospital CEO 
Russell Tippin; the men and women of the 
Odessa Police Department and the city’s 
SWAT team; Texas Highway Patrol officers; 
Midland Police; trauma teams, first respond-
ers, nurses, administrators, citizens, and so 
many unnamed others throughout the area 
who provided aid where and when they could. 
The seven victims include 15-year-old Leilah 
Hernandez, 40-year-old Joseph Griffith, 29- 
year-old Mary Granados, 25-year-old Edwin 
Peregrino, 57-year-old Rodolfo Julio Arco, 30- 
year-old Kameron Karltess Brown, 35-year-old 
Raul Garcia. 25 others were injured, including 
three police officers. 
Every city needs to formulate a prepared-
ness and response plan for a mass casualty 
event. 
Medical leadership is paramount. 
A multiagency team, created years in ad-
vance, was the driving force behind getting a 
plan in place before the Odessa-Midland area 
shooting took place. This team was medically 
led by Dr. Sudip Bose, an emergency physi-
cian double board certified in emergency med-
icine and EMS (disaster medicine). After the 
horrific event, he used his expertise as a 
former front-line Army medical officer who 
treated casualties in the battle of Fallujah, Iraq 
to address world leaders at the United Nations 
General Assembly on how to keep cities safe 
before and after medical disasters. 
Given the risks to all involved, it is impera-
tive that communities and first responders 
make rational risk/reward decisions about 
when and how to handle an active shooter 
and provide medical care to victims during and 
after an event. This kind of action does not 
happen without prior preparation and practice. 
I am proud to know the preparedness for 
this kind of event is a priority in the Odessa- 
Midland area, and I am proud to represent the 
citizens, police and medical respondents who 
handled those innocently caught in the field of 
fire of the perpetrator. We must continue to 
champion preparedness training and ensure 
our medical leaders are equipped with the 
tools they need to address any situation that 
comes through their door.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
CHASE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Robert Chase, a World War II vet-
eran who passed away in early July at the age 
of 95. Born in 1926 in Lynn, Massachusetts 
and later residing in Rollinsford, Robert was a 
veteran, active member of his community, and 
a beloved father, grandfather, and great- 
grandfather. 
As a young patriot, Robert enlisted in the 
U.S. Army at the age of 18 to fight in World 
War II, where he bravely fought with the 
102nd Infantry Division in Europe. Robert was 
awarded a bronze star for bravery early in his 
career. He continued to serve his country in 
the years after the war as an officer and com-
bat engineer in the 101st Engineers Division 
and as an officer in the Air Defense Com-
mand. 
Following the conclusion of his service in 
1969, Robert worked diligently in business for 
different companies before he founded the NH 
Clinic for Hypnosis in 1980. There he helped 
the people of New Hampshire with a variety of 
treatments, including helping Granite Staters 
quit smoking. He especially loved performing 
his hypnosis for local schools. He was also an 
avid woodworker, restored antiques, and loved 
hosting his annual yard sale for his entire 
neighborhood. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I wish to 
share my condolences with Bob’s family, in-
cluding his late wife Dorothy, their three sons 
and daughter-in-laws, two daughters and son- 
in-laws, eight grandchildren, and six great 
grandchildren. As we recognize Mr. Chase, I 
ask my colleagues in the House of Represent-
atives to join me in honoring his rich life and 
legacy.

HONORING THE SIXTH FLOOR 
MUSEUM STAFF 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my sincere appreciation to the 
staff of The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey 
Plaza in Dallas, Texas. My Washington and 
district staff joined me there recently to take a 
highly informative tour.

took the time to meet with the hospitable staff 
at The Sixth Floor Museum. From our first 
meeting inquiry, Ms. Nicola Longford—Chief 
Executive Officer, graciously welcomed us to 
visit the museum. Other museum staff who 
were instrumental in arranging our visit were: 
Mr. Tim Case—Director of Operations and 
Special Initiatives, Mr. Steve Warden—Oper-
ations Manager, and Mr. David Ontiveros—As-
sistant Operations Manager. 
We were fortunate to be greeted by Ms. 
Kimberly Camuel Bryan—Chief Philanthropy 
Officer, and to have our tour personally con-
ducted by Mr. Stephen Fagin—Curator. The 
Sixth Floor Museum is located in the former 
Texas School Book Depository building in Dal-
las. On the morning of November 22, 1963, 
Texas School Book Depository employee Lee 
Harvey Oswald, retrieved a rifle from a cached 
hiding spot, and took a position in the corner 
of a sixth floor window overlooking the publicly 
pre-announced motorcade route for President 
John F. Kennedy through downtown Dallas. 
As the Presidential motorcade slowly turned 
from Houston Street onto Elm Street, the 
crowds gathered below started excitedly wav-
ing and greeting President Kennedy and First 
Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Oswald is pre-
sumed to have opened fire on the automobiles 
below. Bullets struck and killed President Ken-
nedy and wounded Texas Governor John 
Connally as the cars traveled through Dealey 
Plaza. 
The Sixth Floor Museum reimagines that 
tragic event forever fatefully ingrained in the 
hearts and minds of the citizens and leaders 
of Dallas. During our tour, Mr. Fagin pointed 
out the photographs, film clips, artifacts, scale 
models and displays that document the assas-
sination and thoughtfully examine its continued 
impact on the American people and its place 
in our Nation’s history. The museum chron-
icles the life and significant contributions of 
President Kennedy and his administration’s 
legacy. 
I am grateful for the hospitality of The Sixth 
Floor Museum staff and especially appre-
ciative of the time and authoritative expertise 
Mr. Fagin shared with me and my staff. I 
would encourage everyone who has the op-
portunity to visit this historic venue.

friend,’’ died earlier this year on April 1, and 
now is rejoicing in Heaven with our Lord and 
her husband, Jack, who predeceased her and, 
we are sure, received her with wide open 
arms. 
At Jean’s funeral Mass on April 9th, her two 
children John and Mary gave heartwarming, 
moving eulogies. I share them today to re-
member Jean on her birthday through the 
words of her two ‘‘favorite accomplishments.’’ 
The statement of John J. McDermott, III. The 
statement of Mary McDermott Noonan. 
‘‘JEANNE’’ MCDERMOTT: A WOMAN OF UNWAVER-
ING
GUIDING
PRINCIPLES. 
BY
JOHN
J. 
MCDERMOTT, III 
I have recently had the distinct pleasure to 
speak at 2 very special, though different, 
ceremonies: 
My daughter, Tara’s wedding to Sean; and 
My Mother, Jeanne’s heavenly reunion 
with my Father, Jack, her sweetheart of 70 
years. 
JEANNE’S FAITH and GUIDING PRIN-
CIPLES. 
Jeanne Margaret McDermott was a woman 
of strong faith and unwavering guiding prin-
ciples. 
And like Jack, Jeanne was a dedicated 
practicing Catholic, who was devoted to 
Mary, the Blessed Mother. 
Notably, my sister, Mary, was named after 
the Blessed Mother, having been born, not 
coincidentally according to Jeanne, on De-
cember 8th, the Feast Day of the Immacu-
late Conception. 
And at various times, Jeanne regularly at-
tended Mass at: Mary Mother of God in 
Hillsborough, NJ; Queen of Apostles in Alex-
andria, VA; and Immaculate Conception in 
Mauch Chunk, PA. 
And for good measure, her grandson, John-
ny, has spent more than half of his life at 
Notre Dame, the Irish Catholic University of 
Our Lady. 
Known as a first-class communicator, one 
of Jeanne’s guiding principles was that: 
‘‘Do one more version, as you can always 
improve your communication.’’ 
I am sure that this is why, with Jeanne 
looking over my shoulder from up above, I 
have continued to edit these remarks right 
up until game time. 
Another guiding principle for Jeanne was 
her intolerance for anything but the whole 
truth, agreeing with Judge Judy, that: 
‘‘If you tell the truth, you don’t need a 
good memory.’’ 
THE JEANNE WE ALL KNEW. 
Not surprisingly, since her passing, Jeanne 
has been remembered as: ‘‘a very special, 
wife, 
mother, 
grandmother, 
aunt 
and 
friend,’’ 
‘‘a witty wordsmith, one of a kind,’’ 
‘‘a genuine, caring and encouraging lis-
tener,’’ and ‘‘the last great McDermott fam-
ily Outlaw.’’ 
Jeanne was very smart and articulate, 
skipping 3 semesters at Cathedral High and 
earning a full scholarship to Hunter College. 
That was of course, an academic, not ath-
letic, scholarship. 
Jeanne, ever the believer and beneficiary 
of ‘‘chivalry is not dead’’ was also a very suc-
cessful working Mother pioneer in the 1950’s. 
Now, if we were to play a word association 
game ‘‘Jeanne’’ would be the obvious re-
sponse to all of the following: 
Frank Sinatra—JEANNE; Cary Grant— 
JEANNE [you get the picture], Jackie Glea-
son, 
The 
Honeymooners, 
Perry 
Mason, 
snacks during the Late Late Late Show, The 
Bronx, Saks 5th Avenue, the Rockettes and 
the Radio City Christmas Show, Brandy Al-
exanders, Baileys Irish Cream, Mallomars, 
Jell Rings and Hershey Kisses—JEANNE 
And specifically with respect to the last 
few, her passing last week apparently precip-
itated a crash in the chocolate futures mar-
ket, along with a suspension of all trading in 
whipped butter and roast pork related com-
modities. 
THE JEANNE NOT EVERYONE KNEW. 
There are also several lesser-known Jeanne 
tidbits to share: 
—unbeknownst to Jack, Jeanne had his 
wedding ring engraved to say ‘‘to my thick 
Mick!’’ 
—Jeanne picked Daylight Savings Time 
weekend for their wedding date to get an 
extra hour to celebrate; 
—as often as Jeanne talked about how 
much she loved working in the Empire State 
Building, the span of her entire career at 
that iconic edifice was 2 weeks; 
—when Jeanne took a leave of absence 
from her Wall Street employer to give birth 
to me, her firm regularly sent messengers to 
‘‘Jeanne the Grammar Queen’’ in The Bronx 
for her to edit research reports and client 
correspondence; 
—and despite her SAT worthy and cross-
word tested vocabulary, and notwithstanding 
that Jack, Mary and I spent over 50 years in 
organized basketball, Jeanne always referred 
to our sports passion as ‘‘bouncy bouncy, the 
bally;’’ 
—and lastly, another of Jeanne’s guiding 
principles was: 
‘‘Say it with diamonds, say it with mink, 
but never oh never, say it with ink,’’ 
Jeanne uncharacteristically violated this 
one during one of my more profligate peri-
ods, when she memorialized for all posterity 
the following classic lines: 
‘‘Even though you work too hard and too 
long, and probably neglect your schooling to 
do so, you are a financial disaster,’’ 
‘‘I 
raised 
a 
lemon 
and 
I’m 
getting 
squeezed,’’ and 
‘‘I feel like I am standing on the dock wait-
ing for your ship to come in, and then I dis-
cover that the boat has already sailed and 
you are on it.’’ 
BON VOYAGE JEANNE GIRL. 
Well Jeanne, now we are all here at the St 
Anthony’s Dock, and your ship has finally 
come in. 
And you are now sailing to be restored 
atop that infamous pedestal which Jack so 
appropriately put you on all those years ago 
in The Bronx. 
And to use 2 more of your guiding prin-
ciples: 
Firstly, as you now look down us, we sud-
denly realize that what all this really means, 
Is that it really is ‘‘All In The Jeans!’’ 
And secondly, to redeploy a rehearsal din-
ner verse I wrote for you and Jack 37 years 
ago, 
‘‘What I’m most thankful for and hope ev-
eryone sees, 
Is that Mary and I are truly blessed that 
‘Apples Don’t Fall Too Far From The 
Trees!’ ’’ 
MY MOM, THE FABULOUS ‘‘JEANNE’’ 
MCDERMOTT. BY MARY MCDERMOTT NOONAN 
Faith and Love. 
Just two of the timeless gifts that our 
mom, Jean, and our devoted dad, Jack, 
showered upon me—and Johnny—all the 
days of their lives. 
Faith. 
Faith of course, is actually a gift from 
God. But what we do with that gift, how we 
nurture it, is key. 
For me, Jean was the Nurturer in Chief. 
All faith opportunities were embraced and 
made fun. Like daily Mass, often the prelude 
to a stop at the diner. 
And Jean’s strong devotion to the Blessed 
Mother, was passed on to me, albeit in an un-
orthodox way. 
While they were dating, Jean enlisted Jack 
to teach her to drive. After she flunked her 
first road test, they devised a plan. 
Jack would sit in the back seat. And he 
would puff on his cigarette if Jean needed to 
change course. 
The plan was a disaster. Being in the back 
seat, Jack got nervous instantly and puffed 
like a feen. Jean hit the brakes; hit the gas; 
headed left, then right. It was chaos! And 
strike two. 
For her third road test, Jean turned to a 
higher power. 
In her prayers she made a deal with the 
Blessed Mother. ‘‘Please intercede. Help me 
get my license and I will name my first 
daughter Mary.’’ 
It was a true sacrifice as Jean strongly dis-
liked the name Mary. So plain. And in her 
generation—just too many Mary’s. 
She hedged her commitment a little. She 
had come from a broken home so she knew 
she wasn’t getting married; she was never 
having children and if she did, she was only 
having boys. 
Jean took road test #3; she passed with 
ease and drove off into happiness. First stop, 
marital bliss. 
Jean soon gave birth to their first child— 
as 
she 
predicted, 
a 
boy—John 
Jerome 
McDermott the third. A loving son. A pa-
tient brother. 
Three years later, Jean became pregnant 
again. 
‘‘Kenneth’’ was due on Thanksgiving Day, 
but he didn’t budge. 
Days went by and worry set in. The baby’s 
umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck. 
After many hours of labor, praise God, 
baby and mamma survived. It was a miracle. 
Only problem, it’s a girl. ‘‘Kenneth’’ is not 
gonna work. 
As the story goes, it was Jack who re-
minded Jean of her prayer/deal with the 
Blessed Mother. They took note that the 
baby, now 11 days late, was born on Decem-
ber 8th, the Feast of the Immaculate Concep-
tion. 
Coincidence? We think not. The Blessed 
Mother had intervened again, to save Jean 
from a major spiritual mistake. It’s bad for 
the soul to try to outwit the Blessed Mother. 
All my life, my mother has shared with me 
the benefits and blessings of a devotion to 
Mary and Mary’s maternal care for those 
who call on her for help. The Rosary is now 
a staple in my life. And I take great comfort 
in meditating on the apparitions and Mary’s 
visits to planet earth. 
I too turn to the Blessed Mother in big 
things and small. She is a guiding conduit to 
our Lord and she delivers. 
After an accidental mis-engagement to the 
wrong fella, I called upon the Blessed Moth-
er. Please intercede. Bring me my Mr. Right. 
She delivered Jeff Noonan. Right for me; 
and even a little to the right of me! What a 
blessing for me and what at a tremendous 
son-in-law and devoted care giver for Jean. 
Love. 
‘‘My affection once given, is never with-
drawn.’’ 
That was Jean’s mantra and the best safe-
ty net any child could have. 
No matter what we did, and there were 
some doozies-Jean’s love was already secured 
and it would not be withdrawn. 
It was a mother’s commitment that made 
you want to do better; be better. Strive, to 
live up to her unconditional love. 
Jean was not big on going to the doctors 
and after one checkup she was told she had 
an enlarged heart-ie, her heart was too big 
for her body. 
Her retort: ‘‘Really? You needed a medical 
degree to come up with that? I had hoped it 
was obvious.’’ 
It was her life’s mission to love her family, 
love her friends love her faith-and to show it. 
She was generous with her time, her con-
versation, her wit, her talents, her encour-
agement and most of all, her love.

GOLDEN FIRE CHIEF JERRY 
STRICKER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Golden Fire 
Chief Jerry Stricker for his many years of serv-
ice to the City of Golden and surrounding 
communities. 
For three decades, Chief Stricker has been 
active within the Golden community and fire 
department. Prior to coming to Golden, Chief 
Stricker started his career with the Eagle River 
Fire Protection District where he worked as a 
firefighter, 
engineer, 
and 
EMT 
before 
transitioning to the Department of Public Safe-
ty with the town of Avon, Colorado. In 2018, 
Mr. Stricker was awarded Fire Marshal of the 
Year by the Fire Marshals Association of Colo-
rado’s (FMAC) Executive Board. Chief Stricker 
has also served in numerous leadership roles 
within the firefighting community including 
serving as Legislative Committee Chair of the 
FMAC. His hard work and dedication has 
helped make our community—and so many 
others—a great place to live and work. 
I extend my deepest thanks to Chief Stricker 
for his service to our community. I thank him 
for his continuous dedication to serving the 
people of Colorado.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
SIDNEY JOHN BARTHELEMY, A 
CHERISHED 
PUBLIC 
SERVANT 
FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA 
CELEBRATING HIS TENURE AS 
MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW 
ORLEANS FROM 1974 UNTIL 1978 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding, 
cherished public servant from my home State 
of Louisiana. I am proud to say, my dear 
friend and mentor, The Honorable Sidney 
John Barthelemy gave me my first job in city 
government upon graduation from college. As 
an American political figure, he served as the 
second African American to hold the New Or-
leans mayoral chair from 1986 to 1994. He 
was a member of the Louisiana State Senate 
from 1974 to 1978 and a member at-large of 
the New Orleans City Council from 1978 to 
1986. He is a proud member of the Demo-
cratic Party. 
The Honorable Barthelemy was born on 
March 17, 1942, in New Orleans, Louisiana, 
and was the third of six children (Ruth, Lionel, 
Jr., Joyce, Anthony, Felix) in a deep-rooted 
New Orleans family, born to Lionel and Ruth 
(Fernandez) Barthelemy, Sr. He grew up in 
the historic 7th Ward, and attended Corpus 
Christi Elementary School, founded by Saint 
Katharine Drexel, SBS, foundress of The Sis-
ters of the Blessed Sacrament; and St. Augus-
tine High School (New Orleans), run by the 
Josephites Fathers and Brothers. 
He then sought to enter the priesthood with 
the Josephites, studying at Epiphany Apostolic 
Junior College in Newburgh, New York, and 
then St. Joseph Seminary in Washington, 
D.C., where he received a Bachelor of Arts 
degree in philosophy and pursued graduate 
study in theology. While in the seminary, he 
worked summers as a laborer in a stevedoring 
company. 
In 1967, having made the decision not to 
enter the priesthood, Honorable Barthelemy 
returned to New Orleans and became an ad-
ministrative assistant in the office of Total 
Community Action. In 1968, Barthelemy mar-
ried Michaele ‘‘Mickey’’ Thibodeaux. They are 
the proud parents of Cherrie, Bridget, and Sid-
ney, Jr. From 1969 to 1972, he was director 
of the Parent Child Center of Family Health, 
Inc. During these years, he also completed a 
Master of Social Work degree at Tulane Uni-
versity in New Orleans, worked part-time for 
the Urban League of Greater New Orleans, 
and assisted with various political campaigns, 
joining COUP (The Community Organization 
for Urban Politics), a political organization 
based in the 7th Ward of New Orleans. 
From 1972 to 1974, Barthelemy was Direc-
tor of the Department of Welfare under Mayor 
Moon Landrieu. Backed by COUP, Barthelemy 
was elected in 1974 to one term in the Lou-
isiana State senate from District 4, defeating a 
White incumbent who had held the seat for 
sixteen years. He was the first African Amer-
ican to serve in that body since Reconstruc-
tion. While he served in the Legislature, he 
also joined Xavier University of Louisiana as 
assistant director of the Urb-involve Program 
and as an instructor in the Department of So-
ciology. He became an adjunct faculty mem-
ber in the Applied Health Sciences Depart-
ment, Maternal and Child Health Section, of 
Tulane University. 
In 1978 Barthelemy was elected to an at- 
large seat on the New Orleans City Council, a 
position he held for two terms. Sidney 
Barthelemy first set his sights on becoming 
mayor of New Orleans in 1982, when he was 
re-elected to the city council. Barthelemy re-
ceived 58 percent of the total votes cast. On 
May 5, 1986, Barthelemy began his first term 
as mayor of New Orleans. 
Barthelemy’s 
administration 
experienced 
economic development successes, as he 
managed to bring additional investment to 
New Orleans East, most notably a distribution 
center to the New Orleans Regional Business 
Park (then known as the Almonaster-Michoud 
Industrial District). This project embodied the 
city’s renewed efforts to leverage the existing 
infrastructure of the Port of New Orleans, then 
experiencing 
a 
resurgence 
by 
attracting 
modem warehousing and distribution facilities 
to the city. In the wake of the oil bust, the 
Barthelemy administration most forcefully ad-
vocated for the continued development of New 
Orleans’ tourist and convention industry. Tour-
ism was the only sector of the city’s economy 
to 
exhibit 
meaningful 
growth 
under 
Barthelemy. Several high-profile wins oc-
curred, including attracting the Republican Na-
tional Convention to the city in 1988 and the 
NCAA 
Final 
Four 
tournament 
in 
1993. 
Barthelemy also oversaw the opening of the 
Aquarium of the Americas, the Riverfront 
streetcar line, the New Orleans Centre and 
Riverwalk downtown malls, and encouraged 
the first expansion of the Ernest N. Morial 
Convention Center. 
In 
administering 
city 
government, 
Barthelemy managed to gradually eliminate 
the $30 million budget deficit he inherited in 
1986. He also staffed agencies such as the 
Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) 
and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA). 
Other notable narratives of the Barthelemy 
administration included the visit of Pope John 
Paul II to New Orleans in 1987, the passage 
of the controversial ‘‘anti-discrimination’’ ordi-
nance affecting the membership in Carnival 
krewes, an unsuccessful, city-sponsored effort 
to redevelop Louis Armstrong Park into a 
recreation park/amusement center; the post- 
World’s Fair redevelopment of the downtown 
Warehouse District; and the securing of fund-
ing for a new sports arena next to the Super-
dome. Consistent with the city’s increasing 
economic tilt to tourism and the cultural econ-
omy, Barthelemy’s mayoralty also supported a 
large addition to the New Orleans Museum of 
Art, re-use of portions of the former Canadian 
Pavilion of the World’s Fair into the IMAX the-
ater, as well as the creation of the Louisiana 
Children’s Museum in the Warehouse District. 
Throughout his political career, Barthelemy 
carried a reputation as a quiet and mild-tem-
pered 
politician. 
In 
2012, 
then 
City 
Councilmember Cynthia Hedge Morrell ac-
knowledged Honorable Barthelemy during an 
event at Gallier Hall stating, ‘‘The City of New 
Orleans would not be where it is today if those 
tough decisions were not made and you had 
not had the fortitude to endure the wrath of 
the media and the wrath of people who did not 
understand’’ that ‘‘good decisions were being 
made for the future of our city’’. As a re-
spected former mayor, Barthelemy joined 
other former mayors, Moon Landrieu and Marc 
Morial, in a meeting on January 7, 2006, with 
parish presidents from the New Orleans met-
ropolitan area to discuss post-Katrina plans for 
regional flood protection. He recently retired 
as Director of Governmental Affairs for Historic 
Restoration, Inc. (HRI Properties), a real es-
tate development group based in New Orle-
ans. 
Madam Speaker, I credit my role as a Mem-
ber of Congress today, because of the oppor-
tunities and guidance I received from the Hon-
orable Sidney Barthelemy. I am humbly grate-
ful for his mentorship, as I celebrate his tenure 
as a leader in the great State of Louisiana.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Lynne Egan, a

dedicated her public service to combatting 
fraud wherever it might be found. 
Ms. Egan brought her wonderful sense of 
humor, infectious can-do attitude, and pride in 
a job well done to the many initiatives she 
brought forth both at home and across the Na-
tion. 
Notably, one of Ms. Egan’s initiatives was 
working with the Montana Legislature to estab-
lish the Securities Restitution Assistance Fund 
to help investors who had lost everything re-
coup a portion of what they had lost. Since its 
inception, this fund has returned over $7 mil-
lion to Montana investors. 
Ms. Egan embodied the highest ideals of 
public service in the State of Montana as she 
used her gifts to combat financial fraud and 
elder exploitation—issues that continue to 
harm Americans, costing the citizenry over 
$5.8 billion per year. 
Ms. Egan’s selfless commitment to serving 
Montanans will always be a defining pillar of 
her legacy.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF COLLIN HAGAN 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
privilege to honor the life and service of Collin 
Hagan, whose young life was cut short while 
battling a wildfire in Oregon. Through his cour-
age, selflessness, and extreme dedication to 
the public good, Collin became an indispen-
sable part of the communities he served in 
Michigan and beyond. 
A native Yooper, Collin was born in Han-
cock, Michigan on July 20, 1995. He was 
raised in Twin Lakes and graduated from Jef-
fers High School in 2013. With a deep-rooted 
desire to serve others, Collin furthered his 
education at Gogebic Community College in 
Ironwood and Michigan Technological Univer-
sity (MTU) in Houghton, where he earned his 
Bachelor of Science in Forestry. In college, 
Collin gained forestry field experience while 
working as an intern with Compass Land Con-
sultants, Inc. in northern Wisconsin and the 
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Upon graduation 
from MTU, Collin pursued his passion for 
wildland firefighting. After a brief stint at 
Grayback Forestry in LaGrande, Oregon, he 
worked for two seasons on a Type 2 crew with 
the United States Forest Service at Flathead 
National Forest in Montana. His aspirations to 
become a hotshot firefighter came true this 
season when he was hired by the Bureau of 
Land Management to work on the Craig Inter-
agency Hotshot Crew based in Craig, Colo-
rado. Not only was Collin skilled in the art of 
felling trees; he also enjoyed assisting others 
in learning the profession. 
Collin passed away on August 10, 2022 
from injuries received while battling the Big 
Swamp Fire at Willamette National Forest in 
Oregon. His compassion, selflessness, and 
devotion to his community will surely leave a 
lasting mark on those who had the opportunity 
to know him. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Collin Hagan. His 
legacy will forever live on in his family, friends, 
crewmembers, and in the many lives he 
bettered through his service.

SHERRY EMS 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Sherry Ems for her dedication 
and service to our State, our Nation, and our 
servicemembers working as the Executive Di-
rector at the United Services Organizations 
Ohio these last seven years. 
For many service men and women, the 
USO offers the comforts of home: a place to 
rest or a meal to eat, as they ship off to an-
other duty station, return from a long journey 
from a faraway base, or prepare to deploy. 
Sherry’s service was a bright beacon of hope, 
integrity, and diligence. 
She is exemplary of the patriotism and com-
mitment we associate with the USO. Over the 
many years she served, Sherry’s contributions 
went a long way towards supporting our serv-
ice men and women. She embodies the civic 
pride we have in our troops and our nation. 
I thank her for her tremendous work and 
service over the years at the USO and for our 
men and women in uniform, and we all wish 
her the best in her future endeavors.

OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the 20th anniversary of the formal 
partnership between the United States Air 
Force’s 55th Wing and the Nebraska Air Na-
tional Guard’s 170th Group at Offutt Air Force 
Base in Nebraska. The anniversary occurred 
on the 3rd of June this year and was the first- 
of-its kind as the oldest association between 
the Air National Guard and an active-duty 
combat-coded Air Force Wing. 
The first unit member of the 170th Group is 
now retired Air Force Air National Guard Major 
General Rick Evans who arrived at Offutt Air 
Force Base on June 3, 2002, to set up and 
command what was initially Detachment 1 of 
the Nebraska Air National Guard. Later, the 
170th Group was formed to expand the mis-
sion capabilities of Detachment 1 into two 
squadrons: the 238th Combat Training Squad-
ron which provided combat aircrew training 
support for the 55th Wing, and the 170th Op-
erations Support Squadron which provided 
vital support to 55th Wing missions in the 
areas of weapons and tactics, intelligence, 
base operations, weather, and aviation re-
source management. 
The extraordinary 20-year partnership be-
tween the 170th Group and the 55th Wing has 
enabled and sustained combat and sensitive 
reconnaissance operations supporting the War 
on Terror and other national missions around 
the globe. Today, the 170th Group is pre-
paring to expand its mission yet again with 
two additional squadrons that will expand its 
aircraft maintenance and intelligence support 
capabilities. 
I am truly honored as a former 55th Wing 
Commander to have witnessed firsthand the 
operational impacts of the 170th Group. These 
outstanding Airmen ensure the daily success 
of the 55th Wing’s demanding global mission 
and are recognized across the Air Force com-
munity for their leadership in forging a world- 
class Active Duty and Air National Guard part-
nership. 
I salute the visionary leadership of those 
who designed the 170th Group over 20 years 
ago and all those who have served in its units 
to the present day. Congratulations on 20 
years of success and the many more to come.

RECOGNIZING PROTEUS 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the work of Proteus, an essen-
tial non-profit organization in the Central Val-
ley, as they celebrate their 55th anniversary. 
In the 1960s, the Tulare County Community 
Action Agency formed Proteus Adult Training 
to address rampant poverty among farm-
workers and impoverished adults—primarily 
through literacy programs. In 1972, Proteus 
would be incorporated as an independent non- 
profit organization and continue its core mis-
sion to provide education, job training, and 
support services that empower people to 
achieve self-sufficiency. 
In 1978, Proteus began expanding outside 
of Tulare County and started to address pov-
erty throughout the Central Valley. In 1994, 
Proteus opened its first vocational school, of-
fering Shipping and Receiving classes. They 
received their accreditation in 1995 and have 
been expanding their classes into areas such 
as Truck Driving, Forklift Training, and Energy 
Career Training. Today, Proteus also offers 
academic courses such as Adult Basic Edu-
cation and English as Second Language 
through its William M. Maguy School of Edu-
cation. 
Throughout its 55 years of work, Proteus 
has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to im-
prove the lives of the disenfranchised through 
its local, regional, and national partnerships 
with governments, other non-profit organiza-
tions, and corporations. With 30 different loca-
tions throughout Tulare, Kern, Fresno, and 
Kings counties, as well as in East Los Ange-
les, Proteus continues to lift people out of pov-
erty and put the less fortunate on a pathway 
to financial stability. 
I ask all of my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Pro-
teus as it celebrates its 55-year anniversary.

INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR 
ELECTORAL 
SYSTEMS 
(IFES) 
RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT FOR 
UKRAINE 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Inter-
national Foundation for Electoral Systems 
(IFES) and to place the following statement 
from IFES in the RECORD. 
RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 
The Board of Directors of the International 
Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), 
meeting in Arlington, Virginia, USA on this 
15th day of March 2022, does hereby declare 
its full support for the people of Ukraine, 
and the sovereignty, independence and terri-
torial integrity of Ukraine. 
The Board of Directors condemns the inva-
sion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation as 
a flagrant act of aggression and violation of 
international law, including the Helsinki 
Final Act and the United Nations Charter. 
Since Ukraine became an independent 
country more than 30 years ago, its people 
have repeatedly chosen the path of freedom 
and democracy. Over the course of three dec-
ades, IFES has been honored to support 
Ukrainians in their efforts to strengthen and 
safeguard their democracy. The Board of Di-
rectors of IFES affirms its continued soli-
darity with the Ukrainian people, who are 
bravely resisting this unprovoked assault on 
their freedom and democracy. 
The Board of Directors pays tribute to the 
contributions of current and former IFES 
staff in Ukraine who have helped to build 
Ukrainian democracy. We stand in solidarity 
with these IFES staff, with the Central Elec-
tion Commission of Ukraine, and with our 
civil society partners and the members of 
the public institutions with whom we work. 
The Board of Directors further recognizes 
the important work of those fighting for de-
mocracy and human rights in and around 
Russia and Belarus, especially those who 
have worked to oppose the invasion of 
Ukraine. 
The IFES Board of Directors eagerly looks 
forward to the day when peace in Ukraine, 
and respect for the sovereign and democratic 
rights of the Ukrainian people are restored. 
We pledge to stand with the people of 
Ukraine now and in the future.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF DR. 
RICHARD RUSSELL 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Dr. Richard 
Russell. Dr. Richard H. Russell died on Au-
gust 28, 2022. He was born on May 3, 1942 
in his family home in the Hurricane Commu-
nity in Pontotoc County. He was the youngest 
child born to Robert Kendall Russell and Ida 
Warren Russell, who were 63 and 42 respec-
tively on the date of his birth. He had nine sib-
lings whom he knew and two who died before 
his birth. He survived all of them. He leaves 
his wife, Jackie Bass Russell, three children, 
Regan Russell (Mary Jennifer); Sandy Sullivan 
(Vic) and Melissa Russell, and four grand-
children, Sylvie Russell, Will Sullivan, George 
Sullivan and Paige Carruth. 
Dr. Russell graduated valedictorian from the 
Hurricane school system in 1960, top of his 
class at the University of Mississippi School of 
Pharmacy in 1965, and in 1971 from the Uni-
versity of Mississippi Medical School in Jack-
son, where he simultaneously worked as a 
part-time pharmacist and taught pharmacology 
to nursing students at St. Dominic Hospital. 
He served a one-year internship in Savannah, 
Georgia, where a staff physician called the 
Mississippi 
doctors 
(including 
Dr. 
Sam 
Creekmore) the best interns they had ever 
had, before choosing New Albany as his for-
ever home. He never thereafter doubted that 
he had made a wise choice. 
At the Union County Hospital, later Baptist 
Memorial-Union County, he proudly delivered 
approximately 2,000 babies, co-ran the emer-
gency room night and day for seven years, 
served as New Albany’s first I.C.U. Director, 
served three terms as Chief of Staff, and 
played an instrumental role in convincing Bap-
tist to take over the Union County Hospital. He 
was very proud that the New Albany Medical 
Community grew from five doctors the day be-
fore he and Dr. Creekmore arrived to a thriv-
ing local medical community with a hospital re-
cently voted the Best Small Hospital in the 
State of Mississippi. He also served his com-
munity in various ways, including as the Union 
County Republican Chairman and on the New 
Albany School Board. 
Richard was born into a rich community 
where he was surrounded by family and 
friends, and he carried a love of community all 
through his life. During his thirty-nine years of 
practice as a Family Practice Physician in 
New Albany, Verona and at the University of 
Mississippi, he rarely passed a day without 
meeting someone he called a cousin, and he 
never went a day without meeting someone 
he called friend. He was loved by many of his 
patients because of his fondness for them, his 
familiarity with their families and family his-
tories, and his gentle and friendly spirit. A 
pharmaceutical salesman once added that you 
could always count of Dr. Russell to tell you 
‘‘one good joke—and two bad ones’’. 
In his later years Dr. Russell often reflected 
upon how lucky he had been to know so many 
people, to serve them and their families, par-
ticularly in their times of deepest need, many 
times to sit with them in their last moments, 
and to enjoy his patients’ frequent expressions 
of appreciation and affection for him. Madam 
Speaker, Dr. Russell will be missed.

RECOGNIZING EDWARD AND BREN-
DA BREITMEYER FOR THEIR IN-
DUCTION 
INTO 
THE 
MICHIGAN 
FARMERS HALL OF FAME 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Edward and Brenda 
Breitmeyer for their induction into the Michigan 
Farmers Hall of Fame. Through their dedi-
cated service, contributions to their commu-
nity, and steadfast commitment to the edu-
cation, research, and promotion of agriculture, 
Edward and Brenda have become an indis-
pensable part of Northern Michigan. 
The Michigan Farmers Hall of Fame was 
created to promote excellence in farming and 
recognize those in Michigan who have made 
an extraordinary impact on the industry and 
their communities. None are more deserving 
of this honor than Edward and Brenda. 
Throughout nearly 50 years of farming and 
ranching, Edward has served on several State 
and national farm boards. As a member of the 
Michigan Corn Growers Association, he co-
ordinated meetings to educate local farmers 
and traveled to Lansing and Washington, D.C. 
to promote the interests of corn farmers. While 
participating in the Corn Marketing Program of 
Michigan, he was involved in activities to pro-
mote research and innovation in corn farming. 
He is also a member of the National Corn 
Growers Association, where he has co-chaired 
two teams—Membership Communications and 
Export Utilization. Edward should take im-
mense pride in his service on the U.S. Grains 
Council. In this capacity, he was a member of 
two advisory teams—Communications and 
Value Added. In his long and successful ca-
reer, Edward has tackled the challenges of an 
ever-evolving industry head-on and proven 
himself to be a leader in Michigan’s agricul-
tural sector. 
In addition to their work for Michigan’s agri-
cultural industry, Edward and Brenda have a 
long history of serving their community 
through their work in Buckley area schools, 
the Grand Traverse Conservation District, the 
Grant Township Planning Commission, the 
Grant Township Board of Appeals, and Re-
deemer Lutheran Church of Interlochen. As 
charter members, Edward and Brenda have 
helped build two churches, and they regularly 
volunteer at the food pantry, Bible study, and 
Sunday school services. 
Agriculture is the second-largest sector of 
Michigan’s economy, and fanning serves a 
vital role for the people and communities of 
Northern Michigan. With today’s ever-changing 
world, the work of industry and community 
leaders like Edward and Brenda has been crit-
ical in shaping Michigan’s agricultural industry 
to the success story it is today. Their impact 
on the people of Michigan cannot be over-
stated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Edward and Brenda Breitmeyer for their 
induction into the Michigan Farmers Hall of 
Fame. Michiganders can take great pride in 
knowing the First District is home to such 
dedicated leaders. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish Edward and Brenda all the best in 
their future endeavors.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Morton High School in Mor-
ton, Illinois. At this school, classes past and 
present have achieved tremendous success 
and a legacy of excellence carried on by the 
students that followed them.

ment has grown, so has the prominence of

‘‘Lady Potter’s’’. In an unprecedented record of 
success in eight seasons from 2015 to 2022, 
the Lady Potters won four Illinois State Cham-
pionships, three in succession. In that time, 
they have won 244 games and only lost 23. 
The Lady Potter’s have been led to victory 
559 times against 159 defeats by the archi-
tect, builder, and coach of the team, Bob 
Becker. Becker has been awarded Coach of 
the Year multiple times by the Illinois High 
School Association and was named to the Illi-
nois basketball coaches’ Hall of Fame in 2020. 
In addition, seven of his Lady Potters have 
gone on to play Division I college basketball. 
A kind, retired Hall of Fame sportswriter 
brought their story to the nation, comparing 
them to the current NBA champions: ‘‘They 
are the Golden State Warriors, only with Pony 
Tails’’. Their accomplishments also garnered 
public praise in a CBS’ 60 Minutes feature. 
With 2022 marking the 50th anniversary of 
Title IX, which guaranteed the Lady Potter’s 
right to play, there is much to celebrate. The 
Class of ’72 also celebrates their 50th anniver-
sary as graduates of Morton High School this 
year. Morton High School continues to honor 
the legacy of the classes before them and 
their tremendous achievements throughout the 
year. 
Congratulations to classes past and present 
of Morton High School, including the 2022 
Lady Potter’s basketball team. The school 
pride is worthy of celebration. Keep up the 
good work.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF JO-
SEPH 
MCCOY 
AND 
BENJAMIN 
THOMAS 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise in mem-
ory of Joseph McCoy and Benjamin Thomas— 
and to commend the City of Alexandria for its 
work on the Alexandria Community Remem-
brance Project (ACRP). 
Through its partnership with the Equal Jus-
tice Initiative, the ACRP has brought our com-
munity together to remember the city’s history 
of racial terror and to memorialize Joseph 
McCoy and Benjamin Thomas, who were 
lynched in 1897 and 1899, respectively. These 
lynchings 
were 
two 
of 
86 
documented 
lynchings committed in Virginia between 1880 
and 1930. These acts of premeditated vio-
lence were deliberate attempts by whites to 
terrorize and control black populations across 
the state. 
As our community convenes again on Sep-
tember 24, 2022 we do so to collect soil rep-
resenting these two young men’s lives. In Oc-
tober, Alexandrians will then make a pilgrim-
age to Montgomery, Alabama to deliver this 
sacred soil to its final resting place at the Na-
tional Memorial for Peace and Justice. 
These events also occur during a year in 
which the Emmitt Till Antilynching Act, a fed-
eral bill making lynching a federal hate crime, 
was signed into law by President Biden on 
March 29. I was proud to support this long 
overdue legislation in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, but also recognize that we still 
have much more work to do. 
It is incumbent on all of us to remember this 
shameful episode of our history and others 
like it. In doing so, we are better able to see 
the continuous chain of racially motivated vio-
lence against Black Americans that spans our 
nation’s history. We can truly honor the 
memories of Joseph McCoy and Benjamin 
Thomas, along with the countless number of 
named and unnamed victims of racial vio-
lence, by seeking justice for all Americans and 
working to build a more inclusive society.

IN MEMORY OF EMMA LYNN 
THOMSON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Emma Lynn 
Thomson. I had the pleasure of getting to 
know Emma when she served as my commu-
nications director. 
Emma was a rising star on Capitol Hill and 
had an exceptional work ethic. She was a salt 
of the earth person who cared deeply for 
those around her. Because of her constant 
search for new ways to connect with constitu-
ents, North Texans, Pennsylvanians, and Hoo-
siers are fortunate to have benefited from her 
heart for public service. 
She hailed from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 
Her sister, Molly, put it best at her memorial 
service. Emma’s priorities were God first, fam-
ily and friends second, and then her blooming 
career. Her love for her Savior was reflected 
in how she cared for others. She never 
missed an opportunity to join family occasions, 
big or small. Emma was an active member at 
Capitol Hill Baptist Church where she taught 
Sunday school, led Bible studies, and was the 
Deaconess for weddings. 
Emma not only poured her life into her com-
munity, but also her country. After graduating 
from Bishop McCort High School, she at-
tended and graduated from George Wash-
ington University. Her political career started 
as a press assistant for Senator MARCO 
RUBIO’s Presidential campaign. Before coming 
to Capitol Hill to serve as communications di-
rector for three Members of Congress, she 
served as the digital communications assistant 
for the Democracy Fund. 
Emma loved our country, and her loss will 
never be replaced on Capitol Hill. My thoughts 
have remained with her parents, Linda and 
David, her sister, Molly, and all who treasured 
her. Her life is one taken far too early.

REMEMBERING PHOUA THAO 
HANG 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of Phoua Thao Hang. She 
leaves behind a large and loving family in Min-
nesota, and a legacy that will continue to in-
spire our community for years to come. 
Phoua was born in 1952 in Sa Luong, Laos. 
She grounded her life in service to community, 
sharing cultural wisdom with younger genera-
tions of Hmong Minnesotans who did not get 
to experience the same life she did—being 
carried on her father’s back from village to vil-
lage, planting rice seedlings, and gathering 
water for her family before the sun rose. 
Phoua’s family noted that over the course of 
her life, she worked as ‘‘an assembly operator, 
a waitress, a certified seamstress, a wreath- 
maker, and a farmer.’’ Phoua became a distin-
guished member of the Twin Cities’ Hmong 
community and contributed to countless efforts 
to build political, social, and economic capital. 
She was known as a mainstay of the St. Paul 
Farmers Market, where she sold her family’s 
fruits and vegetables for two decades. She 
was a founding member of the Hmong Amer-
ican Farmers Association where she ‘‘led the 
charge to lease a 155-acre farm, helped 
launch a marketing cooperative and food hub, 
spearheaded a micro-lending program, and 
tested key modules in a national training pro-
gram,’’ as remarked by Minnesota Governor 
Tim Walz. 
Phoua instilled in her children and grand-
children that sense of service, and our com-
munity will continue to be blessed by their 
thoughtful and impactful contributions in gov-
ernment, non-profits, and business. Phoua 
was killed senselessly on July 17, 2022, in a 
hit-and-run accident that has forever changed 
countless lives. I hold Phoua, her family, and 
our community in my heart as we honor her 
incredible legacy.

RECOGNIZING FIRE ENGINEER 
CURTIS TREVOR GOLD 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Curtis Trevor Gold 
and his many years of dedication to the City 
of Ontario as an Ontario Fire Engineer. 
Curtis joined the Ontario Fire Department in 
2016 as a firefighter. In 2019, he was pro-
moted to fire engineer. During his time at the 
Department, he served as a member of the 
Urban Search & Rescue Team. This team in-
volves technical rescue operations that re-
quires extrication and medical stabilization of 
victims of various emergencies. As an experi-
enced firefighter, Curtis also became a training 
instructor, mentoring younger firefighters. He 
was also a member of Ontario Professional 
Firefighters Local 1430. 
Sadly, our community is now in mourning. 
On Saturday, August 27th, Curtis tragically 
passed away in an off-duty accident. He is 
survived by his wife and family. I offer my 
deepest condolences on their loss. 
For his outstanding accomplishments, it is 
my honor to recognize Firefighter Curtis 
Trevor Gold. His years of civic service and 
commitment to the Department and the people 
of Ontario are worthy of the highest com-
mendation. He will be missed.

HONORING EMMA INEZ HIGH 
JOHNSON 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of Mrs. Emma Inez High John-
son. 
Born in New Market, Alabama, Emma Inez 
High Johnson began an uncommon life of 
modesty, sacrifice, and service. Her commit-
ment to men, women, and children from all 
walks of life made her efforts more distinct 
and special. It was over twenty-five years ago 
when Bishop Victor T. Curry affectionately and 
appropriately tabbed Emma, Queen Inez. This 
noteworthy and royal designation perfectly 
captured the very essence of a woman, regal 
in both nature and nurture. 
This 
accomplished, 
yet 
uncomplicated, 
woman was proudly connected to her faith 
and her family, readily accepting her divine 
destiny and mission as a wife, mother, nur-
turer, worshipper, and most importantly, a 
woman of faith. Emma labored to ensure that 
those with whom she worked were treated 
with compassion, dignity, and respect. Her en-
couragement and empowerment of her col-
leagues in many ways reflected her warm spir-
it. 
Emma wed the late Pastor Joe Cephus 
Johnson in 1966 and together they celebrated 
three children and a 52-year marriage. 
As first lady of the Ebenezer Missionary 
Baptist Church, Emma labored fervently in 
service. As chairwoman of Women in the Spir-
it of Excellence (W.I.S.E.), servant leader of 
the Women’s Ministry, Sunday School and Va-
cation Bible School instructor, a member of 
the Encouragement Ministry, Women’s Day 
speaker, and directress of Ebenezer’s Angelic 
Choir, Emma’s multi-giftedness was constantly 
on display. 
Beyond the walls of Ebenezer, Emma’s 
work for an assortment of causes and organi-
zations was hard to miss. In her roles as vice 
president of the International Association of 
Minister’s Wives and Minister’s Widows Cote-
rie of South Broward, a member of the Pro-
gressive Kingdom Baptist Association, a mem-
ber of the Divine Divas, and a 2nd Generation 
Member of the Red Hatters Society Inter-
national, Emma was deeply entrenched in the 
work of community service. 
My heart is with her daughters and family, 
and the entire Ebenezer Missionary Baptist 
Church family in mourning the loss of this kind 
and compassionate and virtuous woman. 
We are forever blessed to have shared this 
time with Queen Inez on Earth. May her mem-
ory be a blessing.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
JERRY CLAYTON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Jerry Clayton. 
Jerry was born on August 28, 1938, in the 
Mount Vernon community of Lee County to 
Robert Curtis and Dewdrop Raper Clayton. He 
graduated from Belden High School and at-
tended Itawamba Junior College (IJC) and 
Florence State (UNA) on basketball scholar-
ships. While at IJC he met Tula Ann Senter 
and they were later married. After earning a 
degree from Mississippi State, he began 
teaching History and coaching basketball at 
Milam Jr. High School in Tupelo. Little did he 
know then that his heart for teaching would be 
a driving force throughout his life. Coaching 
took him to Tupelo High School where his 
1968 Golden Wave basketball team won the 
state championship. He cherished his relation-
ship with his students and players and re-
mained concerned about them through the 
years, often being invited to their class re-
unions. 
In 1968, Jerry left the school system to be-
come Chancery Clerk of Lee County, an office 
he served for twenty years. He was active in 
the Mississippi Chancery Clerks Association 
and often helped new clerks learn office oper-
ations. While in office he was appointed Youth 
Court Referee. There his experience with 
abused and neglected boys revealed a need 
for a safe place to house and nurture these 
young men. This became his mission and with 
support of the Lee County Board of Super-
visors, Jerry founded the Alpha House, where 
for the next forty years, boys found a mentor 
whose goal was to give them a new way of 
life with confidence to set a goal and reach it. 
He wanted them to be so successful that they 
would become taxpayers instead of tax recipi-
ents. Many of those young men who lived 
there often came back to see and thank him. 
Wherever his careers took him, Jerry re-
mained dedicated to his family. He taught his 
two sons to love the outdoors, and they hunt-
ed and fished together and loved all things 
MSU. His terrific sense of humor made for 
many stories of their adventures. All the while 
his example taught them to care for those less 
fortunate. Jerry was a member of the original 
Elvis Presley Memorial Foundation Board, a 
Mason, and served on the board of the North 
Mississippi Medical Center. In 2014 he was

HONORING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
TEXAS STATE SENATOR LARRY 
TAYLOR 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of my friend, Senator Larry 
Taylor, who admirably served two decades in 
the Texas Legislature as State Representative 
for House District 24 from 2003 to 2013 and 
as State Senator for Senate District 11 from 
2013 to today. Senator Taylor will retire after 
a distinguished career at the end of this cur-
rent session in early 2023. 
Senator Taylor was raised in Friendswood, 
Texas, and is a lifelong Texan and Baylor Uni-
versity graduate. He and his wife, Kerri, have 
three children and five grandchildren. Senator 
Taylor formerly owned Truman Taylor Insur-
ance Agency in Friendswood, an independent 
agency started by his father more than 50 
years ago. 
Senator Taylor served five sessions in the 
Texas House of Representatives before his 
election to the State Senate. During the 82nd 
Legislature, Representative Taylor served on 
the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission, a 12- 
member body made up of legislators and 
members of the public who are appointed by 
the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and are tasked 
with identifying and eliminating waste, duplica-
tion, and inefficiency for more than 130 Texas 
state agencies. As a House member, he also 
served on the following committees: 
Elections, Insurance, Voter Identification 
and Fraud Select Committee, Windstorm In-
surance Oversight, Emergency Preparedness 
Select Committee, Special Purpose Districts 
Select Committee, Ways and Means, Appro-
priations, Calendars, Hurricane Ike Storm 
Devastation to the Texas Gulf Coast Select 
Committee, Property Tax Relief and Ap-
praisal Reform Select Committee, Business 
and Industry, House Administration, Health 
Insurance Risk Pool Deficit, Windstorm Cov-
erage and Budgetary Impact, and Public 
Health. 
Senator Taylor has served five sessions in 
the Texas State Senate and spent four of 
those sessions as Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Education. He also served as 
Chair of the Senate Finance Article III working 
group and was a member of the important 
Budget Conference Committee, a select group 
chosen to ensure that legislators passed a 
balanced budget. Additionally, he is a member 
of the Legislative Budget Board, a permanent 
joint committee responsible for developing 
budget and policy recommendations for legis-
lative appropriations. Senator Taylor has 
served on the following Senate committees: 
Education, Finance, Future of College 
Sports in Texas Select Committee, Higher 
Education, Ports Select Committee, Veteran 
Affairs, Water, Agriculture, and Rural Af-
fairs, Coastal Barrier System, Mass Violence 
Prevention and Community Safety Select 
Committee, Texas Commission on Public 
School Finance, Cruise Industry Develop-
ment, Business and Commerce, Intergovern-
mental Relations, State Real Property Data 
Collection, Reporting and Assessment Select 
Committee, 
Government 
Organization, 
Health and Human Services, Education Pol-
icy for a Skilled Workforce, Texas Lottery 
and Texas Lottery Commission, and Violence 
in Schools and School Security Select Com-
mittee. 
In 
2020, 
Senator 
Taylor 
was 
named 
‘‘Galvestonian of the Year’’ by the Galveston 
Chamber of Commerce. Two years later, he 
was given the 2022 inaugural ‘‘Senator Larry 
Taylor Champion of Education’’ award by the 
League City Chamber of Commerce for his 
tireless advocacy on behalf of Texas students 
and teachers. He currently serves on the 
board of Hope Village, a residential and day 
program for people with developmental disabil-
ities, and as the Director and Chairman of the 
Board for Texan Bank. He is also President of 
the Texas Conservative Coalition Research In-
stitute Board. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to commend 
my good friend Senator Larry Taylor for his 
many years of faithful service and dedication 
to the State of Texas, his constituents, and the 
education of countless Texans. I would also 
like to congratulate him on an outstanding ca-
reer and wish him, his wife, Kerri, and their 
family the best in his retirement and future en-
deavors.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF MASTER 
SERGEANT ANDREW J. PIEHL 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 2, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, l rise 
today to honor an outstanding leader and war-
rior, Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Andrew 
J. Piehl on the occasion of his retirement from 
the United States Air Force Reserve. Chief 
Piehl is the 349th Air Mobility Wing Cyber Op-
erations Superintendent at Travis Air Force 
Base in California, and has served his nation 
for more than 35 years of selfless duty. 
Chief Piehl started his career as a vehicle 
operator in 1987, stationed in Texas and Italy. 
Just three years later, he deployed in support 
of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, an-
swering our country’s call to face down tyr-
anny in response to Iraq’s invasion and an-
nexation of Kuwait. Since then, this proud son 
of Vacaville, California, served with distinction 
at Air Force bases across the globe and de-
voted his life to the service of our great Na-
tion. 
In his final job before retirement, he was the 
principal enlisted advisor for cyber warfighters 
at the largest tenant wing in Air Force Reserve 
Command, ensuring airmen were mission- 
ready to provide dynamic and integrated net-
work defense capabilities, systems manage-
ment, technical support, and financial manage-
ment. Chief Piehl was an exceptional senior 
enlisted leader living by the core values of ‘‘In-
tegrity First, Service Before Self, and Excel-
lence In All We Do.’’ He always put his airmen 
and their needs first. 
In addition to Chief Piehl’s service, his wife 
Grace also selflessly served in the Air Force 
Reserve as a Senior Master Sergeant. She 
devoted her life to their two children, Shelby 
and AJ. In all that we do, may we reflect on 
the many sacrifices of our dual military fami-
lies and their tireless devotion to duty. I cannot 
overstate the importance of the support that 
spouses and families provide to their service 
members in our Armed Forces. Service and 
sacrifice are not limited to just the service 
member, but often extend to the entire family. 
On behalf of the U.S. Congress and a grateful 
Nation, we thank Grace, Shelby, and AJ. Al-
though the Air Force will say goodbye to Chief 
Master Sergeant Piehl, we know that the Piehl 
family’s legacy and devotion to the service of 
this great Nation will continue for years to 
come. 
I would like to help close out the final chap-
ter of this inspiring Soldier and Joint Force 
leader’s career with a heartfelt thank you from 
all the men and women of the U.S. Congress 
and Nation. Thank you, Chief Master Sergeant 
Piehl, for your 35 years of service to the Air 
Force and the Travis Air Force Base commu-
nity, and congratulations on your retirement. 
We wish you well in your future endeavors.
