for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of today, 
the bill is considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 335 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. EXCEPTION TO LIMITATION AGAINST 
APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS AS SEC-
RETARY OF DEFENSE WITHIN SEVEN 
YEARS OF RELIEF FROM ACTIVE 
DUTY AS REGULAR COMMISSIONED 
OFFICERS OF THE ARMED FORCES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the sec-
ond sentence of section 113(a) of title 10, 
United States Code, the first person ap-
pointed, by and with the advice and consent 
of the Senate, as Secretary of Defense in an 
appointment made on or after January 20, 
2021, may be a person who is, on the date of 
appointment, within seven years after relief, 
but not within four years after relief, from 
active duty as a commissioned officer of a 
regular component of the Armed Forces. 
(b) LIMITED EXCEPTION.—This section ap-
plies only to the first person nominated after 
12 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on January 
20, 2021, and appointed as Secretary of De-
fense as described in subsection (a), and to 
no other person. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
the ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Armed Services. 
The gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
SMITH) and the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ROGERS) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 335. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the bill that will 
grant a waiver, an exemption, to Lloyd 
Austin to be nominated and confirmed 
as the Secretary of Defense. This is re-
quired because there is a law on the 
books that says that you must be 7 
years separated from military service 
in order to serve as Secretary of De-
fense. 
Mr. Austin has been out for almost 5 
years, but does not meet the 7-year re-
quirement. So we need to pass this law 
to give him that exemption. 
Now, this is not an easy question. Ci-
vilian control of the military is enor-
mously important. That is why this 
law was put in place. But in looking at 
this, I feel there are three basic ques-
tions: 
Number one, does the nominee in 
question understand and reassure us in 
the House—for the purposes of our vote 
on this portion of the waiver—that he 
understands and is committed to civil-
ian control of the military? 
b 1415 
Second, is there something about 
this particular nominee that makes it 
important to grant this exclusion, to 
grant this waiver? 
And, third, is the individual qualified 
for the job? Because I do believe that 
that is important, and the details of 
their history is important in deciding 
that. 
And I have, after a lot of thought and 
a lot of conversations with Mr. Austin 
and others, concluded that all three of 
those criteria are met in this instance. 
Taking the last one first, Lloyd Aus-
tin is unquestionably highly qualified 
to be the Secretary of Defense. He had 
a distinguished career in the military, 
serving in multiple different command 
posts, including the commanding gen-
eral in Iraq, the head of CENTCOM, 
and the Vice Chief of Staff of the 
Army. It is beyond question that Lloyd 
Austin is qualified for this job. 
He just finished a 2-hour presentation 
before the Armed Services Committee, 
taking our questions, in which he made 
it absolutely clear that he has a keen 
understanding of the issues that are 
going to face the Secretary of Defense 
and the experience and the intelligence 
necessary to deal with them. He is 
highly qualified. 
On the first question of civilian con-
trol of the military, he has assured us 
over and over again of how important 
that is, and, more importantly, his ac-
tions reflect that. 
He has come before the House, which 
you do not typically have to do in 
order to be confirmed to a Secretary- 
level position, but he has called us and 
he has reached out to us in a way that, 
frankly, 4 years ago, the Trump admin-
istration did not permit then-Sec-
retary-nominee Jim Mattis to do. 
He has called countless members of 
the committee; he has met with us. He 
has showed us that he respects what is 
really one of the cornerstones of civil-
ian control of the military, and that is 
the House and the Senate. We are the 
ones who have oversight over the Pen-
tagon. He has shown that he respects 
that. 
So I can tell you and all Members 
voting, without a shadow of a doubt, I 
have no concern whatsoever about 
Lloyd Austin upholding civilian con-
trol of the military. 
And then there is the second issue: 
Why this person, in this instance? Mr. 
Austin will be the first African Amer-
ican nominated. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from Wash-
ington has expired. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. Austin will be the first African 
American nominated to be Secretary of 
Defense, which is enormously impor-
tant in and of itself. 
The military has a problem with di-
versity. They have an insufficient num-
ber of people of color who have been ad-
vanced to high positions, to general 
and general flag officers. It is enor-
mously important that they address 
that. 
In addition, in this country, we have 
an enormous problem right now with 
White supremacy. We also have a prob-
lem within our military ranks. 
Now, let me be perfectly clear: I have 
100 percent confidence in our military. 
But this is an issue that they do need 
to address, the rise of White supremacy 
and White nationalism within their 
ranks. Having a highly qualified Afri-
can American be Secretary of Defense 
will be an enormous step toward ad-
dressing that problem. 
So I believe 100 percent Mr. Austin 
has met the criteria to be granted this 
exclusion. 
Lastly, I want to say, this law still 
matters because without this law we 
wouldn’t have this process. We would 
not have the opportunity to question 
Mr. Austin in advance of his confirma-
tion in the Senate. So the law has 
upheld its meaning and its role, to 
maintain civilian control of the mili-
tary, by forcing this conversation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
vote in favor of the waiver for Lloyd 
Austin, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to 
take a minute to thank the men and 
women of the National Guard for the 
service they have provided in pro-
tecting this Capitol over the last 2 
weeks. 
I especially want to thank the 750 
men and women from the State of Ala-
bama who came here to the call of 
duty. 
Once again, these citizen soldiers left 
their homes and their jobs to respond 
to this call, and, although it is unfortu-
nate they were needed, it is certainly 
appreciated by all of us that they were 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that 
each President deserves the oppor-
tunity to fill their Cabinet as they see 
fit. And I agree that it is important to 
confirm President Biden’s national se-
curity team as soon as possible, espe-
cially given the grave threats that we 
face. 
Four years ago, this House provided a 
process to consider a waiver for Gen-
eral Mattis. We were all disappointed 
when General Mattis did not appear be-
fore the Armed Services Committee. 
Yet the Armed Services Committee 
still convened and held a public mark-
up of the waiver, which passed without 
a single vote from any Democrat. Then 
the full House debated and voted on the 
waiver. 
This time around, the Armed Serv-
ices Committee was excluded from the 
process by the Democrat leadership of 
this House. This was not a decision

January 21, 2021 
made by Chairman SMITH, who wanted 
a public hearing as much as I did. 
There has been no public hearing, no 
markup of a waiver, no opportunity for 
amendments. 
Just 4 years ago, Democrat leader-
ship told us how important it was to 
follow regular order and allow the 
Armed Services Committee to consider 
the Mattis waiver. 
Speaker PELOSI said, ‘‘The American 
people are entitled to regular order and 
thoughtful scrutiny of nominees and 
any potential waivers.’’ 
Majority Leader HOYER said, ‘‘The 
committee has a right and a responsi-
bility to inquire of General Mattis why 
he thinks he ought to be given a waiv-
er.’’ 
I guess this time around they don’t 
feel the same way. 
Mr. Speaker, civilian control of the 
military is a fundamental tenet of our 
Republic. It is rooted in our Constitu-
tion. The law prohibiting recently re-
tired military from serving as Sec-
retary of Defense was enacted shortly 
after World War II to uphold this prin-
ciple. 
In nearly 75 years, the law has only 
been waived twice, for General Mar-
shall and General Mattis. This will be 
the third time. 
But Biden didn’t have to do it this 
way. There was a strong pool of diverse 
civilians and former military leaders 
with qualifications and experience to 
serve as Secretary. President Biden 
could have selected from this talent 
pool, but he chose not to. 
I voted for the waiver for General 
Mattis, and I will vote for the waiver 
for General Austin. For me, it is just 
fair—a waiver for a Republican Presi-
dent and a waiver for a Democrat 
President. 
But I stand here frustrated by this 
dysfunctional 
process. 
President 
Trump and President Biden forced this 
Congress into situations made worse, 
this time around, by the Speaker’s de-
cision to ignore regular order. 
Congress should not have to enter-
tain these waivers. Presidents need to 
follow the law as written. They need to 
stop asking Congress to waive a stat-
ute. And we certainly shouldn’t be 
forced to do so outside of regular order. 
If Presidents don’t think the law mat-
ters, then they need to address this 
waiver issue in this year’s NDAA. 
Mr. Speaker, America faces extraor-
dinary threats from strategic competi-
tors like China and Russia, rogue na-
tions like Iran and North Korea, as 
well 
as 
terrorists 
and 
other 
transnational enemies. It is more crit-
ical now than ever to strengthen our 
military, address mounting readiness 
problems, and modernize our conven-
tional and nuclear forces to defeat 
these threats. 
I believe General Austin understands 
the threats that we face. I believe he 
respects the principle of civilian con-
trol. I believe he will stand up to the 
efforts of many of the Democrat major-
ity who seek to slash defense spending 
and rewrite our defense strategy. 
I hope the rest of the Biden adminis-
tration shares his commitment for pro-
viding for our men and women in uni-
form the resources they need to suc-
cessfully defend our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to have 
process arguments all year long in this 
House, but what was just said is really 
disingenuous. The only reason that we 
didn’t go through regular order, the 
only reason we didn’t have a public 
hearing, and the only reason we didn’t 
have a vote in our committee is be-
cause the Republicans, as we stand 
here right now, have not appointed 
their members to the Armed Services 
Committee. So, therefore, we don’t 
have a committee. 
It is the day after Mr. Biden has be-
come President. He needs his Secretary 
of Defense. I have begged the Repub-
licans for the better part of a month to 
appoint their members so we could do 
our job. 
So for them to choose not to appoint 
their members and then come to the 
floor crying about process, that is not 
really fair. We tried to do the process 
right. They stopped us from doing the 
process right. I want the record to re-
flect that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
BROWN), a soon-to-be member of the 
Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, Lloyd 
Austin, as we have heard, would be our 
country’s first African-American Sec-
retary of Defense. His confirmation is 
more than a symbolic milestone to-
wards genuine integration of the De-
partment of Defense; it is a substantive 
answer to many of the challenges that 
the military faces. 
What 
are 
those 
challenges, 
Mr. 
Speaker? White supremacy and extre-
mism. There is a dramatic rise in 
White supremacists and racist hate 
groups within our military. They ac-
tively recruit from our uniformed 
ranks. A Military Times survey found 
an alarming rise in White supremacist 
and racist ideology in the military. 
What 
are 
those 
challenges, 
Mr. 
Speaker? The lack of diversity inclu-
sion at our highest ranks and in our 
coveted career fields. Racial and ethnic 
groups make up more than 40 percent 
of the Nation’s military, but there is a 
significant lack of diversity in civilian 
and military leadership at the most 
senior levels, due in large part to sys-
temic racial bias in promotion and as-
signment boards. This hurts the mili-
tary, our readiness and our effective-
ness. 
Who are those challenges, Mr. Speak-
er? The military isn’t immune from the 
racial injustice that we see in the 
broader criminal justice system. Under 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
today, a Black servicemember is two 
times 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
court- 
martialed or punished. 
These are real challenges that erode 
the effectiveness of our military. That 
is why we need a leader like Lloyd Aus-
tin. He understands the complexities of 
the military and the challenges our 
country faces. His lived experience and 
his professional record cry out for a 
waiver to lead the Department of De-
fense. 
President Biden is committed to ci-
vilian control of the military, pro-
tecting our men and women in uni-
form, and restoring American leader-
ship. President Biden has confidence in 
Lloyd Austin, and so should we. He is 
the right man for this moment for our 
military. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support the waiver of soon- 
to-be Secretary Lloyd Austin at the 
Department of Defense. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to address my 
friend, the chairman’s remarks about 
the establishment of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. 
We did not establish our members 
from our steering committee because 
we didn’t get our ratio from the Demo-
crat leadership until last week. It was 
physically not possible. 
Had we gotten our ratio a month ago 
or even 2 weeks ago, we would have sat 
our members, and we would have had a 
sitting committee. 
The reason we didn’t have a public 
hearing today, the chairman is right, 
we didn’t have a sitting committee. 
That is the fault of the Democrat lead-
ership, not the minority. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLA-
GHER), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Alabama for 
his strong leadership as our new rank-
ing member, and I look forward to 
working with him and the chairman on 
what is truly still, I think, the most bi-
partisan committee in Congress. 
I want to make clear that I have 
enormous respect for General Austin’s 
service. I don’t think anyone can look 
at his record and not come away very 
impressed. 
But I also strongly oppose this bill. 
There is no waiver; we are actually 
changing the underlying law. This was 
one of the biggest talking points 4 
years ago. And we should not do so 
lightly. 
Much has been made about the his-
toric nature of Mr. Austin’s nomina-
tion, which is true but in more ways 
than one. If we change the law today, 
we will now have done so twice within 
4 years, effectively destroying the his-
torical precedent against such exemp-
tions. 
We will also invert the congressional 
intent in the underlying National Se-
curity Act by setting the precedent 
that the presumption is for approval, 
not the disapproval, of recently retired 
officers. 
So the law and the norm of civil- 
military relations that it is meant to 
buttress is on life support right now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H212 
January 21, 2021 
And, as in 2017, we will be granting 
this exemption without a public hear-
ing of the Armed Services Committee, 
which is the bare minimum of our con-
stitutional obligations. We will be get-
ting rolled over, to borrow a phrase 
that was used 4 years ago. 
And I don’t know, I am not in the 
room where these ratios are discussed, 
and this and that, but it seems to me 
that it is worth waiting a few days in 
order to have such a public hearing, 
but it is my understanding that our en-
tire workweek next week has been can-
celed. 
So I don’t think it withstands basic 
scrutiny to suggest that we couldn’t 
have had a public hearing to discuss 
this very, very important issue. 
Now, 4 years ago, I voted in favor of 
the exemption for Secretary Mattis. I 
think it was my first vote. It was cer-
tainly my first speech on the House 
floor. So it is fair to ask what has 
changed. Well, a lot has changed. 
First and perhaps most importantly, 
the threat from China is far greater, 
and 
we 
need 
a 
Secretary 
with 
INDOPACOM experience. The nominee 
has admitted that he is not uniquely 
qualified in that regard, and I don’t 
think there is a more important aspect 
of his experience that we could analyze 
in considering whether to change the 
underlying law. 
Second, budgetary pressures on the 
Department are much bigger. Particu-
larly in the post-pandemic world, it is 
going to be far more difficult to build 
off of the success that we have had in 
giving the Department the resources it 
needs, and we will need a Secretary 
with political experience who can fight 
and win interagency battles for a high-
er top line. 
And, third, we also have more data. 
Four years ago, we ran this experiment 
for the first time in 67 years, and we 
learned that recently retired general 
officers face unique challenges when 
leading the Department—specifically, 
the need to publicly advocate for a 
higher top line, which requires some 
political experience. And the nominee 
has made much of the apolitical nature 
of his prior experience. 
Now, I know in politics we are not 
supposed to change our minds, but if 
we are unwilling to learn from recent 
experience or change our minds in re-
sponse to new information, then we are 
doomed to repeat the exact same mis-
takes. 
b 1430 
This is why I am voting ‘‘no,’’ among 
other reasons. 
But I want to be clear. I want Mr. 
Austin, soon-to-be Secretary Austin, to 
be successful in this job. Nothing would 
make me happier than to look back on 
his time at DOD and be able to say he 
was the most successful Secretary of 
Defense in our Nation’s history because 
that will mean that we as a committee 
were successful in working with him to 
do what is right for our men and 
women in uniform and do what is right 
for the rest of the country. 
Though I will oppose changing the 
law again for the second time in 4 
years, I very much look forward to 
working with my colleagues, both Re-
publican and Democratic. I genuinely 
appreciate the honest exchange of 
views we had 4 years ago and 4 years 
later. I can only say that 4 years from 
now, I hope we are not having the same 
debate because it will prove we have 
learned nothing from this. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
the 
distinguished 
Speaker 
of 
the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
extraordinary leadership as chair of 
the Armed Services Committee. 
He brings us to the floor today for a 
very special privilege. We in the House 
really most of the time do not have too 
much say as to who will be a member 
of the Cabinet. That is, advise and con-
sent responsibility lies with the Sen-
ate. But today, because of the special 
nature of the appointee, we are here to 
talk about a waiver. 
As a Member of Congress, again, 
there is no more serious responsibility. 
It is the oath we take to protect and 
defend. Our responsibility is to protect 
the American people. That responsi-
bility is why we must waste no time 
ensuring that President Joe Biden’s na-
tional defense and national security 
team is confirmed, ready and able to 
keep our country and our people safe. 
President Biden selected a highly 
qualified and widely respected leader in 
nominating General Lloyd Austin for 
Secretary of Defense. General Austin 
has led with honor and served with dig-
nity. With over 40 years of decorated 
Army 
service, 
Secretary-designate 
Austin brings a great understanding of 
the challenges facing our Nation’s de-
fense and a deep appreciation for the 
sacrifice of our military and their fam-
ilies. 
The historical circumstances of this 
nomination, in light of the deadly in-
surrection assault on the Capitol, the 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 
the 
under-
mining of the Pentagon by the previous 
President, and more, necessitate the 
expeditious confirmation of this ex-
tremely qualified leader. 
I do want to say as a constitutional 
officer—the Speaker of the House is a 
constitutional officer, written into the 
Constitution—and as a former leader of 
the Intelligence Committee, a Demo-
cratic leader of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, my commitment to a strong ci-
vilian control of our military, as re-
quired by the Constitution, is strong. 
It is not an issue with us, Mr. Speak-
er. It is a value, civilian control of the 
military. The Congress’ power to grant 
or withhold an exemption for recent 
Active Duty military servicemembers 
to be the Secretary of Defense must be 
treated with gravity and extreme dili-
gence. 
That is why I am so glad that Presi-
dent Biden and General Austin insisted 
and met our request to come to speak 
to Armed Services Committee mem-
bers. That did not happen under Gen-
eral Mattis. I am a big fan of General 
Mattis, but President Trump said he 
could not come speak to the Congress, 
and that is a big difference. That is a 
big difference. 
Again, with gratitude to President 
Biden in recognizing the important 
role that the House of Representatives 
plays in this, I had the privilege, as 
have other Members, of hearing from 
General Austin as well as the com-
mittee today. 
By the way, in case you didn’t notice, 
when we are talking about timetables 
relating to committee ratios, 2 weeks 
ago, there was an insurrection in this 
Chamber. It was disruptive of the nor-
mal pattern unfolding. We all had to 
adjust our schedules and address the 
needs of our caucuses and this Congress 
accordingly, in case you didn’t notice. 
Again, my conversations with the 
Secretary-designate have assured me 
that he understands, respects, and will 
uphold the critical priority of civilian 
control of the military. He has spoken 
several times to the chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee and 
members of the committee and has 
given similar assurances. 
The Secretary-designate has further 
demonstrated 
his 
commitment 
to 
transparency with the Congress, re-
specting the weight of the decision 
that we now make by, as I mentioned, 
meeting with members of the Armed 
Services Committee to discuss this 
issue earlier today. 
In the face of the many threats, both 
foreign and domestic, confronting our 
Nation, it is essential that Secretary- 
designate Austin be immediately con-
firmed. Blocking this waiver would be 
a mistake that, among other dangers, 
would delay the urgent work to be done 
to restore the independence and capa-
bilities of the Defense Department, 
which we must do as soon as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote to grant this waiver for Sec-
retary-designate Lloyd Austin to serve 
as Secretary of Defense. I salute him 
for his patriotism, thank him for his 
heroism, and look forward to calling 
him Mr. Secretary. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
waiver allowing General Lloyd Austin 
to serve as Secretary of Defense. 
Civilian leadership at the top of the 
Pentagon is desirable and necessary. I 
believe this should only be reserved for 
unique circumstances. Regularly nomi-
nated candidates who require waivers 
is not a precedent we should set. 
However, examining General Austin’s 
credentials and the circumstances fac-
ing our Nation lead me to believe the 
approval of this specific waiver is war-
ranted. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is still ongo-
ing. China is growing bolder and more

aggressive, using espionage, cyber war-
fare, and manipulation to undermine 
U.S. and global security. Iran remains 
an ever-present threat to the Middle 
East and the world. North Korea con-
tinues to pursue an ambitious nuclear 
weapons development program. 
These issues and others require the 
steady hand of an experienced and 
qualified Secretary of Defense. General 
Austin meets these requirements and is 
more than qualified to oversee our Na-
tion’s military. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of 
this waiver. I look forward to working 
with Secretary Austin to confront 
these very real threats to our national 
security. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA). 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, in history, there are 
many generals who are celebrated for 
logistical feats to win a war. Rare is a 
general who is celebrated for logistical 
feats to end a war. 
General Austin presided over the 
most significant withdrawal of troops 
and equipment, over 150,000 troops from 
Iraq, successfully. He helped bring that 
conflict to an end. 
General Austin helped us prevent 
getting into a catastrophic conflict in 
Syria. 
Now, I don’t think the American peo-
ple are concerned about process argu-
ments, about whether someone wore a 
uniform or didn’t wear a uniform. What 
they want to know is the outcome. Is 
the leader going to help start new wars 
or end wars? General Austin, with Sec-
retary Blinken and Jake Sullivan, is 
going to help end the war in Yemen. 
They want to know: Is a leader going 
to turn a blind eye to White suprem-
acy, or are they going to stand up for 
equality? General Austin will stand up 
for equality in our military. 
Most importantly, they want to 
know: Is a leader going to circumvent 
the President of the United States, as 
certain civilian leaders have, or is the 
leader going to defer to the duly elect-
ed President of the United States? Gen-
eral 
Austin 
deferred 
to 
President 
Obama, and he will absolutely defer to 
President Biden. 
The last point I hear my colleagues 
say is, well, he doesn’t have expertise 
in China or India. Well, first of all, no 
one has expertise in every region of the 
world. No one is going to have a Ph.D. 
thesis about every country. 
The important thing is that we do 
not need another leader who is going to 
saber rattle and get us into another 
cold war with China. We need someone 
who is going to be tough but who is 
going to have the wisdom and the judg-
ment to defer to the national security 
team and the President and help create 
a constructive relationship. General 
Austin will do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I proudly support his 
nomination for Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), my friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of this waiv-
er. 
General Lloyd Austin grew up in 
south Georgia, where he was raised by 
his parents in Thomasville. A graduate 
of West Point, he would go on to a ca-
reer that spanned numerous units, re-
sponsibilities, and engagements. His 
first assignment was to the 3rd Infan-
try Division, now stationed in my dis-
trict at Fort Stewart. 
In the early 2000s, he served as assist-
ant division commander for the 3rd In-
fantry Division during the invasion of 
Iraq. He would later go on to serve as 
a division commander and the chief of 
staff of the United States Central Com-
mand, CENTCOM; the commander of 
the XVIII Airborne Corps; the Army 
vice chief of staff; and, finally, the 
commander of CENTCOM. 
He has been described as a private in-
dividual who is committed to carrying 
out his duties. 
I, like others, have my reservations 
about continuing down a path of waiv-
ers for former military leaders to serve 
in civilian positions. What first started 
with a waiver for General Marshall in 
1950 and then again for General Mattis 
in 2017, we have now seen several re-
quests for what many see as a once-in- 
a-generation issue. However, General 
Austin’s service and assignments are a 
reflection of his success in his military 
career. 
If confirmed, it is my hope that Gen-
eral Austin will carry out his commit-
ment to civilian control of the Depart-
ment of Defense and advocate for the 
priorities central to national security, 
such as the modernizing of the triad. 
In a time when our adversaries seek 
to capitalize on any weaknesses, we 
need strong leadership. General Lloyd 
Austin will provide us with that. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and Mr. ROGERS from 
Alabama, the ranking member, for 
bringing this forward as a bipartisan 
effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise as one of those 
who opposed the waiver for General 
Mattis. People ask me, well, what is 
the difference? Mr. GALLAGHER raised 
this. You change your mind. 
Let me tell you what makes the dif-
ference for me, Mr. Speaker. I think 
this law is a very relevant law. It is a 
very important law. It anticipated, 
when the Congress passed it, that there 
would be reasons for waiver, or it 
would not have included it. It would 
have made a preclusion. It did not do 
that. 
It said under circumstances that the 
Congress considers, it may be well be 
in order to have a waiver. This, I think, 
is one of those times. 
Very frankly, one of the reasons I 
voted ‘‘no’’ on Mr. Mattis is because 
Mr. Trump did not know Mr. Mattis, 
his outstanding military service. 
b 1445 
General Mattis really didn’t know 
Mr. Trump; and that relationship did 
not go well, unfortunately. In my view, 
General Mattis was a great tower of 
strength and independence in leading 
the Department of Defense. So I con-
gratulate him for his service, although 
I participated in a meeting in the 
White House in which President Trump 
was very harsh in his analysis of Gen-
eral Mattis, which I thought was unfor-
tunate. But this difference that I see 
today is a very important one. 
What is that difference? 
The President of the United States— 
the Commander in Chief, the civilian 
leader—knows 
General 
Austin, 
has 
worked with General Austin, and has 
taken the measure of General Austin, 
and they have a relationship, a positive 
relationship. 
In addition to that, of course, the son 
of the President, Beau Biden, serving 
in the military, served with General 
Austin and took the measure of the 
man and his commitment to civilian 
leadership in the Armed Forces—a 
critically important concept for the 
Secretary of Defense. 
One problem that dictates the speedi-
est possible passage of this bill is the 
security situation in which we find 
ourselves. Always in a transition the 
enemy can think you are weak and not 
able to respond in an effective way. 
That is why, traditionally, Mr. Speak-
er, the Congresses do, in fact, confirm 
the Secretary of Defense and the Sec-
retary of State. 
Ms. Avril Haines was just confirmed 
as the head of the DNI. It is because we 
do not want a long period of time be-
tween having somebody in charge in 
the Defense Department and, in this 
case, somebody in charge who obvi-
ously knows and agrees with the prin-
ciples of the President of the United 
States. 
I am sure he will give good advice 
and sometimes he will disagree, but we 
have a confidence relationship. So 
very, very important. 
This is not a moment for our country 
to be without a Secretary of Defense. 
Secretary-designate Austin is a highly 
qualified nominee, spoken to by the bi-
partisan support that this waiver will 
garner this day in the Congress of the 
United States. Mr. Speaker, he would 
make history, of course, as has been 
pointed out, and not an insubstantial 
mark on history. 
Secretary-designate Austin is the 
first African American who will be Sec-
retary of Defense. At this time, our 
country is fighting to overcome the 
legacy of slavery, segregation, and 
prejudice, as has been pointed out by 
my friend, Mr. BROWN, who served as a 
lieutenant 
colonel 
in 
the 
Armed 
Forces. 
Secretary-designate Austin served in 
Iraq. Forty percent minorities. What a 
symbol and a bridge between those of 
the majority and those of the minority 
in our services, which will coalesce and 
bind together better the units, which is 
extraordinarily important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H214 
January 21, 2021 
Secretary-designate 
Austin 
served 
our Nation admirably in uniform and 
oversaw the safe and successful draw-
down of our troops in Iraq, as has been 
pointed out by Representative KHANNA. 
In doing so, he earned the trust of 
then-Vice President Biden and Beau 
Biden. 
Because of Secretary-designate Aus-
tin’s recent military service, he re-
quires a waiver. But, again, the waiver 
is included so that the Congress can 
make a determination as to whether 
this is appropriate. I can’t think of a 
more appropriate Secretary of Defense 
than somebody who has great knowl-
edge and confidence of the Commander 
in Chief. We ought to take that action 
without delay. 
Mr. Speaker, we must always have a 
clear delineation between the military 
and civilian authorities in this coun-
try. I have a picture hanging on my 
wall, which is also in the rotunda. I 
have it in my office because it is in the 
Maryland State Senate, the Old Cham-
ber. It is still in existence, still in the 
capitol in Annapolis, of George Wash-
ington resigning his commission as 
Commander in Chief of the Continental 
Army. And I always point out to people 
who come into my office that the Mem-
bers of the Continental Congress are 
seated notwithstanding their inclina-
tion in the presence of this great, 
iconic figure was to stand and pay rev-
erence to him. And George Washington 
said, ‘‘No, you sit,’’ because the civil-
ian government is superior to the mili-
tary. What a great lesson George Wash-
ington taught us at that time, which, 
thank God, has been revered until this 
time. 
I think this appointment is the right 
appointment. I think it will be good for 
America. I think it will be good for the 
Armed Forces of the United States of 
America. I think the President has 
chosen well. 
I urge my colleagues to grant this 
waiver. This, I would add, is not con-
firmation. Our brothers and sisters in 
the United States Senate will still have 
to judge and give advice and consent to 
this appointment, but this waiver is a 
precondition to their considering it on 
the merits. I hope that we will give 
them that. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN), who is 
the ranking member of Readiness Sub-
committee. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding to 
me. 
I have heard from people today who 
voted ‘‘yes’’ on Mattis and now they 
are ‘‘no;’’ or they voted ‘‘no’’ on Mattis 
and now they are a ‘‘yes.’’ I guess that 
makes me a model of consistency be-
cause I am a ‘‘yes’’ and a ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we should vote ‘‘yes’’ to 
give this waiver because, as Mr. HOYER 
has just said, the security needs are 
pressing upon us. We can’t take weeks 
and weeks to get this person installed. 
So we need to act quickly and we need 
to have a waiver rather than starting 
all over again in this process. 
The other thing is Mr. Austin has 
been out of the military for almost 5 
years. Under the law, there is a 7-year 
cooling off period. Five years, in my 
mind, is almost as good as 7 years. 
I mean, what is magic about 7 years? 
Is 6 years and 10 months not good 
enough, but 7 years and 1 month is 
good enough? 
There is a little arbitrariness in-
volved here when choosing 7 years in 
the first place. I believe that 5 years— 
almost 5 years is sufficient for Mr. Aus-
tin to have cooled off. 
We had a roundtable today in com-
mittee. I thank the chairman for hav-
ing that roundtable. We heard from Mr. 
Austin. He very eloquently stated, 
yeah, he could stand up to people who 
were in the military. He can tell them 
what is good for the civilian control of 
our country. I trust him. He is the 
right man for the job. 
Our security needs are too pressing 
to keep dilly-dallying on this. Let’s 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this issue and supply the 
waiver today. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the other 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, this waiver 
vote is about our long history of civil-
ian control of the military, a critical 
safeguard of our democracy. 
But let’s be really clear what this 
vote is not about. It is not about the 
rise of China or artificial intelligence 
or autonomous warfare or any of the 
other issues that I have heard people 
talk about that are really the purview 
of the Senate at this point in the proc-
ess and President Biden. It is also not 
about changing the law, because the 
law remains in effect and the limita-
tion remains in effect. 
The question before this body is 
whether there are specific extenuating 
circumstances in this moment in time 
to grant a waiver and whether the 
heart and mind of the nominee is con-
sistent with the spirit of the law. 
In the aftermath of January 6, we are 
reminded how deeply rooted racism ex-
ists in our country. Among those who 
stormed the Capitol were current and 
former military, a fact that highlights 
the national and domestic security 
threat of extremism in our military. 
Secretary-designee Austin is unique-
ly qualified with his experience and his 
background to address this threat. He 
understands in a deeply personal way 
how to deal with it. He is a man who 
understands that our military is more 
than a formation of tanks, planes, and 
troops; that it is actually a standard 
bearer of our values, and we are strong-
er when we lead with our values and we 
channel the full strength of our diver-
sity to meet our threats. 
In addition to that, nobody can stand 
up here and say, as we are still under 
cyber attack by Russia and meeting so 
many other threats, that the extenu-
ating circumstances of the time do not 
merit getting a nominee into this role 
immediately. That is why I rise in 
strong support of Lloyd Austin’s nomi-
nation and waiver, and I will be work-
ing very hard to support him as our 
next Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I have two more speakers who 
aren’t here yet. So I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in full support of the waiver for 
General Lloyd Austin, to grant Presi-
dent Biden his historic nomination for 
Secretary of Defense. 
The concern of civilian control of the 
military and Department of Defense 
should not be lost in this waiver. There 
are valid concerns in granting second 
waivers so soon. The missed oppor-
tunity for the House—the Chamber 
closest to the American citizens to 
hear from General Austin directly—is 
disappointing, but these are not nor-
mal times. The layers of security cur-
rently protecting the Capitol is a stark 
reminder that President Biden, our 
servicemembers, and our Nation need 
top defense leadership in place expedi-
tiously. 
There is no question General Austin 
is a devoutly patriotic man. He has 
served our country with utter distinc-
tion and honor. His qualifications, ex-
perience, and perspective are what our 
Nation needs today. His service to our 
country extends over 4 decades. His tal-
ent and dedication to America’s secu-
rity shines in roles few Americans can 
fully comprehend. Yet again and again 
he stands before us, hat in hand, will-
ing to serve the Stars and Stripes 
today. 
The question is: Can he disconnect a 
potentially unconscious bias toward a 
military mindset? 
As he assured the Senate and the 
American people throughout his con-
firmation hearing, there is no doubt he 
will. He has been honed in decision-
making in the most difficult situa-
tions. In a matter of weeks, both the 
House Armed Services Committee and 
our 
Defense 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee will welcome a newly mint-
ed Secretary of Defense Austin. 
Members can hear even more from 
him directly as to how he will lead as 
a civilian. Over my years as a defense 
appropriator, I have come to realize 
our military personnel are phenomenal 
at filling the roles they are assigned. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Ohio. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, our military personnel 
are continuously placed in nontradi-
tional positions and time and again 
perform flawlessly. There is no doubt 
General Austin understands being a 
member of the President’s Cabinet re-
quires a different perspective. He will 
fill this role and perform admirably.

H215 
January 21, 2021 
For these reasons, I encourage all my 
colleagues to support this waiver. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 335 because there is 
a consistency 4 years ago when I rose 
in support of a previous general. But 
when I look at General Lloyd Austin, I 
see a qualified individual, in my opin-
ion, and I see somebody worthy of the 
Senate considering. But I also see that, 
in fact, we are setting a precedent. 
Sixty-seven years, we didn’t. Two ad-
ministrations in a row, we have. 
I strongly recommend today that the 
Armed Services Committees in both 
bodies begin the process of looking at 
what the true length of time should be 
and what exceptions and exemptions 
need to be there. 
Although General Austin is a very 
qualified individual, he still will have 
subordinates whom he helped promote. 
He still will have people whom he is ex-
tremely close to. And that creates a 
question of civilian leadership. 
So although I am not here today to 
speak in any way against the general 
or any way against his predecessor, 
General Mattis, I am saying that it is 
time for this body, after this vote, to 
move to a deliberative process and reg-
ular order and begin asking: Is 10 years 
right? Is 7 years right? 
If 1 year is right, what will be the re-
quirements for that individual before 
we again face that with some future 
highly qualified former military per-
son? 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
LYNCH). 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Washington for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 335, legislation to allow Presi-
dent Biden to appoint General Lloyd J. 
Austin, III, as our next Secretary of 
Defense. Throughout my tenure on the 
National Security Subcommittee, I 
have had the personal opportunity to 
meet with and interact with General 
Austin on numerous occasions in the 
field during the course of several of our 
oversight investigations. 
b 1500 
Beginning in the early stages of Op-
eration Enduring Freedom, we met in 
Kabul, Afghanistan, during his deploy-
ment as commander of Combined Joint 
Task Force 180. I dealt with General 
Austin again in the midst of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom as well as during Oper-
ation New Dawn. We also met in Bagh-
dad during his multiple deployments as 
commander of the Multinational Corps 
and 
commander 
of 
United 
States 
Forces-Iraq. 
And I have personally received mul-
tiple intelligence briefings from Gen-
eral Austin in his capacity as com-
mander of U.S. Central Command. By 
the way, he was the first African Amer-
ican to lead that critically important 
combat command. 
Throughout the congressional inves-
tigations into the progress of U.S. mili-
tary diplomatic and reconstruction ef-
forts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and 
other regional conflicts, General Aus-
tin has never failed to provide us with 
direct access to the battlefield and the 
straight and honest and hard facts as 
he saw them on the ground. 
His assessment proved to be critical 
to our oversight mission and the devel-
opment of legislation concerning U.S. 
defense, national security, and coun-
terterrorism policies. 
He always demonstrated a maximum 
respect for the constitutional oversight 
role of the United States Congress and 
clearly held the highest regard for the 
civilian leadership of the Department 
of Defense. 
Mr. Speaker, General Austin is espe-
cially qualified and deserving of a con-
gressional exemption that will allow 
President Biden his appointment as 
Secretary of Defense. I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support H.R. 335. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
think I would like to raise the ques-
tion, what would Abraham Lincoln do, 
a man who faced the turmoil of a di-
vided Nation. I think he would look for 
an individual like General Mr. Lloyd 
Austin, someone who had had the bal-
ance of seeing life as a civilian but 
being an impeccable leader of the 
United States military. 
Mr. Speaker, before I came to this 
floor, I walked down Independence Ave-
nue to greet the young men and women 
in the National Guard who had come 
here from Texas. I wanted to let them 
know how important it was for them to 
be here to defend the citadel of democ-
racy and how grateful we were that we 
had a peaceful transition of power yes-
terday. 
What I see in Mr. Austin is a recogni-
tion that civilian control of the mili-
tary has been a bedrock principle of 
our democracy since the founding of 
our Republic. Yet, at the same time, in 
the backdrop of the last 4 years, I 
think he is needed for two reasons. 
One, the military has faced an enor-
mous amount of instability. They were 
called ‘‘suckers’’ and ‘‘losers.’’ Gen-
erals were criticized. So you need 
someone who is a military person’s 
military person, someone they know is 
part of the team. 
Then you need someone who can 
build that morale. Yes, we had morale 
in 
the 
previous 
administration 
of 
President Barack Obama, having re-
spected them. Now, I believe we must 
give President Joe Biden the oppor-
tunity for his Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who will support this concept, knowing 
that we believe that civilian control of 
the military is a bedrock. 
I do think that we cannot call this a 
precedent. One and two is not a prece-
dent. I do think we can look at maybe 
some other definitions of what it 
means. 
But a man who is able to end a war 
of 150,000 soldiers coming home is a 
man who can lead the United States 
military in a spirit of lifting the mo-
rale, providing stability, and calling 
them the brave men and women that 
they are. 
Let’s support the waiver. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, I rise in support of H.R. 335, 
which provides an exception to a limitation 
against appointment of persons as Secretary 
of Defense within seven years of relief from 
active duty as a regular commissioned officer 
of the Armed Forces so that President Biden 
can nominate retired four-star Gen. Lloyd J. 
Austin III to serve as the next Secretary of De-
fense. 
Gen. Austin retired from active duty in 2016, 
which under current law (10 U.S.C. § 113(a)), 
makes him ineligible for appointment as Sec-
retary of Defense. 
Civilian control of the military has been a 
bedrock principle of our democracy since the 
founding of the Republic. 
That principle has served the nation well 
and we should depart from it only where there 
is compelling reason to do so. 
Indeed, in the history of the Department of 
Defense, the only Defense Secretary ever 
given a waiver was then-Secretary of State, 
General George Marshall—who was provided 
an individual waiver in 1950 at the height of 
the Korean War in a stand-alone bill approved 
by the Congress. 
That is why I did not support granting waiver 
for General Mattis to be nominated as Sec-
retary of Defense in the last administration. 
Even General Mattis is a great general and a 
great American and served well as Secretary 
of Defense. 
But the experience of the last four years 
leads me to a different result today. 
For four years, the Department of Defense 
has had to deal with attempts by the last 
President and his staff to undermine the inde-
pendence and capability of the Department of 
Defense, going so far as to refer to the men 
and women who risk their lives to keep us free 
as ‘‘suckers’’ and ‘‘losers’’ and appointing un-
qualified persons as Acting Secretary of De-
fense and to other senior positions. 
The Pentagon needs—the United States 
needs—an 
experienced, 
Senate-confirmed 
Secretary of Defense to restore morale and 
regularity as soon as possible. 
I agree with President Biden that Gen. Aus-
tin’s many strengths and intimate knowledge 
of the Department of Defense and our govern-
ment are uniquely matched to the challenges 
and crises we face. 
The next Secretary of Defense will need to 
immediately quarterback an enormous logis-
tics operation to help distribute COVID–19 
vaccines widely and equitably. 
General Austin oversaw the largest logistical 
operation undertaken by the Army in six dec-
ades—the Iraq drawdown of 150,000 service 
personnel.

H216 
January 21, 2021 
The next Secretary of Defense will need to 
ensure the well-being and resilience of our 
servicemembers and their families, strained by 
almost two decades of war. 
General Austin knows the incredible cost of 
war and the hardships experienced by the 
families that pay it. 
The next Secretary of Defense will have to 
make sure that our armed forces reflect and 
promote the full diversity of our nation. 
General Austin is uniquely qualified to lead 
and oversee this effort to ensure that every 
member of the armed forces is treated with 
dignity and respect, including Black, Latino, 
Asian American, Native American, women, 
and LGBTQ+ service members. 
General Austin, who was born in Mobile, 
Alabama and raised in Thomasville, Georgia, 
graduated from the United States Military 
Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree 
in 1975 and rose through the Army’s ranks 
during his distinguished and trailblazing ca-
reer, becoming only the sixth African American 
to attain the rank of an Army four-star general, 
and over his nearly four-decade military ca-
reer, challenged his beloved institution to grow 
more inclusive and more diverse at every 
step. 
General Austin was the first African Amer-
ican general officer to lead an Army corps in 
combat and the first African American to com-
mand an entire theater of war, and if con-
firmed, will be the first African American to 
helm the Defense Department, which will sig-
nal to every American and every member of 
the Armed Forces that the country they pledge 
the last full measure of devotion is one of end-
less possibilities. 
Any lingering concerns I may have about in-
juring the sacred principle of civilian control 
over the military have been laid to rest by the 
Armed Services Committee Chairman SMITH’s 
representations that General Austin has as-
sured him that he understands this crucial 
principle and that he is completely committed 
to upholding it. 
In addition, Chairman SMITH represents that 
General Austin has agreed to appear before 
the members of the House Armed Services 
Committee to address the issue, and he has 
already spoken to numerous House members 
and made it clear that he will ensure that civil-
ian control of the military is maintained. 
Finally, President Biden has also already 
expressed his intent to nominate civilians with 
strong backgrounds and expertise to fill the 
roles of Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under 
Secretary of Defense for Policy, and Chief of 
Staff to the Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. Speaker, we also cannot overlook the 
impact of January 6, 2021 on the decision we 
are called upon to make. 
On that day, the U.S. Capitol, was attacked 
and breached by angry mob of insurrection-
ists, comprised of an inordinate number of 
white supremacists and white nationalists, in-
tent on preventing the Congress from carrying 
out its constitutionally imposed responsibility of 
counting electoral votes and announcing the 
election of the President and Vice-President. 
This represent a dangerous escalation in 
the activities of what FBI Director Wray testi-
fied to Congress is the greatest domestic ter-
ror threat facing the nation. 
Equally disturbing is that troubling evidence 
continues to emerge that the military itself has 
servicemembers sympathetic to extreme views 
and white supremacist causes. 
The appointment of the first African Amer-
ican to lead the Department of Defense in the 
nation’s history will send a powerful signal that 
racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia, 
and other divisive, anti-social, and anti-Amer-
ican attitudes and actions have no place in the 
Armed Forces and will not be tolerated. 
For all of these reasons, I urge all Members 
to join me in voting for H.R. 335, granting the 
waiver needed to pave the way for Secretary- 
designate Lloyd J. Austin III to serve as Sec-
retary of Defense. 
[From the Hill, Jan. 19, 2021] 
LLOYD AUSTIN IS THE RIGHT NOMINEE FOR DE-
FENSE SECRETARY AND THE RIGHT LEADER 
FOR THIS MOMENT 
(By Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D–TX), Opinion 
Contributor) 
As a senior member of Congress and a sen-
ior member of the House Homeland Security 
Committee, I know the importance of domes-
tic security and the defense of our nation. 
Retired General Austin, I believe, can bring 
that balance and that is why he deserves a 
congressional waiver to become President- 
elect Biden’s secretary of Defense. I am 
going to support President-elect Joe Biden’s 
nomination of retired General Lloyd Austin 
as the 28th U.S. secretary of Defense. 
First, let me acknowledge that I did not 
support giving a waiver to General James 
Mattis to become the secretary of Defense 
nominated by President Donald J. Trump in 
2017. My opposition was not because I did not 
have respect for General Mattis who might 
have warranted such a waiver, but it was 
rather because of the view that I had of the 
United States military at that time. Presi-
dent Barack Obama handed off to the Trump 
administration a military that was strong in 
morale and a stable organization. After all, 
the military under his command was able to 
capture our greatest enemy—Osama bin 
Laden. His capture was an enormous boost to 
the Pentagon and to the overall military 
rank and file. Military personnel and fami-
lies were treated with dignity and their 
needs were responded to expeditiously. Cer-
tainly, improvement could have been made, 
but generally the United States military was 
in very good shape. On the other hand, in 
2020, my concern is that throughout the last 
four years the military has been under at-
tack by negative comments on generals and 
by a succession of secretaries of Defense. 
There is a great need to bring in a person 
who can first of all boost the morale of our 
men and women in uniform who sacrifice 
their lives on behalf of the people of this na-
tion, and their families every day. Second-
arily, now we need stability and a firm hand 
that shows the balance between the needs of 
the military and guidance as a civilian lead-
er. I believe after listening to Mr. Austin in 
our conversation, it is clear that his view of 
the role of the secretary of Defense is solidly 
based on the fact that the Commander in 
Chief is his boss and will be the guiding force 
on the policies and on the vision for action. 
This is a time for impeccable leadership to 
bring about a morality boost and stability to 
our men and women in uniform. And for that 
reason, I truly believe this is a distinct and 
different time, and that General Austin who 
has been a civilian for a good period of time 
knows the role of a civilian leader and will 
act accordingly. I believe more that this is 
the right decision at the right time. 
Lloyd Austin, a retired General, is an ac-
complished and respected trailblazer in the 
United States Army. He is a trusted and cri-
sis-tested leader who has broken barriers in 
his historic ascent to the highest ranks of 
the military. With more than 40 years of 
service, Retired General Lloyd Austin is a 
deeply experienced and highly decorated 
commander who has served with distinction 
in several of the Pentagon’s most crucial 
roles. He is a son of the South born in Mo-
bile, Ala., and grew up in Thomasville, Ga. 
He graduated from West Point United States 
Military Academy and later earned degrees 
from Auburn University, Webster University, 
the Army Command and General Staff Col-
lege and the Army War College. 
Mr. Lloyd Austin was promoted to Lieu-
tenant General in 2006 and assumed com-
mand of the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort 
Bragg. And in 2009 he handed over his com-
mand to become the Director of the Joint 
Staff. He retired from the U.S. Army in 2016 
as the first African American to serve as 
Commander of CENTCOM, the U.S. Central 
Command, where he oversaw America’s mili-
tary strategy and joint operations through-
out the Middle East and in Afghanistan. 
He was the chief architect of the military 
campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq 
and Syria and became the second highest 
ranking commander in Iraq, taking com-
mand of the Multi-National Corps—Iraq. 
Mr. Lloyd Austin is highly decorated with 
many awards and decorations including med-
als for Defense Distinguished Service Med-
als, Army Distinguished Service Medals, a 
Silver Star, Defense Superior Service Med-
als, and a Legion of Merit medal. 
If confirmed, Lloyd Austin will become the 
first African American secretary of Defense 
which culminates a barrier-breaking career 
as the first African American general officer 
to command an Army Division in combat, to 
lead a Corps in combat, to command an en-
tire theater of war, and to serve as Com-
mander of U.S. Central Command. 
Secretary-designate Austin has proven and 
demonstrated 
extraordinary 
leadership 
across a lifetime of distinguished service and 
is well prepared to lead our nation’s military 
as a strong and dedicated civilian leader. 
The nation needs a leader over the Pen-
tagon that respects civilian control, to build 
up morale of our armed forces, and bring 
consistency, stability, and leadership at the 
highest level to the Department of Defense. 
That is Lloyd Austin, retired General. Fur-
ther, as an African American woman, I be-
lieve this historic moment will further heal 
and unify the nation. 
Secretary-designate Lloyd Austin has pre-
viously been confirmed by the Senate be-
cause of his impeccable commitment to duty 
and his reputation. As a proud American who 
loves his country just as much out of uni-
form as in uniform, he deserves a waiver by 
the Congress and deserves to be confirmed 
for this critical role of overseeing our mili-
tary forces and protecting our great nation. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin is an example 
of why America is still that ‘‘shining city on 
the hill’’ and why he should be confirmed by 
the United States Senate for secretary of De-
fense. Retired General Lloyd Austin is the 
right person for this right and momentous 
time in our nation’s history. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding me 
the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
favor of granting a waiver for retired 
Army General Lloyd Austin and this 
historic nomination to serve as the 
28th Secretary of Defense, the first Af-
rican American in U.S. history.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H217 
January 21, 2021 
For 
four 
decades, 
Secretary-des-
ignate Austin served our Nation val-
iantly in the United States Army. Be-
fore retiring, he led one of the most im-
portant commands in the military, 
CENTCOM, 
or 
Central 
Command, 
where he oversaw America’s military 
strategy and joint operations through-
out the Middle East. 
During his service in the Middle 
East, he oversaw the safe return of 
150,000 brave American troops, working 
closely with our allies as a statesman 
and a diplomat. 
As our Commander in Chief, I sup-
port President Biden in his selection of 
Lloyd Austin to protect our national 
security, strengthen our global alli-
ances, depoliticize the Defense Depart-
ment, and be a leader and role model 
for our brave servicemembers. 
I had the opportunity to speak di-
rectly with Secretary-designate Austin 
about the needs of servicemembers and 
their families in Nevada’s Fourth Dis-
trict. He committed to work with me 
on issues important to those service-
members and their families stationed 
at Nellis and Creech Air Force Bases 
and the Nevada Test Site, including 
issues dealing with housing, mental 
health, childcare, and education. 
His leadership, his experience, and 
his commitment to civil control of the 
military will ensure our country meets 
its national security needs. 
As our Secretary of Defense, he will 
also send a powerful message of belong-
ing to all servicemembers but particu-
larly to members of color, who rep-
resent more than 40 percent of our 
armed services today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this historic nomination, ap-
prove the waiver required today, and 
confirm Secretary-designate Austin’s 
nomination. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I rise in support of the requested waiv-
er of the Secretary of Defense nominee, 
retired four-star General Lloyd S. Aus-
tin, III. 
President Biden recognizes the need 
to have the most qualified individuals 
in his Cabinet to right the ship from 
day one. The issues of instability of our 
Department of Defense, morale, and a 
desire to engage more vigorously with 
the world require that a nominee be 
one who has the type of career that 
General Austin does. 
General Austin’s distinguished career 
and experience as a commander of the 
U.S. Central Command and Vice Chief 
of Staff of the U.S. Army have prepared 
him to be ideal for the task at hand. 
We agree that the separation of Ac-
tive Duty military and civilian is im-
portant. Moreover, I have full con-
fidence, however, that the Secretary- 
designate shares these values, in that 
he came to the House, reaching out to 
this body in a way that shows rev-
erence for the continued promotion and 
defense of civilian control of the mili-
tary. 
Lastly, having an African-American 
Secretary of Defense is highly impor-
tant at this time, as the military must 
address the growing evidence of sym-
pathy towards dangerous conspiracies 
and White supremacist causes amongst 
servicemembers—evidence made expo-
nentially troubling due to the fact that 
a large percentage of servicemembers 
are people of color. 
General Lloyd Austin is the right 
person for the job at the time at hand, 
and Congress must allow him to get 
through and get the job done. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for the waiver for General Austin. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, at this time, I am prepared to close, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
First, I want to thank my friend and 
colleague Chairman SMITH, and I look 
forward to working with him over this 
2-year cycle. 
The debate we have had today is a se-
rious one. The executive branch is ask-
ing the legislative branch to waive a 
law for its benefit. President Biden 
knew this law when he selected Gen-
eral Austin. He could have made an-
other selection. 
But, as I said earlier, President 
Trump got a waiver with General 
Mattis, and I believe it is only right 
that I supported one waiver for General 
Austin. 
Mr. Speaker, it is critical that the 
President has his national security 
team in place as soon as possible. I 
look forward to working with General 
Austin if he is confirmed, and I urge a 
favorable vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, from this debate, it is 
clear that Mr. Austin is highly quali-
fied to be Secretary of Defense. It is 
also clear that he has a full apprecia-
tion of the importance of civilian con-
trol of the military. 
And, finally, it is clear that he is 
unique to this moment. His experiences 
as an African-American man coming up 
through the military puts him in a 
unique position to address the prob-
lems of White supremacy and a lack of 
diversity across the military in addi-
tion to all of the other challenges that 
we have heard from speakers today. 
There is no question that he is quali-
fied for this job and that he should be 
given the waiver so that he can serve 
in this position. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to close by 
speaking to the urgency of why we 
need to do this today and how we got 
to this point. 
When I first heard that Secretary 
Austin was going to be the selection, I 
will confess that I was not thrilled 
about it, not because of Secretary Aus-
tin—I know him, I have worked with 
him, and I think he will do an out-
standing job—but because I realized 
the responsibility that it put on this 
House. 
By and large—not ‘‘by and large’’— 
entirely, nominees are the business of 
the Senate. They confirm; the Presi-
dent picks. But because he picked 
someone who would require a waiver, 
we had to engage. 
And I understood the urgency of get-
ting that done, even while the Com-
mittee on Armed Services was still in 
the midst of dealing with the Presi-
dent’s veto of the defense bill and try-
ing to get the override done. But I 
knew the urgency. We had to find a 
way to get it done. 
And, Mr. Speaker, I want to make 
perfectly clear that Mr. ROGERS has 
been an outstanding partner in work-
ing towards the urgency of moving this 
forward. The process arguments get 
lost in the weeds. There were a whole 
bunch of things we had to do to be or-
ganized as a committee, to be ready to 
meet the requirements that we had, 
and we tried our best to do it. 
Now, it is my humble opinion that we 
met those requirements even if we 
didn’t have a public hearing. As has 
been stated by many Members, right 
before this vote we had 2 hours with 
Mr. Austin over in committee, in which 
members, Republican and Democratic 
members alike, were able to ask him 
questions and get his answers. 
And I will tell you, I feel even strong-
er about the need to confirm him after 
that conversation. Not only was he in-
telligent, not only was he on point, not 
only did he understand the issues, but 
he had something, frankly, not every-
body in the Pentagon has: He seemed 
to genuinely respect us. He seemed to 
genuinely want to answer our ques-
tions, want to deal with us as a coequal 
branch of government. That is enor-
mously important. 
But the urgency is why we are here 
today and why we didn’t wait the extra 
week or 10 days. Joe Biden is Presi-
dent. He doesn’t have a Secretary of 
Defense. Every day that goes past that 
he doesn’t have a Secretary of Defense 
is a huge problem for a variety of rea-
sons. 
Let’s start with the fact that much 
has been made that this waiver is prob-
lematic because we did it 4 years ago 
and now we are doing it again; the ex-
ception has become the rule. 
Well, if it makes anybody feel better, 
there have actually been four separate 
Secretaries, people in the Secretary of 
Defense position, in between Mattis 
and Austin. So it is really just, sort of, 
two out of six. 
That many people have churned 
through the leadership role in the Pen-
tagon. And while the people at the Pen-
tagon have done an amazing job fight-
ing through that, it is still problematic 
to have to have that much turnover. 
The disruption that President Trump 
brought to the Pentagon cannot be un-
derestimated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H218 
January 21, 2021 
I will never forget being in the meet-
ing in the White House when we were 
talking about the pullout from Syria 
when someone dared to bring up Sec-
retary Mattis’s opinion—recently de-
parted Secretary Mattis from the De-
partment of Defense—and President 
Trump just lit in to Secretary Mattis, 
called him weak, called him a terrible 
human being. 
Meanwhile, sitting right next to him 
was the incoming Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, who 
had worked with Jim Mattis. And this 
is his new boss. 
Mr. Speaker, the disruption at the 
Pentagon has been enormous. They 
need a fully confirmed Secretary of De-
fense immediately to begin to thor-
oughly clean up that mess and get the 
Pentagon back to being as effective as 
it needs to be. 
b 1515 
Also, and I will not belabor this point 
at all, we have a complex threat envi-
ronment, right? Let’s just say that. We 
heard about it on the committee today, 
about China, Russia, Iran, the Middle 
East, North Korea, not to mention the 
domestic insurrection that we all wit-
nessed here just a couple of weeks ago. 
There is an urgency to this. 
If there wasn’t an urgency to this, I 
would have waited a week and said, 
okay, let’s take however much time. 
People can figure out their ratios, and 
pick their members, and whatever. 
There is an urgency. So instead of 
having the public hearing, we had a 
very, very successful briefing. 
The House this time has done its job 
in a way that it didn’t 4 years ago when 
we simply took Mattis, didn’t hear 
from him, and voted on it. 
There is a minor point of whether or 
not we mark this up in committee. 
This is not a complicated bill. Either 
Austin gets the waiver and he serves, 
or he doesn’t. 
There is really nothing to mark up. 
It is a question for the House. That is 
why we came to the full House. 
This House, with the cooperation, I 
may say, of Mr. ROGERS and all the 
Members has done its due diligence, 
above and beyond. We have concluded, 
without question, that the waiver is 
appropriate. Lloyd Austin will be an 
outstanding Secretary of Defense. He 
deserves this waiver, and our country 
deserves a fully confirmed Secretary of 
Defense as soon as we can possibly get 
that done, which, for the purposes of 
the House, is now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my support for H.R. 335, which would 
provide a waiver to allow for full Senate con-
sideration of General Lloyd Austin’s nomina-
tion as Secretary of Defense. While I have 
great concerns over use of this process to ap-
point former military leaders to senior civilian 
positions at the Department of Defense, and I 
believe that civilian control of the military is 
critical to our democracy, I support this waiver 
for General Austin for several reasons. 
The first is the need for clear and effective 
leadership at the Pentagon. The previous ad-
ministration drastically politicized the Depart-
ment of Defense and hollowed out existing 
leadership to put in place less experienced po-
litical allies to do former President Trump’s 
bidding. This has left our nation even more 
vulnerable during a number of national and 
international crises, including the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic, the recent cyber attack 
on our government systems by Russia, and 
rising tensions with Iran and throughout the 
Middle East. General Austin brings a distin-
guished career in military leadership, an un-
wavering commitment to our nation’s security, 
and the respect of our men and women in uni-
form and will provide a needed steady hand at 
the Department of Defense. 
Second, Lloyd Austin possess the skills and 
temperament to address the challenges our 
country faces. President Biden noted when 
discussing his selection of General Austin that 
he played a vital role in bringing American 
forces home from Iraq using diplomatic skill 
and an ability to work cooperatively with his 
Iraqi counterparts, further noting that Austin 
had met every challenge in his career with 
‘‘extraordinary skill and profound personal de-
cency.’’ These qualities will be necessary as 
America works to regain its leadership on the 
world stage, rebuild alliances, and address the 
many challenges our country faces. 
Third, General Austin understands the im-
portance of civilian control of the military to 
our democracy and has expressed his com-
mitment to this principle. Unlike the last time 
a waiver was sought when Secretary Mattis 
was prevented from testifying before Congress 
by President Trump and was unable to reas-
sure American people about the importance of 
maintaining civilian control of the Department 
of Defense, General Austin did testify. During 
his confirmation hearing, General Austin ex-
pressed full understanding of the concerns 
over his appointment given he has been re-
tired from active service for only four years. 
He highlighted his experience implementing ci-
vilian directives, and his understanding of the 
need for a different perspective as a civilian 
leader. I am confident that under the leader-
ship of Lloyd Austin and President Biden, that 
principle will be preserved and protected. 
Finally, General Austin’s confirmation as 
Secretary of Defense would be a watershed 
moment as the first African American to hold 
that office in our nation’s history. In a period 
where racial tensions have led to resentment 
among Americans, a rise in white nationalist 
extremism, and peaceful demonstrations in 
U.S. cities often turning violent, General Aus-
tin’s appointment would demonstrate that 
America embraces the diversity of our country, 
and that representation in all facets of our 
government and national security structures 
matters. 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the waiver for General Lloyd J. 
Austin, III to become our next Secretary of De-
fense. However, I want to be clear that this 
vote should not be seen as supporting a 
precedent for routine granting of waivers for 
future noncivilian nominees to lead the Depart-
ment of Defense. We must keep the waiver 
requirement in place, and waivers should be 
reserved for the most extreme circumstances. 
I strongly support civilian leadership of the 
military, and the waiver requirement was cre-
ated to protect this important principle. That 
being said, our country is facing the simulta-
neous threats of a global pandemic, unprece-
dented cyberattacks on our government, and 
the recent departure of a president who at-
tempted to enlist military personnel to disrupt 
civilian protest. Considering these extraor-
dinary circumstances, we need a qualified 
Secretary of Defense in place immediately. 
Under normal circumstances, a public hear-
ing before the House Armed Services Com-
mittee would be an important part of the waiv-
er process. Unfortunately, because the House 
Armed Services Committee is not fully set up, 
the committee cannot hold public hearings on 
the waiver yet. However, unlike the Trump Ad-
ministration, the Biden Administration has 
made General Austin readily available to Con-
gress, and he has demonstrated that he un-
derstands the importance of civilian leadership 
of the Pentagon. 
With these assurances, I express my sup-
port for General Austin’s waiver to move for-
ward in this confirmation process. However, I 
reiterate to my colleagues that this vote can-
not be seen to support a precedent to grant 
future waivers of the cooling-off period for 
non-civilian Secretaries of Defense. 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 
H.R. 335, a bill to provide Ret. General Lloyd 
Austin an exception to a limitation against ap-
pointments of persons as United States Sec-
retary of Defense within seven years of relief 
from active duty as a regular commissioned 
officer of the Armed Forces. 
It is incumbent upon Congress to consider a 
waiver for such persons who are deemed not 
far enough removed from active duty to head 
the Department of Defense. Previous exemp-
tions through a waiver have only been granted 
twice in our nation’s history, most recently in 
2017. However, my colleagues and I in the 
Congressional Black Caucus find it altogether 
fitting and proper that Ret. General Lloyd Aus-
tin is the recipient of the third. 
Ret. General Austin is an experienced lead-
er, a brilliant strategist, and a decorated hero. 
He has seen war from the frontlines as a sol-
dier, and from afar as a commander. He is not 
one that seeks the spotlight or controversy, 
but one who quietly, but confidently gets the 
job done—earning him the nickname of ‘‘invis-
ible general.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, as the first African American to 
hold the title of Secretary of Defense, I am 
confident that Ret. General Austin would carry 
out the mission of the Department of Defense 
with the utmost sense of professionalism and 
civility. That is why I am proud to support his 
waiver today and look forward to his swift con-
firmation in the Senate. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my support for President Biden’s nomi-
nation of the uniquely qualified General Lloyd 
J. Austin III (U.S. Army, Ret.) to serve as Sec-
retary of Defense. Today, we are debating 
whether in the case of Gen. Austin’s confirma-
tion there should be a waiver of the require-
ment that former military officers be separated 
from active service for seven years before 
serving as Defense Secretary. Civilian control 
of the military is foundational to our demo-
cratic republic, and any action that could be 
perceived as affecting that principle must be 
carefully considered. 
I do have reservations. If such an exception 
becomes a pattern, it may become a routine 
practice. Yet we find ourselves in times that

are anything but routine, and I am convinced 
that current circumstances warrant this waiver. 
On January 6, 2021, violent insurrectionists 
stormed and attacked the U.S. Capitol at-
tempting to overturn the will of the voters and 
impede the peaceful transfer of power to a 
new, 
democratically-elected 
administration. 
The current state of heightened security risks, 
the lack of cooperation by former President 
Trump 
for 
a 
successful 
transition, 
the 
emboldening of white supremacists and seri-
ous threat of domestic terrorism, and numer-
ous other unprecedented challenges make it 
imperative that President Biden’s national se-
curity team be in place as expeditiously as 
possible. This certainly includes a Secretary of 
Defense, a role that is also critical to vaccine 
distribution and other elements of our re-
sponse to the coronavirus pandemic. 
President Biden has been elected by the 
people to serve as our Commander in Chief, 
and I respect his decision to nominate General 
Austin, a well-respected, experienced, and 
barrier-breaking nominee, to meet the many 
challenges our nation faces. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 21, 2021 
No. 12 
Senate 
The Senate met at noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, You are our shelter 
from the storm. Keep us from shame. 
Lord, You often answer prayers in 
mysterious ways. As the Heavens are 
higher than the Earth, so are Your 
thoughts higher than our contempla-
tion. 
Inspire our Senators to be so sen-
sitive to Your Spirit that they can rec-
ognize Your gentle nudge. Make them 
glad that You are near. 
Lord, equip our lawmakers with wis-
dom and foresight for these challenging 
times. May Your peace go with them as 
they seek to do Your will. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is 
nice to see you back in that position. 
Yesterday, Mr. President, we began a 
new chapter in the history of our Na-
tion. On the same steps stormed by do-
mestic terrorists 2 weeks ago, we held 
a ceremony to the enduring power of 
our democracy. It was a symbol to the 
world that America is back and a mes-
sage to those domestic terrorists that 
they will never prevail. 
Even as the festivities were in full 
swing, our new President and this new 
Senate commenced the work of re-
building our country and healing its 
wounds. With the stroke of a pen, 
President Biden started the process of 
rejoining the United States to the 
Paris accords. He extended the pause 
on student loan payments, put an end 
to the Muslim travel ban, reinstalled 
safeguards for our Nation’s Dreamers, 
and put a halt on the ineffective border 
wall. 
Crucially, President Biden signed a 
number of orders to refocus the Federal 
Government’s efforts on fighting the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
The 
United 
States has rejoined the World Health 
Organization. A mask mandate has 
been issued for all Federal properties. 
And President Biden has named a new 
coronavirus response coordinator to 
manage vaccine distribution, which is 
so desperately needed and was such a 
failure under the Trump administra-
tion. 
Our country has suffered deeply from 
the chaotic, lackluster, and incom-
petent Federal response to COVID–19. 
As we cross the grim milestone of 
400,000—400,000—American 
fatalities 
from COVID, the Biden administration 
is wasting no time in marshaling the 
resources of the Federal Government 
into action and today released a na-
tional strategy to defeat the pandemic. 
What a concept—a President who ac-
tually takes the defining crisis of our 
time seriously. What a change—and 
how great is the need. 
Here in the Senate, the first order of 
business is to fulfill our constitutional 
duty to advise and consent on the 
President’s appointments to his Cabi-
net. Last night, the Senate confirmed 
the President’s selection for the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, Avril 
Haines. We appreciate the bipartisan 
cooperation to get her confirmation 
done yesterday, and we should con-
tinue in that spirit today. 
Traditionally, the Senate has con-
firmed several national security nomi-
nees for an incoming administration 
during their first few days. Even as 
power changes hands from one adminis-
tration to the other, the work of keep-
ing our Nation safe must not be paused 
or be disrupted. Foreign adversaries 
will seek to exploit this period of tran-
sition, and we cannot allow America’s 
military, intelligence, and national se-
curity policy to be disrupted by staff-
ing delays. 
In 2017, President Trump had his De-
fense 
Secretary 
and 
Secretary 
of 
Homeland Security in place on Inau-
guration Day. President Biden deserves 
his national security team in place as 
soon as possible, as well as key officials 
in charge of responding to the current 
health and economic crises. With the 
cooperation of our Republican col-
leagues, we can and should confirm the 
Secretaries of Defense, State, Home-
land Security, and Treasury without 
much delay. 
While national security is para-
mount, I would remind my colleagues 
that we are in the middle of an eco-
nomic crisis. The sooner we confirm a 
Treasury Secretary, the better. 
And so, as we begin the process of 
bringing our country back together, let 
the first week of this Congress be a col-
laboration between our two parties to 
confirm President Biden’s Cabinet.

Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Vice President Pence, 
Mr. President-elect, Madam Vice President- 
elect, Members of Congress and the judicial 
branch, former Presidents and First Ladies, 
Vice Presidents, leaders from abroad, and a 
whole bunch of Bidens, America, welcome to 
the 59th Presidential Inauguration, where in 
just a few moments Joe Biden and Kamala 
Harris will take their solemn oaths. 
This ceremony is the culmination of 244 
years of a democracy. It is a moment when 
leaders, brought to this stage by the will of 
the people, promise to be faithful to our Con-
stitution, to cherish it, and defend it. It is a 
moment when they become, as we all should 
be, guardians of our country. 
Have we become too jaded, too accustomed 
to the ritual of the passing of the torch of 
democracy to truly appreciate what a bless-
ing and a privilege it is to witness this mo-
ment? I think not. 
Two weeks ago, when an angry, violent 
mob staged an insurrection and desecrated 
this temple of our democracy, it awakened 
us to our responsibilities as Americans. This 
is the day when our democracy picks itself 
up, brushes off the dust, and does what 
America always does: It goes forward as a 
nation, under God, indivisible with liberty 
and justice for all. 
(Applause.) 
This conveyance of a sacred trust between 
our leaders and our people takes place in 
front of this shining Capitol dome for a rea-
son. When Abraham Lincoln gave his first in-
augural address in front of this Capitol, the 
dome was only partially constructed, braced 
by ropes of steel. He promised he would fin-
ish it. He was criticized for spending funds 
on it during the Civil War. To those critics, 
he replied, ‘‘If the people see the Capitol 
going on, it is a sign we intend the Union 
shall go on.’’ And it did, and it will. 
Generations of Americans gave their lives 
to preserve our Republic in this place. Great 
legislation to protect civil rights and eco-
nomic security and lead the world was de-
bated and crafted under this dome. Now, it 
falls on all of us—not just the two leaders we 
are inaugurating today—to take up the torch 
of our democracy, not as a weapon of polit-
ical arson but as an instrument for good. 
We pledge today never to take our democ-
racy for granted as we celebrate its remark-
able strength. We celebrate its resilience, its 
grit. We celebrate the ordinary people doing 
extraordinary things for our Nation, the doc-
tors and nurses on the frontline of this pan-
demic, the officers in the Capitol, a new gen-
eration never giving up hope for justice. 
We celebrate a new President, Joe Biden, 
who vows to restore the soul of America and 
cross the river of our divides to a higher 
plane. 
We celebrate our first African-American, 
first Asian-American, and first woman Vice 
President, Kamala Harris, who stands on the 
shoulders of so many on this platform who 
have forged the way to this day. When she 
takes the oath of office, little girls and boys 
across the world will know that anything 
and everything is possible. 
In the end, that is America: our democ-
racy, a country of so much good. Today, on 
these Capitol steps and before this glorious 
field of flags, we rededicate ourselves to its 
cause. 
Thank you. 
(Applause.) 
It is now my honor to introduce to you the 
Senator who has worked with me and so 
many others to make this ceremony pos-
sible, my friend and the chair of the Inau-
gural Committee, Missouri Senator Roy 
Blunt. 
(Applause.) 
Mr. BLUNT. Well, I should have known 
when Senator Klobuchar got involved, at 
least, there would be a touch of snow up here 
this morning. Of all the things we had con-
sidered, I don’t think snow was on my agen-
da until I walked out the door a moment 
ago. 
But thank you, Senator Klobuchar, and 
thanks to the other members of the Joint 
Congressional Committee on the Inaugura-
tion as we officially begin the 59th inaugural 
ceremony. I also want to thank the joint 
committee staff and our partners, particu-
larly our security partners, for the way they 
have 
dealt 
with 
unprecedented 
cir-
cumstances. 
When I chaired the inauguration 4 years 
ago, I shared President Reagan’s 1981 de-
scription of this event as ‘‘commonplace’’ 
and ‘‘miraculous.’’ It is ‘‘commonplace’’ be-
cause we have done it every 4 years since 
1789; it is miraculous because we have done it 
every 4 years since 1789. Americans have 
celebrated this moment during war, during 
depression, and now during pandemic. 
Once again, all three branches of our gov-
ernment come together as the Constitution 
envisions. Once again, we renew our commit-
ment to our determined democracy, forging 
a more perfect union. 
The theme for this inauguration, ‘‘Our De-
termined Democracy: Forging a more perfect 
union,’’ was announced by the joint com-
mittee before the election with the belief 
that the United States can only fulfill its 
promise and set an example for others if we 
are always working to be better than we 
have been. 
The Constitution established that deter-
mined democracy with its first three words, 
declaring the people as the source of the gov-
ernment. The Articles of Confederation 
hadn’t done that. The Magna Carta hadn’t 
done that. Only the Constitution says the 
government exists because the people are the 
source of the reason it exists. 
They immediately followed those first 
three words with the words ‘‘to form a more 
perfect union.’’ The Founders did not say to 
form a perfect union; they did not claim that 
in our new country nothing would need to be 
improved. Fortunately, they understood that 
always working to be better would be the 
hallmark of a great democracy. 
The freedoms we have today and the Na-
tion we have today is not here just because 
it happened, and they aren’t complete. A 
great democracy is working through the suc-
cesses and failures of our history, striving to 
be better than it had been. We are more than 
we have been, and we are less than we hope 
to be. The assault on our Capitol at this very 
place just 2 weeks ago reminds us that a gov-
ernment designed to balance and check itself 
is both fragile and resilient. 
During the last year, the pandemic chal-
lenged our free and open society and called 
for extraordinary determination and sac-
rifice and still challenges us today. Meeting 
that challenge head on have been and are our 
healthcare workers, scientists, first respond-
ers, essential frontline workers, and so many 
others we depend on in so many ways. 
Today, we come to this moment; people all 
over the world, as we are here, are watching

and will watch what we do here. Our govern-
ment comes together. The Congress and the 
courts join the transition of Executive re-
sponsibility. One political party is more 
pleased today and on every inaugural day 
than the other. But this is not a moment of 
division; it is a moment of unification. A 
new administration begins and brings with it 
a new beginning; and with that, our great na-
tional debate goes forward, and a determined 
democracy will continue to be essential in 
pursuit of a more perfect union and a better 
future for all Americans. What a privilege 
for me to join you today. 
Thank you. 
(Applause.) 
I am pleased to call to the podium a long-
time friend of the President-elect and his 
family, Father Leo O’Donovan, to lead us in 
an invocation. 
Please stand if you are able and remain 
standing for the national anthem and the 
pledge to our flag. 
Father O’DONOVAN. Gracious and mer-
ciful God, at this sacred time, we come be-
fore you in need, indeed on our knees. But we 
come still more with hope and with our eyes 
raised anew to the vision of a more perfect 
union in our land, a union of all our citizens 
to promote the general welfare and secure 
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our 
posterity. 
We are a people of many races, creeds, and 
colors, national backgrounds, cultures, and 
styles, now far more numerous and on land 
much vaster than when Archbishop John 
Carroll wrote his prayer for the inauguration 
of George Washington 232 years ago. 
Archbishop Carroll prayed that You, a Cre-
ator of all, would ‘‘assist with your Holy 
Spirit of counsel and fortitude the President 
of these United States, that his administra-
tion may be conducted in righteousness and 
be eminently useful to Your people.’’ 
Today, we confess our past failures to live 
according to our vision of equality, inclu-
sion, and freedom for all; yet we resolutely 
commit still more now to renewing the vi-
sion, to caring for one another in word and 
deed, especially the least fortunate among 
us, and so becoming a light for the world. 
There is a power in each and every one of 
us that lives by turning to every other one of 
us, a trust of the spirit to cherish and care 
and stand by others and, above all, those 
most in need. It is called love, and its path 
is to give ever more of itself. Today, it is 
called American patriotism, borne not of 
power and privilege, but of care for the com-
mon good, with malice toward none and with 
charity for all. 
For our new President, we beg of you the 
wisdom Solomon sought when he knelt be-
fore you and prayed for an understanding 
heart so that ‘‘I can govern your people . . . 
and know the difference between right and 
wrong.’’ 
We trust in the counsel of the letter of 
James: 
In any of you lacks wisdom, you should 
ask God, who gives generously to all without 
finding fault, and it will be given to you. 
Pope Francis has reminded us how impor-
tant it is to dream together. ‘‘By ourselves,’’ 
he wrote, ‘‘we risk seeing mirages, things 
that are not there. Dreams, on the other 
hand, are built together.’’ 
Be with us, Holy Mystery of Love, as we 
dream together. Help us under our new 
President to reconcile the people of our land, 
restore our dream, and invest it with peace 
and justice and the joy that is the overflow 
of love. 
To the glory of Your name forever. Amen. 
(Performance of the National Anthem by 
Lady Gaga, accompanied by the U.S. Marine 
Band.) 
(Fire Captain Andrea M. Hall, of the South 
Fulton Georgia Fire and Rescue Department, 
president of the International Association of 
Firefighters Local 3920 recited the Pledge of 
Allegiance.) 
(Applause.) 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. What you are all about 
to be part of, America, is a historic moment 
of firsts. 
To administer the oath to our first Afri-
can-American, our first Asian-American, and 
our first woman Vice President, Kamala Har-
ris, it is my great privilege to welcome to 
the inaugural stage the first Latina to ever 
serve on the Supreme Court of the United 
States of America: Justice Sonia Sotomayor. 
The Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court, SONIA SOTOMAYOR, administered 
to the Vice President-elect the oath of office 
prescribed by the Constitution, which she re-
peated as follows: 
I, KAMALA DEVI HARRIS, do solemnly 
swear that I will support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against all en-
emies foreign and domestic; that I will bear 
true faith and allegiance to the same; that I 
take this obligation freely, without any 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion; 
and that I will well and faithfully discharge 
the duties of the office on which I am about 
to enter. So help me God. 
(Applause.) 
(Jennifer Lopez performed ‘‘This Land Is 
Your Land’’ and ‘‘America the Beautiful’’ ac-
companied by the U.S. Marine Band.) 
(Applause.) 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Well, that was great. 
The Sun is shining and, Mr. President- 
elect, this is the first inauguration in the 
history of America where J-Lo was the 
warmup act for Chief Justice Roberts. 
With that, it is now my distinct honor to 
introduce the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of the United States, John Roberts, to 
administer the Presidential oath to the next 
President of the United States, Joseph R. 
Biden. 
(Applause.) 
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, 
JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., administered to 
the President-elect the oath of office pre-
scribed by the Constitution, which he re-
peated, as follows: 
I, JOSEPH ROBINETTE BIDEN, JR., do 
solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute 
the office of President of the United States 
and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the 
United States. So help me God. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Congratulations, Mr. 
President. 
(Applause.) 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. My fellow Americans—a 
moment we have all been waiting for—it is 
now my great privilege and high honor to be 
the first person to officially introduce the 
46th President of the United States, Joseph 
R. Biden, Jr. 
(Applause.) 
The PRESIDENT. Chief Justice Roberts, 
Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Lead-
er Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice Presi-
dent Pence, and my distinguished guests, my 
fellow Americans, this is America’s day. This 
is democracy’s day—a day of history and 
hope, of renewal and resolve. 
Through a crucible for the ages, America 
has been tested anew, and America has risen 
to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the tri-
umph not of a candidate but of a cause, the 
cause of democracy. The people—the will of 
the people—has been heard, and the will of 
the people has been heeded. 
We have learned again that democracy is 
precious, democracy is fragile, and at this 
hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. 
(Applause.) 
Now, on this hallowed ground, where just a 
few days ago violence sought to shake the 
Capitol’s very foundation, we come together 
as one Nation under God, indivisible, to 
carry out the peaceful transfer of power as 
we have for more than two centuries. 
As we look ahead in our uniquely Amer-
ican way—restless, bold, optimistic—and set 
our sights on a nation we know we can and 
we must be, I thank my predecessors of both 
parties for their presence here today. I thank 
them from the bottom of my heart. 
(Applause.) 
I know the resilience of our Constitution 
and the strength—the strength of our Na-
tion—as does President Carter, who I spoke 
with last night, who cannot be with us 
today, but whom we salute for his lifetime in 
service. 
I have just taken the sacred oath each of 
those patriots have taken, the oath first 
sworn by George Washington. But the Amer-
ican story depends not on any one of us, not 
on some of us, but on all of us—on we, the 
people, who seek a more perfect union. This 
is a great nation. We are good people. Over 
the centuries, through storm and strife, in 
peace and at war, we have come so far, but 
we still have far to go. 
We will press forward with speed and ur-
gency for we have much to do in this winter 
of peril and significant possibilities—much 
to repair, much to restore, much to heal, 
much to build, and much to gain. Few people 
in our Nation’s history have been more chal-
lenged or found a time more challenging or 
difficult than the time we are in now. A 
once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks 
the country has taken as many lives in 1 
year as America lost in all of World War II. 
Millions of jobs have been lost, and hun-
dreds of thousands of businesses closed. A 
cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the 
making, moves us. The dream of justice for 
all will be deferred no longer. 
(Applause.) 
A cry for survival comes from the planet 
itself, a cry that can’t be any more desperate 
or any more clear now—the rise of political 
extremism, White supremacy, domestic ter-
rorism that we must confront and we will de-
feat. 
(Applause.) 
To overcome these challenges, to restore 
the soul and secure the future of America re-
quires so much more than words; it requires 
the most elusive of all things in a democ-
racy: unity. Unity. 
In another January on New Year’s Day in 
1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emanci-
pation Proclamation. When he put pen to 
paper, the President said: 
If my name ever goes down in history, it 
will be for this act, and my whole soul is in 
it. 
My whole soul is in it today, on this Janu-
ary day. My whole soul is in this: bringing 
America together, uniting our people, unit-
ing our Nation. I ask every American to join 
me in this cause. 
(Applause.) 
Uniting to fight the foes we face—anger, 
resentment and hatred, extremism, lawless-
ness, violence, disease, joblessness, and hope-
lessness—with unity, we can do great things, 
important things. We can right wrongs. We 
can put people to work in good jobs. We can 
teach our children in safe schools. We can 
overcome the deadly virus. We can reward 
work and rebuild the middle class and make 
healthcare secure for all. We can deliver ra-
cial justice, and we can make America, once 
again, the leading force for good in the 
world. 
I know, speaking of unity, it can sound to 
some like a foolish fantasy these days. I 
know the forces that divide us are deep and 
they are real, but I also know they are not 
new. Our history has been a constant strug-
gle between the American ideal, that we all 
are created equal, and the harsh ugly reality

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S78 
January 21, 2021 
that racism, nativism, fear, and demoniza-
tion have long torn us apart. The battle is 
perennial, and victory is never assured. 
Through Civil War, the Great Depression, 
World War, 9/11, and through struggle, sac-
rifice, and setbacks, our better angels have 
always prevailed. In each of these moments, 
enough of us—enough of us—have come to-
gether to carry all of us forward, and we can 
do that now. 
History, faith, and reason show the way, 
the way of unity. We can see each other not 
as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can 
treat each other with dignity and respect. 
We can join forces, stop the shouting, and 
lower the temperature. For without unity, 
there is no peace, only bitterness and fury; 
no progress, only exhausting outrage; and no 
nation, only a state of chaos. This is our his-
toric moment of crisis and challenge, and 
unity is the path forward, and we must meet 
this moment as the United States of Amer-
ica. 
If we do that, I guarantee you we will not 
fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in 
America when we have acted together. So, 
today, at this time, in this place, let’s start 
afresh—all of us. Let’s begin to listen to one 
another again, hear one another, see one an-
other, and show respect to one another. Poli-
tics doesn’t have to be a raging fire destroy-
ing everything in its path. Every disagree-
ment doesn’t have to be a cause for total 
war, and we must reject the culture in which 
facts themselves are manipulated and even 
manufactured. 
(Applause.) 
My fellow Americans, we have to be dif-
ferent than this. America has to be better 
than this, and I believe America is so much 
better than this. Just look around. Here we 
stand in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as 
was mentioned earlier, completed amid the 
Civil War when the Union itself was literally 
hanging in the balance; yet we endured. We 
prevailed. 
Here we stand, looking out on the great 
Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. 
Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at an-
other inaugural, thousands of protesters 
tried to block brave women marching for the 
right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing 
in of the first woman in American history 
elected to national office, Vice President 
Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me things can’t 
change. 
(Applause.) 
Here we stand, across the Potomac from 
Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave 
the last full measure of devotion rest in eter-
nal peace. Here we stand, just days after a ri-
otous mob thought they could use violence 
to silence the will of the people, to stop the 
work of our democracy, and to drive us from 
this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will 
never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever—not ever. 
(Applause.) 
To all those who supported our campaign, 
I am humbled by the faith you placed in us. 
To all those who did not support us, let me 
say this: Hear me out as we move forward. 
Take a measure of me and my heart. If you 
still disagree, so be it. That is democracy. 
That is America. The right to dissent peace-
ably within the guardrails of our Republic is 
perhaps this Nation’s greatest strength; yet 
hear me clearly. Disagreement must not lead 
to disunion, and I pledge this to you: I will 
be a President for all Americans—all Ameri-
cans. 
(Applause.) 
I promise you, I will fight as hard for those 
who did not support me as for those who did. 
(Applause.) 
Many centuries ago, St. Augustine, a saint 
in my church, wrote that a people was a mul-
titude defined by the common action of their 
love, defined by the common objects of their 
love. What are the common objects we, as 
Americans, love that define us as Ameri-
cans? I think we know: opportunity, secu-
rity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and, 
yes, the truth. 
Recent weeks and months have taught us a 
painful lesson. There is truth, and there are 
lies, lies told for power and for profit. Each 
of us has a duty and a responsibility as citi-
zens, as Americans, and especially as lead-
ers—leaders who have pledged to honor our 
Constitution and protect our Nation—to de-
fend the truth and defeat the lies. 
(Applause.) 
Look, I understand that many of my fellow 
Americans view the future with fear and 
trepidation. I understand they worry about 
their jobs. I understand, like my dad, they 
lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, 
wondering: Can I keep my healthcare? Can I 
pay my mortgage? Thinking about their 
families and about what comes next. I prom-
ise you, I get it. 
But the answer is not to turn inward and 
to retreat into competing factions, dis-
trusting those who don’t look like you or 
worship the way you do or don’t get their 
news from the same sources you do. We must 
end this uncivil war that pits red against 
blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus 
liberal. We can do this if we open our souls 
instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a 
little tolerance and humility, and if we are 
willing to stand in the other person’s shoes, 
as my mom would say. Just for a moment, 
stand in their shoes. 
Because here is the thing about life: There 
is no accounting for what fate will deal you. 
Some days, you need a hand. There are other 
days when we are called to lend a hand. That 
is how it has to be. That is what we do for 
one another. If we are this way, our country 
will be stronger, more prosperous, more 
ready for the future, and we can still dis-
agree. 
My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of 
us, we are going to need each other. We need 
all our strength to persevere through this 
dark winter. We are entering what may be 
the toughest and deadliest period of the 
virus. We must set aside politics and finally 
face this pandemic as one Nation—one Na-
tion. 
(Applause.) 
And I promise you this, as the Bible says: 
‘‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy 
cometh in the morning.’’ We will get through 
this together—together. 
(Applause.) 
Look, folks, all my colleagues I serve with 
in the House and the Senate up here, we all 
understand the world is watching, watching 
all of us today. So here is my message to 
those beyond our borders: America has been 
tested, and we have come out stronger for it. 
We will repair our alliances and engage with 
the world once again—not to meet yester-
day’s challenges but today’s and tomorrow’s 
challenges—and we will lead not merely by 
the example of our power but by the power of 
our example. 
(Applause.) 
We will be a strong and trusted partner for 
peace, progress, and security. 
Look, you all know we have been through 
so much in this Nation. In my first act as 
President, I would like to ask you to join me 
in a moment of silent prayer. Remember all 
those who we lost in this past year to the 
pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans— 
moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daugh-
ters, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. We 
will honor them by becoming the people and 
the Nation we know we can and should be. I 
ask you, let’s say a silent prayer for those 
who have lost their lives and those left be-
hind and for our country. 
(Moment of silence.) 
Amen. 
Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an 
attack on our democracy and on truth, a rag-
ing virus, growing inequity, the sting of sys-
temic racism, a climate in crisis, and Amer-
ica’s role in the world. Any one of these 
would be enough to challenge us in profound 
ways, but the fact is we face them all at 
once, presenting this Nation with one of the 
gravest responsibilities we have had. 
Now, we are going to be tested. Are we 
going to step up, all of us? It is time for bold-
ness, for there is so much to do. And this is 
certain: I promise you, we will be judged, 
you and I, by how we resolve these cascading 
crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion 
is the question. Will we master this rare and 
difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations 
and pass along a new and better world to our 
children? 
I believe we must. I am sure you do as well. 
I believe we will. When we do, we will write 
the next great chapter in the history of the 
United States of America—the American 
story—a story that might sound something 
like a song that means a lot to me. It is 
called ‘‘American Anthem.’’ There is one 
verse that stands out, at least for me, and it 
goes like this: 
The work and prayers of centuries have 
brought us to this day, which shall be our 
legacy, what will our children say? Let me 
know in my heart when my days are 
through, America, America, I gave my best 
to you. 
Let us add our own work and prayers to 
the unfolding story of our great Nation. If we 
do this, then when our days are through, our 
children and our children’s children will say 
of us: They gave their best, they did their 
duty, they healed a broken land. 
My fellow Americans, I close today where 
I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and 
all of you, I give you my word. I will always 
level with you. I will defend the Constitu-
tion. I will defend our democracy. I will de-
fend America, and I will give all—all of you— 
keep everything I do in your service, think-
ing not of power but of possibilities, not of 
personal interest but of public good. And to-
gether, we shall write an American story of 
hope, not fear; of unity, not division; of 
light, not darkness; a story of decency and 
dignity, love and healing, greatness and 
goodness—may this be the story that guides 
us, the story that inspires us, and the story 
that tells ages yet to come that we answered 
the call of history. We met the moment. De-
mocracy and hope, truth and justice, did not 
die on our watch but thrived, that America 
secured liberty at home and stood once again 
as a beacon to the world. That is what we 
owe our forbearers, one another, and genera-
tions to follow. 
So, with purpose and resolve, we turn to 
those tasks of our time sustained by faith, 
driven by conviction, and devoted to one an-
other and the country we love with all our 
hearts. May God bless America, and may God 
protect our troops. 
Thank you, America. 
(Applause.)

Mr. BLUNT. It is hard not to be reminded 
of President Obama singing that same song 
at the Mother Emanuel Church, a song that 
in our country is as close to both poetry and 
prayer as you could possibly come, and we 
are going to finish with those two things. 
Let me introduce Amanda Gorman, our 
Nation’s first ever National Youth Poet Lau-
reate.

cans, and the world:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S79 
January 21, 2021 
where can we find light in this never-ending 
shade? 
The loss we carry, 
a sea we must wade 
We’ve braved the belly of the beast 
We’ve learned that quiet isn’t always peace 
And the norms and notions 
of what just is 
Isn’t always just-ice 
And yet the dawn is ours 
before we knew it 
Somehow we do it 
Somehow we’ve weathered and witnessed 
a nation that isn’t broken 
but simply unfinished 
We the successors of a country and a time 
Where a skinny Black girl 
descended from slaves and raised by a single 
mother 
can dream of becoming president 
only to find herself reciting for one 
And yes we are far from polished 
far from pristine 
but that doesn’t mean we are 
striving to form a union that is perfect 
We are striving to forge a union with purpose 
To compose a country committed to all cul-
tures, colors, 
characters and 
conditions of man 
And so we lift our gazes not to what stands 
between us 
but what stands before us 
We close the divide because we know, to put 
our future first, 
we must first put our differences aside 
We lay down our arms 
so we can reach out our arms 
to one another 
We seek harm to none and harmony for all 
Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is 
true: 
That even as we grieved, we grew 
That even as we hurt, we hoped 
That even as we tired, we tried 
That we’ll forever be tied together, vic-
torious 
Not because we will never again know defeat 
but because we will never again sow division 
Scripture tells us to envision 
that everyone shall sit under their own vine 
and fig tree 
And no one shall make them afraid 
If we’re to live up to our own time 
Then victory won’t lie in the blade 
But in all the bridges we’ve made 
That is the promise to glade 
The hill we climb 
If only we dare 
It’s because being American is more than a 
pride we inherit, 
it’s the past we step into and how we repair 
it 
We’ve seen a force that would shatter our na-
tion 
rather than share it 
Would destroy our country if it meant delay-
ing democracy 
And this effort very nearly succeeded 
But while democracy can be periodically de-
layed 
it can never be permanently defeated 
In this truth 
in this faith we trust 
For while we have our eyes on the future 
history has its eyes on us 
This is the era of just redemption 
We feared at its inception 
We did not feel prepared to be the heirs 
of such a terrifying hour 
but within it we found the power to author a 
new chapter 
To offer hope and laughter to ourselves 
So while once we asked, 
how could we possibly prevail over catas-
trophe? 
Now we assert 
How could catastrophe possibly 
prevail over us? 
We will not march back to what was 
but move to what shall be 
A country that is bruised but whole, 
benevolent but bold, 
fierce and free 
We will not be turned around 
or interrupted by intimidation 
because we know our inaction and inertia 
will be the inheritance of the next genera-
tion 
Our blunders become their burdens 
But one thing is certain: 
If we merge mercy with might, 
and might with right, 
then love becomes our legacy 
and change our children’s birthright 
So let us leave behind a country 
better than the one we were left with 
Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, 
we will raise this wounded world into a won-
drous one 
We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the 
west, 
we will rise from the windswept northeast 
where our forefathers first realized revolu-
tion 
We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of 
the midwestern states, 
we will rise from the sunbaked south 
We will rebuild, reconcile and recover 
and every known nook of our nation and 
every corner called our country, 
our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, 
battered and beautiful 
When day comes we step out of the shade, 
aflame and unafraid 
The new dawn blooms as we free it 
For there is always light, 
if only we’re brave enough to see it 
If only we’re brave enough to be it. 
(Applause.) 
Mr. BLUNT. Thank you, Amanda Gorman. 
Now, for our benediction, I am pleased to 
introduce 
the 
Reverend 
Dr. 
Silvester 
Beaman, pastor of the Bethel African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church in Wilmington, DE, a 
friend of President Biden for 30 years. 
Reverend BEAMAN. As a nation and people 
of faith gathered in this historical moment, 
let us unite in prayer. 
God, we gather under the beauty of Your 
holiness and the holiness of Your beauty. We 
seek Your face, Your smile, Your warm em-
brace. 
We petition You once more in this celebra-
tion. We pray for divine favor upon our 
President, Joseph R. Biden, and our First 
Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, and their family. We 
further ask that You would extend the same 
favor upon our Vice President, Kamala D. 
Harris, and our Second Gentleman, Doug 
Emhoff, and their family. More than ever— 
more than ever—they and our Nation need 
You. 
We need You, for in You we discover our 
common humanity. In our common human-
ity, we will seek out the wounded and bind 
their wounds. We will seek healing for those 
who are sick and diseased. We will mourn 
our dead. We will befriend the lonely, the 
least, and the left out. We will share our 
abundance with those who are hungry. We 
will do justly to the oppressed, acknowledge 
sin, and seek forgiveness, thus grasping rec-
onciliation. 
In discovering our humanity, we will seek 
the good in and for all our neighbors. We will 
love the unlovable, remove the stigma of the 
so-called untouchables. We will care for our 
most vulnerable, our children, the elderly, 
emotionally challenged, and the poor. We 
will seek rehabilitation beyond correction. 
We will extend opportunity to those locked 
out of opportunity. We will make friends of 
our enemies. We will make friends of our en-
emies. 
People—Your people—shall no longer raise 
up weapons against one another, who will 
rather use our resources for the national 
good, and become a beacon of life and good 
will to the world, and neither shall we learn 
hatred anymore. We will lie down in peace 
and not make our neighbors afraid. 
In You, oh, God, we discover our humanity, 
and in our humanity, we discover our com-
monness. Beyond the difference of color, 
creed, origin, political party, ideology, geog-
raphy, and personal preferences, we will be-
come greater stewards of Your environment, 
preserving the land, reaping from it a sus-
tainable harvest, and securing its wonder 
and miracle-giving power for generations to 
come. 
This is our benediction, that from these 
hallowed grounds where slaves labored to 
build this shrine and citadel to liberty and 
democracy, let us all acknowledge—from the 
indigenous Native Americans to those who 
recently received their citizenship, from the 
African American to those whose foreparents 
came from Europe and every corner of the 
globe, from the wealthy to those struggling 
to make it, from every human being, regard-
less of their choices—that this is our coun-
try. 
As such, teach us, oh, God. As such, teach 
us, oh, God, to live in it, love in it, be healed 
in it, and reconcile to one another in it, less 
we miss kingdom’s goal. 
To Your glory, majesty, dominion, and 
power forever, hallelujah. Glory hallelujah, 
in the strong Name of our collective faith. 
Amen.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
this 117th Congress, the American peo-
ple chose an evenly split Senate—50 
Republicans and 50 Democrats. With 
the election of Vice President HARRIS, 
that means the Democratic leader will 
act as majority leader. 
So I want to congratulate my col-
league from New York. His pride and 
emotion were palpable yesterday as 
this self-described ‘‘kid from Brooklyn 
[and] son of an exterminator and a 
housewife’’ became the first Jewish 
Member of Congress to lead either 
Chamber—a historic milestone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S80 
January 21, 2021 
Now, the Senate has handled an even 
split before. Twenty years ago, faced 
with the same scenario, the two leaders 
brokered a power-sharing agreement so 
the institution could function smooth-
ly. 
The Democratic leader and I are dis-
cussing a similar agreement now. I 
have been heartened to hear my col-
league say he wants the same rules 
from the 2000s to apply today, because, 
certainly, 20 years ago there was no 
talk—none 
whatsoever—of 
tearing 
down longstanding minority rights on 
legislation. 
The legislative filibuster is a crucial 
part of the Senate. Leading Democrats, 
like President Biden himself, have long 
defended it. Democrats themselves just 
spent 6 years using it, literally, to 
block bills from Senator TIM SCOTT’s 
police reform to coronavirus relief. 
And less than 4 years ago, when it 
was Republicans who held the Senate, 
the House, and the Presidency, 27 cur-
rent Democrats plus Vice President 
HARRIS signed a letter insisting this 
longstanding rule should not be bro-
ken. 
So if the talk of unity and common 
ground is to have meaning and, cer-
tainly, if the rules from 20 years ago 
are to be our guide, then I cannot 
imagine the Democratic leader would 
rather 
hold 
up 
the 
power-sharing 
agreement than simply reaffirm that 
his side won’t be breaking this stand-
ing rule of the Senate. 
I appreciate our ongoing, good-faith 
discussions and look forward to finding 
the solution together. 
Our side takes a great deal of pride in 
the accomplishments that three con-
secutive Republican Senates have de-
livered for the American people. 
In 2014, our majority was elected to 
check and balance the last years of a 
lameduck Presidency. 
In 2016, we were reelected to help ig-
nite a real, all-American economic 
comeback, rebuild and modernize our 
military, and fight for the forgotten 
corners of our country. Together with 
the Trump administration and a Re-
publican House, we did just that. 
In 2018, we were rehired again on 
those strong results, especially the his-
toric job market for American workers 
and our commitment to the judiciary. 
And now, even as voters chose Presi-
dent Biden for the White House, they 
simultaneously 
shrunk 
Democrats’ 
House majority and elected this evenly 
divided Senate. 
The 2020 election was as far from a 
sweeping 
mandate 
for 
ideological 
transformation as any election we have 
seen in modern history. The American 
people stunned the so-called experts 
with the number of Republicans they 
sent to the House and to the Senate to 
make sure commonsense conservative 
values have a powerful say in the gov-
ernment. 
So our side is ready to share ideas 
and work with the Biden administra-
tion, applying common sense to find 
common ground for the common good. 
But if and when our Democratic friends 
depart from common sense, when they 
retreat from common ground or their 
proposals harm the common good, then 
we will use the power the American 
people have given us to push for what 
we think is right. 
On the Biden administration’s very 
first day, it took several big steps in 
the wrong direction. The President re-
entered the failed Paris climate agree-
ment, a terrible bargain that would set 
us up to self-inflict major economic 
pain on working American families 
with no assurance that China or Russia 
would honor their commitments. In 
fact, the United States has already 
been reducing carbon emissions, while 
China and other nations in the agree-
ment have kept increasing theirs. Re-
joining will just set us up to kill Amer-
ican jobs while our competitors con-
tinue to roar on by. 
The President also unilaterally can-
celed the Keystone XL Pipeline. The 
day-one priority was to kill thousands 
of American jobs, including union jobs, 
disappoint our strong ally Canada, and 
reverse some of our progress toward en-
ergy security. This is a project that the 
liberal 
Canadian 
Government 
and 
Prime Minister Trudeau support—an 
investment in North American energy. 
Even the Obama State Department 
concluded it would not harm the cli-
mate. But because canceling the pipe-
line project just feels like the green 
thing to do, the new administration 
killed all these jobs. This was not the 
day one the American workers de-
served. 
The new administration has also 
sketched out a massive proposal for 
blanket amnesty that would gut en-
forcement of American laws while cre-
ating huge new incentives for people to 
rush here illegally at the same time. 
This kind of failed approach will invite 
another humanitarian crisis on our 
border and privilege powerful interests 
ahead of American workers. 
For all the talk about norms within 
government, last night brought a truly 
unprecedented move at the National 
Labor Relations Board. The President 
fired the Board’s independent general 
counsel almost a year before the end of 
his term. Even leftwing activists called 
the unprecedented move ‘‘aggressive.’’ 
Now, it is still early. There is still 
plenty of time for President Biden to 
remember that he does not owe his 
election to the far left. The President 
can and should refocus his administra-
tion on creating good-paying American 
jobs, not sacrificing our people’s liveli-
hoods to liberal symbolism. Senate Re-
publicans will be ready, willing, and 
eager to help make that happen.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
happy to be standing here today on the 
Senate floor during an exciting week 
and one that really provides us with 
hope for the future. I welcome Presi-
dent Biden and, of course, Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS to their new roles and 
look forward to their leadership that 
they will provide in these difficult 
times. 
We can never forget that America is 
still in the midst of a deadly pandemic. 
Tragically, we lost over 400,000 Ameri-
cans. In my State of Illinois, we have 
seen more than 1 million COVID cases, 
and 18,398 of my neighbors and friends 
in Illinois have died due to this deadly 
virus. 
As we continue to try to stop the 
spread of this pandemic, I am glad that 
the vaccine rollout has been able to 
help some in my State—537,000 people 
in Illinois have received vaccines. It is 
a refreshing and long overdue sight to 
have the President and White House 
fully engaged in addressing this pan-
demic with a focus on science and ra-
cial equity. 
On his first day yesterday, President 
Biden signed several important Execu-
tive actions, including instituting a 
mask mandate for all Federal facilities 
and buildings. 
Secondly, he moved to rejoin the 
World Health Organization. This was 
one of the most confounding decisions 
by the Trump administration. In the 
midst of a global pandemic, President 
Trump opted to remove the United 
States from the World Health Organi-
zation, which was focusing on the 
spread of this pandemic and its impact 
on nations around the world. 
Finally, President Biden created an 
office to coordinate a national response 
to the pandemic. Today he is outlining 
a strong plan to provide a national 
strategy to liberate us from this 
threat. 
I must say that I was disappointed in 
the transition when at first President 
Trump refused to acknowledge that he 
lost the election, and then his Agencies 
dragged their feet when it came to in-
forming the Biden administration of 
the status quo in America. Thus,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S81 
January 21, 2021 
today, we learn that we were not as 
prepared as we should have been when 
it came to distributing the vaccines 
that were being manufactured across 
this country. Now we almost have to 
start from zero to find a way to meet 
President Biden’s challenge of 100 mil-
lion Americans vaccinated in the first 
100 days that he is in office. I pray that 
he is successful. We should do every-
thing in our power on both sides of the 
aisle to give him the resources and the 
cooperation he needs. 
The fact sheet of things that will be 
done by the Biden administration on 
COVID–19 is lengthy and impressive. 
The President, on the first day, estab-
lished a White House COVID–19 Re-
sponse Office and Coordinator, as I 
mentioned, required mask wearing and 
social distancing in Federal facilities, 
and rejoined the World Health Organi-
zation. 
Today, President Biden also unveiled 
a national strategy to leverage Federal 
resources. It outlines detailed plans for 
a comprehensive vaccination strategy. 
If there was cheering—and there should 
have been—for the Warp Speed project 
developing successful vaccines in a 
short period of time, it was followed by 
some disappointment that even with 
these vaccines and the knowledge of 
how to make them, we are not pro-
ducing them in the quantities nec-
essary, and we are not addressing the 
logistics of spreading these vaccines 
across America where they are needed 
the most. 
The President is setting out to re-
store trust by leading with experts for 
public outreach, and he is relying on 
science. That is refreshing. It is hard to 
imagine something that basic is as re-
freshing as it is. He is providing re-
sources and guidance to reopen most 
K–8 schools in 100 days. Wouldn’t that 
be a blessing? There isn’t a parent or 
grandparent in this country who won’t 
cheer that particular goal. He is ad-
dressing supply gaps and State capac-
ity. We are finding them virtually all 
across the United States. And he is fo-
cusing on vulnerable populations, in-
cluding those in long-term care facili-
ties and communities of color. 
To implement this plan, President 
Biden will sign Executive orders today 
to direct agencies to exercise all au-
thorities, including the Defense Pro-
duction Act, to accelerate the manu-
facturing and delivery of vaccination, 
testing, and medical supplies. Let me 
say, I have never understood why 
President Trump refused to use this 
Defense Production Act to its full ca-
pacity, to use his leadership as Presi-
dent to marshal the resources of pro-
duction and distribution of vaccines 
and other absolutely necessary medical 
devices. 
President Biden also is directing 
FEMA to increase Federal reimburse-
ment to States from 75 to 100 percent 
for emergency supplies, such as PPE, 
and National Guard personnel. He is es-
tablishing 
a 
Healthy Equity Task 
Force to provide recommendations on 
how to allocate and address racial and 
ethnic disparities that have been mag-
nified by this crisis. 
We know the economic damage of 
this virus continues to linger. Nearly 
one in four people in my State in 
renter households reports being behind 
on rent, and one in three households 
reports having difficulty just covering 
usual household expenses. 
We continue to see historic numbers 
of Americans filing for unemployment, 
including more than 100,000 people in 
Illinois who applied for unemployment 
last week. But to fully address the 
health and economic toll of the pan-
demic, Congress needs to build upon 
the work we did in December and heed 
the call of the $1.9 trillion plan that 
President Biden outlined last week. 
I was part of a bipartisan group of 
Senators who met several months ago. 
We talked about following on the 
CARES Act with some measure of 
COVID relief. We proposed a plan of 
$908 billion, which was then embraced 
by the leaders on both sides of the aisle 
and the White House, and they nego-
tiated further. That resulted in the 
measure we passed just a few days ago. 
But make no mistake, that was not the 
end of the story, nor did we envision 
that it would be. This was done on a 
temporary emergency basis to cover 
the first quarter; that is, the first 3 
months of this calendar year. I pray 
that this pandemic and all of the prob-
lems it has caused will soon be gone, 
but I doubt that it will happen in the 
next 3 months. 
We have more work to do, and Presi-
dent Biden knows it. I think we all do. 
We need to come together again on a 
bipartisan basis. 
The first CARES Act passed the Sen-
ate by a vote of 96 to nothing. There 
were no dissenting votes. The second 
measure, I believe, had 91 or 92 votes in 
favor of it. So we have shown real bi-
partisanship. We can’t quit on this 
challenge. 
Janet Yellen has been named as the 
Treasure Secretary designate by Presi-
dent Biden. I had a conversation with 
her 2 weeks ago. We talked about the 
perilous state of the economy. It is 
naive for us to believe that the worst is 
behind us. We have to face the reality 
that we may have darker days ahead, 
and we have to be prepared to deal with 
them—first, with the pandemic and, 
second, with the economy. Even the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve has 
encouraged us not to take our foot off 
the accelerator, lest we lapse into a re-
cession or worse. 
Let’s take this seriously. Let’s help 
the businesses, help the workers, help 
the families, and do our best to get this 
economy back on its feet. 
Illinois has spent $843 million in our 
health departments to expand testing 
and vaccine delivery from the Decem-
ber package. But with half a million 
people vaccinated so far in a State of 13 
million, more resources and support 
are needed. That means providing the 
$20 billion for vaccine distribution and 
$50 billion for testing that President 
Biden has asked for as part of his res-
cue package so we can finally, once and 
for all, crush this virus, get the econ-
omy back on its feet, and get our kids 
back in school. 
It also means investing in the health 
workforce, such as through a bill I 
have introduced with Senator MARCO 
RUBIO, Republican of Florida, to pro-
vide scholarship and loan repayment 
through the National Health Service 
Corps for doctors and nurses to serve in 
communities with a shortage of pro-
viders. 
I say to the Presiding Officer, I am 
sure you are personally aware that 
there are fewer African-American doc-
tors in the United States today than 
there were 10 years ago. I am sorry to 
report that. It should be just the oppo-
site. We should have so many more, for 
many reasons, not the least of which is 
to overcome health inequity. 
This scholarship program that Sen-
ator RUBIO and I are proposing builds 
on the model of the National Health 
Service Corp, which tracks young doc-
tors to come and serve in underserved 
areas and to help underserved popu-
lations, and then helps pay off their 
student loans. We take this approach: 
Keep that; it is good. Expand it where 
we can, but let’s look at another as-
pect. What if we provided scholarship 
assistance and really directed it toward 
minority candidates to become doctors 
and dentists and nurses and healthcare 
professionals? All of those aspects 
would be encouraged if people knew 
that they had a scholarship through 
the National Health Service and the 
promise that they would serve where 
they were needed after they graduated. 
We hope this will be included in any 
measure that is passed in the near fu-
ture. 
The President’s plan sets out addi-
tional relief measures that will float to 
those in need. I am especially encour-
aged by making the child tax credit 
fully refundable. That is going to ben-
efit 1 million kids in my State. 
Also, the Biden plan aims to safely 
open schools, businesses, and travel 
while protecting workers in these areas 
and committing to protecting our most 
vulnerable populations. 
I am ready to continue pushing for 
COVID relief. The job isn’t finished by 
any means. We must provide American 
families and workers the tools they 
need to survive in this difficult eco-
nomic time. 
As Chair Yellen said earlier this 
week, ‘‘Without further action, we risk 
a longer, more painful recession now— 
and long-term scarring of the economy 
later.’’ 
Let’s do this, America. Let’s do it to-
gether. Let’s let the spirit of unity 
that we saw on the West Front of the 
Capitol yesterday bring us together 
here in the Senate and the House in a 
joint effort to help the American peo-
ple with the resources they need to sur-
vive this pandemic and this lengthy fi-
nancial hardship.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to 
start 
by 
congratulating 
President 
Biden and Vice President HARRIS, who 
took office yesterday. We have a team 
of former Senators in the White House. 
Yesterday was a hopeful day. The 
Capitol Building, so recently besieged 
by violence and lawlessness, resumed 
its rightful place as the seat of our de-
mocracy and backdrop for the peaceful 
transfer of power from one President to 
the next that is a hallmark of our sys-
tem of government. The faith of many 
Americans has been shaken in recent 
weeks. But yesterday reminded us that 
our democracy still stands and our Na-
tion endures—bruised, maybe, but un-
broken. 
I also want to express my profound 
gratitude to the Capitol Police officers 
and 
other 
law 
enforcement 
who, 
though outnumbered and overrun, de-
fended this Capitol on January 6, and 
to the soldiers and the law enforcement 
who have guarded this building in the 
days since. We live in peace and free-
dom because of the service and sac-
rifice of our military and our police of-
ficers. 
After 
the 
election 
of 
November, 
President Biden gave a victory speech 
in which he pledged to be ‘‘a President 
who seeks not to divide, but to unify. 
Who doesn’t see Red and Blue states, 
but a United States. And who will work 
with all my heart to win the confidence 
of the whole people.’’ 
He reiterated that commitment in 
yesterday’s speech, stating: ‘‘On this 
January day, my whole soul is in this: 
Bringing America together, uniting our 
people, uniting our nation.’’ 
That is what we need right now—a 
President who will unite us. If Presi-
dent Biden can truly be a President 
who governs for all Americans, who re-
spects all Americans, and who works to 
win the confidence of the whole people, 
he will have done our Nation a great 
service. 
And I do think President Biden is ca-
pable of doing this, but I do want to 
sound a cautionary note. It is common 
to talk about unity at Presidential in-
augurations. But all too often that 
commitment to unity is forgotten—by 
the President or by the members of his 
party. I hope this commitment will be 
backed up with action and that Demo-
crat leaders in Congress will embrace 
the President’s words. That means re-
specting those Americans who didn’t 
vote for President Biden as well as 
those who did. 
It means working together to con-
front our Nation’s challenges, instead 
of adopting an ‘‘our way or the high-
way’’ approach. It means preserving 
minority rights in the Senate when it 
comes to legislation, the heart—the 
heart—of what makes the Senate spe-
cial and something Republicans, I 
might add, defended during our time in 
the majority. 
For the President, it means nomi-
nating individuals who represent a ma-
jority of Americans, not the far left 
fringes of his party. I have seen some 
hopeful actions from President Biden. 
Several of his nominees for important 
posts, while perhaps not those whom I 
would have chosen, are public servants 
whom I believe will serve our country 
well in positions like Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, whom we voted on 
yesterday. And the President has dem-
onstrated both his leadership and his 
concern 
for 
all 
Americans 
by 
prioritizing the pandemic and focusing 
on getting Americans vaccinated. 
But there have been troubling things 
as well. While the President has nomi-
nated some mainstream candidates, 
other nominations raise serious con-
cerns on issues like overregulation of 
the economy and life and conscience 
protections. 
While I applaud the President’s focus 
on the pandemic, I am concerned that 
a number of the measures in his pan-
demic relief proposal are heavily par-
tisan—and, certainly, not things that 
should be rushed through Congress 
without serious consideration of the 
long-term impact they would have on 
our economy and American families. 
If there was any mandate given in 
this election, it was a mandate for 
moderation. 
A 
historic 
number 
of 
Americans voted for President Biden, 
but a historic number voted for Presi-
dent Trump as well. Democrats lost 
seats in the House of Representatives, 
and the Senate is evenly divided. 
I hope—I really hope—that Democrat 
leaders and the President will remem-
ber that and not allow the far left, 
which has sought to hijack the Demo-
cratic Party in recent years, to deter-
mine their agenda. We have a chance— 
a chance—for a new day here in this 
country, and I believe that President 
Biden is committed to leading us there. 
I pray that that commitment will en-
dure and that we can spend the next 
months and years working together, 
legislating together, and ensuring the 
voices of all Americans are respected 
and heard. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
there have been few other times in 
American history when the need for 
economic growth through strategic, re-
sponsible, 
pro-business 
policies 
has 
been as great as it is today. Nothing is 
more important to a family than a 
good-paying job. That is where the 
American dream begins. 
Today, as our Nation fights to over-
come the horrendous health and eco-
nomic impacts of COVID–19, we must 
balance our approach. We have to pro-
tect American families and individuals 
who have been hurt by this crisis, sup-
port commonsense public health poli-
cies and an aggressive vaccine distribu-
tion effort, while also keeping busi-
nesses 
open, 
incentivizing 
future 
growth of businesses, large and small, 
and standing up to our economic adver-
saries, like Communist China, by re-
shoring our supply chain back home. 
We also need to continue cutting reg-
ulations to make it easier for busi-
nesses to operate and for entrepreneurs 
to create jobs. 
President Biden and his Cabinet have 
the important task of revitalizing our 
economy amid one of our Nation’s 
worst economic crises. In my 8 years as 
Governor of Florida, we balanced our 
budget each year, cut $10 billion in 
taxes, paid off one-third of our State 
debt, and Florida companies added 
nearly 1.7 million jobs. But instead of 
looking to innovation and approving 
policies of States like Florida that will 
create jobs and help Americans and 
small businesses, the Biden administra-
tions is already making promises to go 
in the opposite direction—promises 
that are being championed by his 
nominee for Treasury Secretary, Janet 
Yellen. 
Let me be clear. I support targeted 
relief to help our small businesses and 
individuals who are hurting because of 
the coronavirus. With the start of a 
new administration, I was hoping to 
hear some fresh, new ideas on how to 
accomplish our shared goal of address-
ing this crisis. But that is not what we 
are hearing from the Biden administra-
tion. Their answer is the same as it al-
ways has been for Democrats: more 
government, more spending, higher 
taxes, no accountability. 
Voters are befuddled by the claim 
that while families cannot borrow 
without limits or consequences, some-
how the Federal Government can. It is 
irresponsible, and I won’t stand for it. 
We have to get serious about how we 
are spending taxpayer dollars. We al-
ready have more than $27 trillion in 
Federal debt. 
If interest rates return to their 50- 
year average, the interest on our Fed-
eral debt will make it impossible to 
fund our military, Medicare, and Social 
Security. 
President Biden wants to spend more 
than $350 billion to bail out wasteful, 
liberal States for their decades of mis-
management, and his nominees, includ-
ing Ms. Yellen, support this nonsense. 
Andrew Cuomo has threatened the 
New York wealthy that if they don’t 
help him get a Federal Government 
bailout, he will raise their taxes. 
I was elected Governor of Florida 
when Cuomo was elected Governor of 
New York. While Governor of Florida, I 
lowered taxes each year. Cuomo raised

taxes. Since we were both elected, fam-
ilies and businesses have increasingly 
left New York for lower taxes, better 
schools, better roads, and warmer 
weather in Florida. 
Asking taxpayers to bail out failed 
politicians in liberal States like New 
York and Illinois and save them from 
their own bad decisions isn’t fair to the 
taxpayers in fiscally responsible States 
like Florida. After all, many Florida 
taxpayers left New York because of 
Cuomo’s tax policy. 
It makes no sense. Congress has al-
ready allocated more than $4.5 trillion 
to address this crisis. Think about it. 
We just passed a nearly $1 trillion re-
lief package 4 weeks ago. This is all 
borrowed money. The Federal Govern-
ment doesn’t have savings for a rainy 
day, and we still don’t know how much 
money is unspent from the previous 
coronavirus relief packages. How can 
we possibly justify spending more 
money right now? We don’t even know 
what we might need to spend money 
on. 
And for States like California, we 
know they don’t need it. California’s 
tax revenues for this fiscal year is run-
ning $9 billion, or 18 percent, above 
projections. Personal income tax rev-
enue in October was $1 billion—15 per-
cent higher than in the previous Octo-
ber, and sales taxes were up 9.2 percent. 
For the last 4 months, overall revenue 
in California has exceeded spring fore-
casts and even 2019 collections. But 
that hasn’t kept Governor Newsom and 
his far left buddies in Congress from 
keeping their hands out for more 
money. 
We cannot simply throw massive 
spending at this with no accountability 
to the current and future American 
taxpayer. It is shameful. 
We have also heard the Biden admin-
istration and its nominees call for a 
new national minimum wage of $15 an 
hour. It is clear that these folks 
haven’t talked to business owners. 
Small businesses in America are strug-
gling like never before, especially in 
liberal 
States, 
where 
repeated 
lockdowns have exacerbated their work 
to stay open. And President Biden be-
lieves now is the time to slap another 
mandate on their back and drive even 
more Americans chasing the dream of 
this country out of business? I am not 
sure how you could possibly be more 
detached from reality. 
According to the Congressional Budg-
et Office, a federally mandated $15 min-
imum wage would cost as many as 3.7 
million Americans their jobs. 
Let me tell you, I know what it is 
like to be poor, to live in public hous-
ing, to not have enough money to af-
ford healthcare for a family member. I 
watched my parents struggle for work. 
I don’t want any family to go through 
what I went through. 
I ran for office because I wanted to 
help struggling families like the one I 
grew up in to have the chance to live 
the American dream. So when I hear 
folks like Ms. Yellen say that job loss 
from a minimum-wage mandate is 
‘‘very minimal, if anything,’’ it really 
leaves me at a loss. Watching 3.7 mil-
lion Americans lose their jobs will not 
be minimal. 
Adding insult to injury, we have 
heard great praise for the implementa-
tion of a carbon tax. Let’s remember, 
this was part of the Green New Deal, 
which would be a disaster if passed. Ac-
cording to estimates from the Heritage 
Foundation, a carbon emissions tax 
would cost the country 1.4 million jobs 
while decreasing our GDP by $3.9 tril-
lion and reducing income for a family 
of four by $40,000, with dispropor-
tionate costs falling on low-income 
families. Again, how can this be seen as 
the logical step when so many in our 
Nation are simply trying to recover 
and rebuild from the devastation of the 
COVID–19 pandemic? 
If the administration has its way, 
Americans should prepare for higher 
taxes, less income, less opportunity, 
and more government mandates. 
Ms. Yellen seems to think the solu-
tion to America’s economic woes is 
more government, more taxes, more 
regulation, not more individual oppor-
tunity. That is wrong and will only 
send us further into debt and our fami-
lies further into despair. 
Based on what I have heard, I am 
concerned and, frankly, disturbed by 
what is being offered as the future of 
America’s economic policy. When I ran 
for the Senate, I did so to fix Washing-
ton’s broken way of doing things. We 
have to address Washington’s uncon-
scionable need to waste tax dollars on 
things that don’t actually help or even 
hurt 
American 
families, 
especially 
working families and those on fixed in-
comes. I will never give up this fight. 
In 2018, Ms. Yellen was quoted speak-
ing about the unsustainable U.S. debt 
and said: ‘‘If I had a magic wand, I 
would raise taxes.’’ We know that is 
not the real answer to solving our debt 
issue. It is simply the lazy, liberal ap-
proach. 
It is time to get value out of every 
dollar we spend and make hard choices 
that actually help families and ensure 
a strong economic future for our Na-
tion. 
I cannot support the nomination of a 
candidate who proudly promotes Joe 
Biden’s policies to mortgage our kids’ 
and grandkids’ futures with irrespon-
sible and shortsighted tax spending. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. WAR-
REN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
there is a lot going on in the Senate, a 
lot of activity behind the scenes right 
now. Leadership of both parties is ne-
gotiating a 50–50 power-sharing agree-
ment, which is very important for the 
Senate and very important for our Na-
tion. 
One issue that is being discussed is 
the status of what is going to happen, 
possibly—hopefully, nothing is going to 
happen—with a really important ele-
ment of the U.S. Senate: the legislative 
filibuster—something that has been a 
hallmark of this body almost since the 
founding 
of 
the 
Republic. 
This 
shouldn’t be a hard issue. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD a letter, led by 
Senator COLLINS and Senator COONS, 
dated April 7, 2017, to the then-major-
ity leader, Senator MCCONNELL, and 
the Democratic leader, Senator SCHU-
MER. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, April 7, 2017. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Democratic Leader, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
AND 
DEMOCRATIC LEADER SCHUMER: We are writ-
ing to urge you to support our efforts to pre-
serve existing rules, practices, and traditions 
as they pertain to the right of Members to 
engage in extended debate on legislation be-
fore the United States Senate. Senators have 
expressed a variety of opinions about the ap-
propriateness of limiting debate when we are 
considering judicial and executive branch 
nominations. Regardless of our past dis-
agreements on that issue, we are united in 
our determination to preserve the ability of 
Members to engage in extended debate when 
bills are on the Senate floor. 
We are mindful of the unique role the Sen-
ate plays in the legislative process, and we 
are steadfastly committed to ensuring that 
this great American institution continues to 
serve as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Therefore, we are asking you to join us 
in opposing any effort to curtail the existing 
rights and prerogatives of Senators to en-
gage in full, robust, and extended debate as 
we consider legislation before this body in 
the future. 
Sincerely, 
Susan M. Collins, Orrin Hatch, Claire 
McCaskill, Lisa Murkowski, Christopher A. 
Coons, Joe Manchin, III, John McCain, Pat-
rick J. Leahy, Roger F. Wicker, Luther 
Strange, Angus S. King, Jr., Michael F. Ben-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S84 
January 21, 2021 
Sasse, Todd Young, Kamala D. Harris, Bill 
Nelson, Johnny Isakson, Edward J. Markey, 
Mike Lee, Debbie Stabenow, Sheldon White-
house, Robert Menendez, Tim Kaine. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Over 60 Senators in 
the U.S. Senate—the majority of Re-
publicans and the majority of Demo-
crats—sent this letter to who was then 
leadership of the Senate, writing, in es-
sence: Don’t change the legislative fili-
buster. 
A bunch of Democrats and a bunch of 
Republicans—I was going to read the 
names, but they know who they are— 
the majority on both sides in this body, 
from both parties, in 2017 said: Don’t 
change it. This shouldn’t be something 
the U.S. Senate changes. 
Part of the reason this was going on 
was that, at the time, then-President 
Trump was pressing Senators, particu-
larly Majority Leader MCCONNELL, to 
change the filibuster. The filibuster re-
quires 60 votes to move legislation in 
the Senate. It requires compromise. It 
requires bipartisanship. It is what 
makes us different from the House. At 
the time, then-Republican President 
Trump was saying: Change it. I want 
legislation to move more quickly. 
The Republicans and then-Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL said that it was not 
a good idea. As a matter of fact, most 
of us said that it was not a good idea, 
so we didn’t do anything. We didn’t 
change it because we didn’t want to 
change the nature of the U.S. Senate. 
This is one of the issues being dis-
cussed right now, but it shouldn’t be a 
difficult issue because, as I said, the 
vast majority of Senators in this body, 
a couple of years ago, said: Don’t do it. 
We don’t want the Senate to just be-
come a smaller version of the House, 
because that is what would happen if 
you were to get rid of the legislative 
filibuster. 
I do want to extend my congratula-
tions to the new majority leader as of 
yesterday, Senator SCHUMER, but to 
the new majority leader: This should 
not be a difficult issue. This should not 
be something that we are having a 
problem with in terms of the negotia-
tions between the Democrats and the 
Republicans that delays the power- 
sharing agreement. This should be a 
piece of cake. Just a couple of years 
ago, the vast majority of Democrats 
and Republicans said: Don’t change the 
legislative filibuster. We want to make 
sure that remains the case. 
I think, for the new majority leader, 
this would be an act of statesmanship, 
an act of compromise, and would cer-
tainly make the statement that he is 
going to keep the Senate the same as it 
has been for decades, for centuries. 
Changing 
the 
legislative 
filibuster 
would change the entire structure, his-
tory, and precedent of this very impor-
tant 
body 
in 
our 
country, 
so 
it 
shouldn’t be hard. The vast majority of 
the Democrats and Republicans has al-
ready agreed to this. 
To our new majority leader: Do what 
you know is right—an act of states-
manship and compromise. We have all 
been talking about it. It should not be 
a difficult decision, particularly given 
that so many Senators on both sides of 
the aisle feel strongly enough to have 
written Senator SCHUMER and Senator 
MCCONNELL just a couple of years ago 
on this. 
To all of my colleagues who signed 
that letter—you know who you are— 
make sure you are pressing the new 
majority leader to stick to what you 
pressed him on just a couple of years 
ago. It is important. 
f 
NOMINATION OF LLOYD JAMES 
AUSTIN 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
also want to talk about another impor-
tant issue, and that is President 
Biden’s nomination for the very impor-
tant job of Secretary of Defense, Mr. 
Lloyd Austin. We are going to be vot-
ing on his nomination here on the Sen-
ate floor in a couple of hours. 
I had the honor of introducing Mr. 
Austin just 2 days ago at his confirma-
tion hearing, and I thought the con-
firmation hearing went well. So I want 
to talk a little bit about Mr. Austin be-
fore we take what will essentially be 
two important votes for his confirma-
tion. 
Now, the last time I was actually on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, our Cap-
itol was under siege, and from a foreign 
policy and national security perspec-
tive, America’s authoritarian rivals 
have been gloating over what happened 
on that day. They have been reveling 
in our disunity. Democracy brings 
chaos, they tell their people. It is bet-
ter to have a strong hand that keeps 
order. Well, as you know, we do live in 
an imperfect democracy, no doubt, and 
the American I was honored to intro-
duce at the Armed Services hearing the 
other day, Mr. Lloyd Austin, under-
stands our imperfections more than 
many. 
Yet, on closer inspection, the world’s 
dictators have little to celebrate. Con-
gress went back to work on January 6, 
right here on the Senate floor, to count 
electoral votes, and yesterday there 
was a peaceful transfer of power at the 
top of our government, as there has 
been since our Republic’s founding. 
At some point—maybe sooner than 
we think—Chinese and Russian citizens 
are going to ask: Hey, why can’t we do 
that? Why don’t we have strong, resil-
ient institutions that ensure the reg-
ular elections of new leaders and that 
invest in self-government and the peo-
ple? 
When these citizens ask these ques-
tions of authoritarians like Putin or Xi 
Jinping, they are not going to be gloat-
ing anymore because they won’t have 
answers to these questions. 
So what does this all have to do with 
Mr. Lloyd Austin? A lot. Mr. Austin 
has been nominated to lead one of 
America’s most trusted institutions— 
the Department of Defense. Many of us 
have worked hard over the last few 
years to rebuild our military’s strength 
and readiness, but I think we can all 
agree that there has been too much 
turmoil at the top at the Pentagon. As 
its civilian leader, I am confident that 
Mr. Austin will bring steadiness, lead-
ership, and respect to this indispen-
sable American institution. 
I got to know Mr. Austin in 2005 and 
2006 while serving together in an Army- 
heavy combatant command as we con-
ducted combat operations throughout 
the Middle East. We had what might be 
referred to today as an unequal power 
relationship. He was a two-star gen-
eral. I was a major. He had spent years 
on Active Duty. I was a reservist. He 
was a soldier. I was a marine. I was just 
one of hundreds of field-grade infantry 
officers who had been recalled to Ac-
tive Duty and deployed in the region 
during a challenging time for our Na-
tion. Yet, when I asked for his time, 
Mr. Austin gave it. When I had a prob-
lem, he listened. When I asked for help 
on an important mission, he provided 
it. 
A critical hallmark of exceptional 
leadership, especially for organizations 
like the Pentagon, is not just how one 
treats superiors but how one treats 
subordinates, those down the chain of 
command. What I saw was respect and 
integrity and someone who knew how 
to get things done in a difficult envi-
ronment. 
It is clear to me the core principles of 
Mr. Austin’s life have been duty, 
honor, country. West Point has done 
its job. Now, that may sound quaint to 
some, but I think having individuals of 
impeccable character at the top of our 
government is more important than 
ever. Other than integrity, there is no 
singular requirement for the difficult 
job of Secretary of Defense, and as the 
former Director of the Joint Staff and 
as the former CENTCOM Commander, 
Mr. Austin certainly has insight on 
critical issues, such as interagency 
budget battles, working with allies, 
and congressional oversight. 
Mr. Austin is also fully committed to 
the constitutional principle of civilian 
control of our military—something 
that those who serve in uniform typi-
cally understand and revere more than 
those who don’t. In that regard, you 
may recall that, about 10 days ago, we 
had a hearing in the Committee on 
Armed Services on this very important 
topic, but I actually thought some of 
the witnesses had rather simplistic 
views of this important issue. 
They had brought up topics and dis-
cussions of so-called ‘‘military logic’’ 
by those who wear the uniform versus 
‘‘political logic’’ for those who don’t 
wear the uniform. 
So let me play devil’s advocate for 
those who participated and watched 
that hearing. 
The very nature of the confirmation 
hearing that we had with Mr. Austin 
just 2 days ago and, indeed, the very 
nature of the transfer of power that we 
saw yesterday here at the Capitol are 
evidence, in my view, that the civilian 
control of the military is not at risk in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S85 
January 21, 2021 
America. I actually believe the related 
but opposite problem should be of more 
concern today, at this moment, and 
that problem is no military experience 
in the top ranks of our government. 
With the exception of Mr. Austin, no 
nominee on the incoming Biden admin-
istration’s national security team has 
ever served in uniform. With regard to 
the entire Biden Cabinet, only one 
other nominee has any military experi-
ence at all. This is not wise. 
If confirmed, I am sure I won’t agree 
with all of Mr. Austin’s decisions, but 
when the inevitable budget battles 
occur, it will be critical for our Na-
tion’s security and, very importantly, 
the military members and their fami-
lies who serve to have a Secretary of 
Defense who understands firsthand the 
very real morale and readiness prob-
lems that result from drastic cuts to 
our 
military—something, 
unfortu-
nately, I think many of my colleagues 
here in the Senate will be pushing for 
and even members of the Biden admin-
istration will be pushing for. 
So let me conclude with this. Right 
now, a number of us are interviewing 
Cabinet members for confirmation for 
the incoming Biden administration. I 
anticipate opposing some, supporting 
others. Certainly, I anticipate opposing 
some if I believe they will hurt the 
working families of my State. But with 
regard to Mr. Austin, I am fully sup-
porting his nomination. 
We 
are 
living 
through 
difficult 
times—a pandemic, racial tensions, 
riots, turmoil at the top of the Pen-
tagon, and rising dangers from China, 
Russia, and Iran. Mr. Austin’s con-
firmation won’t solve all of these prob-
lems, but it will help. 
He represents the best of America—a 
man of integrity, humility, and char-
acter, with a wealth of relevant experi-
ence. Our allies will take comfort in 
his confirmation, and our adversaries 
will take pause. And as America’s first 
African-American 
Secretary 
of 
De-
fense, he will be an inspiration to mil-
lions both in and out of uniform. 
For all of these reasons, I strongly 
urge my colleagues to support Mr. Aus-
tin’s confirmation and the waiver in 
Federal law that it requires. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
HONORING THE UNITED STATES 
CAPITOL POLICE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
can say with certainty that General 
Austin has no better friend or ally in 
this Chamber than Senator DAN SUL-
LIVAN, who has seen him as a person 
and seen him as a commander. 
Those votes will occur later today. 
Madam President, I rise today on the 
floor to talk about what happened yes-
terday at the Capitol and what hap-
pened 2 weeks ago at the Capitol. 
Yesterday, we had the 59th Presi-
dential inauguration right here. The 
citadel of democracy was once again 
the place where a President and Vice 
President were sworn in for 4 years. 
Starting in 1789, every 4 years, Amer-
ica and the world have witnessed this 
remarkable event that provides for the 
peaceful transfer of Executive power 
and the continuity of government— 
something we sometimes take for 
granted but is rare, even today. It has 
happened through wars. It has hap-
pened through economic recessions. We 
have had our inaugurations today and 
during this unprecedented COVID–19 
pandemic. 
What is more, the inauguration took 
place 2 weeks to the day on the very 
west steps of the United States Capitol 
where a violent mob stormed this 
building, desecrating these halls, and 
tried to stop our constitutionally man-
dated deliberations in this body. 
It was the ninth inauguration cere-
mony I have attended. I was proud to 
be there as President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS were sworn in. 
I am here on the floor today to thank 
the Capitol Police and other law en-
forcement agencies, including the Se-
cret Service and its Director, Jim Mur-
ray, who took the lead on this national 
special security event to ensure that 
things went smoothly and that we, in-
deed, had a peaceful transfer of power. 
I also want to give special thanks to 
the men and women of the National 
Guard, who worked to ensure this cere-
mony was safe and secure. Over the 
past 2 weeks, 25,000 National Guard 
troops from across the country, includ-
ing all 50 States and 3 territories, an-
swered the call, leaving their families 
and friends and, for most, leaving their 
regular jobs to help defend this sacred 
celebration of democracy that occurred 
at this place yesterday. 
This number of 25,000 troops includes 
nearly 1,000 guardsmen from my home 
State of Ohio. I had the opportunity to 
meet with a couple hundred of these 
citizen soldiers from Ohio yesterday. I 
was able to tell them how much we ap-
preciate their commitment to the mis-
sion and what they have done, truly, to 
protect democracy and to help our Cap-
itol Police during a stressful time. Be-
cause of their efforts, the ceremony 
was safe for everyone in attendance, 
and we were able to proceed with this 
transfer of power. 
When I thanked them, they all told 
me the same thing—they were just 
doing their duty. They were proud to 
be here. They were protecting their 
country and their fellow citizens. 
I have seen this firsthand over the 
years when I have visited Ohio Na-
tional Guard installations around our 
State, including the Mansfield Air 
Base, the Toledo Air Base, the Spring-
field Air Base, Rickenbacker Air Na-
tional Guard. 
During this pandemic, when more 
Americans than ever are facing severe 
food insecurity, I have had the chance 
to hand out food with members of the 
Ohio Army National Guard who have 
been working around the clock at food 
banks I have been at, like Greater 
Cleveland Food Bank or Central Ohio 
Food Bank. They are working hard 
alongside volunteers to respond to a 
true crisis. 
But that is not all. The Ohio Na-
tional Guard has played an essential 
role in providing critical assistance to 
our prisons and our jails when guards 
were out with the COVID virus. They 
have helped with testing. They have 
helped to get the COVID–19 vaccines 
distributed across our State, and they 
are continuing to do that. We can’t 
thank them enough for what they have 
done during this time of crisis. 
As I have visited with the Guard this 
week, both with regard to the Ohio 
members and Guard from all over the 
country, including some conversations 
I had this morning, I have told them 
all what I have heard from the Capitol 
Police this week. I have heard that 
they really appreciated the backup at a 
time when shifts have been long, sleep 
has been rare, and the effects of the at-
tack on the Capitol are still acutely 
felt. 
It has been a tough 2 weeks on our 
Capitol police officers. It has been a 
tough 2 weeks since the attack on the 
Capitol. 
I want to take this opportunity to 
also express the gratitude of all of us in 
this Chamber and all Americans to the 
Capitol Police for bravely holding the 
line against an illegal, violent mob 
that threatened this building, our pro-
ceedings, and our colleagues. 
In effect, the men and women of the 
Capitol Police Force put their lives on 
the line to defend democracy. It is that 
simple. 
As I said on this floor that terrible 
night 2 weeks ago, it was because of 
their courage that we were safe and be-
cause of their courage that we were 
able to demonstrate to the American 
people and the world that we were 
going to accomplish our constitutional 
duty of certifying the election. They 
allowed us to do that. 
As a Congress, we have begun a com-
plete, impartial, and nonpartisan in-
vestigation into what went wrong that 
day. I am working across the Senate 
with the committees of jurisdiction— 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee, where I will 
be the ranking Republican, the Rules 
Committee, the Appropriations Com-
mittee, and the Intelligence Com-
mittee to ensure that our Capitol Po-
lice are never put in that kind of posi-
tion again. We are performing over-
sight to ensure they have what they 
need to be able to protect the Capitol 
going forward. 
Without prejudging our investiga-
tion, we must consider what reforms 
need to be made and take a hard look 
at the physical security of our Capitol 
Complex. While these buildings must 
remain accessible to the people, we 
need to look at incorporating the best 
practices in physical security, to in-
clude shatterproof windows and doors 
that can’t be easily breached. This will

cost money, but it is absolutely nec-
essary, based on what happened on the 
6th of January. 
I look forward to helping lead this bi-
partisan effort, and I urge my fellow 
Members of Congress to join in. 
Again, I don’t want to prejudge our 
review, but I know among the findings 
we will make is a finding that the offi-
cers on the line were heroic, and those 
officers deserve our gratitude. 
We must never forget those who lost 
their lives that night, including a law 
enforcement officer and member of the 
Capitol Police, Officer Brian Sicknick, 
who, since 2008, had patrolled these 
halls and had been a familiar face to 
many of us. He was tragically killed 
defending this Capitol. He gave his life 
in heroic defense of us and our democ-
racy. 
Only a couple of days after the at-
tack, I learned the tragic news that we 
lost another officer, a friend, Officer 
Howard Liebengood. Howie was on duty 
the day the Capitol was attacked and 
responded to the attack just as his 
many brave comrades did. He experi-
enced some difficult experiences that 
night. I was devastated to learn of his 
death the next day. 
Howie was someone I used to see al-
most every day. He was usually sta-
tioned in the Russell Building, where 
my office is located. He was an utmost 
professional—someone who took great 
pride in his work and had an ironclad 
commitment to keeping people safe. 
His dad was Sergeant at Arms here at 
one time. 
He brightened my day every time I 
saw him. The last time was a few 
weeks ago, when he was standing guard 
outside the doors to the Russell Build-
ing, alone in the cold, alert, vigilant, 
and good-humored. 
Today I reread a letter that I wrote 
to the Chief of the Capitol Police sev-
eral years ago, commending the excep-
tional work of Howie and his partner, 
Chris Gallo, for their ‘‘professionalism, 
coupled with their kind demeanor.’’ 
Howie represented what is great and 
good about not just our police force but 
our country. 
Rest in peace, Officer Brian Sicknick 
and Officer Howard Liebengood. 
Through the tragedy of that day 2 
weeks ago came other stories of brav-
ery and valor too. We have heard about 
the heroic actions of Officer Eugene 
Goodman, an Army veteran whose 
quick thinking under intense pressure 
protected us here in this Senate Cham-
ber by leading the mob away from the 
Chamber while many of us were still 
inside. 
He unselfishly put himself in danger 
and, despite the risk, handled himself 
with the professionalism that defines 
the Capitol Police, and I was pleased to 
see his promotion. 
Officer Goodman’s heroic efforts are, 
to me, representative of the actions of 
all the brave officers of the Capitol Po-
lice, who, on that day of violence and 
lawlessness, held the line against the 
mob. 
I am proud of another member of the 
Capitol Police. This is the supervisor. 
Inspector Tommy Lloyd is commander 
of the Capitol division—as compared to 
the House and the Senate, commander 
of the division to protect the Capitol 
itself. 
This is a powerful photograph that I 
saw in TIME magazine. It is a photo-
graph of him facing the mob, shoulder 
to shoulder with his line officers. 
The Capitol was breached, but be-
cause of the valor of these men and 
women, we were able to complete our 
job and are able to be here today, dis-
cussing the workings of our democracy, 
confirming members of the new admin-
istration, doing our job. 
The actions of law enforcement in 
the Capitol should serve as a reminder 
to all of us of the risks our police offi-
cers take every single day to keep us 
safe—not just here in the Capitol but 
around the country. On Monday, for ex-
ample, the city of Toledo, OH, lost one 
of its own when Officer Brandon Stalk-
er of the Toledo Police Department was 
killed in a standoff with a gunman. Of-
ficer Stalker, only 24 years old, was the 
father of two young children and en-
gaged to be married. He had a prom-
ising life ahead of him. My thoughts 
are with the friends and families of Of-
ficer Stalker and the friends and fami-
lies 
of 
Officers 
Sicknick 
and 
Liebengood during this difficult time. 
Even with all the threats and chal-
lenges they face, our officers of the law 
here and around the country carry on 
in their duties to protect and to serve. 
They are truly the best of America. Of-
ficer Stalker’s fellow officers will con-
tinue to patrol the streets of Toledo to 
keep its citizens safe. Yesterday, de-
spite the hardships they have faced, 
the Capitol Police, once again, lined 
the Halls of Congress, keeping watch 
over the inauguration of the next 
President and Vice President of the 
United States. 
Together, the National Guard, the 
Capitol Police, the Secret Service, and 
other law enforcement protected a 
Presidential inauguration that was at 
once like none other in recent memory, 
and yet also a continuation of a long 
and 
great 
tradition—an 
unbroken 
chain of peacefully transferring power 
that our Nation has cherished since 
1789. They did their duty, as they do 
every day, in defense of the values we 
Americans hold dearest—democracy, 
liberty, rule of law—and we all owe 
them a debt of gratitude.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WITH-

YEARS 
OF 
RELIEF 
FROM ACTIVE DUTY 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to consideration of H.R. 335, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 335) to provide for an exception 
to a limitation against appointment of per-
sons as Secretary of Defense within seven 
years of relief from active duty as a regular 
commissioned officer of the Armed Forces. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be up to 30 minutes of debate 
on the bill. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
rise today in opposition of the legisla-
tive waiver for the nominee to become 
the next Secretary of Defense. 
Since the inception of our Republic, 
civilian control of our military by 
democratically-elected 
civilians 
has 
been fundamental to American Govern-
ment. This principle was firmly estab-
lished as General George Washington 
famously resigned his commission to 
the Continental Congress in 1783, when 
he might have easily positioned him-
self as the leader of the fledgling Amer-
ican Government instead. With this 
bedrock principle in mind, Congress in 
1947 established a limitation on former 
military generals serving as Secretary 
of Defense without a sufficient number 
of yes in civilian life. Today, Active- 
duty military members must have been 
retired for at least 7 years before be-
coming eligible to serve as Defense 
Secretary. 
Four years ago, despite great concern 
for what I saw as an erosion of the 
principle of civilian control of our mili-
tary, I voted in support of granting a 
‘‘one-time exception’’ to the statutory 
requirement for the confirmation of 
Gen. James Mattis. Until Congress

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S87 
January 21, 2021 
granted a waiver of this requirement in 
2017 for General Mattis, Congress had 
approved a waiver only once before, in 
1950 for General George Marshall. With 
the nomination of Gen. Lloyd Austin, 
what I had thought would be a once-in- 
a-generation waiver in 2017 now ap-
pears to be the start of an unwelcome 
trend. 
To be clear, I do not believe that 
General Austin himself poses a specific 
risk to the civilian control of our mili-
tary. By all accounts, he is a dedicated 
public servant and patriot with more 
than 40 years of successful military 
service. However, I do not believe that 
President Biden has offered a strong 
enough justification for granting an-
other legislative waiver in so short a 
time. 
Should a waiver for his service be ap-
proved over my objections, which ap-
pears likely to occur, I intend to sup-
port 
General 
Austin’s 
nomination 
based on his merits and qualifications. 
Over the course of his long and distin-
guished 
career, 
including 
as 
com-
mander of U.S. Central Command dur-
ing one of the region’s most chal-
lenging periods for the United States, 
he has served with professionalism and 
diligence and has earned the trust of 
President Biden. 
General Austin has committed to up-
hold the principle of civilian control of 
the military and pledged to ensure ci-
vilian leadership and oversight over 
the Pentagon’s strategic and oper-
ational planning. I commend General 
Austin for once again answering the 
call to serve, and I look forward to 
working with him to rebalance our 
civil-military relations toward civilian 
control. 
In November 2018, the congression-
ally appointed National Defense Strat-
egy 
Commission 
concluded 
that, 
‘‘There is an imbalance in civil-mili-
tary relations on critical issues of 
strategy development and implementa-
tion. Civilian voices appear relatively 
muted on issues at the center of U.S. 
defense and national security policy.’’ 
Losing this civilian perspective can 
have profound, long-term strategic im-
pacts on the Pentagon and our national 
security policy. 
There are many reasons for this 
trend toward unbalanced civil-military 
relations in recent years, including the 
failure of the prior administration to 
adequately fill Senate-confirmed posi-
tions at the Pentagon, instead relying 
on acting officials with limited ability 
to assert themselves within the depart-
ment. 
We have also seen a troubling in-
crease in the politicization of our mili-
tary. For example, hundreds of retired 
generals and admirals signed public 
letters of support for Presidential can-
didates in 2020, with both campaigns 
competing for the most military en-
dorsements. That was coupled with a 
growing trend toward political expres-
sion among the ranks on social media 
and elsewhere; in at least one instance, 
servicemembers in uniform were fea-
tured at one of the national Presi-
dential nominating conventions. It is 
imperative that military officers do 
not come to view their commands as 
auditions for future political appoint-
ments or opportunities to curry favor 
with civilian political leaders. 
As Dr. Lindsay Cohn, a professor at 
the U.S. Naval War College, stated dur-
ing the recent Senate Armed Services 
Committee hearing examining civilian 
control of the Armed Forces, civilian 
control of our military is not nec-
essarily an on-off switch. It is a web of 
institutions, norms, practices, and un-
derstandings which can be weakened or 
strengthened. Recently, we have begun 
to see the principle of civilian control 
of the military weakened and degraded. 
In my view, Congress must not sim-
ply acquiesce to that growing trend. I 
do not believe it would be wise to allow 
the exception to swallow the rule when 
it comes to such a foundational prin-
ciple of our Republic as civilian control 
of the military. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to once again oppose 
a waiver to bypass U.S. law and allow 
a recently retired member of Armed 
Forces to serve as our Secretary of De-
fense. On the merits, I support the 
nomination of Lloyd Austin, and I be-
lieve that Mr. Austin is highly quali-
fied for this role. However, the impor-
tance of civilian leadership at the De-
partment of Defense is greater than 
any individual nominee. 
The subordination of military au-
thority to civil authority is a bedrock 
principle of our democracy. In 2017, 
when I voted against a waiver to allow 
James Mattis to serve as Secretary of 
Defense, I stressed that our Founders’ 
emphasis on civilian leadership distin-
guished the young United States from 
the other nations of the time. I also 
noted that in enacting the exception 
for General Marshall in 1950, Congress 
expressly stated that: ‘‘the authority 
granted by this Act is not to be con-
strued as approval by the Congress of 
continuing appointments of military 
men to the office of Secretary of De-
fense in the future. It is hereby ex-
pressed as the sense of the Congress 
that after General Marshall leaves the 
office of secretary of defense, no addi-
tional appointments of military men to 
that office shall be approved.’’ 
I still believe that the 7-year waiting 
period is a valuable practice—one of 
many—that 
preserves 
our—Nation’s 
long tradition of placing civilian au-
thority above military authority. In 
2017, I said ‘‘should Congress vote to 
waive this law at this moment in time, 
I will review the nomination [. . .] on 
its individual merits.’’ And I intend to 
apply my words then to my actions 
now and will consider Mr. Austin’s 
nomination on its merits when it 
comes to the floor for a vote.

TRIBUTE TO DR. MICHAEL CARTER 
Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, 
for more than two decades, my friend 
Dr. Michael Carter has made Camp-
bellsville University an oasis where 
students can answer their calling. Nes-
tled in the heart of Taylor County, CU 
offers quality Christian higher edu-
cation to thousands of future leaders. 
As the school’s president, Michael ac-
complished one remarkable goal after 
another. He also set the university on a 
path toward long-term success. At the 
end of last year, Michael began a rich-
ly-earned retirement leaving behind a 
grateful 
university 
community. 
I 
would like to take a moment today to 
recognize my friend for his servant 
leadership and his lasting impact in 
Kentucky and beyond. 
According to CU’s board chair, Mi-
chael’s 
leadership 
‘‘forever 
trans-
formed’’ 
the 
century-old 
school. 
I 
couldn’t agree more. When Michael 
came to campus in 1999, the university 
was home to around 1,600 students and 
74 full-time faculty. His tenure has 
seen the CU family grow to include 
more than 13,500 students and a record- 
setting freshman class despite the 
coronavirus pandemic. CU recently 
graduated its first class of Ph.D. stu-
dents, marking a major milestone for 
the school’s academic excellence. He 
also nearly tripled the faculty ranks 
with leading scholars and dedicated 
educators. 
To accommodate the new students 
and faculty, Michael undertook an am-
bitious plan to grow CU’s physical foot-
print. That plan—like everything at 
CU—was centered on faith. Michael 
embarked on the construction of a 
landmark chapel anchoring the entire 
community in its mission. Then, under 
the steeple of the new Ransdell Chapel, 
the growth has continued to surpass 
expectations. 
CU’s expansion wasn’t limited to the 
city of Campbellsville, either. Michael 
oversaw the opening of eight additional 
centers of learning in Kentucky and 
around the country. The university was 
even approved for a new international 
arm in Ontario. Today, CU properties 
account for 1.1 million square feet, giv-
ing it the ability to serve current stu-
dents with plenty of space to expand 
its reach. 
In each of my visits to the school, I 
have been impressed by the remarkable 
development under Michael’s leader-
ship. From its 850 student athletes to a 
$137 million economic impact in Taylor 
County, Michael has helped CU reach 
previously unbelievable heights. With 
the rest of his all-star leadership team, 
including 
my 
friend 
Dr. 
John 
Chowning, Michael drove the school’s 
growth while keeping focus on an un-
matched student experience. 
When CU bid farewell to its presi-
dent, the community also said goodbye 
to its consequential first lady. Debbie 
Carter has a long list of accomplish-
ments in her own right. She took a 
leadership role in securing a national 
accreditation for CU’s Carver School of 
Social Work. She was also a driving 
force to create pathways for students 
with financial needs to attend CU. Mi-
chael and Debbie made an incredible 
team that changed this university and 
our Commonwealth for years to come. 
Whatever the future holds in store 
for Michael and Debbie, I would like to 
wish them the very best. They leave of-
fice with the sincere gratitude of a uni-
versity community made better by two 
decades of devotion. I encourage my 
Senate colleagues to join me in hon-
oring Dr. Michael Carter for his leader-
ship at Campbellsville University.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL, 
RET. ARTHUR T. DEAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
would like to recognize the retirement 
of MG Arthur Dean as CEO and execu-
tive chairman of Community Anti- 
Drug Coalitions of America, known as 
CADCA. MG Arthur T. Dean, U.S. 
Army, Retired, came from humble be-
ginnings in North Carolina to rise to 
the highest, most distinguished levels 
of military service, where he retired 
after 31 years at the grade of major 
general. He possesses numerous mili-
tary awards, with the highest being 
two awards of the U.S. Army Distin-
guished Service Medal. 
I have had the honor to work with 
CADCA for many years and have long 
supported their efforts to prevent drug 
abuse. For instance, I supported and 
led efforts to create the Drug Free 
Communities Program in 1997. 
Major General Dean began his career 
as CEO and board chair at CADCA in 
1998, so we have had the pleasure of 
working on anti-drug efforts for over 20 
years. I applaud him in his well-de-
served retirement. 
Over the past 23 years of service, I 
have had the pleasure to witness Gen-
eral Dean use his superior leadership, 
diplomatic skills, and passion to build 
CADCA into a world-class organiza-
tion. Under his leadership, the Drug 
Free Communities Program has grown, 
and now over 2,000 communities benefit 
from these grants. 
General Dean is a leader with vision, 
compassion, and a steely determina-
tion to ensure that substance use pre-
vention remains a national priority so 
the next generation of Americans can 
grow up safe, healthy and drug free. 
General Dean has been an out-
standing leader of CADCA. His legacy 
will be one of progress and dedication 
towards reducing rates of youth sub-
stance use and misuse. 
I want to thank General Dean for his 
dedicated and exceptional service to 
our Nation, both as a military and ci-
vilian leader, and wish him well in his 
much-deserved retirement. 
CONFIRMATION OF AVRIL DANICA 
HAINES 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I today rise in support of the nomina-
tion of Ms. Avril Haines as the Director 
of National Intelligence. 
Last night, the Senate overwhelming 
voted to confirm Ms. Avril Haines as 
the Director of National Intelligence 
with a vote of 84–10. 
I voted in support of Director Haines 
as I believe her to be a highly-qualified 
professional with the trust and man-
date by President Biden to be a strong 
leader and reinstall stability and objec-
tivity to the intelligence community. 
She has pledged to defend and uphold 
our democracy, our freedoms and our 
values by ensuring there is simply no 
place for politics ever when it comes to 
intelligence. 
It is clear from her background that 
Ms. Haines has the experience nec-
essary to be an effective DNI. 
She has served as both the Deputy 
Director of CIA and as Deputy National 
Security Advisor to President Obama, 
along with other positions in the White 
House and Congress. 
Her nearly 20 years of experience in 
national security, intelligence, and for-
eign policy matters gives her valuable 
insight into the many challenges fac-
ing the intelligence community and 
makes her a great choice for Director 
of National Intelligence. 
Based on my conversations with Di-
rector Haines and her testimony before 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, I 
am fully confident she has what it 
takes to put the IC on the right path. 
During her confirmation hearing on 
Tuesday, January 19, 2021, Director 
Haines outlined her top three prior-
ities: No. 1, strengthening the institu-
tion including increasing trust and 
credibility with analytic objectivity; 
No. 2, better aligning IC efforts and re-
sources to the major threats we are 
facing such as China and transnational 
threats; and No. 3, building better part-
nerships Congress, academia, the pri-
vate sector, U.S. State and local offi-
cials, and with other countries. 
I strongly agree on these significant 
priorities and look forward to periodi-
cally receiving updates from her on 
these. 
Furthermore, I thank her for her 
clearly 
stated 
position 
that 
waterboarding is, in fact, torture and 
that the CIA’s former interrogation 
program’s 
enhanced 
interrogation 
techniques included torture. 
In short, she is the ideal candidate to 
head the intelligence community at a 
time when we face numerous crisis 
threatening our national security. 
She inherits an intelligence commu-
nity beset by challenges, and I look 
forward to working with her to protect 
the American people. 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the Di-
rector of National Intelligence must 
demonstrate commitment to restrain-
ing the vast power of our intelligence 
agencies. They should not view them-
selves as an enabler or facilitator of

agencies that already operate without 
public scrutiny. We do not need an-
other Washington insider in this posi-
tion, someone who will go along to get 
along, helping to further the expansion 
of secret government powers. 
What we need is someone who is a 
skeptic of these powers. After years of 
revelations of government spying on 
Americans and the exposure of the un-
constitutional applications of these 
powers, I had hoped that the President 
would submit a nominee that under-
stands the importance of regaining the 
public’s trust, to pledge transparency 
and accountability. 
The 
President’s 
nominee, 
Avril 
Haines, does not meet that profile. She 
played a key role in formulating the 
government’s legal authority to con-
duct summary executions by drone and 
was reportedly summoned in the mid-
dle of the night to approve lethal drone 
strikes. As Deputy Director of the CIA, 
she declined to punish any of the CIA 
employees who spied on the Senate as 
it was investigating the CIA’s torture 
programs. Her record is that of an in-
sider, someone who will defend the bro-
ken status quo. I will not support more 
of the same unconstitutional policies, 
and I oppose her confirmation.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CITI-
ZENS COMMITTEE FOR ELECTION 
INTEGRITY 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, along 
with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
MIKE 
CRAPO, I rise today to ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the mission statement for the Citizens 
Committee for Election Integrity and 
their recommended minimum stand-
ards for fair and honest elections. Ida-
hoans concerned about election integ-
rity formed the Citizens Committee for 
Election Integrity to demonstrate the 
meaning of the Constitution by helping 
ensure the voices of ‘‘We the people’’ 
are heard. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
The Citizens Committee for Election Integ-
rity’s mission statement reads as follows: 
All political power rests with the people. 
Our Constitutionally guaranteed repub-
lican form of government relies on free, fair, 
and honest elections to select our represent-
atives and leaders. 
To ensure equal protection and equal rep-
resentation of the people, laws governing our 
elections must meet certain minimum stand-
ards. 
It is the purpose of this Citizens Com-
mittee to concisely articulate the minimum 
standards for free, fair, and honest elections. 
These standards shall then be used by our 
local, state and federal legislators as a met-
ric for reviewing and revising election law to 
ensure free, fair, and honest elections where 
the outcome is accepted by all citizens of 
good will. 
On January 2, 2021, the committee met at 
the Idaho State Capitol to recommend the 
following minimum standards for fair and 
honest elections: 
Our Constitutionally guaranteed repub-
lican form of government relies on free, fair, 
and honest elections to select our represent-
atives and leaders. 
The standards listed here shall be used by 
our local, state and federal legislators as a 
metric for reviewing and revising election 
law to ensure free, fair, and honest elections 
where the outcome is accepted by all citizens 
of good will. 
1. All voting processes, other than those 
needed to preserve the privacy of a citizen’s 
vote, must be open and available for direct 
observation, with no minimum distance re-
quirements, and audit by agents of the can-
didates or parties. 
2. All election materials must have a se-
cure chain of custody at all times. Election 
officials must be accompanied by observers 
when 
accessing 
any 
election 
materials. 
Records of the chain of custody shall be com-
plete and available for audit. 
3. All votes, regardless of voting method, 
shall be held to equal standards. 
4. Voters shall only be qualified electors 
that are able to verifiably provide their gov-
ernment issued photo identity before being 
issued a ballot. Voters who provide false in-
formation, including information of voter 
qualification, should face severe penalties. 
5. As a condition of being issued a ballot, 
the voter’s identity and signature must be 
recorded in a permanent record (Poll Book). 
6. Original Ballots must have a physical 
form that allows voting choices to be exam-
ined and properly interpreted by the naked 
eye. 
7. Ballots must have features designed to 
prevent counterfeiting. 
8. An auditable system for tracking the 
status of all ballots must be implemented 
and maintained in the State of origin. The 
total number of printed ballots must equal 
the sum of the number of cast ballots, 
spoiled ballots, and unvoted ballots. 
9. Ballot tabulation must be conducted by 
two independent and unrelated systems. The 
difference in totals between the two systems 
must be less than one half the margin of vic-
tory or 0.1% of the vote total, whichever is 
less. Tabulating machines must only tab-
ulate and not modify ballots in any way, or 
be connected to the internet. 
10. Before the results of an election can be 
certified, the ballot counts must be rec-
onciled with the voter records. The margin 
of uncertainty must be less than one half the 
margin of victory or 0.1% of the vote total, 
whichever is less. 
11. Lists of qualified electors must be 
purged of unqualified persons 180 days before 
an election. Voter Rolls should be vetted and 
compared with available government records 
to identify duplicate or ineligible registra-
tions. 
12. Laws and regulations governing an elec-
tion may not be changed for 180 days prior to 
that election. 
13. All election records should be retained 
and preserved for not less than 22 months. 
14. Voter identification for provisional bal-
lots must be verified, with information pro-
vided by the voter, prior to that ballot being 
counted.

REMEMBERING HENRY H.R. 
‘‘HANK’’ COE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
on Tuesday, January 12, 2021, the 2021 
General Session of the Wyoming Legis-
lature got underway. Noticeably absent 
from the first day of the session was 
State Senator Henry H.R. ‘‘Hank’’ Coe. 
Hank had been present in Cheyenne for 
the first day of the annual legislative 
session for 32 consecutive years. 
In March of 2020, on the last day of 
the 2020 Wyoming legislative session, 
Hank announced his plan to retire. 
Senator Coe represented the people of 
Park County from 1988 to 2020. 
Hank was a respected and effective 
legislator. He earned a reputation for 
being a kind, thoughtful, persuasive 
legislator of great integrity. 
Hank always had a remarkable grasp 
of the issues facing the state and his 
home community. He could see short 
and long-term needs and offer solutions 
to address those needs. 
During his time in the legislature, 
Senator Coe served on numerous com-
mittees, was elected as majority floor 
leader, and, in 2001, served as president 
of the senate. 
For 17 years, Hank proudly served as 
the chair of the senate education com-
mittee. He was a strong proponent of 
local control and high-quality edu-
cation. 
Hank showed students that through 
hard work and dedication to their stud-
ies, there was a world of opportunities 
within their reach. He understood the 
importance of investing in our young 
people, recognizing their achievements, 
and providing them with the tools 
needed to succeed. 
When I served in the Wyoming State 
Senate, I had the great honor of work-
ing with Hank Coe on one of our proud-
est legislative initiatives, the creation 
of the Hathaway scholarship program. 
We were able to create a scholarship 
fund with a $400 million permanent en-
dowment. Income from the fund con-
tinues to fund scholarships for Wyo-
ming high school graduates today. The 
Hathaway scholarship program allows 
every Wyoming student, regardless of 
economic background, to qualify for a 
merit-based scholarship to attend the 
University of Wyoming or any of our 
State’s seven community colleges. 
Senator Coe’s leadership was a driv-
ing force behind passage of this legisla-
tion. Thousands of Wyoming students 
without the resources to obtain a col-
lege education have benefited from this 
scholarship. 
Hank’s contribution to public service 
extended far beyond Wyoming’s cap-
itol. He was a mentor to many in his 
hometown of Cody. He participated 
fully on local boards and committees. 
The Cody Chamber of Commerce, Cody 
Medical Foundation, Cody Yellowstone 
Air Service, Wyoming Air Service, Buf-
falo Bill Museum of the West, and the 
Park County Commissioners all bene-
fited from Hank’s committed service. 
When Hank retired, he released the 
following statement, which was printed 
in the Cody Enterprise on March 13, 
2020: 
‘‘The Wyoming Legislature continues to be 
one of the most effective and civil deliberate 
bodies in the nation. It is my sincere hope 
that this tradition will continue and Wyo-
ming can be an example to the rest of the na-
tion,’’ said Coe. ‘‘Serving in the Senate has 
been a true honor and a privilege. I’m eter-
nally grateful to the people of Park County 
who put their faith in me to represent them 
for so many years. To my community, 
friends, family, fellow lawmakers and the ex-
ceptional legislative staff, I say thank you.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S90 
January 21, 2021 
Hank had a calling to serve. He took 
that calling and ran with it. His life’s 
work has made a difference in the lives 
of the people in Park County and in 
every corner of our great State. His-
tory will look kindly upon the con-
tributions and achievements of Hank 
Coe. 
Hank passed away today, January 21, 
2021. He leaves behind a remarkable 
legacy, and he will be greatly missed 
by a grateful State. To Hank’s entire 
family, especially his children and 
grandchildren: son H.R. and grandson 
Henry, daughter Carey Coe Johnson 
and husband Jeff and grandchildren 
Madeline, Jagger, and Jrakke, and 
daughter Bethany Coe Boydstun and 
grandchildren, 
Jackson, 
Tyler 
and 
Lily—our prayers and well wishes are 
with you. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating the remarkable life of 
Hank Coe. His dedication to service 
will have a profound impact on our 
state for generations. Thank you Hank. 
Ms. 
LUMMIS. 
Madam 
President, 
today I am pleased to recognize Sen-
ator Henry ‘‘Hank’’ Coe, who has re-
tired from the Wyoming State Senate 
after 31 years of dedicated service and 
over 40 years of public service to Wyo-
ming. 
A Cody, WY native, Senator Coe has 
shown his dedication and love for the 
State of Wyoming and willingness to 
serve its citizens. Hank was first elect-
ed to the Wyoming Senate in 1989 and 
served with distinction for over three 
decades. During his tenure in the Wyo-
ming Senate, Senator Coe served as 
vice president of the senate from 1997 
to 1998; senate majority floor leader 
from 1999 to 2000; and as president of 
the senate from 2001 to 2002. 
Senator Coe was chairman of the 
Travel, Recreation and Wildlife Com-
mittee from 1992 to 1998, where he 
worked to grow the tourism industry 
into one of Wyoming’s largest indus-
tries. He also served on the Education 
Committee from 2003 to 2019, working 
to ensure that Wyoming’s children had 
the tools they need to succeed. These 
are just a few of the many roles to 
which Senator Coe brought his passion 
and expertise, and represent a corner-
stone of Wyoming public policy. Prior 
to joining the Wyoming Senate, Sen-
ator Coe served 8 years as a Park Coun-
ty commissioner, and in honor of his 
service, the commissioners have de-
clared April 29 ‘‘Hank Coe Day’’ in 
Park County, WY. 
Senator Coe’s service to our great 
State goes beyond his work as an elect-
ed official. He was a respected member 
of his community. He was a member of 
the Volunteer Fire Department, a 
trustee for the Buffalo Bill Center of 
the West, a member of the Wyoming 
Business Alliance, an advisor for the 
Regional Airport board, and much 
more. 
I had the honor of serving with Sen-
ator Coe during my time in the Wyo-
ming Legislature. Our desks were right 
across the aisle from one another on 
the Senate floor, and we enjoyed play-
ing subtle pranks on each other. I will 
also cherish many evenings at the 
home of his extraordinary mother, Peg 
Coe, retiring to the den of her sprawl-
ing home for drinks and unforgettable 
conversation. The Coes are a one of a 
kind but quintessential Wyoming fam-
ily of the highest order. 
Senator Coe passed away today, but I 
have no doubt he will be an example for 
generations to come of a dedicated 
public servant, a model of humility, 
and a true beacon for the values Wyo-
ming holds dear. 
Thank you, Senator Coe for your 
years of tireless service to Wyoming 
and for your friendship. I send your 
family my condolences. God bless.

TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL 
FREDERICK J. ‘‘FRITZ’’ ROEGGE 
Mr. 
WICKER. 
Madam 
President, 
today I honor a superb leader and war-
rior. I have had the privilege of associ-
ating with VADM Fritz Roegge both 
personally 
and 
professionally 
over 
many years, and it has been my pleas-
ure to do so. After 40 years of uni-
formed service, Vice Admiral Roegge 
will be retiring from the U.S. Navy. On 
this occasion, I believe it is fitting to 
recognize his distinguished service and 
dedication to our Navy. 
Vice Admiral Roegge is an honors 
graduate of the University of Min-
nesota with a bachelor of science in 
mechanical engineering and was com-
missioned through the Reserve Offi-
cers’ Training Corps Program. He went 
on to earn a master of science in engi-
neering management from the Catholic 
University of America and a master of 
arts with highest distinction in na-
tional security and strategic studies 
from the Naval War College. He was a 
fellow of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology Seminar XXI program 
and of the Harvard Kennedy School 
program for Senior Executives in Na-
tional and International Security. 
His sea tours include USS Whale 
(SSN 638), USS Florida (SSBN 728) 
(Blue), USS Key West (SSN 722), and 
most prominently, command of USS 
Connecticut (SSN 22). His major com-
mand was as commodore of Submarine 
Squadron 22, with additional duty as 
commanding officer, Naval Support Ac-
tivity La Maddalena, Italy. 
Ashore, he has served on the staffs of 
both the Atlantic and Pacific Sub-
marine Force commanders, on the staff 
of the Director of Naval Nuclear Pro-
pulsion, on the Navy staff in the As-
sessments Division (N81) and the Mili-
tary Personnel Plans and Policy Divi-
sion (N13), in the Secretary of the 
Navy’s Office of Legislative Affairs at 
the U.S. House of Representatives, as 
the head of the Submarine and Nuclear 
Power Distribution Division (PERS 42) 
at the Navy Personnel Command, and 
as an assistant deputy director on the 
Joint Staff in both the Strategy and 
Policy (J5) and the Regional Oper-
ations (J33) Directorates. 
Vice Admiral Roegge completed his 
first flag officer assignment as the dep-
uty 
commander, 
Joint 
Functional 
Component Command for Global Strike 
at U.S. Strategic Command. He then 
served concurrently as commander, 
Submarine Group 8; commander, Sub-
marines, Allied Naval Forces South; 
deputy commander, U.S. 6th Fleet; and 
director of Operations and Intelligence 
(N3), U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa. 
As a rear admiral, he served on the 
Navy staff as director, Military Per-
sonnel Plans and Policy Division (N13) 
with a concurrent period as director, 
Total Force Manpower Division (N12) 
and then as commander, Submarine 
Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet. 
Vice Admiral Roegge now culminates 
his career of service to the Navy and 
the Nation as the 16th president of the 
National Defense University (NDU). 
NDU is the university of the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the pre-
mier Joint Professional Military Edu-
cation institution in the Department of 
Defense. NDU’s mission to develop 
joint warfighters and other national se-
curity leaders through rigorous aca-
demics, research, and engagement has 
never been more important to our Na-
tion and its security. 
I want to express my gratitude and 
appreciation to Vice Admiral Roegge 
for his outstanding leadership and un-
wavering support of the missions of the 
U.S. Navy. I want to recognize his sup-
portive family, Mrs. Julie Roegge and 
their two sons, Alex and Will. I wish 
Vice Admiral Roegge and his family 
‘‘fair winds and following seas.’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
SESQUICENTENNIAL OF HOUSTON 
COUNTY 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I consider it an honor and a privi-
lege to acknowledge for the official 
record Houston County, TN, sesqui-
centennial anniversary. 
Each State is its own melting pot of 
history and culture, and Tennessee is 
no exception. In Houston County, the 
Irish roots of the pioneers who explored 
the Cumberland River run deep, having 
buried themselves in the rugged, foggy 
hills and creek beds that so resembled 
the founders’ homeland. 
First settled in the 1780s, the Hous-
ton County area served as a new fron-
tier for early pioneers. What began as a 
small working settlement flourished 
into a community that bore witness at 
the crossroads of the Civil War, em-
braced the possibilities of crisscrossing 
railroads, and led the charge toward 
progress that we now look back on as a 
major industrial boom. 
On January 21, 1871, the Tennessee 
legislature officially established Hous-
ton County, named in honor of Texas 
freedom fighter and the sixth Governor 
of Tennessee, Sam Houston. Since 
then, the people who call Houston 
County home have turned their little

tiful place to live, work, and raise a 
family. 
Congratulations are in order to the 
members of the Houston County His-
torical Society and, most importantly, 
to the citizens of Houston County. I 
ask my colleagues to join with me in 
wishing them another 150 years of 
progress and prosperity.∑

REMEMBERING HELEN EUGENIA 
HAGAN 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, today I rise to recognize Ms. 
Helen Eugenia Hagan, a remarkable pi-
anist and pioneer for BIPOC women in 
music. 
Her passion for performing began at a 
young age, and Ms. Hagan became the 
organist for the Dixwell Avenue Con-
gregational 
Church 
when 
she 
was 
around 11 years old. Ms. Hagan’s tal-
ents earned her a spot at the Yale 
School of Music. In 1912, she was the 
first African-American woman to grad-
uate from Yale University. 
At the request of General John J. 
Pershing, 
Ms. 
Hagan 
traveled 
to 
France during World War I as part of a 
group led by preacher Henry H. Proc-
tor. Ms. Hagan was the only Black per-
forming artist sent to France during 
the war. Continuing to break barriers, 
she was also the first Black pianist to 
perform a recital at a New York con-
cert venue. Ms. Hagan’s compositions 
and concert work received outstanding 
praise. The then-Dean of the Yale 
School of Music credited Ms. Hagan 
with ‘‘rare promise,’’ and critics com-
mended her creativity and originality. 
Struggling to find work during the 
Great Depression, she took graduate- 
level courses at Columbia University’s 
Teachers College while still giving per-
formances. In 1933, Ms. Hagan took a 
teaching position at Bishop College in 
Texas and gave private music lessons 
in New York. She remained committed 
to musical composition, performance, 
and education until her passing in 1964. 
On February 6, 2021, the New Haven 
Symphony Orchestra will honor Ms. 
Hagan with a History Award. Alongside 
Yale University, the symphony has 
been dedicated to sharing the life story 
of this incredible woman, who per-
formed her ‘‘Piano Concerto in C 
minor’’ with them in 1916. This award 
is a tribute to Ms. Hagan’s extraor-
dinary legacy, which will be enduring. 
I applaud her many accomplishments 
and hope my colleagues will join me in 
remembering 
Ms. 
Helen 
Eugenia 
Hagan.∑

AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO 
MEET 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
a request for one committee to meet

has the approval of the Majority and 
Minority leaders. 
Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph

ized to meet during today’s session of 
the Senate: 
COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND 
TRANSPORTATION

f 
NOMINATION OF ANTONY BLINKEN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to urge the 
swift confirmation for Tony Blinken to 
be the Secretary of State. 
Like we saw with Avril Haines yes-
terday and moving toward Lloyd Aus-
tin today, we need to hold a floor vote 
on Mr. Blinken’s nomination urgently. 
Mr. Blinken is well known to the 
Senate, having previously been con-
firmed as Deputy Secretary of State, 
having served as the Deputy National 
Security Advisor and, of course, as the 
staff director of the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee before that. 
He is superbly qualified to be the 
Secretary of State, and his knowledge 
and thoughtfulness were on display 
during 5 hours of testimony earlier this 
week. And since then, he has been 
asked to respond to hundreds of ques-
tions. As a matter of fact, he has had 
an inordinate number of questions that 
have been put to him for the record. He 
had nearly over half a hundred before 
his hearing. He has had from a couple 
of our colleagues nearly 600 questions, 
including multiple parts to those ques-
tions. And to my knowledge, he has 
largely answered them all, notwith-
standing the size, the magnitude of it. 
Now, I have been, since I arrived in 
this institution, one of the big advo-
cates of the prerogatives of each and 
every individual Senator and of the in-
stitution. So I take a back step to no 
one, but there is a difference between 
prerogatives and prerogatives that are 
abused, which, in essence, are for the 
purpose of not seeking information but 
for the purpose of delaying a nomina-
tion. 
Now, 
I 
appreciate 
that 
Senator 
RISCH, the present chairman of the 
committee, has been working with me 
to try to accelerate Mr. Blinken’s nom-
ination to the floor, but I would ask 
my colleagues, particularly those on 
the committee, to join him and I in an 
effort to bring one of the important na-
tional security positions in our govern-
ment to the floor for a vote. 
I don’t think we should be leaving 
this weekend without a vote for the 
Secretary of State. 
He is the right person to repair and 
restore our alliances, to rebuild and 
renew the State Department, to rein-
vigorate the relationship between the 
Department and Congress—something

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S92 
January 21, 2021 
that I think Republicans and Demo-
crats alike have agreed have soured 
dramatically. 
His testimony, his opening state-
ment, his answers to questions show 
that he will be a working partner with 
this institution. 
But, 
obviously, 
confirming 
Mr. 
Blinken is not just about the nominee 
himself. It is about doing what the 
American people expect and the Con-
stitution 
requires—providing 
advice 
and consent to ensure that national se-
curity officials are in office in a timely 
manner. 
We are facing challenges in every 
corner of the world. The world is on 
fire—from Iran to Russia, to Ven-
ezuela, to global challenges that define 
our 
times 
and 
defy 
borders, 
like 
COVID, migration, and climate change. 
We can’t afford delaying to put Mr. 
Blinken in office. We can’t allow the 
State Department to be rudderless. 
If we don’t have leadership, we can’t 
be sure that China or Russia and others 
won’t fill the vacuum as they have for 
the last several years or do something 
that is adverse to our national and eco-
nomic security. 
Imagine that there is a hostage deal 
to be had, as I believe there is, and you 
can’t have another country call the 
Secretary of State because the Sec-
retary of State doesn’t exist. 
Imagine if there are tensions between 
two countries that affect our national 
interests. You don’t have a Secretary 
of State to call as counterpart in those 
countries to seek to ease the tension, 
to remove the threat. 
Imagine if President Biden needs to 
have a Secretary of State engage in 
some part of the world to stop a con-
flict, to open an opportunity, to pre-
vent an unintended consequence. We 
don’t have that person, and we cannot 
expect the President to pick up the 
phone in each and every instance in the 
world as he is trying to deal with 
COVID at home and an economic crisis 
that follows on from that. That is what 
the Secretary of State does. 
So Mr. Blinken also, finally, is not 
just critical to addressing challenges 
abroad, we have to acknowledge what 
the role of Secretary of State is here at 
home. 
If we remember what just happened 
back on the 6th, three of the first four 
officials in the line of succession—the 
Vice President, the Speaker of the 
House, and the President pro tempore 
of the Senate—were in the Capitol 
when domestic terrorists breached the 
building. Every day we learn more de-
tails about this heinous attack, includ-
ing that the terrorists, some of whom 
were chanting ‘‘Hang Mike Pence!’’ 
came within a minute or so of a poten-
tial face-to-face encounter with Vice 
President Pence. Thank God, through 
the quick thinking and heroics of our 
Capitol Police and other law enforce-
ment, those three remained unscathed, 
but if something had happened, it is 
the Secretary of State who is fourth in 
line of succession to the President of 
the United States. Leaving the office 
vacant is irresponsible. It is irrespon-
sible in that regard. It is irresponsible 
in terms of something happening in the 
world and not having a Secretary of 
State who could work to deal with it so 
that we could preserve our national se-
curity, promote our national interests, 
and stop something, an unintended 
consequence, from happening. 
Mr. Blinken has the qualifications. 
The challenges facing our country call 
for him to be confirmed, and I hope the 
Senate does not leave here tomorrow 
until he is confirmed. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
would ask unanimous consent that I be 
recognized for such time as I may con-
sume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let 
me just say to my good friend from 
New Jersey how wholeheartedly I agree 
with him. I have known Tony Blinken 
for a long period of time. I have worked 
with him in different venues. I talked 
to him today at some length, and we 
talked together on many issues that I 
think are significant. 
One issue out there is the one we 
have been talking about in the Western 
Sahara. He understands the issues. So I 
join my friend from New Jersey in en-
couraging a fast and quick confirma-
tion. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO TEAM INHOFE 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we 
recently said goodbye to a lot of really 
good, hard-working men and women 
from the previous administration, and 
I want to highlight a few of them. 
We refer to them—some of my friends 
and some of my enemies refer to them 
as the ‘‘Inhofe mafia.’’ It comes from 
the committees that I have chaired, 
both the Armed Services Committee as 
well as the Environment and Public 
Works Committee. But anyway, they 
are really a great bunch of people. 
I am going to start with Andrew 
Wheeler. Andrew Wheeler was with me 
for a number of years—14 years—before 
he became the Director of the EPA. 
Here is a guy who was nominated to be 
the Administrator. At that time, I said 
that there is no one in America who is 
as qualified as Andrew Wheeler for this 
job. The first job he had out of law 
school was with the EPA. When he was 
nominated to be Administrator, I kind 
of gave his whole life history. 
All of my Senate colleagues know 
Andy and have known him for a long 
period of time—Democrats and Repub-
licans. He has worked for me in the 
Senate as well as becoming one of my 
‘‘has-beens,’’ as we refer to people who 
used to be with me and are still my 
good friends. 
Andy started in my personal office as 
chief counsel and went on to serve as 
the staff director and chief counsel dur-
ing my time as chairman of the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee. 
He has decades of experience and is one 
of the most skilled energy and environ-
mental policy experts I have ever come 
in contact with, and I am immensely 
proud of what he has been able to ac-
complish throughout his career, but 
particularly as EPA Administrator. 
Andy understood that the EPA’s mis-
sion is to implement the laws that are 
passed by Congress for the American 
people. The EPA’s job is not to legis-
late. A lot of people think that. That is 
our job, to legislate, and then he car-
ries it out, and he did really just a 
great job with that. 
Contrary to what many on the left 
say Republicans want, we do want 
clean air and clean water and clean 
land, and Andy proved that he could 
accomplish that without burdensome 
overregulation. During his time at the 
EPA, he spearheaded a number of the 
rules and deregulatory actions that 
brought important relief to American 
job creators while protecting our envi-
ronment. 
He rolled back the economy stand-
ards on cars that were created to try to 
force Americans to drive vehicles they 
don’t want to drive and that they can’t 
afford. In its replacement, Andy devel-
oped the SAFE vehicles rule, which ex-
pands consumer choice and lowers the 
price of vehicles. 
Andy also repealed and replaced the 
waters of the United States rule, or 
WOTUS. On the WOTUS rule, if you 
talk to any of the agricultural groups— 
I am talking about the Farm Bureau 
and other agricultural groups—they 
would say that was the rule we really 
had to do something about. States like 
mine don’t need Washington bureau-
crats imposing their radical regula-
tions like WOTUS on people who know 
the waters better than they do. It is 
not an overstatement when I say that 
this was probably the greatest regu-
latory burden facing Oklahoma’s farm-
ers, landowners, and ranchers during 
the Obama administration. I was proud 
to see WOTUS repealed by the navi-
gable waters protection rule, which 
provided a clean and lawful definition 
of waters of the United States and 
doesn’t try to overregulate the arid 
parts of the State. 
Oklahoma is an arid State. If you go 
out to the western part of Oklahoma, 
the panhandle of Oklahoma, it is really 
arid. If you take that regulation out of 
the hands of the States and give it to 
the Federal Government, there is al-
ways a concern by our farmers and 
ranchers in Oklahoma and across the 
Nation that they would turn these arid 
areas into wetlands. 
Another of the regulatory overhauls 
accomplished by Andy was for the af-
fordable clean energy or the ACE rule 
that replaced the illegal Clean Power 
Plan, which regulated emissions of 
coal-fired powerplants. I had long been 
critical of the Clean Power Plan and 
led the charge against it in the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S93 
January 21, 2021 
Like most of that era of the rules, it 
was a Federal power grab, and it would 
have sent Americans’ electricity bills 
soaring, and we all knew that. But we 
made it history when we repealed and 
replaced the Clean Power Plan with the 
ACE rule. It was good. Not only did 
this rule help Americans’ electricity 
costs be affordable, it is expected to 
benefit the environment as well. 
Just last month, the EPA finalized 
another big rule that requires EPA to 
prepare a cost-benefit analysis before 
coming up with new regulations. How 
is that at all unreasonable? Americans 
shake their heads, and they wonder 
why we would pass things that don’t 
have any kind of a cost-benefit anal-
ysis. What is it going to cost? What 
kind of sacrifices are we going to have 
to make? Well, we put that into effect, 
and I think it is something people are 
very thankful for. 
Throughout his tenure, Andy has 
been focused on what is in the best in-
terests of the taxpayers and not just 
the Washington bureaucrats. That is 
clear with this rule and countless oth-
ers. 
You know, one of the good things 
about Andy, as I already mentioned, is 
that he knows more about the process 
than anybody else does—more about 
the EPA. He has always been a star, 
and he started at the bottom. When he 
was first put into that office and was 
confirmed as EPA director, he gave a 
speech over at the EPA. He didn’t 
know I was there. I went over there to 
hear it. He had 300 people at the EPA 
all listening to him and looking at him 
and saying: There is room at the top 
for me. Here is a guy who started at 
the very bottom and ended up as direc-
tor of the EPA. It didn’t go unnoticed. 
Everybody realized that. 
So I would ask unanimous consent to 
have printed in the RECORD an E&E 
News article from July 2018, which de-
tails a number of the former staff peo-
ple and their backgrounds. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[July 6, 2018] 
‘BRAVE NEW WORLD’ AS TEAM INHOFE TAKES 
OVER 
(By Robin Bravender) 
It’s official: Alumni of the best-known cli-
mate skeptic in Congress are leading EPA. 
Former aides to Sen. Jim lnhofe (R-Okla.) 
have helped shape President Trump’s energy 
policy agenda since even before he was elect-
ed. Many of them quickly landed top spots at 
EPA and in the White House, and Inhofe 
alumnus Ryan Jackson helped shepherd 
Scott Pruitt through the confirmation proc-
ess before becoming his chief of staff at the 
agency last year. 
But now an ex-Inhofe staffer is taking the 
reins as Pruitt leaves under a cloud of con-
troversies. 
Andrew Wheeler, who steps in as EPA’s 
chief on Monday, was staff director and chief 
counsel to Inhofe on the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee for much 
of the George W. Bush administration. 
Jackson, a longtime friend of Wheeler, is 
expected to remain as EPA’s chief of staff 
after Pruitt’s exit. Jackson—a native Okla-
homan—was an Inhofe aide who worked as 
EPW staff director and Inhofe’s chief of staff. 
Brittany Bolen became the acting head of 
EPA’s policy shop after Samantha Dravis 
left earlier this year. Bolen was Republican 
counsel to Inhofe on the EPW Committee. 
Daisy Letendre, a communications adviser in 
the policy office, was Inhofe’s communica-
tions director. 
And 
former 
Inhofe 
counsel 
Mandy 
Gunasekara is now principal deputy assist-
ant administrator in EPA’s air office. 
Republicans and some energy industry lob-
byists say Inhofe’s alumni network brings 
deep policy knowledge to EPA and is well- 
positioned to bring calm to an agency that 
has been mired in controversies under Pru-
itt. 
‘‘With these Inhofe staff, you get all of the 
Pruitt policy and none of the Pruitt bag-
gage,’’ said an energy lobbyist and former 
congressional staffer. 
It makes sense that ex-Inhofe aides would 
populate EPA under a Republican adminis-
tration, the lobbyist said, given Inhofe’s long 
tenure as the top Republican on the Senate 
committee charged with overseeing the 
agency. ‘‘He has hired a lot of smart people 
to work for him who were goqd and have 
gone on to do various other things,’’ the lob-
byist said. 
Those staffers have a history of working 
closely with Democrats on Capitol Hill, that 
person added: ‘‘I think that the Democrat 
staff and members believe that Inhofe and 
the Inhofe staffers treated them fairly when 
they were up there.’’ 
They also share an appreciation for proc-
ess, said Matt Dempsey, Inhofe’s former 
communications director. 
He expects his former colleagues to take a 
‘‘back to basics’’ approach at EPA. ‘‘It’s not 
necessarily a political agenda, but it’s a pol-
icy-based agenda,’’ he said. 
That contrasts with how many people 
viewed Pruitt, who was widely thought to be 
trying to use EPA as a stepping stool to 
reach higher political office. 
Under Wheeler, ‘‘the whole tone is going to 
be different,’’ the energy lobbyist said. ‘‘Peo-
ple are going to perceive that Andy is going 
to spend his time on policy and not thinking 
about whether he’s the next senator from 
Oklahoma.’’ 
But as Republicans and many in industry 
are celebrating the rise of the Inhofe crowd 
at EPA, some on the left are furious that dis-
ciples of the Senate’s most vocal climate 
change skeptic—famous for throwing a snow-
ball on the Senate floor to try to disprove 
global warming—are leading the agency 
tasked with protecting the environment. 
‘‘It is a brave new world of pro-fossil-fuel 
ideologues who seem not to care about any-
thing but industry profits, the rest of the 
country be damned,’’ said Bill Snape, an at-
torney at the Center for Biological Diver-
sity. ‘‘We’re all getting hit in the head by 
the snowball at this point. It’s obviously dis-
turbing’.’’ 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, at 
the top of the list was my chief of staff, 
Ryan Jackson. Like Andy, Ryan also 
went on to be my staff director of the 
EPW Committee, Environment and 
Public Works, where he helped nego-
tiate bipartisan bills for highway, 
water, and infrastructure to environ-
mental bills like TSCA. Remember, 
that was the one that had the chemical 
regulations. In his role he helped me 
negotiate with former California Sen-
ator Barbara Boxer. 
This is kind of interesting. I think 
the Presiding Officer would find this to 
be interesting. Barbara Boxer and I— 
for many, many years, every time the 
Republicans were in the majority, I 
was the chairman of that committee, 
and she was the ranking member. 
Every time the Democrats were in con-
trol, she was the chairman, and I was 
the ranking member. So we worked to-
gether, and we accomplished more. I 
won’t divulge where the meeting is, but 
there is a meeting that Republicans 
have historically had at 12:15 p.m. on a 
Tuesday with all the members of the 
committees, the chairmen. We would 
talk about what we have done, and 
when it was my turn, I would say: Now 
from the committee that actually gets 
things done. That was Barbara Boxer 
and I. No two people could be further 
apart philosophically than Barbara 
Boxer and I, yet we were able to do 
that with the help of Ryan Jackson. 
I actually hired him when he was 
still in college. He left my office early 
2017 to go to work as Chief of Staff at 
the EPA, where he was a central player 
in the implementation of the last ad-
ministration’s policies. 
In February, he left the EPA, which 
was when Mandy Gunasekara took of-
fice as chief of staff. Mandy worked for 
me in the EPW Committee for several 
years as the majority counsel. In that 
role she helped me craft air and other 
policy priorities. While at the EPA, she 
has been instrumental in advancing 
priorities like the ACE rule that I men-
tioned earlier. She is a skilled and de-
voted public servant, and I am proud of 
all that she has done to advance poli-
cies that benefit all Americans. 
A number of others of what I refer to 
as my ‘‘has-beens’’ have served at the 
EPA over the last 4 years. Susan 
Bodine was the chief counsel on EPW 
and went on to serve as Assistant Ad-
ministrator in the Office of Enforce-
ment and Compliance Assurance. 
Brittany Bolen was counsel for the 
EPW, Environment and Public Works 
Committee, and went on to serve as As-
sociate Administrator for the Office of 
Policy. 
Byron Brown was senior counsel at 
the EPW and went on to serve as Dep-
uty Chief of Staff for Policy. 
Then there is Daisy Letendre. She 
was communications director in my of-
fice and went on to serve as a Senior 
Advisor in the Office of Policy. 
So I am proud of all my ‘‘has-beens’’ 
and the big impact that they have had 
on our country. We are grateful for 
their service, past and present—espe-
cially that of Andrew Wheeler and 
Ryan Jackson. I say to our friends 
Wheeler and Jackson: Thank you and 
good luck in your next endeavors. You 
did great work. 
Let me just mention one last thing. I 
urge the Biden administration not to 
repeal a lot of the rules and regulations 
and deregulation initiatives that gave 
us the economy that was unprece-
dented during the time before the pan-
demic set in. It would be devastating to 
our country, which is already trying to 
recover from the pandemic. Now is not

the time to impose costly new regula-
tions on Americans and the job cre-
ators in this country. Everyone knows 
that this pandemic has wreaked havoc 
on our economy, and I am certain that, 
had we not had the virus, we would 
have 
broken 
even 
more 
economic 
records than we already had. 
Prior to the pandemic, we had the 
best economy of our life. We set 
records, with small business optimism 
reaching the highest level on record in 
its 45-year history and unemployment 
hitting a 50-year low of 3.5 percent. We 
have always said in the past that full 
employment is 4 percent. We brought it 
down that entire year, and in February 
of 2020 it was down to 3.5 percent. It 
never had happened before. The median 
household income rose to a record high 
in 2019, the highest since 1967. The 
wealth of American families rose. That 
is an indicator. It rose to the highest 
level in history. So these good things 
were happening, and I would urge this 
administration not to repeal some of 
these regulations. Repealing some of 
these regulations would simply reverse 
gains like these. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
work with me and others to reach com-
promises on regulations that would 
benefit all Americans. That seems to 
be pretty reasonable, and I think that 
is a good program to do. Let’s give it a 
try. OK? 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA LEGISLATIVE AU-
TONOMY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Legislative 
Autonomy Act, which would eliminate the 
wasteful congressional review period for legis-
lation passed by the District of Columbia 
Council and align longtime congressional prac-
tice with the law. The congressional review 
period for D.C. bills is almost entirely ignored 
by Congress, providing it no benefit, but im-
poses substantial costs (in time and money) 
on the District. Congress has almost always 
used the appropriations process, rather than 
the disapproval process, to block or nullify 
D.C. bills and almost entirely abandoned the 
disapproval process as its mechanism for nul-
lifying D.C. bills 24 years ago, having used it 
successfully only three times before then. Yet 
Congress still requires the D.C. Council to use 
Kafkaesque make-work procedures to comply 
with the abandoned congressional review pe-
riod established by the D.C. Home Rule Act. 
Our bill would eliminate the congressional 
review period for bills passed by the D.C. 
Council. However, Congress would lose no 
authority it currently exercises because, even 
upon enactment of this bill, Congress would 
retain its authority under Clause 17 of Section 
8 of Article I of the U.S. Constitution to amend 
or overturn any D.C. laws at any time. 
The congressional review period (30 days 
for civil bills and 60 days for criminal bills) in-
cludes those days when either house of Con-
gress is in session, delaying D.C. bills from 
becoming law, often for many months. The 
delay forces the D.C. Council to pass most 
bills several times, using a cumbersome and 
complicated process to ensure that the oper-
ations of this large and rapidly changing city 
continue uninterrupted, avoiding a lapse of a 
bill before it becomes final. The congressional 
calendar means that a 30-day period usually 
lasts a couple of months and often much 
longer because of congressional recesses. For 
example, the congressional review period for a 
bill that changed the word ‘‘handicap’’ to ‘‘dis-
ability’’ lasted nine months. The Council esti-
mates that 50 to 65 percent of the bills it 
passes could be eliminated if the review pe-
riod did not exist. To ensure that a bill does 
not lapse, the Council often must pass the 
same bill in three forms: emergency (in effect 
for 90 days), temporary (in effect for 225 days) 
and permanent. Moreover, the Council has to 
carefully track the days the House and Senate 
are in session for each D.C. bill it passes to 
avoid gaps and to determine when the bills 
have taken effect. The Council estimates that 
it could save 5,000 employee hours and 
160,000 sheets of paper per two-year Council 
period if the review process were eliminated. 
House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY ad-
dressed the issue of saving such resources by 
eliminating the amount of paperwork sent to 
Congress when he proposed a cut in the num-
ber of reports that federal agencies are re-
quired to submit to Congress. Our bill is a per-
fect candidate because it eliminates a paper-
work process that repeats itself without inter-
ruption. 
My bill would do no more than align the 
Home Rule Act with congressional practice 
over the last 24 years. Of the more than 5,000 
legislative acts transmitted to Congress since 
the Home Rule Act was passed in 1973, only 
three resolutions disapproving D.C. bills have 
been enacted (in 1979, 1981 and 1991) and 
two of those mistakenly involved federal inter-
ests—one in the Height Act and the other in 
the location of chanceries. Placing a congres-
sional hold on more than 5,000 D.C. bills has 
not only proven unnecessary, but has imposed 
costs on the D.C. government, residents and 
businesses. District residents and businesses 
are also placed on hold because they have no 
certainty when D.C. bills, from taxes to regula-
tions, will take effect, making it difficult to plan. 
It is particularly unfair to require the D.C. 
Council to engage in this unnecessary, labor- 
intensive and costly process to no effect. My 
bill would only eliminate the automatic hold 
placed on D.C. bills and the need for the D.C. 
Council to comply with a process initially cre-
ated for the convenience of Congress, but that 
is now almost never used. This bill would pro-
mote efficiency and cost savings for Congress, 
the District and D.C. residents and businesses 
without reducing congressional oversight, and 
would carry out the policy stressed by Con-
gress of eliminating needless paperwork and 
make-work redundancy. 
I urge my colleagues to support this good- 
government measure.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PLACE 
ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Preparing Localities for an Au-
tonomous 
and 
Connected 
Environment 
(PLACE) Act. This legislation passed the 
House last session as Section 5303 of the 
Moving Forward Act (H.R. 2, 116th Cong.) and 
creates a federally funded highly automated 
vehicle clearinghouse to study the secondary 
impacts of autonomous vehicles and mobility 
innovation. 
The transportation sector is changing at a 
faster pace than ever before. New mobility op-
tions like Uber and Lyft, bikeshare, and scoot-
ers have already disrupted how Americans get 
around. The private sector has invested more 
than $16 billion toward bringing semi- or fully- 
autonomous vehicles to market, and research 
publications on self-driving technology have 
quadrupled over the past three years. Many 
predict autonomous vehicles will become 
widely available within just a few years. 
Done right, autonomous vehicles can solve 
some of the country’s most vexing transpor-
tation problems while improving mobility for all. 
Done wrong, autonomous vehicles can exac-
erbate transportation’s negative externalities, 
leaving communities struggling to make sense 
of an everchanging landscape. The PLACE 
Act will ensure that autonomous vehicles im-
prove the livability of communities, allowing 
policymakers to understand their influence on 
land use, urban design, transportation, real es-
tate, accessibility, municipal budgets, social 
equity, availability and quality of jobs, air qual-
ity and climate, energy consumption, and the 
environment. I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on this issue as part of a long-term 
surface transportation reauthorization pack-
age.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HAWAI‘I 
INVASIVE SPECIES PROTECTION 
ACT 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
join my colleague, Representative KAHELE, in 
introducing our bill to protect one of the most 
unique and fragile environments on Earth, our 
Hawaii, from devastating invasive species. 
Invasive species pose an especially grave 
threat to Hawaii’s unique ecosystems, natural 
resources and agricultural communities, in part 
due to Hawaii’s unique geography. Hawaii is 
the most isolated island chain and one of the 
most ecologically diverse places in the world. 
We are 2,282 miles from the Continental 
United States, 2,952 miles from Japan and 
4,772 miles from Washington, DC, with no 
other islands in close proximity. We have with-
in our constrained borders ten of the thirteen 
world climate zones, with ecosystems ranging 
from desert to tropical, where plants and ani-
mals that found their way to Hawaii evolved 
like nowhere else. A 2014 survey identified 
fully 9,975 endemic species in Hawaii. These 
species 
include 
the 
Hawaiian 
scarlet 
honeycreeper, the ‘i‘iwi; the flowering ever-
green; and the state mammal of Hawaii, the 
‘Ilioholoikauaua (Hawaiian monk seal). 
However, tragically, in large part due to 
invasive species, Hawaii has become the en-
dangered species and extinction capital of the

almost half of the total endangered species 
nationwide. Many of these species are criti-
cally endangered and face an extremely high 
risk of extinction in the wild. Although we will 
never know the true number of species that 
have gone extinct in Hawaii, best estimates 
are that in the last 200 years alone, 28 bird, 
72 snail, 74 insect and 97 plant species have 
gone extinct. 
As one particularly poignant example, two 
years ago the Atlantic published an article, 
The Last of Its Kind, which chronicled the 
death of George the snail. He was the last 
achatinella apexfulva, a species of tree snail 
that is endemic to the island of O‘ahu. This ar-
ticle calls attention to the alarming fact that 
snails in Hawaii are disappearing at an alarm-
ing rate, perhaps faster any animal on Earth 
right now, victims of various factors in part 
linked to invasive species. 
The threat to our state tree, the ‘o¯hi‘a lehua, 
is also illustrative of our growing crisis. Used 
for poi boards and outrigger canoes, the ‘o¯hi‘a 
lehua is important to Hawaiian culture and the 
islands’ watersheds. As the first tree to grow 
in new Hawaii lava flows, ‘o¯hi‘a grows 
throughout the watershed creating new soil, 
stabilizing steep mountain ridges and com-
prises approximately 80 percent of Hawaii’s 
native forests. However, rapid ‘o¯hi‘a death, or 
ROD, caused by an invasive fungal pathogen, 
kills ‘o¯hi‘a trees quickly, and threatens the sta-
bility of Hawaii’s native forests. Since its dis-
covery on the Big Island in 2014, ROD has 
spread to Kaua‘i, Maui and O‘ahu, and has 
killed hundreds of thousands of trees. 
Hawaii’s unique circumstances also have 
given rise to one of our nation’s most diverse 
and productive agricultural communities. With 
a year-round growing cycle, our crops have 
ranged throughout our history from the highest 
quality sugar and pineapple and cattle to trop-
ical specialty crops like fruit and cut flowers in 
the highest demand worldwide. 
Yet it is exactly because these crops like 
our natural resources have adapted to Ha-
waii’s uniqueness that they are the most sus-
ceptible to devastation from external species 
against which they have no natural defenses. 
Invasive species have drastically impacted ag-
riculture in Hawaii, threatening some of the is-
land’s most valuable crops in the state’s third- 
largest industry. 
Hawaii’s third most valuable crop, the maca-
damia nut, is under threat from the maca-
damia felted coccid. Macadamia felted coccid 
has been found in all of Hawaii Island’s maca-
damia growing regions. The felted coccid re-
duces macadamia tree output by draining nu-
trients from the tree. Invasive species coupled 
with increased rain led to a 22 percent decline 
in the macadamia nut harvest this year com-
pared to last year. 
The cattle industry, which is one of Hawaii’s 
most important agricultural commodities, has 
been dramatically affected by the introduction 
of the invasive two-lined spittlebug. Since 
being detected in 2016, the pest now infects 
more than 125,900 acres of grassland and is 
clearing lands for invasives grasses that fur-
ther affect Hawaii’s ecosystems. 
Yet despite these incontrovertible and grow-
ing impacts of external species on Hawaii’s 
natural resources and economy, existing fed-
eral law leaves Hawaii largely defenseless 
against increasingly destructive invasives. Im-
ports by air and sea, the only means of in- 
bound transportation to our island state, lack 
any 
effective 
regulation 
to 
screen 
out 
invasives. This is despite a fairly robust 
screening of exports from Hawaii to the Conti-
nental United States to screen out invasives 
from Hawaii viewed as harmful to mainland 
agriculture (invasives that, ironically, were 
invasives into Hawaii to start with). 
I sought to crack down on this lax regime to 
prevent and curb invasives with my introduc-
tion in 2005 of H.R. 3468, modeled after New 
Zealand and other isolated jurisdictions with 
then like now the most stringent invasive spe-
cies prevention regimes in the world. Since 
the introduction of that bill, the threats from 
invasives have only grown. Since 2005, 195 
invasive species have been introduced to Ha-
waii. That is in addition to the roughly 5,000 
invasive species that have been introduced to 
Hawaii throughout its history. 
Our bill, the Hawaii Invasive Species Protec-
tion Act, will require the U.S Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Inspec-
tion Service (APHIS), in cooperation with other 
federal departments and the State of Hawaii, 
to conduct visual, x-ray and canine inspec-
tions, as appropriate, on person, baggage, 
cargo and any other article destined for direct 
movement to the State of Hawaii. The inspec-
tions will search for high-risk invasive species 
and agricultural materials. The inspections will 
be conducted at airports, ports and postal 
sorting facilities prior to direct travel to the 
State of Hawaii. 
Our bill further requires APHIS to work with 
the State of Hawaii to develop and publish a 
list of the high-risk invasive species and agri-
cultural materials for the State of Hawaii. It 
pays for these inspections by increasing Agri-
culture Quarantine Inspection fees to cover 
the full cost of inspection. 
Inaction is not an option. Since my re-intro-
duction of this bill last Congress, the coffee 
berry borer, which was discovered in Kona on 
Hawaii Island in 2010, now infects all of the 
coffee growing islands in Hawaii. The coffee 
berry borer can cause yield losses of between 
30 and 35 percent and affects the quality of 
the coffee beans, directly impacting the in-
come of growers. Had this bill been imple-
mented, it may have helped prevent coffee 
leaf rust from entering Hawaii late last year. 
The confirmed presence of this fungal dis-
ease, which can lead to yield losses of be-
tween 50 and 80 percent, on multiple Hawai-
ian islands could leave one of Hawaii’s most 
iconic industries devastated. 
If we truly care about the threat that contin-
ued and escalating invasive species pose to 
one of the most invaluable and unique eco-
systems on earth, in addition to our unique 
economy and way of life, then the stark reality 
is that this bill is what it will take. Again, it is 
not revolutionary when compared to other 
countries that have not only recognized this 
threat but actually done something about it. 
And it is certainly not revolutionary when com-
pared to longstanding domestic restrictions on 
exports from Hawaii, leading to the basic point 
that if these invasive species prevention re-
quirements are good enough for the rest of 
the country and much of the world then they’re 
good enough for Hawaii. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to this House 
for your understanding and careful consider-
ation of Hawaii’s challenge and opportunity, 
and ask for our bill’s expeditious passage. 
Mahalo (thank you). 
APPRECIATING FIRST LADY 
MELANIA TRUMP 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, 
American 
Families 
have 
been 
blessed the last four years with the service of 
First Lady Melania Trump. 
She is a native of Slovenia, a beautiful new 
nation liberated by the American Victory in the 
Cold War inspired by Ronald Reagan, Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II 
of Poland 
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Farewell Message of First Lady Melania 
Trump of January 18, 2021, which is to be 
treasured. 
My fellow Americans, it has been the 
greatest honor of my life to serve as First 
Lady of the United States. 
I have been inspired by incredible Ameri-
cans across our country who lift up our com-
munities through their kindness and cour-
age, goodness and grace. 
The past four years have been unforget-
table. As Donald and I conclude our time in 
the White House, I think of all the people I 
have taken home in my heart and their in-
credible stories of love, patriotism, and de-
termination. 
I see the faces of brave young soldiers who 
have told me with pride in their eyes how 
much they love serving this country. To 
every service member and to our incredible 
military families: You are heroes, and you 
will always be in my thoughts and prayers. 
I think of all the members of law enforce-
ment who greet us wherever we go. At every 
hour of every day, they stand guard to keep 
our communities safe, and we are forever in 
their debt. 
I have been moved by children I have vis-
ited in hospitals and foster care centers. 
Even as they fight difficult illnesses or face 
challenges, they bring such a joy to everyone 
they meet. 
I remember the mothers who have battled 
the disease of Opioid addiction, and have 
overcome incredible hardships for love of 
their children. 
I have been inspired by the devoted care-
givers for babies born with Neonatal Absti-
nence Syndrome, and communities that give 
these children the support and care they 
need to grow. 
When I think about these meaningful expe-
riences, I am humbled to have had the oppor-
tunity to represent a nation with such kind 
and generous people. 
As the world continues to confront the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I thank all the nurses, 
doctors, healthcare professionals, manufac-
turing workers, truck drivers, and so many 
others who are working to save lives. 
We grieve for the families who have lost a 
loved one due to the pandemic. 
Every life is precious, and I ask all Ameri-
cans to use caution and common sense to 
protect the vulnerable as millions of vac-
cines are now being delivered. 
In the midst of this hardship, we have seen 
the best of America shine through. Students 
have made cards and delivered groceries to 
our Senior Citizens. Teachers have worked 
twice as hard to keep our children learning. 
Families have come together to provide 
meals, supplies, comfort and friendship to 
those in need. 
Be passionate in everything you do but al-
ways remember that violence is never the 
answer and will never be justified.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E53 
January 21, 2021 
When I came to the White House, I re-
flected on the responsibility I have always 
felt as a mother to encourage, give strength, 
and teach values of kindness. It is our duty 
as adults and parents to ensure that children 
have the best opportunities to lead fulfilling 
and healthy lives. 
The passion for helping children succeed 
would drive my policy initiative as First 
Lady. 
I launched Be Best to ensure that we as 
Americans are doing everything we can to 
take care of the next generation. Be Best has 
concentrated on three pillars: well-being, on-
line safety, and opioid abuse. 
In a few short years, I have raised aware-
ness of how to keep children safe online; we 
have made incredible progress on our na-
tion’s drug epidemic and how it impacts the 
lives of newborns and families, and we have 
given a voice to our most vulnerable children 
in the foster care system. 
Internationally, Be Best has evolved into a 
platform that encourages world leaders to 
discuss issues impacting the lives of children 
and allows them to share solutions. It has 
been an honor to represent the American 
people abroad. I treasure each of my experi-
ences and the inspiring people I have met 
along the way. 
As I say farewell to my role as First Lady, 
it is my sincere hope that every American 
will do their part to teach our children what 
it means to Be Best. I ask parents to educate 
your children about the courageous and self-
less heroes who worked and sacrificed to 
make this country the land of the free. And 
to lead by example and care for others in 
your community. 
The promise of this Nation belongs to all 
of us. Do not lose sight of your integrity and 
values. Use every opportunity to show con-
sideration for another person and build good 
habits into your daily lives. 
In all circumstances, I ask every American 
to be an ambassador of Be Best. To focus on 
what unites us. To rise above what divides 
us. To always choose love over hatred, peace 
over violence, and others before yourself. 
Together, as one national family, we can 
continue to be the light of hope for future 
generations and carry on America’s legacy of 
raising 
our 
nation 
to 
greater 
heights 
through our spirit of courage, goodness and 
faith. 
No words can express the depth of my grat-
itude for the privilege of having served as 
your First Lady. 
To all the people of this country: You will 
be in my heart forever. 
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless 
the United States of America.

RECOGNIZING RICK SENSE’S SERV-
ICE 
TO 
WISCONSIN’S 
EIGHTH 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
great pleasure to recognize my District Chief 
of Staff, Rick Sense, for his service to Wiscon-
sin’s Eighth District. He began his career with 
the U.S. House of Representatives in January 
of 2011 in the office of my predecessor, Con-
gressman Reid Ribble. He then continued his 
service as my District Chief of Staff, serving 
with me in the 115th and 116th Congress, 
until his time working with us in the House has 
come to an end here in 117th Congress. 
Rick has dedicated his Congressional ca-
reer to providing superior service to the con-
stituents of Northeast Wisconsin. He under-
stood that his job was to make the federal 
government work for Wisconsinites. He dedi-
cated his tenure to forging relationships from 
Appleton to Sturgeon Bay to Marinette, bring-
ing together federal partners, the business 
community, and local nonprofits to share 
knowledge and resources. 
Many who have had the pleasure of working 
with Rick describe him as passionate, reliable, 
approachable, intelligent, and extremely hard-
working. He has a keen awareness of the 
needs of the community and provides valuable 
support in accomplishing the mission of my of-
fice. Despite being a Cubs fan, Rick is a valu-
able asset to Northeast Wisconsin whose work 
has touched the lives of many. 
Additionally, Rick has inspired the next gen-
eration of leaders. Through patient instruction 
and mentorship, interns and staff who have 
worked with Rick have moved on to employ-
ments with the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security, U.S. Agency for International Devel-
opment, as well as Member offices in this 
Chamber, creating a ripple of change that will 
surely leave positive impacts in its wake. 
I wish Rick the best as he begins his new 
role with the Greater Green Bay Chamber of 
Commerce. I am sure he will excel in this new 
position, bringing with him a deep dedication 
to servant leadership and desire to foster col-
laboration amongst Wisconsin’s business com-
munity. 
Politics can be a difficult world to navigate. 
Rick brings to it a compassion and respect 
that provides a constant reminder to us all of 
why we choose to serve this great nation. I’d 
like to close with the words of our former 
president, Abraham Lincoln. ‘‘With malice to-
wards none, with charity for all.’’ Rick truly em-
bodies these words, and I am proud to have 
served in this fine institution with him.

HONORING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
HOUSTON 
COUNTY 
BEING 
ESTABLISHED 
IN 
TEN-
NESSEE 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the one hundred 
fiftieth anniversary of Houston County being 
established and incorporated into the state of 
Tennessee. 
Officially established on January 21st in the 
year 1871, Houston County takes its name 
from the legendary Sam Houston, who, among 
many things, served as the first member of 
Congress from the 7th district of Tennessee. 
Like its namesake, Houston County embodies 
the spirit of American grit and perseverance. 
From the stoked lime kilns of days past to the 
thriving timber industry of today, Houston 
County continues to foster a strong and proud 
community. 
Over its long history, Houston County has 
endeavored to faithfully honor the heritage of 
the Irish pioneers who settled the land through 
the annual Irish Day Parade. One of my favor-
ite events of the year, the Irish Day Parade, 
now draws over 30,000 people to Erin. The 
scenic countryside of Houston County is home 
to gently flowing creeks and streams, rolling 
hills and forests, and a vibrant community with 
a little bit of Ireland in its soul. 
Houston County is home to many of Ten-
nessee’s finest citizens, and I am honored to 
represent them in the United States Congress. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating Houston County on this impressive 
anniversary.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
MEMORY 
OF 
MOLLY 
HAMMMER 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a sadness I struggle to express on 
behalf of a community that has lost a voice, a 
city that has lost a leader, and family that has 
lost a friend. I rise to honor the life and mem-
ory of Molly Hammer. Molly spent years 
gracing Kansas City and the world with a one- 
of-a-kind voice and an indomitable spirit. For 
thirteen of those years, she did so while shar-
ing her life with metastatic breast cancer. On 
Tuesday, November 24, Molly lost her fight 
with breast cancer. She was forty-eight years 
old. Her story, cut tragically short, is of a soul 
who sought to use her gifts to spread joy and 
to use her hardships to inspire hope. For fif-
teen years, Molly sang for us. Today, we sing 
of her. 
Those lucky enough to have followed Mol-
ly’s career since its beginning know that the 
talent, work ethic, and grit she displayed in the 
final years of her life were nothing new. Her 
high school choir teacher remembers her as-
tounding professionalism while playing the 
narrator in her high school’s production of An-
drew Lloyd Webber’s Joseph and the Amazing 
Technicolor Dreamcoat. After graduating, she 
went on to become a stage actor and por-
trayed Patsy Cline on a stage in Iowa for five 
years. In 2005, Molly answered a spiritual call 
from a difficult industry where she could have 
the complete independence she craved—jazz 
and blues. And thank goodness she did. It 
was then that she dove into an intense study 
of vocal jazz and began an illustrious career in 
the Kansas City music community. Molly soon 
became a fixture of the 18th & Vine jazz 
scene, winning the 2016 Critics’ Choice for 
Best Jazz Singer award from The Pitch, re-
leasing four LPs—one just three months 
ago—and cementing her place as an integral 
stitch in the rich cultural fabric of Jazz’s cra-
dle. 
In 2008, Molly was diagnosed with breast 
cancer, and she beat it. Eight years later, it 
came back, and Molly returned to her battle, 
this time fighting a more aggressive foe but 
with no less determination or spirit. And not 
only did Molly continue to bring joy to her 
community through song during that battle, 
she also became an outspoken advocate for 
cancer research and a powerful voice in bring-
ing awareness to what it means to live life with 
the disease. She called for increased research 
funding and better methods of preventative 
screening, worked with organizations like 
METAvivor and the Susan G. Komen Founda-
tion, and even lobbied Congress. However, 
though her music and her advocacy took her

all over the country and all over the world, 
Molly, I am proud to say, was devoted to Kan-
sas City, and more specifically to the Kansas 
City music community. She supported organi-
zations like GUILDit, which seeks to connect 
the world of music to the world of business to 
help support artists, After all, when Molly was 
diagnosed, she had no health insurance—a 
tragically common phenomenon among inde-
pendent artists. And recently, she chose to do-
nate the proceeds from her albums to the Mid-
west Music Foundation, ensuring that her giv-
ing spirit will continue to touch artists in her 
community for years to come. 
I have always been struck by Molly’s ability 
play any room at all. Molly sang the National 
Anthem at Arrowhead Stadium. Molly sang it 
at Kauffman Stadium. Molly sang at the 
Kauffman Center. Molly sang at the Folly The-
ater. And yet, even when her fight with cancer 
was at its most painful ebb, Molly got out 
every single weekend and brought her voice 
and her presence to local jazz clubs and Unity 
churches throughout Kansas City. When the 
pandemic struck, dealing a crushing blow to 
musicians and venues everywhere, Molly sang 
online from her living room. On stage with a 
microphone in hand and a piano to sing be-
side—that’s where Molly felt at home. She 
used to say it was because music fed her 
soul. I so hope Molly knew that her music fed 
our souls as well. 
Today, my heart is with Molly’s family and 
friends, who are coping with a loss no amount 
of preparation could have softened. To Molly’s 
parents, I say this: we are never prepared to 
outlive our children. I hope you take comfort in 
that you were able to see Molly exhibit a resil-
ience that every parent hopes their child will 
have when they send them out into what can 
be an unfair and unforgiving world. Scripture 
tells us, ‘‘Each one should use whatever gift 
he has received to serve others, faithfully ad-
ministering God’s grace in its various forms.’’ 
Molly’s story, to me, is a story of service. 
Molly was given the gift of a singular voice 
and a presence that could light up jazz club, 
a concert hall, or a stadium, and she used it 
to bring joy and music to others. Molly was 
dealt a terrible disease, and she used it to 
bring awareness and comfort to those fighting 
alongside her. Molly administered God’s grace 
in one of its most breathtaking forms, and she 
did so for all of us. 
Jazz is about many things. It is about find-
ing beauty where there is pain. It is about find-
ing freedom where there are shackles. But at 
a musical level, jazz is about setting up rules, 
so they can then be broken. It is about estab-
lishing a rhythm, so that it can be defied. 
Madam Speaker, as I reckon with this loss, I 
take comfort in my belief that Molly has defied 
the unrelenting rhythm of this mortal world and 
taken her place among a choir of angels. 
There is piano somewhere in heaven that has 
been waiting for Molly, and I know that today, 
she is singing beside it. 
So, Madam Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring the life and legacy of Molly Hammer. 
Though she may never return to the stages 
where we’ve seen her before, today Molly 
joins a pantheon of jazz greats whose music 
echoes through time. Artists never really die, 
and I woke up this morning with Molly’s music 
in my head. ‘‘So let me fly out of this world,’’ 
she would often sing at the end of her con-
certs, ‘‘And spend the next eternity or two / 
with you.’’ 
HONORING JOSEPH A. MYERS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, with my colleague Congressman MIKE 
THOMPSON, in memory of Joseph A. Myers, 
who passed away on December 29, 2020. 
Born January 16, 1940 in Cloverdale, Mr. 
Myers was a native Pomo Indian. He began 
his career as a law enforcement officer and 
was the first known California Indian to serve 
in the California Highway Patrol. He earned 
both his undergraduate degree and Juris Doc-
tor from UC Berkley. 
Mr. Myers became a revered leader in the 
Native American community and developed a 
reputation for working effectively to preserve 
Native American history through education 
and activism. He served as the Associate Di-
rector of the American Indian Lawyer Training 
Program where he mentored advocates on 
tribal law, and notably joined a lawsuit against 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs that successfully 
reversed the termination of 17 Rancheria com-
munities in California. Mr. Myers later founded 
the National Indian Justice Center to help 
tribes strengthen governance capacity and im-
prove the quality of life in Indian country. He 
was also a founding board member of the 
California Indian Museum and Cultural Center. 
Mr. Myers shared his knowledge of Native 
American issues at UC Berkley as a professor 
in the ethnic studies department. The Univer-
sity named the Joseph A. Myers Center for 
Research on Native American Issues as a trib-
ute to Mr. Myers contributions to the commu-
nity including the Native American students on 
campus. 
Along with his hard work ethic and commit-
ment to making a positive difference for oth-
ers, Mr. Myers was known for his good sense 
of humor, compassion and wit. Although he is 
already greatly missed, there is no doubt his 
legacy will continue to be an inspiration for 
many. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join Congressman MIKE THOMPSON and me in 
expressing deep gratitude for Mr. Myers and 
his many years of selfless service to the Na-
tive American community and the entire North 
Coast, and in extending condolences to his 
family and many friends.

HONORING KELLY WALTERS 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Kelly Brice Walters of Christiansburg, 
Virginia, who passed away on December 26, 
2020 at the age of 84. Mr. Walters was a first 
responder who committed his life to providing 
and improving emergency services in the New 
River Valley. 
Kelly Walters was born on September 16, 
1936 in Rogers, Virginia, to Vada McGuire 
and George M. Walters Jr. He began his ca-
reer as a first responder in 1964 with the 
Christiansburg Lifesaving and First Aid Crew. 
In this organization, later the Christiansburg 
Rescue Squad, he served as Captain, First 
Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant, Treasurer, and 
President of the Board of Directors. He helped 
launch rescue squads in Floyd County and 
Riner in Montgomery County. In the Virginia 
Association of Volunteer Rescue Squads, he 
served as the District 7 Vice President twice 
and ultimately as President and was also hon-
ored in its Hall of Fame. 
Colleagues and community members re-
member Mr. Walters for his kindness and 
dedication to the emergency services. They 
told the Roanoke Times about his willingness 
to help coworkers with bills without expecting 
repayment or to pay for EMT certifications for 
others before the state reimbursed such ex-
penses. Many colleagues looked upon him as 
a mentor. 
In 
addition 
to 
his 
work 
with 
the 
Christiansburg Rescue Squad, Mr. Walters 
worked earlier life at the Blue Ridge Overall 
Factory, Cromer Furniture, and as caretaker of 
the Cemetery Corporation. He also served for 
eighteen years as Montgomery County’s Ani-
mal Control Officer. Apart from these respon-
sibilities, 
he 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Christiansburg Hunting Club, which he served 
as President and as a member of the Board 
of Directors. 
Mr. Walters was preceded in death by his 
wife, Virginia Gerald Walters. He is survived 
by his daughter Nancy; grandson Bradley 
Hutchenson; 
great-grandchildren 
Elizabeth 
Ann and Halley Jo; sisters Brenda Thomas, 
Shirley Bartlett, and Jean Walters; and sister- 
in-law Jane Akers. I would like to offer my 
condolences to them and the people of 
Christiansburg on the loss of this dedicated 
public servant.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BICYCLE 
COMMUTER ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Bicycle Commuter Act of 
2021. This legislation passed the House last 
session in Section 90436 of the Moving For-
ward Act (H.R. 2, 116th Cong.) and would re-
instate and improve the bicycle commuter tax 
benefit. 
The bicycle is the most efficient form of 
urban transportation ever devised. Cycling re-
duces carbon emissions, provides enormous 
physical and mental health benefits, and is 
one of the most cost-effective modes of trans-
portation available. Communities across the 
country have realized these benefits and sub-
stantially invested in building better bike net-
works and improving facilities for biking to 
work. These investments are one of the rea-
sons that rates of biking to work have in-
creased by more than one-third since 2000. 
Still, however, only 0.51 percent of workers 
biked to work in 2019. 
Despite these impressive developments, 
there is no commuter tax benefit for biking to 
work—like we have for parking and transit. 
First enacted in 2009, the bicycle commuter 
benefit was a tax benefit that employers could 
offer to provide a reimbursement of up to $20/ 
month for expenses relating to bicycle com-
muting expenses. But if an employee elected

to take advantage of the bicycle commuting 
reimbursement, they were not eligible to re-
ceive transit or parking commuter benefits. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act suspended the bi-
cycle 
commuting 
reimbursement 
benefit 
through 2025, taking away a valuable financial 
incentive for people who choose to bike to 
work. 
With more employees choosing to bike to 
work, it is critical that Congress reinstates the 
bicycle commuter benefit and uses this oppor-
tunity to improve the benefit to reflect present- 
day commuting options. The Bicycle Com-
muter Act of 2021 reinstates the bicycle com-
muter benefit and changes the structure of the 
benefit by making it a pre-tax benefit, allowing 
employees to receive a higher benefit amount, 
allowing the benefit to be used with parking 
and transit, and adding bikeshare and electric 
bikes as an eligible expense. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to enact this legisla-
tion and provide Americans with cleaner, more 
efficient ways of commuting to work.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL SEAN D. FOSTER 
HON. JOHN R. CURTIS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Sean D. Fos-
ter on his retirement from the Army. LTC Fos-
ter’s remarkable career spans nearly three 
decades of distinguished service in defense of 
our nation. 
LTC Foster’s career started in the Army Na-
tional Guard, where he enlisted as a Tank 
Crewman. He attended the United States Mili-
tary Academy at West Point and was commis-
sioned as an Infantry Officer upon graduation. 
After serving for five years in the Infantry, in-
cluding a year-long deployment to Iraq, LTC 
Foster attended law school and became a 
Judge Advocate through the Army’s Funded 
Legal Education Program. 
LTC Foster’s career as a Judge Advocate 
has been truly exemplary. He immediately es-
tablished himself as a criminal law expert and 
served in prosecutorial and defense capacities 
to ensure the fair administration of justice. No-
tably, LTC Foster was also selected to serve 
as the lead defense attorney for a general offi-
cer in a historic courtmartial that garnered na-
tional media attention. 
From 2014 to 2016, LTC Foster served in 
the Special Operations Community, deploying 
to Germany and Afghanistan. As the Group 
Judge Advocate for the 10th Special Forces 
Group (Airborne) at Fort Carson, Colorado, 
LTC Foster directly supported the develop-
ment of more than 60 complex special oper-
ations missions in 13 countries. 
LTC Foster was selected to participate in 
the Army’s Congressional Fellowship program 
in 2016. He earned a Master’s degree in Leg-
islative Affairs from George Washington Uni-
versity and worked as a Fellow in the U.S. 
Senate. In 2018, he continued on as a Legis-
lative Counsel in the Army’s Office of the 
Chief, Legislative Liaison, and also served as 
the Chief of the Army’s Congressional Re-
sponse team. As a Legislative Counsel, LTC 
Foster led multiple congressional delegations 
worldwide, and I can personally attest to his 
excellent leadership and communication skills 
from my own experience participating in dele-
gations led by LTC Foster. 
LTC Foster has compiled an outstanding 
record of significant contributions to the Army 
over the past 27 years and has unceasingly 
provided the highest standards of commitment 
to duty. His service to our great country is in-
deed a gift to the American people. I thank 
LTC Foster and wish him and his family the 
very best on this occasion of his retirement.

20TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I ask the en-
tire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring Wikipedia on the 20th anniversary of 
its founding on January 15, 2001. The organi-
zation has developed a flourishing, free, and 
accessible home for the world’s knowledge 
and has become an indispensable part of our 
lives. 
While encyclopedias have long relied on a 
small number of academics and experts to 
write 
and 
update 
information, 
Wikipedia 
leverages a voluntary, community-based ap-
proach that has allowed the product to expand 
to cover an extraordinary array of topics that 
has worldwide scale, well beyond what all pre-
vious encyclopedias could cover, combined. 
To date, Wikipedians have created an aston-
ishing 175 million pages that are visited by 
two billion unique devices per month. 
The world-class team of people . . . em-
ployees 
and 
volunteers 
that 
administer 
Wikipedia, are a major reason why the project 
has been such a success, and I’m proud that 
many of my constituents are part of this group. 
Wikipedia’s success is also due to the fact 
that it is managed by a values-driven nonprofit 
organization, the Wikimedia Foundation. 
Wikipedia is a large part of the reason we 
all have the world’s information at our finger-
tips and it’s a privilege to congratulate 
Wikipedia on celebrating 20 years of informing 
the world.

A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF 
POWER 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
speaker, I was grateful to represent South 
Carolina’s Second Congressional District at 
yesterday’s inauguration of President Joe 
Biden and Vice President KAMALA HARRIS and 
to join my colleagues to witness this historic 
event. 
I appreciate the Capitol Police, National 
Guard, Secret Service, and all law enforce-
ment officers who worked to ensure our secu-
rity and a peaceful transition of power. The 
South Carolina National Army National Guard 
was ably led by Colonel Edward Cloyd includ-
ing Second District Congressional Office Dis-
trict Director 1Lt. Alex Morris. 
Moving forward, it’s time to keep working to-
ward what is best for the country. Americans 
still need a way out of this Wuhan pandemic, 
job growth, and continued support for our men 
and women in uniform. Having traveled with 
Senator Biden on delegations to Iraq and Bel-
gium, I know firsthand he can seek unity. 
Best wishes Congresswoman-Elect Claudia 
Tenney, fighting for a fair election. In conclu-
sion, God Bless our Troops, and we will never 
forget September 11th in the Global War on 
Terrorism.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CIVICS 
LEARNING ACT OF 2021 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Civics Learning Act of 
2021, a bill that aims to promote democratic 
ideals by ensuring that young Americans re-
ceive a strong civics education. 
On January 6, 2021, our country witnessed 
an armed insurrection on this sacred ground. 
This insurrection was fueled by lies and con-
spiracy theories that were allowed to take hold 
in too many minds of our fellow Americans be-
cause they have not come to understand even 
the most basic parameters of our democratic 
republic. Disturbingly, an Annenberg Public 
Policy Center poll conducted in 2018 found 
that only 32 percent of American adults could 
name all three branches of government. In 
2017, only 37 percent of Americans surveyed 
could name any of the rights guaranteed 
under the First Amendment. The failure to es-
tablish an extensive understanding of Amer-
ican democratic principles begins in grade 
school: In 2014, only 23 percent of eighth 
graders performed at or above the proficient 
level on the National Assessment of Edu-
cational Progress civics exam. This lack of 
civic awareness leads to an unstable bedrock 
for our democracy, which requires widespread 
knowledge of American government for it to 
function properly. 
This is why I have introduced the Civics 
Learning Act of 2021, which increases funding 
for innovative and evidence-based civics 
learning and teaching programs, including 
hands-on civic engagement activities, online 
and video game-based learning, service learn-
ing, and participation in student governance. 
Recognizing that most civics programs focus 
on high school teachers and students, this bill 
would ensure funding for elementary, middle, 
and high school programs to create a strong 
foundation for civic knowledge. In addition, this 
bill would prioritize funding for high-need 
schools, underserved populations, and low-ac-
cess areas such as rural or inner-city commu-
nities. With this focus, the bill can inspire the 
participation of marginalized communities and 
better integrate them into American democ-
racy. 
Madam Speaker, it is my sincere hope this 
body will expeditiously pass this measure. 
Doing so will reaffirm America’s commitment 
to civics education, fostering a more informed 
citizenship that will only strengthen our de-
mocracy.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MASONIC 
PALESTINE LODGE NO. 357 F. & 
A. M. OF DETROIT 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the many contributions of one of 
Detroit’s longest-serving fraternal and service 
organizations, Palestine Lodge No. 357 F. & 
A. M. 
Founded January 26, 1881, Detroit’s Pal-
estine Masonic Lodge has operated for one 
hundred forty years. The Palestine Lodge can 
count among its past members many high-pro-
file residents, including James Vernor, origi-
nator of Vernor’s Ginger Ale, a Detroit staple, 
and automotive pioneer Henry Ford. More re-
cently, the Palestine Lodge, in affiliation with 
the Michigan Masons, has helped make sig-
nificant contributions to its charitable founda-
tion to make meaningful impacts on the lives 
of countless Michigan residents. These actions 
are not limited to its scholarship programs for 
students, its bikes for books child literacy in-
centive program, as well as its S.A.Y. Detroit 
tutoring and literacy program. In addition, the 
Palestine Lodge members give countless 
hours of volunteer time on local community ini-
tiatives. 
Please join me in recognizing Detroit’s Pal-
estine Lodge No. 357 F. & A. M.’s many con-
tributions to the residents of Michigan and the 
13th Congressional District over the past one 
hundred forty years.

AYUDA ACT OF 2021 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Assuring You Uniform Dietary As-
sistance (AYUDA) Act, making the Northern 
Mariana Islands part of the national Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
My bill ensures individuals and families in our 
islands who rely on this help to put food on 
the table are treated equitably and receive 
similar levels of assistance available in other 
parts of our nation. 
Inclusion in SNAP for the people I represent 
remains a priority goal for me. I first intro-
duced the AYUDA Act in the 112th Congress. 
And in the years since, a pilot program has 
demonstrated the feasibility of including the 
Northern Marianas in SNAP. Taking this action 
will avoid future disruption in vital food aid. 
And it will relieve the administrative burden on 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to manage 
a one-off, block grant for our islands when 
right next door in the U.S. territory of Guam 
SNAP works perfectly well. 
The current block grant approach to food 
aid for the Northern Marianas continues to re-
duce assistance to those in need compared to 
other 
Americans. 
Because 
the 
arbitrarily 
capped block grant funds do not automatically 
respond to changing economic conditions, 
families in need face the prospect that their 
benefits will be reduced or cut off completely. 
In fact, just last October, the Commonwealth 
government stated it had no choice but to re-
move households from eligibility for the new 
fiscal year due to insufficient funds. Moreover, 
benefits were substantially cut by 25 percent 
on October 1, 2020. 
The time has now come to right the dis-
parity that keeps the majority-minority commu-
nity I represent excluded from this critical safe-
ty net program that has kept millions of Ameri-
cans from going hungry during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
At a time when the Marianas economy con-
tinues to be shut due to the coronavirus crisis, 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill so 
that those in need are not treated differently 
simply because of where they live in America.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SAFE AND 
QUIET SKIES ACT 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, today I am re- 
introducing my Safe and Quiet Skies Act from 
the 116th Congress to ensure that commercial 
air tour flights are adequately regulated to en-
sure in-air and on-ground safety and address 
widespread and accelerating community dis-
ruption. I extend a special thanks to my col-
leagues, Congressmembers NADLER, NEGUSE, 
NORTON, SHERMAN, and SIRES, for co-intro-
ducing this necessary measure. 
In 2019 alone, there were 17 sightseeing 
tour flight and skydiving accidents nationwide 
with 37 tragic deaths from six of those crash-
es. In my Hawaii alone, we saw three dead in 
the crash of a commercial air tour helicopter 
into a residential neighborhood, eleven more 
dead in the crash of a commercial skydiving 
plane, and then seven more dead in a com-
mercial air tour helicopter crash in a remote 
mountain region. Many other areas of the 
country have been equally impacted, espe-
cially those with high commercial usage, more 
dense populations, valuable natural resources, 
significant defense installations and other fac-
tors. 
These tragedies occurred amidst a rapid in-
crease in commercial helicopter and small 
plane overflights including residential, com-
mercial, and industrial neighborhoods, ceme-
teries and memorials, land and marine parks 
and other recreation areas, and sensitive mili-
tary installations. These have disrupted whole 
communities with excessive noise and other 
impacts, destroyed the peace and sanctity of 
special places, increased risk to not only pas-
sengers but those on the ground, and weak-
ened security and management of defense op-
erations. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
currently has virtually exclusive jurisdiction 
over these aircraft operations. Following these 
and other recent tragedies across the country, 
the National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB), which is responsible for investigating 
accidents but not for direct safety regulation, 
strongly recommended to the FAA that safety- 
related regulation of commercial tour heli-
copters and small aircraft skydiving operations 
is generally insufficient. 
Regarding ground disruption and risk, the 
FAA takes the position that its responsibility is 
strictly operational safety and national air-
space efficiency and does not extend to 
ground disruption and other negative impacts. 
As a result, the operators, aside from strict 
takeoff and approach, avoidance of estab-
lished flight paths and other limited cir-
cumstances, are virtually free to fly wherever, 
whenever, and as often as they want. And 
they do, with little to no self-regulation. 
This situation is unacceptable for both safe-
ty and community impact concerns. It is also 
not limited to Hawaii, with growing concerns in 
other areas with high commercial tour usage, 
more dense populations, valuable natural re-
sources, significant defense installations and 
other factors. 
This bill would first require the FAA to imple-
ment the NTSB’s recommended enhanced 
safety regulations. It would also prohibit flights 
over federal property that requires privacy, 
dignity, and respect, to include military installa-
tions, national cemeteries and national parks, 
wildlife refuges and wilderness. It would fur-
ther require the use of standard equipment to 
monitor the location of flights, apply the ‘‘ster-
ile cockpit rule’’ to tour flights (meaning in part 
that the pilot could not also be the tour guide), 
prohibit flights lower than 1,500 feet over ac-
tual ground, and limit decibel levels to those 
commonly applied to operations in residential 
areas. Additionally, the bill would allow states, 
localities, and tribes to impose stricter regula-
tions on tour flights in their jurisdictions with 
required public engagement. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
to pass this bill into law.

IN RECOGNITION OF WILEY DECK 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, today I 
wish to honor a great American and steadfast 
public servant. James Wiley Deck is leaving 
the United States Department of Transpor-
tation (DOT) after having served in critically 
important roles of increasing responsibility 
over the last four years. A polished leader and 
expert communicator, Wiley worked tirelessly 
throughout his time at DOT to keep the public 
safe on our nation’s roadways while helping to 
build the infrastructure needed to accommo-
date the future of American transportation. 
Wiley joined DOT in 2017 as the Director of 
Government Relations for the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). While 
in this role, he served as the principal advisor 
to the FMCSA Administrator with respect to 
legislative affairs, Congressional relations, and 
all policy matters affecting Federal, state and 
local governments, as well as public and pri-
vate interest groups. His innate ability to col-
laborate with a variety of government stake-
holders led to multiple legislative successes— 
including the securing of $100 million in auton-
omous vehicle research and development 
funding for DOT. 
In 2019, Wiley transitioned to the Office of 
the Secretary, where he served as Senior Pol-
icy Advisor to Secretary Elaine L. Chao. In 
that role, he served as the principal strategic 
advisor to the DOT Secretary on issues per-
taining not only to the FMCSA, but to the Na-
tional Highway Transportation Safety Adminis-
tration (NHTSA), Federal Transit Administra-
tion (FTA) and the Office of Drug and Alcohol

Policy and Compliance (ODAPC). He served 
as the Department’s representative on the 
White House COVID–19 Supply Chain Task 
Force and the White House Food Supply 
Chain Policy Coordinating Committee, where 
he helped shape the Federal response to the 
pandemic. He also led the Department’s ef-
forts to create the National Freight Strategic 
Plan to guide strategic Federal initiatives for 
multimodal investments to reduce congestion 
and improve intermodal connectivity. 
In 2020, Secretary Chao asked Wiley to 
lead FMCSA. As Acting Administrator of a 
Federal agency with a $680 million budget 
and nearly 1200 employees, Wiley led the im-
plementation efforts on two significant regu-
latory reform efforts: Hours of Service and the 
Definition of Agricultural Commodities, two 
issues which are of vital importance to my 
Congressional District. More importantly, how-
ever, he diligently worked with Congress to 
secure $30 million in Federal funding for a 
new Large Truck Crash Causal Factors Study. 
The last comprehensive large truck crash cau-
sation study provided the DOT, and safety re-
search community, valuable insight into the 
factors which contribute to crashes involving at 
least one commercial motor vehicle, but the 
data was collected nearly 20 years ago. A 
new updated study—one that accounts for the 
changes in technology, vehicle safety, driver 
behavior and roadway design over the last two 
decades—is sorely needed and will serve as 
Wiley’s lasting legacy in the Department. 
Prior to transitioning to DOT, Wiley served 
for 22 years on the staff of my friend and the 
former Chairman of the House Transportation 
& Infrastructure Committee, Congressman 
John L. Mica of Florida, the last six as his 
Chief of Staff. He is also a proud graduate of 
the University of Central Florida, although I 
would remind the Speaker that the last time 
UCF played my alma mater, Virginia Tech, in 
football was August 31, 2003, and Virginia 
Tech won 49–28. 
Wiley, his wife, Elizabeth, and their two chil-
dren, Emilia and Enslie, live in Stafford, VA. 
Madam Speaker, I am thankful for Wiley’s 
leadership, 
dedication 
to 
public 
service 
throughout his 26-year career in the Federal 
government and his work on issues of vital im-
portance to the economic vibrance of our 
great nation.

INTRODUCTION OF THE 
BIKESHARE TRANSIT ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Bikeshare Transit Act of 2021. 
This legislation passed the House last session 
in Sections 1210 and 2102 of the Moving For-
ward Act (H.R. 2, 116th Cong.) and would 
make bikeshare systems eligible to receive 
funding to enhance related public transpor-
tation service or transit facilities. 
America is in the middle of a bikeshare rev-
olution: 
at 
least 
119 communities have 
bikeshare systems, supporting a network of 
more than 100,000 bikes. In 2019, riders took 
50 million trips on bikeshare systems, and the 
number of trips and systems has grown every 
year since 2010. The COVID–19 pandemic 
has further increased demand for bicycles and 
bikeshare systems as people seek transpor-
tation options. Systems are operating in com-
munities of all sizes from Los Angeles and 
Portland to Topeka and Conway, Arkansas. 
While some existing bikeshare programs re-
ceived federal dollars to develop their sys-
tems, the lack of an established source of fed-
eral financial support has proved an impedi-
ment to many other projects. Since the term 
‘‘bikeshare’’ is not included in federal law or 
described as a form of transit, bikeshare sys-
tems and departments of transportation are 
forced to operate in a gray area, creating chal-
lenges for funding and maintaining bikeshare 
systems. 
This legislation makes bikeshare systems 
eligible to receive funding to enhance related 
public transportation service or transit facilities. 
Federal funding can be used for acquiring or 
replacing bikeshare-related equipment and 
constructing bikeshare facilities. Bikeshare 
systems will also be listed as eligible projects 
under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Qual-
ity 
(CMAQ) 
Improvement 
Program. 
The 
Bikeshare Transit Act will remove significant 
barriers facing new and existing bikeshare 
projects applying for federal funding while un-
derscoring that bikeshare programs drive eco-
nomic development and are an important part 
of bringing choice and adding value to Amer-
ica’s transportation system. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to include this legis-
lation in a long-term surface transportation re-
authorization package.

Texas. 
At the age of 14, while still in middle school, 
Louis learned how to cut hair. Years later, he 
opened Ayala’s Barber Shop on North Main 
Street in the same neighborhood where he 
grew up and where our community went for 
decades to get a good haircut. Since 1945, 
Louis Ayala has kept our community happy 
and looking sharp. Louis Ayala’s hard work 
and spirit is an outstanding example of Amer-
ican ingenuity and perseverance. His commit-
ment to his small business and community 
must be commended and remembered.

‘‘. . . over the last few years, VA was re-

about 90 percent for health care, and among 
our fastest growing population—women—we 
have an 86 percent approval rating. 
‘‘Recent studies show VA measures up to 
the private sector on access and quality. Vet-
erans liked what they saw and started voting 
with their feet. VA completed a record number 
of appointments in fiscal year 2019—59 mil-
lion—the same year the MlSSION Act took ef-
fect. The more Veterans we served, the more 
Veterans trusted us. Trust in VA care hit a 
record high in April 2020. 
‘‘VA achieved what all the experts in Wash-
ington said was impossible by rolling out a 
modernized health record that will make it 
easier than ever for health professionals to ac-
cess Veterans’ medical history.’’

that serves as the economic backbone of my 
district. 
President Harry Truman, born and raised in 
Independence, 
emphatically 
believed 
that 
‘‘America was built on courage, on imagina-
tion, and an unbeatable determination to do 
the job at hand.’’ For one hundred years, the 
Independence Chamber of Commerce has 
given local business leaders the tools to be 
courageous and imaginative, along with the 
determination necessary to succeed. The 
Chamber represents over five hundred busi-
nesses in Independence, each doing their part 
to make a difference in the lives of their 
friends and neighbors. Every year, the Cham-
ber’s incredible staff and Board of Directors 
organize nearly two hundred events, from 
roundtable discussions with burgeoning busi-
ness leaders, to seminars with professionals 
on how to grow new enterprises. These busi-
ness-centered events bolster the economic

mainstays of a proud and historic community. 
However, the Chamber’s extensive catalog of 
events engages with all sorts of communities. 
Its organization and sponsorship of events like 
the annual Halloween parade, a weekly 
Foodie Friday that promotes local restaurants, 
and the SantaCaliGon Days Festival bring joy 
and warm memories to those fortunate 
enough to call Independence home. And as 
the current public health crisis continues to 
pose unprecedented challenges and difficult 
decisions to small businesses, the Independ-
ence Chamber of Commerce has risen to 
meet the moment. It has reimagined how to 
help local businesses and continues to serve 
as a vital resource for those navigating the 
narrow waters between a struggling economy 
and a lethal virus. Additionally, the Chamber’s 
concerted effort to spread awareness about 
various COVID–19 relief funds has been the 
difference, for many family-owned businesses, 
between surviving a difficult year and being 
forced to close. In short, the Chamber’s work 
has ensured that President Truman’s home-
town continues to grow and prosper. 
However, the Chamber’s work extends far 
beyond Independence city limits. Its annual 
lobbying day in Jefferson City and Wash-
ington, D.C. helps promote the policies nec-
essary for robust business growth and eco-
nomic development not only in the great state 
of Missouri, but across the entire country. And 
as this year has placed a renewed and long- 
overdue 
emphasis 
on 
community-owned 
broadband service, affordable quality housing, 
and neighborhood inclusivity, the Chamber 
has been an effective advocate for many of 
the issues that inspired me to run for City 
Council, for Mayor, and then for Congress. 
Through their advocacy, the Chamber has ini-
tiated and supported several infrastructure de-
velopment and neighborhood revitalization 
projects that have benefitted a broad coalition 
of communities. It recognizes that policies that 
are good for hardworking individuals in all 
kinds of communities are also good for busi-
nesses, and I look forward to our continued 
partnership as we support Missouri families. 
But as I mentioned, it is not just the Cham-
ber’s policies, but also its presence, that have 
tangible positive effects on the district I rep-
resent. 
With every educational seminar, a small 
business owner gains an opportunity to inno-
vate and incorporate new ways to grow their 
business. With every networking event, the 
Chamber connects leaders who can collabo-
rate and form symbiotic partnerships that ben-
efit all of us. With every ribbon cutting and 
grand opening ceremony, the Chamber offers 
a business the vital publicity and web of sup-
port needed to grow and succeed. Running a 
business is hard. But for one hundred years, 
the Independence Chamber has made it easi-
er for the aspirational among us to capitalize 
on the same entrepreneurial spirit that made 
the American economy the envy of the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
congratulating the current and former staff 
members who have organized the daily activi-
ties of the Independence Chamber of Com-
merce, as well as all the past and present 
members of the Chamber’s Board of Directors, 
who have served as dutiful stewards of this 
thriving 
organization. 
The 
Independence 
Chamber of Commerce has brought together 
entrepreneurs and served as a stalwart of 
growth and resiliency for the past one hundred 
years. I have no doubt that they will continue 
this important work over the next century and 
beyond.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
KAREN 
MCCARTHY’S 37 YEARS OF SERV-
ICE 
HON. PETER MEIJER 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the career and service of long- 
time Michigan resident, Mrs. Karen McCarthy. 
After 37 years, Mrs. McCarthy begins a 
well-deserved retirement after decades of pub-
lic service to our local communities, and she 
will certainly be missed by the countless West 
Michiganders that she has helped and worked 
alongside over these many years. Mrs. 
McCarthy worked in community affairs for 
Consumers Energy and she most recently 
served as Community Affairs Manager in Kent 
County, based in Grand Rapids. In that role, 
she was responsible for local government and 
community relations, charitable giving, and 
economic development throughout Kent Coun-
ty. 
It is difficult to overstate Mrs. McCarthy’s 
connection to our community. Along with her 
work at Consumers Energy, she has served 
on numerous local committees and spent her 
personal time volunteering with organizations 
dedicated to combatting poverty and empow-
ering women and girls. Her compassionate 
spirit, service to the public, and strong work 
ethic have made her an essential piece of 
West Michigan society. 
Mrs. McCarthy’s passion for serving others 
and dedication to her community have left a 
lasting impact, and we hope that her example 
will inspire younger generations to feel a simi-
lar call to public service. We wish her a joyful 
and peaceful retirement with her family and 
friends, and we remain grateful for her con-
tributions that have improved the lives of so 
many of her fellow West Michiganders. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in commending Mrs. McCarthy 
for her service and her long career helping the 
people of the great state of Michigan.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ALEXIS 
PAULSEN 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Alexis 
Grace (Hauck) Paulsen, the daughter of Toby 
Hauck, President of the Air Traffic Controllers 
Local ZAU and an Illinois resident. 
Alexis Grace (Hauck) Paulsen was born 
September 14, 1992, at Scott AFB, Illinois and 
died Monday, January 18, 2021, in Clare, Illi-
nois, at the age of 28. 
Alexis 
graduated 
from 
Hiawatha 
High 
School in 2011 in Kirkland, IL. Throughout 
high school Alexis participated in volleyball, 
basketball, softball and FFA. She was a mem-
ber of the County Progressors 4–H Club and 
showed livestock at the Boone County Fair. 
After 
graduation, 
she 
took 
classes 
at 
Kishwaukee College. Alexis was a member of 
Hillcrest Covenant Church in DeKalb. 
Alexis enjoyed spending time with her family 
and friends. She loved meeting new people. 
She married Matthew on May 23, 2015. They 
spent their married life in Clare where she 
thrived in maintaining a loving home for her 
husband and sons. Her favorite thing in life 
was being a stay at home mom to her two 
boys. 
Alexis is survived by her husband, Matthew; 
sons, Fredrick and Franklin; parents, Lori 
Jackson and Derrick Lander, Toby and Darla 
Hauck; parents-in-law, Jeff and Lauri Paulsen; 
brother, Dylan (Jasmine) Hauck; brothers-in-

Hauck, Leanna Kacmarek, Betty Paulsen, 
Carol and Terry Dyer, and David and Eena 
Lundberg; and 16 aunts and uncles. Alexis is 
preceded in death by her grandfathers, Mort 
Carrel and Adolph Paulsen. 
My deepest condolences to the Paulsen and 
Hauck families. This is indeed a tragic time, 
but also a time of reflection and hope. I am 
often reminded, ‘‘the pain you feel today is the 
strength you feel tomorrow. For every chal-
lenge encountered, there is opportunity for 
growth and healing.’’ May the Lord give you 
that strength during this time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RONALD 
FRANCIS DWYER 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and remember the life of Ronald 
Francis Dwyer, who passed away on Decem-
ber 24, 2020, at the age of 77 after an eight- 
year battle with cancer. 
Born in Edwards, Illinois in 1943, Ron dis-
played natural gravitation towards community 
and teaching. Ron worked in education for 46 
years as a teacher/counselor, coach, and prin-
cipal for Spalding High School, Limestone 
High School, East Peoria High School, Notre 
Dame High School, Armstrong Oakview Grade 
School in East Peoria, Paul Bolin Grade 
School in East Peoria and Central Junior High 
School in East Peoria. After he retired from 23 
years in public schools and 23 years in private 
schools, Ron began serving for three years as 
a bailiff for the Peoria County Court House. 
Ron spent 21 years as a sports official in bas-
ketball, baseball, and football. Ron is a mem-
ber of the Peoria Sports Officials Hall of 
Fame. 
Ron was a man of deep faith and a member 
of St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Kickapoo, Illi-
nois, where he belonged to Bishop Rosati 
Council of the Knights of Columbus. Ron’s de-
vout service awarded him the PRO Ecclesia 
ET Pontific Medallion from the Diocese of Pe-
oria in 2000, the Peoria Notre Dame Founda-
tion award in 2004, and the Alumni of the 
Year Award in 2017. The religious values and 
foundation of faith instilled through Ron’s 
teachings will continue to strengthen our com-
munity for years to come.

official, husband, father, and grandfather, Ron 
lived his life serving others with honesty, hu-

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
COMMISSION ON THE INSURREC-
TIONIST 
ATTACK 
UPON 
THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the National Commission on 
the Insurrectionist Attack Upon the United 
States Capitol Act, which would create a na-
tional commission to provide a complete ac-
count surrounding the attack on the United 
States Capitol on January 6, 2021, including 
preparedness and response. The commission 
would also present recommendations on how 
to protect our country from future attacks. My 
bill is modeled on the bipartisan legislation 
that created a national commission to inves-
tigate the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001. 
What happened on January 6, 2021, is no 
less grave, no less revealing than what hap-
pened to our country in 2001. In 2001, we re-
alized that we were woefully unprepared for a 
foreign terrorist attack. The bipartisan national 
commission created by Congress conducted 
an unbiased investigation and helped us im-
prove 
our 
defenses 
against 
international 
threats. 
Now we are faced with another threat, but 
this one does not come from outside, it comes 
from within. The people who ransacked and 
defaced the U.S. Capitol, the people who 
threatened elected officials trying to fulfill their 
constitutional duty were not foreigners; they 
were Americans. In order to tackle this new in-
ternal threat to our democracy, we must un-
derstand it, and we cannot understand it with-
out investigating how this attack on the U.S. 
Capitol occurred. 
The commission created by my bill would 
draw upon all available evidence and prior in-
vestigations to generate a full and complete 
accounting of the circumstances of the attack 
and the country’s preparedness for and imme-
diate response to the attack. This commission 
must be above the fray of politics to give us 
clear answers on what happened on January 
6th. The American people deserve unbiased 
answers. 
What happened is deeply personal for me 
and for many who live or grew up in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, where the U.S. Capitol is lo-
cated. We all recognize the U.S. Capitol as a 
sacred symbol of democracy, but domestic 
terrorists 
came 
into 
my 
hometown 
and 
wreaked mayhem on our federal governing in-
stitutions. The commission would provide de-
finitive answers to help Congress determine 
policies to ward off such attacks in the future. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill. 
TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF ADOLPH 
FLOYD GONELLA 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and work of a distinguished 
American and a brother-friend, Adolph Floyd 
Gonella, Ph.D., who was born on November 1, 
1933 in San Mateo County, California, and 
passed away on January 4, 2021, at the age 
of 87. Floyd Gonella was the son of Amedeo 
and Margherita Gonella who were immigrants 
from Italy. His father was a farmer who raised 
cabbage and artichokes. Floyd’s family lived 
humbly and he learned from them the value of 
hard work and service to others. He experi-
enced anti-Italian discrimination during World 
War II when they were declared enemy aliens 
and placed under curfew as residents of a 
coastal county. This contributed to his empa-
thy and passion for helping the disadvantaged 
among us. 
Dr. Gonella earned his degree in education 
and several teaching certificates from San 
Francisco State where he was a star football 
player, and he earned a doctorate in edu-
cation at the University of California, Berkeley. 
His distinguished career included service as 
an adjunct professor at Santa Clara University, 
and as Superintendent of the Jefferson Union 
High School District. He went on to be elected 
to three 4-year terms as the San Mateo Coun-
ty Superintendent of Schools and was consid-
ered ‘Mr. Education’ by everyone. 
Dr. Gonella retired as County Super-
intendent of Schools in 2003 and stepped up 
to become Superintendent of East Palo Alto’s 
bankrupt Ravenswood City School District. 
Working with city, school and community lead-
ers he revitalized the district and brought it to 
fiscal and educational health. He then went on 
to the dysfunctional Vallejo City Unified School 
District where he and Superintendent Rick 
Damelio were successful in rescuing the dis-
trict. In addition to assisting poorly performing 
school districts, Dr. Gonella and his wife, Mar-
garet, created the Daly City Youth Health Cen-
ter which has been providing services to low- 
income teens for thirty years. 
Dr. Gonella earned many awards, including 
Coach of the Year in 1962 and the Fred 
Kiesel 
Distinguished 
Service 
Award. 
He 
served on the California Advisory Council on 
School Restructuring and was named Out-
standing Alumnus by the San Francisco State 
Education Department. For three decades he 
served as Team Chair of the Western Asso-
ciation of Schools and Colleges, frequently 
traveling to various Asian countries to accredit 
schools. He also led the Daly City Chamber of 
Commerce in an extensive membership drive. 
Dr. Gonella gave generously of his time and 
considerable talents to the San Mateo County 
Child Care Partnership Council, the Criminal 
Justice Council, the San Mateo County AIDS 
Program Community Advisory Committee, the 
Junior Statesmen Foundation, the First 5 
Commission, and the American Heart Associa-
tion. In 2003, the County Office of Education 
honored him by naming its offices the Floyd 
Gonella Education Center. 
Floyd Gonella was a decades-long friend 
and trusted advisor to me and beloved by my 
entire family. His compassion and care for 
those less privileged were a source of inspira-
tion to all who had the good fortune to know 
him, and his expertise as an educator was un-
paralleled. He will be sorely missed by all who 
knew him, worked with him, and called him 
friend. He leaves his wife, Margaret Taylor; his 
daughter, Michelle Gonella; his son, Michael 
Gonella (Chelsea) and grandsons, Nick and 
Alex; and his son, Stephen. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in expressing our 
condolences to Margaret Taylor and the entire 
Gonella family. Floyd Gonella lived a purpose-
ful life, transforming the lives of countless stu-
dents who he had great faith in. He made our 
community a better place to live in and learn, 
and he strengthened our country with his 
countless contributions.

IN RECOGNITION OF JEAN 
OVERMAN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the exemplary leadership and 
faith-based work of Pastor Jean Overman, 
who has been recognized as the 2021 Pastor 
of the Year for the National Christians in Ac-
tion. 
Pastor Jean Overman has dedicated her en-
tire life’s work to serving the people in her 
community in and around Inkster and Western 
Wayne County in Michigan’s 13th Congres-
sional District. Her drive to serve for the good 
of our communities has had a profound impact 
on the lives of many. In addition to her pas-
toral duties and spiritual work, she serves as 
Executive Director of Operation Refuge, a 
local charitable organization that runs a num-
ber of programs to assist our most under-
served populations. Its Mother’s Pantry pro-
gram affords families emergency food assist-
ance in a grocery store-style setting. And, its 
Camp Inspire, a summer STEM camp, is a 
catalyst to instill confidence in young women 
and inspire them to explore science and tech-
nology studies. 
In short, Pastor Jean Overman is an advo-
cate for social justice, uplifting issues around 
poverty, education, racial justice and more. 
Her work reflects her love of community and 
her passion for creating a better future for our 
families. Her commitment to help those in 
need is unwavering and truly reflective of what 
it means to live like Christ. 
Pastor Jean Overman is a true public serv-
ant, and we are truly grateful for her advocacy 
and her work every day serving the district. 
Please join me in recognition of her out-
standing achievement.

House last session in Section 5401 of the 
Moving Forward Act (H.R. 2, 116th Cong.) and 
builds on the successful Surface Transpor-
tation Systems Funding Alternatives (STSFA) 
program to further enhance national under-
standing and competencies in collecting a 
road user charge. 
Increased vehicle fuel efficiency and a stag-
nant federal gas tax have encouraged in-
creased demand on our transportation system 
without proportionally contributing to nec-
essary maintenance and investment. In just a 
few years, the United States will no longer be 
able to finance our transportation system 
based on gallons of fuel consumed. Surface 
transportation faces significant funding chal-
lenges which have only deepened during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The federal gas tax, un-
changed since 1993, has lost more than 71 
percent of its purchasing power due to infla-
tion and fuel efficiency gains. As a result, Con-
gress has transferred more than $153 billion in 
general fund revenues to prop up the Highway 
Trust Fund since 2008. Without new sources 
of revenue, or increasing existing sources, the 
total Highway Trust Fund shortfall is projected 
to reach nearly $190 billion in the next 10 
years. 
Two national transportation study commis-
sions, authorized in 2005, named a road 
usage charge based on vehicle miles travelled 
(VMT) as the most promising revenue alter-
native to the gas tax and the ‘‘consensus 
choice’’ for the future. Since then, California, 
Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Minnesota, Mis-
souri, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Wash-
ington, and Wyoming have operated or are 
operating pilot projects where drivers are 
charged for miles traveled as part of the 
STSFA program. 
The Road User Charge Advancement Act of 
2021 would reauthorize the STSFA program 
through Fiscal Year 2025, increase the author-
ization amount to $35 million, and reduce the 
state match requirement to incentivize more 
states to participate. The legislation also in-
cludes annual reporting requirements to pro-
vide more frequent knowledge-sharing oppor-
tunities and provides special consideration for 
states that are collecting revenues in their pi-
lots. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to advance this leg-
islation as part of a surface transportation re-
authorization package and provide commu-
nities with longterm funding certainty to meet 
their infrastructure needs.

IN HONOR OF MR. MARK SHIELDS 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Mark Shields, a United States Marine veteran 
and longtime American political commentator 
before the United States House of Represent-
atives. Mr. Shields, a fellow alumnus of the 
University of Notre Dame, has led a fulfilling 
career that embodies a lifetime of journalistic 
integrity and service to the American people. 
Mr. Shields entered the political world in 
1965 when he accepted a position to serve as 
Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire’s legisla-
tive assistant in Washington, DC. From there, 
Mr. Shields continued on his path in politics, 
serving on dozens of local, state, and national 
campaigns throughout the 1960s and 1970s. 
Mr. Shields is perhaps best known for his 
role as a trusted and engaging political com-
mentator featured on programs, including 
PBS’ ‘‘The NewsHour’’ and CNN’s ‘‘Capital 
Gang.’’ For 33 years, up until stepping back 
from his regular duties in December 2020, 
Mark Shields graced the American public with 
his thoughtful and expert political analysis on 
the ‘‘PBS NewsHour’’ program, where he re-
ported on the facts and the news with principle 
and grace. 
Mark Shields’ career continues to serve as 
a symbol for Americans nationwide who strive 
to follow their passions and seek to make a 
difference. Mr. Shields’s regular commentary 
on 
‘‘PBS 
NewsHour’’ 
will 
certainly 
be 
missed—but never forgotten. I wish Mr. 
Shields and his family the best in their future 
endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in extending our sincerest appreciation to 
Mark Shields for his extraordinary contribu-
tions to our society.

DEPARTING ADDRESS OF 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as President Donald Trump left of-
fice, he presented an address the evening be-
fore his departure correctly reviewing his 
achievements. I have had the opportunity to 
see his success firsthand. 
Last January, I was in a bi-partisan delega-
tion to Poland and Israel. In Krakow citizens 
were grateful to President Trump placing 
American troops in Poland deterring Russian 
aggression. At the World Holocaust Forum in 
Jerusalem, citizens were so appreciative of 
President Trump. Previously, I led a House 
delegation for the historic opening in May 14, 
2018, of the American Embassy in Jerusalem 
with President Trump fulfilling Promises Made 
Promises Kept. 
Last February, I accompanied Senator TIM 
SCOTT and his mother, Frances Scott, to his 
hometown of North Charleston on Air Force 
One with President Trump where he high-
lighted his heartfelt success for American fam-
ilies of the lowest unemployment seen ever for 
African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
Americans. 
The Address of January 19, 2021, can be 
cherished by the 62,984,828 Trump sup-
porters in 2016 carrying 86 percent of the na-
tion’s counties, and by the 74,216,722 Trump 
supporters in 2020 resulting in South Carolina 
having the largest Republican majorities in 
140 years. 
‘‘My fellow Americans, four years ago we 
launched a great national effort to rebuild 
our country, to renew its spirit, and to re-
store the allegiance of this government to its 
citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission 
to make America great again for all Ameri-
cans. As I conclude my term as the 45th 
President of the United States, I stand be-
fore you truly proud of what we have 
achieved together. We did what we came here 
to do, and so much more. This week we inau-
gurate a new administration and pray for its 
success in keeping America safe and pros-
perous. We extend our best wishes, and we 
also want them to have luck, a very impor-
tant word. 
‘‘I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of 
the amazing people who made our remark-
able journey possible. First, let me express 
my overwhelming gratitude for the love and 
support 
of 
our 
spectacular 
First 
Lady 
Melania. Let me also share my deepest ap-
preciation to my daughter, lvanka, my son- 
in-law Jared, and to Baron, Don, Eric, Tif-
fany, and Lara. You fill my world with light 
and with joy. I also want to thank Vice 
President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife, 
Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank 
you as well to my chief of staff, Mark Mead-
ows, the dedicated members of the White 
House staff, and the cabinet, and all of the 
incredible people across our administration 
who poured out their heart and soul to fight 
for America. 
‘‘I also want to take a moment to thank a 
truly exceptional group of people, the United 
States Secret Service. My family and I will 
forever be in your debt. My profound grati-
tude as well to everyone in the White House 
military office, the teams of Marine One and 
Air Force One, every member of the armed 
forces, and state and local law enforcement 
all across our country. Most of all, I want to 
thank the American people. To serve as your 
president has been an honor beyond descrip-
tion. Thank you for this extraordinary privi-
lege. And that’s what it is, a great privilege 
and a great honor. We must never forget that 
while Americans will always have our dis-
agreements, we are a nation of incredible, 
decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens 
who all want our country to thrive and flour-
ish and be very, very successful and good. We 
are a truly magnificent nation. 
‘‘All Americans were horrified by the as-
sault on our capital. Political violence is an 
attack on everything we cherish as Ameri-
cans. It can never be tolerated. Now more 
than ever, we must unify around our shared 
values and rise above the partisan rancor 
and forge our common destiny. Four years 
ago, I came to Washington as the only true 
outsider ever to win the presidency. I had 
not spent my career as a politician, but as a 
builder looking at open skylines and imag-
ining infinite possibilities. I ran for presi-
dent because I knew there were towering new 
summits for America just waiting to be 
scaled. I knew the potential for our nation 
was boundless as long as we put America 
first. So I left behind my former life and 
stepped into a very difficult arena, but an 
arena, nevertheless, with all sorts of poten-
tial if properly done. 
‘‘America had given me so much and I 
wanted to give something back. Together 
with millions of hardworking Patriots across 
this land, we built the greatest political 
movement in the history of our country. We 
also built the greatest economy in the his-
tory of the world. It was about America first 
because we all wanted to make America 
great again. We restored the principle that a 
nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agen-
da was not about right or left. It wasn’t 
about Republican or Democrat, but about 
the good of a nation, and that means the 
whole nation. With the support and prayers 
of the American people, we achieved more 
than 
anyone 
thought 
possible. 
Nobody 
thought we could even come close. We passed 
the largest package of tax cuts and reforms 
in American history. We slashed more job- 
killing regulations than any administration 
had ever done before. 
‘‘We fix our broken trade deals, withdrew 
from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership 
and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, re-
negotiated the one-sided South Korea deal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E61 
January 21, 2021 
And 
we 
replaced 
NAFTA 
with 
the 
groundbreaking USMCA, that’s Mexico and 
Canada, a deal that’s worked out very, very 
well. Also and very importantly, we imposed 
historic and monumental tariffs on China, 
made a great new deal with China. But be-
fore the ink was even dry, we and the whole 
world got hit with the China virus. 
‘‘Our trade relationship was rapidly chang-
ing. Billions and billions of dollars were 
pouring into the US but the virus forced us 
to go in a different direction. The whole 
world suffered, but America outperformed 
other countries economically because of our 
incredible economy and the economy that we 
built. Without the foundations and footings, 
it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We 
wouldn’t have some of the best numbers 
we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy 
resources and became the world’s number 
one producer of oil and natural gas by far. 
Powered by these policies, we built the 
greatest economy in the history of the 
world. We reignited America’s job creation 
and achieved record-low unemployment for 
African 
Americans, 
Hispanic 
Americans, 
Asian Americans, women, almost everyone. 
Income soared, wages boomed. The American 
dream was restored and millions were lifted 
from poverty in just a few short years. It was 
a miracle. 
‘‘The stock market set one record after an-
other, with 148 stock market highs during 
the short period of time, and boosted the re-
tirements and pensions of hardworking citi-
zens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a 
level they’ve never been at before. We’ve 
never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and 
that’s before the pandemic and after the pan-
demic. We rebuilt the American manufac-
turing base, opened up thousands of new fac-
tories, and brought back the beautiful phrase 
Made in the USA. To make life better for 
working families, we doubled the child tax 
credit and signed the largest-ever expansion 
of funding for childcare and development. We 
joined with the private sector to secure com-
mitments to train more than 16 million 
American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. 
‘‘When our nation was hit with the terrible 
pandemic, we produced not one, but two vac-
cines with record-breaking speed and more 
will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be 
done, but we did it. They called it a medical 
miracle. And that’s what they’re calling it 
right now, a medical miracle. Another ad-
ministration would have taken three, four, 
five, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a 
vaccine. We did it in nine months. We grieve 
for every life lost and we pledge in their 
memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic 
once and for all. 
‘‘When the virus took its brutal toll on the 
world’s economy, we launched the fastest 
economic recovery our country has ever 
seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in eco-
nomic relief, saved or supported over 50 mil-
lion jobs, and slashed the unemployment 
rate in half. These are numbers that our 
country has never seen before. We created 
choice and transparency in healthcare, stood 
up to big pharma in so many ways, but espe-
cially in our effort to get favored nations 
clauses added, which will give us the lowest 
prescription drug prices anywhere in the 
world. We passed VA Choice, VA Account-
ability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal 
justice reform. 
‘‘We confirmed three new justices of the 
United States Supreme Court. We appointed 
nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our 
Constitution as written. For years, the 
American people pleaded with Washington to 
finally secure the nation’s borders. I am 
pleased to say, we answered that plea and 
achieved the most secure border in US his-
tory. We have given our brave border agents 
and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to 
do their jobs better than they have ever done 
before and to enforce our laws and keep 
America safe. We proudly leave the next ad-
ministration with the strongest and most ro-
bust border security measures ever put into 
place. This includes historic agreements 
with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of 
powerful new wall. 
‘‘We restored American strength at home 
and American leadership abroad. The world 
respects us again. Please don’t lose that re-
spect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by 
standing up for America at the United Na-
tions and withdrawing from the one-sided 
global deals that never served our interests. 
And NATO countries are now paying hun-
dreds of billions of dollars more than when I 
arrived just a few years ago. It was very un-
fair. We were paying the cost for the world. 
Now the world is helping us. 
‘‘And perhaps most importantly of all, 
with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the 
American military, all made in the USA. We 
launched the first new branch of the United 
States Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space 
Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida and watched as 
American astronauts returned to space on 
American rockets for the first time in many, 
many years. 
‘‘We revitalize our alliances and rallied the 
nations of the world to stand up to China 
like never before. We obliterated the ISIS ca-
liphate and ended the wretched life of its 
founder and leader alBaghdadi. We stood up 
to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed 
the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher, 
Qassem Soleimani. We recognize Jerusalem 
as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli 
sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a re-
sult of our bold diplomacy and principled re-
alism, we achieved a series of historic peace 
deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it 
could happen. The Abraham Accords opened 
the doors to a future of peace and harmony, 
not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of 
a new Middle East, and we are bringing our 
soldiers home. I am especially proud to be 
the first president in decades who has start-
ed no new wars. 
‘‘Above all, we have reasserted the sacred 
idea that in America the government an-
swers to the people. Our guiding light, our 
North star, our unwavering conviction has 
been that we are here to serve the noble ev-
eryday citizens of America. Our allegiance is 
not to the special interests corporations or 
global entities, it’s to our children, our citi-
zens, and to our nation itself. As president 
my top priority, my constant concern has al-
ways been the best interests of American 
workers and American families. I did not 
seek the easiest course. By far, it was actu-
ally the most difficult. I did not seek the 
path that would get the least criticism. I 
took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, 
the most difficult choices because that’s 
what you elected me to do. Your needs were 
my first and last unyielding focus. This, I 
hope, will be our greatest legacy. 
‘‘Together, we put the American people 
back in charge of our country. We restored 
self-government. We restored the idea that 
in America no one is forgotten because ev-
eryone matters and everyone has a voice. We 
fought for the principle that every citizen is 
entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, 
and equal rights because we are all made 
equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be 
treated with respect, to have their voice 
heard, and to have the government listen. 
You are loyal to your country and my ad-
ministration was always loyal to you. 
‘‘We worked to build a country in which 
every citizen could find a great job and sup-
port their wonderful families. We fought for 
the communities where every American 
could be safe and schools where every child 
could learn. We promoted a culture where 
our laws would be upheld, our heroes hon-
ored, our history preserved, and law-abiding 
citizens are never taken for granted. Ameri-
cans should take tremendous satisfaction in 
all that we have achieved together. It’s in-
credible. 
‘‘Now, as I leave the white house, I have 
been reflecting on the dangers that threaten 
the priceless inheritance we all share. As the 
world’s most powerful nation, America faces 
constant threats and challenges from abroad. 
But the greatest danger we face is a loss of 
confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence 
in our national greatness. A nation is only as 
strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic 
as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the 
faith that beats in the hearts of our people. 
No nation can long thrive that loses faith in 
its own values, history, and heroes for these 
are the very sources of our unity and our vi-
tality. 
‘‘What has always allowed America to pre-
vail and triumph over the great challenges of 
the 
past 
has 
been 
an 
unyielding 
and 
unashamed conviction in the nobility of our 
country and its unique purpose in history. 
We must never lose this conviction. We must 
never forsake our belief in America. The key 
to national greatness lies in sustaining and 
instilling our shared national identity. That 
means focusing on what we have in common, 
the heritage that we all share. At the center 
of this heritage is also a robust belief in free 
expression, free speech, and open debate. 
Only if we forget who we are and how we got 
here could we ever allow political censorship 
and blacklisting to take place in America. 
It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free 
and open debate violates our core values and 
most enduring traditions. 
‘‘In America, we don’t insist on absolute 
conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and 
punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. 
America is not a timid nation of tame souls 
who need to be sheltered and protected from 
those with whom we disagree. That’s not 
who we are. It will never be who we are. For 
nearly 250 years in the face of every chal-
lenge, Americans have always summoned our 
unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce 
independence. These are the miraculous 
traits that once led millions of everyday citi-
zens to set out across a wild continent and 
carve out a new life in the great West. It was 
the same profound love of our God-given 
freedom that willed our soldiers into battle 
and our astronauts into space. 
‘‘As I think back on the past four years, 
one image rises in my mind above all others. 
Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade 
route, there were thousands and thousands of 
people. They came out with their families so 
that they could stand as we passed and 
proudly wave our great American flag. It 
never failed to deeply move me. I knew that 
they did not just come out to show their sup-
port of me. They came out to show me their 
support and love for our country. This is a 
republic of proud citizens who are united by 
our common conviction, that America is the 
greatest nation in all of history. 
‘‘We are and must always be a land of hope, 
of light, and of glory to all the world. This is 
the precious inheritance that we must safe-
guard at every single turn. For the past four 
years, I have worked to do just that. From a 
great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a 
great square of Polish people in Warsaw, 
from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the 
podium at the United Nations General As-
sembly, and from the forbidden city in Bei-
jing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I 
fought for you. I fought for your family. I 
fought for our country. Above all, I fought 
for America and all it stands for, and that is 
safe, strong, proud, and free.

‘‘Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a 
new administration at noon on Wednesday, I 
want you to know that the movement we 
started is only just beginning. There’s never 
been anything like it. The belief that a na-
tion must serve its citizens will not dwindle, 
but instead, only grows stronger by the day. 
As long as the American people hold in their 
hearts, deep and devoted love of country, 
then there is nothing that this nation can 
not achieve. Our communities will flourish. 
Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions 
will be cherished. Our faith will be strong 
and our future will be brighter than ever be-
fore. I go from this majestic place with a 
loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, 
and a supreme confidence that for our coun-
try and for our children, the best is yet to 
come. Thank you and farewell. God bless 
you. God bless the United States of Amer-
ica.’’ 
RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF 
MELISSA KIEDROWICZ ELLISON 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a trusted advisor, Melissa 
Kiedrowicz Ellison, who has been an invalu-
able member of my team for more than a dec-
ade. Melissa first joined my staff as an intern 
in the 111th Congress and has served the 
people of the district I represent as a Legisla-
tive Correspondent, Legislative Assistant, Leg-
islative Director, and as my Deputy Chief of 
Staff. Melissa has always been a steady hand, 
helping me carry out my duties as a member 
of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, 
Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, 
and as Vice Chair of the House Democratic 
Caucus during the 115th Congress. 
Melissa has been by my side through count-
less hours of markups and hearings on difficult 
issues before the Committee on Ways and 
Means. Her grace under pressure, expertise, 
and leadership have been extraordinary as-
sets in guiding my legislative efforts to combat 
the COVID–19 pandemic and help working 
families recover from the greatest challenge 
we have faced in generations. Melissa always 
strived to make a meaningful difference in the 
lives of the constituents we serve, and she en-
sured Team Sa´nchez worked with common 
purpose in the halls of Congress and in the 
38th District to do so. Thanks to Melissa’s te-
nacity, I was proud to secure passage of 13 
bills through the U.S. House of Representa-
tives on her watch. 
Melissa is known for her witty sense of 
humor, unfailing loyalty, and an appreciation 
for all things Disney. 
I am so proud that Melissa will be bringing 
that magic to the Ways and Means Committee 
as the new Director of Outreach and Member 
Services. Her rich knowledge of the Com-
mittee will be a boon to Chairman NEAL and 
all of our members as we redouble our efforts 
to defeat the COVID–19 pandemic and rebuild 
an economy that benefits all working families. 
Though Melissa is leaving my office, I am so 
glad she is remaining in the Ways and Means 
Committee family and she will forever be a 
valued family member of Team Sa´nchez. I 
cannot wait to see all her future accomplish-
ments as her career unfolds.
