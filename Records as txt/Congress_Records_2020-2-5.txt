Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2020 
No. 24 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
February 5, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

TELEHEALTH INCREASES ACCESS 
TO CARE FOR MONTANANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, many 
Montanans live in frontier and rural 
areas where access to doctors and spe-
cialists is a big challenge. They don’t 
worry about when they can see a doc-
tor; they worry if there is even a doc-
tor to see. 
For Montana seniors with mobility 
issues, getting out to see a doctor can 
be difficult and can delay their care 
leading to worse health outcomes. 
Montana, unfortunately, also has the 
highest suicide rate in the Nation. 
Thousands of Montanans lack adequate 
access to mental healthcare. 
Telehealth can fix these problems. 
Telehealth increases access to care, 
brings down healthcare costs, and, in 
some cases, saves lives. 
Unfortunately, 
Federal 
telehealth 
programs have been poorly managed. 
Currently, 10 different Federal agencies 
operate telehealth programs with little 
or no coordination between them. 
That is why Chairwoman ESHOO and I 
have worked for months on ways to im-
prove and increase telehealth services. 
I appreciate her leadership on this im-
portant issue. 
Today, we introduce the National 
Telehealth Strategy and Data Ad-
vancement Act. Our bill reauthorizes 
telehealth grant programs, provides 
greater oversight of Federal agencies, 
and helps implement telehealth pro-
grams across the country. 
Using modern technology to make 
healthcare more accessible is a com-
monsense solution. It will particularly 
help us with our rural doctor shortage 
in Montana. 
This bill will ensure that patients 
can have access to doctors and special-
ists in a way that is convenient for 
them. 
I look forward to working on this bi-
partisan bill. It is a critical step as we 
ensure 
all 
Americans, 
particularly 
those in our rural and frontier areas, 
have 
access 
to 
better, 
affordable 
healthcare.

GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, last 
night in this Chamber, we heard a 
bloviating, self-congratulatory speech 
full of exaggerations, half-truths, and 
outright falsehoods. The President pre-
tended to have addressed, or was going 
to address, concerns of the American 
people. 
He said he is taking care of prescrip-
tion drugs. Yeah. Really. They haven’t 
done a damn thing. We sent a bill to 
the Senate and it is sitting there. 
Second, he said, oh, we are going to 
protect preexisting conditions. Funny 
thing, his Attorney General is in court 
arguing that those preexisting condi-
tions should no longer be protected. 
But, hey, what the heck. 
And then he did devote one sen-
tence—one sentence—to infrastructure. 
What happened to the $2 trillion plan 
he campaigned on and carries on about 
all the time? Well, so far, he has only 
proposed cuts. 
But one issue of vital concern to the 
American people that is the focus this 
week—this is National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week—did not receive a sin-
gle mention by the President, despite 
the fact that several commonsense bi-
partisan reforms and programs have 
passed this House and have received no 
action in the Senate in a year. 
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Comprehensive 
Background Checks Act, passed on 
February 27. No action in the Senate. 
The Enhanced Background Checks 
Act passed February 28—bipartisan. 
Again, no action in the Senate. 
Every year, guns are sold to people 
who aren’t supposed to have them—in-
cluding at that horrible church shoot-
ing a couple of years ago—because of a 
mandate that, if there is confusion 
over a background check, they have to 
get the gun within 3 days. 
Over the last 10 years, 35,000 guns, be-
cause of that provision, were sold to 
people who were not qualified under 
Federal law to have the guns. And 
guess what. Then the Feds contact the 
FBI who screwed up the background 
check, contacts the local law enforce-
ment and says, ‘‘Hey, go get the gun

from that felon,’’ endangering our local 
law enforcement. 
This would plug that loophole. 
The Violence Against Women Act Re-
authorization passed April 4. No action 
in the Senate. And, for the first time in 
20 years, we are going to do some re-
search on gun violence. There are other 
bills we should be doing. 
In my State, we have adopted red 
flag laws. And over here, they say, 
well, we can’t have red flag laws for 
abusers because of their constitutional 
rights. 
Well, we have set it up in a way that 
we have had 160 petitions for red flag 
restrictions. Most of them—actually, 
the majority—were for people at risk of 
suicide; and then a minority were for 
abusive relationships, and 32 of those 
were denied by a judge. 
Due process was followed, but lives 
were saved. But, no, we can’t take that. 
Bump stocks, we banned fully auto-
matic weapons decades ago. Bump 
stocks, essentially, turn a semiauto-
matic into a very inaccurate, nearly 
full automatic in terms of ready to 
fire. But if you are shooting at a sta-
dium full of people, it doesn’t matter 
how inaccurate it is; you are going to 
hit a lot of people. 
We can’t even bring up legislation— 
or, well, the Republicans won’t support 
legislation to ban bump stocks, hate 
crimes legislation, the list goes on. 
Just one other quick issue. You can 
go online to armslist.com, and if you 
are not eligible to buy a gun, you can 
get one. It is very evident that, in 
study after study done, that many of 
the people selling guns on armslist.com 
are felons and not allowed to own fire-
arms, and they will sell to other felons. 
It will say: No background check nec-
essary. Will cross State lines—all sorts 
of things like that. 
All those things need to be banned. 
Those are commonsense gun violence 
reforms. 
And, in this week, just, really, this 
week, National Gun Violence Survivors 
Week, let’s do something to end the 
bloodshed.

RECOGNIZING THE KANSAS CITY 
CHIEFS, 
SUPER 
BOWL 
CHAM-
PIONS, AND BOB DOLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, much 
like America’s great comeback that 
President Trump described at his State 
of the Union message last night, this 
past Sunday, my team, the Kansas City 
Chiefs, had a miracle comeback victory 
in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl 
LIV. 
After 50 years, the Chiefs are once 
again Super Bowl champions. As a 
born-and-raised Chiefs fan, watching 
them win the title was a dream come 
true. 
Of course, we all saw the game, but 
just before it started something hap-
pened that you may have missed. Dur-
ing the singing of the national anthem, 
just past the end zone, my mentor and 
friend, 96-year-old Senator Bob Dole, 
who was seriously wounded during his 
service in World War II, insisted on 
standing up out of his wheelchair dur-
ing the performance. And with a little 
help, that is exactly what he did. 
In an age when people can’t even 
agree in honoring our flag, it is power-
ful to see one of our Nation’s greatest 
heroes from our Greatest Generation 
continue to show us the way. 
Thank you, Senator Dole, for your 
patriotism and love of country. 
And congratulations to my Super 
Bowl 
champions, 
the 
Kansas 
City 
Chiefs. 
CHAOS AT THE IOWA CAUCUS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, we all saw the Iowa caucus 
and the chaos that Democrats are of-
fering—chaos, along with higher taxes 
and Medicare for all that takes away 
the insurance that you get at your job. 
As Senate Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL said yesterday, these same Demo-
crats who want to take over everyone’s 
healthcare and micromanage the entire 
economy couldn’t even organize their 
own traditional Iowa caucuses. 
Contrast this to last night at the 
State of the Union message when 
President Trump talked about the 
strongest economy of our lifetimes, in-
cluding record job and wage growth. 
We saw how the President wants to 
bring us together to deliver even more 
results, more trade deals for Kansas, 
and a safer, more secure America. You 
can count on me that I will be standing 
beside him to help deliver those re-
sults. 
The Democrats offer chaos, higher 
taxes, and poverty. President Trump 
and the Republicans offer prosperity, 
hope, and security. 
CREATING A PROGRAM WITHIN THE VA TO GIVE 
VETERANS ACCESS TO SERVICE DOGS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, to-
night the House will vote to pass the 
PAWS 
for 
Veterans 
Therapy 
Act, 
which will create a program within the 
VA to give veterans access to treat-
ment by working with service dogs. 
Midwest Battle Buddies is an organi-
zation based in Kansas that works with 
veterans who are suffering from PTSD 
or other service-related issues. The vet-
erans are paired with a dog and attend 
weekly sessions to train the dogs. Once 
the training is completed, the dogs be-
come their service dogs. 
According to Chip Neumann, presi-
dent of the organization, therapy dogs 
provide veterans unconditional love. 
They do not judge their owners when 
they have breakdowns from stress or 
external triggers and can react and in-
tervene if the veteran is having an epi-
sode and can often prevent them from 
spiraling out of control. 
There is just something wonderful 
about dogs, as we all know. 
The training sessions also act as mini 
therapy sessions, as veterans realize 
they are with others dealing with the 
same issues. 
Midwest Battle Buddies has seen the 
possible impact service dog therapy 
can have for our cherished veterans. 
I look forward to passing the PAWS 
for Veterans Therapy Act to extend ac-
cess to service dog therapy throughout 
the VA, to provide the best treatment 
for America’s veterans. 
f 
HONORING GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS’ WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Gun Violence Survivors Week 
because I, too, am a survivor. 
This week, just a month into the new 
year, there will have been more gun 
deaths in the United States than our 
peer countries will experience in an en-
tire year—one month. 
I wear black today. I wear black all 
week long to stand for every survivor, 
every victim, every family that mourns 
the unnecessary gun deaths that hap-
pen each and every single day. 
I met earlier this week with Mary 
Miller-Strobel, whose brother, Ben, was 
a combat veteran suffering from de-
pression and PTSD. Ben had lost 30 
pounds after his tour. Returning home, 
his father asked him about his weight 
loss. Ben replied that he couldn’t eat, 
and he said: ‘‘It’s just so hard out 
there, Dad. It smells like death.’’ 
Ben was seeking treatment at a local 
VA hospital, but his family continued 
to worry about him. They worried that, 
in a moment of desperation, Ben might 
end his own life. 
Mary and her father drove to every 
gun store in their area. At each store, 
they showed photos of Ben, pleading 
with them not to sell him a gun. 
Ben Miller died by suicide. He used a 
gun that he bought at a local gun 
store. 
Too often we are told that we must 
accept these tragedies. We are told 
that, instead of changing our laws, we 
must have more active shooter drills, 
more first graders coming home with 
tears in their eyes, 6-year-olds asked to 
decide for themselves whether they are 
more likely to survive by hiding in a 
closet or if they should rush the gun-
man; more mothers reading messages 
from their children as they are locked 
inside a school and they are pleading: 
Mom, if I don’t make it, I love you, and 
I appreciate everything that you have 
done for me; more vigils each and every 
day for those that we continue to lose. 
Too often, we are told that we must 
accept these tragedies. I refuse to ac-
cept that. Millions of Americans across 
the country refuse to accept that. This 
Congress should refuse to accept that. 
We refuse to accept that, because we 
have passed bipartisan legislation that 
will help save lives, legislation like the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act, a 
commonsense bill that will keep guns 
away from those who should not have 
them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H769 
February 5, 2020 
b 1015 
We have passed H.R. 1112, the En-
hanced Background Checks Act of 2019, 
which would close the Charleston loop-
hole. 
We have passed a bill that gives the 
CDC and the NIH $25 million to study 
gun violence, the first of its kind in 
over 20 years. 
I have even introduced a bill that 
would give loved ones and law enforce-
ment more tools to keep guns away 
from those who are a danger to them-
selves or to others; tools that may 
have helped Mary save her brother, 
Ben’s life. 
With every unnecessary shooting, we 
continue to feel the weight of this in-
justice; and I personally know that 
sense of injustice. 
When my son, Jordan, was killed, I 
found myself asking America, how 
could you allow this to happen to my 
child, my family, to my Jordan? And 
after Parkland, I knew that this coun-
try needed to stand up and to do some-
thing about it. 
I knew that I had something that I 
had to do, and I knew that I needed to 
stand up for families like mine in Mari-
etta, Georgia, who are terrified that 
their children will not come home from 
school, and they are terrified of being 
me. 
So I made a promise to my commu-
nity that I would act. And I promised 
that I would take all the love and the 
support and protection that I had given 
to my child and use it to serve the 
American people. I promised I would 
always be a mother on a mission to 
save the lives of children from across 
America, children like my son. 
During this Gun Violence Survivors 
Week, I pray that we all remember 
that this is in our hands. Families like 
Mary’s, children graduating from high 
school, communities in Charleston, in 
Columbine, in Parkland, in Sandy 
Hook, in Dayton, in El Paso, in Las 
Vegas, in the hundreds of places where 
shooters and shootings don’t even 
make the news. Their lives are in our 
hands. 
I thank my colleagues, and survivors, 
and volunteers, and advocates across 
this country for their tireless work to 
protect our families. 
May God bless us all in this fight to 
save American lives. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF OFFICER ALAN MCCOLLUM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor and 
to mourn the loss of one of Corpus 
Christi Police Department’s finest, Of-
ficer Alan McCollum, who was trag-
ically killed in the line of duty. 
President Ronald Reagan once said: 
‘‘There can be no more noble vocation 
than the protection of one’s fellow citi-
zens.’’ 
Officer McCollum was a compas-
sionate, devoted, and admired public 
servant who dutifully worked to keep 
south Texas safe. 
Before serving as a police officer, Of-
ficer McCollum served 21 years in the 
U.S. Army, earning the Bronze Star 
and numerous other accolades. Fol-
lowing the Army, his service to others 
continued by joining the Corpus Christi 
Police Department in 2013, where he 
was a valued member of the Honor 
Guard and SWAT team. 
Last 
year, 
he 
once 
again 
dem-
onstrated his willingness to sacrifice 
his own safety for others by helping 
push an overturned car back on its 
wheels after it had caught fire, saving 
the life of the driver. 
On Saturday, Officer McCollum paid 
the ultimate price, sacrificing himself, 
while upholding the rule of law. 
Scripture tells us that the Lord is 
near to the brokenhearted and those 
who are crushed in spirit. Right now, 
so many of us, in Texas, the Corpus 
Christi Police Department, and the 
family of Officer McCollum, are bro-
kenhearted. 
Our prayers are that his family and 
friends touched by this tragedy, and es-
pecially his wife of 12 years, Michelle, 
and 
his 
three 
daughters, 
Hannah, 
Carissa, and Liliana, would feel the 
Lord near them during this difficult 
time. I extend my deepest condolences 
to them during this extremely difficult 
time. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF OFFICER MICHAEL 
LOVE 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, this week, 
I had the opportunity to visit Corpus 
Christi Police Officer Michael Love in 
the hospital as he recovers from inju-
ries he sustained in the line of duty. 
Over the weekend, he was conducting 
a routine traffic stop when his patrol 
vehicle was struck, pinning him down. 
I had heard from many of his fellow 
officers of his optimistic and indomi-
table spirit, which I had the oppor-
tunity to witness firsthand when I vis-
ited him and his wife, Lauren, in the 
hospital. He told me that, despite ev-
erything he is going through, even 
knowing the months of recovery that 
lie ahead, he would still sign up to 
serve our community as a Corpus 
Christi police officer. 
We cannot express our gratitude 
enough for his sacrifice and his brav-
ery. 
We must continue to pray for the 
safety of all our first responders, and 
support them as they protect us, as 
well as their families, who they hug a 
little bit tighter every day as they face 
the dangers that lie ahead. 
We are thankful for the loving, brave, 
and patriotic man that is Officer Mi-
chael Love, and for those who serve 
with him. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN) for 
5 minutes. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, let me say that 
my heart hurts for my colleague and 
my sister, LUCY MCBATH, as she con-
fronts on a daily basis the pain of our 
failure to act on sensible gun safety 
legislation. 
I rise today, as many of my col-
leagues will, almost one year since the 
House took the steps to curb violence 
by passing H.R. 8, a bill that has yet to 
receive any consideration in the Sen-
ate. 
We are in the middle of Gun Violence 
Survivors Week. Yet, despite survivors’ 
calls for action; despite the calls of 
parents and friends who have lost loved 
ones to guns; despite the calls from our 
young people who just want to be safe 
in school; and despite our calls of the 
communities who want to be safe in 
their homes, we have yet to get H.R. 8, 
or any other gun violence bill consid-
ered in the Senate. 
The paralysis around preventing gun 
violence is disgusting, and it is deadly. 
This story line that preventing people 
from buying assault weapons or stock-
piling ammunition is somehow infring-
ing upon their rights is deeply hurtful, 
and it is wrong thinking. 
Including suicides by guns, there 
were 177 deaths on New Year’s Day 
alone. There were three mass shoot-
ings, and the lives lost included three 
children between the ages of 12 and 17. 
That’s just one day, the first day of 
this year. Yet, Republicans in the Sen-
ate continue to refuse to move any bill 
that might keep more families from 
getting that phone call. 
There are so many options available 
to us. There is the baseline, bipartisan 
bill, like, H.R. 8, that we have already 
passed in the House. There are bills 
that would go even further, like my 
own Handgun Licensing and Registra-
tion Act of 2019, and the Stop Online 
Ammunition Sales Act of 2019. 
One would require registration for 
handgun purchases, just like the gov-
ernment 
requires 
registration 
and 
basic standards for voting, operating a 
vehicle, even opening a business. It 
would ensure accountability and allow 
enforcement to identify threats. 
The other places a very basic prin-
ciple into law; that you shouldn’t be 
able to stockpile bullets without ID or 
without law enforcement being aware. 
Mr. Speaker, there are bills that 
would keep guns out of the hands of 
violent criminals, and bills that would 
push us to study gun violence as the 
health crisis it is. So far, none of these 
seem to be good enough for most of my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, or the other side of the Capitol. 
We are approaching a point from 
which we cannot return, where failure 
to act will normalize gun violence in 
our schools, in our neighborhoods, and 
in our society. 
The survivors that we honor today, 
the families of those we have lost, and 
the countless Americans who wonder if 
they might be next deserve so much 
more from us.

I stand here today representing all of 
the loss of the survivors and what they

f 
PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO 
ORGANIZE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
TORRES of California). The Chair recog-
nizes the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, tomor-
row, the House will vote on the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act of 
2019, or the PRO Act. This legislation 
is a liberal wish list that represents a 
draconian overhaul of our Nation’s 
labor laws at the expense of employers, 
workers, and economic growth, while 
strengthening the authoritarian power 
of big labor. 
Madam Speaker, despite the fact that 
the National Labor Relations Board 
and the U.S. Supreme Court have rec-
ognized that there should be ample 
time for ‘‘uninhibited, robust, and 
wide-open debate in labor disputes,’’ 
the PRO Act deliberately speeds up 
election processes so that employees 
don’t have time to learn about the po-
tential downsides of joining a union. 
Specifically, the bill codifies the pro-
visions of an NLRB regulation called 
the ‘‘ambush election rule’’ which sig-
nificantly shortens the time span in 
election 
processes. 
Democrats 
pur-
posely inserted this provision because 
they know union bosses are more like-
ly to win elections when employees are 
uninformed about the downsides of 
union membership. 
Second, the PRO Act increases liabil-
ity for businesses by dramatically ex-
panding the definition of ‘‘joint em-
ployer’’ to also include indirect control 
and unexercised potential control over 
employees. These terms are incredibly 
broad and ambiguous, meaning busi-
nesses could find themselves held liable 
for labor violations committed by an-
other business when they might not 
have even been aware that they were 
considered a joint employer in the first 
place. 
Even worse, the risk of increased li-
ability incentivizes large businesses to 
stop contracting out to small busi-
nesses. This would force large busi-
nesses to keep more jobs in-house 
which, ultimately, raises prices for 
both businesses and consumers. 
The expanded definition of joint em-
ployer is also detrimental for franchise 
businesses. A recent study showed that 
the definition change has led to a 93 
percent increase in lawsuits against 
franchise businesses, costing them over 
$33 billion annually, and leading to the 
loss of 376,000 jobs. 
The study also showed that the ma-
jority of franchise businesses have been 
offering less services just in order to 
avoid lawsuits. This chilling effect 
hurts, again, both workers and con-
sumers alike. 
The PRO Act also compels private- 
sector employees to either join a union 
or risk being fired. The bill abolishes 
the State Right to Work Laws which 
allow workers the freedom to choose 
whether or not they want to pay fees to 
a union. 
If Right to Work Laws are repealed, 
not only will unions gain unprece-
dented 
new 
power, 
but 
economic 
growth and employment will suffer. A 
2018 study by the National Economic 
Research Associates found that be-
tween 2001 and 2016, States with Right 
to Work Laws saw private-sector em-
ployment grow by 27 percent; while 
States without Right to Work Laws 
grew only 15 percent. 
To top it off, the PRO Act strips 
workers of their right to cast anony-
mous ballots in union elections. Under 
current law, workers are able to anony-
mously oppose joining a union by cast-
ing ‘‘secret’’ and unpublicized ballots. 
However, this PRO Act abolishes this 
practice and forces employees to make 
their choice public about unionizing, 
which makes it easier for unions to in-
timidate and threaten workers who do 
not wish to sign up. 
Senior fellow at the Mackinac Center 
for Public Policy, Vincent Vernuccio, 
has said: ‘‘The secret ballot is a bed-
rock principle of democracy. It allows 
people to vote the way they feel with-
out fear of reprisal. Without it, those 
who hold the elections would hold all 
the power.’’ 
This bill should be opposed by anyone 
who is concerned with worker freedom 
and continuing our country’s economic 
boom. The PRO Act needs to be perma-
nently benched.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL GUN 
VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise because it is National Gun Vio-
lence Survivors Week, a time when we 
focus on sharing and amplifying the 
stories of gun violence survivors who 
live with the impacts of gun violence 
every day. 
I recall the morning of June 12, 2016, 
when my wife and I were awakened at 
6 in the morning by a barrage of texts 
because the unthinkable happened to 
our happy little town of Orlando, Flor-
ida. Gun violence on a massive scale 
had reared its ugly head at a place 
where people just wanted to have a 
good time, at the Pulse nightclub. 
We lost 49 Americans that day, 49 of 
my fellow Orlandoans who were just 
there to enjoy friendship and camara-
derie. Their lives were taken way too 
early from us. But we also have to 
focus on the 53 who were wounded, the 
survivors of the Pulse nightclub trag-
edy. One of them is a coworker of mine, 
Ramses Tinoco. 
Ramses is a paralegal who was good 
spirited, hard-working, and always ex-
cited about the job. Suddenly, for sev-
eral weeks, he wasn’t able to come 
back to work, or at least in a regular 
fashion. I remember talking to him 
about what it was like to be there. It 
was hard for him to talk about it, and 
I don’t blame him because no one 
should have to see those types of hor-
rors. 
Another good friend of mine, Ricardo 
Negron-Almodovar, a lawyer in Puerto 
Rico who came to central Florida for a 
new start, and within less than a year 
of living in Orlando, he faced this vi-
cious tragedy. But he has been fighting 
back. He is now on the Pulse national 
memorial 
advisory 
committee. 
We 
have a bipartisan bill going through 
the House that would make it a na-
tional memorial to remember those 49 
we lost and those 53 wounded survivors. 
But I also want to talk about the 
folks who take care of the survivors. 
Terry DeCarlo, who is pictured here 
on the far right, was retiring the Mon-
day after the Pulse nightclub shooting 
from the LGBT+ Center in Orlando. 
Terry couldn’t retire when his commu-
nity needed him most, so he stayed on 
for a year, bringing in supplies, helping 
with mental health, helping the fami-
lies coming from around the country to 
help their loved ones who were still 
surviving. 
During that time, all Terry thought 
about was others. It was only a few 
months after he retired a year-plus 
later that he found out that he had ad-
vanced stages of cancer that was teem-
ing through his jaw. One can only won-
der whether, if he wasn’t so busy, he 
might have gotten treatment or had 
noticed beforehand. But that wasn’t 
Terry. 
Terry cared about others. Terry lived 
to serve, and we just lost him last 
month. It is a sad tragedy, but Terry’s 
legacy will be remembered. 
We also have to honor with action, 
with real solutions. The shooter in this 
instance had a SIG Sauer MCX semi-
automatic rifle, a weapon of war made 
for battlefields, not for a suburban 
nightclub, one that could do unspeak-
able carnage even before police could 
get on the scene. 
There are things that are even more 
common ground than assault weapons 
bans. Our House passed a bipartisan 
universal background checks bill to 
make sure that, simply, those who 
aren’t supposed to have guns don’t get 
them. With giant loopholes for gun 
shows and private sales, this just 
doesn’t make sense. It is time to pass 
it. 
Also, the Charleston loophole, where 
we saw someone put a false address, 
and when the background check didn’t 
come back, he automatically got his 
guns and shot up a church in Charles-
ton. 
It is time for action.

H771 
February 5, 2020 
ADDRESSING 
SERIOUSNESS 
OF 
SLAVERY 
AND 
HUMAN 
TRAF-
FICKING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address a serious issue that 
affects millions of people around the 
world, to include many Americans: 
slavery and human trafficking. Despite 
major progress, many countries still 
struggle to define and understand 
human traffic operations and how to 
combat it. 
Most of us assume that human traf-
ficking transports people only inter-
nationally. In reality, the 2019 Traf-
ficking in Persons Report showed that 
a majority of human trafficking sur-
vivors were identified in their coun-
tries of citizenship. While women and 
children may account for the majority 
of people trafficked, adolescent boys 
and men also have been victims of this 
modern-day slavery. 
Everyone is vulnerable to human 
trafficking, women, children, foster 
youth, Native Americans, immigrant 
children, those with disabilities, and 
the LGBTQ community. That is why 
the public must be educated on human 
trafficking and reject the misconcep-
tion that it can’t or won’t happen to 
them or someone they know. 
While there is not an exact statistic 
on how many people are trafficked in 
the United States, Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo assessed as many as 24.9 
million people—adults and children— 
are trapped in this human form of mod-
ern slavery around the world, including 
our own country. 
We may also assume trafficking oc-
curs only in major cities like New York 
or Las Vegas, but it also happens in 
suburbs, rural areas, and on Tribal or 
farmland. In Nebraska, 900 individuals 
are being sold online for sex each 
month, and 75 percent of them are from 
just Omaha. 
I am grateful for the steps Nebraska 
has taken to combat trafficking and 
protect survivors, but legislation can 
do only so much. Organizations such as 
the Department of Justice, Department 
of Homeland Security, and the Depart-
ment of State have worked hard to 
fight this global issue and have been 
trained to locate and deter human traf-
ficking. 
I thank the Nebraska State Patrol, 
the sheriff departments, and local law 
enforcement for their diligent work in 
capturing traffickers and rescuing sur-
vivors. I thank the many nonprofit vol-
unteer organizations that are dedicated 
to making a difference in combating 
this crime. 
In honor of the National Slavery and 
Human Trafficking Month this past 
January, we must commit to work to-
gether to address this heinous crime 
and ensure that all are safe from ex-
ploitation. 
BRINGING AWARENESS TO IMPORTANCE OF 
MENTORING 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of National Mentoring 
Month from this past January. As a 
member of the Youth Mentoring Cau-
cus, I rise to bring awareness to the 
importance of supporting strategies 
and policies that enhance mentoring 
programs and increase the procure-
ment of quality volunteer mentors. 
Research has shown that mentoring 
relationships have positive effects on 
people’s lives in so many ways. Men-
toring reassures our youth that they 
are not alone in dealing with everyday 
challenges; creates opportunity for per-
sonal growth and development; and 
provides youth, especially those in fos-
ter care, with vital relationships, net-
works, and counseling services needed 
to navigate life and successfully transi-
tion into adulthood. 
I know the power of mentorship first-
hand. I joined the Air Force in 1985 
after a faith-based mentor saw where 
my talents leaned, and I would never 
have been a five-time commander nor a 
general 
officer 
without 
thoughtful 
mentors. 
In my district, MENTOR Nebraska 
has partnered with 26 Omaha public 
schools to implement a mentoring pro-
gram called Success Mentors, which 
serves over 600 youth. Within the last 2 
years, the percentage of mentored 
youth in North Omaha increased by 150 
percent. In the last 5 years, the per-
centage of mentored juvenile justice 
youth increased by 250 percent. In addi-
tion to a number of positive benefits 
associated with increased mentorship, 
this program has shown an improve-
ment in school attendance—by over 50 
percent in one school alone. 
Congress must partner and support 
State and local governments and non-
profits 
so 
they 
can 
continue 
to 
prioritize new ways and approaches for 
serving at-risk or disadvantaged youth 
and connect them with caring adults 
who will help them navigate life and be 
their support system. 
That is why I am an original cospon-
sor of H.R. 3061, the Foster Youth Men-
toring Act of 2019, which addresses the 
need for greater support of mentoring 
programs that serve youth in foster 
care by developing best practices and 
quality 
mentoring 
standards 
when 
searching for and hiring mentors. 
I thank our Nation’s mentors, who 
are actively strengthening our commu-
nities and making a difference in the 
educational, personal, and professional 
lives of today’s youth. Additionally, I 
urge my colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle to commit to improving our 
youth’s outcomes and futures by sup-
porting legislation like H.R. 3061. 
f 
RECOGNIZING GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. 
RUPPERSBERGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, this week, we recognize Gun 
Violence Survivors Week across our 
country. In my district alone, there 
have been 331 gun-related deaths and 
716 
injuries, 
including 
seven 
mass 
shootings over the last 7 years. 
There are two sides of the coin when 
it comes to ending gun violence. Imple-
menting 
commonsense 
gun 
safety 
measures that a vast majority of 
Americans support must be our top pri-
ority. At the same time, we have to 
begin addressing the root cause of gun 
violence in our communities, which is 
a revolving door phenomenon. Victims 
of gun violence are caught up in the 
drug wars, the culture of retaliation, 
and disrespect. 
In fact, the rate of violent reinjury at 
most of the Nation’s trauma centers is 
as high as 45 percent. One of the lead-
ing risk factors for violent injury is 
prior violent injury. 
While these victims are recuperating 
in the hospital, they are a captive audi-
ence. They are confined to bed, if only 
for a few days. This offers us a window 
of opportunity where we can offer sup-
port when they most need it. 
I am in the process of finalizing bi-
partisan, bicameral legislation with 
my colleague Congressman KINZINGER 
from Illinois, and our measure creates 
a new grant program to provide the 
victims of gun violence, who often be-
come repeat victims of predators them-
selves, with the resources they need to 
stop this vicious cycle. This might in-
clude bus money, clothes for a job 
interview, or some groceries. Often, 
victims need help finding an affordable 
apartment or getting off drugs. 
Violence intervention programs, like 
the ones that our bill will support, 
work. They reduce recidivism and hos-
pital readmissions, jail time, and un-
employment. This is why my pre-
viously introduced bill was endorsed by 
organizations such as the NAACP, the 
Fraternal Order of Police, and the 
American College of Surgeons. 
The University of Maryland’s Shock 
Trauma Center has been rated the top 
trauma center in the world. They sup-
port our troops in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. They do research as it relates to 
all sorts of trauma. Shock Trauma is 
led by Dr. Tom Scalea, with the great 
doctors, nurses, and aides who work in 
that great institution. They have im-
plemented this program that I am talk-
ing about here today, and let me tell 
you, it works. 
I am excited to reintroduce my bill 
so we can work on lowering the rates of 
firearm deaths throughout the coun-
try.

HONORING EDDIE BRIDGES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Eddie Bridges of 
Greensboro, North Carolina. 
Members of Congress rarely get the 
opportunity to honor those who have 
truly dedicated their lives to the public 
good. That is because it is increasingly

rare to encounter those who are truly 
selfless, truly dedicated to a cause 
larger than themselves, and who truly 
care about preserving the best of our 
natural resources for future genera-
tions. Greensboro’s Eddie Bridges is 
such a rare person. 
Madam Speaker, Eddie is an unself-
ish leader whose love of the outdoors 
and sportsmen’s community has led 
him to become one of the most effec-
tive conservation leaders in the history 
of North Carolina. 
On behalf of North Carolina’s con-
gressional delegation, I want the world 
to know what an impact Eddie has 
made and to thank him in this official 
salute, which nobody has ever deserved 
more. 
Madam Speaker, Eddie founded the 
North Carolina Wildlife Habitat Foun-
dation, which raised $5 million and has 
funded $1.5 million in conservation 
projects across North Carolina. 
b 1045 
Eddie has been the driving force be-
hind wildlife resource improvements 
that will benefit future generations 
forever. Thanks to Eddie’s persuasive 
abilities and creative thinking, he has 
recruited the State of North Carolina 
and others to join him—to the tune of 
millions of dollars in projects—to im-
prove wildlife restoration, water qual-
ity, and habitats statewide. 
Eddie’s foundation has funded, for ex-
ample, a quail habitat project in the 
Sandhills Game Land, a bass habitat 
project at Jordan Lake, a North Caro-
lina State University black bear re-
search project in Hyde County, and cre-
ated the Frank A. Sharpe Junior Wild-
life Education Center in Guilford Coun-
ty. 
We can all thank Eddie Bridges for 
the idea to create the North Carolina 
Wildlife Resources Commission’s Wild-
life Endowment Fund, which currently 
has $130 million in assets and has fund-
ed $70 million for wildlife restoration 
and habitat improvements. 
Madam Speaker, Eddie also helped 
create the State waterfowl stamp and 
State income tax checkoff for nongame 
and endangered wildlife, which to-
gether have raised $10 million for 
nongame 
wildlife 
and 
waterfowl 
projects. The endowments founded by 
Eddie have raised more than $200 mil-
lion to preserve and improve our nat-
ural habitat areas. 
Eddie served 12 years on the North 
Carolina Wildlife Resources Commis-
sion after being appointed by Governor 
Hunt. He has received top national 
awards, including the Field and Stream 
Conservation Hero of the Year Award, 
the 
Budweiser 
National 
Conserva-
tionist of the Year Award, the pres-
tigious Feinstone Award, the Thomas 
L. Quay Wildlife Diversity Award, and 
the Chevron Conservation Award. Last 
year, Eddie was inducted into the 
North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. 
But talk to Eddie and he will tell you 
these awards aren’t about him; they 
are about his desire to give something 
back. As Eddie said to the Wilmington 
Star-News last January: ‘‘It’s about 
much more than me. It honors the 1 
million men, women, and children who 
hunt and fish and inject more than $1.3 
billion into North Carolina’s economy 
every year.’’ 
An accomplished athlete at Elon Uni-
versity, a leader in the sportsman com-
munity, and a hunter and angler leg-
end, conservationist Eddie Bridges has 
made a positive impact on North Caro-
lina’s natural resources like no other 
before him. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the en-
tire delegation, I wish to thank Eddie 
for his years of service, his incredible 
resource development to strengthen 
our State’s wildlife, and the edu-
cational impact on our youth and fu-
ture generations. It is truly an honor 
to know Eddie and to recognize him 
today. 
f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIGHLIGHTS 
NUMEROUS SUCCESSES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. SMITH) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, just over 12 hours ago, Presi-
dent Donald J. Trump stood in this 
Chamber and delivered an incredible 
State of the Union Address. He high-
lighted numerous successes during his 
time as President of the United States: 
Over 7 million jobs created; 
Record unemployment—record unem-
ployment—for five decades; 
The lowest unemployment in over 70 
years for women; 
Record unemployment for African, 
Hispanic, and Asian Americans; 
Doubling of the child tax credit from 
$1,000 to $2,000; 
Orchestrating phase one of the China 
trade agreement, which increases the 
amount of agriculture products that 
the Chinese have to purchase from 
American farmers—the largest pur-
chase in the history of our country; 
Passing of the USMCA agreement. 
The President campaigned on it. It was 
a promise made. It was a promise kept; 
The largest military pay raise in the 
history of this country. 
The President said he was going to 
build a barrier along the southern bor-
der. He highlighted 100 miles of it being 
finished in his State of the Union Ad-
dress yesterday, with 500 more miles 
still planned. 
He highlighted how his administra-
tion has approved a record number of 
generic drugs, and, for the first time in 
over 50 years, drug prices have actually 
gone down. 
He highlighted numerous successes 
that all Members of Congress who at-
tended heard. It was unfortunate to sit 
in this Chamber and watch the Demo-
crats on the other side not stand, not 
applaud for these successes for Amer-
ica, these victories for America, the 
people who sent us to Washington, the 
people we serve, the people who are our 
bosses. These are their victories. These 
are their successes. But just because 
they came out of the mouth of Presi-
dent Donald Trump, the Democrats op-
pose them. 
Folks, that is chaos in government. 
Ever since the Democrats took con-
trol of this Chamber, they have had 
one mission, one mission alone, and 
that is to remove the duly elected 45th 
President of the United States, Donald 
J. Trump. 
Their mission wasn’t about lowering 
the cost of prescription drugs. Their 
mission was not getting government 
off the backs of small businesses, fam-
ily farmers, and individuals. Their mis-
sion 
was 
about 
removing 
Donald 
Trump. 
This partisan impeachment sham, 
this impeachment circus will be done 
today. In the United States Senate, 
President Donald J. Trump will be ac-
quitted for life. You will see the proc-
ess that happened in the House of Rep-
resentatives was clearly a sham in im-
peaching the President of the United 
States. 
It was so unfortunate yesterday to be 
sitting here and watching Speaker 
PELOSI, after the end of the speech, 
tear up the official speech of the Presi-
dent of the United States. That shows 
the true hatred that the Democrat so-
cialists have for the President of the 
United States. That conduct is not fit-
ting for the Speaker of the House. 
When the Speaker tore up that State 
of the Union speech, she ripped up the 
words that recognized one of the last 
living serving Tuskegee airmen. 
When she ripped up that speech, she 
ripped up the story of a 21-week-old 
surviving child who was born in a Kan-
sas City, Missouri, hospital. 
When she ripped up that State of the 
Union speech, she ripped up the story 
and the recognition of the families of 
Rocky Jones and Kayla Mueller.

RECOGNIZING MORRIS BURGER, FORMER 
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF BURGERS’ SMOKEHOUSE 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, it 
is with great joy that I share news of 
Morris Burger, former president and 
CEO of Burgers’ Smokehouse of Cali-
fornia, Missouri, being inducted into 
the Meat Industry Hall of Fame. 
After serving his country in the 
Army, Morris returned home to run the 
family business with the goal of pro-
ducing the finest cured ham in the 
country. The business was extremely 
successful 
and 
expanded 
numerous 
times over recent decades to the point 
that its business orders now exceed 
500,000 hams and tens of thousands of 
pounds of bacon, sausage, and specialty 
meats each year. 
Morris retired in the 1990s, and the 
business is now run by the third and 
fourth generations of Burger family 
members. 
Morris Burger has left a legacy to be 
proud of as Burgers’ Smokehouse con-
tinues to epitomize quality, taste, and 
innovation, while playing an active 
role in the community and remaining 
an influential leader in the industry. 
Congratulations, Morris Burger, for 
being inducted into the Meat Industry 
Hall of Fame, a well-deserved honor. 
STOP DRUG SMUGGLING BY FILLING THE 
TUNNELS ASAP 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, 
last week, our U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Patrol agents announced the dis-
covery of a highly sophisticated, ille-
gal, 4,309-foot cross-border tunnel from 
Mexico into California built by the 
drug cartels. 
Unfortunately, while the tunnel was 
first found in August of 2019, it will 
still take several months to close the 
tunnel as the agency completes a man-
datory environmental review and a 
lengthy contractor bidding process. 
In October of 2018, I visited the 
southern border and heard directly 
from 
Customs 
and 
Border 
Patrol 
agents in Arizona, and I heard a simi-
lar story. 
The process of closing drug tunnels is 
arduous and time-consuming. It often 
takes 3 to 4 months to abate this 
threat. That is unacceptable. 
Last year, I introduced H.R. 3968, the 
Eradicate Crossing of Illegal Tunnels 
Act, to address these problems. 
This bill expedites the approval proc-
ess by removing the unnecessary red 
tape currently preventing our CBP 
agents from addressing this critical 
vulnerability. It allows the Secretary 
of Homeland Security to waive the en-
vironmental review and for indefinite 
contracts to be secured so drug tunnels 
can be filled in a timely manner. 
We need to ensure our Border Patrol 
agents have the tools necessary to effi-
ciently and effectively remove illegal 
access into our country, hurting our 
community with illegal drugs. It is 
time to pass this crucial legislation, 
and I call on my colleagues to support 
my bill. 
f 
CAREER AND TECHNICAL 
EDUCATION MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize February as Career and Technical 
Education Month. Each year, this 
month highlights the benefits of a 
skills-based education and the valuable 
contributions that CTE students make 
to the American workforce and the 
American economy. 
More 
specifically, 
February 
2 
through February 8 is SkillsUSA Week. 
SkillsUSA is a leader in the CTE move-
ment. This annual celebration rep-
resents nearly 370,000 SkillsUSA mem-
bers across the country who are devel-
oping the personal, workplace, and 
technical skills necessary to earn and 
keep good-paying and rewarding jobs. 
A one-size-fits-all approach to edu-
cation is not an effective way to pre-
pare students for the workforce. We are 
doing students a great disservice when 
we only promote what is considered a 
traditional college experience. 
When we look at the potential of our 
Nation’s learners and contrast that 
with the 7 million unfilled jobs nation-
wide, clearly, there is a disconnect. 
This is often referred to as the skills 
gap, and CTE can help us bridge this 
divide. 
Now, I have the privilege of serving 
as the co-chair of the bipartisan House 
Career and Technical Education Cau-
cus alongside my colleague and good 
friend, Congressman JIM LANGEVIN. 
Over the years, we have met with 
many educators, counselors, adminis-
trators, and students to better under-
stand the resources necessary to sup-
port learners of all ages. 
I am proud of the legislation that we 
have put forward to ensure students 
have the tools they need to pursue a re-
warding education, and, eventually, a 
rewarding career. 
With this kind of support, we can 
help empower students and better pre-
pare them for a 21st century workforce. 
Most recently, that includes H.R. 5092, 
the Counseling for Career Choice Act, a 
bill that would invest in career coun-
seling for high school students as well 
as professional development opportuni-
ties for the counselors who support 
them. 
Career and technical education is not 
a plan B. It is a valuable educational 
option that is empowering learners of 
all ages to take control of their per-
sonal and professional futures. 
To me, the ideal educational system 
is one that allows students to get in 
with as few barriers to entry as pos-
sible, get the education that they need, 
and get out. By providing students 
with a clear picture of what the work-
force entails—or, more specifically, by 
investing in career and technical edu-
cation—we can help make that a re-
ality. 
Madam Speaker, I am asking my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating Ca-
reer and Technical Education Month 
by supporting the Counseling for Ca-
reer Choice Act and other common-
sense, bipartisan bills that help provide 
quality CTE opportunities to our Na-
tion’s students.

The recess having expired, the House

PRAYER 
Rabbi Seth Frisch, New Shul of 
America, Rydal, Pennsylvania, offered 
the following prayer: 
Almighty, I stand before You in pray-
er and in memory as I am reminded of 
Solomon, King of ancient Israel, who 
would preside over a most unusual ju-
dicial hearing, one in which two moth-
ers would lay claim to the life of one 
child, a child they each would insist to 
be their own. 
This parable allows us to see Solo-
mon’s wisdom as preserving the nation, 
as we are sadly reminded, so soon after 
his death, that the kingdom is split 
asunder. 
I, too, am reminded of Abraham Lin-
coln, when he spoke with prophetic- 
like prescience: ‘‘A house divided can-
not stand,’’ which was soon to become 
a war of brother against brother. From 
this we would soon learn that our fu-
ture lies not in enmity, but in unity. 
For, Lord, the Book of Leviticus, 
from Your Torah, teaches us in words 
inscribed upon the Liberty Bell in 
Philadelphia: 
‘‘Proclaim 
liberty 
throughout the land, to all of the in-
habitants thereof,’’ thus uniting one of 
our Nation’s ideals, ‘‘e pluribus unum,’’ 
out of the many, one. 
Lord God, the Founders of this Na-
tion understood our strength to be in 
the celebration of our differences while 
assiduously working to put our divi-
sions behind us. 
And so it is, Dear God, that we pray 
You remain with us. Continue to guide 
all of us in realizing the dream of this 
great country, to be a Nation indivis-
ible, a Nation seeking liberty, and 
above all, a Nation providing liberty 
and justice to all.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has examined the Journal of the 
last day’s proceedings and announces 
to the House her approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. LAHOOD led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
WELCOMING RABBI SETH FRISCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE) is recognized for 
1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to welcome Rabbi Seth 
Frisch, who delivered today’s opening 
prayer to the people’s House. 
Since his ordination in 1986, at the 
Jewish Theological Seminary of Amer-
ica in New York, Rabbi Frisch has been 
a source of comfort and counsel to 
Jews around the world. In his current 
posting as rabbi and teacher of the New 
Shul of Philadelphia, Rabbi Frisch 
helps serve as a guide for those who 
want to learn more about what it 
means to be Jewish in a safe and sup-
porting setting. 
In a way, today’s opening prayer was 
a homecoming for Rabbi Frisch, who 
previously served as a legislative as-
sistant to the chairman of the United 
States Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
I pray that we will all heed his words 
today, that out of many, we are one 
Nation. Let us strive to put our divi-
sions behind us and realize our dream 
of a country indivisible with liberty 
and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in recognition of National Gun Vi-
olence Survivors Week, a time when we 
remember the tragic and life-altering 
impact of the gun violence epidemic 
that continues to affect thousands of 
families across the country. 
Every year, 36,000 Americans are 
killed by gun violence and 100,000 
Americans are injured. In my city 
alone, an average of 765 people die of 
gun violence every year. 
Too many families have been touched 
by this violence. Too many young peo-
ple go to school afraid. Too many 
Americans live in fear. 
Last night, the President’s State of 
the Union only mentioned firearms 
once. And instead of presenting a plan, 
it defended the NRA. 
We owe it to every survivor and to 
everyone who has been touched by gun 
violence to do more than hold a mo-
ment of science or post a hashtag on 
Twitter. We owe the American people 
real action. 
f 
PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize and thank one of the most produc-
tive, job-producing constituents in my 
district, Punxsutawney Phil. 
Over the weekend, Punxsutawney 
Phil delivered us some good news: He 
predicted an early spring for the second 
year in a row. 
But that is not the only good news. 
Groundhog Day draws tens of thou-
sands of tourists to Jefferson County 
each year, which boosts revenue at 
local restaurants, hotels, and other 
small businesses. 
Last week, activists claimed that 
Punxsutawney Phil should be replaced 
by an animatronic groundhog powered 
by artificial intelligence. 
Well, I believe in creating jobs, not 
eliminating them. And Punxsutawney 
Phil is no exception. I will always 
stand up for the hardworking men, 
women, and rodents in the 15th District 
of Pennsylvania. 
In all seriousness, Groundhog Day 
brings together people of all different 
backgrounds, and this fun family cele-
bration reminds us of the importance 
of tradition. It is not only an economic 
stimulus in the district, but it is also a 
great source of pride. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE IS AN EPIDEMIC 
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise because there is an epi-
demic in our country. One hundred 
Americans die every day from gun vio-
lence. We are 25 times more likely to 
die from guns than people who live in 
comparable nations. 
Gun violence is personal to me. When 
I was a young boy, my sister took her 
life with my father’s revolver. In 2014, 
my community was devastated by the 
Isla Vista shooting that killed six peo-
ple and left 14 injured. 
I rise because there are commonsense 
solutions to curb this violent trend. 
One of those is my bipartisan Extreme 
Risk Protection Order Act of 2019, 
which will help ensure people who have 
demonstrated that they are at risk of 
hurting themselves or others tempo-
rarily don’t have access to guns. The 
bill passed out of the committee. I now 
ask the House to bring this legislation 
to the floor. 
The House has already sent two bi-
partisan background check bills to the 
Senate; yet, Senate Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL has not acted. There is no 
excuse. 
I will continue to rise until we end 
this epidemic. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
PROTECTING 
THE 
SECOND 
AMENDMENT 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the importance of 
protecting the Second Amendment to 
the Constitution. 
In my district, Commissioners in Da-
vidson, 
Davie, 
Iredell, 
and 
Rowan 
Counties in North Carolina recently 
passed resolutions that simply affirm 
the Second Amendment rights of their 
residents and declare that these coun-
ties will never participate in the in-
fringement of those rights through un-
constitutional gun control. 
Anti-gun politicians in neighboring 
Virginia and other States are trying to 
undermine and overturn the Second 
Amendment. That is why these meas-
ures in my State are both necessary 
and timely. 
I commend these counties, and I re-
main fully committed to defending the 
rights of responsible, law-abiding gun 
owners. 
Madam Speaker, it is a people prob-
lem, not a device problem. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, it 
pains me to stand before you today and 
recognize 
Gun 
Violence 
Survivors 
Week. As a Nation, we grieve for all 
the lives lost senselessly and all those 
who must live in the wake of these acts 
of horror. 
This week alone, we have seen an-
other school devastated by gun vio-
lence, another community uncertain 
how to move forward. 
Our country is faced with a growing 
epidemic, and it is our responsibility as 
lawmakers to take action to protect 
our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H775 
February 5, 2020 
That is why I am proud to have 
joined Senator ELIZABETH
WARREN, 
Congressman HANK
JOHNSON, and a 
group of colleagues to introduce the 
Gun Violence Prevention and Commu-
nity Safety Act. 
This bold reform includes my bill to 
strengthen gun shop regulations and 
prevent the theft of legal firearms. 
Over 30 percent of guns used in a crime 
are identified as stolen, and every one 
we keep out of the hands of the wrong 
people is a step closer to a safer reality 
for our Nation. The time to act is now. 
f 
SUPPORTING MAGNET SCHOOLS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to be 
recognized by the Magnet Schools of 
America as a Champion of Magnet 
School Excellence and to be a steadfast 
supporter of magnet schools. I appre-
ciate that President Donald Trump’s 
praising of magnet schools was in-
cluded last night in the State of the 
Union. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to 
visit Dutch Fork Elementary School 
Academy of Environmental Sciences, a 
magnet school in Irmo, South Carolina. 
Dutch Fork is one of many amazing ex-
amples of how magnet schools are im-
portant for academic excellence. I had 
the opportunity to meet with students 
and teachers and talk with them about 
their unique educational experiences. 
I was thankful to talk with Katrina 
Goggins, the Director of Communica-
tions for District Five of Lexington 
and Richland Counties, Principal Ju-
lius Scott, Assistant Principal Brandon 
Gantt, School District Five Magnet Di-
rector Sara Wheeler, and Shirley Cope. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism 
with the courageous leadership of 
President Donald Trump.

HONORING 
THE 
UNBREAKABLE 
BOND 
OF 
MARK 
AND 
DAVID 
CARLES 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mark 
and David Carles, two brothers with an 
unbreakable bond. 
Ever since they were kids growing up 
on Staten Island, Mark and his older 
brother, David, have been absolutely 
inseparable. When Mark was diagnosed 
with a rare form of liver cancer in Oc-
tober of 2018, David postponed his base-
ball career to take care of his brother. 
While Mark was using a breathing 
tube and unable to speak, the brothers 
communicated using sign language. 
After a life-threatening surgery, the 
first thing Mark did was sign David’s 
name. 
Mark is a talented runner who, with 
David’s support, refused to let chemo-
therapy get in the way of his training, 
whether it was doing laps down hos-
pital corridors or running around the 
dining room table. 
The brothers have even encouraged 
their father, Sandy, to run with them 
as well. All three train for road races 
together. Mark recently finished the 
Staten Island Athletic Club 5K in 
under 24 minutes. 
Mark and David, your deep commit-
ment to one another is an inspiration 
to Staten Island, all of New York City, 
and all of America. 
Mark, you are a fighter. You inspire 
your family, your friends, and all those 
who you fight for as well.

HONORING 
THE 
LEGACY 
OF 
METAMORA HIGH SCHOOL COACH 
PAT RYAN 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in the House to recognize and 
congratulate Metamora High School 
head football coach Pat Ryan, who has 
announced his retirement after 30 
years at the helm of the program. 
Over his 30-year tenure, Coach Ryan 
has led the Redbirds to seven cham-
pionship games and two State titles. 
He retires with a record of 268–76, and a 
spot in the Illinois High School Foot-
ball Hall of Fame. 
Coach Ryan’s greatness is known 
across central Illinois. His players love 
him. His students love him. Even his 
rivals love him, or at least love com-
peting against him. 
Not only is Coach Ryan a legend on 
the field, but his success off the field in 
modeling young men is unrivaled and 
unmatched. Coach Ryan coached thou-
sands of students and left a profound 
impact on the lives of countless play-
ers. Many of his former players have 
become educators and coaches them-
selves and attribute their career paths 
to Coach Ryan’s positive influence on 
their lives. 
Congrats to Coach Ryan on his leg-
endary career, both on and off the field. 
He has made our central Illinois com-
munity a better place, and he will be 
missed on Friday nights. I congratu-
late him on his Hall of Fame career. 
Go Redbirds.

RECOGNIZING BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
urge every one of my colleagues to use 
Black History Month to celebrate the 
contributions of people who came to 
this hemisphere not of their own free 
will—in chains, in bondage, and then 
helped to make this country great. 
It is important that we not only rec-
ognize them and their contributions 
but their example of resilience: 
Philip Reid, who as an enslaved man 
was responsible for casting the statue 
which sits atop this building, and as a 
free man supervised the installation of 
the Statue of Freedom; Maggie Walker, 
who became the first woman to preside 
over a savings institution, which dur-
ing the Great Depression consolidated 
to become the Consolidated Bank and 
Trust, which still exists today; Ralph 
Bunche, an American diplomat funda-
mental to the creation and adoption of 
the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights who later went on to be the first 
African American to win the Nobel 
Peace Prize for his negotiation efforts 
between Egypt and Israel; and William 
Leidesdorff of Saint Croix, master of 
shipping 
of 
vessels, 
rancher, 
gold 
miner, and one of the founders of San 
Francisco. 
These Americans are quietly embed-
ded in our Nation’s history, but today, 
this month, we celebrate them, their 
work, and their dedication. 
f 
RECOGNIZING EINAR MAISCH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Einar Maisch 
for his 34 years of service to the Placer 
County Water Agency. Water resiliency 
and infrastructure are pressing needs 
in northern California, and Einar has 
devoted his career to solving these crit-
ical issues. 
As general manager, he worked to 
make PCWA the local leader in water 
rights by overseeing the clear and 
transparent budget process, increasing 
customer accessibility to the agency, 
and expanding its regional and na-
tional influence on water issues. 
Throughout his long tenure, Einar 
has always prioritized the needs and in-
terests of the customers and the com-
munity. His work will leave a lasting 
impact on water planning, resiliency, 
and management in northern Cali-
fornia for decades come, and the north 
State is very thankful for all Einar has 
done. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Einar, and I 
wish him the best of luck in his much- 
deserved and probably busier retire-
ment. May he keep his knowledge and 
experience available to all of us.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL GUN 
VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Gun Violence Survivors 
Week.

average of 100 Americans every single 
day. Also, there are close to 100,000 
Americans injured every year from gun 
violence, yet we do very little to pre-
vent these preventable injuries and 
deaths. 
I am proud to come from a State 
with effective gun laws. In New Jersey, 
we have strong background checks, a 
ban on high-capacity magazines, and 
an extreme risk protection order for 
possible victims. That is why New Jer-
sey has one of the lowest firearm death 
rates in America. If we had national 
laws such as the ones in New Jersey, 
we could save lives and spare families 
the hurt and horrors of gun violence. 
f 
HELPING VETERANS WITH 
TRAINED SERVICE DOGS 
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, 
for far too long, we have failed to serve 
veterans struggling with the invisible 
wounds of war, veterans who nearly 
gave everything to us. 
From veterans who served in Viet-
nam and Korea to those who have re-
cently returned home from Afghani-
stan and Iraq, Congress has done too 
little to curb the often-devastating ef-
fect post-traumatic stress can have in 
the lives of the brave men and women 
who served our Nation in combat. 
That is why I am proud today to rise 
in support of my colleague Representa-
tive STEVE
STIVERS’ bipartisan bill, 
which 
will 
help 
veterans 
in 
the 
Lowcountry and across this Nation 
manage the symptoms of post-trau-
matic stress by pairing them with 
trained service dogs. 
With the help of a service dog, many 
veterans with severe post-traumatic 
stress are able to return to work, at-
tend college, and spend more meaning-
ful time with their families and their 
loved ones. The brave men and women 
who voluntarily raised their right 
hands and swore an oath to defend our 
Nation deserve nothing less than the 
opportunity to succeed when they re-
turn home. 
The PAWS Act is a critical step in 
the right direction. I urge all of my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bipartisan legislation. 
f 
AMERICANS WILL JUDGE 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, ‘‘I sol-
emnly swear that in all things apper-
taining to the trial of the impeachment 
of Donald John Trump, President of 
the United States, now pending, I will 
do impartial justice according to the 
Constitution and laws.’’ 
That is the oath Senators swore on 
January 16. It is the oath created by 
Senators when they tried the first im-
peachment of a President in 1868. It is 
an oath rooted in the Revolution 
fought by their grandparents to create 
a republic of laws, not kings. It is an 
oath whose power derives from its com-
mon sense: that a juror must always be 
impartial for a trial to be fair. And it 
is an oath made necessary by the fact 
that Senators are not, as we are not, 
under normal circumstances, impartial 
in our work. 
The words chosen for this oath recog-
nize that when our Constitution calls 
Senators to try impeachment, it calls 
them away from their role as par-
tisans. When that oath is taken, Sen-
ators are supposed to step back from 
the affiliation of party or political kin-
ship with or opposition to the Presi-
dent on trial. They are required, as the 
oath plainly states, to ‘‘do impartial 
justice according to the Constitution 
and laws.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this afternoon, Sen-
ators will be asked to vote on the two 
Articles of Impeachment the House 
presented on abuse of power and the 
obstruction of Congress. After voting 
to refuse to hear evidence and call wit-
nesses 
with 
pertinent 
information, 
nearly all Republican Senators have al-
ready announced that they will vote 
against the articles. 
In doing so, many of them acknowl-
edge that what President Trump did 
was wrong and inappropriate. They ac-
cept that it was wrong for him to with-
hold military aid to Ukraine until the 
President of that country promised to 
interfere in the American elections. 
The evidence of President Trump’s 
abuse of power and attempt to solicit 
foreign interference in the 2020 elec-
tions is clear enough that Republican 
Senators cannot and have not denied 
the facts, yet they cannot bring them-
selves to confront this President and 
are choosing party over country. 
The Senator from Alaska, in explain-
ing her decision to vote to block wit-
nesses and evidence, tried to deflect re-
sponsibility from the consequences of 
her actions, writing: ‘‘I have come to 
the conclusion that there will be no 
fair trial in the Senate.’’ I agree with 
that. She further said: ‘‘It is sad for me 
today to admit that, as an institution, 
the Congress has failed.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the Congress has 
not failed. The House did its job, 
whether you agree or not. In regular 
order, by a vote of this House, we im-
peached the President of the United 
States based upon our oath to protect 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States. 
The House did its job and did so with 
the solemnity required when under-
taking the process of impeachment, 
which we did not seek but accepted as 
our responsibility under the Constitu-
tion. We held hearings, called wit-
nesses, 
and 
subpoenaed 
documents. 
Many of the witnesses and documents, 
of course, were withheld by the White 
House. 
It is the Senate that will fail if Sen-
ators do not uphold their oaths to im-
partial justice. It is the Senate, Madam 
Speaker, that will fail if it does not 
hold this President accountable for 
using a hold on military aid to compel 
an ally to interfere in our election for 
his own personal gain. 
History will judge poorly those who 
choose fear of their party over the 
courage to do the right thing. Neither 
the Speaker nor myself, nor the whip, 
JIM CLYBURN, urged any member in our 
party to vote any way on impeach-
ment. There was no lobbying. There 
was no pressure. Our members voted 
consistent with their oath of office and 
the conviction that that vote was re-
quired by that oath to protect and de-
fend the Constitution. 
Americans will judge. I am often 
asked why the House passed Articles of 
Impeachment even knowing that the 
odds were slim that Senate Repub-
licans would set aside partisanship and 
hear the case as impartial jurors. It is 
because I know future generations will 
look back on this chapter in our his-
tory and ask: Who stood up for the 
Constitution and the laws? Who stood 
up for the values our Founders charged 
us to keep? Who refused to shrink from 
the heavy responsibilities of their 
oath? I can be proud that the House did 
its job, followed the law, defended our 
Constitution. 
We did not convict; that is not our 
role. Essentially, what we said was 
there was probable cause that powers 
had been abused and certainly cause to 
see that the President refused to co-
operate with the constitutional respon-
sibilities of the House of Representa-
tives. 
I am also proud of the House man-
agers, as all of my colleagues on the 
Democratic side of the aisle are proud 
of our managers who made their case. 
They made their case with intellect. 
They made their case with evidence 
that had been adduced here in the 
House. They made their case and ap-
pealed to Senators to hold this Presi-
dent accountable, as our Founders in-
tended. 
Almost everybody has watched a 
trial either in person or on television. 
A trial is not an opening argument and 
a closing argument with nothing in be-
tween. Seventy-five percent of our peo-
ple wanted to have witnesses because 
that was their understanding of what a 
trial is, not just argument at the be-
ginning and argument at the end, but 
evidence for jurors who have pledged to 
be impartial to consider. Any judge in 
this country would agree that opening 
and closing statements alone are not a 
trial. 
Nevertheless, the House managers 
proved their case. The truth is clear. 
The American people know what that 
truth is and know what this President 
has done. And they will remember who 
on this day abided by the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

PUPPIES 
ASSISTING 
WOUNDED 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
FOR 
VET-
ERANS THERAPY ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4305) to direct the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot 
program on dog training therapy, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4305 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Puppies As-
sisting Wounded Servicemembers for Vet-
erans Therapy Act’’ or the ‘‘PAWS for Vet-
erans Therapy Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) According to the analyses of veteran 
suicide published by the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs in August 2016 and titled ‘‘Sui-
cide Among Veterans and Other Americans’’, 
and in June 2018, titled ‘‘VA National Sui-
cide Date Report’’— 
(A) an average of 20 veterans died by sui-
cide each day in 2014; 
(B) mental health disorders, including 
major depression and other mood disorders, 
have been associated with increased risk for 
suicide; 
(C) since 2001, the proportion of users of 
the Veterans Health Administration with 
mental health conditions or substance use 
disorders has increased from approximately 
27 percent in 2001 to more than 40 percent in 
2014; and 
(D) overall, suicide rates are highest 
among patients with mental health and sub-
stance use disorder diagnoses who are in 
treatment and lower among those who re-
ceived a mental health diagnosis but were 
not at risk enough to require enhanced care 
from a mental health provider. 
(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs 
must be more effective in its approach to re-
ducing the burden of veteran suicide con-
nected to mental health disorders, including 
post-traumatic stress disorder (in this sec-
tion referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’), and new, rig-
orous scientific research provides persuasive 
weight to the growing anecdotal evidence 
that service dogs ameliorate the symptoms 
associated with PTSD, and in particular, 
help prevent veteran suicide. 
(3) Several organizations have proven 
track records of training service dogs for 
veterans with severe PTSD and dramatically 
improving those veterans’ quality of life, 
ability to re-enter society, and, most impor-
tantly, their chances of survival. 
SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
PILOT PROGRAM ON DOG TRAINING 
THERAPY. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Commencing not later 
than 120 days after the date of the enactment 
of the Act, subject to the availability of ap-
propriations, the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs shall carry out a pilot program under 
which the Secretary shall make grants to 
one or more appropriate non-government en-
tities for the purpose of assessing the effec-
tiveness of addressing post-deployment men-
tal health and post-traumatic stress disorder 
(in this section referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’) 
symptoms through a therapeutic medium of 
training service dogs for veterans with dis-
abilities. 
(b) DURATION

period of time determined appropriate by the 
organization and the Secretary, including 
service skills to address or alleviate symp-
toms unique to veterans’ needs; 
(7) agree to provide both lectures on serv-
ice dog training methodologies and practical 
hands-on training and grooming of service 
dogs; 
(8) agree that in hiring service dog training 
instructors to carry out training under the 
pilot program, the non-government entity 
will give a preference to veterans who have 
successfully graduated from PTSD or other 
residential treatment program and who have 
received adequate certification in service 
dog training; 
(9) agree not to use shock collars or prong 
collars as training tools and to use positive 
reinforcement training; 
(10) agree that upon the conclusion of

for and appropriately placing the dog; 
(C) the Department of Veterans Affairs will 
have no additional responsibility to provide 
for any benefits under this section; and 
(D) the Department of Veterans Affairs 
will have no liability with respect to the dog; 
(11) provide follow-up support service for 
the life of the dog, including a contact plan

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H778 
February 5, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4305, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
b 1230 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Puppies Assisting Wounded Serv-
icemembers for Veterans Therapy Act, 
otherwise known as the PAWS Act, in-
troduced by Representative STIVERS of 
Ohio. 
This bill has more than 300 cospon-
sors, which put it on the Consensus 
Calendar. It reflects this Chamber’s de-
sire to pass legislation addressing vet-
erans’ mental health, which I strongly 
support. 
The bill calls for the VA to establish 
a 5-year pilot program to make grants 
available to appropriate nongovern-
mental entities ‘‘for the purpose of as-
sessing the effectiveness of addressing 
post-deployment mental health and 
post-traumatic stress disorder symp-
toms through a therapeutic medium of 
training service dogs for veterans with 
disabilities.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I think everyone in this 
room today can agree that dogs—and 
animals, more broadly speaking—make 
great companions. In fact, in 2018, 
Americans spent $72 billion on their 
pets. Years of research have illustrated 
numerous positive health outcomes, 
such as lowering blood pressure. 
I intend to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill; 
however, I do have concerns about this 
bill becoming law before VA’s study ex-
amining the possible therapeutic bene-
fits of veterans with PTSD receiving 
either a service dog or an emotional 
support dog is complete. 
Service dogs and emotional support 
dogs are very different, and it is impor-
tant that we understand the efficacy of 
providing veterans with PTSD with ei-
ther type of dog. Relying on the dog for 
companionship is far different than 
using dogs as a form of behavioral 
health treatment. 
Mr. Speaker, like any other treat-
ment, therapy, or pharmaceutical pro-
vided to veterans, research must be 
performed 
so 
informed 
policy 
and 
treatment decisions can be made. A 
draft monograph outlining VA’s find-
ings is complete and currently under-
going peer review by the National 
Academy of Sciences. The VA antici-
pates having a final report to Congress 
not later than the end of July 2020. 
Before this bill was placed on the 
Consensus Calendar, I had hoped to 
wait to have the findings of this study 
so that we could properly review and 
mark up this legislation, ensuring vet-
erans receive effective, evidence-based 
treatments for PTSD. 
Mr. Speaker, we are passing this leg-
islation without scientific evidence 
supporting the effectiveness of service 
dogs for the treatment of PTSD. How-
ever, I support this bill because its 
placement on the Consensus Calendar 
reflects the will of the Members of this 
Chamber, and years of research have 
shown positive health outcomes related 
to owning dogs for companionship. 
When we receive the study, I intend 
to work with our Senate colleagues to 
improve and strengthen this legislation 
so that we can ensure veterans diag-
nosed with PTSD receive effective 
treatments. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself as much time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4305, as amended, the Puppies 
Assisting Wounded Servicemembers for 
Veterans Therapy Act, or the PAWS 
Act. 
This bill is sponsored by Congress-
man STEVE STIVERS from Ohio. STEVE 
is a brigadier general in the Army Na-
tional Guard, where he wore our Na-
tion’s uniform for over three decades of 
service in Ohio and overseas in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Needless to say, he knows firsthand 
the toll that military service can take 
and the need to ensure that the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs is equipped to 
provide our veterans with all the serv-
ices and supports that they need to not 
only recover from their wounds of war, 
but to lead healthy, full, and meaning-
ful lives as civilians. The PAWS Act 
would provide VA with an additional 
tool to accomplish that goal by pro-
viding grants to organizations to assist 
veterans struggling with post-trau-
matic stress disorder and other mental 
health challenges through service dog 
training. 
Veterans participating in the pro-
gram would be paired with a prospec-
tive service dog and work with a quali-
fied service dog training instructor to 
train the dog as a certified service ani-
mal. At the conclusion of the training, 
if the veteran and the veteran’s pro-
vider agree that it is in the best inter-
ests of the veteran, the veteran will be 
able to keep their dog, or it would be 
paired with another veteran in need. 
The grant program that the PAWS 
Act would create is based on service 
dog training therapy programs at Wal-
ter Reed National Medical Center in 
Maryland and the Palo Alto VA Med-
ical Center in California. Both of those 
programs are well established and have 
shown remarkably positive anecdotal 
outcomes for servicemembers and vet-
erans who have gone through them. 
It won’t come as a surprise to any 
dog 
owner—me, 
included—that 
the 
companionship and unconditional love 
offered by man’s best friend has a pow-
erful real-world healing effect. The old 
saying is, in Washington, ‘‘if you want 
a friend, get a dog.’’ I am glad that this 
program will expand that effort as well 
as the unique assistance that trained 
service dogs provide to more of our Na-
tion’s heroes. 
This bill is cosponsored by 321 of our 
House colleagues, a tremendous bipar-
tisan show of support that is reflective 
of the desire of this body to care for 
those who have borne the battles and 
are struggling with invisible injuries as 
a result. 
I am grateful to General STEVE STIV-
ERS for his hard work getting this bill 
to the House floor today, and I am 
happy to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL), my good friend. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO for yielding. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4305, 
the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. 
This important bipartisan legislation 
will create a pilot program within the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to give 
veterans access to treatment derived 
from working with service dogs. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to 
take this opportunity to thank the 
gentleman from Ohio, Representative 
STIVERS, for his tireless leadership on 
this legislation. I deeply appreciate his 
dedication to our Nation’s veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, thousands of veterans, 
between 11 and 20 percent, experience 
post-traumatic stress disorder. Too 
many of the men and women who serve 
our country return home with unseen 
trauma that can make it hard to carry 
out daily activities, like going to work 
or going to school. We owe it to our 
veterans to make sure that they have 
the resources they need to recover. 
In November, I had the opportunity 
to spend some time with a Vietnam 
veteran named Walter Parker and his 
service dog, Jackson. Walter shared 
how his partnership with Jackson has 
dramatically improved his life. Jack-
son helps Walter participate in activi-
ties that we all take for granted, like 
going to the movies or the grocery 
store. Their bond has been instru-
mental in Walter’s continuing recov-
ery. 
His story is not unique. Researchers, 
doctors, and veterans, themselves, all 
report the same thing: Service dogs 
soothe the invisible wounds of war. 
Under the PAWS for Veterans Ther-
apy Act, the VA will partner with non-
profit organizations working with vet-
erans and service dogs to create work- 
therapy programs that help veterans 
learn the art and science of training 
dogs. After completing the program, 
the veterans may adopt their dogs to 
provide continued therapy. 
Mission-based therapy has been prov-
en to be a successful means of treating 
PTSD, and this legislation will enable

more veterans to access the care that 
service dogs can provide. 
Mr. Speaker, Walter and Jackson and 
countless other vets and their service 
dogs are proof that this therapy works. 
We owe it to our veterans to explore 
creative ways to help them after they 
have given so much to our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important and innovative 
legislation and give veterans the treat-
ment they need and deserve. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I do want to give a shout-out 
to former Congressman Ron DeSantis, 
now Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, 
who championed this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS), 
my good friend. 
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
DAVID P. ROE) for yielding time. 
This bill is, indeed, a blending of a 
bill that Governor DeSantis had in the 
last Congress and a bill we had in the 
last Congress, and we now have 321 co-
sponsors on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, our serv-
icemembers returning from war some-
times have invisible wounds. I served 
as a battalion commander in Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, and soldiers under my 
command came back with post-trau-
matic stress and, indeed, some even 
with traumatic brain injury. 
All too often, we see the links be-
tween military service and mental 
health conditions, including post-trau-
matic stress, as well as traumatic 
brain injury and even suicide. 
Mr. Speaker, we lose 20 veterans a 
day to suicide. Congress has to work to 
address that situation. Mental health 
and the suicide epidemic that are fac-
ing veterans can’t be solved with a sin-
gle solution, but it is important we 
look at this comprehensively and come 
up with as many building blocks as we 
can to address this crisis. That is why 
I introduced the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act, which is based on clinical 
evidence from Kaiser Permanente and 
Purdue University. 
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act 
would establish a pilot program in the 
Department of Veterans Affairs au-
thorizing the Secretary to give grants 
to local service dog training organiza-
tions so that they can work with vet-
erans, and veterans can receive train-
ing to train service dogs and also end 
up with a service dog if it is appro-
priate for them. 
This effort has been 10 years in the 
making, and it is time that we actually 
bring it to a conclusion. I am grateful 
that so many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to give a special 
thanks to Representative KATHLEEN 
RICE, my lead Democrat cosponsor, and 
the many other folks who worked on 
this bill. I also want to thank the ma-
jority leader, STENY HOYER, for bring-
ing it to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, 321 Members of Con-
gress don’t agree on a lot, but they 
agree we have got to address the prob-
lem of veteran suicide and give access 
to veterans to service dogs if the vet-
erans have post-traumatic stress. 
There is a Senate bill. This bill 
passed the House 2 years ago. My 
version of the bill passed the House 2 
years ago but died in the Senate. There 
is now a Senate version with Senator 
TILLIS, Senator SINEMA, Senator FISCH-
ER, and Senator FEINSTEIN. It is bipar-
tisan. I am hopeful they will get that 
done in quick order here. We owe it to 
these veterans to give creative solu-
tions to treat their mental health and 
their anxiety issues. 
Since it was brought up, I do want to 
mention that this VA study was au-
thorized in the 2010 National Defense 
Authorization Act. It is 2020. That is 10 
years. In that time, it was started, 
studied for 4 years, halted, then it 
began again. It has been delayed three 
times, and now they say it may be out 
in June. I am hopeful that it is, but we 
can’t wait any longer. Our veterans 
can’t wait any longer. 
In the interim, this has been studied 
at 
Purdue 
University 
and 
Kaiser 
Permanente, and the studies were con-
clusive: The efficacy of service dogs 
works. The results are undisputed. 
There is less anxiety. These veterans 
are on fewer drugs. There is a lower in-
cidence of suicide. 
We can’t wait any longer to address 
this crisis. We must pass this bill 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. I 
urge them to support H.R. 4305. 
God bless our veterans. It is time we 
give them the help they need. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
SLOTKIN), 
my 
good 
friend. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act. I am incredibly proud to 
be coleading this bipartisan bill to con-
nect veterans with service dogs in their 
communities and improve outcomes for 
veterans’ mental health and well-being. 
There are two amazing organizations 
in Livingston County in my district 
that train dogs and place them with 
veterans in need: Veteran Service Dogs 
in Howell, Michigan, and Blue Star 
Service Dogs in Pinckney. 
In December, I had the chance to 
visit Blue Star Service Dogs for myself. 
It was incredible to see these dogs in 
action and hear directly from veterans 
about how service dogs are helping 
them heal from depression, PTSD, and 
so many other invisible service-related 
wounds. 
Both organizations are doing amaz-
ing work for veterans in our commu-
nity, and I want to salute them. 
This bill before us today sets up a 
pilot program through the VA to part-
ner with local nonprofits, just like the 
ones in my district, to create work- 
therapy programs for veterans to help 
expand the number of veterans who can 
access the benefits of training and 
adopting a service dog. 
This issue is particularly personal to 
me. I am an Army wife. I am married 
to a 30-year Army officer, an Apache 
pilot. I have a step-daughter currently 
on Active Duty, a son-in-law on Active 
Duty, and my other step-daughter is a 
physician at the VA. 
While we make the decision to send 
men and women to fight for our coun-
try, we make the decision to support 
them for the rest of their lives. That is 
a nonpartisan responsibility, and it 
couldn’t be more clear or more urgent, 
especially as we recognize the stag-
gering rate of suicide in the veteran 
community. 
b 1245 
Every day, an average of 17 veterans 
are victims of suicide. Think about 
that. Within the community of vet-
erans that served in Iraq and Afghani-
stan, more veterans have been lost to 
suicide than to combat, which is both 
devastating and unacceptable. 
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act 
will have a real impact on improving 
the well-being of our veterans. All you 
need to do is talk to a veteran suffering 
from depression or PTSD to understand 
what adopting a dog does for their 
lives. 
I am incredibly proud of what this 
bill represents: a group of Democrats 
and Republicans finding an area of 
strong common ground and pushing 
legislation to a vote that could have 
significant impact. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. JOHN W. 
ROSE), my good friend and fellow col-
league. 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Pup-
pies Assisting Wounded Servicemem-
bers for Veterans Therapy Act, or 
PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. 
I thank the distinguished gentleman 
from Tennessee for yielding me this 
time and for his service to the good 
people of Tennessee. 
I also wholeheartedly thank Rep-
resentative STIVERS
for approaching 
me 
about 
cosponsoring 
this 
out-
standing policy proposal. His leader-
ship on this issue is truly appreciated 
by me, but more importantly, by 
America’s veterans. 
While we are enjoying a time of un-
paralleled economic growth in my life-
time, a safer and more secure Nation, 
and 243 years of enduring freedom made 
possible in no small part by the sac-
rifice of our servicemembers, we also 
live in a time when approximately 20 
veterans are lost to suicide every day. 
This heartbreaking reality calls us to 
action. Research has demonstrated the 
powerful effect of service dogs in the 
lives of those suffering from post-trau-
matic stress disorder. These loyal com-
panions have been shown to lead to 
stronger mental health, greater pur-
pose in life, and renewed hope. 
Today, I stand up for our veterans in 
Tennessee and all of our veterans 
across the country who would find sup-
port from PAWS. I invite my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H780 
February 5, 2020 
join us in supporting our veterans and 
vote for the PAWS for Veterans Ther-
apy Act. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. WALTZ), an Army veteran from 
Florida’s Sixth Congressional District. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in support of this important legis-
lation, H.R. 4305, the PAWS Act. 
As a combat veteran, I have person-
ally relied on service dogs in battle. We 
all recently witnessed the important 
role that service dogs play in combat 
roles and in national security when we 
saw Conan, the Belgian Malinois, who 
participated in the raid that killed 
ISIS leader al-Baghdadi. Service dogs 
also 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
transitioning veterans back to civilian 
life. 
There is no denying these connec-
tions. The support they provide our 
veterans puts that connection on an 
entirely different level of importance. 
Many of our veterans return back from 
their service not the same as when 
they left, and I can personally attest to 
that. 
They have three bad choices: either 
they don’t come home, they come 
home missing limbs, or they certainly 
come home—when you have been in 
combat—different mentally than when 
they left. 
These invisible wounds often make 
life very difficult for our veterans who 
have served. We owe them. The least 
we can do is to provide a full menu of 
options to their medical providers 
when they need help, whether those are 
medicines, whether those are uncon-
ventional treatments like hyperbaric 
chambers, or whether they are service 
dogs. That should be one of the options 
that our providers can provide. 
I had the personal opportunity to 
meet with several veterans who have 
benefited from these service animals in 
my district last year and their stories 
were just incredible. 
The common theme amongst all of 
them was that they either completely 
eliminated or drastically reduced the 
amount of medication that they were 
on as a result of PTSD, depression, and 
anxiety. 
Almost all of these veterans who had 
service dogs in their lives not only re-
duced their medications, but they got 
out more and they socialized more. The 
dog served as an important and posi-
tive forcing function in their lives. 
I think this legislation is long over-
due. This is long overdue for the VA to 
provide. I love the fact that it engages 
our veteran service organizations like 
K9s for Warriors which is just north of 
my district in St. Johns County, and 
others. 
These dogs can be life changing, and 
they have been life changing, and they 
should continue to be, and they should 
be provided by us, by our society that 
owes these vets so much. 
Our veterans deserve to live happy 
lives after their service, and we should 
do everything that we can to ensure 
their well-being. I urge my colleagues 
to pass this important bill. 
I thank my colleagues Representa-
tive ROE and Representative STIVERS 
for their leadership, and we all should 
let them know and let these veterans 
know that we have their six and the 
House of Representatives stands with 
them on their path to healing. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time, as I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this needed 
legislation and I associate my remarks 
with what Mr. WALTZ just stated. 
Anyone who has ever had the joy—as 
I have through my entire life—to have 
those animals associated with you 
knows how uplifting and helpful it can 
be to these people. As has been men-
tioned many times, we have not been 
making a dent in our suicide rate, and 
it is time to start thinking out of the 
box. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
passing H.R. 4305, as amended, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GARCI´A of Illinois). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. TAKANO) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 4305, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H781 
February 5, 2020 
Estuaries are extraordinarily produc-
tive ecosystems where fresh water from 
rivers and streams mixes with salt-
water from the ocean. 
In my district in my home State of 
New Jersey, the New York-New Jersey 
Harbor & Estuary Program encom-
passes some 250 square miles of open 
water, including parts of the Raritan, 
Rahway, Elizabeth, and Hackensack 
Rivers. 
My bill, the Protect and Restore 
America’s Estuaries Act, makes sev-
eral important improvements to this 
program. First, it nearly doubles fund-
ing for the program’s 28 estuaries of 
national significance, including the 
New York-New Jersey Harbor & Estu-
ary Program. 
It ensures that management plans 
governing nationally significant estu-
aries consider the effects of recurring 
extreme weather events and that they 
develop and implement appropriate ad-
aptation strategies. It expands eligi-
bility for grants under the program to 
organizations 
working 
to 
address 
stormwater runoff, coastal resiliency, 
and accelerated land loss issues. 
It requires the NEP management, the 
regional conferences that are part of 
the NEP, to develop and implement 
strategies to increase local awareness 
about the ecological health and water 
quality of estuaries. 
It is hard to overstate just how im-
portant estuaries are to the broader 
marine ecology. They are sometimes 
referred to as the nurseries of the sea 
because of the vast and diverse array of 
marine animals that spend the early 
parts of their lives in them, with their 
calm waters providing a safe habitat 
for smaller birds and other animals, as 
well as for spawning and nesting. 
Further, estuaries act as stopover 
sites for migratory animals including 
ducks, geese, and salmon. They filter 
out pollutants from rivers and streams 
before they flow into the ocean, and 
they protect inland areas from flood-
ing, with their broad and shallow 
waters able to absorb sudden storm 
surges. 
They are the natural infrastructure 
that protects human communities from 
flooding. And of course, they also help 
the economies of every community 
that relies on fishing and tourism and 
recreation. 
So it is my privilege to play a role in 
protecting and strengthening these 
critical ecosystems and in preserving 
the natural beauty of my State of New 
Jersey. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league on the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee, Congressman 
GRAVES for teaming up with me on this 
bill. Congressman GRAVES is a long-
time champion for the estuarine sys-
tem in his district, and I am glad to 
partner with him. 
I want to thank Congresswoman 
NAPOLITANO for her leadership of the 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Environment 
Subcommittee. I want to thank Con-
gresswoman FLETCHER for her support 
as an original cosponsor, and Congress-
man LARSEN for making the bill even 
stronger, as well as more than two 
dozen of my colleagues, Democrats and 
Republicans alike, who have cospon-
sored this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support as well 
of H.R. 4044, the Protect and Restore 
American’s Estuary Act. 
I also want to thank my colleague 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) for 
introducing this legislation; our chair-
woman, Mrs. NAPOLITANO, Mr. GRAVES, 
and everybody who has worked on this 
outstanding bill that we want to see 
move forward here that has moved for-
ward so many other times. 
H.R. 4044, reauthorizes the National 
Estuary Program which focuses on es-
tuaries of national significance across 
the Nation, including one in my own 
backyard, very literally, the Indian 
River Lagoon, the heart and soul of my 
district. 
Estuaries are not just critical nat-
ural habitats that provide enormous 
economic benefits, but they are a part 
of our way of life for those of us who 
live anywhere near them or around 
them. They are where we go fishing, 
where we see our children recreate and 
wade in the waters. It is where we see 
dolphin and manatee. That is where we 
see people spend their summers, travel 
to come see the blue waters and the 
fish and everything else that thrives in 
those ecosystems. 
The National Estuary Program is 
pivotal to the preservation of these 
very unique ecosystems, and it pro-
vides an enormous return on the tax-
payer’s investment. On average, the es-
tuary program raises $19 for every $1 
provided by the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. 
It is because of this and many other 
reasons that I see on a day-to-day basis 
with the estuaries in my backyard that 
I want to urge support of this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. LARSEN). 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
4044, the Protect and Restore Amer-
ica’s Estuaries Act, a bipartisan piece 
of legislation to reauthorize and im-
prove the National Estuary Program, 
the 
NEP. 
I 
thank 
Representative 
MALINOWSKI for his leadership on pre-
serving our Nation’s estuaries as well. 
Puget Sound, where I am from, is the 
largest estuary by water volume in the 
contiguous United States, and the 
waters and wildlife that call it home 
are one of the cornerstones of north-
west Washington’s environment, cul-
ture, and maritime economy. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Es-
tuary Caucus, I strongly support ef-
forts to ensure robust Federal invest-
ment in the National Estuary Program 
and its vital projects, which is why I 
am proud and very pleased to support 
the Protect and Restore America’s Es-
tuaries Act. This critical legislation 
reauthorizes the National Estuary Pro-
gram through fiscal year 2026 and in-
creases funding for this critical pro-
gram to $50 million annually. 
H.R. 4044 also includes language I au-
thored making clear that NEP com-
petitive funds must be allocated for 
NEP-listed estuaries or projects that 
relate to these estuaries’ coastal resil-
iency. This will help ensure that the 
Environmental Protection Agency fol-
lows congressional intent for NEP dol-
lars to support local estuary restora-
tion projects. 
I look forward to voting for H.R. 4044 
to ensure local communities across the 
country can continue their work to 
protect and restore estuaries. 
On a related note, I also want to rise 
in support of the PUGET SOS Act, 
which will be considered later today. 
Introduced by my colleagues in the 
Washington 
delegation, 
Representa-
tives HECK and KILMER, this bill will 
improve and expand Federal engage-
ment in Puget Sound recovery efforts. 
At a time when the impacts of cli-
mate change threaten coastal commu-
nities throughout the Pacific North-
west and the U.S., endanger iconic spe-
cies such as the southern resident kill-
er whale, and decimate critical habi-
tats, federal engagement and invest-
ment in estuary restoration must be a 
priority. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield such 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congress-
man MAST for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4044, the Protect and Restore Amer-
ica’s Estuaries Act, of which I am a 
proud cosponsor. 
The National Estuary Program is an 
initiative committed to protecting and 
restoring the water quality and eco-
logical integrity of 28 estuaries across 
the country, including the San Juan 
Bay Estuary Program in my congres-
sional district. 
This estuary is the only tropical es-
tuary in the program and the only one 
outside the continental U.S. It also 
provides habitat to 160 species of birds, 
200 species of wetland plants, 124 spe-
cies of fish, and 20 species of amphib-
ians and reptiles, including endangered 
animals such as the Antillean manatee 
and the hawksbill and leatherback tur-
tles. 
The San Juan Bay annually receives 
80 percent of imports for Puerto Rico 
through docks and ports throughout 
the system, playing a crucial role for 
the island’s economy. Last year alone, 
the estuary received 9.5 million visi-
tors, numbers only expected to in-
crease as the island recovers from past 
hurricanes. The estuary aids in flood

prevention for the island’s metropoli-
tan area, which is located within the 
boundaries of the estuary. 
I thank the chairman and the rank-
ing member for bringing this bill for-
ward. Of course, I am going to be for it, 
and I think it is a great initiative not 
just to protect but also care for all our 
wetlands in the Nation. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO.) 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI) for H.R. 4044, the re-
authorization of the very popular Na-
tional Estuary Program, or NEP. It al-
lows more proactive measures to be eli-
gible under the program. 
The strong bipartisan support this 
bill has received is evidence of its wide-
spread popularity and success. I am 
very pleased that several members of 
this committee have all cosponsored 
the bill. The bill represents the com-
mitment to our coastal areas and the 
vital role they play in economic driv-
ers, natural water filters, and protec-
tion from flooding events. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the EPA 
and States to work together to des-
ignate more national estuaries that 
can be eligible for this program, and I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill, 
H.R. 4044. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4044 will have a 
profound impact on districts across 
America. That is a fact. It is why I am 
here to support it today. It includes my 
own district, by increasing public edu-
cation 
and 
awareness 
around 
the 
health conditions of estuaries. 
The Indian River Lagoon I spoke 
about is one of the most biologically 
diverse estuaries in all of North Amer-
ica and a major economic driver for the 
five counties that it borders. The la-
goon faces enormous challenges year 
after year and summer after summer, 
but through the National Estuary Pro-
gram, there has been a pilot-scale dem-
onstration 
of 
seagrass 
restoration, 
which is one of the biggest challenges 
that we face. The destruction of our 
seagrass each year is like a forest fire 
underneath the waters of our estuary. 
Storm water quality improvement 
projects, septic-to-sewer projects, and 
many other projects and initiatives 
that are vital to our estuary are all im-
plemented here. 
With the Protect and Restore Amer-
ica’s Estuaries Act, we will build on 
the enormous success of the National 
Estuary Program. It is why I couldn’t 
be more proud to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support and 
adoption of this bipartisan piece of leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD letters of support 
for H.R. 4044 from the New York-New 
Jersey Harbor and Estuary Program,

DEAR CHAIRMEN DEFAZIO AND NAPOLITANO, 
RANKING MEMBERS YOUNG AND WESTERMAN: 
Thank you for your leadership in support of 
the cooperative conservation and manage-
ment of our nation’s vital estuaries, and in 
particular for the unanimous approval in 
your committee for HR 4044, a bill to reau-
thorize the National Estuary Program. 
This legislation invests directly in the 
stewardship of our nation’s coasts. It empow-
ers local communities in a non-regulatory, 
collaborative and science based strategy to 
safeguard the places where we live, work and 
recreate. The 28 National Estuary Programs 
(NEP) located around the nation’s coastline 
engage industries, businesses, and other 
community members to develop solutions for 
tough problems. The NEP’s public-private 
partnerships stretch federal dollars to pro-
vide successful on-the-ground results driven 
by diverse stakeholders. NEP partners in-
clude wastewater utilities; port authorities, 
shippers, and related maritime industry; 
local restaurants & tourist businesses; de-
sign, engineering and construction profes-
sionals; state and local governments; col-
leges and universities, and community and 
environmental organizations. 
NEPs around the country are extremely ef-
ficient at leveraging funds to increase their 
ability to restore and protect their coastal 
ecosystems. The NEPs have obtained over 
$19 for every $1 provided, generating over $4 
billion for on-the-ground efforts since 2003. 
HR 4044 would amplify and improve on the 
reforms signed into law in the 114th Congress 
that created a competitive program to ad-
dress urgent challenges while streamlining 
the administrative costs of the program. 
PROGRESS ON THE GROUND 
NEPs have collectively restored and pro-
tected more than 2,000,000 acres of vital habi-
tats since 2000 alone. Consistent Congres-
sional funding of the National Estuary Pro-
grams is essential—resulting in clean water, 
healthy estuaries, and strong coastal com-
munities. This investment in our national 
estuaries will help strengthen America’s 
economy and support thousands of jobs, and 
will secure the future of our coastal commu-
nities. 
Here in New York and New Jersey, we can 
report on how funds already invested in this 
program are being put to extremely good 
purpose in protecting and restoring estuaries 
and coastal communities: 
Working with communities in the Bronx, 
Harlem, Passaic, and Hackensack River wa-
tersheds to track down sources of floatable 
trash before they enter the water; 
Helping local governments in New Jersey 
and New York identify and right-size cul-
verts and bridges to improve habitat and re-
duce street flooding; 
Working with wastewater utilities in Eliz-
abeth and Ridgefield Park to prioritize and 
make critical investments in outfalls needed 
to address rising sea levels; 
Restoring shoreline ecology and improving 
fisheries in the Hudson and East River by 
creating oyster reefs and other restoration 
efforts 
The value of our oceans, estuaries and 
coasts to our nation is immense, and has 
never been more important. Over half the US 
population lives in coastal watershed coun-
ties, many of these in estuaries of national 
significance. Roughly half the nation’s gross 
domestic product is generated in those coun-
ties and adjacent ocean waters. According to 
NOAA’s 2019 report on the ocean economy, 
ocean industries contributed $320 billion to 
U.S. economy, while employment in the 
ocean economy increased by 14.5 percent by 
2016, compared to 4.8 percent in the U.S. 
economy as a whole. 
Thank you again for your efforts to ad-
vance this visionary legislation and look for-
ward to working with you to reauthorize this 
successful program. 
Sincerely,

Thank you for your leadership in support of 
the National Estuary Program, and in par-
ticular for your unanimous approval in your 
committee for HR 4044, a bill to reauthorize 
this highly successful program. I understand 
this bill may be considered by the full House 
of Representatives, and applaud your efforts 
to advance this legislation. We at the 
Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Pro-
gram strongly applaud the leadership of Rep-
resentative Graves to advance this legisla-
tion to address Louisiana’s land loss crisis. 
Funding from this program empowers local 
people and their ongoing love of the land, 
water, culture, and each other to use the 
best 
science 
available 
to 
address 
the 
estuary’s perils. 
This legislation invests directly in the 
stewardship of our nation’s coasts. It empow-
ers local communities in a non-regulatory, 
collaborative and science-based strategy to 
safeguard the places where we live, work, 
and recreate. Of all federally funded coastal 
programs, only NEPs organize local stake-
holders as partners in a unique decision- 
making framework to address local prior-
ities. NEPs provide technical, management, 
and communication assistance to develop 
priorities and implement comprehensive ac-
tions: 
storm 
water 
and 
infrastructure 
projects, seagrass and shellfish restoration

NEPS: PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERS 
The NEP consists of 28 unique, voluntary 
programs established by the Clean Water Act 
to protect and improve estuaries of national 
significance. Each NEP engages its local 
community in a non-regulatory, consensus- 
driven, and science-based process. For every 
federal dollar, NEPs collectively leverage $19 
in local funds to protect and improve coastal 
environments, communities, and economies. 
This investment in our national estuaries 
strengthens America’s economy and supports 
thousands of jobs, and will secure the future 
of our coastal communities. 
NEPs engage industries, businesses, and 
other community members to develop solu-
tions for tough problems. NEP’s public-pri-
vate partnerships stretch federal dollars to 
provide on-the ground results driven by di-
verse stakeholders. NEP partners include 
commercial agriculture and fisheries, energy 
and water utilities, local businesses, con-
struction 
and 
landscaping 
professionals, 
state and local governments, academic insti-
tutions, and community groups. 
The value of our oceans, estuaries and 
coasts to our nation is immense. Over half 
the U.S. population lives in coastal water-
shed counties. Roughly half the nation’s 
gross domestic product is generated in those 
counties and adjacent ocean waters. In 2019 
alone, ocean industries contributed $320 bil-
lion to U.S. economy. 
RESULTS ON THE GROUND 
NEPs have had great success in protecting 
and restoring estuaries and coastal commu-
nities: 
The Barataria-Terrebonne National Estu-
ary Program (BTNEP) is restoring maritime 
forest ridges along coastal Louisiana with 
public and private partnerships. These ridges 
are vital habitat for wildlife and provide 
storm surge protection for business, indus-
try, and homeowners. 
Morro Bay National Estuary Program is 
restoring underwater eelgrass meadows after 
precipitous decline in the last decade. Prom-
ising restoration results show that collabo-
rative research, community outreach, and 
adaptive management make a difference for 
healthy estuary habitats on the California’s 
Central Coast. 
All three California National Estuary Pro-
grams are partnering to improve the status 
and use of resources for boaters to pump out 
waste from their boats. These stations are 
critical to keeping bacteria and other pollu-
tion from entering sensitive coastal waters. 
The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is 
working with the Bronx River Alliance and 
other community groups to track down 
sources of floatable trash in the River. 
The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware 
is bringing the oyster back, using living 
shorelines to stop erosion, protect property 
and restore habitat. 
NEPs have collectively restored and pro-
tected more than 2,000,000 acres of vital habi-
tats since 2000 alone. 
Important reforms were made to the Na-
tional Estuary Program in the reauthoriza-
tion during the 114th Congress, including the 
creation of a competitive program to address 
urgent challenges and the streamlining of 
administrative costs. HR 4044 amplifies and 
improves on these reforms. We thank you 
again for your efforts to advance this vision-
ary legislation and look forward to working 
with you to reauthorize this successful pro-
gram. 
Sincerely, 
DEAN BLANCHARD, 
BTNEP Acting Director.

DEAR CHAIRMEN DEFAZIO AND NAPOLITANO, 
RANKING MEMBERS YOUNG AND WESTERMAN: I 
am writing to thank you for your leadership 
in support of the National Estuary Program 
(NEP). For over 30 years, NEPs have ad-
vanced national priorities through a place- 
based, 
non-regulatory, 
collaborative 
ap-
proach. NEP’s promote efficient partnerships 
to achieve on-the-ground success, engaging 
industries, businesses, local communities, 
scientists, regulatory agencies and other 
stakeholders. 
Communities and businesses depend on our 
nation’s estuaries. Loss of coastal habitats, 
pollutants entering our waters, and in-
creased coastal flooding are challenging our 
coasts and affecting the critical economies 
we rely on. Over 82% of the nation’s popu-
lation live in the coastal areas that NEPs di-
rectly support. The 28 NEPs are leading the 
way in using a non-regulatory approach to 
working with industry and communities on 
innovations to protect life, business, and 
property from loss, damage, flooding, and 
drought. 
NEPs leverage federal funds to build the 
capacity of local partners to implement in-
novative and beneficial projects. For every 
dollar EPA provides, NEPs leverage $19 in 
local funds to protect and improve coastal 
environments, communities and economies. 
Recent examples of NEP successes include: 
The San Francisco Estuary Partnership is 
collaborating with wastewater treatment fa-
cilities to advance innovative nature-based 
solutions along the shoreline to remove con-
taminants, secure potable water resources, 
increase flood protection, and restore habi-
tat 
All three California National Estuary Pro-
grams are partnering to reduce raw sewage 
disposal into the water from recreational 
boats, keeping bacteria and other pollution 
from entering coastal waters and threat-
ening public health

is bringing the oyster back, with all its eco-
logical and economic benefits, after it nearly 
disappeared in the last century. The Center

DEAR CHAIRMEN DEFAZIO AND NAPOLITANO, 
RANKING MEMBERS YOUNG AND WESTERMAN: 
Thank you for your leadership in support of 
the National Estuary Program, and in par-
ticular for your unanimous approval in your 
committee for HR 4044, a bill to reauthorize 
this highly successful program. I understand 
this bill may be considered by the full House 
of Representatives, and applaud your efforts 
to advance this legislation. 
In particular I would like to recognize and 
applaud the leadership of Representative 
Larson on this issue. He has been a stalwart 
supporter of this program nationally, and in 
particular a champion of Puget Sound. I ap-
preciate his efforts as a senior member of 
your committee to advance this legislation 
that is so important to Washington. 
Puget Sound is a complex ecosystem en-
compassing mountains, farmlands, cities, 
rivers, forests, and wetlands. Sixteen major 
rivers flow to Puget Sound and 20 treaty 
tribes call the region home. Currently, 4.5 
million people live in the Puget Sound area, 
with another 1.3 million expected to live here 
by 2040. Seattle was the second fastest grow-
ing city in the nation in 2018, and the fastest 
in 2017. We are a region of innovators and en-
trepreneurs: 11 Fortune 500 companies are 
are headquartered in the Puget Sound area, 
many of which have shaped 21st century life. 
Our economy is roaring, and the region’s 
natural beauty and recreational opportuni-
ties help businesses and companies attract 
top talent. 
On the surface, Puget Sound looks healthy 
and inviting, but, in fact, Puget Sound is in 
grave trouble. Southern Resident orcas, Chi-
nook salmon, and steelhead are all listed 
under the Endangered Species Act. Toxic 
chemicals and pharmaceuticals continue to 
pollute our waterways, and shellfish beds are 
routinely closed to commercial and rec-
reational harvest due to fecal contamina-
tion. Habitat degradation continues to out-
pace restoration. While this situation at 
times seems impossibly gloomy, the hun-
dreds of passionate people who are devoted 
to seeing the return of a healthy and resil-
ient Puget Sound give us hope. 
Scientists say that we can still recover 
Puget Sound, but only if we act boldly now. 
We know what we need to do. The primary 
barriers between us and more food for orcas, 
clean and sufficient water for people and 
fish, sustainable working lands, and harvest-
able shellfish are funding and political for-
titude. 
The single greatest step we could take to 
ensure a durable, systematic, and science- 
based effort for Puget Sound recovery is to 
fully fund the implementation of habitat 
protection and restoration, water quality 
protection, and salmon recovery programs. 
The National Estuary Program (NEP) is a 
vital piece of this funding puzzle. 
Of all federally funded coastal programs, 
only NEPs organize local stakeholders as

nication assistance to develop priorities and 
implement 
comprehensive 
actions: 
stormwater 
and

seagrass and shellfish restoration which sup-
port fishing and tourist industries, science 
and monitoring to guide decision-making, 
and innovative education programs designed

local funds to protect and improve coastal 
environments, communities and economies. 
NEPs have collectively restored and pro-
tected more than 2,000,000 acres of vital habi-
tats since 2000 alone. Consistent Congres-
sional funding of the National Estuary Pro-
grams is essential resulting in clean water, 
healthy estuaries, and strong coastal com-
munities. This investment in our national 
estuaries will help strengthen America’s 
economy and support thousands of jobs, and 
will secure the future of our coastal commu-
nities. 
Thank you for your strong support of this 
program over the years. Funds already in-
vested in this program are being put to ex-
tremely good purpose in protecting and re-
storing estuaries and coastal communities. 
Recent examples include the following: 
Our partners are restoring forage fish 
spawning, which is critically important in 
the Puget Sound food web—back to large 
areas of shoreline, and reducing the flow of 
stormwater containing toxic pollutants into 
Puget Sound. 
The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is 
working with the Bronx River Alliance and 
other community groups to track down 
sources of floatable trash in the River, in-
cluding locations in upstream Westchester 
County. 
The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership in 
Maine, along with partners, is monitoring 
nutrients around Casco Bay to provide real- 
time data on nutrient processes. CBEP’s nu-
trient analyzer has been automatically col-
lecting nitrate, nitrite and ammonium sam-
ples and working collaboratively to assure 
safe levels in the bay. 
The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware 
is bringing the oyster back, with all its eco-
logical and economic benefits, after it nearly 
disappeared in the last century. The Center 
is using living shorelines to stop erosion, 
protect property and restore habitat. 
As you know, important reforms were 
made to the National Estuary Program 
(NEP) in the reauthorization that was signed 
into law in the 114th Congress. These reforms 
created a competitive program to address ur-
gent challenges and maximize funds received 
by our national estuaries, while streamlining 
the administrative costs of the program. 
HR 4044 would amplify and improve on 
these reforms, and continue the cost-effec-
tive streamlining begun in the 114th Con-
gress. 
We are running out of time: the Center for 
Whale Research reported this weekend that 
another Southern Resident orca, L41, has 
gone missing. With its loss, the population 
will drop to 72 animals, the lowest in 40 
years. Your action now to pass HR 4044 can 
help.

am writing to thank you for your leadership 
in support of the National Estuary Program, 
and in particular for your unanimous ap-
proval in your committee for HR 4044, a bill 
to reauthorize this highly successful pro-
gram. I also like to recognize the efforts of 
California Representatives Salud Carbajal, 
Harley Rouda, and Eric Swalwell for their 
co-sponsorship of this bill. We understand 
this bill may be considered by the full House 
of Representatives and applaud your efforts 
to advance this legislation. 
The National Estuary Program consists of 
28, voluntary and geographically specific 
partnerships to promote the vitality of the 
United States Estuaries of National Signifi-
cance. Each NEP engages its local commu-
nity in a non-regulatory, consensus-driven, 
and science-based process. For every dollar 
EPA provides, NEPs leverage $19 in local 
funds to protect and improve coastal envi-
ronments, communities, and economies. 
NEPs provide a suite of skills to advance 
the technical, management, and communica-
tion needs of their consensus driven Com-
prehensive Conservation and Management 
Plans. These plans seek to implement co-
ordinated actions such as: storm water and 
infrastructure projects, seagrass, dune, wet-
land, and shellfish restoration, and the con-
servation of open spaces. NEPs also support 
and conduct scientific monitoring to identify 
and address sources of environmental harm 
that are detrimental to public health and 
coastal economies. 
NEPs engage industries, businesses, and 
other community members to develop solu-
tions for tough problems. The NEPs’ public- 
private partnerships stretch federal dollars 
to provide successful on-the-ground results 
driven by diverse stakeholders. NEP partners 
include commercial agriculture and fish-
eries, energy and water utilities, local res-
taurants & tourist businesses, construction 
and landscaping professionals, engineering 
and mining companies, state and local gov-
ernments, colleges and universities, and 
other community organizations. 
The value of our oceans, estuaries and 
coasts to our nation is immense. According 
to NOAA’s 2019 report on the ocean economy, 
ocean industries contributed $320 billion to 
U.S. economy, while employment in the 
ocean economy increased by 14.5 percent by 
2016, compared to 4.8 percent in the U.S. 
economy as a whole. NEPs work to protect 
and enhance these nationally significant 
economic engines. 
Thank you for your strong support of this 
program over the years. Funds already in-
vested in this program are being put to ex-
tremely good purpose in protecting and re-
storing estuaries and coastal communities. 
Recent examples include: 
The Santa Monica Bay National Estuary 
Program has restored 51.9 acres of kelp for-
est, off the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the 
past six years. This restoration effort has 
helped reverse an 80% decline in this vital 
ecosystem which supports several of Califor-
nia’s most lucrative fisheries and allows for 
the recovery of endangered abalone. 
The Puget Sound Partnership is restoring 
forage fish spawning—which are critically 
important in the Puget Sound foodweb— 
back to large areas of shoreline and reducing 
the flow of stormwater containing toxic pol-
lutants into Puget Sound. 
The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is 
working with the Bronx River Alliance and 
other community groups to track down 
sources of floatable trash in the River, in-
cluding locations in upstream Westchester 
County. 
The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership in 
Maine, along with partners, is monitoring 
nutrients around Casco Bay to provide real- 
time data on nutrient processes. CBEP’s nu-
trient analyzer has been automatically col-
lecting nitrate, nitrite and ammonium sam-
ples and working collaboratively to assure 
safe levels in the bay. 
As you know important reforms were made 
to the National Estuary Program in the re-
authorization that was signed into law in the 
114th Congress. These reforms created a com-
petitive program to address urgent chal-
lenges and maximize funds received by our 
national estuaries, while streamlining the 
administrative costs of the program. HR 4044 
would amplify and improve on these reforms, 
and continue the cost-effective streamlining 
begun in the 114th Congress. 
Thank you again for your visionary leader-
ship, and that of the three California Rep-
resentatives Salud Carbajal, Harley Rouda, 
and Eric Swalwell who have cosponsored this 
bill to reauthorize this successful program.

thorize this highly successful program. I un-
derstand this bill may be considered by the

your efforts to support this legislation. 
The NEP stands out as one of the most ef-
fective federal programs. The National Pro-
gram creates a framework—and account-
ability—for local partners, representing di-
verse interests to address the physical, 
chemical, social, biological, economic and 
cultural challenges that threaten our na-
tion’s estuaries. It is this collaborative 
framework that allows NEPs to tackle issues 
that no agency or state can tackle alone.

February 5, 2020 
Of all federally funded coastal programs, 
only NEPs implement a community-based 
decision framework to address local and na-
tional priorities. NEPs and their partners ad-
dress: 
Stormwater and infrastructure projects; 
Eelgrass and shellfish restoration, sup-
porting aquaculture, fishing, and tourist in-
dustries; 
Land and wildlife conservation; 
Science and monitoring to guide decision- 
making; and 
Innovative education programs designed 
for the next generation of Americans. 
The NEP consists of 28 unique, voluntary

lems. 
NEP’s

The value of our oceans, estuaries and

shed counties. Roughly half the nation’s 
gross domestic product is generated in those 
counties and adjacent ocean waters. In 2019 
alone, ocean industries contributed $320 bil-
lion to U.S. economy. 
RESULTS ON THE GROUND 
NEPs are focused on results on the ground 
and have had great success in protecting and 
restoring estuaries and coastal communities: 
In the lower Columbia River since 2000, we 
have: 
Restored 28,387 acres of habitat with 100 
partners to help recover threatened and en-
dangered fish. 
Provided 81,485 students with over 407,704 
hours of outdoor science learning, helping 
teachers meet benchmarks, and fill in gaps 
in science education. 
Planted 144,721 native trees along riparian 
corridors with students and volunteers of all 
ages. 
Raised more than $76 million—100% of 
those funds stay in Oregon and Washington 
addressing local priorities. These are monies 
local entities cannot access on their own and 
we can’t raise without the NEP funds. 
Leverage $11.5 million in federal NEP funds 
to bring a total of $76 million to our region, 
100% spent in Oregon and Washington. 
Generated 1,524 family wage jobs, mostly 
in construction, restoring habitat, that can-
not be exported. 
These results are repeated around the na-
tion in each of the 28 national estuary pro-
grams: 
Morro Bay National Estuary Program is 
restoring underwater eelgrass meadows after 
a precipitous decline in the last decade. 
Promising restoration results show that col-
laborative research, community outreach, 
and adaptive management make a difference 
for healthy estuary habitats on the Califor-
nia’s Central Coast. 
All three California National Estuary Pro-
grams are partnering to improve the status 
and use of resources for boaters to pump out 
waste from their boats. These stations are 
critical to keeping bacteria and other pollu-
tion from entering sensitive coastal waters. 
The NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program is 
working with the Bronx River Alliance and 
other community groups to track down 
sources of floatable trash in the River. 
The Center of the Inland Bays in Delaware 
is bringing the oyster back, using living 
shorelines to stop erosion, protect property 
and restore habitat. 
NEPs have collectively restored and pro-
tected more than 2,000,000 acres of vital habi-
tats since 2000 alone. 
Important reforms were made to the Na-
tional Estuary Program in the reauthoriza-
tion during the 114th Congress, including the 
creation of a competitive program to address 
urgent challenges and the streamlining of 
administrative costs. HR 4044 amplifies and 
improves on these reforms. 
Despite these great outcomes, threats to 
our waters and our communities remain. 
Toxics from stormwater contaminate clean 
water and habitat and cause cancer and neu-
rological damage to humans and river spe-
cies. Changes in precipitation, temperature, 
and storminess increase sea levels, increase 
erosion, and intensify flood events, leaving 
many of our rural communities and much 
our local infrastructure vulnerable to these 
variabilities. Micro plastics are pervasive in 
our rivers and streams; they are filling the 
bellies of ocean species and impair human 
immune systems, disrupt hormones, and 
cause cancer. Disparities in education and 
lack of opportunities for hands-on outdoor 
learning exist for too many in our commu-
nities. 
We thank you again for your efforts to ad-
vance this legislation and look forward to 
working with you to reauthorize this suc-
cessful program. 
Sincerely yours, 
DEBRAH MARRIOTT, 
Executive Director. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port 
H.R. 
4044. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI and Chairwoman NAPOLITANO for 
their leadership in crafting this legislation and 
bringing it to the floor today for consideration 
by the full House of Representatives. It is vital 
that we, as a nation, focus on preserving and 
restoring our estuaries. 
I am especially pleased that the bill almost 
doubles the amount of funding available to 
support national estuaries. This should finally 
allow the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to move forward with adding more of 
these critical ecosystems to the National Estu-
ary Program. 
As one of only five or six hypersaline la-
goons in the world and the only one in the na-
tion, the Laguna Madre has unique conserva-
tion requirements. Adjacent to the longest bar-
rier island in the world, Padre Island, the La-
guna Madre is home to five species of endan-
gered sea turtle and a critical migratory bird 
habitat for dozens of endangered or threat-
ened bird species. The EPA previously des-
ignated the Upper Laguna Madre as a national 
estuary, and with this additional funding, we 
can now move forward with adding the Lower 
Laguna Madre to the existing designation. 
Having grown up in Brownsville, Texas, 
Chairwoman Napolitano knows the beauty and 
importance of this national treasure. On behalf 
of my constituents, I want to express the grati-
tude of South Texas for the hard work and 
dedication of the Transportation & Infrastruc-
ture Committee Members and staff to con-
serving the Lower Laguna Madre for future 
generations. 
I look forward to working with our Senators 
to help pass this legislation, and with our local 
officials, especially Cameron County Commis-
sioner David Garza, and our governor, so we 
can finally secure a National Estuary Program 
designation for the Lower Laguna Madre. I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4044. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H.R. 4044, the Protect and Restore 
America’s Estuaries Act. As Co-Chair of the 
Congressional Estuary Caucus, I am pleased 
to support this bill to reauthorize the National 
Estuary Program through Fiscal Year 2026. 
The Lower Columbia Estuary Partnership, in 
my home state of Oregon, is one of the twen-
ty-eight National Estuary Programs across the 
country. The Lower Columbia Estuary Partner-
ship is leading outstanding resiliency efforts in 
the Pacific Northwest to restore and protect 
habitat, improve water quality, restore flood 
plains, and address marine debris. This bill will 
help the National Estuary Programs consider 
the effects of extreme weather events that are 
increasingly common in the climate crisis, and 
implement appropriate adaptation strategies in 
their management plans. Additionally, this bill 
takes important steps to allow the NEPs to 
better address storm water runoff, coastal re-
siliency, and accelerate land loss mitigation ef-
forts. This past weekend, we celebrated World 
Wetlands Day. Our coastal wetlands and estu-
aries are often overlooked and undervalued, 
but they are on the frontlines of the climate 
crisis. We can help support and safeguard our 
National Estuary Programs by passing the 
Protect and Restore America’s Estuaries Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4044, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO) and the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1132, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1132. Introduced by the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER), H.R. 1132 
builds off existing bay restoration 
work under EPA’s National Estuary 
Program. 
In my home State of California, the 
importance of a healthy watershed and 
improved water quality has never been 
more apparent. In fact, the San Fran-
cisco Bay estuary drains more than 40 
percent of our State’s waters. 
That is why I am thankful to see sev-
eral of my colleagues from California 
as original cosponsors, including mem-
bers 
of 
this 
committee: 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI, Mr. HUFFMAN, and Mr. 
DESAULNIER. 
At 
our 
June 
hearing, 
the 
sub-
committee learned about the ongoing 
sources of pollution to this 1,600- 
square-mile estuary. Simultaneously, 
habitat 
destruction 
has 
forever 
changed the geography of the bay area. 
More than 90 percent of shoreline wet-
lands and 40 percent of the total aquat-
ic ecosystem have been lost. 
This new EPA program office will 
concentrate Federal efforts to address 
water 
quality 
challenges 
and 
eco-
system health in the bay. This will im-
prove the environment and economy 
for the bay area region that is home to 
8 million people and an annual GDP of 
$775 billion. 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1132, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters in support of H.R. 1132, the San 
Francisco Bay Restoration Act, from 
the National Audubon Society and 
Save the Bay.

AUDUBON, 
September 18, 2019. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SAM GRAVES, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
Hon. GRACE NAPOLITANO, 
Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Water Resources 
and Environment, Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Re-
sources and Environment, Washington, DC. 
On behalf of the National Audubon Soci-
ety’s more than 1 million members, our mis-
sion is to protect birds and the places they 
need for today and tomorrow. We write to 
offer our support for the following bills re-
lated to important coastal and water con-
servation issues that will be the subject of 
the September 19, 2019 Markup before the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee. 
HR 4031—GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE 
ACT OF 2019 
The Great Lakes are home to 30 million 
people and 350 species of birds, but increasing 
challenges are on the horizon for the world’s 
largest body of freshwater. Fluctuating 
water levels exacerbated by climate change, 
invasive exotic species and excess nutrients 
are putting even more stress on this eco-
system that is so important for birds and 
people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive has helped clean up toxic pollutants, 
protect wildlife by restoring critical habitat, 
and help combat devastating invasive spe-
cies. 
HR 4031 would increase funding for con-
servation projects to $475 million over five 
years, by increasing the Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative’s authorization incremen-
tally from $300 million per year to $475 mil-
lion per year. 
HR 1132—SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION ACT 
The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the 
Pacific Coast’s largest estuary, is also home 
to a rapidly growing population of 8 million 
people, and provides for a host of social and 
economic values through ports and industry, 
agriculture, fisheries, archaeological and 
cultural sites, recreation, and research. How-
ever, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its 
tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its 
eelgrass 
and 
mudflat 
habitat. 
Climate 
change exacerbates these conditions through 
drought that alters the salinity balance, 
ocean acidification that reduces species 
abundance and diversity, increasing water 
temperatures, and rising seas causing flood-
ing that eliminates living shorelines and 
puts communities at risk. Many species of 
waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay, 
including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, un-
derscoring the value of this ecosystem. 
HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco 
Bay Restoration Grant Program in EPA and 
funding of up to $25m per year to support the 
restoration of this estuary. 
HR 1620—CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Salt marshes are special places to birds 
and other wildlife, but sea level rise has ele-
vated the waters in the Chesapeake Bay by 
one foot during the 20th century and is accel-
erating due to climate change. Salt marshes 
provide valuable ‘‘ecosystem services’’, in-
cluding nurseries for the Chesapeake Bay’s 
commercially important fish, a buffer pro-
tecting coastal communities against storm 
surge, a filter that stops nutrient and sedi-
ment pollution from entering the Bay, and a 
recreational resource attracting visitors who 
contribute millions of dollars to local econo-
mies. Chesapeake Bay’s salt marshes host 
globally significant populations of both 
Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail. 
HR 1620 would increase the authorization 
of appropriations for the Chesapeake Bay 
Program to more than $90m per year. 
HR 2247—PROMOTING UNITED GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO SAVE OUR SOUND ACT 
Despite significant investments in Puget 
Sound ecosystem health by state, federal, 
tribal and local governments, concerned 
members of the public, and conservation or-
ganizations, progress towards ecosystem re-
covery targets remains slow. The number of 
marine birds wintering in Puget Sound has 
declined significantly in the last 30 years and 
migratory, fisheating birds appear to be at 
the greatest risk. 
HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million 
in funding for Puget Sound recovery. The 
PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal agency 
expertise and resources, ensuring that fed-
eral agencies are coordinated, setting goals, 
and holding each other accountable will help 
increase their effectiveness and provide a 
boost to Puget Sound recovery. 
HR 3779—RESILIENCE REVOLVING LOAN FUND ACT 
OF 2019 
Pre-disaster planning can help commu-
nities adapt to the changing flood patterns 
that threaten people and birds species de-
pendent on shoreline and riverine areas. 
These changes have led to more frequent in-
stances of ‘‘nuisance flooding,’’ as well as 
catastrophic events. NOAA has found that 
‘‘nuisance’’ or ‘‘sunny day’’ flooding is up 
300% to 900% than it was 50 years ago. In ad-
dition, catastrophic flooding events have in-
creased in both frequency and intensity. 
These trends have been particularly pro-
nounced in the Northeast, Midwest and 
upper Great Plains, where the amount of pre-
cipitation in large rainfall events has in-
creased more than 30 percent above the aver-
age observed from 1901–1960. As sea level rise 
accelerates, it only exacerbates these im-
pacts, which further compounds vulner-
ability in flood-prone communities. 
HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act 
to offer low-interest loans to states for ‘‘dis-
aster mitigation projects’’, including invest-
ments in natural infrastructure projects, 
which would help communities prepare and 
recover from natural disasters. 
We urge you to support and advance the 
bills listed above. Please feel free to contact 
us with any questions. 
Sincerely, 
JULIE HILL-GABRIEL, 
Vice President, Water Conservation, 
National Audubon Society. 
SAVE THE BAY, 
February 3, 2020. 
Hon. JACKIE SPEIER, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
HR 1132: SUPPORT 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE SPEIER: Save The 
Bay applauds your introduction of HR 1132, 
the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act, and 
encourages all Members of Congress to vote 
for its passage on the House Floor this week. 
This initiative will enhance the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s efforts ca-
pacity to improve the health of San Fran-
cisco Bay, with resources that are des-
perately needed at a time of accelerating cli-
mate change. 
Save The Bay is the oldest and largest 
membership organization working exclu-
sively to protect and restore San Francisco 
Bay, with 50,000 members and supporters. As 
the Bay’s leading champion since 1961, Save 
The Bay is committed to making the Bay 
cleaner and healthier for people and wildlife, 
and HR 1132 would significantly advance that 
goal. 
Over the last 150 years, the water quality 
and health of the San Francisco Bay estuary 
have been diminished by pollution, invasive 
species, loss of wetland habitat and other 
factors. Improving bay water quality, restor-
ing critical habitat, and adapting to climate 
change in San Francisco Bay, are urgent fed-
eral, state and regional priorities that re-
quire additional funding. The Bay region is 
fortunate to have in place well-developed 
science-based plans, agencies, and collabo-
rative structures to improve the Bay’s 
health, but more resources for implementa-
tion are essential in the crucial decade 
ahead. The San Francisco Bay Restoration 
Act would provide significant additional ca-
pacity to improve the Bay, building effi-
ciently on elements already in place to im-
prove our economy and the region’s quality 
of life. 
In 2016, San Francisco Bay Area voters 
agreed to make an unprecedented invest-
ment in San Francisco Bay Restoration, ap-
proving a nine-county parcel tax specifically 
to accelerate Bay tidal marsh restoration. 
Measure AA was approved by more than 70 
percent of the region’s voters, and is raising 
$500 million over 20 years for grants to res-
toration projects, most of which are occur-
ring on federal property with the San Fran-
cisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Match-
ing federal investment for this and other res-
toration work is overdue, and HR 1132 would 
begin to address that need by authorizing $25 
million annually for those purposes. 
HR 1132 also would address the inequity in 
funding for U.S. EPA Geographic Programs, 
which are annually providing orders of mag-
nitude higher funding to other national estu-
aries under strong statutory authority with-
in the Clean Water Act. San Francisco Bay 
deserves similar support and commitment as 
the federal government currently provides to 
Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound and other lo-
cations, and HR 1132 begins to rectify that 
disparity. 
Each month provides evidence of added ur-
gency and need for the San Francisco Bay 
Program and resources that HR 1132 creates. 
Tidal marsh restoration is essential to pro-
tect Bay wildlife habitat, and adjacent 
shoreline communities and infrastructure 
from sea level rise. The recent Baylands 
Habitat Goals Update underscored that tidal 
marsh revegetation must be initiated wher-
ever possible within the next decade to stay 
ahead of rising seas, and the recent Cali-
fornia Legislative Analyst’s Office report 
further underscores the urgency of adapta-
tion and resilience actions. And as California 
Governor Gavin Newsom stated in January, 
‘‘We are experiencing a global climate crisis. 
One that has irreversible impacts and is hap-
pening right now. This is not something to 
deal with 10 years from now. Or 5 years from 
now. Or 2 years from now. we need action. 
Now.’’ 
We deeply appreciate the strong support 
from Speaker Pelosi and the entire San 
Francisco Bay delegation for HR 1132. We en-
courage the House of Representatives pass 
this bill swiftly, and we pledge our continued 
assistance toward its enactment. Thank you 
again for your leadership! 
Sincerely, 
DAVID LEWIS, 
Executive Director. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of 
H.R. 1132. It represents good govern-
ance by codifying the EPA’s existing 
work in the San Francisco Bay Area.

mary source of drinking water for over

25 million people and irrigation for 
7,000 square miles of agriculture. It in-
cludes important economic resources, 
such as water supply infrastructure, 
ports, deepwater shipping channels, 
major highway and railway corridors, 
and energy lines. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, today, we 
are taking up the San Francisco Bay 
Restoration Act. This is legislation I 
have introduced every year since 2010. 
Since then, the environmental condi-
tions of the bay have only grown worse. 
The bay is the heart of the region, 
with a vibrant ecosystem that is home 
to the largest estuary on the West 
Coast. It generates more than $370 bil-
lion in goods and services annually and 
is home to more than 31⁄2 million jobs. 
Forty percent of the land in Cali-
fornia drains to the estuary, as my col-
leagues have mentioned. It also is 
home to more than 100 endangered and 
threatened species. The region’s tidal 
and seasonal wetlands comprise a sig-
nificant portion of America’s coastal 
resources, yet over the past 200 years, 
90 percent of the bay’s wetlands have 
been destroyed by human activity. 
Increased pollution from cars, homes, 
and communities in San Francisco 
have absorbed into various creeks, riv-
ers, and streams that flow into the bay 
and the Pacific Ocean. By 2030, the ex-
pected sea-level rise in the bay area 
will exceed the rate at which the 
marshes can elevate and move, effec-
tively drowning them. 
Despite the impending threats, Fed-
eral efforts for bay restoration and pol-
lution mitigation systems have failed 
to meet the enormous need. Between 
2008 and 2016, EPA’s geographic pro-
grams invested only $45 million into 
the San Francisco Bay, while Puget 
Sound received over $260 million and 
Chesapeake Bay $490 million. That is 10 
times as much, and the disparity be-
comes even more pronounced when you 
consider the populations served. A 
mere $6 was spent on the bay for each 
resident of the bay area, while almost 
$30 was spent for each resident living 
near Chesapeake Bay and almost $60 
per resident near Puget Sound. 
In the most recent round of appro-
priations in early 2018, the San Fran-
cisco Bay’s appropriations remained at 
$4.8 million while smaller geographic 
programs received substantially more, 
including Lake Champlain with $8.3 
million and Long Island Sound with $12 
million. 
The San Francisco Bay Restoration 
Act will authorize $25 million annually 
for 5 years to fund water quality im-
provement efforts, wetland and estuary 
restoration, endangered species recov-
ery, and adaption to climate change. 
We are just asking for our fair share of 
the dollars set aside for estuary res-
toration.

Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN). 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding me time, 
and I commend my colleague, JACKIE 
SPEIER, for her leadership on this issue. 
And thanks also to the ranking mem-
ber for recognizing the importance, the 
critical national importance, of the 
San Francisco Bay Estuary. 
I have the fortune of representing a 
beautiful district that starts at the Or-
egon border but goes all the way down 
to the Golden Gate Bridge. That means 
I represent a good portion of San Fran-
cisco Bay, the North Bay, where we un-
derstand all too well how much we 
have lost—90 percent of the Bay’s wet-
lands have been destroyed. 
Starting a century and-a-half ago, 
there has been incredible degradation 
of this vital estuary beginning with the 
Gold Rush, continuing to massive 
water diversions and pollution inputs, 
the diking of wetlands, and so on. But 
despite all of that degradation, San 
Francisco Bay continues to play a vital 
role ecologically in our region and an 
even greater role economically. 
We have hundreds of billions of dol-
lars in economic activity every year as 
a product of San Francisco Bay—out-
door recreation, commercial and rec-
reational fishing, travel and tourism. 
And we also see the very real benefits 
in the San Francisco Bay area of coast-
al resiliency, using natural systems as 
a buffer against rising sea levels. 
The citizens of the nine-county Bay 
area have stepped up. We recognize the 
national importance of this resource, 
and we have supported a ballot meas-
ure to support climate adaption and 
restoration funding. And now it is time 
for the Federal Government to do its 
part. That is why I am so pleased to 
support Congresswoman SPEIER’s bill, 
the San Francisco Bay Restoration 
Act, to provide the much-needed Fed-
eral partnership to help improve water 
quality in this important estuary to re-
vive the Bay’s wetlands and to protect 
our coastal communities and our econ-
omy. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for the time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
do urge all my colleagues to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HECK). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. NAPOLITANO) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 1132, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2247, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2247 would estab-
lish a new program office within EPA 
to enhance rehabilitation efforts for 
Puget Sound in Washington State. In-
troduced by the gentlemen from Wash-
ington, Mr. HECK and Mr. KILMER, H.R. 
2247 builds off an existing program for 
the Sound under EPA’s National Estu-
ary Program. 
The bill authorizes $50 million annu-
ally over 5 years to establish a Puget 
Sound Federal Leadership Task Force 
that will be responsible for coordi-
nating the wide-ranging priorities for 
recovery of the region. 
We heard in our subcommittee hear-
ing in June that human development 
has degraded the water quality and 
habitat of the Sound. We need to do 
more to protect our iconic waters, like 
Puget Sound, on which 4.5 million peo-
ple rely for food, clean water, and other 
ecosystem services. 
We also know that the health of 
these waterways impacts critical spe-
cies, such as salmon and the orca 
whales and a variety of other wildlife 
across the State. The Sound has been a 
member of the National Estuary Pro-
gram since 1988, engaging in a wide 
range of habitat protection, water 
quality improvement and monitoring, 
but a recent GAO study found that the 
threat the Sound faces outpace efforts 
to combat them. In short, we must sup-
port a more directed approach to help-
ing the entire Puget Sound recover. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 2247, and I include in the 
RECORD letters of support from North-
west 
Indian 
Fisheries 
Commission, 
Puget Sound Partnership, and the Na-
tional Audubon Society. 
NORTHWEST INDIAN 
FISHERIES COMMISSION, 
Olympia, Washington, August 22, 2019. 
Re NWIFC Support for H.R. 2247—Promoting 
United Government Efforts to Save Our 
Sound Act. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SAM GRAVES, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO, RANKING MEM-
BER GRAVES, AND HONORABLE MEMBERS
OF 
THE COMMITTEE: The Northwest Indian Fish-
eries Commission wishes to express our sup-
port for H.R. 2247 and respectfully requests 
passage of this important bill referred to 
your committee. The Northwest Indian Fish-
eries Commission is comprised of the 20 trea-
ty Indian tribes in western Washington, who 
have constitutionally protected, federally 
adjudicated, treaty-reserved rights to har-
vest, manage, and consume salmon and shell-
fish in their usual and accustomed areas. 
These treaty-reserved resources are inex-
tricably linked to the health of Puget Sound. 
If we cannot recover Puget Sound, we will 
not recover salmon, we will not maintain our 
culturally 
and 
economically 
significant 
shellfish fishery, and we will not protect our 
treaty-reserved rights. 
We support H.R. 2247 because it recognizes 
the role of tribes as sovereign governments 
working 
collaboratively 
to 
restore 
our 
shared waters. The bill also provides a log-
ical approach to Puget Sound recovery, by 
encouraging a more efficient use of govern-
ment through improved federal agency co-
ordination on Puget Sound actions. It is only 
logical that government agencies would 
align their related activities to compliment 
the significant contribution of federal fund-
ing directed toward restoration and not un-
dermine those investments or our treaty-re-
served rights. 
We also support H.R. 2247 because it au-
thorizes much needed increases to Puget 
Sound funding. We greatly appreciate the 
Geographic Program-Puget Sound appropria-
tions Congress continues to provide. How-
ever, funding for Puget Sound recovery needs 
to be significantly increased to address the 
numerous threats that the Sound and our re-
served-rights face. 
For these reasons, we respectfully request 
you support passage of H.R. 2247 and thank 
you for taking the time to consider the bill 
and the important issues it addresses. We 
also extend our gratitude to Representative 
Heck for his leadership in introducing H.R. 
2247, recognizing the important role of tribes 
and treaty rights in Puget Sound recovery, 
and taking the initiative to advance Puget 
Sound recovery as a national priority. 
Sincerely, 
LORRAINE LOOMIS, 
Chairperson.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H792 
February 5, 2020 
AUGUST 13, 2019. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SAM GRAVES, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: We, the undersigned, are 
writing to urge your support to pass H.R. 
2247, the ‘‘Promoting United Government Ef-
forts To Save Our Sound’’ (PUGET SOS) Act, 
introduced earlier this year by Congressman 
Denny Heck and Congressman Derek Kilmer 
to strengthen federal support for actions 
that are essential to Puget Sound recovery. 
Puget Sound is a complex ecosystem en-
compassing mountains, farmlands, cities, 
rivers, forests, and wetlands. Sixteen major 
rivers flow to Puget Sound and 20 treaty 
tribes call the region home. 
Currently, 4.5 million people live in the 
Puget Sound area, with another 1.3 million 
expected to live here by 2040. In May, the Se-
attle Times reported that Seattle was the 
second fastest growing city in the nation in 
2018, and the fastest in 2017. We are a region 
of innovators and entrepreneurs: 11 Fortune 
500 companies are headquartered in the 
Puget Sound area, many of which have 
shaped 21st century life. Our economy is 
roaring, and the region’s natural beauty and 
recreational opportunities help businesses 
and companies attract top talent. 
On the surface, Puget Sound looks healthy 
and inviting, but, in fact, Puget Sound is in 
grave trouble. Southern Resident orcas, Chi-
nook salmon, and steelhead are all listed 
under the Endangered Species Act. Toxic 
chemicals and pharmaceuticals continue to 
pollute our waterways, and shellfish beds are 
routinely closed to commercial and rec-
reational harvest due to fecal contamina-
tion. Despite a significant investment of en-
ergy and resources from federal, tribal, 
state, and local governments, habitat deg-
radation continues to outpace restoration. 
While this situation at times seems impos-
sibly gloomy, the hundreds of passionate 
people who are devoted to seeing the return 
of a healthy and resilient Puget Sound give 
us hope. 
Scientists say that we can still recover 
Puget Sound, but only if we act boldly now. 
We know what we need to do. The primary 
barriers between us and more food for orcas, 
clean and sufficient water for people and 
fish, sustainable working lands, and harvest-
able shellfish are funding and political for-
titude. 
The single greatest step we could take to 
ensure a durable, systematic, and science- 
based effort for Puget Sound recovery is to 
fully fund the implementation of habitat 
protection and restoration, water quality 
protection, and salmon recovery programs. 
The PUGET SOS Act (H.R. 2247) would au-
thorize up to $50 million in funding for Puget 
Sound recovery, a significant and very wel-
come jump from the $28 million per year that 
Congress has appropriated for the last sev-
eral fiscal years. 
The PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal 
agency expertise and resources. These are 
tremendous assets. Ensuring that federal 
agencies are coordinated, setting goals, and 
holding each other accountable will help in-
crease their effectiveness and provide yet an-
other boost to Puget Sound recovery. Estab-
lishing the Puget Sound Program Office at 
the EPA and codifying a Federal Task Force 
promises that these goals will be met. 
Passage of the PUGET SOS Act would 
demonstrate to the nation that Puget Sound 
is vital to the economic, cultural, and envi-
ronmental security of the United States. By 
investing significantly in the health and 
wellbeing of Puget Sound, federal decision- 
makers demonstrate to the nation that 
Puget Sound is worth saving. 
Thank you for your past support of Puget 
Sound recovery. We urge you to support H.R. 
2247, the PUGET SOS Act, to ensure that the 
federal government is a viable, willing part-
ner in this race against time.

offer our support for the following bills re-

the September 19, 2019 Markup before the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-

HR 4031—GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE 
ACT OF 2019 
The Great Lakes are home to 30 million 
people and 350 species of birds, but increasing 
challenges are on the horizon for the world’s 
largest body of freshwater. Fluctuating 
water levels exacerbated by climate change, 
invasive exotic species and excess nutrients 
are putting even more stress on this eco-
system that is so important for birds and 
people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive has helped clean up toxic pollutants, 
protect wildlife by restoring critical habitat, 
and help combat devastating invasive spe-
cies. 
HR 4031 would increase funding for con-
servation projects to $475 million over five 
years, by increasing the Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative’s authorization incremen-
tally from $300 million per year to $475 mil-
lion per year. 
HR 1132—SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION ACT 
The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the 
Pacific Coast’s largest estuary, is also home 
to a rapidly growing population of 8 million 
people, and provides for a host of social and 
economic values through ports and industry, 
agriculture, fisheries, archaeological and 
cultural sites, recreation, and research. How-
ever, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its 
tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its 
eelgrass 
and 
mudflat 
habitat. 
Climate 
change exacerbates these conditions through 
drought that alters the salinity balance, 
ocean acidification that reduces species 
abundance and diversity, increasing water 
temperatures, and rising seas causing flood-
ing that eliminates living shorelines and 
puts communities at risk. Many species of 
waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay, 
including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, un-
derscoring the value of this ecosystem. 
HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco 
Bay Restoration Grant Program in EPA and 
funding of up to $25m per year to support the 
restoration of this estuary. 
HR 1620—CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Salt marshes are special places to birds 
and other wildlife, but sea level rise has ele-
vated the waters in the Chesapeake Bay by 
one foot during the 20th century and is accel-
erating due to climate change. Salt marshes 
provide valuable ‘‘ecosystem services’’, in-
cluding nurseries for the Chesapeake Bay’s 
commercially important fish, a buffer pro-
tecting coastal communities against storm 
surge, a filter that stops nutrient and sedi-
ment pollution from entering the Bay, and a 
recreational resource attracting visitors who 
contribute millions of dollars to local econo-
mies. Chesapeake Bay’s salt marshes host 
globally significant populations of both 
Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail. 
HR 1620 would increase the authorization 
of appropriations for the Chesapeake Bay 
Program to more than $90m per year. 
HR 2247—PROMOTING UNITED GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO SAVE OUR SOUND ACT 
Despite significant investments in Puget 
Sound ecosystem health by state, federal, 
tribal and local governments, concerned 
members of the public, and conservation or-
ganizations, progress towards ecosystem re-
covery targets remains slow. The number of 
marine birds wintering in Puget Sound has 
declined significantly in the last 30 years and 
migratory, fish-eating birds appear to be at 
the greatest risk. 
HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million 
in funding for Puget Sound recovery. The 
PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal agency 
expertise and resources, ensuring that fed-
eral agencies are coordinated, setting goals, 
and holding each other accountable will help 
increase their effectiveness and provide a 
boost to Puget Sound recovery. 
HR 3779—RESILIENCE REVOLVING LOAN FUND ACT 
OF 2019 
Pre-disaster planning can help commu-
nities adapt to the changing flood patterns 
that threaten people and birds species de-
pendent on shoreline and riverine areas. 
These changes have led to more frequent in-
stances of ‘‘nuisance flooding,’’ as well as 
catastrophic events. NOAA has found that 
‘‘nuisance’’ or ‘‘sunny day’’ flooding is up 
300% to 900% than it was 50 years ago. In ad-
dition, catastrophic flooding events have in-
creased in both frequency and intensity. 
These trends have been particularly pro-
nounced in the Northeast, Midwest and 
upper Great Plains, where the amount of pre-
cipitation in large rainfall events has in-
creased more than 30 percent above the aver-
age observed from 1901–1960. As sea level rise 
accelerates, it only exacerbates these im-
pacts, which further compounds vulner-
ability in flood-prone communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H794 
February 5, 2020 
HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act 
to offer low-interest loans to states for ‘‘dis-
aster mitigation projects’’, including invest-
ments in natural infrastructure projects, 
which would help communities prepare and 
recover from natural disasters. 
We urge you to support and advance the 
bills listed above. Please feel free to contact 
us with any questions. 
Sincerely, 
JULIE HILL-GABRIEL, 
Vice President, Water Conservation, 
National Audubon Society. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2247. 
H.R. 2247 represents good governance 
by codifying the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency’s restoration activities 
in the Puget Sound. The Puget Sound 
is the Nation’s second largest estuary, 
supporting more than 4.5 million peo-
ple, more than $365 million in gross do-
mestic product, and a wide variety of 
species. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. HECK). 
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Mr. Speaker, I do indeed rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2247, the Pro-
moting United Government Efforts to 
Save Our Sound, or the PUGET SOS 
Act. 
As indicated, Puget Sound is, in fact, 
located in western Washington, but it 
is a national treasure. Indeed, to mod-
ify just slightly what my friend from 
Florida suggested, by water volume it 
is actually the largest estuary in the 
United States of America. 
Puget Sound and its tributaries are 
one of the most ecologically diverse in 
all of North America, and it is, as has 
been indicated, the economic engine 
for the western part of our State, sup-
porting maritime industry, commercial 
and 
recreational 
fishing, 
shellfish 
growers, tourism, and recreation. 
But it is more than that. It is also 
absolutely critical to the Tribes that 
reside in Washington State who have 
stewarded it for literally millennia. 
And need I remind you; they have trea-
ty-reserved rights to its natural re-
sources. 
Above and beyond that, it is central 
to the identity of anyone from western 
Washington. I ask you this: For those 
of you who have been to Seattle and 
have made the comment or a post from 
an August visit, it is beautiful. What is 
the image that comes to your mind? It 
is of Mount Rainier, above the shim-
mering waters of the Puget Sound. 
Or—and more about this later—it is of 
that magnificent black and white fish, 
the orca, breaching the surface of the 
water. 
But here is the deal, Puget Sound is 
dying. Slowly but surely, it is under se-
rious threat. Water and air pollution, 
sediment contamination, and water 
flow disruption continue to devastate 
the fish, marine, mammal, bird, and 
shellfish populations of Puget Sound. 
Indeed, that orca, the Southern Resi-
dent orca, population is down to 72, ar-
guably not sustainable because we need 
to save the Sound. And if these trends 
continue, we will lose much of what 
makes Puget Sound a national treasure 
so special. And that should concern us 
all. 
Fortunately, there have been many 
people across the Puget Sound region 
that have been treating these deterio-
rating conditions as a call to action. 
Tribes, 
State 
governments, 
local 
groups and private sector people are in-
vesting in recovery efforts. 
Back in 2013, I teamed up with my 
good friend, roommate and colleague, 
Congressman KILMER, to establish the 
Puget Sound Recovery Caucus to pro-
mote Puget Sound preservation at the 
Federal level. 
And in 2016, the Obama administra-
tion created the Puget Sound Federal 
Task Force, by executive action, to co-
ordinate recovery efforts more effi-
ciently among the Federal agencies. 
Still, we must bring more attention to 
bear on Puget Sound recovery, and 
that is why we introduced the PUGET 
SOS Act. 
The bill will simply codify the Fed-
eral task force to ensure that coordina-
tion 
among 
Federal 
agencies 
con-
tinue—and we all want that—into the 
future and it also creates the Puget 
Sound Recovery National Program of-
fice at the EPA, elevating Puget Sound 
recovery efforts and putting them on a 
par with those deservedly of the Great 
Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. 
And for the first time, the bill au-
thorizes funding for Federal Puget 
Sound recovery actions. This is a prod-
uct of years of collaboration between 
Tribal, State, and local stakeholders, 
including private sector investors. 
Specifically, I thank the members of 
the committee. I especially thank my 
friend, Congressman KILMER. And I 
most 
especially 
thank 
my 
friends 
across the aisle, who joined in cospon-
sorship in support of this. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Northwest 
Indian Fisheries Commission and the 
Puget Sound Partnership for their ef-
fort. The threats facing the Puget 
Sound are numerous and they are exis-
tential, but I believe that with a strong 
Federal partnership role and smart in-
vestments, we can act before it is too 
late. We can help recover the Puget 
Sound and preserve its ecological, eco-
nomic, and cultural significance for 
generations to come. 
The PUGET SOS Act is a strong first 
step towards recovery, and I encourage 
my colleagues to support the bill. 
And again, I extend my gratitude to 
all of those who have put your shoul-
ders to the wheel and gotten it this far 
in the process. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman. 
We are all saddened, and deeply frus-
trated, to see the iconic Puget Sound 
continue to devolve into a dumping 
ground of human waste and sewage. It 
is no wonder, the species in our Na-
tion’s largest estuary are facing in-
creasing odds of extinction. We must 
do more to address this environmental 
crisis. 
An aquatic toxicologist working with 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration has found that growth 
rates for salmon species in Puget 
Sound are stunned, metabolisms are 
distorted to the point of starvation, 
and physiological functions are dis-
rupted when exposed to high levels of 
Prozac, caffeine, cholesterol medica-
tion, ibuprofen, bug spray, cocaine, 
birth control pills, and dozens of other 
drugs 
and 
personal 
care 
products 
present in Puget Sound. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to see 
my friends from the west side of the 
State, Mr. HECK, who has spent a great 
deal of his illustrious career working 
on this issue, as well as Mr. KILMER, 
who has also spent an inordinate 
amount of time working on this very, 
very important issue, working to ad-
dress the debilitating impact the envi-
ronmental degradation in Puget Sound 
is having on shellfish, on the endan-
gered salmon, and on steelhead. And, 
as was mentioned, on our iconic South-
ern Resident killer whales, which are 
truly on the verge of extinction. 
b 1330 
As my colleague CATHY MCMORRIS 
RODGERS and I have been saying for 
years, we must focus on solutions that 
the science tells us will directly aid 
fish species now and not waste our pre-
cious resources and time on political 
motivations like the efforts to tear 
down our dams. This is a deadly dis-
traction from the actual science-based 
solutions to support salmon recovery. 
I want to continue to work with my 
colleagues to address problems facing 
endangered fish species throughout our 
region in a comprehensive manner. The 
challenges are many: 
We must continue to tackle the 
pinniped issue, the avian predation 
issue, but we also must ensure that a 
robust hatchery program is in place; 
We must continue to prioritize the 
world-class fish passage in our hydro-
electric infrastructure; 
We must continue to take a serious 
and thoughtful look at fishing and 
other human-caused impacts; and 
We must build upon the habitat im-
provements and greater ecological con-
servation measures. 
Mr. Speaker, we must focus on the 
science, not the politics. We must focus 
on the facts, not ideology or emotions. 
While I support the passage of this leg-
islation—and I do—that we are voting 
on today, I believe it can and should 
only move forward as part of a much 
more comprehensive discussion and ef-
fort in the Pacific Northwest to ad-
dress the needs of our iconic species;

the protection of our environment; the 
reliability of our clean, renewable en-
ergy infrastructure; and, certainly, the 
future of our region’s economy and 
livelihood. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. KILMER). 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of the PUGET 
SOS Act, and I want to thank my good 
friend and colleague from the State of 
Washington, Representative HECK, for 
his tireless leadership on this impor-
tant legislation, and his partnership in 
working to recover this iconic body of 
water. 
Those of us who are lucky enough to 
call Washington State home know that 
the Puget Sound is a truly special body 
of water. Generations of our friends 
and neighbors have built their lives 
and made livelihoods on Puget Sound. 
Tribes, since time immemorial, have 
called the Sound their home. 
We know that Puget Sound is critical 
to the environment and to our eco-
nomic future in our region as well. Our 
economy is stronger because of the 
Sound. 
Our 
maritime 
industry 
is 
stronger, our fisheries, tourism be-
cause—listen—people want to come 
there. They want to boat or kayak on 
it. They want to go fishing or crabbing 
on it. They want to dig for clams and 
hike along the Sound’s beaches. In 
fact, those experiences are vital to peo-
ple from near and far, including my 
own family. It is one of our natural 
treasures. 
Some of our region’s most culturally 
important species, including salmon 
and orca and Dungeness crab, rely on a 
healthy Sound. And despite years and 
years of effort to protect and restore 
Puget Sound, we still have a lot of 
work to do to address the significant 
challenges, including stormwater run-
off and habitat loss and harmful algal 
blooms that continue to threaten the 
crown jewel of our region’s identity 
and economy. That is why I am proud 
to see the House advance this critical 
bill, which will bring to bear the co-
ordinated Federal resources necessary 
to save Puget Sound. 
If we are going to recover our salmon 
and orca populations, if we are going to 
ensure future generations can dig for 
clams, if we are going to respect and 
uphold Tribal treaty rights, we need 
the Federal Government to step up and 
support the work already being done by 
the State and Tribes and local commu-
nities and businesses that all depend on 
a healthy Sound. We need all oars in 
the water rowing in the same direction. 
I am proud that, by passing this bill, 
we will make meaningful progress to-
ward those goals. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not just here 
speaking on this bill as a Representa-
tive, I am here today as a dad. If future 
generations, including my two little 
girls, are going to have the opportuni-
ties to enjoy these treasures and to 
build their livelihoods in our region, we 
have got to act now and protect and re-
store the Sound. 
So, again, I thank my colleague and 
friend, DENNY HECK, for his leadership 
on this issue. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I yield as 
much time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS). 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this legis-
lation. I rise in support of the PUGET 
SOS Act, Save Our Sound Act, impor-
tant legislation to clean up the Puget 
Sound. 
I join as someone who represents a 
district in eastern Washington. My dis-
trict actually borders Idaho, but I be-
lieve that we need to be locking arms. 
We need to be working together to 
clean up Puget Sound. 
For decades, we have invested bil-
lions of dollars, billions of dollars in 
research and technology, to recover 
salmon in the Pacific Northwest and 
save our orcas, and we need to continue 
that work to look for the best science 
to recover salmon and to save our 
orcas. 
I am proud of the work that we have 
done. We see salmon returns improv-
ing. When you look at where we started 
to where we are today, we are at record 
levels. 
Now, in Washington State, some are 
suggesting that we need to tear out our 
dams in order to save salmon and to 
save our orcas. It is a solution that is 
not backed by science. 
The reason that I am in such support 
of helping save the Sound and cleaning 
up Puget Sound is because it is the 
number one watershed, right now, for 
salmon and for saving our orcas. 
And if we really want to focus on get-
ting results, we need to come together 
and figure out how we clean up Puget 
Sound, how we get the salmon returns 
improved, and, ultimately, how we all 
save the salmon. 
So, for those of us in eastern Wash-
ington, we often feel like some in the 
State are looking to us. We want to 
lock arms and figure out how we actu-
ally make a difference, and one of 
those is going to be cleaning up the 
Puget Sound. 
So, in eastern Washington, we have 
been on the forefront of policy to en-
sure strong salmon runs and clean up 
our rivers and lakes. I represent the 
city of Spokane, the second largest 
city in Washington State. 
The people of the city of Spokane 
have committed to over $300 million to 
clean up Spokane River so that we will 
no longer be dumping raw sewage. The 
mayor, David Condon, brought people 
together for an innovative water stor-
age system, and President Barack 
Obama brought him to the White 
House to celebrate and honor this inno-
vative approach. 
Inland Empire Paper Company has 
spent nearly a billion dollars on tech-
nology to clean up and ensure that the 
water that goes into the Spokane River 
is clean. 
We are spending millions and mil-
lions of dollars to clean up Lake Roo-
sevelt behind Grand Coulee Dam. We 
are on track to have Lake Roosevelt 
meet clean drinking water standards so 
that we can enjoy Lake Roosevelt, we 
can fish, and we can enjoy the beaches. 
It breaks my heart, though, when I 
hear what is going on in Puget Sound 
and the impact that Puget Sound is 
having on recovering salmon and orcas: 
In 2009, 10 million gallons of raw sew-
age spilled into Puget Sound; in 2017, 
250 million gallons of raw sewage 
spilled into Puget Sound; in 2019, 4.5 
million gallons. We have been warned 
that stormwater is killing coho salmon 
before they even spawn. 
As the Seattle Times said during the 
2017 failure that spilled 250 million gal-
lons of sewage into the Sound: ‘‘Not a 
single person from an environmental 
group or the public turned out to tes-
tify or demand action on the crippled 
West Point Treatment Plant, or even 
take notice of one of the largest local 
public infrastructure failures in dec-
ades.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we are failing. We are 
failing to meet our obligation and the 
high standards that we expect for every 
body of water; yet, nearly every week, 
we have to defend our dams from the 
same environmental groups that have 
refused to look at the facts. 
So I am stepping forward today, as a 
Representative from eastern Wash-
ington, with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, to say let’s focus on 
what is actually going to get the re-
sults, what is going to recover salmon, 
and what is going to save our orcas. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
proud to be standing on the floor today 
speaking in support of the PUGET SOS 
Act. The passage of the bill in this 
House is something that our State has 
been collectively working toward for 
years. 
I thank Representative HECK
and 
Representative KILMER and the other 
Members of the Puget Sound Recovery 
Caucus for their leadership. 
The challenges facing our Sound are 
great and are compounded by our 
State’s growth and climate change. 
Chinook populations remain far below 
recovery goals, despite having been 
listed as threatened since 1999 under 
the Endangered Species Act. 
As the only member from Wash-
ington State on the House Agricultural 
Committee, I plan to use my position 
to highlight the importance of respon-
sible farming practices, ecosystem re-
covery, and riparian habitats. 
Mr. Speaker, the narrative that we 
can have farms or fish is false—we can 
have both. State- and county-level 
agencies are also doing their part to 
help both fish and farmers. 
The Washington State conservation 
Commission is doing some amazing

work in the agricultural world. Our 
conservation districts work statewide 
to implement natural resource im-
provement projects and build land-
owner engagement and commitment. 
Just one example is the work that 
the Pierce County conservation Dis-
trict did when they partnered with 
local farmers to address management 
practices and were able to have a sub-
stantial impact on the health of 278 
acres for shellfish harvesting. 
The Puget Sound needs protecting. 
Other bodies of water like the Chesa-
peake Bay and the Great Lakes have 
formal program status under the Clean 
Water Act, which helps ensure their 
consistent Federal funding. The Puget 
Sound and all of the wildlife in it de-
serve the same status under the Clean 
Water Act. 
It is shortsighted and irresponsible to 
not fight for the Sound and its future. 
We owe it to the species whose futures 
are imperiled because of human activ-
ity. We owe it to our children and gen-
erations we will never know. We abso-
lutely must protect Puget Sound. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. I urge support of this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, 
with all of the support from the Wash-
ington delegation, I urge my colleagues 
to support the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, several important 
considerations underlie the purpose and intent 
of the Puget SOS Act. Puget Sound and its 
tributary waters are one of the most eco-
logically diverse ecosystems in North America 
with natural resources that have ecological, 
economic, and cultural importance to the 
United States and the many Tribal nations that 
have stewarded it for millennia. The health 
and productivity of Puget Sound is not only 
the cornerstone of the region’s quality of life 
and vibrant economy, but its worldclass salm-
on fishery, commercial aquaculture, agri-
culture, and port activities ripple throughout 
the Nation. 
Threats to Puget Sound, such as water pol-
lution, sediment contamination, environmental 
degradation, and habitat loss, jeopardize the 
economic productivity and natural resources 
that support the increasing population of the 
region. For nearly a decade, State, local, and 
Tribal governments, cooperative partnerships, 
and concerned citizens have worked together 
in a deliberate and coordinated way to direct 
and manage public resource allocation toward 
habitat restoration, improving water quality and 
shellfish farms, and developing a body of sci-
entific knowledge, all of which have advanced 
the Puget Sound recovery efforts. 
Tribal governments with treaty-reserved 
rights in the natural resources of Puget Sound 
have long served as co-managers of fishery 
resources, have engaged in Puget Sound 
Partnership processes and public forums to 
encourage a holistic and scientific approach to 
recovery efforts, and have continued in their 
role as stewards of Puget Sound, including by 
engaging with multi-faceted restoration and 
protection actions, and are thus an indispen-
sable, equal partner in all Puget Sound recov-
ery actions. 
Despite significant and nationally recognized 
accomplishments, the rate of damage to Puget 
Sound still exceeds the rate of recovery. To 
outpace mounting pollutants and other cas-
cading negative impacts, the next step in for-
tifying the recovery system is to align Federal 
recovery and protection efforts seamlessly 
with State, local, and Tribal investments, as 
the Puget SOS Act would do. 
Water and air pollution, sediment contami-
nation, habitat loss and decline, and water 
flow disruption continue to devastate the fish, 
marine mammal, bird, and shellfish popu-
lations of Puget Sound, threatening local 
economies, and Tribal treaty rights, and con-
tributing to: 
Significant declines in the populations of 
wild Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Summer 
Chum Salmon, Steelhead, and Pacific Herring, 
which are essential food sources for humans, 
fish, seabirds, mammals, and other wildlife; 
Risks to the sustainability of fish arid- shell-
fish populations, and their food chains, repro-
ductive cycles, and habitats, which also threat-
en Federal obligations to protect Tribal re-
sources, culture, traditions, and economies; 
Marine species being listed as at-risk or vul-
nerable to extinction, according to State, Fed-
eral, and provincial lists that identify the spe-
cies of Puget Sound and surrounding areas, 
including the iconic population of southern 
resident Orca whales; 
Sediment contaminated with toxic sub-
stances—such as polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), heavy metals (mercury), and oil 
(grease)—polluting Puget Sound, threatening 
public health, and posing; significant dangers 
to humans, fish, and wildlife; 
Rivers and beaches failing to meet water 
quality standards and becoming unsafe for 
salmon, as well as business and recreational 
activities, such as fishing and swimming; 
The closing of shellfish beds from contami-
nated pollution caused by sources such as 
stormwater and agricultural runoff; and 
Mortalities and morbidity in shellfish due to 
the acidification of Puget Sound. 
Puget Sound is a national treasure and its 
recovery and protection will significantly con-
tribute to the environmental, cultural, and eco-
nomic well-being of the United States and the 
many Tribal nations that have stewarded it for 
millennia. 
The PUGET SOS Act underscores the rec-
ognition that Federal Government should align 
its efforts and resources to fully implement 
and enforce the goals of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act, including State imple-
mentation of non-point source water quality 
standards for salmon, the Endangered Spe-
cies Act of 1973, and all other Federal laws 
that contribute to the recovery and protection 
of Puget Sound. The Act also recognizes that 
the Federal Government should uphold Fed-
eral trust responsibilities to restore and protect 
resources crucial to Tribal treaty rights—in-
cluding by carrying out government-to-govern-
ment consultation—as well as support re-
gional, local, and Tribal efforts to address en-
vironmental challenges. 
The PUGET SOS Act is intended, among 
other things, to ensure that the recovery and 
protection programs, projects, and initiatives 
that the Federal Government undertakes in, or 
that otherwise impact, Puget Sound shall be 
actively coordinated and aligned with the pro-
tection of Tribal treaty rights and resources, 
the Treaty Rights at Risk Initiative, Salmon 
Recovery Plans, the Coastal Nonpoint Pollu-
tion Control Program, and the Puget Sound 
Action Agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to all stake-
holders who have come together to advocate 
for the recovery and protection of Puget 
Sound. The PUGET SOS Act is an important 
step towards those goals, and I urge my col-
leagues to support its passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KEATING). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 2247, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1620) to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to reau-
thorize the Chesapeake Bay Program, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1620 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chesapeake

upcoming fiscal year, incrementally 
rising to $92 million for fiscal year 2025. 
Since its funding in 1983, EPA’s 
Chesapeake Bay Program has been 
working toward improving the water 
quality and ecosystem health of the 
single largest estuary in the U.S. 
Reaching to six States, and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, I might add, the Bay 
is a cherished water and the number of 
people and local economies impacted 
by its health make a program like this 
very essential. 
However, as stakeholders noted in 
our June 2019 hearing, the ecosystem 
remains under major stress. The Bay is 
threatened by nutrient and sediment 
loads from sources like agricultural 
runoff, wastewater treatment facili-
ties, 
land-use 
changes, 
urban 
stormwater runoff and atmospheric 
deposition. 
We 
must 
continue 
to 
prioritize programs like the Chesa-
peake Bay Program and the protection 
of our Nation’s water. This bill will 
support the continued cooperative ef-
forts of all involved to achieve the pro-
tection of the Chesapeake Bay. 
I would like to recognize several of 
the bipartisan committee members co-
sponsoring the bill, including the gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia (Ms. NORTON), the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. BROWN), and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK), and also a former Mem-
ber of Congress, God rest his soul, Mr. 
Cummings. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters of support of H.R. 1620 from: 
Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Part-
nership, the National Audubon Society, 
Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, and 
the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. 
SEPTEMBER 17, 2019. 
Hon. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO, 
Chairman, House Transportation and Infra-
structure Subcommittee on Water Resources 
and Environment, Washington, DC. 
Hon. BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, House Transportation and In-
frastructure Subcommittee on Water Re-
sources and Environment, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NAPOLITANO AND RANKING 
MEMBER
WESTERMAN: The Theodore Roo-
sevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP) is a 
national coalition of sportsmen, conserva-
tion, and outdoor industry organizations 
that seeks to ensure all Americans have ac-
cess to quality places to hunt and fish. We 
partner with 60 hunting, fishing, and con-
servation organizations to unite and amplify 
the voices of America’s more-than 40 million 
sportsmen and women whose activities help 
sustain the $887-billion outdoor recreation 
economy. 
Today, we write in support of the Chesa-
peake Bay Program Reauthorization Act 
(H.R. 1620). The legislation would reauthorize 
the Chesapeake Bay Program and increase 
its authorized funding level to $90,000,000 for 
fiscal year 2020 and then increase its author-
ized funding level by half a million dollars 
each year through fiscal year 2024. The 
Chesapeake Bay Program provides critical 
federal investment, which is then leveraged 
several-fold by state and local dollars, to im-
prove the quality of water and wetlands 
habitat in the Bay watershed. 
The Chesapeake Bay Program is important 
to the continued conservation and restora-
tion of the Chesapeake Bay. While the health 
of the Bay had been consistently improved 
over the last decade, the 2018 State of the 
Bay Report showed that the health of the 
Bay declined over the past year due to an in-
credible amount of rainfall that greatly in-
creased the amount of nitrogen, phos-
phorous, sediment, and debris that flowed 
into the Bay. Without a significant increase 
in funding for federal programs that help to 
restore the Bay, such as the EPA’s Chesa-
peake Bay Program, this iconic waterbody 
will not be able to recover. 
Thank you for your consideration and we 
look forward to working with your sub-
committee to help increase funding in order 
to 
conserve 
and 
restore 
our 
iconic 
waterbodies. 
Respectfully,

On behalf of the National Audubon Soci-
ety’s more than 1 million members, our mis-
sion is to protect birds and the places they 
need for today and tomorrow. We write to 
offer our support for the following bills re-
lated to important coastal and water con-
servation issues that will be the subject of 
the September 19, 2019 Markup before the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee. 
HR 4031—GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE 
ACT OF 2019 
The Great Lakes are home to 30 million 
people and 350 species of birds, but increasing 
challenges are on the horizon for the world’s 
largest body of freshwater. Fluctuating 
water levels exacerbated by climate change, 
invasive exotic species and excess nutrients 
are putting even more stress on this eco-
system that is so important for birds and 
people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive has helped clean up toxic pollutants, 
protect wildlife by restoring critical habitat, 
and help combat devastating invasive spe-
cies. 
HR 4031 would increase funding for con-
servation projects to $475 million over five 
years, by increasing the Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative’s authorization incremen-
tally from $300 million per year to $475 mil-
lion per year. 
HR 1132—SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION ACT 
The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the 
Pacific Coast’s largest estuary, is also home 
to a rapidly growing population of 8 million 
people, and provides for a host of social and 
economic values through ports and industry, 
agriculture, fisheries, archaeological and 
cultural sites, recreation, and research. How-
ever, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its 
tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its 
eelgrass 
and 
mudflat 
habitat. 
Climate 
change exacerbates these conditions through 
drought that alters the salinity balance, 
ocean acidification that reduces species 
abundance and diversity, increasing water 
temperatures, and rising seas causing flood-
ing that eliminates living shorelines and 
puts communities at risk. Many species of 
waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay, 
including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, un-
derscoring the value of this ecosystem. 
HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco 
Bay Restoration Grant Program in EPA and 
funding of up to $25m per year to support the 
restoration of this estuary. 
HR 1620—CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Salt marshes are special places to birds 
and other wildlife, but sea level rise has ele-
vated the waters in the Chesapeake Bay by 
one foot during the 20th century and is accel-
erating due to climate change. Salt marshes 
provide valuable ‘‘ecosystem services’’, in-
cluding nurseries for the Chesapeake Bay’s 
commercially important fish, a buffer pro-
tecting coastal communities against storm 
surge, a filter that stops nutrient and sedi-
ment pollution from entering the Bay, and a 
recreational resource attracting visitors who 
contribute millions of dollars to local econo-
mies. Chesapeake Bay’s salt marshes host 
globally significant populations of both 
Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail. 
HR 1620 would increase the authorization 
of appropriations for the Chesapeake Bay 
Program to more than $90m per year. 
HR 2247—PROMOTING UNITED GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO SAVE OUR SOUND ACT 
Despite significant investments in Puget 
Sound ecosystem health by state, federal, 
tribal and local governments, concerned 
members of the public, and conservation or-
ganizations, progress towards ecosystem re-
covery targets remains slow. The number of 
marine birds wintering in Puget Sound has 
declined significantly in the last 30 years and 
migratory, fisheating birds appear to be at 
the greatest risk. 
HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million 
in funding for Puget Sound recovery. The 
PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal agency 
expertise and resources, ensuring that fed-
eral agencies are coordinated, setting goals, 
and holding each other accountable will help 
increase their effectiveness and provide a 
boost to Puget Sound recovery. 
HR 3779—RESILIENCE REVOLVING LOAN FUND ACT 
OF 2019 
Pre-disaster planning can help commu-
nities adapt to the changing flood patterns 
that threaten people and birds species de-
pendent on shoreline and riverine areas. 
These changes have led to more frequent in-
stances of ‘‘nuisance flooding,’’ as well as 
catastrophic events. NOAA has found that 
‘‘nuisance’’ or ‘‘sunny day’’ flooding is up 
300% to 900% than it was 50 years ago. In ad-
dition, catastrophic flooding events have in-
creased in both frequency and intensity. 
These trends have been particularly pro-
nounced in the Northeast, Midwest and 
upper Great Plains, where the amount of pre-
cipitation in large rainfall events has in-
creased more than 30 percent above the aver-
age observed from 1901–1960. As sea level rise 
accelerates, it only exacerbates these im-
pacts, which further compounds vulner-
ability in flood-prone communities. 
HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act 
to offer low-interest loans to states for ‘‘dis-
aster mitigation projects’’, including invest-
ments in natural infrastructure projects, 
which would help communities prepare and 
recover from natural disasters. 
We urge you to support and advance the 
bills listed above. Please feel free to contact 
us with any questions. 
Sincerely, 
JULIE HILL-GABRIEL, 
Vice President, Water Conservation, 
National Audubon Society.

BACKCOUNTRY HUNTERS & ANGLERS, 
Missoula, MT, September 18, 2019. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, House Transportation & Infrastruc-
ture Committee, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SAM GRAVES, 
Ranking Member, House Transportation & In-
frastructure Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: On behalf of Backcountry 
Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the fastest grow-
ing organization that represents sportsmen 
and women in North America, I encourage 
you to support House Transportation & In-
frastructure Committee and floor passage of 
Rep. Elaine Luria’s (D–VA) Chesapeake Bay 
Program Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1620) and 
Rep. David Joyce’s (R–OH) Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative Act (H.R. 4031). 
Over the last decade the health of the 
Bay’s ecosystem has improved. However, 
with increased rainfall in the region and the 
amount of sediment, phosphorous, debris and 
nitrogen eroding into the Chesapeake water-
shed, the water quality is on the decline. 
H.R. 1620 reauthorizes an important con-
servation and restoration program that safe-
guards the Chesapeake Bay watershed and 
increases the funding level to $90 million for 
fiscal year 2020 and grows by $500,000 each 
year until fiscal year 2024. Lawmakers fund-
ed the Chesapeake Bay Program at $73 mil-
lion annually for the past few years. The ad-
ditional funds will restore the health of the 
Bay and boost the regional economy that de-
pends on it for agricultural and outdoor 
recreation opportunities. 
The second bill, H.R. 4031 reauthorizes 
funding to conserve and restore the Great 
Lakes, the largest bodies of fresh water in 
the world by incremental increases of $25 
million annually until fiscal year 2026. The 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is a suc-
cessful program that strategically targets 
critical areas through multiple action plans 
and public input. Increasing funds will fur-
thermore expand fish and habitat rehabilita-
tion and implement collaborative projects 
between federal, state and local stake-
holders. 
The Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes pro-
grams provide necessary federal investments 
that leverage state and local dollars to im-
prove water quality and fish and wildlife 
habitat for Canada geese, speckled trout and 
other game species. BHA believes H.R. 1620 
and H.R. 4031 are essential to the health of 
fish and wildlife and the general public who 
depend on clean water for agriculture and 
municipal needs at home. 
Thank you for the opportunity to express 
our support for the Chesapeake Bay Program 
Reauthorization Act and the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative Act. We look forward 
to working with you to advance the legisla-
tion through the House. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN W. GALE, 
Conservation Director, 
Backcountry Hunters & Anglers. 
CHESAPEAKE BAY FOUNDATION, 
Annapolis, MD, November 5, 2019. 
Hon. ELAINE LURIA, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN LURIA: Thank you 
for sponsoring H.R. 1620, the Chesapeake Bay 
Program Reauthorization Act. As the pre-
eminent organization dedicated to Saving 
the Bay, we’re proud to support this legisla-
tion. As you know, the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram is the glue that holds the Chesapeake 
Bay Clean Water Blueprint together and pro-
vides essential oversight to ensure that all 
are doing their part. 
H.R. 1620 reauthorizes this program and 
provides a steady annual increase in funding 
over the next five years. This demonstrates 
Congress’s continued bipartisan commit-
ment to restoring the Bay and acknowledges 
the accelerated efforts that are needed to en-
sure that the requirements of the Blueprint 
are met by 2025. 
This is essential at this critical juncture. 
The partnership has proven to be effective: 
dead zones are getting smaller; bay grasses 
are rebounding; oyster restoration is under-
way; and local economies are improving. 
However, the Bay is facing new challenges 
due to threats from the impacts of climate 
change, increased loads from the Conowingo 
Dam, regulatory rollbacks, and shortfalls in 
funding (including the over $320 Million an-
nual shortfall identified by Pennsylvania in 
its latest Watershed Implementation Plan). 
Simply stated, there is still significant work 
to be done and the leadership role of the fed-
eral government and the Executive Council 
at this stage is paramount. Passing H.R. 
1620, and its companion bill, S. 701, will be an 
important piece to ensure that the Bay juris-
dictions fulfill their obligations under the 
Blueprint. 
We look forward to working with you and 
your fellow cosponsors to pass this vital bi-
partisan legislation. Again, thank you for 
your leadership on this issue. 
Sincerely, 
WILL BAKER, 
President & CEO. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1620, the Chesapeake Bay Program Re-
authorization Act. 
H.R. 1620 represents good governance 
to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay 
Program and passed out of the com-
mittee with strong bipartisan support. 
The Chesapeake Bay watershed is one 
of the largest estuaries in the United 
States, covering 64,000 square miles; is 
home to more than 18 million people; 
hosts two major ports as major inter-
national gateways for trade; and pro-
duces about 500 million pounds of sea-
food each year, some of which I enjoyed 
just the other day. 
I want to thank Members for their 
continued support for the restoration 
of the Chesapeake Bay, including Mr. 
WITTMAN of Virginia, Mr. RIGGLEMAN of 
Virginia, and Mr. FITZPATRICK of Penn-
sylvania. I know this issue is very im-
portant to their districts, their con-
stituencies, and to the entire region 
and, frankly, the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), the lead 
sponsor. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bill, the Chesa-
peake Bay Program Reauthorization 
Act. This bipartisan bill will reauthor-
ize $455 million for the Chesapeake Bay 
Program over the next 5 years. 
The Chesapeake Bay is one of our Na-
tion’s greatest national treasures. It 
helps generate $33 billion in economic 
value annually and is home to spectac-
ular natural beauty and ecological di-
versity. The EPA’s Chesapeake Bay 
Program 
coordinates 
regional 
con-
servation efforts, but Congress has not 
reauthorized 
this 
critical 
program 
since 2005. 
Thanks to innovative partnerships 
between local, State, and Federal agen-
cies and NGOs, the health of the Bay 
has improved in recent years. But this 
progress is fragile, and unless Congress 
acts, we risk losing these gains. 
In 2014, all States within the Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed and the District 
of Columbia signed the Chesapeake 
Bay Watershed Agreement. This part-
nership committed these States to 
work together and with the EPA to put 
in place all the necessary conservation 
practices by 2025. 
Part of this agreement includes set-
ting a limit, called the Total Maximum 
Daily Load, or TMDL, on pollution 
from chemicals like nitrogen and phos-
phorus. 
The EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program 
supports the work of States in meeting 
their commitments under this agree-
ment. Funding for the Bay program 
goes directly to localities to improve 
local conservation efforts. 
By passing the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram Reauthorization Act, Congress 
will reaffirm that all States in the wa-
tershed and the EPA must work to-
gether to achieve these restoration 
goals. This includes ensuring that all 
States have plans in place to comply 
with the TMDL and all other necessary 
conservation goals. 
I want to thank my friends and col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, Con-
gressman BOBBY SCOTT, Congressman 
ROB WITTMAN, and Congressman JOHN 
SARBANES
for working with me to 
achieve this bipartisan victory for the 
Bay. 
I also thank Chairwoman NAPOLI-
TANO and Ranking Member WESTERMAN 
for their support in bringing this bill to 
the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this critical bill. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITT-
MAN). 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support today of H.R. 1620, the Chesa-
peake Bay Program Reauthorization 
Act, that will extend and fund the En-
vironmental 
Protection 
Agency’s 
Chesapeake Bay Program until 2024. 
I am proud to have joined my col-
leagues from the Chesapeake Bay Wa-
tershed, Representatives ELAINE LURIA, 
BOBBY SCOTT, and JOHN SARBANES in 
introducing this important legislation. 
The Chesapeake Bay is, indeed, a na-
tional treasure and a centerpiece of the 
culture and economy of many commu-
nities in Virginia and neighboring 
States. 
A clean and healthy Bay is the right 
thing to do for future generations, but 
it will also support local economies and 
provide numerous other economic and 
quality-of-life benefits. 
The commercial seafood industry 
alone employs 34,000 in Virginia and

Maryland and generates $3.4 billion in 
sales. 
A clean and healthy Bay also sup-
ports a vibrant tourism and outdoor 
recreational industry. These industries 
in the watershed support over 820,000 
jobs and $13 billion in income. 
EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program does 
important work in partnership with 
Bay States to control pollution and 
manage nutrient runoff into the rivers 
feeding into the Bay. 
Through the Chesapeake Bay Pro-
gram, we see the overall health of the 
Bay has improved significantly over 
the last 30 years. We are seeing better 
water quality, more rockfish, more 
blue crabs, more oysters, and the list 
goes on and on. 
However, without continued collabo-
ration among stakeholders and Federal 
support, progress in the Bay is indeed 
threatened. With today’s actions, we 
are one step closer to ensuring that the 
Chesapeake Bay remains the economic 
foundation of our region that will be 
enjoyed for generations to come. 
We all enjoy the Bay, whether we are 
in the Bay watershed or outside the 
Bay watershed. It really is, indeed, a 
national treasure. 
If you look and think about the Bay, 
the workboats that you see there on a 
daily basis, the great way of life of 
folks in these waterside communities, 
it really is, I think, incumbent upon all 
of us to work hard and make sure we 
continue, not just to preserve the Bay, 
but make sure we see the Bay improve 
in water quality. 
It plays an important role in my fam-
ily. My son is a commercial fisherman, 
what we call in our area, a waterman, 
so he lets me know on a daily basis 
what is right and what is not right 
with the Chesapeake Bay, and encour-
ages me to make sure we are doing ev-
erything we can to continue as good 
stewards of that fantastic resource, to 
make sure it continues to provide for 
those people that make their living off 
of the water; but also provides for the 
quality of life of those folks that live 
in the watershed, and continues to be a 
national treasure. 
Even today under the stress, it is, in-
deed, one of the most productive water 
bodies in the entire world. If we con-
tinue on this path of improving the 
water quality there, I believe it can be 
even more productive and provide even 
more economic value, as well as just 
that intrinsic value that it provides to 
all of us; not just those in the water-
shed but to us as a Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting 
this 
measure 
and 
con-
tinuing the vital work of saving the 
Chesapeake Bay. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to inquire if my colleague is ready 
to close. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
ready to close. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to 
think of what Mr. WITTMAN and our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
stated; that this Chesapeake Bay, it is 
a tremendous resource to our Nation, 
recreational opportunities, the ship-
ping opportunities in it, never mind 
the wonderful seafood. 
I urge support of this bipartisan piece 
of legislation by all Members, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I am glad that this bill gets bipar-
tisan support from Members of Con-
gress and I intend to support the bill. I 
urge all my colleagues to support it. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1620, the Chesa-
peake Bay Program Reauthorization Act. I 
commend my colleague and fellow Virginian, 
Congresswoman ELAINE LURIA, for introducing 
this bill which will further the Chesapeake 
Bay’s ongoing restoration. As a co-chair of the 
bipartisan Chesapeake Bay Task Force, I rec-
ognize the critical role that the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and it’s Chesapeake 
Bay Program play in coordinating the multi- 
state restoration effort. I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor of this legislation. 
Deterioration of the Bay and how to best ad-
dress the problem has been a concern for al-
most half a century. While serving as a mem-
ber of the Virginia House of Delegates, I was 
part of a joint Virginia-Maryland legislative ad-
visory commission focused on determining 
what actions were necessary to address Bay 
issues. We concluded that restoring the Bay 
would require more than just Virginia and 
Maryland, but rather, the collaboration of the 
entire 64,000 square-mile watershed. 
The EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program, 
which was created during the Reagan Admin-
istration and ratified by Congress in 1987, fa-
cilitates the cooperation between the water-
shed states and the federal government to re-
store the Bay. Re-authorization of the critical 
Chesapeake Bay Program is long overdue. 
Increases in underwater grasses and the 
blue crab population indicate our efforts are 
working, however more resources and contin-
ued coordination efforts are necessary to en-
sure that these gains are maintained and that 
the Chesapeake Bay is protected. The Total 
Maximum Daily Load, sometimes referred to 
as a ‘‘pollution diet,’’ was established in 2010 
and is a key part of the EPA’s Chesapeake 
Bay Program and the EPA’s role in estab-
lishing and enforcing those limits are an es-
sential part of the ongoing restoration process. 
The Chesapeake Bay is a national commer-
cial, recreational, ecological treasure and we 
have a moral responsibility to preserve it. I 
commend the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure for reporting this bill favor-
ably to the full House and I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
NAPOLITANO) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1620, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GREAT LAKES RESTORATION 
INITIATIVE ACT OF 2019 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4031) to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to reau-
thorize the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4031 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative Act of 2019’’ or the 
‘‘GLRI Act of 2019’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO) and the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCH-
ELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4031. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 4031 would reauthorize Federal 
appropriations for EPA’s Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative. 
Introduced by the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), H.R. 4031 authorizes 
total appropriations of approximately 
$2.5 billion over the next 5 years for 
restoration efforts under EPA’s GLRI 
program. The wide support for this bi-
partisan program is evidenced by the 
diversity of cosponsors of the bill, in-
cluding many of the committee mem-
bers, such as Mr. GIBBS, Mr. CARSON, 
Mr. KATKO, Mr. MITCHELL, Mr. GALLA-
GHER, and Mr. STAUBER.

eight different States and is home to 
more than 30 million people. These

waters are a national treasure and con-
tain 84 percent of the fresh water of all 
North America. 
As a Representative of a State where 
the availability of water is always, al-
ways an issue, I recognize why the 
Great Lakes Members are so devoted to 
protecting the water supply. So are we. 
Congress needs to renew its commit-
ment to these types of programs which 
protect and restore our Nation’s water. 
We all know the current challenges 
facing our States to protect our water 
resource, including harmful effects of 
algal blooms. Many of our States are 
dealing with these challenges as we 
speak, and the Great Lakes are no ex-
ception. One such bloom in 2014 forced 
a drinking water ban that affected half 
a million people. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive has been a critical tool for EPA 
and Great Lakes States to address on-
going challenges on local water qual-
ity, including algal blooms. So H.R. 
4031 is necessary to support these ef-
forts. 
I urge all Members to support this 
very bipartisan bill to continue efforts 
for rehab on our precious Great Lakes. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters of support from: Backcountry 
Hunters & Anglers, the National Audu-
bon Society, and Healing Our Waters 
Great Lakes Coalition. 
BACKCOUNTRY HUNTERS & ANGLERS, 
Missoula, MT, September 18, 2019. 
Hon. PETER DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, House Transportation & Infrastruc-
ture Committee, Washington, DC. 
Hon. SAM GRAVES, 
Ranking Member, House Transportation & In-
frastructure Committee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
DEFAZIO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER GRAVES: On behalf of Backcountry 
Hunters & Anglers (BHA), the fastest grow-
ing organization that represents sportsmen 
and women in North America, I encourage 
you to support House Transportation & In-
frastructure Committee and floor passage of 
Rep. Elaine Luria’s (D–VA) Chesapeake Bay 
Program Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1620) and 
Rep. David Joyce’s (R–OH) Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative Act (H.R. 4031). 
Over the last decade the health of the 
Bay’s ecosystem has improved. However, 
with increased rainfall in the region and the 
amount of sediment, phosphorous, debris and 
nitrogen eroding into the Chesapeake water-
shed, the water quality is on the decline. 
H.R. 1620 reauthorizes an important con-
servation and restoration program that safe-
guards the Chesapeake Bay watershed and 
increases the funding level to $90 million for 
fiscal year 2020 and grows by $500,000 each 
year until fiscal year 2024. Lawmakers fund-
ed the Chesapeake Bay Program at $73 mil-
lion annually for the past few years. The ad-
ditional funds will restore the health of the 
Bay and boost the regional economy that de-
pends on it for agricultural and outdoor 
recreation opportunities. 
The second bill, H.R. 4031 reauthorizes 
funding to conserve and restore the Great 
Lakes, the largest bodies of fresh water in 
the world by incremental increases of $25 
million annually until fiscal year 2026. The 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is a suc-
cessful program that strategically targets 
critical areas through multiple action plans 
and public input. Increasing funds will fur-
thermore expand fish and habitat rehabilita-
tion and implement collaborative projects 
between federal, state and local stake-
holders. 
The Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes pro-
grams provide necessary federal investments 
that leverage state and local dollars to im-
prove water quality and fish and wildlife 
habitat for Canada geese, speckled trout and 
other game species. BHA believes H.R. 1620 
and H.R. 4031 are essential to the health of 
fish and wildlife and the general public who 
depend on clean water for agriculture and 
municipal needs at home. 
Thank you for the opportunity to express 
our support for the Chesapeake Bay Program 
Reauthorization Act and the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative Act. We look forward 
to working with you to advance the legisla-
tion through the House. 
Sincerely,

On behalf of the National Audubon Soci-
ety’s more than 1 million members, our mis-
sion is to protect birds and the places they 
need for today and tomorrow. We write to 
offer our support for the following bills re-
lated to important coastal and water con-
servation issues that will be the subject of 
the September 19, 2019 Markup before the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee. 
HR 4031—GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE 
ACT OF 2019 
The Great Lakes are home to 30 million 
people and 350 species of birds, but increasing 
challenges are on the horizon for the world’s 
largest body of freshwater. Fluctuating 
water levels exacerbated by climate change, 
invasive exotic species and excess nutrients 
are putting even more stress on this eco-
system that is so important for birds and 
people. The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive has helped clean up toxic pollutants, 
protect wildlife by restoring critical habitat, 
and help combat devastating invasive spe-
cies. 
HR 4031 would increase funding for con-
servation projects to $475 million over five 
years, by increasing the Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative’s authorization incremen-
tally from $300 million per year to $475 mil-
lion per year. 
HR 1132—SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION ACT 
The San Francisco Bay Area, home to the 
Pacific Coast’s largest estuary, is also home 
to a rapidly growing population of 8 million 
people, and provides for a host of social and 
economic values through ports and industry, 
agriculture, fisheries, archaeological and 
cultural sites, recreation, and research. How-
ever, San Francisco Bay has lost 90% of its 
tidal wetlands and more than 50% of its 
eelgrass 
and 
mudflat 
habitat. 
Climate 
change exacerbates these conditions through 
drought that alters the salinity balance, 
ocean acidification that reduces species 
abundance and diversity, increasing water 
temperatures, and rising seas causing flood-
ing that eliminates living shorelines and 
puts communities at risk. Many species of 
waterbirds forage in the San Francisco Bay, 
including Brant Geese and Surf Scoters, un-
derscoring the value of this ecosystem. 
HR 1132 would authorize a San Francisco 
Bay Restoration Grant Program in EPA and 
funding of up to $25m per year to support the 
restoration of this estuary. 
HR 1620—CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
Salt marshes are special places to birds 
and other wildlife, but sea level rise has ele-
vated the waters in the Chesapeake Bay by 
one foot during the 20th century and is accel-
erating due to climate change. Salt marshes 
provide valuable ‘‘ecosystem services’’, in-
cluding nurseries for the Chesapeake Bay’s 
commercially important fish, a buffer pro-
tecting coastal communities against storm 
surge, a filter that stops nutrient and sedi-
ment pollution from entering the Bay, and a 
recreational resource attracting visitors who 
contribute millions of dollars to local econo-
mies. Chesapeake Bay’s salt marshes host 
globally significant populations of both 
Saltmarsh Sparrow and Black Rail. 
HR 1620 would increase the authorization 
of appropriations for the Chesapeake Bay 
Program to more than $90m per year. 
HR 2247—PROMOTING UNITED GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO SAVE OUR SOUND ACT 
Despite significant investments in Puget 
Sound ecosystem health by state, federal, 
tribal and local governments, concerned 
members of the public, and conservation or-
ganizations, progress towards ecosystem re-
covery targets remains slow. The number of 
marine birds wintering in Puget Sound has 
declined significantly in the last 30 years and 
migratory, fisheating birds appear to be at 
the greatest risk. 
HR 2247 would authorize up to $50 million 
in funding for Puget Sound recovery. The 
PUGET SOS Act also aligns federal agency 
expertise and resources, ensuring that fed-
eral agencies are coordinated, setting goals, 
and holding each other accountable will help 
increase their effectiveness and provide a 
boost to Puget Sound recovery. 
HR 3779—RESILIENCE REVOLVING LOAN FUND ACT 
OF 2019 
Pre-disaster planning can help commu-
nities adapt to the changing flood patterns 
that threaten people and birds species de-
pendent on shoreline and riverine areas. 
These changes have led to more frequent in-
stances of ‘‘nuisance flooding,’’ as well as 
catastrophic events. NOAA has found that 
‘‘nuisance’’ or ‘‘sunny day’’ flooding is up 
300% to 900% than it was 50 years ago. In ad-
dition, catastrophic flooding events have in-
creased in both frequency and intensity. 
These trends have been particularly pro-
nounced in the Northeast, Midwest and 
upper Great Plains, where the amount of pre-
cipitation in large rainfall events has in-
creased more than 30 percent above the aver-
age observed from 1901–1960. As sea level rise 
accelerates, it only exacerbates these im-
pacts, which further compounds vulner-
ability in flood-prone communities. 
HR 3779 would amend the 1988 Stafford Act 
to offer low-interest loans to states for ‘‘dis-
aster mitigation projects’’, including invest-
ments in natural infrastructure projects, 
which would help communities prepare and 
recover from natural disasters. 
We urge you to support and advance the 
bills listed above. Please feel free to contact 
us with any questions. 
Sincerely, 
JULIE HILL-GABRIEL, 
Vice President, Water Conservation, 
National Audubon Society.

February 5, 2020 
HEALING OUR WATERS, GREAT LAKES 
COALITION, 
December 3, 2019. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: On behalf of the 
Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition, I 
write to urge the House of Representatives 
to bring to the floor for consideration H.R. 
4031, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
Act of 2019, before the end of the year. The 
bill, which is led by Reps. David Joyce and 
Marcy Kaptur, has broad bipartisan support 
with 50 cosponsors almost evenly divided and 
was unanimously supported in the Transpor-
tation & Infrastructure Committee in Sep-
tember. The Great Lakes define our region’s 
way of life, provide drinking water for over 
30 million Americans, and is at the heart of 
a binational economy that is the 3rd largest 
in the world. The Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative has been restoring these waters 
and protecting the health and well-being of 
those that rely on them. 
H.R. 4031 reauthorizes the successful Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative and helps meet 
the on-the-ground needs of communities by 
increasing the annual authorization over five 
years to $475 million. Over the past decade 
the GLRI has improved lives across Great 
Lakes communities after decades of environ-
mental damage threatened public health, the 
regional economy, and drinking water. The 
GLRI has allowed the 8–state region to un-
dertake one of the world’s largest freshwater 
ecosystem restoration projects. Since its in-
ception, the initiative has resulted in eco-
nomic returns of more than 3 to 1 across the 
region and made tremendous progress. For 
example, the GLRI has: 
Tripled the delisting of areas with extreme 
degradation (Areas of Concern or AOCs) 
Increased the remediation of environ-
mental and public health impairments near-
ly sevenfold 
Doubled farmland acres under conserva-
tion, reducing nutrient and sediment runoff 
Invested in critical research and fore-
casting of toxic algal blooms 
Controlled and stopped the advance of 
invasive species 
Restored habitat connectivity to over 5,250 
river miles 
Even with these results, there is still much 
work to be done. Two-thirds of beneficial use 
impairments remain untreated across 19 
AOCs, placing the health of communities at 
risk. Drinking water and coastal economies 
remain under threat from toxic algal blooms 
that have shut down entire water systems, as 
was seen in Toledo, Ohio in 2014. Invasive 
species, like Asian Carp, are knocking at the 
door of the lakes and threaten its $7 billion 
fishery. Moreover, emerging contaminants 
and a changing climate continue to exacer-
bate the challenges we face, many of which 
disproportionately impact people that have 
historically borne the brunt of environ-
mental injustice. This underscores the ur-
gency for the GLRI to address these growing 
threats by working to ensure restoration in-
vestments lead to equitable outcomes for ev-
eryone in the region. 
The GLRI has been an environmental and 
economic success, but much work remains. 
The region stands ready to continue this im-
portant federal partnership and ensure that 
all benefit from and enjoy these investments 
in restoration and protection. 
Since 2004, the Healing Our Waters-Great 
Lakes Coalition has been harnessing the col-
lective power of more than 160 non-govern-
mental organizations representing millions 
of people, whose common goal is to restore 
and protect the Great Lakes. We are pleased 
to offer our support for this much-needed bill 
and urge House leadership to bring the bill 
to the floor for a vote. 
Sincerely, 
LAURA RUBIN, 
Director. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4031. H.R. 
4031 is a critical bill to reauthorize the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an 
initiative near and dear to my heart 
and the Great Lakes Caucus. 
The Great Lakes, as was noted, is the 
largest system of fresh surface water in 
the world. The GLRI, as it is known, 
has been a catalyst for unprecedented 
partnership between Federal, State, 
and local agencies for years to improve 
the ecosystem, to improve water qual-
ity, and to support the economy of the 
entire Great Lakes region and the Na-
tion. 
H.R. 4031 has broad and bipartisan 
support with nearly 50 cosponsors, and 
I am proud to be one of those cospon-
sors. I thank our Members for contin-
ued support for the restoration of our 
Great Lakes. This issue is very impor-
tant to my district and many other 
Members’ districts in our Congress 
here. 
The Great Lakes have an incredible 
impact on our region’s way of life that 
cannot be overstated. At one point in 
time when I was younger, we actually 
had a license plate that called Michi-
gan the Water Wonderland because of 
the importance of the Great Lakes on 
our State. 
States all along the Great Lakes rely 
on them as a freshwater resource, a 
driver of our local and national econ-
omy, and a world-renowned recreation 
destination. It impacts from Minnesota 
all the way to New York. 
In my home State of Michigan, we 
have the most Great Lakes shoreline of 
any State, with more than 3,000 miles 
of our State shaped by four of the five 
Great Lakes. My district is nearly sur-
rounded by the Great Lakes system. 
The projects that the GLRI makes 
possible have a proven track record of 
success and impact in our commu-
nities. 
Take the Marysville shoreline in 
Michigan’s 10th District, my home dis-
trict, as an example. The GLRI pro-
vided the funds to remove a failing sea-
wall and replace it with a natural, slop-
ing shore. 
Additionally, further south of my 
district, the restoration of wetlands in 
the Harsens Island area provided habi-
tat for waterfowl and fish that had 
been destroyed over the years. 
These projects resulted in the cre-
ation of jobs in the region, habitat res-
toration for wildlife, and a pathway for 
people to walk along the river or the 
lake, to view and enjoy it. This is one 
of the countless examples that high-
lights the importance of the GLRI for 
Great Lakes communities like mine 
and throughout the region. 
GLRI investments have delivered 
great outcomes, but there is more work 
to be done to protect our Great Lakes, 
including 
stopping 
the 
spread 
of 
invasive species, like Asian carp; pro-
tecting our drinking water, a critical 
and urgent need; and restoring habitat 
loss. 
I have advocated for GLRI since I ar-
rived here and recently spoke with the 
President about the importance of the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. It 
is crucial that Congress continues to 
authorize this program that protects 
and restores the Great Lakes. It, like 
many other estuaries we have talked 
about today, is a national treasure 
that our country relies on for drinking 
water, commerce, and more. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4031 offers a 
chance to continue this support. I urge 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
JOYCE and Chairwoman NAPOLITANO for 
their leadership on this matter. I rise 
today in support of the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative Act to protect 
and improve the health of the Great 
Lakes and directly benefit the sur-
rounding region. 
I hail from Chicago and the Nation’s 
gold coast along Lake Michigan. We 
know how important a healthy Great 
Lakes system is. Lake Michigan is not 
only Chicago’s primary drinking water 
source, it is part of the largest fresh-
water source in the world, our beloved 
Great Lakes. Lake Michigan is a tre-
mendous recreational resource and eco-
nomic asset for Chicago and the State 
of Illinois. 
Longstanding concerns, like the po-
tential of Asian carp migrating into 
the lake, underscore the importance of 
advancing this important legislation. 
This bill will support many projects 
important to the region. Chicago pub-
lic schools, for example, were able to 
install green infrastructure and new 
community space at four elementary 
schools. The project added 1.2 million 
gallons of onsite stormwater storage 
capacity to reduce stormwater runoff 
throughout Chicago. 
In Beach Park, Illinois, a project 
helped stabilize and protect streambed 
habitat. This, in turn, reduced nutrient 
pollution, sediment runoff, and in-
creased water quality in both Bull 
Creek and Lake Michigan. 
This bill will provide a much-needed 
increase in funding for the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative to support the 
continued restoration of coastal wet-
lands, the preservation of water qual-
ity, and the control of invasive species. 
H.R. 4031 will protect the Great 
Lakes for future generations. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. I 
thank Chairwoman NAPOLITANO
and 
Representative JOYCE
for advancing 
this important measure.

February 5, 2020 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
rise today in support of my bill, the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act 
of 2019. 
First, I thank Congresswoman MARCY 
KAPTUR and the 48 other Members from 
both sides of the aisle who cosponsored 
this important legislation. These Mem-
bers come from each of the eight Great 
Lakes States, and they have been in-
strumental in advancing this bill to 
the House floor. 
I also thank my colleagues on the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee 
who 
unanimously 
sup-
ported the GLRI Act of 2019 during its 
markup back in September. 
I cherish my memories growing up on 
the shores of Lake Erie, fishing and 
swimming with my family and friends. 
Everyone in this Chamber knows that I 
am not shy about my commitment to 
protect and restore the Great Lakes, 
for both current and future generations 
of Americans. 
The Great Lakes are a key economic 
driver for our Nation. More than 1.5 
million jobs are directly connected to 
the lakes, generating $62 billion in 
wages annually. That is not to mention 
the fact that the Great Lakes Basin is 
home to more than 30 million people 
and that the lakes hold roughly 21 per-
cent of the entire world’s freshwater 
supply. 
That is why I was proud to introduce 
this bill to authorize this critically im-
portant Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative for an additional 5 years and in-
crease the program’s annual authorized 
funding level, ensuring communities 
across the Great Lakes region, includ-
ing those in my own district of north-
east Ohio, can continue to address 
their on-the-ground needs. 
Through the Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative, also known as GLRI, 
EPA coordinates its efforts with other 
Federal partners like the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, as well as State 
agencies, local communities, and non-
profit organizations. 
GLRI projects have led to significant 
environmental benefits in the Great 
Lakes region since the program was 
created, helping restore more than 
50,000 acres of coastal wetlands and re-
duce nutrient runoff that leads to 
harmful algal blooms like the one that 
shut down Toledo’s water system in 
2014, impacting hundreds of thousands 
of Ohioans. 
The program also provides for a wide 
range of economic benefits, like pro-
tecting the $7 billion Great Lakes fish-
ery from invasive species like the 
Asian carp. 
In fact, a recent study showed that 
every dollar spent on GLRI projects 
through 2016 produces more than $3 in 
additional economic activity in the re-
gion. This means jobs and economic de-
velopment in waterfront communities 
like Mentor, Ashtabula, and Conneaut, 
Ohio. 
Simply put, without the GLRI, crit-
ical environmental restoration activi-
ties and strong economic growth would 
never have happened. The bill is a 
great example of the progress we can 
make when we work together to ad-
dress the issues facing our commu-
nities. 
While we have made progress in our 
efforts to address nearshore health, 
invasive species, toxic substances, and 
wildlife habitat, much more work re-
mains to be done to protect the Great 
Lakes. That is why I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
4031, working across party lines to pro-
tect the invaluable natural resource 
and economic powerhouse that is the 
Great Lakes system. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly sup-
port this bill, which would increase 
funding to the Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative to $475 million by the 
year 2026. 
This funding is essential to the 
health of the Great Lakes. We have 
made incredible progress to restore 
plant and animal habitats, control 
invasive species, combat harmful algal 
blooms, improve water quality, and 
clean up the environment of this re-
gion. 
The revitalization of the Buffalo 
River in my district, which was once 
declared ecologically dead, environ-
mentally destroyed, it is now a des-
tination for nature and recreation and 
is one of the great success stories of 
this program. 
It has yielded impressive economic 
benefits. Every $1 in funding generates 
$3.35 in economic activity. In Buffalo, 
the number is greater than $4. 
Attacks on clean water now threaten 
the progress that we have already 
made, and there is still much work left 
to be done. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in enthusiastically supporting this 
bill. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. GIBBS). 
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, no question, the Great 
Lakes are an important environmental 
and economic resource of the United 
States—$200 billion in economic activ-
ity. So many communities rely on the 
Great Lakes for drinking water, jobs, 
recreation, and more. 
While the Great Lakes may have had 
a troubled environmental history, re-
cent restoration and protection efforts 
have been successful. 
The GLRI is a major factor in these 
efforts, funding projects that will ulti-
mately leave the Great Lakes in a bet-
ter condition for future generations to 
enjoy. 
Several years ago, when I was chair-
man of the subcommittee with juris-
diction, we had some concerns, so in 
our oversight responsibility and to pro-
tect taxpayer dollars, I requested the 
GAO do a study of this program, and it 
came back with an excellent return. 
That is why I think we are getting 
some of these returns about what is 
going on. Also, it is important that 
that study gave us some helpful ideas 
to improve the program. We are seeing 
that today, and the program is working 
very well. 
I feel good that we did that study, 
and we know what is going on. We 
know the taxpayer dollars are pro-
tected, and we did our oversight role. 
Ohio is home to many important 
projects funded by the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative: State commis-
sions to reduce phosphorous, Asian 
carp prevention, and various habitat 
restoration projects. The GLRI re-
mains an essential element in repair-
ing and preserving the Great Lakes. 
I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. 
JOYCE) for sponsoring this bill. I urge 
my colleagues to support passage of 
H.R. 4031. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I am so very pleased to rise in sup-
port of this bipartisan legislation to re-
authorize and strengthen the Great 
Lakes 
Restoration 
Initiative, 
the 
GLRI. 
Twenty percent of the world’s fresh-
water resides in the Great Lakes. It is 
a national treasure and a regional eco-
nomic engine. 
I remember when I was first elected 
in 2004. On election night, I was so ex-
cited because I said now I get to rep-
resent Lake Michigan. It is one of my 
favorite constituents. 
In its mere one decade of existence, 
the GLRI has not only generated envi-
ronmental benefits, but it is helping to 
generate economic development as wa-
terways that were once polluted, unus-
able, and off-limits to the public have 
become attractive to not only rec-
reational users but to businesses that 
are able to open their doors to the pub-
lic. 
GLRI investments have been used in 
over 4,000 projects across almost 300,000 
square miles of the Great Lakes Basin. 
It is truly a win-win. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill takes the next 
step to support the ongoing efforts and 
partnerships that are making this pro-
gram so successful in Great Lakes com-
munities. 
While I don’t have much time, I want 
to highlight a couple of efforts that my 
constituents who are hard at work to 
make use of the funds that protect 
Lake Michigan. Here is one story of a 
small business owner. 
Beth Handle is the owner and oper-
ator of Milwaukee Kayak Company, lo-
cated right on the Milwaukee River in 
downtown Milwaukee. She came to my

office to share how cleaning up this 
river has benefited her business. Clean-
ing up the river changed the river from 
a place that people didn’t want to go. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to Ms. 
MOORE. 
b 1415 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, cleaning 
up the river changed the river from a 
place that people didn’t want to go, 
and now it is where families go to pad-
dle board, swim, and explore the river 
and our city. Of course, Milwaukee is A 
Great Place on a Great Lake. 
The 
Milwaukee 
Water 
Commons, 
while not directly funded by the GLRI, 
has been working with grantees and 
others to make sure that communities 
that have been historically disengaged 
are in those conversations. 
Our Metropolitan Sewerage District 
is using it to clean up the Milwaukee 
Estuary, where there is a gathering of 
three rivers: the Kinnickinnic, the Mil-
waukee, and the Menomonee Rivers. 
This estuary is one of 30 areas of pollu-
tion concerns in the Great Lakes. The 
GLRI would fund 65 percent of these 
projects. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
bill, and I am so delighted that we are 
debating it here on the floor in this bi-
partisan manner. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
WALORSKI), 
my 
col-
league. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4031, the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative Act. 
GLRI is a vital program that coordi-
nates Federal efforts among 15 agencies 
to address the most significant chal-
lenges facing the Great Lakes. 
The Great Lakes are among our most 
precious natural resources and a key 
economic driver in my home State of 
Indiana. For instance, the recreational 
boating industry alone provides $2 bil-
lion to Indiana’s economy each year. 
Yet the environmental and economic 
health of our region is under threat 
from a host of issues facing the Great 
Lakes, including pollution, severe ero-
sion, loss of native habitat, invasive 
species, and destructive algae blooms. 
GLRI is a critical investment in pre-
serving and protecting the Great Lakes 
as well as creating jobs and growing 
our economy. That is why I am proud 
to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4031, 
which would reauthorize the program 
funding through fiscal year 2026. 
Protecting and improving the Great 
Lakes means making sure current and 
future generations can experience the 
natural beauty and the recreational ac-
tivities like fishing, boating, and hik-
ing that have always been important to 
our part of the Midwest. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rep-
resentatives JOYCE
and KAPTUR
for 
their hard work on this bipartisan leg-
islation. I also want to thank my fel-
low Hoosier, Congressman PETE VIS-
CLOSKY, for his decades of service and 
his leadership in making the Indiana 
Dunes Indiana’s first national park. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
protect the Great Lakes by voting for 
H.R. 4031. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 12 min-
utes remaining. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chairwoman of the 
Water 
Resources 
and 
Environment 
Subcommittee for yielding me this 
time, 
and 
I 
thank 
her 
for 
her 
unyielding support for water issues 
across this country, including in our 
very critical Great Lakes region. She 
has been a true and unyielding cham-
pion on these issues, and I thank her. 
Today’s package of bills includes key 
priorities for protecting not just our 
Great Lakes, but ecosystems across 
our country. H.R. 4031, the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative Act of 2019, en-
joys broad support from the Great 
Lakes region. The 49 cosponsors of the 
bill represent every ideological per-
spective of our caucus, and today’s bill, 
which is on suspension, is a testament 
of that bipartisan, bicameral critical 
support. 
In that vein, Mr. Speaker, I must 
also commend my colleague from Ohio, 
Congressman DAVID
JOYCE, for his 
steadfast effort to work collaboratively 
to collect signatures for H.R. 4031 so we 
could move it from 2019 to 2020. 
This Great Lakes Act recognizes the 
enormous, unmet need for the region. 
The interagency collaborative effort 
has brought to bear resources, exper-
tise, and stakeholders from across the 
local, State, and Federal portions of 
the region and helped to focus re-
sources on a major hot spot. 
The Maumee River is the largest 
river that flows into the entire Great 
Lakes and is also facing gigantic harm-
ful algal blooms. The Maumee River 
dumps all of these nutrients into Lake 
Erie, which then feeds the most pro-
ductive part of the lake, endangering, 
annually, native species and creating 
massive harmful algal blooms with the 
critical 
ingredient 
of 
microcystin, 
which is toxic. 
Annually, the harmful algal blooms 
threaten Toledo’s drinking water sys-
tem, which had to be shut down 3 years 
ago. It threatens the safety of our 
beaches and longevity of our eco-
system. 
This Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive is assisting communities to ad-
dress the root causes of the blooms. 
Since 2010, over 4,000 projects have 
been completed across the basin, the 
largest watershed in the entire Great 
Lakes, and a recent University of 
Michigan study revealed that each dol-
lar spent on the Great Lakes Restora-
tion Initiative will result in $3.35 mil-
lion in additional economic activity. 
The long-term goals of the initiative 
are delisting of the areas of concern, 
ensuring that fish are safe to eat and 
the Asian carp is kept out, and control 
of numerous environmental problems 
across our lakes, the largest source of 
freshwater on our continent. 
Today’s legislation offers a ramp-up 
back to the level for the restoration 
initiative initially envisioned when the 
program was first funded in fiscal year 
2010. So it is pretty new as Federal pro-
grams go. This gradual ramp-up rep-
resents a consensus across the delega-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation on 
final passage. 
Again, I want to thank Chairwoman 
GRACE NAPOLITANO for her work across 
both sides of the aisle and with Mem-
bers of this House from every region of 
the country. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), my colleague 
and the co-chair of the Great Lakes 
Task Force. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of continued preserva-
tion and restoration of the Great Lakes 
through the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative, a very important initiative 
for the Great Lakes system. 
For Michiganders, the Great Lakes 
are directly linked to our identity, our 
way of life, our history, and our future. 
The Great Lakes basin is home to 
more than 30 million people, and it 
contains 90 percent of the Nation’s 
fresh surface water supply. Many know 
that, but they don’t always understand 
the economic impact. That provides 
the backbone of a $6 trillion regional 
economy. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive has a strong track record of suc-
cess, specifically in west Michigan, 
where the work to clean up toxic 
hotspots in areas like Muskegon is es-
timated to have increased property val-
ues by nearly $12 million and generated 
$1 million in new recreational spend-
ing. This holds true across west Michi-
gan and the entire region, as every dol-
lar invested in the GLRI generates 
more than $3 in additional long-term 
economic activity. 
The GLRI is critical to our efforts to 
protect drinking water, prevent the 
spread of invasive species, and to accel-
erate the cleanup of areas of concern. 
With the threat of Asian carp inun-
dating our waters, high water levels 
and erosion threatening our shorelines, 
and the ongoing threat of PFAS con-
tamination contaminating our water, 
we must be committed to bipartisan 
solutions to protect this critical re-
source. 
Recently, my Republican colleagues 
and I had an opportunity to spend some 
time with the President, and he recom-
mitted his support for the GLRI and

towards the Great Lakes, as well as 
making sure that Brandon Road and 
other efforts to keep invasive species 
out are happening. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Michigan. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, the 
GLRI is a bipartisan example of an ef-
fective and efficient use of taxpayer 
dollars that protects, preserves, and 
strengthens the Great Lakes today and 
for future generations. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman from California for 
yielding and for all of her hard work on 
this bill. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 4031, 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive—or the GLRI, as we all call it— 
Act of 2019, which will reauthorize the 
GLRI for 5 years and increase author-
ized funding for the program to $475 
million, annually, by fiscal year 2026. 
Through the GLRI program, we have 
been able to clean up and delist envi-
ronmental areas of concern. We have 
been able to restore coastal wetlands, 
as many of my colleagues have talked 
about, mitigate harmful algae blooms, 
combat invasive species, and do much 
more to help protect, restore, and 
maintain the Great Lakes ecosystems 
and strengthen our regional economy. 
And, as people have seen on the floor 
today, this issue has shared strong bi-
partisan support at all times. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for helping to educate the President on 
the importance of the GLRI. 
The Great Lakes are not only a 
treasured natural resource, but a way 
of life that supports communities and 
jobs throughout the region. They are 21 
percent of the world’s freshwater sup-
ply. 
Building on what my colleague from 
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) was talking 
about, my colleague, Ms. TLAIB, and I 
were able to kayak on the Rouge River 
on the 50th anniversary of its having 
caught on fire. We were surrounded by 
industry, but we also saw bald eagles 
and herons, and she got the most beau-
tiful picture of a painted turtle. 
Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Great 
Lakes Task Force, I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor, and I thank my col-
leagues, Representatives DAVID JOYCE 
and MARCY
KAPTUR, for their great 
leadership on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important bill 
to ensure our Great Lakes are pro-
tected for all future generations. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire of the balance of time on both 
sides, please. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan has 91⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
California has 61⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), another col-
league. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 4031, 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
Act of 2019, not just because my dis-
trict has Lake Erie on its borders, but 
because of the impact of such a great 
proposal that has had bipartisan sup-
port and, now, thankfully, even as re-
cently as just this last week, to talk 
with the President with my colleagues 
and know of his support as well. 
The Great Lakes are something that 
we all treasure in Michigan, and they 
are central to our State’s economy and 
way of life. As stewards of this natural 
resource, it is incumbent on us to take 
care of them so that future generations 
can enjoy their beauty, their bounty, 
and their economic benefits. That is 
why the bipartisan support for GLRI is 
so overwhelming. 
For the past decade, the GLRI has 
been the driving force behind cleaning 
up and protecting the Great Lakes. 
Funds from this successful program go 
towards restoring wetlands, combating 
harmful 
algae 
blooms, 
stopping 
invasive 
species, 
and 
much, 
much 
more. With additional resources, we 
can accelerate and expand GLRI’s im-
pact even more for the citizens of not 
only our States, but of this great coun-
try. 
I am proud to join my colleagues in 
this bipartisan effort to preserve the 
Great Lakes and continue it long into 
the future as beneficial for all who ex-
perience the greatness of what it is. 
Let’s pass this critical legislation. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding to 
me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative Act’s reauthorization. 
As has been mentioned before, I 
think, the Great Lakes represent 21 
percent of the world’s surface fresh-
water. 
I am glad to see so many of my col-
leagues from the Great Lakes region 
here, but, really, all of us and the rest 
of the world have a stake in this. 
The Great Lakes provide drinking 
water for 45 million Americans. 
b 1430 
The lakes support one of the world’s 
largest regional economies through ag-
riculture, industry, fishing, and recre-
ation. 
For thousands of plants and animal 
species and millions of Americans, the 
Great Lakes are vital for life, and are 
our national treasure. 
I wanted to say, this is really per-
sonal for me. The eastern border of my 
district, running from Chicago to the 
northern suburbs, is Lake Michigan. I 
live just a few blocks from the lake 
myself and have spent every summer of 
my childhood on the beach in Indiana 
enjoying the lake. 
But we are threatened right now by 
climate change and pollution. Last 
year, the Midwest saw record flooding, 
worsening storms, harmful runoff, and 
toxic 
algae 
blooms 
that 
threaten 
drinking water and infrastructure. 
Actually, we saw thousands of Amer-
icans who couldn’t drink the water be-
cause of that algae bloom. And in my 
hometown of Evanston, beaches are 
closing or actually disappearing en-
tirely because the levels of the lake are 
at record highs right now. 
Just last month, these record water 
levels destroyed lakefront paths, and I 
was getting calls from condominium 
owners who were worried about their 
buildings getting—not demolished—but 
certainly damaged because of the high 
lake waters. 
New estimates from the Army Corps 
of Engineers state that the lake levels 
could get even higher next year, and we 
are watching for that with great dis-
tress. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive is absolutely essential to restoring 
the health and unpolluting the lake 
and protecting the grandeur of our 
lakes. 
This is a bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. People on both sides of the aisle 
are down here speaking eloquently 
about the meaning of the Great Lakes 
to them, and it is really refreshing, I 
think, for all of us to be able to join 
hands together asking for the reau-
thorization of the Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative Act. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of H.R. 4031, the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act 
of 2019. 
First, I want to thank my good 
friends from Ohio, Mr. JOYCE and Ms. 
KAPTUR, for their leadership on this 
legislation. The Great Lakes are an es-
sential natural resource, not only for 
my district and State, but for the en-
tire country. 
One of the world’s largest bodies of 
fresh water, the Great Lakes provide 
fresh drinking water for over 30 million 
people. In addition, the Great Lakes 
serves as an economic engine, gener-
ating $8.4 billion in wages, and sup-
porting over 300,000 jobs. 
But the Great Lakes are more than a 
source of revenue. Ask any of my con-
stituents what the Great Lakes mean 
to them, and they will tell you they 
are an essential part of what makes 
northeast Ohio such a great place to 
live, work, and raise a family. 
Over the past decade, both Demo-
crats and Republicans have understood 
the importance of protecting the Great 
Lakes. Since 2010, the GLRI has cata-
lyzed critical restoration action that 
both restores and protects the Great 
Lakes. In fact, for every dollar spent 
under the GLRI, an estimated $3.35 in 
economic activity is produced. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 4031 and ensure the preserva-
tion of our waterways and ecosystems 
for future generations.

H805 
February 5, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honor to be able to speak on this 
initiative, given what is going on in 
the other house today where we have so 
much partisanship. This is the type of 
bipartisan work we should be doing. 
I am honored to be a cosponsor of the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. My 
district goes along Lake Michigan. I 
know it means so much for the commu-
nities of Port Washington, Sheboygan, 
Manitowoc and Two Rivers. 
I would just like to clean up a little 
something here. I know a few years ago 
in 2013, there was a great deal of con-
cern that the watermark in Lake 
Michigan was at an all-time low. Peo-
ple talked about climate change and 
how bad that was. It was good to report 
now in 2020 in January on the 30-year 
high on Lake Michigan. So maybe that 
is the reason for a crisis as well, but it 
is interesting to see how things kind of 
ebb and flow on Lake Michigan. 
As previously has been said, about a 
fifth of the fresh water in lakes in the 
world is in Lake Michigan by itself. 
Lake Michigan is the fifth biggest lake 
in the world. We have had problems 
with invasive species, which is one of 
the major reasons why I am on this 
bill. 
We want to keep the lakes clean not 
only for consuming water, but the fish-
eries, the fishing going on there is im-
portant, and recreation on Lake Michi-
gan is important. 
A lot of this money goes into the ag-
riculture in places like Wisconsin. We 
do have to keep the lakes clean, and as 
we keep our farms clean, it results in 
less algae blooms and a healthier lake 
system. 
So, in any event, I am honored to be 
a cosponsor on this. I am pleased that 
the Speaker has decided to put such a 
great bipartisan bill on the floor today. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Let me close with this: This bill 
passed committee with strong bipar-
tisan support. As my colleagues have 
noted, including Mrs. WALORSKI, rec-
reational use of the Great Lakes is an 
important component of the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative. 
As I close, I would like to quote the 
immortal words of country superstar, 
Craig Morgan. It is a little unusual, 
but I think it is appropriate today. 
He said in a song: 
I’m meetin’ my buddies out on the lake 
We’re headed out to a special place we love 
That just a few folks know 
There’s no signin’ up, no monthly dues 
Take your Johnson, your Mercury or your 
Evinrude and fire it up 
Meet us out at party cove 
Come on in; the water’s fine 
Just idle on over, and toss us a line 
Support reauthorization of the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to hear that this has such 
great bipartisan support. It truly is an 
amazing bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
NAPOLITANO) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4031. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

BASIN FOUNDATION, 
February 4, 2020. 
Re H.R. 4275: Support to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to reauthor-
ize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Res-
toration Program. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI & MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY: I would like to express our sup-
port for H.R. 4275—the reauthorization of the 
Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program 
within the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy. This program provides resources vital to 
the restoration of the ecological health of 
the Basin, as well as public education 
projects. 
Although Lake Pontchartrain and its sur-
rounding area continue to face environ-
mental challenges, the Lake and its re-
sources have made a tremendous comeback. 
Much of this success is due to interested and 
concerned citizens who want a clean, healthy 
Lake and Basin for this and future genera-
tions, all of which would not be possible 
without your support of this PRP funding. 
Sincerely, 
KRISTI L. TRAIL, P.E., 
Executive Director. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, 
H.R. 4275 will reauthorize EPA’s Lake 
Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Pro-
gram for the next 5 years. 
Introduced by the gentlemen from 
Louisiana, Mr. GRAVES and Mr. RICH-
MOND, it reauthorizes the program for 
the next 5 years with continued fund-
ing of $20 million annually over 5 
years. It also caps EPA’s administra-
tive expenses at 5 percent. 
At our June subcommittee hearing, 
we 
received 
testimony 
on 
current 
threats to the Lake Pontchartrain re-
gion and its watershed. Covering a 
10,000-square-mile area, the basin faces

impacts from logging, urban, and agri-
culture runoff, sewage overflows and 
nonpoint source pollution. 
This is an example of human develop-
ment having an extreme impact on the 
entire watershed, capable of causing 
entire dead zones as we are now seeing. 
With 
impaired 
wetlands 
prevented 
from acting as natural filters for these 
pollutants, the entire lake is at risk. 
This program represents a collabo-
rative effort for Federal, State, and 
local entities to restore the ecological 
health of the basin. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4275, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4275. H.R. 4275 represents good govern-
ance to reauthorize the Lake Pont-
chartrain Basin Restoration Program. 
The Lake Pontchartrain Basin water-
shed is home to approximately 2.2 mil-
lion people and covers 5,000 square 
miles. 
In June of last year when the Sub-
committee on Water Resources and En-
vironment held a hearing on many of 
these regional watershed programs, we 
invited Ms. Kristi Trail from the Lake 
Pontchartrain Basin Foundation to 
testify on the need and importance of 
reauthorizing this program. 
During that hearing, we heard that 
Lake 
Pontchartrain 
and 
its 
sur-
rounding watershed play an integral 
part of the wetland ecosystem of the 
Gulf Coast, contributing over $35 mil-
lion to the local economy. 
As a result of the Lake Pont-
chartrain Basin Foundation’s work 
through this program, the lake is mak-
ing a tremendous comeback by con-
structing multiple reefs for fish habi-
tats, improving previously impaired 
water bodies, and growing their com-
munity outreach programs. 
I would like to thank Mr. GARRET 
GRAVES, the sponsor of this bill, for 
putting this forward and for his sup-
port. 
I also would like to recognize the fact 
that we limit the EPA’s administration 
to 5 percent. So the money goes to re-
store Lake Pontchartrain. 
For these reasons and numerous oth-
ers, I urge support of this program and 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Mr. 
GRAVES), the sponsor of the bill. 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I promise to conserve time 
and conserve the lake. 
Mr. Speaker, Lake Pontchartrain is 
perhaps not a very well-known lake. It 
is actually the second largest saltwater 
lake in the United States, but it wasn’t 
always this way. 
Lake Pontchartrain, as a result of 
coastal land loss in Louisiana, has had 
this intrusion of saltwater that has 
fundamentally changed the ecosystem 
of that lake and the communities. 
This is a lake that serves as a water-
shed for 16 parishes in Louisiana, 4 
counties in Mississippi, and most im-
portantly, this lake takes the brunt of 
the surge from 2 Canadian provinces 
and 31 States. 
Mr. Speaker, what happens is each 
time we have these high-water years on 
the Mississippi River system which 
drains 31 States and 2 Canadian prov-
inces, there is an emergency relief 
valve that sends water through the 
Bonnet Carre Spillway into Lake Pont-
chartrain. 
This isn’t water that is coming from 
Louisiana. In fact, less than 1 percent 
of the water is even coming from the 
State of Mississippi. It is water coming 
from all of these States, from Montana, 
to New York, to Canada, and all of 
these States in this large watershed 
funnel in-between. 
And so on average, the Bonnet Carre 
Spillway had been operated once every 
decade; once every 10 years. Yet, in re-
cent years, we have had to open it four 
times, including last year. Last year, 
for the first time ever, it was opened in 
January, and for the first time ever, it 
was actually operated twice in 1 year. 
And so this is in the State of Lou-
isiana. This is this lake, this basin, 
this watershed that has been taking it 
on the chin for the rest of the country. 
b 1445 
The reason this is important, Mr. 
Speaker, is because this lake is an in-
credibly productive ecosystem with 
recreational and commercial fishing. 
You see lots of folks out there in sail-
boats and other boats out there enjoy-
ing the lake. 
What has been happening as a result 
of all the Nation’s water’s drainage 
coming into here is that the health of 
the lake has been compromised and 
challenged, which therefore affects our 
fisheries, both recreational and com-
mercial, and the millions of pounds of 
crabs that are harvested out of the 
lake. 
This lake bounds New Orleans and 
Jefferson Parish. It bounds the north 
shore and the river parishes, such as 
Saint John Parish and Saint Charles 
Parish over on the west side. 
This is an important part of Lou-
isiana. Because of the coastal land loss 
that we have experienced and the 
change in this ecosystem, we must 
make investments to maintain this as 
we help to manage this rapid and un-
fortunate transition from a freshwater 
lake into a brackish and saltwater lake 
that we now have. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my 
good friend from California, the chair 
of the subcommittee, Congresswoman 
NAPOLITANO, and her staff, Ryan. I 
want 
to 
thank 
Congressman 
WESTERMAN, the ranking member of 
the subcommittee; Ian Bennitt as well 
as Maggie Ayrea on our staff for all the 
work they put into this; and, of course, 
Chairman DEFAZIO and Ranking Mem-
ber SAM GRAVES for all their work in 
ensuring that we get this bill right and 
that we have the right caps on here to 
ensure that the money goes to actually 
investing in the lake, as Congressman 
MITCHELL
mentioned, as opposed to 
going toward bureaucracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bipartisan legislation that we have in-
troduced with my friend, Congressman 
CEDRIC RICHMOND of New Orleans. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I am prepared to 
close, Mr. Speaker, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league, Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana, and 
all sponsors in support of this bill. As I 
indicated earlier, it has bipartisan sup-
port of the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both 
sides’ staff. They have been doing a 
marvelous job. Of course, I thank the 
chairmen and the ranking members of 
both committees for all the support 
they have gotten on all these impor-
tant bills on water. 
Water is the economy, and we realize 
that we have to clean it up and help 
the communities work with the States 
and other entities. We will get it done. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
NAPOLITANO) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4275, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on the measure be-
fore us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The Representative Payee Fraud Pre-
vention Act is a commonsense bipar-
tisan bill that would protect recipients 
of Federal pensions from unscrupulous 
representatives who use the money for 
their own benefit instead of the retir-
ees’. Currently, representative payees 
can receive pension benefits on behalf 
of a recipient who is a minor, is des-
ignated mentally incompetent, or has 
another disability. 
Embezzlement or conversion of So-
cial Security and veterans benefits by 
a representative payee is a Federal fel-
ony. However, there is no Federal pen-
alty in current law for representative 
payees who embezzle or convert Fed-
eral retirement benefits to their own 
use. 
The Representative Payee Fraud Pre-
vention Act would close this loophole 
and apply the same penalties to those 
representative payees who misuse Fed-
eral pension benefits. We must ensure 
that those who have spent their careers 
in public service receive the benefits 
they have earned. 
I want to thank my friend and col-
league, Representative TLAIB, for her 
hard work, along with Representative 
MEADOWS. It is a bipartisan effort on 
this important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense measure, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5214, the Representative Payee Fraud 
Prevention Act. 
Federal employees often dedicate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H808 
February 5, 2020 
When they retire, those Federal em-
ployees receive their hard-earned re-
tirement benefits. Currently, the Fed-
eral Government issues payments to 
more than 2 million retirees and more 
than half a million survivor annuitants 
each year. Annuitants receive an aver-
age of $2,500 a month. 
If a Federal annuitant becomes inca-
pacitated in some way, a representa-
tive payee may be appointed. A rep-
resentative payee is a person who re-
ceives and manages benefits on behalf 
of another person who is not fully ca-
pable of managing their own benefits. 
Certainly, things like mental illness, 
disability, or long-term illness are just 
a few examples of situations where a 
payee may step in and provide that 
counsel. 
Obviously, as we look at this, a rep-
resentative payee has a duty to use fi-
nancial benefits to assist with the care 
and well-being of the intended bene-
ficiary. Surprisingly, though, it is not 
a crime for a representative payee to 
commit financial fraud against an in-
capacitated Federal retiree. However, 
under the Social Security Act, it is a 
crime to do so. 
I have always assumed that this type 
of financial abuse of retired Federal 
employees was also a crime. But right 
now, under Federal law, it is not. 
As the chairwoman from New York 
mentioned, this is a commonsense 
piece of legislation. I would like to 
thank my colleague, Ms. TLAIB, for her 
leadership on this. 
This bill will make it a crime to em-
bezzle Federal retirement benefits as a 
representative payee. If convicted, the 
representative payee could be subject 
to criminal fines and up to 5 years in 
prison. Obviously, this is a protection 
for our Federal workforce. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
particular piece of legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to begin by thanking Congressman 
MEADOWS for partnering with me on 
the bill, as well as our Chairwoman 
MALONEY and her incredibly strong and 
talented staff for their leadership and 
for the continued support of the work 
that we have to do on behalf of our 
residents at home. 
I also want to thank our forever 
chairman, the late Chairman Cum-
mings, who is looking down on us from 
above, for his mentorship and for work-
ing with us on this bill that would help 
some of our most vulnerable retirees. 
We all know that no one deserves to 
be scammed out of their money, but 
that is especially true for our retirees. 
This bill, the Representative Payee 
Fraud Prevention Act, is a bipartisan 
effort to protect those retirees who are 
recipients of Federal benefits. 
Retirees who have been declared 
mentally incompetent or have another 
qualifying disability can have their 
monthly benefits paid on their behalf 
through a representative, frequently 
referred to as the representative payee. 
In recent years, what we have seen in 
our country is there has been a sharp 
increase in the number of representa-
tive payees who have taken advantage 
of their position and committed fraud, 
hurting many of our residents. 
We need to hold them accountable, 
and this bill does that. The bill would 
expand protection to over 2 million 
workers all across the United States. 
In my home State of Michigan, there 
are nearly 40,000 Federal retirees who 
are currently unprotected from this 
crime, impacting their quality of life. 
They are supposed to be living in peace 
during their retirement years. They 
are becoming targets instead, and we 
need to push back together, in a bipar-
tisan way. 
I hear firsthand from our senior resi-
dents about their concerns, from feel-
ing neglected in the assisted living fa-
cilities to unaffordable drug prices, and 
I want to ensure that our older Ameri-
cans have one less worry about finan-
cial predators who will misuse their 
hard-earned money. 
For far too long, this lack of Federal 
protection has left some of our, again, 
most vulnerable civil servants without 
legal recourse when they are taken ad-
vantage of and their retirement funds 
are misused. We must ensure that the 
most impacted communities are pro-
tected on every front. 
That is what this legislation will do. 
It will prevent those who have com-
mitted representative payee fraud from 
serving as representative payees in the 
future and hold them accountable to 
their victims. 
Let’s really ensure that our public 
servants and our civil servants who 
have dedicated their lives to serving 
our country are protected against this 
fraud. 
Again, I want to thank my beloved 
Chairman Cummings for coming to my-
self and my colleague, Congressman 
MEADOWS. When he did, we couldn’t say 
no to him, so we worked together in 
trying to resolve this issue for so many 
folks, again, 2 million Federal employ-
ees across the country who need this 
protection. 
Mr. Speaker, I really do urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I cer-
tainly would rise in support of this leg-
islation. I thank the gentlewoman from 
Michigan for her kind words. Ms. TLAIB 
has been leading on this. 
The gentlewoman is right. Chairman 
Cummings had an infectious way of 
bringing people together, and I rise in 
support of this legislation as a tribute 
to his leadership and to her leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 5214. I thank Elijah Cummings for 
his hard work on this bill, too, and my 
colleagues, 
Mr. 
MEADOWS
and 
Ms. 
TLAIB, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 5214. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
TAXPAYERS RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3830) to

SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days within which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on the measure 
before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman? 
There was no objection. 
b 1500 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Congressmen 
WALBERG and COOPER for their hard 
work on it. 
The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act is 
a bipartisan and commonsense solution 
that would help identify areas of ineffi-
ciency in the Federal Government. The 
bill would create an inventory of Fed-
eral programs that would be published 
on a government website and updated 
regularly. The information in the in-
ventory would also be archived. 
Previous attempts at getting infor-
mation from agencies on Federal pro-
grams have yielded incomplete and 
varied results, since agencies often 
have different ways of defining Federal 
programs. 
This bill aims to provide streamlined 
and uniformed insight into the activi-
ties of programs governmentwide. The 
Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act would 
require agencies to report on the 
spending, authorization, and purpose of 
a Federal program’s activities. Infor-
mation would also be required on any 
awards of financial assistance. Access 
to enhanced information would result 
in greater transparency into duplica-
tive or inefficient programs. 
This bill would also provide a means 
to test a way in which this comprehen-
sive inventory of Federal programs 
would be achieved across the Federal 
Government. It would require the Of-
fice of Management and Budget to re-
port on how existing agency data 
would be used to create the program 
inventory or explain how the data will 
be presented and the results of a pilot 
program. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this good gov-
ernment measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3830, the Taxpayers 
Right-to-Know Act. 
The Federal Government is a com-
plex and diverse organization. As Mem-
bers of Congress, we are responsible for 
ensuring the Federal Government is ef-
ficient and effective. However, we lack 
the tools to understand how the tax-
payer dollars are spent. Oftentimes, we 
lack a detailed list of the programs 
that are there. 
This bipartisan bill will increase 
transparency and make it easier to see 
how the Federal Government uses its 
tax dollars. 
May I edit that last statement just a 
bit? It is not the government’s tax dol-
lars. It is the hardworking American 
people’s tax dollars. So this is a criti-
cally important additional tool. 
In fiscal year 2019, the Federal Gov-
ernment spent nearly $4.4 trillion. Tax-
payers should know where their hard- 
earned money is going. To follow the 
money, we need to know what the gov-
ernment is doing, so a comprehensive 
inventory of Federal programs will 
help us do that. 
In 2010, Congress required the execu-
tive branch to develop a comprehensive 
Federal program inventory. The pro-
gram inventory Congress envisioned 
would have given the public insight 
into the government’s organizational 
structure and provided a comparable 
list of all Federal programs. 
Comparability is key. We need to see 
how these programs match up. To give 
you one example, there were 678 dupli-
cative programs in the Federal Govern-
ment that dealt just with sustainable 
energy. You can argue the merits of 
priority or the lack thereof, but, cer-
tainly, over 600 programs to deal with 
one particular issue across the govern-
ment is something that cannot be effi-
cient. 
However, the Government Account-
ability Office found that the program 
inventory built for the previous admin-
istration in 2013 failed to meet the in-
tent of the law or needs of Congress. 
Implementing guidance allowed far too 
much flexibility for agencies to define 
programs. Each agency used its own 
definition, which prevented programs 
to be compared to one another. So the 
Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act updates 
the law to require a more consistent 
definition of Federal programs across 
all agencies. 
Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good 
bill that goes with the intent of Con-
gress as laid out, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
from North Carolina has no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure we have one other speaker who is 
running in the halls right now, but I 
may let him speak upon a different 
bill. 
Let me just mention Mr. WALBERG’s 
leadership on this, a real shout-out to 
him and his leadership on trying to 
make sure congressional intent was in-
deed addressed. I thank him for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time, and I urge passage 
of H.R. 3830, as amended. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Will the gentle-
woman yield? 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Yes, I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. MEADOWS. I appreciate the gen-
tlewoman’s flexibility, but if you would 
let me reclaim my time and yield to 
the gentleman, who made it in by the 
hair on his chinny chin chin. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HIMES). Without objection, the gen-
tleman from North Carolina reclaims 
his time and yields to the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman and gentlewoman. 
Mr. Speaker, I did shave this morn-
ing, so there wasn’t much hair on the 
chinny chin chin. 
Mr. Speaker, American taxpayers de-
serve to know where, when, why, and 
how government is spending their 
hard-earned dollars. This is why I 
partnered with my colleague from Ten-
nessee, Representative JIM COOPER, to 
introduce H.R. 3830, the Taxpayers 
Right-to-Know Act. This bipartisan 
legislation requires Federal agencies to 
supply an online accounting of their 
program activities in an easily search-
able inventory so that Americans can 
keep tabs on where and how their tax 
dollars are being spent. 
The inventory will account for how 
funds are allocated, the total amount 
appropriated, obligated, and outlaid for 
services and the intended population 
served by each program. It will also 
provide performance reviews for each 
program, including any and all inspec-
tor general or Government Account-
ability Office reports. All of the infor-
mation provided for the inventory will 
be updated regularly to provide for a 
more real-time accounting of Federal 
program dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for support from 
my colleagues for this legislation. I 
think its time has come. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman’s courtesy. I urge 
support for this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 
3830, as amended, and yield back the 
balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H811 
February 5, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3830, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
USPS FAIRNESS ACT 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2382) to 
amend title 5, United States Code, to 
repeal the requirement that the United 
States Postal Service prepay future re-
tirement benefits, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2382 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘USPS Fair-
ness Act’’. 
SEC. 2. REPEAL OF REQUIRED PREPAYMENT OF 
FUTURE POSTAL SERVICE RETIRE-
MENT BENEFITS. 
Subsection (d) of section 8909a of title 5, 
United States Code, is repealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days within which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on the measure be-
fore us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the 
U.S. 
Postal 
Service 
Fairness 
Act, 
which I am a very proud cosponsor, 
would make a small but very impor-
tant change to help address the dire fi-
nancial condition of the Postal Serv-
ice. 
Common law requires the Postal 
Service to prefund the healthcare costs 
of its future retirees decades into the 
future. We are aware of no other enti-
ty, public or private, that faces this 
type of onerous financial burden. This 
mandate has cost the Postal Service 
billions of dollars since it was first im-
posed 14 years ago. The Postal Service 
has not made a payment into this fund 
since 2012. 
This bill won’t solve all the Postal 
Service’s financial problems. Elimi-
nating the mandate will take some 
paper liabilities off the books of the 
Postal Service, but it will do nothing 
to improve its cash position. 
Without major structural reforms, 
the Postal Service will run out of cash 
in about 4 years. At that point, it will 
not be able to pay its own workers, and 
mail delivery would simply cease. 
The Postal Service has taken signifi-
cant steps to control its costs, includ-
ing shrinking its workforce by close to 
300,000 employees over the past 20 
years. Yet, it has incurred net annual 
losses for 13 straight years. 
The Postal Service currently funds 
universal mail service to nearly 159 
million delivery points solely through 
the sale of postage. It is required to ex-
pand its network to deliver mail to ap-
proximately 1 million new addresses 
every year, even as the volume of mail 
continues to decline by a projected 45 
billion mail pieces over the next dec-
ade. 
So while I support this bill, more 
must be done to stabilize the finances 
of this important American institution 
on which so much of our population re-
lies. 
The Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, and Congressman CONNOLLY in 
particular, is working on comprehen-
sive legislation to do just that. We will 
continue to work on comprehensive 
legislation after this bill passes. 
Finally, I thank my good friend, Mr. 
DEFAZIO, for his tireless, passionate ad-
vocacy for this bill. I also thank Mr. 
REED
and Mr. FITZPATRICK, on the 
other side of the aisle, as well as Ms. 
TORRES SMALL, for all of their hard 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this commonsense measure, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and rise in opposition to the bill. No 
one has invested more time than per-
haps Mr. CONNOLLY or myself on postal 
reform. But I think it was Winston 
Churchill who said that no matter how 
beautiful the strategy, we must occa-
sionally look at the results. And the 
results of this bill will do nothing to 
stop the post office from hemorrhaging 
money. 
As we look at this prefunding—and I 
would agree with the gentlewoman— 
part of our solution, part of the bipar-
tisan solution in the previous Congress, 
was to look at this prefunding issue 
and to try to address it. But to do it as 
a standalone bill, Mr. Speaker, is cer-
tainly not what the doctor ordered. Be-
cause even with this, the Postal Serv-
ice continues to lose money each and 
every day. 
I would say that if this was the bomb 
that solved their problem, it would 
have already been solved because they 
haven’t been making the payments. 
What the American people need to 
understand is, they are wanting relief 
from a payment that they are not mak-
ing, and it is going to make zero dif-
ference in terms of the viability of the 
Postal Service. 
Now, we can all agree that there need 
to be major reforms, but this par-
ticular bill, and the way that it is 
being put forth, would actually hurt 
the potential progress we have in ad-
dressing real reforms. With that, I 
sadly rise in opposition to this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO), the author of the legislation. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman. 
Mr. Speaker, in a Christmas Eve bill 
with no legislative consideration, an 
otherwise noncontroversial bill, a pro-
vision was stuck in to say that the 
Postal Service should prefund 75 years 
of health benefits for retirees. 
Now, think about that. That means 
people who have not yet been born, 
who have not yet gone to work for the 
Postal Service for a career and then 
might retire, we are paying for their 
healthcare now. Name one other entity 
in the United States of America, cor-
porate or government, that does any-
thing like this. It is nuts. And it is a 
piggybank. 
The money isn’t being put into a 
trust fund to pay for their health insur-
ance. It is going into the maw of the 
Treasury. Who knows where it goes. It 
maybe makes the debt look a little 
smaller. That was why President Bush 
pushed for it. But it is accounting for 
the majority of the losses at the Postal 
Service. 
b 1515 
So, yes, this will help relieve pres-
sure on the Postal Service and on 
rates. And I think there are a lot of 
Americans who would like not to see 
the postal rates keep going up. 
Now, there are 300 bipartisan cospon-
sors. There aren’t too many things 
around here these days like that be-
cause I think many people realize this 
doesn’t make much sense. 
And the Postal Service is a critical 
service. It is not a government-run 
business to make a profit. It is the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
Star routes don’t make money. If you 
represent a rural area, you can’t make 
money out there. FedEx and UPS won’t 
go out there. They get the Postal Serv-
ice to take the stuff out there. If we 
dismantle the Postal Service, then ev-
erybody in rural America is out of 
luck. 
And there are a whole heck of a lot of 
other people who are dependent upon 
this: newspapers, rural newspapers, 
small businesses. 
Many years ago, when I first started 
working on this, I posted something on 
the website: Tell me if you need the 
Postal Service. 
People from all the small towns all 
around my very large district said: I 
sell on eBay. That is how I make a liv-
ing out here in Powers, Oregon, or in

other little places around my district. I 
couldn’t afford UPS or FedEx. I get the 
one package price. 
So this is critical. 
And, every day, hundreds of thou-
sands of our veterans get their drugs 
delivered by the United States Postal 
Service, many of them in rural areas, 
hard to serve, and, sure as heck, hard 
for them to get to the VA hospital or 
get into town. 
So we need to stop burdening the 
Postal Service with something that 
makes no sense. Are there other things 
that need to be reformed? Yes. 
But once we take this $5 billion a 
year burden off them—they have al-
ready put $50 billion into a theoretical 
account to pay for healthcare for fu-
ture postal employees who haven’t 
been born yet, who might work there, 
might retire some day, and might get 
health benefits. That is more than 
enough. 
And, by the way, this doesn’t score in 
any way. So that is why we have 300 bi-
partisan sponsors. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues at 
long last to undo this stupidity. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I love 
the passion. The only problem is it is 
misplaced. 
I can tell you that, if this bill would 
truly solve the business model that the 
Postal Service has, I would rise and 
support it. If this is all we are going to 
do, hallelujah. Let’s do it and get it 
done. But the gentleman is wrong. This 
does not solve the problem. 
You can give them a pass on $5 bil-
lion a year, and they are still losing 
money. That is the whole issue. That is 
the crux of the issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
North Carolina. I agree with my col-
league from North Carolina, let us not 
confuse what we are talking about here 
today. 
I very much appreciate the postal 
employees who deliver the mail to my 
house. When I go into a post office and 
need to mail things, they are wonderful 
people and give great service. That is 
not the issue here. The issue is: Are we 
going to fund, properly, the retirement 
and healthcare services? 
I am not necessarily opposed to ad-
dressing the United States Postal Serv-
ice’s requirement to prefund its retiree 
health benefits. Doing so, though, in 
this manner would be disastrous for 
the American taxpayer. This bill’s 
elimination of the prefunding require-
ment without instituting any reforms 
to tackle its fiscal status, as my col-
league has said, would simply mean 
that Congress continues to play the 
game of kicking the can down the road. 
The fact is that there is already a 
long history of public retirement ac-
counts that have either dramatically 
cut retiree benefits or had to rely on a 
taxpayer bailout as a result of not fully 
prefunding their plans. 
This is a snowball going down the 
hill that is going to pick up steam. 
The only way to pay off the unfunded 
liabilities created by the U.S. post of-
fice retiree health benefits—without 
enacting cost-saving reform to the U.S. 
Postal Service, which this bill does 
not—would be a taxpayer bailout. 
That is why President Trump’s Task 
Force on the United States Postal Sys-
tem issued formal opposition to remov-
ing the prefunding requirement. To 
quote the task force: ‘‘The task force 
does not believe that this general pol-
icy should change or that the liability 
for USPS retiree health benefits should 
be shifted to the taxpayers.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I agree, to be clear, this 
bill moves taxpayers one step closer to 
a bailout of the USPS, and we should 
oppose this change on the taxpayers’ 
behalf. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), 
the 
distinguished 
sub-
committee chairman. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend and distin-
guished chair of the Oversight and Re-
form Committee. 
Boy, what you just heard from my 
friend from North Carolina couldn’t be 
further from the truth. This is not a 
taxpayer bailout. Quite the opposite. It 
is exactly what Mr. DEFAZIO, my friend 
from Oregon, described. 
This is righting a wrong Congress 
created in the dead of night in a lame-
duck session in 2006 in putting a burden 
on the Postal Service no other entity 
on the planet is required to meet. And 
we have an obligation, having created 
that problem, to fix it. That is what we 
are trying to do with this bill. 
It is not a panacea. That is why we 
are working on bipartisan legislation 
to have a comprehensive reform bill 
that will address a significant amount 
of time for the Postal Service to build 
a new business model. 
My friend, my other friend from 
North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS)—I was 
referring to the other North Caro-
linian—has been working diligently 
with us on a bipartisan basis for many 
years to try to find just the right fix. I 
am looking forward to that bipartisan 
solution. 
But that doesn’t mean we stop every-
thing and fix nothing. This may not re-
turn the Postal Service to solvency, 
but it takes a liability off the books 
that is real, that hurts them, that 
makes it harder for them to recover 
and to figure out how to adjust to 
changes in technology and the market-
place, and that is why I support this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to its 
passage on a bipartisan basis, and I 
hope that we will fold this bill, the con-
cept of this bill, into a larger, more 
comprehensive bill. As the distin-
guished chairwoman said, we need a 
comprehensive approach to the Postal 
Service after we address and fix this 
problem that Congress created. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Virginia, and I 
want to highlight his work on this par-
ticular issue, and I agree with him that 
this, ultimately, will be part of what 
has to be dovetailed into anything we 
do to fix the Postal Service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS) in the spirit of letting my col-
leagues express their full-throated sup-
port of this bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my 
good friend, Mr. MEADOWS. We have 
been working on issues like this relat-
ing to the long-term solvency of our 
Postal Service for many years, and I 
look forward to standing on this floor 
with him in the near future when we 
come up with a good, comprehensive 
solution that addresses issues like this. 
I thank him for his leadership and his 
support of the Postal Service and the 
great postal workers who make up one 
of the greatest services that we have in 
our country. 
Unfortunately, the Postal Service 
today is forced to play by a different 
set of rules, and those are unfair. This 
bill corrects this by repealing the 2006 
mandate 
that 
the 
Postal 
Service 
prefund future retiree health benefits. 
In 2006, the Postal Accountability 
and Enhancement Act mandated that 
the Postal Service prefund retiree 
health benefits decades in advance, 
something no other public or private 
enterprise is forced to do. Over the 
years, this mandate has caused severe 
cuts and damaged the Postal Service’s 
ability to invest in even new delivery 
vehicles. 
I have always been a steadfast sup-
porter of the Postal Service and its 
workers. In fact, after speaking to 
many of the postal unions in my dis-
trict, like the Letter Carriers and the 
Rural Letter Carriers’, I proudly co-
sponsored this piece of legislation. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on this issue and other im-
portant pieces of legislature that im-
pact our postal unions, such as oppos-
ing the privatization of the Postal 
Service and protecting the 6-day deliv-
ery, door-to-door service, and our rural 
post offices. 
Mr. Speaker, we have to work to-
gether. We need to make sure that our 
Postal Service remains viable. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and I look for-
ward to working with everyone in this 
institution in the future. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments, and I 
would also join him. We have got a 
number of great unions that I have had 
the privilege of getting to know over 
this time as we looked at comprehen-
sive reform, and his acknowledging 
them and his willingness to look at 
something that actually solves the 
problem is to be applauded. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to

H813 
February 5, 2020 
the gentlewoman from the great State 
of Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2382. This leg-
islation is a positive first step—and I 
emphasize first step—to address a sig-
nificantly more complex issue at hand: 
the financial solvency crisis plaguing 
the United States Postal Service. 
After a 30-year career in the Postal 
Service—and I think I am the only 
member of Congress who is actually a 
letter carrier—I come to Congress with 
the intention of helping USPS return 
to a strong financial standing through 
legislative reform. 
While decreased mail volume plays a 
role, there are other actions Congress 
must take to provide the Postal Serv-
ice with the flexibility needed to re-
verse and mend the downward financial 
trend. 
For the last few years, I have worked 
with several colleagues on the Over-
sight Committee, including Represent-
atives CONNOLLY, LYNCH, MEADOWS, and 
the late, amazing Chairman Elijah 
Cummings, to introduce comprehensive 
postal reform. 
As the House stands poised to pass 
H.R. 2382, I look forward to continuing 
to work with my colleagues on the 
committee to introduce a comprehen-
sive postal reform package that will 
provide the Postal Service with the re-
form needed to help lessen the finan-
cial battle. 
I want to thank Chairwoman MALO-
NEY for her leadership on this issue, 
and I look forward to the continued 
work to build the Postal Service Fair-
ness Act. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to strongly support H.R. 
2382, the USPS Fairness Act. I have 
led, with my colleagues, this important 
legislation 
that 
ends 
the 
unfair 
prefunding mandate for the Postal 
Service and also solves the most press-
ing financing problem facing our letter 
carriers and post offices across the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, the USPS is the only 
Government entity—the only one— 
which is mandated to prefund its retir-
ees’ health benefits. 100 percent of the 
Postal Service’s financial losses over 
the past 6 years—100 percent—are di-
rectly due and linked to this require-
ment. 
This is an outdated policy which has 
forced the Postal Service into a hor-
rible financial position, which has pre-
vented it from investing in resources 
that would benefit all of our commu-
nities, no matter where we live. 
Moreover, Mr. Speaker, this legisla-
tion has widespread support from the 
National Association of Letter Car-
riers, the American Postal Workers 
Union, and the National Postal Mail 
Handlers Union. 
This 
bipartisan 
bill 
will 
restore 
USPS’ financial health by shoring up 
that funding and ensuring that it has 
the resources to improve the Postal 
Service for all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this legislation. This is the pri-
ority for our postal workers, in addi-
tion to 6-day delivery as well as door- 
to-door service. We have to get all 
three done for our postal workers, our 
letter carriers, and our post offices 
that serve all of our communities. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY). 
b 1530 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding to 
me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness 
Act. 
The United States Postal Service is 
an essential part of American life. It 
was established more than 231 years 
ago and has delivered on its promise 
every one of those years. 
Benjamin Franklin was the first 
Postmaster General in the United 
States. And they have—while I under-
stand it is not an official slogan, I 
think we have all heard this: ‘‘Neither 
snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of 
night stays these couriers from the 
swift completion of their appointed 
mission.’’ 
So we know that with more than 100 
billion pieces of mail delivered each 
year, and a 90 percent approval rating, 
that we must do all that we can to sup-
port them. 
Today, Members of Congress are tak-
ing the important step to help support 
over seven million U.S. postal workers 
across the country. 
Since 2006, U.S. postal employees 
have been forced to prefund retiree 
health benefits 75 years in advance, 
making them the only government 
agency that must prefund future em-
ployees that have not been born yet. 
This ridiculous law has caused the 
U.S. Postal Service to lose billions of 
dollars each year and has caused postal 
employees’ uncertainty in their work. 
This cannot continue. 
So I agree with over 300 of my col-
leagues that we must reverse this ab-
surd policy. The United States Postal 
Service Fairness Act will repeal the 
prefunding that is mandated and allow 
the United States Postal Service to re-
turn to its pay-as-you-go system as 
used before. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate all the points that my 
friends opposite are making. In fact, I 
have made some of the very same 
points when we talk about reform bills. 
The problem is, all the wonderful 
things that they are talking about in 
this bill do not exist. They are not 
making the payments. They haven’t 
made a payment since 2010. 
So how does giving relief from a pay-
ment you are not making suddenly 
make the Postal Service viable? It 
doesn’t. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), 
who will give you an opposing view 
from our side. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
The United States Postal Service has 
a history as old as our Nation. Our Na-
tion’s Founders believed that it was so 
important that they put it in the Con-
stitution and many people back home 
don’t realize that. Of course, you know, 
that is the most quoted, least read doc-
ument around here. 
The rural communities in southern 
Illinois and across our country depend 
on the Postal Service. It is often the 
only means for small businesses to en-
gage in commerce, and for rural resi-
dents to receive packages. 
The Postal Service is facing many 
challenges, but it is taking several im-
portant steps to provide new services 
mandated by the modern economy. Un-
fortunately, it can’t accomplish these 
reforms with one hand tied behind its 
back. 
The Postal Service is the only entity 
with this requirement. I doubt that any 
Federal agency would be able to meet 
its goals and obligations to citizens 
and taxpayers if they were likewise re-
quired to prefund their health benefits. 
The underlying legislation helps cor-
rect this. It does not impose additional 
costs on taxpayers, and it will help en-
sure the Postal Service can continue to 
serve our communities as it has since 
our Nation’s founding. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s courtesy 
in permitting me to speak on this bill. 
I feel very strongly about this. 
The United States Postal Service 
moves almost half the world’s mail. It 
is the most popular Federal agency, 
highest ratings. And, in fact, if you 
look at the interaction that we have 
with postal workers, in my community 
and elsewhere, they are deeply beloved. 
I had a father-in-law who was a post-
al worker. In the holiday season he was 
burdened down with cookies and fruit-
cake and brandy that was given to him 
by the people on his route. 
What we have seen, unfortunately, 
since 2006, is part of an assault on the 
finest Postal Service in the world. You 
have heard it said before on the floor; 
this is the only—not just the only Fed-
eral agency, I don’t think there is any 
entity in the United States that is re-
quired to prefund health benefits for 
people who haven’t yet been born but 
might be employed 20, 30, 40 years from 
now. This is part of an effort on behalf 
of some who literally have a jihad 
against the U.S. Postal Service. 
I had a session in my community 2 
weeks ago where we heard about a bi-
zarre experiment on casing mail, tak-
ing that away from the letter carriers,

and it has resulted in a serious disrup-
tion in our community by people who 
are disconnected from the actual serv-
ice that is given. 
Postal jobs are the best jobs in many 
rural and small American towns. And 
there are some who feel, well, they are 
paid too much. They have too generous 
benefits or retirement. That is hog-
wash. 
They provide that foundation in 
much of rural and small-town America; 
a beloved service, a service that pro-
vides an essential connection for vir-
tually the entire country, 6 days a 
week, and, in fact, if we get our act to-
gether, there is more benefit that can 
be provided. 
Get rid of this stupid prefunding and 
give them more flexibility about the 
services they can provide. Why aren’t 
we using the U.S. Postal Service to 
help us with the census? These people 
know who lives in the neighborhood. 
Why are we hiring temporary employ-
ees? 
Why can’t we use the Postal Service 
to deal with problems in the future, if 
we have an outbreak of an anthrax-sort 
of activity in terms of lethal threats. 
Use the Postal Service. Give them the 
flexibility to provide more service. Re-
spect the men and women who work 
there, and stop this stupid effort to un-
dercut the finest Postal Service in the 
world. 
I appreciate the committee bringing 
this legislation forward. I appreciate 
the bipartisan support, and maybe it is 
time we get our act straight to help 
them fulfill their full potential. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I do need to correct a few things that 
the gentleman from Oregon just ad-
dressed. This is not—support or being 
against this bill is not an attack on the 
Postal Service. 
I mean, there is no one who has in-
vested more time—I can promise you, 
when I came to Congress, fixing the 
Postal Service was not on my bucket 
list. And as we have invested time, and 
I see my good friend, Mr. LYNCH, my 
good friend, Mr. CONNOLLY, let me just 
tell you, we have invested days, if not 
weeks and months, to try to address 
this. 
But the gentleman from Oregon is 
just not correct. This particular bill, 
while it may be part of a solution, 
gives them no flexibility. It gives them 
no additional cash flow. They are still 
going to go out of business if we do not 
come 
together 
and 
get 
something 
worked out for all of us to make sure 
that, not only do we have a postal sys-
tem that works, but one that is not a 
mere shadow of its former self. 
I will say this: I want to make sure 
that my postal unions and all of those 
that are watching very intently, you 
have made an impact on this Member 
from North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, they have let me know 
exactly how important this is. And yet, 
at the same time, I am afraid I cannot 
support this bill because it does not do 
what we need it to do, and that is, ad-
dress the problem today. This just 
kicks the can down the road. And un-
fortunately, it doesn’t even kick it 
down the road long enough to allow the 
postal workers to depend on the very 
system that employs them. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. LYNCH), my good friend and col-
league. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her kindness and 
the courtesy afforded to me. 
I do want to say that, like some 
other Members in this Chamber, I 
think at one count, I had 17 of my rel-
atives, including my mom, several of 
her sisters, two of my sisters, my 
brother-in-law, all my cousins, who 
worked for the United States Postal 
Service, sort of the family business. 
And I do thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina. We spent, you know, 
days, if not weeks, if not months, argu-
ing over the contours of this legisla-
tion. 
I want to thank Mr. DEFAZIO. And I 
rise in strong support of his bill. 
I also thank my colleague from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) for his work on 
this as well. And our dear colleague, 
Elijah Cummings, who worked on this, 
put his heart and soul into finding a so-
lution. 
Look, I do agree with the gentleman 
from North Carolina’s comments, that 
this does not solve everything. It does 
not. But it is an important element of 
a bill that we, Republicans and Demo-
crats, passed out of committee unani-
mously, without any dissent in a pre-
vious session. So it is a very important 
element of what we are trying to do. 
There is no dispute with the gen-
tleman from Oregon’s earlier remarks 
that we don’t ask any other group 
within government to fund their re-
tiree health benefits this way. This was 
an idea that, I think, came out of a 
time when, before email and before the 
use of social media, the volume of mail 
within the Postal Service being deliv-
ered every single day, could sustain the 
current configuration of retiree health 
benefits. 
Those days are long gone, and we 
have to figure out a way that will keep 
the Postal Service viable going for-
ward. 
This does not solve everything but, 
boy, I will tell you, this solves a lot. It 
buys us time to craft those other pieces 
that need to come together as well. 
So I would argue that we should not 
allow the perfect to be the enemy of 
the good. This is a solid change here. 
This is something that I think people 
need to understand that what we are 
requiring of the Postal Service right 
now is that, when a new employee 
comes into the Postal Service, we have 
to set aside the money, on day one, for 
their eventual retirement; while every 
other collective bargaining agreement 
and pension system periodically reas-
sesses what the demands are as that 
person gets closer to retirement. That 
is the critical time to know whether or 
not there are sufficient resources and a 
guarantee that certain resources are 
there for that person to enjoy the re-
tirement and the benefits and the 
health benefits that they have earned. 
So I just ask my colleagues to vote in 
support of this bill. I support Mr. 
DEFAZIO’s bill wholeheartedly, and I 
thank the Speaker for his courtesy. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I know that everybody is tuned in in 
their offices, paying attention to this 
unbelievable debate, and so for all of 
you that are tuned in on C–SPAN, and 
as we debate this, I think it is impor-
tant that I share a couple of sentences 
from the U.S. Postal Service. So it is 
not from my colleagues opposite. It is 
not from my point of view; but this is 
what they have to say about this bill: 
‘‘It would neither reduce the under-
lying RHB liability nor improve our 
cash flow or our long-term financial 
position. It would not impact the li-
quidity crisis that we have.’’ 
These are not my words, Mr. Speak-
er. These are the words of those that 
are closest to the financial responsi-
bility, the Postal Service themselves. 
So if the gentlewoman is prepared to 
close, I will just recommend to my col-
leagues a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are further reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair, not to a 
perceived viewing audience. 
b 1545 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 2382, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 2382, the U.S.P.S. Fairness 
Act, introduced by my colleague, Representa-
tive PETER DEFAZIO of Oregon. 
I’d like to commend Mr. DEFAZIO and the 
other bipartisan sponsors of this bill—Mr. 
REED of New York, Ms. TORRES-SMALL of New 
Mexico, and Mr. FITZPATRICK
of Pennsyl-
vania—for their leadership in addressing the 
serious fiscal challenges facing the United 
States Postal Service. I’d also like to recog-
nize the relentless and united effort on the 
part of our postal employee unions, manage-
ment associations, and other stakeholders to 
advance this commonsense legislation. 
With the support of over 300 bipartisan co-
sponsors, the U.S.P.S. Fairness Act would re-
peal a misguided provision in current law re-
quiring the postal service to fully fund its 
health care costs for future postal retirees dec-
ades before it is necessary—that’s an annual 
average cost of over $5.5 billion dollars. This 
is a requirement that federal law does not im-
pose on any other government agency—espe-
cially one that receives zero tax dollars and in-
stead relies on the revenue generated by its 
own stamps, products, and services to fund its 
operations. It is no surprise that the postal 
service has not been able to make these exor-
bitant annual payments since 2011.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H815 
February 5, 2020 
The elimination of the so-called ‘‘pre-funding 
mandate’’ is a sensible first step towards im-
proving the financial viability of the postal 
service. This bipartisan bill should also guide 
our approach to developing comprehensive 
postal reform legislation going forward. In 
stark contrast to the more partisan and sweep-
ing reform proposals that have been pre-
sented to our committee in recent years, H.R. 
2382 will immediately place the postal service 
on more sound financial footing while pre-
serving its core public service mission to ‘‘pro-
vide postal services to bind the nation together 
through the correspondence of the people.’’ 
And contrary to the degradation of postal 
delivery services, or the wholesale privatiza-
tion of the postal service itself, H.R. 2382 is 
the end product of bipartisan cooperation and 
the subject of broad consensus among our di-
verse postal stakeholders. As we develop ad-
ditional postal reform legislation, it is impera-
tive that we continue to identify fundamental 
and practical areas of agreement. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2382. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

FEDERAL RISK AND AUTHORIZA-

MANAGEMENT 
PROGRAM 
AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2019 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H818 
February 5, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I thank my colleagues and friends, 
Representatives CONNOLLY and MEAD-
OWS, for their bipartisan work on this 
very important measure. 
The Federal Risk and Authorization 
Management Program Authorization 
Act would codify and improve the ex-
isting FedRAMP program in the Gen-
eral Services Administration. 
First established in 2011, FedRAMP is 
an important program that certifies 
cloud service providers that wish to 
offer services to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
The 
FedRAMP 
certification 
process outlined in this bill is com-
prehensive and facilitates easier agen-
cy adoption, promotes agency reuse, 
and encourages savings. 
The FedRAMP process uses a risk- 
based approach to ensure the reli-
ability of any cloud platform that 
hosts unclassified government data. A 
significant provision of this bill is the 
Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Com-
mittee. 
This 
committee 
would 
be 
tasked with key responsibilities, in-
cluding providing technical expertise 
on cloud products and services and 
identifying ways to reduce costs associ-
ated with FedRAMP certification. 
The Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget would be required to 
issue 
regulations 
pertaining 
to 
FedRAMP and would ensure that agen-
cies are not using cloud service pro-
viders without authorization. 
This bill supports a critical effort to 
keep our Nation’s information secure 
in cloud environments. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 3941, the 
FedRAMP Authorization Act. 
Cybersecurity and IT modernization 
are both vital issues that we need to 
make sure run properly. The gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) 
has been very proactive on this front. 
The Federal Risk and Authorization 
Management Program, or FedRAMP, 
as it is commonly referred to, would 
allow Federal programs to focus on cy-
bersecurity for cloud services, and it 
provides a process for agencies to fol-
low when procuring cloud systems to 
ensure that those systems meet strict 
cybersecurity controls. 
The gentlewoman, the chairman of 
the 
full 
committee, 
has 
certainly 
talked on a number of issues as it re-
lates to this bill, but since there is no 
opposition that I am aware of, I will 
just 
submit 
my 
remarks 
for 
the 
RECORD. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3941, 
the FedRAMP Authorization Act. 
Cyber security and IT modernization are 
both vital issues to ensure this government 
runs efficiently and effectively. 
The Federal Risk and Authorization Man-
agement Program, or FedRAMP, is the main 
federal program focused on cyber security for 
cloud services. 
It provides a process for agencies to follow 
when procuring cloud systems to ensure the 
systems meet strict cyber security controls. 
Recent federal policies make the focus on 
securing cloud services especially important. 
With the Cloud First initiative in 2011 and 
the Cloud Smart initiative from last year, the 
government has focused on implementation of 
cloud technologies. 
The federal government has been plagued 
by reoccurring problems in information tech-
nology, such as low asset utilization, duplica-
tive systems, and fragmented resources. 
Shifting to the cloud provides for improved 
asset utilization, increased innovation, and a 
more responsive tech environment. 
These improved efficiencies lead to a signifi-
cant cost savings. 
In fiscal year 2018, the government spent 
roughly six and a half billion dollars on cloud 
computing, with eighty four percent coming 
from FedRAMP authorized providers. 
Efficiencies from FedRAMP saved agencies 
over two hundred fifty million dollars. 
Codifying the program is an important step 
to encouraging agencies to take advantage of 
this program and all the benefits it offers. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), 
chair of the subcommittee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I salute my partner and friend on our 
subcommittee, 
Mr. 
MEADOWS. 
He 
chaired the subcommittee in the pre-
vious Congress, and I was his ranking 
member. We have reversed roles, but 
our partnership continues, especially 
in trying to modernize the Federal 
Government and bringing it into the 
21st century in terms of information 
technology. We know that when we 
don’t make those investments, bad 
things can happen. We just saw that 
the other night in the Iowa caucus. 
H.R. 3941 codifies the Federal Risk 
and Authorization Management Pro-
gram, known as FedRAMP, established 
in 2011 to provide a cost-effective, risk- 
based approach for the adoption and 
use of cloud computing technologies 
within the Federal Government. 
FedRAMP standardizes security re-
quirements for the authorization and 
ongoing cybersecurity assessments of 
cloud services for information systems 
across the Federal Government. In 
short, FedRAMP seeks to reduce the 
redundancies of Federal cloud migra-
tion and to help agencies quickly adopt 
cloud technologies. 
I 
am 
also 
happy 
to 
say 
that 
FedRAMP has the approval of this ad-
ministration. Last June, the Trump ad-
ministration issued its Federal cloud 
computing 
strategy 
called 
Cloud 
Smart, which reaffirmed its support for 
FedRAMP. The Cloud Smart strategy 
acknowledged 
the 
importance 
of 
FedRAMP in helping agencies mod-
ernize their information technology 
systems. 
Cloud Smart also highlighted im-
provements the program has imple-
mented over the past few years that 
have resulted in a drastically reduced 
timeframe for providing a provisional 
authorization to operate a cloud serv-
ice provider. 
However, the administration also 
noted that there is still lack of reci-
procity across agencies in taking ad-
vantage of FedRAMP-authorized prod-
ucts. Without that reciprocity, agen-
cies end up duplicating the assessment 
process of cloud service offerings, lead-
ing to time delays and inefficiencies 
for both the Federal Government and 
the providers. 
In July, the Subcommittee on Gov-
ernment Operations held a hearing to 
look at what the GSA has done right in 
administering the program and the 
ways in which FedRAMP can and 
should be improved. The message both 
from agency and industry witnesses 
was clear. FedRAMP is an important 
program that, if carried out effectively 
and efficiently, saves money for both 
agencies and businesses hoping to pro-
vide those services. 
The FedRAMP Authorization Act 
codifies the program and addresses 
many of the concerns raised in July by 
both the administration and private- 
sector witnesses. 
First, the bill reduces duplication of 
security assessments and other obsta-
cles to agency adoption of cloud prod-
ucts by establishing—and this is really 
important—a presumption of adequacy 
for cloud technologies that have al-
ready received FedRAMP certification. 
Going to 33 different windows with 33 
separate processes costs way too much 
money, takes way too much time, and, 
frankly, is unnecessary. 
The presumption of adequacy means 
that the cloud service offering has met 
baseline security standards already es-
tablished by the program and should be 
considered approved for use across the 
Federal 
Government, 
except 
where 
very specialized services would be re-
quired. 
The bill also facilitates agency reuse 
of cloud technologies that have already 
received an authorization to operate by 
requiring agencies to check a central-
ized and secure repository and, to the 
extent practicable, reuse any existing 
security assessment before conducting 
an independent one of their own. 
The desire to automate aspects of 
FedRAMP assessment processes was 
another key finding of the subcommit-
tee’s hearing. This bill requires the 
GSA work toward automating their 
processes, which will lead to more 
standard security assessments and con-
tinuous monitoring of cloud offerings 
to increase the efficiency for both pro-
viders and agencies. 
The bill also establishes, as the dis-
tinguished chairwoman indicated, a 
Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Com-
mittee to ensure a dialogue among

GSA, agency cybersecurity and pro-
curement officials, and industry in 
order to have effective and ongoing co-
ordination in acquisition and adoption 
of cloud products by the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Finally, the bill authorizes the pro-
gram at $20 million at an annual level, 
providing sufficient resources to in-
crease the number of secure cloud tech-
nologies available for agency adoption. 
We have worked with OMB, GSA, in-
dustry stakeholders, and our minority 
counterparts to ensure that this bill 
makes needed improvements in the 
FedRAMP program and gives the pro-
gram the flexibility to grow and adopt 
to 
future 
changes 
in 
cloud 
tech-
nologies. I believe it is consistent with 
the administration’s goals, and I urge 
adoption of the bill. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship on this. I will say that I have had 
a number of conversations in recent 
weeks with stakeholders who have of-
fered some suggestions on what we 
could do, so I look forward to working 
with the gentleman opposite on how we 
can address this critical issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge support 
and adoption of this measure, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

I urge passage of H.R. 3941, as amend-

the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House

H.R. 3941, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days within which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure 
before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Improper payments include overpay-
ments, underpayments, payments to 
the incorrect recipient, and those that 
lack proper documentation. They are a 
longstanding and significant problem 
in the Federal Government. In fiscal 
year 2018 alone, they totaled more than 
$151 billion. 
Congress has passed a number of laws 
over the past two decades to try and 
address this problem, but the problem, 
unfortunately, persists. 
S. 375, the Payment Integrity Infor-
mation Act, would consolidate the ex-
isting and proper payment laws in one 
place in the U.S. Code and make sev-
eral changes to help identify and re-
duce improper payments. It would re-
quire agencies to develop plans to pre-
vent improper payments and also to 
identify programs with the highest 
risk. 
It would also require the Office of 
Management and Budget and inspec-
tors general to offer guidance on how 
to improve annual reporting on im-
proper payments. 
Finally, the bill will create a work-
ing group of Federal agencies and non- 
Federal partners to develop strategies 
for addressing the key causes of im-
proper payments, such as fraud and eli-
gibility determination in State-man-
aged Federal benefits programs. 
I thank Senators TOM CARPER, RON 
JOHNSON, 
GARY
PETERS, 
and 
MIKE 
BRAUN for their good work on this com-
monsense measure. I commend Senator 
CARPER for his longstanding dedication 
to reducing improper payments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important measure to re-
duce waste and fraud in Federal pro-
grams, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of S. 375, the Payment In-
tegrity Information Act of 2019. I know 
that I am not alone in addressing the 
Speaker on the will of the House, but 
there are very few times that we see a 
whole lot of good that comes out of the 
other Chamber in the Capitol. This is 
one of the rare moments. 
b 1600 
So as I see this, I would actually en-
courage support of it. 
According to the GAO, since 2003, we 
have had $1.5 trillion—that is trillion 
with a T—in improper payments. In fis-
cal year 2018 alone, Federal agencies 
estimated that there was $151 billion in 
improper payments. 
The Speaker probably knows that of-
tentimes we have had, in Oversight 
Committee, annual reports on im-
proper payments, and consistently we 
are talking about hundreds of billions 
of dollars that are sent to not only the 
wrong place, but in terms that are not 
even accounted for. And after you get 
hundreds of billions year after year, 
eventually that adds up to real money. 
It is time that we address it. 
This is a commonsense piece of legis-
lation that brings everything together 
so that we can start, hopefully, ad-
dressing the sad state of where we are 
in addressing improper payments. The 
American taxpayers demand it, the 
American taxpayers deserve it, and, ul-
timately, we have a responsibility to 
address it. So I rise in support of this. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. 
CRAIG), the House sponsor for this bill. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairwoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 375, the Payment Integrity Infor-
mation Act. I was proud to introduce 
H.R. 5389, the House companion to this 
bill, earlier this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congress-
man, Mr. MEADOWS, as well as Rep-
resentatives CHERI BUSTOS and GREG 
GIANFORTE for their work on this bill. 
My constituents sent me here to Con-
gress to represent some of the hardest 
working, creative, and entrepreneurial 
folks in our country. Every day, I work 
to protect the hard-earned dollars of 
these families, and I remain committed 
to ensuring that the Federal Govern-
ment is a good steward of their tax dol-
lars. 
In fiscal year 2018 alone, the Govern-
ment Accountability Office estimated 
that improper payments throughout 
the Federal Government totaled $151 
billion. Since 2003, when agencies were 
first directed to begin reporting im-
proper payments, cumulative improper 
payments estimated across government 
have totaled $1.4 trillion. 
These improper payments can be 
overpayments, 
underpayments, 
pay-
ments made to ineligible parties, or 
payments that were not properly docu-
mented. Frankly, it is outrageous. 
Whether it is overpaying a defense 
contractor or underpaying a senior on 
their Social Security benefits, the Fed-
eral Government has an obligation to 
put commonsense policies in place to 
end these improper payments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan and 
commonsense bill to tackle Federal 
waste, fraud, and abuse so that we can 
make room to fund the priorities that 
Minnesota 
families 
care 
so 
much 
about, like special education and ad-
dressing our crumbling infrastructure. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, again, 
this bill actually takes five different 
laws that have really not been codified 
in an appropriate manner, brings them 
together under one umbrella, and al-
lows us to address this in a meaningful 
way, a commonsense bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues op-
posite to thank them for their support. 
I rise in support of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 
375, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
375. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION

York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend 
the rules and pass the bill (S. 394) to

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Sen-

hard work on this issue. 
Many of the provisions in the bill be-
fore us today were introduced in the 
House by our late chairman, Elijah 
Cummings, in the Transition Team 
Ethics Improvement Act. 
Most importantly, the bill would 
strengthen the ethics requirements for 
transition team members.

fice issued a report in 2017 about Presi-
dent Trump’s Presidential transition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H827 
February 5, 2020 
GAO reported that the Trump transi-
tion team required team members to 
sign an ethics code of conduct but 
failed to designate a transition team 
member responsible for enforcing it. 
Ethics plans are important for Presi-
dential transitions because Presidents- 
elect often hire transition team mem-
bers who work in the private sector, 
but unlike Federal employees, private- 
sector employees are not subject to 
Federal ethics laws. 
This bill would require eligible Presi-
dential candidates to agree to enforce 
ethics plans during the transition pe-
riod. The bill includes core elements of 
what those ethics plans should include, 
such as a description of how the transi-
tion team will address participation by 
lobbyists and individuals working for 
foreign governments. 
The bill would also require that tran-
sition teams make the ethics plans 
they adopt publicly available. It also 
includes provisions to ensure that non-
public information remains confiden-
tial and is not used in any way for per-
sonal gain. 
The bill would clarify the responsi-
bility of the General Services Adminis-
tration during a transition by requir-
ing a memorandum of understanding 
between the agency and the Presi-
dential transition team. Finally, the 
bill would allow GSA to provide transi-
tion services for up to 60 days after an 
inauguration. 
These provisions would help ensure 
smoother transitions than we have had 
in the past. 
I am very glad this is a bipartisan 
bill. The Senate approved this bill 
without any opposition. 
The peaceful transition of power 
from one party to another is a corner-
stone of our democratic system. We 
must do all we can to ensure the integ-
rity of that process. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this important 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 394, the Presi-
dential Transition Enhancement Act of 
2019. 
First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank Chairman JOHNSON for taking a 
serious look at the needed ethics re-
form. The Senate has developed this 
legislative package in a bipartisan 
manner, something that we would be 
well served in this House to do. 
At the beginning of Congress, I think 
the 
Democrats 
introduced 
H.R. 
1, 
which was a grab bag of unrelated 
Democrat messaging bills. One section 
of H.R. 1 was really directed at the 
President of the United States and his 
administration without really address-
ing serious ethics reforms. 
S. 394, on the other hand, is an honest 
ethics reform package. The bipartisan 
support in the Senate shows that ethics 
reform does not need to be a partisan 
exercise. 
I would suggest Senator JOHNSON’s 
bill addresses a number of ambiguities 
about how agencies work with Presi-
dential transition teams that were 
identified by the Trump transition 
team. For example, agencies and the 
Presidential transition team should 
come to an agreement about the use 
and 
disclosure 
of 
transition 
team 
records. 
The bill also establishes a require-
ment for a transition team’s ethics 
plan. The plan would include consider-
ation of how conflicts of interest would 
be addressed by members of the transi-
tion team and the President-elect. 
I hope that we can use this for our fu-
ture benefit as we work together in a 
bipartisan manner to make sure that 
ethics are addressed and stop politi-
cizing ethics reforms. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill, S. 394, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by

designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 12711

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3976 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. ARETHA FRANKLIN POST OFFICE 
BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 12711 
East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, 
shall be known and designated as the 
‘‘Aretha Franklin Post Office Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Aretha Franklin Post 
Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
3976, to designate the facility of the 
U.S. Postal Service located at 12711 
East Jefferson Avenue in 
Detroit, 
Michigan, as the Aretha Franklin Post 
Office Building. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and 
colleague, 
Representative 
BRENDA 
LAWRENCE, for introducing this impor-
tant measure to honor a cultural and 
civil rights heroine. 
Aretha 
Franklin, 
the 
‘‘Queen 
of 
Soul,’’ was an American singer, song-
writer, pianist, and civil rights activist 
from Detroit, Michigan. Over her ca-
reer, Aretha Franklin was awarded 18 
Grammy awards, along with various 
lifetime achievement recognitions. 
Her unique vocal style not only influ-
enced generations of future singers, but 
it also earned her the number one spot 
on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 
Greatest Singers of All Time. 
Aretha Franklin was also a champion 
for civil rights and women’s rights. She 
frequently 
donated 
to 
civil 
rights 
groups, and two of her biggest hits, 
‘‘Respect’’ and ‘‘You Make Me Feel 
Like a Natural Woman,’’ became an-
thems for social change movements 
across the country. 
In 1987, she was the first woman to be 
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame. She also received the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom from Presi-
dent George W. Bush in 2005. 
Aretha Franklin died of advanced 
pancreatic cancer on August 16, 2018, in 
Detroit, Michigan. Naming a post of-
fice in the city she cherished so fondly 
would recognize her important cultural 
and civic accomplishments. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3976, introduced by my friend, Rep-
resentative BRENDA LAWRENCE. 
This bill, as has been mentioned, 
names a post office located in Detroit, 
Michigan, in honor of the ‘‘Queen of 
Soul,’’ Aretha Franklin. 
Aretha Franklin was an American 
singer, songwriter, pianist, and civil 
rights activist, and so we want to give 
honor where honor is due. 
She began her career as a child sing-
ing at her church in Detroit. For the 
next six decades, her distinctive voice 
captivated 
listeners 
and 
influenced 
countless other singers.

February 5, 2020 
So it is my delight to rise in support 
of this particular bill. It is out of ‘‘Re-
spect’’ for my good friend from Michi-
gan, and so we will ‘‘Say a Little Pray-
er’’ and hope that this goes through. 
b 1615 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), the 
author of this bill. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I will start by thanking the leader-
ship on the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform for marking up this legis-
lation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3976, which would rename a post 
office in my hometown of Detroit after 
the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. As 
was mentioned earlier, she was an 18 
Grammy Award winner; a star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame; and the first 
woman to be inducted into the Rock & 
Roll Hall of Fame. 
She performed at three inaugural 
events for Presidents Carter, Clinton, 
and Barack Obama. She was a woman 
who was respected on both sides of the 
aisle where President Bush issued her 
the Medal of Freedom. 
‘‘A Natural Woman’’ singer, she was 
more than just a music icon. She was a 
civil rights advocate who used her plat-
form and voice to advocate for racial 
equality. 
I knew her personally and she would 
talk to me about being a child and hav-
ing Martin Luther King in her home 
with her dad discussing policies and 
what they were going to do to fight to-
gether for racial equality. 
In 1967, Aretha released ‘‘Respect,’’ 
which became a rally cry for racial and 
gender political movements of the 
time. 
Although people remember Aretha 
Franklin as the ‘‘Queen of Soul’’ she 
was more than just a vocalist. Aretha 
used her platform to become a beacon 
of hope for people during the civil 
rights movement and her voice served 
as a perfect guiding light. 
In 
1967, 
she 
toured 
with 
Harry 
Belafonte and Sidney Poitier to raise 
money for Dr. Martin Luther King’s 
Southern Christian Leadership Con-
ference. The organization was in a dire 
financial state and would soon become 
the Poor People’s Campaign. 
In 1970, few people knew Aretha 
Franklin posted bond for Angela Davis, 
a prominent activist who was jailed on 
trumped-up charges. In 1970, a Jet mag-
azine article quoted Aretha Franklin: 
‘‘Black people will be free. I have been 
locked up for disturbing the peace in 
Detroit and I know you got to disturb 
the peace when you can’t get no peace. 
Jail is hell to be in. I’m going to see 
her free if there is any justice in our 
courts . . . because she’s a Black 
woman and she wants freedom for 
Black people.’’ 
In her 1999 autobiography, ‘‘Aretha: 
From These Roots’’ described the im-
pact Detroit had on her childhood and 
career. ‘‘Detroiters realize how deeply I 
appreciate the city in which I was 
raised. And it is in Detroit that I con-
tinue to cultivate my career; it is to 
Detroit that I direct most of my chari-
table activities; and it is from Detroit 
that I receive much love and support, 
which I reciprocate.’’ 
No matter how famous she became 
worldwide, Aretha always gave back to 
the city she grew up in. She frequently 
hosted 
community 
events 
for 
congregants in her father’s church, and 
she donated to organizations like Save 
the Children and Easterseals and sup-
ported local food banks across Detroit. 
In the year after her passing, an out-
pouring of support has led to the re-
naming of Detroit monuments in her 
honor—and I am so proud and happy to 
stand here today, personally knowing 
her, traveling with her on her tours—to 
include a post office near her home in 
Detroit to the list of ways to com-
memorate this amazing woman. 
While there is little that can truly 
demonstrate 
our 
appreciation 
for 
Aretha Franklin, I hope her family 
knows how proud and thankful we all 
are for her lifelong support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
give a little support R-E-S-P-E-C-T, to 
this legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Madam Chair for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 3976, the bill sponsored 
by my colleague, Mrs. LAWRENCE, and 
by the members of the Michigan dele-
gation. 
This bill honors the ‘‘Queen of Soul,’’ 
Aretha Franklin, and her innumerable 
contributions to music. Her faith in 
Detroit and its people is what I remem-
ber as much as her voice. This legisla-
tion serves as a fitting tribute to her 
esteemed legacy. 
Aretha Franklin grew up singing at 
the New Bethel Baptist Church with 
her father, Reverend C.L. Franklin. 
Aretha’s father was a good and dear 
friend to John Dingell, helping him 
early in his career. The two of them 
fought side by side in the fifties and 
the sixties for civil rights legislation. 
Aretha’s career includes more than 20 
Grammy Awards, the first woman in-
ducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of 
Fame and receiving the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. 
However, it is Aretha’s message 
through music of respect, love, and 
faith that will stay with us for genera-
tions. 
Today, I stand with my Michigan col-
leagues and urge every Member to 
honor Aretha Franklin’s legacy. Her 
contributions to our country are de-
serving of this recognition, and maybe 
we need to have her up there, up there 
with John, ‘‘say a little prayer’’ for us. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I will 
just cut to the chase. Let’s get this 
thing done and get it over with and 
make sure that we show the ‘‘respect’’ 
that we should. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 
3976. I had the opportunity to meet 
Aretha Franklin several times. She 
was a great friend of Charlie Rangel 
and would often perform for his events. 
She very generously gave her time to 
raise money for all kinds of civic rights 
events. She was a remarkable person 
and a great singer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to sup-
port this important legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON of Indiana). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3976. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

February 5, 2020 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
4794, to designate the facilities of the 
United States Postal Service located at 
8320 13th Avenue in Brooklyn, New 
York, as the Mother Frances Xavier 
Cabrini Post Office. 
I want to thank Representative MAX 
ROSE, a fellow Member, for introducing 
this bill honoring, literally, a saint. In 
November of 1880, Mother Cabrini, 
along with six other women, took reli-
gious vows and founded the Missionary 
Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. 
The purpose of the missionary was to 
care and educate orphans. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Congresswoman LAWRENCE for 
that kind introduction, and the gentle-
woman is an honorary fellow New 
Yorker. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my 
bill, H.R. 4794, to rename the post of-
fice in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn as the 
Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini Post 
Office. Mother Cabrini was a great New 
Yorker and a great American who de-
voted her life to helping the poor and 
underserved 
to 
include 
immigrants 
throughout New York City. 
Mother Cabrini is famous across the 
United States for her work providing 
education in underserved communities. 
She began her work organizing classes 
for Italian immigrants and orphans 
through the city. She helped found Co-
lumbus Hospital in New York City’s 
Lower East Side, which is now a part of 
the world-renowned Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center. 
After her success in New York, she 
was called upon to open up schools all 
around the world; not only across the 
United States, but also in Europe, and 
Central and South America. 
Mother Cabrini is not just a New 
York icon, although she is that. Her 
name is affixed to buildings in Chicago, 
Seattle, New Orleans, Denver, Los An-
geles, and Philadelphia. 
Cabrini was naturalized as a U.S. cit-
izen in 1909 and canonized as Saint 
Frances Xavier Cabrini on July 7, 1946 
by Pope Pius XII as the patron saint of 
immigrants. 
I am proud to have the support of my 
colleagues from the New York delega-
tion, both Democrats and Republicans, 
who have come together in recognition 
that the time has come to give Mother 
Cabrini her due recognition. 
Mother Cabrini will always be a shin-
ing example of our country’s commit-
ment to the less fortunate, particularly 
immigrants in our country. She also 
serves as a testament for the power of 
education, the power of education to 
relieve poverty and empower commu-
nities, regardless of their background. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this bill. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4794. I appreciate 
Representative ROSE’s willingness to 
acknowledge the great work of Mother 
Cabrini and so much has been said al-
ready about her accomplishments. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues support this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
LAWRENCE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4794. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4981 
to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 2505 
Derita Avenue in Charlotte, North 
Carolina, as the Julius L. Chambers 
Civil Rights Memorial Post Office. 
I thank Representative ALMA ADAMS 
for introducing this bill to honor Ju-
lius Chambers, a civil rights icon. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she 
may consume the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman from Michigan for 
yielding, as well the gentleman from 
North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4981, which would designate the 
U.S. Post Office facility at 2505 Derita 
Avenue in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
as the Julius L. Chambers Civil Rights 
Memorial Post Office. 
Julius LeVonne Chambers was born 
in Mount Gilead, North Carolina, in 
1935. When he was young, a White man 
stole from his father, an auto me-
chanic, by refusing to pay a substantial 
bill. When attorneys in Mount Gilead 
refused to hear his father’s case be-
cause his father was Black, Julius 
Chambers vowed to become a lawyer 
himself. 
At North Carolina Central Univer-
sity—then the North Carolina College 
at Durham—for his undergraduate edu-
cation, Chambers served as student 
body president. While attending UNC- 
Chapel Hill for law school, Julius 
Chambers was the first African Amer-
ican editor in chief of that school’s 
prestigious law review. 
Upon graduating and moving 
to 
Charlotte in 1964, Julius Chambers 
began a prolific legal career that would 
see him fight for justice and equality. 
He founded his own law firm and imme-
diately began to litigate key discrimi-
nation cases after White firms would 
not hire him. Mr. Chambers’ firm 
would later become North Carolina’s 
first integrated law firm, Ferguson 
Chambers & and Sumter, P.A. It is still 
in operation today. 
Notably, in 1970, Chambers argued 
successfully before the U.S. Supreme 
Court in the landmark Swann v. Char-
lotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education 
that resulted in the desegregation of 
the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school sys-
tem. 
As he fought for equality, there were 
many who fought to stop him. In Janu-
ary 1965, his car was burned. In Novem-
ber 1965, his home was bombed. And in 
February 
1971, 
his 
office 
was 
firebombed. 
According to The New York Times: 
‘‘His response was defiant; he said he 
would ‘keep fighting.’ It was also meas-
ured. ‘We must accept this type of 
practice,’ he said, ‘from those less in 
control of their faculties.’’’ 
Though he endured hardships, he did 
not grow weary of his mission. As he 
grew into one of the Nation’s most ac-
complished civil rights lawyers, Julius 
Chambers would go on to lead the 
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund for over 9 years, where he contin-
ued to fight for social justice and 
equality.

He would later return to North Caro-
lina Central University to serve as 
chancellor, 
where 
he 
proudly 
cul-
tivated young minds from 1993 until 
2001. 
After a lifetime of service to others, 
Julius L. Chambers passed away at the 
age of 76 in 2013. 
Mr. Speaker, my State and our Na-
tion are undoubtedly better because of 
the life of Julius L. Chambers. I ad-
mired this man, and I was pleased to 
know him and had many conversations 
with him during his lifetime. 
During this Black History Month, I 
hope that my colleagues will join me in 
voting in favor of this legislation and 
help me honor this civil rights legend 
in a community that he worked so hard 
to improve. 
I thank my colleague, Mr. MEADOWS, 
and all of my colleagues from North

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.

gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS). 
Certainly, she has gone over all the 
reasons why support for this measure is 
not only demanded, but it is certainly 
deserved. I would just join her in ask-
ing my colleagues to support it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to urge the passage of H.R. 4981. 
Mr. Speaker, this is such a signifi-
cant opportunity for us in Congress to 
be able to recognize lifelong accom-
plishments that are above the norm, 
people who give their lives so that 
their names will never be forgotten. 
It is with great honor that we recog-
nize a queen, a saint, and now a civil 
rights leader, and I urge the passage of 
H.R. 4981. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 5037 
to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 3703 
North Main Street in Farmville, North 
Carolina, as the Walter B. Jones, Jr. 
Post Office. 
I thank Representative MURPHY for 
introducing this measure honoring our 
former colleague. As you know, Walter 
Jones was born in North Carolina and 
was a longtime resident of Farmville. 
He 
later 
graduated 
from 
Atlantic 
Christian College and served 4 years in 
the National Guard. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE). 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to rise in support 
of this legislation, H.R. 5037, sup-
porting the designation of the Walter 
B. Jones, Jr. Post Office in his home-
town of Farmville, North Carolina. 
The late Walter Jones was a treas-
ured colleague and a personal friend, 
and I am glad to join others in the 
North Carolina delegation and in this 
Chamber in this fitting tribute. 
Walter, I think we would all agree, 
charted a path uniquely his own. His 
warmth and sincerity earned him re-
spect and affection on both sides of the 
aisle and across the entire spectrum of 
political attitudes and beliefs. The 
same was true in North Carolina 
among his constituents. 
Walter was perhaps best known for 
his devotion to our men and women in 
uniform and their families. He was at-
tentive, of course, to the needs of our 
military bases in North Carolina, but 
for Walter, this was very personal. He 
sent more than 10,000 letters to the 
families of fallen troops, and he memo-
rialized those who died from North 
Carolina’s Camp Lejeune with photos 
outside his office, all of this dem-
onstrating his genuine dedication to 
those who serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join in support of this resolution so 
that Walter’s memory can be honored 
in Farmville, a community he loved 
dearly and served tirelessly. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of this legislation, 
H.R. 5037. 
Walter Jones was not just a col-
league; he was a friend. For many of us 
in this Chamber, we can remember 
when he sat just off the center aisle 
there, just a few rows back from the 
front. He was consistently there and 
consistently a voice, as my friend from 
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE) just said, of 
those who had fallen in the ultimate 
fight for freedom and liberty. Many of 
us have pictures outside of our congres-
sional offices recognizing those who 
have fallen in their fight for liberty in 
the armed services, and that is due in 
no small part to our good friend, Mr. 
Walter Jones. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY), who is carrying on that leg-
acy in his congressional district. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
5037, which is a tribute to my prede-
cessor, friend, and mentor, Congress-
man Walter B. Jones. Sadly, he passed 
away while serving diligently in his of-
fice nearly a year ago. 
This legislation would designate the 
post 
office 
in 
his 
hometown 
of 
Farmville, North Carolina, as the Wal-
ter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office. 
He was the son of Walter B. Jones, 
Sr., and Doris Long. A devoted public 
servant, a man of great faith, and a 
proud American, Walter put the people 
and the needs of North Carolina’s Third 
District first. 
I knew Walter first as a patient, who 
then became a dear friend and then be-
came a political mentor. His passing 
was a loss for our State, our Nation, 
and for all who knew him and loved 
him. 
In part due to his own service in the 
military, Walter cared deeply about 
the brave men and women who served 
our country. After attending Hargrave 
Military Academy in Virginia, Walter 
graduated from Atlantic Christian Col-
lege in 1966 and went on to serve in the 
North Carolina National Guard for 4 
years. 
After serving for 10 years in the 
North Carolina House, he was elected 
to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives in 1995, where he would 
spend the remaining 24 years of his life 
diligently serving the people of North 
Carolina’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict. 
He worked tirelessly to ensure that 
he was always available to his con-
stituents and saw that they received 
assistance whenever they needed it, 
particularly 
with 
the 
VA 
and 
healthcare benefits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H831 
February 5, 2020 
Both in our Nation’s Capitol and in 
eastern North Carolina, Walter was 
known for his humility and kindheart-
edness. In fact, Walter was voted the 
nicest Member of Congress in 2004 in a 
survey conducted by the Washing-
tonian among top Capitol Hill staffers. 
Of course, Walter was known for his 
vigorous support of our military and 
particularly 
thousands 
of 
marines 
based in eastern North Carolina at 
Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps air 
stations in Cherry Point as well as New 
River, along with FRC East. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, he began a letter-writing 
campaign, 
ultimately 
sending 
over 
11,000 letters of condolences to families 
and extended family members of fallen 
soldiers. Outside of his office—and now 
my office—are hundreds of photos of 
those who have fallen for the freedom 
of this Nation. 
This was the kind of man he was: ad-
mirable, selfless, and caring. 
Additionally, some of Walter’s great-
est achievements while serving in Con-
gress included the work to ensure au-
tistic children of military families re-
ceived a proper education. He also ad-
vocated for the use of hyperbaric oxy-
gen therapy to treat veterans with 
traumatic brain injury and to protect 
the 
beautiful 
wild 
horses 
on 
Shackleford Banks and North Caro-
lina’s beaches. He had compassion and 
respect for these beautiful animals on 
the eastern shores. 
Walter left behind a legacy that epit-
omized what we all should aspire to be 
as a public servant. So it is my privi-
lege to introduce this bill honoring 
such a great American like Walter 
Jones. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
the entire North Carolina delegation 
for joining as original cosponsors of 
this piece of legislation, and I urge 
Members to adopt H.R. 5037, which 
would permanently name the post of-
fice after him in Farmville. 
b 1645 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
the great State of North Carolina (Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD), my colleague. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
the time and for her leadership and 
willingness to give time on this very 
important bill. 
I thank my colleagues, Congressman 
GREG MURPHY and Congressman MARK 
MEADOWS, for advancing this bill. I re-
member how well-connected they were 
to Walter B. Jones, Jr.—both of them— 
and I thank them for this legislation. 
It is my honor to join with Congress-
man GREG
MURPHY
in cosponsoring 
this legislation, and so I support H.R. 
5037. 
Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr., 
was a devoted man of great faith. He 
was my personal friend, Mr. Speaker, 
for more than 40 years. 
My colleagues will recall that, as 
Walter was beginning to decline in 
health, he was unable to come to the 
floor to have the oath of office admin-
istered to him, and Walter asked that I 
come to his home. The Speaker of the 
House authorized me to do so, and I 
went to his living room that day and 
administered the final oath of office to 
him. He was so appreciative, and we 
had a wonderful conversation that I 
shall never ever forget. 
Walter Jones was a lifetime public 
servant, serving in the National Guard 
for 4 years, in our general assembly for 
10 years, and here in Congress for 24 
long years as Representative of the 
Third Congressional District. 
Since I joined Congress in 2004, I 
watched Walter cast many difficult 
votes with conviction. I would sit right 
here to my left, and Walter would come 
by and, in his own way, he would say, 
‘‘Mr. Chairman,’’ and we would have a 
wonderful laugh about that. But he 
would stand firm in what he believed 
was right for his constituents and the 
American people. 
Although Walter is no longer with us, 
he left an indelible mark on eastern 
North Carolina. He left a mark on this 
House and the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I 
call on my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Walter Jones. 
I was particularly moved that so 
many of our colleagues traveled by 
military aircraft as we went to his fu-
neral that day. The Speaker of the 
House authorized the airplane, and we 
flew down to Greenville that day. 
The airplane was full of colleagues in 
a bipartisan manner. Democrats and 
Republicans both attended the funeral. 
And it was bicameral. You may remem-
ber that Senator Byrne and Senator 
TILLIS were there as well. 
So I thank them very much for hon-
oring this great man. 
And to the Jones family, to Joe Ann 
and Ashley, may God bless you, and 
may we keep the memory of Walter B. 
Jones, Jr., alive. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, all of 
us have come together to give a little 
bit of what we got in big doses, and 
that was compassion and care from a 
man who was not only strongest in his 
convictions, but resolute in those con-
victions as well. 
So I rise in support. I appreciate my 
colleagues opposite for their support of 
this. I appreciate Congressman MURPHY 
for his leadership as well, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here today just always in awe of 
the history of this House and those who 
have served, knowing personally the 
sacrifices and the skill set that is need-
ed to be successful. To be able to honor 
one of our own is something that I sup-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of 
H.R. 5037, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Representative 
Walter B. Jones, Jr., a fierce champion for 
North Carolina, a diligent public servant, and a 
personal friend to many across this body. 
Representative Jones passed away on Feb-
ruary 10, 2019, his 76th birthday. He worked 
tirelessly on behalf of our great state and 
served four years in the North Carolina Na-
tional Guard, ten years in the North Carolina 
General Assembly, and was a member of the 
House of Representatives for over three dec-
ades. 
A man of profound integrity, Representative 
Jones fought each and every day for what he 
believed was right. From championing our 
men and women in uniform to protecting our 
coastline, he was always a steadfast voice for 
the people of eastern North Carolina. 
Today I am proud to join the North Carolina 
Congressional Delegation in supporting H.R. 
5037, to designate a facility of the United 
States Postal Service as the ‘‘Walter B. Jones, 
Jr. Post Office,’’ located in his hometown of 
Farmville, North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in hon-
oring the life and legacy of Representative 
Walter B. Jones, Jr. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
LAWRENCE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5037. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H832 
February 5, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
3317, to permit the Scipio A. Jones Post 
Office in Little Rock, Arkansas, to ac-
cept and display a portrait of Scipio A. 
Jones. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
FRENCH HILL for introducing the meas-
ure to honor this civil rights icon. 
Scipio Jones was born in 1863 near 
Tulip, Arkansas. He would later argue 
two civil rights cases before the Arkan-
sas Supreme Court. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3317, introduced by 
my good friend, Representative FRENCH 
HILL. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from North Caro-
lina. I thank him particularly for his 
help in shepherding this bill through 
the committee. 
I am grateful, too, to our late, good 
friend Elijah Cummings for his support 
and the opportunity to thank him on 
the floor for his service in the House. 
Also, I thank my good friend from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE) for her sup-
port of this measure. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
in 
1919, 
American 
doughboys returning from the Euro-
pean front and its brutality were com-
mitted to benefiting from the oppor-
tunity and liberty they secured at 
great risk and sacrifice to themselves. 
Many took that commitment to auton-
omy and freedom home to small towns 
and 
communities 
and 
homesteads 
where their families and livelihoods re-
mained. 
Just over 100 years ago, as September 
bled over into October in 1919, few eyes 
in this country were turned to a small 
agrarian community in northeast Ar-
kansas. There, Black sharecroppers, 
spurred in part by the tales of oppor-
tunity and liberty spun by these re-
turning brave veterans of the war to 
end all wars, dared to discuss fair pay 
for their crops. 
To this day, an accurate account of 
the tragic loss of life that took place 
during the Elaine massacre, when 
White mobs killed more than 100 Afri-
can Americans, remains widely un-
known. 
But one of the heroic stories that 
emerged from the ashes of the Elaine 
massacre was that of Scipio Africanus 
Jones, one of the great lawyers in Ar-
kansas history. Jones’ skillful legal de-
fense saved the lives of 12 unfairly 
charged sharecroppers from the Elaine 
massacre who were originally sen-
tenced to death by an Arkansas State 
court. 
Jones’ actions resulted in the land-
mark Supreme Court decision in Moore 
v. Dempsey, establishing that Federal 
courts could review criminal convic-
tions in State courts under the Due 
Process 
Clause 
of 
the 
Fourteenth 
Amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this 
legislation today that I have sponsored 
to honor his legacy, the Scipio A. 
Jones Post Office Portrait Act, is being 
considered on the House floor. 
Today’s measure is a simple one. It 
authorizes a portrait of Scipio Jones to 
be displayed at the U.S. Post Office in 
Little Rock, Arkansas, that bears his 
name. It has the support of the entire 
Arkansas delegation. 
Scipio Jones’ fight for civil rights 
and equality is an important part of 
Arkansas’ history and something that 
we are deeply proud of in our State. 
The Elaine massacre had a profound 
impact on the soul of our State that 
can be felt a century later. However, 
history always teaches us that we can 
learn from our past. We have an oppor-
tunity, today, with this legislation, to 
write a new chapter on Arkansas his-
tory that recognizes the legacy of the 
tragedy, honors the victims, and seeks 
to heal longstanding wounds. I am de-
lighted to draft and sponsor this bill 
that helps accomplish that goal. 
Our friend from North Carolina, the 
late Elijah Cummings, I am grateful 
for their help and the staff of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. I ap-
preciate it for the quick markup, and I 
am grateful for the support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge this measure’s 
passage. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
the bill’s passage, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge support for the passage of H.R. 
3317, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

A native of Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-

of combat veterans and wounded sol-
diers. She knew the struggles they 
faced when returning home from duty.

Mindy highlighted her commitment to

Hunts 
for

Mindy founded Hunts for Healing to 
help wounded soldiers returning from 
military missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, 
and other combat missions transition 
back into civilian life, allowing them 
to experience the joys of hunting, in-
cluding social interaction and camara-
derie. 
With the assistance of volunteer 
guides and funded entirely by private 
donations, Hunts for Healing helps vet-
erans in need of physical, spiritual, and 
emotional support. In Laceyville, to 
the veterans she has helped and their 
families and loved ones, Mindy is noth-
ing short of a hero. 
For the impact of her life and for her 
continued legacy to the veterans’ com-
munity, I urge members to support

Laceyville, Pennsylvania, for Melinda 
Gene Piccotti.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week and the countless 
Americans whose lives have been im-
pacted by gun violence across the coun-
try. 
This issue is personal to me, as it is 
for so many others. When I was 16 
years old, as a young police cadet, an 
accidental gunshot left me paralyzed. 
Last week, I had the honor of spend-
ing time with former Congresswoman 
Gabby Giffords, our colleague, in my 
home State of Rhode Island. Gabby’s 
life was forever changed by a gunman 
in 2011, but she never stopped fighting. 
She spoke of the courage it takes to 
stop gun violence, courage that she em-
bodies every single day. 
So, to the parents, children, stu-
dents, teachers, and countless others 
who have lost loved ones to gun vio-
lence or faced gun violence themselves, 
I encourage you to keep fighting. 
Together, we can reform our gun 
laws and keep guns out of the wrong 
hands and save others from tragedy. 
f 
OFFICIAL COPY OF PRESIDENT’S 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, we 
heard a great speech by the President 
last night, who spoke to the strength of 
our country and the courage and char-
acter of our fellow citizens: 
People like 100-year-old Tuskegee 
airman 
Retired 
Brigadier 
General 
Charles McGee and his great-grandson, 
the 13-year-old who dreams of going to 
space; 
People like single mother Stephanie 
Davis and her lovely fourth grade 
daughter who received an Opportunity 
Scholarship. Who in this room does not 
remember the look on Stephanie’s face 
as she realized that her daughter was 
going to get an opportunity that she 
sacrificed so greatly for; 
And people like Sergeant First Class 
Townsend Williams, who surprised his 
wife, Amy, and two beautiful children 
in the gallery last night. 
As I looked around, I saw tears in 
many people’s eyes from the emotion 
that they felt at that time. 
Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI was 
unmoved and chose to tear up the 
House copy of that speech. She had no 
right to destroy this document, espe-
cially one filled with such impactful 
stories of American patriots. 
The record was presented before the 
people’s House and it belongs to the 
American people. That is why I am 
here today. 
In my hand, I have an official copy of 
the President’s State of the Union ad-
dress signed by the President, given to 
me at the White House today. It will be 
delivered to the House Clerk to be 
archived and preserved for posterity, 
whether she likes it or not. 
These great American stories will be 
remembered by history, not erased by 
the Speaker. We are better because of 
them, and we should learn from them 
and we should be proud that they will 
shape our future. 
f 
b 1800 
REACTION TO PRESIDENT’S STATE 
OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, obviously, 
each of us had our own reaction to the 
speech that was given by the President 
last night. He had every right under 
the First Amendment to say what he 
believed, what he was going to do, and 
what he wanted us to do. 
I suggest to you that if I took this 
card and tore it up because I didn’t like 
what was on the card, I am protected 
by the First Amendment in doing that. 
That is a form of speech. If the effort is 
to shut one another up, perhaps we will 
go down that road. 
But, clearly, most of you in this 
House, or at least some of you in this 
House, have said an act of destroying 
things that the leader alleges are prop-
erty of the House—I will ask for a rul-
ing on that, Mr. Speaker, in just a 
minute—but is an act of disagreement. 
It is not an assertion, per se, that 
what was said was wrong, disagreed 
with, or anything else. It was not an 
outcry to the President of the United 
States that ‘‘You lie’’ that clearly un-
dermined the decorum of this House. 
Frankly, I did not see the Speaker 
tear that up. I have seen it on tele-
vision. It has been played, but I would 
suggest to you very seriously—well, 
whether anyone saw it or not, that is 
not my argument. My argument is, if 
each of us watches closely on the floor 
each of our actions and we deem those 
actions to be disrespectful, either to 
the Speaker, that is, the Speaker at 
the rostrum or from the microphones 
behind the desk, do we bring a resolu-
tion that that was disrespectful? 
Each of you who say ‘‘yes,’’ well, I 
will watch very closely, and we will go 
back and forth, and that will not be a 
good precedent because it will under-
mine the premise of the First Amend-
ment that action is speech. 
Now, an action that is criminal, an 
action that defames, an action that 
brings the House into disrepute, that is 
another issue. But an action which 
says: ‘‘I feel this way’’ should be pro-
tected. Now, not necessarily agreed 
with, maybe even subject to criticism, 
but certainly, not subject to a resolu-
tion. 
This resolution will not go forward, 
of course, because I will move to table 
it if it is offered because I believe it un-
dermines the First Amendment and the 
House.

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER 
RESOLUTION RAISING A QUES-
TION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF 
THE HOUSE 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I seek 
recognition to give notice of my intent 
to raise a question of the privileges of 
the House. 
The form of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
House Resolution 832. 
Whereas on December 20th, 2019, 
Speaker PELOSI extended an invitation 
for President Trump to address a joint 
session of Congress on February 4th, 
2020; 
Whereas on February 4th, 2020, Presi-
dent Trump delivered his State of the 
Union address, in which he honored the 
sacrifice of the following American he-
roes and their families: 
General Charles McGee, one of the 
last surviving Tuskegee airmen, who 
served in World War II, the Korean war 
and the Vietnam war; 
Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid 
worker who was caring for suffering ci-
vilians in Syria when she was kid-
napped, tortured and enslaved by ISIS 
for over 500 days before being murdered 
by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; 
Army Staff Sergeant Christopher 
Hake, who was killed while serving his 
second tour of duty in Iraq by a road-
side bomb supplied by Iranian terrorist 
leader Qasem Soleimani; 
Sergeant First Class Townsend Wil-
liams, who is currently serving his 
fourth deployment in the Middle East

and his wife, Amy, who works full-time 
for the Army and devotes hundreds of 
hours helping military families; 
Whereas immediately following the 
address, while still presiding over the 
joint session, Speaker PELOSI ripped up 
an official copy of the President’s re-
marks, which contained the names and 
stories of these patriots who sacrificed 
so much for our country; and 
Whereas the conduct of Speaker 
PELOSI was a breach of decorum and de-
graded the proceedings of the joint ses-
sion, to the discredit of the House: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Rep-
resentatives disapproves of the behav-
ior of Speaker PELOSI during the joint 
session of Congress held on February 4, 
2020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
rule IX, a resolution offered from the 
floor by a Member other than the ma-
jority leader or the minority leader as 
a question of the privileges of the 
House has immediate precedence only 
at a time designated by the Chair with-
in 2 legislative days after the resolu-
tion is properly noticed. 
Pending that designation, the form of 
the resolution noticed by the gentle-
woman from Texas will appear in the 
RECORD at this point. 
The Chair will not at this point de-
termine whether the resolution con-
stitutes a question of privilege. That 
determination will be made at the time 
designated for consideration of the res-
olution. 
f 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the major-
ity leader asserted in his comments 
that the document in question was the 
property of the House. 
Was, in fact, the document that the 
Speaker had to read the property of the 
House? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
message is part of the proceedings of 
the House and can be used by the House 
for archival and printing purposes. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, an addi-
tional question. 
Mr. Speaker, after the President had 
spoken the State of the Union and de-
livered that to the Congress of the 
United States, at the end of that ses-
sion, I moved that that document be 
enrolled in the House proceedings of 
last evening. 
Am I to understand from the ruling 
that that document was specifically 
the document that would have been en-
rolled? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The mo-
tion was adopted. 
Mr. HOYER. Yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. And the 
document was printed. 
Mr. HOYER. That document did not 
exist according to the assertion of the 
Republican leader. It was destroyed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
message is part of the proceedings of 
the House and can be used by the House 
for archival and printing purposes. The 
gentleman has addressed the printing 
of the document. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
think that answered my question. 
My question was: Was the document 
that was destroyed or torn apart, the 
document that was to be enrolled by 
the House pursuant to my motion? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
House is able to use that document and 
other materials to fulfill the order of 
the House. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, to 
clarify, was that document provided 
from the President to the Speaker of 
the House a document of the House? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is 
part of the proceedings of the House 
and can be used by the House for archi-
val and printing purposes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. So to be clear, your 
answer is: That is a document of the 
House, and the President provides one 
to the Speaker for the House, and the 
President provides one to the President 
of the Senate, the Vice President, for 
the Senate? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The doc-
ument was printed as a document of 
the House upon order of the House. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Further parliamen-
tary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, is it 
allowed to destroy a document of the 
House? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will not provide an advisory 
opinion. The Chair is not going to give 
advisory opinions. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. But to be clear, it is 
a document of the House, much like 
any historical document that has been 
provided to the floor of this House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is engaged in debate, and the 
gentleman is free to engage in debate 
on the resolution at the appropriate 
time. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the resolu-
tion is not on the floor, I don’t think. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, no, 
the gentleman is correct. It was her in-
tention. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Who 
seeks recognition? 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, further 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask for 
clarification. Obviously, the Parlia-
mentarian—I think we ought to clarify 
this issue. 
If the document has been torn apart 
as is alleged, and as we know it was, 
that document, presumably, is not the 
document that was enrolled by the 
House pursuant to my motion last 
night. 
I know it is not in the possession of 
the House. I know that for a fact. But 
there is, pursuant to my motion, a doc-
ument that has been enrolled, the 
President’s address in the State of the 
Union. 
So I simply want to make the point 
to the Parliamentarian and to the 
Speaker, that the document that—I 
have been here for a long period of 
time. 
Numerous 
times, 
numerous 
times, I have had in this drawer a copy 
of the President’s speech that is deliv-
ered by the communication staff of the 
White House. 
Mr. Speaker, is that to be pre-
sumed—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Respect-
fully, the gentleman is engaged in de-
bate. This issue is more properly ad-
dressed in the format of 1-minute 
speeches. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Parliamentary in-
quiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, you 
clarified that is a document of the 
House. Can you clarify that is not a 
document for the Speaker, but a docu-
ment for the House? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The doc-
ument is used as part of House pro-
ceedings and can be used for archival 
and printing purposes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Further parliamen-
tary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will his state 
his parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Did the Speaker 
have any history in past State of the 
Unions where that document provided 
to the Speaker has not been enshrined 
into the RECORD? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Respect-
fully, the Chair will not act as a histo-
rian. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, parliamen-
tary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas will state his par-
liamentary inquiry. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, in 2009, the 
majority leader, now Mr. HOYER, led a 
formal rebuke of South Carolina Rep-
resentative JOE WILSON defending ‘‘the 
rules of the House and enforcing the 
traditional decorum of the Chamber.’’ 
At the time, Mr. HOYER said: ‘‘This 
House cannot stay silent. What is at 
issue here is important to the House 
and of importance to the country.’’ 
My parliamentary inquiry is—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Respect-
fully, the gentleman is engaged in de-
bate. The House may address this dur-
ing 1-minute speeches. 
Mr. BRADY. Is the Speaker of the 
House—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

tion is this: Is the Speaker ripping up

COMMEMORATING NATIONAL GUN 
VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam 
Speaker, getting back to the business 
of the people, this week is National 
Gun Violence Survivors Week when we 
honor and remember the lives that we 
have lost to gun violence, those whom 
we have loved and miss terribly, people 
like my father, Guido Mucarsel; Jaime 
Guttenberg; De’Michael Dukes; Joa-
quin Oliver; Tel Orfanos; Jerry Wright; 
and all of their loved ones who now 
must live with the pain forever. 
The sad reality is that 58 percent of 
Americans or someone they know has 
experienced gun violence in their life-
time. The number of gun violence sur-
vivors increases in each passing day, 
tragedy after tragedy. The mental and 
emotional toll on survivors is im-
mense, and many people are thrust 
into financial hardship. 
These are experiences that no one 
chooses to endure. We must not only 
remember those who have died but also 
those who have survived and do all we 
can to help them in their never-ending 
journey toward healing. 
To all of those who are remembering 
a loved one this week, we stand with 
you.

REMEMBERING BONNIE DUVALL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Ms. Bonnie Duvall, who passed 
away on January 18 at the age of 61 
after a brave battle with cancer. 
Ms. Duvall was known to many as 
the first lady of American agriculture. 
She was married to Mr. Zippy Duvall, 
the president of the American Farm 
Bureau, and enjoyed accompanying 
him to Farm Bureau events across the 
country. She was also the loving moth-
er of one of my former staff members, 
Zellie, who was with me on my first 
day here at the Capitol. 
Throughout her life, her dedication 
to the farming community made a last-
ing impact on agriculture in southeast 
Georgia, and there is no doubt that she 
is leaving it in a better place than she 
found it. 
On her own farm, she used her busi-
ness expertise gained at the University 
of Georgia to keep the books. She was 
named the 1982 National Young Farmer 
and Rancher of the Year, and she was a 
consistent member of the Greene Coun-
ty Farm Bureau Women’s Committee. 
Most importantly, she was an overall 
inspiring and genuine person who will 
always be remembered for her opti-
mistic attitude. Ms. Duvall is going to 
be deeply missed throughout the agri-
culture community. 
Zellie, Zippy, and the entire Duvall 
family are in my thoughts and prayers. 
f 
DEFEND AMERICAN HEALTHCARE 
SYSTEM 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in defense of the American 
healthcare system. 
Last week, the administration pro-
posed a new demonstration program 
that would allow States to apply for 
block 
grants. 
These 
would 
permit 
States to slash funding for their Med-
icaid programs, reduce protections for 
beneficiaries, and restrict eligibility 
standards. A recent study by George 
Washington 
University 
found 
that 
these changes would also result in com-
munity health centers treating 5 mil-
lion fewer patients over the next 4 
years. 
This is unacceptable. Federal law al-
ready gives Medicaid flexibility to 
change from State to State. These pro-
posed block grants are nothing more 
than cuts to funding for the program. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting for a resolution con-
demning these proposed changes as 
what 
they 
are: 
attacks 
on 
our 
healthcare system and those with pre-
existing conditions.

(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Sheriff Ronnie Sprin-
kle, who began his service as the sher-
iff of Botetourt County nearly two dec-
ades ago. When Ronnie was just 6 
months, his father was elected as 
Botetourt County sheriff and held the 
position for 30 years, retiring in 1991. 
Eight years later, the junior Sprinkle 
followed in his dad’s footsteps and was 
elected to the same post, which he held 
until retirement last month. 
Save the 8 years between his father’s 
retirement and Ronnie’s election, 2020 
will mark the first time since the heart 
of the Vietnam war that a Sprinkle has 
not led the Botetourt Sheriff’s Office. 
I want to thank Sheriff Ronnie for 
his years of service to our community 
and congratulate him on all he has ac-
complished during his tenure. His tire-
less work to secure funding for a new 
public safety building and jail will not 
be forgotten. 
The risks and responsibilities that 
come with being a law enforcement of-
ficer are many, and I want to express 
my sincere gratitude to Ronnie Sprin-
kle for his unwavering commitment to 
Botetourt County and all our men and 
women in blue. 
f 
PASS COMPREHENSIVE GUN 
REFORM 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise in recognition of 
National 
Gun 
Violence 
Survivors 
Week. 
Last month, with the leadership of 
my House colleagues and Senator ELIZ-
ABETH WARREN, I was proud to intro-
duce the Gun Violence Prevention and 
Community Safety Act, the most com-
prehensive piece of gun reform legisla-
tion this Chamber has ever seen. 
We will mandate universal back-
ground checks, which will help keep 
guns out of the hands of those who 
should not have them. We will crack 
down on gun trafficking. And we will 
hold the gun industry accountable for 
putting profits over the safety of the 
American people. 
I promise today to fight so that not 
one more American is burdened with 
living as a gun violence survivor be-
cause of irresponsible, outdated, and 
morally bankrupt Federal gun policies. 
f 
BRI FOLDS GOES PRO 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to honor a talented young lady 
from my district. 
Bri Folds, a Lakeland Christian and 
Auburn grad, was drafted in the fourth 
round of the 2020 National Woman’s 
Soccer League draft by the North Caro-
lina Courage. 
Ms. Folds is the first player from 
Polk County to be drafted by the Na-
tional Women’s Soccer League. Folds 
was a two-time Lakeland Ledger Play-
er of the Year, with 173 goals and 155 
assists while at Lakeland Christian. 
She finished her college career ranked 
seventh all-time at Auburn in assists, 
eighth in goals, and tied for fifth in 
game-winning goals with nine. 
I am extraordinarily proud of her 
dedication and drive. It is important 
that our community continues to in-
vest in future generations to produce 
stars and leaders like Ms. Folds. Play-
ers like her will influence young girls 
for years to come. 
I encourage all of District 15 to join 
me in cheering on Bri Folds when the 
2020 NWSL season begins in March.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H839 
February 5, 2020 
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2382, the USPS Fairness Act, which 
passed today with large bipartisan and 
union support. I was proud to lead this 
bill with my friends and colleagues, 
Chairman PETER
DEFAZIO
and Rep-
resentatives BRIAN
FITZPATRICK
and 
TOM REED. 
The USPS Fairness Act will repeal 
the mandate for the United States 
Postal Service to prefund future retiree 
health benefits. No other government 
agency or private business is plagued 
with a mandate like this. Since 2006, 
the prefunding mandate has wreaked 
havoc on USPS’s finances, costing the 
agency $5.4 billion each year. 
I represent one of the most rural dis-
tricts in the Nation, and in southern 
New Mexico, post offices and postal 
workers are an integral part of our 
communities, connecting businesses to 
customers, pharmacies to patients, and 
families to friends spread across our 
vast country. 
Congress created this prefunding cri-
sis, so I am pleased the House of Rep-
resentatives took the first step to solve 
it. I ask that the Senate take the next 
step with us. 
f 
HONORING CHIEF DANIEL SPIEGEL 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to honor Chief Daniel Spie-
gel on his retirement from the Wild-
wood Fire Department. 
Daniel spent 28 faithful years with 
the fire department, where he had 
served as chief since 2016. Daniel has 
the distinct honor of holding every 
rank in the fire department. Daniel’s 
father also served as fire chief in Wild-
wood, the second-ever father-son chief 
in the department’s history. 
Daniel served in the New Jersey Task 
Force 1 Urban Research and Rescue 
and responded to the September 11 ter-
rorist attacks, searching for survivors. 
He was the team leader for the Cape 
May County Regional Urban Search 
and Rescue Team, which serves all of 
Cape May County. 
Danny was always focused on train-
ing. He trained thousands of fire-
fighters in our entire region. 
He is planning to spend more time 
with his wife, daughter, and two step-
sons in retirement. 
I thank Daniel for his service; his 
community thanks him for his service; 
and his country thanks him for his 
service. 
Daniel, may God bless you. You are 
truly one of our heroes. 
f 
FIGHT FOR JUSTICE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
our emerging Nation sought to be a 
bright light for democracy and the rule 
of law. This afternoon, I sat in the Sen-
ate Chamber and watched the Senate 
one by one announce the words guilty 
or not guilty: Article I, guilty 48, not 
guilty 52; Article II, guilty 47, not 
guilty 53. 
I believe the presentation of the Ju-
diciary, Oversight, Intelligence, and 
Foreign Affairs Committees was bril-
liantly presented. 
I wondered whether there would be 
one moment for a profile in courage, 
one understanding that the norm of 
this Nation cannot tolerate what the 
Framers were most frightened about, 
which was the constitutional crime of 
abuse of power or having a sovereign 
nation interfere with our elections. 
Yet, there was one in Article I that 
made it bipartisan in the guilt, but no 
one in Article II. 
Simply stated, now what is the an-
swer? That this Nation no longer loves 
its democracy; does not stand by the 
rule of law; and, therefore, the person 
who remains in office is a king? 
I believe, Madam Speaker, that we 
must raise the Constitution and fight 
for justice. 
f 
DECORUM AND MAINTAINING 
CIVILITY IN THE HOUSE 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to note, in regard to the assertion of 
the majority leader that the act of de-
stroying the House copy of President 
Trump’s State of the Union speech was 
speech 
protected 
under 
the 
First 
Amendment, I rise to assert that not 
all speech protected under the First 
Amendment is allowable under the 
rules of the House. 
Moreover, the act of destroying the 
House’s copy of the State of the Union 
Address diminishes the decorum that is 
critical to maintaining the civility 
that is expected of every Member, in-
cluding and especially the Speaker. 
f 
TAKE ACTION FOR GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, during National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week, I rise to recognize my 
State of the Union guest, Mary Miller- 
Strobel, from my hometown of Berk-
ley, Michigan. 
After her brother, Ben, was honor-
ably discharged from the military, 
Mary grew concerned that Ben was at 
risk of self-harm. Mary and her father 
drove to every gun store in their small 
town, begging them not to sell Ben a 
gun. But they had no legal recourse to 
block a store from selling Ben the gun 
that would end his life. Ben died by sui-
cide soon thereafter. 
Had Mary been able to seek an ex-
treme risk protection order, Ben might 
still be alive today. 
Mary is now a Moms Demand Action 
leader and has turned her tragedy into 
a triumphant story of fighting to pre-
vent other families from suffering this 
tremendous and preventable loss. 
The House has passed commonsense 
gun violence legislation, and we will 
pass red flag legislation, too. Now, we 
need the Senate to act, for Mary and 
Ben, and for so many others.

b 1830 
SUPPORT OF U.S. POSTAL 
SERVICE FAIRNESS ACT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2382, or the 
U.S. Postal Service Fairness Act up for 
a vote today. 
Madam Speaker, 13 years ago, the 
Postal Service was saddled by this 
body when we required it—not with my 
support—to prefund its retirement ben-
efits. Unfortunately, this prevented the 
Postal Service from addressing critical 
equipment 
modernization 
needs. 
Thankfully, this legislation allows us 
to correct this misguided requirement. 
The post office is a constitutionally 
mandated institution. A sense of com-
munity is sustained every time the 
mailwoman or mailman delivers a let-
ter, increasing connectivity in rural 
and urban districts alike. The Postal 
Service delivers close to 190 million 
pieces of mail every single day and is a 
testament to American ingenuity. In-
deed, postal workers are the best am-
bassadors, receiving an overwhelm-
ingly high public approval rating of 74 
percent. 
While we work to ensure the post of-
fice’s financial health, we must also 
continue to increase innovation, such 
as through modernizing postal services. 
For example, creative initiatives could 
increase access to basic functions in 
post offices and underserved commu-
nities. 
I thank my friend, Representative 
PETER DEFAZIO, for his true leadership 
on this bill, and urge all my colleagues 
to support its passage, and thank those 
who did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H840 
February 5, 2020 
we take up this bill because the Amer-
ican economy is not working for most 
American families. 
While corporations and the wealthy 
continue to capture the rewards of a 
growing economy, working families 
and middle class Americans are being 
left behind. From 1980 to 2017, average 
incomes for the bottom 90 percent of 
households increased just 1.1 percent, 
while average incomes for the wealthi-
est 1 percent increased by 184 percent. 
This inequality is not a natural prod-
uct of a functioning economy. It is not 
all due to globalization or technology 
change. It is the result of policy 
choices that have stripped workers of 
the power to join together and nego-
tiate for decent wages, benefits, and 
working conditions. 
The Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act restores fairness to the economy 
by strengthening the Federal laws that 
protect workers’ rights to form a 
union. 
You know, our basic labor law, the 
National Labor Relations Act was 
passed 85 years ago in 1935. It was a 
core part of the New Deal. A lot of 
credit is due to the man for whom it is 
named, Senator Wagner of New York. 
Also, in addition to FDR, our Presi-
dent, our amazing Secretary of Labor, 
Frances Perkins deserves of a huge 
amount of credit. 
And after the Wagner Act was passed, 
or the National Labor Relations Act in 
1935, within just 12 years, one-third of 
American workers were members of 
unions. And that figure, about a third 
of all workers being in unions, per-
sisted for some time. But then employ-
ers went on the attack to try to under-
mine that law. 
In 1947, over President Truman’s 
veto, the Taft Hartley amendments 
were passed, and they gutted a lot of 
what workers wanted in 1935. And then 
in 1959, the Landrum-Griffin amend-
ments were passed in the Eisenhower 
era, and they further eroded workers’ 
rights. 
So that while a third of workers were 
union members in the late 1940s and 
early 1950s, by the time that I started 
organizing workers in 1983, about 161⁄2 
percent of private sector workers were 
in unions. And today, in 2020, just 6.2 
percent of workers in the private sec-
tor in our country have the voice and 
power of a union. And this has deci-
mated the American middle class. And 
it has made the American Dream re-
cede from view for so many American 
workers. 
So we are going to spend some time 
tonight talking about the PRO Act, 
and I want to invite my esteemed col-
league from the great State of Min-
nesota, Representative OMAR, to join 
me in saying a few words about the 
PRO Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentle-
woman from Minnesota such time as 
she may consume. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
LEVIN) for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the role that organized labor has 
played in improving the lives of count-
less working men and women across 
this country. 
Labor unions have been the driving 
force for all positive change for work-
ers in modern history. As a former 
union member myself, I can attest to 
the power that workers wield when 
they exercise their right to organize. 
And I have seen the incredible work 
that unions in Minnesota have accom-
plished when they came together to 
fight for working rights. 
On average, a worker covered by a 
union contract, earns over 13 percent 
more in wages than someone with simi-
lar education, occupation, and experi-
ence in nonunionized workplaces. And 
unions are about so much more than 
wages. They create solidarity between 
workers across gender, race, ethnicity, 
and religion. That is why we need the 
PRO Act, and why we must pass it this 
week, and pressure the Senate to do 
the same. 
It will address the challenges and at-
tacks that labor unions have been fac-
ing for decades that have led to the 
erosion of wages, a spike in workplace 
discrimination and a dangerous growth 
in inequality in our society at every 
turn. 
The PRO Act puts power back in the 
hands of workers where it belongs. I do 
not want to envision what workplaces 
would look like for my children and 
their grandchildren one day if we do 
not pass the PRO Act. It is a crucial 
step to strengthening labor rights so 
that we can help shepherd through a 
new generation of victories for working 
unions and members. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted for 
our chairman and vice chairman on the 
Committee on Education and Labor for 
their work in championing labor rights 
on behalf of American workers. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative OMAR 
for being such a champion of workers 
in Minnesota and throughout this 
great Nation and, indeed, throughout 
our world. 
Madam Speaker, I will take a few 
moments to talk about the breadth of 
this bill. 
What has happened to workers in this 
country over the last several decades is 
the result of many administrative ac-
tions by various administrations, regu-
latory actions that administrations 
have taken that stripped workers of 
their rights, judicial decisions from the 
lower courts all the way up to the Su-
preme Court, and laws passed by the 
Congress and the States, to the point 
where millions and millions of workers 
aren’t even covered by the National 
Labor Relations Act, can’t even exer-
cise their rights under the National 
Labor Relations Act, and the rights 
that they have are so badly eroded 
that, functionally, workers don’t have 
the freedom to form unions in this 
country. 
And Representative OMAR referenced 
Chairman SCOTT. Chairman SCOTT and 
the staff of this committee have done 
such an incredible job at looking at the 
complexity of the workplace in 2020 
and including the many ways in which 
we need to make changes to help work-
ers. 
I want to highlight several things: 
The first is the problem of multiple 
employers and protecting employees of 
multiple employers. 
The PRO Act will make it so that 
two or more persons are employers 
under the National Labor Relations 
Act, if each codetermines or shares 
control over the employees’ essential 
terms and conditions of employment. 
It basically codifies the joint employer 
standard in the NLRB’s Browning-Fer-
ris decision of 2015. And this is ex-
tremely important because in a lot of 
industries, employers have tried to 
evade their responsibility to workers 
under the National Labor Relations 
Act through various schemes of cor-
porate organization so that the com-
pany that really is in charge, that real-
ly determines what uniform they wear, 
what route they drive, what kind of 
products they serve, everything about 
their job, is not considered an em-
ployer under the act. 
The PRO Act will fix that, and it is 
very important to help millions of 
workers get their rights under the 
NLRA. 
Another huge problem of excluding 
workers from accessing their rights is 
misclassification of workers as inde-
pendent contractors. 
The PRO Act will fix this problem by 
using a simple three-part test to deter-
mine whether someone is an employee 
or an independent contractor. And this 
will help, again, another set of millions 
of workers gain access to their rights 
and clarify that they are covered as 
workers, as employees under the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act. So they 
can form a union, bargain collectively, 
get a contract, and get justice. 
Another major area of the law in-
volves protecting workers in their 
right to engage in protected activities. 
So let’s talk about workers going on 
strike. 
The PRO Act will prohibit employers 
from permanently replacing workers 
who go on strike. This is hugely impor-
tant, because permanent replacement 
of strikers has been a tactic used over 
the last, really, 40 years to deter work-
ers from engaging in strikes at all and 
taking away this very core right of 
withholding your labor as a way to try 
to get better working conditions. 
I remember what happened in, for ex-
ample, the meat packing industry, 
which used to be a largely unionized in-
dustry. And the workers’ organizations 
were largely destroyed by preventing 
workers from engaging in strikes, to 
the point where their wages and bene-
fits were cut massively and many of 
their facilities were moved, and they 
couldn’t do anything about it. 
Another thing that the PRO Act will 
do is prohibit offensive lockouts. Under 
current law, employers may offensively

H841 
February 5, 2020 
lock out employees in the absence of a 
threatened strike with the goal of the 
employer being to curtail the workers’ 
ability to strike by removing workers 
control over the timing and duration of 
a work stoppage. 
Current law also permits employers 
to hire temporary replacements during 
an offensive lockout. So if the em-
ployer thinks there might be a labor 
dispute, even if the workers hadn’t 
planned to go on strike, they lock the 
workers out and temporarily replace 
them, stripping them of their ability to 
make their own strategy about how 
they want to enforce their right under 
the act. 
The PRO Act prohibits any lockouts 
prior to strike but it maintains em-
ployers’ rights to respond to strikes 
with defensive lockouts, which is ap-
propriate. 
Another key change that the PRO 
Act would put into law after all these 
years from the Taft-Hartley amend-
ments is removing limitations on sec-
ondary strikes. The idea here is that 
the Congress in 1947 said that workers 
of one company can’t engage in collec-
tive activity in solidarity with workers 
in another company. 
Workers might picket or strike or 
support a boycott in solidarity with 
other workers to improve the other 
workers on their own, perhaps, wages 
and working conditions. 
b 1845 
Being allowed to protest however you 
want in America about what some 
other company might be doing is a fun-
damental First Amendment right. 
This has been something that has 
bothered me for decades. It is fun-
damentally unfair in this country, and 
the PRO Act would fix this by allowing 
workers to have their full freedoms to 
engage in secondary activity. 
A crucial thing that the PRO Act 
would do to help workers vindicate 
their rights under the National Labor 
Relations Act is prohibiting captive 
audience meetings. 
So it is hard for people who haven’t 
been through a union organizing cam-
paign to really understand how absurd 
it is to claim that a union election is 
sort of just like a political election, 
where you go down to the local school 
or church or wherever you vote, and 
you get in line and they check whether 
you are on the voting rolls, and you 
cast your ballot in a little booth. You 
wouldn’t dream of putting your job at 
risk or that anybody could do some-
thing to you for how you vote in Amer-
ica; it is a core thing. 
That is not how it works in a union 
election. And one of the things that 
employers have been allowed to do is 
they can force you to attend a meeting, 
the sole purpose of which is to pressure 
you not to vote for a union. They can 
do that every time you go to work. 
They can do it for your whole shift. 
If you say, ‘‘I have been to five of 
your presentations about the union; I 
don’t want to go anymore,’’ you can be 
fired for not going to the employer’s 
propaganda offensive against forming a 
union. It is something, without par-
allel, in American law and in our econ-
omy only to prohibit or try to prevent 
workers from forming a union. 
So the PRO Act will change this at 
long last and say that people have 
their First Amendment rights, we are 
all grownups here, and your employer 
cannot make you go to an antiunion 
captive audience meeting on pain of 
termination. 
I am sorry it took until 2020 for us to 
get to this point, but at long last we 
are saying captive audience meetings 
have no place in workers’ decisions 
about forming unions. 
There are a lot of other really impor-
tant provisions I want to get to, but at 
this time I want to invite my esteemed 
colleague from the great State of Mas-
sachusetts, 
Representative 
AYANNA 
PRESSLEY, to join in this discussion of 
why it is so important that we pass the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in solidarity with my 
union brothers and sisters in support of 
the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act. 
Over the last few decades, we have 
seen the right to unionize, to ban to-
gether, and to fight for the collective 
rights and dignities of working people 
come under attack. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, 
these rights and protections have led 
to better wages and benefits, safer 
working conditions, and protections 
from workplace harassment and dis-
crimination. 
The hard-won battles of our Nation’s 
unions have helped push back against 
the vast economic inequities that too 
often are fueled by the greed of big cor-
porations and special interests. 
I have witnessed many of these vic-
tories firsthand, from my early days on 
the picket lines with my mother, 
Sandy—may she rest in power—who 
taught me early on that our destinies 
are tied, that workers’ rights are 
human rights, and that economic jus-
tice is workers’ justice. 
This is still true today, and the fight 
continues, from the Stop & Shop work-
ers, who walked out and fought back 
for better healthcare for workers and 
their families, to the Battery Wharf 
Hotel workers, who braved the ele-
ments for 79 days fighting for livable 
wages and protections for immigrant 
workers, pregnant workers, and work-
ers of color. 
We cannot and must not take this 
power for granted. 
But for too many workers, ‘‘right-to- 
work laws’’ and other calculated ef-
forts in States across the country have 
attempted to diminish the power of 
workers. This ends this week as the 
House considers the PRO Act, legisla-
tion that will protect critical rights to 
unionize and protect the rights of 
workers. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive BOBBY SCOTT for his leadership on 
this bill to honor and affirm a union’s 
right to their collective voice. I also 
thank my colleague, my brother from 
Michigan, for organizing this effort. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
supporting this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
PRESSLEY for being such a great cham-
pion for workers in Massachusetts and 
in our whole country. 
Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I want to definitely thank my col-
league from Michigan and also my col-
league from Massachusetts for being 
here to support workers. 
I believe that it is the labor move-
ment that brought us the middle class. 
The height was really after World War 
II, where we saw that wages were going 
up for everyone—the wealthiest, the 
middle class, poor people could get jobs 
that would get them out of poverty— 
and the labor movement, the right of 
workers to organize, made the dif-
ference, to fight together, work to-
gether for better wages and working 
conditions. 
So, today, I rise in enthusiastic sup-
port before the House of Representa-
tives for H.R. 2474, the Protect the 
Right to Organize Act, for a vote that 
is going to take place tomorrow in the 
House of Representatives. 
The right to form a union, which has 
been eroded over the last several dec-
ades, and the right to take collective 
action in the workplace and the right 
to exercise one’s First Amendment 
rights in the form of secondary boy-
cotts are fundamental, and it is past 
time that we as Americans promote 
their values. 
For too long, employers have been 
able to violate the National Labor Re-
lations Act with impunity, routinely 
denying workers their basic right to 
join with coworkers for fairness on the 
job. As a result, the collective strength 
of workers to negotiate for better pay 
and for better benefits has eroded, and 
income inequality in the United States 
of America has reached levels that pre-
date the Great Depression. 
What is worse is that this is a rather 
predictable outcome. It is not sur-
prising if workers don’t have the right 
to organize that their wages are not 
going to go up. 
But I want to share a story. It is a 
story of a woman named Yiran Zhang. 
She is a graduate worker at Loyola 
College in my district, in Chicago, Loy-
ola Chicago. 
Yiran Zhang’s parents raised their 
child to be a believer that education 
was the path to a better life. They 
moved to the United States from China 
when she was almost 2 years old. So 
she has grown up here. Her parents 
moved to the United States to earn 
their Ph.D.’s and work as graduate 
workers.

Years later, Yiran decided to follow 
in her parents’ footsteps by pursuing a 
Ph.D. The philosophy major quickly 
learned that a lot has changed in the 
world since her parents were graduate 
workers like she is now. 
We’re struggling to make a living. The ex-
pectations are the same, but the conditions 
in higher education are so different. 
The expectations of the job, she 
means, are the same. 
She says: 
As a graduate worker, I’ve had to miss pay-
ing bills, to skip doctor’s appointments, and 
even work two or three additional jobs to 
cover living expenses. I’m fighting for a 
union because I know it is only by standing 
together with my colleagues that we can 
change any of this. 
So Yiran and other Loyola graduate 
workers came together to form a union 
to make improvements in the school’s 
administration. They found that the 
administration 
actually 
dismissed 
them and used the legal system to 
fight their efforts. 
Yiran sees unions as the only way for 
graduate workers to be heard. I actu-
ally stood with them at a demonstra-
tion, and she said: 
I’ve seen that the only way that we’ve been 
able to get our administration to listen is by 
doing sit-ins and walkouts and taking action 
together. Teachers across the country and 
people who work at things like Stop & Shop 
have had the same experience. 
In addition to having a seat at the 
table, Loyola graduate workers are 
fighting for a higher stipend and the 
establishment 
of 
summer 
funding, 
which will give them the ability to do 
important research and writing over 
the summer instead of having to take 
on multiple part-time jobs just to 
make ends meet. They also want more 
professional support, including clear 
grievance 
procedures 
and 
account-
ability. 
So, for young women like Yiran, the 
ability to join and unionize would 
mean that she would be able to truly 
build on the foundations started by her 
parents. She says: 
I am fighting for a living wage, respect for 
my labor, and a better life. I shouldn’t have 
to seek outside work up to 30 hours a week 
on top of my graduate worker hours just to 
make ends meet at the cost of finishing my 
program on time or being the best scholar 
and educator that I can be. Academia 
shouldn’t be just for the privileged. Negoti-
ating a fair contract with graduate workers 
is the first step toward addressing these 
harmful systemic issues. 
I am going to quit. I have taken more 
than my time, I think. But I wanted to 
give you a true-life example of a 
woman who is trying to do her best in 
her job as a student worker, as a grad-
uate worker, and because she can’t or-
ganize, she can’t get the benefits and 
the wages that she deserves. This is 
typical of what is going on in our coun-
try and is creating the income inequal-
ity that we see right now. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative SCHA-
KOWSKY for her words. I am so glad she 
shared that story from Loyola. It re-
minds me of another situation of grad-
uate employees that many of us, our 
colleagues, are working on right now. 
Graduate employees of Harvard, in 
all kinds of labs, in the social sciences 
and in the arts, all the different depart-
ments, formed a union and were recog-
nized something like 18 months ago by 
the Harvard administration, but they 
have never achieved a first contract. 
I think something like over 20 col-
leagues joined me in sending a letter to 
the president of Harvard University, 20- 
some of us who are graduates. I am a 
graduate of Harvard Law School, and 
other people are graduates from the 
law school, undergraduates from Har-
vard University, the Kennedy School, 
doctors, whatever. 
We all sent a letter to President 
Bacow saying we are happy that you 
recognized the union, but unless work-
ers get a first contract, what have they 
really achieved? And we hope that both 
sides will come together and achieve a 
first contract. We continue to watch 
that situation. 
So graduate employees, like others, 
need the freedom and the ability to 
form unions. 
I want to hit on a few other areas 
that the PRO Act deals with, and my 
theme tonight really is what a com-
prehensive jobs bill does in trying to 
fix problems that prevent workers from 
exercising their rights. 
b 1900 
Here is another one. The PRO Act 
will eliminate employers’ ability to 
unilaterally withdraw recognition from 
a union. Now, this is problem created 
more recently. 
On July 3, 2019, the Trump NLRB 
issued a decision in Johnson Controls, 
Incorporated that would allow an em-
ployer to announce that it will with-
draw recognition of a union within a 
90-day timeframe before the expiration 
of a collective bargaining agreement, 
based on its own idea that the union 
has lost majority support. This is just 
such a good example of what has hap-
pened over and over with workers’ 
rights being chipped away at. 
And so the PRO Act would overturn 
this decision and prohibit employers 
from unilaterally withdrawing recogni-
tion of a union, unless there is an elec-
tion to decertify the union; just like 
the workers would have gone through 
an election to create the union in the 
first place. 
Speaking of first contracts, almost 
half the time when workers organize in 
this country, they don’t have a first 
contract within a year or two. And if 
you don’t have a contract by then, you 
are not likely ever to get one. If you 
can’t bargain collectively, what have 
you really accomplished by winning a 
union election? 
So it is really crucial that we have 
first contracts. The PRO Act fixes this 
problem. It basically sets up a system 
of mediation and arbitration to ensure 
workers get a contract. It goes like 
this: Upon a written request from the 
union, they have to commence bar-
gaining in 10 days. 
If, within 90 days, they haven’t 
achieved a first contract, either party 
can request mediation. After 30 days of 
mediation, if there isn’t a first con-
tract, the case will be referred to arbi-
tration; and the arbitration panel must 
be established within 14 days. And 
there are sensible procedures about a 
three-person arbitration panel, fairly 
picked, with each side picking one and 
then agreeing on the third. 
Bottom line here: In 144 days, 71⁄2 
weeks from when the election is de-
cided and the union is certified, there 
will 
be 
arbitration. 
There 
is 
no 
timeline for a decision, but that is rea-
sonable because the arbitrators do this 
as a profession; they know how to do it; 
and I think we can count on them to be 
timely. And the decision of the arbitra-
tors is binding for 2 years. 
So bottom line, if the company 
doesn’t want to negotiate, if the work-
ers are having a hard time getting the 
company to the table, they can go to 
mediation and arbitration, and in 71⁄2 
weeks, they can have an arbitration 
panel hearing their case. It’s a com-
plete sea change from today, and very 
important. 
Another right that workers have 
been denied is the right to collective 
action in the courtroom, to sue their 
employer, to go to court to vindicate 
their rights. 
The NLRA protects workers’ rights 
to engage in concerted activities for 
the purpose of mutual aid and protec-
tion. It is that broad. 
But, on May 21, 2018, the Supreme 
Court held in Epic Systems Corpora-
tion v. Lewis that, despite this explicit 
protection, employers may force work-
ers into signing arbitration agreements 
that waive the right to pursue work 
litigation jointly, collectively, or in a 
class action, despite the specific lan-
guage of the NLRA. 
So, the PRO Act would overturn that 
decision by explicitly stating that em-
ployers may not require employees to 
waive their rights to collective action 
in the courtroom, including class ac-
tion litigation. 
I started organizing unions in 1983, 
and I remember learning about the Ex-
celsior list; the list that employers 
have to provide unions so that they can 
know who the workers are and help 
them organize the union. You can only 
get this list after you have a showing 
of interest required under the act, so 
there is a whole process for this. 
But the lists we got were often gar-
bage. They were wrong. They would 
only have a person’s first name or last 
name. They didn’t have the informa-
tion required. 
So the National Labor Relations 
Board decided in 2014 that there has to 
be certain information in a list, and it 
has to be searchable in electronic for-
mat; very common sense. Employee’s 
full name, their home address, work lo-
cation, shift, job classification and, if 
the employer has it, their land line and

mobile telephone numbers and email 
addresses. 
What is the context here? 
I can tell you from personal experi-
ence, when we talk about workers hav-
ing the right to organize, they don’t 
actually have the right to have access 
to union organizers in their workplace. 
When I was organizing for SEIU, and 
in the 11 years I served as the assistant 
director of organizing at the national 
AFL–CIO, if we were helping workers 
at a facility organize and we walked on 
to that property, the employer would 
arrest us for trespassing. 
Workers in the United States have no 
right to actually have access to unions 
in their workplace; so their only way 
to talk to representatives of the union 
is on the phone, or email, or at their 
homes. So the PRO Act makes clear 
that those lists have to be adequate, 
it’s another thing that may seem 
small; but if we fix it, we are going to 
help a lot more workers exercise their 
rights. 
Another thing that happens very 
often is that employers gerrymander 
the bargaining unit that the National 
Labor Relations Board finds in which 
to hold an election. 
So the PRO Act codifies the National 
Labor Relations Board’s 2011 decision 
in Specialty Healthcare, and prevents 
employers 
from 
doing 
this 
gerry-
mandering; prevents them from includ-
ing individuals in the voting unit who 
have no interest in joining the union, 
but they are simply put there to try to 
pad the ‘‘no’’ vote to prevent the work-
ers from succeeding in forming a union. 
Another thing about union elections 
that are different from any normal 
election in a democracy is the workers 
usually vote in their workplace after 
an intense campaign from their em-
ployer to try to stop them from form-
ing a union. 
So the PRO Act enables the board to 
hold union representation elections 
electronically, through certified mail, 
or off-site, at a neutral location, to en-
sure that the employees can cast their 
ballots in a neutral, non-coercive envi-
ronment. 
It may seem incredibly basic in any 
election, but I am telling you, for the 
last 50 years, all union elections have 
taken place under physical conditions 
of pressure and coercion in an employ-
er’s workplace, almost all of them. 
A related matter that, again, seems 
shocking to many; if you took a civics 
class or any class about government or 
American history and you learned how 
elections are supposed to take place, 
this is a unique aspect. 
In a union election, where it is just 
supposed to be workers deciding wheth-
er or not they want to form a union, 
under our system, the employer has 
been a party to the election. The work-
ers file a petition. The employer is 
deemed a party, and then they get to 
engage in litigation, delay, in order to 
advance their interest, which always is 
to stop their workers from forming a 
union. 
So the PRO Act says no more. We are 
not having outside entities interfering 
with employees’ decisions about wheth-
er to join a union or not join a union. 
It is just up to the workers. 
This would harmonize the NLRB’s 
procedures with those of the National 
Mediation Board under the Railway 
Labor Act, which governs labor rela-
tions for railways and airlines and in 
this area it works much better. 
Another question is: What do you do 
if an employer is found to have system-
atically interfered with the workers’ 
right to form a union? 
What has happened regularly is the 
employer does anything to destroy a 
majority who may have signed cards 
seeking union representation, which 
leads to the election, and to get the 
workers to vote ‘‘no’’ even if a major-
ity of them signed union cards. 
A showing of interest to obtain an 
election for workers doesn’t require a 
majority. It requires, I think, 30 per-
cent. 
But what the PRO Act says is, if a 
majority of people said they wanted to 
have a union, an absolute majority, 
they signed authorization cards, and 
then the employer set about and de-
stroyed the majority through means 
that the National Labor Relations 
Board determined were illegal, the 
NLRB has a remedy that it shall issue 
an order requiring the employer to bar-
gain, taking away the incentive and 
the ability of employers to destroy 
workers’ majorities through illegal ac-
tivities. 
Another area that has been so lack-
ing in our labor laws has to do with 
penalties. And again, if you are a civil 
rights lawyer or activist concerned 
with women’s rights, or the rights of 
religious minorities, or the rights of 
racial minorities, you wouldn’t believe 
this: In all other areas of civil rights 
laws, laws protecting rights of Ameri-
cans, there are various forms of pen-
alties to try to disincentivize violating 
American’s rights; pain and suffering, 
treble damages, different—it depends 
on the statute and the area. 
Here is the way it works under the 
National Labor Relations Act. If I am 
fired for trying to form a union, and 
the employer does it totally on pur-
pose, just to destroy, scare everybody 
else, they succeed in killing the union 
drive, that was their goal; and there is 
litigation, the union backs me up. If, 3 
years later, a judge finds they abso-
lutely fired you for union activity, 
they violated your rights, you are 
right, you get your remedy. The rem-
edy is this: Single back pay minus any-
thing you made in the meantime. It is 
shocking. 
Working people aren’t going to stop 
working in the hopes that someday 
they will be found to have had their 
rights violated. They have to feed their 
family. So employers basically have 
gotten away with violating people’s 
rights, and the penalty has been, often, 
virtually nothing. 
So under the PRO Act, if an em-
ployee has been discharged or suffered 
serious economic harm in violation of 
the act, now the NLRB will award back 
pay, without any reduction, front pay, 
consequential damages, and an addi-
tional amount as liquidated damages 
equal to two times the amount of dam-
ages awarded, which is, essentially, the 
normal 
kind 
of 
punitive 
damages 
awarded in this kind of case, to 
incentivize the employers not to vio-
late the law. 
Also, the workers cannot have their 
relief denied if they are an undocu-
mented worker. 
So let me just mention one other 
area where this law will help workers 
so much; just to vindicate their basic 
right of association and speech in the 
workplace, to come together and form 
a union and bargain collectively. It re-
fers to the same situation I just men-
tioned. 
If they fire you for trying to form a 
union, what happens? 
Their principal motive really isn’t 
about you as an individual. It is about 
the group. They are trying to scare you 
out of forming a union. 
b 1915 
They will fire the ringleaders. They 
will fire one, five, however many peo-
ple they think are necessary to basi-
cally have the workers fear moving for-
ward to vindicate their rights. 
Often in these cases, the courts ulti-
mately may determine 6 months, 1 
year, 5 years later that you were fired 
for union activity, but the union drive 
was killed long ago. It is immediate. It 
was killed within a day or weeks. 
So the PRO Act requires the NLRB 
to seek temporary injunctive relief 
whenever there is reasonable cause to 
believe that an employer unlawfully 
terminated an employee or signifi-
cantly 
interfered 
with 
employees’ 
rights under the NLRA. And the dis-
trict court is directed to grant tem-
porary relief for the duration of the 
NLRB proceedings. 
Essentially, they are saying: I am fir-
ing you because you did something 
wrong on the job. That can be deter-
mined after the election, but we are 
not going to let employers fire workers 
to scare their coworkers out of exer-
cising their rights. 
Madam Speaker, these are just a few 
of the ways that the PRO Act will help 
American workers at long last exercise 
their freedom to form unions and bar-
gain collectively. I am telling you, we 
have passed so much legislation that 
would help American workers and their 
families, the Raise the Wage Act, pro-
tection for people with preexisting con-
ditions, 
lowering 
prescription 
drug 
costs, but there is no bill that comes 
close to this one and the impact it 
could have on American families and 
workers. 
MIT did a study, and it found that 
just under half of nonunion workers 
say they would like to form a union if 
they just had the freedom to do it. Gal-
lup every year studies people’s atti-
tudes toward unions. They have been

doing this the same way for decades. 
They found the highest approval rating 
of unions in decades, yet just 6 percent 
of private-sector workers have unions. 
If workers were free to form unions 
in this country, and not half of all non-
union workers but just a fraction of 
them so we got back up to say a third 
of workers being in unions in this 
country again, our economy would be 
completely transformed because when 
workers form unions it is not just they 
themselves who benefit. Other employ-
ers raise their wages to compete to at-
tract workers or to try to get their 
workers not to form a union. That is 
fine. It benefits all workers in this 
country. It benefits their children and 
their communities. 
It is just an honor to be here to talk 
about the PRO Act. I am really proud 
of being one of Chairman SCOTT’s lieu-
tenants in this effort. Tomorrow, we 
are going to pass this legislation and 
give a leg up to all the working people 
in this country who just want to get 
their little piece of the American 
Dream. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise, with the love of my 
country at heart, and I rise today on 
this day when the Senate has con-
cluded its trial of the President. 
I rise to say that this House can be 
very proud of the job that it has done 
because, notwithstanding all that has 
been said, this House had the courage 
to do what the Constitution required 
pursuant to Article II, Section 4, in 
terms of the standard for finding a 
President guilty. 
The House did what it was supposed 
to do. The House impeached this Presi-
dent, charged this President with two 
Articles of Impeachment. One was the 
obstruction of Congress. I like to think 
of it as an obstruction of a congres-
sional investigation. The other was 
abuse of power. 
The Senate did not find the President 
guilty of either of the Articles of Im-
peachment, but the House still did its 
job because the House has the duty, the 
responsibility, and the obligation to 
move forward, notwithstanding what 
may be the case in the Senate. The 
House doesn’t act based on what the 
Senate is perceived to do or not do. The 
House must act based upon the evi-
dence that is before it. 
And the House did act. And the House 
did impeach. And as a result, regard-
less as to the finding of the Senate, the 
President is impeached forever. And it 
will be forever written in history that 
this President was impeached for high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
Why is this so important? It is im-
portant because notwithstanding the 
finding in the Senate, the President 
knows now that the House has the 
courage to do its job. The House will 
put the guardrails up. The President 
knows that he cannot escape the House 
because this is where the bar of justice 
lies in terms of presenting Articles of 
Impeachment such that they can go to 
the Senate. 
The President has to know now that 
the House is the sword of Damocles. 
For those who may not know, Damo-
cles was a courtier. He was a person 
who would flatter the king, let the 
king believe and tell the king that he 
was great and that all of his subjects 
loved him. The king, on one occasion, 
decided to allow Damocles to occupy 
the throne. But in so doing, he wanted 
Damocles to understand that occu-
pying the throne carries with it more 
than the accolades and all of the kind 
words that were being said. 
So he had a sword hung above Damo-
cles by a single hair from a horse’s tail. 
As Damocles sat there, he understood 
that, at any moment, the sword might 
fall upon him and do him great harm. 
To some extent, he was proud and 
pleased to occupy the throne, but the 
reality was he realized that it was not 
the easy occupation that he thought it 
to be. So he begged the king to release 
him and allow him to remove himself 
from under the sword that was hanging 
over him. 
The House is the sword of Damocles. 
We hang there above the President so 
that he will know that if he commits 
impeachable acts that the House will 
act. 
Now, I understand that there will be 
those who will say that the Senate 
acted and found the President not 
guilty. Yes, ‘‘not guilty,’’ not ‘‘inno-
cent.’’ The Senate did not proclaim the 
President innocent. They simply said 
he is not guilty—a lot of difference be-
tween not guilty and innocent. 
To be innocent means you have been 
found to have done absolutely nothing 
wrong, you are totally without blame, 
and you are a person who can claim 
that you have done absolutely nothing 
wrong without any blame at all. Well, 
‘‘not guilty’’ simply means that the 
evidence presented, as they reviewed it, 
they did not conclude that the Presi-
dent could be found guilty. So he was 
found not guilty, but he was not pro-
claimed innocent by the Senate. 
And the Senate cannot proclaim that 
a President who has been found not 
guilty cannot be impeached again. The 
Senate deals with the question of a 
trial, and there is some question as to 
whether or not this was an appropriate 
trial pursuant to the Constitution. But 
the Senate deals with the trial. It is 
the House that deals with impeach-
ment. 
As such, the House found that the 
President should have been impeached, 
did impeach, but also, the law under 
the Constitution allows the House to 
impeach again if the President is found 
to have engaged in impeachable of-
fenses. The House is not allowed simply 
one opportunity to impeach a reckless, 
ruthless, lawless President. The House 
can impeach each and every time the 
President commits an impeachable act. 
And if the President has committed an 
impeachable act, the House can im-
peach. 
There will be those who will say that 
we are now calling for impeachment 
again. This is not true. I will make it 
perspicuously clear: Not the case. Not 
calling for impeachment at this time, 
but indicating that the rules, pursuant 
to the Constitution, allow for impeach-
ment at any time the President com-
mits acts that are impeachable. 
Madam Speaker, I must say if the 
President does commit another im-
peachable act, I believe that this House 
will uphold its responsibility, its duty, 
and its obligation, as it has done. 
I am proud to be associated with the 
House and what it has done because I 
am proud to say we have upheld the 
Constitution. This is what we were re-
quired to do, to uphold the Constitu-
tion of the United States of America 
and not allow a President to simply do 
as he would without any restrictions 
on him. I understand that the Presi-
dent has decided that, as the executive, 
he can dictate the rules for a trial, the 
rules for impeachment, but the House 
did not allow him to do so, such that it 
would retreat from its responsibility. 
The House has said: Mr. President, 
there are guardrails, and these guard-
rails we will not allow you to simply 
ignore. The guardrails are such that 
you will have to conform to the Con-
stitution. 
I believe that what the Senate has 
done has not benefited the country, but 
I also know that what the House has 
done was send a message that the 
President is not beyond reproach, that 
the House of Representatives still 
stands here as a sentinel on duty to as-
sure this country that if the President 
steps out of line and does something 
that is impeachable, the House will in-
deed act upon what the President may 
have done. 
I believe in the separation of powers. 
I believe that the executive branch has 
certain powers. I believe that the judi-
cial branch has certain powers and that 
the legislative branch has certain pow-
ers. But I know that only the House 
has the power to impeach. 
And I know that the President can-
not withhold witnesses, cannot with-
hold evidence from the House such that 
it cannot move forward with the proper 
investigation. I know that he cannot 
do this with impunity. He can’t do it 
with immunity of some sort. He is not 
immune, and the House has dem-
onstrated this, that he is not immune. 
Notwithstanding 
his 
behavior, 
the 
House can still move forward with its 
duty and responsibility as it did and 
impeach. 
It is also now clear that the House 
does not have to find out a crime has 
been committed, in the sense of a stat-
utory, codified offense. There does not

February 5, 2020 
have to be a crime that has been de-
fined in law such that it is penally pun-
ished. Not so. The Constitution doesn’t 
require it. 
In fact, Andrew Johnson was im-
peached in 1868 for offenses that were 
not crimes, in the sense that they were 
something defined by statute, some-
thing that has already been codified. It 
wasn’t required then; it isn’t required 
now. 
Andrew Johnson was impeached on 
Article X of the articles against him 
for acts rooted in his bigotry and his 
hatred. He was impeached, and the root 
of it was he did not want the freed 
slaves to enjoy the same rights as 
other people in this country. He fought 
the Freedmen’s Bureau. He did every-
thing that he could to prevent them 
from having the same rights as others 
in this country. The radical Repub-
licans impeached Andrew Johnson in 
1868 for having utterances and state-
ments that were harmful. He demeaned 
the House of Representatives. But it 
was all rooted in his hate and racism, 
and as a result, no crime, but he was 
impeached. 
b 1930 
We now know that this can be done. 
And this President has done some 
things that are dreadful, some things 
that I would not want to see a Presi-
dent do and that, in my opinion, are in 
violation of the Constitution. 
You don’t have to commit a statu-
tory offense to be found guilty of a 
high crime and misdemeanor. We know 
this now. 
When we first started this journey, 
we had to fight this battle to convince 
people, and people have finally been 
convinced. There are some outliers who 
will contend that you have to commit 
a crime in the sense that it is defined 
and codified as a statute, but this is 
not the case. All of the leading scholars 
agree with the comments that I am 
sharing with you tonight. 
So we know now that, if the Presi-
dent inculcates bigotry into his poli-
cies, he can be impeached. For bigotry 
in policies emanating from the Presi-
dency, he can be impeached. 
We don’t have to have bigoted poli-
cies emanating from the President. We 
don’t have to have this. There is no re-
quirement in this country that we 
must suffer a President who presents 
bigotry into public discourse. There is 
no requirement. 
We have an obligation in this coun-
try to defend all people. All of the peo-
ple in this country should have equal 
protection under the law. We can’t 
allow anyone in this country to present 
circumstances or cause circumstances 
to come into existence that may cause 
harm to people. 
When you say ugly things about peo-
ple and you tell police officers that you 
don’t have to be nice when you are ar-
resting a person, you are inviting harm 
to be caused to a certain person who 
may be arrested. 
Anybody who is arrested should still 
be treated as a human being with cer-
tain dignity and respect simply be-
cause that certain person is in the 
care, custody, and control of the au-
thorities. The authorities have a duty 
to respect the people that they arrest. 
Well, you don’t invite persons to be-
have otherwise, which is something 
this President has done. 
So I want the persons within the 
sound of my voice to know that I am 
proud of what the House has done. The 
President now knows that he can be 
impeached, that we are the sword of 
Damocles. The House has a duty and 
responsibility to do what it did, and it 
can do it again if the President com-
mits additional impeachable acts. 
The President has said he could go 
out on Fifth Avenue and shoot some-
one and do it with immunity. 
He didn’t use those exact words. 
Well, if he does, using his phrase-
ology of going out and doing this das-
tardly deed, he will be impeached. We 
will not allow a President to do such a 
thing. 
And I, quite frankly, think it is inap-
propriate for him to joke about such a 
thing. I say it only because I want peo-
ple to know that I take seriously the 
possibility 
of 
the 
President 
doing 
something else, not going out on Fifth 
Avenue, but doing something else. 
The President has demonstrated that 
he is a recidivist, and he will engage in 
recidivism; and when he does engage in 
recidivism, we have a responsibility to 
the Constitution to impeach him for 
his misdeeds. 
Finally, this: I love this country. It 
means something to me to be a citizen 
of this country. I respect the oppor-
tunity that I have to be a part of this 
Congress. 
I don’t want it said that, on my 
watch, when we had a reckless, ruth-
less President, I failed to live up to my 
responsibilities. I want it said that, 
though I may have had to stand alone 
at some point, it is better to stand 
alone than not stand at all. 
I want it said that I recognize the 
fact that, if you tolerate bigotry, you 
perpetuate it. And I want it said that I 
did not tolerate it, and that I did all 
that I could to bring a President who 
engaged in bigotry and racism and 
Islamophobia, 
homophobia, 
xeno-
phobia, nativism, all of the invidious 
phobias, anti-Semitism, that I did all 
that I could to bring him to the bar of 
justice in the House of Representa-
tives. 
But I also would want the record to 
show that I said tonight that I will do 
all that I can, if he engages again, to 
bring him before the bar of justice, and 
that certain offenses that he has com-
mitted have not been brought to the 
bar of justice and that it is never too 
late, as long as he is in office, to bring 
the President before the bar of justice. 
This is where it all starts, right here 
in the House of Representatives. 
I am so proud of my colleagues who 
voted to impeach this President. The 
House can be proud of what it has done. 
The President knows that here there 
is courage and there is the courage to 
bring him to justice. He will forever be 
an impeached President. 
He may have been found not guilty, 
but the impeachment is not eradicated, 
it is not obliterated, it is not elimi-
nated by virtue of the fact that the 
Senate chose not to find the President 
guilty. 
I happen to absolutely, totally, and 
completely disagree with the Senate 
and its findings. I think the Senate 
made the wrong decision, but it made a 
decision, and that decision will stand. 
But I also know that that decision 
can be appealed. The decision of the 
Senate can be appealed, and it will be 
appealed to a higher court, the court 
that will convene in November. I be-
lieve that that court will have a dif-
ferent finding in November of this 
year. 
I love my country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I move that the House do now ad-

House 
adjourned 
until

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO 
LEGISLATION 
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As- 
You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO), Mr. YAR-
MUTH hereby submits, prior to the vote 
on passage, for printing in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 3830, the 
Taxpayers 
Right-To-Know 
Act, 
as 
amended, would have no significant ef-
fect on the deficit, and therefore, the 
budgetary effects of such bill are esti-
mated as zero.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2020 
No. 24 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Strong Deliverer, our shelter in the 
time of storms, we acknowledge today 
that You are God and we are not. You 
don’t disappoint those who trust in 
You, for You are our fortress and bul-
wark. 
Lord, show our Senators Your ways 
and teach them to walk in Your path of 
integrity. 
Through the seasons of our Nation’s 
history, You have been patient and 
merciful. Mighty God, be true to Your 
name. Fulfill Your purposes for our Na-
tion and world. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Under the previous order, 
the leadership time is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent to speak for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Last night, in the 
State of the Union Address, President 
Trump called on Congress to put bipar-
tisan legislation to lower prescription 
drug prices on his desk and that he 
would sign it. 
Here are the facts. The House is con-
trolled by Democrats. The Senate re-
quires bipartisanship to get any legis-
lating done. There are only a couple of 
months left before the campaign season 
will likely impede anything from being 
accomplished in this Congress. So the 
time to act is right now. 
I am calling on my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to get off the 
sidelines and to work with me and Sen-
ator WYDEN, as President Trump al-
ready is, to heed the call to action that 
he gave us last night and pass the Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. 
It is the only significant bipartisan bill 
in town. President Trump, the AARP, 
and the libertarian Cato think tank, to 
name just a few people involved, have 
all endorsed the bill. 
If you are serious about fulfilling 
promises to lower drug costs, my office 
door is open, as Senator WYDEN’s door 
is open. It is time for the Senate to act 
and to deliver for the American people. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Oregon. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, as 
Senators, our decisions build the foun-
dation for future generations. I want 
those generations to know that I stood 
here on the floor of this Chamber fight-
ing for equal justice under law. I stood 
here to defend our Senate’s responsi-
bility to provide a fair trial with wit-
nesses and documents. I stood here to 
say that when our President invites 
and pressures a foreign government to 
smear a political opponent and corrupt 
the integrity of our 2020 Presidential 
election, he must be removed from of-
fice. 
As a number of my Republican col-
leagues have confessed, the House man-
agers have proven their case. President 
Trump did sanction a corrupt con-
spiracy to smear a political opponent, 
former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden. 
President 
Trump 
assigned 
Rudy 
Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to ac-
complish that goal by arranging sham 
investigations by the Government of 
Ukraine. President Trump advanced 
his corrupt scheme by instructing the 
three 
amigos—Ambassador 
Volker, 
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and 
Ambassador Gordon Sondland—to work 
with Rudy for this goal. President 
Trump did use the resources of Amer-
ica, including an Oval Office meeting 
and security assistance to pressure 
Ukraine, which was at war with Russia, 
to participate in this corrupt con-
spiracy. The facts are clear. 
But do President Trump’s acts rise to 
the level the Framers envisioned for 
removal of a President, or are they, as 
some colleagues in this Chamber have 
said, simply ‘‘inappropriate,’’ but not 
‘‘impeachable’’? With respect to those 
colleagues, ‘‘inappropriate’’ is lying to 
the public; ‘‘inappropriate’’ is shunning 
our allies or failing to put your per-
sonal assets into a blind trust or en-
couraging foreign governments to pa-
tronize your properties. That is some-
thing you might call ‘‘inappropriate,’’ 
but that word does not begin to encom-
pass President Trump’s actions in this 
case—a corrupt conspiracy comprising 
a fundamental assault on our Constitu-
tion. 
This conspiracy is far worse than Wa-
tergate. Watergate was about a break- 
in to spy on the Democratic National 
Committee—bad, 
yes; 
wrong, 
defi-
nitely. But Watergate didn’t involve 
soliciting foreign interference to de-
stroy the integrity of an election. It 
didn’t involve an effort to smear a po-
litical opponent. Watergate did not in-
volve an across-the-board blockade of 
access by Congress to witnesses and 
documents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S872 
February 5, 2020 
If you believe that Congress was 
right to conclude that President Nix-
on’s abuse of power merited expulsion 
from office, you have no choice but to 
conclude that President Trump’s cor-
rupt conspiracy merits his expulsion 
from office. 
President Trump should be removed 
from office this very day by action in 
this very Chamber, but he will not be 
removed because this Senate has failed 
to conduct a full and fair trial to reveal 
the extensive dimensions of his con-
spiracy and because the siren call to 
party loyalty over country has infected 
this Chamber. 
Every American understands what 
constitutes a full and fair trial. A full 
and fair trial has witnesses. A full and 
fair trial has documents. A full and fair 
trial does not begin with the jury fore-
man declaring that he is working hand- 
in-glove with the defendant. When dis-
cussing why the Senate tries impeach-
ments, 
Alexander 
Hamilton 
stated: 
‘‘Where else than in the Senate could 
have been found a tribunal sufficiently 
dignified, or sufficiently independent’’ 
for that daunting responsibility? 
Every American should feel the sad-
ness, the darkness, the tragedy of this 
moment in which this Senate is neither 
sufficiently dignified nor sufficiently 
independent for that responsibility. 
The Senate trial became a coverup 
when the majority voted on January 22 
and again on January 31 to block all 
access to witnesses and documents. If 
this coverup goes forward, it will be 
the latest in a set of corrupt firsts this 
Senate has achieved under Republican 
leadership. 
It has been the first Senate to ignore 
our constitutional responsibilities to 
debate and vote on a Supreme Court 
nominee in 2016. It became the first 
Senate to complete the theft of a Su-
preme Court seat from one administra-
tion giving it to another in 2017. 
And now, it becomes the first Senate 
in American history to replace an im-
peachment trial with a coverup. Presi-
dent Trump might want to consider 
this: With a coverup in lieu of a trial, 
there is no ‘‘exoneration,’’ no matter 
how badly President Trump might 
want it. No matter how boldly he 
might claim it, there is no ‘‘exonera-
tion’’ from a coverup. 
If this Senate fails to convict Presi-
dent Trump when we vote later today, 
we destroy our constitutional responsi-
bility to serve as a check against the 
abuses of a runaway President. It is a 
devastating blow to the checks and bal-
ances which have stood at the heart of 
our Constitution. 
Our tripartite system is like a three- 
legged stool, where each leg works in 
balance with the others. If one leg is 
cracked or weakened, well, that stool 
topples over. If the Senate’s responsi-
bility is gutted and the limits on Presi-
dential power are undermined, then, 
there is lasting damage to the checks 
and balances our Founders so carefully 
crafted. 
Let’s also be clear. The situation 
that we find ourselves in today didn’t 
spring out of nowhere. With respect to 
the Chief Justice, the road to this mo-
ment has been paved by decisions made 
in the Supreme Court undermining the 
‘‘We the People’’ Republic, while Jus-
tice Roberts has led the Court—deci-
sions like Citizens United in 2010, 
which corrupted our political cam-
paigns with a flood of dark money, the 
equivalent of a stadium sound system 
drowning out the voice of the people; 
decisions like Shelby County in 2013, 
which gutted the Voting Rights Act, 
opening the door to voter suppression 
and voter intimidation—if you believe 
in our Republic, you believe in voter 
empowerment, not voter supression— 
decisions like Rucho V. Common Cause 
in 2019, giving the green light to ex-
treme 
partisan 
gerrymandering, 
in 
which politicians choose their voters 
rather than voters choosing their poli-
ticians. It is one blow after another 
giving more power to the powerful and 
undermining the vision of government 
of, by, and for the people—blow after 
blow making officials more responsive 
to the rich and wealthy donors than 
the people they are elected to rep-
resent. 
These Supreme Court decisions have 
elevated government by and for the 
powerful, and trampled government by 
and for the people, paving the path for 
this dark moment in which the U.S. 
Senate chooses to defend a corrupt 
President by converting a trial into a 
coverup. A trial without access to wit-
nesses and documents is what one ex-
pects of a corrupted court in Russia or 
China, not the United States of Amer-
ica. 
We know what democracy looks like, 
and it is not just about having the Con-
stitution or holding elections. Our de-
mocracy is not set in stone. It is not 
guaranteed by anything other than the 
good will and good faith of the people 
of this country. Keeping a democracy 
takes courage and commitment. As the 
saying goes, ‘‘freedom isn’t free.’’ It is 
an inheritance bequeathed to us by 
those who have fought and bled and 
died to ensure that government ‘‘of the 
people, by the people, for the people 
shall not perish from the Earth.’’ 
Fighting for that inheritance doesn’t 
only happen on the battlefield. It hap-
pens when Americans everywhere go to 
the polls to cast a ballot. It happens 
when ordinary citizens, distraught at 
what they are seeing, speak up, join a 
march, or run for office to make a dif-
ference. And it happens here in this 
Chamber—in this Senate Chamber— 
when Senators put addressing the chal-
lenges of our country over the pres-
sures from their party. 
Before casting their votes today, I 
urge each and every one of my col-
leagues to ask themselves: Will you de-
fend the integrity of our elections? 
Will you deliver impartial justice? Will 
you protect the separation of powers— 
the heart of our Constitution? Will you 
uphold the rule of law and the inspiring 
words carved above the doors of our 
Supreme Court, ‘‘Equal Justice Under 
Law’’? 
I stand here today in support of our 
Constitution, which has made our Na-
tion that shining city on a hill. I stand 
here today for equal justice under law. 
I stand here today for a full and fair 
trial as our Constitution demands. I 
stand here today to say that a Presi-
dent who has abused this office by so-
liciting a foreign country to intervene 
in the election of 2020 and bias the out-
come—betraying the trust of the Amer-
ican 
people 
and 
undermining 
the 
strength of our Constitution—must be 
removed from office. 
I yield the floor.

STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
will speak later this afternoon, at 
about 3:30—prior to the vote on the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment—about impeach-
ment, but this morning, I would like to 
briefly respond to President Trump’s 
third State of the Union Address. It 
was a sad moment for democracy. 
The President’s speech last night was 
much more like a Trump rally than a 
speech a true leader would give. It was 
demagogic, undignified, highly par-
tisan, and, in too many places, just un-
truthful. Instead of a dignified Presi-
dent, we had some combination of a 
pep rally leader, a reality show host, 
and a carnival barker. That is not what 
Presidents are. 
President Trump took credit for in-
heriting an economy that has been 
growing at about the same pace over 
the last 10 years. The bottom line is, 
during the last 3 years of the Obama 
administration, more jobs were created 
than under these 3 years of the Trump 
administration. Yet he can’t resist 
digging at the past President even 
though the past President’s economic 
number was better than his. 
He boasted about how many manu-
facturing jobs he has created. Manufac-
turing jobs have gone down, in part, be-
cause of the President’s trade policies 
for 5 months late last year. There was 
a 5-month-long recession last year. 
Farmers are struggling mightily. Farm 
income is way down. Bankruptcies are 
the highest they have been in 8 years. 
Crop prices are dwindling, and markets 
may never recover from the damage of 
the President’s trade war as so many 
contracts for soybeans and other goods 
have gone to Argentina and Brazil. 
These are not 1-year contracts; these 
are long-term contracts. 
The President talked at length about 
healthcare and claimed—amazingly at 
one point—he will fight to protect pa-
tients with preexisting conditions. This 
President just lies—just lies. He is in 
court right now, trying to undo the 
protections for preexisting conditions. 
At the same time, he says he wants to 
do it, and all the Republicans get up

and cheer. His administration is work-
ing as hard as it can to take down the 
law that guarantees protections for 
preexisting conditions. The claim is 
not partly true; it is not half true; it is 
not misleading. It is flatly, objectively, 
unequivocally false. It reads on my 
notes ‘‘false.’’ Let’s call it for what it 
is—it is a lie. 
In 3 years, President Trump has done 
everything imaginable to undermine 
Americans’ healthcare. He is even hop-
ing to drag out the resolution of the 
lawsuit past the next election. If Presi-
dent Trump were truly interested in 
shoring up protections for people with 
preexisting conditions, he would drop 
this lawsuit now. Then he would be 
doing something, not just talking and 
having his actions totally contradict 
his words. Until the President drops his 
lawsuit, when he says he cares about 
Americans’ healthcare, he is talking 
out of both sides of his mouth. 
When he talks about being the blue- 
collar President, he doesn’t understand 
blue-collar families. It is true that 
wages went up 3 percent. If you are 
making $50,000 a year, that is a good 
salary. By my calculation, that is 
about $30 a week. When you get a med-
ical bill of $4,000 and your deductible is 
$5,000, when your car has an accident 
and it is going to cost you $3,000 or 
$4,000 to fix it and you don’t have that 
money, the $30 a week doesn’t mean 
much. 
When asked, ‘‘Is it easier for you to 
pay your bills today or the day Trump 
became President?’’ they say it is hard-
er to pay their bills today. That is 
what working families care about, get-
ting their costs down—their college 
costs, 
their 
education costs, their 
healthcare costs, their automobile and 
infrastructure 
costs—not 
these 
vaunted Wall Street statistics that the 
financial leaders look at and think: Oh, 
we are great. 
They are great. Their 3-percent in-
crease in income—and it has been 
greater—puts a lot of money in their 
pockets. Working people don’t feel any 
better—they feel worse—because Don-
ald Trump always sides with the spe-
cial interests when it comes to things 
that 
affect 
working 
families, 
like 
health care, like drug costs, like col-
lege. 
In so many other areas, the Presi-
dent’s claims were just not true. He 
claimed he has gotten tough on China. 
He sold out to China a month ago. Ev-
eryone knows that. Because he has 
hurt the farmers so badly, the bulk of 
what happened in the Chinese agree-
ment was for them to purchase some 
soybeans. We don’t even know if that 
will happen, but it didn’t get at the 
real ways China hurts us. 
He spoke about the desire for a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill. We Senate 
Democrats put together a $1 trillion 
bill 3 years ago, and the President 
hasn’t shown any interest in discussing 
it. In fact, when Speaker PELOSI and I 
went to visit him about infrastructure, 
he walked out. 
This is typical of Donald Trump. In 
his speech, he bragged about all of 
these things he wants to do or is doing, 
but his actions belie his words. Maybe 
the best metaphor was his claim to 
bring democracy to Venezuela. There 
was a big policy there. It flopped. If the 
policy were working, Juan Guaido 
wouldn’t have been in the balcony 
here. He would have been in Venezuela. 
He would have been sitting in the 
President’s palace or at least have been 
waging a fight to win. He was here— 
and the President brags about his Ven-
ezuela policy? Give us a break. 
He hasn’t brought an end to the 
Maduro regime. The Maduro regime is 
more powerful today and more en-
trenched today than it was when the 
President 
began 
his 
anti-Maduro 
fight—the 
same 
thing 
with 
North 
Korea, the same thing with China, the 
same thing with Russia, the same 
thing with Syria. 
The fact is, when President Trump 
gets over an hour to speak, the number 
of mistruths, mischaracterizations, ex-
aggerations, 
and 
contradictions 
is 
breathtaking. 
No 
other 
President 
comes close. The old expression says: 
‘‘Watch what I do, not what I say.’’ 
What the President does will be re-
vealed on Monday in his budget. That 
is what he wants to do. If past is pro-
logue, almost everything in that budg-
et will contradict what he will have 
said in his speech. In the past, he has 
cut money for healthcare, cut money 
for medical research, cut money for in-
frastructure, cut money for education, 
cut money to help kids with college— 
every one of those things. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I have faith in 
the American people. They will not be 
fooled. They are used to it. They can 
tell a little show here—a nonreality 
show—when they see one. They know it 
is a show. It is done for their amuse-
ment, for their titillation, but it 
doesn’t improve America. Working peo-
ple are not happy. The middle class is 
struggling to stay in the middle class, 
and those struggling to get to the mid-
dle class find it harder to get there. 
Their path is steeper. 
Far 
more 
than 
the 
President’s 
speech, the President’s budget is what 
truly reveals his priorities. The budget 
will be the truth serum, and in a few 
days, the American people will see how 
many of the President’s words here are 
reality. I expect very few will be. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over 
the last months, our country has been 
consumed by a single word, one that we 
don’t use often in our ordinary par-
lance. That word, of course, is ‘‘im-
peachment.’’ It has filled our news 
channels, our Twitter feeds, and dinner 
conversations. It has led to a wide- 
ranging debate on everything from the 
constitutional doctrines of the separa-
tion of powers to the due process of 
law—two concepts which are the most 
fundamental building blocks of who we 
are as a nation. It has even prompted 
those who typically have no interest in 
politics to tune into C–SPAN or into 
their favorite cable news channels. 
The impeachment of a President of 
the United States is simply the gravest 
undertaking we can pursue in this 
country. It is the nuclear option in our 
Constitution—the choice of last re-
sort—when a President has committed 
a crime so serious that Congress must 
act rather than leave the choice to the 
voters in the election. 
The Framers of the Constitution 
granted this awesome power to the 
U.S. Congress and placed their con-
fidence in the Senate to use only when 
absolutely necessary, when there is no 
other choice. 
This is a rare, historic moment for 
the Members of this Chamber. This has 
been faced by the Senate only on two 
previous occasions during our Con-
stitution’s 232-year history—only two 
times previously. We should be extraor-
dinarily vigilant in ensuring that the 
impeachment power does not become a 
regular feature of our differences and, 
in the process, cheapen the vote of the 
American people. Soon, Members of the 
Senate will determine whether, for the 
first time in our history, a President 
will be removed from office, and then 
we will decide whether he will be 
barred from the ballot in 2020. 
The question all Senators have to an-
swer is, Did the President commit, in 
the words of the Constitution, a high 
crime and misdemeanor that warrants 
his removal from office or should he be 
acquitted of the charges made by the 
House? 
I did my best to listen intently to 
both sides as they presented their cases 
during the trial, and I am confident in 
saying that President Trump should be 
acquitted and not removed from office. 
First, the Constitution gives the Con-
gress the power to impeach and remove 
a President from office only for trea-
son, bribery, and other high crimes and 
misdemeanors, but the two Articles of 
Impeachment passed by the House of 
Representatives 
fail 
to 
meet 
that 
standard. 
The first charge, as we know, is 
abuse of power. House Democrats al-
leged that the President withheld mili-
tary aid from Ukraine in exchange for 
investigations 
of 
Joe 
and 
Hunter

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

February 5, 2020 
Biden. But they failed to bring forward 
compelling and unassailable evidence 
of any crime—again, the Constitution 
talks about treason, bribery, or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors; clear-
ly, 
a 
criminal 
standard—and 
thus 
failed to meet their burden of proof. 
Certainly, the House managers did not 
meet the high burden required to re-
move the President from office, effec-
tively nullifying the will of tens of mil-
lions of Americans just months before 
the next election. What is more, the 
House’s vague charge in the first arti-
cle is equivalent to acts considered and 
rejected by the Framers of our Con-
stitution. 
That brings us to the second article 
we 
are 
considering—obstruction 
of 
Congress. During the House inquiry, 
Democrats were upset because some of 
the President’s closest advisers—and 
their most sought-after witnesses—did 
not testify. To be clear, some of the ex-
ecutive branch witnesses were among 
the 13 witnesses whose testimony we 
did hear during the Senate trial. But 
for those witnesses for whom it was 
clear the administration would claim a 
privilege, almost certainly leading to a 
long court battle, the House declined 
to issue the subpoenas and certainly 
did not seek judicial enforcement. 
Rather than addressing the privilege 
claims in court, as happened in the 
Nixon and Clinton impeachments, the 
Democratic managers moved to im-
peach President Trump for obstruction 
of Congress for protecting the Presi-
dency itself from a partisan abuse of 
power by the House. 
Removing the President from office 
for asserting long-recognized and con-
stitutionally grounded privileges that 
have been invoked by both Republican 
and Democratic Presidents would set a 
very dangerous precedent and would do 
violence to the Constitution’s separa-
tion of powers design. In effect, it 
would make the Presidency itself sub-
servient to Congress. 
The 
father 
of 
our 
Constitution, 
James Madison, warned against allow-
ing the impeachment power to create a 
Presidential tenure at the pleasure of 
the Senate. 
Even more concerning, at every turn 
throughout this process, the House 
Democrats violated President Trump’s 
right to due process of law. All Amer-
ican law is built on a constitutional 
foundation securing basic rights and 
rules of fairness for a citizen accused of 
wrongdoing. 
It is undisputed that the House ex-
cluded the President’s legal team from 
both the closed-door testimony and al-
most the entirety of the House’s 78-day 
inquiry. They channeled personal, pol-
icy, and political grievances and at-
tempted to use the most solemn re-
sponsibility of Congress to bring down 
a political rival in a partisan process. 
It is no secret that Democrats’ cru-
sade to remove the President began 
more than 3 years ago on the very day 
he was inaugurated. On January 20, 
2017, the Washington Post ran a story 
with the headline ‘‘The campaign to 
impeach President Trump has begun.’’ 
At first, Speaker PELOSI wisely re-
sisted. Less than a year ago, she said, 
‘‘Impeachment is so divisive to the 
country that unless there is something 
so compelling and overwhelming and 
bipartisan, I don’t think we should go 
down that path because it divides the 
country.’’ And she was right. But when 
she couldn’t hold back the stampede of 
her caucus, she did a 180-degree about- 
face. She encouraged House Democrats 
to rush through an impeachment in-
quiry before an arbitrary Christmas 
deadline. 
In the end, the articles passed with 
support from only a single party—not 
bipartisan. 
The 
bipartisanship 
the 
Speaker claimed was necessary was ac-
tually opposed to the impeachment of 
the President; that is, Democrats and 
Republicans voted in opposition to the 
Articles of Impeachment. Only Demo-
crats voted for the Articles of Impeach-
ment in the House. 
Once the articles finally made it to 
the Senate after a confusing, 28-day 
delay, Speaker PELOSI tried to have 
Senator 
SCHUMER—the 
Democratic 
leader 
here—use 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s 
playbook, and he staged a number of 
political votes every Member of the 
Senate knew would fail, just so he 
could secure some perceived political 
advantage against Republican Senators 
in the 2020 election. 
What should be a solemn, constitu-
tional undertaking became partisan 
guerilla warfare to take down Presi-
dent Trump and make Senator SCHU-
MER the next majority leader of the 
U.S. Senate. 
All of this was done on the eve of an 
election and just days shy of the first 
primary in Iowa. 
Well, to say the timing was a coinci-
dence would be laughable. This par-
tisan impeachment process could not 
only remove the President from office, 
it would also potentially prevent his 
name from appearing on the ballot in 
November. We are only 9 months away 
from an election—9 months away from 
the American people voting on the di-
rection of our country—but our Demo-
cratic colleagues don’t trust the Amer-
ican people, so they have taken mat-
ters into their own hands. 
This politically motivated impeach-
ment sets a dangerous precedent. This 
is a very important point. This is not 
just about President Trump; this is 
about the Office of the Presidency and 
what precedent a conviction and re-
moval would set for our Constitution 
and for our future. If successful, this 
would give a green light to future Con-
gresses to weaponize impeachment to 
defeat a political opponent for any ac-
tion—even a failure to kowtow to 
Congress’s wishes. 
Impeachment is a profoundly serious 
matter that must be handled as such. 
It cannot become the Hail Mary pass of 
a party to remove a President, effec-
tively nullifying an election and inter-
fering in the next. 
I believe—I think we should all be-
lieve—that the results of the next elec-
tion should be decided by the American 
people, not by Congress. 
The decision to remove a President 
from office requires undeniable evi-
dence of a high crime. That is the lan-
guage chosen by the Framers of our 
Constitution. But despite our col-
leagues’ best attempts, the facts they 
presented simply don’t add up to that 
standard. 
House managers failed to meet their 
heavy burden of proof that President 
Trump, beyond a reasonable doubt, 
committed a crime, let alone a high 
crime; therefore, I will not vote to con-
vict the President. 
I hope our Democratic colleagues 
will finally accept the result of this 
trial—just as they have not accepted 
the result of the 2016 election—and I 
hope they won’t take the advice of 
Congresswoman 
WATERS, 
MAXINE 
WATERS in the House, and open a sec-
ond impeachment inquiry. It is time 
for our country to come together to 
heal the wounds that divide us and to 
get the people’s work done. 
There is no doubt, as Speaker PELOSI 
observed in March of 2019, that im-
peachment is a source of division in 
our country, and it is also a period of 
great sadness. If this partisan impeach-
ment were to succeed, my greatest fear 
is it would become a routine process 
for every President who serves with a 
House majority of the opposite party, 
and we would find ourselves in a recur-
ring impeachment nightmare every 
time we elect a new President. 
Our country is deeply divided and 
damaged by this partisan impeachment 
process. It is time for us to bring it to 
a close and to let the wounds from this 
unnecessary and misguided episode 
heal. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD—IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL OF DONALD JOHN TRUMP 
SENATOR JOHN CORNYN OF TEXAS 
Mr. President, I would like to submit this 
statement for the record regarding the im-
peachment trial of President Donald Trump. 
This statement seeks to supplement the re-
marks that I made on the Senate floor on 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020. It includes 
some of my observations as a former judge 
on some of the complicated constitutional, 
legal, and factual issues associated with this 
impeachment proceeding and its implica-
tions for future presidential impeachments. 
(1) What is the Constitutional standard? 
In America, all government derives its 
power, in the words of the Declaration of 
Independence, ‘‘from the consent of the gov-
erned.’’ 1 This is not just a statement of na-
tional policy, but a statement about legit-
imacy. 
Elections are the principal means of con-
ferring legitimacy by the consent of the gov-
erned. Impeachments, by the House and tried 
in the Senate, while conferring authority on 
535 Members of Congress to nullify one elec-
tion and disqualify a convicted President 
from appearing on a future ballot, exercise 
delegated power from the governed, much at-
tenuated from the direct consent provided by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S875 
February 5, 2020 
an election. It seems obvious that an im-
peachment of a President during an election 
year should give rise to heightened concerns 
about legitimacy. 
While there was extensive argument on 
what the Framers intended the impeachment 
standard to be, suffice it to say, they be-
lieved it should be serious enough to warrant 
removal, and disqualification from future of-
fice, of a duly elected President. 
The role of impeachments in a constitu-
tional republic like the United States was 
borrowed, to some extent, from our British 
forebears. But it was not a wholesale accept-
ance of the British model, with its par-
liamentary system where entire govern-
ments can be removed on a vote of no con-
fidence, but rather a distinctly Americanized 
system that purposefully created a strong 
and co-equal chief executive, elected by the 
people for a definite term, with a narrowed 
scope of impeachable offenses for the Presi-
dent. 
Under the U.S. Constitution, Presidents 
may be impeached for ‘‘treason, bribery, and 
other high crimes and misdemeanors.’’ Due 
to the rarity of presidential impeachments 
(three in 232 years), the age of some prece-
dents (dating back to the Johnson impeach-
ment of 1868), and the diversity of impeach-
ment cases (and in particular, the significant 
difference 
between 
the 
impeachment 
of 
judges and Presidents), there remains quite a 
bit of debate about precisely what actions by 
a President are impeachable. 
Some argue a crime is not required, al-
though all previous presidential impeach-
ments charged a crime. Some argue that not 
all crimes are impeachable, only serious 
crimes can be ‘‘high’’ crimes. Some cat-
egories, including ‘‘malversation,’’ ‘‘neglect 
of duty,’’ ‘‘corruption,’’ ‘‘malpractice,’’ and 
‘‘maladministration’’ were considered and 
rejected by the Framers.2 
(2) Abuse of power 
The 
President’s 
lawyers 
charge 
that 
‘‘abuse of power’’ alleged in the first Article 
of Impeachment is not a crime, much less a 
‘‘high’’ crime, nor a violation of established 
law. This argument raises Due Process of 
Law concerns with regard to notice of what 
is prohibited. As Justice Antonin Scalia ob-
served shortly before his death in the crimi-
nal context, ‘‘invoking so shapeless a provi-
sion to condemn someone . . . does not com-
port with the Constitution’s guarantee of 
due process.’’ 3 
Moreover, they argue that ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ is tantamount to ‘‘maladministra-
tion,’’ which was rejected by the Framers. 
There is little doubt that a vague and ambig-
uous charge in an Article of Impeachment 
can be a generalized accusation into which 
the House can lump all of their political, pol-
icy, and personal differences with a Presi-
dent. This should be avoided. 
The House Managers say no crime is re-
quired for impeachment, and that abuse of 
power, which incorporates a host of nefar-
ious acts, is all that is required. No violation 
of criminal statutes is alleged, nor required 
they say, and they disagree that abuse of 
power equates with ‘‘maladministration.’’ 
They point to Alexander Hamilton’s state-
ment in Federalist 65 that impeachable of-
fenses are ‘‘those offenses which proceed 
from the misconduct of public men, or, in 
other words, from the abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ 
(3) Obstruction of Congress. 
The House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence issued dozens of subpoenas 
and heard testimony from 17 witnesses. As to 
other witness subpoenas issued to members 
of the Trump Administration, White House 
Counsel Pat Cipollone argued in his October 
8, 2019 letter to Speaker of the House Pelosi 
that any subpoenas issued before passage of 
a formal resolution of the House establishing 
an impeachment inquiry were constitu-
tionally invalid and a violation of due proc-
ess. The House Managers rely on the Con-
stitution’s grant of the ‘‘sole power of im-
peachment’’ to the House and argue that no 
authorizing resolution was required. Essen-
tially, they argue that under the Constitu-
tion the House can run an impeachment in-
quiry any way the House wants and no one 
can complain. 
No committee of the House was officially 
delegated the House’s impeachment author-
ity until October 31, 2019, when the House 
passed House Resolution 660 directing ‘‘the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
and the Committees on Financial Services, 
Foreign Affairs, the Judiciary, Oversight and 
Reform, and Ways and Means to continue 
their ongoing investigations as part of the 
existing House of Representatives inquiry 
into whether sufficient grounds exist for the 
House of Representatives to exercise its con-
stitutional power to impeach Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States.’’ 
Neither the House’s theory that it could 
act without a delegation resolution, nor the 
White House Counsel’s argument that sub-
poenas were void without one was presented 
to a court during this impeachment inquiry.4 
In fact, the House intentionally avoided liti-
gation because, as House Manager Adam 
Schiff stated, it would slow down their in-
quiry. 
One example makes this point. Charles 
Kupperman was a deputy to former National 
Security Advisor John Bolton. Other than 
Bolton himself, Kupperman was one of the 
officials most likely to have direct knowl-
edge of an alleged quid pro quo on aid to 
Ukraine. But after the House subpoenaed 
him last fall, Kupperman went to court and 
asked for a resolution of the competing 
claims between the President and the House. 
Rather than wait for a judicial determina-
tion in this interbranch dispute, the House 
withdrew its subpoena and affirmatively dis-
claimed any desire to pursue Kupperman’s 
testimony in the future.5 The House also de-
cided not to subpoena Bolton or any other 
key witnesses in the administration. 
Instead, the House elected to push through 
impeachment with an abbreviated period of 
roughly three months and declared any delay 
by President Trump, even to seek judicial re-
view, to be obstruction of Congress and a 
high crime and misdemeanor. The Adminis-
tration is currently in court challenging de-
mands for witnesses and documents. Just a 
couple weeks ago, the Supreme Court accept-
ed such cases for review and stayed the lower 
court decisions ordering the production of 
President Trump’s financial records from 
third parties.6 Still, the House impeached 
President Trump before the Supreme Court 
or other federal courts could rule on the 
merits of claims of presidential privileges 
and immunities in this impeachment in-
quiry. 
The essence of the House’s second Article 
of Impeachment is that it is Obstruction of 
Congress to decline to voluntarily submit to 
the House’s inquiry and forgo any claims of 
presidential privileges or immunities. One 
interpretation of these facts is that the 
House simply gave up pursuing the testi-
mony in the interest of speed. While un-
doubtedly litigation would have delayed for 
a time the House’s impeachment inquiry if 
they were determined to secure the testi-
mony they initially sought, it is clear that 
the President, and not the witnesses, would 
assert claims of executive privilege or abso-
lute testimony immunity to protect the Of-
fice of the Presidency. These claims are con-
stitutionally based in the separation of pow-
ers, long-recognized by the Department of 
Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel, and repeat-
edly asserted by both Republican and Demo-
cratic Administrations in countless disputes 
with Congress. And since the House did not 
pursue the testimony originally subpoenaed, 
the issue of presidential privileges or immu-
nity was never decided.7 
But that is not all. Representative Eric 
Swalwell recently declared that not only 
should a sitting president be impeached if he 
or she goes to the courts rather than submit 
to Congress, but that contesting demands for 
evidence is actually evidence of guilt on all 
of 
the 
charged 
offenses. 
Congressman 
Swalwell claimed ‘‘we can only conclude 
that you are guilty’’ if someone refuses to 
give testimony or documents to Congress.8 
So much for the presumption of innocence 
and other constitutional rights encompassed 
by the Constitution’s guarantee of Due Proc-
ess of Law. 
It is an odd argument that a person ac-
cused of running a red light has more legal 
rights than a President being impeached. 
(4) The House’s impeachment inquiry 
The House Managers argue that since Arti-
cle 1, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the 
House the ‘‘sole power of impeachment,’’ the 
President cannot question the procedures as 
a denial of Due Process of Law or authority 
by which that House produced the Articles. 
What they don’t explain is how House rules 
can preempt the Constitution. They can’t. 
As Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in 
Marbury v. Madison, ‘‘the Constitution is su-
perior to any ordinary act of the legislature, 
[and] the Constitution, and not such ordi-
nary act, must govern the case to which they 
both apply.’’ 9 
While the Constitution gives the House the 
‘‘sole power to impeach’’ it gives the Senate 
the ‘‘sole power to try all impeachments.’’ 
Some have analogized the House’s role to a 
grand jury in criminal cases. Generally 
speaking, a grand jury may issue an indict-
ment, also known as a ‘‘true bill,’’ only if it 
finds, based upon the evidence that has been 
presented to it, that there is probable cause 
to believe that a crime has been committed 
by a criminal suspect. 
But impeachment is not, strictly speaking, 
a criminal case, even though the Constitu-
tion speaks in terms of ‘‘conviction’’ and the 
impeachment standard is ‘‘treason, bribery, 
or other high crimes and misdemeanors.’’ 
Contrast that with Article 1, Section 3, 
Clause 7: ‘‘the Party convicted shall never-
theless be liable and subject to Indictment, 
Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according 
to Law.’’ In other words, the constitutional 
prohibition of double jeopardy does not 
apply. 
Neither are Senators jurors in the usual 
sense of being ‘‘disinterested’’ in the facts or 
outcome. Senators take the following oath: 
‘‘Do you solemnly swear that in all things 
appertaining to the trial of the impeachment 
of Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, now pending, you will do im-
partial justice according to the Constitution 
and laws, so help you God?’’ 
Hamilton wrote in Federalist 65 the Senate 
was chosen as the tribunal for courts of im-
peachment because: 
‘‘Where else than in the Senate could have 
been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, 
or sufficiently independent? What other body 
would be likely to feel confidence enough in 
its own situation, to preserve, unawed and 
uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality be-
tween an individual accused, and the rep-
resentatives of the people, his accusers?’’ 
Because impeachment is neither civil nor 
criminal in the usual sense, it must be some-
thing different. President Trump’s counsel 
referred to the Senate role as sitting in a

February 5, 2020 
‘‘High Court of Impeachment,’’ and ‘‘Democ-
racy’s ultimate court.’’ Hamilton, in Fed-
eralist 65, called it ‘‘a method of national in-
quest.’’ 
One of most significant disputes in the 
Senate 
impeachment 
trial 
of 
President 
Trump was the duty of the House to develop 
evidence during its impeachment inquiry 
and the duty of the Senate when new evi-
dence is sought by one or both parties during 
the trial. In addressing this issue, it is help-
ful to remind ourselves that the American 
system of justice is adversarial in nature. 
That is, it is a system that ‘‘resolves dis-
putes by presenting conflicting views of fact 
and law to an impartial and relatively pas-
sive arbiter, who decides which side wins 
what.’’ 10 This system ‘‘consists of a core of 
basic rights that recognize and protect the 
dignity of the individual in a free society.’’ 11 
The rights that comprise the adversary 
system include . . . the rights to call and to 
confront witnesses, and the right to require 
the government to prove guilt beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. . . . These rights, and others, 
are also included in the broad and funda-
mental concept [of] due process of law—a 
concept which itself has been substantially 
equated with the adversary system.’’ 12 
The adversarial nature of these pro-
ceedings means that the House Managers 
were obligated to develop their case, includ-
ing the evidence, in the House inquiry, and 
not rely on the Senate to do so. In typical 
court proceedings, the failure of the pros-
ecutor to present sufficient evidence at trial 
results in dismissal, not in open-ended dis-
covery or a re-opened investigation. 
President Trump’s lawyers argued that 
there were three main errors in the House 
proceedings: 
(1) The House did not initially authorize 
the impeachment inquiry, thus delegating 
its ‘‘sole power’’ to the Intelligence Com-
mittee, which issued dozens of subpoenas the 
President deemed invalid; 
(2) Numerous due process violations during 
the Intelligence Committee’s proceedings, 
including denial of notice, counsel, cross ex-
amination, and the opportunity to call wit-
nesses; 
(3) And, finally, that as an interested fact 
witness regarding Intelligence Committee 
contacts with the whistleblower, Chairman 
Schiff could not be said to have fairly con-
ducted the House investigation. 
Again, the House Managers argue that the 
method by which the Articles of Impeach-
ment were approved in the House cannot be 
challenged in the Senate trial given the 
House’s ‘‘sole power to impeach.’’ 
Ominously, the President’s lawyers argue 
that whatever precedent was set by the Sen-
ate in this trial would be the ‘‘new normal’’ 
and govern not just this trial but all im-
peachment trials in the future. They also 
argue that to make impeachment ‘‘too easy’’ 
in the House will result in more frequent 
presidential impeachments being approved 
by this and future Houses, which the Senate 
would then be obligated to try. Similarly, 
they argue that the Senate should not re-
ward the failure of the House to litigate 
questions of presidential privileges and im-
munities in their impeachment inquiry and 
transfer that burden to the Senate. An im-
portant difference between the House and 
Senate is that House inquiries can be dele-
gated to committees while the House con-
ducts other business; not so in the Senate, 
which must sit as a court of impeachment 
until the trial is completed. 
Thus, during a Senate impeachment trial, 
absent unanimous consent—unlikely given 
the contentious nature of the proceedings— 
the Senate is precluded from any other busi-
ness, even during delays while executive 
privilege and similar issues are litigated in 
the courts. Given that the House chose to 
not seek judicial enforcement of subpoenas 
during its impeachment inquiry because of 
concerns about delay, the question is do they 
have a right to do so during the Senate trial? 
If so, the President’s lawyers claim, such an 
outcome would significantly protract a Sen-
ate trial and permanently alter the relation-
ship between the House and Senate in im-
peachment proceedings. Indeed, there is a 
strong textual and structural argument that 
the Constitution prohibits the Senate from 
performing the investigative role assigned to 
the House. 
The House Managers contend that Chief 
Justice John Roberts could rule on questions 
of privilege while presiding over the im-
peachment trial, avoiding delay during liti-
gation, but the Chief Justice made clear his 
was not a judicial role in the usual sense.13 
When the issue of whether the Chief Justice 
would be a tie-breaking vote came up during 
the trial, he said: ‘‘I think it would be inap-
propriate for me, an unelected official from a 
different branch of government, to assert the 
power to change that result so that the mo-
tion would succeed.’’ So it is that the Sen-
ate, not the Chief Justice presiding in an es-
sentially ceremonial role during impeach-
ment trials, determines disputed issues. This 
conclusion is further supported by the rule 
that a majority of Senators are empowered 
to effectively ‘‘overrule’’ an initial deter-
mination by the presiding officer. In the 
words of Senate Impeachment Rule Seven: 
‘‘The presiding officer may, in the first in-
stance, submit to the Senate, without a divi-
sion, all questions of evidence and incidental 
questions; but the same shall, on the demand 
of one-fifth of the members present, be de-
cided by yeas and nays.’’ The unseemliness 
of imposing this role on the Chief Justice is 
obvious and should be avoided. 
(5) The Facts 
Of course, the main factual contentions of 
the 
House 
Managers 
involve 
President 
Trump’s interest in an investigation of Hun-
ter and Joe Biden’s role in Ukraine. They al-
lege the President’s ‘‘corrupt’’ motive to dig 
up dirt on a potential political rival is an 
abuse of power. The President’s lawyers 
argue that it is clearly within the Presi-
dent’s authority to investigate corruption 
and leverage foreign aid in order to combat 
it. Even if it incidentally helps the President 
electorally, they argue it is not a ‘‘high 
crime and misdemeanor.’’ 
But there are more basic factual conun-
drums. Any investigations discussed in the 
July 25 conversation between Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelensky and Presi-
dent Trump never occurred. And the foreign 
aid, including lethal defensive aid and weap-
ons, was paused for just a short time and de-
livered on September 11, 2019, before the 
deadline of September 30. 
The abuse of power alleged was based on 
desired investigations and the withholding of 
foreign aid. But neither, ultimately, oc-
curred. This is similar to an ‘‘attempted’’ of-
fense under the criminal law. Indeed, the law 
criminalizes a host of attempted offenses. 
But the Articles of Impeachment do not 
charge President Trump with any crimes, in-
cluding any ‘‘attempted’’ offenses. 
(6) Burden of Proof 
President Trump’s counsel argued that the 
appropriate burden of proof in this quasi- 
criminal trial is ‘‘proof beyond a reasonable 
doubt.’’ This point was not seriously con-
tested by the House Managers who repeat-
edly claimed the evidence in support of the 
Articles 
of 
Impeachment 
was 
‘‘over-
whelming.’’ Manager Jerry Nadler went fur-
ther and claimed, repeatedly, that the evi-
dence 
produced 
was 
‘‘conclusive’’ 
and 
‘‘uncontested.’’ Manager Zoe Lofgren argued 
that Senators could use, literally, any stand-
ard they wished. 
This is significant on the issue of the 
President’s motive in seeking a corruption 
investigation from President Zelensky, one 
that included former Vice President Biden 
and his son, Hunter, and the company on 
whose board he served, Burisma. The House 
Managers argued, repeatedly, that President 
Trump did not care about Ukrainian corrup-
tion or burden sharing with allies and that 
his sole motive was to get information dam-
aging to a political rival, Joe Biden. 
President Trump’s lawyers contend that he 
has a record of concerns about burden shar-
ing with allies, as well as corruption, and 
produced several examples. At most, they 
say, his was a mixed motive—partly policy, 
partly political—and in any event it was not 
a crime and thus not impeachable. 
Therefore, the question arises: did the 
House Managers prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the sole motive for pausing mili-
tary aid to Ukraine was for his personal ben-
efit? Or, did they fail to meet their burden? 
Conclusion 
Ultimately, the House Managers failed to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Presi-
dent Trump’s sole motive for seeking any 
corruption investigation in Ukraine, includ-
ing of Hunter Biden, was for a personal polit-
ical benefit. This is particularly true given 
the evidence of President Trump’s docu-
mented interest in financial burden sharing 
with allies, and the widely shared concerns, 
including by the Obama/Biden Administra-
tion, with corruption in Ukraine and the 
need to protect American taxpayers. 
Even if President Trump had mixed mo-
tives—a public interest combined with a per-
sonal interest—the fact is the investigations 
never occurred and the aid to Ukraine was 
paused but delivered on schedule. 
Moreover, none of the above conduct rises 
to the level of a ‘‘high crime and mis-
demeanor.’’ The first article, Abuse of 
Power, which charges no crime or violation 
of existing law is too vague and ambiguous 
to meet the Constitution’s requirements. It 
is simply a conclusion into which any dis-
agreeable conduct can be lumped. 
Finally, the second article, Obstruction of 
Congress, cannot be sustained on this record. 
The President’s counsel argued persuasively 
that its subpoenas were largely unauthorized 
in the absence of a House resolution dele-
gating its authority to a House committee. 
What’s more, the House never sought to en-
force its subpoenas in the courts, essentially 
giving up efforts to do so in favor of expe-
diting the House impeachment inquiry. The 
desire to meet an arbitrary deadline before 
Christmas was prioritized over a judicial de-
termination in the interbranch dispute.

OFFICER 
(Mrs.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
come here today with the business of 
impeachment before this Chamber. It 
should hardly be necessary at this late 
juncture to outline again the train of 
abuses and distortions and outright 
lies that have brought us to today’s 
impeachment vote: the secret meetings 
in the Capitol basement; the closed 
hearings without due process or basic 
fairness; the failure of the House to fol-
low their own rules and authorize an 
impeachment inquiry and then the bi-
partisan vote against impeachment; 
and the attempt to manipulate or even 
prevent a trial here in the Senate— 
holding the Articles of Impeachment 
for 33 days—in brazen defiance of the 
Constitution’s mandates. 
The House Democrats have given us 
the first purely partisan impeachment 
in our history and the first attempt to 
remove an elected President that does 
not even allege unlawful conduct. 
Animating it all has been the bitter 
resentment of a professional political 
class that cannot accept the verdict of 
the people in 2016, that cannot accept 
the people’s priorities, and that now 
seeks to overturn the election and en-
trench themselves in power. That is 
how we arrived at this moment, that is 
how we got here, and that is what this 
is really about. 
Now it is time to bring this fiasco to 
a close. It is time to end this cycle of 
retribution and payback and bitter-
ness. It is time to end the abuse of our 
institutions. It is time to let the ver-
dict of the people stand. So I will vote 
today to acquit the President of these 
charges. 
You know, it has been clear for a 
long time that impeachment is not a 
priority of the people—it is not even 
close. It is a pipe dream of politicians. 
And as the Democrats have forced it on 
this country over these many months, 
it has sapped our energy and diverted 
our attention from the real issues that 
press upon our country, the issues the 
people of this Nation have tried to get 
this town to care about for years. I 
mean the crisis of surging suicides and 
drug addiction that is driving down life 
expectancy in my State and across this 
Nation. I mean the crisis at the border, 
where those drugs are pouring across. I 
mean 
the 
crisis 
of 
skyrocketing 
healthcare costs, which burden fami-
lies, young and old, with bills they can-
not pay. I mean the crisis of affordable 
housing, which robs parents of a safe 
place to raise their children and build a 
life. I mean the crisis of trafficking and 
exploitation, which robs our young 
girls and boys of a future and our soci-
ety of their innocence. I mean the cri-
sis of the family farm and the crisis of 
education costs for those who go to col-
lege and the lack of good-paying jobs 
for those who don’t. I mean the crisis 
of connectivity in our heartland, where 
too many schoolchildren can’t access 
the internet even to do their homework 
at night. I mean the crisis of unfair 
trade and lost jobs and broken homes. 
And I could go on. 
My point is this: When I listen to the 
people of my State, I don’t hear about 
impeachment. No, I hear about the 
problems of home and neighborhood, of 
family and community, about the loss 
of faith in our government and about 
the struggle to find hope for the future. 
This town owes it to these Americans— 
the ones who sent us here—finally to 
listen, finally to act, and finally to do 
something that really matters to them. 
We must leave this impeachment cir-
cus behind us and ensure that our Con-
stitution is never again abused in this 
way. It is time to turn the page. It is 
time to turn to a new politics of the 
people and to a politics of home. It is 
time to turn to the future—a future 
where this town finally accepts the 
people’s judgment and the people’s ver-
dict and where this town finally deliv-
ers for the people who elected them; a 
future where the middle of our society 
gets a fair shake and a level playing 
field; a future where maybe—maybe— 
this town will finally listen. 
When I think of all the energy and all 
the effort that has been expended on 
this impeachment crusade over almost 
3 years now, I wonder what might have 
been. 
Today is a sad day, but it does not 
have to remain that way. Imagine what 
we might achieve for the good of this 
Nation if we turn our energy and our 
effort to the work of the American peo-
ple. Imagine what we could do to keep 
families in their homes and to bring 
new possibility to the Nation’s heart-
land and to care for our children in 
every part of this society. Imagine 
what we could do to lift up the most 
vulnerable among us who have been ex-
ploited and trafficked and give them 
new hope and new life. Imagine what 
we could do for those who have been 
forgotten, from our rural towns to our 
inner cities. Imagine what we could do 
to give them control over their own 
destinies. 
We can find the common good. We 
can push the boundaries of the pos-
sible. We can rebuild this Nation if we 
will listen to the American people. Let 
us begin. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee is recognized. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
in this impeachment proceeding, I 
worked with other Senators to make 
sure that we had the right to ask for 
more documents and witnesses, but 
there was no need for more evidence to 
prove something that I believe had al-
ready been proven and that did not 
meet the U.S. Constitution’s high bar 
for an impeachable offense. 
There was no need for more evidence 
to prove that the President asked 
Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and 
his son, Hunter. He said this on tele-
vision on October 3, 2019, and he said it 
during his July 25, 2019, telephone call 
with the President of Ukraine. 
There was no need for more evidence 
to conclude that the President with-
held United States aid, at least in part, 
to pressure Ukraine to investigate the 
Bidens. The House managers have 
proved this with what they called a 
‘‘mountain of overwhelming evidence.’’ 
One of the managers said it was 
‘‘proved beyond a shadow of a doubt.’’ 
There was no need to consider fur-
ther the frivolous second Article of Im-
peachment that would remove from the 
President and future Presidents—re-
move this President for asserting his 
constitutional prerogative to protect 
confidential conversations with his 
close advisers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S878 
February 5, 2020 
It was inappropriate for the Presi-
dent to ask a foreign leader to inves-
tigate his political opponent and to 
withhold U.S. aid to encourage this in-
vestigation. When elected officials in-
appropriately interfere with such in-
vestigations, it undermines the prin-
ciple of equal justice under the law. 
But the Constitution does not give the 
Senate the power to remove the Presi-
dent from office and ban him from this 
year’s ballot simply for actions that 
are inappropriate. 
The question, then, is not whether 
the President did it but whether the 
Senate or the American people should 
decide what to do about what he did. I 
believe that the Constitution clearly 
provides that the people should make 
that decision in the Presidential elec-
tion that began on Monday in Iowa. 
The Senate has spent 11 long days 
considering this mountain of evidence, 
the arguments of the House managers 
and the President’s lawyers, their an-
swers to Senators’ questions, and the 
House 
record. 
Even 
if 
the 
House 
charges were true, they don’t meet the 
Constitution’s ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or 
other High Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ 
standard for impeachable offense. 
The Framers believed that there 
never ever should be a partisan im-
peachment. That is why the Constitu-
tion requires a two-thirds vote of the 
Senate to convict. Yet not one House 
Republican voted for these articles. 
If this shallow, hurried, and wholly 
partisan impeachment were to succeed, 
it would rip the country apart, pouring 
gasoline on the fire of cultural divi-
sions that already exist. It would cre-
ate a weapon of perpetual impeach-
ment to be used against future Presi-
dents whenever the House of Rep-
resentatives is of a different political 
party. 
Our founding documents provide for 
duly elected Presidents who serve with 
‘‘the consent of the governed,’’ not at 
the pleasure of the U.S. Congress. Let 
the people decide. 
A year ago, at the Southeastern Con-
ference 
basketball 
tournament, 
a 
friend of 40 years sitting in front of me 
turned to me and said: ‘‘I am very un-
happy with you for voting against the 
President.’’ She was referring to my 
vote against the President’s decision to 
spend money that Congress hadn’t ap-
propriated to build the border wall. 
I believed then and now that the U.S. 
Constitution gives to the Congress the 
exclusive power to appropriate money. 
This 
separation 
of 
powers 
creates 
checks and balances in our government 
that preserve our individual liberty by 
not allowing, in that case, the Execu-
tive to have too much power. 
I replied to my friend: ‘‘Look, I was 
not voting for or against the President. 
I was voting for the United States Con-
stitution.’’ Well, she wasn’t convinced. 
This past Sunday, walking my dog 
Rufus in Nashville, I was confronted by 
a neighbor who said she was angry and 
crushed by my vote against allowing 
more witnesses in the impeachment 
trial. ‘‘The Senate should remove the 
President for extortion,’’ she said. 
I replied to her: ‘‘I was not voting for 
or against the President. I was voting 
for the United States Constitution, 
which, in my view, does not give the 
Senate the power to remove a Presi-
dent from his office and from this 
year’s election ballot simply for ac-
tions 
that 
are 
inappropriate. 
The 
United States Constitution says a 
President may be convicted only for 
Treason, 
Bribery, 
and 
other 
High 
Crimes and Misdemeanors. President 
Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are 
a far cry from that. Plus,’’ I said, ‘‘un-
like the Nixon impeachment, when al-
most all Republicans voted to initiate 
an impeachment inquiry, not one sin-
gle Republican voted to initiate this 
impeachment inquiry against Presi-
dent Trump. The Trump impeach-
ment,’’ I said to her, ‘‘was a completely 
partisan action, and the Framers of the 
United States Constitution, especially 
James Madison, believed we should 
never ever have a partisan impeach-
ment. That would undermine the sepa-
ration of powers by allowing the House 
of Representatives to immobilize the 
executive branch, as well as the Sen-
ate, by a perpetual partisan series of 
impeachments.’’ Well, she was not con-
vinced. 
When our country was created, there 
never had been anything quite like it— 
a democratic republic with a written 
Constitution. Perhaps its greatest in-
novation was the separation of powers 
among the Presidency, the Supreme 
Court, and the Congress. 
The late Justice Scalia said this of 
checks and balances: ‘‘Every tin horn 
dictator in the world today, every 
president for life, has a Bill of Rights. 
. . . What has made us free is our Con-
stitution.’’ What he meant was, what 
makes the United States different and 
protects our individual liberty is the 
separation of powers and the checks 
and balances in our Constitution. 
The goal of our Founders was not to 
have a King as a chief executive, on the 
one hand, or not to have a British-style 
parliament, on the other, which could 
remove our chief executive or prime 
minister with a majority or no-con-
fidence vote. The principle reason our 
Constitution created a U.S. Senate is 
so that one body of Congress can pause 
and resist the excesses of the Executive 
or popular passions that could run 
through the House of Representatives 
like a freight train. 
The language of the Constitution, of 
course, is subject to interpretation, but 
on some things, its words are clear. 
The President cannot spend money 
that Congress doesn’t appropriate— 
that is clear—and the Senate can’t re-
move a President for anything less 
than treason, bribery, high crimes and 
misdemeanors, and two-thirds of us, 
the Senators, must agree on that. That 
requires a bipartisan consensus. 
We Senators take an oath to base our 
decisions on the provisions of our Con-
stitution, which is what I have endeav-
ored to do during this impeachment 
proceeding. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to include a few documents in 
the RECORD
following my remarks. 
They include an editorial from Feb-
ruary 3 from the Wall Street Journal; 
an editorial from the National Review, 
also dated February 3; an opinion edi-
torial by Robert Doar, president of the 
American Enterprise Institute on Feb-
ruary 1; an article from KnoxTNToday, 
yesterday; and a transcript from my 
appearance on ‘‘Meet the Press’’ on 
Sunday, February 2, 2020. These docu-
ments illuminate and further explain 
my statement today. 
Thank you. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 3, 2020] 
EDITORIAL BOARD: LAMAR ALEXANDER’S FIN-
EST HOUR—HIS VOTE AGAINST WITNESSES 
WAS ROOTED IN CONSTITUTIONAL WISDOM 
Senate Republicans are taking even more 
media abuse than usual after voting to bar 
witnesses from the impeachment trial of 
President Trump. ‘‘Cringing abdication’’ and 
‘‘a dishonorable Senate’’ are two examples of 
the sputtering progressive rage. On the con-
trary, we think it was Lamar Alexander’s 
finest hour. 
The Tennessee Republican, who isn’t run-
ning for re-election this year, was a decisive 
vote in the narrowly divided Senate on call-
ing witnesses. He listened to the evidence 
and arguments from both sides, and then he 
offered his sensible judgment: Even if Mr. 
Trump did what House managers charge, it 
still isn’t enough to remove a President from 
office.‘‘It was inappropriate for the president 
to ask a foreign leader to investigate his po-
litical opponent and to withhold United 
States aid to encourage that investigation,’’ 
Mr. Alexander said in a statement Thursday 
night. ‘‘But the Constitution does not give 
the Senate the power to remove the presi-
dent from office and ban him from this 
year’s ballot simply for actions that are in-
appropriate.’’ 
The House managers had proved their case 
to his satisfaction even without new wit-
nesses, Mr. Alexander added, but ‘‘they do 
not meet the Constitution’s ‘treason, brib-
ery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors’ 
standard for an impeachable offense.’’ Ne-
braska Sen. Ben Sasse told reporters ‘‘let me 
be clear: Lamar speaks for lots and lots of 
us.’’ 
This isn’t an abdication. It’s a wise judg-
ment based on what Mr. Trump did and the 
rushed, partisan nature of the House im-
peachment. Mr. Trump was wrong to ask 
Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter 
Biden, and wrong to use U.S. aid as leverage. 
His call with Ukraine’s President was far 
from ‘‘perfect.’’ It was reckless and self-de-
structive, as Mr. Trump often is. 
Nearly all of his advisers and several Sen-
ators opposed his actions, Senators like Wis-
consin’s Ron Johnson lobbied Mr. Trump 
hard against the aid delay, and in the end 
the aid was delivered within the fiscal year 
and Ukraine did not begin an investigation. 
Even the House managers did not allege spe-
cific crimes in their impeachment articles. 
For those who want the best overall account 
of what happened, we again recommend the 
Nov. 18 letter that Mr. Johnson wrote to 
House Republicans. 
Mr. Alexander’s statement made two other 
crucial points. The first concerns the damage 
that partisan removal of Mr. Trump would 
do to the country.

S879 
February 5, 2020 
‘‘The framers believed that there should 
never, ever be a partisan impeachment. That 
is why the Constitution requires a 2/3 vote of 
the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House 
Republican voted for these articles,’’ Mr. 
Alexander noted. ‘‘If this shallow, hurried

sions that already exist. It would create the 
weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used 
against 
future 
presidents 
whenever

House of Representatives is of a different po-
litical party.’’ 
Does anyone who isn’t a Resistance par-
tisan doubt this? Democrats and the press 
talk as if removing Mr. Trump is a matter of 
constitutional routine that would restore 
American politics to some pre-2016 nor-
malcy. That’s a dangerous illusion. 
The ouster of Mr. Trump, the political out-
sider, on such slender grounds would be seen 
by half the country as an insider coup d’etat. 
Unlike Richard Nixon’s resignation, it would 
never be accepted by Mr. Trump’s voters, 
who would wave it as a bloody flag for years 
to come. Payback against the next Demo-
cratic President when the Republicans re-
take the House would be a certainty. 
Mr. Alexander directed Americans to the 
better solution of our constitutional bed-
rock. ‘‘The question then is not whether the 
president did it, but whether the United 
States Senate or the American people should 
decide what to do about what he did,’’ his 
statement said. ‘‘Our founding documents 
provide for duly elected presidents who serve 
with ‘the consent of the governed,’ not at the 
pleasure of the United States Congress. Let 
the people decide.’’ 
Democrats and their allies in the media 
have spent three years trying to nullify the 
election their candidate lost in 2016. They 
have hawked false Russian conspiracy theo-
ries, ignored abuse by the FBI, floated fan-
tasies about triggering the 25th Amendment, 
and tried to turn bad presidential judgment 
toward Ukraine into an impeachable offense. 
Yet Mr. Trump’s job approval rating has in-
creased during the impeachment hearings 
and trial. 
Our friendly advice to Democrats and the 
impeachment press is to accept that you lost 
fair and square in 2016 and focus on nomi-
nating a better Democratic candidate this 
year. On the recent polling evidence, that 
task is urgent. In the meantime, thank you, 
Lamar Alexander. 
[From the National Review, Feb. 3, 2020] 
EDITORIAL BOARD: LAMAR ALEXANDER GETS 
IT RIGHT 
The impeachment saga is drawing to a 
close. 
The Senate is prepared to acquit without 
hearing from witnesses, after Lamar Alex-
ander, a swing vote, came out against calling 
them late last week. 
In his statement, Alexander expressed the 
correct view on the underlying matter—one 
we have been urging Republicans to publicly 
adopt since impeachment first got off the 
ground. 
The Tennessee Republican said that it has 
been amply established that Donald Trump 
used a hold on defense aid to pressure the 
Ukrainians to undertake the investigations 
that he wanted, and that this was, as he 
mildly put it, inappropriate. But this mis-
conduct, he argued, doesn’t rise to the level 
of the high crimes and misdemeanors re-
quired to remove a president from office. If 
the Senate were to do so anyway, it would 
further envenom the nation’s partisan di-
vide. Besides, there is a national election 
looming where the public itself can decide 
whether Trump should stay in office or not. 
Since we already know the core of what 
happened, Alexander explained, there was no 
need to hear from additional witnesses in the 
Senate trial. (On this theory of the case, the 
Senate is in effect acting like an appellate 
court, rendering a judgment on a threshold 
question of law, rather than a trial court 
sifting through the facts.) 
In the wake of Alexander’s statement, 
other Senate Republicans endorsed his line 
of analysis, which, it must be noted, is supe-
rior to the defense mounted by the White 
House legal team over the last two weeks. 
Because the president refused to acknowl-
edge what he did, his team implausibly de-
nied there was a quid pro quo and argued 
that one hadn’t been proven since there were 
no first-hand witnesses. Obviously, this posi-
tion was at odds with the defense team’s in-
sistence that no further witnesses be called. 
It also raised the natural question why, if 
people with firsthand knowledge had excul-
patory information, the White House wasn’t 
eager to let them come forward. 
Additionally, the White House maintained 
that a president can’t be impeached unless 
he’s guilty of a criminal violation. This is an 
erroneous interpretation of the Constitution, 
although it is true that past presidential im-
peachments have involved violations of the 
law and that such violations provide a bright 
line that’s missing if the charge is only 
abuse of power. Alan Dershowitz argued this 
position most aggressively for the presi-
dent’s defense, and made it even worse by 
briefly seeming—before walking it back—to 
argue that anything a president does to ad-
vance his reelection is properly motivated. 
As for the House managers, they were at 
their strongest making the case that the 
president had done what they alleged, and 
their weakest arguing that he should be re-
moved for it. 
They tried to inflate the gravity of 
Trump’s offense by repeatedly calling it 
‘‘election interference.’’ At the end of the 
day, though, what the Trump team sought 
was not an investigation of Joe or Hunter 
Biden, but a statement by the Ukrainians 
that they’d look into Burisma, the Ukrain-
ian company on whose board Hunter Biden 
sat. The firm has a shady past and has been 
investigated before. Trump should have 
steered clear of anything involving his po-
tential opponent, but it’s not obvious that a 
new Burisma probe would have had any ef-
fect on 2020 (the vulnerability for Biden is 
Hunter’s payments, which are already on the 
record) and, of course, the announcement of 
an investigation never happened. 
They said that Trump’s seeking this 
Ukrainian interference was in keeping with 
his welcoming of Russian meddling, imply-
ing that Trump had been found guilty of 
colluding with the Russians in 2016, rather 
than exonerated. (Part of the complaint here 
is that Trump made use of material that 
emerged via Russian hacking. Then again, so 
did Bernie Sanders in his fight with the 
DNC.) 
They alleged that the brief delay in aid to 
Ukraine somehow endangered our national 
security, a risible claim given that the 
Ukrainians got the aid and that Trump has 
provided Ukraine lethal assistance that 
President Obama never did. 
They accused the president of obstruction 
of justice for asserting privileges invoked by 
other presidents and not producing docu-
ments and witnesses on the House’s acceler-
ated timeline, a charge that White House 
lawyer Patrick Philbin effectively disman-
tled. 
Finally, they insisted that a trial without 
witnesses wouldn’t be fair, despite making 
no real effort to secure the new witnesses 
during their own rushed impeachment in-
quiry. 
As for the Senate trial being a ‘‘cover up,’’ 
as Democrats now insist it is, there is noth-
ing stopping the House—or the Senate, for 
that matter—from seeking testimony from 
John Bolton and others outside the confines 
of the trial. This would be entirely reason-
able congressional oversight (despite the 
White House arguing otherwise) and there is 
still a public interest in knowing as much as 
possible about this matter, even if Trump 
isn’t going to be removed. 
If nothing else, the last two weeks have 
been a forum for extensive discussion about 
the respective powers of the two elected 
branches of government. We are sympathetic 
to the view that the executive branch has 
too much power. If Congress seeks to remedy 
this imbalance by impeaching and removing 
presidents, though, it will be sorely dis-
appointed, since the two-thirds requirement 
for a Senate conviction is an almost insuper-
able obstacle to removal (as both House Re-
publicans and House Democrats have experi-
enced the last 20 years). 
It would be better if Congress undertook a 
more systematic effort to take back preroga-
tives it has ceded to the executive branch 
and the courts. But we aren’t optimistic on 
this score, since the same Democrats who 
claim to be sticklers about congressional 
power on the Ukraine matter won’t say a dis-
couraging word about Elizabeth Warren’s 
and Bernie Sanders’s promised adventures in 
unilateral rule as president. 
At the end of the day, Nancy Pelosi im-
peached knowing that the Senate wouldn’t 
convict, and so here we are—with nine 
months to go until voters get to make their 
judgment: not just about Ukraine, but about 
the last four years and Trump’s eventual op-
ponent.

ALEXANDER GOT IT RIGHT: IT TAKES MORE TO 
REMOVE A PRESIDENT 
(By Robert Doar) 
‘‘It was inappropriate for the president to 
ask a foreign leader to investigate his polit-
ical opponent and to withhold United States 
aid to encourage that investigation. When 
elected officials inappropriately interfere 
with such investigations, it undermines the 
principle of equal justice under the law. But 
the Constitution does not give the Senate 
the power to remove the president from of-
fice and ban him from this year’s ballot sim-
ply for actions that are inappropriate.’’ 
Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander’s words 
reminded me of the struggle my father, John 
Doar, had as he considered whether the con-
duct of President Richard Nixon was so seri-
ous that it should lead the House to impeach 
him and the Senate to remove him from of-
fice. Dad was in charge of the House Judici-
ary Committee staff, which took seven 
months (between December 1973 and July 
1974) to examine the evidence and consider 
the question. What he concluded, and what 
the House Judiciary Committee by bipar-
tisan majorities also found, was that Nixon 
deserved impeachment and removal for a 
pattern of conduct over a multi-year period 
that both obstructed justice and abused 
power. 
So the first article, concerning obstruction 
of justice, found that Nixon and his subordi-
nates had tampered with witnesses and 
interfered with the Department of Justice’s 
investigations. They had paid hush money 
and attempted to misuse the CIA. And they 
had lied repeatedly to investigators and the 
American people. 
On abuse of power, Nixon was found to 
have misused his authority over the IRS, the 
FBI, the CIA, and the Secret Service to de-
feat political opponents and protect himself, 
and in the process he had violated the con-
stitutional rights of citizens. After he came

under suspicion, he tried to manipulate these 
agencies to interfere with the investigation. 
President 
Trump’s 
conduct 
toward 
Ukraine, though inappropriate, differs sig-
nificantly from Nixon’s in one crucial re-
spect. Where Nixon’s impeachable abuse of 
power occurred over a period of several 
years, the conduct challenged by the House’s 
impeachment of Trump was not nearly as 
prolonged. From July to September of last 
year, Trump attempted to cajole a foreign 
government to open an investigation into his 
political opponent. That conduct was wrong. 
But it’s not the same as what Nixon did over 
multiple years. 
This contrast brings to light a critical dif-
ference between the House’s behavior in 1974 
and its efforts today. When Nixon’s actions 
came to light, the House conducted an im-
peachment the right way: The House Judici-
ary Committee took seven months to exam-
ine all of the evidence, built up a theory of 
the case which matched the Constitution’s 
requirements, and produced charges that im-
plicated the president and his subordinates 
in a pattern of impeachable conduct. Faced 
with certain impeachment and removal from 
office, Nixon resigned. What Trump at-
tempted to do, as Alexander rightly sees, is 
not that. 
Alexander is right about one other thing— 
we should let the people decide who our next 
president should be. 
[From the Knox TN Today, Feb. 4, 2020] 
LAMAR WAS RIGHT 
(By Frank Cagle) 
Since I’m older than dirt, there have been 
occasions over the years when first-term 
state legislators would ask me if I had any 
advice for them. 
Yes. 
When a major and controversial issue 
looms study it, decide where you are and let 
everyone know where you are. In other 
words, pick a side early, have a reputation 
for keeping your word, and do not be known 
as a member who will go where the wind 
blows. 
Make sure you do not get into the group 
known as the undecideds. You will get ham-
mered by both sides, wooed by both sides and 
hounded by the media. And finally, do not 
under any circumstances be the deciding 
vote. Yours will be the only vote anyone re-
members. 
You would think someone who has been 
around as long as Lamar Alexander could 
avoid this trap. But not so. In the impeach-
ment trial of President Trump, he got the 
label undecided, he was then hounded by the 
media and hammered by both sides over 
whether he would march in lockstep with 
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or wheth-
er he would vote to call more witnesses as 
the Democrats wanted. 
And horror of horrors, he was the deciding 
vote and the only one that will be remem-
bered. When he announced how he would 
vote the ‘‘more witnesses’’ movement col-
lapsed. 
Alexander now finds himself being excori-
ated by both sides. The Trump supporters 
will never forget his failure to fall in line 
and salute. The anti-Trumpers are express-
ing their disappointment. 
I’ve never been a Lamar fan. But I would 
like to make the case that he did exactly the 
right thing and he expressed the position of 
the majority of his Republican colleagues. 
He, and anyone who has been paying atten-
tion, says Trump did what he was accused of 
and what he did was wrong—inappropriate. 
But it did not rise to the level of removing 
him from office. There was no point in lis-
tening to additional witnesses and dragging 
things out. Everyone knew he was guilty. 
But if Trump is to be removed from office, 
let the voters do it. 
If you believe that Trump didn’t hold up 
aid to Ukraine or that he didn’t ask them to 
investigate Joe Biden you have surrendered 
your critical faculties or you haven’t been 
paying attention. 
Joe and Hunter Biden should be inves-
tigated. By the FBI. I understand Trump’s 
frustration that the mainstream media could 
not be counted on to investigate what should 
be disqualifying information about Biden’s 
presidential run. (In the media’s defense, 
Trump’s kids are also trading off their fa-
ther’s position.) Trump’s problem is that in-
stead of turning to the FBI he turned the 
problem over to Rudy Giuliani and a couple 
of his questionable associates, otherwise 
known as the ‘‘Gang Who Couldn’t Shoot 
Straight.’’ 
I doubt you could find 10 Republican sen-
ators who, in their heart of hearts, didn’t 
agree with Lamar’s position. Many have 
echoed his argument. But it will be Lamar 
who will take the heat. 
[From Meet the Press, Feb. 2, 2020] 
INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR LAMAR 
ALEXANDER, U.S. SENATOR FOR TENNESSEE 
Chuck Todd: Republican Senator Lamar 
Alexander of Tennessee. Senator Alexander, 
welcome back. 
Senator Lamar Alexander: Thank you, 
Chuck. 
Todd: So one of the reasons you gave in 
your release about not voting for more wit-
nesses is that—and to decide that, okay, this 
trial is over, let’s let the people decide—was 
that the election was too close. So let me 
ask you though, on the witness vote itself, 
would it be helpful for the people to decide if 
they had more information? 
Alexander: Well, I mean, if you have eight 
witnesses who say someone left the scene of 
an accident, why do you need nine? I mean, 
the question for me was, do I need more evi-
dence to conclude that the president did 
what he did? And I concluded no. So I voted. 
Todd: What do you believe he did? 
Alexander: What I believe he did. One, was 
that he called the president of Ukraine and 
asked him to become involved in inves-
tigating Joe Biden, who was— 
Todd: You believe his wrongdoing began 
there, not before? 
Alexander: I don’t know about that, but he 
admitted that. The president admitted that. 
He released the transcript. He said it on tele-
vision. The second thing was, at least in 
part, he delayed the military and other as-
sistance to Ukraine in order to encourage 
that investigation. Those are the two things 
he did. I think he shouldn’t have done it. I 
think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the 
way I’d say it, improper, crossing the line. 
And then the only question left is, who de-
cides what to do about that? 
Todd: Well, who decides what to do with 
that? 
Alexander: The people. The people is my 
conclusion. You know, it struck me really 
for the first time early last week, that we’re 
not just being asked to remove the president 
from office. We’re saying, tell him you can’t 
run in the 2020 election, which begins Mon-
day in Iowa. 
Todd: If this weren’t an election year, 
would you have looked at this differently? 
Alexander: I would have looked at it dif-
ferently and probably come to the same con-
clusion because I think what he did is a long 
way from treason, bribery, high crimes and 
misdemeanors. I don’t think it’s the kind of 
inappropriate action that the framers would 
expect the Senate to substitute its judgment 
for the people in picking a president. 
Todd: Does it wear on you though that one 
of the foundational ways that the framers 
wrote the constitution was almost fear of 
foreign interference. 
Alexander: That’s true. 
Todd: So, and here it is. 
Alexander: Well, if you hooked up with 
Ukraine to wage war on the United States, 
as the first Senator from Tennessee did, you 
could be expelled, but this wasn’t that. What 
the president should have done was, if he was 
upset about Joe Biden and his son and what 
they were doing in Ukraine, he should’ve 
called the Attorney General and told him 
that and let the Attorney General handle it 
the way they always handle cases that in-
volve public things. 
Todd: Why you think he didn’t do that? 
Alexander: Maybe he didn’t know to do it. 
Todd: Okay. This has been a rationale that 
I’ve heard from a lot of Republicans. Well 
boy, he’s still new to this. 
Alexander: Well, a lot of people come to 
Washington— 
Todd: At what point though, is he no 
longer new to this? 
Alexander: The bottom line is not an ex-
cuse. He shouldn’t have done it. And I said he 
shouldn’t have done it and now I think it’s 
up to the American people to say, okay, good 
economy, lower taxes, conservative judges, 
behavior that I might not like, call to 
Ukraine. And weigh that against Elizabeth 
Warren and Bernie Sanders and pick a presi-
dent. 
Todd: Are you at all concerned though 
when you seek foreign interference? He does 
not believe he’s done anything wrong. That 
what has happened here might encourage 
him that he can continue to do this? 
Alexander: I don’t think so. I hope not. I 
mean, enduring an impeachment is some-
thing that nobody should like. Even the 
president said he didn’t want that on his re-
sume. I don’t blame him. So, if a call like 
that gets you an impeachment, I would 
think he would think twice before he did it 
again. 
Todd: What example in the life of Donald 
Trump has he been chastened? 
Alexander: I haven’t studied his life that 
close, but, like most people who survive to 
make it to the Presidency, he’s sure of him-
self. But hopefully he’ll look at this and say, 
okay, that was a mistake I shouldn’t have 
done that, shouldn’t have done it that way. 
And he’ll focus on the strengths of his Ad-
ministration, which are considerable. 
Todd: Abuse of power, define it. 
Alexander: Well, that’s the problem with 
abuse of power. As Professor Dershowitz said 
during his argument, he had a list of 40 presi-
dents who’d been accused of abuse of power 
from Washington to Obama. So it’s too 
vague a standard to use to impeach a presi-
dent. And the founders didn’t use it. I mean, 
they said, I mean, think of what a high bar 
they set. They said treason, bribery, high 
crimes or misdemeanors. And then they said 
Todd: What do you think they meant by 
misdemeanors? Violation of a public trust. 
Alexander: At the time they used it, mis-
demeanor meant a different thing in Great 
Britain. But I think Dershowitz was right. It 
was something akin to treason, bribery and 
other high crimes and misdemeanors, very 
high. And then in addition to that, two 
thirds of us in the Senate have to agree to 
that, which is very hard to do, which is why 
we’ve never removed a president this way in 
230 years. 
Todd: One of your other reasonings was the 
partisan nature of the impeachment vote 
itself in the House. Except now we are an-
swering a partisan impeachment vote in the 
House with a partisan, I guess, I don’t know 
what we would call this right now. 
Alexander: Well you all it acquittal. That’s 
what happens. 
Todd: An acquittal, but essentially also, on 
how the trial was run—a partisan way from

the trial. So, if we make bipartisanship a 
standard, if somebody has a stranglehold on 
a base of a political party, then what you’re 
saying is, you can overcome any impeach-
able offense as long as you have this stran-
glehold on a group of people. 
Alexander: Well, as far as what the Senate 
did, I thought we gave a good hearing to the 
case. I mean, I help make sure that we didn’t 
dismiss it. We heard it. There were some who 
wanted to dismiss it. I helped make sure that 
we had a right to ask for more evidence if we 
needed it, which we thought we didn’t. We 
heard, we saw videotapes of 192 times that 
witnesses testified. We sat there for 11 and 12 
hour days for nine days. So, I think we heard 
the case pretty well, but the partisan points, 
the most important point to me, James 
Madison, others thought there never, ever 
should be a wholly partisan impeachment. 
And if you look at Nixon, when the vote that 
authorized that inquiry was 410 to four and 
you look at Trump, where not a single Re-
publican voted for it. If you start out with a 
partisan impeachment, you’re almost des-
tined to have a partisan acquittal. 
Todd: Alright, but what do you do if you 
have somebody who has the ability to essen-
tially be a populist? You know, be somebody 
who is able to say it’s fake news. It’s deep 
state. Don’t trust this. Don’t trust that. The 
establishment is doing this. And so don’t 
worry about truth anymore. Don’t worry 
about what you hear over there. I mean, 
some may say I’m painting an accurate pic-
ture. Some may be saying I’m painting a 
radical picture. But how do you prevent 
that? 
Alexander: Well, the way you prevent that 
in our system, according to the Declaration 
of Independence, is we have duly elected 
presidents with the consent of the governed. 
So we vote them out of office. The other 
thing we do is, as in the Nixon case, Nixon 
had just been elected big in 1972 big time, 
only lost only one state, I think. But then a 
consensus developed, a bipartisan consensus, 
that what he was doing was wrong. And then 
when they found the crimes, he only had 10 
or 12 votes that would have kept him in the 
Senate. So he quit. So those are the two op-
tions you have. 
Todd: Have we essentially eliminated im-
peachment as a tool for a first-term presi-
dent? 
Alexander: No, I don’t think so. I think im-
peachment as a tool should be rarely used 
and it’s never been used in 230 years to re-
move a president. There been 63 impeach-
ments, eight convictions. They’re all federal 
judges on a lower standard. 
Todd: Does it bother you that the presi-
dent’s lead lawyer, Pat Cipollone, is now fin-
gered as being in the room with John Bolton 
the first time the president asked John 
Bolton to call the new President of Ukraine 
and have him take a meeting with Rudy 
Giuliani? And I say that because Pat 
Cipollone is up there arguing that there’s no 
direct evidence and yet, he may have been a 
firsthand witness. 
Alexander: Well, it doesn’t have anything 
to do with my decision because my decision 
was, did the president do it, what he’s 
charged with? He wasn’t charged with a 
crime. He was charged with two things. And 
my conclusion was, he did do that and I don’t 
need any more evidence to prove it. That 
doesn’t have anything to do with where 
Cipollone was. 
Todd: No, I say that does it only reinforce 
what some believe is that the White House 
was disingenuous about this the whole time. 
They’ve 
been 
disingenuous 
about 
how 
they’ve handled subpoenas from the House or 
requests from the House. 
Alexander: I don’t agree with that Chuck, 
either. The fact of the matter is in the Nixon 
case, the House voted 410 to four to authorize 
an inquiry. That means that it authorized 
subpoenas by the judiciary committee for 
impeachment. This House never did that. 
And so, all the subpoenas that they asked for 
were not properly authorized. That’s the rea-
son that the president didn’t respond to 
them. 
Todd: Bill Clinton offered regret for his be-
havior. This president has not. Does that 
bother you? 
Alexander: Well, there hasn’t been a vote 
yet either, so we’ll see what he says and 
does. I think that’s up to him. 
Todd: You’re comfortable acquitting him 
before he says something of regret. Would 
that not, would that not help make your ac-
quittal vote? 
Alexander: Well, I wasn’t asked to decide 
who says his level of regret. I was asked, did 
he make a phone call and did he, at least in 
part, hold up aid in order to influence an in-
vestigation of Joe Biden? I concluded yes. So 
I don’t need to assess his level of regret. 
What I hope he would do is when he makes 
his State of the Union address, that he puts 
this completely behind him, never mentions 
it and talks about what he thinks he’s done 
for the country and where we’re headed. He’s 
got a pretty good story to tell. If he’ll focus 
on it. 
Todd: You’re one of the few people that de-
tailed what you believe he did wrong. One of 
the few Republicans that have accepted the 
facts as they were presented. Mitt Romney 
was just uninvited from CPAC. Mike Pompeo 
can’t speak freely in talking about Maria 
Bonovich, the ousted ambassador. Is there 
room for dissent in the Republican party 
right now? 
Alexander: Well, I believe there is. I mean, 
I dissent when I need to. Whether it’s on— 
Todd: —not easy though right now, is it? 
Alexander: Well, I voted in a way that not 
everybody appreciated on immigration. Just 
before I was reelected, I voted against the 
president’s decision to use what I thought 
was unauthorized money to build a wall, 
even though I think we need the wall. I said, 
I thought he did it this past week and we’ll 
vote to acquit him. So I’m very comfortable 
saying what I believe. And I think others can 
as well. 
Todd: You know, in that phone call, there’s 
one thing on the phone call that I’m sur-
prised frankly, hasn’t been brought up more 
by others. It’s the mere mention of the word, 
CrowdStrike is a Russian intelligence sort of 
piece of propaganda that they’ve been circu-
lating. Does it bother you that the President 
of United States is reiterating Russian prop-
aganda? 
Alexander: Yes. I think that’s a mistake. I 
mean if you, see what’s happening in the 
Baltic States where Russians have a big 
warehouse in St. Petersburg in Russia where 
they’re devoted to destabilizing Western de-
mocracies. I mean, for example, in one of the 
Baltic States, they accused a NATO officer 
of raping a local girl—of course it didn’t hap-
pen, but it threw the government in a com-
plete disarray for a week. So I think we need 
to be sensitive to the fact that the Russians 
are out to do no good to destabilize Western 
democracies, including us. And be very wary 
of theories that Russians come up with and 
peddle. 
Todd: Well, I was just going to say this, is 
it not alarming? The President of United 
States in this phone call and you clearly are 
judging him on the phone, more so than, 
Alexander: Well the phone call and the evi-
dence. There was plenty of evidence. I mean 
the House managers came to us and said, we 
have overwhelming evidence. We have a 
mountain of evidence and we approve it be-
yond a shadow of a doubt. Which made me 
think, well then why do you need more evi-
dence? 
Todd: Do you think it’s more helpful for 
the public to hear from John Bolton? 
Alexander: They’ll read his book in two 
weeks. 
Todd: You don’t want to see him testify. 
Alexander: Well, if the question is do I 
need more evidence to think the president 
did it, the answer is no. I guess I’m coming 
back to this issue—if you looked at it as an 
isolated incident, here he is using Russian 
propaganda in order to try to talk to this 
new president of Ukraine. That’s alarming. 
Where is he getting this CrowdStrike propa-
ganda. My view is that that is Russian prop-
aganda. Maybe he has information that I 
didn’t have. 
Todd: Okay. Are you definitely voting to 
acquit or do you think you may vote 
present? 
Alexander: No question. I’m going to vote 
to acquit. I’m very concerned about any ac-
tion that we could take that would establish 
a perpetual impeachment in the House of 
Representatives whenever the House was a 
different party than the president. That 
would immobilize the Senate. You know, we 
have to take those articles, stop what we’re 
doing, sit in our chairs for 11 hours a day for 
three or four weeks and consider it. And it 
would immobilize the presidency. So I don’t 
want a situation—and the framers didn’t ei-
ther—where a partisan majority in the house 
of either party can stop the government. 
Todd: You used the phrase ‘‘pour gasoline 
on a fire.’’ 
Alexander: Yeah. 
Todd: It certainly struck home with me 
reading you saying something that I’ve been 
thinking long and hard about. How con-
cerned are you about the democracy as it 
stands right now? 
Alexander: Well, I’m concerned and I want 
to give credit to Marco Rubio because that’s 
really his phrase. I borrowed it from him— 
pouring gasoline on the cultural fires. 
Todd: He went a step further. He said this 
was an impeachable offense, but he was un-
comfortable in an election year. 
Alexander: But, I’m concerned about the 
divisions in the country. They’re reflected in 
the Senate. They make it harder to get a re-
sult. I mean, I work pretty hard to get re-
sults on healthcare, making it easier to go to 
college. And we’ve had some real success 
with it. But the Senate is for the purpose of 
solving big problems that the country will 
accept. And that goes back to what happened 
this past week. The country would not have 
accepted the Senate saying to it, you can’t 
vote for or against President Trump in the 
Iowa caucus, New Hampshire primary, or the 
election this year. 
Todd: Are you glad you’re leaving? 
Alexander: No, I’ve really loved being in 
the Senate, but it’s time for me to go on, 
turn the page, think of something else to do. 
It’ll be my third permanent retirement. 
Todd: You’ve retired a few times, is this 
one going to stick? 
Alexander: Well, we’ll see. 
Todd: Senator Lamar Alexander, Repub-
lican from Tennessee, our always thoughtful 
guest. Thanks for coming on. 
Alexander: Thank you, Chuck.

S882 
February 5, 2020 
[From the Omaha World Herald, Feb. 4, 2020] 
MIDLANDS VOICES: OPEN LETTER FROM BEN 
SASSE PRESENTS HIS TAKE ON IMPEACHMENT 
(By Ben Sasse) 
Impeachment is serious. It’s the ‘‘Break 
Glass in Case of Emergency’’ provision of the 
Constitution. 
I plan to vote against removing the presi-
dent, and I write to explain this decision to 
the Nebraskans on both sides who have advo-
cated so passionately. 
An impeachment trial requires senators to 
carry out two responsibilities: We’re jurors 
sworn to ‘‘do impartial justice.’’ We’re also 
elected officeholders responsible for pro-
moting the civic welfare of the country. We 
must consider both the facts before us, and 
the long-term effects of the verdict rendered. 
I believe removal is the wrong decision. 
Let’s start with the facts of the case. It’s 
clear that the president had mixed motives 
in his decision to temporarily withhold mili-
tary aid from Ukraine. The line between per-
sonal and public was not firmly safeguarded. 
But it is important to understand, whether 
one agrees with him or not, three things 
President Trump believes: 
He believes foreign aid is almost always a 
bad deal for America. I don’t believe this, 
but he has maintained this position consist-
ently since the 1980s. 
He believes the American people need to 
know the 2016 election was legitimate, and 
he believes it’s dangerous if they worry Rus-
sia picked America’s president. About this, 
he’s right. 
He believes the Crowdstrike theory of 2016, 
that Ukraine conducted significant meddling 
in our election. I don’t believe this theory, 
but the president has heard it repeatedly 
from people he trusts, chiefly Rudy Giuliani, 
and he believes it. 
These beliefs have consequences. When the 
president 
spoke 
to 
Ukraine’s 
president 
Zelensky in July 2019, he seems to have be-
lieved he was doing something that was si-
multaneously good for America, and good for 
himself politically—namely, reinforcing the 
legitimacy of his 2016 victory. It is worth re-
membering that that phone call occurred 
just days after Robert Mueller’s two-year in-
vestigation into the 2016 election concluded 
that ‘‘the investigation did not establish 
that members of the Trump Campaign con-
spired or coordinated with the Russian gov-
ernment in its election interference activi-
ties.’’ 
This is not a blanket excuse, of course. 
Some of the president’s lawyers have admit-
ted that the way the administration con-
ducted policymaking toward Ukraine was 
wrong. I agree. The call with Zelensky was 
certainly not ‘‘perfect,’’ and the president’s 
defense was made weaker by staking out 
that unrepentant position. 
Moreover, Giuliani’s off-the-books foreign 
policy-making is unacceptable, and his role 
in walking the president into this airplane 
propeller 
is 
underappreciated: 
His 
Crowdstrike theory was a bonkers attempt 
not only to validate Trump’s 2016 election, 
and to flip the media’s narrative of Russian 
interference, but also to embarrass a possible 
opponent. One certainty from this episode is 
that America’s Mayor shouldn’t be any 
president’s lawyer. It’s time for the presi-
dent and adults on his team to usher Rudy 
off the stage—and to ensure that we do not 
normalize rogue foreign policy conducted by 
political operatives with murky financial in-
terests. 
There is no need to hear from any 18th im-
peachment witness, beyond the 17 whose tes-
timony the Senate reviewed, to confirm facts 
we already know. Even if one concedes that 
John Bolton’s entire testimony would sup-
port Adam Schiff’s argument, this doesn’t 
add to the reality already established: The 
aid delay was wrong. 
But in the end, the president wasn’t se-
duced by the most malign voices; his honest 
advisers made sure Ukraine got the aid the 
law required. And importantly, this hap-
pened three weeks before the legal deadline. 
To repeat: The president’s official staff re-
peatedly prevailed upon him, Ukraine ulti-
mately got the money, and no political in-
vestigation was initiated or announced. 
You don’t remove a president for initially 
listening to bad advisors but eventually tak-
ing counsel from better advisors—which is 
precisely what happened here. 
There is another prudential question, 
though, beyond the facts of the case: What is 
the right thing for the long-term civic health 
of our country? Will America be more stable 
in 2030 if the Senate—nine months from Elec-
tion Day 2020—removes the president? 
In our Constitution’s 232 years, no presi-
dent has ever been removed from office by 
the Senate. Today’s debate comes at a time 
when our institutions of self-government are 
suffering a profound crisis of legitimacy, on 
both sides of the aisle. This is not a new cri-
sis since 2016; its sources run much deeper 
and longer. 
We need to shore up trust. A reckless re-
moval would do the opposite, setting the na-
tion on fire. Half of the citizenry—tens of 
millions who intended to elect a disruptive 
outsider—would conclude that D.C. insiders 
overruled their vote, overturned an election 
and struck their preferred candidate from 
the ballot. 
This one-party removal attempt leaves 
America more bitterly divided. It makes it 
more likely that impeachment, intended as a 
tool of last resort for the most serious presi-
dential crimes, becomes just another bludg-
eon in the bag of tricks for the party out of 
power. And more Americans will conclude 
that constitutional self-government today is 
nothing more than partisan bloodsport. 
We must do better. Our kids deserve bet-
ter. Most of the restoration and healing will 
happen far from Washington, of course. But 
this week, senators have an important role: 
Get out of the way, and allow the American 
people to render their verdict on election 
day. 
Mr. SASSE. Thank you. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from California. 
Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, when 
the Framers wrote the Constitution, 
they didn’t think someone like me 
would serve as a U.S. Senator, but they 
did 
envision 
someone 
like 
Donald 
Trump being President of the United 
States, someone who thinks he is above 
the law and that rules don’t apply to 
him. So they made sure our democracy 
had the tool of impeachment to stop 
that kind of abuse of power. 
The House managers have clearly 
laid out a compelling case and evidence 
of Donald Trump’s misconduct. They 
have shown that the President of the 
United States of America withheld 
military aid and a coveted White House 
meeting for his political gain. He want-
ed a foreign country to announce—not 
actually conduct, announce—an inves-
tigation into his political rivals. Then 
he refused to comply with congres-
sional investigations into his mis-
conduct. Unfortunately, a majority of 
U.S. Senators, even those who concede 
that what Donald Trump did was 
wrong, are nonetheless going to refuse 
to hold him accountable. 
The Senate trial of Donald Trump 
has been a miscarriage of justice. Don-
ald Trump is going to get away with 
abusing his position of power for per-
sonal gain, abusing his position of 
power to stop Congress from looking 
into his misconduct and falsely claim 
he has been exonerated. He is going to 
escape accountability because a major-
ity of Senators have decided to let him. 
They voted repeatedly to block key 
evidence like witnesses and documents 
that could have shed light on the full 
truth. 
We must recognize that still in 
America there are two systems of jus-
tice—one for the powerful and another 
for everyone else. So let’s speak the 
truth about what our two systems of 
justice actually mean in the real world. 
It means that in our country too many 
people walk into courthouses and face 
systemic bias. Too often they lack ade-
quate legal representation, whether 
they are overworked, underpaid, or 
both. It means that a young man 
named Emmett Till was falsely ac-
cused and then murdered, but his mur-
derer didn’t have to spend a day in jail. 
It means that four young Black men 
have their lives taken and turned up-
side-down after being falsely accused of 
a crime in Groveland, FL. It means 
that, right now, too many people in 
America are sitting in jail without 
having yet been convicted of a crime 
but simply because they cannot afford 
bail. And it means that future Presi-
dents of the United States will remem-
ber that the U.S. Senate failed to hold 
Donald Trump accountable, and they 
will be emboldened to abuse their 
power knowing there will be no con-
sequence. 
Donald Trump knows all this better 
than anybody. He may not acknowl-
edge that we have two systems of jus-
tice, but he knows the institutions in 
this country, be it the courts or the 
Senate, are set up to protect powerful 
people like him. He told us as much 
when, regarding the sexual assault of 
women, he said, ‘‘When you’re a star, 
they let you do it. You can do any-
thing.’’ He said that article II of the 
U.S. Constitution gives him, as Presi-
dent, the right to do whatever he 
wants. 
Trump has shown us through his 
words and actions that he thinks he is 
above the law. And when the American 
people see the President acting as 
though he is above the law, it under-
standably leaves them feeling distrust-
ful of our system of justice, distrustful 
of our democracy. When the U.S. Sen-
ate refuses to hold him accountable, it 
reinforces that loss of trust in our sys-
tem. 
Now, I am under no illusion that this 
body is poised to hold this President 
accountable, but despite the conduct of 
the U.S. Senate in this impeachment 
trial, the American people must con-
tinue to strive toward the more perfect 
Union that our Constitution promises. 
It is going to take all of us—in every 
State, every town, everywhere—to con-
tinue fighting for the best of who we

are as a country. We each have an im-
portant role to play in fighting for 
those words inscribed on the U.S. Su-
preme Court building: ‘‘Equal Justice 
Under Law.’’ 
Frederick 
Douglass, 
who 
I, 
like 
many, consider to be one of the Found-
ers of our Nation, wrote that ‘‘the 
whole history of the progress of human 
liberty shows that all concessions yet 
made to her august claims have been 
born of earnest struggle.’’ 
The impeachment of Donald Trump 
has been one of those earnest struggles 
for liberty, and this fight, like so many 
before it, has been a fight against tyr-
anny. This struggle has not been an 
easy one, and it has left too many peo-
ple across our Nation feeling cynical. 
For too many people, this trial con-
firmed something they have always 
known, that the real power in this 
country lies not with them but with 
just a few people who advance their 
own interests at the expense of others’ 
needs. For many, the injustice in this 
trial is yet another example of the way 
that our system of justice has worked 
or, more accurately, failed to work. 
But here is the thing. Frederick 
Douglass also told us that ‘‘if there is 
no struggle, there is no progress.’’ He 
went on to say: ‘‘Power concedes noth-
ing without a demand.’’ And he said: 
‘‘It never did, and it never will.’’ 
In order to wrestle power away from 
the few people at the very top who 
abuse their power, the American people 
are going to have to fight for the voice 
of the people and the power of the peo-
ple. We must go into the darkness to 
shine a light, and we cannot be de-
terred and we cannot be overwhelmed 
and we cannot ever give up on our 
country. 
We cannot ever give up on the ideals 
that are the foundation for our system 
of democracy. We can never give up on 
the meaning of true justice. And it is 
part of our history, our past, clearly, 
our present, and our future that, in 
order to make these values real, in 
order to make the promise of our coun-
try real, we can never take it for grant-
ed. 
There will be moments in time, in 
history, where we experience incredible 
disappointment, but the greatest dis-
appointment of all will be if we give 
up. We cannot ever give up fighting for 
who we know we are, and we must al-
ways see who we can be, unburdened by 
who we have been. That is the strength 
of our Nation. 
So, after the Senate votes today, 
Donald Trump will want the American 
people to feel cynical. He will want us 
not to care. He will want us to think 
that he is all powerful and we have no 
power, but we are not going to let him 
get away with that. 
We are not going to give him what he 
wants because the true power and po-
tential of the United States of America 
resides not with the President but with 
the people—all the people. 
So, in our long struggle for justice, I 
will do my part by voting to convict 
this lawless President and remove him 
from office, and I urge my colleagues 
to join me on the right side of history. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, consid-
ering whether to convict a President of 
the United States on Articles of Im-
peachment is a solemn and consequen-
tial duty, and I do not take it lightly. 
Even before we had a country, our 
Founders put forward the notion of 
‘‘country first,’’ pledging in the Dec-
laration of Independence their lives, 
fortunes, and sacred honor—a pledge 
they made to an idea, imagining and 
hoping for a country where no one was 
above the law, where no one had abso-
lute power. 
My dad, a World War II veteran, and 
my mom raised me to understand that 
this is what made our country the 
unique and indispensable democracy 
that it is. 
My obligation throughout this proc-
ess has been to listen carefully to the 
case that the House managers put for-
ward and the defenses asserted by the 
President’s lawyers, and then to care-
fully consider the constitutional basis 
for impeachment, the intent of our 
Founders, and the facts. 
That is what I have done over the 
past few days. The Senate heard exten-
sive presentations from both sides and 
answers to the almost 200 questions 
that Senators posed to the House man-
agers and the President’s advocates. 
The facts clearly showed that Presi-
dent Trump abused the public’s sacred 
trust by using taxpayer dollars to ex-
tort a foreign government into pro-
viding misinformation about a feared 
political opponent. 
Let me repeat that. The President of 
the United States used taxpayer money 
that had been authorized, obligated, 
and cleared for delivery as critical 
military aid to Ukraine to try to force 
that country to interfere in our elec-
tions. He violated the law and the pub-
lic trust. And he put our national secu-
rity, and the lives of the Ukrainian sol-
diers on the frontlines of Russian ag-
gression at risk. 
Although the country was alerted to 
the possibility that the President had 
crossed a critical line because of rev-
elations about his now-infamous July 
25 phone call, it is not the phone call 
alone that led to the President’s im-
peachment. Instead, the phone call was 
a pivotal point in a scheme that had 
started earlier, spearheaded by Presi-
dent Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy 
Giuliani. 
Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged that 
he was doing the President’s personal 
and political bidding when he engaged 
with the Ukrainian government. 
As the newly elected anti-corruption 
Ukrainian 
Government 
came 
into 
power, in need of recognition and sup-
port from the United States, President 
Trump forced officials from Ukraine 
and the United States to negotiate 
through Mr. Giuliani, conflating his 
personal and political interests with 
the national security and diplomatic 
interests of our country. 
And then, as President Zelensky re-
sisted the request that he concoct and 
announce a fake investigation into the 
Bidens, the President and Mr. Giuliani 
increased the pressure. Suddenly, and 
without explanation or a legally re-
quired notification to Congress, the 
President ordered that previously ap-
proved and critically needed military 
aid to Ukraine be held up. 
Mr. Trump, at first through Mr. 
Giuliani, and then directly, solicited 
interference with an American election 
from a foreign government. And he or-
dered others in his administration to 
work with Mr. Giuliani to ensure this 
scheme’s success. 
While there is still more evidence 
that the Senate should have subpoe-
naed both witnesses and documents 
that would have given us a more com-
plete understanding of what happened, 
we know as much as we do because of 
the courage and strength of American 
patriots who put country before self— 
patriots like the intelligence commu-
nity whistleblower, who was followed 
by Army Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, 
and 
former 
U.S. 
Ambassadors 
to 
Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and Wil-
liam Taylor, as well as current mem-
bers of the administration. 
These Americans who came forward 
were doing exactly what we always ask 
of citizens: If you see something wrong, 
you need to speak up; ‘‘See something, 
say something.’’ It is a fundamental 
part of citizenship to alert each other 
to danger, to act for the greater good, 
to care about each other and our coun-
try without regard to political party. 
When Americans step forward, some-
times at real risk to themselves, they 
rightly expect that their government 
will take the information they provide 
and act to make them safer, to protect 
their fundamental rights. That is the 
understanding between the American 
people and their representative govern-
ment. 
While the brave women and men who 
appeared before the House did their 
jobs, the Senate, under this majority, 
has unfortunately not. Rather than 
gathering 
full, 
relevant 
testimony 
under oath and with the benefit of 
cross-examination, the Senate major-
ity has apparently decided that despite 
what it has heard, it is not interested 
in learning more; not interested in 
learning more about how a President, 
his personal agent, and members of his 
administration corrupted our foreign 
policy and put our Nation’s security at 
risk; not interested in learning more 
about how they planned to use the 
power of his office to tilt the scales of 
the next election to ensure that he 
stays in power; not interested in learn-
ing more about how they worked to 
cover it up. 
Increasingly, over the last few days, 
the President’s defense team and more 
and more of my colleagues in the Sen-
ate have acknowledged the facts of the

President’s scheme. Their argument 
has shifted from ‘‘He didn’t do it’’ to 
‘‘He had a right to,’’ to ‘‘He won’t do it 
again,’’ or even ‘‘It doesn’t really mat-
ter.’’ 
I disagree so strongly. 
The idea that in our country, estab-
lished by the very rejection of a mon-
archy, 
the 
President 
has 
absolute 
power is absurd, as is the idea that this 
President, whose conduct is ultimately 
the cause of this entire process, will 
suddenly stop. President Trump con-
tinues to invite foreign powers to 
interfere with our elections, maintain-
ing to this day that ‘‘it was a perfect 
call.’’ 
Our Founders knew that all people, 
all leaders, are fallible human beings. 
And they knew that our system of 
checks and balances could survive 
some level of human frailty, even in as 
important an office as the Presidency. 
The one thing that they feared it 
could not survive was a President who 
would put self-interest before the inter-
ests of the American people or who 
didn’t understand the difference be-
tween the two. As citizen-in-chief, and 
one wielding enormous power, Presi-
dents must put country first. 
Our Founders knew that we needed a 
mechanism to hold Presidents account-
able for behavior that violated that 
basic understanding and that would 
threaten our democracy. And they pro-
vided a mechanism for removal outside 
of the election process because of the 
immense damage a President could do 
in the time between elections—dam-
age, in the case of this President’s con-
tinuing behavior, to our national secu-
rity and election integrity. 
Our Founders believed that they were 
establishing a country that would be 
unique in the history of humankind, a 
country that would be indispensable, 
built on the rule of law, not the whims 
of a ruler. Generation after generation 
of Americans have fought for that vi-
sion because of what it has meant to 
our individual and collective success 
and to the progress of humankind 
worldwide. 
That is the America that I have 
sworn an oath to protect. I will vote in 
favor of both Articles of Impeachment 
because the President’s conduct re-
quires it, Congress’s responsibility as a 
coequal branch of government requires 
it, and the very foundation and secu-
rity of our American idea requires it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, on the 
day I was sworn in as a United States 
Senator, I took an oath to protect and 
defend the Constitution. Just last 
month, at the beginning of the im-
peachment trial, I took a second oath 
to do fair and impartial justice, accord-
ing to the same Constitution I swore to 
protect. 
As I took the oath and throughout 
the impeachment trial, I couldn’t help 
but think of my father. As many of you 
know, I lost my dad over the holiday 
recess. While so many were arguing 
over whether or not the Speaker of the 
House should send Articles of Impeach-
ment to the Senate, I was struggling 
with watching him slip away, while 
only occasionally trying to weigh in 
with my voice to be heard about the 
need for witnesses in the upcoming im-
peachment trial. My dad was a great 
man, a loving husband, father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather who did 
his best to instill in me the values of 
right and wrong as I grew up in Fair-
field, AL. He was also a fierce patriot 
who loved this country. Although, for-
tunately, he was never called on to do 
so, I firmly believe he would have 
placed his country even above his fam-
ily because he knew and understood 
fully what America and the freedoms 
and liberties that come with her mean 
to everyone in this great country and, 
significantly, to people around the 
world. 
I know he would have put his country 
before any allegiance to any political 
party or even to any President. He was 
on the younger side of that ‘‘greatest 
generation’’ who joined the Navy at 
age 17 to serve our great military. That 
service and love of country shaped him 
into the man of principle that he was, 
instilling in me those same principles. 
In thinking of him, his patriotism, his 
principles, and how he raised me, I am 
reminded of Robert Kennedy’s words 
that were mentioned in this trial: 
Few men are willing to brave the dis-
approval of their fellows, the censure of their 
colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral 
courage is a rarer commodity than bravery 
in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the 
one essential, vital quality for those who 
seek to change a world that yields most 
painfully to change. 
Candidly, to my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, I fear that moral 
courage, country before party is a rare 
commodity these days. We can write 
about it and talk about it in speeches 
and in the media, but it is harder to 
put into action when political careers 
may be on the line. Nowhere is the di-
lemma more difficult than in an im-
peachment of the President of the 
United States. Very early on in this 
process, I implored my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, in both Houses 
of Congress, to stay out of their polit-
ical and partisan corners. Many did, 
but so many did not. Even the media 
continually view this entire process 
through partisan, political eyes and 
how it may or may not affect an elec-
tion. That is unfortunate. The country 
deserves better, and we must find a 
way to move beyond such partisan di-
vides. 
The solemn oaths that I have taken 
have been my guides during what has 
been a difficult time for the country, 
my State, and for me personally. I did 
not run for the Senate hoping to par-
ticipate in the impeachment trial of a 
duly elected President, but I cannot 
and will not shrink from my duty to 
defend the Constitution and to do im-
partial justice. 
In keeping with my oath as Senator 
and my oath to do impartial justice, I 
resolved that throughout this process, 
I would keep an open mind, to consider 
the evidence without regard to polit-
ical affiliation, and to hear all of the 
evidence before making a final decision 
on either charge against the President. 
I believe that my votes later today will 
reflect that commitment. 
With the eyes of history upon us, I 
am acutely aware of the precedents 
that this impeachment trial will set for 
future Presidencies and Congresses. 
Unfortunately, I do not believe that 
those precedents are good ones. I am 
particularly concerned that we have 
now set a precedent that the Senate 
does not have to go forward with wit-
nesses or review documents, even when 
those witnesses have firsthand infor-
mation and the documents would allow 
us to test not just the credibility of 
witnesses but also test the words of 
counsel of both parties. 
It is my firm belief that the Amer-
ican people deserve more. In short, wit-
nesses and documents would provide 
the Senate and the American people 
with a more complete picture of the 
truth. I believe the American people 
deserve nothing less. 
That is not to say, however, that 
there is not sufficient evidence in 
which to render a judgment. There is. 
As a trial lawyer, I once explained this 
process to a jury as like putting to-
gether the pieces of a puzzle. When you 
open the box and spread all the pieces 
on the table, it is just an incoherent 
jumble. But one by one, you hold those 
pieces up, and you hold them next to 
each other and see what fits and what 
doesn’t. Even if, as was often the case 
in my house growing up, you are miss-
ing 
a 
few 
pieces—even 
important 
ones—you more often than not see the 
picture. 
As I have said many times, I believe 
the American people deserve to see a 
completed puzzle, a picture with all of 
the pieces—pieces in the form of docu-
ments and witnesses with relevant, 
firsthand information, which would 
have provided valuable context, cor-
roboration, or contradiction to that 
which we have heard. But even with 
missing pieces, our common sense and 
life’s experiences allow us to see the 
picture as it comes into full view. 
Throughout the trial, one piece of 
evidence continued to stand out for me. 
It was the President’s statement that 
under the Constitution, ‘‘we have Arti-
cle II, and I can do anything I want.’’ 
That seems to capture this President’s 
belief about the Presidency; that he 
has unbridled power, unchecked by 
Congress or the Judiciary or anyone 
else. That view, dangerous as it is, ex-
plains the President’s actions toward 
Ukraine and Congress. 
The sum of what we have seen and 
heard is, unfortunately, a picture of a 
President who has abused the great 
power of his office for personal gain—a 
picture of a President who has placed 
his personal interest well above the in-
terests of the Nation and, in so doing,

February 5, 2020 
threatened our national security, the 
security of our European allies, and the 
security of Ukraine. The evidence 
clearly proves that the President used 
the weight of his office and the weight 
of the U.S. Government to seek to co-
erce a foreign government to interfere 
in our election for his personal polit-
ical benefit. His actions were more 
than simply inappropriate; they were 
an abuse of power. 
When I was a lawyer for the Alabama 
Judicial Inquiry Commission, there 
was a saying that the chairman of the 
inquiry commission and one of Ala-
bama’s great judges, Randall Cole, used 
to say about judges who strayed from 
the canons of ethics. He would say that 
the judge ‘‘left his post.’’ 
Sadly, President Trump left his post 
with regard to the withholding of mili-
tary aid to Ukraine and a White House 
visit for the new Ukrainian President, 
and in so doing, he took the great pow-
ers of the Office of the President of the 
United States with him. Impeachment 
is the only check on such Presidential 
wrongdoing. 
The second article of impeachment, 
obstruction of Congress, gave me more 
pause. I have struggled to understand 
the House’s strategy in their failure to 
fully pursue documents and witnesses 
and wished that they had done more. 
However, after careful consideration of 
the evidence developed in the hearings, 
the public disclosures, the legal prece-
dents, and the trial, I believe that the 
President deliberately and unconsti-
tutionally obstructed Congress by re-
fusing to cooperate with the investiga-
tion in any way. While I am sensitive 
to protecting the privileges and immu-
nities afforded to the President and his 
advisers, I believe it is critical to our 
constitutional structure that we also 
protect the authorities of the Congress 
of the United States. Here it was clear 
from the outset that the President had 
no intention whatsoever of accommo-
dating Congress when he blocked both 
witnesses and documents from being 
produced. In addition, he engaged in a 
course of conduct to threaten potential 
witnesses and smear the reputations of 
the civil servants who did come for-
ward and provide testimony. 
The President’s actions demonstrate 
a belief that he is above the law, that 
Congress has no power whatsoever in 
questioning or examining his actions, 
and that all who do so, do so at their 
peril. That belief, unprecedented in the 
history of this country, simply must 
not be permitted to stand. To do other-
wise risks guaranteeing that no future 
whistleblower or witness will ever 
come forward, and no future President, 
Republican or Democrat, will be sub-
ject to congressional oversight as man-
dated by the Constitution even when 
the President has so clearly abused his 
office and violated the public trust. 
Accordingly, I will vote to convict 
the President on both Articles of Im-
peachment. In doing so, I am mindful 
that in a democracy there is nothing 
more sacred than the right to vote and 
respecting the will of the people. But I 
am also mindful that when our Found-
ers wrote the Constitution, they envi-
sioned a time or at least a possibility 
that our democracy would be more 
damaged if we fail to impeach and re-
move a President. Such is the moment 
in history that we face today. 
The gravity of this moment, the seri-
ousness of the charges, and the impli-
cation for future Presidencies and Con-
gress have all contributed to the dif-
ficulty at which I arrived at my deci-
sion. 
I am mindful that I am standing at a 
desk that once was used by John F. 
Kennedy, who famously wrote ‘‘Pro-
files in Courage,’’ and there will be so 
many who simply look at what I am 
doing today and say that it is a profile 
in courage. It is not. It is simply a 
matter of right and wrong, where doing 
right is not a courageous act; it is sim-
ply following your oath. 
This has been a divisive time for our 
country, but I think it has nonetheless 
been an important constitutional proc-
ess for us to follow. As this chapter of 
history draws to a close, one thing is 
clear to me. As I have said before, our 
country deserves better than this. 
They deserve better from the Presi-
dent, and they deserve better from the 
Congress. We must find a way to come 
together, to set aside partisan dif-
ferences, and to focus on what we have 
in common as Americans. 
While so much is going in our favor 
these days, we still face great chal-
lenges, both domestically and inter-
nationally. But it remains my firm be-
lief that united we can conquer them 
and remain the greatest hope for the 
people around the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the 
Senate is called upon to uphold our 
oath of office and our duty to the Con-
stitution 
because 
President 
Trump 
failed to do so himself. 
After listening closely to the im-
peachment managers and the Presi-
dent’s defense team, weighing the evi-
dence that was presented to us, and 
being denied the opportunity to see rel-
evant documents and hear from first-
hand witnesses, I will vote to find 
President Trump guilty on both Arti-
cles of Impeachment. 
I take no pleasure in voting to im-
peach a President and remove him 
from office. I agree with those who say 
that impeachment should be rare and 
American voters should decide our 
elections. That is why it is so galling 
that President Trump blatantly solic-
ited foreign interference in our demo-
cratic process. And he did it as he 
geared up for reelection. 
The evidence shows President Trump 
deliberately and illicitly sought for-
eign help to manufacture a scandal 
that would elevate him by tarnishing a 
political rival. 
He attempted to undermine our de-
mocracy, using U.S. taxpayer money in 
the form of U.S. military aid for 
Ukraine as leverage for his own per-
sonal benefit. The President’s aides 
who heard President Trump’s call seek-
ing ‘‘a favor’’ from the Ukrainian 
President immediately sensed it was 
wrong. So when they alerted the White 
House lawyers, the record of the call 
was immediately placed on a highly 
classified computer system. And de-
spite the President claiming that the 
version of the call that was publicly re-
leased ‘‘is an exact word-for-word tran-
script of the conversation,’’ we know 
from testimony that there are key 
omissions in the document we all read. 
Compounding the President’s mis-
conduct, he then engaged in an ex-
tended cover up that appears to be on-
going to this day. 
There is a lot to unravel here, and I 
will provide a more detailed legal ex-
planation in the near future. But for 
now, let me briefly explain my decision 
and outline my thoughts on the Sen-
ate’s impeachment proceedings and the 
disturbing precedents I fear will be set 
when the majority chooses to side with 
the President over the Constitution’s 
checks and balances. 
The House of Representatives voted 
to impeach the President for abuse of 
power and obstruction of Congress. 
Based on the uncontested evidence, I 
concur. 
It is clear that President Trump and 
others, such as Mr. Giuliani, who was 
serving as the President’s lawyer, at-
tempted to coerce the newly elected 
President of Ukraine to announce two 
sham 
investigations, 
including 
one 
that sought to directly damage Presi-
dent Trump’s rival in the upcoming 
election. 
The 
President’s 
actions 
served his personal and political needs, 
not those of our country. His efforts to 
withhold military aid to Ukraine for 
his own personal benefit undermined 
our national security. 
The second article of impeachment 
charges the President with obstruction 
of Congress for blocking testimony and 
refusing to provide documents in re-
sponse to House subpoenas in the im-
peachment inquiry. Again, the House 
managers produced overwhelming evi-
dence of the President’s obstruction 
and his efforts to cover up his malfea-
sance. 
The President’s counsel offered a 
number 
of 
unpersuasive 
arguments 
against this article, which fail to over-
come the following: first, that the leg-
islative branch has sole power over im-
peachment 
under 
the 
Constitution. 
That could not be more clear; second, 
past precedents of prior administra-
tions and court rulings; and third, the 
blatant October 8 letter expressing a 
complete rejection of the House’s im-
peachment proceedings. 
The Constitution grants the execu-
tive branch significant power, but as 
every student in America learns, our 
system is one of checks and balances so 
that no branch is entirely unfettered 
from oversight and the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S886 
February 5, 2020 
President Trump would have us be-
lieve this system of checks and bal-
ances is wrong. In President Trump’s 
own words, he expressed the misguided 
imperial belief in the supremacy of his 
unchecked power, stating, quote: ‘‘I 
have an Article II, where I have the 
right to do whatever I want as Presi-
dent.’’ 
Couple this sentiment with his Janu-
ary 2016 boast that, quote: ‘‘I could 
stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue 
and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t 
lose voters.’’ That paints a chilling pic-
ture of someone who clearly believes, 
incorrectly, that he is above the law. 
The President’s attorneys have hewn 
to this line of faulty reasoning and, in 
one notably preposterous effort, even 
claimed the President could avoid im-
peachment for an inappropriate action 
motivated entirely by his own political 
and personal interests. 
The President’s defense also failed to 
sufficiently 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
President’s blanket defiance of sub-
poenas and document requests over-
comes the precedents established in 
prior impeachment proceedings and the 
record of congressional oversight of the 
executive branch. 
In the Clinton impeachment, there 
was an enormous amount of documen-
tary evidence, as well as sworn deposi-
tions and testimony by the President 
and his closest advisers. 
In the cases of United States v. 
Nixon, House Judiciary Committee v. 
Miers, and others, the House managers 
rightly point out that the courts have 
held ‘‘Congress’s power to investigate 
is as broad as its power to legislate and 
lies at the heart of Congress’s constitu-
tional role.’’ 
While President Trump’s impeach-
ment lawyers claim the House should 
take the President to court over these 
previously settled issues, President 
Trump’s lawyers at the Justice Depart-
ment are simultaneously arguing in 
the courts that the judicial branch can-
not even rule on such matters. 
As President Trump staked out new, 
expansive, and aggressive positions 
about executive privilege, immunity, 
and the limits of Congress’s oversight 
authority, Republican leaders went 
along with it. 
I have heard a variety of expla-
nations for why my Republican col-
leagues voted against witnesses. But no 
one has offered the simplest expla-
nation: My Republican colleagues did 
not want to hear new evidence because 
they have a hunch it would be really, 
really bad for this President. It would 
further expose the depth of his wrong-
doing. And it would make it harder for 
them to vote to acquit. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle did not ask to be put in this 
position. 
President 
Trump’s 
mis-
conduct forced it on them. But in the 
partisan rush to spare President Trump 
from having his staff and former staff 
publicly testify against him under 
oath, a bar has been lowered, a con-
stitutional guardrail has been removed, 
the Senate has been voluntarily weak-
ened, and our oversight powers se-
verely diminished. 
This short-term maneuver to shield 
President Trump from the truth is a 
severe blow against good government 
that will do lasting damage to this in-
stitution and our democracy. I hope 
one day the damage can be repaired. 
The arc of history is indeed long, and 
it does bend toward justice—but not 
today. Today, the Senate and the 
American people have been denied ac-
cess to relevant, available evidence and 
firsthand witnesses. We have been pro-
hibited from considering new, material 
information 
that 
became 
available 
after the House’s impeachment vote. 
The Constitution is our national 
compass. But at this critical moment, 
clouded 
by 
the 
fog 
of 
President 
Trump’s misconduct, the Senate ma-
jority has lost its way, and is no longer 
guided by the Constitution. In order to 
regain our moral bearings, stay true to 
our core values, and navigate a better 
path forward, we must hold President 
Trump accountable. 
The President was wrong to invite 
foreign interference in our democracy. 
He was wrong to try and stonewall the 
investigation. And he is wrong if he 
thinks he is above the law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 
from the first words in the Constitu-
tion, the weight that lies on every 
American’s shoulders has been clear: 
We the people are the ones who 
dreamed up this wild experiment that 
we call America, and we the people are 
the ones charged with ensuring its sur-
vival. 
That is the tension—the push and the 
pull—behind our democracy because, 
while there is no greater privilege than 
living in a country whose Constitution 
guarantees our rights, there is no 
greater burden than knowing that our 
actions could sap that very same Con-
stitution of its power; that our inac-
tion risks allowing it to wither like 
any other piece of parchment from 
some bygone era. 
For the past few weeks, it has been 
my sworn duty as a U.S. Senator to sit 
as an impartial juror in the impeach-
ment trial of Donald J. Trump. While I 
wish the President had not put our Na-
tion in this position, after having lis-
tened closely with an open mind to 
both sides, it is now my duty as an 
American to vote on whether to re-
move him from office. Other than send-
ing our troops into harm’s way, I can-
not think of a more serious, more som-
ber vote to take in this Chamber, but 
as sobering as it is, the right path for-
ward is clear. 
Throughout this trial, we have seen 
unprecedented obstruction from the 
Trump administration—obstruction so 
flagrant that it makes Nixon, when in 
the thick of Watergate, look like the 
model of transparency. Yet the facts 
uncovered still prove the truth of the 
matter: Trump abused his power when 
he secretly withheld security aid and a 
White House meeting to try to force 
Ukraine to announce investigations 
into a political rival in order to help 
him swing November’s election. He put 
his political self-interest ahead of our 
national security. He smeared the 
name of an American Ambassador, 
even seemingly risking her safety be-
cause she was simply too principled to 
further his corruption, because she was 
too clean to help him strong-arm 
Ukraine into that favor he demanded. 
When the reports first emerged about 
what he had done, he denied it. Then 
his 
explanation 
changed 
to: 
Well, 
maybe I did do it, but it was only be-
cause I was trying to root out corrup-
tion. 
If that were true, there would be 
some documentary record to prove 
that, and we have seen absolutely 
none, even after I asked for it during 
the questioning period. 
Now his defense team has gone so far 
as to claim that, well, it doesn’t mat-
ter if he did it because he is the Presi-
dent, and the President can do any-
thing he wants if it will help him get 
reelected. Breathtaking. To put it an-
other way, when he got caught, he lied. 
Then, when that lie was found out, he 
lied again, then again, then again. 
Along the way, his own defense coun-
sel could not papier-mache together 
even the most basic argument to actu-
ally exonerate him. The best case they 
could muster boiled down to: When the 
President does it, it is not illegal. 
Nixon already tried that defense. It did 
not work then, and it does not work 
now because—here is the thing—in 
America, we believe not in rulers but 
in the rule of law. 
Through all we have seen over the 
past few months, the truth has never 
changed. It is what National Security 
Council officials and decades-long dip-
lomats testified to under oath. It is 
what foreign policy experts and Trump 
administration staffers—and, yes, an 
American 
warrior 
with 
a 
Purple 
Heart—have raised their right hands to 
tell us, time after time, since the 
House hearings had begun. 
Even some of my Republican col-
leagues have admitted that Trump 
‘‘cross[ed] a line.’’ Some said it as re-
cently as this weekend, but many more 
said months ago that, if Trump did do 
what he is accused of, then it would, 
indeed, be wrong. Well, it is now obvi-
ous that those allegations were true, 
and it is pretty clear that Trump’s de-
fense team knows that also. If they ac-
tually 
believe 
Trump 
did 
nothing 
wrong—that his call was ‘‘perfect’’— 
then why would they fight so hard to 
block the witnesses and the documents 
from coming to light that could exon-
erate him? The only reason they would 
have done so is if they had known that 
he was guilty. The only reason for one 
to vote to acquit Trump today is if one 
is OK with his trying to cover it up. 
Now, I know that some folks have 
been saying that we should acquit

him—that we should ignore our con-
stitutional duty and leave him in of-
fice—because we are in an election 
year and that the voters should decide 
his fate. That is an argument that 
rings hollow because this trial was 
about Trump’s trying to cheat in the 
next election and rob the voters of 
their ability to decide. Any action 
other than voting to remove him would 
give him the license and the power to 
keep tampering with that race, to keep 
trying to turn that election into as 
much of a sham as an impeachment 
trial without witnesses. 
You know, I spent 23 years in the 
military, and one of the most critical 
lessons anyone who serves learns is of 
the damage that can be done when 
troops don’t oppose illegal orders, when 
fealty becomes blind and ignorance be-
comes intentional. Just as it is the 
duty of military officers to oppose un-
lawful orders, it is the responsibility of 
public servants to hold those in power 
accountable. 
Former NSC official Fiona Hill un-
derstood that when she testified before 
Congress because she knew that poli-
tics must never eclipse national secu-
rity. 
Ambassador Bill Taylor understood 
that as well. The veteran who has 
served in every administration since 
Reagan’s answered the question that is 
at the heart of the impeachment in-
quiry. He said under oath that, yes, 
there was a ‘‘clear understanding’’ of a 
quid pro quo—exactly the sort of abuse 
of power no President should be al-
lowed to get away with. 
LTC Alexander Vindman—the Purple 
Heart recipient who dedicated decades 
of his life to our Armed Forces—under-
stood the lessons of the past, too, in his 
saying that, here in America, right 
matters. 
My colleagues in this Chamber who 
have 
attacked 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman or who have provided a plat-
form for others to tear him down just 
for his doing what he believes is right 
should be ashamed of themselves. 
We should all be aware of the exam-
ple we set and always seek to elevate 
the national discourse. We should be 
thoughtful about our own conduct both 
in terms of respecting the rule of law 
and the sacrifices our troops make to 
keep us safe because, at the end of the 
day, our Constitution is really just a 
set of rules on some pieces of paper. It 
is only as strong as our will to uphold 
its ideals and hold up the scales of jus-
tice. 
So I am asking each of us today to 
muster up just an ounce of the courage 
shown by Fiona Hill, Ambassador Tay-
lor, and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. 
When our names are called from the 
dais in a few hours, each of us will ei-
ther pass or fail the most elementary, 
yet most important, test any elected 
official will ever take—whether to put 
country over party or party over coun-
try. 
It may be a politically difficult vote 
for some of us, but it should not be a 
morally difficult vote for any of us be-
cause, while I know that voting to ac-
quit would make the lives of some of 
my colleagues simpler come election 
day, I also know that America would 
have never been born if the heroes of 
centuries past made decisions based on 
political expediency. 
It would have been easier to have 
kept bowing down to King George III 
than to have pushed 342 chests of tea 
into the Boston Harbor, and it would 
have been easier to have kept paying 
taxes to the Crown than to have waged 
a revolution. Yet those patriots knew 
the importance of rejecting what was 
easy if it were in conflict with what 
was right. They knew that the courage 
of just a few could change history. 
So, when it is time to vote this after-
noon, we cannot think of political con-
venience. If we say abuse of power 
doesn’t warrant removal from office 
today, we will be paving the way for fu-
ture Presidents to do even worse to-
morrow—to keep breaking the law and 
to keep endangering our country—one 
‘‘perfect’’ call, one ‘‘favor,’’ one high 
crime and misdemeanor at a time. 
Time and again, over these past few 
months, we have heard one story about 
our Founders, perhaps, more than any 
other. It was the time when Benjamin 
Franklin walked out of Independence 
Hall after the Constitutional Conven-
tion and someone asked: ‘‘What have 
we got—a republic or a monarchy?’’ 
We all know what he said: ‘‘A Repub-
lic if you can keep it.’’ 
Keeping it may very well come down 
to the 100 of us in this very Chamber. 
We are the ones the Constitution vests 
with the power to hold the President 
accountable, and through our actions, 
we are the ones who vest the Constitu-
tion with its power. 
In this moment, let’s think not just 
of today but of tomorrow too. In this 
moment, let’s remember that, here, 
right matters; truth matters. The 
truth is that Donald Trump is guilty of 
these Articles of Impeachment. I will 
vote to do the right thing, and I hope 
my colleagues will as well. For the 
sake of tomorrow and the tomorrow 
after that, we must. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, later 
today I will vote to acquit the Presi-
dent on the charges of the two Articles 
of Impeachment. A not-guilty verdict, 
as every Senator on this floor has 
known for some time, was always what 
would happen in a House-driven, par-
tisan impeachment process. 
Less than a year ago, the Speaker of 
the House said that we should not go 
through this process unless something 
was compelling, unless something was 
overwhelming, unless something was 
bipartisan. I think the Speaker was ex-
actly right then, and I hope all future 
Speakers look at that guidance as we 
think about this process of impeach-
ment. 
In the first 180 years of the Constitu-
tion, individual Members talked about 
impeachment of Presidents—maybe of 
almost every President—but the Con-
gress only seriously touched this topic 
one time—one time in 180 years. 
In the last 46 years, Presidential im-
peachment has been before the country 
three times, and each case has been 
less compelling than the one before it. 
We don’t want partisan impeachment 
to become an exercise that happens 
when one party—not the party of the 
President—happens to have a majority 
of the votes in the House of Represent-
atives. 
Impeachment is fundamentally a po-
litical process. The Members of the 
Senate meet no standards for a regular 
jury. The jury can override the judge. 
Two-thirds of the Senate is necessary 
to remove the President. We really 
have no better term in the Constitu-
tion, I suppose, to use than ‘‘trial,’’ but 
in any classic sense, this isn’t a trial. 
In any classic sense, a partisan im-
peachment isn’t any kind of a real in-
dictment. 
Maybe, first and foremost, the House 
has to do its job. Part of that job would 
be to create a case that would produce 
a bipartisan vote on the articles in the 
House. If you haven’t met that stand-
ard—going 
back 
to 
the 
Speaker’s 
standard—you should work on the case 
some more and then wonder, if you 
can’t meet the standard, what is wrong 
with 
the 
process 
you 
are 
going 
through. Part of that job is to do ev-
erything necessary to have Articles of 
Impeachment that are compelling and 
complete. 
The House has time available to it to 
consider impeachment as they go about 
their essential work. They can con-
tinue to do the work of the Congress. 
They have weeks, months, if they 
choose to have, even maybe years to 
put a case together. They can call wit-
nesses. They can go to court to seek 
testimony. They can determine if this 
is an impeachment question or just an 
oversight question. 
The House can do lots of things, but 
once the Senate gets the Articles of 
Presidential Impeachment, they be-
come for the Senate an absolute pri-
ority. Both our rules and reality mean 
we cannot do anything else, realisti-
cally, until we are done dealing with 
the case the House sent over. 
That was fundamentally what was so 
wrong with the House sending over a 
case that they said needed more work. 
If it needed more work, it should have 
had more work. 
You can be for strong review of the 
executive. You can be for strong con-
gressional oversight and still support 
the idea of executive privilege. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S888 
February 5, 2020 
President has the right to unfettered 
advice and to know all the options. In 
fact, I think when you pierce that 
right, you begin to have advisers who 
may not want to give all the options to 
the President because it might appear 
they were for all the options. But the 
President’s advisers need to see that 
the President understands all the op-
tions and implications of a decision. 
The President, by the way—another 
topic that came up here several times— 
the President determines executive 
policy. The staff, the assistants, and 
whoever else works in the executive 
branch doesn’t determine executive 
policy; the President determines execu-
tive policy. The staff can put all the 
notes in front of the President they 
want to, but it is the President’s deci-
sion what the policy of the administra-
tion will be. Sharing that decision with 
the Congress, sharing how he got to 
that point—or later, she got to that 
point—with that decision is a nego-
tiated balance. 
Congress says: We want to know this. 
The President says: No. I need to 
have some ability for people to give me 
advice that isn’t all available for the 
Congress. 
So this is balanced out, and if that 
can’t happen, if that balance can’t be 
achieved, the judiciary decides what 
the balance is. The judiciary decides a 
question and says: You really must 
talk to the Congress about this, but 
you don’t have to talk to them about 
the next sentence you said at that 
same meeting. 
That is the kind of balance that oc-
curs. 
The idea repeatedly advanced by the 
House managers that the Senate, by 
majority vote, can decide these ques-
tions is both outrageous and dan-
gerous. 
The idea that the government would 
balance itself is, frankly, the miracle 
of the Constitution. Nobody had ever 
proposed, until Philadelphia in 1787, 
one, that the basis for government was 
the people themselves, and two, you 
could have a government that was so 
finely balanced that it would operate 
and maintain itself over time. 
The House managers would really 
upend that balance. By being unwilling 
to take the time the House had to pur-
sue the constitutional solution, they 
decided: We don’t have to worry about 
the Constitution to have that solution. 
To charge that the President’s asser-
tion of article II rights that go back to 
Washington is one of the actual Arti-
cles of Impeachment—that is dan-
gerous. 
The legislative branch cannot also be 
the judicial branch. The legislative 
branch can’t also decide ‘‘here is the 
balance’’ if the executive and legisla-
tive branch are in a fight about what 
should be disclosed and what shouldn’t. 
You can’t continue to have the three 
balances of power in our government if 
one of the branches can decide what 
the legislative branch should decide. 
In their haste to put this case to-
gether, the House sent the Senate the 
two weakest Articles of Impeachment 
possible. Presidents since Washington 
have been accused by some Members of 
Congress of abuse of power. Presidents 
since Washington have been accused by 
some Members of Congress of failure to 
cooperate with the Congress. 
The House managers argued against 
their own case. They repeatedly con-
tended that they had made their case 
completely, they had made their case 
totally, they had made their case in-
controvertibly, but they wanted us to 
call witnesses they had chosen not to 
call. They said they had already been 
in court 9 months to get the Presi-
dent’s former White House Counsel to 
testify and weren’t done yet, but some-
how they thought the Senate could get 
that person and others in a matter of 
days. 
These arguments have been and 
should have been rejected by the Sen-
ate. 
Today, the Articles of Impeachment 
should be and will be rejected by the 
Senate. Based on the Speaker’s March 
comments, these articles should have 
never been sent to the Senate. They 
were not compelling, they were not 
overwhelming, they were not bipar-
tisan, and most importantly, they were 
not necessary. 
One of the lessons we send today is to 
this House and to future Houses of Rep-
resentatives: Do your job. Take it seri-
ously. Don’t make it political. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have long 
maintained that most, if not all, of the 
most serious and vexing problems with-
in our Federal Government can be 
traced to a deviation from the twin 
core structural protections of the Con-
stitution. 
There are two of these protections— 
one that operates along a vertical axis; 
the other, a horizontal. 
The vertical protection we call fed-
eralism, which states a very simple 
fact: that in the American system of 
government, most power is to be re-
served to the States respectively, or 
the people, where it is exercised at the 
State and local level. It is only those 
powers enumerated in the Constitu-
tion, either in article I, section 8 or 
elsewhere, that are made Federal, 
those things that the Founding Fathers 
appropriately 
deemed 
unavoidably, 
necessarily national or that we have 
otherwise rendered national through a 
subsequent constitutional amendment. 
As was the case when James Madison 
wrote Federalist No. 45, the powers re-
served to the States are numerous and 
indefinite, while those that are given 
to the Congress to be exercised feder-
ally are few and defined—few and de-
fined powers, the Federal Government; 
numerous and indefinite reserved for 
the States. 
The horizontal protection operates 
within the Federal Government itself, 
and it acknowledges that we have three 
coequal, independent branches within 
the Federal Government: one that 
makes the laws, one that executes the 
laws, and one that interprets the laws 
when people can’t come to an agree-
ment and have an active, live dispute 
as to the meaning of a particular law 
in a particular case or controversy. 
Sadly, we have drifted steadily, ag-
gressively from both of these principles 
over the last 80 years. For roughly the 
first 150 years of the founding of our 
Republic and of the operation of our 
constitutional structure, we adhered 
pretty closely to them, but over the 
last 80 years or so, we have drifted 
steadily. This has been a bipartisan 
problem. It was one that was created 
under the broad leadership of Repub-
licans and Democrats alike and, in 
fact, in Senates and Houses of Rep-
resentatives and White Houses of every 
conceivable partisan combination. 
We have essentially taken power 
away from the American people in two 
steps—first, by moving power from the 
State and local level and taking it to 
Washington, in violation of the vertical 
protection we call federalism; and then 
a second time, moving it away from 
the people’s elected lawmakers in 
Washington to unelected, unaccount-
able bureaucrats placed within the ex-
ecutive branch of government but who 
are neither elected by the people nor 
accountable to anyone who is elect-
able. Thus, they constitute essentially 
a fourth branch of government within 
our system, one that is not sanctioned 
or contemplated by the Constitution 
and doesn’t really fit all that well 
within its framework. 
This has made the Federal Govern-
ment bigger and more powerful. It has 
occurred in a way that has made people 
less powerful. It has made government 
in general and in particular, this gov-
ernment, the Federal Government, less 
responsive to the needs of the people. It 
has been fundamentally contrary to 
the way our system of government op-
erates. 
What, one might ask, does any of this 
have to do with impeachment? Well, in 
my opinion, everything—or at least a 
lot. This distance that we have created 
in these two steps—moving power from 
the people to Washington and within 
Washington, handing it to unelected 
lawmakers or unelected bureaucrats— 
has created an amount of anxiety 
among the American people. Not all of 
them necessarily recognize it in the 
same way that I do or describe it with 
the same words, but they know some-
thing is not right. They know it when 
their 
Federal 
Government 
requires 
them to work many months out of 
every year just to pay their Federal 
taxes, only to be told later that it is 
not enough and hasn’t been enough for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S889 
February 5, 2020 
a long time since we have accumulated 
$22 to $23 trillion in debt, and when 
they come to understand that the Fed-
eral Government also imposes some $2 
trillion in regulatory compliance costs 
on the American people. 
This harms the poor and middle 
class. It makes everything we buy 
more expensive. It results in dimin-
ished 
wages, 
unemployment, 
and 
underemployment. On some level, the 
American people feel this. They experi-
ence this. They understand it. It cre-
ates anxiety. It was that very anxiety 
that caused people to want to elect a 
different kind of leader in 2016, and 
they did. It was this set of cir-
cumstances that caused them to elect 
Donald J. Trump as the 45th President 
of the United States, and I am glad 
they did because he promised to change 
the way we do things here, and he has 
done that. 
But as someone who has focused in-
tently on the need to reconnect the 
American people with their system of 
government, Donald Trump presents 
something of a serious threat to those 
who have occupied these positions of 
power, these individuals who, while 
hard-working, well-intentioned, well- 
educated, and highly specialized, oc-
cupy these positions of power within 
what we loosely refer to as the execu-
tive branch but is in reality an 
unelected, 
unaccountable 
fourth 
branch of government. 
He has bucked them on many, many 
levels and has infuriated them as he 
has done so, even as he is imple-
menting the American people’s wishes 
to close that gap between the people 
and the government that is supposed to 
serve them. 
He has bucked them on so many lev-
els, declining to defer to the opinions 
of self-proclaimed government experts 
who claim that they know better than 
any of us on a number of levels. 
He pushed back on them, for exam-
ple, when it comes to the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act—or FISA, 
as it is sometimes described—when he 
insisted that FISA had been abused in 
efforts to undermine his candidacy and 
infringe on the rights of the American 
people. When he took that position, 
Washington 
bureaucrats 
predictably 
mocked him, but he turned out to be 
right. 
He called out the folly of engaging in 
endless nation-building exercises as 
part of a two-decade-long war effort 
that has cost this country dearly in 
terms of American blood and treasure. 
Washington bureaucrats mocked him 
again, but he turned out to be right. 
He raised questions with how U.S. 
foreign aid is used and sometimes mis-
used throughout the world, sometimes 
to the detriment of the American peo-
ple and the very interests that such aid 
was created to alleviate. Washington 
bureaucrats mocked him, but he turned 
out to be right. 
President Trump asked Ukraine to 
investigate a Ukrainian energy com-
pany, Burisma. He momentarily paused 
U.S. aid to Ukraine while seeking a 
commitment from the then newly 
elected 
Ukrainian 
President, 
Volodymyr Zelensky, regarding that 
effort. He wanted to make sure that he 
could trust this recently elected Presi-
dent Zelensky before sending him the 
aid. Within a few weeks, his concerns 
were satisfied, and he released the aid. 
Pausing briefly before doing so isn’t 
criminal. It certainly isn’t impeach-
able. It is not even wrong. 
Quite to the contrary, this is exactly 
the sort of thing the American people 
elected President Trump to do. He 
would and has decided to bring a dif-
ferent paradigm to Washington, one 
that analyzes things from how the 
American citizenry views the American 
Government. 
This has in some respects, therefore, 
been a trial of the Washington, DC, es-
tablishment itself but not necessarily 
in the way the House managers appar-
ently intended. While the House man-
agers 
repeatedly 
invoked 
constitu-
tional principles, including separation 
of powers, their arguments have tended 
to prove the point opposite of the one 
they intended. 
Yes, we badly need to restore and 
protect both federalism and separation 
of power, and it is my view that the de-
viation from one contributes to the de-
viation from the other. But here, in 
order to do that, we have to respect the 
three branches of government for what 
they are, who leads them, how they op-
erate, and who is accountable to whom. 
For them to view President Trump as 
somehow subservient to the career 
civil servant bureaucratic class that 
has tended to manage agencies within 
the Federal Government, including the 
National Security Council, the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, individuals in the 
White House, and individuals within 
the State Department, among others, 
is not only mischaracterizing this 
problem, it helps identify the precise 
source of this problem. 
Many of these people, including some 
of the witnesses we have heard from in 
this trial, have mistakenly taken the 
conclusion 
that 
because 
President 
Trump took a conclusion different 
from that offered by the so-called 
interagency process, that that amount-
ed to a constitutionally impeachable 
act. It did not. It did nothing of the 
sort. 
Quite to the contrary, when you ac-
tually look at the Constitution itself, 
it makes clear that the President has 
the power to do what he did here. The 
very first section of article II of the 
Constitution—this is the part of the 
Constitution that outlines the Presi-
dent’s authority—makes clear that 
‘‘[t]he executive Power [of the United 
States Government] shall be vested in 
the President of the United States.’’ 
It is important to remember that 
there are exactly two Federal officials 
who were elected within the executive 
branch of government. One is the Vice 
President, and the other is the Presi-
dent. 
The Vice President’s duties, I would 
add, are relatively limited. Constitu-
tionally speaking, the Vice President is 
the President of the Senate and thus 
performs a quasi-legislative role, but 
the Vice President’s executive branch 
duties are entirely bound up with those 
of the President’s. They consist of aid-
ing and assisting the President as the 
President may deem necessary and 
standing ready to step into the posi-
tion of the Presidency should it become 
necessary as a result of disability, in-
capacitation, or death. Barring that, 
the entire executive branch authority 
is bound up within the Presidency 
itself. The President is the executive 
branch of government, just as the Jus-
tices who sit across the street them-
selves amount to the capstone of the 
judicial branch, just as 100 Senators 
and 435 Representatives are the legisla-
tive branch. 
The 
President 
is 
the 
executive 
branch. As such, it is his prerogative, 
within the confines of what the law al-
lows and authorizes and otherwise pro-
vides, to decide how to execute that. It 
is not only not incompatible with that 
system of government, it is entirely 
consistent with it—indeed, authorized 
by it. 
A President should be able to say: 
Look, we have a newly elected Presi-
dent in Ukraine. 
We have longstanding allegations of 
corruption within Ukraine. Those alle-
gations have been well-founded in 
Ukraine. No one disputes that corrup-
tion is rampant in Ukraine. 
A newly elected President comes in. 
This President or any President in the 
future decides: Hey, we are giving a lot 
of aid to this country—$391 million for 
the year in question. I want to make 
sure that I understand how that Presi-
dent operates. I want to establish a re-
lationship of trust before taking a step 
further with that President. So I am 
going to take my time a little bit. I am 
going to wait maybe a few weeks in 
order to make sure we are on a sure 
footing there. 
He did that. There is nothing wrong 
with that. 
What is the response from the House 
managers? Well, it gets back to that 
interagency process, as if people whom 
the American people don’t know or 
have reason to know because those peo-
ple don’t stand accountable to the peo-
ple—they are not elected by the people; 
they are not really accountable to any-
one who is in turn elected by the peo-
ple—the fact that those people involved 
in the interagency process might dis-
agree with a foreign policy decision 
made by the President of the United 
States and the fact that this President 
of the United States might take a dif-
ferent approach than his predecessor or 
predecessors does not make this Presi-
dent’s decisions criminal. It certainly 
doesn’t make them impeachable. It 
doesn’t even make them wrong. 
In the eyes of many and I believe 
most Americans—they want a Presi-
dent to be careful about how the

United States spends money. They 
want the United States to stop and re-
consider from time to time the fact 
that we spend a lot of money through-
out the world on countries that are not 
the United States. We want a President 
of the United States to be able to exer-
cise a little bit of discretion in pushing 
pause before that President knows 
whether he can trust a newly elected 
government in the country in question. 
So to suggest here that our commit-
ment to the Constitution; to suggest 
here, as the House managers have, that 
our respect for the separation of pow-
ers within the constitutional frame-
work somehow demands that we re-
move the duly elected President of the 
United States is simply wrong. It is 
elevating to a status completely for-
eign to our constitutional structure an 
entity that the Constitution does not 
name. It elevates a policy dispute to a 
question of high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Those two are not the same 
thing. 
At the end of the day, this govern-
ment does, in fact, stand accountable 
to the people. This government is of, 
by, and for the people. We cannot re-
move the 45th President of the United 
States for doing something that the 
law and the Constitution allow him to 
do without doing undue violence to 
that system of government to which 
every single one of us has sworn an 
oath. 
We have sworn to uphold and protect 
and defend that system of government. 
That means standing up for the Amer-
ican people and those they have elected 
to do a job recognized by the Constitu-
tion. 
I will be voting to defend this Presi-
dent’s actions. I will be voting against 
undoing the vote taken by the Amer-
ican people some 31⁄2 years ago. I will 
be voting for the principle of freedom 
and for the very principles that our 
Constitution was designed to protect. 
I urge all of my colleagues to reject 
these deeply factually and legally 
flawed Articles of Impeachment and to 
vote not guilty. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to officially declare that I will 
vote against both Articles of Impeach-
ment brought against President Trump 
by the very partisan and, quite frank-
ly, ridiculous House of Representa-
tives. I know my position is hardly a 
surprise, 
but 
it 
is 
almost 
as 
unsurprising as the House impeaching 
the President, to begin with. 
Since the moment he was sworn into 
office, Democrats have schemed to re-
move Donald Trump from office. It is 
not my opinion. I take them at their 
word. Their fixation on his removal 
was a conclusion in search of a jus-
tification, which they manufactured 
from a phone conversation between 
world leaders leaked—leaked—by one 
of the many career bureaucrats who 
seem to have forgotten that they work 
for the elected leaders in this country, 
not the other way around. 
So the two Articles of Impeachment 
before this body today, in my view, are 
without merit. They are an affront, in 
fact, to this institution and to our Con-
stitution, representing the very same 
partisan derangement that worried our 
Founding Fathers so much that they 
made the threshold for impeachment 
this high. 
The Senate exists exactly for mo-
ments like this. I didn’t arrive at my 
conclusion to support acquittal hastily 
or flippantly, and I don’t believe any of 
my colleagues did either, including 
those who come to a different conclu-
sion from mine. Despite being sent 
such flawed Articles by the House, the 
Senate did in fact dutifully and sol-
emnly follow its constitutional obliga-
tion. During the last days of the trial, 
we heard sworn testimony from 13 wit-
nesses, read 17 depositions, asked 180 
questions, viewed 193 video clips, and 
poured over 28,000 pages of documents. 
But even more than the House man-
agers’ shallow arguments and lack of 
evidence against and due process for 
our President and the obvious derange-
ment at the very root of every inves-
tigation, beginning with the corrupt 
FBI Crossfire Hurricane counterintel-
ligence investigation during the 2016 
election cycle, the Articles of Impeach-
ment we will vote on in a few hours 
should have ended at their beginning. 
Can we agree that if a Speaker of the 
House unilaterally declares an im-
peachment inquiry, it represents the 
opinion of one Member of Congress, not 
the official authorization of the entire 
Congress? Can we agree that a vote to 
begin an impeachment inquiry that has 
only partisan support and bipartisan 
opposition is not what the Founders 
had in mind and in fact is what they 
firmly rejected and cautioned about? 
Can we agree that impeachment arti-
cles passed by a majority of one party 
and opposed by Members of both par-
ties on their face fail, if not the letter 
of the law, certainly, the spirit of the 
Constitution? 
Yet, even under the cloud of purely 
partisan politics of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Senate conducted a 
complete, comprehensive trial, result-
ing, in my view, in a crystal clear con-
clusion: The Democratic-led House of 
Representatives failed to meet the 
most basic standards of proof and has 
dramatically lowered the bar for im-
peachment to unacceptable levels. It is 
deeply concerning, and I believe we 
must commit to never, ever letting it 
happen again to the President of any 
political party. 
That can start today. In just a few 
hours, the Senate will have the oppor-
tunity to cast a vote to end this whole 
ordeal, and, in doing so, can make a 
statement 
that 
the 
threshold 
for 
undoing the will of the American peo-
ple in the most recent election and 
undoing the will of a major political 
party in the upcoming election should 
be higher than one party’s petty obses-
sion. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle join me in voting against 
these charges. But whether he is ac-
quitted or convicted and removed, it is 
my prayer, as we were admonished 
many times throughout the last few 
weeks by our Chaplain Black, that 
God’s will is the one that will be done. 
Then we can move on to the unifying 
issues the American people want us to 
tackle—issues like infrastructure, edu-
cation, energy security and dominance, 
national security, and the rising cost 
of healthcare, among many others. 
These are issues the American people 
care about. These are issues that North 
Dakotans care about. These are issues 
that the people have sent us here to 
deal with. Let’s do it together. Let’s 
start now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
will vote to acquit President Donald J. 
Trump on both Articles of Impeach-
ment presented by House Democrats. I 
have listened carefully to the argu-
ments presented by the House Demo-
cratic managers and the White House 
defense team. Those prosecuting the 
President failed on a legal and con-
stitutional basis to produce the evi-
dence required to undertake the very 
serious act of removing a duly elected 
President from this office. 
This trial exposed that pure political 
partisanship fueled a reckless inves-
tigation and the subsequent impeach-
ment of the President on weak, vague, 
and 
noncriminal 
accusations. 
The 
Democrats’ case, which lacked the 
basic standards of fairness and due 
process, was fabricated to fulfill their 
one long-held hope to impeach Presi-
dent Trump. 
We should all be concerned about the 
dangerous precedent and consequences 
of convicting any President on charges 
originating from strictly partisan rea-
sons. The Founding Fathers warned 
against allowing impeachment to be-
come a political weapon. In this case, 
House Democrats crossed that line. 
Rejecting the abuse of power and ob-
struction of Congress articles before us 
will affirm our belief and the impeach-
ment standards intended by the Found-
ers. With my votes to acquit President 
Trump, justice will be served. The Sen-
ate has faithfully executed its con-
stitutional duties to hear and judge the 
charges leveled against the President. 
I remain hopeful that we can finally 
set aside this flawed partisan inves-
tigation, prosecution, and persecution 
of President Trump. The people of Mis-
sissippi and this great Nation are more 
interested in us getting back to doing 
the work they sent us here to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S891 
February 5, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow 
Senators, I come today to talk about 
the business at hand. Obviously, it is 
the vote that we are going to take at 4 
o’clock this afternoon. 
We were subjected to days and days 
of trial here—many witnesses, witness 
statements, and all that sort of thing— 
and it is incumbent upon us now as ju-
rors to reach a conclusion, and I have 
done so. 
I come at this with a little bit of a 
different view, probably, than others. I 
have tried more cases, probably, than 
anyone on the floor, both as a pros-
ecutor and in private practice. So I 
watched carefully as the case was pre-
sented to us and how the case had been 
put together by the managers from the 
House. What I learned in the many 
years of trial experience that I had is 
that the only way, really, to try a case 
and to reach where you want to get is 
to do it in good faith and to do it hon-
estly. 
I had real trouble right at the begin-
ning when I saw that the lead manager 
read a transcript purporting to be a 
transcript of the President’s phone call 
that has been at issue here, and it was 
falsified. It was falsified knowingly, 
willfully, and intentionally. So, as a re-
sult of that, when they walked through 
the door and wanted to present their 
case, there was a strike there already, 
and I put it in that perspective. 
How the case unfolded after that was 
stunning because I have never seen a 
case succeed the way they put the case 
together. They put the case together 
by taking every fact that they wanted 
to make fly and put it only in the best 
light without showing the other side 
but more importantly—more impor-
tantly—intentionally 
excluding 
evi-
dence. Of course, this whole thing cen-
tered on witness statements that the 
President had somehow threatened or 
pressured the President of Ukraine to 
do what he was going to do. That sim-
ply wasn’t the case. The transcript 
didn’t say that. 
Now, admittedly, they had a witness 
who was going around saying that, and 
they called every person he told to tell 
us that that was the situation. The 
problem is, it was hearsay. There is a 
good reason why they don’t allow hear-
say in a court of law, and that is, it 
simply wasn’t true. 
When the person who was spreading 
that rumor actually talked to the 
President about it, the President got 
angry and said: That is not true. I 
would never do that. 
They never told us that. Once the 
tape was shown, the House managers 
spent days putting together that prop-
osition for us. The President’s counsel 
dismantled that in about an hour and 
did so really quickly. And, as a result 
of that, simply from a factual basis, it 
is my opinion that the prosecution in 
this case did not meet its burden. 
Now, much has been said about wit-
nesses and how they did this and what 
have you, but the Constitution is crys-
tal clear. It gives the House absolute, 
total, 100-percent control of impeach-
ment; that is, the investigation and the 
vote on it. It gives us the same thing 
but on the trial basis. 
The thing I think was surprising is 
that they came over here and tried to 
tell us how to do their job. I suspect 
they, in the House, would feel the exact 
same way about it if we went over 
there and told them how they should 
impeach. They came over here and told 
us how we should do witnesses and all 
that sort of thing. They had every op-
portunity to prepare the case. It was 
totally in their hands. They had as 
much time as they wanted, and they 
simply didn’t do it. So in that respect, 
I also found that they came short. 
But the bottom line for me, too, is 
that there is a second reason I would 
vote to acquit, and that is the stunning 
attack that this was on the U.S. Con-
stitution. This is really the first time 
in history when a purely political at-
tack was instigated by reaching to the 
U.S. Constitution and using what is 
really a sacred item in that Constitu-
tion, a process that the Founding Fa-
thers gave us for good reason, and that 
is impeachment. 
It was not intended to be used as a 
political bludgeon. It simply wasn’t. 
We had in front of us the Federalist Pa-
pers, and we had the debates of the 
Constitutional Convention. Really, the 
one silver lining that came out of this 
was it underscored again for us the ge-
nius of the Founding Fathers giving us 
three branches of government—not just 
three branches of government but 
three branches of government that had 
distinct lanes in which they operated 
and, most importantly, indicating that 
they were separate but equal. 
They wanted not a parliamentary 
system like they had looked at from 
Britain with a head of state that was a 
Prime Minister who could be removed 
and changed, as happens all around the 
world today. They gave us a unique 
system with three branches of govern-
ment. 
So the Founding Fathers were very 
clear. They debated the question of 
what should it take to get rid of the 
head of state, and they concluded that 
the 
second 
branch 
of 
government 
couldn’t be a strong branch of govern-
ment if, indeed, the President could be 
removed as a Prime Minister could be 
removed, simply by Congress getting 
unhappy with his policies or dis-
agreeing with him. So, as a result of 
that, they did give us impeachment, 
and it is a unique process. They were 
very clear that it was supposed to be 
used 
only 
in 
very 
extreme 
cir-
cumstances and not just simply be-
cause of a political disagreement or a 
policy disagreement. And that is ex-
actly what happened here. 
The Federalist Papers and the Con-
stitutional 
Convention 
debates 
are 
very, very clear that it is not a broad 
swath of reasons to impeach the Presi-
dent that is given to the first branch of 
government but, indeed, a very, very 
narrow swath. It was interesting that, 
from the beginning, they picked the 
two words of ‘‘treason’’ and ‘‘bribery,’’ 
and to that they then had a long debate 
about what it would be in addition to 
that. They had such words as ‘‘malfea-
sance,’’ ‘‘misfeasance,’’ ‘‘corruption,’’ 
and all those kinds of things that could 
be very broad. They rejected all those 
and said, no, specifically, it had to be 
‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
So what they did was they narrowed 
the lane considerably and made it dif-
ficult to remove the head of the second 
branch of government. And then, on 
top of that, for frosting on the cake, 
they said it has got to be two-thirds. 
Now, what did that simply mean? They 
knew—they knew—that human beings 
being the way they are, that human 
beings who were involved in the polit-
ical process and political parties would 
reach to get rid of a political enemy 
using everything they could. So they 
wanted to see that that didn’t happen 
with impeachment. So, as a result of 
that, they gave us the two-thirds re-
quirement, and that meant that no 
President was going to be impeached 
without a bipartisan movement. 
This movement has been entirely 
partisan. No Republican voted to im-
peach him in the House of Representa-
tives. This afternoon at 4 we are going 
to have a vote, and it is going to be 
along party lines and, again, it is going 
to be political. 
So what do we have here? At the end 
of the day, we have a political exercise, 
and that political exercise is going to 
fail. And once again—once again—God 
has blessed America, and the Republic 
that Benjamin Franklin said we have, 
if we can keep it, is going to be sus-
tained. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Ohio is 
recognized. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, over 
the past 3 weeks, we have heard from 
the House managers and the Presi-
dent’s counsel regarding the facts of 
the case against President Donald 
Trump. 
Much like trials in Lorain and Lima 
and Lordstown, OH, or in Marietta, in 
Massillon, and in Marion, OH, we have 
seen the prosecution—in this case, the 
House managers—and the defense—in 
this case, the President’s lawyers— 
present their cases. All 100 of us—every 
one of us—are the jury. We took an 
oath to be impartial jurors. We all took 
an oath to be impartial jurors just like 
juries in Ohio and across America. But 
to some of my colleagues, that just ap-
peared to be a joke. 
The great journalist Bill Moyers 
summed up the past 3 weeks: ‘‘What 
we’ve just seen is the dictator of the 
Senate manipulating the impeachment 
process to save the demagogue in the 
White House whose political party has 
become the gravedigger of democracy.’’ 
Let me say that again. ‘‘What we 
have just seen is the dictator of the

Senate manipulating the impeachment 
process to save the demagogue in the 
White House whose political party has 
become the gravedigger of democracy.’’ 
Even before this trial began, Leader 
MCCONNELL admitted out loud that he 
was coordinating the trial process with 
the White House. The leader of the 
Senate 
was 
coordinating with the 
White House on impeachment. I chal-
lenge him to show me one trial in my 
State of Ohio or his State of Kentucky 
where the jury coordinated with the 
defense lawyers. In a fair trial, the de-
fense and prosecution would have been 
able to introduce evidence, to call wit-
nesses, and to listen to testimony. 
Every other impeachment proceeding 
in the Senate for 250 years had wit-
nesses. Some of them had dozens. We 
had zero. Leader MCCONNELL
rushed 
this trial through. He turned off cam-
eras in this body so that the American 
public couldn’t see the whole process. 
He restricted reporter access. We know 
reporters roam the halls to talk to 
Members of the House and Senate. He 
restricted access there. He twisted 
arms to make sure every Republican 
voted with him to block witnesses. He 
didn’t get a couple of them, but he had 
enough to protect himself. 
The public already sees through it. 
This is a sham trial. I said from the be-
ginning that I would keep an open 
mind. If there are witnesses who would 
exonerate the President, the American 
people need to hear from them. 
Over the course of this trial we heard 
mounting, overwhelming evidence that 
President Trump did something that 
not even Richard Nixon ever did: He ex-
torted a foreign leader. He fired a ca-
reer foreign service officer for rooting 
out corruption. He put his own Presi-
dential campaign above our collective 
national security. 
The President said this is just hear-
say, but he and the Republican leader, 
together with 51 of 53 Republican Sen-
ators, blocked every single potential 
witness we wanted to call. The Presi-
dent says it was hearsay. We knew 
there were witnesses who were in the 
room with President Trump. We didn’t 
get to hear from them. We didn’t hear 
from Ambassador Bolton. We didn’t 
hear 
from 
interim 
Chief 
of 
Staff 
Mulvaney. We didn’t hear from Sec-
retary Pompeo. The Republican leader 
denied the American people the chance 
to hear all of them testify under oath. 
We have seen more information come 
to light each day, which builds on the 
pattern of facts laid out in great detail 
by the House managers. We have now 
heard tape recordings of the President 
of the United States telling associates 
to 
‘‘get 
rid 
of’’ 
U.S. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, a public servant who de-
voted her life to fighting corruption 
and promoting American ideals and 
foreign policy throughout her long, dis-
tinguished career at the State Depart-
ment. With her removed from the post, 
it appears the President thought he 
would be able to compel our ally 
Ukraine 
to 
investigate 
President 
Trump’s political opponent. 
Reporters have now revealed that 
Ambassador Bolton—again, a firsthand 
witness—outlined that the President 
did exactly what the Impeachment Ar-
ticles allege: He withheld security as-
sistance to an ally at war with Russia 
in exchange for a political favor. 
The Justice Department admits there 
are 24 emails showing the President’s 
thinking on Ukraine assistance. But 
you know what? Senator MCCONNELL, 
down the hall, will not allow us to see 
any of these 24 emails. 
Make no mistake, the full truth is 
going to come out. The Presiding Offi-
cer, my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, they are all going to be em-
barrassed because they covered this up. 
It wasn’t just the President and the 
Vice President and Secretary Pompeo 
and Chief of Staff Mulvaney; it was 51 
Republican U.S. Senators, including 
the Presiding Officer, who is a new 
Member of this body, who covered up 
this evidence. 
It will come out this week. It will 
come out this month, this year, the 
year after that, for decades to come. 
And when the full truth comes out, we 
will be judged by our children and 
grandchildren. 
Without 
additional 
witnesses, 
we 
must judge based on the facts pre-
sented. The House managers made a 
clear, compelling case. In the middle of 
a war with Russia, the President froze 
$400 million in security assistance to 
Ukraine. He wanted an investigation 
into his 2020 political opponent. He re-
fused a critical meeting with President 
Zelensky in the Oval Office. 
These actions don’t promote our na-
tional security or the rule of law; they 
promote Donald Trump personally and 
his campaign. 
We know the President extorted 
President Zelensky. He asked the lead-
er of a foreign government to help him. 
That is the definition of an abuse of 
power. That is why we have no choice— 
no choice—but to convict this Presi-
dent of abusing his office. All of us 
know this. To acquit would set a clear, 
dangerous precedent: If you abuse your 
office, it is OK. Congress will look the 
other way. 
This trial and these votes we are 
about to cast are about way more than 
just President Trump. They are about 
the future of democracy. It will send a 
message to this President—or whom-
ever we elect in November—and to all 
future Presidents. It will be heard 
around the world—our verdict—by our 
allies and enemies alike, especially the 
Russians. Are we going to roll out the 
welcome mat to our adversaries to 
interfere in our elections? Are we going 
to give a green light to the President of 
the United States to base our country’s 
foreign policy not on our collective, 
agreed-upon national security or that 
of our allies, like Ukraine, but on the 
President’s 
personal 
political 
cam-
paign? 
These are the issues at stake. If we 
don’t hold this President accountable 
for abuse of office, if no one in his own 
party, if no one on this side of the 
aisle—no one—has the backbone to 
stand up and say ‘‘stop,’’ there is no 
question it will get worse. How do I 
know that? I have heard it from a num-
ber of my Republican colleagues when, 
privately, they will tell me, yes, we are 
concerned about what the President is 
going to do if he is exonerated. 
I was particularly appalled by the 
words of Mr. Dershowitz. He said: ‘‘If a 
President does something which he be-
lieves will help him get elected in the 
public interest, that cannot be the kind 
of quid pro quo that results in im-
peachment.’’ 
Think about that for a moment. If 
the President thinks it is OK, he 
thinks it is going to help his election, 
and he thinks his election is in the 
public interest, then it is OK; the 
President can break any law, can fun-
nel taxpayer money toward his reelec-
tion, can turn the arm of the State 
against his political enemies and not 
be held accountable. That is what this 
claim comes down to. 
Remember the words of Richard 
Nixon: ‘‘When the President does it, 
that means it is not illegal.’’ Our coun-
try rejected that argument during Wa-
tergate. We had a Republican Party 
with principle in those days and Sen-
ators with backbone, and they told 
that President to resign because no-
body is above the State; nobody is 
above the law. 
If we have a President who can turn 
the Office of the Presidency and the en-
tire executive branch into his own po-
litical campaign operation, God help 
us. 
My colleagues think I am exag-
gerating. We don’t have the option to 
vote in favor of some arguments made 
during the trial and not others. Mr. 
Dershowitz’s words will live forever in 
the historical record. If they are al-
lowed to stand beside a ‘‘not guilty’’ 
verdict—make no mistake—they will 
be used as precedent by future aspiring 
autocrats. In the words of House Man-
ager SCHIFF, ‘‘that way madness lies.’’ 
I know some of my colleagues agree 
this sets a dangerous precedent. Some 
of you have admitted to me that you 
are troubled by the President’s behav-
ior. You know he is reckless. You know 
he lies. You know what he did was 
wrong. I have heard Republican after 
Republican after Republican Senator 
tell me that privately. If you acknowl-
edge that, if you have said it to me, if 
you said it to your family, if you said 
it to your staff, if you just said it to 
yourself, I implore you, we have no 
choice but to vote to convict. 
What are my colleagues afraid of? I 
think about the words of ADAM SCHIFF 
in this Chamber on Tuesday: ‘‘If you 
find that the House has proved its case 
and still vote to acquit’’—if you still 
vote to acquit—‘‘your name will be tied 
to his with a cord of steel and for all of 
history.’’ 
‘‘[Y]our name will be tied to his with 
a cord of steel and for all of history.’’ 
So I ask my colleagues again: What 
are you afraid of?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S893 
February 5, 2020 
One of our American fundamental 
values is that we have no Kings, no no-
bility, no oligarchs. No matter how 
rich, no matter how powerful, no mat-
ter how much money you give to MITCH 
MCCONNELL’s super PAC, everyone can 
and should be held accountable. 
I hope my colleagues remember that. 
I hope they will choose courage over 
fear. I hope they will choose country 
over party. I hope they will join me in 
holding this President accountable to 
the American people we all took an 
oath to serve. 
We know this: Americans are watch-
ing. They will not forget. 
I will close with quoting, again, Bill 
Moyers, a longtime journalist: ‘‘What 
we have just seen is the dictator of the 
Senate manipulating the impeachment 
process to save the demagogue in the 
White House whose political party has 
become the gravedigger of democracy.’’ 
I know my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle know better. I hope 
they vote what they really know. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii is recognized. 
Ms. 
HIRONO. 
Madam 
President, 
when the Framers debated whether to 
include the power of impeachment in 
the Constitution, they envisioned a 
moment very much like the one we 
face now. They were fearful of a cor-
rupt President who would abuse the 
Presidency for his or her personal gain, 
particularly one who would allow any 
foreign country to interfere in the af-
fairs of our United States. With this 
fear in mind, the Framers directed the 
Senate to determine whether to ulti-
mately remove that President from of-
fice. 
In normal times, the Senate—con-
scious of its awesome responsibility— 
would meet this moment with the ap-
propriate sobriety and responsibility to 
conduct a full and fair trial. That in-
cludes calling appropriate witnesses 
and subpoenaing relevant documents, 
none of which happened here. 
In normal times, the Senate would 
have weighed the evidence presented by 
both sides and rendered impartial jus-
tice. And in normal times, having been 
presented with overwhelming evidence 
of impeachable acts, the Senate would 
have embraced its constitutional re-
sponsibility to convict the President 
and remove him or her from office. 
But as we have learned too often over 
the past 3 years, these are not normal 
times. Instead of fulfilling its duty 
later today, the U.S. Senate will fail 
its test at a crucial moment of our 
country by voting to acquit Donald J. 
Trump of abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. 
The Senate cannot blame its con-
stitutional failure on the House man-
agers. They proved their case with 
overwhelming 
and 
compelling 
evi-
dence. Manager JERRY NADLER laid out 
a meticulous case demonstrating how 
and why the President’s actions rose to 
the constitutional standard for im-
peachment and removal. 
Manager HAKEEM JEFFRIES explained 
how Donald Trump ‘‘directly pressured 
the Ukrainian leader to commence 
phony political investigations as a part 
of his effort to cheat and solicit foreign 
interference in the 2020 election.’’ 
Manager VAL
DEMINGS
walked us 
through the evidence of how Donald 
Trump used $391 million of taxpayer 
money to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce politically motivated investiga-
tions. She concluded: ‘‘This is enough 
to prove extortion in court.’’ 
Manager SYLVIA GARCIA showed us 
how Donald Trump’s demand for inves-
tigations was purely for his personal, 
political benefit. She debunked the 
conspiracy theories the President’s 
counsel raised against former Vice 
President Joe Biden—Donald Trump’s 
political rival and the true target of 
his corrupt scheme. 
Manager JASON CROW described viv-
idly the human costs of withholding 
aid from Ukrainian troops fighting a 
hot war against Russia. 
Manager ADAM SCHIFF tied together 
the evidence of Donald Trump’s abuse 
of power—the most serious of impeach-
able offenses and one that includes ex-
tortion and bribery. 
And manager ZOE LOFGREN used her 
extensive experience to provide per-
spective on Donald Trump’s unprece-
dented, unilateral, and complete ob-
struction of Congress to cover up his 
corrupt scheme. She is the only Mem-
ber of Congress to be involved in three 
Presidential impeachments. 
The President’s lawyers could not re-
fute the House’s case. Instead, they ul-
timately resorted to the argument 
that, even accepting the facts as pre-
sented by the House managers, Donald 
Trump’s conduct is not impeachable. It 
is what I have called the ‘‘He did it; so 
what?’’ argument. 
Many of my Republican colleagues 
are using the ‘‘So what?’’ argument to 
justify their votes to let the President 
off the hook. Yet the senior Senator 
from Tennessee said: ‘‘I think he 
shouldn’t have done it. I think it was 
wrong.’’ He said it was ‘‘inappropriate’’ 
and ‘‘improper, crossing a line.’’ But he 
refused to hold the President account-
able, arguing that the voters should de-
cide. 
The junior Senator from Iowa said: 
‘‘The President has a lot of latitude to 
do what he wants to do’’ but he ‘‘did it 
maybe in the wrong manner.’’ 
She also said that ‘‘whether you like 
what the President did or not,’’ the 
charges didn’t rise to the level of an 
impeachable offense. 
The junior Senator from Ohio called 
the President’s actions ‘‘wrong and in-
appropriate’’ but said they did not 
‘‘rise to the level of removing a duly- 
elected president from office and tak-
ing him off the ballot in the middle of 
an election.’’ 
And the senior Senator from Florida 
went so far as to say: ‘‘Just because ac-
tions meet a standard of impeachment 
does not mean it is in the best interest 
of the country to remove a president 
from office.’’ 
By refusing to hold this President ac-
countable, my Republican colleagues 
are reinforcing the President’s mis-
guided belief that he can do whatever 
he wants under article II of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
Donald Trump was already a danger 
to this country. We have seen it in his 
policy decisions—from taking away 
healthcare from millions of Americans 
to threatening painful cuts to Social 
Security and Medicare, to engaging in 
an all-out assault on immigrants in 
this country. 
But today, we are called on to con-
front a completely different type of 
danger—one that goes well beyond the 
significant policy differences I have 
with this President. 
If we let Donald Trump get away 
with extorting the President of another 
country for his own personal, political 
benefit, the Senate will be complicit— 
complicit—in his next corrupt scheme. 
Which country will he bully or invite 
to interfere in our elections next? 
Which pot of taxpayer money will he 
use as a bribe to further his political 
schemes? 
Later today, I will vote to convict 
and remove President Donald Trump 
for abusing his power and obstructing 
Congress. I am under no illusion that 
my Republican colleagues will do the 
same. They have argued it is up to the 
American people to decide, as though 
impeachment were not a totally sepa-
rate, constitutional remedy for a law-
less President. 
As I considered my vote, I listened 
closely to Manager SCHIFF’s closing 
statement about why the Senate needs 
to convict this President. He said: 
I do not ask you to convict him because 
truth or right or decency matters nothing to 
him— 
He is referring to the President— 
but because we have proven our case, and it 
matters to you. Truth matters to you. Right 
matters to you. You are decent. He is not 
who you are. 
It is time for the Senate to uphold its 
constitutional responsibility by con-
victing this President and holding him 
accountable. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado is recognized. 
Mr. 
BENNET. 
Madam 
President, 
when I was in the second grade—which 
I did twice because I was dyslexic, so I 
don’t know which year of the second 
grade it was, but one of those 2 years— 
we were asked to line up in order of 
whose family had been here the longest 
period of time and whose family had 
been here the shortest period of time. 
I turned out to be the answer to both 
of those questions. My father’s family 
went 
all 
the 
way 
back 
to 
the 
Mayflower, and my mom’s family were 
Polish Jews who survived the Holo-
caust. They didn’t leave Warsaw be-
cause my grandfather had a large fam-
ily he didn’t want to leave behind. And 
in the event—everybody was killed in 
the war, except my mom, her parents, 
and an aunt. They lived in Warsaw for 
2 years after the war. Then they went 
to Stockholm for a year. They went to

Mexico City for a year, of all places. 
And then they came to the United 
States—the one place in the world they 
could rebuild their shattered lives, and 
they did rebuild their shattered lives. 
My mom was the only person in the 
family who could speak any English. 
She registered herself in the New York 
City public schools. She graduated 
from Hunter College High School. She 
went on to graduate from Wellesley 
College in Massachusetts in one gen-
eration. My grandparents rebuilt the 
business they had lost during the war. 
I knew from them how important 
this symbol of America was to people 
struggling all over the world. They had 
been through some of the worst events 
in human history, and their joy of 
being Americans was completely un-
adulterated. I have met many immi-
grants across this country, and I still 
haven’t met anybody with a stronger 
accent than my grandparents had, and 
I have never met anybody who were 
greater patriots than they were. They 
understood how important the idea of 
America was, not because we were per-
fect—exactly the opposite of that—be-
cause we were imperfect. But we lived 
in a free society that was able to cure 
its imperfections with the hard work of 
our citizens to make this country more 
democratic, more free, and more fair— 
a country committed to the rule of 
law. Nobody was above the rule of law, 
and nobody was treated unfairly by the 
law, even if you were an immigrant to 
this country. 
From my dad’s example, I learned 
something really different. It might in-
terest some people around here to 
know he was a staffer in the Senate for 
many years. I actually grew up coming 
here on Saturday mornings, throwing 
paper airplanes around the hallways of 
the 
Dirksen 
Building 
and 
Russell 
Building. 
He worked here at a very different 
time in the Senate. He worked here at 
a time when Republicans and Demo-
crats worked together to uphold the 
rule of law, to pass important legisla-
tion that was needed by the American 
people to move our country forward, a 
time when Democrats and Republicans 
went back home and said: I didn’t get 
everything I wanted, to be sure, but the 
65 percent I did get is worth the bill we 
have, and here is why the other side 
needed 35 percent. 
Those days are completely gone in 
the U.S. Senate, and I grieve for them. 
My dad passed away about a year ago. 
I know how disappointed he would be 
about where we are, but there isn’t 
anybody who can fix it, except the 100 
people who are here and, I suppose, the 
American people for whom we osten-
sibly work. 
In the last 10 years that I have been 
here, I have watched politicians come 
to this floor and destroy the solemn re-
sponsibility we have—the constitu-
tional responsibility we have—to ad-
vise and consent on judicial appoint-
ments, to turn that constitutional re-
sponsibility into nothing more than a 
vicious partisan exercise. That hasn’t 
been done by the American people. 
That wasn’t done by any other genera-
tion of politicians who were in this 
place. It has been done by this genera-
tion of politicians led by the Senator 
from Kentucky, the majority leader of 
the Senate. 
We have become a body that does 
nothing. We are an employment agen-
cy. That is what we are. Seventy-five 
percent of the votes we took last year 
were on appointments. We voted on 26 
amendments last year—26—26. In the 
world’s greatest deliberative body, we 
passed eight amendments in a year. Pa-
thetic. We didn’t consider any of the 
major issues the American people are 
confronting in their lives, not a single 
one—10 years of townhalls with people 
saying to me: MICHAEL, we are killing 
ourselves, and we can’t afford housing, 
healthcare, higher education, early 
childhood education. We cannot save. 
We can’t live a middle-class life. We 
think our kids are going to live a more 
diminished life than we do. 
What does the U.S. Senate do? Cut 
taxes for rich people. We don’t have 
time to do anything else around here. 
And now, when we are the only body on 
planet Earth charged with the respon-
sibility of dealing with the guilt or in-
nocence of this President, we can’t 
even bring ourselves to have witnesses 
and evidence as part of a fair trial, 
even when there are literally witnesses 
with direct knowledge of what the 
President did practically banging on 
the door of the Senate saying: Let me 
testify. 
We are too lazy for that. The reality 
is, we are too broken for that. We are 
too broken for that. And we have failed 
in our duty to the American people. 
Hamilton said in Federalist 65 that in 
an impeachment trial we were the in-
quisitors for the people. The Senate— 
we would be the inquisitors for the peo-
ple. How can you be the inquisitors for 
the people when you don’t even dignify 
the process with evidence and with wit-
nesses? 
I often have school kids come visit 
me here in the Senate, which I really 
enjoy because I used to be the super-
intendent 
of 
the 
Denver 
Public 
Schools. When they come visit me, 
they very often have been on the Mall. 
They have seen the Lincoln Memorial. 
They have seen the Washington Monu-
ment. They have been seen the Su-
preme Court, this Capitol. And there is 
a tendency among them to believe that 
this was just all here, that it was all 
just here. And of course, 230 years ago, 
I tell them, none of it was here. None 
of it was here. It was in the ideas of the 
Founders, the people whom we call the 
Founders, 
who 
did 
two 
incredible 
things in their lifetime, in their gen-
eration, that had never been done be-
fore in human history. They wrote a 
Constitution that would be ratified by 
the people who lived under it. It never 
happened before. They would never 
have imagined that we would have 
lasted 230 years—at least until the age 
of Donald Trump. 
They 
led 
an 
armed 
insurrection 
against a colonial power. We call that 
the Revolutionary War. That succeeded 
too. 
They did something terrible in their 
generation that will last for the rest of 
our days and that is they perpetuated 
human slavery. The building we are 
standing in today was built by enslaved 
human beings because of the decisions 
that they made. 
But I tell the kids who come and 
visit me that there is a reason why 
there are not enslaved human beings in 
this country anymore and that is be-
cause of people like Frederick Doug-
lass. He was born a slave in the United 
States of America, escaped his slavery 
in Maryland, risked his life and limb to 
get to Massachusetts, and he found the 
abolitionist movement there. And the 
abolitionist movement has been argu-
ing for generations that the Constitu-
tion was a pro-slavery document. Fred-
erick Douglass, who is completely self- 
taught, said to them: You have this ex-
actly wrong, exactly backward, 180 de-
grees from the truth. The Constitution 
is an anti-slavery document, Frederick 
Douglass said, not a pro-slavery docu-
ment. 
But we are not living up to the words 
of the Constitution. It is the same 
thing Dr. King said the night before he 
was killed in Memphis when he went 
down there for the striking garbage 
workers and he said: I am here to make 
America keep the promise you wrote 
down on the page. 
In my mind, Frederick Douglass and 
Dr. King are Founders, just as much as 
the people who wrote the Constitution 
of the United States. How could they 
not be? How could they not be? 
The women who fought to give my 
kids, my three daughters, the right to 
vote, who fought for 50 years to get the 
right to vote—mostly women in this 
country—are Founders, just like the 
people who wrote the Constitution, as 
well. 
Over the years that I have been here, 
I have seen this institution crumble 
into rubble. This institution has be-
come incapable of addressing the most 
existential questions of our time that 
the next generation cannot address. 
They can’t fix their own school. They 
can’t fix our immigration system. They 
can’t fix climate change, although they 
are getting less and less patient with 
us on that issue. 
But what I have come to conclude is 
that the responsibility of all of us—not 
just Senators but all of us as citizens 
in a democratic republic—230 years 
after the founding of this Republic, is 
the responsibility of a Founder. It is 
that elevated sense of what a citizen is 
required to do in a republic to sustain 
that republic, and I think that is the 
right way to think about it. It gives 
you a sense of what is really at stake 
beyond the headlines on the cable tele-
vision at night and, certainly, in the 
social media feeds that divide us 
minute to minute in our political life 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S895 
February 5, 2020 
The Senate has clearly failed that 
standard. We have clearly failed that 
standard. The idea that we would turn 
our backs and close our eyes to evi-
dence pounding on the outside of the 
doors of this Capitol is pitiful. It is dis-
graceful, and it will be a stain on this 
body for all time. More than 50 percent 
of the people in this place have said 
that what the President did was wrong. 
It clearly was wrong. It clearly was un-
constitutional. It clearly was impeach-
able. What President would run for of-
fice saying to the American people: I 
am going to try to extort a foreign 
power for my own electoral interest to 
interfere in our elections? It is exactly 
the kind of conduct that the impeach-
ment clause was written for. It is a 
textbook case of why the impeachment 
clause exists. 
But even if you don’t agree with me 
that he should have been convicted or 
that he should be convicted, I don’t 
know how anybody in this body goes 
home and faces their constituents and 
says that we wouldn’t even look at the 
evidence. 
So I say to the American people: Our 
democracy is very much at risk. I am 
not one of those people who believes 
that Donald Trump is the source of all 
our problems. I think he has made mat-
ters much worse, to be sure, but he is 
a symptom of our problem. He is a 
symptom of our failure to tend to the 
democracy—to our responsibility—as 
Founders. And if we don’t begin to take 
that responsibility as seriously as our 
parents and grandparents did—people 
who faced much bigger challenges than 
we ever did—nobody is asking us, 
thank God, to end human slavery. No-
body is asking us to fight for 50 years 
for the self-evident proposition that 
women should have the right to vote. 
We are not marching in Selma, being 
beaten for the self-evident prospect 
that all people are created equal. No-
body is asking us to climb the Cliffs of 
Normandy to fight for freedom in a 
World War. 
But we are being asked to save the 
democracy and we are going to fail 
that test today in the Senate. And my 
prayer for our country is that the 
American people will not fail that test. 
I am optimistic that we will not. We 
have never failed it before, and I don’t 
think we will fail it in our time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, in 
2012, the good people of Wisconsin 
elected me to work for them in the 
Senate. Like every one of my fellow 
Senators, I took an oath of office. In 
2018, I was reelected and I took that 
same oath. We have all taken that 
oath. It is not to support and defend 
the President—this President or any 
other. Our oath is to support and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States. That is our job every day that 
we come to work, and it certainly is 
our job here today. 
Just over 2 weeks ago, we all stood 
together right here and we took an-
other oath given to us by Chief Justice 
Roberts to do impartial judgment in 
this impeachment trial. I have taken 
this responsibility very seriously. I 
have listened to both sides make their 
case. I have reviewed the evidence pre-
sented and I have carefully considered 
the facts. 
From the beginning, I have supported 
a full, fair, and honest impeachment 
trial. A majority of this Senate has 
failed to allow it. I supported the re-
lease of critical evidence that was con-
cealed by the White House. The other 
side of the aisle let President Trump 
hide it from us, and they voted to keep 
it a secret from the American people. I 
voted for testimony of relevant wit-
nesses with direct, firsthand evidence 
about the President’s conduct. Senate 
Republicans blocked witness testimony 
because they didn’t want to be both-
ered with the truth. 
Every Senate impeachment trial in 
our Nation’s history has included wit-
nesses, and this Senate trial should 
have been no different. Unfortunately, 
it was. A majority of the Senate has 
taken the unprecedented step of refus-
ing to hear all the evidence, declining 
all the facts, denying the full truth 
about this President’s corrupt abuse of 
power. President Trump has obstructed 
Congress, and this Senate will let him. 
Last 
month, 
President 
Trump’s 
former 
National 
Security 
Advisor, 
John Bolton, provided an unpublished 
manuscript to the White House. The re-
cent media reports about what Ambas-
sador Bolton could have testified to, 
had he not been blocked as a witness, 
go to the heart of this impeachment 
trial—abuse of power and obstruction 
of Congress. 
As reported, in early May 2019, there 
was an Oval Office meeting that in-
cluded 
President 
Trump, 
Mick 
Mulvaney, 
Pat 
Cipollone, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, and John Bolton. According 
to Mr. Bolton, the President directed 
him to help with his pressure campaign 
to solicit assistance from Ukraine to 
pursue investigations that would not 
only benefit President Trump politi-
cally but would act to exonerate Rus-
sia from their interference in our 2016 
elections. 
Several weeks later, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense certified the release of 
military aid to Ukraine, concluding 
that they had taken substantial ac-
tions to decrease corruption. This was 
part of the security assistance we ap-
proved in Congress with bipartisan sup-
port to help Ukraine fight Russian ag-
gression. However, President Trump 
blocked it and covered it up from Con-
gress. 
On July 25, 2019, as President Trump 
was 
withholding 
the 
support 
for 
Ukraine, he had a telephone call with 
Ukrainian President Zelensky. Based 
on a White House call summary memo 
that was released 2 months later, we 
all know the President put his own po-
litical interest ahead of our national 
security and the integrity of our elec-
tions. 
Based on the clear and convincing 
evidence presented in this trial, we 
know President Trump used American 
taxpayer dollars in security assistance 
in order to get Ukraine to interfere in 
our elections to help him politically. 
We know the President solicited assist-
ance from Ukraine to pursue an inves-
tigation of phony conspiracy theories 
about our 2016 U.S. elections that are a 
part of a Russian disinformation cam-
paign. We know the President solicited 
assistance from Ukraine to discredit 
the conclusion by American law en-
forcement, the U.S. intelligence com-
munity, and confirmed by a bipartisan 
Senate report that Russia interfered 
with our 2016 elections. We also know 
President Trump solicited foreign in-
terference in the upcoming election by 
pressuring Ukraine to publicly an-
nounce investigations to help him po-
litically. 
I ask my friends to consider the fact 
that the Ukrainian President was pres-
sured and prepared to go on an Amer-
ican cable television network to an-
nounce these political investigations. 
To those who are making the argu-
ment to acquit the President because 
to convict would create further divi-
sion in our country, I ask you to ac-
knowledge the fact that President 
Trump’s corrupt scheme has given Rus-
sia another opening to attack our de-
mocracy, interfere in our elections, and 
further divide our already divided 
country. We know this to be true, but 
the Senate is choosing to ignore the 
truth. 
As reported just weeks after the 
Zelensky call, President Trump told 
Ambassador Bolton in August that he 
wanted to continue freezing $391 mil-
lion in security assistance to Ukraine 
until it helped with the political inves-
tigations. Had Ambassador Bolton tes-
tified to these facts in this trial, it 
would have directly contradicted what 
the President told Senator JOHNSON in 
a phone call on August 31, 2019, in 
which, according to Senator JOHNSON, 
the President said: 
I would never do that. Who told you that? 
John Bolton not only has direct evi-
dence that implicates President Trump 
in a corrupt abuse of power, but he has 
direct evidence that President Trump 
lied to one of our colleagues in an at-
tempt to cover it up. It may not mat-
ter to this Senate, but I can tell you 
that it matters to the people of the 
State of Wisconsin that this President 
did not tell their Senator the truth. 
Based on the facts presented to us, I 
refuse to join this President’s coverup, 
and I refuse to conclude that the Presi-
dent’s abuse of power doesn’t matter, 
that it is OK, and that we should just 
get over it. 
I recognize the courageous public 
servants who did what this Senate has 
failed to do—to put our country first. 
In the House impeachment inquiry, 
brave government servants came for-
ward and told the truth. They put their 
jobs on the line. Instead of inspiring us 
to do our duty—to do our jobs—they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S896 
February 5, 2020 
have 
faced 
character 
assassination 
from this President, the White House, 
and some of my colleagues here in the 
Senate. It is a disgrace to this institu-
tion that they have been treated as 
anything less than the patriots they 
are. 
As Army LTC Alexander Vindman 
said, ‘‘This is America. Here, right 
matters.’’ 
My judgment is inspired by these 
words, and I am guided to my commit-
ment to put country before party and 
our Constitution first. 
My vote on the President’s abuse of 
power and obstruction of Congress is a 
vote to uphold my oath of office and to 
support and defend the Constitution. 
My vote is a vote to uphold the rule of 
law and our uniquely American prin-
ciple that no one—not even the Presi-
dent—is above the law. I only have 1 of 
100 votes in the U.S. Senate, and I am 
afraid that the majority is putting this 
President above the law by not con-
victing him of these impeachable of-
fenses. 
Let’s be clear. This is not an exonera-
tion of President Trump. It is a failure 
to show moral courage and hold this 
President accountable. 
Now every American will have the 
power to make his or her own judg-
ment. Every American gets to decide 
what is in our public interest. We the 
people get to choose what is in our na-
tional interest. I trust the American 
people. I know they will be guided by 
our common good and the truth. The 
people we work for know what the 
truth is, and they know, in America, it 
matters. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, it 
is important to remind ourselves, at 
moments like this, how unnatural and 
uncommon democracy really is. 
Just think of all of the important fo-
rums in your life. Think about your 
workplace, your family, your favorite 
sports team. None of them makes deci-
sions by democratic vote. The CEO de-
cides how much money you are going 
to make. It is not by the vote of your 
fellow employees. You love your kids, 
but they don’t get an equal say in 
household matters as mom and dad do. 
The plays the Chiefs called on their 
game-winning drives were not decided 
by a team vote. 
No, most everything in our lives that 
matters, other than the government 
under which we live, is not run by 
democratic vote, and, of course, a tiny 
percentage of humans—well under 1 
percent—have lived in a democratic so-
ciety over the last thousand years of 
human history. 
Democracy is unnatural. It is rare. It 
is delicate. It is fragile, and untended 
to, neglected, or taken for granted, it 
will disappear like ashes that scatter 
into the cold night. 
This body—the U.S. Senate—was con-
ceived by our Founders to be the ulti-
mate guardians of this brittle experi-
ment in governance. We, the 100 of us, 
were given the responsibility to keep it 
safe from those who may deign to harm 
it, and when the Senate lives up to this 
charge, it is an awesome, inspirational 
sight to behold. 
I was born 3 weeks after Alexander 
Butterfield revealed the existence of a 
taping system in the White House that 
likely held evidence of President Nix-
on’s crimes, and I was born 1 week 
after the Senate Watergate Committee, 
in a bipartisan vote, ordered Nixon to 
turn over several key tapes. 
Now, my parents were Republicans. 
My mom is still a Republican. Over the 
years, they have voted for a lot of 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans. 
They 
raised me, in the shadow of Watergate, 
to understand that what mattered in 
politics wasn’t really someone’s party. 
It was whether you were honest and de-
cent and if you were pursuing office for 
the right reasons. 
In the year I was born, this Senate 
watched a President betray the Nation, 
and this Senate—both Democrats and 
Republicans—stood together to protect 
the country from this betrayal. This is 
exactly what our Founders envisioned 
when they gave the Congress the mas-
sive responsibility of the impeachment 
power. They said to use it sparingly, to 
use it not to settle political scores but 
to use it when a President has strayed 
from the bonds of decency and pro-
priety. 
The Founders wanted Congress to 
save the country from bad men who 
would try to use the awesome power of 
the executive branch to enrich them-
selves or to win office illicitly, and I 
grew up under the belief that, when 
those bad men presented themselves, 
this place had the ability to put aside 
party and work to protect our fragile 
democracy from attack. 
This attack on our Republic that we 
are debating today, if left unchecked, 
is potentially lethal. The one sacred 
covenant that an American President 
makes with the governed is to use the 
massive power of the executive branch 
for the good of the country, not for per-
sonal financial or political benefit. The 
difference between a democracy and a 
tin-pot dictatorship is that, here, we 
don’t allow Presidents to use the offi-
cial levers of power to destroy political 
opponents. Yet that is exactly what 
President Trump did, and we all know 
it. Even the Republicans who are going 
to vote to acquit him today admit 
that. If you think that our endorse-
ment through acquittal will not have 
an impact, then, just look at Rudy 
Giuliani’s trip to Ukraine in December, 
which was in the middle of the im-
peachment process. He went back, 
looking for more dirt, and the Presi-
dent was ringing him up to get the de-
tails before Giuliani’s plane even hit 
the 
gate. 
The 
corruption 
hasn’t 
stopped. It is ongoing. If this is the new 
normal—the new means by which a 
President can consolidate power and 
try to destroy political opponents— 
then we are no longer living in Amer-
ica. 
What happened here over the last 2 
weeks is as much a corruption as 
Trump’s scheme was. This trial was 
simply 
an 
extension 
of 
Trump’s 
crimes—no documents, no witnesses. It 
was the first-ever impeachment trial in 
the 
Senate 
without 
either. 
John 
Bolton, in his practically begging to 
come here and tell his firsthand ac-
count of the President’s corruption, 
was denied—just to make sure that 
voters couldn’t hear his story in time 
for them to be able to pressure their 
Senators prior to an impeachment 
vote. 
This was a show trial—a gift-wrapped 
present for a grateful party leader. We 
became complicit in the very attacks 
on democracy that this body is sup-
posed to guard against. We have failed 
to protect the Republic. 
What is so interesting to me is that 
it is not like the Republicans didn’t see 
this moment coming. In fact, many of 
my colleagues across the aisle literally 
predicted it. Prior to the President’s 
election, here is what the Republican 
Senators said about Donald Trump. 
One said: 
He is shallow. He is ill-prepared to be Com-
mander in Chief. I think he is crazy. I think 
he is unfit for office. 
Another said: 
The man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t 
know the difference between truth and lies. 
Yet another Republican Senator said: 
What we are dealing with is a con artist. 
He is a con artist. 
Now, you can shrug this off as elec-
tion-year rhetoric, but no Democrat 
has ever said these kinds of things 
about a candidate from our party, and 
prior to Trump, no Republican had said 
such things about candidates from 
their party either. The truth is the Re-
publicans, before Trump became the 
head of their party, knew exactly how 
dangerous he was and how dangerous 
he would be if he won. They knew he 
was the archetype of that bad man the 
Founders intended the Senate to pro-
tect democracy from. 
That 
responsibility 
seems 
to 
no 
longer retain a position of primacy in 
this body today. The rule of law 
doesn’t seem to come first today. Our 
commitment to upholding decency and 
truth and honor is not the priority 
today. In the modern Senate today, all 
that seems to matter is party. What is 
different about this impeachment is 
not that the Democrats have chosen to 
make it partisan. It is that the Repub-
licans have chosen to excuse their par-
ty’s President’s conduct in a way that 
they would not have done and did not 
do 45 years ago. That is what makes 
this moment exceptional. 
Now, Congressman SCHIFF, in his 
closing argument, rightly challenged 
the Democrats to think about what we 
would do if a President of our party 
ever committed the same kind of of-
fense that Donald Trump has. I think 
it was a very wise query and one that 
we as Democrats should not be so 
quick on the trigger to answer self- 
righteously.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S897 
February 5, 2020 
Would we have the courage to stand 
up to our base, to our political sup-
porters, and vote to remove a Demo-
cratic President who had chosen to 
trade away the safety of the Nation for 
political help? It would not be easy. 
No, the easy thing to do would be to 
just do what is happening today—to 
box our ears, close our eyes, and just 
hope the corruption goes away. 
So I have thought a lot about this 
question over these past 2 days, and I 
have come to the conclusion that, at 
least for me, I would hold the Demo-
crats to the same standard. I would 
vote to remove. But I admit to some 
level of doubt, and I think that I need 
to be honest about that because the 
pressures today to put party first are 
real on both sides of the aisle, and they 
are much more acute today than they 
were during Watergate. 
It is with that reality as context that 
I prepare to vote today. I believe that 
the President’s crimes are worthy of 
removal. I will vote to convict on both 
Articles of Impeachment. 
But I know that something is rotten 
in the state of Denmark. Ours is an in-
stitution built to put country above 
party, and today we are doing, often, 
the opposite. I believe within the cult 
of personality that has become the 
Trump Presidency, the disease is more 
acute and more perilous to the Na-
tion’s health on the Republican side of 
the ledger, but I admit this affliction 
has spread to all corners of this Cham-
ber. 
If we are to survive as a democracy— 
a fragile, delicate, constantly in need 
of tending democracy—then this Sen-
ate needs to figure out a way after 
today to reorder our incentive system 
and recalibrate our faiths so that the 
health of one party never ever again 
comes before the health of our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, the 
Constitution is at the foundation of 
our Republic’s success, and we each 
strive not to lose sight of our promise 
to defend it. 
The Constitution established a vehi-
cle of impeachment that has occupied 
both Houses of our Congress these 
many days. We have labored to faith-
fully execute our responsibilities to it. 
We have arrived at different judg-
ments, but I hope we respect each oth-
er’s good faith. 
The allegations made in the Articles 
of Impeachment are very serious. As a 
Senator juror, I swore an oath before 
God to exercise impartial justice. I am 
profoundly religious. My faith is at the 
heart of who I am. I take an oath be-
fore God as enormously consequential. 
I knew from the outset that being 
tasked with judging the President—the 
leader of my own party—would be the 
most difficult decision I have ever 
faced. I was not wrong. 
The House managers presented evi-
dence supporting their case, and the 
White House counsel disputed that 
case. 
In addition, the President’s team pre-
sented three defenses: first, that there 
could be no impeachment without a 
statutory 
crime; 
second, 
that 
the 
Bidens’ conduct justified the Presi-
dent’s actions; and third, that the judg-
ment of the President’s actions should 
be left to the voters. Let me first ad-
dress those three defenses. 
The historic meaning of the words 
‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’’ the 
writings of the Founders, and my own 
reasoned judgment convinced me that 
a President can indeed commit acts 
against the public trust that are so 
egregious that, while they are not stat-
utory crimes, they would demand re-
moval from office. 
To maintain that the lack of a codi-
fied and comprehensive list of all the 
outrageous acts that a President might 
conceivably commit renders Congress 
powerless to remove such a President 
defies reason. 
The President’s counsel also notes 
that Vice President Biden appeared to 
have a conflict of interest when he un-
dertook 
an 
effort 
to 
remove 
the 
Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he 
knew of the exorbitant compensation 
his son was receiving from a company 
actually under investigation, the Vice 
President should have recused himself. 
While ignoring a conflict of interest is 
not a crime, it is surely very wrong. 
With regard to Hunter Biden, taking 
excessive advantage of his father’s 
name is unsavory but also not a crime. 
Given that in neither the case of the 
father nor the son was any evidence 
presented by the President’s counsel 
that a crime had been committed, the 
President’s insistence that they be in-
vestigated by the Ukrainians is hard to 
explain other than as a political pur-
suit. There is no question in my mind 
that were their names not Biden, the 
President would never have done what 
he did. 
The defense argues that the Senate 
should leave the impeachment decision 
to the voters. While that logic is ap-
pealing to our democratic instincts, it 
is inconsistent with the Constitution’s 
requirement that the Senate, not the 
voters, try the President. Hamilton ex-
plained that the Founders’ decision to 
invest Senators with this obligation 
rather than leave it to the voters was 
intended to minimize to the extent pos-
sible the partisan sentiments of the 
public at large. So the verdict is ours 
to render under our Constitution. The 
people will judge us for how well and 
faithfully we fulfill our duty. 
The grave question the Constitution 
tasks Senators to answer is whether 
the President committed an act so ex-
treme and egregious that it rises to the 
level of a high crime and misdemeanor. 
Yes, he did. The President asked a for-
eign government to investigate his po-
litical rival. The President withheld 
vital military funds from that govern-
ment to press it to do so. The President 
delayed funds for an American ally at 
war with Russian invaders. The Presi-
dent’s purpose was personal and polit-
ical. Accordingly, the President is 
guilty of an appalling abuse of public 
trust. 
What he did was not ‘‘perfect.’’ No, it 
was a flagrant assault on our electoral 
rights, our national security, and our 
fundamental 
values. 
Corrupting 
an 
election to keep one’s self in office is 
perhaps the most abusive and destruc-
tive violation of one’s oath of office 
that I can imagine. 
In the last several weeks, I have re-
ceived numerous calls and texts. Many 
demanded, in their words, that I ‘‘stand 
with the team.’’ I can assure you that 
thought has been very much in my 
mind. You see, I support a great deal of 
what the President has done. I have 
voted with him 80 percent of the time. 
But my promise before God to apply 
impartial justice required that I put 
my personal feelings and political bi-
ases aside. Were I to ignore the evi-
dence that has been presented and dis-
regard what I believe my oath and the 
Constitution demands of me for the 
sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, 
expose my character to history’s re-
buke and the censure of my own con-
science. 
I am aware that there are people in 
my party and in my State who will 
strenuously disapprove of my decision, 
and in some quarters, I will be vehe-
mently denounced. I am sure to hear 
abuse from the President and his sup-
porters. Does anyone seriously believe 
that I would consent to these con-
sequences other than from an inescap-
able conviction that my oath before 
God demanded it of me? 
I sought to hear testimony from 
John Bolton, not only because I believe 
he could add context to the charges but 
also because I hoped that what he 
might say could raise reasonable doubt 
and thus remove from me the awful ob-
ligation to vote for impeachment. 
Like each Member of this delibera-
tive body, I love our country. I believe 
that our Constitution was inspired by 
providence. I am convinced that free-
dom itself is dependent on the strength 
and vitality of our national character. 
As it is with each Senator, my vote is 
an act of conviction. We have come to 
different conclusions, fellow Senators, 
but I trust we have all followed the dic-
tates of our conscience. 
I acknowledge that my verdict will 
not remove the President from office. 
The results of this Senate court will, in 
fact, be appealed to a higher court—the 
judgment of the American people. Vot-
ers will make the final decision, just as 
the President’s lawyers have implored. 
My vote will likely be in the minority 
in the Senate. But irrespective of these 
things, with my vote, I will tell my 
children and their children that I did 
my duty to the best of my ability, be-
lieving that my country expected it of 
me. 
I will only be one name among 
many—no more, no less—to future gen-
erations of Americans who look at the 
record of this trial. They will note 
merely that I was among the Senators

who determined that what the Presi-
dent did was wrong, grievously wrong. 
We are all footnotes at best in the 
annals of history, but in the most pow-
erful Nation on Earth, the Nation con-
ceived in liberty and justice, that dis-
tinction is enough for any citizen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, over the past few weeks, we 
have heard a lot of arguments, accusa-
tions, and anecdotes. Some very skilled 
speakers on both sides have presented 
their case both for and against im-
peachment. 
I listened intently, hour after hour, 
day after day, to the House managers 
and the President’s lawyers, and the 
word that kept coming to me, that I 
kept writing down in my notes was 
‘‘fairness’’ because, you see, here in 
America you are innocent until proven 
guilty. 
As the President’s defense team 
noted, ‘‘[A]t the foundation of those 
authentic forms of justice is funda-
mental fairness. It’s playing by the 
rules. It’s why we don’t allow deflated 
footballs or stealing signs from the 
field. Rules are rules. They’re there to 
be followed.’’ 
You can create all the rhetorical im-
agery in the world, but without the 
facts to prove guilt, it doesn’t mean a 
thing. They can say the President can-
not be trusted, but without proving 
why he can’t be trusted, their words 
are just empty political attacks. 
You can speak of David v. Goliath, 
but if you were the one trying to sub-
vert the presumption of innocence, if 
you were the one to will facts into ex-
istence, you are not David; you have 
become Goliath. 
Our job here in the Senate is to en-
sure a fair trial based on the evidence 
gathered by the House. I have been ac-
cused, as have many of my colleagues, 
of not wanting that fair trial. The 
exact opposite is true. We have ensured 
a fair trial in the Senate after House 
Democrats abused historical prece-
dents in their zeal to impeach a Presi-
dent they simply do not like. 
During 
prior 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings in the last 50 years—lasting 
around 75 days or so in the House—the 
House’s opposing party was allowed 
witnesses and the ability to cross-ex-
amine. This time, House Republicans 
were locked out of the first 71 of 78 
days. Let me say that differently. The 
ability to cross-examine the witnesses 
who are coming before the House 
against the President, the House Re-
publicans and the President’s team 
were not allowed to cross-examine 
those witnesses. The ability to con-
tradict and/or to cross-examine or have 
a conversation about the evidence at 
the foundation of the trial? The White 
House counsel and Republicans were 
not allowed. Think about the concept 
of due process. The House Republicans 
and President’s team, were not allowed 
for 71 of 78 days in the House. This is 
not a fair process. Does that sound fair 
to you? 
Democrats began talking about im-
peachment within months of President 
Trump’s election and have made it 
clear that their No. 1 goal—perhaps 
their only goal—has been to remove 
him from office. Does that sound fair 
to you? 
They have said: ‘‘We are going to im-
peach the . . . ’’ and used an expletive. 
They said: ‘‘We have to impeach him, 
otherwise he’s going to win the elec-
tion.’’ Now that might be the trans-
parency we have been looking for in 
this process—the real root or founda-
tion of why we found ourselves here for 
60 hours of testimony. It might be be-
cause, as they said themselves, if we 
don’t impeach him, he might just win. 
What an amazing thought that the 
American people and not Members of 
Congress would decide the Presidency 
of the United States. What a novel con-
cept that the House managers and Con-
gress would not remove his name from 
the ballot in 2020, but we would allow 
the American people to decide the fate 
of this President and of the Presidency. 
They don’t get it. They don’t under-
stand that the American people should 
be and are the final arbiters of what 
happens. They want to make not only 
the President vulnerable, but they 
want to make Republican Senators vul-
nerable so that they can control the 
majority of the U.S. Senate because 
the facts are not winning for them. The 
facts are winning for us because when 
you look at the facts, they are not 
their facts and our facts, they are just 
the facts. What I have learned from 
watching the House managers who 
were very convincing—they were very 
convincing the first day—and after 
that what we realized was, some facts 
mixed with a little fiction led to 100 
percent deception. You cannot mix 
facts and fiction without having the 
premise of deceiving the American pub-
lic, and that is what we saw here in our 
Chamber. 
Why is that the case? It is simple. 
When you look at the facts of this 
Presidency, you come to a few conclu-
sions that are, in fact, indisputable. 
One of those conclusions is that our 
economy is booming, and it is not sim-
ply booming from the top. When you 
start looking into the crosstabs, as I 
like to say, what you find is that the 
bottom 20 percent are seeing increases 
that the top 20 percent are not seeing. 
So this economy is working for the 
most vulnerable Americans, and that is 
challenging to our friends on the other 
side. 
When you think about the fact that 
the opportunity zone legislation sup-
ported by this President is bringing $67 
billion of private sector dollars into 
the most vulnerable communities, that 
is challenging to the other side, but 
those, too, are facts. When you think 
about the essence of criminal justice 
reform and making communities safer 
and having a fairer justice system for 
those who are incarcerated, that is 
challenging to the other side, but it is, 
indeed, a fact, driven home by the Re-
publican Party and President Donald 
John Trump. These facts do have con-
sequences, just like elections. 
Our friends on the other side, unfor-
tunately, decided that if they could not 
beat him at the polls, give Congress an 
opportunity to, in fact, impeach the 
President. My friends on the left sim-
ply don’t want a fair process. This 
process has lacked fairness. Instead, 
they paint their efforts as fighting on 
behalf of democracy when, in fact, they 
are just working on behalf of Demo-
crats. That is not fair. It is not what 
the American people deserve. 
House managers said over and over 
again, the Senate had to protect our 
Nation’s free and fair elections, but 
they are seeking to overturn a fairly 
won election with absurd charges. 
The House managers said over and 
over again that the Senate has to allow 
new witnesses so as to make the Sen-
ate trial fair, but they didn’t bother 
with the notion of fairness when they 
were in charge in the House. 
Their notion of fairness is to give the 
prosecution do-overs and extra latitude 
but not the defendants. 
Actions speak louder than words, and 
the Democrats’ actions have said all we 
need to hear. 
Let’s vote no on these motions today 
and get back to working for the Amer-
ican people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, the last 
time this body—the last time the Sen-
ate—debated the fate of a Presidency 
in the context of impeachment, the 
legendary Senator from West Virginia, 
Robert Byrd, rose and said: 
I think my country sinks beneath the 
yoke. It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a 
gash is added to her wounds. 
Our country today, as then, is in 
pain. We are deeply divided, and most 
days, it seems to me that we here are 
the ones wielding the shiv, not the 
salve. 
The Founders gave this Senate the 
sole power to try impeachments be-
cause, as Alexander Hamilton wrote: 
‘‘Where else than in the Senate could 
have been found a tribunal sufficiently 
dignified, or sufficiently independent?’’ 
I wish I could say with confidence 
that we here have lived up to the faith 
our Founders entrusted in us. Unfortu-
nately, I fear, in this impeachment 
trial, the Senate has failed a historic 
test of our ability to put country over 
party. 
Foreign interference in our democ-
racy has posed a grave threat to our 
Nation since its very founding. James 
Madison wrote that impeachment was 
an ‘‘indispensable’’ check against a 
President who would ‘‘betray his trust 
to foreign powers.’’ 
The threat of foreign interference re-
mains grave and real to this day. It is 
indisputable that Russia attacked our 
2016 election and interfered in it broad-
ly. President Trump’s own FBI Direc-
tor and Director of National Intel-
ligence have warned us they are intent

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S899 
February 5, 2020 
on interfering in our election this com-
ing fall. 
So, to my Republican colleagues, I 
have frankly found it difficult to un-
derstand why you would continue to so 
fervently support a President who has 
repeatedly and publicly invited foreign 
interference in our elections. 
During his 2016 campaign, Donald 
Trump looked straight into the cam-
eras at a press conference and said: 
Russia, if you’re listening, I hope 
you’re able to find Secretary Clinton’s 
30,000 emails. 
We now know with certainty that 
Russian military intelligence hackers 
first attempted to break into Secretary 
Clinton’s office servers for the first 
time that very day. Throughout his 
campaign, President Trump praised the 
publication of emails that Russian 
hackers had stolen from his political 
opponent. 
He 
mercilessly 
attacked 
former FBI Director Robert Mueller 
throughout his investigation into the 
2016 election and allegations of Russian 
interference. 
Now we know, following this trial, 
that the day after Special Counsel 
Mueller testified about his investiga-
tion 
to 
this 
Congress, 
President 
Trump, on a phone call with the Presi-
dent of Ukraine, asked for a favor. He 
asked President Zelensky to announce 
an investigation of his chief political 
rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, 
and he asked for an investigation into 
a Russian conspiracy theory about that 
DNC server. In the weeks and the 
months since, he has repeated that 
Ukraine should investigate his polit-
ical opponent and that China should as 
well. 
During the trial here, after the House 
managers and President’s counsel made 
their presentation, Senators had the 
opportunity to ask questions. I asked a 
question of the President’s lawyers 
about a sentence in their own trial 
brief that stated: ‘‘Congress has forbid-
den foreigners’ involvement in Amer-
ican elections.’’ 
I simply asked whether the Presi-
dent’s own attorneys believed their cli-
ent, President Trump, agrees with that 
statement, and they refused to confirm 
that he does. And how could they when 
he has repeatedly invited and solicited 
foreign interference in our elections? 
So, to my colleagues: Do you doubt 
that President Trump did what he is 
accused of? Do you doubt he would do 
it again? Do you think for even one 
moment he would refuse the help of 
foreign agents to smear any one of us if 
he thought it was in his best political 
interest? And I have to ask: What be-
comes of our democracy when elections 
become a no-holds-barred blood sport, 
when our foreign adversaries become 
our allies, and when Americans of the 
opposing party become our enemies? 
Throughout this trial, I have listened 
to the arguments of the House man-
agers prosecuting the case against 
President Trump and of the arguments 
of counsel defending the President. I 
engaged with colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle and listened to their posi-
tions. 
The President’s counsel have warned 
us of danger in partisan impeachments. 
They have cautioned that abuse of 
power—the first article—is a difficult 
standard to define. They have ex-
pressed deep concern about an im-
peachment conducted on the brink of 
our next Presidential election. 
I understand those concerns and even 
share some of them. The House man-
agers, in turn, warned us that our 
President has demonstrated a perilous 
willingness to seek foreign interference 
in our elections and presented signifi-
cant evidence that the President with-
held foreign aid from a vulnerable ally, 
not to serve our national interest but 
to attack a political opponent. They 
demonstrated the President has cat-
egorically obstructed congressional in-
vestigations to cover up his mis-
conduct. These are serious dangers too. 
We, then, are faced with a choice be-
tween serious and significant dangers. 
After listening closely to the evidence, 
weighing the arguments, and reflecting 
on my constitutional responsibility 
and my oath to do impartial justice, I 
have decided today I will vote guilty on 
both articles. 
I recognize that many of my col-
leagues have made up their minds. No 
matter 
what 
decision 
you 
have 
reached, I think it is a sad day for our 
country. I myself have never been on a 
crusade to impeach Donald Trump, as 
has been alleged against all Democrats. 
I have sought ways to work across the 
aisle with his administration, but in 
the years that have followed his elec-
tion, I have increasingly become con-
vinced our President is not just uncon-
ventional, not just testing the bound-
aries of our norms and traditions, but 
he is at times unmoored. 
Throughout this trial, I have heard 
from Delawareans who are frustrated 
the Senate refused to hear from wit-
nesses or subpoena documents needed 
to uncover all the facts about the 
President’s misconduct. I have heard 
from Delawareans who fear our Presi-
dent believes he is above the law and 
that he acts as if he is the law. I have 
also heard from Delawareans who just 
want us to find a way to work together. 
It is my sincere regret that, with all 
the time we have spent together, we 
could not find common ground at all. 
From the opening resolution that set 
the procedures for trial adopted on a 
party-line basis, the majority leader 
refused all attempts to make this a 
more open and more fair process. Every 
Democrat was willing to have Chief 
Justice Roberts rule on motions to sub-
poena relevant witnesses and docu-
ments. Every Member of the opposing 
party refused. We could not even forge 
a consensus to call a single witness 
who has said he has firsthand evidence, 
who is willing to testify and was even 
preparing to appear before us. 
When an impeachment trial becomes 
meaningless, 
we 
are 
damaged 
and 
weakened as a body, and our Constitu-
tion suffers in ways not easily repaired. 
We have a President who hasn’t turned 
over a single scrap of paper in an im-
peachment investigation. Unlike Presi-
dents Nixon and Clinton before him, 
who directed their senior advisers and 
Cabinet officials to cooperate, Presi-
dent Trump stonewalled every step of 
this Congress’s impeachment inquiry 
and then personally attacked those 
who cooperated. The people who testi-
fied to the House of Representatives in 
spite of the President’s orders are dedi-
cated public servants and deserve our 
thanks, not condemnation. 
Where do we go from here? Well, 
after President Clinton’s impeachment 
trial, he said: ‘‘This can be and must be 
a time of reconciliation and renewal 
for [our country],’’ and he apologized 
for the harm he had done to our Na-
tion. 
When President Nixon announced his 
resignation, he said: ‘‘The first essen-
tial is to begin healing the wounds of 
this Nation.’’ 
I wish President Trump would use 
this moment to bring our country to-
gether, to assure us he would work to 
make the 2020 election a fair contest; 
that he would tell Russia and China to 
stay out of our elections; that he would 
tell the American people, whoever his 
opponent might be, the fight will be be-
tween candidates, not families; that if 
he loses, he will leave peacefully, in a 
dignified manner; and that if he wins, 
he will work tirelessly to be the Presi-
dent for all people. 
But at this point, some might sug-
gest it would be hopelessly naive to ex-
pect of President Trump that he would 
apologize or strive to heal our country 
or do the important work of safe-
guarding our next election. So that 
falls to us. 
To my colleagues who have con-
cluded impeachment is too heavy a 
hammer to wield, if you believe the 
American people should decide the fate 
of this President in the next election, 
what will you do to protect our democ-
racy? What will you do to ensure the 
American people learn the truth of 
what happened so that they can cast 
informed votes? Will you cosponsor 
bills to secure our elections? Will you 
insist they receive votes on this floor? 
Will you express support for the intel-
ligence community that is working to 
keep our country safe? Will you ensure 
whistleblowers who expose corruption 
are protected, not vilified? Will you 
press this administration to cooperate 
with investigations and to allow mean-
ingful accommodations so that Con-
gress can have its power of oversight? 
Why can we not do this together? 
Each day of this trial, we have said 
the Pledge of Allegiance to our com-
mon 
Nation. 
For 
my 
Republican 
friends who have concluded the voters 
should decide President Trump’s fate, 
we need to do more together to make 
that possible. Many of my Democratic 
friends, I know, are poised to do their 
very best to defeat President Trump at 
the ballot box. 
So here is my plea—that we would 
find ways to work together to defend

our democracy and safeguard our next 
election. We have spent more time to-
gether here in the last few weeks than 
in the last few years. Imagine if we 
dedicated that same time to passing 
the dozens of bipartisan bills that have 
come over from the House that are 
awaiting action. Imagine what we 
could accomplish for our States and 
our country if we actually tackled the 
challenges of affordable healthcare and 
ending the opioid crisis, making our 
schools and communities safer, and 
bridging our profound disagreements. 
What fills me with dread, to my col-
leagues, is that each day we come to 
this floor and talk past each other and 
not to each other and fail to help our 
constituents. 
Let me close by paraphrasing our 
Chaplain—Chaplain 
Black—whose 
daily 
prayers 
brought 
me 
great 
strength in recent weeks: May we work 
together to bring peace and unity. May 
we permit Godliness to make us bold as 
lions. May we see a clear vision of our 
Lord’s desire for our Nation and re-
member we borrow our heartbeats from 
our Creator each day. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, over 
the last several months and last sev-
eral weeks, the American people have 
watched Washington convulse in par-
tisan accusations, investigations, and 
endless 
acrimony. 
That 
division 
reached its high watermark as the U.S. 
Senate carried out the third Presi-
dential impeachment trial in our Na-
tion’s history. 
We saw, over the last 2 weeks, an im-
peachment process that included the 
testimony of 17 witnesses, more than 
100 hours of testimony, and tens of 
thousands of pages of evidence, records, 
and documents, which I successfully 
fought to make part of the record. I 
fought hard to extend the duration of 
testimony to ensure that each side 
could be heard over 6 days instead of 
just 4. But what we did not see over the 
last 2 weeks was a conclusive reason to 
remove the President of the United 
States—an act which would nullify the 
2016 election and rob roughly half the 
country of their preferred candidate for 
the 2020 elections. 
House managers repeatedly stated 
that 
they 
had 
established 
‘‘over-
whelming evidence’’ and an ‘‘airtight’’ 
case to remove the President. Yet they 
also repeatedly claimed they needed 
additional 
investigation 
and 
testi-
mony. A case cannot be both ‘‘over-
whelming’’ and ‘‘airtight’’ and yet in-
complete at the same time. That con-
tradiction is not mere semantics. 
In their partisan—their partisan— 
race to impeach, the House failed to do 
the fundamental work required to 
prove its case, to meet the heavy bur-
den. For the Senate to ignore this defi-
ciency and conduct its own investiga-
tion would weaponize the impeachment 
power. A House majority could simply 
short-circuit 
an 
investigation, 
im-
peach, and demand the Senate com-
plete the House’s work—what they 
were asking us to do. 
The Founders were concerned about 
this very point. Alexander Hamilton 
wrote, 
regarding 
impeachments: 
‘‘[T]here will always be the greatest 
danger that the decision will be regu-
lated 
more 
by 
the 
comparative 
strength of parties, than by real dem-
onstrations of innocence or guilt.’’ 
More recently, Congressman JERRY 
NADLER, one of the House managers in 
the trial, said: 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment substantially 
supported by one of our major political par-
ties and largely opposed by the other. Such 
an impeachment will lack legitimacy. 
Last March, Speaker NANCY PELOSI 
said: ‘‘Impeachment is so divisive to 
the country that unless there’s some-
thing so compelling and overwhelming 
and bipartisan, I don’t think we should 
go down that path, because it divides 
the country.’’ 
The Framers knew that partisan im-
peachments could lead to impeach-
ments 
over 
policy 
disagreements. 
Legal scholars like Charles Black have 
written that policy differences are not 
grounds for impeachment. But policy 
differences about corruption and the 
proper use of tax dollars are at the 
very heart of this impeachment. Never-
theless, that disagreement led the 
House to deploy this most serious of 
constitutional remedies. 
The reason the Framers were con-
cerned about partisan or policy im-
peachments was their concern for the 
American people. Removing a Presi-
dent disenfranchises the American peo-
ple. For a Senate of only 100 people, to 
do that requires a genuine, bipartisan, 
national consensus. Here, especially 
only 9 months before an election, I can-
not pretend the people will accept this 
body removing a President who re-
ceived nearly 63 million votes without 
meeting that high burden. 
The House managers’ other argument 
to remove the President—obstruction 
of Congress—is an affront to the Con-
stitution. The Framers created a sys-
tem of government in which the legis-
lative, executive, and the judiciary are 
evenly balanced. The Framers con-
sciously diluted each branch’s power, 
making all three separate but equal 
and empowered to check each other. 
The obstruction charge assumes the 
House is superior to the executive 
branch. In their zeal, the House man-
agers would disempower the judiciary 
and demand that the House’s interpre-
tation of the sole power of impeach-
ment be accepted by the Senate and 
the other branches without question. 
They claim no constitutional privilege 
exists to protect the executive branch 
against the legislature seeking im-
peachment. They go further and claim 
that a single Justice—a single Jus-
tice—exercising 
the 
Senate’s 
sole 
power to try impeachments, can actu-
ally strip the executive of its constitu-
tional protections with a simple de-
cree. 
In Federalist 78, Hamilton wrote: 
‘‘[L]iberty can have nothing to fear 
from the judiciary alone, but would 
have everything to fear from its union 
with either of the other departments.’’ 
If the House managers prevail, the 
House would have destroyed our con-
stitutional balance, declaring itself the 
arbiter of constitutional rights and 
conscripting the Chief Justice to do it. 
To be clear, the executive branch is 
not immune from legislative oversight 
or impeachment and trial, but that 
cannot come at the expense of con-
stitutional rights—certainly not with-
out input from the judiciary. After all, 
since Marbury v. Madison, ‘‘[i]t is em-
phatically the duty of the Judicial De-
partment to say what the law is.’’ 
Without this separation, nothing stops 
the House from seeking privileged in-
formation under the guise of an im-
peachment inquiry. 
But the House managers say that no 
matter how flimsy the House’s case, if 
the Executive tries to protect that in-
formation constitutionally, that itself 
is an impeachable offense. That dan-
gerous precedent would weaken the 
stability 
of 
government—constantly 
threatening the President with re-
moval and setting the stage for a con-
stitutional crisis without recourse to 
the courts. With that precedent set, 
the separation of powers would simply 
cease to exist. 
Over the 244-year history of our coun-
try, no President has been removed 
from office. The first Presidential im-
peachment occurred in 1868. The next 
was more than 100 years later. Now, 50 
percent of Presidents have been im-
peached in the last 25 years alone. A 
tool so rarely used in the past is now 
being used more frequently. It is a dan-
gerous development, and the Senate 
stands as the safeguard as passions 
grow even more heated. 
These defective articles and the de-
fective process leading to them allow 
the House to muddy things and claim 
we are setting a destructive precedent 
for the future. 
Of course, bad cases make bad law. 
The House’s decision to short-circuit 
the investigation—moving faster than 
any Presidential impeachment ever, 
and a wholly partisan one at that—cer-
tainly makes for a bad case. 
So, again, let me be clear about what 
this precedent does not do. At the out-
set, this case does not set the prece-
dent that a President can do anything 
as long as he believes it to be in his 
electoral interest. I also reject the 
claim 
that 
impeachment 
requires 
criminal conduct. Rather, this shows, 
first, that House committees cannot 
simply assume the impeachment power 
to compel evidence without express au-
thority from the full body and cor-
responding political accountability. 
Second, the House should work in 
good faith with the Executive through 
the accommodation process. If that 
process reaches an impasse, the House 
should seek the assistance of the judi-
cial branch before turning to impeach-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S901 
February 5, 2020 
Finally, when Articles of Impeach-
ment come to the Senate along par-
tisan lines, when nearly half of the peo-
ple appear unmoved and maintain ada-
mant support for the President and 
when the country is just months away 
from 
an 
election, 
in 
these 
cir-
cumstances, 
the 
American 
people 
would likely not accept removing the 
President, and the Senate can wisely 
decline to usurp the people’s power to 
elect their own President. 
It has been said in this trial that the 
American people cannot make that de-
cision for themselves. I couldn’t dis-
agree more. I believe in the American 
people. I believe in the power of our 
people to evaluate the President, to 
make their decision in November, and 
to move forward in our enduring effort 
to form a more perfect union. I do not 
believe a Senate nullification of two 
elections over defective Impeachment 
Articles is in the Nation’s best inter-
est. 
So let’s move forward with the peo-
ple’s business and bring this Nation 
back together. Let’s rise up together, 
not fight each other. Not all of us 
voted for President Trump. Not all of 
us voted for the last President or the 
one before him. Yet we should work to 
make our Nation successful regardless 
of partisan passions. Passion, posi-
tively placed, will provide our Nation 
with the prosperity it has always been 
blessed with. Partisan poison will 
prove devastating to our Nation’s long- 
term prosperity. 
We must not allow our fractures to 
destroy our national fabric or partisan-
ship to destroy our friendships. If we 
come together, we will succeed to-
gether, for surely we are bound to-
gether in this, the great United States 
of America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I entered 
the Senate in the wake of Watergate in 
1975, a time when the American peo-
ple’s faith in our institutions was pro-
foundly shaken. The very first vote I 
cast was in favor of creating the Select 
Committee to Study Government Oper-
ations with Respect to Intelligence Ac-
tivities and the Rights of Americans— 
that 
is, 
the 
Church 
Committee. 
Through that Committee’s work, the 
American public soon learned of years 
of abuses that had occurred at the 
hands of the executive branch’s intel-
ligence agencies. In response, the Sen-
ate passed sweeping reforms to rein in 
this overreach. In many ways, this rep-
resented the best of the Senate: we 
came together across party lines to 
thoroughly investigate, and ultimately 
curb, gross executive branch abuses. 
The Senate has never been perfect. 
And much has changed in the 45 years 
I have served in this body. Yet today 
we face a similar test: whether the 
Senate, in the face of egregious mis-
conduct directed by the President him-
self, will rise again to serve as the 
check on executive abuses our Found-
ers intended us to be. 
But 
today, 
and 
throughout 
this 
‘‘trial,’’ we are failing this test and 
witnessing the very worst of the mod-
ern Senate. After being confronted 
with overwhelming evidence of a bra-
zen abuse of executive power, and an 
equally brazen attempt to keep that 
scheme hidden from Congress and the 
American people, the Senate is poised 
to look the other way. To simply move 
on. To pretend the Senate has no re-
sponsibility to reveal the President’s 
misconduct and, God forbid, hold him 
to account. 
Indeed we are being told the Senate 
has no constitutional role to play, and 
only the American people should judge 
the President’s misconduct in the next 
election. This is despite the Senate’s 
constitutionally-mandated 
role, 
and 
despite the fact that the President’s 
scheme was aimed at cheating in that 
very election. And now the Senate is 
cementing a cover-up of the President’s 
misconduct, to keep its extent hidden 
from the American people. How, then, 
will the American people be equipped 
to judge the President’s actions? How 
far the Senate has fallen. 
In some ways, President Nixon’s mis-
conduct—directing a break-in of the 
Democratic National Committee head-
quarters to benefit himself politi-
cally—seems quaint compared to what 
we face today. As charged in Article I, 
President Trump secretly directed a 
sweeping, illegal scheme to withhold 
$400 million in military aid from an 
ally at war in order to extort that ally 
into announcing investigations of his 
political opponent to boost his re-elec-
tion. Then, instead of hiding select in-
criminating 
records, 
as 
President 
Nixon did, President Trump attempted 
to hide every single record from the 
American people. As reflected in Arti-
cle II, President Trump has the distinc-
tion of being the only president in our 
nation’s history to direct all executive 
branch officials not to cooperate with a 
congressional investigation. 
I want to be clear: I did not relish the 
prospect of an impeachment trial. I 
have stark disagreements with this 
President on issues of policy and the 
law, on morality and honesty. But it is 
for the American people to judge a 
president on those matters. Today is 
not about differences over policy. It is 
about the integrity of our elections, 
and it is about the Constitution. 
The Constitution cannot not protect 
itself. During this trial, the words of 
Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Ham-
ilton, and Lincoln have frequently been 
invoked on behalf of our Constitution. 
Now it is our turn to record our names 
in defense of our democracy. 
In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Ham-
ilton described impeachment as the 
remedy for ‘‘the abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ Although that defi-
nition has guided the nation for 230 
years, 
President 
Trump’s 
counsels 
would have us rely on a very different 
definition. 
The central arguments presented by 
the President’s defense team were 
stunning. The President argues that we 
cannot convict him because abuse of 
power is not impeachable. He can abuse 
his power to benefit his re-election, and 
engage in improper quid pro quos, so 
long he believes his re-election is in 
the national interest. King Louis XIV 
of France—who famously declared ‘‘I 
am the State’’—might approve of that 
reasoning, but the Senate should con-
demn it. The President and his attor-
neys even argue that a president may 
welcome and even request foreign gov-
ernments to ‘‘dig up dirt’’ on their op-
ponents with impunity. Yet not only 
are such requests illegal, they violate 
the very premise of our democracy— 
that American elections are decided 
only by Americans. 
The Senate should flatly reject the 
President’s brazen and dangerous argu-
ments. But an acquittal today will do 
the opposite. If you believe that the 
President’s outlandish arguments are 
irrelevant after today, and will have no 
lasting impact on our democracy, re-
member this: The President’s counsel’s 
claim that abuse of power is not im-
peachable is largely—and mistakenly— 
based on the argument of another 
counsel, Justice Benjamin Curtis, de-
fending another president from im-
peachment, President Johnson. That 
was 150 years ago. 
What we do today will set a weighty 
precedent. An acquittal today—despite 
the overwhelming evidence of guilt, 
and following a sham of a trial—may 
fundamentally, 
and 
perhaps 
irrep-
arably, distort our system of checks 
and balances for another 150 years. 
And what a sham trial it was. The 
fact that this body would not call a 
uniquely critical witness who has de-
clared his willingness to testify, John 
Bolton, is beyond outrageous. And 
why? To punish the House for not tak-
ing years to first litigate a subpoena 
and then litigate every line of testi-
mony? Or is it because testimony de-
tailing this corrupt scheme, no matter 
how damning, would not alter the Ma-
jority Leader’s pre-ordained acquittal? 
The Senate had a constitutional obli-
gation to try this impeachment impar-
tially. Yet the Senate willfully blinded 
itself to evidence that will soon be re-
vealed. Senate Republicans even de-
feated a motion merely to consider and 
debate whether to seek critical docu-
ments and key witnesses. The notion 
that the Senate could retain the title 
of the ‘‘world’s greatest deliberative 
body’’ following this charade rings hol-
low. 
It is often said that history is watch-
ing. I expect that’s true. But in this 
moment we are not merely witnesses 
to history—we are writing it. It is ours 
to shape. And let me briefly describe 
the dark chapters we are inscribing in 
the story of our republic today. 
In his farewell address, George Wash-
ington warned us that ‘‘foreign influ-
ence is one of the most baneful foes of 
republican government.’’ Yet, as a can-
didate, President Trump famously re-
quested that Russia hack his political

opponent’s emails. Hours later, Russia 
did. The President then weaponized 
Russia’s criminal influence campaign, 
which resulted in an investigation that 
uncovered a morass of inappropriate 
contacts with Russians, lies to cover 
them up, multiple instances of the 
President’s obstruction of justice, and 
37 other indictments and convictions. 
Yet, after the saga concluded, the 
President felt liberated. Literally the 
day 
after 
Special 
Counsel 
Robert 
Mueller testified, the President asked 
the Ukrainian president ‘‘for a favor.’’ 
He has since publicly repeated his re-
quest for Ukraine to intervene in our 
election, and made the same request to 
China, on national television. 
All of us must ask: If we acquit 
President Trump today, what will he 
do tomorrow? None of us knows. But 
two things I am confident of: President 
Trump’s willingness to abuse his office, 
and his eagerness to exploit foreign in-
terference in our elections, will only 
grow. And, crucially, Congress’s capac-
ity to do anything about it will be crip-
pled. 
While the President’s lawyers stood 
on the Senate floor and admonished 
the House Managers for failing to liti-
gate each subpoena in court to exhaus-
tion, he had other lawyers in court 
making the mutually exclusive argu-
ment that Article III courts have no ju-
risdiction to settle disputes between 
our two branches. Such duplicity would 
put the two-faced Roman God Janus to 
shame. Meanwhile, the President’s De-
partment of Justice claims not only 
that President Trump cannot be in-
dicted while in office, he cannot even 
be investigated. 
But don’t worry, the President’s law-
yers promise us, the President is still 
not above the law because Congress can 
hold him in check through our con-
firmation power and power of the 
purse. Neither would come close to 
checking a lawless executive. It is well 
known that the President has effec-
tively stopped nominating senior offi-
cials in his administration. He has now 
set a modern record for acting cabinet 
secretaries. The President has said 
that he prefers having acting officials, 
who bypass Senate scrutiny, because 
they are easier to control. 
More crucially, with this vote today, 
we inflict grave damage on our power 
of the purse. I am the Vice Chairman of 
Appropriations, a Committee on which 
I have served for 40 years. Members of 
this Committee not only write the 
spending bills, they are the guardians 
of this body’s power of the purse, 
granted exclusively to Congress by the 
Founders to counter ‘‘all the over-
grown 
prerogatives 
of 
the 
other 
branches.’’ The Framers, having bro-
ken free from the grip of a monarchy, 
feared an unchecked executive who 
would use public dollars like a king: as 
a personal slush fund. Yet this is pre-
cisely what President Trump has done. 
If we fail to hold President Trump ac-
countable for illegally freezing con-
gressionally appropriated military aid 
to extract a personal favor, what would 
stop him from freezing disaster aid to 
states hit by hurricanes and flooding 
until governors or home state senators 
agree to endorse him? What would stop 
any future president from holding any 
part of the $4.7 trillion budget hostage 
to their personal whims? The answer is 
nothing. We will have relinquished the 
very check that the Founders en-
trusted to us to ensure a president 
could never behave like a king. 
The President’s defense team also ar-
gued that impeachment is inappro-
priate unless it is fully bipartisan. Dec-
ades ago, I questioned whether an im-
peachment would be accepted if not bi-
partisan. But this argument has re-
vealed itself to be painfully flawed. In 
1974, Republicans ultimately convinced 
President Nixon to resign; in 1999, 
Democrats condemned President Clin-
ton’s private misconduct and supported 
a formal censure. In contrast, with one 
important 
exception, 
President 
Trump’s 
supporters 
have 
thus 
far 
shown no limits in their tolerance of 
overwhelming misconduct; they even 
chased out of their party a Congress-
man who stood up to the President. In-
deed, a prerequisite for membership in 
the Republican Party today appears to 
be the belief that he can do no wrong. 
Under this standard, claiming that 
President Trump’s impeachment would 
only be valid if it were supported by his 
most unflinching enablers renders the 
impeachment clause null and void. 
That said, I do understand the im-
mense pressure my Republican friends 
are under to support this President. I 
know well how much easier it is for me 
to express my disgust and disappoint-
ment that the President has proven 
himself so unfit for his office. That is 
one reason why I feel it is important to 
make a commitment right now. If any 
president, Republican or Democrat, 
uses the power of his or her office to 
extort a foreign nation to interfere in 
our elections to do the president’s do-
mestic political bidding, I will support 
their impeachment and removal. It is 
wrong, no matter the party. And we all 
should say so. 
Before I close, I want to thank the 
brave individuals who shared their tes-
timony with both the House of Rep-
resentatives 
and 
American 
people. 
Each of these witnesses served this 
President in his administration. And 
they have served their country. They 
witnessed misconduct originating in 
the highest office in world, and they 
spoke up. They did not hide behind the 
President’s baseless order not to co-
operate. Most knew that by stepping 
forward they would be attacked by the 
President and some of his vindictive 
defenders. Yet they came forward any-
way. We owe them our enduring appre-
ciation. They give me hope for tomor-
row. 
Yet today is a dark day for our de-
mocracy. And what frightens me most 
is this: We are currently on a dan-
gerous road, and no one has any idea 
where this road will take us. Not one of 
us here knows. But we all know our de-
mocracy has been indelibly altered. 
The notion that the President has 
learned his lesson is farcical. The 
President’s lead counsel opened and 
closed this trial by claiming the Presi-
dent did nothing wrong. The President 
himself describes his actions as ‘‘per-
fect.’’ On 75 separate occasions, includ-
ing yesterday, he’s claimed he’s done 
nothing wrong. Lord help us if the Sen-
ate agrees. The only lesson the Presi-
dent has learned from this trial is how 
easily he can get away with egregious, 
illegal misconduct. 
If the Senate does not recognize the 
gravity of President Trump’s ‘‘viola-
tion of the public trust,’’ and hold him 
accountable, we will have seen but a 
preview of what is to come. Foreign in-
terference in our elections. Total non-
compliance with lawful congressional 
oversight. Disregard of our constitu-
tional power of the purse. Open, fla-
grant corruption. I fear there is no bot-
tom. 
This is the tragic result of the Senate 
failing its constitutional duty to hold a 
real trial. We will leave President 
Trump ‘‘sacred and inviolable’’ and 
with ‘‘no constitutional tribunal to 
which he is amenable; no punishment 
to which he can be subjected without 
involving the crisis of a national revo-
lution.’’ As Hamilton warned over two 
centuries ago, that is not a president; 
that is a king. I, for one, will not mere-
ly ‘‘get over it.’’ 
I have listened very carefully to both 
sides over the past two weeks. The 
record has established, leaving no 
doubt in my view, that President 
Trump directed the most impeachable, 
corrupt scheme by any president in 
this country’s history. To protect our 
constitutional republic, and to safe-
guard our government’s system of 
checks and balances, my oath to our 
Constitution compels me to hold the 
President of the United States ac-
countable. 
I will vote to convict and remove 
President Donald J. Trump from office. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, over the 
past 2 weeks, my colleagues and I have 
patiently listened to arguments from 
both the House managers and the 
President’s counsel right here in the 
Senate regarding a grave allegation 
from the House that the President has 
committed an act worthy of impeach-
ment. 
As a Senator, I believe that the first 
and perhaps most important consider-
ation is whether abuse of power and ob-
struction of Congress are impeachable 
offenses as asserted by our House man-
agers. 
Impeachment is a necessary and es-
sential component of our Constitution. 
It serves as an important check on 
civil 
officers 
who 
commit 
crimes 
against the United States. However, 
our Founding Fathers were wise to en-
sure that the impeachment and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S903 
February 5, 2020 
conviction of a sitting President would 
not be of partisan intent. Since Presi-
dent Trump took office, many have 
sought to delegitimize his Presidency 
with partisan attacks. We have heard 
this right here in the Senate, and we 
have experienced it. This extreme ef-
fort to unseat the President, I believe, 
is unjustified and intolerable. 
Now that the Senate has heard and 
studied the arguments from both sides, 
I believe the lack of merit in the House 
managers’ case is evident. The outcome 
of the impeachment trial is a foregone 
conclusion. Acquittal is the judgment 
the Senate should and, I believe, will 
render—and soon. 
For my part, I have weighed the 
House managers’ case and found it 
wanting in fundamental aspects. I will 
try to explain. 
I believe that their case does not al-
lege an impeachable offense. Even if 
the facts are as they have stated, the 
managers have failed, I believe, as a 
matter of constitutional law, to meet 
the exceedingly high bar for removal of 
the President as established by our 
Founding Fathers, the Framers of the 
Constitution. 
In their wisdom, the Framers re-
jected vague grounds for impeach-
ment—offenses like we have heard 
here, 
‘‘maladministration’’—for 
fear 
that it would, in the words of Madison, 
result in a Presidential ‘‘tenure during 
[the] pleasure of the Senate.’’ 
‘‘Abuse of power,’’ one of the charges 
put forward here by the House man-
agers, is a concept as vague and suscep-
tible to abuse, I believe, as ‘‘maladmin-
istration.’’ If you take just a minute or 
two to look at the definitions of 
‘‘abuse’’ and ‘‘mal,’’ they draw distinct 
similarities. ‘‘Mal,’’ a prefix of Latin 
origin, 
means 
bad, 
evil, 
wrong. 
‘‘Abuse,’’ also of Latin origin, means to 
wrongly use or to use for a bad effect. 
There is a kinship between ‘‘mal’’ and 
‘‘abuse.’’ 
As the Framers rejected in their wis-
dom ‘‘maladministration,’’ I believe 
that they, too, would reject the non-
criminal ‘‘abuse of power.’’ Instead, the 
Framers, 
as 
the 
Presiding 
Officer 
knows, provided for impeachment only 
in a few limited cases: treason, bribery, 
and high crimes and misdemeanors. 
Only those offenses justify taking the 
dire step of removing a duly elected 
President from office and permanently 
taking his name off the ballot. 
This institution, the U.S. Senate, I 
believe, should not lower the constitu-
tional bar and authorize their theory of 
impeachment for abuse of power. It is 
simply not an impeachable offense, in 
my judgment. Their criteria for re-
moval centers not on the President’s 
actions but on their loose perception of 
his motivations. If the Senate endorses 
this approach, we will dramatically 
transform the impeachment power as 
we have known it over the years. We 
will forever turn this grave constitu-
tional power into a tool for adjudi-
cating policy disputes and political dis-
agreements among all of us. The Fram-
ers, in their wisdom, cautioned us 
against this dangerous path, and I be-
lieve the Senate will heed their warn-
ing. 
The other article, the House man-
agers’ obstruction of Congress claim, is 
similarly flawed. Congress’s investiga-
tive and oversight powers are critical 
tools, and we use them in ensuring our 
system of checks and balances. But 
those powers are not absolute. 
The President, too, as head of a co-
equal branch of government, enjoys 
certain privileges and immunities from 
congressional factfinding. That is his 
constitutional right and has been the 
right of former Presidents from both 
parties. The President’s mere assertion 
of privileges and immunities is not an 
impeachable offense. Endorsing other-
wise would be unprecedented and would 
ignore the past practices of administra-
tions of both parties. Adopting other-
wise would drastically undermine the 
separation of powers enshrined in our 
Constitution. 
This was not what our Framers in-
tended. Nowhere in the Constitution or 
in the Federal statute is abuse of power 
or obstruction of Congress listed as a 
crime—nowhere. What constitutes an 
impeachable offense is not left to the 
discretion of the Congress. We cannot 
expand, I believe, on the scope of ac-
tions that could be deemed impeach-
able beyond that which the Framers in-
tended. 
What we really have here, I believe, 
is nothing more than the abuse of the 
power of impeachment itself by the 
Democratic House. Doesn’t our country 
deserve better? The President certainly 
deserves better. 
Today I am proud to stand and repu-
diate those very weak impeachment ef-
forts, and I will accordingly vote to ac-
quit the President on both articles. 
My hope is that, in the future, Con-
gress will reject this episode and, in-
stead, choose to be guided by the Con-
stitution and the words from our 
Framers. 
Basically, I believe it is a time to 
move on. We know that the American 
economy 
is 
booming. 
The 
United 
States is projecting strength and pro-
moting peace abroad. The President is 
unbowed. I believe the American people 
see all of this. At the end of the day, 
the ultimate judgment rests in their 
hands. In my judgment, that is just as 
it should be. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Ben-
jamin Franklin knew the strength of 
our Constitution, but he also knew its 
vulnerability. His words, oft repeated 
on this floor—‘‘a republic, if you can 
keep it’’—were a stark warning. Frank-
lin believed every generation could 
face the challenge of protecting and de-
fending our Nation’s liberty-affirming 
document. 
We know this personally. Before we 
can legally serve as Senators, we must 
publicly swear an oath to support and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States. A trial of impeachment, more 
than any other Senate assignment, 
tests the oath each one of us takes be-
fore the people of this Nation. 
The President’s legal team warns us 
of the danger of impeachment and con-
viction. They tell us to think carefully 
about what the removal of a duly elect-
ed President could mean for our de-
mocracy. But if we should have our 
eyes wide open to the danger of convic-
tion, we also cannot ignore the danger 
of acquittal. The facts of this impeach-
ment are well known, and many Repub-
licans concede that they are likely 
true. They believe as I do, that Presi-
dent Trump pressured the Ukrainian 
President by withholding vital mili-
tary aid and a prized White House visit 
in return for the announcement of an 
investigation of the Bidens and the 
Russian-concocted 
CrowdStrike 
fan-
tasy. 
Some of these same Republicans ac-
knowledge that what the President did 
was ‘‘inappropriate.’’ At least one has 
used the word ‘‘impeachable.’’ But 
many say they are still going to vote 
to acquit him regardless. So let’s open 
our eyes to the morning after a judg-
ment of acquittal. Facing a well-estab-
lished election siege by Russia and 
other enemies of the United States, we, 
the Senate, will have absolved a Presi-
dent who continues to brazenly invite 
foreign interference in our elections. 
Expect more of the same. 
A majority of this body will have 
voted for the President’s argument 
that inviting interference by a foreign 
government is not impeachable if it 
serves the President’s personal polit-
ical interests. 
We will also have found for the first 
time in the history of this Nation that 
an impeachment proceeding in the Sen-
ate can be conducted without any di-
rect witnesses or evidence presented on 
either side of the case and that a Presi-
dent facing impeachment can ignore 
subpoenas to produce documents or 
witnesses to Congress. 
Alexander Hamilton described the 
Senate as the very best venue for an 
impeachment trial because it is ‘‘inde-
pendent and dignified,’’ in his words. 
When the Senate voted 51 to 49 against 
witnesses and evidence, those 51 raised 
into question any claim to independ-
ence or dignity. 
In addition, an acquittal will leave 
the extreme views stated by the Presi-
dent’s defense counsel Alan Dershowitz 
unchallenged: first, that abuse of power 
is not an impeachable offense; second, 
that the impeachment charges against 
the President were constitutionally in-
sufficient; and, third, his most dan-
gerous theory, that unless the Presi-
dent has committed an actual crime, 
his conduct cannot be corrupt or im-
peachable as long as he believes it was 
necessary for his reelection. 
By this logic, Professor Dershowitz 
would have excused Richard Nixon’s or-
dering of IRS audits of his political en-
emies. Mr. Dershowitz has created an

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S904 
February 5, 2020 
escape clause to impeachment, which 
is breathtaking in its impact and un-
founded in our legal history. We have 
all received a letter signed by nearly 
300 constitutional law scholars flatly 
rejecting the arguments offered by the 
President’s defense team. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the scholars’ let-
ter. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JANUARY 31, 2020. 
TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE: The sig-
natories of this letter are professors of law 
and scholars of the American constitution 
who write to clarify that impeachment does 
not require proof of crime, that abuse of 
power is an impeachable offense, and that a 
president may not abuse the powers of his of-
fice to secure re-election, whatever he may 
believe about how beneficial his continuance 
in power is to the country. 
IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT DOES NOT REQUIRE 
PROOF OF ANY CRIME 
Impeachment for ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ under Article II of the U.S. Con-
stitution does not require proof that a presi-
dent violated any criminal law. The phrase 
‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ is a term 
of art consciously adopted by the drafters of 
the American constitution from Great Brit-
ain. Beginning in 1386, the term was fre-
quently used by Parliament to describe the 
wide variety of conduct, much of it non- 
criminal abuses of official power, for which 
British officials were impeached. 
The 
phrase 
‘‘high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors’’ was introduced into the Amer-
ican constitution by George Mason, who ex-
plained the necessity for expanding impeach-
ment beyond ‘‘treason and bribery’’ by draw-
ing his colleagues’ attention to the ongoing 
parliamentary impeachment trial of Warren 
Hastings. Hastings was charged with a long 
list of abuses of power that his articles of 
impeachment labeled ‘‘high crimes and mis-
demeanors,’’ but which even his chief pros-
ecutor, Edmund Burke, admitted were not 
prosecutable crimes. On George Mason’s mo-
tion, the Philadelphia convention wrote into 
our constitution the same phrase Parliament 
used to describe Hastings’ non-criminal mis-
conduct. 
No convention delegate ever suggested 
that impeachment be limited to violations of 
criminal law. Multiple founders emphasized 
the need for impeachment to extend to plain-
ly 
non-criminal 
conduct. 
For 
example, 
James Madison and George Nicholas said 
that abuses of the pardon power should be 
impeachable. Edmund Randolph believed 
that violation of the foreign emoluments 
clause would be. 
Thus, Alexander Hamilton’s famous obser-
vation in Federalist 65 that impeachable of-
fenses ‘‘are of a nature which may with pecu-
liar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, 
as they relate chiefly to injuries done imme-
diately to the society itself’’ was not merely 
an advocate’s rhetorical flourish, but a well- 
informed description of the shared under-
standing of those who wrote and ratified the 
Constitution. 
Since ratification, one senator and mul-
tiple judges have been impeached for non- 
criminal behavior. The first federal official 
impeached, convicted, and removed for ‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors’’ was Judge John 
Pickering, whose offenses were making bad 
legal rulings, being drunk on the bench, and 
taking the name of the Supreme Being in 
vain. 
Among presidents, the tenth and eleventh 
articles of impeachment against President 
Andrew Johnson charged non-criminal mis-
conduct. The first and second articles of im-
peachment against President Richard Nixon 
approved by the House Judiciary Committee 
allege both criminal and non-criminal con-
duct, and the third alleges non-criminal ob-
struction of Congress. Indeed, the Nixon 
House Judiciary Committee issued a report 
in which it specifically rejected the conten-
tion that impeachable conduct must be 
criminal. 
The consensus of scholarly opinion is that 
impeachable conduct does not require proof 
of crime. 
ABUSE OF POWER IS AN IMPEACHABLE HIGH 
CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR 
It has been suggested that abuse of power 
is not an impeachable high crime and mis-
demeanor. The reverse is true. The British 
Parliament invented impeachment as a leg-
islative counterweight to abuses of power by 
the Crown and its ministers. The American 
Framers inserted impeachment into our con-
stitution primarily out of concern about 
presidential abuse of power. They inserted 
the phrase ‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors’’ 
into the definition of impeachable conduct in 
order to cover non-criminal abuses of power 
of the type charged against Warren Hastings. 
As Edmund Randolph observed at the Con-
stitutional Convention, ‘‘the propriety of im-
peachments was a favorite principle with 
him’’ because ‘‘[t]he Executive will have 
great opportunities of abusing his power.’’ In 
Federalist 65, Hamilton defined ‘‘high crimes 
and misdemeanors’’ as ‘‘those offenses which 
proceed from the misconduct of public men, 
or, in other words, from the abuse or viola-
tion of some public trust.’’ 
This understanding has often been ex-
pressed in the ensuing centuries. For exam-
ple, in 1926, the House voted to impeach U.S. 
District Judge George English. The Judici-
ary Committee report on the matter re-
viewed the authorities and concluded: 
Thus, an official may be impeached for of-
fenses of a political character and for gross 
betrayal of public interests. Also, for abuses 
or betrayals of trusts, for inexcusable neg-
ligence of duty [or] for the tyrannical abuse 
of power. 
Two of the three prior presidential im-
peachment crises have involved charges of 
abuse of power. The eleventh article of im-
peachment against President Andrew John-
son alleged that he abused his power by at-
tempting to prevent implementation of re-
construction legislation passed by Congress 
in March 1867, and thus violated Article II, 
Section 3, of the constitution by failing to 
‘‘take care that the laws be faithfully exe-
cuted.’’ The second article of impeachment 
against Richard Nixon charged a litany of 
abuses 
of 
presidential 
power, 
including 
‘‘interfering with agencies of the Executive 
Branch.’’ 
Even if no precedent existed, the constitu-
tional logic of impeachment for abuse of 
presidential power is plain. The president is 
granted wide powers under the constitution. 
The framers recognized that a great many 
misuses of those powers might violate no 
law, but nonetheless pose immense danger to 
the constitutional order. They consciously 
rejected the idea that periodic elections were 
a sufficient protection against this danger 
and inserted impeachment as a remedy. 
The consensus of scholarly opinion is that 
abuse of power is an impeachable ‘‘high 
crime and misdemeanor.’’ 
A PRESIDENT MAY NOT ABUSE HIS POWERS OF 
OFFICE TO SECURE HIS OWN RE-ELECTION 
Finally, one of President Trump’s attor-
neys has suggested that so long as a presi-
dent believes his re-election is in the public 
interest, ‘‘if a president did something that 
he believes will help get him elected, in the 
public interest, that cannot be the kind of 
quid pro quo that results in his impeach-
ment.’’ It is true that merely because a 
president makes a policy choice he believes 
will have beneficial political effects, that 
choice is not necessarily impeachable. How-
ever, if a President employs his powers in a 
way that cannot reasonably be explained ex-
cept as a means of promoting his own reelec-
tion, the president’s private conviction that 
his maintenance of power is for the greater 
good does not insulate him from impeach-
ment. To accept such a view would be to give 
the president carte blanche to corrupt Amer-
ican electoral democracy. 
Distinguishing between minor misuses of 
presidential authority and grave abuses re-
quiring impeachment and removal is not an 
exact science. That is why the Constitution 
assigns the task, not to a court, but to Con-
gress, relying upon its collective wisdom to 
assess whether a president has committed a 
‘‘high crime and misdemeanor’’ requiring his 
conviction and removal.

Mr. DURBIN. Yet a verdict of acquit-
tal by the Senate blesses the profes-
sor’s torturous reasoning. An acquittal 
verdict 
would 
also 
give 
President 
Trump’s 
personal 
attorney 
Rudy 
Giuliani a pat on the back to continue 
his global escapades, harassing Amer-
ican Ambassadors whose service he dis-
trusts, and lounging at European cigar 
bars with an entourage of post-Soviet 
amigos. 
More than anything, a verdict of ac-
quittal says a majority of the Senate 
believes this President is above the law 
and cannot be held accountable for 
conduct abusing the powers of his of-
fice. And make no mistake, this Presi-
dent believes that is true. 
On July 23—2 days before his phone 
call with President Zelensky—Presi-
dent Trump spoke to a group of young 
supporters and he said: ‘‘I have an Arti-
cle II, where I have the right to do 
whatever I want as president.’’ 
This is the dangerous principle that 
President Trump and his lawyers are 
asking us, with a verdict of acquittal, 
to accept. Under the oath I have sworn, 
I cannot. 
What does it say of this Congress and 
our Nation that in 3 years, we have be-
come so anesthetized to outrage that, 
for a majority in this Senate, there is 
nothing—nothing—this President can 
do or say that rises to the level of 
blushworthy, let alone impeachable? 
Nearly 6 years ago, I traveled to 
Ukraine with a bipartisan group of 
Senate colleagues led by John McCain. 
It was one of John’s whirlwind visits 
where we crammed 5 days’ worth of 
meetings into 48 hours. We arrived in 
Kyiv on March 14, 2014. It was bitterly 
cold. Ukrainians had just ousted a cor-
rupt, Russian-backed leader who looted 
the national treasury and hollowed out 
their nation’s military. They had done 
so by taking to the streets, risking 
their lives for democracy and a better 
future. More than 100 ordinary citizens 
in Kyiv had been killed by security 
forces of the old government simply be-
cause they were protesting for democ-
racy. 
Seeing Ukraine in a fragile demo-
cratic 
transition, 
Vladimir 
Putin 
pounced on them, ordered an invasion 
and occupied Crimea. Putin and his 
thinly disguised Russian thugs were on 
the verge of seizing Donetsk in the 
east. 
I asked the Prime Minister what 
Ukraine needed to defend itself. He 
said: 
Everything. We don’t have anything that 
floats, flies or runs. 
Many may not appreciate how dev-
astating Russia’s war on Ukraine has 
been to that struggling young democ-
racy. Their costly battle with Russia 
was for a principle that is really basic 
to America’s national security as well. 
In a country with one-eighth of our 
population, 
more 
Ukrainian 
troops 
have died defending Ukraine from Rus-
sia than American troops have perished 
in Afghanistan. 
During the months President Trump 
illegally withheld military aid, as 
many as two dozen Ukrainian soldiers 
were killed in battle. By withholding 
security aid from Ukraine for Presi-
dent Trump’s personal political ben-
efit, he endangered the security of a 
fragile democracy. 
Can there be any deeper betrayal of a 
President’s responsibility than to en-
danger our national security and the 
security of an ally for his own personal 
political gain? 
And to those of my colleagues who 
describe the President’s conduct as 
merely ‘‘inappropriate,’’ I disagree. 
Disparaging John McCain’s service to 
our country is disgusting and inappro-
priate. What this President has done to 
Ukraine crosses that line. It is im-
peachable. 
I will close by remembering two pub-
lic servants who, like us, were called 
by history to judge a President. Tom 
Railsback passed away as this im-
peachment proceeding began. He was 2 
days shy of his 88th birthday. I knew 
Tom. I considered him a friend. 
In 1974, Tom was a Republican Con-
gressman from Moline, IL, and a mem-
ber of the House Judiciary Committee. 
He regarded President Nixon as a polit-
ical friend. He believed that Richard 
Nixon had achieved much for America, 
including the opening of the door to 
China. 
After studying the Watergate evi-
dence closely, Congressman Railsback 
came to believe that Richard Nixon 
had violated the Constitution. When 
President Nixon refused to turn over 
records and recordings requested by 
Congress, Tom Railsback took to the 
House floor to say: ‘‘If the Congress 
doesn’t get the material we think we 
need and then votes to exonerate, we’ll 
be regarded as a paper tiger.’’ 
When he voted to impeach President 
Nixon, Tom believed it was probably 
the end of his career, but he was elect-
ed four more times. To his dying day, 
Tom Railsback was proud of his vote. 
He voted for his country above his 
party. 
Bill Cohen—also a Republican—was a 
freshman Congressman at the time and 
a member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. He studied the evidence with 
Tom Railsback and then worked with 
him to draft Articles of Impeachment. 
Bill Cohen received death threats, 
and he thought his votes to impeach 
President Nixon would be the end of his 
political career. But he went on to a 
distinguished career in the House, 
three terms in the Senate, and served 
as Secretary of Defense. 
Listen to what Bill Cohen said re-
cently of President’s Trump’s actions: 
This is presidential conduct that you want 
to be ashamed of. He is corrupting institu-
tions, politicizing the military, and acts like 
he is THE law. 
And then Cohen added: 
If [the President’s conduct] is acceptable, 
we really don’t have a Republic as we’ve 
known it any more. 
May I respectfully say to my Senate 
colleagues, Ben Franklin warned us of 
this day. 
I will vote guilty on both Articles of 
Impeachment against President Donald 
John Trump, on article I abuse of 
power and article II obstruction of Con-
gress. But at this moment of high con-
stitutional drama, I hope my last 
words can be a personal appeal to my 
Senate colleagues. 
Last night, many of us attended a 
State of the Union Address which was 
as emotionally charged as any I have

ever attended. As divided as our Nation 
may be and as divided as the Senate 
may be, we should remember America 
has weathered greater storms than this 
impeachment and our current political 
standoff. 
It was Abraham Lincoln, in the dark-
ness of our worst storm, who called on 
us ‘‘to strive on to finish the work we 
are in, to work to bind the nation’s 
wounds.’’ 
After this vote and after this day, 
those of us who are entrusted with this 
high office must each do our part to 
work to bind the wounds of our divided 
nation. I hope we can leave this Cham-
ber with that common resolve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, let me 
just begin with a note of optimism. 
You are going to get to pick the next 
President, not a bunch of politicians 
driven by sour grapes. I don’t say that 
lightly. I didn’t vote for President 
Trump. 
I 
voted 
for 
somebody 
I 
wouldn’t know if they walked in the 
door. But I accepted the fact that he 
won. That has been hard for a lot of 
people to do. And it is not like I am 
above the President being investigated. 
I supported the Mueller investiga-
tion. I had Democratic colleagues come 
to me and say: We are afraid he is 
going to fire Mueller. Will you stand 
with us to make sure Mueller can com-
plete his investigation? And I did—2 
years, $32 million, FBI agents, sub-
poenas, you name it. The verdict is in. 
What did we find? Nothing. I thought 
that would be it. 
But it is never enough when it comes 
to President Trump. This sham process 
is the low point in the Senate for me. 
If you think you have done the country 
a good service by legitimizing this im-
peachment process, what you have 
done is unleashed the partisan forces of 
Hell. This is sour grapes. 
They impeached the President of the 
United States in 78 days. You cannot 
get a parking ticket, if you contested 
it, in 78 days. They gave out souvenir 
pens when it was over. 
If you can’t see through that, your 
hatred of Donald Trump has blinded 
you to the obvious. This is not about 
protecting the country; this is about 
destroying the President. 
There are no rules when it comes to 
Donald Trump. Everybody in America 
can confront the witnesses against 
them, except Donald Trump. Every-
body in America can call witnesses on 
their behalf, except President Trump. 
Everybody in America can introduce 
evidence, except for President Trump. 
He is not above the law, but you put 
him below the law. In the process of 
impeaching this President, you have 
made it almost impossible for future 
Presidents to do their job. 
In 78 days, you took due process, as 
we have come to know it in America, 
and threw it in the garbage can. This is 
the first impeachment in the history of 
the country driven by politicians. 
The Nixon impeachment had outside 
counsel, Watergate prosecutors. The 
Clinton impeachment had Ken Starr, 
who looked at President Clinton for 
years before he brought it to Congress. 
The Mueller investigation went on for 2 
years. I trusted Bob Mueller. And when 
he rendered his verdict, it broke your 
heart. And you can’t let it go. 
The only way this is going to end 
permanently is for the President to get 
reelected. And he will. 
So as to abuse of Congress, it is a 
wholesale assault on the Presidency; it 
is abandoning every sense of fairness 
that every American has come to ex-
pect in their own lives; it is driven by 
blind partisanship and hatred of the 
man himself. And they wanted to do it 
in 78 days. Why? Because they wanted 
to impeach him before the election. I 
am not making this up. They said that. 
The reason the President never was 
allowed to go to court and challenge 
the subpoenas that were never issued is 
because the House managers under-
stood it might take time. President 
Clinton and President Nixon were al-
lowed to go to article III court and con-
test the House’s action. That was de-
nied this President because it would 
get in the way of impeaching him be-
fore the election. 
And you send this crap over here, and 
you are OK with it, my Democratic col-
leagues. You are OK with the idea that 
the President was denied his day in 
court, and you were going to rule on 
executive privilege as a political body. 
You are willing to deal out the article 
III court because you hate Trump that 
much. 
What you have done is you have 
weakened the institution of the Presi-
dency. Be careful what you wish for be-
cause it is going to come back your 
way. 
Abuse of Congress should be entitled 
‘‘abuse of power by the Congress.’’ If 
you think ADAM SCHIFF is trying to get 
to the truth, I have a bridge I want to 
sell you. These people hate Trump’s 
guts. They rammed it through the 
House in a way you couldn’t get a 
parking ticket, and they achieved their 
goal of impeaching him before the elec-
tion. 
The Senate is going to achieve its 
goal of acquitting him in February. 
The American people are going to get 
to decide in November whom they want 
to be their President. 
Acquittal will happen in about 2 
hours; exoneration comes when Presi-
dent Trump gets reelected because the 
people of the United States are fed up 
with this crap. But the damage you 
have done will be long-lasting. 
Abuse of power. You are impeaching 
the President of the United States for 
suspending foreign aid for a short pe-
riod of time that they eventually re-
ceived ahead of schedule to leverage an 
investigation that never happened. You 
are going to remove the President of 
the United States for suspending for-
eign aid to leverage an investigation of 
a political opponent that never oc-
curred. The Ukrainians did not know of 
the suspension until September. They 
didn’t feel any pressure. If you are OK 
with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden doing 
what they did, it says more about you 
than it does anything else. The point of 
the abuse of power article is that you 
made it almost impossible now for any 
President to pick up the phone, if all of 
us can assume the worst and impeach 
somebody 
based 
on 
this 
objective 
standard. He was talking about corrup-
tion in the Ukraine with a past Presi-
dent. 
And the Bidens’ conduct in the 
Ukraine undercut our ability to effec-
tively deal with corruption by allowing 
his son to receive $3 million from the 
most corrupt gas company in the 
Ukraine. Can you imagine how the 
Ukrainian Parliamentarian must have 
felt to be lectured by Joe Biden about 
ending sweetheart deals? 
What you have done is impeached the 
President of the United States and 
willing to remove him because he sus-
pended foreign aid for 40 days to lever-
age an investigation that never oc-
curred. 
And to my good friend DICK DURBIN, 
Donald Trump has done more to help 
the Ukrainian people than Barack 
Obama did in his entire 8 years. If you 
are looking for somebody to help the 
Ukrainian people fight the Russians, 
how about giving them some weapons? 
This is a sham. This is a farce. This 
is disgusting. This is an affront to 
President Trump as a person. It is a 
threat to the office. It will end soon. 
There is going to be an overwhelming 
rejection of both articles. We are going 
to pick up the pieces and try to go for-
ward. 
But I can say this without any hesi-
tation: I worry about the future of the 
Presidency after what has happened 
here. Ladies and gentlemen, you will 
come to regret this whole process. 
And to those who have those pens, I 
hope you will understand history will 
judge those pens as a souvenir of 
shame. 
Mr. President, this is my second 
Presidential impeachment. My first 
was as a House manager for the im-
peachment of President Clinton. I be-
lieve President Clinton corruptly inter-
fered in a lawsuit filed against him by 
a private citizen alleging sexual as-
sault and misconduct. It was clear to 
me that President Clinton tampered 
with the evidence, suborned perjury, 
and tried to deny Paula Jones her day 
in court. I believed then and continue 
to believe now that these criminal acts 
against a private citizen by President 
Clinton were wholly unacceptable and 
should have cost him his job. However, 
at the end of the Clinton impeachment, 
I accepted the conclusions of the Sen-
ate and said that a cloud had been re-
moved from the Presidency, and it was 
time to move on. 
During the Clinton impeachment, I 
voted against one Article of Impeach-
ment that related to lying under oath 
regarding his sexual relationship with

Monica Lewinsky. While the conduct 
covered by that article was inappro-
priate, to have made such conduct im-
peachable would have done grave dam-
age to the Presidency by failing to rec-
ognize that, in the future, the office 
will be occupied by flawed human 
beings. It was obvious to me that 
President Clinton’s lying under oath 
about his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky, while wrong, was not a high 
crime or misdemeanor and that many 
people in similar circumstances would 
be inclined to lie to protect themselves 
and their families. 
As to the impeachment of President 
Trump, I feel compelled to condemn 
the impeachment process used in the 
House because I believe it was devoid of 
basic, fundamental due process. The 
process used in the House for this im-
peachment was unlike that used for 
Presidents Nixon or Clinton. This im-
peachment was completed within 78 
days and had a spirit of partisanship 
and revenge that if accepted by the 
Senate will lead to the weaponization 
of impeachment against future presi-
dents. 
President Trump was entirely shut 
out of the evidence gathering stage in 
the House Intelligence Committee, de-
nied the right to counsel, and the right 
to cross-examine and call witnesses. 
Moreover, the great volume of evidence 
gathered against President Trump by 
the House Intelligence Committee con-
sists of inadmissible hearsay. The 
House Judiciary Committee impeach-
ment hearings were, for lack of a bet-
ter term, a sham. And most impor-
tantly, the House managers admitted 
the reason that neither the House In-
telligence Committee nor the House 
Judiciary Committee sought testimony 
in the House from President Trump’s 
closest advisers, including former Na-
tional Security Adviser John Bolton, 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and 
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, 
is because it would have required the 
House to go to court, impeding their 
desire to impeach the President before 
the election. It was a calculated deci-
sion to deal article III courts out of 
President Trump’s impeachment in-
quiry due to a political timetable. The 
Senate must send a clear message that 
this can never, ever happen again. 
As to the substance of the allegations 
against President Trump, the abuse of 
power charge as defined by the House is 
vague, does not allege criminal mis-
conduct, and requires the Senate to en-
gage in a subjective analysis of the 
President’s motives and actions. The 
House managers argued to the Senate 
that the sole and exclusive purpose of 
freezing aid to Ukraine was for the pri-
vate, political benefit of President 
Trump. It is clear to me that there is 
ample evidence—much more than a 
mere scintilla—that the actions of 
Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden 
were inappropriate and undercut Amer-
ican foreign policy. 
Moreover, there was evidence in the 
record that officials in Ukraine were 
actively speaking against Candidate 
Trump and were pulling for former Sec-
retary of State Clinton. Based on the 
overwhelming amount of evidence of 
inappropriate behavior by the Bidens 
and statements by State Department 
officials about certain Ukrainians’ be-
liefs that one American candidate 
would be better than the other, I found 
it eminently reasonable for the Presi-
dent to be concerned about Ukraine 
corruption, election interference, and 
the behavior of Vice President Biden 
and his son Hunter. It is hard to be-
lieve that Vice President Biden was an 
effective messenger for reform efforts 
in Ukraine while his son Hunter was 
receiving $3 million from Burisma, one 
of Ukraine’s most corrupt companies. 
As Professor Dershowitz described, 
there are three buckets for examining 
allegations of corrupt motive or action 
with regards to impeachment. The first 
is where there is clearly only a public, 
national benefit, as in the analogy of 
freezing aid to Israel unless it stops 
building new settlements. The second 
is the mixed motive category in which 
there is a public benefit—in this case, 
the public benefit of exposing the 
Bidens’ conduct in the Ukrainian en-
ergy sector—and the possibility of a 
personal, political benefit as well. The 
third is where there is clearly a pure 
corrupt motive, as when there is a pe-
cuniary or financial benefit, an allega-
tion that has not been made against 
President Trump. 
It is obvious to me that, after the 
Mueller 
report, 
President 
Trump 
viewed the House impeachment inquiry 
as a gross double standard when it 
comes to investigations. The House 
launched an investigation into his 
phone call with President Zelensky 
while at the same time the House 
showed no interest in the actions of 
Vice 
President 
Biden 
and 
Hunter 
Biden. The President, in my view, was 
justified in asking the Ukrainians to 
look 
into 
the 
circumstances 
sur-
rounding the firing of Ukrainian Pros-
ecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was 
investigating Burisma, and whether his 
termination benefited Hunter Biden 
and Burisma. 
It is clear to me that the phone call 
focused on burden-sharing, corruption, 
and election interference in an appro-
priate manner. The most vexing ques-
tion was how the President was sup-
posed to deal with these legitimate 
concerns. The House managers in one 
moment suggest that President Trump 
could not have asked the Attorney 
General to investigate these concerns 
because that would be equivalent to 
President Trump asking for an inves-
tigation of a political rival. But in the 
next moment, the House managers de-
clare that the proper way for President 
Trump to have dealt with those allega-
tions would have been to ask the At-
torney General to investigate. They 
cannot have it both ways. I believe 
that it is fair to criticize President 
Trump’s overreliance on his private at-
torney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate 
alleged corruption and conflicts of in-
terest 
regarding 
the 
Bidens 
and 
Burisma. However, I do not find this 
remotely an impeachable offense, and 
it would be beneficial for the country 
as a whole to find ways to deal with 
such matters in the future. 
Assuming the facts in the light most 
favorable to the House managers, that 
for a period of time the aid was sus-
pended by President Trump to get 
Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and 
election interference, I find both arti-
cles fail as nonimpeachable offenses. I 
find this to be the case even if we as-
sume the New York Times article 
about Mr. Bolton is accurate. The 
Ukrainians received the military aid 
and did not open the requested inves-
tigation. 
The abuse of power Article of Im-
peachment is beyond vague and re-
quires a subjective analysis that no 
Senator should have to engage in. It 
also represents an existential threat to 
the Presidency. Moreover, the obstruc-
tion of Congress article is literally im-
peaching the President because he 
chose to follow the advice of White 
House counsel and the Department of 
Justice and he was willing to use con-
stitutional privileges in a manner con-
sistent with every other President. 
This article must be soundly rejected, 
not only in this case, but in the future. 
Whether one likes President Trump or 
not, he is the President with privileges 
attached to his office. 
The House of Representatives, I be-
lieve, abused their authority by rush-
ing this impeachment and putting the 
Senate in the position of having to 
play the role of an article III court. 
The long term effect of this practice 
would be to neuter the Presidency, 
making the office of the President only 
as strong as the House will allow. 
The allegations contained in this im-
peachment are not what the Framers 
had in mind as high crimes or mis-
demeanors. The Framers, in my view, 
envisioned serious, criminal-like mis-
conduct that would shake the founda-
tion of the American constitutional 
system. The Nixon impeachment had 
broad bipartisan support once the facts 
became known. The Clinton impeach-
ment started with bipartisan support 
in the House and ended with bipartisan 
support in the Senate, even though it 
fell well short of the two-thirds vote 
requirement to remove the President. 
In the case of President Trump, this 
impeachment started as a partisan af-
fair with bipartisan rejection of the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment in the House 
and, if not rejected in the Senate, will 
lead to impeachment as almost an in-
evitability, as future Presidents will be 
subject to the partisan whims of the 
House in any given moment. 
My decision to vote not guilty on 
both Articles of Impeachment, I hope, 
will be seen as a rejection of what the 
House did and how they did it. I firmly 
believe that article III courts have a 
role in the impeachment process and 
that, to remove a President from of-
fice, the conduct has to be of a nature

that would shake the very foundation 
of our constitutional system. The im-
peachment of President Trump was 
driven by a level of partisanship and 
ends justify the means behavior that 
the American people have rejected. The 
best way to end this matter is to allow 
the American people to vote for or 
against President Trump in November, 
not to remove him from the ballot. 
These Articles of Impeachment must 
be soundly rejected by the Senate be-
cause they represent an assault on the 
Presidency 
itself 
and 
the 
weaponization of impeachment as a po-
litical tool. They must fail for a vari-
ety of reasons. First, the conduct being 
alleged by House managers is that 
there was a temporary suspension on 
military assistance to Ukraine, which 
was 
eventually 
received 
ahead 
of 
schedule to leverage an investigation 
that never occurred. This is not the 
constitutional earthquake the Found-
ers had in mind regarding bribery, 
treason, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Second, the articles as 
drafted do not allege any semblance of 
a crime and require the Senate to 
make a subjective analysis of the 
President’s motives. Third, the record 
is abundant with evidence that the 
President 
had 
legitimate 
concerns 
about corruption, election interference 
emanating from the Ukraine, and that 
Vice President Biden and his son un-
dercut U.S. efforts to reform corrup-
tion inside Ukraine. 
The second article, alleging obstruc-
tion of Congress, is literally punishing 
the President for exercising the legal 
rights available to all Presidents as 
part of our constitutional structure. 
This article must fail because the 
House chose their impeachment path 
based on a political timetable of im-
peaching the President before Christ-
mas to set up an election year trial in 
the Senate. The Senate must reject the 
theory offered by the House managers 
with regard to obstruction of Congress; 
to do otherwise would allow the House 
in the future to deal article III courts 
out of the impeachment process and 
give the House complete control over 
the impeachment field in a way that 
denies fundamental fairness. 
Because it took the House 78 days 
from start to finish to impeach the 
President of the United States and, 
during its fact-gathering process, the 
House denied the President the right to 
counsel, to cross-examine witnesses 
against him, and the ability to intro-
duce evidence on his behalf, the Senate 
must reject both Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
I am compelled to vote not guilty, to 
ensure impeachment will not become 
the new normal. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Articles of Impeachment before us 
charged President Donald John Trump 
with offenses against the Constitution 
and the American people. 
The first Article of Impeachment 
charges that President Trump abused 
the Office of the Presidency by solic-
iting the interference of a foreign 
power, Ukraine, to benefit himself in 
the 2020 election. The President asked 
a foreign leader to ‘‘do us a favor’’— 
‘‘us’’ meaning him—and investigate his 
political opponents. 
In order to elicit these political in-
vestigations, President Trump with-
held a White House meeting and hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in military 
assistance from an ally at war with 
Russia. There is extensive documenta-
tion in the record proving this quid pro 
quo and the corrupt motive behind it. 
The facts are not seriously in dispute. 
In fact, several Republican Senators 
admitted they believe the President 
committed this offense with varying 
degrees of ‘‘inappropriate,’’ ‘‘wrong,’’ 
‘‘shameful.’’ Almost all Republicans 
will argue, however, that this rep-
rehensible conduct does not rise to the 
level of an impeachable offense. 
The Founders could not have been 
clearer. William Davie, a delegate to 
the Constitutional Convention, deemed 
impeachment ‘‘an essential security,’’ 
lest the President ‘‘spare no efforts or 
means whatever to get himself re-
elected.’’ 
James Madison offered a specific list 
of impeachable offenses during a de-
bate in Independence Hall: 
A President ‘‘might lose his capac-
ity’’ or embezzle public funds. 
‘‘A despicable soul might even suc-
cumb to bribes while in office.’’ 
Madison then arrived at what he be-
lieved was the worst conduct a Presi-
dent could engage in: the President 
could ‘‘betray his trust to foreign pow-
ers,’’ which would be ‘‘fatal to the Re-
public.’’ Those are Madison’s words. 
When I studied the Constitution and 
the Federalist Papers in high school, 
admittedly, I was skeptical of George 
Washington’s warning that ‘‘foreign in-
fluence is one of the most baneful foes 
of republican government.’’ It seemed 
so far-fetched. Who would dare? But 
the foresight and wisdom of the Found-
ers endure. Madison was right. Wash-
ington was right. 
There is no greater subversion of our 
democracy than for powers outside of 
our borders to determine elections 
within them. If Americans believe that 
they don’t determine their Senator, 
their Governor, their President, but, 
rather, some foreign potentate does, 
that is the beginning of the end of de-
mocracy. 
For a foreign country to attempt 
such a thing on its own is contempt-
ible. For an American President to de-
liberately solicit such a thing—to 
blackmail a foreign country into help-
ing him win an election—is unforgiv-
able. 
Does this rise to the level of an im-
peachable offense? Of course it does. Of 
course it does. The term ‘‘high crimes’’ 
derives from English law. ‘‘Crimes’’ 
were committed between subjects of 
the monarchy. ‘‘High crimes’’ were 
committed against the Crown itself. 
The Framers did not design a mon-
archy; they designed a democracy, a 
nation where the people were King. 
High 
crimes 
are 
those 
committed 
against the entire people of the United 
States. 
The President sought to cheat the 
people out of a free and fair election. 
How could such an offense not be 
deemed a high crime—a crime against 
the 
people? 
As 
one 
constitutional 
scholar in the House Judiciary hear-
ings testified: ‘‘If this is not impeach-
able, nothing is.’’ I agree. 
I judge that President Trump is 
guilty of the first Article of Impeach-
ment. 
The second Article of Impeachment 
is equally straightforward. Once the 
President realized he got caught, he 
tried to cover it up. The President as-
serted blanket immunity. He categori-
cally defied congressional subpoenas, 
ordered his aides not to testify, and 
withheld the production of relevant 
documents. 
Even President Nixon, author of the 
most infamous Presidential coverup in 
history, permitted his aides to testify 
in Congress in the Watergate investiga-
tion. The idea that the Trump adminis-
tration was properly invoking the var-
ious rights and privileges of the Presi-
dency is nonsense. At each stage of the 
House inquiry, the administration con-
jured up a different bad-faith justifica-
tion for evading accountability. There 
is no circumstance under which the ad-
ministration would have complied. 
When I asked the President’s counsel 
twice to name one document or one 
witness the President provided to Con-
gress, they could not answer. It cannot 
be that the President, by dint of legal 
shamelessness, can escape scrutiny en-
tirely. 
Once again, the facts are not in dis-
pute, but some have sought to portray 
the second Article of Impeachment as 
somehow less important than the first. 
It is not. The second Article of Im-
peachment is necessary if Congress is 
to ever hold a President accountable— 
again, Democratic or Republican. The 
consequences of sanctioning such cat-
egorical obstruction of Congress will be 
far-reaching, and they will be irrep-
arable. 
I judge that President Trump is 
guilty of the second Article of Im-
peachment. 
The Senate should convict President 
Trump, remove him from the Presi-
dency, and disqualify him from holding 
future office. The guilt of the President 
on these charges is so obvious that 
here, again, several Republican Sen-
ators admit that the House has proved 
its case. 
So instead of maintaining the Presi-
dent’s innocence, the President’s coun-
sel ultimately told the Senate that 
even if the President did what he was 
accused of, it is not impeachable. This 
has taken the form of an escalating se-
ries of Dershowitzian arguments, in-
cluding ‘‘Abuse of power is not an im-
peachable offense’’; ‘‘The President

can’t be impeached for noncriminal 
conduct, but he also can’t be indicted 
for criminal conduct’’; ‘‘If a President 
believes his own reelection is essential 
to the Nation, then a quid pro quo is 
not corrupt.’’ These are the excuses of 
a child caught in a lie. 
Each explanation is more outlandish 
and desperate than the last. It would 
be laughable if not for the fact that the 
cumulative effect of these arguments 
would render not just this President 
but all Presidents immune from im-
peachment and therefore above the 
law. 
Several Members of this Chamber 
said that even if the President is guilty 
and even if it is impeachable, the Sen-
ate still shouldn’t convict the Presi-
dent because there is an election com-
ing up—as if the Framers forgot about 
elections when they wrote the im-
peachment clause. If the Founders be-
lieved that even when a President is 
guilty of an impeachable offense, the 
next election should decide his fate, 
they never would have included an im-
peachment clause in the Constitution. 
That much is obvious. 
Alone, each of the defenses advanced 
by the President’s counsel comes close 
to being preposterous. Together, they 
are as dangerous to the Republic as 
this President—a fig leaf so large as to 
excuse any Presidential misconduct. 
Unable to defend the President, argu-
ments were found to make him a King. 
Let future generations know that 
only a fraction of the Senate swallowed 
these fantasies. The rest of us condemn 
them to the ash heap of history and the 
derision of first-year law students ev-
erywhere. 
We are only the third Senate in his-
tory to sit as a Court of Impeachment 
for the President. The task we were 
given was not easy, but the Framers 
gave the Senate this responsibility be-
cause they could not imagine any other 
body capable of it. They considered 
others, but they entrusted it to us, and 
the Senate failed. The Republican cau-
cus trained its outrage not on the con-
duct of the President but on the im-
peachment process in the House, derid-
ing—falsely—an alleged lack of fair-
ness and thoroughness. 
The conjured outrage was so blinding 
that the Republican majority ended up 
guilty of the very sins it falsely ac-
cused the House of committing. It con-
ducted the least fair, least thorough, 
most rushed impeachment trial in the 
history of this country. 
A simple majority of Senators denied 
the Senate’s right to examine relevant 
evidence, to call witnesses, to review 
documents, and to properly try the im-
peachment of the President, making 
this the first impeachment trial in his-
tory that heard from no witnesses. A 
simple majority of Senators, in def-
erence to and most likely in fear of the 
President of their party, perpetrated a 
great miscarriage of justice in the trial 
of President Trump. As a result, the 
verdict of this kangaroo court will be 
meaningless. 
By refusing the facts, by refusing 
witnesses and documents, the Repub-
lican majority has placed a giant aster-
isk—the asterisk of a sham trial—next 
to the acquittal of President Trump, 
written in permanent ink. Acquittal 
and an unfair trial with this giant as-
terisk—the asterisk of a sham trial— 
are worth nothing at all to President 
Trump or to anybody else. 
No doubt, the President will boast he 
received total exoneration, but we 
know better. We know this wasn’t a 
trial by any stretch of the definition. 
And the American people know it, too. 
We have heard a lot about the Fram-
ers over the past several weeks, about 
the impeachment clause they forged, 
the separation of powers they wrought, 
the conduct they most feared in our 
chief magistrate. But there is some-
thing the Founders considered even 
more fundamental to our Republic: 
truth. The Founders had seen and stud-
ied societies governed by the iron fist 
of tyrants and the divine right of 
Kings, but none by argument, rational 
thinking, facts, and debate. 
Hamilton said the American people 
would determine ‘‘whether societies of 
men are really capable or not of estab-
lishing good government from reflec-
tion and choice, or . . . forever des-
tined to depend on accident and force.’’ 
And what an astonishing thing the 
Founders did. They placed a bet with 
long odds. They believed that ‘‘reflec-
tion and choice’’ would make us capa-
ble 
of 
self-government; 
that 
we 
wouldn’t agree on everything, but at 
least we could agree on a common 
baseline of fact and of truth. They 
wrote a Constitution with the remark-
able idea that even the most powerful 
person in our country was not above 
the law and could be put on trial. A 
trial—a place where you seek truth. 
The faith our Founders placed in us 
makes the failure of this Senate even 
more damning. 
Our Nation was founded on the idea 
of truth, but there was no truth here. 
The Republican majority couldn’t let 
truth into this trial. The Republican 
majority refused to get the evidence 
because they were afraid of what it 
might show. 
Our Nation was founded on the idea 
of truth, but in order to countenance 
this President, you have to ignore the 
truth. The Republicans walk through 
the halls with their heads down. They 
didn’t see the tweet. They can’t re-
spond to everything he says. They hope 
he learned his lesson this time. Yes, 
maybe, this time, he learned his lesson. 
Our Nation was founded on truth, but 
in order to excuse this President, you 
have to willfully ignore the truth and 
indulge in the President’s conspiracy 
theories: Millions of people voted ille-
gally. The deep state is out to get him. 
Ukraine interfered in our elections. 
You must attempt to normalize his be-
havior. Obama did it, too, they falsely 
claim. The Democrats are just as bad. 
Our Nation was founded on the idea 
of truth, but this President is such a 
menace—so contemptuous of every vir-
tue, so dishonorable, so dishonest— 
that you must ignore—indeed, sac-
rifice—the truth to maintain his favor. 
The trial of this President—its fail-
ure—reflects the central challenge of 
this Presidency and, maybe, the cen-
tral challenge of this time in our de-
mocracy. You cannot be on the side of 
this President and be on the side of 
truth, and if we are to survive as a na-
tion, we must choose truth because, if 
the truth doesn’t matter, if the news 
you don’t like is fake, if cheating in an 
election is acceptable, if everyone is as 
wicked as the wickedest among us, 
then hope for the future is lost. 
The eyes of the Nation are upon this 
Senate, and what they see will strike 
doubt in the heart of even the most ar-
dent patriot. 
The House managers established that 
the President abused the great power 
of his office to try to cheat in an elec-
tion, and the Senate majority is poised 
to look the other way. 
So I direct my final message not to 
the House managers, not even to my 
fellow Senators, but to the American 
people. My message is simple: Don’t 
lose hope. There is justice in this world 
and truth and right. I believe that. I 
wouldn’t be in this government if I 
didn’t. Somehow, in ways we can’t pre-
dict, with God’s mysterious hand guid-
ing us, truth and right will prevail. 
There have been dark periods in our 
history, but we always overcome. The 
Senate’s opening prayer yesterday was 
Amos 5:24: Let justice roll down like 
water, righteousness like an ever-flow-
ing stream. 
The long arc of the moral universe, 
my fellow Americans, does bend toward 
justice. America does change for the 
better but not on its own. It took mil-
lions of Americans hundreds of years to 
make this country what it is today— 
Americans of every age and color and 
creed who marched and protested, who 
stood up and sat in; Americans who 
died while defending this democracy, 
this beautiful democracy, in its dark-
est hours. 
On Memorial Day in 1884, Oliver Wen-
dell Holmes told his war-weary audi-
ence: ‘‘[W]hether [one] accepts from 
Fortune her spade, and will look down-
ward and dig, or from Aspiration her 
axe and cord, and will scale the ice, the 
one and only success which it is [yours] 
to command is to bring to [your] work 
a mighty heart.’’ 
I have confidence that Americans of 
a different generation—our genera-
tion—will bring to our work a mighty 
heart to fight for what is right, to fight 
for the truth, and never, never lose 
faith. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
U.S. Senate was made for moments 
like this. The Framers predicted that 
factional fever might dominate House 
majorities from time to time. They 
knew the country would need a firewall

S910 
February 5, 2020 
to keep partisan flames from scorching 
our Republic. So they created the Sen-
ate—out of ‘‘necessity,’’ James Madi-
son wrote, ‘‘of some stable institution 
in the government.’’ 
Today, we will fulfill this founding 
purpose. We will reject this incoherent 
case that comes nowhere near—no-
where near—justifying the first Presi-
dential removal in history. This par-
tisan impeachment will end today, but 
I fear the threat to our institutions 
may not because this episode is one 
symptom of something much deeper. 
In the last 3 years, the opposition to 
this President has come to revolve 
around a truly dangerous concept. 
Leaders in the opposite party increas-
ingly argue that, if our institutions 
don’t produce the outcomes they like, 
our institutions themselves must be 
broken. One side has decided that de-
feat simply means the whole system is 
broken, that we must literally tear up 
the rules and write new ones. 
Normally, when a party loses an elec-
tion, it accepts defeat. It reflects and 
retools—but not this time. 
Within months, Secretary Clinton 
was suggesting her defeat was invalid. 
She 
called 
our 
President 
‘‘illegit-
imate.’’ A former President falsely 
claimed: ‘‘[President] Trump didn’t ac-
tually win.’’ ‘‘He lost the election,’’ a 
former President said. Members of Con-
gress have used similar rhetoric—a 
disinformation campaign, weakening 
confidence in our democracy. 
The very real issue of foreign elec-
tion interference was abused to fuel 
conspiracy theories. For years, promi-
nent voices said there had been a secret 
conspiracy between the President’s 
campaign and a foreign government, 
but when the Mueller investigation and 
the Senate Intelligence Committee de-
bunked that, the delegitimizing en-
deavor didn’t stop. It didn’t stop. 
Remember what Chairman SCHIFF 
said here on the floor? He suggested 
that if the American people reelect 
President Trump in November that the 
election will be presumptively invalid 
as well. That was Chairman SCHIFF, on 
this floor, saying, if the American peo-
ple reelect President Trump this No-
vember, the election will be presump-
tively invalid as well. 
So they still don’t accept the Amer-
ican voters’ last decision, and now they 
are preparing to reject the voters’ next 
decision if they don’t like the out-
come—not only the last decision but 
the next decision. Heads, we win. Tails, 
you cheated. And who can trust our de-
mocracy anyway, they say? 
This kind of talk creates more fear 
and division than our foreign adver-
saries could achieve in their wildest 
dreams. As Dr. Hill testified, our adver-
saries seek to ‘‘divide us against each 
other, degrade our institutions, and de-
stroy the faith of the American people 
in our democracy.’’ As she noted, if 
Americans become ‘‘consumed by par-
tisan rancor,’’ we can easily do that 
work for them. 
The architects of this impeachment 
claimed they were defending norms and 
traditions. In reality, it was an assault 
on both. 
First, the House attacked its own 
precedents on fairness and due process 
and by rushing to use the impeachment 
power as a political weapon of first re-
sort. Then their articles attacked the 
Office of the Presidency. Then they at-
tacked 
the 
Senate 
and 
called 
us 
‘‘treacherous.’’ Then the far left tried 
to impugn the Chief Justice for re-
maining neutral during the trial. 
Now, for the final act, the Speaker of 
the House is trying to steal the Sen-
ate’s sole power to render a verdict. 
The Speaker says she will just refuse 
to accept this acquittal. The Speaker 
of the House of Representatives says 
she refuses to accept this acquittal— 
whatever that means. Perhaps she will 
tear up the verdict like she tore up the 
State of the Union Address. 
So I would ask my distinguished col-
leagues across the aisle: Is this really— 
really—where you want to go? The 
President isn’t the President? An ac-
quittal isn’t an acquittal? Attack insti-
tutions until they get their way? Even 
my colleagues who may not agree with 
this President must see the insanity of 
this logic. It is like saying you are so 
worried about a bull in a china shop 
that you want to bulldoze the china 
shop to chase it out. 
Here is the most troubling part. 
There is no sign this attack on our in-
stitutions will end here. In recent 
months, Democratic Presidential can-
didates and Senate leaders have toyed 
with killing the filibuster so that the 
Senate could approve radical changes 
with less deliberation and less persua-
sion. 
Several of our colleagues sent an ex-
traordinary 
brief 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court, threatening political retribution 
if the Justices did not decide a case the 
way they wanted. 
We have seen proposals to turn the 
FEC—the regulator of elections and po-
litical speech—into a partisan body for 
the first time ever. 
All of these things signal a toxic 
temptation to stop debating policy 
within our great American governing 
traditions and, instead, declare war on 
the traditions themselves—a war on 
the traditions themselves. 
So, colleagues, with whatever policy 
differences we may have, we should all 
agree this is precisely the kind of reck-
lessness the Senate was created to 
stop. The response to losing one elec-
tion cannot be to attack the Office of 
the Presidency. The response to losing 
several elections cannot be to threaten 
the electoral college. The response to 
losing a court case cannot be to threat-
en the judiciary. The response to losing 
a vote cannot be to threaten the Sen-
ate. 
We simply cannot let factional fever 
break our institutions. It must work 
the other way, as Madison and Ham-
ilton intended. The institutions must 
break the fever rather than the other 
way around. 
The Framers built the Senate to keep 
temporary rage from doing permanent 
damage to our Republic. 
The Framers built the Senate to keep 
temporary rage from doing permanent 
damage to our Republic. That is what 
we will do when we end this precedent- 
breaking impeachment. 
I hope we will look back on this vote 
and say this was the day the fever 
began to break. 
I hope we will not say this was just 
the beginning. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as 
Senators, we cast a lot of votes 
throughout our tenure in this body. I 
have cast over 13,200 of them. Each 
vote is important. A vote to convict or 
acquit the President of the United 
States on charges of impeachment is 
one of the most important votes a Sen-
ator could ever cast. Until this week, 
such a vote has only taken place twice 
since the founding of our Republic. 
The President has been accused of 
committing ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ for requesting that a for-
eign leader launch an anti-corruption 
investigation into his potential polit-
ical 
opponent 
and 
obstructing 
Congress’s subsequent inquiry into his 
actions. For such conduct, the House of 
Representatives asks this body to re-
move the President from office and 
prohibit him from ever again serving in 
a position of public trust. As both a 
judge and juror, this Senator asks first 
whether the conduct alleged rises to 
the level of an offense that unquestion-
ably demands removal. If it does, I ask 
whether the House has proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the conduct ac-
tually 
occurred. 
The 
House’s 
case 
clearly fails on the first of those ques-
tions. Accordingly, I will vote not 
guilty on both articles. 
The President’s request, taken at 
face value, is not impeachable conduct. 
A President is not prohibited by law or 
any other restriction from engaging 
the assistance of a foreign ally in an 
anti-corruption 
investigation. 
The 
House attempts to cure this defect by 
suggesting that the President’s subjec-
tive 
motive—political 
advantage—is 
enough to turn an otherwise unim-
peachable act into one that demands 
permanent removal from office. I will 
not lend my vote in support of such an 
unnecessary 
and 
irreversible 
break 
from the Constitution’s clear standard 
for impeachment. 
The Senate is an institution of prece-
dent. We are informed and often guid-
ed, especially in times like this, by his-
tory and the actions of our prede-
cessors. While we look to history, how-
ever, we must be mindful of the reality 
that our choices make history, for bet-
ter or for worse. What we say and do 
here necessarily becomes part of the 
roadmap for future Presidential im-
peachments and their consideration by 
this body. These days, that reality can 
be difficult to keep front and center. 
Partisan fervor to convict or acquit a 
President of the United States who has 
been impeached can lead to cut cor-
ners, overheated rhetoric, and rushed

February 5, 2020 
results. We are each bound by the spe-
cial oath we take while sitting as a 
Court of Impeachment to ‘‘do impartial 
justice according to the Constitution 
and laws.’’ But as President pro tem-
pore, I recognize we must also do jus-
tice to the Senate as an institution and 
to the Republic that it serves. 
This trial began with a full and fair 
opportunity to debate and amend the 
rules that would guide our process. The 
Senate considered and voted on 11 sepa-
rate amendments to the resolution, 
over the span of nearly 13 hours. Con-
sistent with precedent, the Senate 
adopted a resolution to allow the same 
length of time for opening arguments 
and questions as was agreed to unani-
mously in 1999 during the Clinton im-
peachment 
trial. 
Consistent 
with 
precedent, the Senate agreed to table 
the issue of witnesses and additional 
evidence until after the conclusion of 
questions from Members. Consistent 
with precedent, the Senate engaged in 
a robust and open debate on the neces-
sity of calling witnesses and pursuing 
additional evidence. We heard nearly 24 
hours of presentation from the House 
managers, nearly 12 hours of presen-
tation from the President’s counsel, 
and we engaged in 16 hours of ques-
tioning to both sides. 
Up to today, the Senate has sat as a 
Court of Impeachment for a combined 
total of over 70 hours. The Senate did 
not and does not cut corners, nor can 
the final vote be credibly called a 
rushed result or anything less than the 
product of a fair and judicious process. 
Future generations, if faced with the 
toxic turmoil of impeachment, will be 
better served by the precedent we fol-
lowed and the example we set in this 
Chamber. I cannot in good conscience 
say the same of the articles before us 
today. 
I have said since the beginning of 
this 
unfortunate 
episode 
that 
the 
House’s articles don’t, on their face, 
appear to allege anything satisfying 
the Constitution’s clear requirement of 
‘‘Treason, 
Bribery, 
or 
other 
high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ Yet I took 
my role as a juror seriously. I com-
mitted to hear the evidence in the 
record and to reflect on the arguments 
made. After 9 days of presentation and 
questions and after fully considering 
the record as presented to the Senate, 
I am convinced that what the House is 
asking us to do is not only constitu-
tionally flawed but dangerously un-
precedented. 
The House’s first article, impeaching 
the President for ‘‘abuse of power,’’ 
rests on objectively legal conduct. 
Until Congress legislates otherwise, a 
President is well within his or her legal 
and constitutional authority, as the 
head of state, to request that a foreign 
leader assist with an anti-corruption 
investigation falling outside of the ju-
risdiction of our domestic law enforce-
ment authorities. Short of political 
blowback, there is also nothing in the 
law that prohibits a President from 
conditioning his or her official acts 
upon the agreement by the foreign 
leader to carry out such an investiga-
tion. 
In an attempt to cure this funda-
mental defect in its charge, the House’s 
‘‘abuse of power’’ article sets out an 
impermissibly 
flexible 
and 
vague 
standard to justify removing the Chief 
Executive from office. As the House’s 
trial 
brief 
and 
presentation 
dem-
onstrated, its theory of the case rests 
entirely on the President’s subjective 
motive for carrying out objectively 
permissible conduct. For two reasons, 
this cannot be sustained. 
First, the House would seemingly 
have the Senate believe that motive by 
itself is sufficient to prove the ille-
gality of an action. House managers re-
peatedly 
described 
the 
President’s 
‘‘corrupt motive’’ as grounds for re-
moval from office. But this flips basic 
concepts in our justice system upside 
down and represents an unprecedented 
expansion of the scope of the impeach-
ment authority. With limited excep-
tion, motive is offered in court to show 
that the defendant on trial is the one 
who most likely committed the illegal 
act that has been charged. Jealously 
might compel one neighbor to steal 
something from the other. But a court 
doesn’t convict the defendant for a 
crime of jealousy. Second, let’s as-
sume, however, that motive could be 
grounds for impeachment and removal. 
The House offers no limiting principle 
or clear standard whatsoever of what 
motives are permissible. Under such an 
amorphous standard, future Houses 
would be empowered to impeach Presi-
dents for taking lawful action for what 
the House considers to be the wrong 
reasons. 
The House also gives no aid to this 
institution or to our successors on 
whether impeachment should rest on 
proving a single, ‘‘corrupt’’ motive or 
whether mixed motive suffices under 
their theory for removing a President 
from office. In its trial brief presented 
to the Senate, the House asserts that 
there is ‘‘no credible alternative expla-
nation’’ for the President’s alleged con-
duct. This formulation, in the House’s 
own brief, necessarily implies that the 
presence of a credible alternative ex-
planation for the President’s conduct 
would defeat the ‘‘abuse of power’’ the-
ory. But once the Senate heard the 
President’s counsel’s presentation, the 
House changed its tune. Even a cred-
ible alternative explanation—or mul-
tiple benign motives—shouldn’t stop 
this body from removing the President, 
so long as one ‘‘corrupt’’ motive is in 
the mix. This apparent shift in trial 
strategy seems less indicative of a co-
hesive theory and more reflective of an 
‘‘impeach-by-any-means-necessary’’ 
mindset. 
But 
reshaping 
their 
own 
standard mid-trial only served to un-
dercut their initial arguments. 
Simply asserting at least 63 times, as 
the House managers did, during the 
trial that their evidence was ‘‘over-
whelming’’ and that the President’s 
guilt was proven does not make the un-
derlying allegations accurate or prove 
an impeachable offense. Even in the 
midst of questions and answers, after 
opening arguments had concluded, the 
House managers started repeating the 
terms ‘‘bribery’’ and ‘‘extortion’’ on 
the floor of the Senate, while neither 
appears anywhere in the House’s arti-
cles. 
These 
are 
serious, 
statutory 
crimes that have specific elements of 
proof; they shouldn’t be casually used 
as window dressing to inflame the jury. 
And the House’s attempts to shoehorn 
those charges into their articles is 
itself a due process violation. 
It is not the Senate’s job to read into 
the House’s articles what the House 
failed or didn’t see fit to incorporate 
itself. No more so is it the job of a 
judge to read nonexistent provisions 
into legislation that Congress passes 
and the President signs. Articles of Im-
peachment should not be moving tar-
gets. 
The 
Senate, 
accordingly, 
doesn’t 
need to resolve today the question of 
whether a criminal violation is nec-
essary for a President’s conduct to be 
impeachable. The text of the Constitu-
tion and the Framers’ clear intent to 
limit the scope of the impeachment 
power counsels in favor of such a 
brightline rule. And until this episode, 
no President has been impeached on 
charges that didn’t include a violation 
of established law. Indeed, the only 
Presidential impeachments considered 
by this body included alleged viola-
tions of laws, and both resulted in ac-
quittals. But the stated ambiguities 
surrounding the House’s ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ theory, acknowledged even by 
the House managers, give this Senator 
reason enough to vote not guilty. If we 
are to lower the bar of impeachment, 
we better be clear on where the bar is 
being set. 
The 
President 
himself, 
however, 
should not conclude from my vote that 
I think his conduct was above re-
proach. He alone knows what his mo-
tives were. The President has a duty to 
the American people to root out cor-
ruption no matter who is implicated. 
And running for office does not make 
one immune from scrutiny. But the 
President’s request was poorly timed 
and poorly executed, and he should 
have taken better care to avoid even 
the mere appearance of impropriety. 
Had he done so, this impeachment saga 
might have been avoided altogether. It 
is clear that many of the President’s 
opponents had plans to impeach him 
from the day he took office. But the 
President didn’t have to give them this 
pretense. 
The House’s second article, impeach-
ing the President for ‘‘obstruction of 
Congress,’’ is equally unprecedented as 
grounds for removal from office and 
patently frivolous. It purports that, if 
the President claims constitutional 
privileges against Congress, ‘‘threat-
ens’’ to litigate, or otherwise fails to 
immediately give up the goods, he or 
she must be removed from office.

tion by the executive branch under

both Democrat and Republican admin-
istrations. Congressional oversight— 
rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse—is 
central to my role as a Senator rep-
resenting Iowa taxpayers and has been 
for 40 years. If there is anything as sure 
as death and taxes, it is Federal agen-
cies resisting Congress’ efforts to look 
behind the curtain. In the face of ob-
struction, I don’t retreat. I go to work. 
I use the tools the Constitution pro-
vides to this institution. I withhold 
consent on nominees until I get an 
honest answer to an oversight request. 
I work with my colleagues to exercise 
Congress’s power of the purse. And 
when necessary, I take the administra-
tion to court. That is the very core of 
checks and balances. For years, I 
fought the Obama administration to 
obtain documents related to Operation 
Fast and Furious. I spent years seeking 
answers and records from the Obama 
administration during my investiga-
tion into Secretary Clinton’s mis-
handling of highly classified informa-
tion. 
Under the House’s ‘‘obstruction of 
Congress’’ standard, should President 
Obama have been impeached for his 
failure to waive privileges during the 
course of my and other committees’ 
oversight investigations? We fought 
President Obama on this for 3 years in 
the courts, and we still didn’t end up 
with all we asked for. We never heard a 
peep from the Democrats then. So the 
hypocrisy here by the House Demo-
crats is on full display. 
When I face unprecedented obstruc-
tion, I don’t agitate to impeach. Rath-
er, my office aggressively negotiates, 
in good faith, with the executive 
branch. We discuss the scope of ques-
tions and document requests. We dis-
cuss the intent of the inquiry to pro-
vide context for the requested docu-
ments. We build an airtight case and 
demand cooperation. Negotiations are 
difficult. They take time. 
In the case before us, the House 
issued a series of requests and sub-
poenas to individuals within the White 
House and throughout the administra-
tion. But it did so rather early in its 
inquiry. The House learned of the whis-
tleblower 
complaint 
in 
September, 
issued subpoenas for records in Octo-
ber, and impeached the President by 
December, 4 months from opening the 
inquiry to impeachment for ‘‘obstruc-
tion.’’ As one who can speak from expe-
rience, 
that 
is 
unreasonable 
and 
doesn’t allow an investigation to ap-
propriately and reasonably run its 
course. That timeline makes clear to 
me that the House majority really had 
one goal in mind: to impeach the Presi-
dent at all costs, no matter what the 
facts and the law might say. Most im-
portantly, the House failed to exhaust 
all legal remedies to enforce its re-
quests and subpoenas. When challenged 
to stand up for the legality of its re-
quests in court, the investigating com-
mittee simply retreated. Yet, now, the 
House accuses the Senate of aiding and 
abetting a coverup, if we don’t finish 
their job for them. The evidence is 
‘‘overwhelming,’’ yet the Senate must 
entertain more witnesses and gather 
more records that the House chose to 
forgo. 
The House’s failure to proceed with 
their investigation in an orderly, rea-
sonable, good-faith manner has created 
fundamental flaws in its own case. 
They skipped basic steps. It is not the 
job of the Senate to fix the funda-
mental flaws that directly result from 
the House’s failure to do its job. The 
House may cower to defend its own au-
thority, but it will not extort and de-
mean this body into cleaning up a mess 
of the House’s own making. 
For the myriad ways in which the 
House failed to exercise the fundamen-
tals of oversight, for the terrible new 
precedent the House wants us to en-
dorse, and for the risk of future genera-
tions taking it up as the standard, I 
will vote not guilty on the obstruction 
article. 
Now, there has been much discussion 
and debate about the whistleblower 
whose complaint framed the House’s 
inquiry in this case. I have worked for 
and with whistleblowers for more than 
30 years. They shed light on waste, 
fraud, and abuse that ought to be fixed 
and that the public ought to know 
about, all frequently at great personal 
cost. Whistleblowers are patriots, and 
they are heroes. I believed that in the 
1980s. I believe it today. I have spon-
sored, 
cosponsored, 
and 
otherwise 
strongly supported numerous laws de-
signed to strengthen whistleblowers 
protections. I have reminded agencies 
of the whistleblowers’ rights to speak 
with us and of their protection under 
the law for doing so. And this is how it 
works. Of course, it is much better to 
have firsthand information because it 
is more reliable. However, whether it is 
firsthand information or secondhand, it 
is possible to conduct a thorough inves-
tigation of a whistleblower’s claims 
and respect his or her request for con-
fidentiality. 
As I said in October of last year, at-
tempts by anyone in government or the 
media to ‘‘out’’ a whistleblower just to 
sell an article or score a political point 
is not helpful. It undermines the spirit 
and purpose of the whistleblower pro-
tection laws. I remember very well the 
rabid, public lashing experienced by 
the brave whistleblowers who came to 
me about the Obama administration’s 
Operation Fast and Furious. President 
Obama’s Justice Department worked 
overtime to discredit them and tarnish 
their good names in the press, all to 
protect an operation that it tried to 
keep hidden from Congress and the 
American people, and that resulted in 
the death of an American Border Pa-
trol agent. That was not the treatment 
those whistleblowers deserved. It is not 
the treatment any whistleblower de-
serves, who comes forward in good 
faith, to report what he or she truly be-
lieves is waste, fraud, or abuse. 
But whistleblower claims require 
careful evaluation and follow up, par-
ticularly because their initial claim 
frames your inquiry and forms the 
basis for further fact finding. The ques-
tions you ask and the documents and 
witnesses you seek all start there. Any 
investigator worth their salt will tell 
you that part of the investigative proc-
ess involving a whistleblower, or in-
deed any witness, requires the investi-
gator to evaluate that individual’s 
claim and credibility. It is standard 
procedure. So we talk to the whistle-
blowers, we meet with them when pos-
sible, we look at their documents. We 
keep them confidential from potential 
retaliators, but not from the folks who 
need to speak with them to do their 
jobs. When whistleblowers bring to us 
significant cases of bipartisan interest, 
where we have initially evaluated their 
claim and credibility and determined 
that the claim merits additional follow 
up, we also frequently work closely 
with the other side to look into those 
claims. 
We have done many bipartisan inves-
tigations 
of 
whistleblowers’ 
claims 
over the years and hopefully will con-
tinue to do so. We trust the other side 
to respect the whistleblower’s con-
fidence as well and treat the investiga-
tion seriously. We have also worked 
with many witnesses in investigations 
who want to maintain low profiles and 
who request additional security meas-
ures to come and speak with us. We are 
flexible on location. We have the Cap-
itol Police. We have SCIFs. We have 
interviewed witnesses in both classified 
and unclassified settings. We are will-
ing to work with those witnesses to 
make them comfortable and to ensure 
they are in a setting that allows them 
to share sensitive information with us. 
I know the House committees, par-
ticularly the oversight committees, 
have all taken that course themselves. 
They routinely work with whistle-
blowers too. Both sides understand how 
to talk to whistleblowers and how to 
respect their role and confidentiality. 
So why no efforts were taken in this 
case to go through these very basic, bi-
partisan steps is baffling. I do not 
under any circumstances support re-
prisal or efforts to throw stones with-
out facts. But neither do I support ef-
forts to skirt basic fundamental inves-
tigative procedures to try and learn 
those facts. I fear that, to achieve its 
desired ends, the House weaponized and 
politicized whistleblowers and whistle-
blower reporting for purely partisan 
purposes. I hope that the damage done 
from all sides to these decades-long ef-
forts will be short lived. 
Finally, throughout my time on the 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
including 
as 
chairman, I have made it a priority to 
hold judicial nominees to a standard of 
restraint and fidelity to the law. As 
judges in the Court of Impeachment, 
we too should be mindful of those fac-
tors which counsel restraint in this 
matter. 
To start, these articles came to the 
Senate as the product of a flawed, un-
precedented and partisan process. For

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S913 
February 5, 2020 
71 of the 78 days of the House’s expe-
dited impeachment inquiry, the Presi-
dent was not permitted to take part or 
have agency counsel present. Many of 
the rights traditionally afforded to the 
minority party in impeachment pro-
ceedings were altered or withheld. And 
an authorizing vote by the full House 
didn’t occur until 4 weeks after hear-
ings had already begun. When the arti-
cles themselves were put to a vote by 
the full House, just in time for Christ-
mas, the only bipartisanship we saw 
was in opposition. Moreover, the Iowa 
caucuses have already occurred. The 
2020 Presidential election is well under-
way. Yet we are being asked to remove 
the incumbent from the ballot, based 
on Articles of Impeachment supported 
by only one party in Congress. Taken 
together, the Senate should take no 
part in endorsing the dangerous new 
precedent this would set for future im-
peachments. 
With more than 28,000 pages of evi-
dence, 17 witnesses, and over 70 hours 
of open, transparent consideration by 
the Senate, I believe the American peo-
ple are more than adequately prepared 
to decide for themselves the fate of this 
President in November. This decision 
belongs to them. 
When the Chief Justice spoke up at 
the start of this trial to defuse some 
rising emotions, he challenged both 
sides addressing the Chamber to ‘‘re-
member where they are.’’ We, too, 
should remember where we are. The 
U.S. Senate has ably served the Amer-
ican people through trying times. 
These are trying times. And when this 
trial adjourns, the cloud of impeach-
ment may not so quickly depart. But if 
there is any institution best equipped 
to help bridge the divide and once 
again achieve our common goals, it is 
this one. 
Let’s get back to work for the Peo-
ple. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the ques-
tion before us is incredibly serious, but 
it is also more than a little absurd. We 
are sitting as a court, exercising the 
sole power to try impeachments, en-
trusted to us by the Framers. The 
President of the United States has been 
charged with high crimes—a constitu-
tional charge of abuse of power that in-
cludes in its text each of the elements 
of criminal bribery. The President’s 
lawyers have complained all week 
about the absence of sworn testimony 
from officials with first-hand knowl-
edge of the President’s actions and in-
tent. They claim not to know when the 
President froze the aid. They falsely 
claim there is no evidence the Presi-
dent withheld the aid in exchange for 
his political errand—announcing an in-
vestigation into his political rival. And 
yet whenever the President’s counsels 
have pled ignorance or claimed a lack 
of evidence, they ask not that we pur-
sue the truth; they ask instead that we 
look away. 
The Senate simply cannot look away. 
In the 220 years this body has served as 
a constitutional court of impeachment, 
we have never refused to look at crit-
ical evidence sitting in front of us. We 
have never raced to a pre-ordained ver-
dict while deliberately avoiding the 
truth or evaluating plainly critical evi-
dence. 
And when I say ‘‘sitting in front of 
us,’’ I mean that literally. Just this 
morning, 
we 
learned 
that 
Pat 
Cipollone, lead counsel for the Presi-
dent, along with Rudy Giuliani and 
Mick Mulvaney, was part of a meeting 
where President Trump directed John 
Bolton to ‘‘ensure [President] Zelensky 
would meet with Mr. Giuliani.’’ A 
meeting with the President’s personal 
lawyer is not subject to executive 
privilege; and a meeting with Bolton 
and Mulvaney is not subject to attor-
ney-client privilege. And this after-
noon we received a proffer from Lev 
Parnas’s 
attorney, 
claiming 
that 
Pamas could provide us with testimony 
implicating several cabinet officials 
and members of Congress in the Presi-
dent’s scheme. I cannot say whether 
that is credible, but shouldn’t he at 
least be heard and cross-examined? The 
Senate cannot turn a blind eye to such 
directly relevant evidence. 
This slipshod process reminds me of 
another trial. That was the trial of 
Alice in Wonderland. In that trial, the 
accusation was read, and the King im-
mediately said to the jury, ‘‘Consider 
your verdict.’’ But even in that case it 
was acknowledged that ‘‘There’s a 
great deal to come before that,’’ and 
the first witness was called. With 
apologies to Lewis Carroll, surely the 
United States Senate can at least 
match the rigorous criminal procedure 
of Wonderland? 
The oath that each of us swore just 
two weeks ago requires that we do ‘‘im-
partial justice.’’ Reasonable people can 
disagree about what that means, but 
every single time this body has sat as 
a court—every single time—it has 
heard from witnesses and weighed 
sworn testimony. We have never been 
denied the opportunity to hear from 
critical witnesses with firsthand infor-
mation. During the Johnson trial, this 
court heard live testimony from 41 wit-
nesses, including private counsel for 
the President and a cabinet secretary. 
During the Clinton trial, three wit-
nesses were deposed and we considered 
the grand jury testimony of the Presi-
dent’s chief of staff, deputy chief of 
staff, and White House Counsel—plus 
the grand jury testimony of the Presi-
dent himself. ‘‘Impartial justice’’ can-
not mean burying our collective heads 
in the sand, and preventing relevant, 
probative testimony from being taken. 
Briefly, I also want to address the ar-
guments made against calling wit-
nesses. The President has said that 
‘‘Witnesses are up to the House, not up 
to the Senate.’’ But the Senate has 
never been, and should not be now, lim-
ited to the House record. The Senate’s 
constitutional obligation to try im-
peachments stands independent of the 
House’s obligation. The Constitution 
does not allow the House’s action or in-
action to limit the evidence and testi-
mony the Senate can and must con-
sider. The last time we sat as a court 
we heard from 26 witnesses in total, in-
cluding 17 who had not testified before 
the House. Seventeen. 
Some have also said that calling wit-
nesses like John Bolton would leave us 
tangled up in an endless court battle 
over executive privilege. Not so. The 
Senate alone has the ‘‘sole Power to 
try all Impeachments,’’ and the Chief 
Justice reminded us just a few years 
ago in Zivotofsky v. Clinton that Arti-
cle III courts cannot hear cases ‘‘where 
there ‘is a textually demonstrable con-
stitutional commitment of the issue to 
a coordinate political department.’ ’’ 
And in Walter Nixon v. United States, 
the Supreme Court expressly ruled out 
‘‘[j]udicial involvement in impeach-
ment proceedings, even if only for pur-
poses of judicial review.’’ 
Moreover, and more simply, execu-
tive privilege cannot prevent testi-
mony from a private citizen like 
Bolton who is willing to testify. And, 
in any event, the President has almost 
certainly waived any claim to privilege 
by endlessly tweeting and talking to 
the media about his conversations with 
Bolton. The Senate is not helpless. We 
are the only court with jurisdiction. 
We can and should resolve these ques-
tions. 
Let us conduct this trial with the se-
riousness it deserves—consistent with 
Senate precedent, the overwhelming 
expectations of the American people, 
and how every other trial across the 
country is conducted every single day. 
As Senators, we are here to debate 
and vote on difficult questions. I under-
stand this may be a difficult question 
politically—but it is nowhere close to a 
difficult question under the law or 
common sense. I do not believe for one 
second that any of us sought public of-
fice to become an accomplice to what 
can only be described as a cover-up. As 
the Chief Justice has reminded us, we 
have the privilege of serving in the 
world’s greatest deliberative body. So 
let’s actually deliberate. 
But if we adopt the rule—rejected 
even in Wonderland—of verdict first, 
witnesses later, be assured those wit-
nesses will eventually follow. Whether 
through FOIA, journalism, or book re-
leases, the American people will learn 
the truth, likely sooner rather than 
later. Maybe even over the upcoming 
weekend. What will they think of a 
Senate that went to such extraor-
dinary lengths—ignoring 220 years of 
precedent, any notions of fairness or 
respect for facts, and indeed ignoring 
our duties to the Constitution itself— 
to keep the truth buried? 
A vote to preclude witnesses will em-
bolden this President to further de-
mean the Congress, this Senate, and 
the balance of power so carefully estab-
lished by the Framers in the Constitu-
tion. It will ratify the President’s shell 
game of telling the House it should sue 
to enforce its subpoenas, and then tell-
ing courts that the House has no stand-
ing to do so. Just today, after a week

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S914 
February 5, 2020 
of his counsel arguing that the Presi-
dent cannot be impeached for failing to 
respond to House subpoenas, the Jus-
tice Department argued in court that 
the House can use its impeachment 
power to enforce its subpoenas. It is up 
to all 100 of us to put a stop to this 
nonsense. 
I have served in this body for 45 
years. It is not often we face votes like 
this—votes that will leave a significant 
mark on history, and will shape our 
constitutional ability to serve as a 
check against presidents for genera-
tions to come. I pray the Senate is wor-
thy of this responsibility, and of this 
moment. I fear the repercussions if it is 
not. 
I will vote to hear from witnesses. 
With deep respect, I ask my fellow sen-
ators to do the same. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today 
to speak on the trial of President 
Trump. 
After information from more than a 
dozen witnesses, over a hundred ques-
tions, and days of oral arguments, I be-
lieve the House failed to prove its case 
for the two Articles of Impeachment. 
The House’s story relies on too much 
speculation, guessing games and rep-
etition. It fails to hold up under scru-
tiny. The House claims to have proven 
its case, but insists on more evidence. 
It was the House’s responsibility to en-
sure it had developed a complete record 
of the evidence it needed to make its 
case, and it is not up to the Senate to 
start the process over again. 
There were contradictions in the 
House’s case from the very beginning. 
The House counted on repetition to 
make its claims seem true, but often 
didn’t provide the underlying evidence. 
For example, the House managers re-
lied on telephone records for timing, 
but speculated on the content of the 
calls. 
The House managers claimed the 
President wanted to influence an elec-
tion, but it is difficult to see how the 
House’s rush to bring this case in such 
a haphazard manner is nothing more 
than an attempt to influence the 2020 
election. The House managers asked 
the Senate to do additional witnesses 
in 1 week, which could mean the Sen-
ate would essentially have to start the 
trial all over. 
I not only can’t call their efforts ade-
quate, I have to say they have been en-
tirely inadequate. Consequently, I did 
not vote for more witnesses or more 
evidence and will vote to acquit the 
President on both counts. 
I hope we can learn from everything 
we do, especially in regard to impeach-
ment. The animosity toward President 
Trump is unprecedented, and I believe 
it is the reason we have ended up where 
we are today. I believe we should give 
each newly elected President a chance 
to show what he or she can do. We 
should provide them the opportunity to 
prove themselves and demonstrate our 
faith in our country and its leadership. 
We have to give the President an op-
portunity to lead or even to fail. Unfor-
tunately, President Trump was prom-
ised an impeachment from the day he 
was elected, before he even took his 
oath of office. On the day of his inau-
guration, before any official act, there 
were riots where, and I quote from the 
New York Times, ‘‘protesters threw 
rocks and bricks at police officers, set 
a car on fire and shattered storefront 
windows.’’ I have never seen that kind 
of conduct before stemming from the 
result of our democratic process. I hope 
to never see it again. 
The obstruction continued as Presi-
dent Trump’s nominations were held 
up in an unprecedented way. This ob-
struction kept the new President from 
getting his key people in place. The few 
nominations approved had to work 
with career or hold-over staff from the 
previous administration. We have read 
in news articles that some of those 
staffers not only disliked their new 
bosses, but they tried to actively un-
dercut their policies. Sometimes they 
even delayed or used inaction or gave 
adverse advice. These types of tactics 
were used to put blame on their boss 
and on President Trump, and that ulti-
mately hurt our country, too. 
Again, almost immediately after the 
election came the call for investiga-
tions, ending with the appointment of 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This 
investigation went on for almost 2 
years. When the Mueller investigation 
didn’t yield the desired results, the 
President’s detractors returned to the 
continuing cry for an impeachment. 
The volume and pitch increased even as 
the 2020 election got closer. 
Eventually, the House of Representa-
tives found its latest accusation. Yet, 
not willing to conduct a thorough im-
peachment investigation and wanting 
to reach a foregone conclusion as the 
election year approached, the House of 
Representatives hurried its investiga-
tion so it would be done before Christ-
mas and the Senate would be forced to 
address these articles as a new year 
started. Ironically, after all that rush-
ing and taking shortcuts, the House de-
layed sending the articles to the Sen-
ate until the new year. All of this was 
just the latest example of the efforts to 
block President Trump’s agenda. 
I have now served in two Presidential 
impeachment trials, one during my 
first term and this one in my last. I 
have never underestimated the respon-
sibility of the task at hand or forgot-
ten the oaths I took to uphold the Con-
stitution. There are few duties senators 
will face as grave as deciding the fate 
of the President of the United States, 
but just like 21 years ago, this decision 
is about country, not politics. These 
experiences have helped refine my 
views, which I will now share. 
Our Forefathers did well setting the 
trial in the Senate where it takes a 2⁄3 
majority, currently 67 votes, to con-
vict. They could see the difficulty it 
would bring to the Nation if impeach-
ment could easily be convicted by a 
slight majority. Even though it is not 
the law, I would counsel the House not 
to impeach without at least a 3⁄5 vote in 
their own body, and that should in-
clude some number from the minority 
party. 
I have also come to believe that im-
peachment should be primarily about a 
criminal activity. Impeachment is in-
herently undemocratic because it re-
verses an election, so in election years, 
the bar for considering impeachment 
and removal goes even higher. Ulti-
mately, the American people should 
and will have the final say. 
The House of Representatives must 
also be sure to complete its investiga-
tion. It shouldn’t send the Senate im-
peachment charges and then expect the 
Senate to continue gathering more evi-
dence. The House should subpoena wit-
nesses and deal with defense claims 
such as privilege, even if that means 
going through the judicial process 
rather than placing such a burden on 
the Senate. 
The House cannot simply rely on rep-
etition of possibilities of violations, no 
matter how many times stated, to 
make their accusations true. A com-
plete investigation means the inves-
tigators don’t rush to judgment, don’t 
speculate about the content of calls, 
and don’t rely on repetition of accusa-
tions about the content of such calls as 
a substitute for seeking the truth. 
During the initial investigation, wit-
nesses should have already been de-
posed by both sides before it comes to 
the Senate. The President’s counsel 
must be allowed to cross-examine all 
persons deposed by the House. Then, 
and only then, can any of the witnesses 
be called to testify at the Senate trial. 
The House investigation has to be com-
plete. 
Finally, I would call for our outside 
institutions to also think about how 
they contribute to the well-being of 
our country. I have often said that con-
flict sells. It might even increase sales 
to consumers of news for both parties, 
but I fear that we are all treating this 
like a sport, speculating which team 
will win and which will lose. I suspect 
that some venomous statements about 
this process have ended some friend-
ships and strained some families. In 
the end, if we lose faith in our institu-
tions, our friends and our families, we 
will all lose. 
We desperately need more civility. 
That is simply being nice to each 
other. My mom said, ‘‘Bad behavior is 
inexcusable.’’ It violates the Golden 
Rule as revised by my mom, ‘‘Do 
what’s right. Do your best. Treat oth-
ers as THEY wish to be treated.’’ One 
of the first movies I saw was the now- 
ancient animated picture, ‘‘Bambi.’’ I 
am reminded of the little rabbit say-
ing, ‘‘My Mom always says, if you can’t 
say something nice, don’t say anything 
at all!’’ I believe we all agree on at 
least 80 percent of most issues, but the 
trend seems to be shifting to con-
centrate on the other 20 percent we 
don’t agree on. That 20 percent causes 
divisiveness, 
opposition, 
venomous 
harsh words, and anger.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S915 
February 5, 2020 
Too often, it feels like our Nation is 
only becoming more divided, more hos-
tile. I do not believe that our country 
will ever be able to successfully tackle 
our looming problems if we continue 
down this road. As we move forward 
from this chapter in our Nation’s his-
tory, I hope that we will focus more on 
our shared goals that can help our Na-
tion, and not the issues that drive us 
apart. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in my 25 
years representing North Carolina in 
Congress, I have cast thousands of 
votes, each with its own significance. 
The ones that weigh most heavily are 
those that send our men and women in 
uniform into armed conflict. Those are 
the votes I spend the most time debat-
ing before casting—first and foremost 
because of the human cost involved but 
secondly because they hold the power 
to irrevocably set the course of Amer-
ican history. 
With similar consideration, I have 
taken a sober and deliberate approach 
to the impeachment proceedings of the 
last few weeks, conscious of my con-
stitutional responsibility to serve as an 
impartial juror. 
As the investigative body, the House 
has charged President Trump with 
abuse of power and obstruction of Con-
gress. The Senate’s role is to determine 
whether the House has proven its case 
beyond a reasonable doubt and wheth-
er, if true, these charges rise to the 
level of removing the President from 
office. 
After listening to more than 70 hours 
of arguments from the House managers 
and the President’s counsel, I have con-
cluded that the House has not provided 
the Senate with a compelling reason 
for taking the unprecedented and de-
stabilizing step of removing the Presi-
dent from office. 
In my role as chairman of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee, I have visited 
countries all over the world. What sep-
arates the United States from every 
other nation on Earth is our predict-
able, peaceful transitions of power. 
Every 4 years, Americans cast their 
ballots with the confidence their vote 
will be counted and the knowledge that 
both winners and losers will abide by 
the results. 
To remove a U.S. President from of-
fice, for the first time in history, on 
anything less than overwhelming evi-
dence of ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or High 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ would ef-
fectively overturn the will of the 
American people. 
As the Speaker said last year, ‘‘Im-
peachment is so divisive to the country 
that unless there’s something so com-
pelling and overwhelming and bipar-
tisan, I don’t think we should go down 
that path, because it divides the coun-
try.’’ 
I believe the Speaker was correct in 
her assessment. A year later, however, 
the House went down that exact path, 
choosing to conduct a highly partisan 
impeachment 
inquiry, 
with 
underwhelming evidence, in a deeply 
flawed process. 
The House had ample opportunity to 
pursue the answers to its inquiry in 
order to prove their case beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. They chose not to do so. 
Instead, investigators followed an arbi-
trary, self-imposed timeline dictated 
by political, rather than substantive, 
concerns. 
For example, the House did not at-
tempt to compel certain witnesses to 
testify because doing so would have 
meant confronting issues of executive 
privilege and immunity. They argued 
navigating executive privilege—some-
thing every administration lays claim 
to—may have caused some level of 
delays and involved the courts. 
At the time, the House justified their 
decision by claiming the issue was too 
important, too urgent, for any delays. 
Yet, after the House voted on the Arti-
cles of Impeachment, the Speaker 
waited 4 full weeks before transmitting 
the articles to the Senate. Those were 
weeks the House could have spent fur-
thering its inquiry, had it not rushed 
the process. Instead, without a hint of 
irony, House leadership attempted to 
use that time to pressure the Senate 
into gathering the very witness testi-
mony their own investigators chose 
not to pursue. 
Additionally, in drafting the Articles 
of Impeachment, the House stated 
President Trump committed ‘‘Criminal 
bribery 
and 
honest 
services 
wire 
fraud,’’ two crimes that carry penalties 
under our Criminal Code. Inexplicably, 
the House chose not to include those 
alleged criminal misdeeds in the arti-
cles sent to the Senate, much less 
argue them in front of this body. 
At every turn, it appears the House 
made decisions not based on the pur-
suit of justice but on politics. When 
due process threatened to slow down 
the march forward, they took short-
cuts. When evidence was too com-
plicated to obtain or an accusation did 
not carry weight, the House created 
new, flimsy standards on the fly, hop-
ing public pressure would sway Senate 
jurors in lieu of facts. 
The Founding Fathers who crafted 
our modern impeachment mechanism 
predicted this moment, and warned 
against a solely partisan and politi-
cally motivated process. 
In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton 
wrote, ‘‘In many cases [impeachment] 
will connect itself with the pre-exist-
ing factions, and will enlist all their 
animosities, partialities, influence, and 
interest on one side or on the other; 
and in such cases there will always be 
the greatest danger that the decision 
will be regulated more by the compara-
tive strength of parties, than by the 
real demonstrations of innocence or 
guilt.’’ 
Hamilton believed impeachment was 
a necessary tool but one to be used 
when the evidence of wrongdoing was 
so overwhelming, it elevated the proc-
ess above partiality and partisanship. 
The House has failed to meet that 
standard. 
The Founders also warned against 
using impeachment as recourse for 
management or policy disagreements 
with the President. 
Prior to America’s founding, im-
peachment had been used for centuries 
in England as a measure to reprimand 
crown-appointed officials and landed 
gentry. At the time, it included the 
vague charge of ‘‘maladministration,’’ 
as well. 
During the Constitutional Conven-
tion in 1787, George Mason moved to 
add ‘‘maladministration’’ to the U.S. 
Constitution’s list of impeachable of-
fenses, asking: ‘‘Why is the provision 
restrained to Treason & bribery only? 
Treason as defined in the Constitution 
will not reach many great and dan-
gerous offences. Attempts to subvert 
the Constitution may not be Treason 
as above defined.’’ 
I submit for this body James Madi-
son’s response: ‘‘So vague a term will 
be equivalent to a tenure during the 
pleasure of the Senate.’’ 
Madison knew that impeachment 
based purely on disagreements about 
governance would turn the U.S. Con-
gress into a parliamentary body, akin 
to those tumultuous coalitions in Eu-
rope, which could recall a President on 
little more than a whim. To do so 
would subordinate the Executive to the 
Congress, rather than delineating its 
role as a coequal branch of our Federal 
Government. And with political winds 
changing as frequently then as they do 
now, he saw that every President could 
theoretically be thus impeached on 
fractious and uncertain terms. 
In a functioning democracy, the 
President cannot serve at ‘‘the pleas-
ure of Senate.’’ He must serve at the 
pleasure of the people. 
Gouverneur Morris supported Madi-
son’s argument, adding at the time: 
‘‘An election every four years will pre-
vent maladministration.’’ 
Thus ‘‘maladministration’’ was not 
made an impeachable offense in Amer-
ica, expressly because we have the re-
course of free and fair elections. 
I bring up this story for two reasons. 
First, the Founder’s decision signals to 
me they felt strongly that an impeach-
able offense must be a crime akin to 
treason, bribery, or an act equally seri-
ous, as defined in the Criminal Code. 
Second, this story tells me the Found-
ers believed anything that does not 
meet 
the 
Constitutional 
threshold 
should be navigated through the elec-
toral process. 
By that standard, I do not believe the 
Articles of Impeachment presented to 
the Senate rise to the level of removal 
from office, nor do I believe House 
managers succeeded in making the 
case incumbent upon them to prove. 
Given the weak underpinnings of the 
articles themselves and the House’s 
partisan process, it would be an error 
to remove the President mere months 
before a national election; therefore, I 
have concluded I will vote to acquit 
President Donald J. Trump on both ar-
ticles of impeachment. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today is a somber day for our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S916 
February 5, 2020 
As Senators, we are here as representa-
tives of the American people. It is our 
duty, as we each swore to do when we 
took our oath of office, to support and 
defend the Constitution. We also took 
an oath, as judges and jurors in this 
proceeding, to pursue ‘‘impartial jus-
tice’’ as we consider these articles—in-
cluding the serious charge that the 
President of the United States lever-
aged the power of his office for his own 
personal gain. 
Those are the oaths that the Framers 
set out for us in the Constitution, to 
guide the Senate in its oversight re-
sponsibilities. The Framers believed 
that the legislative branch was best po-
sitioned to provide a check on the Ex-
ecutive. They envisioned that the sepa-
ration of powers would allow each 
branch of government to oversee the 
other. They also knew, based on their 
experience living under the British 
monarchy, that someday a President 
might corrupt the powers of the office. 
William Davie from North Carolina 
was particularly concerned that a 
President could abuse his office by 
sparing ‘‘no efforts or means whatever 
to get himself reelected.’’ 
So the Framers put in place a stand-
ard that would cover a range of Presi-
dential misconduct, settling on: ‘‘Trea-
son, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors.’’ As Alexander Ham-
ilton explained in Federalist 65, the 
phrase was intended to cover the 
‘‘abuse or violation of some public 
trust’’ and ‘‘injuries done immediately 
to society itself.’’ The Framers de-
signed a remedy for this public harm: 
removal from public office. So now we 
are here as judge and jury to try the 
case and to evaluate whether the Presi-
dent’s acts have violated the public 
trust and injured our democracy. 
I am concerned of course that the 
Senate has decided that we must make 
this decision without all the facts. 
With a 51 to 49 vote, the senate blocked 
the opportunity to call witnesses with 
firsthand knowledge or to get relevant 
documents. Fairness means evidence— 
it means documents, and it means wit-
nesses. In every past impeachment 
trial in the Senate, in this body’s en-
tire 231-year history, there have been 
witnesses. There is no reason why the 
Senate should not have called people to 
testify who have firsthand knowledge 
of the President’s conduct, especially 
if, as some of my colleagues have sug-
gested, you believe the facts are in dis-
pute. 
During the question period, I asked 
about 
the 
impeachment 
of 
Judge 
Porteous in 2010. I joined several of my 
colleagues in serving on the trial com-
mittee. We heard from 26 witnesses in 
the Senate, 17 of whom were new wit-
nesses who had not previously testified 
in the House. What possible reason 
could there be for allowing 26 witnesses 
in a judicial impeachment trial and 
zero in a President’s trial? How can we 
consider this a fair trial if we are not 
even willing to try and get to the 
truth? 
We do not even have to try and find 
it. John Bolton has firsthand knowl-
edge about central facts in this case, 
and he said he would comply with a 
subpoena from the Senate. We also 
know there are documents that could 
verify 
testimony 
presented 
in 
the 
House, like records of emails sent be-
tween administration officials in the 
days after the July 25 call. We cannot 
ignore this evidence—we have a con-
stitutional duty to consider it. 
And since this trial began, new evi-
dence has continued to emerge. One 
way or another, the truth is going to 
come out. I believe that history will re-
member that the majority in this body 
did not seek out the evidence and in-
stead decided that the President’s al-
leged corrupt acts did not even require 
a closer look. 
But even without firsthand accounts 
and without primary documents, the 
House managers have presented a com-
pelling case. I was particularly inter-
ested in the evidence that the man-
agers presented showing that the Presi-
dent’s conduct put our national secu-
rity at risk by jeopardizing our support 
for Ukraine. 
Protecting Ukraine’s fragile democ-
racy has been a bipartisan priority. I 
went to Ukraine with the late Senator 
John McCain and Senator LINDSEY 
GRAHAM right after the 2016 election to 
make clear that the United States 
would continue to support our ally 
Ukraine in the face of Russian aggres-
sion—that we will stand up for democ-
racy. As the House managers stressed, 
it is in our national security interest 
to strengthen Ukraine’s democracy. 
The United States has 60,000 troops sta-
tioned in Europe, and thousands of 
Ukrainians have died fighting Russian 
forces and their proxies. 
Our Nation’s support for Ukraine is 
critically needed. Ukraine is at the 
frontline of Russian aggression, and 
since the Russians invaded Crimea in 
2014, the United States has provided 
over $1.5 billion in aid. Russia is watch-
ing everything we do. So this summer, 
as a new Ukrainian President prepared 
to lead his country and address the war 
with Russia, it was critical that Presi-
dent Trump showed the world that we 
stand with Ukraine. Instead, President 
Trump decided to withhold military se-
curity assistance and to deny the 
Ukrainian President an Oval Office 
meeting. In doing so, he jeopardized 
our national security interests and put 
the Ukrainians in danger. But worse 
yet, he did so to benefit himself. 
Testimony from the 17 current and 
former officials from the President’s 
administration made it clear that the 
President leveraged the power of his of-
fice to pressure Ukraine to announce 
an investigation into his political 
rival. These brave public servants de-
fied the President’s order and agreed to 
testify about what happened despite 
the risks to their careers. Former U.S. 
Ambassador 
to 
Ukraine 
Marie 
Yovanovitch showed particular cour-
age, testifying before the House even as 
the President disparaged her on Twit-
ter. And I will never forget when Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman testified and 
sent a message to his immigrant fa-
ther, saying, ‘‘Don’t worry Dad, I will 
be fine for telling the truth.’’ 
As Manager SCHIFF said, in our coun-
try ‘‘right matters.’’ What is right and 
wrong under our Constitution does not 
turn on whether or not you like the 
President. It is not about whether the 
disregard for its boundaries furthers 
policies that you agree or disagree 
with. It is about whether it remains 
true that in our country, right mat-
ters. Through his actions, the Presi-
dent compromised the security of our 
ally Ukraine, invited foreign inter-
ference in our elections, and under-
mined the integrity of our democratic 
process—conduct that I believe the 
Framers would see as an abuse of 
power and violation of his oath of of-
fice. 
The Articles of Impeachment include 
a second charge: that the President 
used the powers of his office to prevent 
Congress from investigating his actions 
and attempted to place himself above 
the law. 
Unlike any President before him, 
President Trump categorically refused 
to comply with any requests from Con-
gress. Even President Nixon directed 
‘‘all the president’s men’’ to comply 
with congressional requests. Despite 
that history, President Trump directed 
every member of his administration 
not to comply with requests to testify 
and also directed the executive branch 
not to release a single document. 
The President’s refusal to respect the 
Congress’s authority is a direct threat 
to the separation of powers. The Con-
stitution gives the House the ‘‘sole 
power of impeachment,’’ a tool of last 
resort to provide a check on the presi-
dent. By refusing to cooperate, the 
President is attempting to erase the 
Congress’s constitutional power and to 
prevent the American people from 
learning of his misconduct. As we dis-
cussed during our questions, the Presi-
dent is asserting that his aides have 
absolute immunity, a proposition that 
Federal courts have consistently re-
jected. Manager Demings warned, ‘‘ab-
solute power corrupts absolutely.’’ 
But this President has taken many 
steps to place himself above the law. 
This administration has taken the po-
sition that a sitting President cannot 
be indicted or prosecuted. This Presi-
dent has argued that he is immune 
from State and criminal investiga-
tions. And now we are being asked to 
say that the Constitution’s check on a 
President’s power, as set out by the 
Framers, cannot prevent a President 
from abusing his power and covering it 
up. 
During the trial, we have heard this 
directly from the President’s defense. 
In the words of Alan Dershowitz, ‘‘If a 
president does something which he be-
lieves will help him get elected—in the 
public interest—that cannot be the 
kind of quid pro quo that results in im-
peachment.’’ These echo the words of

S917 
February 5, 2020 
an 
impeached 
President, 
Richard 
Nixon, who said: ‘‘When the president 
does it, that means it is not illegal.’’ 
We cannot accept that conclusion. In 
this country the President is not King, 
the law is King. But if the Senate looks 
past the President’s defiance of Con-
gress, we will forever undermine our 
status as a coequal branch and under-
mine the rule of law. 
So as we consider these Articles of 
Impeachment, I ask my colleagues to 
think about the consequences. Our sys-
tem, designed by the Framers 232 years 
ago, is one not of absolute power but of 
power through and by the people. We 
are, in some ways, faced with the same 
question the Founders faced when they 
made the fateful decision to challenge 
the unchecked power of a King. 
When signing the Declaration of 
Independence, John Hancock signed his 
name large and said, ‘‘There must be 
no pulling different ways. We must all 
hang together.’’ Benjamin Franklin re-
plied, ‘‘Yes, we must, indeed, all hang 
together, or most assuredly we shall all 
hang separately.’’ 
We have the opportunity today to 
stand together and say that the Con-
stitution, that these United States, are 
stronger than our enemies, foreign and 
domestic, and we, together, are strong-
er than a President who would corrupt 
our democracy with an abuse of power 
and an attempt to deny the rights of a 
coequal branch of government. We do 
not have to agree on everything today 
or tomorrow or a year from now, but 
surely we can agree on the same basic 
principles: that this is a government of 
laws, not of men-and women; that in 
this country, no one is above the law. 
If we can agree on that much, then I 
submit to my colleagues that the 
choice before us is clear. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, an im-
peachment trial of a sitting President 
of the United States is not a matter to 
be taken lightly. A President should 
not and must not be impeached because 
of political disagreements or policy dif-
ferences. That is what elections are for. 
Instead, an impeachment trial occurs 
when a President violates the oath he 
or she swore to uphold the Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
Therefore, there are two questions 
for me to answer as a juror in the im-
peachment trial of President Donald J. 
Trump: whether President Trump is 
guilty of abusing his power as Presi-
dent for his own political gain and 
whether he obstructed Congress in 
their investigation of him. 
The first Article of Impeachment 
charges President Trump with abuse of 
power when he ‘‘solicited the inter-
ference 
of 
a 
foreign 
government, 
Ukraine, in the 2020 United States 
Presidential election.’’ Based on the 
evidence I heard during the Senate 
trial, Trump ‘‘corruptly solicited’’ an 
investigation into former Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden and his son in order to 
benefit his own reelection chances. To 
increase 
the 
pressure 
on 
Ukraine, 
President Trump then withheld ap-
proximately $400 million in military 
aid from Ukraine. Finally, according to 
the 
charges, 
even 
when 
Trump’s 
scheme to withhold aid was made pub-
lic, he ‘‘persisted in openly and cor-
ruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to 
undertake investigations for his per-
sonal political benefit.’’ So on this first 
Article of Impeachment, it is my view 
that the President is clearly guilty. 
The second Article of Impeachment 
asserts that Trump obstructed Con-
gress in its investigation of Trump’s 
abuse of power, stating that Trump 
‘‘has directed the unprecedented, cat-
egorical, and indiscriminate defiance of 
subpoenas issued by the House of Rep-
resentatives 
pursuant 
to 
its 
‘sole 
Power of Impeachment.’ ’’ According to 
the warped logic of the arguments pre-
sented by the President’s counsel, 
there are almost no legal bounds to 
anything a President can do so long as 
it benefits his own reelection. If a 
President 
cannot 
be 
investigated 
criminally or by Congress while in of-
fice, then he or she would be effectively 
above the law. President Trump, who 
raised absurd legal arguments to hide 
his actions and obstruct Congress, is 
clearly guilty here as well. 
Now, frankly, while the House of 
Representatives passed two Articles of 
Impeachment, President Trump could 
have been impeached for more than 
just that. 
For example, it seems clear that 
Donald Trump has violated both the 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
emoluments 
clauses. In other words, it appears 
Trump has used the Federal Govern-
ment over and over to benefit himself 
financially. 
In 2018 alone, Trump’s organization 
made over $40 million in profit just 
from his Trump hotel in DC alone. And 
foreign governments, including lob-
bying firms connected to the Saudi 
Arabian Government, have spent hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars at that 
hotel. That appears to be corruption, 
pure and simple. 
In addition, as we all know, there is 
significant 
evidence 
that 
Donald 
Trump committed obstruction of jus-
tice with regard to the Robert Mueller 
investigation by, among other actions, 
firing the FBI Director, James Comey. 
One of the difficulties of dealing with 
President Trump and his administra-
tion is that we cannot trust his words. 
He is a pathological liar who, according 
to media research, has lied thousands 
of times since he was elected. During 
the trial, I posed a question to the 
House impeachment managers: Given 
that the media has documented Presi-
dent Trump’s thousands of lies while in 
office—more than 16,200 as of January 
20, 2020—why would we be expected to 
believe that anything President Trump 
says has credibility? The answer is 
that, sadly, we cannot. 
Sadly, we now have a President who 
sees himself as above the law and is ei-
ther ignorant or indifferent to the Con-
stitution. And we have a President who 
clearly 
committed 
impeachable 
of-
fenses. 
The evidence of Trump’s guilt is so 
overwhelming 
that 
the 
Republican 
Party, for the first time in the history 
of 
Presidential 
impeachment, 
ob-
structed testimony from witnesses— 
even willing witnesses. It defies basic 
common sense that in a trial to deter-
mine whether the President of the 
United States is above the law, the 
Senate would not hear from the people 
who could speak directly to President 
Trump’s behavior and motive. Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s handling of this 
trial, unfortunately, was nothing more 
than a political act. 
Yet this impeachment trial is about 
more than just the charges against 
President Trump. What this impeach-
ment vote will decide is whether we be-
lieve that the President, any President, 
is above the law. 
Last week, Alan Dershowitz, one of 
President Trump’s lawyers, argued to 
the Senate that a President cannot be 
impeached for any actions he or she 
takes that are intended to benefit their 
own reelection. That is truly an ex-
traordinary and unconstitutional as-
sertion. If Trump is acquitted, I fear 
the repercussions of this argument 
would do grave damage to the rule of 
law in our country. 
Imagine what such a precedent would 
allow an incumbent president to get 
away with for the sake of their own re-
election. Hacking an opponent’s email 
using government resources? Soliciting 
election 
interference 
from 
China? 
Under this argument, what would stop 
a President from withholding infra-
structure or education funding to a 
given State to pressure elected officials 
into helping the President politically? 
Let me be clear: Republicans will set 
a dangerous and lawless precedent if 
they vote to acquit President Trump. A 
Republican acquittal of Donald Trump 
won’t just mean that the current Presi-
dent is above the law; it will give a 
green light to all future Presidents to 
disregard the law so long as it benefits 
their reelection. 
It gives me no pleasure to conclude 
that President Donald Trump is guilty 
of the offenses laid out in the two Arti-
cles of Impeachment. I will vote to 
convict on both counts. But my greater 
concern is if Republicans acquit Presi-
dent Trump by undercutting the very 
rule of law. That will truly be remem-
bered as a sad and dangerous moment 
in the history of our country. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about the House Articles of Im-
peachment against President Donald 
Trump. 
In 1999, then-Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware asked the following question 
during the impeachment trial of Presi-
dent Bill Clinton: ‘‘[D]o these actions 
rise to the level of high crimes and 
misdemeanors necessary to justify the 
most obviously antidemocratic act the 
Senate can engage in—overturning an 
election by convicting the president?’’ 
He answered his own question by vot-
ing against removing President Clinton 
from office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S918 
February 5, 2020 
It is this constitutionally grounded 
framework—articulated well by Vice 
President Biden—that guided my re-
view of President Trump’s impeach-
ment and, ultimately, my decision to 
oppose his removal. 
House Democrats’ impeachment arti-
cles allege that President Trump brief-
ly paused aid and withheld a White 
House meeting with Ukraine’s Presi-
dent to pressure Ukraine into inves-
tigating two publicly reported corrup-
tion matters. The first matter was pos-
sible Ukrainian interference in our 2016 
election. The second was Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s role in firing the con-
troversial Ukrainian prosecutor inves-
tigating a company on whose board 
Vice President Biden’s son sat. When 
House Democrats demanded witnesses 
and documents concerning the Presi-
dent’s conduct, he invoked constitu-
tional rights and resisted their de-
mands. 
The President’s actions were not 
‘‘perfect.’’ Some were inappropriate. 
But the question before the Senate is 
not whether his actions were perfect; it 
is whether they constitute impeachable 
offenses that justify removing a sitting 
President from office for the first time 
and forbidding him from seeking office 
again. 
Let’s consider the case against Presi-
dent Trump: obstruction of Congress 
and abuse of power. On obstruction, 
House Democrats allege the President 
lacked ‘‘lawful cause or excuse’’ to re-
sist their subpoenas. This ignores that 
his resistance was based on constitu-
tionally grounded legal defenses and 
immunities that are consistent with 
longstanding positions taken by ad-
ministrations of both parties. Instead 
of negotiating a resolution or liti-
gating in court, House Democrats 
rushed to impeach. But as House 
Democrats 
noted 
during 
President 
Clinton’s impeachment, a President’s 
defense of his legal and constitutional 
rights and responsibilities is not an im-
peachable offense. 
House Democrats separately allege 
President Trump abused his power by 
conditioning a White House meeting 
and the release of aid on Ukraine 
agreeing to pursue corruption inves-
tigations. Their case rests entirely on 
the faulty claim that the only possible 
motive for his actions was his personal 
political gain. In fact, there are also le-
gitimate national interests for seeking 
investigations into apparent corrup-
tion, especially when taxpayer dollars 
are involved. 
Here is what ultimately occurred: 
President Trump met with Ukraine’s 
President, and the aid was released 
after a brief pause. These actions hap-
pened without Ukraine announcing or 
conducting investigations. The idea 
that President Trump committed an 
impeachable offense by meeting with 
Ukraine’s President at the United Na-
tions in New York instead of Wash-
ington, DC is absurd. Moreover, the 
pause in aid did not hinder Ukraine’s 
ability to combat Russia. In fact, as 
witnesses in the House impeachment 
proceedings stated, U.S. policy in sup-
port of Ukraine is stronger under 
President Trump than under President 
Obama. 
Even if House Democrats’ presump-
tions about President Trump’s motives 
are true, additional witnesses in the 
Senate, beyond the 17 witnesses who 
testified in the House impeachment 
proceedings, are unnecessary because 
the President’s actions do not rise to 
the level of removing him from office, 
nor do they warrant the societal up-
heaval that would result from his re-
moval from office and the ballot 
months before an election. Our country 
is already far too divided and this 
would only make matters worse. 
As Vice President Biden also stated 
during President Clinton’s impeach-
ment trial, ‘‘[t]here is no question the 
Constitution sets the bar for impeach-
ment very high.’’ A President can only 
be impeached and removed for ‘‘Trea-
son, Bribery, or other high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors.’’ While there is debate 
about the precise meaning of ‘‘other 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors,’’ it is 
clear that impeachable conduct must 
be comparable to the serious offenses 
of treason and bribery. 
The Constitution sets the impeach-
ment bar so high for good reasons. Re-
moving a President from office and for-
bidding him from seeking future office 
overturns the results of the last elec-
tion and denies Americans the right to 
vote for him in the next one. The Sen-
ate’s impeachment power essentially 
allows 67 Senators to substitute their 
judgment for the judgment of millions 
of Americans. 
The framework Vice President Biden 
articulated in 1999 for judging an im-
peachment was right then, and it is 
right now. President Trump’s conduct 
does not meet the very high bar re-
quired to justify overturning the elec-
tion, removing him from office, and 
kicking him off the ballot in an elec-
tion that has already begun. In Novem-
ber, the American people will decide 
for 
themselves 
whether 
President 
Trump should stay in office. In our 
democratic system, that is the way it 
should be. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, voting to 
find the President guilty in the Senate 
is not simply a finding of wrongdoing; 
it is a vote to remove a President from 
office for the first time in the 243-year 
history of our Republic. 
When they decided to include im-
peachment in the Constitution, the 
Framers understood how disruptive 
and traumatic it would be. As Alex-
ander Hamilton warned, impeachment 
will ‘‘agitate the passions of the whole 
community.’’ 
This is why they decided to require 
the support of two-thirds of the Senate 
to remove a President we serve as a 
guardrail against partisan impeach-
ment and against removal of a Presi-
dent without broad public support. 
Leaders in both parties previously 
recognized that impeachment must be 
bipartisan and must enjoy broad public 
support. In fact, as recently as March 
of last year, Manager ADAM SCHIFF said 
there would be ‘‘little to be gained by 
putting the country through’’ the 
‘‘wrenching experience’’ of a partisan 
impeachment. Yet, only a few months 
later, a partisan impeachment is ex-
actly what the House produced. This 
meant two Articles of Impeachment 
whose true purpose was not to protect 
the Nation but, rather, to, as Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI said, stain the Presi-
dent’s record because ‘‘he has been im-
peached forever’’ and ‘‘they can never 
erase that.’’ 
It now falls upon this Senate to take 
up what the House produced and faith-
fully execute our duties under the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
Why does impeachment exist? 
As manager JERRY NADLER reminded 
us last week, removal is not a punish-
ment for a crime, nor is removal sup-
posed to be a way to hold Presidents 
accountable; that is what elections are 
for. The sole purpose of this extraor-
dinary power to remove the one person 
entrusted with all of the powers of an 
entire branch of government is to pro-
vide a last-resort remedy to protect the 
country. That is why Hamilton wrote 
that in these trials our decisions 
should be pursuing ‘‘the public good.’’ 
Even before the trial, I announced 
that, for me, the question would not 
just be whether the President’s actions 
were wrong but ultimately whether 
what he did was removable. The two 
are not the same. It is possible for an 
offense to meet a standard of impeach-
ment and yet not be in the best inter-
est of the country to remove a Presi-
dent from office. 
To answer this question, the first 
step was to ask whether it would serve 
the public good to remove the Presi-
dent, even if the managers had proven 
every allegation they made. It was not 
difficult to answer that question on the 
charge of obstruction of congress. The 
President availed himself of legal de-
fenses and constitutional privileges on 
the advice of his legal counsel. He has 
taken a position identical to that of 
every other administration in the last 
50 years. That is not an impeachable 
offense, much less a removable one. 
Negotiations with Congress and en-
forcement in the courts, not impeach-
ment, should be the front-line recourse 
when Congress and the President dis-
agree on the separation of powers. But 
here, the House failed to go to court 
because, as Manager SCHIFF admitted, 
they did not want to go through a year-
long exercise to get the information 
they wanted. Ironically, they now de-
mand that the Senate go through this 
very long exercise they themselves de-
cided to avoid. 
On the first Article of Impeachment, 
I reject the argument that abuse of 
power can never constitute grounds for 
removal unless a crime or a crime-like 
action is alleged. However, even if the 
House managers had been able to prove 
every allegation made in article I,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S919 
February 5, 2020 
would it be in the interest of the Na-
tion to remove the President? Answer-
ing this question requires a political 
judgment—one that takes into account 
both the severity of the wrongdoing 
they allege and the impact removal 
would have on the Nation. 
I disagree with the House Managers’ 
argument that, if we find the allega-
tions they have made are true, failing 
to remove the President leaves us with 
no remedy to constrain this or future 
Presidents. Congress and the courts 
have multiple ways by which to con-
strain the power of the Executive. And 
ultimately, voters themselves can hold 
the President accountable in an elec-
tion, including the one just 9 months 
from now. 
I also considered removal in the con-
text of the bitter divisions and deep po-
larization our country currently faces. 
The removal of the President—espe-
cially one based on a narrowly voted 
impeachment, supported by one polit-
ical party and opposed by another and 
without broad public support—would, 
as Manager NADLER warned over two 
decades ago, ‘‘produce divisiveness and 
bitterness’’ that will threaten our Na-
tion for decades. Can anyone doubt 
that at least half of the country would 
view his removal as illegitimate—as 
nothing short of a coup d’e´tat? It is dif-
ficult to conceive of any scheme Putin 
could undertake that would undermine 
confidence in our democracy more than 
removal would. 
I also reject the argument that un-
less we call new witnesses, this is not a 
fair trial. First, they cannot argue that 
fairness demands we seek witnesses 
they did little to pursue. Second, even 
if new witnesses would testify to the 
truth of the allegations made, these al-
legations, even if they had been able to 
prove them, would not warrant the 
President’s removal. 
This high bar I have set is not new 
for me. In 2014, I rejected calls to pur-
sue impeachment of President Obama, 
noting that he ‘‘has two years left in 
his term,’’ and, instead of pursuing im-
peachment, we should use existing 
tools at our disposal to ‘‘limit the 
amount of damage he’s doing to our 
economy and our national security.’’ 
Senator PATRICK LEAHY, the Presi-
dent 
pro 
tempore 
emeritus, 
once 
warned, ‘‘[A] partisan impeachment 
cannot command the respect of the 
American people. It is no more valid 
than a stolen election.’’ His words are 
more true today than when he said 
them two decades ago. We should heed 
his advice. 
I will not vote to remove the Presi-
dent because doing so would inflict ex-
traordinary and potentially irreparable 
damage to our already divided Nation. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am 
glad that this unfortunate chapter in 
American history is over. The strength 
of our Republic lies in the fact that, 
more often than not, we settle our po-
litical differences at the ballot box, not 
on the streets or battlefield and not 
through impeachment. 
Just last year, Speaker PELOSI said 
that any impeachment ‘‘would have to 
be so clearly bipartisan in terms of ac-
ceptance of it.’’ And in 1998, Represent-
ative NADLER, currently a House im-
peachment manager, said, ‘‘There must 
never be . . . an impeachment substan-
tially supported by one of our major 
political parties and largely opposed by 
the other . . . Such an impeachment 
would lack legitimacy, would produce 
divisiveness and bitterness in our poli-
tics for years to come . . .’’ 
And yet, that is exactly what House 
Democrats passed. I truly wish Speaker 
PELOSI, Chairman NADLER, and their 
House colleagues would have followed 
their own advice. 
As I listened to the House managers’ 
closing arguments, I jotted down adjec-
tives describing the case they were 
making: angry, disingenuous, hyper-
bolic, sanctimonious, distorted—if not 
outright 
dishonest—and 
overstated; 
they were making a mountain out of a 
molehill. 
Congressman SCHIFF and the other 
House managers are not stupid. They 
had to know that their insults and ac-
cusations—that 
the 
President 
had 
threatened to put our heads on a pike, 
that the Senate was on trial, that we 
would be part of the coverup if we 
didn’t cave to their demand for wit-
nesses—would not sway Republican 
Senators. No, they had another goal in 
mind. They were using impeachment 
and their public offices to accomplish 
the very thing they accused President 
Trump of doing, interfering in the 2020 
election. 
Impeachment should be reserved for 
the most serious of offenses where the 
risk to our democracy simply cannot 
wait for the voters’ next decision. That 
was not the case here. 
Instead, the greater damage to our 
democracy would be to ratify a highly 
partisan House impeachment process 
that lacked due process and sought to 
impose a duty on the Senate to repair 
the House’s flawed product. Caving to 
House managers’ demands would have 
set a dangerous precedent and dramati-
cally altered the constitutional order, 
further weaponizing impeachment and 
encouraging more of them. 
Now that the trial is over, I sincerely 
hope everyone involved has renewed 
appreciation for the genius of our 
Founding Fathers and for the separa-
tion of powers they incorporated into 
the U.S. Constitution. I also hope all 
the players in this national travesty go 
forward with a greater sense of humil-
ity and recognition of the limits the 
Constitution places on their respective 
offices. 
I am concerned about the divisive-
ness and bitterness that Chairman 
NADLER warned us about. We are a di-
vided nation, and it often seems the 
lines are only hardening and growing 
farther apart. But hope lies in finding 
what binds us together—our love of 
freedom, our faith, our families. 
We serve those who elect us. It is ap-
propriate and necessary to engage in 
discussion and debate to sway public 
opinion, but in the end, it is essential 
that we rely upon, respect, and accept 
the public’s electoral decisions. 
In addition, I ask unanimous consent 
that my November 18, 2019, letter to 
Congressmen NUNES and JORDAN, and 
the January 22, 2020, Real Clear Inves-
tigations article written by Paul Sper-
ry be printed in the RECORD following 
my remarks. 
The November 18, 2019, letter re-
sponds to NUNES’ and JORDAN’s request 
to provide information regarding my 
firsthand knowledge of events regard-
ing Ukraine that were relevant to the 
impeachment inquiry. The January 22, 
2020, article was referenced in my ques-
tion to the House managers and coun-
sel to the President during the 16-hour 
question and answer phase of the im-
peachment 
trial. 
Specifically, 
that 
question asked: ‘‘Recent reporting de-
scribed two NSC staff holdovers from 
the Obama administration attending 
an ‘all hands’ meeting of NSC staff held 
about two weeks into the Trump ad-
ministration 
and 
talking 
loudly 
enough to be overheard saying, ‘we 
need to do everything we can to take 
out the president.’ On July 26, 2019, the 
House Intelligence Committee hired 
one of those individuals, Sean Misko. 
The report further describes relation-
ships 
between 
Misko, 
Lt. 
Col. 
Vindman, and the alleged whistle-
blower. Why did your committee hire 
Sean Misko the day after the phone 
call between Presidents Trump and 
Zelensky, and what role has he played 
throughout your committee’s inves-
tigation?’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Hon. JIM JORDAN, 
Ranking Member, 
Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
Hon. DEVIN NUNES, 
Ranking Member, Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN JORDAN AND CONGRESS-
MAN NUNES: I am writing in response to the 
request of Ranking Members Nunes and Jor-
dan to provide my first-hand information 
and resulting perspective on events relevant 
to the House impeachment inquiry of Presi-
dent Trump. It is being written in the middle 
of that inquiry—after most of the deposi-
tions have been given behind closed doors, 
but before all the public hearings have been 
held. 
I view this impeachment inquiry as a con-
tinuation of a concerted, and possibly coordi-
nated, effort to sabotage the Trump adminis-
tration that probably began in earnest the 
day after the 2016 presidential election. The 
latest evidence of this comes with the re-
porting of a Jan. 30, 2017 tweet (10 days after 
Trump’s inauguration) by one of the whistle-
blower’s attorneys, Mark Zaid: ‘‘#coup has 
started. First of many steps. #rebellion. 
#impeachment will follow ultimately.’’ 
But even prior to the 2016 election, the 
FBI’s 
investigation 
and 
exoneration 
of 
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 
combined with Fusion GPS’ solicitation and 
dissemination of the Steele dossier—and the 
FBI’s 
counterintelligence 
investigation 
based on that dossier—laid the groundwork 
for future sabotage. As a result, my first- 
hand knowledge and involvement in this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S920 
February 5, 2020 
saga began with the revelation that former 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton kept a 
private e-mail server. 
I have been chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs (HSGAC) since January 2015. 
In addition to its homeland security port-
folio, the committee also is charged with 
general oversight of the federal government. 
Its legislative jurisdiction includes federal 
records. So when the full extent of Clinton’s 
use of a private server became apparent in 
March 2015, HSGAC initiated an oversight in-
vestigation. 
Although many questions remain unan-
swered from that scandal, investigations re-
sulting from it by a number of committees, 
reporters and agencies have revealed mul-
tiple facts and episodes that are similar to 
aspects of the latest effort to find grounds 
for impeachment. In particular, the political 
bias revealed in the Strzok/Page texts, use of 
the discredited Steele dossier to initiate and 
sustain the FBI’s counterintelligence inves-
tigation and FISA warrants, and leaks to the 
media that created the false narrative of 
Trump campaign collusion with Russia all 
fit a pattern and indicate a game plan that 
I suspect has been implemented once again. 
It is from this viewpoint that I report my 
specific involvement in the events related to 
Ukraine and the impeachment inquiry. 
I also am chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Europe and Regional Security Coopera-
tion of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. I have made six separate trips to 
Ukraine starting in April 2011. Most re-
cently, I led two separate Senate resolutions 
calling for a strong U.S. and NATO response 
to Russian military action against Ukraine’s 
navy in the Kerch Strait. I traveled to 
Ukraine 
to 
attend 
president-elect 
Volodymyr Zelensky’s inauguration held on 
May 20, and again on Sept. 5 with U.S. Sen. 
Chris Murphy to meet with Zelensky and 
other Ukrainian leaders. 
Following the Orange Revolution, and even 
more so after the Maidan protests, the Revo-
lution of Dignity, and Russia’s illegal annex-
ation of Crimea and invasion of eastern 
Ukraine, support for the people of Ukraine 
has been strong within Congress and in both 
the Obama and Trump administrations. 
There was also universal recognition and 
concern regarding the level of corruption 
that was endemic throughout Ukraine. In 
2015, Congress overwhelmingly authorized 
$300 
million 
of 
security 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine, of which $50 million was to be 
available only for lethal defensive weaponry. 
The Obama administration never supplied 
the authorized lethal defensive weaponry, 
but President Trump did. 
Zelensky won a strong mandate—73%— 
from the Ukrainian public to fight corrup-
tion. His inauguration date was set on very 
short notice, which made attending it a 
scheduling challenge for members of Con-
gress who wanted to go to show support. As 
a result, I was the only member of Congress 
joining the executive branch’s inaugural del-
egation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, 
Special Envoy Kurt Volker, U.S. Ambassador 
to the European Union Gordon Sondland, 
and 
Lt. 
Col. 
Alexander 
Vindman, 
rep-
resenting the National Security Council. I 
arrived the evening before the inauguration 
and, after attending a country briefing pro-
vided by U.S. embassy staff the next morn-
ing, May 20, went to the inauguration, a 
luncheon following the inauguration, and a 
delegation meeting with Zelensky and his 
advisers. 
The main purpose of my attendance was to 
demonstrate and express my support and 
that of the U.S. Congress for Zelensky and 
the people of Ukraine. In addition, the dele-
gation repeatedly stressed the importance of 
fulfilling the election mandate to fight cor-
ruption, and also discussed the priority of 
Ukraine obtaining sufficient inventories of 
gas prior to winter. 
Two specific points made during the meet-
ings stand out in my memory as being rel-
evant. 
The first occurred during the country 
briefing. I had just finished making the point 
that supporting Ukraine was essential be-
cause it was ground zero in our geopolitical 
competition with Russia. I was surprised 
when Vindman responded to my point. He 
stated that it was the position of the NSC 
that our relationship with Ukraine should be 
kept separate from our geopolitical competi-
tion with Russia. My blunt response was, 
‘‘How in the world is that even possible?’’ 
I do not know if Vindman accurately stat-
ed the NSC’s position, whether President 
Trump shared that viewpoint, or whether 
Vindman was really just expressing his own 
view. I raise this point because I believe that 
a significant number of bureaucrats and staff 
members within the executive branch have 
never accepted President Trump as legiti-
mate and resent his unorthodox style and his 
intrusion onto their ‘‘turf.’’ They react by 
leaking to the press and participating in the 
ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if 
possible, remove him from office. It is en-
tirely possible that Vindman fits this profile. 
Quotes from the transcript of Vindman’s 
opening remarks and his deposition reinforce 
this point and deserve to be highlighted. 
Vindman testified that an ‘‘alternative nar-
rative’’ pushed by the president’s personal 
attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was ‘‘inconsistent 
with the consensus views of the’’ relevant 
federal agencies and was ‘‘undermining the 
consensus policy.’’ 
Vindman’s testimony, together with other 
witnesses’ use of similar terms such as ‘‘our 
policy,’’ ‘‘stated policy,’’ and ‘‘long-standing 
policy’’ lend further credence to the point 
I’m making. Whether you agree with Presi-
dent Trump or not, it should be acknowl-
edged that the Constitution vests the power 
of conducting foreign policy with the duly 
elected president. American foreign policy is 
what the president determines it to be, not 
what the ‘‘consensus’’ of unelected foreign 
policy bureaucrats wants it to be. If any bu-
reaucrats disagree with the president, they 
should use their powers of persuasion within 
their legal chain of command to get the 
president to agree with their viewpoint. In 
the end, if they are unable to carry out the 
policy of the president, they should resign. 
They should not seek to undermine the pol-
icy by leaking to people outside their chain 
of command. 
The other noteworthy recollection involves 
how Perry conveyed the delegation concern 
over rumors that Zelensky was going to ap-
point Andriy Bohdan, the lawyer for oligarch 
Igor Kolomoisky, as his chief of staff. The 
delegation viewed Bohdan’s rumored ap-
pointment to be contrary to the goal of 
fighting corruption and maintaining U.S. 
support. Without naming ‘‘Bohdan, Sec-
retary Perry made U.S. concerns very clear 
in his remarks to Zelensky. 
Shortly thereafter, ignoring U.S. advice, 
Zelensky did appoint Bohdan as his chief of 
staff. This was not viewed as good news, but 
I gave my advice on how to publicly react in 
a text to Sondland on May 22: ‘‘Best case sce-
nario on COS: Right now Zelensky needs some-
one he can trust. I’m not a fan of lawyers, but 
they do represent all kinds of people. Maybe 
this guy is a patriot. He certainly understands 
the corruption of the oligarchs. Could be the 
perfect guy to advise Zelensky on how to deal 
with them. Zelensky knows why he got elected 
For now, I think we express our concerns, but 
give Zelensky the benefit of the doubt. Also let 
him know everyone in the U.S. will be watching 
VERY closely.’’ 
At the suggestion of Sondland, the delega-
tion (Perry, Volker, Sondland and me) pro-
posed a meeting with President Trump in the 
Oval Office. The purpose of the meeting was 
to brief the president on what we learned at 
the inauguration, and convey our impres-
sions of Zelensky and the current political 
climate in Ukraine. The delegation uni-
formly was impressed with Zelensky, under-
stood the difficult challenges he faced, and 
went into the meeting hoping to obtain 
President 
Trump’s 
strong 
support 
for 
Zelensky and the people of Ukraine. Our spe-
cific goals were to obtain a commitment 
from President Trump to invite Zelensky to 
meet in the Oval Office, to appoint a U.S. 
ambassador to Ukraine who would have 
strong bipartisan support, and to have Presi-
dent Trump publicly voice his support. 
Our Oval Office meeting took place on May 
23. The four members of the delegation sat 
lined up in front of President Trump’s desk. 
Because we were all directly facing the presi-
dent, I do not know who else was in attend-
ance sitting or standing behind us. I can’t 
speak for the others, but I was very surprised 
by President Trump’s reaction to our report 
and requests. 
He expressed strong reservations about 
supporting Ukraine. He made it crystal clear 
that he viewed Ukraine as a thoroughly cor-
rupt country both generally and, specifi-
cally, regarding rumored meddling in the 
2016 election. Volker summed up this atti-
tude in his testimony by quoting the presi-
dent as saying, ‘‘They are all corrupt. They 
are all terrible people. . . . I don’t want to 
spend any time with that.’’ I do not recall 
President Trump ever explicitly mentioning 
the names Burisma or Biden, but it was obvi-
ous he was aware of rumors that corrupt ac-
tors in Ukraine might have played a part in 
helping create the false Russia collusion nar-
rative. 
Of the four-person delegation, I was the 
only one who did not work for the president. 
As a result, I was in a better position to push 
back on the president’s viewpoint and at-
tempt to persuade him to change it. I ac-
knowledged that he was correct regarding 
endemic corruption. I said that we weren’t 
asking him to support corrupt oligarchs and 
politicians but to support the Ukrainian peo-
ple who had given Zelensky a strong man-
date to fight corruption. I also made the 
point that he and Zelensky had much in 
common. Both were complete outsiders who 
face strong resistance from entrenched inter-
ests both within and outside government. 
Zelensky would need much help in fulfilling 
his mandate, and America’s support was cru-
cial. 
It was obvious that his viewpoint and res-
ervations were strongly held, and that we 
would have a significant sales job ahead of us 
getting him to change his mind. I specifi-
cally asked him to keep his viewpoint and 
reservations private and not to express them 
publicly until he had a chance to meet 
Zelensky. He agreed to do so, but he also 
added that he wanted Zelensky to know ex-
actly how he felt about the corruption in 
Ukraine prior to any future meeting. I used 
that directive in my Sept. 5 meeting with 
Zelensky in Ukraine. 
One final point regarding the May 23 meet-
ing: I am aware that Sondland has testified 
that President Trump also directed the dele-
gation to work with Rudy Giuliani. I have no 
recollection of the president saying that dur-
ing the meeting. It is entirely possible he 
did, but because I do not work for the presi-
dent, if made, that comment simply did not 
register with me. I also remember Sondland 
staying behind to talk to the president as 
the rest of the delegation left the Oval Of-
fice. 
I continued to meet in my Senate office 
with representatives from Ukraine: on June

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S921 
February 5, 2020 
13 with members of the Ukrainian Par-
liament’s Foreign Affairs Committee; on 
July 11 with Ukraine’s ambassador to the 
U.S. and secretary of Ukraine’s National Se-
curity 
and 
Defense 
Council, 
Oleksandr 
Danyliuk; 
and 
again 
on 
July 
31 
with 
Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Valeriy 
Chaly. At no time during those meetings did 
anyone from Ukraine raise the issue of the 
withholding of military aid or express con-
cerns regarding pressure being applied by the 
president or his administration. 
During Congress’ August recess, my staff 
worked with the State Department and oth-
ers in the administration to plan a trip to 
Europe during the week of Sept. 2 with Sen-
ator Murphy to include Russia, Serbia, 
Kosovo and Ukraine. On or around Aug. 26, 
we were informed that our requests for visas 
into Russia were denied. On either Aug. 28 or 
29, I became aware of the fact that $250 mil-
lion of military aid was being withheld. This 
news would obviously impact my trip and 
discussions with Zelensky. 
Sondland had texted me on Aug. 26 re-
marking on the Russian visa denial. I replied 
on Aug. 30, apologizing for my tardy response 
and requesting a call to discuss Ukraine. We 
scheduled a call for sometime between 12:30 
p.m. and 1:30 p.m. that same day. I called 
Sondland and asked what he knew about the 
hold on military support. I did not memori-
alize the conversation in any way, and my 
memory of exactly what Sondland told me is 
far from perfect. I was hoping that his testi-
mony before the House would help jog my 
memory, but he seems to have an even fuzzi-
er recollection of that call than I do. 
The most salient point of the call involved 
Sondland describing an arrangement where, 
if Ukraine did something to demonstrate its 
serious intention to fight corruption and 
possibly help determine what involvement 
operatives in Ukraine might have had during 
the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, then 
Trump would release the hold on military 
support. 
I have stated that I winced when that ar-
rangement was described to me. I felt U.S. 
support for Ukraine was essential, particu-
larly with Zelensky’s new and inexperienced 
administration facing an aggressive Vladi-
mir Putin. I feared any sign of reduced U.S. 
support could prompt Putin to demonstrate 
even more aggression, and because I was con-
vinced Zelensky was sincere in his desire to 
fight corruption, this was no time to be 
withholding aid for any reason. It was the 
time to show maximum strength and resolve. 
I next put in a call request for National Se-
curity Adviser John Bolton, and spoke with 
him on Aug. 31. I believe he greed with my 
position on providing military assistance, 
and he suggested I speak with both the vice 
president and president. I requested calls 
with both, but was not able to schedule a 
call with Vice President Pence. President 
Trump called me that same day. 
The purpose of the call was to inform 
President Trump of my upcoming trip to 
Ukraine and to try to persuade him to au-
thorize me to tell Zelensky that the hold 
would be lifted on military aid. The presi-
dent was not prepared to lift the hold, and he 
was consistent in the reasons he cited. He re-
minded me how thoroughly corrupt Ukraine 
was and again conveyed his frustration that 
Europe doesn’t do its fair share of providing 
military aid. He specifically cited the sort of 
conversation he would have with Angela 
Merkel, chancellor of Germany. To para-
phrase President Trump: ‘‘Ron, I talk to An-
gela and ask her, ‘Why don’t you fund these 
things,’ and she tells me, ‘Because we know 
you will.’ We’re schmucks. Ron. We’re 
schmucks.’’ 
I acknowledged the corruption in Ukraine, 
and I did not dispute the fact that Europe 
could and should provide more military sup-
port. But I pointed out that Germany was 
opposed to providing Ukraine lethal defen-
sive weaponry and simply would not do so. 
As a result, if we wanted to deter Russia 
from further aggression, it was up to the 
U.S. to provide it. 
I had two additional counterarguments. 
First, I wasn’t suggesting we support the 
oligarchs and other corrupt Ukrainians. Our 
support would be for the courageous Ukrain-
ians who had overthrown Putin’s puppet, 
Viktor Yanukovich, and delivered a remark-
able 73% mandate in electing Zelensky to 
fight corruption. Second, I argued that with-
holding the support looked horrible politi-
cally in that it could be used to bolster the 
‘‘Trump is soft on Russia’’ mantra. 
It was only after he reiterated his reasons 
for not giving me the authority to tell 
Zelensky the support would be released that 
I asked him about whether there was some 
kind of arrangement where Ukraine would 
take some action and the hold would be lift-
ed. Without hesitation, President Trump im-
mediately denied such an arrangement ex-
isted. As reported in the Wall Street Jour-
nal, I quoted the president as saying, ‘‘(Ex-
pletive deleted)—No way. I would never do 
that. Who told you that?’’ I have accurately 
characterized his reaction as adamant, vehe-
ment and angry—there was more than one 
expletive that I have deleted. 
Based on his reaction, I felt more than a 
little guilty even asking him the question, 
much less telling him I heard it from 
Sondland. He seemed even more annoyed by 
that, and asked me, ‘‘Who is that guy’’? I in-
terpreted that not as a literal question—the 
president did know whom Sondland was—but 
rather as a sign that the president did not 
know him well. I replied by saying, ‘‘I 
thought he was your buddy from the real es-
tate business.’’ The president replied by say-
ing he barely knew him. 
After discussing Ukraine, we talked about 
other unrelated matters. Finally, the presi-
dent said he had to go because he had a hur-
ricane to deal with. He wrapped up the con-
versation referring back to my request to re-
lease the hold on military support for 
Ukraine by saying something like, ‘‘Ron, I 
understand your position. We’re reviewing it 
now, and you’ll probably like my final deci-
sion.’’ 
On Tuesday, Sept. 3, I had a short follow up 
call with Bolton to discuss my upcoming trip 
to Ukraine, Serbia and Kosovo. I do not re-
call discussing anything in particular that 
relates to the current impeachment inquiry 
on that call. 
We arrived in Kyiv on Sept. 4, joining Tay-
lor and Murphy for a full day of meetings on 
Sept. 5 with embassy staff, members of the 
new 
Ukrainian 
administration, 
and 
Zelensky, who was accompanied by some of 
his top advisers. We also attended the open-
ing proceedings of the Ukrainian High Anti- 
Corruption Court. The meetings reinforced 
our belief that Zelensky and his team were 
serious about fulfilling his mandate—to par-
aphrase the way he described it in his speech 
at the High Anti-Corruption Court—to not 
only fight corruption but to defeat it. 
The meeting with Zelensky started with 
him requesting we dispense with the usual 
diplomatic opening and get right to the issue 
on everyone’s mind, the hold being placed on 
military support. 
He asked if any of us knew the current sta-
tus. Because I had just spoken to President 
Trump, I fielded his question and conveyed 
the two reasons the president told me for his 
hold. I explained that I had tried to persuade 
the president to authorize me to announce 
the hold was released but that I was unsuc-
cessful. 
As much as Zelensky was concerned about 
losing the military aid, he was even more 
concerned about the signal that would send. 
I shared his concern. I suggested that in our 
public statements we first emphasize the 
universal support that the U.S. Congress has 
shown—and will continue to show—for the 
Ukrainian people. Second, we should mini-
mize the significance of the hold on military 
aid as simply a timing issue coming a few 
weeks before the end of our federal fiscal 
year. Even if President Trump and the def-
icit hawks within his administration decided 
not to obligate funding for the current fiscal 
year, Congress would make sure he had no 
option in the next fiscal year—which then 
was only a few weeks away. I also made the 
point that Murphy was on the Appropria-
tions Committee and could lead the charge 
on funding. 
Murphy made the additional point that one 
of the most valuable assets Ukraine pos-
sesses is bipartisan congressional support. 
He warned Zelensky not to respond to re-
quests from American political actors or he 
would risk losing Ukraine’s bipartisan sup-
port. I did not comment on this issue that 
Murphy raised. 
Instead, I began discussing a possible meet-
ing with President Trump. I viewed a meet-
ing between the two presidents as crucial for 
overcoming President Trump’s reservations 
and securing full U.S. support. It was at this 
point that President Trump’s May 23 direc-
tive came into play. 
I prefaced my comment to Zelensky by 
saying, ‘‘Let me go out on a limb here. Are 
you or any of your advisers aware of the in-
augural delegation’s May 23 meeting in the 
Oval Office following your inauguration?’’ 
No one admitted they were, so I pressed on. 
‘‘The reason I bring up that meeting is that 
I don’t want you caught off-guard if Presi-
dent Trump reacts to you the same way he 
reacted to the delegation’s request for sup-
port for Ukraine.’’ 
I told the group that President Trump ex-
plicitly told the delegation that he wanted 
to make sure Zelensky knew exactly how he 
felt about Ukraine before any meeting took 
place. To repeat Volker’s quote of President 
Trump: ‘‘They are all corrupt. They are all 
terrible people. . . . I don’t want to spend 
any time with that.’’ That was the general 
attitude toward Ukraine that I felt President 
Trump directed us to convey. Since I did not 
have Volker’s quote to use at the time, I 
tried to portray that strongly held attitude 
and reiterated the reasons President Trump 
consistently gave me for his reservations re-
garding Ukraine: endemic corruption and in-
adequate European support. 
I also conveyed the counterarguments I 
used (unsuccessfully) to persuade the presi-
dent to lift his hold: (1) We would be sup-
porting the people of Ukraine, not corrupt 
oligarchs, and (2) withholding military sup-
port was not politically smart. Although I 
recognized how this next point would be 
problematic, I also suggested any public 
statement Zelensky could make asking for 
greater support from Europe would probably 
be viewed favorably by President Trump. 
Finally, I commented on how excellent 
Zelensky’s English was and encouraged him 
to use English as much as possible in a fu-
ture meeting with President Trump. With a 
smile on his face, he replied, ‘‘But Senator 
Johnson, you don’t realize how beautiful my 
Ukrainian is.’’ I jokingly conceded the point 
by saying I was not able to distinguish his 
Ukrainian from his Russian. 
This was a very open, frank, and sup-
portive discussion. There was no reason for

anyone on either side not to be completely 
honest or to withhold any concerns. At no 
time during this meeting—or any other 
meeting on this trip—was there any mention 
by Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they 
were feeling pressure to do anything in re-
turn for the military aid, not even after Mur-
phy warned them about getting involved in 
the 2020 election—which would have been the 
perfect time to discuss any pressure. 
Following the meeting with Zelensky and 
his advisers, Murphy and I met with the 
Ukrainian press outside the presidential of-
fice building. Our primary message was that 
we were in Kyiv to demonstrate our strong 
bipartisan support for the people of Ukraine. 
We were very encouraged by our meetings 
with Zelensky and other members of his new 
government in their commitment to fulfill 
their electoral mandate to fight and defeat 
corruption. When the issue of military sup-
port was raised, I provided the response I 
suggested above: I described it as a timing 
issue at the end of a fiscal year and said 
that, regardless of what decision President 
Trump made on the fiscal year 2019 funding, 
I was confident Congress would restore the 
funding in fiscal year 2020. In other words: 
Don’t mistake a budget issue for a change in 
America’s strong support for the people of 
Ukraine. 
Congress came back into session on Sept. 
9. During a vote early in the week, I ap-
proached one of the co-chairs of the Senate 
Ukraine Caucus, U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin. I 
briefly described our trip to Ukraine and the 
concerns Zelensky and his advisers had over 
the hold on military support. According to 
press reports, Senator Durbin stated that 
was the first time he was made aware of the 
hold. I went on to describe how I tried to 
minimize the impact of that hold by assuring 
Ukrainians that Congress could restore the 
funding in fiscal year 2020. I encouraged Dur-
bin, as I had encouraged Murphy, to use his 
membership on the Senate Appropriations 
Committee to restore the funding. 
Also according to a press report, leading up 
to a Sept. 12 defense appropriation com-
mittee markup, Durbin offered an amend-
ment to restore funding. On Sept. 11, the ad-
ministration announced that the hold had 
been lifted. I think it is important to note 
the hold was lifted only 14 days after its ex-
istence became publicly known, and 55 days 
after the hold apparently had been placed. 
On Friday, Oct. 4, I saw news reports of 
text messages that Volker had supplied the 
House of Representatives as part of his testi-
mony. The texts discussed a possible press 
release that Zelensky might issue to help 
persuade President Trump to offer an Oval 
Office meeting. Up to that point, I had pub-
licly disclosed only the first part of my Aug. 
31 phone call with President Trump, where I 
lobbied him to release the military aid and 
he provided his consistent reasons for not 
doing so: corruption and inadequate Euro-
pean support. 
Earlier in the week, I had given a phone 
interview with Siobhan Hughes of the Wall 
Street Journal regarding my involvement 
with Ukraine. With the disclosure of the 
Volker texts, I felt it was important to go on 
the record with the next part of my Aug. 31 
call with President Trump: his denial. I had 
not previously disclosed this because I could 
not precisely recall what Sondland had told 
me on Aug. 30, and what I had conveyed to 
President Trump, regarding action Ukraine 
would take before military aid would be re-
leased. To the best of my recollection, the 
action described by Sondland on Aug. 30 in-
volved a demonstration that the new Ukrain-
ian government was serious about fighting 
corruption—something like the appointment 
of a prosecutor general with high integrity. 
I called Hughes Friday morning, Oct. 4, to 
update my interview. It was a relatively 
lengthy interview, almost 30 minutes, as I 
attempted to put a rather complex set of 
events into context. Toward the tail end of 
that interview, Hughes said, ‘‘It almost 
sounds like, the way you see it, Gordon was 
kind of freelancing and he took it upon him-
self to do something that the president 
hadn’t exactly blessed, as you see it.’’ I re-
plied, ‘‘That’s a possibility, but I don’t know 
that. Let’s face it: The president can’t have 
his fingers in everything. He can’t be stage- 
managing everything, so you have members 
of his administration trying to create good 
policy.’’ 
To my knowledge, most members of the 
administration and Congress dealing with 
the issues involving Ukraine disagreed with 
President Trump’s attitude and approach to-
ward Ukraine. Many who had the oppor-
tunity and ability to influence the president 
attempted to change his mind. I see nothing 
wrong with U.S. officials working with 
Ukrainian officials to demonstrate Ukraine’s 
commitment to reform in order to change 
President Trump’s attitude and gain his sup-
port. 
Nor is it wrong for administration staff to 
use their powers of persuasion within their 
chain of command to influence policy. What 
is wrong is for people who work for, and at 
the pleasure of, the president to believe they 
set U.S. foreign policy instead of the duly 
elected president doing so. It also would be 
wrong for those individuals to step outside 
their chain of command—or established 
whistleblower procedures—to undermine the 
president’s policy. If those working for the 
president don’t feel they can implement the 
president’s policies in good conscience, they 
should follow Gen. James Mattis’ example 
and resign. If they choose to do so, they can 
then take their disagreements to the public. 
That would be the proper and high-integrity 
course of action. 
This impeachment effort has done a great 
deal of damage to our democracy. The re-
lease of transcripts of discussions between 
the president of the United States and an-
other world leader sets a terrible precedent 
that will deter and limit candid conversa-
tions between the president and world lead-
ers from now on. The weakening of executive 
privilege will also limit the extent to which 
presidential advisers will feel comfortable 
providing ‘‘out of the box’’ and other frank 
counsel in the future. 
In my role as chairman of the Senate’s pri-
mary oversight committee, I strongly be-
lieve in and support whistleblower protec-
tions. But in that role, I am also aware that 
not all whistleblowers are created equal. Not 
every whistleblower has purely altruistic 
motives. Some have personal axes to grind 
against a superior or co-workers. Others 
might have a political ax to grind. 
The 
Intelligence 
Community 
Inspector 
General acknowledges the whistleblower in 
this instance exhibits some measure of ‘‘an 
arguable political bias.’’ The whistleblower’ 
s selection of attorney Mark Zaid lends cre-
dence to the ICIG’s assessment, given Zaid’s 
tweet that mentions coup, rebellion and im-
peachment only 10 days after Trump’s inau-
guration. 
If the whistleblower’s intention was to im-
prove and solidify the relationship between 
the U.S. and Ukraine, he or she failed miser-
ably. Instead, the result has been to pub-
licize and highlight the president’s deeply 
held reservations toward Ukraine that the 
whistleblower felt were so damaging to our 
relationship with Ukraine and to U.S. na-
tional security. The dispute over policy was 
being resolved between the two branches of 
government before the whistleblower com-
plaint was made public. All the complaint 
has accomplished is to fuel the House’s im-
peachment desire (which I believe was the 
real motivation), and damage our democracy 
as described above. 
America faces enormous challenges at 
home and abroad. My oversight efforts have 
persuaded me there has been a concerted ef-
fort, probably beginning the day after the 
November 2016 election, to sabotage and un-
dermine President Trump and his adminis-
tration. President Trump, his supporters, 
and the American public have a legitimate 
and understandable desire to know if wrong-
doing occurred directed toward influencing 
the 2016 election or sabotaging Trump’s ad-
ministration. The American public also has a 
right to know if no wrongdoing occurred. 
The sooner we get answers to the many un-
answered questions, the sooner we can at-
tempt to heal our severely divided nation 
and turn our attention to the many daunting 
challenges America faces. 
Sincerely, 
RON JOHNSON, 
United States Senator. 
[From RealClearInvestigations, Jan. 22, 2019] 
WHISTLEBLOWER WAS OVERHEARD IN ’17 DIS-
CUSSING WITH ALLY HOW TO REMOVE TRUMP 
(By Paul Sperry) 
Barely two weeks after Donald Trump took 
office, Eric Ciaramella—the CIA analyst 
whose name was recently linked in a tweet 
by the president and mentioned by law-
makers as the anonymous ‘‘whistleblower’’ 
who touched off Trump’s impeachment—was 
overheard in the White House discussing 
with another staffer how to remove the 
newly elected president from office, accord-
ing to former colleagues. 
Sources told RealClearInvestigations the 
staffer with whom Ciaramella was speaking 
was Sean Misko. Both were Obama adminis-
tration holdovers working in the Trump 
White House on foreign policy and national 
security issues. And both expressed anger 
over Trump’s new ‘‘America First’’ foreign 
policy, a sea change from President Obama’s 
approach to international affairs. 
‘‘Just days after he was sworn in they were 
already talking about trying to get rid of 
him,’’ said a White House colleague who 
overheard their conversation. 
‘‘They weren’t just bent on subverting his 
agenda,’’ the former official added. ‘‘They 
were plotting to actually have him removed 
from office.’’ 
Misko left the White House last summer to 
join House impeachment manager Adam 
Schiff’s committee, where sources say he of-
fered ‘‘guidance’’ to the whistleblower, who 
has been officially identified only as an in-
telligence officer in a complaint against 
Trump filed under whistleblower laws. Misko 
then helped run the impeachment inquiry 
based on that complaint as a top investi-
gator for congressional Democrats. 
The probe culminated in Trump’s impeach-
ment last month on a party-line vote in the 
House of Representatives. Schiff and other 
House Democrats last week delivered the ar-
ticles of impeachment to the Senate, and are 
now pressing the case for his removal during 
the trial, which began Tuesday. 
The coordination between the official be-
lieved to be the whistleblower and a key 
Democratic staffer, details of which are dis-
closed here for the first time, undercuts the 
narrative that impeachment developed spon-
taneously out of the ‘‘patriotism’’ of an 
‘‘apolitical civil servant.’’ 
Two former co-workers said they over-
heard Ciaramella and Misko, dose friends 
and Democrats held over from the Obama ad-
ministration, discussing how to ‘‘take out,’’ 
or remove, the new president from office 
within days of Trump’s inauguration. These 
co-workers said the president’s controversial 
Ukraine phone call in July 2019 provided the

pretext they and their Democratic allies had 
been looking for. 
‘‘They didn’t like his policies,’’ another 
former White House official said. ‘‘They had 
a political vendetta against him from Day 
One.’’ 
Their efforts were part of a larger pattern 
of coordination to build a case for impeach-
ment, involving Democratic leaders as well 
as anti-Trump figures both inside and out-
side of government. 
All unnamed sources for this article spoke 
only on condition that they not be further 
identified or described. Although strong evi-
dence points to Ciaramella as the govern-
ment employee who lodged the whistle-
blower complaint, he has not been officially 
identified as such. As a result, this article 
makes a distinction between public informa-
tion released about the unnamed whistle-
blower/CIA analyst and specific information 
about Ciaramella. 
Democrats based their impeachment case 
on the whistleblower complaint, which al-
leges that President Trump sought to help 
his re-election campaign by demanding that 
Ukraine’s leader investigate former Vice 
President Joe Biden and his son Hunter in 
exchange for military aid. Yet Schiff, who 
heads the House Intelligence Committee, and 
other Democrats have insisted on keeping 
the identity of the whistleblower secret, cit-
ing concern for his safety, while arguing that 
his testimony no longer matters because 
other witnesses and documents have ‘‘cor-
roborated’’ what he alleged in his complaint 
about the Ukraine call. 
Republicans have fought unsuccessfully to 
call him as a witness, arguing that his moti-
vations and associations are relevant—and 
that the president has the same due-process 
right to confront his accuser as any other 
American. 
The whistleblower’s candor is also being 
called into question. It turns out that the 
CIA operative failed to report his contacts 
with Schiff’s office to the intelligence com-
munity’s inspector general who fielded his 
whistleblower complaint. He withheld the in-
formation both in interviews with the in-
spector general, Michael Atkinson, and in 
writing, according to impeachment com-
mittee 
investigators. 
The 
whistleblower 
form he filled out required him to disclose 
whether he had ‘‘contacted other entities’’— 
including ‘‘members of Congress.’’ But he 
left that section blank on the disclosure 
form he signed. 
The investigators say that details about 
how 
the 
whistleblower 
consulted 
with 
Schiff’s staff and perhaps misled Atkinson 
about those interactions are contained in the 
transcript of a closed-door briefing Atkinson 
gave to the House Intelligence Committee 
last October. However, Schiff has sealed the 
transcript from public view. It is the only 
impeachment witness transcript out of 18 
that he has not released. 
Schiff has classified the document ‘‘Se-
cret,’’ preventing Republicans who attended 
the Atkinson briefing from quoting from it. 
Even 
impeachment 
investigators 
cannot 
view it outside a highly secured room, 
known as a ‘‘SCIF,’’ in the basement of the 
Capitol. Members must first get permission 
from Schiff, and they are forbidden from 
bringing phones into the SCIF or from tak-
ing notes from the document. 
While the identity of the whistleblower re-
mains 
unconfirmed, 
at 
least 
officially, 
Trump recently retweeted a message naming 
Ciaramella, while Republican Sen. Rand 
Paul and Rep. Louie Gohmert of the House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
have 
publicly 
de-
manded that Ciaramella testify about his 
role in the whistleblower complaint. 
During last year’s closed-door House depo-
sitions 
of 
impeachment 
witnesses, 
Ciaramella’s name was invoked in heated 
discussions about the whistleblower, as 
RealClearInvestigations first reported Oct. 
30, and has appeared in at least one testi-
mony transcript. Congressional Republicans 
complain Schiff and his staff counsel have 
redacted his name from other documents. 
Lawyers representing the whistleblower 
have neither confirmed nor denied that 
Ciaramella is their client. In November, 
after Donald Trump Jr. named Ciaramella 
and cited RCI’s story in a series of tweets, 
however, they sent a ‘‘cease and desist’’ let-
ter to the White House demanding Trump 
and his ‘‘surrogates’’ stop ‘‘attacking’’ him. 
And just as the whistleblower complaint was 
made public in September, Ciaramella’s so-
cial 
media 
postings 
and 
profiles 
were 
scrubbed from the Internet. 
‘TAKE OUT’ THE PRESIDENT 
An Obama holdover and registered Demo-
crat, Ciaramella in early 2017 expressed hos-
tility toward the newly elected president 
during White House meetings, his co-workers 
said in interviews with RealClearInvesti-
gations. They added that Ciaramella sought 
to have Trump removed from office long be-
fore the filing of the whistleblower com-
plaint. 
At the time, the CIA operative worked on 
loan to the White House as a top Ukrainian 
analyst in the National Security Council, 
where he had previously served as an adviser 
on Ukraine to Vice President Biden. The 
whistleblower complaint cites Biden, alleg-
ing that Trump demanded Ukraine’s newly 
elected leader investigate him and his son 
‘‘to help the president’s 2020 reelection bid.’’ 
Two NSC co-workers told RCI that they 
overheard Ciaramella and Misko—who was 
also working at the NSC as an analyst— 
making anti-Trump remarks to each other 
while attending a staff-wide NSC meeting 
called by then-National Security Adviser Mi-
chael Flynn, where they sat together in the 
south auditorium of the Eisenhower Execu-
tive Office Building, part of the White House 
complex. 
The ‘‘all hands’’ meeting, held about two 
weeks into the new administration, was at-
tended by hundreds of NSC employees. 
‘‘They were popping off about how they 
were going to remove Trump from office. No 
joke,’’ said one ex-colleague, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity to discuss sen-
sitive matters. 
A military staffer detailed to the NSC, who 
was seated directly in front of Ciaramella 
and Misko during the meeting, confirmed 
hearing them talk about toppling Trump 
during their private conversation, which the 
source said lasted about one minute. The 
crowd was preparing to get up to leave the 
room at the time. 
‘‘After Flynn briefed [the staff] about what 
‘America 
first’ 
foreign 
policy 
means, 
Ciaramella turned to Misko and commented, 
’We need to take him out,’ ’’ the staffer re-
called. ‘‘And Misko replied, ‘Yeah, we need 
to do everything we can to take out the 
president.’ ’’ 
Added the military detailee, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity: ‘‘By ‘taking him 
out,’ they meant removing him from office 
by any means necessary. They were trig-
gered by Trump’s and Flynn’s vision for the 
world. This was the first ‘all hands’ [staff 
meeting] where they got to see Trump’s na-
tional security team, and they were huffing 
and puffing throughout the briefing any time 
Flynn said something they didn’t like about 
‘America First.’ ’’ 
He said he also overheard Ciaramella tell-
ing Misko, referring to Trump, ‘We can’t let 
him enact this foreign policy.’ ’’ 
Alarmed by their conversation, the mili-
tary staffer immediately reported what he 
heard to his superiors. 
‘‘It was so shocking that they were so bla-
tant and outspoken about their opinion,’’ he 
recalled. ‘‘They weren’t shouting it, but they 
didn’t seem to feel the need to hide it.’’ 
The co-workers didn’t think much more 
about the incident. 
‘‘We just thought they were wacky,’’ the 
first source said. ‘‘Little did we know.’’ 
Neither Ciaramella nor Misko could be 
reached for comment. 
A CIA alumnus, Misko had previously as-
sisted Biden’s top national security aide 
Jake Sullivan. Former NSC staffers said 
Misko was Ciaramella’s closest and most 
trusted ally in the Trump White House. 
‘‘Eric and Sean were very tight and spent 
nearly two years together at the NSC,’’ said 
a former supervisor who requested anonym-
ity. ‘‘Both of them were paranoid about 
Trump.’’ 
‘‘They were thick as thieves,’’ added the 
first NSC source. ‘‘They sat next to each 
other and complained about Trump all the 
time. They were buddies. They weren’t just 
colleagues. They were buddies outside the 
White House.’’ 
The February 2017 incident wasn’t the only 
time the pair exhibited open hostility toward 
the president. During the following months, 
both were accused internally of leaking neg-
ative information about Trump to the media. 
But Trump’s controversial call to the new 
president of Ukraine this past summer—in 
which he asked the foreign leader for help 
with domestic investigations involving the 
Obama administration, including Biden— 
gave them the opening they were looking 
for. 
A mutual ally in the National Security 
Council who was one of the White House offi-
cials authorized to listen in on Trump’s July 
25 conversation with Ukraine’s president 
leaked it to Ciaramella the next day—July 
26—according to former NSC co-workers and 
congressional sources. The friend, Ukraine- 
born Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, held 
Ciaramella’s old position at the NSC as di-
rector for Ukraine. Although Ciaramella had 
left the White House to return to the CIA in 
mid-2017, the two officials continued to col-
laborate through interagency meetings. 
Vindman 
leaked 
what 
he’d 
heard 
to 
Ciaramella by phone that afternoon, the 
sources said. In their conversation, which 
lasted a few minutes, he described Trump’s 
call as ‘‘crazy,’’ and speculated he had ‘‘com-
mitted a criminal act.’’ Neither reviewed the 
transcript of the call before the White House 
released it months later. 
NSC co-workers said that Vindman, like 
Ciaramella, openly expressed his disdain for 
Trump whose foreign policy was often at 
odds with the recommendations of ‘‘the 
interagency’’—a network of agency working 
groups comprised of intelligence bureau-
crats, experts and diplomats who regularly 
meet to craft and coordinate policy positions 
inside the federal government. 
Before he was detailed to the White House, 
Vindman served in the U.S. Army, where he 
once received a reprimand from a superior 
officer for badmouthing and ridiculing Amer-
ica in front of Russian soldiers his unit was 
training with during a joint 2012 exercise in 
Germany. 
His commanding officer, Army Lt. Col. Jim 
Hickman, complained that Vindman, then a 
major, ‘‘was apologetic of American culture, 
laughed about Americans not being educated 
or worldly and really talked up Obama and 
globalism to the point of [It being] uncom-
fortable.’’ 
‘‘Vindman was a partisan Democrat at 
least as far back as 2012,’’ Hickman, now re-
tired, asserted. ‘‘Do not let the uniform fool 
you. He is a political activist in uniform.’’ 
Attempts to reach Vindman through his 
lawyer were unsuccessful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S924 
February 5, 2020 
July 26 was also the day that Schiff hired 
Misko to head up the investigation of 
Trump, congressional employment records 
show. Misko, in turn, secretly huddled with 
the whistleblower prior to filing his Aug. 12 
complaint, according to multiple congres-
sional sources, and shared what he told him 
with Schiff, who initially denied the con-
tacts before press accounts revealed them. 
Schiff’s office has also denied helping the 
whistleblower prepare his complaint, while 
rejecting a Republican subpoena for docu-
ments relating to it. But Capitol Hill vet-
erans and federal whistleblower experts are 
suspicious of that account. 
Fred Fleitz, who fielded a number of whis-
tleblower complaints from the intelligence 
community as a former senior House Intel-
ligence Committee staff member, said it was 
obvious that the CIA analyst had received 
coaching in writing the nine-page whistle-
blower report. 
‘‘From my experience, such an extremely 
polished whistleblowing complaint is un-
heard of,’’ Fleitz, also a former CIA analyst, 
said. ‘‘He appears to have collaborated in 
drafting his complaint with partisan House 
Intelligence Committee members and staff.’’ 
Fleitz, who recently served as chief of staff 
to former National Security Adviser John 
Bolton, said the complaint appears to have 
been tailored to buttress an impeachment 
charge of soliciting the ‘‘interference’’ of a 
foreign government in the election. 
And the whistleblower’s unsupported alle-
gation became the foundation for Democrats’ 
first article of impeachment against the 
president. It even adopts the language used 
by the CIA analyst in his complaint, which 
Fleitz said reads more like ‘‘a political docu-
ment.’’ 
OUTSIDE HELP 
After providing the outlines of his com-
plaint to Schiff’s staff, the CIA analyst was 
referred to whistleblower attorney Andrew 
Bakaj by a mutual friend ‘‘who is an attor-
ney and expert in national security law,’’ ac-
cording to the Washington Post, which did 
not identify the go-between. 
A former CIA officer, Bakaj had worked 
with Ciaramella at the spy agency. They 
have even more in common: like the 33-year- 
old Ciaramella, the 37-year-old Bakaj is a 
Connecticut native who has spent time in 
Ukraine. He’s also contributed money to 
Biden’s presidential campaign and once 
worked for former Sen. Hillary Clinton. He’s 
also briefed the intelligence panel Schiff 
chairs. 
Bakaj brought in another whistleblower 
lawyer, Mark Zaid, to help on the case. A 
Democratic donor and a politically active 
anti-Trump advocate, Zaid was willing to 
help represent the CIA analyst. On Jan. 30, 
2017, around the same time former colleagues 
say they overheard Ciaramella and Misko 
conspiring to take Trump out, Zaid tweeted 
that a ‘‘coup has started’’ and that ‘‘im-
peachment will follow ultimately.’’ 
Neither Bakaj nor Zaid responded to re-
quests for an interview. 
It’s not clear who the mutual friend and 
national security attorney was whom the an-
alyst turned to for additional help after 
meeting with Schiff’s staff. But people famil-
iar with the matter say that former Justice 
Department national security lawyer David 
Laufman involved himself early on in the 
whistleblower case. 
Also a former CIA officer, Laufman was 
promoted by the Obama administration to 
run counterintelligence cases, including the 
high-profile investigations of Clinton’s clas-
sified emails and the Trump campaign’s al-
leged ties to Russia. Laufman sat in on Clin-
ton’s July 2016 FBI interview. He also signed 
off on the wiretapping of a Trump campaign 
adviser, which the Department of Justice in-
spector general determined was conducted 
under false pretenses involving doctored 
emails, suppression of exculpatory evidence, 
and other malfeasance. Laufman’s office was 
implicated in a report detailing the surveil-
lance misconduct. 
Laufman could not be reached for com-
ment. 
Laufman and Zaid are old friends who have 
worked together on legal matters in the 
past. ‘‘I would not hesitate to join forces 
with him on complicated cases,’’ Zaid said of 
Laufman in a recommendation posted on his 
LinkedIn page. 
Laufman recently defended Zaid on Twit-
ter after Trump blasted Zaid for advocating 
a ‘‘coup’’ against him. ‘‘These attacks on 
Mark Zaid’s patriotism are baseless, irre-
sponsible and dangerous,’’ Laufman tweeted. 
‘‘Mark is an ardent advocate for his clients.’’ 
After the CIA analyst was coached on how 
to file a complaint under Intelligence Com-
munity whistleblower protections, he was 
steered to another Obama holdover—former 
Justice Department attorney-turned-inspec-
tor general Michael Atkinson, who facili-
tated the processing of his complaint, de-
spite numerous red flags raised by career 
Justice Department lawyers who reviewed it. 
The department’s Office of Legal Counsel 
that the complaint involved ‘‘foreign diplo-
macy,’’ not intelligence, contained ‘‘hear-
say’’ evidence based on ‘‘secondhand’’ infor-
mation, and did not meet the definition of an 
‘‘urgent concern’’ that needed to be reported 
to Congress. Still, Atkinson worked closely 
with Schiff to pressure the White House to 
make the complaint public. 
Fleitz said cloaking the CIA analyst in the 
whistleblower statute provided him cover 
from public scrutiny. By making him anony-
mous, he was able to hide his background 
and motives. Filing the complaint with the 
IC inspector general, moreover, gave him 
added protections against reprisals, while 
letting him disclose classified information. If 
he had filed directly with Congress, it could 
not have made the complaint public due to 
classified concerns. But a complaint referred 
by the IG to Congress gave it more latitude 
over what it could make public. 
OMITTED CONTACTS WITH SCHIFF 
The whistleblower complaint was publicly 
released Sept. 26 after a barrage of letters 
and a subpoena from Schiff, along with a 
flood of leaks to the media. 
However, the whistleblower did not dis-
close to Atkinson that he had briefed Schiff’s 
office about his complaint before filing it 
with the inspector general. He was required 
on forms to list any other agencies he had 
contacted, including Congress. But he omit-
ted those contacts and other material facts 
from his disclosure. He also appears to have 
misled Atkinson on Aug. 12, when on a sepa-
rate form he stated: ‘‘I reserve the option to 
exercise my legal right to contact the com-
mittees directly,’’ when he had already con-
tacted Schiff’s committee weeks prior to 
making the statement. 
‘‘The whistleblower made statements to 
the inspector general under the penalty of 
perjury that were not true or correct,’’ said 
Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Republican member of 
the House Intelligence Committee. 
Ratcliffe said Atkinson appeared uncon-
cerned after the New York Times revealed in 
early October that Schiff’s office had pri-
vately consulted with the CIA analyst before 
he filed his complaint, contradicting Schiff’s 
initial 
denials. 
Ratcliffe 
told 
RealClearlnvestigations that in closed door 
testimony on Oct. 4, ‘‘I asked IG Atkinson 
about his ‘investigation’ into the contacts 
between Schiff’s staff and the person who 
later became the whistleblower.’’ But he said 
Atkinson claimed that he had not inves-
tigated them because he had only just 
learned about them in the media. 
On Oct. 8, after more media reports re-
vealed the whistle blower and Schiff’s staff 
had concealed their contacts with each 
other, the whistleblower called Atkinson’s 
office to try to explain why he made false 
statements in writing and verbally, trans-
gressions that could be punishable with a 
fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up five 
years, or both, according to the federal form 
he signed under penalty of perjury. 
In his clarification to the inspector gen-
eral, the whistleblower acknowledged for the 
first time reaching out to Schiff’s staff be-
fore filing the complaint, according to an in-
vestigative report filed later that month by 
Atkinson. 
‘‘The whistleblower got caught,’’ Ratcliffe 
said. ‘‘The whistleblower made false state-
ments. The whistleblower got caught with 
Chairman Schiff.’’ 
He says the truth about what happened is 
documented on pages 53–73 of the transcript 
of Atkinson’s eight-hour testimony. Except 
that Schiff refuses to release it. 
‘‘The transcript is classified ‘Secret’ so 
Schiff can prevent you from seeing the an-
swers to my questions,’’ Ratcliffe told RCI. 
Atkinson replaced Charles McCullough as 
the 
intelligence 
community’s 
IG. 
McCullough is now a partner in the same law 
firm for which Bakaj and Zaid work. 
McCullough formerly reported directly to 
Obama’s 
National 
Intelligence 
Director, 
James Clapper, one of Trump’s biggest crit-
ics in the intelligence community and a reg-
ular agitator for his impeachment on CNN. 
HIDDEN POLITICAL AGENDA? 
Atkinson also repeatedly refused to answer 
Senate Intelligence Committee questions 
about the political bias of the whistleblower. 
Republican members of the panel called his 
Sept. 26 testimony ‘‘evasive.’’ Senate inves-
tigators say they are seeking all records gen-
erated from Atkinson’s ‘‘preliminary re-
view’’ of the whistleblower’s complaint, in-
cluding evidence and ‘‘indicia’’ of the whis-
tleblower’s ‘‘political bias’’ in favor of Biden. 
Republicans point out that Atkinson was 
the top national security lawyer in the 
Obama Justice Department when it was in-
vestigating 
Trump 
campaign 
aides 
and 
Trump himself in 2016 and 2017. He worked 
closely with Laufman, the department’s 
former 
counterintelligence 
section 
chief 
who’s now aligned with the whistleblower’s 
attorneys. Also, Atkinson served as senior 
counsel to Mary McCord, the senior Justice 
official appointed by Obama who helped 
oversee the FBI’s Russia ‘‘collusion’’ probe, 
and who personally pressured the White 
House to fire then National Security Adviser 
Flynn. She and Atkinson worked together on 
the Russia case. Closing the circle tighter, 
McCord was Laufman’s boss at Justice. 
As it happens, all three are now involved in 
the whistleblower case or the impeachment 
process. 
After leaving the department, McCord 
joined the stable of attorneys Democrats re-
cruited last year to help impeach Trump. 
She is listed as a top outside counsel for the 
House in key legal battles tied to impeach-
ment, including trying to convince federal 
judges to unblock White House witnesses and 
documents. 
‘‘Michael Atkinson is a key anti-Trump 
conspirator who played a central role in 
transforming the ‘whistleblower’ complaint 
into the current impeachment proceedings,’’ 
said Bill Marshall, a senior investigator for 
Judicial Watch, the conservative govern-
ment watchdog group that is suing the Jus-
tice Department for Atkinson’s internal 
communications regarding impeachment.

Atkinson’s office declined comment. 
ANOTHER ‘CO-CONSPIRATOR’? 
During closed-door depositions taken in 
the impeachment inquiry, Ciaramella’s con-
federate Misko was observed handing notes 
to Schiff’s lead counsel for the impeachment 
inquiry, Daniel Goldman—another Obama 
Justice attorney and a major Democratic 
donor—as he asked questions of Trump ad-
ministration witnesses, officials with direct 
knowledge of the proceedings told RealClear 
Investigations. Misko also was observed sit-
ting on the dais behind Democratic members 
during last month’s publicly broadcast joint 
impeachment committee hearings. 
Another Schiff recruit believed to part of 
the clandestine political operation against 
Trump is Abby Grace, who also worked 
closely with Ciaramella at the NSC, both be-
fore and after Trump was elected. During the 
Obama administration, Grace was an assist-
ant to Obama national security aide Ben 
Rhodes. 
Last February, Schiff recruited this other 
White House friend of the whistleblower to 
work as an impeachment investigator. Grace 
is listed alongside Sean Misko as senior 
staffers in the House Intelligence Commit-
tee’s ‘‘The Trump-Ukraine Impeachment In-
quiry Report’’ published last month. 
Republican 
Rep. 
Louie 
Gohmert, 
who 
served on one of the House impeachment 
panels, singled out Grace and Misko as 
Ciaramella’s ‘‘co-conspirators’’ in a recent 
House floor speech arguing for their testi-
mony.‘‘These people are at the heart of ev-
erything about this whole Ukrainian hoax,’’ 
Gohmert said. ‘‘We need to be able to talk to 
these people.’’ 
A Schiff spokesman dismissed Gohmert’s 
allegation. 
‘‘These allegations about our dedicated and 
professional staff members are patently false 
and are based off false smears from a con-
gressional staffer with a personal vendetta 
from a previous job,’’ said Patrick Boland, 
spokesman for the House Intelligence Com-
mittee. ‘‘It’s shocking that members of Con-
gress would repeat them and other false con-
spiracy theories, rather than focusing on the 
facts of the president’s misconduct.’’ 
Boland declined to identify ‘‘the congres-
sional staffer with a personal vendetta.’’ 
Schiff has maintained in open hearings and 
interviews that he did not personally speak 
with the whistleblower and still does not 
even know his identity, which would mean 
the intelligence panel’s senior staff has with-
held his name from their chairman for al-
most six months. Still, he insists that he 
knows that the CIA analyst has ‘‘acted in 
good faith,’’ as well as ‘‘appropriately and 
lawfully.’’ 
The CIA declined comment. But the agency 
reportedly has taken security measures to 
protect the analyst, who has continued to 
work on issues relating to Russia and 
Ukraine 
and 
participate 
in 
interagency 
meetings. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to have a state-
ment I prepared concerning the im-
peachment trial be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL—STATEMENT 
FOR THE RECORD 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF DONALD JOHN TRUMP 
The case for impeachment presented by the 
House managers is overwhelming. Donald 
Trump held taxpayer-funded military aid 
hostage from an ally at war while demanding 
a personal, political favor. He tried to cheat, 
got caught, and worked hard to cover it up. 
His actions constitute a shocking, corrupt 
abuse of power and betrayal of his oath of of-
fice. Just as a sheriff cannot delay respond-
ing to calls for help until the callers endorse 
his re-election, the President is not entitled 
to withhold vital military assistance from a 
foreign ally until they announce an inves-
tigation to smear his political rival. The 
proof shows precisely the type of corruption 
that the Framers sought to prevent through 
the Impeachment Clause, including foreign 
interference in our election. 
Two further points are significant. First, 
the President is guilty of the crime of brib-
ery, which is specifically listed in the Con-
stitution as a grounds for impeachment.1 
Second, the President’s unprecedented cam-
paign to obstruct the impeachment inquiry 
compels us to conclude that the evidence he 
is hiding would provide further proof of his 
guilt. 
I. The President committed the federal crime of 
bribery 
There is no question—based on the original 
meaning of the Constitution, the elaboration 
of the impeachment clause in the Federalist 
Papers, historical precedent, and common 
sense—that the President need not violate a 
provision of any criminal code in order to 
warrant removal from office.2
The Presi-
dent’s argument that he must violate ‘‘es-
tablished law’’ to be impeached would be 
laughable if its implications were not so dan-
gerous. 
But there is no reasonable doubt that the 
President has violated established law. The 
Constitution specifically states that a Presi-
dent who commits bribery should be im-
peached.3 The evidence before us establishes 
that President Trump has committed the 
crime of bribery as it existed at the time of 
the framers and now. Therefore, even using 
the President’s own standard, the Senate has 
no choice but to convict. 
The evidence shows that the President so-
licited interference in the 2020 election for 
his own benefit by pressuring Ukraine to an-
nounce an investigation into his political op-
ponents in return for releasing nearly $400 
million in taxpayer-funded military aid 
Ukraine desperately needed, as well as a 
meeting with President Zelensky at the 
White House. He sought, indeed demanded, a 
personal benefit in exchange for an official 
act. 
Section 201 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code 
criminalizes ‘‘bribery of public officials and 
witnesses.’’ A public official is guilty under 
this section when they seek ‘‘anything of 
value’’ in exchange for any ‘‘official act’’ and 
do so with corrupt intent. The code even 
specifies that punishment for this crime may 
include disqualification ‘‘from holding any 
office of honor, trust, or profit under the 
United States.’’ 4 
A. The requested investigations constitute 
‘‘things of value’’ 
The investigations that President Trump 
requested into his political enemies and to 
undermine 
claims 
that 
Russia 
illegally 
helped him get elected are clearly ‘‘things of 
value.’’ 5 By all accounts, he was obsessed 
with them. According to multiple reports, 
Trump cared more about the investigations 
than he did about defending Ukraine from 
Russia. Ambassador Gordon Sondland even 
testified that the President ‘‘doesn’t give a 
s**t’’ about Ukraine and only cares about 
‘‘big stuff’’ like the announcement of the in-
vestigations he requested.6 
Courts have consistently applied a broad 
and subjective understanding of the phrase 
‘‘anything of value.’’ All that matters is that 
the bribe had value in the eyes of the official 
accepting or soliciting it. The Second Circuit 
has determined that ‘‘anything of value’’ in-
cludes stock that, although it had no com-
mercial value at the time, had subjective 
value to the defendant.7 Similarly, the Sixth 
Circuit held that loans that a public official 
would have been otherwise unable to receive 
were ‘‘thing[s] of value.’’ 8 The Eighth Cir-
cuit has similarly emphasized that ‘‘any-
thing of value’’ should be interpreted ‘‘broad-
ly’’ and ‘‘subjectively.’’ 9 
Further, the ‘‘thing’’ need not be tangible, 
and it need not be immediately available. 
For example, the Sixth Circuit held that a 
promise of ‘‘future employment’’ is a thing 
of value.10 A D.C. district court found that 
travel and entrance to various events that 
Tyson Foods gave to the Agriculture Sec-
retary’s girlfriend counted as things of 
value, despite the fact that they were not 
given directly to the Secretary and were not 
tangible items.11
Campaign contributions 
also count as ‘‘things of value,’’ even con-
tributions made to Super PACs, despite Su-
preme Court precedent holding that inde-
pendent expenditures do not have sufficient 
value to candidates to justify placing limits 
on them.12 In other contexts, the courts have 
interpreted the phrase ‘‘thing of value’’ to 
encompass a tip about the whereabouts of a 
witness,13 information about government in-
formants,14 and the testimony of a govern-
ment witness.15 The courts have roundly re-
jected the proposition that this phrase ‘‘cov-
ers only things having commercial value;’’ 
intangibles, including information itself, can 
certainly be a ‘‘thing of value.’’ 16 The rel-
evant inquiry is not the objective value of 
the thing offered, but ‘‘whether the donee 
placed any value on the intangible gifts.’’ 17 
Here, President Trump clearly placed 
value on the announcement of investiga-
tions. During the July 25 phone call, Trump 
stated that it was ‘‘very important’’ that 
Zelensky open these investigations.18 Over 
several months, Trump and Rudy Giuliani 
had made repeated public statements about 
how important they thought the investiga-
tions were. Since at least April, 2017, Presi-
dent Trump has been publicly promoting the 
debunked conspiracy theory that a Cali-
fornia-based 
cybersecurity 
company, 
CrowdStrike, worked with the Democratic 
National Committee to fabricate evidence 
that Russia interfered in the 2016 election 
and hide the proof of their actions in 
Ukraine. Rudy Giuliani, the President’s per-
sonal attorney, has been promoting a con-
spiracy theory about Joe and Hunter Biden 
since at least January, 2019.19 Days after 
Zelensky was elected, Trump stated on air 
that he would be directing Attorney General 
Barr to ‘‘look into’’ the CrowdStrike con-
spiracy theory.20 In May, 2019, Rudy Giuliani, 
with the knowledge and consent of President 
Trump and acting on the President’s be-
half,21 planned to travel to Ukraine to ask 
for these investigations, which he said would 
be ‘‘very, very helpful to my client, and may 
turn out to be helpful to my government.’’ 22 
On July 10, top Ukrainian officials met with 
Energy Secretary Perry, John Bolton, Kurt 
Volker, and Ambassador Sondland at the 
White House where Sondland made clear 
that an official White House visit with 
Zelensky was important to the President.23 
Further, the electoral value to President 
Trump of investigations that would smear 
Joe Biden and the DNC while casting doubt 
on Russian interference in the 2016 election 
is obvious. President Trump was elected in a 
shocking and narrow victory after polls 
showed him trailing his opponent until offi-
cials announced that she was under inves-
tigation.24 The announcement of an inves-
tigation into his political opponents clearly 
had tremendous value to him personally. 
The President’s counsels claim that Trump 
demanded investigations of his political 
rival as part of a perfectly legitimate anti-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S926 
February 5, 2020 
corruption effort. In short, they want the 
Senate to leave our common sense at the 
door. At least four undisputed facts deci-
sively disprove the claim that President 
Trump’s actions were motivated by the pub-
lic interest and not his own. 
First, as one of my colleagues has put it,25 
it ‘‘strains credulity’’ to suggest that Presi-
dent Trump was pursuing the public interest 
and not his political benefit when the only 
corruption investigations he could think to 
demand involved his political opponents.26 
President Trump’s counsel have claimed 
throughout this trial that the President be-
lieved corruption in Ukraine to be wide-
spread. Yet he did not suggest a single inves-
tigation or programmatic action other than 
the two investigations of his political rivals. 
Second, President Trump did not actually 
want Ukraine to conduct the investigations 
he only wanted Zelensky to announce them.27 
If he really did want to get to the bottom of 
a legitimate concern, a public announcement 
of the investigation would not further that 
interest. Any good investigator knows that, 
if you actually want to get to the truth, you 
do not prematurely tip off the subject of the 
investigation. Indeed, federal prosecutors are 
instructed to not even ‘‘respond to questions 
about the existence of an ongoing investiga-
tion or comment on its nature or progress 
before charges are publicly filed.’’ 28 While 
announcing the investigations could only 
harm any legitimate law enforcement objec-
tive, it would obviously benefit President 
Trump’s political goals. 
Third, President Trump never sought the 
investigations 
through 
ordinary, 
official 
channels, or if he did seek them the Justice 
Department declined to pursue them. If 
President Trump wanted bona fide investiga-
tions, as opposed to politically-motivated 
announcements, he would have charged the 
Department of Justice with conducting an 
official investigation, and the Department 
would have sought cooperation from the 
Ukrainian government through the U.S.- 
Ukraine Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty 
(MLAT). Legitimate requests made pursuant 
to an MLAT allow DOJ to take testimony, 
obtain records, locate persons, serve docu-
ments, transfer persons into U.S. custody, 
execute searches and seizures, freeze assets, 
and engage in any other lawful actions that 
the state can take.29 Trump claims that he 
just wanted to root out criminality and cor-
ruption. But he did not ask domestic U.S. 
law enforcement to look into the matter; to 
date, there is no criminal investigation of 
Hunter Biden. Instead, Trump tried to coerce 
a foreign government to investigate a U.S. cit-
izen without any formal coordination with 
the U.S. Justice Department. In other words, 
there was not a sufficient basis for a bona 
fide, domestic criminal investigation, so 
Trump had to go elsewhere. The fact that 
Trump asked a foreign government to inves-
tigate Hunter Biden is not evidence that he 
cared about corruption; it is evidence that he 
was engaged in corruption. 
In fact, Ukraine ultimately resisted Presi-
dent Trump’s requests for investigations pre-
cisely because the President had failed to 
rely on the usual channels used to prevent 
political 
interference 
with 
law 
enforce-
ment.30 If Trump actually wanted a legiti-
mate investigation, and wanted to ensure 
that DOJ would be privy to relevant infor-
mation, he would have sought formal assist-
ance through the U.S.-Ukraine MLAT. DOJ 
has confirmed that he did no such thing.31 
Instead, President Trump acted through his 
personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a man who 
made clear that he was duty bound to pursue 
his boss’s personal interests and not those of 
the public.32 The only reasonable explanation 
for the President’s decision to completely 
bypass the Justice Department is that he 
knew that his conspiracy theories could not 
withstand scrutiny and he set out to cir-
cumvent law enforcement officials. They 
were solely intended to serve Trump’s per-
sonal, political interests. 
Finally, as the American Intelligence Com-
munity has unanimously concluded,33
the 
CrowdStrike conspiracy is not supported by 
any evidence. It is difficult to fathom how 
propagating Russian-generated propaganda 
that implicates American public figures and 
companies is in the national interest of the 
United States. Even if his motives were 
mixed, and he cared peripherally about cor-
ruption generally, his predominant goal was 
to smear a political opponent. 
B. The release of the hold on military aid 
and the promised White House visit con-
stitute ‘‘official acts’’ 
The two acts the President agreed to per-
form—releasing the hold on military aid and 
setting up an official White House meeting 
with Zelensky—constitute ‘‘official acts.’’ 
The bribery statute defines ‘‘official act’’ 
broadly to include ‘‘any decision or action on 
any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding 
or controversy, which may at any time be 
pending, or which may by law be brought be-
fore any public official, in such official’s offi-
cial capacity, or in such official’s place of 
trust or profit.’’ 34 Military assistance and an 
official White House visit were within his 
control only because of his tenure in elective 
office. In fact, both receiving foreign dig-
nitaries and providing foreign assistance are 
in the President’s official, constitutional job 
description.35 
Actions authorized by statute, such as the 
ones President Trump took here, are particu-
larly clear examples of official acts.36 Con-
gress has specifically authorized, and cir-
cumscribed, the President’s ability to award 
military assistance to foreign countries. 
This process has been codified since the early 
1960s, and there is an enormous federal appa-
ratus devoted to evaluating the needs of for-
eign nations, how those needs intersect with 
legitimate U.S. foreign policy interests, and 
how to award foreign aid in line with those 
interests.37
Further, when the President 
placed a hold on the aid, he was acting on be-
half of the United States, not in his personal 
capacity. It defies reason to argue that the 
President’s decision to award, or fail to exe-
cute, a foreign aid determination is not an 
‘‘official act’’ under the bribery statute. 
Similarly, an official White House meeting 
is an ‘‘official act’’ because the President is 
specifically ‘‘assigned by law’’ 38—in both the 
Constitution and numerous statutes—with 
receiving representatives from foreign gov-
ernments.39 Indeed, the authority to receive 
ambassadors and recognize foreign govern-
ments is considered so core to the office of 
the President that the Supreme Court has 
struck down statutes that interfere with it.40 
C. The President corruptly sought a quid pro 
quo 
President Trump made an agreement with 
the specific intent to be influenced in his de-
cision whether to lift the hold on the mili-
tary aid and to host a White House meeting. 
In United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of 
California, the Supreme Court held that a 
bribe made or solicited ‘‘in return for’’ an of-
ficial act entails an exchange, a quid pro 
quo.41 In a seminal case, the D.C. Circuit rea-
soned that the term ‘‘corruptly’’ means that 
the official act would not be undertaken (or 
undertaken in a particular way) without the 
thing of value.42 
Department of Justice guidance on the 
issue, citing the standard jury instructions 
that numerous courts have upheld, indicates 
that ‘‘corruptly’’ denotes ‘‘nothing more 
than . . . acting ‘with bad purpose’ to 
achieve some unlawful end.’’ 43 The guidance 
further explains that, ordinarily, this ‘‘bad 
purpose’’ is ‘‘a hope or expectation of either 
financial gain or other benefit to one’s self, 
or some aid or profit or benefit to an-
other.’’44 In other words, the intent merely 
to be influenced in the way prohibited by the 
bribery statute itself is sufficient to find 
that the defendant acted ‘‘corruptly.’’ 
Further, the Supreme Court unanimously 
held in 2016 that the quid pro quo demand 
‘‘need not be explicit,’’ the official ‘‘need not 
specify the means that he will use to perform 
his end of the bargain,’’ nor must the official 
actually intend to follow through for a pros-
ecutor to succeed in making her case that 
the defendant is guilty of bribery.45 In a Sev-
enth Circuit case, the court made clear that 
the context of a communication can be de-
terminative: evidence of a quid pro quo can 
emerge from ‘‘the often clandestine atmos-
phere of corruption with a simple wink and 
a nod if the surrounding circumstances make 
it clear that something of value will pass to 
a public official if he takes improper, or 
withholds proper, action.’’ 46 While the de-
fendant in that case never made an explicit 
offer and never relayed a specific amount of 
money, the court nonetheless upheld his con-
viction for bribery.47 
Trump’s actions clearly qualify as a quid 
pro quo. Less than a month prior to this 
phone call, President Trump had put a hold 
on hundreds of millions of dollars in military 
aid to Ukraine and had previously set in mo-
tion, but not committed to, an official White 
House visit with Ukraine’s new president, 
Volodomyr 
Zelensky. 
When 
Trump 
and 
Zelensky spoke on July 25, Trump set the 
terms of the conversation by making clear 
that he felt Ukraine owed him for America’s 
generosity. And as soon as Zelensky men-
tioned that Ukraine was interested in receiv-
ing American anti-tank missiles, the Presi-
dent immediately stated that he would like 
Zelensky to ‘‘do us a favor though,’’ and ex-
plicitly asked Zelensky to investigate the 
Biden conspiracy theory and alleged Ukrain-
ian interference in the 2016 election. As soon 
as Zelensky appeared to agree to open the re-
quested investigations, Trump almost imme-
diately assured the Ukrainian President that 
‘‘whenever you would like to come to the 
White House, feel free to call.’’ 48 Text mes-
sages sent by Special Envoy Volker indicate 
that it had also been made clear to the 
Ukrainians prior to the call that the official 
White House visit was also conditioned upon 
Zelensky complying with Trump’s request 
for these investigations.49 Gordon Sondland, 
the American ambassador to the EU, testi-
fied that the President’s proposal to lift the 
hold in exchange for the investigations was 
as clear as ‘‘two plus two equals four.’’ 50 
Trump’s 
acting 
Chief 
of 
Staff, 
Mick 
Mulvaney, confessed during a press con-
ference that there was a quid pro quo ex-
change and suggested that the public should 
just ‘‘get over it.’’ 51 
The implication of Trump’s message to 
Zelensky on the July 25 phone call is that 
Trump would not lift the hold or have the 
White 
House 
meeting 
unless 
Zelensky 
opened the requested investigations. The ob-
vious political value to the President of 
opening these investigations constitutes suf-
ficient grounds for a jury to determine that 
he had a ‘‘bad motive’’ in making this re-
quest. Trump is guilty of quid pro quo brib-
ery. 
D. Trump’s defenses are not persuasive 
Trump attempts to absolve his behavior by 
arguing that his subjective intent is irrele-
vant to whether he committed an impeach-
able offense, that there is no quid pro quo be-
cause Ukraine never announced the infamous 
investigations, and that, even if he did com-
mit a quid pro quo, he cannot be impeached

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S927 
February 5, 2020 
because the articles do not accuse him of 
bribery. Even setting aside that these de-
fenses ignore the fact that Trump still has 
not held a White House meeting with 
Zelensky, 
these 
arguments 
are 
wholly 
unpersuasive in their own right. 
1. Trump’s subjective intent is eminently 
relevant 
Trump claims that his subjective intent is 
irrelevant; that he cannot be impeached 
based on the reasons for which he sought the 
investigations.52 This argument is specious 
for at least three reasons. First, the two of-
fenses that the Constitution explicitly men-
tions as requiring removal from office—trea-
son and bribery—hinge on the subjective rea-
sons that the official acted. If the Com-
mander-in-Chief orders the military to take 
certain actions with the purpose of bene-
fiting an enemy of the United States, then 
the President has committed treason, even if 
the President generally has the authority to 
command the armed forces. If the President 
vetoes a law because someone has paid him a 
large bribe, then he has committed bribery, 
even if the President generally has the au-
thority to veto laws. When we are prohibited 
from scrutinizing the President’s reasons for 
acting, we lose the ability to protect our de-
mocracy from tyrants and traitors. 
Second, the President maintains that he 
needs to have violated ‘‘established law’’ in 
order to be impeached.53 Using the Presi-
dent’s own standard, then, in evaluating 
whether he violated the federal bribery stat-
ute, we must evaluate whether he acted with 
corrupt intent. If the President wants to be 
scrutinized using the standards of the federal 
criminal code, then he must concede that his 
subjective intent is at issue. 
Third, even if Trump had other reasons for 
releasing the aid, it was still a crime for him 
to even ask for the investigations. Section 
201(c) of Title 18 prohibits public officials 
from demanding anything of value ‘‘for or 
because of any official act.’’ 54 The courts 
have been clear that even if the official act 
‘‘might have been done without’’ the bribe, 
the defendant is still guilty under section 
201(c).55 Even if Trump never actually in-
tended to maintain a hold on the aid, even if 
he decided to release the aid for entirely le-
gitimate reasons, the fact that he requested 
the investigations as a ‘‘favor’’ 56—because of 
how generous the President was in agreeing 
to conduct a White House visit or lifting the 
hold on the military aid—means that the 
President committed a crime. 
Even if a legislator would have voted for a 
piece of legislation because he thinks it is in 
the public interest, he still commits bribery 
if he takes a payoff to do it. As the courts 
have made clear, an illegal bribe under this 
section may take the form of ‘‘a reward 
[. . .] for a past act that has already been 
taken.’’ 57 Thus, the fact that the President 
continued to ask for the investigations after 
the hold was finally released 58 does not ab-
solve him; it further incriminates him. 
2. Trump completed his crime the moment 
he solicited the bribe 
It is undisputed that the President, either 
directly or indirectly, demanded investiga-
tions into Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory 
involving the Democratic National Com-
mittee. The President’s only response is that 
he cannot be liable because he did not re-
ceive what he requested. Under federal law, 
however, a corrupt official need not receive 
the benefit he demands or perform the offi-
cial acts in question; ‘‘it is enough that the 
official agreed to do so.’’ 59 It is the solicita-
tion of a private benefit in and of itself that 
constitutes the crime.60
All a prosecutor 
would have to demonstrate is that the Presi-
dent made an agreement or offer to exchange 
official acts for a thing of value. 
We know from the memorandum of the 
July 
25 
phone 
call, 
from 
Volker 
and 
Sondland’s texts, and from Sondland’s testi-
mony that Trump had agreed to lift the hold 
and conduct the White House meeting in ex-
change for the investigations.61
We also 
know that there is additional evidence out 
there that speaks to the President’s commu-
nications—both directly and through his 
agents—with Ukraine regarding his illegal 
scheme. We know, at the very least, of the 
existence of diplomatic cables from the 
Ukrainian embassy about the hold on the 
military 
assistance 
and 
communications 
with the State Department about the hold.62 
The head of the agency that placed the hold 
on the military assistance has refused to re-
spond to a lawful subpoena, under the in-
struction of the White House.63 As discussed 
below, when a party fails to produce or ob-
structs access to relevant evidence, that fail-
ure ‘‘gives rise to an inference that the evi-
dence is unfavorable to him.’’ 64 In this case, 
although the evidence already presented 
proves the crime of bribery, the Senate 
should infer that the evidence that the exec-
utive branch has hidden about these commu-
nications would provide further evidence 
that Trump agreed to this illicit exchange. 
3. Senators must convict if they conclude 
that the President committed the crime of 
bribery, whether or not the term ‘bribery’ 
appears in the articles 
The first article of impeachment accuses 
the President of ‘‘corruptly solicit[ing]’’ the 
public announcement of investigations that 
were in his ‘‘personal political benefit,’’ in 
exchange for ‘‘two official acts.’’ 65 In re-
sponse to questions from Senators, Trump’s 
counsel has argued that because the article 
did not explicitly refer to the crime of brib-
ery, Trump was provided inadequate notice. 
This argument is absurd. 
Trump has received plenty of notice that 
he stands accused of bribery. Trump’s ac-
tions, as described in the article, clearly 
align with the elements of the federal crime 
of bribery: he solicited a thing of value in ex-
change for official acts and did so with cor-
rupt intent.66 Further, the House Judiciary 
Committee report adeptly explained why the 
President is guilty of bribery under the 
criminal code.67 Lawmakers have been dis-
cussing the President’s misdeeds in terms of 
bribery for months now.68 His lack of a de-
fense is due not to lack of notice but to lack 
of facts. 
The historical record confirms the com-
mon sense notion that the articles need not 
name specific crimes. In 1974, the House Ju-
diciary Committee approved three articles of 
impeachment against President Nixon, none 
of which referenced any provisions of any 
criminal code.69 Many of my colleagues were 
presented with similarly drafted articles of 
impeachment against Judge Porteous in 2010. 
In that instance, the House adopted four ar-
ticles of impeachment, none of which explic-
itly referenced the criminal code.70 The first 
article described conduct that amounts to 
bribery—claiming that Judge Porteous ‘‘so-
licited and accepted things of value’’ in ex-
change for ruling in favor of a particular 
party—but never used the term ‘‘bribe’’ or 
mentioned the federal bribery statute.71 The 
Senate 
unanimously 
convicted 
Judge 
Porteous on this article and voted to forever 
disqualify him from holding office.72 No one 
seriously entertained the notice argument 
then, and there is no good reason to do so 
now. This bad faith defense is a red herring, 
and we must not let it distract us from the 
issue before us: the President’s crimes. 
Trump’s claim that he cannot be removed 
for a crime unless the crime is specifically 
mentioned in the articles of impeachment— 
coupled with his claim that there must be 
proof of a crime—is simply untenable. By 
Trump’s flawed logic, if he had been im-
peached for ‘‘shooting someone on Fifth Ave-
nue,’’ he could not be removed for ‘‘murder’’ 
unless that word was specifically included in 
the articles. We have not been called to sit in 
judgment of the House of Representatives’ 
diction; we sit in judgment of the President’s 
actions—carefully and precisely described in 
the articles of impeachment as a clear-cut 
case of bribery. 
II. The President’s unprecedented campaign to 
obstruct access to relevant evidence compels 
us to conclude that the evidence is against 
him. 
The House of Representatives has made a 
very strong case that the President’s refusal 
to engage in any way with their investiga-
tion is unlawful and constitutionally offen-
sive. But make no mistake—this conflict is 
more than a dispute between the branches of 
government. The House of Representatives 
and a number of Senators have raised the 
alarm bells not for our own sake, but be-
cause when the President hides from Con-
gress, he hides from the American people. 
The separation of powers does not exist to 
benefit members of Congress; it exists to 
curb the excesses of enormously powerful 
government officials. 
Throughout this entire ordeal—from the 
moment the call transcript was improperly 
placed on a classified server 73 to the time 
when Trump threatened to unlawfully assert 
executive privilege over any testimony re-
quested by the Senate 74—the President has 
sought to keep his illegal scheme secret from 
the very people the scheme was designed to 
manipulate: the American electorate. 
Indeed, the withholding of aid itself was 
concealed, unlike with other similar pauses 
or suspensions of military assistance. 
The law and historical precedent are 
clear—when the President stifles Congress’ 
investigative authority, whether during an 
impeachment inquiry or when Congress is 
exercising its broader mandate to inves-
tigate the executive branch, he has exceeded 
the bounds of the law. Because Trump has 
flouted congressional inquiry in such a bra-
zen and unhinged manner, this violation 
alone requires us to vote to remove him from 
office. 
Separately, this egregious campaign of ob-
fuscation strengthens the case against the 
President for abuse of power. As a matter of 
law, when a party to a case improperly with-
holds relevant evidence, courts can instruct 
juries to make an adverse inference—to as-
sume that the evidence would be unfavorable 
to the withholding party. In this case, 
Trump has withheld every single piece of evi-
dence that the House requested. The facts be-
fore us confirm the underlying logic of the 
adverse inference rule—that when a party 
hides something, it is because they have 
something to hide. Applying that rule here, 
the already overwhelming evidence against 
Trump becomes an avalanche. 
A. Trump’s obstruction requires us to infer 
that all the evidence is against him, which 
only strengthens the case for removal for 
abuse of power 
It is a long-established rule of law that 
when a party ‘‘has relevant evidence within 
his control which he fails to produce, that 
failure gives rise to an inference that the 
evidence is unfavorable to him.’’ 75 Impor-
tantly, this rule applies even in the absence 
of a subpoena and, in fact, ‘‘the willingness 
of a party to defy a subpoena in order to sup-
press the evidence strengthens the force of the 
preexisting inference,’’ because in that sce-
nario ‘‘it can hardly be doubted he has some 
good reason for his insistence on suppres-
sion.’’ 76 Indeed, the courts have recognized 
that the adverse inference rule is essential to

prevent intransigent parties from abusing 
‘‘costly and time consuming’’ court pro-
ceedings to subvert their legal duty to 
produce relevant evidence.77 The Supreme 
Court has specifically applied this rule 
against a party who selectively provided 
weak evidence and failed to allow those per-
sons with the most relevant knowledge to 
testify, noting that ‘‘the production of weak 
evidence when strong is available can lead 
only to the conclusion that the strong would 
have been adverse.’’ 78 As the Court put it, in 
circumstances like this, ‘‘silence then be-
comes evidence of the most convincing char-
acter.’’ 79 
We know that the Trump administration 
has relevant evidence that it refuses to 
produce. As an initial matter, the President 
has failed to comply with a single request 
from the House of Representatives, and, fol-
lowing the President’s orders, the White 
House, the office of the Vice President, the 
Office of Management and Budget, the State 
Department, the Department of Defense, and 
the Department of Energy refused to produce 
a single document in response to 71 specific 
requests issued by the House of Representa-
tives.80 
But we also know of specific pieces of evi-
dence that go to the heart of the House’s 
case and that Trump is concealing. Mark 
Sandy testified that in August, OMB pro-
duced a memorandum recommending that 
the President’s hold on the Ukraine military 
assistance be released.81 William Taylor tes-
tified that on August 29, he sent a first per-
son cable to Secretary Pompeo, relaying his 
concerns about the ‘‘folly I saw in with-
holding military aid to Ukraine at a time 
when hostilities were still active in the east 
and when Russia was watching closely to 
gauge the level of American support for the 
Ukrainian Government.’’ 82 Mr. Taylor also 
testified that he had exchanged WhatsApp 
messages with Ambassadors Volker and 
Sondland as well as with Ukrainian officials. 
The White House has refused to release any 
of these documents. We therefore must infer 
that they demonstrate that there was no 
interagency process to review the best use of 
the funds—that this rationale was pre-tex-
tual. 
The White House maintains that Ukraine 
was not even aware of the hold on the mili-
tary assistance until after it was reported on 
publicly. But we have testimony to the con-
trary—testimony that includes reference to 
specific documents that the President is 
withholding. Laura K. Cooper, the American 
deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, testified that 
her staff received two emails on July 25th 
that directly undermine Trump’s claim. The 
first, received at 2:31 PM, stated that the 
Ukrainian embassy was asking about the se-
curity assistance. The second, received at 
4:25 PM, stated that the Ukrainian embassy 
knew that the foreign military financing as-
sistance had been held up.83 At the behest of 
President Trump, the State Department has 
not released these emails. Unless and until 
the administration produces these docu-
ments and any others bearing on when 
Ukraine first learned about the hold, we 
should assume that they demonstrate that 
Ukraine knew about the hold when Trump 
spoke to Zelensky on July 25. 
B. THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS EMERGED DESPITE 
TRUMP’S
INTRANSIGENCE
HAS
ONLY
BOL-
STERED THE CASE AGAINST HIM 
Based on the above analysis alone, the 
Senate is more than entitled to infer that 
the mountain of evidence that Trump is 
withholding would demonstrate his guilt. 
But two further points compel us to make 
such an inference. First, Trump confessed on 
national television to having ‘‘all the mate-
rials’’ and bragged about how he had kept 
them from Congress.84 We cannot let this 
gleeful boast stand without inferring that 
the materials in question speak to Trump’s 
guilt. 
Second, as the House managers repeatedly 
cautioned us would happen, the evidence 
that Trump has been hiding has started to 
come out. And each newly revealed tape or 
record has been unfavorable to the Presi-
dent’s case. The assumption that the law 
compels us to make about the contents of 
these materials—that they demonstrate the 
President’s guilt—is confirmed each and 
every time they come out into the light. 
Most damning has been the leak of a draft of 
John Bolton’s forthcoming book, which con-
firms that the President ‘‘told his national 
security adviser in August that he wanted to 
continue freezing $391 million in security as-
sistance to Ukraine until officials there 
helped with investigations into Democrats 
including the Bidens,’’ as well as details 
about the involvement of various senior cab-
inet officials in Trump’s illegal scheme.85 
And this is only the most recent revelation 
in a rapidly growing series of records that 
have come to light. On January 14, 2020, Lev 
Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, 
released documents which demonstrate both 
that the President was orchestrating a deal 
to get Zelensky to ‘‘announce that the Biden 
case will be investigated,’’ and that Marie 
Yovanovitch was the subject of an illegal in-
timidation campaign.86 On January 25, 2020, 
a tape from April, 2018 was publicly released 
of a private dinner with top donors where 
Trump is heard yelling: ‘‘Get rid of her! Get 
her out tomorrow. I don’t care. Get her out 
tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,’’ in 
reference to Ambassador Yovanovitch.87 The 
President is also heard specifically asking 
how long Ukraine would last in a war against 
Russia absent U.S. support—in other words, 
inquiring how much Ukraine is at the mercy 
of the United States.88 Not only does this 
tape provide further evidence of a coordi-
nated campaign against the Ambassador; it 
also undermines ‘‘earlier defenses by the 
White House that Trump wasn’t aware of 
what was taking place in the early phase of 
the Ukraine affair.’’ 89
This tape suggests 
that Trump not only knew about the 
Ukraine affair, but also that ‘‘he may have 
been directing events’’ as early as April 
2018.90 
The steady drip of damning evidence leak-
ing from the President’s associates, com-
bined with Trump’s own public confession to 
concealing relevant evidence, compels us to 
conclude what the law already instructs us 
to infer: that the mountain of evidence 
Trump is hiding proves his guilt. 
Conclusion 
It is clear to me that Trump is guilty of 
bribery and that his campaign to obstruct 
any investigation into his wrongdoing only 
strengthens the case against him. Trump’s 
actions require us to vote to remove him 
from office. When the Framers included the 
impeachment power in the Constitution, 
they knew that there would be a presidential 
election every four years—and they also 
knew that this was an insufficient check 
against a President who abuses the power of 
his office to cheat his way to re-election. 
Trump’s misdeeds are a case study in the 
need for impeachment. 
Throughout the impeachment trial, I have 
been moved by the grave moral purpose that 
the Senate is charged with pursuing—of sus-
taining America as an idea, of our Constitu-
tion as a living document that gives sub-
stance to our identity as the world’s leading 
democracy. As we sit in judgment of a Presi-
dent who has demonstrated nothing but con-
tempt for our laws and our values, history 
sits in judgment of the Senate. By failing to 
remove Trump from office, we will have 
failed our country.

equal force to Trump’s demand that Ukraine

38. McDonnell v. U.S., 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373. 
The meetings that the Court considered in 
McDonnell are not comparable. Nowhere in 
Virginia’s constitution or statutes is the 
governor tasked with arranging meetings, 
hosting parties, or engaging in unofficial 
conversations with other government offi-
cials. The Court took issue with a jury in-
struction which stated that an official act 
need not have been taken ‘‘pursuant to re-
sponsibilities explicitly assigned by law,’’ 
whereas the President’s actions here clearly 
are assigned by law. 
39. See U.S. Const. art. II § 2 (The President 
‘‘shall receive ambassadors and other public 
ministers’’); Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2086

Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, when I 
was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate, 
I swore an oath to support and defend 
the Constitution of the United States. 
Every U.S. Senator takes the same 
oath. The Constitution makes clear 
that no one is above the law, not even 
the President of the United States. 
Over the past 2 weeks, the Senate has 
heard overwhelming evidence showing 
that the President of the United 
States, Donald J. Trump, abused the 
power of his office to pressure the 
President of Ukraine to dig up dirt on 
a political rival to help President 
Trump in the next election. The Presi-
dent then executed an unprecedented 
campaign to cover up his actions, in-
cluding a wholesale obstruction of 
Congress’s effort to investigate his 
abuse of power. 
The Constitution gives the Senate 
the sole power to conduct impeach-
ment trials. A fair trial is one in which 
Senators are allowed to see and hear 
all of the relevant information needed 
to evaluate the Articles of Impeach-
ment, including relevant witnesses and 
documents. The American people ex-
pected and deserved a fair trial, but 
that is not what they got. Instead of 
engaging in a pursuit for the truth, 
Senate Republicans locked arms with 
the President and refused to subpoena 
a single witness or document. They 
even refused to allow the testimony of 
the President’s former National Secu-
rity Advisor, John Bolton, who pos-
sesses direct evidence related to the 
issues at the heart of the trial, even as 
more evidence continued to come to 
light and as Bolton repeatedly volun-
teered to share what he knows. 
This trial boils down to one word: 
corruption—the corruption of a Presi-
dent who has repeatedly put his inter-
ests ahead of the interests of the Amer-
ican people and violated the Constitu-
tion in the process; the corruption of 
this President’s political appointees, 
including individuals like U.S. Ambas-
sador to the European Union Gordon 
Sondland, who paid $1 million for an 
ambassadorship; the corruption run-
ning throughout our government that 
protects and defends the interests of 
the wealthy and powerful to the det-
riment of everyone else. 
Americans have a right to hear and 
see information that further exposes 
the gravity of the President’s actions 
and the unprecedented steps he and his 
agents took to hide it from the Amer-
ican people. But more importantly, 
Americans deserve to know that the 
President of the United States is using 
the power of his office to work in the 
Nation’s interest, not his own personal 
interest. 
I voted to convict and to remove the 
President from office in order to stand 
up to the corruption that has per-
meated this administration and that 
was on full display with President 
Trump’s abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. I will continue to call 
out this corruption and fight to make 
this government work not just for the 
wealthy and well-connected but to 
make it work for everyone.

S931 
February 5, 2020 
both as an officer in the U.S. Navy Re-
serve and as a U.S. Senator. 
At the beginning of the impeachment 
trial, I swore an oath to keep an open 
mind, listen carefully to the facts, and 
in the end deliver impartial justice. 
After carefully listening to the argu-
ments presented by both House man-
agers and the President’s lawyers, I be-
lieve the facts are clear. 
President Trump stands accused by 
the House of Representatives of abus-
ing his power in an attempt to extort a 
foreign government to announce a 
trumped up investigation into a polit-
ical rival and thereby put his personal 
interest ahead of national security and 
the public trust. 
The President illegally withheld con-
gressionally approved military aid to 
an ally at war with Russia and condi-
tioned its release on Ukraine making 
an announcement the President could 
use to falsely discredit a likely polit-
ical opponent. 
When the President’s corrupt plan 
was brought to light, the White House 
engaged in a systematic and unprece-
dented effort to cover up the scheme. 
The President’s complete refusal to 
cooperate with a constitutionally au-
thorized investigation is unparalleled 
in American history. 
Despite the extraordinary efforts by 
the President to cover up the facts, the 
House managers made a convincing 
case. 
It is clear. 
The President’s actions were not an 
effort to further official American for-
eign policy. 
The President was not working in the 
public interest. 
What the President did was wrong, 
unacceptable, and impeachable. 
I expected the President’s lawyers to 
offer new eyewitness testimony from 
people with firsthand knowledge and 
offer new documents to defend the 
President, but that did not happen. 
It became very clear to me that the 
President’s closest advisers could not 
speak to the President’s innocence, and 
his lawyers did everything in their 
power to prevent them from testifying 
under oath. 
Witness testimony is the essence of a 
fair trial. It is what makes us a coun-
try committed to the rule of law. 
If you are accused of wrongdoing in 
America, you have every right to call 
witnesses in your defense, but you also 
don’t have the right to stop the pros-
ecution from calling a hostile witness 
or subpoenaing documents. 
No one in this country is above the 
law—no one—not even the President. 
If someone is accused of a crime and 
they have witnesses who could clear 
them of any wrongdoing, they would 
want those witnesses to testify. In fact, 
not only would they welcome it, they 
would insist on it. 
All we need to do is use our common 
sense. The fact that the President re-
fuses to have his closest advisers tes-
tify tells me that he is afraid of what 
they will say. 
The President’s conduct is unaccept-
able for any official, let alone the lead-
er of our country. 
Our Nation’s Founders feared un-
checked and unlimited power by the 
President. They rebelled against an 
abusive monarch with unlimited power 
and instead created a republic that dis-
tributed 
power 
across 
different 
branches of government. 
They were careful students of his-
tory; they knew unchecked power 
would destroy a democratic republic. 
They were especially fearful of an un-
checked 
Executive 
and 
specifically 
granted Congress the power of im-
peachment to check a President who 
thought of themselves as above the 
law. 
Two years ago, I had the privilege of 
participating in an annual bipartisan 
Senate 
tradition 
reading 
President 
George Washington’s farewell address 
on the Senate floor. 
In that address, President Wash-
ington warned that unchecked power, 
the rise of partisan factions, and for-
eign influence, if left unchecked, would 
undermine our young Nation and allow 
for the rise of a demagogue. 
He warned that we could become so 
divided and so entrenched in the beliefs 
of our particular partisan group that 
‘‘cunning, ambitious and unprincipled 
men will be enabled to subvert the 
power of the people and to usurp for 
themselves the reins of government.’’ 
I am struck by the contrast of where 
we are today and where our Founders 
were more than 200 years ago. 
George Washington was the ultimate 
rock star of his time. He was beloved, 
and when he announced he would leave 
the Presidency and return to Mount 
Vernon, people begged him to stay. 
There was a call to make him a King, 
and he said no. He reminded folks that 
he had just fought against a monarch 
so that the American people could 
enjoy the liberties of a free people. 
George Washington, a man of integ-
rity and an American hero, refused to 
be anointed King when it was offered to 
him by his adoring countrymen. He 
chose a republic over a monarchy. 
But tomorrow, by refusing to hold 
President Trump accountable for his 
abuses, Republicans in the Senate are 
offering him unbridled power without 
accountability, and he will gleefully 
seize that power. 
And when he does, our Republic will 
face an existential threat. 
A vote against the Articles of Im-
peachment will set a dangerous prece-
dent and will be used by future Presi-
dents to act with impunity. 
Given what we know, that the Presi-
dent abused the power of his office by 
attempting to extort a foreign govern-
ment to interfere with an American 
election, that he willfully obstructed 
justice at every turn, and that his ac-
tions run counter to our Nation’s most 
cherished and fundamental values, it is 
clear the President betrayed the trust 
the American public placed in him to 
fully execute his constitutional respon-
sibilities. 
This betrayal is by definition a high 
crime and misdemeanor. If it does not 
rise to the level of impeachment and 
removal, I am not sure what would. 
The Senate has a constitutional re-
sponsibility to hold him accountable. 
If we do not stand up and defend our 
democracy during this fragile period, 
we will be allowing this President and 
future Presidents to have unchecked 
power. 
This is not what our Founders in-
tended. The oath I swore to protect and 
defend the Constitution demands that I 
vote to preserve the future of our Re-
public. I will faithfully execute my 
oath and vote to hold this President 
accountable for his actions. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I will 
soon join a majority of the Senate in 
voting down the Articles of Impeach-
ment brought against the President by 
his partisan opponents. The time has 
come to end a spectacle that has ele-
vated the obsessions of Washington’s 
political class over the concerns and 
interests of the American people. 
This round of impeachment is just 
the latest Democratic scheme to bring 
down the President. I say ‘‘this round’’ 
because House Democrats have tried to 
impeach President Trump at least four 
times—first, for being mean to football 
players; then for his transgender mili-
tary policy; next for his immigration 
policy. And those are just the impeach-
ment attempts. Along the way, Demo-
crats also proclaimed that Robert 
Mueller would drive the President from 
office. Some even speculated that the 
Vice President and the Cabinet would 
invoke the 25th amendment to seize 
power from the President—a theory 
that sounds more like resistance fan 
fiction than reality. 
What is behind this fanaticism? Sim-
ply put, the Democrats have never ac-
cepted that Donald Trump won the 2016 
election, and they will never forgive 
him, either. 
It is time for the Democrats to get 
some perspective. They are claiming 
that we ought to impeach and remove 
a President from office for the first 
time in our history for briefly pausing 
aid to Ukraine and rescheduling a 
meeting with the Ukrainian President, 
allegedly in return for a corruption in-
quiry. But the aid was released after a 
few weeks and the meeting occurred, 
yet the inquiry did not—even though, I 
would add, it remains justified by the 
Biden family’s obvious, glaring conflict 
of interest in Ukraine. 
Just how badly have the Democrats 
lost perspective? The House managers 
have argued that we ought to impeach 
and remove the President because his 
meeting with the Ukrainian President 
happened in New York, not Wash-
ington. 
When most Americans think about 
why a President ought to be impeached 
and removed from office for the first 
time in our history, I suspect that 
pausing aid to Ukraine for a few weeks 
is pretty far down the list. That is not 
exactly ‘‘treason, bribery, or other

high crimes and misdemeanors.’’ And 
that is especially true when we are just 
months away from the election that 
will let Americans make their own 
choice. Indeed, Americans are already 
voting to select the President’s Demo-
cratic challenger. Why not let the vot-
ers decide whether the President ought 
to be removed? 
The Democrats’ real answer is that 
they are afraid they will lose again in 
2020, so they designed impeachment to 
hurt the President before the election. 
As one Democratic congressman said 
last year, ‘‘I’m concerned that if we 
don’t impeach this president, he will 
get reelected.’’ Or, as minority leader 
CHUCK SCHUMER claimed earlier this 
month, impeachment is a ‘‘win-win’’ 
for Democrats; either it will lead to the 
President’s defeat or it will hurt 
enough Republican Senators in tough 
races to hand Democrats the majority. 
Or maybe both. 
The political purpose of impeach-
ment was clear from the manner in 
which 
House 
Democrats 
conducted 
their proceedings. If impeachment was 
indeed the high-minded, somber affair 
that Speaker NANCY PELOSI claimed, 
House Democrats would have taken 
their time to get all the facts from all 
relevant witnesses. Instead, they bar-
reled ahead with a slipshod and secre-
tive process, denying the President’s 
due-process 
rights, gathering testi-
mony behind closed doors, leaking 
their findings selectively to the press, 
and ignoring constitutional concerns 
such as executive privilege. 
The impeachment vote itself contra-
dicted the pretensions of House Demo-
crats. Speaker PELOSI said last year 
that she wouldn’t support impeach-
ment unless there was something ‘‘so 
compelling and overwhelming and bi-
partisan’’ that it demanded a response. 
Likewise, Congressman JERRY NADLER 
said that the House had to ‘‘persuade 
enough of the opposition party voters’’ 
before it voted to impeach. Democrats 
failed on both counts. Indeed, the only 
bipartisan aspect of the whole pro-
ceeding is that both Republicans and 
Democrats voted against impeaching 
the president. Not a single Republican 
voted for either article of impeachment 
in the House, resulting in the first 
party-line impeachment of a President 
in our Nation’s history. 
So instead of doing their work, House 
Democrats 
simply 
impeached 
the 
President and declared their job com-
plete. Yet after piously declaring the 
urgency of this impeachment, they 
waited a month to send the articles 
over to the Senate. Maybe they had to 
wait for the gold-encrusted souvenir 
pens to arrive for Speaker PELOSI’s 
‘‘signing ceremony.’’ 
And once in the Senate, the political 
theater continued. The House Demo-
crats repeatedly asserted a bizarre log-
ical fallacy: their case was both ‘‘over-
whelming’’ and in need of more evi-
dence. Yet we heard from 17 wit-
nesses—all hand-selected by the House 
Democrats—and received more than 
28,000 pages of documents. The House 
could have pursued more witnesses dur-
ing its impeachment, yet it instead 
chose to rush ahead rather than sub-
poena those witnesses or litigate issues 
in Federal court. In fact, when one of 
the House’s potential witnesses asked a 
Federal court to rule on the issue, the 
House withdrew its subpoena and asked 
to dismiss the case. The House Demo-
crats complain that the courts would 
have taken too long. Yet they expected 
the Senate to delay our work to finish 
theirs. And in a final, remarkable 
stunt, Congressman ADAM SCHIFF sug-
gested that we depose witnesses—only 
his, of course, not the President’s— 
with Chief Justice Roberts ruling on 
all questions of evidence and privilege, 
dragging him into this political spec-
tacle. 
But the curtain will soon come down 
on this political theater. The Senate 
will perform the role intended for us by 
the Founders, of providing the ‘‘cool 
and deliberate sense of the commu-
nity,’’ as it says in Federalist 63, over 
and against an inflamed and transient 
House majority. Were we to do other-
wise, were the Senate to acquiesce to 
the House, this process might have 
dragged on for many weeks, even for 
months, shutting down the normal leg-
islative business of Congress even 
longer than it already has. 
Even 
worse, 
by 
legitimizing 
the 
House’s flawed, partisan impeachment, 
we would be setting a grave precedent 
for the future. Just consider how many 
times we heard about the impeachment 
trial of President Andrew Johnson dur-
ing this trial. The Founders didn’t in-
tend impeachment as a tool to check 
the Executive over policy disagree-
ments or out of political spite. And the 
House has never before used impeach-
ment in this way, not when the Demo-
crats claimed that President George W. 
Bush misled the country into the Iraq 
war or when President Barack Obama 
broke the law by releasing terrorists 
from Guantanamo Bay in return for 
the release of an American deserter, 
Bowe Bergdahl. Indeed, the Republican 
House 
did 
not 
impeach 
President 
Obama for, yes, withholding aid from 
Ukraine for 3 full years. 
No House in the future should lead 
the country down this path again. By 
refusing to do this House’s dirty work, 
the Senate is stopping this dangerous 
precedent and preserving the Founders’ 
understanding that Congress ought to 
restrain the executive through the 
many checks and balances still at our 
disposal. More fundamentally, we are 
preserving the most important check 
of all—an election. It is time to teach 
that lesson to this House and to all fu-
ture Houses, of both parties. 
NANCY PELOSI and ADAM SCHIFF have 
failed, but the American people lost. 
Now it is time to get back to doing the 
people’s business. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about the impeachment 
of Donald J. Trump. 
The Democratic House managers, 
who are prosecuting the case against 
the President, emphasized that history 
is watching. That is true. Every action 
taken by the House and the Senate 
during this impeachment sets a prece-
dent for our country and our institu-
tions of government, whether good or 
bad. 
For that reason, it is our job as Sen-
ators to look at the entire record of 
this proceeding—from what happened 
in the House to final arguments made 
here in the Senate. It is also our duty 
to look at the whole picture, the flawed 
process in the House, the purely par-
tisan nature of the articles of impeach-
ment, the President’s actions that led 
to his impeachment, and the impact of 
all of this on our constitutional norms. 
Most importantly, we must weigh the 
impact on our Nation and on the legit-
imacy of our institutions of govern-
ment, if the Senate were to agree with 
the House managers’ demands to over-
turn the 2016 election and remove the 
President from the 2020 ballot. This has 
never happened in our country’s 243- 
year history. 
It is also our job as Senators during 
an impeachment trial to be guided by 
‘‘a deep responsibility to future times.’’ 
This is a quote from U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Joseph Story, two cen-
turies ago, but it couldn’t be more rel-
evant today. With this grave constitu-
tional responsibility in mind, and con-
sidering the important factors listed 
above, I will vote to acquit the Presi-
dent on both charges brought against 
him. 
It may surprise some, but if you lis-
tened to all the witnesses in this trial 
and you examine the sweep of Amer-
ican history, one strong bipartisan 
point of consensus has emerged: Purely 
partisan impeachments are not in the 
country’s best interest. In fact, they 
are a danger which the Framers of the 
Constitution clearly feared. 
Alexander Hamilton’s warning from 
Federalist No. 65 bears repeating: ‘‘In 
many cases [impeachment] will con-
nect itself with the pre-existing fac-
tions, and will inlist all their animos-
ities, partialities, influence, and inter-
est on one side or on the other; and in 
such cases there will always be the 
greatest danger that the decision will 
be regulated more by the comparative 
strength of parties, than by the real 
demonstrations of innocence or guilt 
. . . Yet it ought not to be forgotten 
that the demon of faction will, at cer-
tain seasons, extend his sceptre over 
all numerous bodies of men.’’ 
The reason for this ‘‘greatest danger’’ 
is obvious: the weaponization of im-
peachment as a regular tool of partisan 
warfare will incapacitate our govern-
ment, undermine the legitimacy of our 
institutions, and tear the country 
apart. Until this impeachment, our 
country’s representatives largely un-
derstood this. During the Clinton im-
peachment—Democrats, including Mi-
nority Leader SCHUMER
and House 
Managers LOFGREN and NADLER, argued 
that a purely partisan impeachment 
would be ‘‘divisive,’’ ‘‘lack the legit-
imacy of a national consensus,’’ and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S933 
February 5, 2020 
‘‘call into question the very legitimacy 
of our political institutions.’’ 
Less than a year ago, Speaker PELOSI 
said: ‘‘Impeachment is so divisive to 
the country that unless there’s some-
thing so compelling and overwhelming 
and bipartisan, I don’t think we should 
go down that path because it divides 
the country.’’ 
Yet here we are. Against the weight 
of bipartisan consensus and the wisdom 
of the Framers, the House still took 
this dramatic and consequential step, 
the first purely partisan impeachment 
in U.S. history. Only Democrats in the 
House voted to impeach the President, 
while a bipartisan group of House 
members opposed. 
This was done through rushed House 
proceedings that lacked the most basic 
due process procedures afforded Presi-
dents Clinton and Nixon during their 
impeachment investigations. A signifi-
cant portion of the House proceedings 
last fall took place in secret, where the 
President was not afforded counsel, the 
ability to call his own witnesses, or 
cross-examine 
those 
of 
the 
House 
Democrats. Certain testimonies from 
these secret hearings were then selec-
tively leaked to a pro-impeachment 
press. This happened in America. In my 
view, it sounds like something more 
worthy of the Soviet Union, not the 
world’s greatest constitutional repub-
lic. 
Yet here we are. A new precedent has 
been set in the House. When asked sev-
eral times if these precedents and the 
partisan nature of this impeachment 
should concern us, the House managers 
dodged the questions, and my Senate 
colleagues, who in 1999 were so strong-
ly and correctly and vocally against 
the dangers of purely partisan im-
peachments, have all gone silent. 
Perhaps it is too late. Perhaps the 
genie is now out of the bottle. Perhaps 
the danger that Hamilton so astutely 
predicted 232 years ago is upon us for 
good. I hope not. No one thinks that 
partisan impeachments every few years 
would be good for our great Nation. 
The Senate does not have to validate 
this House precedent, and a Senate fo-
cused on ‘‘deep responsibility to future 
times’’ shouldn’t do so. 
In addition to unleashing the danger 
of purely partisan impeachments, the 
House’s impeachment action and their 
arguments before the Senate, if rati-
fied, have the potential to undermine 
other critical constitutional norms, 
such as the separation of powers and 
the independence of our judiciary. 
These traditions exist to implement 
the will of the people we represent and 
to protect their liberty. And yet so 
much of what has already been done in 
the House and what has now been ar-
gued in the Senate has little or no 
precedent in U.S. history, thereby 
threatening many of the constitutional 
safeguards that have served our coun-
try so well for over two centuries. 
Take, for example, the debate we re-
cently had on whether to have the Sen-
ate seek additional evidence for this 
impeachment trial. The House Man-
agers claim that, by not doing so, we 
are undermining a ‘‘fair trial’’ in the 
Senate. The irony of such a claim 
should not be lost on the American 
people. 
Throughout this trial, and in their 
briefs, 
the 
House 
managers 
have 
claimed dozens of times that they have 
‘‘overwhelming evidence’’ on the cur-
rent record to impeach the President, 
thereby undermining their own ration-
ale for more evidence. 
And in terms of fairness, it is well 
documented that the Democratic lead-
ership in the House just conducted the 
most rushed, partisan, and fundamen-
tally unfair House impeachment pro-
ceedings in U.S. history. 
A Senate vote to pursue additional 
evidence and witnesses would have 
turned the article I constitutional im-
peachment 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
House and Senate on their heads. It 
would have required the Senate to do 
the House’s impeachment investiga-
tory work, even when the House af-
firmatively declined to seek additional 
evidence last fall, such as subpoenaing 
Ambassador John Bolton, because of 
Speaker PELOSI’s artificial deadline to 
impeach the President by Christmas. 
A vote by the Senate to pursue addi-
tional evidence that the House con-
sciously chose not to obtain would 
incentivize less thorough and more fre-
quent partisan impeachments in the fu-
ture, a danger that should concern us 
all. 
Another example of the House’s at-
tempt to erode long-standing constitu-
tional norms is found in its second Ar-
ticle of Impeachment, obstruction of 
Congress. This article claims that the 
President committed an impeachable 
offence by resisting House subpoenas 
for witnesses and documents, even 
though the House didn’t attempt to ne-
gotiate, accommodate, or litigate the 
President’s asserted defenses, such as 
executive privilege and immunity, to 
provide such evidence. 
These defenses have been utilized by 
administrations, Democrat and Repub-
lican, for decades and go to the heart of 
the separation of powers within the ar-
ticle I and article II branches of the 
Federal Government and even impli-
cate a defendant’s right to vigorously 
defend oneself in court. Indeed, the Su-
preme Court acknowledged in United 
States v. Nixon that the President has 
the right to assert executive privilege. 
Nevertheless, the House managers ar-
gued that the mere assertion of these 
constitutional rights is an impeachable 
offense, in essence claiming the unilat-
eral power to define the limits and 
scope of executive privilege, while si-
multaneously 
usurping 
that 
power 
from the courts, where it has existed 
for centuries. 
Indeed, the House managers even ar-
gued that merely asserting these de-
fenses is evidence of guilt itself. This is 
a 
dangerous 
argument 
that 
dem-
onstrates a lack of understanding of 
basic constitutional norms. As U.S. Su-
preme Court Justice Brandeis stated in 
his famous dissent in Myers v. United 
States, ‘‘The doctrine of the separation 
of powers was adopted by the conven-
tion of 1787 not to promote efficiency 
but to preclude the exercise of arbi-
trary power. The purpose was not to 
avoid friction, but, by means of the in-
evitable friction incident to the dis-
tribution of the governmental powers 
among three departments, to save the 
people from autocracy.’’ If allowed to 
stand by the Senate, the implications 
of these House precedents for our Na-
tion and the individual liberties of the 
people we represent are difficult to dis-
cern, but would be profound and likely 
very negative. 
Similarly concerning were the at-
tempts, both subtle and not so subtle, 
to inject Chief Justice Roberts of the 
U.S. Supreme Court into this trial. The 
smooth siren song of House Manager 
SCHIFF, casually inviting the Senate 
and Chief Justice into a constitutional 
labyrinth for which there may have 
been no exit, was a recurring theme of 
this trial. 
‘‘We have a perfectly good judge 
here,’’ SCHIFF said over and over again, 
‘‘whom you all trust and have con-
fidence in.’’ Let him quickly decide all 
the weighty legal and constitutional 
issues before the Senate, the relevance 
of witnesses, claims of immunity and 
executive privilege, what House Man-
ager NADLER described on day 1 of the 
trial as ‘‘executive privilege, and other 
nonsense.’’ 
Moreover, the Chief Justice could do 
this all within a week, SCHIFF told us. 
It all seemed so simple, rational, and 
efficient. But our Constitution doesn’t 
work this way. The Chief Justice, in an 
impeachment of the President, sits as 
the Presiding Officer over the Senate, 
not as an article III judge. And while 
the Senate can delegate certain trial 
powers to him, it cannot delegate mat-
ters, such as a President’s claims of ex-
ecutive privilege, over which the Sen-
ate itself does not have constitutional 
authority. 
The quick and efficient fix SCHIFF 
was tempting the Senate with might 
have ended up as a form of constitu-
tional demolition. And as the trial pro-
ceeded, it became apparent that it was 
more than just claims of efficiency be-
hind the invitation to draw the Chief 
Justice fully into the trial. 
There was something else afoot, a 
subtle and not so subtle attempt by 
some to attack the credibility and 
independence of the Chief Justice and 
the Court he leads. The junior Senator 
from Massachusetts’ question for the 
House managers, which drew an audi-
ble gasp from those watching in the 
Senate after the Chief Justice read it, 
made this clear, when she asked about 
‘‘the loss of legitimacy of the Chief 
Justice, the Supreme Court, and the 
Constitution,’’ so too did Minority 
Leader SCHUMER’s parliamentary in-
quiry about the precedent from the im-
peachment of President Johnson 150 
years ago, on the role of the Chief Jus-
tice in breaking ties on 50–50 votes in

February 5, 2020 
the Senate during Presidential im-
peachments. Chief Justice Roberts’ co-
gent, historically accurate, and con-
stitutionally, based answer to this in-
quiry will set an important precedent 
on this impeachment issue for genera-
tions to come. 
Perhaps it is all a coincidence, but as 
these attempts to diminish the Chief 
Justice’s credibility by more fully 
dragging him into this impeachment 
trial were ongoing, much more harsh 
political ads directly attacking him in 
this regard were being launched across 
the country. Members of the Senate 
noticed, and we were not impressed. 
The independence of the Federal judi-
ciary as established in our Constitu-
tion is a gift to our Nation that has 
taken centuries to develop. The over-
reach of the House managers and cer-
tain Democratic Senators seeking to 
undermine this essential constitutional 
norm was a disappointing and even 
dangerous aspect of this impeachment 
trial. 
When historians someday write about 
this divisive period of American his-
tory, they would do well to focus on 
these subtle and not so subtle attacks 
on the Chief Justice’s credibility—and 
by extension the credibility of the Su-
preme Court—for it was clearly one of 
the important reasons why the Senate 
voted last week, 51 to 49, to no longer 
prolong the trial phase of this impeach-
ment. 
The impeachment articles do not 
charge the President with a crime. Al-
though there was much debate in the 
trial on whether this is required, it is 
undisputed that in all previous presi-
dential 
impeachments—Johnson, 
Nixon, and Clinton—the President was 
charged with having violated a crimi-
nal statute. And there was little dis-
pute that these charges were accurate. 
Lowering the bar to non-criminal of-
fenses has set a new precedent. How-
ever, whether a crime is required is 
still debatable. Instead, the House im-
peachment charged the President with 
an abuse of power based on speculative 
interpretation of his intent. 
So what about the President’s ac-
tions that were the primary focus of 
this impeachment trial and the basis of 
the House’s first Article of Impeach-
ment claim that he abused his power? 
The House managers argued that the 
President abused his power by taking 
actions that on their face appeared 
valid—withholding aid to a foreign 
country and investigating corruption— 
but were motivated by ‘‘corrupt in-
tent.’’ 
One significant problem with this ar-
gument is that it is vague and hinges 
on deciphering the President’s intent 
and motives, a difficult feat because it 
is subjective and could be—and was in-
deed in this case—defined by a partisan 
House. Further, the House managers 
argue essentially that there could be 
no legitimate national interest in pur-
suing investigations into interference 
of the U.S. 2016 elections by Ukraine 
and corruption involving Burisma. 
I believe all Presidents have the right 
to investigate interference in U.S. elec-
tions and credible claims of corruption 
and conflicts of interest, particularly 
in countries where America sends sig-
nificant amounts of foreign aid, like 
Ukraine, and where corruption is en-
demic, like Ukraine. 
Were the President’s actions perfect? 
No. For example, despite having the 
authority to investigate corruption in 
Ukraine and with Burisma, I believe he 
should have requested such an inves-
tigation through more official and ro-
bust channels, such as pursuing co-
operation through the U.S. Mutual 
Legal Assistance Treaty with Ukraine, 
with the Department of Justice in the 
lead. I also believe that the role of Mr. 
Giuliani has caused confusion and may 
have undermined the Trump adminis-
tration’s broader foreign policy goals 
with regard to Ukraine. 
But none of this even remotely rises 
to the level of an offense that merits 
removing the President from office. It 
is difficult to imagine a situation re-
quiring a higher burden of proof. The 
radical and dangerous step that the 
House Democrats are proposing seems 
to have been lost in all of the noise. 
What they are asking the Senate to 
do is not just overturn the results of 
the 2016 election—nullifying the votes 
of millions of Americans—but to re-
move the President from the 2020 bal-
lot, even as primary voting has begun 
across the country. 
Such a step, if ever realized, would do 
infinitely more damage to the legit-
imacy of our constitutional republic 
and political system than any mistake 
or error of judgment President Trump 
may have made. 
An impeachment trial is supposed to 
be the last resort to protect the Amer-
ican people against the highest crimes 
that undermine and threaten the foun-
dations of our Republic, not to get rid 
of a President because a faction of one 
political party disagrees with the way 
he governs. That is what elections are 
for. 
I trust the Alaskan and American 
people, not House Democrats, with the 
monumental decision of choosing who 
should lead our Nation. 
And soon, they will decide, again, 
who should lead our Nation. In church-
es, libraries, and school cafeterias, the 
people all across the country will vote 
for who they want to represent them. 
And I am convinced that the Amer-
ican people will make their choices 
wisely. 
Let me conclude by saying a few 
words about where we should go from 
here. 
Right before this impeachment trial 
began, I was at an event in Wasilla, 
AK, where many of Alaska’s military 
veterans attended. A proud veteran ap-
proached me with a simple but fervent 
request. ‘‘Senator SULLIVAN,’’ he said, 
‘‘Protect our Constitution.’’ 
So many of us, including me, have 
heard similar pleas over the past few 
months from the people we represent, 
but there was something about the way 
he said it, something in his eyes that 
truly got my attention. I realized that 
something was fear. That man, a brave 
Alaskan who had served in the military 
to protect our constitutional freedoms, 
was afraid that the country he knows 
and he loves was at risk. And I have to 
admit that I have had similar fears 
these past weeks. 
But I look around me, on this floor, 
and I continue to see hope for our Na-
tion. 
I see my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle—my friends—who are will-
ing to work with me on so many issues 
to find solutions sorely needed for the 
country. 
And back home, I see my fellow Alas-
kans, some of them fearful, but also so 
hungry to do their part to help heal the 
divides. 
We should end this chapter, and we 
should take our cues from them, the 
people 
whose 
spirit 
and 
character 
guides this great Nation. They want us 
to protect our Constitution. They need 
us to work together to do that and ad-
dress America’s challenges. 
It’s time to get back to the work 
Alaskans want the Congress to focus 
on: growing our economy, improving 
our infrastructure, rebuilding our mili-
tary, cleaning up our oceans, lowering 
healthcare costs and drug prices, open-
ing markets for our fishermen, and 
taking care of our most vulnerable in 
society like survivors of sexual assault 
and domestic violence and those strug-
gling with addiction. 
That is what I am committed to do. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
the decision I make today is not an 
easy one, nor should it be. 
I have approached this serious task 
with an open and impartial mind, as 
my trial oath required. I have studied 
the facts and the evidence of the case 
before me. 
I have been an attorney for over two 
decades, and I was the attorney general 
of Nevada for 8 years. And I keep com-
ing back to what I learned in the court-
room. The law is a technical field, but 
it is also based on common sense. 
You don’t have to study the law for 
years to know that stealing and cheat-
ing are wrong. It is one of the first 
things we learn in our formative years. 
And you don’t have to be a law school 
professor to realize that a President 
should not be using the job the Amer-
ican people gave him to benefit himself 
personally. 
Abraham Lincoln reminded us that 
our Nation was founded on the essen-
tial idea of government ‘‘of the people, 
by the people, for the people.’’ 
As I sat on the Senate floor thinking 
about President Lincoln and listening 
to the arguments in President Trump’s 
impeachment trial, I thought of the 
awesome responsibility our Founding 
Fathers entrusted to each Senator. 
I also thought about all of the Nevad-
ans I represent—those who voted for 
President Trump and those who did 
not. For those who did, I put myself in

their shoes and considered how I would 
respond if the President were from my 
political party. 
The removal of a sitting President 
through impeachment is an extraor-
dinary remedy. It rarely occurs, and no 
Senator should rush into it. 
Yet impeachment is a key part of our 
constitutional order. When our Found-
ing Fathers designed the Office of the 
Presidency, the Framers of the Con-
stitution had just gotten rid of a King, 
and they didn’t want another one. 
They were afraid that the President 
might use his extensive powers for his 
own benefit. 
To prevent this, the Framers pro-
vided for impeachment by the House 
and trial by the Senate for ‘‘treason, 
bribery, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors.’’ 
They didn’t have to do things this 
way. They could have left it up to the 
courts to hold the trial of a President 
accused of wrongdoing. 
But they wanted to make sure each 
branch of government could be a check 
on the other, which would bring bal-
ance to our system of government. 
And the Framers were specifically 
concerned with the idea of an all-pow-
erful Executive who might abuse his 
power and invite foreign interference 
in our elections. 
This concern is reflected in the Arti-
cles of Impeachment laid out by the 
House managers. 
Putting aside the biases I heard com-
ing from both political parties, I fo-
cused on getting to the truth of the 
case—like any trial attorney. 
The truth in any case that I have 
been involved with starts with the 
facts. 
For 2 weeks I listened to the argu-
ments presented by both sides, took 
notes, posed questions, and identified 
the facts that were supported and sub-
stantiated and those that were not. 
With a heavy heart and great sad-
ness, I became convinced by the evi-
dence that President Trump inten-
tionally withheld security assistance 
and a coveted White House meeting to 
pressure Ukraine into helping him po-
litically, even though Ukraine was de-
fending itself from Russia. 
This wasn’t an action ‘‘of the people, 
by the people, for the people.’’ 
President Trump used the immense 
power of the U.S. Government not for 
the people but, rather, for himself. 
We know these facts from President 
Trump’s own words in a phone call to 
Ukrainian President Zelensky in July 
and in statements to the press in Octo-
ber. 
We also know it through the testi-
mony of 17 American officials—many 
of them appointed by the President 
himself. 
Those officials indicated that over 
the spring and summer of 2019, through 
both 
his 
personal 
lawyer, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, and through American dip-
lomats, 
President 
Trump 
asked 
Ukraine to publicly announce inves-
tigations that would influence the 2020 
elections in his favor. 
We also know through testimony pro-
vided during the House investigation 
that President Trump tried to pressure 
Ukraine to announce those investiga-
tions, first by conditioning a visit by 
President Zelensky to the White House 
on them and later by denying $391 mil-
lion in security assistance to Ukraine. 
Some of my colleagues don’t dispute 
these facts. 
President Trump’s actions interfere 
with the fundamental tenets of our 
Constitution. Citizens do not get to 
govern themselves if the officials who 
get elected seek their own benefit to 
the detriment of the public good. 
The Framers knew this. They were 
very aware that officials could leverage 
their office to benefit themselves. 
In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Ham-
ilton explained why we had the im-
peachment power in the first place: it 
was to respond to ‘‘those offenses 
which proceed from the misconduct of 
public men, or in other words, from the 
abuse or violation of some public 
trust.’’ 
With 
the 
undisputed 
facts 
con-
demning the president, I listened to the 
President’s counsel argue that the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment were defective 
because abuse of power and obstruction 
of Congress are not crimes. 
However, many constitutional schol-
ars soundly refuted this argument, and 
precedent supports them. The Impeach-
ment Articles in President Nixon’s case 
included abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress. 
During this impeachment investiga-
tion, the President blocked all mem-
bers of his administration from testi-
fying in response to congressional com-
mittee requests and withheld all docu-
ments. 
This action is absolutely unprece-
dented in American history. Even 
Presidents Nixon and Clinton allowed 
staff to testify to Congress during im-
peachment investigations and provided 
some documents. 
The executive branch has no blanket 
claim to secrecy. It works for the 
American people, as do Members of 
Congress. 
In the Senate, the President’s coun-
sel argued that the House investigators 
should have fought this wholesale ob-
struction in court. Yet at the same 
time, in a court down the street, other 
administration lawyers contended that 
the courts should stay out of disputes 
between Congress and the President. 
The President’s counsel also argued 
that the American people should decide 
in the next election whether to remove 
President Trump for his actions. But if 
this were the standard, then the im-
peachment clause could only ever be 
utilized in the second term of a Presi-
dency, when no upcoming election 
would preserve the country. 
Most importantly, isn’t the impeach-
ment clause pointless if a president can 
abuse his power in office and then com-
pletely refuse to comply with a House 
impeachment investigation and a Sen-
ate trial in order to delay until the 
next election? 
The Framers themselves actually ar-
gued about whether Americans could 
rely on elections to get rid of bad presi-
dents. They decided that if they didn’t 
put the impeachment power into the 
Constitution, 
a 
corrupt 
President 
would be willing to do anything to get 
himself reelected. 
James Madison said that without im-
peachment, a corrupt President ‘‘might 
be fatal to the Republic.’’ 
And through my oath of office as a 
Senator, I swore to protect not just Ne-
vadans but also our great Republic. 
Our 
country, 
unfortunately, 
has 
never been more divided along party 
lines. It played out in the House im-
peachment investigation and in the 
Senate trial. The Senate rules for the 
trial were not written by all of the 
Senators with bipartisan input. In-
stead, they were written behind closed 
doors by one man in coordination with 
the President. In so doing, the Senate 
has abdicated its powerful check on the 
executive branch. 
Without this important check, I am 
concerned about what the President 
will do next to put our Republic in 
jeopardy. 
We have seen that President Trump 
is willing to violate our Constitution in 
order to get himself reelected. He has 
disrespected norms and worked to di-
vide our country for his own political 
gain. He has undermined our standing 
in the world and put awesome pressure 
on foreign leaders to benefit himself, 
rather than to advance the interests of 
our country. 
I have also learned from this trial 
that the President is willing to take 
any action, including cheating in the 
next election, to serve his personal in-
terest. 
No act in our country is more sacred 
and solemn for democracy than voting, 
and nothing in our system of govern-
ment is more vital to the continued 
health of our democracy than its elec-
tions. No American should stand for 
foreign election interference, much less 
invite it. 
American elections are for Ameri-
cans. 
That is why I cannot condone this 
President’s actions by acquitting him. 
Finding the President guilty of abuse 
of power and obstruction of Congress 
marks a sad day for our country and 
not something I do with a light heart. 
But I was sent to Congress not just to 
fight for all Nevadans but also to fight 
for our children and their future. To 
leave them with a country that still 
believes in right and wrong, that ex-
poses corruption in government and 
holds it accountable, that stands up to 
tyranny at home and abroad. 
In my view, President Trump has 
fallen far, far short of those lofty ideals 
and of the demands of our Constitu-
tion. 
That requires the rest of us, regard-
less of party, creed, or ethnicity, to 
work together all the more urgently to 
defend our democracy, our elections, 
and our national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S936 
February 5, 2020 
I have faith in Americans because I 
have seen time and time again in Ne-
vada our ability to come together and 
work with one another for our common 
good. 
America is more than just one per-
son, and like President Lincoln’s, my 
faith will always lie with the people. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I didn’t 
come to the Senate expecting to sit as 
a juror in an impeachment trial. I have 
participated in this trial with an open 
mind, 
determined 
to 
evaluate 
the 
President’s actions outside of any par-
tisan lens, and with a focus on my con-
stitutional obligations. I listened to 
the arguments, took detailed notes, 
asked questions, and heard both sides 
answer questions from my colleagues. 
After thorough consideration, based on 
the evidence presented, sadly, I find I 
have no choice but to vote to remove 
the President from office. 
The first Article of Impeachment 
charges the President with abuse of 
power, specifically alleging that the 
President used the powers of his public 
office to obtain an improper political 
benefit. I can now conclude the evi-
dence shows that this is exactly what 
the President did when he withheld 
critically important security assist-
ance from Ukraine in order to persuade 
the Ukrainian Government to inves-
tigate his political rival. I understand 
that foreign policy involves negotia-
tions, leveraging advantages, and using 
all the powers at our disposal to ad-
vance U.S. national security goals. But 
this was different. The President sent 
his personal attorney, whose obligation 
is to protect the personal interests of 
the President, not the United States, 
to meet and negotiate with foreign 
government officials from Ukraine to 
get damaging information about the 
President’s rivals, culminating in the 
July 25 phone call between the U.S. and 
Ukrainian Presidents, during which the 
President made clear his intent to 
withhold aid until a political favor was 
completed. In doing so, the President 
put U.S. national security and a key 
alliance against Russian aggression at 
risk, all so he could benefit politically 
from the potential fallout from an in-
vestigation into a possible opponent. 
While I would like to hear more from 
witnesses and see the documents the 
administration is withholding, the evi-
dence presented is compelling and not 
in doubt. The President withheld mili-
tary aid in order to coerce an ally to 
help him politically. This is no mere 
policy disagreement; this is about 
whether the President negotiates with 
foreign governments on behalf of the 
United States; or on his own behalf. No 
elected official, regardless of party, 
should use public office to advance his 
or her personal interests, particularly 
to the detriment of U.S. national secu-
rity, and in the case of the President of 
the United States, such conduct is par-
ticularly dangerous. As elected offi-
cials, we have no more important re-
sponsibility than ensuring our national 
security, and that includes protecting 
the Nation from future threats. The 
President’s conduct here sets a dan-
gerous precedent that must not be re-
peated in the future and requires a firm 
response by the representatives of the 
people. After hearing evidence that the 
President heldup congressionally ap-
proved military assistance to an ally 
fighting Russia in order to exact con-
cessions from Ukraine that benefited 
him personally, we cannot trust the 
President to place national security 
over his own interests. It is therefore 
with sadness that I conclude that the 
President must be removed from office 
under article I and I will vote to con-
vict him of abuse of power. 
With respect to the second Article of 
Impeachment charging obstruction of 
Congress, the President’s behavior sug-
gests that he believes he is above the 
law. Certainly, there may be docu-
ments and testimony that are subject 
to executive privilege or are confiden-
tial for some other reason. But here, 
the President directed every agency, 
office, and employee in the executive 
branch not to cooperate with the im-
peachment inquiry conducted by the 
U.S. House of Representatives. As a 
Member of Congress, I take my over-
sight role seriously. It is how we en-
sure transparency in government, so 
the people of Nevada can know how 
their tax dollars are spent and whether 
their elected officials are acting le-
gally, ethically, and in their best inter-
ests. The President’s refusal to nego-
tiate in good faith with the House in-
vestigators over documents and testi-
mony and instead to impede any inves-
tigation into his official conduct can 
only be characterized as blatant ob-
struction. 
More importantly, it suggests that 
he will continue to operate outside the 
law, and if he believes he can ignore 
lawful subpoenas from Congress, it will 
be impossible to hold him accountable. 
For these reasons, I will vote to con-
vict the President of obstruction of 
Congress, as delineated in article II. 
Impeachment is a grave constitu-
tional remedy, not a partisan exercise. 
To fulfill my constitutional role as a 
juror, I asked myself how I would view 
the evidence if it were any President 
accused of this conduct. Based on the 
facts and arguments presented, I con-
clude that no President of the United 
States, regardless of party, can trade 
congressionally approved and legally 
mandated military assistance for per-
sonal political favors. No one is above 
the law, not this President or the next 
President. Having exercised my con-
stitutional duty, I will continue what I 
have been doing over the course of this 
trial and have done since I first came 
to Congress, to look past partisanship 
and develop commonsense, bipartisan 
solutions that help hard-working fami-
lies in Nevada and across the country.

ARTICLE I 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will

ment. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has abused the powers of the Presi-
dency, in that: 
Using the powers of his high office, Presi-
dent Trump solicited the interference of a 
foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 
United States Presidential election. He did 
so through a scheme or course of conduct 
that included soliciting the Government of 
Ukraine to publicly announce investigations 
that would benefit his reelection, harm the 
election prospects of a political opponent, 
and influence the 2020 United States Presi-
dential election to his advantage. President 
Trump also sought to pressure the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to take these steps by con-
ditioning official United States Government

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S937 
February 5, 2020 
acts of significant value to Ukraine on its 
public announcement of the investigations. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct for corrupt purposes in 
pursuit of personal political benefit. In so 
doing, President Trump used the powers of 
the Presidency in a manner that com-
promised the national security of the United 
States and undermined the integrity of the 
United States democratic process. He thus 
ignored and injured the interests of the Na-
tion. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct through the following 
means: 
(1) President Trump—acting both directly 
and through his agents within and outside 
the United States Government—corruptly 
solicited the Government of Ukraine to pub-
licly announce investigations into— 
(A) a political opponent, former Vice Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; and 
(B) a discredited theory promoted by Rus-
sia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Rus-
sia—interfered in the 2016 United States 
Presidential election. 
(2) With the same corrupt motives, Presi-
dent 
Trump—acting 
both 
directly 
and 
through his agents within and outside the 
United States Government—conditioned two 
official acts on the public announcements 
that he had requested— 
(A) the release of $391 million of United 
States taxpayer funds that Congress had ap-
propriated on a bipartisan basis for the pur-
pose of providing vital military and security 
assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian ag-
gression and which President Trump had or-
dered suspended; and 
(B) a head of state meeting at the White 
House, which the President of Ukraine 
sought to demonstrate continued United 
States 
support 
for 
the 
Government 
of 
Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. 
(3) Faced with the public revelation of his 
actions, President Trump ultimately re-
leased the military and security assistance 
to the Government of Ukraine, but has per-
sisted in openly and corruptly urging and so-
liciting Ukraine to undertake investigations 
for his personal political benefit. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous invitations of foreign 
interference in United States elections. 
In all of this, President Trump abused the 
powers of the Presidency by ignoring and in-
juring national security and other vital na-
tional interests to obtain an improper per-
sonal political benefit. He has also betrayed 
the Nation by abusing his high office to en-
list a foreign power in corrupting democratic 
elections. 
Wherefore President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to national security and the Constitu-
tion if allowed to remain in office, and has 
acted in a manner grossly incompatible with 
self-governance and the rule of law. Presi-
dent Trump thus warrants impeachment and 
trial, removal from office, and disqualifica-
tion to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this Article 
of Impeachment, 48 Senators have pro-
nounced Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, guilty as 
charged; 52 Senators have pronounced 
him not guilty as charged. 
Two-thirds of the Senators present 
not having pronounced him guilty, the 
Senate adjudges that the Respondent, 
Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, is not guilty as charged 
on the first Article of Impeachment. 
ARTICLE II 
The clerk will read the second Arti-
cle of Impeachment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has directed the unprecedented, cat-
egorical, and indiscriminate defiance of sub-
poenas issued by the House of Representa-
tives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’. President Trump has abused 
the powers of the Presidency in a manner of-
fensive to, and subversive of, the Constitu-
tion, in that: 
The House of Representatives has engaged 
in an impeachment inquiry focused on Presi-
dent Trump’s corrupt solicitation of the 
Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 
2020 United States Presidential election. As 
part of this impeachment inquiry, the Com-
mittees 
undertaking 
the 
investigation 
served subpoenas seeking documents and tes-
timony deemed vital to the inquiry from var-
ious Executive Branch agencies and offices, 
and current and former officials. 
In response, without lawful cause or ex-
cuse, President Trump directed Executive 
Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to 
comply with those subpoenas. President 
Trump thus interposed the powers of the 
Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of 
the House of Representatives, and assumed 
to himself functions and judgments nec-
essary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole Power of 
Impeachment’’ vested by the Constitution in 
the House of Representatives. 
President Trump abused the powers of his 
high office through the following means: 
(1) Directing the White House to defy a 
lawful subpoena by withholding the produc-
tion of documents sought therein by the 
Committees. 
(2) Directing other Executive Branch agen-
cies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and 
withhold the production of documents and 
records from the Committees—in response to 
which the Department of State, Office of 
Management and Budget, Department of En-
ergy, and Department of Defense refused to 
produce a single document or record. 
(3) Directing current and former Executive 
Branch officials not to cooperate with the 
Committees—in response to which nine Ad-
ministration officials defied subpoenas for 
testimony, namely John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ 
Mulvaney, 
Robert 
B. 
Blair, 
John 
A. 
Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Grif-
fith, Russell T. Vought, Michael Duffey, 
Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous efforts to undermine 
United States Government investigations 
into foreign interference in United States 
elections. 
Through these actions, President Trump 
sought to arrogate to himself the right to de-
termine the propriety, scope, and nature of 
an impeachment inquiry into his own con-
duct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to 
deny any and all information to the House of 
Representatives in the exercise of its ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment’’. In the history of 
the Republic, no President has ever ordered 
the complete defiance of an impeachment in-
quiry or sought to obstruct and impede so 
comprehensively the ability of the House of 
Representatives to investigate ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’. This abuse of office 
served to cover up the President’s own re-
peated misconduct and to seize and control 
the power of impeachment—and thus to nul-
lify a vital constitutional safeguard vested 
solely in the House of Representatives. 
In all of this, President Trump has acted in 
a manner contrary to his trust as President 
and subversive of constitutional government, 
to the great prejudice of the cause of law and 
justice, and to the manifest injury of the 
people of the United States. 
Wherefore, President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-governance 
and the rule of law. President Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, removal 
from office, and disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States. 
VOTE ON ARTICLE II 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is 
on the second Article of Impeachment.

The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this Article 
of Impeachment, 47 Senators have pro-
nounced Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, guilty as 
charged; 53 Senators have pronounced 
him not guilty as charged; two-thirds 
of the Senators present not having pro-
nounced him guilty, the Senate ad-
judges that respondent, Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States, 
is not guilty as charged in the second 
Article of Impeachment. 
The Presiding Officer directs judg-
ment to be entered in accordance with 
the judgment of the Senate as follows: 
The Senate, having tried Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States, upon 
two 
articles 
of 
impeachment 
exhibited 
against him by the House of Representatives, 
and two-thirds of the Senators present not 
having found him guilty of the charges con-
tained therein, it is, therefore, ordered and 
adjudged that the said Donald John Trump 
be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges 
in said articles. 
The Chair recognizes the majority 
leader. 
COMMUNICATION TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
AND TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send an order to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will 
report the order. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Ordered, that the Secretary be directed to 
communicate to the Secretary of State, as 
provided by Rule XXII of the Rules of Proce-
dure and Practice in the Senate when sitting 
on impeachment trials, and also to the 
House of Representatives, the judgment of 
the Senate in the case of Donald John 
Trump, and transmit a certified copy of the 
judgment to each. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, the order will be entered. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE TO THE CHIEF 
JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
before this process fully concludes, I 
want to very quickly acknowledge a 
few of the people who helped the Sen-
ate fulfill our duty these past weeks. 
First and foremost, I know my col-
leagues join me in thanking Chief Jus-
tice Roberts for presiding over the Sen-
ate trial with a clear head, steady 
hand, and the forbearance that this 
rare occasion demands. 
(Applause.) 
We know full well that his presence 
as our Presiding Officer came in addi-
tion to, not instead of, his day job 
across the street, so the Senate thanks 
the Chief Justice and his staff who 
helped him perform this unique role. 
Like his predecessor, Chief Justice 
Rehnquist, the Senate will be awarding 
Chief Justice Roberts the golden gavel 
to commemorate his time presiding 
over this body. We typically award this 
to new Senators after about 100 hours 
in the chair, but I think we can agree 
that the Chief Justice has put in his 
due and then some. 
The page is delivering the gavel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you 
very much. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Of course, there 
are 
countless 
Senate 
professionals 
whose efforts were essential, and I will 
have more thorough facts to offer next 
week to all of those teams, from the 
Secretary of the Senate’s office, to the 
Parliamentarian, to the Sergeant at 
Arms team, and beyond. 
But there are two more groups I 
would like to single out now. First, the 
two different classes of Senate pages 
who participated in this trial, their 
footwork and cool under pressure lit-
erally kept the floor running. Our cur-
rent class came on board right in the 
middle of the third Presidential im-
peachment trial in American history 
and quickly found themselves hand-de-
livering 180 question cards from Sen-
ators’ desks to the dais. 
No pressure, right, guys? 
So thank you all very much for your 
good work. 
(Applause.) 
Second, the fine men and women of 
the Capitol Police, we know that the 
safety of our democracy literally rests 
in their hands every single day, but the 
heightened measures surrounding the 
trial meant even more hours and even 
more work and even more vigilance. 
Thank you all very much for your 
service to this body and to the country. 
(Applause.) 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair rec-
ognizes the Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
join the Republican leader in thanking 
the personnel who aided the Senate 
over the past several weeks. The Cap-
itol Police do an outstanding job, day 
in and day out, to protect the Members 
of this Chamber, their staffs, the press, 
and everyone who works in and visits 
this Capitol. 
They were asked to work extra shifts 
and in greater numbers provide addi-
tional security over the past 3 weeks. 
Thank you to every one of them. 
I, too, would like to thank those 
wonderful pages. I so much enjoyed you 
with your serious faces walking down 
right here and giving the Chief Justice 
our questions. As the leader noted, the 
new class of pages started midway in 
this impeachment trial. When you take 
a new job, you are usually given a few 
days to take stock of things and get up 
to speed. 
This class was given no such leeway, 
but they stepped right in and didn’t 
miss a beat. Carrying hundreds of ques-
tions from U.S. Senators to the Chief 
Justice on national television is not 
how most of us spend our first week at 
work, but they did it with aplomb. 
I would also like to extend my per-
sonal thank you to David Hauck, Di-
rector of the Office of Accessibility 
Services; Tyler Pumphrey, supervisor; 
and Grace Ridgeway, wonderful Direc-
tor of Capitol Facilities. 
Everyone on Grace’s team worked so 
hard to make sure we were ready for 
impeachment: Gary Richardson, known 
affectionately to us as ‘‘Tiny,’’ the 
chief Chamber attendant; Jim Hoover 
and the cabinet shop who built new 
cabinets to deprive us of the use of our 
electronics and flip phones during the 
trial; Brenda Byrd and her team who 
did a spectacular job of keeping the 
Capitol clean; and Lynden Webb and 
his team, who moved the furniture, and 
then moved it again and again and 
again. 
Grace, we appreciate all your hard 
work. Please convey our sincerest 
thanks to your staff. Thank you all, 
the whole staff, for your diligent work 
through many long days and late 
nights during this very trying time in 
our Nation’s history. 
STATEMENT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE 
UNITED STATES ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. At this time, 
the Chair also wishes to make a very 
brief statement. 
I would like to begin by thanking the 
majority leader and the Democratic 
leader for their support as I attempted 
to carry out ill-defined responsibilities 
in an unfamiliar setting. They ensured 
that I had wise counsel of the Senate 
itself through its Secretary and her 
legislative staff. 
I am especially grateful to the Par-
liamentarian and her deputy for their 
unfailing patience and keen insight. I 
am likewise grateful to the Sergeant at 
Arms and his staff for the assistance 
and many courtesies that they ex-
tended during my period of required 
residency. Thank you all for making 
my presence here as comfortable as 
possible. 
As I depart the Chamber, I do so with 
an invitation to visit the Court. By

TRIBUTE TO DONNA PASQUALINO 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President I 
would like to recognize a remarkable 
Senate career that has drawn to a close 
after 
nearly 
30 
years. 
Donna 
Pasqualino began her career with the 
Office of the Legislative Counsel in 
May of 1990. Donna came to the office 
having spent several years at the Naval 
Research Lab. Hired to serve as a staff 
assistant in the office Donna quickly 
mastered the job and became a valu-
able asset to the office attorneys as 
they worked to produce draft legisla-
tion for the Senate. In 2001, Donna was 
promoted to office manager. She flour-
ished in that position, carrying out her 
duties with the highest degree of pro-
fessionalism keeping the office running 
smoothly and efficiently for the last 20 
years. 
Donna is a people person. While 
working for the office, she was fre-
quently seen in the halls of the Senate 
office buildings, hustling to the Dis-
bursing Office to drop off vouchers and 
other important papers for the office, 
just doing her daily walk during her 
lunch break to get in some exercise. 
Whether she was on official office busi-
ness or just getting in some exercise, 
Donna always had a smile on her face 
or a kind word for the many Senators 
and Senate staffers that she met along 
the way. 
Donna is now moving on to a well- 
earned retirement. She has relocated 
to the Eastern Shore of Maryland with 
her husband Frank and plans to learn 
to read music, to speak Italian, and 
spend more time with her four grand-
children. She departs with the immeas-
urable thanks and gratitude of the 
staff of the Office of Legislative Coun-
sel and the Senate and with our best 
wishes for her and for her family.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DENMAN WOLFE 
∑ Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Denman 
Wolfe of Scottsville, AR, was called 
home to be with the Lord last Thurs-
day at age 98. He was Arkansas’s last 
surviving Army Ranger who served in 
the Second World War. 
Denman’s whole life was a portrait of 
honor, but he will be remembered espe-
cially for his heroic actions at age 23, 
when he took part in the invasion of 
Normandy—one of many thousands of 
American troops who stormed the 
beaches that morning to free Europe 
from Nazi tyranny. 
Private Wolfe was part of the elite 
5th Ranger Battalion charged with si-
lencing the guns atop Pointe du Hoc, a 
dagger-like cliff well-guarded by Ger-
man defenders. His force landed at 
Omaha Beach amid intense artillery 
fire, sustaining casualties amid the 
fighting on the beachhead. He was still 
on the beach with his fellow Rangers 
when MG Norman Cota shouted the 
order that has now become part of 
Ranger lore: ‘‘Rangers, lead the way!’’ 
Denman Wolfe obeyed this order with 
distinction over the course of his mili-
tary service. In addition to fighting on 
D-day, Wolfe led the way during the Al-
lied invasions of North Africa and Sic-
ily during World War II and later in 
Asia during the Korean war. In total, 
he served in the Army for more than 20 
years, remaining on Active Duty until 
1964 and attaining the rank of sergeant 
first class. For this valorous service, 
Wolfe was awarded the Bronze Star, 
Purple Heart, and many other combat 
decorations. 
Denman’s service to his country 
didn’t end once he left the military, 
however. Once marked, a Ranger serves 
for life. After settling in Arkansas 
after the war, Denman was called to 
work for his adopted State as a correc-
tional officer, deputy sheriff, and elec-
tion judge. 
But his heart was always with the 
land, where he worked for many years 
as a rancher. Denman’s many friends 
and relatives remember him as an avid 
outdoorsman who spent his free time 
fishing, hunting, gardening, foraging— 
even winemaking. 
Denman took special joy in sharing 
these hobbies with his family, includ-
ing his wife, Kay, his two daughters, 
Lesa and Lori, and his many grand-
children and great-grandchildren. 
Denman Wolfe was among the great-
est of a great generation. It is fitting 
we honor him for his bravery at age 23 
as a young private but also for a life-
time of service to his country and com-
munity. We honor him for his sake but 
also to hold up his life as an example 
worthy of emulation. It is worth noting 
that Denman has already inspired oth-
ers to follow his lead: his daughter, 
Lesa, served in the U.S. Army just like 
he did. Let’s hope that many others are 
inspired to serve by his example. 
In every aspect of life, Rangers lead 
the way. Denman Wolfe took this 
motto to heart during his long life. 
Now he is leading the way again, going 
ahead of us to our eternal home. May 
he rest in peace.

Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities

SAN, and Ms. WARREN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation: 
S. RES. 492 
Whereas athletic participation helps de-
velop self-discipline, initiative, confidence, 
and leadership skills, and opportunities for 
athletic participation should be available to 
all individuals; 
Whereas, because the people of the United 
States remain committed to protecting 
equality, it is imperative to eliminate the 
existing disparities between male and female 
youth athletic programs; 
Whereas the share of athletic participation 
opportunities of high school girls has in-
creased more than sixfold since the enact-
ment of title IX of the Education Amend-
ments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘title IX’’), but high 
school girls still experience— 
(1) a lower share of athletic participation 
opportunities than high school boys; and 
(2) a lower level of athletic participation 
opportunities than high school boys enjoyed 
almost 50 years ago; 
Whereas female participation in college 
sports has nearly tripled since the enact-
ment of title IX, but female college athletes 
still only comprise 44 percent of the total 
collegiate athlete population; 
Whereas, in 1972, women coached more 
than 90 percent of collegiate women’s teams, 
but now women coach less than 50 percent of 
all collegiate women teams, and there is a 
need to restore women to those positions to 
ensure fair representation and provide role 
models for young female athletes; 
Whereas the long history of women in 
sports in the United States— 
(1) features many contributions made by 
female athletes that have enriched the na-
tional life of the United States; and 
(2) includes inspiring figures, such as Ger-
trude Ederle, Wilma Rudolph, Althea Gibson, 
Mildred Ella ‘‘Babe’’ Didrikson Zaharias, and 
Patty Berg, who overcame difficult obstacles 
in their own lives— 
(A) to advance participation by women in 
sports; and 
(B) to set positive examples for the gen-
erations of female athletes who continue 
to inspire people in the United States 
today; 
Whereas the United States must do all it 
can to support the bonds built between all 
athletes to break down the barriers of dis-
crimination, inequality, and injustice; 
Whereas girls and young women in minor-
ity communities are doubly disadvantaged 
because— 
(1) schools in minority communities have 
fewer athletic opportunities than schools in 
other communities; and 
(2) the limited resources for athletic oppor-
tunities in minority communities are not 
evenly distributed between male and female 
students; 
Whereas the 5-time World Cup champion 
United States Women’s National Soccer 
Team is leading the fight for equal pay for 
female athletes; 
Whereas, with the recent enactment of 
laws such as the Protecting Young Victims 
from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Author-
ization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–126; 132 
Stat. 318), Congress has taken steps— 
(1) to protect female athletes from the 
crime of sexual abuse; and 
(2) to empower athletes to report sexual 
abuse when it occurs; and 
Whereas, with increased participation by 
women and girls in sports, it is more impor-
tant than ever to ensure the safety and well- 
being of athletes by protecting them from 
the crime of sexual abuse, which has harmed 
so many young athletes within youth ath-
letic organizations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports— 
(1) observing ‘‘National Girls & Women in 
Sports Day’’ on February 5, 2020, to recog-
nize— 
(A) the female athletes who represent 
schools, universities, and the United States 
in their athletic pursuits; and 
(B) the vital role that the people of the 
United States have in empowering girls and 
women in sports; 
(2) marking the observation of National 
Girls & Women in Sports Day with appro-
priate programs and activities, including 
legislative efforts— 
(A) to ensure equal pay for female athletes; 
and 
(B) to protect young athletes from the 
crime of sexual abuse so that future genera-
tions of female athletes will not have to ex-
perience the pain that so many female ath-
letes have had to endure; and 
(3) all ongoing efforts— 
(A) to promote equality in sports, includ-
ing equal pay and equal access to athletic 
opportunities for girls and women; and 
(B) to support the commitment of the 
United States to expanding athletic partici-
pation for all girls and future generations of 
women athletes.

SENATE RESOLUTION 493—TO AU-
THORIZE 
TESTIMONY, 
DOCU-
MENTS, AND REPRESENTATION 
IN 
UNITED 
STATES 
V. 
STAHLNECKER 
Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself and 
Mr. SCHUMER) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 493 
Whereas, in the case of United States v. 
Stahlnecker, Cr. No. 19–394, pending in the 
United States District Court for the Central 
District of California, the prosecution has re-
quested the production of testimony, and, if 
necessary, documents from Sarah Harms, an 
employee of the office of Senator Sherrod 
Brown, Leah Uhrig, a former employee of 
that office, and, Kylie Rutherford, an em-
ployee of the office of Senator Shelley Moore 
Capito; 
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 
704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the 
Senate may direct its counsel to represent 
current and former employees of the Senate 
with respect to any subpoena, order, or re-
quest for testimony relating to their official 
responsibilities; 
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of 
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under 
the control or in the possession of the Senate 
may, by the judicial or administrative proc-
ess, be taken from such control or possession 
but by permission of the Senate; and 
Whereas, when it appears that evidence 
under the control or in the possession of the 
Senate may promote the administration of 
justice, the Senate will take such action as 
will promote the ends of justice consistent 
with the privileges of the Senate: Now, 
therefore be it 
Resolved, That Sarah Harms and Leah 
Uhrig, current and former employees, respec-
tively, of Senator Brown’s office, and Kylie 
Rutherford, a current employee of Senator 
Capito’s office, and any other current or 
former employee of the Senators’ offices 
from whom relevant evidence may be nec-
essary, are authorized to testify and produce 
documents in the case of United States v. 
Stahlnecker, except concerning matters for 
which a privilege should be asserted. 
SEC. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is author-
ized to represent any current or former em-
ployees of Senators Brown and Capito in con-
nection with the production of evidence au-
thorized in section one of this resolution. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
behalf of myself and the distinguished 
Democratic leader, Mr. SCHUMER, I 
send to the desk a resolution author-
izing the production of testimony, doc-
uments, and representation by the Sen-
ate Legal Counsel, and ask for its im-
mediate consideration. 
Mr. President, this resolution con-
cerns a request for evidence in a crimi-
nal action pending in California Fed-
eral district court. In this action, the 
defendant is charged with making 
threatening telephone calls last year to 
the Washington, D.C. offices of Senator 
SHERROD BROWN and Senator SHELLEY 
MOORE CAPITO. Trial is scheduled to 
commence on February 11, 2020. 
The prosecution is seeking testimony 
at trial from three Senate witnesses 
who received the telephone calls at 
issue: current employees of Senator 
BROWN’s and Senator CAPITO’s offices 
and a former employee of Senator 
BROWN’s office. Senators BROWN
and 
CAPITO would like to cooperate with 
this request by providing relevant em-
ployee testimony and, if necessary, 
documents from their offices. 
The enclosed resolution would au-
thorize those staffers, and any other

HONORING BURKE DALTON 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Burke Dalton. 
Burke is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 96, and earning 
the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Burke has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Burke has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Burke has contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Burke orga-
nized and sold memorabilia from the archives 
of Village of Jameson, Missouri, as a fund-
raiser for the Village. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Burke Dalton for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout. 
HONORING MARY BUTLER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mary Butler and 
to celebrate her retirement after 27 years of 
public service to Napa County. 
Ms. Butler began her career when she grad-
uated from Sonoma State University with a 
Bachelor’s in Psychology and a Master’s in 
Counseling. Since then, her tenure has been 
marked by both practicality and purpose. As a 
crisis worker, she began her career managing 
children’s mental health at the Child Welfare 
Services Court Unit and supervised behavioral 
health for their Mental Health Divisions. 
In 2002, Ms. Butler led the Napa County 
Probation Department where she championed 
important issues like implementing Evidence 
Based Practice (EBP), a practice designed to 
identify and treat the reasons people commit 
crime, and was instrumental in the passing of 
AB 109, legislation that transferred jurisdiction 
of juvenile offenders from the state govern-
ment to the county government. Her passion 
for restorative justice is a mark of compassion 
that has set the tone for the future of juvenile 
justice in Napa County and across the State of 
California. 
As the President of the Chief Probation Offi-
cers of California, she was responsible for 
opening the Napa County Juvenile Justice 
Center. Through Ms. Butler’s efforts and lead-
ership, Napa County has effectively diverted 
youth offenders from juvenile hall and left sig-
nificantly more juvenile hall beds empty. And 
now, after 17 years of service as the Chief 
Probation Officer, Ms. Butler is the current, 
longest-tenured Chief in the State of Cali-
fornia. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to Mary Butler’s 
work, many children have been taught how to 
succeed regardless of their circumstances. 
She is a community hero, visionary and an ex-
ample of public service for us all. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor Mary But-
ler here today.

HONORING FRANK OWEN OF 
CARBONDALE, IL 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Frank Owen of Carbondale, Illinois upon 
the celebration of his 100th birthday. Frank 
has lived an eventful and fruitful life filled with 
laughs, family, and a commitment to his coun-
try and community. 
Born January 12, 1920, Frank has collected 
a century’s worth of memories, many of which 
began with his childhood in and around 
Carbondale. In fact, his family doctor had to 
trudge through snow on horseback to reach 
Frank’s mother in labor and help deliver the 
baby. When World War II broke out, Frank 
selflessly joined in the effort as a member of 
the U.S. Navy. 
He is widely regarded as a great storyteller 
who loves to give back to his friends and 
neighbors. In years past, Frank has visited nu-
merous local schools to tell students about his 
experiences during the Great Depression and 
teach them the lessons he learned along the 
way. He spent his recent birthday celebrating, 
drinking and eating with his children and doz-
ens of friends at his local church. I can think 
of no better way to mark a milestone. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Frank Owen for this great milestone. On 
behalf of Southern Illinois, happy birthday.

HONORING PASSAIC CHIEF OF 
POLICE LUIS GUZMAN 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise on 
this year’s Dominicans on the Hill Day to rec-
ognize an invaluable member of the City of 
Passaic community, Chief of Police Luis 
Guzman. Chief Guzman is an accomplished, 
twenty-nine-year veteran of the City of Passaic 
Police Department, where he rose through the 
ranks to be appointed as the first ever Domini-
can-born Chief of Police of the City of Passaic 
on July 10, 2017. 
Chief Guzman began his law enforcement 
career as a correction officer with the Passaic 
County Sheriff’s Department in January 1990. 
Later that year he was hired as a police officer 
by the City of Passaic, becoming the first Do-
minican-born officer in the city’s history. While 
in the New Jersey State Police Academy, he 
received the Distinguished Graduate Award for 
ranking at the top of his class. He served as 
a beat officer for the subsequent three years 
and a patrol officer for the next four before 
being assigned to the Detective Bureau in the 
Passaic County Sheriff’s Department as a 
criminal investigator. 
In February 2000, Chief Guzman was pro-
moted to Sergeant and assigned to supervise 
detectives, concurrently working in the patrol 
division of his department’s Community Polic-
ing Unit. In October 2004, he was promoted to 
Lieutenant, where he held the position of 
Commander of several patrol shifts, the Detec-
tive Bureau, and the Internal Affairs Division. 
In September 2011, Chief Guzman was pro-
moted to Captain and was assigned to com-
mander of all uniformed divisions. In October 
2013, he was promoted to Deputy Chief and 
assigned to oversee the operations division. In 
July 2017, Chief Guzman was made the first 
ever Dominican-born Chief of Police in the 
City of Passaic, promoted by Mayor Hector 
Carlos Lora, also of Dominican heritage. 
During his tenure at the helm of the Passaic 
Police Department, Chief Guzman has man-
aged a department that has presided over a 
substantial reduction in crime. 
For over twenty-five years, Chief Guzman 
has given back to his community through one 
of his foremost passions, baseball. Chief 
Guzman has volunteered to coach youth 
baseball from T-ball to the American Legion 
League in the City of Passaic. He has regu-
larly organized police softball and basketball 
games with members of the City of Passaic 
community. 
Chief Guzman has further demonstrated his 
spirit of giving back through his time as an ad-
junct professor at Passaic County Community 
College, where he has taught Criminal Justice 
for the past fifteen years. 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Law En-
forcement Caucus, I am honored to recognize 
Chief Luis Guzman, who has been a tremen-
dous leader, mentor, and public servant in the 
City of Passaic. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, Chief Guzman’s coworkers, family 
and friends, all those whose lives he has 
touched, and me, in recognizing the tireless 
dedication and steadfast service of Chief of 
Police Luis Guzman. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
‘‘BOB’’ M. SANDERS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of my friend, Mr. Robert 
‘‘Bob’’ M. Sanders, who passed away on De-
cember 17, 2019. Bob was a selfless public 
servant and hardworking American citizen, 
who left an impact on those who had the 
pleasure of knowing him. 
Bob was born in Tulare, California and 
raised in Merced. He graduated from Merced 
High School and went on to attend California 
Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. Bob 
joined the California National Guard and at-
tended artillery school in Fort Still, Oklahoma. 
On his flight home after his initial service, he 
was seated next to California Assemblyman 
Gordan Winton, which would send his career 
path in a new direction. Assemblyman Winton 
hired Bob as his aide in his Sacramento office 
and he also worked on his campaign in 1966. 
After Assemblyman Winton declined to run for 
reelection, Bob ran for the seat himself. During 
the 1968 California primary, Bob traveled the 
Central Valley with presidential candidate Rob-
ert Kennedy, one of his most treasured memo-
ries. 
Bob met the love of his life, Suzanne White 
while they both worked for the United Teach-
ers of Los Angeles. Bob eventually moved on 
to work as Chief of Staff for Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. Later in life, he 
worked for Rusty Areias and served as my 
first district director after my election to the 
House of Representatives. Assembly Speak-
er’s Office and the Senate Democratic Cau-
cus. Bob’s impressive career made him a well- 
respected figure in California politics. 
Outside of politics, Bob enjoyed poetry, 
sports, and wrote scripts, directed and did 
voiceovers for military training films. Bob loved 
his family most of all and enjoyed being 
around his beloved friends. His knowledge of 
political trivia and baseball statistics was un-
matched. 
Bob was preceded in death by his father 
Marvin, mother Anna, and his younger sister, 
Jo Anna. 
Bob is survived by his wife, Suzanne, 
daughter Erica, by his brothers Jim and Jeff, 
and his many cousins, nieces, and nephews. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of my dear friend, Rob-
ert ‘‘Bob’’ M. Sanders. His commitment and 
dedication to the State of California was clear. 
We join his family and friends in honoring his 
great life.

HONORING LAURALYN CASTLE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON

Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Lauralyn Castle 
for years of extraordinary public service and to 
celebrate her retirement from the Sonoma 
County Veterans Services Office. 
Mrs. Castle attended Sacramento State Uni-
versity where she earned a Bachelor of 
Science in Communications. She has used 
her ability to connect with others in her impor-
tant work at the Sonoma County Veterans 
Services Office. As the Senior Veterans Serv-
ice Specialist, Mrs. Castle has spent over a 
decade supporting and encouraging veterans 
and their families in meaningful and lasting 
ways. She recognizes the incredible sacrifices 
that our nation’s men and women in uniform 
make, and she works tirelessly each day to 
ensure that every veteran receives the proper 
care and benefits that they are entitled to. 
Mrs. Castle is extraordinary in many ways. 
She consistently makes time to serve in var-
ious capacities in our community. She has 
spent years helping those that struggle with 
addiction as a mentor for Alcoholics Anony-
mous. She is an active member in her local 
church congregation where she enjoys serving 
as a liturgist. Those who know her best say 
that she is direct and honest. She has a big 
heart and is willing to do everything in her 
power to help the people around her. 
Madam Speaker, Mrs. Castle is the kind of 
citizen we should all strive to be. Her retire-
ment marks the end of a decade of committed 
service. Though her important contributions at 
Sonoma County Veterans Services Office will 
be greatly missed, we know and trust that she 
will continue to devote her time and energy to 
serving all in our community. It is therefore fit-
ting and proper that we honor her here today.

February 5, 2020 
passed away Tuesday, January 14, 2020. A 
Vietnam veteran and renaissance man, Mayor 
Brooks served in the U.S. military for 30 
years. His greatest legacy as mayor was es-
tablishing the Chandler Performing and Visual 
Arts Center, a welcoming and innovative per-
formance space that bonds our community to-
gether through arts and culture. 
Jerrell W. Brooks was born in San Antonio, 
Texas, on November 23, 1930, to Marion and 
Viola Brooks. After moving to Arizona as a 
child, Brooks attended Phoenix Union High 
School. Just shy of graduation, Brooks en-
listed in the U.S. Marines after being inspired 
by those who served in the second World 
War. After his discharge in 1950, Brooks re-
turned to Arizona and completed a construc-
tion engineering degree at Arizona State Uni-
versity in 1954. Following graduation, he was 
commissioned in the U.S. Air Force through 
the university’s ROTC program. Brooks retired 
as a colonel after serving in Vietnam, in 1977 
after 30 years of service. 
Brooks moved to Chandler in his retirement 
and began to observe that the city’s infrastruc-
ture could not keep pace with rapid growth 
and development in the community. It inspired 
him to become active in local politics. Brooks 
won a seat on the Chandler City Council in 
1982 and was elected mayor just two years 
later. True to his word, during his four-year 
term as mayor, Mayor Brooks paved roads, 
built infrastructure, and annexed land in south 
Chandler to build new streets and utility infra-
structure to serve future residents of the city. 
His lasting legacy and the crown jewel of 
Chandler is the Chandler Performing and Vis-
ual Arts Center. Mayor Brooks advocated and 
fought for a performing arts center that would 
attract new employers, entertainers, and fami-
lies to Chandler and transfonn a quiet agricul-
tural town into a thriving, family-friendly, di-
verse and welcoming community. He lived to 
see his vision come to fruition. Future genera-
tions of Chandler residents will undoubtedly be 
affected by the cultural opportunities available 
in their own city thanks to Mayor Brooks’ vi-
sion for the Center. 
Thank you to Mayor Brooks, and Godspeed.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
VISIT 
HUNTINGTON 
BEACH 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Visit Huntington 
Beach on the celebration of its 30th Anniver-
sary and the opening of a new office. 
Visit Huntington Beach was formed in 1989 
as a destination marketing program and has 
grown into the only local organization charged 
with the responsibility of promoting tourism 
and encouraging its continued growth in the 
City. Its mission is to use Huntington Beach’s 
Surf City USA brand to maintain the City’s sta-
tus as the quintessential California beach des-
tination. Since its founding thirty years ago, 
Visit Huntington Beach has successfully lived 
up to this mission and showed the wonders of 
Huntington Beach to the country and the 
world. 
In 2018 alone, overnight visitors generated 
$91 million in tax revenue and generated 
nearly $20 million for the City’s general fund. 
This revenue is vital to funding critical commu-
nity services, such as police, fire, public 
works, and parks. 
I ask all Members to join me in recognizing 
the extraordinary work and contributions of 
Visit Huntington Beach and their efforts to en-

HONORING 
JANICE 
DUNNE 
FOR 
HER 
DEDICATED 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE COMMUNITY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, the Erie County Democratic Committee will 
gather on Friday, February 7th to honor Janice 
Dunne with the Joseph F. Crangle Legacy 
Award. The award is named for our legendary 
former county and state chairman and is the 
gold standard for local Democrats; it rightfully 
raises Janice’s name among the great leaders 
of our party and commemorates her service 
both to her community and to the Democratic 
Party. 
Janice has played an integral role in her 
hometown Democratic committee for the last 
forty years, as a member of its Nominating 
Committee, Executive Committee, and Vice 
Chair. Never afraid to get her hands dirty, Jan-
ice engages in all aspects of grassroots polit-
ical work from campaigning and canvassing, 
to fundraising and recruiting new members to 
the party. 
Ms. Dunne has been on the frontlines of 
local, state, and national campaigns since she 
became involved in politics in 1980. Through-
out her career, she has singlehandedly col-
lected thousands of signatures door-to-door, 
planted hundreds of yard signs, raised thou-
sands of dollars for local candidates, and la-
bored tirelessly on the issues central to the 
Democratic Party platform. 
In 1992, Janice made her way to public of-
fice as Town of Amherst Deputy Clerk, a title 
she would hold for the next five years. From 
there, she worked in the Amherst Town Su-
pervisor’s office until she ultimately retired 
from town government in 1999. Even though 
she was no longer working directly in local 
government, Janice’s passion for public serv-
ice did not wane. 
Janice went on to serve as a delegate in 
multiple National Democratic Conventions. 
Janice was elected to travel to New York City 
in 1992 to be a delegate for Jerry Brown. 
Eight years later, she ran again and was elect-
ed to attend the convention in Los Angeles as 
a delegate for Bill Bradley. She was reelected 
once more in 2008 to be a delegate for then 
Senator Obama at the National Democratic 
Convention in Denver. 
Although she has officially retired, Janice 
still spends her time serving the community as 
one of the founding members of the Eggerts-
ville Community Organization. As a member of 
the ECO Steering Committee, Janice works to 
reinvigorate Eggertsville by enforcing often ig-
nored building codes and partnering with the 
Town of Amherst to begin the construction of 
a community center in Eggertsville. Beyond 
these efforts, she is a clerk at the local Board 
of Elections and serves as a member of the 
Amherst Democratic Committee and the Erie 
County Executive Committee. 
Janice accumulated a lifetime’s worth of ac-
complishments while simultaneously raising 
two beautiful daughters: Valerie, an accom-
plished local photographer, and Tricia, who 
works in the Erie County Probation Office. 
Janice’s dedication to her country, her com-
munity, her family, and her party represents all 
that is great about Western New York, and I 
am thankful for the opportunity to honor her 
and to have the House take note of the many 
positive contributions she has made through-
out our community.

LIFE AND LEGACY OF HON. JOHN 
BUCKNER 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, the Cherry 
Creek Schools Board of Education recently 
named the Honorable John Buckner as one of 
the newest inductees to the Legacy Stadium 
Educational Leadership Wall of Fame. This 
honor is so very well-earned, and I join in 
Cherry 
Creek 
Schools’ 
lauding 
of 
Mr. 
Buckner’s life and legacy. 
State Representative Buckner served as a 
principal in Colorado schools for decades and 
was a lifelong advocate for equal access to 
meaningful education for every student across 
our state, including by leading his district’s 
work in the areas of equity and inclusive ex-
cellence and as Chair of the House Education 
Committee. He carried these values not only 
as a school administrator, but also throughout 
his time as a member of the Colorado State 
House. As one example of his countless sub-
stantial contributions, in the 2014 state legisla-
tive session he sponsored the annual school 
finance bill and successfully increased funding 
for English language learners and created an 
additional 5,000 pre-K and full-day kinder-
garten slots for at-risk children. 
Rep. Buckner was a mentor to countless 
Coloradans, myself included. He served his 
community with dedicated grace and thought-
ful policymaking, and set an example for what 
steadfast, meaningful leadership looks like for 
so many future leaders. That legacy continues 
each day through Rep. Buckner’s wife Janet 
who, since his passing in 2015, has held his 
State House seat and taken up the mantle on 
countless issues that John championed. 
I am so pleased that Rep. Buckner is re-
ceiving this well-earned honor, and I join in 
this recognition alongside so many people and 
organizations in Colorado who continue to 
benefit from the leadership he demonstrated 
each and every day.

IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. ANNE 
COX CHAMBERS UPON HER DEATH 
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I want to recognize the life and accomplish-
ments of Anne Cox Chambers, who passed 
away on Friday, January 31, 2020, at the age 
of 100. 
Mrs. Anne Cox Chambers was a member of 
the namesake Atlanta-based media company, 
Cox Enterprises—an instrumental medium for 
news reporting, talk shows, music, and sports 
in Georgia and across the country. She took 
on a leadership role in Cox as a member of 
the Cox Board of Directors and as the chair-
woman of Atlanta Newspapers. 
She took her knowledge and expertise from 
those roles to pave new roads for women in 
Georgia: She became Atlanta’s first female 
bank director when she joined the board of 
Fulton National Bank, and she was the first 
woman to serve as a director of the Atlanta 
Chamber of Commerce. 
During her life, she chose to give back 
every way she could, becoming a philan-
thropist for causes close to her heart. Mrs. 
Chambers supported institutions that many At-
lanta citizens enjoy today, like the Atlanta 
Symphony Orchestra, the Atlanta Botanical 
Garden, the Atlanta Speech School, the High 
Museum of Art, and the Atlanta Humane Soci-
ety. Her support for the latter culminated in the 
honor of its annual award bearing her name, 
the Anne Cox Chambers Humane Heroine 
award. 
Anne embodied what it meant to be a public 
servant. Under President Jimmy Carter, she 
was appointed Ambassador to Belgium. Her 
work led to a stronger relationship between 
the United States, Georgia, and Belgium. Bel-
gium’s King Baudouin I recognized her con-
tributions by presenting her with the Order of 
the Crown, one of Belgium’s highest honors. 
While Mrs. Chambers may be gone, her leg-
acy will not be forgotten. Her love and service 
for Georgia and her country were inspirational 
and her leadership as a woman paved the 
way for other women who will come after her. 
She set an example for us all of what it means 
to be someone who gives more to others than 
she takes in return. 
I want to offer my deepest condolences to 
the extended family and friends of Anne Cox 
Chambers during this time.

HONORING DR. AMARJIT SINGH 
MARWAH 
HON. BRAD SHERMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, on the oc-
casion of his 94th birthday, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Amarjit Singh Marwah, a pioneer in 
the Indian American community and a Los An-
geles civic icon. 
Since coming to the United States in 1953 
as a Fulbright scholar, Dr. Marwah has been 
a trailblazer. Drawing on an educational pedi-
gree that included fellowships from the 
Guggenheim Foundation, the University of Illi-
nois, Chicago (where he pursued an MS in 
Pathology), Howard University (where he com-
pleted a two-year program in Doctor in Dental 
Surgery), and a professorship at the University 
of Southern California, Dr. Marwah became 
the first Indian doctor in the United States to 
obtain a license to practice dentistry. 
Dr. Marwah also helped make U.S. history 
through his work on Dalip Singh Saund’s con-
gressional campaign. As a young aide to the 
candidate, Dr. Marwah helped propel Saund to 
victory in the 1956 election, ushering in the 
first Sikh American, the first Indian American 
and the first Asian American ever elected to 
the U.S. Congress. 
Being a pioneer, Dr. Marwah has worked to 
encourage and grow the nascent Sikh Amer-
ican community of Southern California, of 
which he is a member. For many years, his 
Baldwin Hills home served as a place of res-
pite for the immigrant community; and Dr. 
Marwah founded just the third Sikh Temple in 
the United States, whose location in Holly-
wood now bears the name ‘‘Dr. Amarjit Singh 
Marwah Square.’’ 
As a friend and advisor of Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley, Dr. Marwah made an in-
delible mark on Los Angeles civic life. Dr. 
Marwah was appointed a Los Angeles City 
Commissioner in 1975 and served for 18 
years. He chaired the Cultural Heritage Com-
mission and the Hollywood Art Commission, 
and he helped to preserve over 300 sites, in-
cluding the Walk of Fame and the Roosevelt 
Hotel. 
As a public servant, a leader in the Indian 
American community and a philanthropist, Dr. 
Marwah has made a positive impact on count-
less people around the world. Dr. Marwah was 
supported in all these endeavors by his late 
wife, Kuljit Kaur Marwah, as well as his three 
daughters and their spouses and grand-
children. 
I wish my friend Dr. Amarjit Singh Marwah 
a very happy and healthy 94th birthday.

HONORING KERRY SMITH 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kerry Smith 
for years of exceptional public service to the 
young people of Lake County, California and 
to honor her as the Lake County Teacher of 
the Year. 
Ms. Smith was born and raised in Lake 
County, 
California. 
She 
graduated 
from 
Kelseyville High School before earning her AA 
in Child Development at Santa Rosa Junior 
College. She attended Sonoma State Univer-
sity, where she graduated with a degree in 
Environmental Studies and a Multiple Subject 
Teaching Credential with an emphasis in early 
childhood education. These outstanding cre-
dentials coupled with her passion and dili-
gence enable Ms. Smith to connect with her 
students and enlarge their understanding. 
Kerry Smith is outstanding in many ways. 
As a Resource Teacher for students grades 
six through eight at Mountain Vista Middle 
School, it is Ms. Smith’s responsibility to pro-
vide support to students who need additional 
help in math. In this role, she has spear-
headed a model that allows a collaboration of 
math teachers to help struggling students. 
This approach has been so successful that 
nearly all her students are no longer in need 
of additional help and are performing well in 
their respective math classes. She not only 
has the instructional skills required to be a 
highly effective teacher, but also holds those 
intangible qualities that are at the heart of a 
successful educator. She is beloved by her 
students, often described as funny, kind, excit-
ing, friendly, and positive. 
Ms. Smith is a natural leader. She has 
mentored many new educators throughout her 
career and continues to inspire those around 
her with her joyful attitude and dedication to 
her students. Teachers travel from across the 
school district to observe Ms. Smith in her 
classroom and they always leave impressed. 
She is the model of a lifelong learner, one that 
is constantly striving to improve her own prac-
tice and eager to try a new approach. 
Madam Speaker, there is not another indi-
vidual who exemplifies the profession of 
teaching better than Kerry Smith. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor Ms. Kerry 
Smith here today.

RECOGNIZING AIDAN COHEN AS 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 5, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, 
it’s my honor to recognize 17-year old North 
County resident, Aidan Cohen, as my Con-
stituent of the Month for January. In a moment 
of quick instinct, Aidan heroically rushed to 
help his next door neighbor, pulling him from 
his burning home and saving his life. 
On the evening of December 12, 2019, 
Aidan Cohen and his older brother Ryan were 
enjoying a late-night snack when the power 
suddenly went out. Soon after, the brothers 
heard an explosion and rushed outside to find 
their next door neighbor’s home engulfed in 
flames. 
The brothers shouted the owner’s name, but 
received no response. Overcome by smoke he 
had collapsed on the hallway floor. Aidan 
spotted him through a window, and without 
hesitation, broke the back door open and 
pulled the neighbor out to safety. 
Everyone involved was grateful for our local 
first responders who were on the scene min-
utes later to administer first aid to the neighbor 
and save Aidan’s family home. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region a 
stronger place for everyone to live and thrive. 
Aidan’s selflessness is an extraordinary re-
minder that in severe times of need, setting 
aside our own fears to assist one another is 
a crucial foundation of community. I thank 
Aidan for being an exemplary model of true 
neighborly kindness in California’s 49th Dis-
trict.
