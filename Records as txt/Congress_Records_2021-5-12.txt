Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2021 
No. 82 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CORREA).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
May 12, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable LUIS J. 
CORREA to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
SLAVERY REMEMBRANCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
the British statesman, Sir Winston 
Churchill, is credited with having stat-
ed that those who fail to learn from 
history are doomed to repeat it. This is 
the reason why, in part, I will be intro-
ducing legislation for a slavery remem-
brance day. Currently, no such day ex-
ists in the United States. 
National days of remembrance pro-
vide an effective means to honor those 
impacted by horrific events. They pre-
vent the tragedy from fading from our 
memories by educating the generations 
to come, and they highlight the mod-
ern-day implications of such events. 
My resolution would provide a day 
for slavery remembrance, and the lan-
guage of the resolution would com-
memorate the lives of all enslaved peo-
ple, while condemning the act and the 
perpetration as well as perpetuation of 
slavery in the United States of Amer-
ica and across the world. 
The resolution would discuss the 
Middle Passage, the Underground Rail-
road, and the lives of Nat Turner, Har-
riet Tubman, and John Brown. It would 
also make the 18 persons who were 
elected to Congress from the Recon-
struction era as honorary cosponsors of 
the resolution in a posthumous way. 
I am proud to do this, and I ask that 
all Members please consider becoming 
original cosponsors of the resolution. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, equal justice under the law is 
a cornerstone of our American democ-
racy. At home in Pennsylvania and 
around our country, our communities 
are blessed with dedicated law enforce-
ment officers who work daily to pro-
tect and to serve. During National Po-
lice Week, the American people honor 
and thank the law enforcement officers 
who keep us safe each and every day. 
While no organization is perfect, our 
local police work hard to uphold the 
law and maintain peace in our commu-
nities. As Chambersburg Police Chief 
Ron Camacho told me just this week, 
good police forces are centered on pro-
tecting and learning how to protect 
better. He said that good police forces 
are constantly evolving and improving. 
I wholeheartedly agree with my 
friend, the chief of police in Chambers-
burg, and Congress must do our part to 
support these heroes. Instead of talk-
ing about defunding the police, we 
should be working to better train and 
equip law enforcement officers to do 
the job that we have entrusted them to 
do. 
As we move forward, the American 
people know that Republicans are lead-
ing commonsense, bipartisan solutions. 
For over a year, Senator TIM SCOTT 
and Congressman PETE STAUBER have 
led our efforts to improve trans-
parency, accountability, and training. 
Rather than defund or dismantle the 
police, the Justice Act will enact bi-
partisan reforms to better equip these 
brave Americans who serve our com-
munities. I was proud to cosponsor that 
legislation, and I encourage my col-
leagues on all sides of the political 
spectrum to join us in this common-
sense approach. 
Democrats say that they want to 
work together on police reform. Now is 
the chance. Getting this right today is 
critical for the future of policing in our 
Nation. We cannot allow the radical 
left to erode trust in the justice system 
and degrade the good name of the pub-
lic servants for the sake of their own 
woke agenda. Right now, our law en-
forcement community is facing unprec-
edented attacks. Every day, the left 
threatens to abandon these heroes who 
protect us. 
Chief Camacho leads an exemplary 
police force in Franklin County, Penn-
sylvania. He and the vast majority of 
the law enforcement community go 
above and beyond to protect our com-
munities. 
As a nation, we must never turn our 
backs on the police. We must never 
defund the police. During National Po-
lice Week and throughout this year, it 
is my privilege to stand with the thin 
blue line, and I will always back the 
blue.

OUR DEDICATED STAFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. KILMER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, staff are 
the backbone of this institution. In 
fact, the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress, over the course 
of the last few weeks, has had hearings 
specifically related to how this institu-
tion can recruit, retain, and have more 
diverse staffs. 
The staffs who work in Congress are 
dedicated public servants who are here 
because they want to do meaningful 
work for our country. Today, I want to 
rise to say thank you to some very tal-
ented and very special staffers who 
were instrumental to the success of the 
Select Committee on the Moderniza-
tion of Congress in the 116th Congress: 
Allie Neill, Jake Olson, Danielle Stew-
art, 
Mariah 
Harding, 
and 
SoRelle 
Gaynor. 
As chair of the Select Committee on 
the Modernization of Congress, I was 
fortunate to have Ms. Neill and Mr. 
Olson at the helm leading our staff and 
guiding our members through an in-
credibly productive 2 years. Their dedi-
cation to our bipartisan mission along 
with their institutional expertise was 
critical to the committee’s success. To 
their credit, when they came in to do 
the work of our committee, they 
weren’t wearing red jerseys or blue jer-
seys. They were wearing jerseys that 
said: Let’s try to make Congress work 
better for the American people. 
On top of that, Ms. Stewart did an 
extraordinary job of amplifying the 
work of our committee and sharing it 
with the American people. Ms. Harding 
handled the critical behind-the-scenes 
work like a pro. Under Ms. Gaynor’s di-
rection the committee produced an 
outstanding final report for the 116th 
Congress. 
These staffers exemplify public serv-
ice at its finest, and I want to rise 
today to thank them for their con-
tributions. 
f 
THE RACIST LEFT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, rac-
ism is the practice of according rights 
and privileges to an individual not 
based on equality under the law, but, 
rather, according to what race that 
person was born. It is antithetical to 
every principle our country was found-
ed upon, from the promise of our Dec-
laration of Independence that all men 
are created equal to the equal protec-
tion clause of our Constitution. It was 
a malignancy we fought a civil war to 
remove. For generations, it has been 
denounced by every American of good-
will for the evil that it is. 
Yet, this dangerous social pathology 
is now rampant in this House. The Ju-
diciary Committee recently adopted a 
measure on a party-line vote to estab-
lish a commission with the avowed pur-
pose of enshrining racism into law 
under the guise of slavery reparations. 
The biased composition of this com-
mission—there is not a single Repub-
lican appointment—lays its intent bare 
for all to see. It is designed to reach 
into the dead past, revive its most ma-
levolent 
conflicts, 
and 
reintroduce 
them into our age. 
I cannot imagine a more divisive, po-
larizing, or unjust measure than one 
that would use government force to re-
quire people who never owned slaves to 
pay reparations to people who never 
were slaves—based not on anything 
they did, but solely because of what 
race they were born. 
History offers us an inexhaustible 
supply of grievances and injustices 
that are powerful enough to stoke 
hatreds and resentments that can tear 
any society apart. That is what this 
movement is all about. It is evil in its 
effect, if not in its intent. 
Lincoln often pointed out that our 
country was born into a world where 
slavery was an established institution. 
The American Founders reviled it, and 
they placed principles in our founding 
documents that they were confident 
would ultimately place that wicked in-
stitution upon the course of ultimate 
extinction and would lead to a republic 
where men and women of every race 
and background could, together, enjoy 
the blessings of liberty. Equal justice 
under law means a colorblind society 
where race simply becomes irrelevant, 
and until recently, we had made tre-
mendous progress toward that vision as 
a nation. 
Martin Luther King expressed the 
gold standard of racial harmony: that 
we should be judged by the content of 
our character and not the color of our 
skin. It is the equal protection of the 
law and the vision of a colorblind soci-
ety stretching from the American 
Founders to Lincoln and King that is 
now under attack by the racist left. 
Yes, there are racists in our society. 
There are racists of all colors in every 
society; it is the baser side of human 
nature. But no nation has struggled 
harder to transcend that nature and 
isolate and marginalize its racists than 
have Americans. 
Yes, extremely damaging and foolish 
policies have disproportionately im-
pacted Black communities in recent 
decades. Union-dominated schools that 
have failed to educate our children in 
inner cities, welfare programs that 
have destroyed families, and the with-
drawal of police protection from crime- 
plagued neighborhoods are certainly 
among them. But these policies dev-
astate every community where they 
are practiced, regardless of race. The 
answer is to change those policies, not 
to excuse them because they are ideo-
logically pleasing to the left. 
The racist left is content to ignore 
all of these current ills. It, instead, at-
tempts to set neighbor against neigh-
bor and American against American on 
the basis of their race. They say this is 
healing. It is precisely the opposite. 
They know it. Indeed, they count on it. 
I think all Americans of goodwill and 
of every race and creed have had 
enough of this. We are tired of seeing 
our children taught to hate themselves 
and to hate each other. We are tired of 
seeing our country demonized as racist 
by those whose first and solitary focus 
is on race. We are tired of the lie that 
our Nation is systemically racist when 
it has done more to produce a civil and 
tolerant multiracial society than any 
people in the history of civilization. 
It is long past time that every Amer-
ican of every heritage denounces this 
evil for what it is and to extirpate from 
our civil discourse those race-baiters of 
every persuasion who have polluted our 
national dialogue and corrupted our 
national heritage. 
f 
PROTECT THE RAIZAL PEOPLE OF 
THE SAN ANDRES ARCHIPELAGO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
very strong views about the national 
protest taking place across Colombia 
over the past 2 weeks and the abso-
lutely brutal response against the dem-
onstrators by the Colombian public se-
curity forces. 
But today, I rise about a very dif-
ferent and specific human rights crisis 
in Colombia, one that receives little 
attention in the United States and 
from the international community. I 
am speaking about the plight of the 
Raizal people who have lived for cen-
turies on the islands that make up the 
San Andres archipelago. 
The Raizal are descendants of Pil-
grim settlers, enslaved Africans, Amer- 
Indians, and British emigrants. They 
speak Creole English, and most are 
Protestants. 
However, in a twist of fate char-
acteristic of the history of coloniza-
tion, the islands on which they live— 
San Andres, Ketlina, and Old Provi-
dence—are under the sovereignty of Co-
lombia, whose population is Spanish 
speaking and largely Catholic. It has 
been that way since the 1800s. 
b 1015 
For a long time, the Raizal were left 
largely to their own devices. They were 
self-governed with a self-sustaining 
economy. 
But in the 1950s, the Colombian Gov-
ernment decided to strengthen control 
over the islands by promoting tourism 
and mass migration from the main-
land. The result is that San Andres, the 
largest of the islands, is extremely 
overpopulated. The Raizal have been 
reduced to minority status on that is-
land. And the development for tourism 
has so seriously damaged the pristine 
environment that UNESCO tried to 
protect it by declaring it a biosphere 
reserve in 2000.

But the smaller islands of Old Provi-
dence, accessible only by ferry or small 
plane, and Ketlina, connected by a 
bridge, largely escaped the fate of San 
Andres. The population of both is al-
most entirely Raizal, and their commu-
nities have successfully resisted efforts 
to bring in big development projects or 
build military installations there until 
now. 
The islands were hit very hard by 
Hurricane Iota last November. On Old 
Providence, hundreds of houses were 
damaged and hundreds more destroyed 
completely. 
Colombian 
President 
Ivan 
Duque 
promised to rebuild in 100 days. It has 
now been 6 months. The next hurricane 
season is on the horizon, and recon-
struction is nowhere near complete. 
The delay is partly due to the gov-
ernment’s failure to properly consult 
with those most affected. But what the 
government did do was allow the Co-
lombian Navy to take advantage of the 
crisis and build a new dock, a project 
the community had previously rejected 
due to the risk of environmental dam-
age. 
The navy has installed its dock near 
a fishermen’s co-op whose own dock 
was destroyed by Iota, cutting off its 
members’ access. In response, fisher-
men whose livelihoods are at risk have 
been protesting for 62 days. 
There is a profound difference of vi-
sion between the islanders and the 
mainlanders. The Raizal fear that if 
the government continues to ignore 
them, their way of life in Old Provi-
dence and Ketlina will be overtaken by 
the mainland population, as has hap-
pened in San Andres. That would be a 
major violation of the human rights of 
the Raizal people. 
In 
2004, 
when 
the 
U.N. 
Special 
Rapporteur on racism visited the archi-
pelago, the Raizal communities com-
plained of political discrimination and 
marginalization 
from 
the 
decision-
making processes that affected their 
territory. They also described cultural 
domination by the mainland, for exam-
ple, the exclusive use of Spanish as the 
language of instruction and pressure to 
convert to Catholicism to be able to 
advance economically. 
More than 15 years later, the Colom-
bian Government persists with many of 
the same practices that led the Raizal 
to lodge those human rights com-
plaints. 
It is time to change course. It is time 
to prioritize the human rights of the 
Raizal people. It is time for the govern-
ment to recognize the Raizal as legiti-
mate interlocutors and respect their 
right to protect their ancestral lands. 
I urge the Duque government to ac-
celerate reconstruction so that the 
people have adequate shelter and med-
ical facilities as soon as possible, cer-
tainly before the next hurricane sea-
son. 
I urge the government to stop im-
porting labor from the mainland and, 
instead, employ local Raizal workers. 
I urge the government to remove the 
navy’s new dock, rebuild the co-op’s 
dock instead, and end further mili-
tarization of the islands. 
I urge a thorough review of any U.S. 
Government resources used for post- 
Iota reconstruction to ensure that they 
were expended in full compliance with 
requirements of prior consultation. 
And I encourage the United Nations 
and the Inter-American human rights 
bodies to immediately review the situ-
ation of the Raizal people and issue 
new recommendations to the Colom-
bian Government to ensure that their 
rights are fully protected going for-
ward. 
f 
CELEBRATING GEORGE MILLS’ 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor George Mills, an ex-
traordinary Alabamian I recently met 
in Decatur at a Kiwanis pancake 
breakfast. George is a former World 
War II prisoner of war and will cele-
brate his 100th birthday on May 23. 
The 
youngest 
of 
eight 
children, 
George graduated from Decatur High 
School in 1939. While in high school, 
George worked for Western Union, de-
livering telegrams on his bicycle from 
5 to 11 every night. After high school 
graduation, George sold pianos for 
Forbes Piano Company. 
In 1942, at age 21, George Mills en-
listed in the Army and was assigned to 
Company E, 109th Division under Gen-
eral Omar Bradley, making him a 
member of one of World War II’s best- 
trained divisions. 
Sergeant Mills arrived on Omaha 
Beach 25 days after D-day. For 7 
months, he was in combat and engaged 
in four major battles, including the 
Battle of Normandy, the Battle of the 
Bulge, and the battle at the Hurtgen 
Forest. 
After the Hurtgen Forest battle, 
George and his company were sent to 
the 
Germany-Luxembourg 
border, 
where, one morning, they were awak-
ened by exploding rockets and artil-
lery. His company was surrounded by 
15,000 
Axis 
forces. 
Despite 
over-
whelming odds, they held their ground 
for several days. 
Eventually, Axis forces blew a hole in 
the house Mills was sheltered in. Ba-
zookas and flamethrowers followed, 
setting the entire house on fire. George 
was injured by shrapnel. 
On December 18, 1944, after more 
than 2 years of service, George was cap-
tured by the Germans. After the fight, 
the Germans flattened the surrounding 
town, 
shooting 
civilians 
and 
the 
mayor. 
The Germans interrogated the sol-
diers before taking them to a German 
POW 
camp, 
where 
they 
were 
fingerprinted, photographed, given dog 
tags, and registered as prisoners of 
war. They remained there for 2 days be-
fore the Germans segregated the sol-
diers, sending officers to concentration 
camps, forcing privates to work, and 
sending noncommissioned officers, in-
cluding George, on a 5-month walk 
across Europe that broke their souls 
and their bodies. 
George tells many vivid stories of the 
cold winter, lack of food and sleep, ab-
horrent treatment by their captors, 
and the good friends made along the 
way. 
Thankfully, George was liberated on 
April 14, 1945. 
In October 1945, George was dis-
charged and returned to America. After 
a very long bus ride home, he arrived 
at his Alabama hometown, where his 
sister was so excited to see him that 
she forgot to unlatch the screen door 
and his faithful bulldog nearly broke 
down the door to get to him. 
Four years later, George and his wife, 
Charlie, were married. They enjoyed 66 
years of marriage before Charlie passed 
away in December 2015. 
In 1983, George retired but stayed 
busy, traveling with his wife across 
America, Canada, and Europe, while 
looking up George’s Army buddies 
along the way. 
One of George’s proudest moments 
came on November 16, 2006, when 
France’s President named George Mills 
a Chevalier for his gallantry during the 
liberation of France. 
Vigorous as ever, George is involved 
in the Military Order of the Purple 
Heart, The American Legion, the VFW, 
the Masonic Lodge, the Kiwanis Club, 
and several other community organiza-
tions. 
He is a frequent speaker at several 
local high schools, community organi-
zations, and church groups. A true 
southern gentleman, he is a beloved 
representative of America’s Greatest 
Generation. 
Mr. Speaker, George Mills’ exem-
plary service to America and his local 
community is emblematic of what 
makes America a great nation. 
I wish George Mills the very best as 
he and his family celebrate his 100th 
birthday.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS 
HESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of my incredible friend, 
Tom Hess, a beloved resident of North-
ville, Michigan, who we lost last month 
after a courageous battle with cancer 
at the age of 76. 
Tom was born in Detroit in the sum-
mer of 1944 to Raymond and Jessie 
Hess. 
After 
graduating 
from 
Michigan 
State University in 1966, he joined the 
United States Army, where he attended 
Infantry Officer Candidate School. He 
went on to complete all the training 
necessary to become a Green Beret and 
proudly served his country as a first 
lieutenant during the Vietnam war. 
This was something that Tom was

May 12, 2021 
deeply proud of, his service to the 
country. 
Upon his honorable discharge from 
the Army, Tom returned to Detroit, 
where he graduated from Wayne State 
University Law School and was admit-
ted to both the Michigan and Florida 
Bar Associations. He became the man-
aging partner of a law firm in Daytona 
Beach and had many exciting real es-
tate ventures in Florida before moving 
back to metro Detroit in 1990 to estab-
lish his own firm, where he practiced 
for another 18 years. 
Tom married his exceptional wife, 
Janet, in 1991. Together, they opened 
their hearts and their home in North-
ville to members of our community on 
countless occasions. 
This was the stuff that the Demo-
crats of Western Wayne County are 
made of, and it is what raised me as a 
young candidate for Congress to propel 
me into office. 
Their generosity was boundless and 
their ability to connect people endless. 
It is something that we will remember 
for all of time, in their home, in down-
town Northville, that looked as if it 
was built in the 1800s but was actually 
built by Tom himself. 
With his generous spirit and political 
acumen, Tom was a tireless advocate 
for the causes closest to his heart. He 
cared very deeply about the work being 
done in this Chamber, and he was fo-
cused on efforts to make our democ-
racy more fair, strong, and inclusive 
for generations to come. 
During my final visit to Mr. Hess, 
when I got the opportunity to say 
good-bye to him—because in classic 
Tom Hess fashion, he insisted, as he 
lay in hospice, on having an open, liv-
ing wake—he looked me in the eye and 
said to me that his ultimate wish, his 
dying wish, was to see H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act, signed into law. 
He was passionately committed to 
ensuring the success of our democracy, 
and he recognized the historic oppor-
tunity we have before us right now to 
bring our elections into the 21st cen-
tury and to ensure that everyone has 
the right to vote. He looked me in the 
eye and said: I ask you to tell your col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, but 
most penetratingly, the other side of 
the aisle, to join you in getting H.R. 1 
done. 
Now, we know we have taken the 
H.R. 1 vote in this Chamber, and it is 
going to the Senate. So I send the mes-
sage from Northville, Michigan, as any 
good representative of their constitu-
ents would do: Pass H.R. 1 now. Send 
this to the President’s desk for his sig-
nature. 
Tom showed us a life well-lived. For 
if cleanliness and perfection of home is 
godliness, that was Tom and Janet. 
The Wall Street Journal in August 
2020, just last year, reflecting on the 
hobbies that people were taking up in 
the pandemic, shared stories about peo-
ple building model trains in the bottom 
of their homes, and that was something 
that Tom already had in his home. He 
had this model train station that we 
would, during the pandemic, go down 
and look at. He disassembled it and 
gave it to a museum before he passed 
away. So, he beat the pandemic trend. 
We know that Tom is survived by his 
loving wife of 29 years, Janet Hess; his 
children, his son, Raymond, and his be-
loved granddaughter, Hazel; his in- 
laws; many nieces and nephews; and ex-
tended family members throughout 
Michigan and Indiana. 
The family pays tribute to Angela 
Hospice, providers who I had the 
chance to meet when I was visiting 
with Tom, for their tireless work and 
dedication to the people in the most sa-
cred time in their life, and, of course, 
the VA hospital in Ann Arbor, which 
Tom loved so dearly. 
I thank my colleagues for joining me 
and 
recognizing 
my 
beloved 
con-
stituent, Tom Hess.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
during National Police Week to honor 
the men and women of the law enforce-
ment community and to condemn the 
ongoing attacks of those members of 
our law enforcement community. 
In particular, to Wisconsin’s law en-
forcement community, I say: Thank 
you. 
The past year has been particularly 
tough on our law enforcement officers. 
Just outside the State Capitol of Wis-
consin in Madison is the Wisconsin 
Law Enforcement Memorial. 
Last year, this memorial was vandal-
ized. A criminal took a sledgehammer 
to the granite, which is etched with the 
names of the men and women who died 
in the line of duty protecting our com-
munities. 
Last week, six more heroes had their 
names added to the law enforcement 
memorial, but the ceremony was inter-
rupted by antipolice protestors. During 
the prayer, protestors yelled that the 
deaths of these officers, whose names 
were being etched into the memorial, 
were not a sacrifice. 
Antipolice protestors held up signs 
with hateful words and disrupted a sol-
emn ceremony with vile chants. It was 
disgusting to see the absolute lack of 
respect and the display of hatred and 
complete ignorance. 
Contrary to the antipolice protestors 
at the ceremony, these officers are he-
roes. They died protecting us. They 
died protecting our communities. 
Let me tell you about just one of 
them. Officer John Hetland was one of 
the names added to the Wisconsin me-
morial this year. He was a 24-year vet-
eran of the Racine Police Department. 
Officer Hetland was a hero. He made a 
commitment to serve and protect our 
communities, whether on or off duty. 
When a local business was being robbed 
at gunpoint, Officer Hetland attempted 
to stop the suspect. Officer Hetland 
was murdered. He was shot in the chest 
by this criminal. He died protecting 
our community. 
We have seen antipolice rhetoric go 
too far. After riots broke out in Keno-
sha, officers from Kenosha, Racine, 
Walworth, Rock, Waukesha, and Mil-
waukee Counties and across the State 
of Wisconsin put their lives on the line 
to defend Kenosha and protect the peo-
ple in our communities. 
I will never forget hearing those 
same vulgar chants when criminals at-
tacked officers in the streets of Keno-
sha. As fires were being set throughout 
the city, I remember watching officers 
duck as Molotov cocktails were being 
thrown at them, as water bottles filled 
with concrete were being thrown at 
them and hurled in their direction. 
Even as an officer was struck in the 
head by a brick and knocked uncon-
scious, the criminals cheered. That is 
unbelievable. That is heartbreaking. 
Violence towards our police officers 
is something our Nation cannot tol-
erate. We should collectively speak out 
against the attacks on our police and 
against the calls to defund the police. 
We should be supporting our men and 
women in law enforcement. 
To the members of the law enforce-
ment community, I want you to know 
this: The people of Wisconsin’s First 
Congressional District say: Thank you; 
thank you for keeping us safe.

REJECT THE INSULAR CASES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, today, 
the House is holding a hearing on the 
insular cases, doctrines which hold the 
territories in a perpetual state of colo-
nialism. 
Earlier this year, I served as a House 
impeachment manager in the second 
trial of President Donald Trump. My 
presence on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
carried a great deal of meaning for me. 
It also said a lot about America. 
Although I was making the case, I 
was unable to actually cast a vote in 
the House. My constituents in the Vir-
gin Islands, U.S. citizens, remain un-
able to vote for President, lack any 
voice in the Senate, and have only a 
limited vote in the House. 
The second-class treatment of the 
territories is not just unfair; it is un- 
American. More than 3.5 million Amer-
icans are denied the right to vote sim-
ply because of where they live, whether 
it is Puerto Rico; Guam; Northern Mar-
iana Islands; American Samoa; or my 
home, the Virgin Islands of the United 
States. This number of people is equiv-
alent to the population of the five 
smallest States combined, and each of 
the territories send more men and 
women to the military per capita than 
any State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2203 
May 12, 2021 
More than 98 percent of the terri-
torial residents are racial or ethnic mi-
norities like me, a fact that cannot be 
a mere coincidence in our continuing 
disenfranchisement, 
which 
extends 
well past the century mark. 
Our Nation’s Founders never in-
tended our country to work this way. 
Alexander Hamilton, as a young man, 
arrived in New York after spending his 
formative years in my home on St. 
Croix. He and others risked their lives 
to reject colonialism. They wanted no 
part of it. They understood that gov-
ernments derive their just powers from 
the consent of those governed. 
America has, from its inception, in-
cluded U.S. territories. The original 
understanding was that the Constitu-
tion provided a promise of full political 
participation to each resident of a ter-
ritory 
through 
eventual 
statehood. 
Until that happened, the Constitution 
was understood to fully protect their 
rights. 
That promise was broken after the 
United States began acquiring island 
territories in 1898. During that time, in 
a series of decisions known collectively 
as the insular cases, the Supreme 
Court invented an unprecedented new 
category of unincorporated territories 
whose residents were not on a path to 
statehood. Which territories the Court 
determined 
were 
unincorporated 
turned largely on the Justices at the 
time’s view of the people who lived 
there—people they labeled in those 
court opinions as half-civilized, sav-
ages, alien races, ignorant, and law-
less—people like Alexander Hamilton; 
Camille Pissarro, the founder of Im-
pressionism; Edward Wilmot Blyden, 
the founder of Pan-Africanism; and 
me—lawless, savage. 
While other racist Supreme Court de-
cisions from that same era by those 
same Justices—such as Plessy v. Fer-
guson—have long been overturned, the 
insular cases remain. The last three ad-
ministrations—Bush, Obama, Trump— 
have all upheld and fought for these 
same cases. Indeed, our own House Par-
liamentarian uses the insular cases to 
deny the people who live in the terri-
tories and their representatives full 
voting rights on this floor. 
The ramifications go well beyond 
just voting. We do pay billions in Fed-
eral taxes, yet residents of the U.S. ter-
ritories are denied and limited access 
to Federal programs and support. Oth-
erwise, eligible citizens in the terri-
tories are denied SSI, leaving our most 
vulnerable seniors and disabled to fend 
for themselves. Federal programs like 
Medicaid, SNAP, child tax credit, and 
the earned income tax credit are 
capped or denied altogether. 
The Supreme Court will soon tackle 
questions of Federal discrimination 
against citizens in the territories in 
United States v. Vaello-Madero, a case 
where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
First Circuit ruled unconstitutional 
the arbitrary denial of SSI benefits in 
Puerto Rico. 
The Justice Department should not 
continue 
defending 
this 
case. 
The 
House should not continue to defend 
and utilize the insular cases to deny 
people living in the territories basic 
rights. 
Making sure that 3.5 million U.S. 
citizens can vote is not a partisan 
issue. Of my four other colleagues in 
the territories, two are Democrats and 
two are Republicans. We are not a 
monolithic people. 
Our country has been given a collec-
tive opportunity to ask what America 
is and who we are as a people. These 
questions extend to America’s respon-
sibilities to citizens living in the terri-
tories. 
Please reject the insular cases. 
f 
SUMMER CAMPS SHOULD REOPEN 
WITHOUT MASKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
this year, due to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention guidelines 
restricting outdoor activities, many 
children will be stuck inside when they 
should be outdoors in the sunlight 
playing, learning new skills, making 
friends, and enjoying their childhoods. 
This is not only important for their 
mental health but also their physical 
health and enhancing their immune 
system. 
And it is even more critically impor-
tant in those States which have still 
not reopened their schools fully to in- 
person learning, despite all scientific 
evidence to the contrary. 
Yesterday, The New York Times re-
ported that the CDC had hugely exag-
gerated their guidelines by saying that 
less than 10 percent of COVID–19 trans-
mission occurs outdoors, and that the 
actual 
estimate 
of 
outdoor 
trans-
mission is somewhere between 0.1 per-
cent to 1 percent. 
This misleading guidance from the 
CDC has led to confusion, increased 
hesitancy to view outdoor activities as 
safe, and many summer camps have 
been forced to close their doors again 
for yet another year. 
We have known for quite some time 
that the risk of transmitting COVID–19 
outdoors is exceedingly small. In Iowa, 
there was not a requirement to wear 
masks outdoors, even though physical 
separation 
and 
maintaining 
small 
group size was encouraged. 
Due to shelter-at-home orders, the 
numbers of cases of youth depression, 
anxiety, attempted suicides, suicides, 
increased drug use, and hospitaliza-
tions have continued to increase, de-
spite the overall decrease in new 
COVID 
cases, 
hospitalizations, 
and 
mortality rates. 
A staggering report from the CDC 
found that from March to October of 
2020, mental health emergency depart-
ment visits from adolescents had in-
creased 31 percent from the same time 
in 2019. 
With the good news related to rapidly 
approaching 
community 
immunity 
from the pandemic and the relaxing of 
a number of protocols and controls, the 
CDC’s newly released guidelines for 
summer camps is both overly cautious, 
rigid, and unscientific. 
Many of us have fond memories of 
spending time with friends and family, 
including a week at summer camp. 
Summer camps are a staple of child-
hood and adolescence. 
More than 6 million children attend 
the day and overnight summer camps 
in any given year. Denying children 
their ability to attend these camps and 
the opportunity to make a friend, learn 
independence, life skills, learn team-
work, build self-esteem, and continue 
their education beyond the school year 
is atrocious. 
With 
over 
12,000 
summer 
camps 
across the country, there are plenty of 
opportunities for our children to grow, 
learn, and play. 
Iowa is home to several great camps, 
including Forest Lake Baptist Camp in 
my home county; Hertko Hollow, a 
camp for children with diabetes; and 
Camp Courageous, a camp specifically 
for children with disabilities. 
Summer camps also provide employ-
ment for over 1.5 million Americans 
every year. This represents a great op-
portunity for high school students and 
adults to have great experiences out-
doors while earning an income. 
As a doctor, former president of the 
Iowa Medical Society, and former di-
rector of the Iowa Department of Pub-
lic Health, I have addressed the sever-
ity of COVID–19 and have been a strong 
and consistent advocate for all three of 
the safe and effective vaccines devel-
oped through Operation Warp Speed, 
and, in fact, just finished attending and 
administering vaccines at clinics in all 
24 counties in my district. 
Just a few days ago, the Pfizer vac-
cine was given emergency use author-
ization to be administered to children 
12 to 15 years old. It has been well-doc-
umented that children are at exceed-
ingly low levels of risk for serious ill-
ness and that they do not transmit the 
virus. 
COVID–19 deaths were 277 through 
the end of April. To put this in perspec-
tive, the CDC estimates around 600 
children died of influenza in the 2017– 
2018 season; 358 died during the 2009 
H1N1 pandemic; and each year, more 
than 700 children die from drowning. 
We can see the light at the end of 
this pandemic tunnel, and as the num-
ber of Americans who are vaccinated 
continues to grow, coupled with those 
who have natural immunity from hav-
ing the disease, I expect to see a return 
to normalcy and a return to pre-pan-
demic life. A return to normal includes 
allowing our kids to be kids. 
I am hopeful that we will be able to 
send our children to summer camp in 
the coming weeks so that they can 
have the experience and opportunities 
that they deserve. 
Time is extraordinarily limited, and 
I implore the CDC to act now and allow 
summer camps to reopen to full activi-
ties without the wearing of masks.

CHILD TAX CREDIT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CARBAJAL) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I was 
proud to vote for the American Rescue 
Plan because I knew it was the trans-
formational investment we needed to 
get the pandemic under control and our 
economy back on track. 
Two months later, it is clear the in-
vestment has paid off. We have gotten 
more shots in arms, lifted families out 
of poverty, helped children get back to 
school, helped businesses stay open, 
and helped workers keep their jobs. 
And we are just getting started. 
Much of the vital support for workers 
and families included in the American 
Rescue Plan is still underway. One of 
these measures is the expansion of the 
child tax credit, a historic investment 
in the future of our country. 
It has become harder and harder to 
afford a college education, a home, and 
childcare. 
b 1045 
As the cost of living continues to 
soar and wages continue to stagnate, 
the American Dream is slipping out of 
reach for many working families. We 
need to level the playing field so every 
child has the opportunity to fulfill 
their potential. 
The child tax credit expansion means 
working-class families will get $300 per 
child under 6, and $250 per child for 
children aged 7–17. $300 a month helps 
put food on the table so kids do not go 
hungry. It helps pay for child care so 
parents can get back to work and build 
a better life for their families. And it 
helps cover healthcare expenses so 
children stay healthy. 
This lifeline benefits a whopping 85 
percent of the children in my district 
on the central coast of California. That 
means a stronger economic foundation 
for over 135,000 children in our commu-
nity. For the 11,200 children in my 
community living in poverty, the child 
tax credit could make all the difference 
in their lives and their futures. 
I come from a low-income family my-
self, a working-class family, so I know 
that $300 a month would have lifted a 
financial burden off my parents’ shoul-
ders, who already worked so hard to 
give me and my siblings a chance for a 
better life. 
Advance monthly payments of the 
child tax credit will start to be sent 
out in July and last through December 
2021. Families will get the remaining 
tax credit when they file their 2021 tax 
returns. Families can make sure they 
get an accurate payment quickly by 
filing their 2020 tax return as soon as 
possible. 
Even individuals who lost their jobs 
during the pandemic or do not nor-
mally file taxes, should file this year to 
receive the credit. The IRS needs the 
information from the tax returns to 
calculate and issue the monthly child 
tax credit payments. 
I will continue to fight for working 
families in Congress so they keep their 
hard-earned money in their pockets, 
and every child has the means to 
achieve the American Dream. 
f 
NYPD SERVES EVEN THROUGH 
TURMOIL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today during National Police Week 
to thank and show support for our po-
lice officers, particularly the New York 
Police Department, and also warn my 
colleagues of what happens when poli-
ticians think that they know how to do 
the job in the street better than our 
cops do because I have seen it happen 
in New York City. I have seen the qual-
ity of life deteriorate, I have seen 
crime skyrocket, and we must learn 
from what has happened here to not 
make this mistake and adopt those 
very policies on the Federal level. 
This past weekend, we saw three in-
nocent bystanders, one of whom was a 
4-year-old child, shot in broad daylight 
in the middle of Times Square. Fortu-
nately, NYPD Officer Alyssa Vogel was 
there. She sprinted into action to save 
these individuals’ lives. That is what 
this mother was doing Mother’s Day 
weekend, and we thank her for her he-
roic efforts. 
Sadly, we also lost a police officer, 
Anastasios Tsakos, who was in Queens 
directing traffic in the middle of the 
night after there was a car accident, 
and he was struck and killed by a hit- 
and-run driver who was under the in-
fluence and operating an unlicensed ve-
hicle. 
Sadly, this is what our police officers 
do each and every day, put their lives 
at risk, sometimes giving up their life 
to protect the rest of us. 
All through the pandemic, we praised 
them as heroes for working the front 
line. COVID was the leading cause of 
death for our police officers in 2020. We 
lost eight NYPD officers, sadly. Also, 
as we approach the 20th anniversary of 
9/11, let’s not forget the sacrifices of 
our police officers, not only on that 
day, but in the days since. We continue 
to lose people to 9/11-related illnesses. 
In the NYPD’s case, they lost seven 
since January 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, in New York City, we 
have seen policies that have hurt our 
law enforcement officers. How did we 
get here? Well, decriminalizing qual-
ity-of-life crimes, which was something 
I warned in 2017 that would lead to 
crimes skyrocketing. The broken win-
dows theory is real. 
Then you add the State legislature’s 
attempts to reform bail, the rush to 
close Rikers Island, emptying the jails, 
putting 
dangerous 
criminals 
with 
lengthy rap sheets back onto our 
streets. 
The Governor’s Parole Board has re-
leased over 16 cop killers and other 
murderers and rapists, once again put-
ting people who are dangerous back on 
our streets; eliminated 
the 
NYPD 
plainclothes unit, tying the hands of 
our police; and then lastly, cutting $1 
billion, one-sixth of the NYPD budget. 
As I mentioned, the 4-year-old girl 
who was shot this weekend, she was 
just one of 43 individuals shot in the 
last week, 169 percent increase over the 
same period last year. There were nine 
murders last week in New York City, 
up 350 percent over the same period 
last year. 
But the trend is not just starting 
now. It is not just the result of 
defunding the police. It is the other 
policies, as I have mentioned. Homi-
cides in 2020 soared 45 percent, shoot-
ings doubled, with 1,868 people shot in 
2020, up from 923 in 2019. This is a result 
of an abdication of responsibility from 
my colleagues on the city and State 
level. 
Now they want to take away the 
qualified immunity from our police of-
ficers, something that many of you 
voted to do here for our Federal law en-
forcement officers, despite when they 
already give up their immunity if they 
are not operating within the NYPD 
guidelines, or if they violate someone’s 
constitutional rights. 
There is no question that the demor-
alization of law enforcement over the 
past year has contributed to a sharp 
rise in departures from the NYPD, 
which are up 75 percent compared to 
2019, with the lowest number of NYPD 
officers in uniform in over a decade, 
when we have all this rising crime tak-
ing place across our city. It is abso-
lutely disgraceful, Mr. Speaker, and it 
must end now. 
City and State have a responsibility 
to keep the public safe. Quite frankly, 
if they are not going to do it, if my 
mayor and my Governor continue to 
tie the hands of our police officers and 
not allow them to do their job, then we 
need the Federal Government to step 
in. Send DOJ, ATF, FBI, DEA, and the 
U.S. Marshals, because we have a re-
sponsibility to the citizens of our city 
and Nation to keep them safe.

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
ARE DEDICATED HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as we cele-
brate National Police Week, it is im-
portant that we remember the innu-
merable sacrifices that are made every 
day by the men and women of law en-
forcement. 
In communities across America, they 
serve as the gatekeepers of law and 
order. Even as the far left calls for 
defunding the police, these dedicated 
heroes will not hesitate when called 
upon to serve. 
I believe that their hard work should 
be recognized every day because, with-
out them, law and order would cease to 
exist and criminality would reign.

HONORING DON BURMAN ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Director Don Bur-
man for his nearly 10 years of service 
in the United States Air Force, and 8 
years of service within the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, 6 of which was in 
Nebraska’s Second District at the Ne-
braska-Western Iowa Health Care Sys-
tem. Don is retiring from Federal serv-
ice. 
Don is a Vietnam-era veteran. He 
served as a telecommunications center 
specialist, supporting the mission in 
Arkansas, Hawaii, also Fort Belvoir 
Army installation, and the Defense Nu-
clear 
Agency 
in 
Virginia. 
Don’s 
healthcare 
career 
spans 
nearly 
33 
years, 25 of which were in private 
healthcare. 
In Nebraska’s Second District, Don 
has served since March of 2015 as the 
director of the Nebraska-Western Iowa 
Health Care System. During his tenure, 
he was instrumental in proposing a 
partnership between the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and members of the 
private philanthropic community. His 
vision began a collaboration that pro-
duced the groundbreaking public law 
known as the CHIP IN for Vets Act of 
2016. This law authorized the VA to 
carry out a pilot program under which 
it may accept donations from non-Fed-
eral entities. 
The Nebraska philanthropic commu-
nity provided a gift of $30 million to be 
used to construct a new 157,000-square- 
foot ambulatory care clinic located on 
the grounds of the Omaha VA Medical 
Center. Through Don’s leadership, te-
nacity, and innovation, a second pub-
lic-private partnership recently began. 
CHI Health and Nebraska-Western Iowa 
Health Care System opened a new 35- 
bed Community Living Center for vet-
erans in a non-VA medical facility at 
the CHI Health Midlands healthcare fa-
cility. 
Additionally, a new mental health 
pavilion and a new physical therapy 
and prosthetics building have started 
construction. Omaha’s new 500-stall 
parking ramp opens in November, and 
all seven of the current community- 
based 
outpatient 
centers 
located 
around Nebraska and western Iowa 
have been rebuilt and/or refreshed in 
order to provide the most up-to-date 
healthcare facilities to veterans. 
In August of 2020, Forbes named 
America’s best employers by State, and 
the Veterans Administration was cited 
as the best employer. Among the 17 
States mentioned, the Nebraska VA 
was identified. Bringing Don’s private 
experience and innovation to the Vet-
erans Administration has served our 
veterans well in Nebraska and western 
Iowa. 
Don continues to use his personal 
and professional experience to aid him 
in understanding the needs of our vet-
erans while solving complex issues as-
sociated 
with 
running 
a 
leading 
healthcare system for Nebraska and 
western Iowa. 
Never forgetting the mission of serv-
ice to our veterans, I want to offer my 
sincere appreciation to Don, who is my 
great friend, for his years of dedicated 
service to our great Nation and to Ne-
braska’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. Don’s accomplishments in his 
military service, civil service, and his 
private career are credits to his dedica-
tion to the provision of world-class 
healthcare no matter the venue. 
Don’s retirement is well earned and 
deserved. I wish Don all the best in his 
future endeavors. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ERNEST 
EDISON WEST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor one of my constituents, 
Ernie Edison West, who passed from 
this life on May 1. His fellow soldiers 
knew him as Private First Class West. 
His friends knew him as Ernie. Mr. 
West bravely served his country during 
the Korean War, and his heroic actions 
earned him our Nation’s highest mili-
tary honors, including both a Medal of 
Honor from President Eisenhower, and 
later a Purple Heart. 
Although Mr. West lost one of his 
eyes while defending and saving the 
lives of several of his fellow soldiers in 
Korea, he never considered himself dis-
abled. As a town mayor, coach, friend, 
and mentor to many, Mr. West was an 
unconditional friend to all he met, and 
lived a life of selfless service to his 
community. He worked all his life to 
help veterans and was buried in the 
very cemetery, the Veterans Cemetery 
North East in Greenup County, for 
which he, himself, worked to secure the 
land and the funding. Mr. West’s efforts 
were also crucial to the establishment 
of the Greenup County War Memorial. 
This memorial honors hometown he-
roes on the main street of Mr. West’s 
hometown in Wurtland, Kentucky. 
Mr. West leaves behind his daughter, 
Amy West Hogsett and her husband, 
Randy; five granddaughters; and seven 
great-grandchildren. In the words of 
his niece, Marny Gilluly, Mr. West was 
‘‘larger than life, truly a hero to many, 
and personified the good in people.’’ 
May this brave hero rest in peace.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY TO BOB 
BATTERSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to wish a happy 100th birthday to 
a well-loved member of the south Texas 
community, Captain Robert Batterson, 
whose friends call him Bob. 
Bob has spent his life in service to a 
Nation that he loves. He served at 
Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor, where 
he worked on December 7, 1941. Shortly 
after witnessing the Pearl Harbor at-
tack, Bob was accepted for Navy flight 
training. He was awarded his wings and 
assigned to Fighter Squadron 1. 
Bob’s life paints a picture of sacrifice 
and duty that we can all learn from. 
May it serve as a reminder of the price 
that he and others like him paid for 
our freedom. 
After World War II, Bob did not stop 
his commitment to serving our great 
Nation. He transferred to the Navy 
Supply Corps, where he worked for 35 
years until his retirement in 1974. 
Bob raised five children, four of 
whom also served our Nation. And he is 
one of the USS Lexington Museum’s 
first volunteers and can often be found 
in the aircraft carrier’s Pearl Harbor 
exhibit. 
Bob has a true passion for speaking 
with people of all ages about becoming 
personally 
involved 
in 
the 
United 
States’ future, especially by contacting 
their elected Representatives. 
Happy birthday to a true American 
hero and an inspiration to all of us, 
Captain Batterson.

CONGRESS MUST REGULARLY REVIEW MILITARY 
ENGAGEMENTS 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak about a bill I am intro-
ducing today. This bill is called the 
Preventing Endless Armed Conflicts 
and Engagement Act, otherwise known 
as the PEACE Act. 
The Constitution makes it clear that 
the authority to declare war rests with 
Congress, and it is important that 
Members of Congress have the oppor-
tunity to carry out our duty to regu-
larly review current military engage-
ments. Unfortunately, that has not 
been the case. 
Today, less than a fifth of the cur-
rent Members of Congress voted on the 
2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force. This statistic ignores 
the many Members of Congress who 
have been elected and since left who 
never got a chance to weigh in on the 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force. 
It is critical that new Members of 
Congress with new constituencies do 
their duty and provide input into mili-
tary operations. It is my hope that the 
PEACE Act can ensure regular over-
sight is being conducted on future mili-
tary authorizations. 
First, this bill would require each 
military 
authorization, 
called 
an 
AUMF, to sunset after 2 years. Now, 
why 2 years? Well, obviously, it would 
give each Member of Congress and, 
therefore, the people they represent 
the opportunity to review and weigh in 
on ongoing conflicts. 
The President, of course, has the au-
thority to deploy military forces in an 
emergency and respond to imminent 
threats, and that would continue under

this bill. Sustained military oper-
ations, however, need approval from 
Congress. This is a principle firmly 
rooted in the Constitution, which stip-
ulates that funding for our military 
should not extend beyond 2 years. 
The PEACE Act would also set the 
standards for new military authoriza-
tions. For instance, each authorization 
would need to set a geographical scope 
on where military force can be used. A 
clear objective would need to be estab-
lished for each authorization so that 
we know when victory is achieved, and 
the countries and groups that the U.S. 
is authorized to fight must be listed. 
Additionally, the Departments of De-
fense and State would be charged with 
publishing an annual report on existing 
military operations for congressional 
review. This report will include infor-
mation such as whether the military is 
meeting defined objectives, the number 
of casualties, and total costs. 
Finally, the DOD and State Depart-
ment will be required to brief Members 
of Congress on the contents of this re-
port every 6 months. 
It is never easy to decide between 
risking the lives of our troops or jeop-
ardizing our national security. How-
ever, this is a decision that Members of 
Congress are elected to do, in large 
part because we are the body in this 
Federal Government that is closest to 
the people. 
Military deployments that are ac-
countable to we the people are one 
thing that sets us apart as a nation to 
ensure that our fight is always for 
what is right. We owe it to our troops. 
We owe it to the American people.

REMEMBERING DONALD SCOTT 
OVERTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor Donald Scott 
Overton of Savannah, Georgia, who 
passed away on April 14 at the age of 
89. 
Scott served our country in the U.S. 
Army and trained to be a pilot toward 
the end of the Korean war, giving him 
a love for flying that he would have for 
the rest of his life. 
Scott became an accomplished glider 
pilot and enjoyed building planes from 
a kit in his garage. 
Everyone who knew Scott recognized 
his giving heart and love for adventure. 
With his wife and friends, Scott cruised 
to all the continents except Africa. 
Professionally, Scott worked tire-
lessly as the president of the Arthur D. 
Crane Real Estate Development Com-
pany and owned numerous small water 
companies. 
I am thankful for the immense im-
pact that Scott had on our community, 
and I know his legacy will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him, 
during this most difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING MICKEY STEPHENS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Georgia Representative Mickey Ste-
phens for his remarkable career in the 
Georgia General Assembly. 
Mr. Stephens is a native of Savannah 
and a proud graduate of Savannah 
State College. 
Mickey served one term in 2002 and 
was reelected in 2014 to the Georgia 
House, representing the 165th District. 
As an educator, he was a great asset 
to Savannah High School, Shuman 
Middle School, and John W. Hubert 
Middle School. Additionally, Mickey 
served 
on 
the 
Savannah-Chatham 
County Board of Public Education and 
the Savannah Zoning Board of Appeals. 
Mr. Stephens is known throughout 
Georgia for his civic service, including 
his commitment to the community and 
his efforts in supporting the education 
of youth and adults. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stephens 
for all of his work to make Savannah a 
better place to live. Mr. Stephens is an 
inspiration to all of us about giving 
back to the community. 
REMEMBERING JAMES ‘‘JIMMY’’ ALLEN PETREA 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor the former mayor 
of Thunderbolt, Jimmy Petrea, who 
passed away on April 24 at the age of 
74. 
Jimmy spent his entire life serving 
others. 
After graduating high school, Jimmy 
enlisted in the U.S. Navy to serve our 
country and went on to serve 3 years in 
Vietnam. 
Jimmy was elected mayor of Thun-
derbolt in 1981 and was reelected for 
multiple terms until he resigned in 
2005. 
During his 24 years as mayor, Jimmy 
was highly regarded by his constitu-
ents as a person of unquestioned integ-
rity and dedication. 
After a quarter-century of service to 
the town of Thunderbolt and the Coast-
al Empire, one cannot visit Georgia’s 
First Congressional District without 
seeing the profound impacts Jimmy 
made for his community. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him, 
during this most difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING MARTIN BELL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Martin Bell’s remarkable career as 
general manager of the Okefenokee 
Swamp Park. 
For the past 26 years, Martin Bell has 
welcomed 
guests 
from 
around 
the 
world to experience the wonders of the 
Okefenokee Swamp. 
Known as an intensely creative and 
hardworking leader, Mr. Bell’s accom-
plishments are impressive. 
Under Mr. Bell’s management, many 
projects were completed to support the 
park’s growth and sustainable future. 
Some of Mr. Bell’s more notable ac-
complishments include the establish-
ment of the Okefenokee Railroad, the 
launch of the holiday light show, the 
construction of the Cypress Cove annex 
and greenhouse, and the reopening of a 
water trail that had been closed for 40 
years. 
Through his stewardship, Mr. Bell 
has exposed the beauty of the Oke-
fenokee Swamp Park to visitors from 
across the globe and built the park into 
our State’s most desirable ecotourism 
and educational destination. 
Mr. Bell’s passion and leadership for 
the park will be missed by all of those, 
like me, who appreciate his steadfast 
stewardship.

CONDEMNING 
TERRORIST 
ACTS 
CONDUCTED BY HAMAS AGAINST 
ISRAEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to strongly condemn the ter-
rorist acts conducted by Hamas against 
the State of Israel. 
These horrific scenes coming out of 
Jerusalem depict countless rockets 
being launched from Gaza with the in-
tent to massacre innocent civilians. 
What we have seen of the Iron Dome’s 
ability to intercept this high volume of 
rockets is truly remarkable. But unfor-
tunately, some of these rockets are 
getting through, and that underscores 
Israel’s security vulnerability. It re-
minds us why the United States must 
continue being an ally of Israel and 
why our commitment to Israel’s sov-
ereignty and independence is so crucial 
at a time of heightened regional hos-
tility. 
Quite frankly, I am surprised there 
haven’t been more Members of this in-
stitution to extend their support for 
Israel. That is why, this week, I am in-
troducing a resolution to not only con-
demn Hamas for these acts of terrorism 
but for Congress to signal its unwaver-
ing support to our strategic partner 
Israel and to the Jewish people. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
this resolution.

RECOGNIZING 
PREGNANCY 
RE-
SOURCE CENTERS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise to recognize the incredible 
lifesaving care provided by pregnancy 
resource centers across the country. 
Thanks to the 2,700 pregnancy re-
source centers in the United States, 
mothers looking for help, hope, and 
healing have a safe place they can turn 
to. 
In my own district, Virginia’s Fifth 
Congressional District, we have 10 out-
standing centers where lives are saved 
and mothers are given new hope. 
To recognize the exceptional work 
they do, I have introduced a resolution 
designating the week of November 8 as

National 
Pregnancy 
Center 
Week, 
highlighting the vital role that preg-
nancy resource centers play in helping 
mothers and families. 
As a result of their work, young lives 
will be given the opportunity to live, 
grow up, and work in our great Nation. 
Despite there being over three times 
as many pregnancy resource centers as 
abortion centers in the United States, 
sadly, most Americans are more famil-
iar with the anti-life groups like 
Planned Parenthood because my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
stumble over each other to throw tax-
payer money in their direction. 
Without pregnancy resource centers, 
millions more babies would be mur-
dered by the scourge of radical anti-life 
groups under the guise of family plan-
ning. 
To all those who selflessly serve in 
pregnancy resource centers, I thank 
you for your lifesaving work. 
Mr. Speaker, no more fundamental 
right than the right to life exists in our 
country and in our world today, and 
there is no more fundamental responsi-
bility of government than the responsi-
bility to defend the most vulnerable 
among us, and that includes innocent, 
precious life in the womb. 
Everyone knows abortion is wrong. 
The clear science shows us that it is 
the taking of innocent life in the 
womb. The only question is what pri-
ority we will give that unborn, pre-
cious life in the womb. 
Thankfully, our country has an ad-
mirable history of correcting civil and 
social injustice. The glaring exception 
is the ultimate injustice of abortion. 
I pray that we will soon correct this 
injustice, and I believe that history 
will rightly condemn those who stood 
on the wrong side on this issue. I pray 
that we will correct the injustice of 
abortion, which has tragically taken 
the lives of some 70 million unborn 
children.

HONORING DONALD KEITH 
STRICKLAND 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the life of Sergeant 
First Class Donald Keith Strickland, 
who recently passed away. Donald’s fa-
vorite quote was: ‘‘My proudest accom-
plishment was defending our great Na-
tion.’’ 
Sergeant First Class Donald Keith 
Strickland was born on May 31, 1934, to 
George and Ruth Strickland in Rich-
mond, Indiana. The Stricklands moved 
out to California for a better life, as 
many did back in those days. 
Young Donald grew up in the San 
Fernando Valley and had many dif-
ferent jobs, from working at his fam-
ily’s grocery store to doing a paper 
route on his horse called Star Baby. 
While attending high school, Donald 
had a call to duty and joined the Navy 
on his 17th birthday. Donald’s father 
had to sign papers in order to release 
him to enlist for the Korean war. While 
in Korea, he served on the famed air-
craft carriers USS Yorktown and USS 
Hornet. After the Korean war and 3 
years in the Navy, Donald decided to 
join the Army, where he spent the next 
18 years of his life. 
Donald did his basic training at Fort 
Bragg. During Donald’s first jump after 
training, his parachute did not open 
until he almost hit the ground. As he 
tells the story: ‘‘I was the last one out 
of the plane and the first one down.’’ 
During Donald’s time in the Army, 
he was stationed in West Germany, 
where he met the love of his life, 
Antonie, and they have been married 
for over 60 years. 
Donald was sent off to the Vietnam 
war, where he served two tours of duty 
and was awarded the Bronze Star for 
bravery in action during the Tet Offen-
sive. Donald rose to the rank of ser-
geant first class. 
After getting injured in the war, 
Donald became a drill sergeant at Fort 
Ord Army Base in Monterey, Cali-
fornia. As his kids tell their friends, 
imagine having a drill sergeant for a 
dad. 
In reminiscing with his children, 
Donald was always proud to be called a 
soldier for America. Donald considered 
the United States of America the 
greatest country in the world. 
In 1973, Donald retired from the 
armed services and relocated to Simi 
Valley, California, where he worked for 
the police department. 
Donald loved working with his hands 
and could fix anything. Donald never 
had a negative comment about anyone, 
and any person who knew him loved 
him for his hard work and his smile. 
Donald’s commitment was resounding, 
as he did not retire until the age of 75. 
Donald is survived by his wife, 
Antonie; his children, Gabriele, Rene, 
and Anthony; his grandchildren, Jacob, 
Samantha, Natasha, Alexandra, Ruby, 
and Anthony; and his great-grand-
children, Wyatt, Kayla, Sophia, and 
Bryce. 
Donald had been a resident of Ven-
tura County since 1973 and resided in 
Camarillo since 2000 with his wife for 
the remainder of his life. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a tribute to Donald Strickland.

‘‘My proudest accomplishment was defending 
our great nation.’’—Donald K. Strickland 
Sergeant First Class, Donald Keith Strick-
land was born May 31, 1934 to George and 
Ruth Strickland in Richmond, Indiana. The 
Strickland’s moved out to California for a 
better life like many did back in those days. 
Young Donald grew up in the San Fernando 
Valley and had many different jobs from 
working at his family’s grocery store, to

Korean War and three years in the Navy, 
Donald decided to join the Army of which he 
spent the next 18 years of his life. 
Donald did his basic training at Fort Brag, 
North Carolina and joined the legendary 82nd 
Airborne. During his first jump after train-
ing, Donald’s parachute did not open until he 
almost hit ground. As he tells the story, ‘‘I 
was the last one out of the plane and the 
first one down.’’ Not discouraged, his com-
manding officer sent him right back up with 
no hesitation on Donald’s part. He loved 
jumping out of airplanes. 
During his time in the Army, Donald was 
stationed in West Germany where he met the 
love of his life, Antonie, and have been mar-
ried over 60 years. Donald was then sent off 
to the Vietnam War where he served two 
tours of duty and was awarded the Bronze 
Star for bravery in action during the Tet Of-
fensive. Donald rose to the rank of Sergeant 
First Class as a non-commissioned officer

facilities manager for a number of Convales-
cent and Hospital locations throughout Ven-
tura County. He loved working with his 
hands and could fix anything. He never had a 
negative comment about anyone and any 
person who knew him loved him for his hard 
work and smile. His commitment was re-
sounding as he did not retire until the age of 
75, 
He is survived by his wife, Antonie; his 
children, Gabriele, Rene and Anthony; his 
grandchildren, Jacob, Samantha, Natasha,

Donald has been a resident of Ventura 
County since 1973 and resided in Camarillo 
since 2000 with his wife for the remainder of 
his life. 
A Funeral Service was held on Sat, May 8, 
2021 at 11:00 am at the Chapel of the Hills at

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

Sovereign God, You have searched us

down and when we rise up. You are 
aware of every action we take, when we 
pause from our labors, and when we get 
up again to tackle the day. 
Even with this knowledge of our in-
nermost being, O God, You deign to 
show us Your mercy. In Your ever-lov-
ing care, You continue to guide our 
paths. You keep us safe from harm 
from within and without. 
Such knowledge, O God, is too won-
derful for us to comprehend. In Your 
mercy, cause us to pause and reflect on 
the intimate relationship You have es-
tablished with us. May we give thought 
to the words yet on our tongues, to the 
plans we organize, and to the decisions 
we contemplate, that all that we would 
say or do would reflect Your infinite 
love. 
Search us again and again. Know our 
hearts. 
Test 
us 
and 
reveal 
our 
thoughts. If there is any wickedness in 
us, lead us, instead, to Your redeeming 
and everlasting way. 
Aware of Your abiding presence, we 
pray that nothing we do this day would 
give shame to You. 
It is in the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam

the American Rescue Plan. This bill 
expanded the child tax credit in an un-

this expansion will cut childhood pov-
erty in this country by one half. 
Thanks to the efforts of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan and the Biden admin-
istration’s rollout of the vaccine, we 
are finally starting to see light at the 
end of the tunnel for this pandemic. 
But vaccines alone will not be enough 
to end the economic crisis caused by 
this virus. 
This pandemic exposed and worsened 
longstanding economic issues in our so-
ciety, wages that are too low, childcare 
that is inaccessible, and a lack of paid 
leave to allow workers the ability to 
properly care for themselves and their 
families. 
Policies like the expanded child tax 
credit are essential to our economic re-
covery to help working parents, espe-
cially mothers, reenter the workforce 
knowing their children are safe and 
cared for.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Na-
tional Police Week and formally honor 
our men and women who have an-
swered the notable call to serve in the 
law enforcement profession. 
Every day, police officers patrol our 
streets, answer emergency calls, put 
away criminals, and sacrifice their own 
safety in order to protect members of 
their community. Law enforcement of-
ficers are our communities’ most es-
sential line of defense against those 
who seek violence or criminal activity. 
This week is also an important time 
to pause and pay our respects to the 
police officers who have laid down 
their lives in the line of duty. May 
their sacrifice not be in vain and their 
memory be a blessing. 
May we continue to recognize the he-
roic efforts of all members in the police 
community and do all that we can to 
show our appreciation for their sac-
rifices. 
I will always stand with our men and 
women in blue, and may God continue 
to keep them safe as they work tire-
lessly and with an unwavering commit-
ment to put service above self. 
In God we trust.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2209 
May 12, 2021 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an extraordinary 
public school in my district, less than 
1 mile from my house, Wiley Elemen-
tary School. 
For the second time in 5 years, Wiley 
has been named a top magnet elemen-
tary school in the Nation for its dedi-
cation to excellence. 
It is both an international magnet 
and a true neighborhood school. A di-
verse 
and 
welcoming 
community, 
Wiley’s teachers, faculty, parents, and 
staff go above and beyond to ensure 
that every student receives the best 
education possible. 
Wiley offers the International Stud-
ies Magnet Program, which allows stu-
dents to take as many as eight elec-
tives, including five foreign languages, 
in elementary school. Through this 
program, students are able to learn 
about cultures other than their own 
and experience diverse perspectives. 
I believe the foundation to a quality 
education begins in elementary school, 
and I know that Wiley is setting stu-
dents up for success. 
I am honored to represent Wiley Ele-
mentary School in Congress, and I am 
awed by all that their children achieve. 
f 
CANCELING MOTHERS 
(Mr. MOONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOONEY. Madam Speaker, this 
past weekend, we celebrated Mother’s 
Day, a day for families across our great 
Nation to honor our mothers. 
God has blessed me with a wife, the 
mother of our three beautiful children, 
including two daughters. 
My own mother, Lala, has instilled in 
me the values I am proud to cherish 
today, including my faith and belief in 
family. My mother, who is almost 80 
years old, fled Communist Cuba under 
the Castro regime and is now a proud 
American. Her love of country inspires 
me each day. 
Mother’s Day was founded by West 
Virginia native Anna Jarvis in 1908. 
But the radical left, including some 
Members of Congress, have begun refer-
ring to mothers as ‘‘birthing people.’’ 
NARAL, 
the 
pro-choice 
lobbying 
group, tweeted on May 6: ‘‘When we 
talk about birthing people, we are 
being inclusive. It is that simple.’’ 
The canceling of the term ‘‘mother’’ 
actually began here in the Congress 
when Speaker PELOSI
changed the 
House Rules package and eliminated 
the words ‘‘mother,’’ ‘‘father,’’ ‘‘son,’’ 
and ‘‘daughter,’’ and replaced them 
with ‘‘parent’’ and ‘‘child.’’ 
It defies common sense that the can-
cel culture and some Members of Con-
gress would seek to cancel the term 
‘‘mother.’’ It is wrong that we cannot 
celebrate mothers on the House floor. 
All mothers play an important role. 
ENSURING PAST INJUSTICES ARE 
NOT FORGOTTEN 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, 
as we continue to grapple with the 
issues of race and justice in our coun-
try, I rise today to share a story of 
tragedy and progress from my own dis-
trict. 
More than a century ago, Charlie 
Hale, a young African-American male 
in Lawrenceville, Georgia, was ab-
ducted, brought into the city square, 
strung up, and shot simply because of 
the color of his skin. No arrests were 
ever made in his murder. 
Decades passed. Charlie’s name was 
forgotten, and in a cruel twist of irony, 
a Confederate monument was erected 
mere steps away from the site of his 
murder. And so it stood for decades, 
until now. 
That Confederate monument stands 
no longer. It was removed following 
our country’s long-overdue racial reck-
oning this past year. In its place will 
stand a memorial to the life and death 
of Charlie Hale. 
I want to recognize the leadership of 
Marlene Taylor-Crawford and her work 
with the Gwinnett Remembrance Coa-
lition Project, the Gwinnett Historical 
Restoration and Preservation Board, 
and all the activists who pushed for 
this change for years. 
The dirt where his blood was spilled 
will be collected and displayed in per-
petuity in Gwinnett County, as well as 
the Legacy Museum and the National 
Memorial for Peace and Justice in 
Montgomery. 
I want to be clear: Even more than a 
century later, this does not make 
things right by Charlie Hale or those 
who loved him and lost him. But it 
does take an important step to ensure 
the injustices of the past are not for-
gotten. 
f 
GETTING AMERICA BACK TO WORK 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, at a time when the 
economy should be roaring back, we 
just witnessed one of the worst month-
ly job reports in history because of the 
Biden administration’s socialist poli-
cies. 
Despite States loosening restrictions 
on businesses, the unemployment rate 
has actually gone up. Why? Because 
the Democrats want to pay people to 
sit at home rather than actually go to 
work. Republicans in Congress warned 
about this, and, lo and behold, we were 
right. 
While campaigning, candidate Biden 
promised to shut down the virus, not 
the economy. Well, the virus has been 
shut down because of Operation Warp 
Speed, yet now President Biden has 
shut down businesses because he pays 
people to stay at home. 
My eastern North Carolina district is 
set to have a huge tourist season, but 
they can’t find anybody to come to 
work, the same with boatbuilders, ho-
tels, and other businesses. They cannot 
open up normally. They cannot open 
their doors because the administra-
tion’s socialist policies want to pay 
people to stay at home. 
America, despite your government, 
you need to get back to work. 
f 
EXPANDED CHILD TAX CREDIT 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I represent a working-class 
district in Chicago, and my community 
has been especially hard-hit by the 
pandemic. 
I have one of the largest percentages 
of school-age children in my district, 
and my neighbors are worried about 
putting food on the table. I have seen 
the lines at food banks grow and grow. 
But the expanded child tax credit in 
the American Rescue Plan changes 
that. Nearly 90 percent of the children 
in my district will benefit. And more 
than 40,000 households will get an aver-
age of $3,300, parents like Jaime in 
Logan Square, who will finally be able 
to send his son to college this year at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana- 
Champaign thanks to this tax credit. 
This program is about helping their 
children thrive, and in my community, 
it is already working.

HONORING RALPH PUCKETT 
(Mr. FERGUSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a remarkable 
individual from my district, Colonel 
Ralph Puckett, a 94-year-old veteran 
who will soon receive the Nation’s 
highest award, the Medal of Honor. 
Colonel Puckett is a Georgia native 
and a graduate of West Point. Soon 
after graduating, he was deployed to 
fight in Korea in the 8th Army Ranger 
Company. In November of 1950, he hero-
ically led his Ranger company on a 
freezing day at the Battle for Hill 205. 
His platoon was overcome by an on-
slaught of Chinese attackers and a bar-
rage of artillery fire. Colonel Puckett 
sustained severe injuries during this 
attack. 
Although his injuries incapacitated 
him, Colonel Puckett selflessly ordered 
Private First Class Billy G. Walls and 
Private First Class Davis L. Pollock to 
leave him on the battlefield. He could 
see the Chinese soldiers within yards of 
attacking his Rangers, but his com-
rades returned to carry him to safety, 
despite the danger. 
Colonel Puckett went on to serve 
honorably in Colombia, Germany, and 
Vietnam until his retirement in 1971.

May 12, 2021 
Though his Active Duty has ended, he 
continues to serve as Honorary Colonel 
of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and he 
still inspires young people in his com-
munity today. 
Colonel Puckett was inducted into 
the Ranger Hall of Fame and received a 
Distinguished Service Cross for his ac-
tions at Hill 205, in addition to two Sil-
ver Stars, five Purple Hearts, various 
awards from Vietnam and Colombia, 
and a Distinguished Graduate Award 
from West Point. His bravery is a tes-
tament to his strength and patriotism, 
and he is an inspiration to the people 
of the Third District of Georgia, as well 
as our country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in congratulating Colonel 
Puckett and extending our sincere ap-
preciation to him and all of our men 
and women in uniform. As a nation, we 
are forever grateful for their service 
and their sacrifice.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
FIRST 
CLASS 
OF 
GRADUATES 
FROM 
THE KIRK KERKORIAN SCHOOL 
OF MEDICINE 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today on behalf of the historic 
first class of medical students to grad-
uate from the Kirk Kerkorian School 
of Medicine at the University of Ne-
vada, Las Vegas. 
Four years ago, the 50 students of 
this inaugural class donned their white 
coats, pledged their formal oaths, and 
began their lifelong medical journeys. 
But for southern Nevada, this was 
more than your average first day of 
school. Nevada has consistently ranked 
among the lowest rates in doctors per 
capita; and before this class, Las Vegas 
was the largest metro area in the Na-
tion without a medical school capable 
of bestowing M.D. degrees. 
These graduates are pioneers in pro-
viding for the health of our commu-
nity, and their dedication to home is 
clear. Ninety-seven percent of this 
class hails from the Battle Born State, 
and well over one-third of the grad-
uates will stay right here to continue 
their education. 
We cannot thank them enough for 
their dedication to the health of our 
community, especially in the midst of 
this pandemic. 
Congratulations to the UNLV Med-
ical graduates.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to recognize National Police 
Week. 
Our police officers put their lives on 
the line every single day they go to 
work. They answer the call of duty on 
holidays, 
weekends, 
birthdays, 
and 
through the COVID–19 pandemic to 
selflessly protect our communities. 
When I was chair of the Orange Coun-
ty Board of Supervisors, I introduced a 
resolution to recognize Law Enforce-
ment Appreciation Day in Orange 
County because now, more than ever, 
we owe these brave officers our support 
and appreciation. 
I am especially grateful for our Cap-
itol Police officers who have been 
through so much this year with the 
devastating loss of multiple officers in 
the line of duty. 
Thank you to all police officers for 
your continued bravery. I and so many 
others are proud to stand with you 
today and every day. 
f 
BENEFITS OF THE AMERICAN 
RESCUE PLAN 
(Mr. JONES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, the 
American Rescue Plan is the most 
transformative 
economic 
legislation 
for working families in a generation. 
Our expansion of the child tax credit 
will literally cut child poverty in half. 
But unless we make the expansion per-
manent, we will find ourselves a year 
from now in the same dire straits that 
existed before the pandemic: A country 
where we accept that 11 million people 
live in poverty, nearly 15 percent of all 
children in this country; a country 
where we accept that 25 percent of 
Black children live in poverty. 
I have been in Congress for 5 months 
and I am already tired of having to 
vote to reauthorize things that we 
know should be permanent. Expanding 
the child tax credit is a moral and eco-
nomic imperative. It should not have 
an expiration date. 
For the last year, we have talked 
about the impossible choices that fami-
lies 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
make: 
childcare or healthcare; food or rent. 
The 
reality 
is, 
these 
impossible 
choices existed for millions of families 
before the pandemic began, and they 
will continue to exist after the pan-
demic is over. Poverty is a choice that 
we make here in this Chamber, and we 
can choose to end it.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS DON-
ALD KEITH STRICKLAND 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the life of 
Sergeant First Class Donald Keith 
Strickland. Donald passed away re-
cently after a long life of service to his 
country, his fellow Americans, and his 
family. 
Standing with me today is my good 
friend, Representative ALEX MOONEY of 
West Virginia. We are both dear friends 
of Donald’s son, Tony Strickland, who 
I served in the legislature with and 
who has a long relationship with this 
great person here. 
What you see in a legacy with a man 
like Donald, who was an Army staff 
sergeant, also known as a drill ser-
geant—which, by the way, the family 
home was known as ‘‘strict land’’ be-
cause it was very strict there due to 
that background. The legacy shows the 
great family that we know with Tony 
and his kids and all the wonderful 
grandchildren that Mr. Donald Strick-
land had. 
He is survived by his wife, Antonie; 
his three children; and many grand-
children and great-grandchildren. 
The legacy of how we are measured is 
truly in your family and what you 
leave behind as you touch your coun-
try. 
For our dear friend Tony, our hearts 
are with you in the loss of your father, 
and God bless you all. 
f 
HONORING LOCAL POLICE 
OFFICERS 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I recently toured my district to meet 
members of the community nominated 
by their fellow residents who served 
their fellow citizens extraordinarily 
during the pandemic. 
During my tour, I had the honor of 
meeting Mena Police Chief Tommy 
Stueart and Bearden Police Chief Na-
than Greeley. These men cared for 
their communities by delivering food 
and prescriptions and taking care of 
the sick and elderly, all while dealing 
with their own staff shortages. 
When our local police officers go to 
work, they wear many hats. Of course, 
they are protectors, but they also play 
the role of nurse, comforter, teacher, 
caretaker, and confidant. 
Ask any police officer and they will 
say it is just part of the job, but it is 
a grave mistake to take this for grant-
ed. 
Madam Speaker, another grave mis-
take is the Democrats’ move to defund 
police. This National Police Week, let’s 
honor the heroism and the daily 
kindnesses shown by our law enforce-
ment, and let’s work to support those 
brave men and women who protect and 
serve.

hoods.

law enforcement in my district who are 
helping to keep their communities 
safe. 
First, there is West Lafayette Police 
Officer Brian Danosky who risked his 
own life to provide lifesaving care to a 
22-year-old who had a gunshot wound. 
In Frankfort, Indiana, Sergeant Chris 
Salaba was awarded Officer of the Year 
last year for helping his department 
overcome challenges from the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
In Putnam County, Sheriff Scott 
Stockton and his deputies kept deadly 
drugs off of our streets by seizing 225 
pounds of meth. 
These are just a few of the examples 
of police officers working to keep our 
neighborhoods safe. 
I think it is important to highlight 
their work and remind citizens that 
most police officers are good people 
who want to protect their communities 
and serve the people within them.

RECOGNIZING THE RIVERHEADS 
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Riverheads High 
School football team of Augusta Coun-
ty, Virginia, who recently won the 
Commonwealth’s class 1 State football 
champion. 
After a close first quarter, the Glad-
iators scored 34 points in the second 
quarter, propelling them to a resound-
ing 65–29 victory or the Galax Maroon 
Tide. 
Riverheads has now won a notable 
five consecutive State titles. Senior 
running back Zac Smiley, who led the 
team with 121 rushing yards, said: ‘‘It 
almost feels normal, but it’s not.’’ 
The Riverheads’ running game had 
been strong all season, which allowed 
the Gladiators to catch the Maroon 
Tide off guard with an impressive three 
passing touchdowns, culminating in an 
all-around unstoppable offense. 
When asked what the pressure was 
like to win again, Head Coach Robert 
Casto said: ‘‘We didn’t get caught up in 
all of that stuff.’’ He said their victory 
‘‘was just a byproduct of the hard work 
these kids have put in.’’ 
Indeed, every State championship is 
earned, not given, and this squad cer-
tainly earned it. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
players, 
coaches, and staff on their remarkable 
accomplishment.

BUSINESSES NEED WORKERS 
(Mrs. MCCLAIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. 
MCCLAIN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to be the voice for busi-
ness owners in my district, who, again, 
have been kicked while they are down. 
This majority and President Biden 
insist people need more unemployment 
benefits. They don’t. There is a record 
number of open jobs, more than 8 mil-
lion, of which only 266,000 of those jobs 
have been filled. That means that this 
administration is incentivizing people 
not to work. 
For President Biden to suggest that 
we need to spend another $4 trillion on 
the backs of our children and grand-
children to get back to work is insane. 
The jobs are there. The incentives to 
take the jobs are not. 
This nationwide problem is impact-
ing Michiganders. In fact, the biggest 
issue that I hear from business owners 
in my district is not about COVID or 
mask mandates or vaccines. They need 
workers. 
I am calling on the Speaker to actu-
ally go out into her district and learn 
what businesses actually need. They 
don’t need more money. They don’t 
need more stimulus. They need more 
employees.

COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
the energy crisis created by the Rus-
sian hack of the Colonial Pipeline is 
impacting my district in the worst pos-
sible way. Gas prices have skyrocketed. 
Lines are forming all across the great 
State of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to 
say what few politicians will, but what 
most of the Americans believe. We 
were attacked. We were attacked by a 
foreign entity, and the current admin-
istration has done nothing in response. 
When our leadership is weak, our Na-
tion suffers. 
You don’t believe me? 
Take a look outside. Our border has 
dissolved into ruin, gas prices are sky-
rocketing, and the dollar is worth less 
and less each day. Israel is burning, 
China is rising, and Russia attacks our 
homeland. 
All the while, the American people 
wonder when this administration will 
finally grow a backbone and stand firm 
against a growing wave of inter-
national tyranny. President Biden is 
weakening our defenses. The wolves are 
at the gates, and America’s leader is 
asleep at the wheel. 
But you know what? 
Thank heavens we have a President 
who doesn’t tweet mean things any-
more. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in proud recognition of the Moun-
tain Fifes and Drums music program in 
my own district in Twin Peaks, Cali-
fornia. 
This program is dedicated to the pa-
triotic 
mission 
of 
teaching 
young 
Americans, age 10 to 18, appreciation of 
and performance of 18th century mili-
tary music. 
They do this through instruction in 
classic musical instruments, such as 
the fife and the rope tension drum. I 
am extremely proud that the Mountain 
Fifes and Drums music program is per-
forming today in Mt. Vernon, appro-
priately, the home of our first Com-
mander in Chief, George Washington. 
It warms my heart that programs 
like this exist to teach this patriotic

RECOGNIZING THE CIVIL AIR 
PATROL 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding 
work of the Civil Air Patrol, otherwise 
known as CAP. I have had personal ex-
perience with Civil Air Patrol, as my 
son, Trey, was a member of the Civil 
Air Patrol while in high school. He 
gained valuable leadership skills that 
led him to graduating from the U.S. 
Naval Academy and now serving as a 
captain in the U.S. Marine Corps. 
The Civil Air Patrol protects our 
homeland by serving as the Air Force’s 
official auxiliary. CAP is active in all 
50 States. 
Last year alone, the Civil Air Patrol 
saved 130 lives while responding to dev-
astating natural disasters such as 
floods, 
hurricanes, 
tornadoes, 
and 
wildfires. CAP also helped States dis-
tribute COVID–19 test kits, personal 
protective equipment, and other essen-
tial goods, making it their largest mo-
bilization effort since World War II. 
Greater funding for the force will 
allow the Civil Air Patrol to train 
more pilots, continue its cadet pro-
gram, 
and 
purchase 
much-needed 
equipment. I want to thank the Civil 
Air Patrol national legislative coordi-
nator, Dr. Gerald Marketos, for his 
strong leadership and compassionate 
commitment to our Nation. I urge my 
colleagues to join me and Representa-
tive MIKE THOMPSON to support Civil 
Air Patrol funding appropriation re-
quests for fiscal year 2022.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
1448, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am so pleased that 
we have reported Congressman STEVE 
STIVERS’ bill, the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act, favorably out of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, and are 
bringing it to the floor today with the 
support of over 300 Members on both 
sides of the aisle. 
I am especially pleased to have nego-
tiated, with the help of Ranking Mem-
ber BOST, a new bipartisan version of 
the bill in time for Congressman STIV-
ERS to see it move before he leaves 
Congress. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
has been a leader in offering veterans 
with PTSD and other invisible wounds 
of war a wide spectrum of evidence- 
based treatment options and adjunc-
tive approaches to promote their men-
tal health and well-being. This bill en-
sures that veterans can participate in 
service dog training through pilot pro-
gram partnerships between VA and ac-
credited service dog training nonprofit 
organizations across the country. 
Madam Speaker, the bill also re-
moves current impediments to VA’s 
ability to prescribe mental health serv-
ice dogs for veterans with PTSD, and a 
newly added section ensures that VA’s 
current veterinary insurance benefit is 
also extended to those veterans receiv-
ing mental health service dogs through 
VA. 
I therefore ask my colleagues to join 
me in supporting the PAWS for Vet-
erans Therapy Act. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1448, as amended, the Puppies As-
sisting Wounded Servicemembers, or 
the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. 
This bill will help connect veterans 
with PTSD with service dogs by estab-
lishing a service dog training pilot pro-
gram, supporting service dog training 
organizations, and authorizing the VA 
to provide veterans with PTSD service 
dogs and veterinarian assistance for 
those service dogs. 
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act 
is sponsored by Congressman STEVE 
STIVERS
from 
Ohio. 
Representative 
STIVERS is an Army veteran. He has 
spent much of his congressional career 
advocating for his brothers and sisters 
in arms and has been a champion of 
this bill for many years. I am grateful 
for his leadership and commitment. 
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act 
will further the lifesaving bond that 
exists between man’s best friend and 
veterans in need, and it will continue 
our efforts to promote creative ways to 
support veterans who are struggling. 
I am proud to be one of the 313 co-
sponsors of the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act, and I am proud to vote in 
support of it today. I hope that all of 
my colleagues will join me. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN), my good 
friend and member of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee and original cosponsor 
of the bill. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act. I am incredibly proud to 
be co-leading this bipartisan bill to 
connect veterans with service dogs in 
their communities through a new pilot 
program at the VA. 
There are two organizations in Liv-
ingston County in my district that 
train dogs and place them with vet-
erans in need: Veteran Service Dogs in 
Howell, and Blue Star Service Dogs in 
Pinckney, Michigan. 
In 2019, I had the chance to visit Blue 
Star Service Dogs. It was incredible to 
see these dogs in action and to hear di-
rectly from the veterans about how 
these remarkable animals are helping 
them heal from depression, PTSD, and 
so many other invisible service-related 
wounds. 
The bill sets up a pilot program 
through the VA to partner with local 
nonprofits, just like the ones in my dis-
trict, to create work-therapy programs 
for veterans to train and potentially 
adopt service dogs. 
The issue is extremely personal to 
me. I am an Army wife, married to a 
30-year Army officer and Apache pilot. 
I have a stepdaughter currently on Ac-
tive Duty and another stepdaughter 
who is a doctor at the VA. I am also 
the mom of two wonderful rescue dogs, 
Rocky and Boomer. 
I have seen how big of an impact 
service dogs can have on people’s lives 
when it comes to dealing with mental 
illness, and that is why I am so pas-
sionate about this pilot program. 
When we make the decision to send 
men and women in to fight for our 
country, we make the decision to sup-
port them for the rest of their lives. 
The PAWS for Veterans Service 
Therapy Act helps us honor the com-
mitment and will have a real impact on 
the day-to-day well-being of our vet-
erans. 
I want to thank Representative STIV-
ERS for his leadership on this issue, and 
wish him all the best as he departs 
Congress. He is a Republican, but much 
more concerning for me, he is from 
Ohio, and we have still managed to 
work closely together on this issue. 
To my colleagues, if I can work with 
a graduate of Ohio State University, 
you can get on this darn bill. I urge 
both sides to join me in supporting the 
PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. STIVERS). He is an Army officer 
himself, and is the chief sponsor of this 
bill who has also served in this body 
and does a great job of that. He will be 
dearly missed. 
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1448, the 
PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. As a 
Major General in the Ohio National 
Guard and a Congressman who rep-
resents 43,000 veterans in my district, I 
know the struggle of the invisible 
wounds of war. 
I have met with a Vietnam veteran 
who was unable to leave his house for 
decades, a soldier who was deployed to 
Iraq who, when he returned, was ad-
dicted to heroin for 7 years, and an-
other who was under my command in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. His only goal 
was to take his fiancee out to dinner. 
Unfortunately, these three stories 
are not unique, but these three have 
happy endings. By working with serv-
ice dogs, these veterans got their lives 
back. Under the status quo, veterans 
aren’t able to access this lifesaving 
treatment that these three veterans 
have gotten. We have a chance today to 
change that by passing this bill. 
The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act 
would establish a pilot program. This 
is not even a permanent program; it is 
a pilot program at the VA to provide 
grants to local service dog training or-
ganizations so the veterans can benefit

from work-therapy by learning the art 
and science of training a dog for serv-
ice. After graduation, the veteran can 
adopt their canine partner if the vet-
eran and/or his VA health provider 
agree that that veteran will benefit 
from continuing courses of treatment 
from that therapy dog. 
I have seen the peer-reviewed infor-
mation from Kaiser-Permanente and 
Purdue University that shows that 
these programs work. They reduce the 
amount of psychotropic drugs that 
these veterans are on. They reduce sui-
cide. They improve overall mental 
health. 
Today, we lose 22 veteran and Active 
Duty members a day to suicide. We 
can’t let that go on. This can help that 
effort. It is a small price to pay. We 
can’t afford to wait any longer. 
I am, today, calling for us to pass 
this bill today, take it to the Senate, 
get it hotlined and signed and on the 
President’s desk by Memorial Day. 
I do want to thank the bipartisan 
folks who have helped on this: Chair-
man TAKANO; Ranking Member BOST; 
Representative RICE, our lead cospon-
sor; now-Governor Tim Walz, who was 
the sponsor in the last Congress; the 
floor leader STENY
HOYER; now-Gov-
ernor DeSantis; Sheriff Rutherford; Dr. 
DUNN; Representative SLOTKIN; and 
Representative SHERRILL. They have 
all played a very important role. 
I want to thank the staff on Mr. 
BOST’s 
team, 
Samantha 
Gonzalez, 
Christine Hill, Maria Tripplaar; on Mr. 
TAKANO’s staff, Matt Reel and Heather 
O’Beirne Kelly. Lastly, I want to thank 
my legislative director, Mimi Bair, for 
all her hard work, and my chief of 
staff, Nick, for his hard work on this as 
well. 
I know this is asking for a parting 
gift, but I would ask you all vote ‘‘yea’’ 
on this bill. I look forward to seeing 
this signed soon. I want to thank my 
colleagues for their bipartisan effort on 
this and earnest work to help our vet-
erans. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted that the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee can, once again, unite 
America, including Michiganders and 
the Buckeye State. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Miss RICE), my good 
friend and former member of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and lead 
Democratic cosponsor. 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 1448, the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act. No group in America is 
more likely to suffer from post-trau-
matic stress and other mental health 
conditions than our veterans. 
Tragically, as my friend Congress-
man STIVERS just said, this means that 
22 veterans are dying every single day 
by suicide. This is a crisis. We cannot 
look the other way. We must make 
sure that our veterans have access to 
every available mental health resource 
out there. 
The research on this issue is clear. 
Service dogs are proven to help people 
suffering from a wide array of mental 
health conditions, including PTSD. I 
have seen the evidence of this with my 
own eyes. Veterans have told me that 
they would not be here today if it 
weren’t for their service dog. That is 
how much these dogs mean and that is 
why this bill is so critical. 
b 1245 
By creating a pilot program on dog 
training therapy at the VA and pro-
viding service dogs to veterans, this 
bill won’t just improve lives; it will 
save them. 
I am incredibly proud to co-lead this 
bipartisan bill, and I thank my friend, 
Representative STEVE STIVERS, who is 
a great American and a true gen-
tleman, for introducing it. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in 
supporting this bill today. Madam 
Speaker, I also thank the great chair-
man of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, Congressman TAKANO. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Puppies Assist-
ing Wounded Servicemembers for Vet-
erans Therapy Act or the PAWS Act. 
Americans enjoy the blessings of 
hard-earned peace and liberty because 
of our warriors who answer the call to 
defend our country. Our men and 
women in uniform are a constant re-
minder of the true source of our Na-
tion’s greatness. 
In middle Tennessee, we have a proud 
history of military service. Our vet-
erans represent the very best of Amer-
ica, and they deserve our full support 
when it comes to ensuring that they 
have access to the resources they need 
to help them live a meaningful, produc-
tive post-service life. 
It is widely acknowledged that the 
suicide rate for veterans is tragically 
high, as 20 veterans are lost to suicide 
every day. We need to address this 
problem. 
No one can deny the emotional and 
psychological benefits of man’s best 
friend, but for our service veterans, 
that connection has an even greater 
impact. Psychiatric service dogs paired 
with veterans suffering from post-trau-
matic stress disorder have been shown 
to provide hope, independence, secu-
rity, and companionship. 
As I travel my home State and speak 
with our Nation’s heroes, I have heard 
how service dogs help improve their 
quality of life, and I have even heard 
that had it not been for their service 
dog, they wouldn’t be with us today. 
The PAWS Act would pair more serv-
icemembers with quality service dogs 
trained by reputable organizations. 
Every veteran has earned a life after 
their military service free of post-trau-
matic stress disorder that too often 
leads to suicide. In that regard, we 
should do everything we can to ensure 
their well-being. In my view, passage of 
the PAWS Act is a minimum down pay-
ment on what we owe these brave 
Americans. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in letting our veterans know that Con-
gress stands with them on their path to 
healing. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
STIVERS, for his leadership on this bill 
and wish him success as he leaves the 
House next week. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
1448, the PAWS for Veterans Therapy 
Act. 
From a personal standpoint, this leg-
islation would require the Department 
of Veterans Affairs to collaborate with 
nongovernmental entities and carry 
out a service dog pilot program to ad-
dress post-deployment mental health 
and PTSD in our veterans. 
I have a big community of more than 
136,000 veterans in Puerto Rico, and 
well-trained service animals provide 
disabled veterans with PTSD numerous 
benefits. For example, they can be 
trained to wake up veterans from 
nightmares, interrupt flashbacks, and 
quite literally watch their backs. 
There is growing evidence that serv-
ice animal intervention really works. 
Veterans report that animal training 
can help mitigate the effects of intru-
sive memories while grounding them in 
the present moment. A growing body of 
research also shows that patients with 
service animals experience a better 
quality of life, lower levels of the stress 
hormone 
cortisol, 
and 
increased 
chances of sustaining meaningful em-
ployment. 
As we all know, the Department of 
Veterans 
Affairs 
is 
a 
leader 
in 
healthcare and research for veterans, 
and this bill will provide an oppor-
tunity to support a growing standard of 
care for our veterans. As such, that is 
the reason I support the bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 
1448. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. BOST), my great friend, for yield-
ing me time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the PAWS for Veterans Therapy 
Act. 
I am a proud original cosponsor on 
General STIVERS’ bill. This bipartisan 
bill supports veterans who are suffering 
from TBI and PTSD, and it helps them 
to live better and more fulfilling lives. 
And it does this with the assistance of 
man’s best friend. 
Dog owners around the world will tell

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2215 
May 12, 2021 
Service dogs have already been estab-
lished as a proven therapy for PTSD 
and other related challenges. Today’s 
legislation not only would allow these 
veterans to adopt a service dog but also 
give them the opportunity to take part 
in the training of that dog. 
Simply put, the PAWS for Veterans 
Therapy Act will save lives. 
I have seen firsthand what a service 
dog can mean to a veteran struggling 
with PTSD. In northeast Florida, we 
are blessed to have a group called K9s 
for Warriors, which pairs trained serv-
ice dogs with veterans. 
During my visits to K9s for Warriors, 
I have often had the opportunity to 
speak with these veterans and listen to 
their personal testimonies of survival. 
Many have told me: But for that dog, I 
would be dead today. 
Last Congress, we passed the PAWS 
for Veterans Therapy Act out of the 
House, but we were not successful in 
getting it through the Senate. That 
means, with around 20 veterans taking 
their lives each day, we have since lost 
7,300 veterans’ lives since we passed it 
last year. 
We cannot allow that to happen 
again. I call on the Senate to join the 
House and pass this bill and get it to 
the President’s desk to become law. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Before I close, I thank Chairman 
TAKANO for working with Representa-
tive STIVERS and myself to find com-
mon ground. I would be remiss if I did 
not also thank Majority Leader HOYER 
for his assistance, scheduling, and con-
sideration of this legislation before 
Representative 
STIVERS
leaves 
the 
House of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I also 
thank my colleague, the ranking mem-
ber, Congressman BOST from Illinois, 
for his bipartisanship. 
I do believe that H.R. 1448 is now in 
a form that would be acceptable to the 
Senate, and I am hopeful that it will 
pass. 
I wish our colleague from the State 
of Ohio (Mr. STIVERS) the best of luck 
on this new chapter in his life. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 1448, 
as amended, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. The SPEAKER pro 
tempore. The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1448, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) MATERNAL MORTALITY.—The term ‘‘ma-
ternal mortality’’ means a death occurring 
during or within a one-year period after 
pregnancy, caused by pregnancy-related or 
childbirth complications, including a sui-
cide, overdose, or other death resulting from 
a mental health or substance use disorder at-
tributed to or aggravated by pregnancy-re-
lated or childbirth complications. 
(2) POSTPARTUM AND POSTPARTUM PERIOD.— 
The terms ‘‘postpartum’’ and ‘‘postpartum 
period’’ refer to the 1-year period beginning 
on the last day of the pregnancy of an indi-
vidual. 
(3) 
PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED
DEATH.—The 
term ‘‘pregnancy-associated death’’ means a 
death of a pregnant or postpartum indi-
vidual, by any cause, that occurs during, or 
within 1 year following, the individual’s 
pregnancy, regardless of the outcome, dura-
tion, or site of the pregnancy. 
(4) PREGNANCY-RELATED DEATH.—The term 
‘‘pregnancy-related death’’ means a death of 
a pregnant or postpartum individual that oc-
curs during, or within 1 year following, the 
individual’s pregnancy, from a pregnancy 
complication, a chain of events initiated by 
pregnancy, or the aggravation of an unre-
lated condition by the physiologic effects of 
pregnancy. 
(5) RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUP.— 
The term ‘‘racial and ethnic minority group’’ 
has the meaning given such term in section 
1707(g)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 300u–6(g)(1)). 
(6) 
SEVERE
MATERNAL
MORBIDITY.—The 
term ‘‘severe maternal morbidity’’ means a 
health condition, including mental health 
conditions and substance use disorders, at-
tributed to or aggravated by pregnancy or 
childbirth that results in significant short- 
term or long-term consequences to the 
health of the individual who was pregnant. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 958. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the United States is 
the only industrialized nation where 
the maternal mortality rate is on the 
rise, and we have one of the highest 
rates of maternal mortality in the de-
veloped world. 
Black, American Indian, and Alaska 
Native moms die from complications 
from pregnancy at approximately three 
times the rate of White, Latina, Asian- 
American, and Pacific Islander women, 
regardless of income or education lev-
els. 
Today, women veterans are the fast-
est-growing cohort in the veteran pop-
ulation, and more than 40 percent of 
women veterans using VA for their 
healthcare are of reproductive age. 
Black women serve in high numbers 
and 
represent 
nearly 
one-third 
of 
women using VA for their healthcare. 
The Protecting Moms Who Served 
Act, introduced by Congresswoman 
LAUREN UNDERWOOD, would codify ma-
ternity care coordination in law and 
provide additional resources to the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs to ensure 
that veterans receive the best prenatal 
and postpartum care possible. 
Madam Speaker, we do not yet know 
if 
pregnant 
veterans 
have 
better, 
worse, or equal rates of maternal mor-
tality compared to nonveterans. This 
bill would address this knowledge gap 
by requiring the Government Account-
ability Office to conduct a comprehen-
sive study on maternal mortality and 
morbidity among veterans. 
This study would not only examine 
racial and ethnic disparities in mater-
nal mortality and morbidity but also 
would seek to capture data from Fed-
eral programs besides VA, including 
TRICARE and Medicaid as well as the 
Indian Health Service, private insur-
ance, and the uninsured. 
While there is not yet enough data to 
make 
an 
authoritative 
conclusion, 
there is some evidence that veterans 
who use VA have lower maternal mor-
tality rates than nonveterans. The 
study mandated by this bill would 
identify what best practices VA has 
implemented that result in better ma-
ternal health outcomes. 
Madam Speaker, last year, approxi-
mately 6,000 veterans using VA became 
new moms. Moms who have served our 
Nation exemplify strength and resil-
ience. Supporting moms means ensur-
ing gender equity, and that begins with 
health equity. I, therefore, ask my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the 
Protecting Moms Who Served Act. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 958, the Protecting Moms 
Who Served Act. 
Just 3 days ago, we celebrated Moth-
er’s Day, so it is particularly fitting to 
be here to discuss a bill to improve the 
care that is provided to veteran moth-
ers. 
Women are volunteering to serve in 
uniform at a rapid rate, and when they 
become 
veterans, 
they 
seek 
VA 
healthcare at a rapid rate as well. 
I am committed to making sure the 
VA is equipped to provide them with 
the high-quality care that they have 
earned. 
The Protecting Moms Who Served 
Act will strengthen VA’s maternity 
care coordination program. It will ex-
pand training on the physical and men-
tal health needs of pregnant and 
postpartum veterans. It will also re-
quire a GAO assessment of maternal 
health outcomes among women vet-
erans. 
I am grateful to the bill’s sponsor 
and my fellow Illinoisan, Congress-
woman UNDERWOOD, for introducing 
this bipartisan bill. I am pleased to 
support it this afternoon. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BROWNLEY), my 
good friend and chairwoman of the 
Subcommittee on Health, and also the 
cosponsor of this important piece of 
legislation. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 958, the 
Protecting Moms Who Served Act, 
which I was proud to co-lead with Con-
gresswoman UNDERWOOD, Congressman 
BILIRAKIS, 
and 
Congressman 
FITZPATRICK. 
Madam Speaker, this bill will ensure 
that veterans get the high-quality ma-
ternal care they have earned by codi-
fying the Maternity Care Coordination 
Program. Additionally, this bill will 
require the GAO to report on maternal 
mortality and morbidity among vet-
erans. 
I thank the chairman for his support 
on this issue, and I am proud that this 
bill passed the committee with broad 
bipartisan support. 
Madam Speaker, as you may know, 
among developed countries, the United 
States has one of the highest maternal 
mortality rates in the world, with an 
average rate of 17.2 deaths per 100,000 
live births. 
For women of color, the rates are 
even higher. For Black women, the ma-
ternal mortality rate is 41.7 deaths per 
100,000. And for American Indian and 
Alaska Native women, it is 28.3 deaths 
per 100,000 live births. More than 50 
percent of pregnancy-related deaths 
happen after delivery. 
Today, there are 2 million women 
veterans living in the United States, 
and women comprise the fastest grow-
ing subpopulation of both the military 
and veteran populations, yet many of 
their health needs go unaddressed in a 
VA system that has not evolved to eq-
uitably serve a rapidly changing popu-
lation. 
As the chairwoman of the Women 
Veterans Task Force and chair of 
House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee 
on Health, I am proud to join Congress-
woman UNDERWOOD, who has truly,

truly been a champion—she is the 
founder and co-chair of the Black Ma-
ternal Health Caucus—in fighting to 
end disparities in maternal care for 
women veterans. Our veterans have 
sacrificed so much for our country. It 
is past time that we address this in-
equity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support our women veterans 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 958. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS), my good friend. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
Ranking 
Member BOST
and 
Chairman TAKANO for their leadership. 
This bill is very important. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Protecting Moms Who 
Served Act, which I co-lead with my 
colleague and friend, LAUREN UNDER-
WOOD. I also thank Representative 
UNDERWOOD for her efforts on this bill 
to help ensure that all female veterans 
have access to the maternal healthcare 
and support they need and deserve. 
Our Nation’s heroes deserve the best 
possible care, and this legislation gets 
us one step closer to achieving that 
goal. Women are currently the fastest 
growing group within the veteran pop-
ulation, creating the greatest demand 
for maternity care ever faced by the 
VA. 
I have heard from my local VA med-
ical centers about the growing chal-
lenges they face in providing maternity 
coordination for female veterans. The 
demand on this maternity coordination 
process has significantly increased over 
the past few years, from an average of 
50 patients per year to now around 140, 
featuring a generally higher risk pa-
tient population than the private sec-
tor. 
My local veterans medical centers 
said that the additional program sup-
port and additional maternity care co-
ordinators would be crucial in meeting 
the growing demand, which this bill 
will provide. 
The bill will also provide community 
maternity care providers with training 
and support with respect to the unique 
needs of pregnant and postpartum vet-
erans, particularly regarding mental 
and behavioral health conditions in re-
lation to the service of the veterans in 
the Armed Forces—very important. 
Madam Speaker, these veterans hon-
orably served our country. It is only 
right that we provide the quality ma-
ternity care and support they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, again, I urge my 
colleagues to support this particular 
bill. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield as much time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD), my good friend and 
author of this bill, and a member of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on 
Health. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 958, 
the Protecting Moms Who Served Act, 
my bipartisan bill to address maternal 
mortality 
among 
veterans 
that 
I 
proudly introduced with Representa-
tive 
GUS
BILIRAKIS
and 
JULIA 
BROWNLEY and BRIAN FITZPATRICK. 
Madam Speaker, the United States is 
currently 
confronting 
a 
maternal 
health crisis. We have the highest ma-
ternal mortality rate in the developed 
world and significant racial and ethnic 
disparities in maternity health out-
comes. 
Some of the drivers of maternal mor-
tality and morbidity can even be more 
common in women who serve. For ex-
ample, one in three women veterans re-
port that they experience military sex-
ual trauma, which is linked with risk 
factors for pregnancy-related complica-
tions. 
With 
unacceptable 
maternal 
mortality rates for all U.S. mothers 
and unique risks for veterans, we must 
ensure that the VA is providing the 
highest quality maternal healthcare 
and support to moms who serve. 
My bipartisan Protecting Moms Who 
Served Act would codify VA’s mater-
nity healthcare and coordination pro-
grams, which offers screenings and 
treatments to pregnant veterans with 
mental health conditions and include 
measures to strengthen community 
partnerships with organizations that 
support new parents. 
The VA’s maternity care coordina-
tion programs have been successful in 
ensuring that veterans can receive 
high-quality, 
culturally 
appropriate 
care and robust support throughout 
pregnancy, during labor and delivery, 
and for the full yearlong postpartum 
period and beyond. By codifying and 
strengthening 
these 
programs, 
vet-
erans will continue to receive the 
world-class care and support that they 
have earned. 
The Protecting Moms Who Served 
Act would also invest in trainings for 
community maternity care providers 
so that nurses, midwives, and physi-
cians 
caring 
for 
pregnant 
and 
postpartum veterans understand the 
unique needs of veteran patients, par-
ticularly related to mental and behav-
ioral health conditions that might 
have been caused or exacerbated by 
military service or the transition back 
to civilian life. These trainings will en-
sure that veterans receive care that is 
responsive to the lingering physical 
and psychological impacts of their 
service. 
Finally, my bill will commission the 
first-ever comprehensive study of ma-
ternal mortality, morbidity, and racial 
and ethnic disparities for veterans. By 
having a complete understanding of the 
ways in which our Nation’s maternity 
health crisis extends to our veteran 
population, we can develop evidence- 
based solutions to improve outcomes 
and save veterans’ lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the Protecting Moms Who 
Served Act. I thank the chairman of 
the House Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs, Chairman TAKANO, for his leader-
ship to advance this critically impor-
tant bipartisan legislation—the first 
bill in our Black Maternal Health 
Momnibus Act to be considered here in 
the House. 
As a cofounder and co-chair of the 
Black Maternal Health Caucus, I am 
committed to advancing each bill in 
the Momnibus to save moms’ lives and 
support families. 
Madam Speaker, finally, I would also 
really like to thank—truly, it has been 
a pleasure to work with—Representa-
tive 
BILIRAKIS, 
Representative 
BROWNLEY, 
Representative 
FITZPATRICK, 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
BOST. Thank you for co-leading this 
bill with me. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted that 
we are taking this significant step in 
addressing the terrible mortality rates 
that we are facing among our Nation’s 
moms, especially our moms of color. 
And to the extent that we can shed 
light on this issue through this very 
important legislation being brought 
forward by Ms. UNDERWOOD and Ms. 
BROWNLEY, I think that this is truly, 
truly a tremendous step forward. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 958. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HAWAII NATIONAL FOREST STUDY 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 297) to require the Secretary of 
Agriculture to conduct a study on the

land that could be included in, a unit of 
the National Forest System in the 
State of Hawaii, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 297, sponsored by my Com-
mittee on Natural Resources’ col-
league, Representative ED CASE of Ha-
waii. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
legislation 
would require the Secretary of Agri-
culture, in coordination with the Ha-
waii Department of Land and Natural 
Resources, to conduct a study to iden-
tify lands in the State of Hawaii that 
merit inclusion in the National Forest 
System. 
Hawaii is one of the most eco-
logically diverse places in the world, 
home to 10 of the 13 world climate 
zones, with ecosystems ranging from 
the deserts to tropics, where plants and 
animals that found their way to Hawaii 
evolved like nowhere else. The study 
would consider how a Hawaii national 
forest could contribute to the con-
servation of this biodiversity not found 
elsewhere in the National Forest Sys-
tem. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 297 provides 
the first step in establishing a national 
forest in Hawaii and a basis for bring-
ing together local stakeholders to 
move forward the conversation on how 
to responsibly establish a national for-
est in Hawaii that benefits both Ha-
waii’s island communities as well as 
the National Forest Service. 
Madam Speaker, as we continue to 
work towards the Biden administra-
tion’s effort to protect 30 percent of 
U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and iden-
tify solutions to our climate and bio-
diversity crises, I hope we can all see 
the value in taking this step towards 
protecting Hawaii’s unique forest re-
sources and its native species. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 297, offered by our Natural Re-
sources 
Committee 
colleague, 
Con-
gressman CASE from Hawaii. This bill 
is the first step toward the creation of 
Hawaii’s first national forest. 
This bill requires a study to identify 
potential parcels of land that could 
later be incorporated into a national 
forest that would help fulfill the Na-
tional Forest System’s mission. 
Hawaii is one of the few States with-
out a national forest and the only 
State that has tropical rainforests. Ha-
waii’s rainforests are among the wet-
test places on Earth. This bill would 
help inventory how best to conserve 
and expand Hawaii’s unique forests and 
lay the groundwork for the establish-
ment of a national forest. 
While I question my friends from Ha-
waii on why they would be interested 
in potentially giving the Federal Gov-
ernment jurisdiction over any land in 
Hawaii, especially considering the un-
fortunate state of our national forests 
on the mainland, I do urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for his positive 
comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 297, the 
bill that I have co-introduced with my 
colleague from Hawaii, Representative 
KAIALI’I KAHELE. 
As Mr. SOTO and the ranking member 
have noted, this legislation would re-
quire the Secretary of Agriculture, in 
consultation with the State of Hawaii, 
to conduct a study to identify lands in 
the State of Hawaii that merit inclu-
sion in the National Forest System. 
This would be the first step in poten-
tially establishing a national forest in 
one of the few parts of our country 
with no such system. 
As my friend and colleague, Mr. 
SOTO, has noted, Hawaii is the most 
isolated island chain and one of the 
most ecologically diverse places in our 
world. Within our borders, we have 10 
of the 13 world climate zones, eco-
systems that range from the deserts to 
the tropics, where plants and animals 
that found their way to Hawaii evolved 
like nowhere else. 
A 2014 survey identified 9,975 endemic 
species in Hawaii, many of which are 
reliant on Hawaii’s fragile ecosystem, 
including our forests, to survive. How-
ever, since the onset of human arrival 
just centuries ago, Hawaii has lost al-
most half of its unique native forest 
cover and countless fauna and flora 
species. 
Despite these threats to our unique 
biodiversity, Hawaii remains one of 
eight States that does not have a na-
tional forest or grassland. The study 
authorized by the bill would take steps 
to correct this oversight. It would con-
sider how a Hawaii national forest 
could contribute to the conservation of 
this biodiversity not found elsewhere 
in our National Forest System while 
supporting the research mission of the 
Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry. 
It would help inventory where Ha-
waii’s native koa, ohi’a, and sandal-
wood forests can be conserved and ex-
panded for cultural and commercial 
practices. It would help identify where 
cultural sites could be better conserved 
and access expanded to the public and 
practitioners. And it would help pro-
vide the basis to bring together local 
stakeholders to advance the conserva-
tion of how to responsibly establish a 
national forest in Hawaii in a manner 
that will benefit both our island com-
munities and the National Forest Serv-
ice. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues in the Hawaii congressional 
delegation for their support. I thank 
the Committee on Natural Resources 
and Subcommittee on National Parks, 
Forests, and Public Lands chairs, rank-
ing members, members, and staff for 
their support and assistance in bring-
ing this bill to the floor.

I take my ranking member’s com-
ments to heart. I certainly hope that 
this study will not only evaluate and 
investigate how we can create a na-
tional forest in Hawaii but how we can 
make that a model for how national 
forests can and should be administered 
throughout our country. I endorse his 
concerns as to the administration of 
our national forests and, certainly, 
would look forward to working with 
him in our subcommittee and com-
mittee. 
As we continue to identify solutions 
to our climate and biodiversity crises, 
I hope we can all see the value in tak-
ing this step toward protecting our 
unique forest resources and their na-
tive species, along with providing im-
portant opportunities. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, Mr. WESTERMAN 
from Arkansas, for his positive com-
ments and bipartisan spirit, and I 
thank Mr. CASE. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 297. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

NATIONAL PULSE MEMORIAL 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 49) to designate the National 
Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South 
Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 49 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL PULSE 
MEMORIAL. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Pulse Memorial lo-
cated at 1912 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, 
Florida, 32806, is designated as the ‘‘National 
Pulse Memorial’’. 
(b) EFFECT OF DESIGNATION.—The national 
memorial designated by this section is not a 
unit of the National Park System and the 
designation of the National Pulse Memorial 
shall not require or permit Federal funds to 
be expended for any purpose related to that 
national memorial. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise, along with 
Representative 
DEMINGS
and 
Rep-
resentative MURPHY from central Flor-
ida, in strong support of our bill, H.R. 
49. 
Nearly 5 years ago, 49 angels lost 
their lives and 53 others were injured 
when a deranged gunman opened fire at 
the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Flor-
ida. 
You can see here photos of those who 
we lost, lives cut short. 
This horrific act of hate and terror 
against our LGBTQ and Latino com-
munity, African-American community, 
and Anglo community could have di-
vided us, but we came together strong-
er than ever before. 
Orlando swore as a community to 
never forget those we lost that night. 
Their 
stories, 
their 
images, 
their 
memories, and their spirits must live 
on in our hearts. 
We were all there for vigils in Or-
lando, where the bell rang 49 times for 
those angels we lost, and I am honored 
to say, across this Nation and all 50 
States, and many countries, we saw 
vigils also recognizing it, which is why 
it is so critical that this is a national 
memorial, because it was truly a na-
tional and international tragedy. 
To honor the fallen and survivors of 
this tragedy, I join my colleagues to 
introduce landmark legislation to des-
ignate the Pulse nightclub as a feder-
ally recognized national memorial site. 
This designation as a nonaffiliated Na-
tional Park Service national memorial 
would not require Federal funds, but it 
would honor the 49 lives taken on June 
12, 2016, as well as the survivors, the 
first responders who so heroically came 
to the rescue of so many others, and 
the entire central Florida community. 
Together, we will open minds and 
hearts. We will make the Pulse Memo-
rial a national symbol of hope, love, 
and change. 
I would like to, again, thank my 
amazing 
colleagues, 
Congresswoman 
VAL
DEMINGS
and 
Congresswoman 
STEPHANIE MURPHY, for joining me in 
leading this important legislation, and 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 49, offered by my colleague 
from Florida (Mr. SOTO). 
Nearly 5 years ago, on June 12, 2016, 
a senseless and horrific mass shooting 
was perpetrated by an ISIS-inspired 
coward at the Pulse nightclub in Or-
lando, Florida. In the attack, 49 inno-
cent people were killed and 53 were 
wounded. 
This bill, and the number H.R. 49, is 
a thoughtful tribute to the 49 individ-
uals killed in the attack. In the after-
math of the unspeakable tragedy at 
Pulse, the owner of the club estab-
lished a nonprofit called the onePULSE 
Foundation to memorialize those who 
died in the mass murder, known as the 
49. 
The foundation worked quickly to es-
tablish an interim memorial in Or-
lando and has been working to build a 
permanent Pulse memorial and mu-
seum, which will be completed in com-
ing years. 
This bill would redesignate the Pulse 
Memorial in Orlando, Florida, as the 
‘‘National Pulse Memorial.’’ The bill 
makes clear that this memorial will 
not be a unit of the National Park Sys-
tem and that designation as a national 
memorial does not require any Federal 
funds to be expended. 
The House’s action on this bill today 
complements the United States Senate 
resolution passed on June 11, 2020, hon-
oring the victims of this tragedy, as 
well as the State of Florida’s designa-
tion of June 12 as Pulse Remembrance 
Day. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, Mr. WESTERMAN 
from Arkansas, for his bipartisan sup-
port. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
she may consume to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to ask my colleagues to join 
us in supporting H.R. 49 to finally des-
ignate the Pulse nightclub as a na-
tional memorial in honor and remem-
brance of the 49 people who lost their 
lives on this tragic night 5 years ago. 
‘‘Orlando Strong’’ is more than just a 
slogan. It is a promise to support each 
other and to never forget those we lost 
and those who were injured on that 
tragic night. By establishing Pulse as a 
national memorial, we will honor their 
memories and remind ourselves of that 
promise. 
My bishop once called the Pulse 
nightclub a place for late-night fellow-
ship, a place for fun, laughter, family, 
and friendship. These are such funda-
mental things. We know this now more 
than ever. After the pandemic, we see 
just how precious these things truly 
are. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the House 
for moving forward with this legisla-
tion. I thank my constituents. I thank 
the cosponsors, Congresswoman MUR-
PHY and Congressman SOTO, for their 
work to make this day a reality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2220 
May 12, 2021 
As we pass this legislation, I know 
that the memories of those who died 
will live on in our hearts. They will not 
be defined by their tragic deaths 
through gun violence but by the lives 
they lived, the people they touched, 
and the love they gave. 
Paraphrasing Dr. King: So I decided 
as an individual to stick with love be-
cause, yes, hate is too great of a burden 
to bear, and it has been on me, my 
community, my city, and my Nation 
for too long. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for joining us in supporting 
this legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
SOTO) for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 49 to designate 
the Pulse nightclub as a national me-
morial site and to honor those whose 
lives were taken by a gunman with 
hate in his heart. 
b 1330 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship and his response with H.R. 49 
along with Congresswoman MURPHY. I 
visited with Mr. SOTO in Florida near 
Orlando and actually toured the Pulse 
nightclub site, and what a poignant 
visitation that was. 
Almost 5 years ago, the Nation 
awoke to the heartbreaking news of a 
mass shooting that unfolded at a night-
club in Orlando. Forty-nine lives were 
taken, and 53 others were injured. It 
was another devastating loss to the 
LGBTQ-plus community and our Na-
tion. 
The gunman had targeted Pulse 
nightclub, a nightclub frequented by 
Orlando’s Latino and LGBTQ-plus com-
munities. This was a safe place for 
many of the people who were there 
that night. The shooter violated a safe 
space where LGBTQ people, and, in this 
case, LGBTQ-plus people of color were 
able to be themselves and to live and 
dance freely without fear or judgment. 
Our community—that is, the LGBTQ- 
plus community—is still healing from 
this attack, and families and friends 
are still mourning the loss of their 
loved ones. I will never forget waking 
up in my Washington, D.C. apartment 
as I was scrolling through the news, 
and I was just in disbelief that another 
shooting had occurred. Since then, we 
have had so many other senseless 
shootings. 
By designating the Pulse nightclub 
as a national memorial site, we can al-
ways remember the vibrant lives of 
those we lost. This memorial will serve 
as a reminder that we cannot stop 
fighting for equality. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 49. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California, Chair 
TAKANO, for taking the pilgrimage to 
the Pulse Memorial, along with me and 
others and listening and paying re-
spects. So I appreciate that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. Five 
years ago, 49 people were murdered in a 
violent, hate-filled, mass shooting at 
an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando, the 
Pulse nightclub. I thank Congressman 
SOTO for his leadership and our col-
leagues, Congresswoman MURPHY and 
Congresswoman DEMINGS. I, too, had 
the opportunity to go to the site and to 
read the beautiful notes written about 
the young lives that were taken that 
night, and the very special place that 
Pulse was. 
I was, in fact, in Florida this week-
end with Barbara Poma, the owner of 
the Pulse nightclub, who was leading 
an effort to turn this site into not only 
a sacred place, but a museum. I shared 
with her what for young LGBTQ people 
nightclubs were and still are, a place of 
sanctuary, a safe place where people 
can be themselves where they go to 
dance, to be with friends, and to share 
a sense of community. That was all 
shattered by the brutality of the 
events of the evening in which this oc-
curred. 
This shooting was an act of terror 
and an act of hate. It left the Nation 
really grasping for answers. In the days 
that followed, we heard stories of in-
credible courage, bravery, and resolve. 
But mostly, there was unspeakable 
pain for those who lost someone in this 
attack. 
Although I pray that the passage of 5 
years has brought some measure of re-
lief, the truth is that their pain will 
never fully go away. It is critical to 
designate this memorial today so that 
our country never forgets those who 
were lost. Congressman SOTO will re-
member we had on the steps of the Cap-
itol a beautiful remembrance with full- 
sized photographs of each of these 
young people who had so much to give 
and so much to offer whose lives were 
taken that night. 
But in addition to remembering, it is 
also important that we take action to 
do everything we can to make sure 
that nothing like this ever happens 
again. Individuals who are convicted of 
hate crimes should never own a gun, 
and that is why I plan to reintroduce 
the Disarm Hate Act to do just that, 
because we know if you commit a hate 
crime, it often escalates and those 
crimes become increasingly violent as 
time goes on. No American family 
should have to suffer because of the 
loophole that currently exists today. 
Let’s disarm hate once and for all. 
Today, we remember the 49 young 
lives lost at the Pulse nightclub in Or-
lando. Let’s be sure that we designate 
this memorial officially, so that every-
one will know the story of what hap-
pened to these young people who were 
killed because they were in a place of 
sanctuary, and safety, and community, 
but because they were members of the 
LGBTQ community, our allies. 
Madam Speaker, I thank again the 
gentleman for yielding and for his in-
credible leadership on this issue, and I 
urge all my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. WESTERMAN. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) for making the pilgrimage 
and paying his respects at the memo-
rial. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I have 
no further requests for time, and I 
would inquire whether my colleague 
has any remaining speakers on his side. 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN. 
In 
closing, 
Madam Speaker, again, I urge adoption 
of H.R. 49, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) and 
our colleagues across the aisle for their 
bipartisan support of this really impor-
tant bill for our Nation. I thank also 
Representatives 
DEMINGS, 
MURPHY, 
CICILLINE, and TAKANO for their sup-
port here today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 49. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 478, introduced 
by our colleague, Representative TOM 
O’HALLERAN from Arizona, authorizes 
the United States to place 55.3 acres of 
historically and culturally significant 
land into trust on behalf of the Gila 
River Indian Community of Arizona. 
This parcel of land is commonly re-
ferred to as the Blackwater Trading 
Post Land, because it once contained 
the Ellis family’s Blackwater Trading 
Post which sold goods to members of 
the Gila River Indian Community since 
the 1930s. 
After purchasing the trading post in 
2010, the community found around 1,000 
cultural artifacts on the property, in-
cluding 126 Akimel O’odham baskets. 
Following this discovery, the commu-
nity decided to apply to take the parcel 
of land into trust. 
However, legislation is required for 
this exchange, as the community’s 2004 
water settlement explicitly requires 
that any lands located outside of the 
community’s reservation boundaries be 
taken into trust through congressional 
action. 
Passage of H.R. 478 will ultimately 
allow the community to preserve a 
piece of their heritage by incorporating 
this contiguous parcel of land into its 
reservation land base. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative 
O’HALLERAN
for 
his 
work on this legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 478, the Blackwater Trading Post 
Land Transfer Act. This bill will place 
approximately 55 acres of land in Pinal 
County, Arizona, into trust for the Gila 
River Indian Community. According to 
the Tribe, these lands and the former 
Blackwater Trading Post have a histor-
ical connection to the Tribe, as the 
trading post served many Tribal mem-
bers since at least the 1930s. In 2010, the 
Tribe purchased the Blackwater Trad-
ing Post and surrounding lands after 
the former owners retired. 
Pursuant to the 2004 Arizona Water 
Rights Settlement Act, the Gila River 
Tribe cannot acquire off-reservation 
lands into trust absent an act of Con-
gress. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. In closing, Madam Speak-
er, I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation for the Gila River Commu-
nity of Arizona, as corrected. I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GALLEGO) who knows the State very 
well. 
I urge support of the Gila River In-
dian Community of Arizona’s incorpo-
ration of this additional land. I thank 
Representative 
O’HALLERAN
for 
his 
leadership and the bipartisan support 
of 
the 
ranking 
member, 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN from Arkansas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 478. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

(H.R. 810) to amend the National Trails 
System Act to direct the Secretary of 
the Interior to conduct a study on the

resentatives of the United States of America in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2222 
May 12, 2021 
The proposed trail would extend ap-
proximately 550 miles from Niobrara, 
Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, 
tracing the route taken by Chief 
Standing Bear and the Ponca people 
during Federal Indian removal and 
their return to Nebraska. 
The trail would commemorate and 
elevate the story of Chief Standing 
Bear, including the trial and historic 
1879 court case where he became the 
first Native American to be recognized 
as a person in a Federal court. 
The trail would memorialize the 
courage, honor, and fortitude of Chief 
Standing Bear and the Ponca people as 
they struggled to return to their home-
land to bury the son of Chief Standing 
Bear—serving as a reminder of their 
fight to achieve justice, freedom, and 
equality. 
I would like to thank Representative 
FORTENBERRY for championing this im-
portant legislation and for his efforts 
to bring about a greater understanding 
of our U.S. history and Tribal sov-
ereignty. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this good bipartisan 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1345 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the major-
ity for the bipartisan support on this 
good piece of legislation. 
H.R. 810, authored by our colleague 
from Nebraska, Congressman FORTEN-
BERRY, directs the Secretary of the In-
terior to study the feasibility of desig-
nating the Chief Standing Bear Na-
tional Historic Trail. 
Chief Standing Bear of the Ponca 
Tribe is one of Nebraska’s most impor-
tant historical figures and is honored 
here in the Capitol as one of Nebras-
ka’s contributions to the National 
Statuary Hall Collection. 
Chief Standing Bear led his people 
through a crisis that began with its 
displacement by droves of westward- 
bound settlers. The Ponca Tribe moved 
twice in search of new land but had no 
success. Finally, in 1877, the U.S. Gov-
ernment forced their relocation. 
By 1878, when they reached their des-
tination in Oklahoma’s Indian Terri-
tory, 
starvation 
and 
disease 
had 
claimed almost a third of the Tribe. 
Among the dead was Bear Shield, the 
first son of Standing Bear. 
Standing Bear’s desire to honor his 
son’s wish that he be buried in his Ne-
braska birthplace, at a time when Na-
tive Americans could not legally leave 
their reservations without government 
permission, led to the trial for which 
he is best remembered today. The case 
established 
that 
Native 
Americans 
were persons under the law and are en-
titled to the same rights as anyone else 
in the Nation. During that case, the 
words of Chief Standing Bear, pleading 
on behalf of his Tribe, moved the Na-
tion. 
The Chief Standing Bear Trail, ex-
tending approximately 550 miles from 
Nebraska to Oklahoma, follows the 
route taken by Chief Standing Bear 
and the Ponca people during Federal 
Indian removal. If supported by the 
study, any designation of the trail 
would require additional action from 
the Natural Resources Committee and 
the Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. 
FORTENBERRY). 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, first of all, let me thank my friends 
and colleagues, Mr. SOTO from Florida 
and Mr. WESTERMAN from Arkansas, for 
shepherding this important measure. 
Madam Speaker, right outside this 
door, in Statuary Hall, there is a very 
large statue with the person’s hand ex-
tended like that, as if to say welcome, 
welcome all of America to this institu-
tion. That statue is of Chief Standing 
Bear. And today, I am so proud that we 
are considering a bill to honor his cour-
age and sacrifice. 
As we have heard, here is a bit of his 
story. Chief Standing Bear and his 
Ponca people were relocated from their 
ancestral homeland in Niobrara, Ne-
braska, to what was called Indian Ter-
ritory in Oklahoma. As we learned, 
Chief Standing Bear’s son fell ill, and 
he made his son a promise that he 
would bury him back in his ancestral 
homeland. When that happened, Stand-
ing Bear took that harrowing journey 
one cold winter back home, and for 
that, he was arrested for leaving the 
reservation. 
During his trial, Chief Standing Bear 
raised his hand and said: ‘‘I am a man. 
The same God made us both.’’ The 
judge was so moved by his testimony 
that he declared that Native Ameri-
cans were to be considered persons for 
consideration under the law. That 
wasn’t until 1879. 
Madam Speaker, Chief Standing Bear 
didn’t seek to be a civil rights leader, 
but he changed the course of history in 
that moment, all for the sake of human 
dignity and human rights. I am proud 
to offer this bill today in his honor and 
for the good of all America. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I urge support of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I wholly 
support this bill, and I thank the lead-
ership of Mr. FORTENBERRY from Ne-
braska and the ranking member, Mr. 
WESTERMAN from Arkansas. 
This is a fitting honor for human 
rights and Tribal sovereignty. I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 810. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-

Madam Speaker, H.R. 1688, intro-
duced 
by 
Representative 
RUBEN 
GALLEGO from Arizona, our outgoing 
subcommittee chairman—and I appre-
ciate his leadership on that—amends 
and 
reauthorizes 
several 
programs 
within the Indian Child Protection and 
Family Violence Prevention Act in 
order to improve the prevention, inves-
tigation, treatment, and prosecution of 
family violence, child abuse, and child 
neglect 
involving 
Native 
American 
children and families. 
There is an enormous need for family 
violence prevention and treatment re-
sources in Tribal communities. Native 
children experience child abuse and ne-
glect at an elevated rate, which leads 
many to require special education serv-
ices, to be more likely to be involved in 
the juvenile and criminal justice sys-
tems, and to have long-term mental 
health needs. 
Passage of H.R. 1688 will create tech-
nical assistance programs in the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs, allow for urban 
Indian organizations to partner with

Tribal governments, and ensure cul-
turally competent care. 
I thank Representative GALLEGO for 
introducing and championing this vi-
tally important legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 1688. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1688 amends 
the Indian Child Protection and Fam-
ily Violence Prevention Act to reau-
thorize three programs administered 
by the Department of Health and 
Human Services and the Department of 
the Interior that are intended to pre-
vent cases within Indian communities 
where child abuse, neglect, family vio-
lence, and trauma may occur and to 
provide treatment for victims of Indian 
child sexual abuse. 
The authorization for appropriations 
for the three programs expired in 1997. 
The bill also makes several technical 
changes to the underlying statute, re-
quiring agencies to report on grant 
awards. 
Advocates cite the Indian Child Pro-
tection and Family Violence Preven-
tion Act as the only federally dedicated 
child abuse prevention and victim 
treatment funding for Tribal govern-
ments, but Congress has only appro-
priated approximately $5 million for 
this program. 
I appreciate the sponsor bringing at-
tention to this important issue as 
abuse, neglect, and violence have no 
place in any community. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GALLEGO). 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
1688, the Native American Child Pro-
tection Act. 
I first want to thank my friend and 
the dean of the House, Congressman 
DON YOUNG, for working with me on 
this bill to ensure Native American and 
Alaska Native Tribes have the re-
sources they need to keep Native chil-
dren safe from abuse and neglect. 
Last week, I joined my colleagues in 
recognizing the National Day of Aware-
ness for Missing and Murdered Indige-
nous Women and Girls. 
When I was chairman of the Sub-
committee for Indigenous Peoples of 
the United States last Congress, I held 
the first-ever House committee hearing 
on MMIW, which paved the way for 
critical bills like the Not Invisible Act 
and Savanna’s Act. 
At that hearing, we learned that, in 
addition to experiencing incredibly 
high murder rates, one in three Native 
women experience domestic violence in 
their lives. That statistic is even more 
horrifying when we recognize that, in 
49 to 70 percent of cases, men who 
abuse their partners also abuse their 
children. 
Despite this fact, Tribes have never 
received the resources they need to ad-
dress child abuse and neglect in their 
communities. My bill changes that. 
My bill will improve the prevention, 
treatment, investigation, and prosecu-
tion of child abuse and neglect in In-
dian Country by ensuring Tribes have 
the resources they need to take care of 
Native children in culturally com-
petent ways. It does so by modernizing 
and 
reauthorizing 
three 
programs 
originally passed as part of the Indian 
Child Protection and Family Violence 
Prevention Act. 
The Indian Child Protection and 
Family Violence Prevention Act be-
came law in 1990, after being authored 
by the late Arizona Senator John 
McCain in response to widespread re-
ports that Native children were being 
physically and sexually abused in BIA- 
run boarding schools in the 1980s. 
The original purpose of the law was 
to identify the scope of the under-
reported child abuse in Indian Country, 
fill gaps in Tribal child welfare serv-
ices, improve coordination between 
child welfare and domestic violence 
programs, and provide funds for treat-
ment in Indian Country. 
But the horrible truth is that the 
grant programs created by this law in 
1990 were never funded, never enacted, 
and were allowed to expire in 1997. My 
bill revives the three grant programs 
from the original act that are still 
sorely needed in Indian Country be-
cause the problems identified by Con-
gress in 1990 still exist today. 
Specifically, my bill does: one, pro-
vides Tribes with more funding for cul-
turally competent child abuse treat-
ment; two, allows Tribes to choose to 
partner with urban Indian organiza-
tions or Tribal consortiums to identify 
and treat victims of abuse; three, cre-
ates a national child resource and fam-
ily services center to provide technical 
assistance and support to Tribes in 
maintaining child welfare programs; 
four, authorizes enough funds for every 
Tribe to hire at least one child welfare 
case manager to help investigate and 
prosecute instances of abuse; and, five, 
authorizes 
the 
only 
Tribal-specific 
grant program aimed at preventing 
child abuse in Indian Country. 
A core part of the Federal Govern-
ment’s trust responsibility is pro-
tecting the most vulnerable members 
of 
indigenous 
communities, 
Native 
children. Right now, we are failing in 
that responsibility. 
Passing this bill today allows us to 
take an important step forward in pro-
tecting Native children and upholding 
our trust responsibility to Tribes. 
I am proud of the strong bipartisan 
support this legislation received in the 
Natural Resources Committee last year 
when it passed and when it passed by a 
voice vote in the House. I urge all of 
my colleagues in the House to join me 
once again in supporting this impor-
tant piece of legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mr. 
YOUNG), the dean of the House and a 
true expert on Tribal issues. 
Mr. 
YOUNG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for the com-
pliment. I have been called a lot of 
things on this floor, including dean. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this legislation. I thank my 
friend, Representative GALLEGO, for in-
troducing it. 
This is a good bill. It improves a bill 
which I passed 30 years ago, and it is 
long overdue to make sure that it is 
running right. 
As has been said, it establishes a new 
National Indian Resource Services Cen-
ter, which was created over 30 years 
ago. We are reauthorizing these pro-
grams, making sure they work. 
It is badly needed because of actions 
across the country with indigenous 
people. We hope the victims will have 
better service than they have in the 
past. 
I congratulate the author of the leg-
islation. I am a sponsor of the legisla-
tion also. This is a good bill, and I urge 
the passage of this bill. 
All of my colleagues who understand, 
let’s do the job we were told to do when 
we became trustees of the indigenous 
people of this great Nation of ours. 
Again, I thank the chairman, the au-
thor of the legislation, and the ranking 
member for all the work they have 
done. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I urge support of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
We had extensive hearings on these 
issues in the Subcommittee for Indige-
nous Peoples of the United States, and 
it became clear we needed resources 
and technical assistance to protect Na-
tive American children and families in 
addition to what they are getting now. 
I thank our outgoing chair, Mr. 
GALLEGO, for his leadership on this; the 
dean of the House, Representative DON 
YOUNG, for his amazing leadership in 
working 
together; 
former 
Member 
COOK, who participated in these meet-
ings extensively; as well as now-Sec-
retary Deb Haaland, one of the first 
Native American women to serve in the 
Congress. I thank Ranking Member 
WESTERMAN
for helping us get this 
done in a bipartisan fashion. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 1688. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

YSLETA DEL SUR PUEBLO AND 
ALABAMA-COUSHATTA 
TRIBES 
OF TEXAS EQUAL AND FAIR OP-
PORTUNITY ACT 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2208) to restore an opportunity 
for tribal economic development on 
terms that are equal and fair, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2208 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ysleta del 
Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of 
Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity Act’’. 
SEC. 2. AMENDMENT. 
The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama 
and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Res-
toration Act (Public Law 100–89; 101 Stat. 
666) is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘SEC. 301. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
‘‘Nothing in this Act shall be construed to 
preclude or limit the applicability of the In-
dian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 
et seq.).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2208, intro-
duced 
by 
Representative 
VERONICA 
ESCOBAR
from 
Texas, 
amends 
the 
Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and 
Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Res-
toration Act of 1987 to clarify that the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act applies 
to both the Pueblo and the Tribe. 
The 
Alabama-Coushatta 
Tribe 
of 
Texas was federally terminated in 1954. 
This wrong was followed in 1968 by ter-
mination of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, 
also known as the Tigua Tribe. Con-
gress 
rightfully 
restored 
both 
the 
Pueblo and the Tribe by enacting the 
aforementioned 
Restoration 
Act 
of 
1987. 
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
was enacted just one year later, in 1988. 
The framework that it created should 
have applied to both the Pueblo and 
the Tribe, just as it did to every other 
Tribe. 
However, since the Restoration Act 
was passed at a time when Indian gam-
ing was just emerging and Federal reg-
ulations had not yet been imple-
mented, it contains a section regarding 
gaming. 
We know from the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD that the intent of this section 
of the Restoration Act was to clarify 
Indian gaming policy at the time, not 
to completely prohibit gaming on these 
lands in perpetuity. 
But that is what is occurring. The 
language in the Restoration Act has 
been used by the State of Texas to re-
peatedly stymie the Pueblo’s and the 
Tribe’s ability to engage in class II 
gaming, much to the detriment of the 
economic health and well-being of both 
the Pueblo and the Tribe. 
Additionally, the only other federally 
recognized Tribe in Texas, the Kick-
apoo Traditional Tribe, is allowed to 
operate a class II gaming facility, as 
they were restored by Congress in 1983, 
without any type of gaming restric-
tions. 
H.R. 2208 remedies this inequality by 
clarifying that the Pueblo and the 
Tribe, like the Kickapoo, have the 
same rights and responsibilities under 
the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act as 
virtually every other federally recog-
nized Tribe in the United States. 
This legislation confers no new or 
special rights to the Pueblo or the 
Tribe, nor does it in any way limit the 
existing rights of the State of Texas. 
This is simply a matter of parity and 
fairness, and I urge adoption of this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2208, sponsored by 
my 
colleague 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
ESCOBAR), would amend the act of Con-
gress that restored the Federal rec-
ognition of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
and Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. 
The amendment would override a 
gaming limitation imposed by Con-
gress on the Tribes, thereby author-
izing the Tribes to operate casinos reg-
ulated not under Texas law, as Federal 
law currently provides, but under the 
Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act 
of 1988. 
The question of whether Texas law or 
the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ap-
plies to the two Tribes is no longer 
under serious dispute. Federal courts 
have settled the question, and the re-
sult of the litigation is that the two 
Tribes may not conduct gaming under 
the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, un-
less Congress enacts a measure to 
allow them to do so. 
The bill enjoys significant local sup-
port in the communities around the 
reservations of the two Tribes, and the 
members who represent the Tribes 
strongly support enactment of the 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to call on my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 2208, the Ysleta del Sur Pueb-
lo and Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of 
Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity Act. 
On March 26 of this year, I intro-
duced this important bipartisan bill 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Representative 
TONY GONZALES from the Texas 23rd 
Congressional District, to ensure that 
Native American Tribes are covered by 
the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
Specifically, this bipartisan bill aims 
to correct a problem of exclusion that 
has been affecting only two Tribes in 
the entire United States—the Ysleta 
del Sur Pueblo and the Alabama- 
Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas— 
since 1987, when Congress passed the 
Restoration Act and the Indian Gam-
ing Regulatory Act. 
The passage of these 1987 laws inad-
vertently created uncertainty about 
which law these Tribes were covered 
under and what gaming activities they 
were allowed to offer on their reserva-
tions. 
Passed in this Chamber during the 
116th Congress, this bill offers a com-
monsense solution that will ensure 
that the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Ala-
bama-Coushatta Tribes are covered by 
the Indiana Gaming Regulatory Act, 
which would provide these Native 
American communities with a critical 
economic lifeline and an opportunity 
to recover from the harmful inequity 
that they have faced. 
Simply put, this bill would provide 
fairness for these two Tribes, like the 
only other federally recognized Tribe 
in our State, the Kickapoo Traditional 
Tribe of Texas. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
protecting our Native American Tribes’ 
sovereignty and ensuring that they 
have the ability to engage in the same 
way other Tribes are able to. 
The coronavirus pandemic has im-
pacted everyone, but the economic and 
health crisis has been devastating to 
our Tribes, and this bill offers an op-
portunity for them to safely rebuild 
their economies. The reason our Tribes 
have suffered so disproportionately is 
because of long-term disinvestment 
and generational lack of adequate ac-
cess to healthcare and economic assist-
ance. 
Communities around the country are 
eager to repair their economies fol-
lowing the impact of COVID–19, and 
our Tribes are no different. But they 
need the clarity this bill would provide 
so that they can better control their 
economic future. 
The parity this bill would create for 
these Tribes would also create long 
overdue opportunities for them to suc-
ceed by supporting job creation and 
their ability to generate revenue that 
would fund new housing, educational 
programs, and medical facilities for 
their people and the surrounding com-
munities, among so many other things. 
Now, more than ever, more must be 
done to protect other Native American 
Tribes, their families, businesses, and 
their economic prosperity.

May 12, 2021 
By passing this bill, Congress would 
finally grant the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 
and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes the 
rights, 
opportunities, 
and 
stability 
they have long been denied. 
Therefore, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
important piece of legislation, and I 
am grateful to the leaders in the com-
mittee for their support. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mr. 
YOUNG), the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, chairman, and 
the sponsor for this legislation. 
It is a strange thing. If you hang 
around here long enough, you keep see-
ing the other end of your tail. We in-
troduced these bills, and there was 
never any intention to exclude these 
two Tribes, never. 
When Mo Udall and I started the 
gaming law, everybody thought we 
were nuts. It has worked. But never 
were these two Tribes to be excluded. 
In fact, this legislation rectifies that 
problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be a 
sponsor of the legislation, who worked 
with you to try to get this done. This 
will be justice served to all. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, in 
closing, I support this bipartisan bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank both Represent-
ative 
ESCOBAR
and 
Representative 
GONZALES for their leadership to right 
this wrong, this injustice. 
I thank the dean of the House, Rep-
resentative YOUNG, for his very inform-
ative history lesson on the legislation. 
I 
also 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
WESTERMAN for his bipartisan support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to

ignees, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
The rule deems as passed H. Res. 379, 
a resolution to dismiss the election 
contest in Illinois’ 14th Congressional 
District. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to

pension bills considered on May 11 or 
May 12. This authority lasts through 
May 14. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are 
here today to provide consideration of 
two important bills to protect and sup-
port our constituents. First is the 
Comprehensive Debt Collection Im-
provement Act, which will create pro-
tections 
for 
servicemembers, 
small 
businesses, students, and other con-
sumers against mistreatment by debt 
collectors. Debt collection is consist-
ently one of the top complaints made 
to the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, and the pandemic has further 
exposed weaknesses in current con-
sumer protection laws. 
In March, the Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Financial Insti-
tutions, which I chair, held a hearing 
on protecting consumers during the 
pandemic. We heard expert witnesses 
discuss how many debt collectors have 
seen record profits in the pandemic, de-
spite many families and individuals 
continuing to struggle. 
H.R. 2547 is comprehensive legisla-
tion to update consumer protections in 
debt collection across many different 
issues. For example, the bill codifies 
and expands protections for small and 
minority-owned businesses and pro-
hibits debt collectors from threatening 
a servicemember with reduction in 
rank or other military disciplinary ac-
tions. Additionally, it protects private 
student loan borrowers with disabil-
ities, would prohibit entities from col-
lecting medical debt or reporting it to 
a credit reporting agency without giv-
ing the consumer notice about his or 
her rights, and clarifies that entities in 
nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings are 
covered by the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act. 
This legislation is sponsored by Fi-
nancial 
Services 
Committee 
Chair-
woman MAXINE
WATERS
and incor-
porates bills from committee members, 
Representatives 
NYDIA
VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
MADELEINE
DEAN, 
RASHIDA
TLAIB, 
AYANNA PRESSLEY, EMANUEL CLEAVER, 
GREG MEEKS, and JAKE AUCHINCLOSS. 
The bill is supported by many con-
sumer and civil rights organizations, 
including Americans for Financial Re-
form, Center for Responsible Lending, 
Color of Change, Consumer Federation 
of America, National Consumer Law 
Center, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, and 
others. 
This legislation will update and im-
prove debt collection consumer protec-
tion laws, and make sure that small 
businesses, families, and individuals 
are treated fairly as we all work to 
come out of this pandemic stronger. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act. Claims of pregnancy 
discrimination have been on the rise 
for two decades and affect all indus-
tries and regions across the country. 
This bipartisan bill will strengthen 
workplace protections and promote the 
well-being of pregnant workers by cre-
ating a new right to pregnancy accom-
modation in the workplace. 
Temporary modifications at work, 
like regular breaks, a stool to sit on, or 
an exemption from heavy lifting, can 
be the difference between a healthy 
pregnancy and pregnancy complica-
tions. When pregnant workers are de-
nied reasonable workplace accommoda-
tions, they are often left to choose be-
tween their financial stability and a 
healthy pregnancy. 
Currently, only 30 States require em-
ployers to provide reasonable accom-
modations for pregnant workers, in-
cluding, thankfully, my home State of 
Colorado. But this has created a con-
fusing patchwork of local, State, and 
Federal laws, leaving many pregnant 
workers with few protections. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
enjoys support from both worker advo-
cates and business groups because it is 
good for families, it is good for busi-
ness, and it is good for the economy. 
The House passed this bill last Con-
gress in a broad, bipartisan vote of 329– 
73, and I hope more of my colleagues 
join us in passing the bill this year. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
the rule and the underlying bills. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. I want to thank the distin-
guished gentleman, my good friend 
from Colorado, for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes. 
The rule before us today provides for 
consideration of two pieces of legisla-
tion. The first bill, H.R. 1065, would 
create a stand-alone law requiring em-
ployers to provide accommodations to 
known limitations related to preg-
nancy, childbirth, or related medical 
conditions. 
Republicans 
have 
long 
supported 
antidiscrimination legislation, includ-
ing protections for pregnant workers. 
We agree pregnant workers should be 
protected and accommodated in the 
workplace. However, it is disappointing 
that the Education and Labor Demo-
crats absolutely refuse to work with 
committee Republicans to include a 
longstanding provision protecting reli-
gious organizations from being forced 
to make employment decisions that 
conflict with their faith. I really hope 
that moving forward, my colleagues 
across the aisle will actually work with 
Republicans and help protect religious 
liberty. 
The rule also makes in order H.R. 
2547, the Comprehensive Debt Collec-
tion Improvement Act, a collection of 
eight Financial Services bills that 
claim to address the debt collection 
practices and the problems thereof in 
the U.S. economy. But in reality, this 
measure is just the latest step in House 
Democrats’ socialist takeover of our 
country’s financial system. 
Under the Fair Debt Collection Prac-
tices Act, consumers are already pro-
tected from harmful debt collection 
practices. While Democrats claim H.R. 
2547 is necessary due to the economic 
effects of COVID–19, several of these 
partisan bills were introduced last Con-
gress prior to the pandemic. 
It is absolutely clear that my col-
leagues across the aisle are using the 
COVID–19 pandemic as an excuse to 
dismantle our free market system and 
force their radical, progressive agenda 
on the American people. 
Instead of actually helping con-
sumers, 
H.R. 
2547 
will 
increase 
healthcare costs and make credit more 
expensive for borrowers. In fact, under 
this legislation, the lowest income bor-
rowers may be pushed out of the sys-
tem entirely. 
Further, H.R. 2547 will make it hard-
er for small businesses, many of which 
have been devastated by this pandemic. 
It will make it harder for those small 
businesses to receive payments for 
services rendered. 
Finally, H.R. 2547 undermines the 
CFPB’s October 2020 final rule, in-
tended to modernize debt collection 
practices. This rule was the result of 
more than 7 years of research and set 
forth guidelines for both consumers 
and debt collectors on acceptable com-
munications. 
During committee consideration of 
this bill, Ranking Member MCHENRY 
offered a substitute amendment to ad-
dress bipartisan concerns with the cur-
rent financial framework. This com-
monsense proposal included provisions 
to prevent debt collection harassment 
of servicemembers, provide protection 
for cosigners in cases of death or per-
manent disability, and prohibited the 
use of Social Security numbers by con-
sumer reporting agencies. 
The majority, however, refused to 
work with Republicans. This refusal is 
just the latest in the Democrats’ dis-
turbing ‘‘my way or the highway’’ ap-
proach on issues where there is actu-
ally room for bipartisan solutions. 
House Republicans will continue to 
support policies that provide Ameri-
cans with access to affordable credit, 
while ensuring that our financial sys-
tem remains safe and sound. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to op-
pose this rule. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I include in the RECORD a letter dated 
May 10, 2021, from about 85 different 
public interest and financial organiza-
tions supporting H.R. 2547.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The 85 undersigned public in-
terest, legal services, consumer, labor, and 
civil rights organizations write in support of 
HR 2547 and urge you to support this legisla-
tion when it comes up for a vote on May 
13th. 
Prior to the pandemic, the Urban Institute 
reported that more than 68 million adults in 
the U.S. had one or more debts in collection 
on their credit report, and consumer debt 
has continued to grow during the pandemic, 
reaching $14.56 trillion at the end of 2020. 
Debt in collection can wreak havoc on con-
sumers, subjecting them to harassing debt 
collection calls and potential lawsuits. De-
spite the enactment of the federal Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act (‘‘FDCPA’’) in 1977, 
debt collection remains a frequent source of 
complaints to the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, 
and other state and federal agencies. 
Data from the Urban Institute also show 
racial disparities in debt collection, with 39 
percent of residents in communities of color 
with debt in collection compared to 24 per-
cent of residents in white communities. 
These statistics highlight the fact that con-
sumer protections for consumers with al-
leged debts in collection are also a racial jus-
tice issue. 
Additionally, other groups may be particu-
larly vulnerable to abusive debt collection 
practices including servicemembers, older 
consumers, and consumers with limited 
English proficiency. 
To better protect vulnerable consumers, 
this bill would enact a wide variety of crit-
ical reforms, including: 
Prohibiting the use of confessions of judg-
ment as an unfair credit practice that elimi-
nate notice and the right to be heard; 
Prohibiting 
certain 
abusive 
collection 
practices directed at servicemembers, in-
cluding threats to reduce rank or revoke se-
curity clearance; 
Requiring discharge of private student 
loans due to total and permanent disability; 
Prohibiting collection of medical debt for 
the first two years and credit reporting of 
debt arising from any medically necessary 
procedures; 
Requiring debt collectors to obtain consent 
before using electronic communications and 
provide written validation notices; 
Amending the FDCPA to expand and clar-
ify coverage, including extending coverage 
for all federal, state, and local debts col-
lected by debt collectors; 
Adjusting 
statutory 
damages 
in 
the 
FDCPA for inflation and indexing them to 
index for inflation in the future; and 
Clarifying FDCPA coverage for non-judi-
cial foreclosures. 
Enactment of H.R. 2547 will protect vulner-
able consumers from abusive debt collection 
practices, and we thank the House of Rep-
resentatives for considering legislation to 
address these important issues. 
Please feel free to contact April Kuehnhoff 
at the National Consumer Law Center, re-
garding this legislation.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. I appreciate my 
friend from Pennsylvania’s comments, 
but, apparently, consumer protection 
is not high on the list of priorities for 
the other side of the aisle. 
I would just say, this particular piece 
of legislation, H.R. 2547, has many good 
aspects, a number of which are bipar-
tisan in nature: 
It codifies the protections that cur-
rently exist under the FTC regulation 
for consumer loans prohibiting the use 
of confessions of judgment that waive 
due process protections, and extends 
those protections to commercial loans 
to protect small and minority-owned 
businesses. 
It prohibits debt collectors from 
threatening a servicemember with re-
duction in their rank and revoking 
their security clearance or prosecuting 
them under the Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Justice, and requires a GAO study 
on the impact of debt collection on 
servicemembers. 
It requires discharge of private stu-
dent loans for both the borrower and 
cosigner in the case of permanent dis-
ability of the borrower, extending pro-
tections that currently exist for Fed-
eral student loans. So it assists people 
with serious disabilities. 
It requires private lenders who are 
notified the Federal Government has 
discharged the Federal student loans of 
a borrower to discharge the private 
student loans of that same borrower. 
It bars entities from collecting med-
ical debt or reporting it to a consumer 
reporting agency without giving the 
consumer a notice about their rights. 
These are so simple, and you would 
expect that there would be universal 
acceptance of this, but apparently not. 
It provides a minimum 1-year delay 
from adverse information reported and 
a 2-year delay before collection at-
tempts are made on these medical 
bills. 
b 1430 
We heard last night in committee 
even Dr. BURGESS talking about the 
normal practices of medical profes-
sionals allowing people to have time to 
pay their bills, especially when we are 
in the middle of a pandemic or as we 
are coming out of a pandemic. 
It bans the reporting of medical debts 
arising from medically necessary pro-
cedures. 
This 
was 
something 
that 
Ralph Hall, a Republican, championed 
for years. 
It prohibits a debt collector from 
contacting a consumer by email or text 
message without a consumer’s consent 
to be contacted electronically. 
It requires the CFPB to analyze and 
annually report on the impact of elec-
tronic communications utilized by debt 
collectors. 
The provisions of this bill are simple, 
consumer-oriented efforts to provide 
information to the consumer debtor 
and to take into consideration that we 
are in a pandemic and medical bills 
have piled up for so many people. 
This is a very simple bill. It has bi-
partisan provisions in it. It should be 
passed, as should the rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. The Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act, I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 1065. 
There is language that I find many 
Democrats use in a lot of Democrats’ 
bills. It is called pregnancy rights. 
Pregnancy rights means abortion to 
them, and I really don’t understand 
that because that is not pregnancy. 
Abortion is killing a baby in the womb. 
That is not pregnancy rights. That is 
one issue we have there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2229 
May 12, 2021 
Democrats are once again using iden-
tity politics—this identity is a preg-
nant 
woman—to 
overregulate 
busi-
nesses. Rather than giving mothers 
greater access to paid family leave or 
making healthcare affordable, Demo-
crats want to double down on a govern-
ment mandate that punishes businesses 
and religious organizations and pro-
vides more access to abortion. That is 
killing the baby in the womb. That is 
not pregnancy rights. 
Passing this bill means a small busi-
ness or religious organization could be 
forced to provide paid time off to an 
employee to have an abortion even if 
that violates the religious beliefs of 
the organization. On top of that, these 
groups can be sued for damages for not 
taking every step to accommodate 
pregnant workers. That means church-
es and small businesses, the backbone 
of America, will be tied up in court for 
years seeking to comply with a one- 
size-fits-all government agenda from 
Washington. 
The solution to this problem is to re-
open America, reduce government reg-
ulations on small businesses, and keep 
Trump tax cuts that allow companies 
to keep more of their money to pass on 
to employees. 
I cannot support a bill that allows 
more abortion. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, as 
to H.R. 1065, there are at least 20, if not 
more, Republican cosponsors of that 
piece of legislation. I want the RECORD 
to reflect that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS), a member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, debt collec-
tors 
often 
operate with impunity, 
threatening 
servicepeople, 
denying 
small business owners due process, and 
harassing customers and homeowners 
with repeated calls, texts, and emails. 
Harassment by debt collectors nega-
tively affects students’ career deci-
sions, small business growth, home-
ownership, and families’ financial sta-
bility. It hurts the economy and ampli-
fies racial, gender, and socioeconomic 
inequities across the Nation. 
For example, rates of student loan 
distress are especially concentrated 
among 
low-income 
borrowers, 
bor-
rowers in rural areas, and borrowers of 
color. Debt collectors incessantly con-
tacting 
borrowers 
without 
consent 
adds another layer of loan distress, 
particularly during this pandemic. 
This is why I introduced an amend-
ment to this bill that requires a GAO 
investigation of communications by 
debt collectors, including specific rec-
ommendations for Congress to reduce 
the harassment and abuse of individ-
uals with debt. 
The Comprehensive Debt Collection 
Improvement Act is critical to pro-
tecting 
students, 
servicemembers, 
small business owners, and consumers 
with debt from predatory practices. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
entire legislation. It is important for 
the dignity of the average borrower in 
this country. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, you wouldn’t know it 
from the Democrats’ floor schedule, 
but Sunday marked the beginning of 
National Police Week. 
In 1962, President John F. Kennedy 
signed a proclamation designating May 
15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day, and 
the week in which that date falls as 
Police Week. 
Throughout this week, our Nation 
honors and pays tribute to law enforce-
ment officers who made the ultimate 
sacrifice to keep our country and our 
communities safe. 
When 
Republicans 
controlled 
the 
House, we marked this week by moving 
legislation to support our police offi-
cers and help them keep our commu-
nities safe. In stark contrast, this lib-
eral, progressive majority is not mov-
ing a single bill to support law enforce-
ment during this year’s Police Week. 
Instead, Democrats are choosing to 
ignore Police Week, even though 2020 
was the deadliest year on record for po-
lice officers in 50 years; even though, 
barely 1 month ago, Capitol Police Of-
ficer Billy Evans, a father of two, was 
killed defending this very building in 
which we stand; and even though more 
police officers have been shot and 
killed in the first 41⁄2 months of 2021 
than in all of 2020 and 2019. 
I guess that is not surprising coming 
from the party that has openly at-
tacked our law enforcement officers 
and called for defunding, dismantling, 
and abolishing the police. 
Don’t believe me? Just take their 
word for it. 
Congresswoman 
RASHIDA
TLAIB 
tweeted: ‘‘Policing in our country is in-
herently and intentionally racist.’’ The 
Congresswoman then went on and said: 
‘‘No more policing, incarceration, and 
militarization.’’ 
Congresswoman CORI BUSH called St. 
Louis’ decision to eliminate $4 million 
from the city’s police budget a ‘‘his-
toric’’ move that ‘‘marks a new future 
for our city.’’ 
Then there is Chairwoman MAXINE 
WATERS, chairwoman of the Financial 
Services Committee, who tweeted, and 
I read the tweet verbatim: ‘‘Police re-
form is not enough. Getting rid of se-
rial, racist, ignorant, and stupid cops 
must be a top priority. Let’s call them 
out.’’ 
Not only is this disrespectful to the 
men and women who put their lives on 
the line every day to protect our com-
munities, but it is actually dangerous. 
The stats speak for themselves. In 
Democrat-run cities that defunded the 
police, they have seen increases in 
crime. Let’s look at some of the num-
bers. 
Austin, Texas: They cut funding for 
police by $150 million. In return, they 
saw a 50 percent spike in homicides. 
Los Angeles: L.A. defunded the police 
by $175 million. They, too, experienced 
an increase in crime, an 11.6 percent 
rise in homicides. 
Then, there is New York City. New 
York City cut police funding by $1 bil-
lion, that is billion with a B. In return, 
New York City saw a 97 percent rise in 
shootings and a 45 percent increase in 
homicides. Let me repeat that for you 
because the stats are so alarming: a 97 
percent increase in shootings and a 45 
percent increase in homicides. 
Mr. Speaker, House Republicans sup-
port law enforcement officers and want 
to help them do their jobs safely, effec-
tively, and professionally. That is why 
if we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
consider Congressman DON
BACON’s 
Back the Blue Act, Congressman JOHN 
RUTHERFORD’s Protect and Serve Act, 
and Congressmen MCCAUL, CUELLAR, 
and CHABOT’s Jaime Zapata and Victor 
Avila Federal Law Enforcement Pro-
tection Act. Let’s talk about each one 
of those bills. 
The Back the Blue Act would protect 
our police officers by making it a Fed-
eral crime to kill or assault a Federal 
law enforcement officer. 
The Protect and Serve Act would cre-
ate enhanced penalties for anyone who 
targets law enforcement officers and 
purposefully harms them. 
The Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila 
Federal Law Enforcement Protection 
Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation, 
would ensure individuals who harm or 
attempt to harm U.S. Federal officers 
or employees serving abroad can be 
brought to justice and prosecuted here 
in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. NEHLS). He is here to 
explain this amendment. He is my good 
friend and a former law enforcement 
officer. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Back the Blue Act, the 
Serve and Protect Act, and the Jaime 
Zapata and Victor Avila Federal Law 
Enforcement 
Protection 
Act. 
Mr. 
Speaker, all of these are necessary and 
commonsense protections for our brave 
law enforcement officers. 
The 
hateful 
anti-law-enforcement 
rhetoric over the past 12 months has 
led to violence and division in Demo-
crat-controlled cities across our coun-
try. We saw it in Seattle, Minneapolis, 
and Portland, city blocks burned, busi-
nesses destroyed, lives ruined. 
Our local, State, and Federal law en-
forcement officers have been subjected 
to violence like we have never seen in 
this country, ambush shootings taking 
officers’ lives, violent riots, police pre-
cincts 
burned 
to 
the 
ground—yes, 
burned to the ground.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2230 
May 12, 2021 
Now more than ever, we need to send 
a loud and clear message to would-be 
criminals targeting our brave law en-
forcement officers: If you attack or 
harm law enforcement in any way, you 
will pay. We back the blue in this coun-
try. 
To the radicals chanting to defund 
and abolish law enforcement, who are 
you going to call if an armed criminal 
breaks into your home? It is certainly 
not going to be a social worker. 
We are a nation of laws and law and 
order. Without law enforcement, our 
country would cease to exist. Keep that 
in mind when you hear anti-law-en-
forcement zealots chanting to abolish 
police. What they are really advocating 
for is abolishing the United States of 
America. 
The hatred, vitriol, and violence 
against law enforcement have to stop. 
We need to stand and support our law 
enforcement officers. That is why I 
urge my colleagues to support the 
Back the Blue Act, the Serve and Pro-
tect Act, and the Jaime Zapata and 
Victor Avila Federal Law Enforcement 
Protection Act. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I want to remind my friends on 
the Republican side of the aisle that we 
passed a bill about 2 months ago called 
the American Rescue Plan. Not one Re-
publican voted for that. That had 
money to support law enforcement and 
local 
governments 
and 
cities 
and 
States that saw their tax revenues fall 
off a cliff. 
Mr. Speaker, when my friend, Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER, says, oh, a billion dol-
lars was cut from the funding here, or 
$150 million cut from there, he forgot 
to talk about the fact that tax reve-
nues across the country for local gov-
ernments and State governments were 
cut to the bone because of the pan-
demic. 
If my friends really wanted to put 
their money where their mouths are, 
then they would have supported the 
American Rescue Plan because it pro-
vided $350 billion to State and local 
governments so that they could in-
crease funding to the police, to law en-
forcement, to social services, to a 
whole variety of agencies and needs. 
But, apparently, they chose not to. In-
stead, they choose to bring claims that 
Democrats want to defund the police, 
which couldn’t be further from the 
truth. 
We put our money where our mouths 
are, and we said we support law en-
forcement. We support local govern-
ment employees. We support State gov-
ernment employees. We provided in the 
American Rescue Plan, which not a 
single Republican voted for, hazard pay 
because it has been so difficult for law 
enforcement and for so many others to 
conduct their services, to be out in the 
community during this particular pan-
demic. 
Mr. Speaker, I just would suggest to 
my friends, next time they get an op-
portunity to actually provide funding 
to law enforcement, they vote for it 
and not just say they are supportive of 
it. Let’s put their moneys where their 
mouths are. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. LOIS 
FRANKEL). 
b 1445 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding to me. 
Mr. Speaker, give me a break. Since 
when is having babies a liberal activ-
ity? 
In fact, I believe that police women 
have babies, too. And let me tell you 
about a couple of other women. 
Erica was working at a warehouse 
lifting heavy boxes. She had been 
working there for years. And when she 
was denied her request to pick up light-
er boxes, she lost her pregnancy. 
Hannah gave 5 years of her life to a 
healthcare company, was consistently 
promoted; but when she disclosed her 
pregnancy to her employer, she was 
fired. 
And Sara, who spent 7 years building 
a tech startup from the ground up and 
truly loved her job and had been prom-
ised a promotion when she came back 
from maternity leave, had it revoked. 
These are all true stories of women 
who have faced the real-world con-
sequence 
of 
discrimination 
against 
pregnant workers in America. So right 
now, if a woman becomes pregnant, she 
can be denied, for example, an extra 
bathroom break, a place to sit, a light-
er lifting, or fired for asking for simple 
accommodations 
or 
even 
just 
dis-
closing that she is pregnant. 
This leaves many women having to 
choose between the health of their 
pregnancy and putting foods on their 
family’s table. We are putting women 
in danger every single day while we 
hold off on this action. They are real- 
world implications for women like 
Erica and Sara and Hannah, especially 
in light of how women have really suf-
fered the brunt of the job loss during 
the pandemic and as we see a rise in 
maternal mortality rates for women of 
color. 
Mr. Speaker, so these stories are not 
unique. Pregnancy should not prevent 
a woman from putting food on the 
table, for paying her bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to 
pass this good and needed bill, Preg-
nant Workers Fairness Act. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my good friend from 
Colorado was talking about money in 
the American Rescue Plan and money 
going to States and how that is being 
used. Let’s be clear about something. 
California was actually running a 
surplus in their budget, yet that didn’t 
stop them from taking the money from 
the American Rescue Plan and giving 
that not to the police, but to illegal 
immigrants. 
And there is this myth out there that 
Democrats really don’t want to defund 
the police. I would say that it is not a 
myth. They actually do want to defund 
and dismantle the police. But don’t 
take my words for it. We can take the 
words of my liberal colleagues, the 
Democrats. 
Representative ALEXANDRIA OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, when reacting to Mayor Bill de 
Blasio’s plan to cut one-sixth of New 
York City’s Police Department budget, 
she actually deemed that as insuffi-
cient. And I will quote my colleague: 
‘‘Defunding the police means defunding 
police. It doesn’t mean budget tricks or 
funny math.’’ 
Again, that was my colleague from 
New York, a Democrat. Her words, not 
mine. 
Representative CORI BUSH, when cele-
brating St. Louis defunding their po-
lice force, despite consistently ranking 
as one of the most dangerous cities in 
the United States, to that my col-
league 
said: 
‘‘Today’s 
decision 
to 
defund the St. Louis Metropolitan Po-
lice Department is historic. It marks a 
new future for our city.’’ 
Well, my colleague might be half cor-
rect because it was historic. It did 
usher in a new future for that city, and 
that is the fact that you have crime 
rates rising to historic levels. 
My colleague from Missouri contin-
ued and she also said: ‘‘If we remove 
that’’—meaning the funding from the 
police, if we cut police funding—‘‘and 
take that money and put it into our 
education system, put it into making 
sure our unhoused community mem-
bers are sheltered, putting it into men-
tal health resources, that is what we 
are saying because that is what is 
going to make our communities safer.’’ 
So please stop the myth that Demo-
crats actually don’t want to defund the 
police. They absolutely do. They have 
said it over and over again, and their 
policies have proven it in many cities. 
And what do the American people 
get? 
Increased crime rates. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD), my good friend and a former 
sheriff. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge defeat of 
the previous question so that we can 
immediately consider the Protect and 
Serve Act, my bipartisan bill to in-
crease penalties for individuals who de-
liberately target law enforcement offi-
cers with violence. 
Throughout my 40 years of law en-
forcement, including 12 as sheriff, I 
have seen firsthand the dangerous situ-
ations our men and women in law en-
forcement face every day. In Jackson-
ville, in fact, our memorial wall is 
filled with the names of many good po-
lice officers who laid down their lives 
in service to their community. 
This Police Week, we are honoring 
the memory of the 394 officers our Na-
tion lost last year. We pause to remem-
ber their sacrifice and pledge to sup-
port policies that keep our officers

May 12, 2021 
safe. These policies should include 
harsh penalties for violence targeted 
against our men and women in blue. 
When I first introduced the Protect 
and Serve Act in 2018, it was over-
whelmingly passed by the House 382–35. 
Police Week has always been a uni-
fying time to honor those lost, but 
now, now the majority will barely ac-
knowledge it. 
What is going on? 
I think the answer is simple. Sup-
porting our police has become unpopu-
lar in the Democratic Party. Pressure 
from online radicals, political pundits 
who have never worn a badge, never 
been on a ride-along, they are dictating 
what policies the House majority will 
support. 
To 
make 
matters 
worse, 
House 
Democrats are pushing a police reform 
bill right now that eliminates qualified 
immunity, the lifeblood of law enforce-
ment. Mr. Speaker, without qualified 
immunity, the entire profession would 
end as we know it today. 
It makes you wonder if that is their 
goal: End local law enforcement and 
replace it with a national police force 
similar to almost every socialist coun-
try in the world. 
Regardless, the growing antipolice 
rhetoric and widespread efforts to 
defund police departments are leaving 
officers increasingly at risk to attacks 
in communities less safe. 
As mentioned earlier, we are not 
even halfway through 2021 and we have 
already seen more police officers shot 
this year than all of last year. Mean-
while, as mentioned earlier, American 
cities are experiencing a spike in vio-
lent crime. The U.S. surpassed 20,000 
murders last year for the first time 
since 1995. And just this year, shootings 
in Chicago, up 43 percent; New York 
City, Los Angeles, up 36 percent; Wash-
ington, D.C., homicide up 63 percent. 
Mr. Speaker, it turns out if you de-
moralize, defund, and delegitimize the 
police, crime goes up. I know many of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle do support law enforcement. I 
know that. In fact, I know that a par-
ticular few even have backgrounds in 
law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, so this is what I would 
like to impart to my Democrat col-
leagues: Here is your chance to say 
during Police Week that you support 
our law enforcement officers. Vote for 
my bill, the Protect and Serve Act, 
just like you did in 2018, and show your 
constituent police officers that you 
have their backs. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
two Statements of Administration Pol-
icy. One on H.R. 2547, and the other one 
on H.R. 1065, both in support of the 
bills that are under consideration. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 2547—COMPREHENSIVE
DEBT
COLLECTION 
IMPROVEMENT ACT—REP. WATERS, D–CA, AND 
SEVEN COSPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of H.R. 2547, the Comprehensive Debt 
Collection Improvement Act. This legisla-
tion would expand necessary safeguards to 
ensure working families and small busi-
nesses are protected from predatory debt col-
lection practices. 
As our Nation works to recover from the 
worst economic and public health crises of 
our lifetimes, many families and small busi-
nesses are dealing with outstanding debts. In 
addition to providing robust relief, the gov-
ernment must also protect Americans from 
abusive and predatory practices. 
H.R. 2547 would extend existing consumer 
protections against predatory lending ar-
rangements to small businesses, prohibit 
debt collectors from threatening service 
members with a reduction in rank, prosecu-
tion or loss of security clearance, and re-
strict contact to consumers by email or text 
messages. The legislation would require dis-
charge of private student loans for both the 
borrower and cosigners in the case of perma-
nent disability for the borrower, establishing 
greater parity in protections for private and 
Federal student loan borrowers. The bill also 
clarifies protections for consumers in the 
case of non-judicial foreclosure proceedings. 
The Administration applauds these steps 
to strengthen consumer protections for hard-
working Americans and their families, and 
we look forward to working with the Con-
gress further on the details of this legisla-
tion. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 1065—PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT— 
REP. NADLER, D–NY, AND 228 COSPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. Pregnant workers are 
too often unable to access simple changes to 
their working conditions that would allow 
them to keep doing their jobs and do so safe-
ly. This can create risks to their health as 
well as economic consequences. No worker 
should be forced to choose between a pay-
check and a healthy pregnancy. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would 
provide basic, long overdue protections to 
ensure that pregnant workers and job appli-
cants are not fired or otherwise discrimi-
nated against, or denied reasonable accom-
modations that allow them to work. Such 
protections promote family economic secu-
rity by helping women stay in the workforce, 
including for those, often women of color, 
who are the sole or primary breadwinners in 
their families. Approximately two million 
women have left the workforce due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, eroding more than 30 
years of progress in women’s labor force par-
ticipation, and this Administration is com-
mitted to ensuring that women can both 
care for and support themselves and their 
families. 
H.R. 1065 is a bipartisan bill that requires 
certain employers to make reasonable ac-
commodations for qualified employees and 
job applicants with known limitations re-
lated to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related 
medical condition. These accommodations 
might include simple modifications, such as 
modifying a no-food-or-drink policy, pro-
viding additional break time to use the bath-
room, or helping avoid the lifting of heavy 
objects, depending on the circumstances. The 
bill would require employers to provide rea-
sonable accommodations for qualified preg-
nant workers unless doing so would pose an 
undue hardship to the employer. It would 
also provide for an interactive process, where 
necessary, between employers and pregnant 
workers to determine appropriate and effec-
tive reasonable accommodations, and would 
protect pregnant workers from being denied 
employment opportunities, or from retalia-
tion or interference, because they request or 
use an accommodation. 
The Administration encourages the House 
to pass this bipartisan, commonsense legisla-
tion and looks forward to working with the 
Congress to protect pregnant workers across 
the country. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate my friends on the other side 
of the aisle trying to find a subject to 
talk about, since apparently they don’t 
really have too many objections to ei-
ther of the bills that are being dis-
cussed in the rule today. 
Obviously, it doesn’t seem like there 
is much conversation about H.R. 1065, 
the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
And there isn’t much discussion about 
the Comprehensive Debt Collection Im-
provement Act. Because those things 
are commonsense. They should be 
passed by this House. We thank so 
many Republicans for being cosponsors 
of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier in my 
opening remarks, a number of the pro-
visions in the Comprehensive Debt Col-
lection Improvement Act are really bi-
partisan, including the one Mr. Hall 
used to champion when he was a Mem-
ber here in the Congress. 
So you want to go off and talk about 
something else. I wonder where the 
outrage for brutality against our police 
was when a rightwing mob stormed 
this Capitol. And the only one of the 
people that really is speaking of the 
truth today in the Republican Caucus— 
Ms. 
CHENEY
from 
Wyoming—was 
ousted from her leadership position be-
cause she talked about the truth and 
the fact there was a mob, and our po-
lice were beaten by a rightwing mob. 
Mr. Speaker, so I would just say to 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle: Take a look in the mirror, and 
let’s support our police across the 
board. Because I certainly support the 
law enforcement in Colorado. I support 
our Capitol Police, our FBI—particu-
larly, the FBI. 
President Trump would always un-
dercut the FBI. 
So I would suggest to my friends: 
Take a look in the mirror. Let’s all 
support our law enforcement because 
they are important members of our 
community. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Col-
orado is asking why we are talking 
about the police. Well, the Democrats 
have been doing a lot of talking about 
police 
themselves—lots 
of 
talking 
about police. 
Representative ILHAN OMAR, in talk-
ing about the Minneapolis Police De-
partment following the death of George 
Floyd, said: ‘‘You can’t really reform a 
department that is rotten to the root.’’ 
So, again, we are talking about po-
lice because police are heroes. We have 
always stood with the police, as Repub-
licans. I wish my Democrat colleagues 
could say the same. But they have said 
repeatedly throughout the summer, in 
the past, atrocious things about the po-
lice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2232 
May 12, 2021 
Chairwoman MAXINE WATERS, in re-
sponse 
to 
the 
death 
of 
Rayshard 
Brooks, who tried to shoot officers 
with their own tasers during an at-
tempted DUI arrest, said: ‘‘Police re-
form is not enough. Getting rid of se-
rial racist, ignorant, and stupid cops 
must be a top priority. Let’s call them 
out. Police protective unions, you have 
got to go, too.’’ 
The attacks go on and on, on our law 
enforcement. After the death of Daunte 
Wright, following a physical struggle 
where an officer fired their service 
weapon instead of the intended taser, 
Representative RASHIDA
TLAIB
said: 
‘‘Policing in our country is inherently 
and intentionally racist.’’ 
b 1500 
Representative TLAIB has also said: 
‘‘No more policing, incarceration, and 
militarization. It can’t be reformed.’’ 
Again, this is what Democrats say 
about police. 
And I know my colleague from Colo-
rado said he supports police, but in re-
sponse to riots across the country sur-
rounding the death of George Floyd, 
my good friend from Colorado said: 
‘‘Supporting 
Representative 
PRESSLEY’s resolution to condemn all 
acts 
of 
police 
brutality, 
racial 
profiling, and excessive use of force is 
the first step, but an important step, in 
affecting change and working to end 
these injustices.’’ 
That sounds very benign, and under-
standably so. But if you look at the 
support for what the resolution actu-
ally said, let’s read what the resolution 
said. 
‘‘The system of policing in America 
and its systemic targeting of and use of 
deadly and brutal force against people 
of color, particularly Black people, 
stems from the long legacy of slavery, 
lynching, Jim Crow laws, and the war 
on drugs in the United States.’’ 
So, in essence, supporting that reso-
lution is really linking modern police 
to the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow. 
It is absolutely unacceptable. 
Again, it was a Democrat, it was JFK 
in 1962, who declared this week Police 
Week. I just wish the current Demo-
cratic Party could stand with the Re-
publicans and honor police, especially 
memorialize police who have died de-
fending our communities and our coun-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON), 
my good friend the former general. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
urge defeat of the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider my 
bill to ensure that those who risk their 
lives to protect all of us are afforded 
greater protections as well. 
I introduced the Back the Blue Act of 
2021 with Senator CORNYN in the Sen-
ate and my two original cosponsors in 
the House, Representatives STIVERS 
and JOHNSON, during Police Week be-
cause this bill is needed now more than 
ever. 
There have been more officers shot 
and killed in the last 41⁄2 months of 2021 
than all of 2020 and all of 2019. In 41⁄2 
months, we have had more fatalities, 
more murders of policemen than in the 
whole year of 2020 and the whole year 
of 2019. It is clear that we need to en-
force greater protections for those who 
protect us, and that is why my col-
leagues and I introduced the Back the 
Blue Act. 
The numbers are alarming. In 2018, 83 
police officers were shot and 26 were 
killed. In 2019, 86 were shot and 18 were 
killed. And 2020, 89 were shot and 18 
killed. This year, in 2021, as of April 
30th, there have been 91 officers shot so 
far, and 19 of them killed by gunfire. 
Our police are being targeted. We 
need to defend our law enforcement 
and public safety officers, and our bill 
does just that. 
Specifically, the Back the Blue Act 
creates new criminal provisions to Fed-
eral law enforcement officers; U.S. 
judges; and federally funded public 
safety officers, such as firefighters, 
chaplains, and members of a rescue 
squad or ambulance crew. 
The Back the Blue Act creates a new 
Federal crime for killing, attempting 
to kill, or conspiring to kill a Federal 
judge, Federal law enforcement officer 
or a federally funded public safety offi-
cer. The offender would be subject to 
the death penalty and a mandatory 
minimum sentence of 30 years if death 
results. The offender would otherwise 
face a minimum sentence of 10 years. 
The bill creates a new Federal crime 
for assaulting a federally funded law 
enforcement officer with escalating 
penalties, including mandatory mini-
mums based on the extent of any in-
jury and the use of a dangerous weap-
on. However, no prosecution can be 
commenced absent certification by the 
Attorney General that prosecution is 
appropriate. 
Now, I want to respond to my friend, 
who I respect, from Colorado. I con-
demned the behavior and the riot that 
occurred on January 6. Over one hun-
dred of our policemen were injured. 
This bill provides extra protections for 
Capitol Hill law enforcement. Those 
who injured our Capitol Police on Jan-
uary 6 would be under greater punish-
ment or penalties, if convicted. 
Our bill also creates a new Federal 
crime for interstate flight from justice 
to avoid prosecution for killing, at-
tempting to kill or conspiring to kill a 
Federal judge, Federal law enforce-
ment officer or federally funded public 
safety officer. The offender would be 
subject to a mandatory minimum sen-
tence of 10 years for this offense. 
Lastly, the Back the Blue Act cre-
ates a specific aggravating factor for 
the Federal death penalty prosecu-
tions. It expands self-defense and Sec-
ond Amendment rights for law enforce-
ment officers. It opens up grant fund-
ing to strengthen relationships be-
tween police and their communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our law 
enforcement personally. I was a victim 
of crime twice, and both times I was 
deployed when I was assigned to the 
Air Force. My house was robbed once 
when I was a captain deployed to Bah-
rain. Another time, someone assumed a 
false identity when I was a lieutenant 
colonel during the invasion of Iraq 
when I was flying combat operations. 
Thankfully, one of the times the police 
captured one of the perpetrators and 
arrested him and he was charged for a 
crime. 
I deployed to go to the battle. Every 
day our police walk out their front 
door, after kissing their spouse good- 
bye, wondering if they are going to en-
counter a violent criminal. We cannot 
thank our police officers enough. 
During Police Week, I urge my col-
leagues to support our first responders 
by immediately considering and sup-
porting the Back the Blue Act. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my friend 
from 
Nebraska 
for 
condemning—fi-
nally, somebody condemning the riot 
and the attack that occurred against 
all of us and against our police, the 
Capitol Police, on January 6. I would 
also like to see more members of the 
Republican Party stand up and do ex-
actly that same thing. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to see 
them do what Ms. CHENEY did, and con-
demn the ex-President, Donald Trump, 
for his role in inciting that whole mob 
action on January 6, and then we could 
start getting things back together. 
Instead, my friend from Pennsyl-
vania, reading a resolution that con-
demns racist policing that may have 
existed for a very long time, and I can’t 
believe that he supports policing that 
is delivered in some kind of racist fash-
ion. We have had too many people 
killed across this country. I know that 
is not what he meant. 
So I just would urge us to focus on 
the bills that are at hand, which is the 
Comprehensive Debt Collection Im-
provement Act and the Pregnant Work-
ers Fairness Act, because those are im-
portant 
pieces 
of 
legislation 
that 
should be considered immediately by 
this House. And when we pass this rule, 
they will be considered. 
So I oppose the gentleman’s sugges-
tions that we move to a different pre-
vious 
question. 
I 
appreciate 
Mr. 
BACON’s 
comments 
about 
his 
bill. 
There are provisions in there that are 
really outstanding, but we are here to 
deal with debt collections and we are 
here to deal with pregnant workers’ 
fairness. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I would ask how much time each 
side has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania has 23⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Colorado has 101⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is relevant, these 
three police bills, because, as I said

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2233 
May 12, 2021 
when I opened, if we defeat this pre-
vious question, I will bring forth the 
amendment personally to bring up 
these three bills that actually honor 
our police officers. 
Again, it is a historical norm in this 
body, in this Chamber, that during Po-
lice Week we focus on bills to help po-
lice officers. That is why this is rel-
evant today. And the fact that my 
Democrat colleagues refuse to talk 
about the police raises a lot of ques-
tions. We need to help the police. 
Let me just give you one example of 
the heroic acts of the police. After a 
suicidal man drove off a bridge into an 
ocean, San Diego Police Department 
K–9 officer, Jonathan Wiese, sprung 
into action, scaling down the side of a 
cliff to rescue twin 2-year-old sisters 
who were caught inside the vehicle. 
When asked about this decision to 
throw himself over a cliff, Officer 
Wiese explained: ‘‘I didn’t do this job to 
be liked every day. I didn’t do it to be-
come rich. I did it because I wanted to 
be out there making a difference and 
helping people.’’ 
That is the mentality of the men and 
women who are in our law enforce-
ment. That is why this week they de-
serve our attention, and that is why 
my colleagues should be afforded the 
right to bring up their three bills 
through an amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, while the rest of the 
Nation 
recognizes 
National 
Police 
Week and shows gratitude for the men 
and women keeping our communities 
safe, House Democrats are prioritizing 
two pieces of legislation that do abso-
lutely nothing, nothing to help law en-
forcement officers. 
Instead, they are jamming through a 
socialist takeover of our country’s fi-
nancial system that will actually hurt 
consumers and our Nation’s small busi-
nesses. That is why I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question, and I urge ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, during this week, 
applaud our law enforcement and our 
first responders, but particularly law 
enforcement right now for their valor, 
for their protection of our commu-
nities. I appreciate the gentleman for 
bringing up that subject at this time. 
But we are here on a rule dealing 
with the Comprehensive Debt Collec-
tion Improvement Act and Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act. The treatment 
of consumers in the collection of debts 
and businesses and military personnel 
is a very important subject, especially 
during this time of COVID when so 
many families are struggling. 
We have thousands and thousands of 
people who were laid off. In fact, where 
millions of people are still out of work 
a year and a half after COVID started. 
And, as a consequence, a lot of folks 
need assistance and need help, and they 
don’t need to be hounded in improper 
ways as they go through this struggle. 
So the Comprehensive Debt Collec-
tion Improvement Act is very impor-
tant for the financial health of our con-
sumers and people across the country. 
The provisions in the bill are bipar-
tisan ideas to protect consumers from 
abusive debt collection practices. They 
also ensure pregnant women can re-
ceive 
reasonable 
workplace 
accom-
modations to ensure that they can stay 
in the workforce. 
According to the CFPB 2021 Annual 
Report, more than one in four Ameri-
cans have a third-party debt collection 
item attached to their credit report. 
And, last year, the CFPB received 
82,700 consumer complaints about debt 
collection. It is time for Congress to 
act. 
And based on the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania’s argument, which has 
nothing to do with that particular bill 
or the facts as we have seen them de-
velop 
during 
this 
pandemic, 
that 
should be an easy vote for everybody, 
whether they are Democrat or Repub-
lican. 
The Comprehensive Debt Collection 
Improvement Act provides important 
consumer protections to stop abusive 
debt collection practices, and it en-
sures that small businesses, families, 
and individuals are treated fairly. 
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act 
is necessary to support the more than 
80 percent of women who will give birth 
to a child at some point during their 
working years. These women deserve to 
have 
reasonable 
accommodations, 
which oftentimes cost businesses little 
to no money to implement. So we can 
help pregnant women stay in the work-
force. This bill passed on broad bipar-
tisan vote last Congress, and I hope it 
passes with even more support again 
this week. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the rule and the previous ques-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 380

HONORING 
CORPORAL 
KEITH 
HEACOOK OF THE DELMAR PO-
LICE DEPARTMENT 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the life and sacrifice of 
Corporal Keith Heacook, a police offi-
cer whose funeral I attended on Mon-
day. He was tragically killed in a vio-
lent assault while responding to an 
early morning domestic disturbance 
call. As a member of the Delmar Police 
Department, a police force that strad-
dles the Maryland-Delaware border, 
Corporal Heacook honorably and self-
lessly served not just my district, but 
also the constituents of southern Dela-
ware. 
Mr. Speaker, it was appropriate that 
a man who laid down his life in service 
to his community was given such a fit-
ting funeral with over 1,000 law en-
forcement officers paying their final 
respects. 
Coincidentally, this week, we honor 
the courage and sacrifice of all our men 
and women in blue nationwide—men 
and women who literally put their lives 
on the line every day so that we can 
live safely in our homes and in our 
communities. Corporal Heacook leaves 
behind a widow and a young son. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to join 
me in praying for his family during 
this challenging time and for all the 
families of all the brave men and 
women who have laid down their lives 
to protect us. 
f 
HONORING OUR HEROES— 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
who are we if we cannot honor and cel-
ebrate those who have given their ulti-
mate in the National Police Week?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2247 
May 12, 2021 
I want to say to my hometown law 
enforcement that we mourn Jason Mi-
chael Knox, Harold Lloyd Preston, 
Lemuel Bruce, and Mark C. Brown. 
We mourn Christopher Brown, and we 
mourn Johnny Ramos Sanchez. We 
mourn Juan Menchaca, we mourn Ray-
mond Scholwinski, and we mourn Er-
nest Leal. 
We thank them. They are our family 
members, our brothers and sisters. We 
honor them and express our apprecia-
tion for their laying down their lives to 
save children and to take families out 
of burning buildings. 
We acknowledge Houston law en-
forcement officers who are now memo-
rialized on the wall of honor, which I 
intend to introduce into this body’s 
RECORD. 
Then I want to acknowledge the leg-
islation that I hope my colleagues will 
sign, and that is, to honor those who 
stood tall and fought for us on January 
6. This resolution will tell us their 
story, and that is why I stand today to 
tell the story of those who have sac-
rificed for us in this week. They are 
our family. We honor them, and we 
mourn them. 
Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law En-
forcement Caucus and the Chair of the Judici-
ary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security, I know well the service 
and sacrifice of our neighbors in law enforce-
ment, both in my hometown of Houston, 
Texas and here in the Capitol. 
I would like to take this minute to honor 
those fallen heroes in the City of Houston over 
the last year, and would like to reiterate our 
support for our polices officers across the na-
tion and here at the capitol for their duty and 
sacrifice in the defense of ourselves and our 
communities. 
It is altogether fitting and proper that we do 
this. 
Among those fallen Texans are: 
Sergeant Harold Lloyd Preston of the Hous-
ton Police Department with 41 years on the 
force whose watch ended on October 20, 
2020, when he was fired upon while respond-
ing to a call for assistance involving a domes-
tic disturbance. 
Officer Jason Michael Knox of the Houston 
Police Department, whose watch ended on 
May 2, 2020, when his aircraft experienced 
operation control issues and crashed into an 
unoccupied building during a search mission. 
Investigator Lemuel Bruce of the Houston 
Fire Marshal’s Office, whose watch ended on 
October 16, 2020, due to an ambush while 
conducting surveillance as part of an ongoing 
arson investigation. 
And those officers who risked exposure to 
the COVID–19 pandemic in their tireless pur-
suit for justice and against violence, who con-
tracted the virus in the course of their duties, 
and who eventually succumbed to the deadly 
virus: 
Investigator Mark C. Brown of the Harris 
County Constable’s Office, whose watch 
ended on July 26, 2020; 
Deputy Sheriff Johnny Tunches of the Harris 
County Sheriff’s Office, whose watch ended 
November 2, 2020; 
Deputy Juan Menchaca, Jr. of the Harris 
County Sheriff’s Office, whose watch ended 
June 13, 2020; 
Sergeant Raymond Scholwinski of the Har-
ris County Sheriff’s Office, whose watch ended 
May 6, 2020; and 
Senior Officer Ernest Leal of the Houston 
Police Department, whose watch ended on 
November 27, 2020. 
The National Law Enforcement Officers Me-
morial is the Nation’s monument to law en-
forcement officers who have died in the line of 
duty. 
Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memo-
rial honors federal, state and local law en-
forcement officers who have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice for the safety and protection of 
our nation and its people. 
Carved on its walls are the names of 22,611 
officers who have been killed in the line of 
duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to 
the first known death in 1791. 
Added to the Wall this year will be the 
names of 295 police officers killed in the line 
of duty in 2020. 
2020 was one of the deadliest years for law 
enforcement officers in history. 
Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial 
Wall of Honor also are the names of 2,052 
fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, 
the most of any state, including 116 members 
of the Houston Police Department who gave 
their lives to keep their city safe. 
Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 
800,000 law enforcement personnel serving 
the people of our country, the highest amount 
ever. 
About 12 percent of them are female. 
These brave men and women risk their lives 
to keep the peace and keep us safe but they 
are too often taken by the violence they are 
working to prevent. 
Every 58 hours, a law enforcement officer is 
killed somewhere in the United States. 
There are also 58,627 assaults against our 
law officers each year, resulting in 16,667 inju-
ries. 
Mr. Speaker, on January 6, 2021, the then- 
President of the United States encouraged his 
followers to ‘‘fight like hell’’ to disrupt and de-
rail the constitutionally required Joint Meeting 
of Congress to open, count, and publicly con-
firm the vote tally of the Presidential electors 
and announce the persons who had been 
elected President and Vice President of the 
United States. 
What followed was thousands of domestic 
terrorists, insurrectionists, and rioters charging 
the Capitol Building, the bastion of American 
democracy, with metal pipes, chemical irri-
tants, and other weapons. 
In their way the officers of the United States 
Capitol Police Department, the Metropolitan 
Police Department of Washington, DC, and 
other uniformed law enforcement officers 
stood their ground in defense of American de-
mocracy. 
There is no finer example of the selfless de-
votion to duty and love of country, than these 
officers’ valiant, heroic, and courageous re-
sponse to the assault on the Capitol Building. 
At least 138 officers, 73 from the United 
States Capitol Police Department, and 65 from 
the Metropolitan Police Department of Wash-
ington DC, sustained injuries during the attack 
on the Capitol Building, several of whom re-
quired hospitalization. 
The seven hours between the urgent call for 
help from the Capitol Police to the Metropoli-
tan Police Department and the resumption of 
work by both Houses of Congress will be in-
delibly etched in the memories of every law 
enforcement officer who was on the scene, as 
it is in the minds of the Senators, Representa-
tives, congressional and support staff, and 
members of the media corps who were forced 
to seek safety behind locked doors. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the 
people of the 18th Congressional District of 
Texas in paying tribute to the 295 fallen he-
roes who will be joining the 22,611 gallant 
men and women who gave the last full meas-
ure of devotion to the communities they took 
an oath to protect and serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence 
in memory of the 295 officers whose names 
will be added to the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement offi-
cers put their lives on the line every 
day to keep our communities safe. This 
Police Week, we want to thank the 
more than 800,000 sworn law enforce-
ment officers for their service, and we 
want to thank their families. 
During Police Week, we also remem-
ber the sacrifices made by law enforce-
ment officers. Since 1786, when the first 
police death was recorded in the U.S., 
more than 22,000 officers have been 
killed in the line of duty. 
In my home State of New Mexico, 160 
police officers have died in the line of 
duty. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute and 
let our police officers know how much 
we appreciate them and their service to 
our communities, our State, and our 
Nation. We just want to celebrate this 
Police Week with them and wish them 
Godspeed and say a prayer to keep 
them out of harm’s way. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, the sa-
cred right to vote is under attack for 
Black and Hispanic people in the State 
of Texas. 
Dangerous Jim Crow 2.0 voter sup-
pression laws are rapidly advancing 
across the country and in the Lone 
Star State right now. 
During the 2020 elections, we saw 17 
million Texans go out there and risk 
their lives, especially during the pri-
mary when there was still a lot of un-
certainty about COVID to go out there 
so they could cast their ballot. Now 
only mere months later, Texas leaders 
in the State legislature are silencing 
the voices of these very voters by push-
ing some of the most restrictive voting 
measures in the entire country. This 
legislation will do everything from pro-
hibiting local officials from sending 
out mail-in ballot applications to em-
powering poll watchers to actually be 
able to harass people with cell phones 
and video. 
It is crazy, Mr. Speaker, what is 
going on. It is completely backwards, 
it is embarrassing, and for me as a 
Black American, it is embarrassing, 
because the big lie is being perpetuated 
by historic racist tropes that Black 
people are cheating and stealing at the 
polls. 
It is uncalled for, it is unnecessary, it 
is racist, and it must end. I implore 
Texas leaders to stop this nonsense and 
get back to the business of helping

GAS LINES 
(Mr. TIMMONS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because as of this morning at 9 
a.m., 78 percent of the gas stations in 
my 
district 
in 
Greenville 
and 
Spartanburg, South Carolina, are out 
of gas. My constituents are calling my 
office hundreds at a time requesting re-
lief. 
What has happened with the Colonial 
Pipeline is a cybersecurity attack. It is 
an attack likely from eastern Europe. 
A 
group 
that 
calls 
themselves 
DarkSide is seriously impacting the 
lives of my constituents. 
This Congress has waited far too long 
to address our weak cybersecurity in 
the overall U.S. economy. We must 
take steps as a country and as a Con-
gress to increase our cybersecurity to 
protect our country from future at-
tacks. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
craft legislation to make sure that 
what is going on right now in the 
Southeast does not happen again. 
f 
ENDING CHILD POVERTY 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
expanded child tax credit and in sup-
port of making it permanent. 
I was so proud to fight for the ex-
panded tax credit to be included in the 
American Rescue Plan and to have 
made so much progress on ending 
childhood poverty in my first 4 months 
in Congress. 
Across the country we will lift 5 mil-
lion kids out of poverty this year. In 
my district alone, that is 12,000 kids 
who will no longer live in poverty, and 
it is more than 44,000 families and more 
than 148,000 kids who will be helped. 
But our work isn’t done. It is unac-
ceptable that we would let the child 
tax credit expire and allow even a sin-
gle kid to fall back into poverty. We 
have the opportunity to make invest-
ments now that will impact a genera-
tion of Americans. So let’s expand the 
child tax credit permanently. Let’s in-
vest in parents and families, and let’s 
build a better future for all of our kids.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
UNIVER-
SITY 
OF 
HAWAII 
MEN’S 
VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, today it 
is with overwhelming pride that I rise 
to congratulate the 2021 NCAA Men’s 
Volleyball National Champions of the 
University of Hawaii. 
In Columbus, Ohio this past Satur-
day, the Rainbow Warriors dominated 
Brigham Young University in a three- 
set sweep showcasing to the Nation the 
qualities of a team hungry for a na-
tional championship only made pos-
sible through years of hard work, per-
severance, grit, mental fortitude, and 
sportsmanship. 
As a former Rainbow Warriors men’s 
volleyball player and proud alumnus, I 
know how much this victory means to 
the program and all of Hawaii. 
So 
congratulations 
to 
the 
head 
coach, Charlie Wade, the coaching 
staff, UH athletics programs, the play-
ers, and, Mr. Speaker, most impor-
tantly, the best collegiate volleyball 
fans, supporters, boosters, and Aunty’s 
on the planet. 
Hawaii is so proud of them. No Ka 
‘Oi, and go Bows. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, in 1962, 
President Kennedy proclaimed May 15 
as National Peace Officers Memorial 
Day and the week of May 15 as Na-
tional Police Week. Established in 1962 
by a joint resolution of this body, Na-
tional Police Week pays special rec-
ognition to law enforcement officers 
who have lost their lives in the line of 
duty for the safety and protection of 
others. 
My home State of Florida, during 
2020, lost 19 law enforcement officers, 
and we gather today to honor their 
memory and to thank them for their 
service. We thank all law enforcement 
officers across the Nation who have 
paid the ultimate sacrifice, and we re-
member those who are out there pa-
trolling our communities to keep us all 
safe. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
joining us today to give honor to whom 
honor is due. Mr. Speaker, many have 
given 
much, 
but 
these 
men 
and 
women—our law enforcement officers— 
have given all. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN), who is 
a former law enforcement officer. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today to join my colleagues to 
honor National Police Week. I became 
a police officer when I was very 
young—20 years old. Many of the calls 
I responded to still stand in sharp relief 
in my memory. 
Today, as we honor the many who 
have fallen while serving our commu-
nities, I first want to talk about a cou-
ple of friends of mine, Sergeant James 
Severin and Patrolman Tony Rizzato. 
They were my friends and colleagues 
who were killed by snipers as they were 
participating in a walk and talk pro-
gram, an exercise designed to help po-
lice better get to know the commu-
nities they serve. 
I think of my dear friend, Erwin 
Jackson, a patrolman, who just months 
before Severin and Rizzato had passed 
away, had saved my life while we were 
arresting a man wanted for murder. 
Erwin was killed in the line of duty 
while his partner attempted to disarm 
an offender with a gun. Their losses 
have left indelible marks on me. 
Now as a Representative for Arizo-
na’s First District, I have known the 
pain of losing the hardworking men 
and women serving our State. Just be-
fore I started my first term in Wash-
ington, Show Low Officer Darrin Reed 
was killed in a hostage altercation at-
tempting to save the life of a 15-year- 
old girl from her captor. 
b 1715 
His loss shook an entire Arizona 
community and is a testament to his 
service and his kindness. I remember 
talking to his family at his memorial. 
In February of last year, we lost 
White Mountain Apache Officer David 
Kellywood in the line of duty. On the 
day we laid him to rest, blue and black 
ribbons and American flags lined our 
State highways. 
The loss of too many good officers 
working on the front lines this past 
year has left unbearable empty chairs 
at kitchen tables across our States and 
families that are suffering. 
The officers I work with in Arizona’s 
First District are kind, honest men and 
women who were drawn to service for 
the sake of others. At the end of the 
day, their names are too great to count 
and the sacrifices they have made too 
many. 
As we honor this week, we also recog-
nize the changes that must be made to 
our policing system to ensure that 
those who have sworn to protect and 
serve are held to the highest standards, 
and we, as Congress, must help with 
that. 
We must rebuild broken trust be-
tween police and our communities and 
work in bipartisan ways to do so. 
That is the type of police I worked 
with, many of us have, and we want to 
see that those officers who are partici-
pating in that type of community con-
tinue to work. 
As a former officer, a member of the 
bipartisan Law Enforcement Caucus, 
and the sponsor of several bills to re-
form policing and better keep our com-
munities and our officers safe, this 
week is not one I take lightly.

We must continue to honor the good, 
honest officers who have laid down 
their lives in the line of duty. We must 
also work toward equal rights, justice, 
and treatment for all Americans in our 
criminal justice system. Those goals 
can go hand in hand if we put aside our 
differences and work together. 
Above all, today, we mourn and re-
member all those we have lost and 
hope that our words will offer comfort 
to their families. 
As we keep close in our hearts the 
loved ones of our fallen officers, we 
also think of the families across our 
Nation who have lost loved ones to 
senseless violence. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. We are able to be 
here today, Mr. Speaker, to conduct 
the people’s business because of the 
good men and women who protect us in 
the U.S. Capitol, the men and women 
who wear the uniform and the badge 
every day. 
Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to 
yield to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is appro-
priate that we stand and speak on be-
half of the law enforcement commu-
nity of our country. As the former 
chief of the Orlando Police just said, it 
is because of them that we have law 
and order. 
Democracy cannot survive without 
law and order. So, I want to thank the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS) for leading this Special Order 
hour and for so many Democrats and 
Republicans participating. She is, as so 
many Americans now know, not only 
an outstanding Member of the Congress 
but also a former chief of police for the 
city of Orlando, Florida, and, I might 
say, a serious candidate considered by 
President Biden for Vice President of 
the United States. 
She is not the only one in our Caucus 
who has worked in law enforcement or 
overseen police departments as mayor, 
but certainly one of the most experi-
enced. 
As we observe National Police Week 
this year, we do so at a time when we 
are engaged in a critical national con-
versation about justice in policing. To-
night, we want to make it clear: This 
important dialogue does not detract 
one iota from the deep and abiding re-
spect that all of us—Democrats, Repub-
licans, independents, Americans—have 
for the men and women who dedicate 
their careers in law enforcement to 
protecting their communities, their 
neighbors, their friends. 
I do not believe, I want to make it 
clear, in defunding police. That is nei-
ther my view nor my party’s platform. 
Indeed, we honor law enforcement. 
Over the years, I have been proud to 
join my Democratic colleagues as a 
strong supporter of law enforcement 
and to raise awareness of the very seri-
ous dangers that police officers face 
while doing their jobs. 
Officer Chestnut and Detective Gib-
son, in 1998, were slain, one in my of-
fice and one outside the door of my of-
fice. They were brave and good people 
who lost their lives defending the Cap-
itol of the United States. 
In my State of Maryland and the 
Fifth District, I have worked closely 
with police chiefs, sheriffs, and depart-
ments to ensure that their needs are 
being met. Together, we have worked 
to make certain that the families of 
those who fell in the line of duty re-
ceived the benefits, help, compassion, 
and appreciation they deserve. 
Every year—until it became virtual, 
and now I do it virtually—I have gone 
down to the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial. 22,611 Americans, 
law enforcement officers, have lost 
their lives keeping the peace. 
Last year, Mr. Speaker, America lost 
295 police officers in the line of duty. It 
is a dangerous duty, but it is a critical 
duty. 
Here in the Capitol, we will remem-
ber those who have given their lives to 
protect this institution, including Offi-
cer Chestnut, Detective Gibson, Officer 
Howard Liebengood, Officer William 
Evans, and, of course, Officer Brian 
Sicknick. 
The actions just laid out are ones 
that Congress, House Democrats, be-
lieve are important to protecting those 
who keep us safe every day. But I be-
lieve, Mr. Speaker, it is equally essen-
tial for the efficacy and safety of law 
enforcement 
to 
take 
positive 
and 
proactive steps to ensure account-
ability and rebuild trust in our depart-
ments. 
That is true of our institution, Mr. 
Speaker. When we hold accountable 
one of our Members, as we have done, 
it does not besmirch the rest of our 
Members. No one ought to simplify 
that one is like all. 
To do that, we must continue the im-
portant national conversations about 
justice in policing and rooting out ra-
cial bias that corrodes effective police 
work. 
The majority, Mr. Speaker, of prin-
cipled police officers are among those 
most concerned about ensuring that 
those who cannot properly and respon-
sibly carry out their work of policing 
are held accountable. That is why we 
passed the George Floyd Justice in Po-
licing Act. 
Congress has a responsibility to deal 
with this challenge not only for the 
sake of justice and public safety but 
also in order to help police depart-
ments better carry out their missions 
and to raise the respect and support 
they receive from the American public. 
Such a policy is not designed to 
defund police or to lessen the impact of 
the vital function that law enforce-
ment officers perform. 
So, as we join in observing Police 
Week this year, let us remember all 
those 22,000-plus, those 295, the brave 
men and women protecting us and the 
peacefulness of our communities. Let 
us continue to support law enforce-
ment by striving to help police officers 
and departments face this moment 
head-on and emerge stronger, safer, 
more trusted, and better equipped to 
keep all Americans safe. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is 
now my honor to yield to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. CARSON), a 
former law enforcement officer. 
Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and friend, the Rep-
resentative who we affectionately call 
Chief DEMINGS, for organizing this Spe-
cial Order hour. You don’t get many 
friends like Congresswoman DEMINGS. 
She is a true leader; she is thoughtful; 
and she is a true public servant. 
I join her, Mr. Speaker, this National 
Police Week to honor and remember 
the officers who lost their lives last 
year in the line of duty. 
I can remember, years ago, traveling 
with my colleagues from the Indiana 
State Excise Police to honor my col-
league’s dad, who passed away in a 
high-speed pursuit on State Road 231. 
He was the sheriff, Sheriff Jim Baugh 
of Putnam County, and we came out 
here years ago to honor Mr. Baugh. 
Though nothing can bring back the 
lives that have been lost or ease the 
collective grief we feel, we take com-
fort in knowing that we will never for-
get them or the sacrifices they have 
made. 
We pledge, Mr. Speaker, to keep their 
legacy alive through our efforts to im-
prove policing for every community, 
for all Americans. 
As a former law enforcement officer, 
this priority is deeply personal. I want 
to pay special tribute to all the law en-
forcement officers in my district who 
are working to keep our city safe and 
build greater trust with the neighbor-
hoods they serve. 
I also want to honor the Hoosier offi-
cers statewide who have lost their 
lives. One such officer I would like to 
recognize is Officer Breann Leath, an 
Indianapolis Metro Police Department 
officer who was shot and killed last 
April while responding to a domestic 
disturbance. 
She was 24 years old, Mr. Speaker, a 
veteran of the National Guard, the 
mother of a young son, and part of a 
family and a proud legacy of law en-
forcement. She had her whole life and a 
great career ahead of her, only to have 
it tragically cut short. 
Today and every day, Mr. Speaker, 
we honor her and those like her who 
have been killed in the line of duty. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also be remiss if 
I did not take this opportunity to rec-
ognize the countless Americans who we 
have lost to police brutality. 
In Indianapolis alone, and in commu-
nities across our country, the list 
grows longer each day. We must honor 
their memory and commit to enacting 
reforms that save lives in the future. 
Now, let’s be clear, Mr. Speaker. We 
are not advocating for these reforms in 
order to punish police or to make their 
jobs harder. We also want to improve 
their lives as well. We want to provide 
police with better training and the 
right resources. We want to help police 
build stronger and healthier relation-
ships with the communities they serve.

We also want police to be able to 
focus on keeping the peace and relieve 
them of their many other duties that 
they are expected to do even when they 
are not trained or equipped to carry 
out these additional duties. 
As a former law enforcement officer 
and as a Black man who has been the 
victim of police excess and misconduct, 
it is clear to me that these changes are 
desperately needed. 
We can improve policing and save 
lives by passing the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act. The House has 
done its work and passed it twice, last 
year and this year. Now, the Senate 
must be bold and pass it as soon as pos-
sible so President Biden can sign it 
into law. 
Thank you again to all the law en-
forcement officers who risk their lives 
to keep Americans safe, and a special 
thanks to those we have lost. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS), 
who comes from a law enforcement 
family. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman DEMINGS
for putting 
this together. We are grateful to her. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Na-
tional Police Week. I stand here today 
with my heart full of gratitude, grati-
tude for the brave police officers who 
saved our lives, who saved the lives of 
the staff who were here on January 6, 
who saved our Nation from suffering 
further harm at the hands of those who 
would see our democracy destroyed. 
It was January 6, and many of us 
stood on this floor. I was with many of 
the people here today that afternoon 
when the armed mob broke into our 
Nation’s Capitol and threatened us, 
targeted us, hunted us. 
The moment they reached that door 
right there, the one just a few rows 
back, and began to shatter the glass on 
that door, there was just a handful of 
police officers who bravely stood in 
their way. 
It was in that moment that my 
thoughts were as a mother, as a daugh-
ter, as a citizen. Thoughts of legisla-
tion and budgets and parliamentary 
rules were not on my mind. 
b 1730 
What I wanted to do that day, and 
those of us who were on the floor that 
day, we just wanted to live. But it was 
our Capitol Police officers who stood 
up, stepped up, and fought back that 
mob. They protected all of us that day. 
They put their lives on the line. One 
even made the ultimate sacrifice to 
keep us and to keep our democracy 
safe. 
It wasn’t until after those terrifying 
moments, when we reached a secure 
room, that I saw a text from my hus-
band, who is the sheriff of Rock Island 
County, where we live and have lived 
for 30-plus years. He reminded me that 
the Capitol Police were there to pro-
tect us, and to listen to them. He could 
not have been more right. 
Shortly after that day, after we re-
turned to the Chamber where our lives 
had been in jeopardy, I shared my expe-
riences. Here is what I wrote: ‘‘I feel 
sure that the Capitol Police saved 
countless lives. I don’t think that 
America yet fully comprehends just 
how close we came to seeing Members 
of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate 
kidnapped, held hostage, or perhaps 
even murdered. That mob had lethal 
intent.’’ 
But it is because of our Capitol Po-
lice, because they risked their lives, 
because Brian Sicknick gave his life, 
that I could walk through that door 
and stand here on this floor today and 
speak to you. I speak with gratitude. 
Earlier this year, I was proud to vote 
to pass a bill awarding the Capitol Po-
lice a Congressional Gold Medal. It is 
my hope that the Senate will pass this 
legislation soon. But, today, I am so 
proud to be able to stand here to recog-
nize National Police Week, a week to 
say thank you and to recognize those 
who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
in the line of duty. 
This year, 394 names were added to 
the National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial. Thank you to those 394 offi-
cers. Thank you to the nine Illinois po-
lice officers whose lives were part of 
that list. And as the wife of a sheriff, 
let me say that 394 is too many, and 9 
is too many. 
Thank you to my husband of—35 
years? 
I am sorry; I think that is right, 
Gerry, if you are watching. 
Thank you to my husband. He has 
been in law enforcement for 38 years. I 
do know that number. Thank you for 
his service to our community and his 
career in law enforcement. 
Thank you to the men and women in 
law enforcement who sacrifice and 
serve and protect others every single 
day. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, be-
cause they are willing to risk their 
lives without hesitation, my colleagues 
and I honor them today. 
To continue the tribute, it is now my 
honor to yield to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES), who is 
also from a law enforcement family. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the officers who gave the ul-
timate sacrifice and have fallen in the 
line of duty. 
My 
husband, 
Detective 
Milford 
Hayes, has been on the job for 25 years. 
I know all too well the risk officers ac-
cept when they take this role. I have 
lived the anxiety of not knowing if my 
loved one would return home from a 
shift. I have watched my husband put 
on his dress blues and attend the funer-
als of fallen officers and mourn in the 
weeks and years after that. Over the 
past year, I have borne witness to the 
difficulty caused by growing mistrust 
between police departments and the 
communities they serve. 
In addition to honoring officers this 
week, we must commit to rebuilding 
that trust and to providing them with 
the necessary funding they need to 
safely and equitably protect them-
selves and our community. 
This is not a binary choice. Yes, we 
have systemic racial and social injus-
tices that must be addressed. Yes, ac-
countability needs to be addressed. 
But on this day, in these remarks, 
during National Police Week, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in committing to 
supporting all of the good officers that 
are out there, to ensuring officers have 
clear national guidelines regarding use 
of force, to providing access to diver-
sity training, and to ensuring depart-
ments have necessary supports to serve 
communities with underlying social 
challenges. 
This will protect both police officers 
and the communities they serve from 
unnecessary violence. This will also at-
tract new officers to the profession. 
I ask that we honor fallen officers by 
committing to action. We must provide 
the necessary guidelines, training, and 
social services required to support our 
communities and to guarantee the 
safety of law enforcement. 
We must ensure that my husband and 
every officer makes it home to their 
families safely. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is 
now my honor to yield to the gentle-
woman from Nevada (Mrs. LEE). 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank Congresswoman 
DEMINGS
for her leadership and for 
leading this tribute to all of our police 
officers across this country during Na-
tional Police Week. 
I would like to take this moment to 
recognize our Nevada officers who have 
fallen. In particular, I want to honor 
two officers who we lost in this past 
year alone. 
We remember Lieutenant Erik Lloyd, 
a 30-year veteran of the Las Vegas Met-
ropolitan Police Department. 
Every day during this pandemic, our 
men and women have stepped up to 
serve in the line of duty, no matter the 
danger. We honor their commitment in 
a time of uncertainty. 
And we mourn the loss of Lieutenant 
Lloyd, who contracted COVID–19 while 
on the job. Lieutenant Lloyd was the 
definition of selfless. He went to work 
every single day to protect his commu-
nity. And on top of that, he went above 
and beyond, becoming the president of 
the Injured Police Officers Fund. In 
that role, Lloyd raised funds for the 
care of countless officers, including 
Metro Officer Shay Mikalonis, who was 
left paralyzed after being shot this 
summer during a demonstration on the 
Las Vegas Strip. 
We also take this time to recognize 
Sergeant Benjamin Michael Jenkins, a 
military veteran, firefighter, and EMT 
officer with the Nevada Highway Pa-
trol. Sergeant Jenkins was dedicated 
to reducing impaired driving and fatal 
crashes. In 2011, he was honored with 
the Department of Public Safety’s 
highest honor, the Gold Medal of Valor, 
after he came under fire during a do-
mestic-related shooting in Wells, Ne-
vada.

His life, unfortunately, was cut short 
when he was shot and killed while 
checking on a driver pulled over on a 
remote stretch of U.S. Highway 93, just 
north of Ely. 
Their service to Nevada is incom-
parable. 
To their friends, families, and fellow 
officers, I extend my deepest sym-
pathies and prayers. Nevada stands 
with you. I express my extreme grati-
tude for the safety and dedication to 
service that Lieutenant Lloyd and Ser-
geant Jenkins, along with all other of-
ficers, have brought to our commu-
nities. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
FITZPATRICK), a former Federal law en-
forcement officer. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of National 
Police Week. 
Each May, our Nation comes to-
gether to recognize the service and pro-
found commitment of our police offi-
cers, to honor those who have made the 
ultimate sacrifice, and to recommit 
ourselves to the ideals and laws of our 
Nation that these fine men and women 
in uniform are tasked to uphold. 
But the dedication and sacrifices of 
our brave officers deserves to be re-
spected and honored, not just in one 
week out of the year, but every single 
day, both in this Chamber and across 
our country. 
Time and time again, officers across 
our Nation are met with the greatest 
threats of danger, and they face them 
with the greatest displays of courage, 
honor, and dignity. 
Mr. Speaker, my great-uncle, Philip 
Fitzpatrick, was a proud patrolman 
with the NYPD. He was also a poet, 
often writing about the world he knew 
as—what he referred to—a soldier of 
peace. 
As I have taken time to reflect dur-
ing this police week, I found myself 
thinking of him and a line from one of 
his poems: ‘‘When he kisses his wife 
and children good-bye, there’s a chance 
he will see them no more.’’ 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, these 
words were true for my family and for 
so many families in our Nation. 
This month marks 74 years since my 
great-uncle Phil was shot while at-
tempting to disarm a robber at a Man-
hattan bar, a fatal injury he suc-
cumbed to days later. 
While the times have changed, the 
dangers faced by our law enforcement 
community remain present every time 
they go to work. 
Bucks County and my community is 
home to some of the finest law enforce-
ment officers in our great Nation. 
Sadly, Mr. Speaker, we have lost too 
many. 
I would like to take a moment to 
honor our valiant fallen officers: Police 
Officer James K. Armstrong; Deputy 
Sheriff Thomas A. Bateman; Ranger 
Thomas 
Booz; 
Ranger 
Stanley 
E. 
Flynn; Police Officer Brian S. Gregg; 
Police Officer Joseph E. Hanusey, III; 
Detective Christopher C. Jones; Con-
stable Henry A. Kolbe; Sheriff Abra-
ham Kulp; Police Chief Eli M. Myers; 
Police Sergeant George M. Stuckey; 
Deputy Sheriff George M. Warta, Jr.; 
and Police Officer Robert Yezzi. 
Mr. Speaker, these 13 individuals laid 
their lives on the line to protect our 
community, the community that I 
grew up in, the community that I love, 
and they paid the ultimate price. We 
will never forget them and their ex-
traordinary service to our community. 
We owe them and their families and all 
of the honorable police officers and 
public servants who have given their 
lives in the line of duty a debt of grati-
tude and appreciation, one that can 
only be paid back through our love and 
support for them here on this floor and 
across our Nation. 
Our Nation, indeed, our world, is in 
the midst of unprecedented times. Now, 
more than ever, our courageous and 
honorable law enforcement officers 
need our support. I encourage everyone 
to take a minute this week to thank a 
police officer and reflect on the sac-
rifices so many of them have made. 
To our hero law enforcement officers 
in every town, in every city, and in 
every State across America: We thank 
you, we are grateful for you, and we 
love you. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN). 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, Representative DEMINGS, 
for holding this Special Order hour in 
honor of fallen law enforcement offi-
cers. 
It is National Police Week, a time to 
recognize and honor the men and 
women who have answered the call to 
protect and serve our community. 
Their service puts them in harm’s way 
every single day, and we owe them a 
debt of gratitude for their willingness 
to sacrifice for us. 
Last November, it was my privilege 
to speak in this Chamber in honor of 
Caleb Starr, a Michigan State Police 
Trooper from my district, who was 
killed in the line of duty while respond-
ing to a call. I spoke about the commu-
nity of Mason, Michigan, where he was 
born and raised, coming together to 
support the Starr family. 
Tonight, I am proud to recognize an 
organization in my district that has 
continuously provided support to the 
loved ones of our fallen officers. 
The 100 Club of Greater Lansing was 
founded in 1984, after the death of Offi-
cer James Johnson of the East Lansing 
Police Department. Every year, Mem-
bers of the 100 Club contribute dues of 
$100 to provide immediate assistance, 
as well as long-term support, to sur-
viving families of those who have died 
in the line of duty. 
In the nearly 40 years the 100 Club 
has been doing its work, it has helped 
the family of Officer Johnson, as well 
as the families of Officer Dean White-
head of the Lansing Police Depart-
ment; Officer Julie Engelhardt of the 
Lansing Parks Police Department; Ser-
geant Paul Cole of the Ingham County 
Sheriff’s 
Office; 
Deputy 
Grant 
Whitaker of the Ingham County Sher-
iff’s Office; and so many others. 
In addition, the 100 Club keeps the 
spirit of those heroes alive by estab-
lishing a scholarship fund for qualified 
survivors, providing an annual honor 
award to officers, and funding an an-
nual scholarship for a student enrolled 
at the Mid-Michigan Police Academy 
at Lansing Community College, where 
I visited just a couple of months ago. 
During National Police Week, we 
honor fallen heroes who have given 
their lives while on duty. To them we 
owe so much. As long as we keep their 
memory alive, they remain with us. 
With these words, they will remain in 
the permanent RECORD of the people’s 
House so that their contributions can 
live on. 
I am grateful for their selfless cour-
age and for my colleagues tonight who 
have served. Thank you for taking the 
time to honor, respect, and remember 
them.

Mrs. DEMINGS. I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
SWALWELL), also from a law enforce-
ment family. 
Mr. SWALWELL. Thank you, Chief 
Demings. Law enforcement families 
know the prayer from Matthew, chap-
ter 5, verse 9, ‘‘Blessed are the peace-
makers, for they shall be called the 
children of God.’’ 
And blessed are the California police 
officers who lost their lives in 2020: 
Oscar Walter Rocha from my district 
in Alameda County, Daniel Lopez Men-
doza, III; Andy Ornelas, Efren Coronel, 
Jose Cruz Mora, Jr., Angel De La

Armer, as well as Pat Underwood of the 
Federal Protective Services. 
As a member of a law enforcement 
family, when we say good-bye to each 
other on the phone, we always say, ‘‘I 
love you,’’ but we also say, ‘‘Be safe,’’ 
because we know what our law enforce-
ment officers encounter when they go 
into a domestic violence call or make a 
police stop in an area where there have 
been robberies, gang violence, drugs. 
In Oakland, California, four officers 
were killed in a matter of minutes 
after a police stop, when I was a pros-
ecutor for the Alameda County District 
Attorney’s office. We know the risk 
they face. 
I have a family member who has been 
shot at and was told that from such a 
point blank nature he is lucky to be 
alive. 
We are grateful for the sacrifices of 
law enforcement. We also recognize 
that the best way to protect the best 
cops is to make sure that we put in 
place reforms to take care of those who

do not meet the standards that we ex-
pect from law enforcement. 
We are committed in this Chamber to 
work to pass the George Floyd Justice 
in Policing Act to make sure that we 
protect our cops on the streets and we 
protect those in the community who 
they also promise and swear an oath to 
protect. 
This police week, let me also just 
urge my colleagues across the aisle, 
who I know are sincere when they want 
to stand up for police officers, to recog-
nize that the police officers who walk 
the beat in these halls are hurting, and 
they are grieving, and what happened 
on January 6 has not just passed, and 
when they hear colleagues in this 
Chamber say, as one said today that 
January 6 looked like any other nor-
mal tourist visit to the Capitol, that 
really hurts them. That hurts their 
families. It is an insult to their service, 
and we must do better, because back-
ing the blue doesn’t just mean backing 
the blue who back you, it means back-
ing the blue who protect this Chamber 
and protect our democracy. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. WEXTON). 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today during National Police Week to 
honor the life U.S. Capitol Police Offi-
cer Howie Liebengood. Howie served as 
a Capitol police officer for 15 years and 
before that as a Senate page. He con-
tinued a 50-year family legacy of serv-
ice to the Senate, following in the foot-
steps of his father, a former Senate 
Sergeant at Arms. 
Howie died by suicide on January 9, 
after working around the clock in the 
days following the January 6 insurrec-
tion, defending our Capitol and the 
Members, staff, workers, journalists, 
and others inside of it. There is no 
doubt that Howie would still be with us 
today but for the events on and imme-
diately following January 6. 
And yet, the leaders Howie served 
under at the Capitol Police still refuse 
to acknowledge his tragic loss as a 
line-of-duty death, despite his heroic 
sacrifice on that day and in the days 
that followed. Howie’s widow, Serena, 
and his family deserve better. 
Our Capitol Police deserve better, 
too. The PTSD and trauma of January 
6 and April 2 are still prevalent for U.S. 
Capitol police officers. The reluctance 
many officers feel asking for help is 
real as well. Leadership is failing these 
officers when they refuse to validate 
the pain of that trauma and the tragic 
consequences it can lead to. 
That is why we must provide U.S. 
Capitol police officers with the re-
sources they need to take care of them-
selves and to fight the stigma not only 
for them, but for law enforcement offi-
cers around the country to know that 
it is okay to ask for help. 
According to a report from the non-
profit Blue H.E.L.P., the number of of-
ficers who died by suicide in recent 
years has outpaced those killed in the 
line of duty. 
It is incumbent on us as lawmakers 
to end the stigma around law enforce-
ment mental health and to give these 
officers the support they need in times 
of crisis. We must thank them not just 
with our words, but with our actions. 
I have been working with my col-
leagues and with the Liebengood fam-
ily to honor Howie’s legacy of service 
to our Capitol community. To Serena, 
his family, and all those who knew and 
loved Howie, I hope it brings you some 
solace to know that Howie’s life and 
sacrifice will never be forgotten by 
those of us here who he gave his life to 
protect. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Thank you so much 
for that tribute. I now yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL), the chair of the Law Enforce-
ment Caucus. We are so grateful for the 
work that he is doing. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, it is 
not 
unusual 
for 
Congresswoman 
DEMINGS to lead and bring us together. 
I want to congratulate and thank her 
for her service in the past and now. 
Mr. Speaker, during this devastating 
pandemic, our Nation’s law enforce-
ment officers have stood heroically on 
the front lines, keeping communities 
across America safe. Our police have 
risked their lives and the lives of their 
families every day they go to work. 
Many have made the ultimate sac-
rifice. 
Since the start of the pandemic, we 
have lost over 464 officers, including 298 
to COVID–19. In New Jersey, 15 officers 
have perished, including 13 to the 
virus. 
In my own district, we lost Paterson 
police officer, Frank Scorpo, who was 
only 34 years old and left behind a wife 
and two young sons. 
We lost Detective Anthony Lucanto, 
a 24-year veteran of the Paterson Po-
lice Department, who died of cancer 
tied to his heroic efforts at Ground 
Zero. Anthony leaves behind his wife 
and three children. 
Our hearts bleed for all of our fallen 
officers and their families. 
As the co-chair of the Congressional 
Law Enforcement Caucus, I was proud 
to champion legislation signed into law 
to ensure those families of officers fall-
en to COVID–19 are guaranteed public 
safety officer benefits. But more must 
be done to support families of officers 
who make the ultimate sacrifice. 
Earlier this month, we introduced 
the bipartisan Protecting America’s 
First Responders Act. Our bill will 
guarantee first responders and their 
families get their owed benefits with-
out delay or red tape. I hope it gets 
passed. 
I wish I could say support of law en-
forcement is fully bipartisan, but I 
can’t. Incredibly, when we passed the 
latest Capitol Police budget, 50 of our 
colleagues on the other side voted 
‘‘no.’’ Thank God for those who did 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
When we voted to certify the Presi-
dential election, hours after terrorists 
attacked the Capitol, 138 Members on 
the other side voted to throw out the 
election. 138. These votes are a slur on 
the Capitol Police and the officers 
across America who have given their 
lives. 
This last year has been a difficult one 
for all communities, but unbearable for 
our men and women in uniform. They 
have protected us at our lowest mo-
ment. The least we can do is protect 
the benefits they have earned and 
stand by them. 
Let us move what was started almost 
20 years ago, community policing, so 
we protect our police and we encourage 
trust in them day in and day out. God 
bless our country. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Thank you again to 
the chair of the Law Enforcement Cau-
cus. 
I now yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
our brave and selfless law enforcement 
officers who have fallen in the line of 
duty in south Texas this past year: 
Jorge 
Cabrera, 
Ismael 
Chavez, 
Edelmiro Garza, Jr. Let us not forget 
those who stood guard at our border 
and kept us safe: Carlos Mendoza, Juan 
Ollervidez, Christopher Carney, Roel 
De La Fuente, and Enrique Rositas. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to take 
a brief moment of silence to pay my re-
spects to those law enforcement offi-
cers who paid the ultimate sacrifice to 
keep our community safe. 
My community and I owe a deep 
amount of gratitude to these officers 
who sought to keep us safe. I thank 
them, and may God bless and watch 
over our law enforcement officers, 
their families, and the United States of 
America. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. I thank the gen-
tleman from Texas for that tribute to 
our law enforcement officers. I now 
yield to the gentleman from Minnesota 
(Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. I thank the gentle-
woman from Florida for yielding and 
for organizing this important Special 
Order hour. 
As a Gold Star son who lost his fa-
ther in the Vietnam War, I empathize 
with and salute the honorable men and 
women who don a uniform and risk 
their lives and too often lose their lives 
protecting our country and our com-
munities, oftentimes without the ap-
preciation or support that they need 
and that they deserve. 
So I rise today to express gratitude 
to the over 11,000 police officers who 
serve and protect the residents of my 
home State of Minnesota, an over-
whelming majority of whom are com-
passionate and principled public serv-
ants. 
I am proud of the law enforcement 
agencies 
that 
serve 
Hennepin 
and 
Carver counties in Minnesota’s Third 
District, innovative and well-led police 
departments committed to building 
cultures and communities in which ev-
eryone, and I repeat everyone, feels 
safe.

H2254 
May 12, 2021 
People like Dawanna Witt, whose re-
markable life story of perseverance 
embodies the very best of our law en-
forcement community. Ms. Witt grew 
up surrounded by alcoholism and drug 
addiction, was subject to sexual abuse, 
had her first baby at age 15, and lived 
with her newborn in a homeless shel-
ter. 
But she finished high school with 
honors, then received her bachelor’s de-
gree and then her master’s. And today 
she is known as Major Witt, a grand-
mother of two, supervisor of 500 em-
ployees at the Hennepin County Sher-
iff’s Office and a rising star in Min-
nesota law enforcement. 
Major Witt will be the first to tell 
you that we do need police reform, that 
systemic racism does exist, and that 
racial profiling is a real thing. She will 
also tell you that we need to do more 
to protect officers’ safety. 
So, today I invite my colleagues and 
our entire country to join me in cele-
brating Major Witt and the hundreds of 
thousands of law enforcement profes-
sionals just like her who have com-
mitted their entire professional lives 
to helping America become a more 
safe, equitable, just, and perfect union. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. We thank the gen-
tleman from Minnesota for that trib-
ute. I now yield to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
b 1800 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from Florida for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this week, May 9 to 
May 15, is National Police Week. I 
stand today to join with my colleagues 
in carrying forth a tradition that start-
ed 59 years ago. 
In 
1962, 
President 
Kennedy 
pro-
claimed, and Congress ratified, May 15 
as National Peace Officers Memorial 
Day, and the week in which that date 
falls is National Police Week. 
During this time, we pause to recog-
nize those law enforcement officers 
who have lost their lives in the line of 
duty for the safety and protection of 
others. 
Those of us here in Congress know 
well the bravery and dedication of law 
enforcement officers, for we saw it 
firsthand on January 6 when they pro-
tected this citadel of democracy and 
the public servants who were dis-
charging their duty. 
Some of those brave souls paid with 
their lives, such as Officer Brian 
Sicknick. We also lost Officer Howard 
Liebengood and Officer Jeffrey Smith, 
who died by suicide in the immediate 
aftermath of that tragic day. Many 
more police officers who were on duty 
that day are still hurting. 
Of course, all across our Nation, and 
in Ohio particularly, our police officers 
and 
their 
families 
have 
sacrificed 
themselves for their communities. I 
have done ride-alongs with these offi-
cers and watched them deal with the 
overdose issues and the opiate epi-
demic in Ohio. 
We watch them risk their lives. We 
pray for their families who worry every 
time they put on their boots and go to 
work. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, they show up. 
The National Law Enforcement Offi-
cers 
Memorial 
Fund 
compiles 
the 
names of those officers who have lost 
their lives in the line of duty in this 
past year and all those who have died 
in previous years but whose stories of 
sacrifice have been lost to history until 
now. This year, nearly 400 new names 
were added to this list. I stand today to 
honor all those lives that were lost, in-
cluding the following five officers from 
Ohio. 
We honor James Michael Skernivitz 
from Cleveland, Adam McMillan from 
Hamilton County, Kaia Lafay Grant 
from Springdale, Anthony Hussein Dia 
from Toledo, and, finally, Rex Faux 
from Summit County, who died in 1933 
but whose name had not previously 
been added to this list of fallen offi-
cers. 
We also honor all the men and 
women in law enforcement who show 
up for all of us every day. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his tribute. I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
No one can be a better spokeswoman 
for this issue than Mrs. DEMINGS, who 
proudly represents her district in Flor-
ida and served as the police leader in 
her hometown. 
Mr. Speaker, as we remember the po-
lice officers who have fallen in the line 
of duty, it is with great sadness that I 
must add another name to that list. 
Officer Jimmy Inn of the Stockton 
Police Department was killed yester-
day while responding to a domestic vio-
lence call. 
Just 30 years old, Officer Inn joined 
the force in 2015 and was a member of 
the Honor Guard. He was a husband 
and a father who leaves behind a 7- 
month-old son, a stepson, a step-
daughter, and a wife, who also serves 
as a Stockton police officer. 
Officer Inn is remembered as a kind-
hearted, selfless, and positive person. 
His commanding officer, Stockton Po-
lice Chief Eric Jones, said that he was 
the epitome of what a police officer 
should be. 
Officer Inn’s last act was to help a 
woman and child in grave danger. Offi-
cer Inn sacrificed his life in service to 
others, and I ask everyone to join me 
in honoring his life, his service, and his 
memory. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments, and 
we join him in grieving the death of 
the officer just yesterday. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative DEMINGS for yielding. 
Today, I am honored to pay tribute 
to law enforcement officers and their 
families. Every day, law enforcement 
officers put their lives at risk in order 
to keep us and our communities safe. 
Most of the time, they return safely 
home to their families. But that is not 
always the case, and we should never 
lose sight of that. 
In that spirit, I want to express pro-
found 
gratitude 
to 
Deputy 
Ryan 
Thompson from Kittitas County, Wash-
ington, who tragically lost his life in 
the line of duty in 2019. 
Ryan has since been recognized for 
this sacrifice on the National Law En-
forcement Officers Memorial here in 
Washington, D.C. Thank you to the Na-
tional Law Enforcement Officers Me-
morial Fund for honoring and remem-
bering Deputy Thompson’s service. 
I also express my appreciation for the 
families of law enforcement officers 
who live with an undercurrent of worry 
every day while their loved one is on 
duty. 
And a very special thank-you to our 
very own Capitol Police, who stood up 
to a violent mob in order to protect us 
from danger. Several Capitol Police of-
ficers have lost their lives. Please 
know that we mourn with their fami-
lies. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). The gentlewoman has 5 
minutes and 45 seconds remaining. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman DEMINGS
for 
hosting this Special Order hour in 
honor of our brave law enforcement of-
ficers. I am proud to serve with her as 
a member of the Congressional Law 
Enforcement Caucus co-chaired by our 
dear friend and colleague BILL PAS-
CRELL. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
commemorate Police Week and to 
honor all the brave law enforcement of-
ficers in New Jersey and across the 
country who put their lives on the line 
every single day to protect our commu-
nities. 
We especially honor the more than 
124 police officers who have died in the 
line of duty across the United States 
this year, including 64 who we lost to 
COVID–19. We will never forget their 
bravery, sacrifice, and service. 
Mr. Speaker, police officers are our 
heroes, and I am deeply grateful to all 
law enforcement—Federal, State, and 
local—for what they do day in and day 
out. They never fail to get our backs, 
and we have a responsibility to get 
theirs. 
That is why, in Congress, I am com-
mitted to fighting for all of our sworn 
officers and first responders by making 
sure they have the resources, equip-
ment, and training they need to do 
their jobs safely and effectively. 
Our police departments have been 
tested and challenged during the pan-
demic over the year, but they have 
risen to the occasion, continuing to 
help our State and our people recover. 
I was very proud to lead the New Jer-
sey delegation in requesting critical

support for PPE and staffing at the 
very start of the pandemic, and I 
fought hard for and ensured a presump-
tion for Public Safety Officers’ Bene-
fits for those on the front lines of 
COVID. 
I thank all of my colleagues for 
working across the aisle for those who 
have served and having the backs of 
our first responders every day. Most of 
all, I thank every law enforcement offi-
cer for their solemn commitment to 
protect and to serve. God bless. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his tribute. 
Mr. Speaker, as someone who served 
27 years in law enforcement, who had 
the honor of serving as the chief of po-
lice, one thing I know for sure is that 
the police are the community, and the 
community is the police. The police 
and the community are one. We are 
one. 
I do believe that when we come to-
gether, we can do anything, that we 
can have some of the safest commu-
nities that America has to offer, that 
we can truly be, in America, what we 
were created to be. 
We honor the men and women who 
put on the badge and the uniform every 
day, Mr. Speaker, and go to work not 
knowing whether they will ever make 
it back to their homes, to their fami-
lies, to their loved ones. 
I am honored to stand once again—I 
have done it for a lot of years now—to 
honor National Police Week and recog-
nize the men and women who have paid 
it all. Many have given much, but the 
men and women in law enforcement 
who have laid down their lives to keep 
us safe have given their all. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor National Police Week, and 
the brave, dedicated, and selfless heroes who 
work tireless long hours to keep the public 
safe in communities across this country. 
This is deeply personal to me, as someone 
whose own loved ones wear a badge, and as 
someone who worked for nearly 18 years as 
a 9–1–1 dispatcher for the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
So I want to take this moment to say thank 
you, not just to the men and women in uniform 
on our streets, but also to their counterparts in 
service who answer the call whenever some-
one dials 911. 
Dispatchers have a unique vantage on po-
lice work—they know how harrowing the situa-
tions police officers face are; how important 
police work is to people in their most vulner-
able moments; and how committed officers 
are to serving the public. 
After all, dispatchers are the ones who an-
swer those calls for help in the first place. 
But dispatchers also play a key role in keep-
ing our officers safe. They gather situational 
awareness, so our officers know what to ex-
pect when they approach a scene; they send 
backup when more support is needed; and 
they send medical help if the unthinkable hap-
pens and an officer is hurt. 
So as we honor those who serve, let’s also 
honor the people who keep them safe every 
step of the way. 
Public safety workers of all types are under 
new stresses right now as a result of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and the uptick in gun vi-
olence that is tragically endemic to the United 
States. 
So as we honor this valiant profession and 
acknowledge the harrowing circumstances 
they face, we must also take time to make 
sure they have the support they need, from 
PPE to mental health reources and everything 
in between. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recog-
nize National Police Week and the men and 
women who keep us safe at great personal 
sacrifice, and at great sacrifice to their own 
families. 
f 
HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PHILLIPS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, during our time tonight, my 
colleagues and I will recognize the 
great men and women of law enforce-
ment and the critical role they play in 
keeping our local communities safe. 
National Police Week is particularly 
important this year. Of course, we ob-
serve it annually, but we all know, 
over the last year, law enforcement has 
been under constant attack by the po-
litical left in this country. Everyone 
can see it with their own eyes. The left 
has demanded to defund police depart-
ments. Some Democrats, even elected 
officials, have even gone as far as to 
call for abolishing the police. 
Yet, in the face of that madness, po-
lice officers, nevertheless, continue to 
put their lives on the line every day to 
protect our communities, our families, 
and all of us. It is such a critical part 
of who we are as Americans. 
As has been noted, we have lost many 
more officers in the line of duty over 
the past year, and we mourn those 
tragic losses. Despite the sacrificial 
service and the bravery of law enforce-
ment, there are some Democrats even 
in this body, Mr. Speaker, who con-
tinue to push the false and outrageous 
narrative that police are actually 
somehow to be regarded as enemies of 
the communities they serve and that 
we don’t need them. 
Well, tonight, my Republican col-
leagues and I are here to tell you that 
they are wrong. We need police offi-
cers, and we need law and order. Noth-
ing makes this more apparent than the 
spike in violent crime and homicides 
we have seen in Democrat-led cities 
that have defunded their police depart-
ments. 
Specifically, there are a few exam-
ples here. In Austin, Texas, they have 
seen a 50 percent rise in homicides. In 
Los Angeles, they saw an 11.6 percent 
rise, and in New York City, 45 percent. 
By the way, in New York City, they 
have a 97 percent rise in shootings. 
Defunding the police is a terrible 
idea, and anyone who looks objectively 
at this issue obviously knows that. 
So, what should we do about it? We 
should support our police officers and 
those in law enforcement. We should 
encourage them to continue building 
strong relationships in all aspects of 
our communities. We should give law 
enforcement the tools and training 
they need to maintain law and order. 
Lastly, as a Nation, we must back the 
blue. We would argue it may have 
never been as important to do that as 
it is right now. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of col-
leagues who will speak to this issue, 
and I will begin by yielding to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER), 
my dear friend, who was not only a 
professional hockey player, most peo-
ple know that, but a lot of people may 
not realize he is also a retired police 
lieutenant. So, he is, obviously, quali-
fied to speak on this issue. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative JOHNSON
for holding 
this 
incredibly 
important 
Special 
Order this evening. 
For 23 years, I had the privilege of 
serving my hometown of Duluth, Min-
nesota, as a police officer. I know first-
hand the sacrifices law enforcement of-
ficers make for the safety and security 
of their communities. 
Policing is a noble profession and 
often a dangerous one. Ninety-one offi-
cers have been shot so far in 2021. 
Despite this danger, countless men 
and women still put on the uniform, 
leave their loved ones behind, and put 
their own lives on the line every day. 
During National Police Week, we cel-
ebrate and honor these heroes, but they 
deserve our respect for more than just 
1 week. They deserve it year-round and 
so do their families. 
This past year has been especially 
challenging for our law enforcement of-
ficers. There are some in the media and 
some in this very Chamber who choose 
to vilify our police officers for the ac-
tions of a few bad apples. Some have 
even called to defund the police. This 
reckless and dangerous message has 
had a chilling effect on our society. 
Low morale is causing some officers 
to retire early. New officer recruitment 
is strained, and crime is on the rise in 
many cities. 
This 
irresponsible 
rhetoric 
must 
change, and I call on all of my col-
leagues to help. 
We must all honor the noble profes-
sion of policing, which has provided 
every one of us here in this Chamber 
with safety and security. We must all 
encourage the American people to re-
spect the rule of law and those who are 
entrusted to enforce it.

May 12, 2021 
I, for one, am proud to stand here 
today, to publicly send my thanks to 
our dedicated police officers and to 
honor those who have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice. 
To all my brothers and sisters in the 
blue and brown, please know that you 
are appreciated, needed, and valued. 
God bless, and may He protect you all. 
b 1815 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
those words straight from the heart, 
and he speaks, as we said, with great 
authority on it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK), my 
neighboring State, who will speak with 
equal passion on the issue. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for hosting this very im-
portant series regarding law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today to 
honor the men and women in blue. 
They have devoted their lives to keep-
ing our communities and families 
safe—unflinching in this mission, even 
when faced with growing hostility and 
danger. These guardians stand on the 
front lines, regardless of the peril to 
themselves, not for praise or glory, but 
to protect and serve the citizens and 
uphold law and order. And no matter 
the situation, they answer the call of 
duty. 
Mr. Speaker, as I speak, Officer Tyler 
Franks of the Prairie Grove Arkansas 
Police Department is recovering, hav-
ing been shot in the line of duty just a 
few days ago. Officer Franks has under-
gone multiple surgeries. He will endure 
more, and, indeed, has a long road 
ahead. Please pray for Officer Franks. 
Let us also pay tribute to our fallen 
heroes. We honor the memory of Fay-
etteville Police Officer Stephen Carr, 
who, in December of 2019, was assas-
sinated while sitting in his patrol unit 
behind the police department because 
of his uniform. We recognize the quick 
action of Corporal Seay Floyd and Offi-
cer Natalie Eucce, who immediately 
acted and captured the assassin. 
We also remember Sebastian County 
Deputy Bill Cooper and Corporal Terry 
Wayne Johnson, both of whom made 
the ultimate sacrifice in the line of 
duty. 
Mr. Speaker, these are just a few ex-
amples of the real sacrifices and dan-
gers faced by our brave officers every 
day. I am eternally grateful for those 
who wear the badge and keep the Third 
District safe. 
This National Police Week, I thank 
every noble law enforcement officer in 
Arkansas and across our Nation for 
their dedicated service. We salute 
them. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Ar-
kansas. We do join him in those pray-
ers for Officer Franks and the others 
around the country who are recovering 
from this violence that so many law 
enforcement officers have had to en-
dure over the past year. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
next to another gentleman in our con-
ference, who speaks with great author-
ity on the issue, particularly on Police 
Week. Mr. TROY NEHLS of Texas 22 was 
the former sheriff of Fort Bend County, 
Texas, and he knows of which he 
speaks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. NEHLS). 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, as a 30- 
year law enforcement veteran, the 
rhetoric and hatred I have seen to-
wards police these last 12 months is 
disgusting. 
Rather 
than 
recognize 
the 
over 
800,000 law enforcement officers in this 
country who do their job honorably 
each and every day, the far left has 
sought to demonize and defund our law 
enforcement based off the actions of 
the few—the few who fail to uphold 
their oaths. 
Every year in our country, there are 
more than 10 million arrests. Most 
Americans never hear a word about the 
millions of arrests that happen without 
incident. 
Why is that? 
Because it doesn’t sell headlines. It 
doesn’t fit the anti-law enforcement 
narrative. 
The hateful anti-law enforcement 
rhetoric has led to violence and de-
struction in cities across our country. 
We see it in Seattle, Minneapolis, Port-
land—city blocks burned, businesses 
destroyed, and lives ruined forever. But 
we are not here today to focus on the 
anti-law enforcement zealots. 
This is National Police Week. We are 
here today to honor the 22,000 brave 
law enforcement officers who have 
given the ultimate sacrifice in the line 
of duty. 
In 2021, the names of 394 officers 
killed in the line of duty were added to 
the National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial in Washington, D.C. Fifty- 
nine of those brave men and women 
were from my home State of Texas. 
One of them, I knew. 
Fort Bend County Precinct 4 Con-
stable Deputy Caleb Rule of Needville, 
Texas, tragically lost his life in a 
friendly fire incident involving one of 
my own sheriff’s deputies on May 29, 
2020. It is a day I will never forget. 
Caleb is survived by his wife, Eden; 
and four children, Annie, Rosalan, 
Mark and Lizzie. May God bless them. 
It is stories like Caleb’s and the hun-
dreds of other brave law enforcement 
officers who sacrifice their lives in the 
line of duty every year, who remind us 
just how dangerous serving in law en-
forcement is. The focus not only this 
week but every week should be on their 
bravery, service, and sacrifice. They 
damn well deserve our respect and sup-
port today and every day. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the sheriff for his 
service and that passion. It is appro-
priate tonight, of course. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from Kansas’ big First District. 
The district, I think, has 63 counties. It 
is one of the largest in the country. He 
has got a lot of work to do. And they 
know him well because he also hap-
pened to have been the 50th Lieutenant 
Governor of the State of Kansas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for hosting this tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to com-
memorate National Police Week. 
I recognize the dedication of law en-
forcement officers on the thin blue 
line, and condemn calls to disband, dis-
mantle, defund, or abolish the police. 
No one dislikes bad police officers 
more than good police officers. Too 
often, we are quick to share the nega-
tive examples of law enforcement while 
failing to recognize excellent examples 
in our communities. 
Today, I will share a story about an 
officer in my district and one of the 
finest law enforcement officers in Kan-
sas: Michael Utz. 
Chief Utz began his career with the 
Garden City Police Department in 1984. 
Over the next 36 years, he tirelessly 
served as a detective, sergeant, lieuten-
ant, captain, and ultimately chief of 
police. 
As police chief, Chief Utz led the de-
partment through the implementation 
of a citywide strategic plan, including 
the development of the Law Enforce-
ment Explorer Program for students 
interested in pursuing law enforcement 
as a career; the Police Chaplain Pro-
gram for hurting families; the PEER 
Support Program for police officers ex-
periencing 
traumatic 
events; 
the 
Finney County Opioid Task Force; and 
the Ethnic Empowerment Network. 
Also during his tenure, Chief Utz en-
couraged authentic relationships, and 
he especially worked to build two-way 
relationships with racial and ethnic 
minorities. These relationships proved 
to be vital after the 2016 terrorist bomb 
plot targeting a Garden City apart-
ment complex. 
When the FBI reached out to Chief 
Utz about the bomb plot, he knew just 
what to do. He worked with the presi-
dent of the East African Community 
Center to convene a meeting with peo-
ple in the community to discuss the in-
cident before it even hit the news. Once 
the news broke about the foiled attack, 
Chief Utz made it his personal mission 
to work alongside impacted families 
and protect them from further danger. 
In March, Mike retired with more 
than 36 years in law enforcement, and 
Courtney Prewitt was sworn in as the 
Garden City chief of police. 
I am honored to recognize Chief Utz 
and his family for their service to our 
local communities, and to congratulate 
Courtney on his new role, and to cele-
brate good law enforcement officers 
across the First District of Kansas and 
around the country who put on a uni-
form every day and promise to protect 
and serve. 
In their honor, I cosponsored several 
pieces of pro-law enforcement legisla-
tion, 
including 
a 
resolution 
con-
demning calls to defund the police; the

Protect and Serve Act, which enhances 
penalties to anyone targeting and at-
tacking law enforcement officers; the 
David Dorn Back the Blue Act, which 
supports State and local police depart-
ments; and a resolution designating 
this week as National Police Week. 
America must stand with and stand 
for our law enforcement officers. Happy 
National Police Week. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
those important words. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to a gentleman from Utah, a 
freshman who has made a big mark 
here in the First District of Utah. He is 
also a former officer of the U.S. For-
eign Service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to make a simple point in 
support of the women and men serving 
in uniform across America. We must 
reject the myopic narrative that the 
actions of a dishonorable very few 
should dominate how we view, appre-
ciate, and honor our police force. 
Prior to Congress, I worked as a con-
sultant with professionals in many in-
dustries. I never met anyone in any 
field who wasn’t interested in improv-
ing their performance, and our police 
force is no different. However, if we 
continue to criticize and demonize our 
officers as a whole, we may find our-
selves in a position where good, honor-
able men and women, professionals like 
fallen 
Officer 
Nathan 
Lyday 
from 
Ogden, Utah, who was killed almost 
one year ago in the line of duty, are no 
longer willing to wear the badge. 
I am so grateful for our Nation’s po-
lice force. They need our backing now, 
more than ever, and it is our duty to 
support them as we learn and move for-
ward from recent tragic events. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend and I ap-
preciate his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, from Utah, we will 
move over to one of our favorite rep-
resentatives from the great State of 
Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DONALDS), a fresh-
man who also made a big mark here 
and who came from the Florida House 
of Representatives. 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to cut to the chase this evening. It is a 
story I don’t really tell much, but 
when I was 16 years old, I was held up 
at gunpoint. I was coming home from 
basketball practice, and it was dark. 
Frankly, they just came right out of a 
bodega on the corner. 
When I got home, the first thing my 
mother did—well, first, she tried to 
stop me from going back after the peo-
ple who robbed me because I was very 
upset. I was 16 and I was robbed and I 
was angry. But then she called the po-
lice, and they came promptly and they 
did everything they could to try to find 
the people who assaulted me. 
You see, in community after commu-
nity across our country, the police are 
the ones who stand in the gap between 
law-abiding citizens and those, frankly, 
who are criminalized, who were as-
saulted, where some damage is caused 
to that person. 
The police are the ones in our com-
munities. They patrol the streets. They 
try to keep our neighborhoods safe. 
They are the ones who put their lives 
on the line every single day, who may 
not go home. They are the ones who 
are the pillars of every community in 
our great country. 
So on National Police Week, the 
number one thing we need to learn not 
just on this specific week, but in every 
week, is that we need to show them the 
necessary honor and respect that they 
deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the 
videos that get thrown in front of us. 
We have seen the handful of acts that 
all Americans find distasteful. But the 
uniform, that badge, the officers that 
serve every day, they serve our com-
munities with honor and with distinc-
tion. So it is really my pleasure and 
my honor to honor all those officers, 
including the ones in this very Capitol, 
who protect us every single day. 
All Americans need to remember 
that, that when times get tough, and 
you really need help, 911 is right there, 
and our officers show up and they are 
always ready to protect and serve. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Florida for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, from there, I am de-
lighted to go north a bit. We will go to 
my friend GT THOMPSON, who is the 
ranking member on the House Com-
mittee on Agriculture, and who hap-
pens to represent the largest geo-
graphical district in the State of Penn-
sylvania, in terms of congressional dis-
tricts. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
and I appreciate his leadership on this 
Special Order of standing with those 
who stand for us each and every night. 
These are folks, members of our law 
enforcement, who, because of what 
they do, because of their courage, be-
cause of their commitment, we can 
sleep without concern and fear and we 
can make our way throughout the day. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today during this 
National Police Week to honor these 
men and women in blue. Established by 
a joint resolution of Congress in 1962, 
National Police Week plays a special 
recognition to those law enforcement 
officers who have lost their lives in the 
line of duty for the safety and the pro-
tection of others. 
National Police Week is sponsored by 
the National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial Fund and supported by a va-
riety of organizations to honor the law 
enforcement community. The mission 
of the National Law Enforcement Offi-
cers Memorial Fund is to tell the story 
of American law enforcement, honor 
the fallen, and make it safer for those 
who serve. 
Over the past year, our law enforce-
ment officers have been in the spot-
light. Bad actors must be held account-
able, but it is dangerous to villainize 
all police officers, and it is even more 
dangerous to seek to defund the police. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
the National Police Week resolution, 
which honors by name the 384 officers 
who were killed in the line of duty in 
2020. 
This 
resolution 
underscores 
the 
steadfast support and appreciation for 
law enforcement. As we honor National 
Police Week, it is important to take a 
moment to remember the sacrifices 
many officers, as well as their families, 
have made. 
b 1830 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. TENNEY), 
another important voice to this Special 
Order tonight, my friend and colleague 
and classmate. We mentioned earlier 
how important New York is in this 
whole issue, particularly this year with 
the rapid rise in New York City, in par-
ticular, of their homicide rate and vio-
lent crime. I know she has a lot to say 
on the issue. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. JOHNSON so much for holding this 
very important evening of Special Or-
ders to honor National Police Week. I 
am so honored to be here on behalf of 
our men and women in blue, who do 
such a great job supporting us. 
Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to put out 
a few facts on this that I thought 
would be interesting to our listeners. 
There are over 800,000 law enforcement 
officers across the United States serv-
ing and protecting our communities, 
and I commend them as they serve at 
great personal risk. 
These public servants intervene daily 
in dangerous and life-threatening situ-
ations to deescalate tensions, to pro-
vide emergency care, to apprehend 
criminals, to defend the most vulner-
able, and to protect the constitutional 
rights of all Americans. 
Over the past year, law enforcement 
officers have faced unprecedented chal-
lenges in the face of the COVID–19 pan-
demic and rising violent crime. In 2020, 
264 law enforcement officers died in the 
line of duty. In my community alone, 
we have tragically lost friends in law 
enforcement, over a dozen in just my 
community who were killed in the line 
of duty. That is just way too many. 
In 2021, across the Nation, 49 law en-
forcement officers have died, making it 
the deadliest period for law enforce-
ment in decades. 
Amidst 
these 
unparalleled 
chal-
lenges, unfortunately, politicians in 
Washington and around the country 
have perpetuated this idea that law en-
forcement officers are the enemy. If 
any of you watched or saw the wonder-
ful law enforcement officer, who is also 
the mother of a young child, saving 
that toddler shot in Times Square, car-
rying this young child to safety, it 
would warm anyone’s heart.

We know how hard they work and 
how much they care for their commu-
nities. 
But, unfortunately, some have gone 
so far as to create a dangerous move-
ment, known as defund the police, that 
demonizes the police, imperils our pub-
lic safety, and needlessly divides our 
communities. 
My priorities in Congress are to sup-
port law enforcement and bring our 
communities back together. We must 
move beyond the divisive and dam-
aging rhetoric, mend the relationships 
between police and the communities 
they serve, and give our police officers 
the legal protections and tools they 
need to do their jobs safely and effec-
tively. 
We have done some of this in our 
community, and I want to highlight 
just one chief of police, Mark Williams, 
from the city of Utica, who has worked 
extensively in community policing pro-
grams, 
which 
has 
tremendously 
brought down the crime rate in terms 
of interactions with police. We still 
have challenges out there, but he is 
working hard to try to invest in com-
munity policing programs. 
We need money and resources to do 
that, and we would not be successful if 
we actually defunded the police and 
didn’t give them the opportunity to 
work with these communities to re-
cruit people, people in the neighbor-
hoods who want to protect their own 
communities and who actually care. 
Toward these objectives, I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle. We have to solve 
these problems. It is essential to our 
safety. It is an essential role of govern-
ment to keep us safe. Our constituents 
are depending on us. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Louisiana for doing this. I really 
appreciate the effort. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend and appre-
ciate those remarks. That is an impor-
tant perspective. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. 
BAIRD), a gentleman who also knows 
quite a bit about sacrificial service to 
the country and our communities. 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to show my support for our men 
and women in law enforcement. 
Unfortunately, there is a growing 
movement across this country that is 
trying to defund police departments 
and disparage the character of all of 
our police officers. This movement is 
having deadly consequences on our 
communities. 
We are starting to see what happens 
when we defund the police. For the 
first time in decades, violent crime is 
rising in the United States. Major 
American cities saw a 33 percent in-
crease in homicides in 2020. Many of 
these cities took the advice from radi-
cals and slashed their police depart-
ments, with the ultimate goal of 
defunding them. 
These reckless decisions didn’t make 
our communities safer. Instead, it only 
empowered criminals and put those 
most vulnerable in harm’s way. 
All Americans want bad police offi-
cers to be held accountable, but all 
Americans also want to be safe in their 
own communities. Police officers risk 
their lives every day to try to make 
that a reality. Congress should focus 
on making sure our police departments 
have the resources they need to keep 
criminals off the street while imple-
menting the needed reforms to hold ac-
countable bad officers. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. BAIRD. I appre-
ciate those comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for hosting this Special Order tonight. 
As we celebrate National Police 
Week, I would like to also add my 
voice to recognizing the brave men and 
women who put their lives on the line 
to keep our communities safe across 
California’s 39th District and beyond. 
We also honor those who have paid the 
ultimate price in the line of duty. 
I am proud to support our law en-
forcement and their important hard 
work that they do each and every day. 
From Captain Steven Tousey and Dep-
uty Louis Denver with the Walnut Dia-
mond Bar Sheriff’s Station in Los An-
geles County, who I rode along with, by 
the way, last week, to Orange County 
Sheriff Don Barnes and their hard-
working team, I am always talking to 
our law enforcement across Los Ange-
les, Orange, and San Bernardino Coun-
ties about how I can help make sure 
that they have the support and re-
sources needed to perform their de-
manding jobs and to learn how I, in 
Congress, can support our police offi-
cers. 
I would also like to recognize the 
men and women of our Capitol Police 
here in Congress who put their lives on 
the line to protect not only the Mem-
bers of Congress but our staffs and all 
the House staff behind the scenes who 
make this place run. We are so grateful 
for you and appreciate each and every 
one of you. 
This National Police Week, I encour-
age all of us to take the time to thank 
a police officer in your area. It is be-
cause of our police officers that we can 
live our daily lives each and every day 
knowing that we are kept safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be stand-
ing here and back the blue. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mrs. KIM. You are so 
right that we need to back the blue, 
and I am so grateful to be joined by so 
many colleagues that share that senti-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
to the gentlewoman from Minnesota 
(Mrs. FISCHBACH), another freshman 
who has made a real mark here on Cap-
itol Hill and who is very passionate 
about this issue as well. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for yielding to me 
on this important Special Order on Na-
tional Police Week. 
Mr. Speaker, it is National Police 
Week, and I rise today to join my col-
leagues in support of the men and 
women of law enforcement. 
We ask law enforcement to do an im-
possible job, and they do it with profes-
sionalism, 
compassion, 
and 
grace. 
Their days are spent putting them-
selves in harm’s way to keep us safe, 
and they are always on call. For that 
alone, they deserve our gratitude. 
But the men and women of law en-
forcement do so much more, and I want 
them to know that there are many of 
us who are not afraid to stand up and 
say that we support you. We see the 
sacrifices you make and the good that 
you do. We see the time that you spend 
away from your family and the emo-
tional toll the job takes on you. 
I think of my many friends and fam-
ily who are police officers and the hard 
work that they do. They will always 
have a special place in my heart. 
Even as the profession faces unprece-
dented scrutiny, the men and women of 
law enforcement still do their jobs with 
pride because, for them, it is about 
more than just a paycheck. It is about 
serving their neighbors. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
supporting, not defunding, law enforce-
ment. Let’s take care of those who 
take care of us. Together, let’s work on 
making our communities better. 
To the men and women of law en-
forcement in Minnesota and around the 
country, thank you. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mrs. FISCHBACH. That 
is an important perspective from the 
great State of Minnesota. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today, we celebrate National 
Police Week. After the year our police 
officers have endured, where radical ac-
tivists sought to defund them, even 
with asinine proposals to abolish them, 
it has never been more important to 
show our appreciation to them. 
For months, we have heard anti- 
American activists, and even some of 
our colleagues, tell us that the act of 
policing 
is 
inherently 
evil 
and 
unfixable. But, Mr. Speaker, nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
Last year alone, 264 police officers 
from across this country gave their 
lives while protecting their commu-
nities. Throughout it all, the over-
whelming majority of police officers 
are good men and women who have 
stepped up for their communities and 
built mutual trust that is vital to them 
doing their jobs. 
Sure, there are bad apples out there. 
I am a physician. We have bad apples in 
medicine, but we don’t seek to abolish

Nobody dislikes bad officers more 
than good officers because they give

and honor and should not be lumped in 
with the few officers that disgrace 
their profession. 
On the whole, police officers have 
done the best they can to defend their 
communities over this past year. For 
their thanks, 23 American cities have 
cut their budgets. Unsurprisingly, this 
has contributed to the biggest crime 
wave of the 21st century, making their 
jobs even harder and destroying dec-
ades of progress. 
For instance, New York defunded 
their police by $1 billion. The result is 
a 97 percent increase in shootings and a 
45 percent increase in homicides, espe-
cially crime in minority communities. 
Make no mistake, these horrifying 
statistics can be traced directly back 
to defunding the police. If it can hap-
pen to this legendary police depart-
ment in the country, the NYPD, it can 
happen anywhere, in your neighbor-
hood also. 
In reality, we should be investing 
more in our police. The job of a police 
officer is an incredibly difficult one. 
They are often asked to make split-sec-
ond decisions, which have enormous 
consequences. This is why we should be 
providing them with more resources 
and training rather than demonizing 
them. 
I, along with my fellow Republican 
colleagues, will continue to stand by 
the men and women in blue who faith-
fully and sacrificially serve their com-
munities and keep our families safe. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for those 
important words. You are exactly 
right. They need to be better funded 
and given greater resources and greater 
training, and we support that because 
we back the blue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), a 
dear friend who certainly shares that 
sentiment. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, service to 
our Nation comes in many forms, but 
none is more foundational to upholding 
our laws and protecting our commu-
nities than the service of America’s 
men and women in blue. 
On the surface, celebrating National 
Police Week means taking a moment 
to thank police officers for their serv-
ice. 
Looking 
deeper, 
National 
Police 
Week gives each of us a chance to re-
flect on the critical role that law en-
forcement plays in our society and to 
reaffirm our commitment to their im-
portant work. 
Respect for law and order is nec-
essary to build a strong community. 
Our vision forward increases funding 
for law enforcement to improve edu-
cation and ensure police have the tools 
to keep themselves and their commu-
nities safe. 
b 1845 
Now more than ever, we must stand 
united in our fight against Washington 
Democrats’ radical calls to defund our 
police. This rhetoric is dangerous and 
has real consequences on the safety of 
officers everywhere. 
Tragically, more officers have been 
killed in 2021 than in the past 2 years 
combined. Every officer who puts on 
that uniform does so at great risk to 
themselves. They run toward dan-
gerous situations and, by their cour-
age, ensure the protection of those 
whom they serve. Many make the ulti-
mate sacrifice in service to their com-
munities. 
For these reasons, and so many more, 
our Nation owes these heroes a debt of 
gratitude. This National Police Week, 
know that we salute police officers, not 
just today but every day. We are with 
them, and we are grateful for all they 
do to keep us safe. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. May I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing, Mr. Speaker? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 23 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
the First District of the great State of 
Alabama (Mr. CARL). 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Louisiana for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on this year’s Na-
tional Police Week to recognize the 
brave men and women in law enforce-
ment all over the country, as well as 
honoring the many police officers who 
have lost their lives in the line of duty. 
While some folks around this country 
and across the aisle are calling for 
defunding and debanding the police de-
partment, I am proud to be a strong 
supporter of our law enforcement, and 
I will always back the blue. 
Nothing was more obvious than this 
last week and a half when I was with 
the Border Patrol. We have got to put 
more money into our law enforcement. 
We are choking them down. We have 
got to get them more resources. Now 
more than ever, police officers are in 
need of increasing resources as well as 
increasing support from our commu-
nities that they serve. 
Police officers are willing. They 
choose an incredible and tough job 
with long hours and not enough pay, so 
it is critical for us to give them sup-
port and the respect that they deserve. 
I will continue doing all I can do to 
support law enforcement in south Ala-
bama and all over the country. I en-
courage all my colleagues to support 
and fully fund the police. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend from the 
great State of Alabama for his re-
marks. Indeed, these are concerns that 
we share from coast to coast. We will 
go back up to the great State of New 
York and hear from my friend who is a 
legislator and former Secretary of 
State. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the State of New York (Mr. JA-
COBS). 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support and gratitude for the members 
of law enforcement bravely serving my 
home in western New York and around 
the Nation. 
This National Police Week gives us 
all a chance to pause and appreciate 
the dangerous, selfless, and, unfortu-
nately, sometimes thankless job our 
police officers do. But we should not 
only honor them 1 week every year, we 
must continually show our support by 
resisting any and all attempts to 
defund our police. 
Every day, our police officers wake 
up, put on a uniform, and go out into 
the communities that they serve to 
protect us not knowing if they will re-
turn home to their families that 
evening. They continually put their 
lives on the line. 
I recently was humbled to honor nu-
merous officers in my home of Orchard 
Park, New York, and Lancaster, New 
York, who rescued residents from burn-
ing buildings and brush fires while they 
were off duty. 
We need police, and we need more 
young people to seek out a career serv-
ing their communities in law enforce-
ment. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
recent 
stereotyping of police over the last 
year has been a severe deterrent to new 
members joining and also caused mas-
sive retirements of existing law en-
forcement, making all our commu-
nities less safe. 
The assault from the left on our po-
lice must come to an end. It is impera-
tive that we properly fund, equip, and 
support law enforcement on the local, 
State, and Federal level. 
To conclude, our police are heroes 
and deserve to be honored as such. I 
join my colleagues in thanking them 
this week for their bravery and their 
service. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
perspective from New York. We will go 
from coast to coast out West back to 
California. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the Eighth District of California 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, my colleague 
from Louisiana, for yielding. 
I am honored to join in helping to 
celebrate National Police Week where 
we take a moment out of our lives to 
honor the commitment and the sac-
rifice of the men in blue and the men 
and women in uniform who help keep 
our communities safe. 
I represent one of the largest dis-
tricts in the United States, and, cer-
tainly, the largest district in Cali-
fornia. It is very challenging to police, 
and my constituents rely on the abili-
ties of the police to uphold the rule of 
law and to keep them safe in a very 
rural setting. 
Our law enforcement agencies in 
California’s Eighth District have done 
a tremendous job of this. Just this 
year, the San Bernardino County Po-
lice Department and Sheriff’s Depart-
ment have seized over 100 pounds of 
fentanyl. That is over half a million 
pills that they have kept off the street.

They have also helped, just this year, 
19 adults and four children escape the 
evil scourge of human trafficking. 
In Inyo County, the Inyo County 
Sheriff’s Department recently held an 
event in which they reclaimed almost 
200 pounds of unused prescription medi-
cation, keeping those toxic substances 
out of our landfill and out of our water 
supply. 
In Mono County, the Mono County 
Sheriff’s Department recently imple-
mented a 911 text to 911 system that 
will help the residents of Inyo County 
reach law enforcement services when 
they need it. If you know that county, 
Mr. Speaker, then you know how rural 
it is and how much those community 
constituents depend on a responsive po-
lice force. 
I know there has been a lot of discus-
sion in this body and in legislatures 
across the country about police reform 
this year. What I wish that all of our 
constituents knew is that there is 
broad, bipartisan agreement on 90 per-
cent of that legislation. We can solve 
this problem in a way that implements 
police reform, but at the same time, re-
specting the role that our law enforce-
ment members fill in serving our com-
munity that provides them the train-
ing and the resources that they need to 
do their jobs, and that honors the role 
that they play in protecting our com-
munities. 
So happy National Police Week, and 
I thank our men and women in uni-
form. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for those 
comments. 
Mrs. LESKO is another good friend 
and colleague. We trust her voice on so 
many things. Nothing highlights the 
need for law and order more than the 
current crisis at the border created by 
the Biden administration. She has seen 
this firsthand as she represents Ari-
zona. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. JOHNSON for yielding. 
For the past year, we have heard dan-
gerous calls to disband, defund, and 
dismantle the police. 
Guess what? 
Since then, dangerous crimes have 
skyrocketed. 
Is it any wonder? 
We have also seen a rising number of 
police officers killed or wounded in the 
line of duty. This is totally unaccept-
able, and the effort to vilify the police 
is to blame. 
Our Nation’s police officers are brave 
and hardworking men and women who 
put themselves on the front line each 
and every day to protect us and my 
constituents. These officers deserve to 
go home to their families at the end of 
the day. 
I am grateful for the sacrifices of our 
law enforcement officers in Arizona 
and throughout the entire Nation. 
Both, during the National Police Week 
and every single day, I will support our 
law enforcement and defend the police. 
The vilification of our police officers 
is having a terrible effect in our com-
munities. I have talked to police chiefs 
who are having a difficult time even 
hiring police officers, and this push in 
some of the legislation that we passed 
here in this very own House to take 
away qualified immunity from the po-
lice so that anybody can sue them per-
sonally is wrong. 
I will continue to stand up for the po-
lice, I will continue to stand up for the 
public, and I will continue to stand up 
for public safety. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Arizona for her remarks. We will 
stand up for the police. 
Mr. Speaker, you have heard many 
comments and similar sentiments here 
tonight. It has been echoed over and 
over. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to one more of 
my colleagues who is from the Sixth 
District of the great State of Wisconsin 
(Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand to honor our policemen and 
-women on National Police Week. Few 
things in this job are more illu-
minating than doing a ride-along with 
local law enforcement, and I strongly 
suggest to those people out there who 
think we have to change the laws to 
harm the police, contact their local po-
lice or sheriff’s department, do a ride- 
along, and find out what their job is 
really like. 
The week should be uncontroversial 
except for recently ambitious politi-
cians have decided to get reelected by 
tearing down the police. Black Lives 
Matter, an organization founded by a 
Marxist, attacks the police for racism. 
I ran across a local schoolteacher edu-
cating his students that police are rac-
ists. The Democratic Party passed a 
bill out of this House making it easier 
to sue a police officer. 
This is one of the strange situations 
in which the crisis politicians talking 
about is actually going in the opposite 
direction. I picked some statistics I 
could find at random. In 1971, 50 years 
ago, New York had 93 people killed by 
the police. Up until 1996, it was rarely 
under 20 people a year. Now it is rarely 
over 10 people a year who are killed by 
the police. There are reports on a study 
of people who died in the 30 largest cit-
ies in the United States. There has 
been a 37 percent reduction in police 
shootings leading to deaths. 
Harvard economist Roland Fryer re-
ports police are 47 percent less likely 
to discharge a weapon when attacked 
by a Black man, and Heather Mac Don-
ald in the proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences reports that if 
there is a bias in police shootings after 
crime rates are taken into account, it 
is against White civilians. 
The wholesale antipolice hysteria has 
dramatically increased homicides in 
Milwaukee and other big cities as the 
police become more passive. Wake up, 
America. Familiarize yourself with the 
statistics, and stand up to the politi-
cians who are riding antipolice hatred 
to reelection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Those 
are strong words, and they are accu-
rate. People have politicized this issue, 
and it is turning them against law en-
forcement, and it is a terrible, terrible 
situation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the Sixth District of the great 
State of Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to salute the incredibly brave patriots 
who keep America safe. This National 
Police Week, I want to share my pro-
found appreciation to members of our 
law enforcement community, our offi-
cers, deputies, and troopers, and espe-
cially those law enforcement officers 
who have lost their lives in the line of 
duty for the safety and protection of 
others. 
America is the land of opportunity 
because we are a nation of laws. For 
our Nation to remain strong, we must 
have law and order. 
Low morale is permeating police de-
partments across our Nation as rioters 
and lawbreakers repeatedly vilify, de-
monize, and verbally attack the thin 
blue line. I will tell you here today: 
any violence against law enforcement 
must end, and it must end now. 
Fair treatment in the justice system 
is critical, but it will not be achieved 
by the defund the police movement and 
cop-free zones. Lawlessness without po-
lice equals crime and the destruction 
of our Republic. 
In my State, Tennesseans know that 
the men and women who serve in law 
enforcement are some of the best peo-
ple in our communities. They run to-
wards danger, never away, and they 
risk their lives to protect us and our 
families. Those who serve in law en-
forcement deserve the respect of every 
citizen every day. 
I thank our law enforcement officers 
for what they do every day, and this 
National 
Police 
Week 
we 
respect, 
honor, and remember those we have 
lost.

Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to yield to the 
gentleman from the Third District of 
the great State of Texas (Mr. TAYLOR). 
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
I often brag to my congressional col-
leagues that I hope one day America 
could be like the Third District of 
Texas. It is a truly magnificent county, 
Collin County. One of the many factors 
that has led to the success of our com-
munity is the hardworking police offi-
cers who undoubtedly have played a 
significant role. 
This National Police Week, we re-
member those officers who have made 
the ultimate sacrifice in the line of 
duty. 
I am proud to recognize the Collin 
County police officers who risk their 
own lives and well-being to make our

communities some of the very safest in 
the Nation. In fact, the cities of Frisco, 
McKinney, and Plano, all located in 
Collin County, were named three of the 
top 10 safest cities in America. 
This is a true testament to how well 
members of our community, families, 
neighbors, small business owners, non-
profits, and local officials collaborate 
with police departments to ensure 
Collin County remains one of the very 
best places in America to live, work, 
and raise a family. 
Let this National Police Week serve 
as a reminder that, in times of disaster 
or crisis, police officers are the ones 
who run toward the danger. Our brave 
officers go above and beyond to protect 
our communities, and I can never 
thank them enough. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas for those great words. 
I yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GIMENEZ), a very important voice 
and someone who has been on the front 
lines of community service, a first re-
sponder, a fire chief, which is my favor-
ite previous job of his, although he has 
been a mayor as well. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, we honor our incredible law en-
forcement officers who work tirelessly 
to keep our communities safe. At a mo-
ment when some Americans have lost 
confidence in our country’s institu-
tions, we must come together to forge 
a new path of unity and purpose by ad-
dressing every injustice while acknowl-
edging the positive actions of our po-
lice officers. 
This week, I cosponsored the JUS-
TICE Act to provide needed police re-
form to help ensure positive, fair polic-
ing. This legislation helps ensure law 
enforcement agencies and officers are 
kept safe. 
I know firsthand the importance of 
body cameras, not only for account-
ability, but also for the safety of every 
law enforcement officer. As mayor of 
Miami-Dade County, I was one of the 
first in the country to implement a 
program putting body cameras on our 
police officers. This legislation will 
help replicate what we did in Miami- 
Dade County across the country by 
providing $500 million for State and 
local law enforcement agencies to 
equip officers with body cameras. 
Police officers deserve to know we 
have their backs. Their commitment to 
their communities, their willingness to 
put their lives on the line to keep our 
children and grandchildren safe, must 
be commended and not attacked. It is 
time to step up and give our police offi-
cers the support they deserve. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentleman for that voice of author-
ity on the issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been honored to 
be joined on the floor by so many col-
leagues from around the country to-
night to honor our law enforcement of-
ficers this National Police Week. 
I was sitting here as I was listening 
to the speeches tonight, and I was re-
minded, as we always are as we sit on 
this floor of the people’s House, of the 
words that are inscribed right above 
your head there, our Nation’s great 
motto, In God We Trust. 
We are a Nation under God, as we 
know, and millions of Americans find 
daily inspiration in the Word of God. 
On National Police Week, it is appro-
priate to note that we find there a use-
ful reminder about the noble calling of 
those who serve our communities so 
bravely. Indeed, it is a divine calling, 
and I think those who are calling for 
the defunding and the disrespect of our 
police need to remember that it was 
God himself who ordained that author-
ity. 
In the 13th chapter of the book of Ro-
mans, it is subtitled Submission to 
Governing Authorities. I just want to 
read that in closing tonight, Mr. 
Speaker. It begins in verse 1 of Chapter 
13: 
Let everyone be subject to the governing 
authorities, for there is no authority except 
that which God himself has established. The 
authorities that exist have been established 
by God. 
Consequently, whoever rebels against the 
authority is rebelling against what God has 
instituted, and those who do so will bring 
judgment on themselves. 
For rulers hold no terror for those who do 
right, but for those who do wrong. Do you 
want to be free from fear of the one in au-
thority? Then do what is right and you will 
be commended. 
For the one in authority is God’s servant 
for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, 
for rulers do not bear the sword for no rea-
son. They are God’s servants, agents of 
wrath to bring punishment on the wrong-
doer. 
Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the 
authorities, not only because of possible pun-
ishment but also as a matter of conscience. 
This is also why you pay taxes, for the au-
thorities are God’s servants who give their 
full time to governing. 
Give to everyone what you owe them: If 
you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then 
revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, 
then honor. 
Mr. Speaker, I conclude tonight with 
that admonition, that we give honor 
where honor is due. That is what Na-
tional Police Week is about. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BEN-
EFITS 
ARE 
HURTING 
MAIN 
STREET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that Members have 5 leg-
islative days to revise and extend their 
remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I am a small 
business man. We own a small business, 
my wife and I. I know many small busi-
ness owners across America are strug-
gling to reopen and rebuild after 
COVID–19 
shutdowns. 
They 
simply 
can’t find workers to fill the job open-
ings. 
Why? Because the Federal Govern-
ment is disincentivizing people from 
working. Many people are making 
more money off unemployment insur-
ance than they would if they were back 
at work, and that is having a crippling 
impact on Main Streets across Amer-
ica, including in my district. 
People in Washington need to hear 
these stories. Southern Illinois is home 
to Belleville Boot Company, a military 
boot manufacturer founded in 1904. A 
year ago, they employed nearly 240 
workers in Belleville. But after each 
round of stimulus checks, as good as 
they may be, they had fewer and fewer 
workers showing up. Now, their work-
force has dropped to 26 percent, and 
they can’t find enough workers to fill 
the openings. 
In Alton, the Kreative Kids Learning 
Center has helped educate local chil-
dren for 51 years. The owner, Keith, 
says that they currently have 21 em-
ployees but are desperate for more. He 
runs ads in the newspaper, online, and 
on social media, offering a good wage, 
yet he received zero applications—zero. 
He has even had to turn children 
away because he is so short of staff. 
In Carbondale, Illinois, Mary Lou’s 
Grill has been a local staple since 1962, 
serving up the most famous biscuits 
and gravy in town. On a telephone 
town hall last night, Marilynn, the 
owner of Mary Lou’s, shared that her 
food suppliers are unable to hire 
enough people to run their facilities. 
That potentially means food shortages 
and 
skyrocketing 
prices 
for 
res-
taurants and customers. 
Before 
COVID–19, 
the 
Broadway 
Grille in Sparta, Illinois, had more ap-
plicants than they had positions to fill. 
But now, Justin, the owner, says that 
some former employees have told him 
they will not seek a job as long as they 
are getting unemployment benefits. 
He is so short-staffed that he doesn’t 
have enough people to answer the 
phone most nights. If he can’t find 
workers soon, he isn’t sure what he will 
do. 
This is not just a southern Illinois 
issue. It touches every community 
across this country. That is why I have 
invited several of my colleagues to 
highlight how their districts have been 
impacted. 
I will start, first off, by yielding to 
the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. 
WALORSKI), ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Worker and Family 
Support. She has many stories I am 
sure she can tell. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for hosting this 
critical Special Order to discuss the 
ongoing impact of enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits on Main Street busi-
nesses, the American workforce, and 
our economic recovery.

May 12, 2021 
Like many of my colleagues, I have 
seen ‘‘help wanted’’ signs all over my 
district. I have heard from local job 
creators about the difficulties they 
face in hiring workers they need just to 
stay open. Many have told me they 
can’t even get people to show up for an 
interview. 
Enhanced 
Federal 
unemployment 
benefits made sense last year as a way 
to keep those who lost a job and to re-
duce the economic impact of govern-
ment-imposed business closures and 
stay-at-home orders. But now, we are 
facing 
a 
much 
different 
situation 
today. 
Safe and effective vaccines are bring-
ing us closer to defeating COVID–19. 
Employers have updated their facilities 
and operations so workers can safely 
return back to work. Businesses are 
fully operating. 
Now is the time to reconnect unem-
ployed workers with their jobs, but en-
hanced jobless benefits are discour-
aging Americans from returning to 
work, making it impossible for busi-
nesses to hire. 
The Democrats’ partisan $1.9 trillion 
spending bill extended supplemental 
unemployment benefits of $300 per 
week until September 6. At this level, 
nearly 40 percent of jobless Americans 
can make more on unemployment than 
they can by returning to work. 
Main 
Street 
businesses 
shouldn’t 
have to compete with the Federal Gov-
ernment for workers. In fact, they 
can’t compete with the Federal Gov-
ernment for workers. The labor short-
age currently is crushing small busi-
nesses, which are fighting to keep their 
businesses alive while coming out of a 
pandemic. 
In late March, I hosted a virtual 
roundtable and heard from a Hoosier 
who owns a small insulation company. 
He told me: It has been quite the bur-
den to have all these tools on hand and 
all these trucks in the driveway and to 
put people in the seats to get them to 
be able to drive to homes to provide in-
sulation when nobody wants to come to 
work. 
Just last week, we saw the undeni-
able impact of these misguided policies 
when the monthly jobs report showed 
hiring slowing to a crawl in April in 
this country, despite millions of job 
openings. 
My biggest fear is that we will see 
permanent job loss across our economy 
as small businesses close their doors 
because they can’t hire workers that 
they need. 
But it is not too late to avoid this 
outcome. I recently joined Ways and 
Means Republican leader KEVIN BRADY 
in introducing the Reopening America 
by Supporting Workers and Businesses 
Act. Our bill would turn extra unem-
ployment benefits into a back-to-work 
bonus that would incentivize these 
workers to come back to work instead 
of staying on unemployment. The leg-
islation would also reinstate the Fed-
eral requirement that those receiving 
unemployment benefits be engaged in 
actively searching for a job. 
The American people have faced un-
precedented 
challenges 
since 
last 
spring. Now, safe and effective vaccines 
have given us renewed hope that we 
can defeat COVID–19, rebuild our econ-
omy, and return to normal life. 
Let’s not put our recovery at risk by 
pushing workers to the sidelines of this 
economy. Let’s get Americans back to 
work, Main Street businesses back on 
their feet, and the American Dream 
back on track for every single Amer-
ican. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS). 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to voice my concerns about 
the current state of the economy and 
the worker shortages that employers 
face due to the Democrats’ extended 
unemployment benefits. 
As a small business owner for 51 
years, I have seen a lot. I know first-
hand how challenging a year of govern-
ment-mandated shutdowns have been 
for business owners. 
The enhanced unemployment bene-
fits in last year’s CARES Act were 
meant to be temporary and targeted to 
the effects of this COVID–19 pandemic. 
Now, over a year later, and thanks to 
the success of Operation Warp Speed 
and the Trump administration’s focus 
on vaccine development, the economy 
is ready to fully open. Yet, millions of 
Americans who can return to work are 
choosing a government paycheck over 
earning an income. 
Unemployment was never meant to 
be a full-time job. We are telling people 
it is a career, for crying out loud, and 
living off the government for more 
than 26 weeks while you are capable of 
working will only delay our economic 
recovery. 
In Texas’ 25th Congressional District, 
hundreds of small businesses are feel-
ing the effects. They simply cannot op-
erate their businesses if employees 
refuse to return to work. States need 
to enforce unemployment laws. If em-
ployees are offered a job and they 
refuse 
it, 
unemployment 
benefits 
should immediately expire. 
Enhanced weekly payments will con-
tinue to eliminate the incentive to re-
turn to work. Under no circumstances 
should they continue past September. 
Vaccines are widely available if peo-
ple so choose, but there are no longer 
excuses to remain on the sidelines. 
b 1915 
Before the pandemic, we had the 
greatest economy in modern history. 
Certainly the best I have seen in 51 
years. For all the right reasons, and 
with thanks to the 2017 Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act passed by President Trump 
and Republicans, we had more jobs 
than people. 
However, under President Biden and 
House Democrats, we have more jobs 
than people, because what they ulti-
mately want is to make Americans re-
liant on the government. It is simply 
called socialism. It is victims versus 
patriots. 
In God we trust. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
former speaker because of his experi-
ence in small business and running a 
business for a majority of his life. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. 
MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to share stories of 
employers across the country who are 
struggling to find and hire employees. 
According to April’s disastrous jobs 
report, there are 8.1 million job open-
ings in the United States. Employers 
can’t fill them and, as a result, can’t 
operate their businesses effectively. 
The extended unemployment hand-
outs my colleagues across the aisle 
keep reauthorizing incentivize workers 
to stay at home and collect unemploy-
ment rather than go to work. 
I have talked with countless small 
business owners who cannot compete 
with these handouts and are facing a 
grave workforce shortage. 
I recently visited with manufacturers 
in Minnesota. They have had to reduce 
their output on medical device orders 
by 20 percent because workers, who 
they pay between $14 and $16 an hour, 
are making more on unemployment 
and choosing to stay at home. 
Paying people not to work won’t help 
us recover from COVID–19. We must en-
courage people to get back into the 
workforce and not stay on the side-
lines. 
The opportunity to work hard and 
get ahead is a pillar of the American 
Dream. Pursuing a career, providing 
for a family, and supporting our com-
munities, these are the things we 
should encourage and celebrate. 
We have got the vaccines. Now it is 
time to get back to work. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE). 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, for the last 
eight years, Charleston, South Caro-
lina, has been named the number one 
city to travel to. Even despite the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we have seen 
thousands of folks come and visit our 
beautiful, historic city. 
In the next 10 days, Charleston is 
going to welcome a PGA Tournament 
in Kiawah, South Carolina. There is op-
portunity everywhere. Our airports are 
full. We are seeing a record number of 
travelers this month and this year 
alone. People are on the roads driving 
to our beautiful city. Yet with all of 
this great tourism that we are having, 
we are having a massive labor short-
age. 
Take, for example, one of my friends, 
Wade Boals, who owns Saltwater Cow-
boys in Mt. Pleasant, a beautiful wa-
terfront restaurant where you can 
enjoy sunsets and a great cocktail or 
adult beverage of your choice. Rather 
than be excited about all this tourism, 
he is desperate to find help, desperate 
to find workers and staff to work his 
restaurant. So imagine a restaurant 
that once had 20 employees now has

three, and the demand on those staff 
who see no end in sight right now. 
But he is not alone. In the State of 
South Carolina, there are 85,000 jobs 
available in the last 30 days, and we 
have 116,000 people on unemployment 
today. If you want a job, you can have 
a job. And Wade is offering great bene-
fits, great salary, right on the water-
front. There is no better place to work 
than Mt. Pleasant, right on the water. 
The $1.9 trillion COVID relief pack-
age, meant as a short-term financial 
solution to help those most in need, 
has really turned into an entitlement. 
We are making people dependent on 
the Federal Government for their day- 
to-day life, when opportunity is all 
around them every day, even in the 
middle of the pandemic. 
It turns out, when you pay people to 
stay at home and not go to work, they 
actually do that; they stay at home. 
Wade is just one example. There are 
examples everywhere. Literally every-
one in every industry that I talk to, 
businesses large and small, are having 
the same problem. Employers are des-
perate to find employees. 
Everywhere, 
even 
in 
the 
supply 
chain—you look at what is happening 
this week with our supply chain. Truck 
driver shortages, a shortage of CDL 
drivers. Many of those folks are on un-
employment right now, rather than go 
back to work. We have enormous needs 
in every industry across the country 
today. 
The reality is that no business, large 
or small, could ever waste as much 
money as our Federal Government 
does. When I look around us here 
today, I see a House of Representatives 
that has the slimmest majority in a 
generation, and I see a U.S. Senate 
that is evenly split 50/50, yet we are 
chasing radicalism. This is not a ref-
erendum on socialism or radical policy. 
This year should be a referendum on 
both Chambers working together, in a 
bipartisan way, to get our kids back in 
school and our people back to work and 
through COVID–19 successfully. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. ESTES). I know that he has many 
comments that are vitally important 
to this issue. 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, Congressman MIKE BOST, 
for hosting this very important Special 
Order hour. 
Today, we are more than a year out 
from the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic, and we are also 5 months 
out from when the first dose of vaccine 
was administered. Defeating the virus 
through a safe and effective vaccine 
has been critical in reopening our 
country and our schools and getting 
Americans back to work. But the re-
cent partisan policies of the left dis-
courage work and create an employ-
ment gap in the country. 
I hear about this regularly in my dis-
trict in Kansas. Small businesses, who 
were hit hard by the pandemic, were 
forced to shut down, had stay-at-home 
orders, and are now struggling to find 
workers to get back reopened. 
One of those small business owners, 
Jessie Sterling, shared with me her ex-
perience of struggling to have full em-
ployment while she raises her young 
children, something that was much 
more difficult when the schools were 
closed. 
While her business has seen cus-
tomers return, many of her employees 
have 
not. 
Unfortunately, 
most 
of 
Jessie’s employees opted to stay home 
and collect expanded unemployment 
benefits rather than return to the 
workforce. The additional $300 means 
that most of the part-time employees 
are now making more on unemploy-
ment than they were making at their 
job. While Jessie is responsible for the 
education and care of her children, she 
now has the additional stress of pick-
ing up extra shifts to cover for the em-
ployees who aren’t coming back. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way. 
We need to shift our focus from the 
early days of the pandemic, when it 
made sense to expand these unemploy-
ment programs, to encouraging a re-
turn to work. 
Just 
yesterday, 
our 
neighboring 
State of Missouri opted out of the en-
hanced unemployment benefits, a move 
that will help encourage work and a re-
turn to normalcy. Today, my col-
leagues, Congressmen TRACEY
MANN 
and JAKE LATURNER, called on Kansas 
Governor Kelly to do the same thing. 
Our American spirit is built on resil-
ience, hard work, and ingenuity. We 
have had many struggles over the past 
year, but our history has shown us that 
we will overcome, not through a heavy 
reliance on a big Federal Government, 
but a reliance on faith, on families, and 
our own work ethic. We need to encour-
age all Americans to pursue these 
ideals and get our economy back to 
work. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), a person who 
really does understand small business 
and farming, who understands what it 
is like to employ people and how im-
portant those employees are. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, these 
are trying times for our country, spe-
cifically for small business owners and 
their families who, in some cases, are 
watching their livelihoods literally dis-
appear right before their eyes. 
The jobs report that was released on 
Friday was cited as the ‘‘largest miss’’ 
compared to economists’ expectations 
since 1998. The United States filled 
only 266,000 jobs of the estimated 1.3 
million that were predicted to be filled. 
That is more than one million jobs less 
than expected. The unemployment rate 
actually rose for the first time during 
this recovery. 
For over a year, our businesses have 
been shuttered and our schools closed, 
making it impossible for parents to re-
turn to work and for hardworking indi-
viduals to earn an honest living. 
To make matters worse, many of our 
local businesses simply cannot find the 
labor they need because Federal unem-
ployment benefits discourage workers 
from returning to the workplace, fur-
ther hindering the recovery of our local 
economies. 
President Biden dismissed these fig-
ures as merely a snapshot in time, re-
fusing to see that they represent the 
very real struggles our small busi-
nesses and communities are facing. 
Just this weekend, I hosted our an-
nual job fair in central Washington, 
and the changes that I saw were stark. 
Dozens of employers, who represented 
everything from the agricultural indus-
try to law enforcement offices, res-
taurants, distribution centers, to gov-
ernment contractors handling nuclear 
cleanup, were all looking to hire hun-
dreds of people. 
And guess what? 
Less than 100 applicants showed up. 
Two years ago, we had 500 attendees 
competing for many of the same kinds 
of jobs. 
Now, I know that our small busi-
nesses are the economic engine of our 
economy, and we must ensure that we 
can get that engine restarted as quick-
ly and as safely as possible. It is time 
we reopen our economy, get our kids 
back into the classrooms, empower the 
entrepreneurs who are the backbone of 
our economy, and allow America to re-
cover. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. HAGEDORN). 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for holding this 
Special Order. It is really a very impor-
tant issue all across the country. And 
it really doesn’t matter which district 
a Member of Congress represents; you 
are going to have these same problems. 
Mr. Speaker, I spent the better part 
of last 2 weeks, during our district 
work period, traveling southern Min-
nesota, meeting with all sorts of busi-
nesses, meeting with labor, talking to 
the chambers of commerce. I can tell 
you that, under normal circumstances, 
it is tough enough to run a business 
and it is tough enough to be productive 
and successful in small business. But 
when you have bad government poli-
cies—and that is what we have here—it 
makes it extra tough. In many cases it 
is limiting production. 
We are seeing companies, like United 
Commercial Upholstery in New Ulm, 
having to turn away work. They actu-
ally could do three times more work 
right now if they could find another 50 
employees. But it is impossible. 
It really doesn’t matter if it is 
skilled work or unskilled work; it is 
just across the board. 
I was up in Lonsdale, Minnesota, in 
Rice County, and talked to their cham-
ber of commerce, talked to the pack-
aging company, which is the biggest 
employer in town. They have produc-
tion disruptions across the board. They 
just can’t find the employees. 
Recently, in Rochester, I was at 
Crenlo Industries, where they make 
these high-end cabs for heavy produc-
tion 
equipment—Caterpillar,

Deere, those types of things. They have 
line employees, and they want to get 
those cabs worked through the line. 
Guess what happens? 
Employees don’t show up. They can’t 
fill the jobs. They have lots of disrup-
tion. 
We are seeing these supply chain dis-
ruptions all across the country, sky-
rocketing costs for materials and oth-
ers. A lot of this is tied to these bad 
policies. 
What I do appreciate is some of the 
Governors across the country who have 
taken it upon themselves to say: You 
know what we are going to do? If you 
don’t look for qualified work, if you 
don’t accept work, you are going to 
lose your unemployment compensation 
benefits. 
Unfortunately, 
in 
Minnesota 
and 
some other States, you have Governors 
that want to hang onto emergency 
powers and still not make those re-
quirements. 
I think at the Federal level, in my 
Small Business Committee and other 
committees 
represented 
here, 
we 
should look at how we can tie those 
benefits to make sure that there are 
those strings attached and we do every-
thing possible to get folks back in the 
workforce. It is time. And I know that 
that is always best for folks to have 
good, 
high-paying 
jobs, 
and 
be 
upwardly mobile and self-sufficient. 
b 1930 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. The inflation report 
came out this morning, 4.2 percent in-
crease in inflation. You have got to ask 
yourself what happened and how did it 
happen so fast? 
Well, one of the key things we are 
seeing in this economy is very clear. 
What we are seeing is that the pool of 
workers is actually quite small com-
pared to the demand for product from 
people who, frankly, have been locked 
down for over a year who are ready to 
go out and spend a lot of money that 
they have saved, get back to normal 
life, but there aren’t the necessary 
workforce in order to produce the level 
of goods that the economy is demand-
ing. So then, of course, the price of 
every individual unit is now going up 
because you have a scarcity of supply. 
How did this happen? Well, when this 
body passed a coronavirus spending 
bill, or the American Rescue Plan or 
however you want to call it, when we 
put in an additional payment of direct 
checks to individuals, not to mention 
extended unemployment benefits that 
are 100 percent to what their wages 
were before the pandemic, and you let 
that run through the later part of this 
year, you are going to see exactly what 
we have seen all across America. 
You have seen too many workers not 
filling their shifts. I will give you an 
example. I was at a McDonald’s drive- 
through, 24-hour drive-through in my 
district about 12:30 in the morning. I 
was hungry. The first drive-through I 
went through, there was nobody there 
working. They cordoned off the drive- 
through. Has anybody in America ever 
seen 
a 
McDonald’s 
24-hour 
drive- 
through closed? It was closed because 
nobody was there. 
The second McDonald’s I went to, 
there was one worker in the shop. He 
said, ‘‘It is going to take me 30 minutes 
to fill your order because nobody else 
is here, and I am making breakfast for 
the morning shifts.’’ 
We have to pull back some of these 
benefits. We have to, because the way 
you miss a jobs report by 750,000 jobs is 
by paying people to stay home. That is 
not working for our economy. It is not 
working for our small businesses, and 
we are starting to see the effects in in-
flation, and it is only going to get 
worse unless we act swiftly here in the 
Nation’s Capitol. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume to 
close. I thank the gentleman for his 
comments. I want to thank all of my 
colleagues who joined me and joined us 
here tonight. Thank you to my friend 
Representative JACKIE
WALORSKI
for 
cohosting this Special Order. 
We all agree that it was necessary for 
Congress to step up and act quickly to 
help hardworking Americans laid off or 
out of work during the widespread pan-
demic shutdowns. But here we are, 
three vaccines later, the States are 
loosening restrictions. We need to 
refocus on where we are going, on what 
we are doing, on making sure children 
go back to school and people go back to 
work. 
I am proud to support Ranking Mem-
ber BRADY’s Reopening America by 
Supporting Workers and Businesses 
Act. Instead of paying people to stay 
home, it will allow States to provide 
back-to-work bonuses and increased 
funding for reemployment services. 
In April’s dismal jobs report, which 
was mentioned earlier, it is an indica-
tion we have a long way to go. It is a 
time that we need to get our economy 
back on track and our people back to 
work. Every time we go down the 
street, if you listen to the people who 
spoke here tonight, jobs, help wanted, 
help wanted, help wanted, and no help 
to be found. Why? Because as good as 
an intention as we had when we passed 
the 
unemployment 
extensions, 
Mr. 
Speaker, what we are doing is we are 
prolonging this situation where we can 
actually get back to work. We can take 
these things off, we can actually be 
safe going to work. We are being vac-
cinated. Things are gearing back up. 
Let’s not go down the path of govern-
ment entrapment. Let’s go back to 
what America is about: People seeking 
employment when jobs are there, to 
bettering their family when jobs are 
there. Not through government pro-
grams, but through the opportunity of 
actually working every day to provide 
for their families and to provide their 
children and grandchildren with oppor-
tunities. 
We are going to have to do that be-
cause we have spent a lot of money this 
last year, quite often in making sure 
that our American citizens were taken 
care of. And rightfully so. But now it is 
time to go back to work. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
f 
OUR FRIENDS IN ISRAEL ARE 
UNDER ATTACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. MAST. I am joined by my col-
league here, Mr. ROY. There will be 
some colloquy going between us as we 
each feel the need to discuss what is 
going on in Israel right now, the re-
sponse by the world, the response by 
the United States of America. 
Mr. ROY, I don’t know if you have 
any opening comments that you would 
like to begin with, but we can certainly 
start with that. 
Mr. ROY. I would just say how much 
I appreciate the gentleman, I appre-
ciate his service, I appreciate his un-
derstanding 
about 
how 
important 
Israel is to us as an ally and how im-
portant it is for our country to stand 
united right now as we watch our 
friends under attack. I look forward to 
engaging with him. 
Mr. MAST. Let’s start with what my 
friend just said, our friends under at-
tack. That first word, ‘‘under attack’’ 
is the most important part to realize 
here. I want to quote one of our other 
colleagues in a statement, Ms. OMAR, 
in one of her statements about these 
very events. She said, ‘‘Israel air-
strikes killing civilians in Gaza is an 
act of terrorism. Palestinians deserve 
protection. Unlike Israel, missile de-
fense programs such as Iron Dome 
don’t exist to protect Palestinian civil-
ians. It is unconscionable to not con-
demn these attacks.’’ 
That is absolutely right. Palestinians 
don’t receive support like Iron Dome. 
That would be akin to giving al-Qaida 
or ISIS or the Taliban U.S. bomb tech-
nicians and military personnel to help 
them out. That would be the apples-to- 
apples 
comparison 
of 
giving 
the 
attackers, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic 
jihad, others, that would be the equiva-
lent of giving them those kind of as-
sets. 
Hamas purposefully makes their ci-
vilians the shields to their offensive 
points. That is not hyperbole. Think 
about that, what they do to their popu-
lation. I don’t want to just speak about 
this in platitudes. 
If the gentleman has anything to 
add, by all means, I will just yield to 
him as that time arises. 
I want to speak about these by spe-
cific incident to say exactly how much 
Israel is being attacked and let the 
American people judge who is the ag-
gressor here. We will go over both 
rocket attacks, which are acts of ter-
rorism, and suicide bombings. 
You might think I am reading every 
one of them in history, but I am not.

They are all serious, but I am reading 
what largely became the most serious 
of them. We will start just now with 
the rocket attacks. 
I am not going to read for today be-
cause the totals aren’t in, but as of 
yesterday, 
over 
600 
rockets 
were 
launched into Israel. When I say 600 
rockets, I don’t want people to think 
they are small, the size of this table or 
my cane. We are talking about Fajr-5 
rockets. They are made by Iran. They 
are 21 feet long. That is basically a lit-
tle bit longer than a Chevy Suburban. 
The warheads on these rockets are 
about 90 kilograms, or 200 pounds of ex-
plosives. To put that into perspective, 
what detonated underneath my feet 
when I lost my legs was probably some-
where around 5 to 10 pounds. So each of 
these warheads being fired in, some-
where around 200 pounds of explosives. 
So just yesterday, 600 rockets; May 9, 
six rockets; April 25, five rockets; April 
24, two rockets; April 23, 36 rockets; 
April 15, one rocket; January 20, one 
rocket; January 18, two rockets. 
Going back into 2020, December 26, 
two rockets; November 21, one rocket; 
November 14, two rockets; October 22, 
two rockets; October 16, one rocket; 
September 15, 13 rockets; August 21, 12 
rockets; August 16, two rockets; Au-
gust 2, one rocket; July 5, three rock-
ets; June 26, two rockets; June 15, one 
rocket; February 23 and 24, 90 rockets 
over the course of that Sunday and 
Monday. 
Moving into 2019, November 12, 190 
rockets launched by Palestinian Is-
lamic jihad; May 5, 200 rockets; May 4, 
250 rockets; March 25, one rocket; 
March 14, two rockets. 
Going back into 2018, November 12, 
one mortar; November 11, 17 rockets; 
August 8, eight rockets; July 26, 11 
rockets; July 14, 174 rockets, barrage, 
Israel. 
And we are talking about—let’s put 
into this perspective as well—a country 
roughly the size of the State of New 
Jersey, not the breadth of the United 
States of America. 
Mr. ROY. Has the gentleman traveled 
to Israel? 
Mr. MAST. Many times. 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware 
that even when it is the size of New 
Jersey, really the population center is 
really in an area pretty much the size 
of probably about a quarter of New Jer-
sey or half of New Jersey, right? 
In Lebanon, for example, at all times, 
there is about 150,000 rockets sitting 
there pointing at this space between 
Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in the north-
ern part of Israel, where virtually all of 
the population lives, of all walks of 
faith, by the way. They are under con-
stant threat, and without Iron Dome 
would be in grave danger, as they are 
taking this rocket fire from the Gaza 
Strip today. 
Mr. MAST. You are exactly right. We 
have both had the honor of spending 
time there. I have had the honor in my 
life of wearing two military uniforms, 
for a dozen years in the U.S. Army and 
also for a period wearing the uniform 
of the Israel Defense Forces. 
One of the things that I learned so 
well in my time spent serving there 
was what I feel the same way about as 
a father of four. When you go over 
there and you get to the weekend and 
the time for Shabbat dinner, each fam-
ily 
over 
there, 
because 
everybody 
serves, as they get their family to-
gether for that Shabbat meal, every 
family is waiting for a son, a daughter, 
a grandson, a granddaughter to come 
home from that weekend from that 
service that everybody is mandated to 
perform and that in all likelihood, 
sometime during their service, they 
will probably have to wield their weap-
on in defense of Israel, given the per-
centages of the times that they find 
themselves under attack. 
Mr. ROY. As we have been watching 
over the last several weeks with our 
friends in Israel under attack, particu-
larly this week with the amount of 
missiles that are going in, there has 
been wide success, obviously, with Iron 
Dome, but obviously that puts a con-
tinued stress on Iron Dome. Is the gen-
tleman as concerned as I am that we 
have this country standing alongside 
Israel to ensure that they have got the 
resources they need, that they can con-
tinue to have a strong Iron Dome, con-
tinue to be able to push back on the 
rockets that are being fired into Israel 
from Gaza Strip by Hamas? 
Mr. MAST. I could not agree more, 
and to put into perspective why, a 
great American word, Alamo. Israel is 
really, it is an Alamo in the Middle 
East, of freedom, democracy, human 
rights for all people. That is what they 
are in that region, and if we don’t 
stand for them, for that friend, that 
great ally in this region, who do we 
stand for? 
Mr. ROY. I am a proud Representa-
tive of San Antonio, Texas, where our 
Alamo stands, so I appreciate that ref-
erence. Is the gentleman aware that 
there has been numerous casualties, 
numerous deaths as a result of this 
rocket fire, very specifically including 
non-Israeli citizens? In fact, I saw some 
social media yesterday of a young In-
dian woman from the country of India 
who was killed while visiting Israel, 
and that there have been numerous 
others, children, and others that have 
lost their lives, and, also, thousands 
upon thousands of Israeli farmland 
that has been torched and burned, live-
lihoods that have been put into dis-
array as a result of this rocket fire. 
Does the gentleman agree with that? 
Mr. MAST. I totally agree. Let’s 
make a perspective on that as well. 
Mr. ROY. Please. 
Mr. MAST. I just went over a tre-
mendous list of years of rocket at-
tacks. Now, when Israel goes and flies 
over the Gaza Strip and puts a piece of 
ordnance on a target, it is because that 
location is where they were firing rock-
ets from. They are defending them-
selves. That is very specific. It is the 
definition of defense. 
All of those rockets and mortars 
being lobbed into Israel, those are fired 
entirely indiscriminately beyond, say, 
they are trying to send them in an 
area. They are not trying to send those 
rockets in to land and take down a 
date tree or some other kind of farm 
field or something like that. Their spe-
cific intent is to indiscriminately hit 
the largest centers of population and 
anybody or any piece of infrastructure, 
whether it is related to military, civil-
ians, restaurants, you name it, they 
don’t care. It is the definition of indis-
criminate killing. 
b 1945 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware 
that there have been numerous people 
who have thrown out the phrase that 
Israel—many of our friends, by the 
way—that Israel has a right to defend 
itself. I mean, we hear this regularly. 
Would the gentleman agree that 
Israel has more than a right to defend 
itself, but rather a duty and, in fact, a 
responsibility to defend itself, defend 
the people of Israel, and to stand 
strong as what you just described, the 
greatest democracy in the Middle East 
with a plurality of individuals in that 
country who respect freedom and de-
mocracy in a multiethnic population 
even as we are, as a result, I believe, of 
the previous administration, experi-
encing a renaissance in the Middle 
East, potential peace. We are seeing 
the response to that here, if the gen-
tleman would agree. 
Mr. MAST. I would respond to the 
gentleman by saying what greater call-
ing for any government, what greater 
responsibility 
for 
any 
government, 
than to protect its people. 
You speak at length about the pro-
tection that the United States of 
America owes to its people on the 
southern border. It is one of the things 
that you address so regularly. That 
carries over to what we are speaking 
about right here. 
I would add on this point simply to 
that: When I go back in time and say 
what brought about me going over to 
put on the uniform of the IDF, I was a 
student in Boston. At that time, a re-
cent Gaza war was going on, back in 
2014. What I witnessed there, aside 
from 
people 
who 
were 
protesting 
Israel—again, for going out there and 
defending herself—were people also see-
ing U.S. servicemembers like myself. 
They were out there to protest Israel, 
but they started harassing people like 
me and my family because they could 
see I was a U.S. servicemember. So, 
that goes to the jump that they make 
when they layer the United States and 
Israel next to one another. 
But what I said to myself after those 
experiences was this makes absolutely 
no sense. This is total hypocrisy. If any 
one of our neighbors—Mexico, some 
Caribbean 
country, 
Canada—started 
lobbing rockets or lobbing mortars into 
the United States of America, my 
friends in the service would go and 
eliminate those enemies. Everybody in

the United States of America would be 
grateful to them for doing so. How we 
do not afford that same right to 
Israel—or some of our colleagues do 
not—is absolutely beyond me. 
Mr. ROY. Would the gentleman be 
surprised if I told him that on my first 
trip to Israel in 2014 May, I believe, 
that we were able to take a helicopter 
tour of the north end of Israel, as I de-
scribed earlier, where the bulk of the 
population is, and fly up the Jordan 
River and go up to the northern part of 
Israel, and that we would have been 
able to experience visiting a hospital in 
Israel where Israeli doctors, Jewish 
doctors, were caring for at the time— 
the gentleman will remember in 2014 
what was going on in Syria and the 
devastating toll that the Syrian regime 
was having on its own people—and that 
there were children and women and 
those who were being attacked in their 
own country in Syria who were receiv-
ing the best, top-notch medical care in 
the world in Israeli hospitals? Then, 
Israelis were secreting them back to 
Syria and not making it public so that 
there would be no reprisal taken 
against the Syrians because they had 
gone to get care in Israel. 
Would the gentleman be surprised by 
that, based on his experience and his 
service in Israeli Defense Forces? 
Mr. MAST. Not surprised in the 
slightest. We have seen this not just go 
on for those who were wounded in 
Syria and other places. We can see it 
right here in our own area of the world, 
where Israel responded to the earth-
quake in Haiti and other natural disas-
ters around the globe. They are often 
among the first on the ground to go out 
there and respond. 
The gentleman has spoken about his 
time in Israel, and we have spoken 
about some of these rocket attacks. 
Again, I don’t want to live in the am-
biguous here. I want to speak to ex-
actly what has gone on in history. I am 
now going to move at this point to 
some of the suicide bombings that have 
taken place in the State of Israel and 
go through some of those. 
In 2016, a bus bombing, 20 injured; 
Hamas takes credit. 
Now, before I continue with just say-
ing ‘‘Hamas takes credit’’ or ‘‘Pales-
tinian Islamic jihad,’’ it is important 
to have perspective on that, as well. In 
2006, Hamas is not just a terrorist orga-
nization. In 2006, they became the ma-
jority-elected government for the Pal-
estinian Authority. So, when people 
talk about a two-state solution, you 
are talking about Hamas, which I am 
going to speak about in length here 
being the government entity that 
would be that second state. 
Let’s continue on. We will go to 2006 
here. Rosh Ha’ir Restaurant bombing, 
11 killed, Palestinian Islamic jihad. 
HaSharon Mall, December 2005, five 
killed, Palestinian Islamic jihad. 
Market bombing, October 26, seven 
killed, Palestinian Islamic jihad. 
Mall bombing, July 12, 2005, five 
killed, Palestinian Islamic jihad. 
Club bombing, February 25 in Tel 
Aviv, 
al-Aqsa 
Martyrs’ 
Brigades, 
Hezbollah involvement. 
Bus bombing, January 29, 2004, Jeru-
salem, 11 killed, Hamas. 
Liberty Bell Park bus bombing, Feb-
ruary 22, eight killed, al-Aqsa Martyrs’ 
Brigades. 
Ashdod Port massacre, March 14, 
2004, 10 killed in a double suicide bomb-
ing carried out by, again, Hamas. 
Beersheba bus bombing, August 31, 
2004, 16 killed, Hamas claims responsi-
bility. 
Again, I am reading to you just a 
small portion of all the attacks that I 
could read to you. 
Haifa bus 37 suicide bombing, March 
5, 2003, 17 killed. 
Bus station massacre, January 5, 
2003, in Tel Aviv, 23 killed, Palestinian 
Islamic jihad and Hamas. 
Mike’s Place suicide bombing, a pub, 
April 30, 2003, three killed, Hamas. 
Gross Square attack, May 17, 2003, 
two killed, Hamas. 
Jerusalem, bus number six bombing, 
seven killed, Hamas claims responsi-
bility. 
Davidka Square bus bombing, June 1, 
2003, 17 killed, Hamas claims responsi-
bility. 
The list could go on. I don’t know if 
you would care to comment on any of 
this as I could continue year after year 
with 
these 
suicide 
attacks, 
the 
stabbings, the bombings, the vehicular 
manslaughter, the rocket attacks. It 
goes on and on. 
Mr. ROY. I would say to the gen-
tleman that my response is that I 
could go through a similar list, and the 
gentleman has done that perfectly 
well. 
What I was struck by in my time in 
Israel, and that was particularly in the 
summer of 2019 as I already described 
and May 2014, the extent to which the 
people of Israel were so grateful, one, 
for the United States’ support in work-
ing with them on Iron Dome in order to 
have the technology, and not just Iron 
Dome, David’s Sling and all the various 
different technologies that they are 
using to be able to live, to be able to 
live in less fear, and their ability, by 
the way, to build a fence, to build an 
infrastructure and border in order to 
prevent traffic and people coming in 
that might wish to do them harm, and 
the extent to which they would tell 
stories about loved ones that each and 
every one of them had lost in one of 
these suicide bombings or some other 
attack. 
How gratified they were that many of 
these things were things they were 
talking about in the past and that 
Israel was moving forward and being 
able to live in peace and to be able to 
live without fear of those kinds of at-
tacks as much. 
I would just question whether the 
gentleman would agree that—I don’t 
necessarily always believe in coinci-
dences when we have an administration 
who refuses to even call Prime Min-
ister Netanyahu for the first 40 or 50 
days of the administration. We have an 
administration that was more inter-
ested in sitting down with Iran than 
sitting down with our friends in Israel, 
so that we might see that some of our 
enemies, our mutual enemies, are 
emboldened to engage in this kind of 
attack. 
Mr. MAST. I could not agree more 
with the gentleman. It is important 
that we acknowledge the truth. Who 
are our friends, who are our enemies, 
who those are that are posing a threat, 
what are the threats that they are pos-
ing, we make that known. 
That has an effect on the saber-rat-
tling, and we should take the saber-rat-
tling that is going on, whether it is in 
Iran or whether it is in a Palestinian- 
controlled territory or Syria or any-
where else, we need to take that seri-
ously. 
To your point about that pride that 
you saw and that friendship between 
the U.S. and Israel, on a separate expe-
rience, again, in Israel, I believe this 
was in 2017 for myself, I am with my 
wife. We are down on the Sea of Galilee 
with other Members of Congress, lit-
erally inside of a restaurant filled sim-
ply with patrons of that area. The pa-
trons in that restaurant stood up and 
to us, who were Members of Congress, 
the United States House of Representa-
tives, bipartisan, they sang ‘‘God Bless 
America.’’ 
I would challenge anybody that we 
could find many places across the globe 
where we would find a group of res-
taurant patrons who would stand and 
sing twice, in my experience, ‘‘God 
bless America.’’ 
Mr. ROY. Well, the gentleman re-
counts something that I experienced, 
as well, and, more than that, a heart-
felt description of the reasons that the 
Israelis were so thankful for our friend-
ship and our support and their belief, I 
believe rightfully so, that the United 
States’ relationship with Israel is a sig-
nificant part of their ability to exist as 
a nation, particularly under the in-
tense scrutiny and attack that they 
find themselves. 
Here we are, I think this Friday will 
be the 73rd anniversary of Israeli inde-
pendence. I think I am right about 
that. I pulled it out of my head. That 
almost now 75 years is, I think, in di-
rect connection to America’s support. 
Of course, it has ebbed and flowed over 
the years, but that support and that 
particularly strong support with Presi-
dent Trump moving the Embassy to Je-
rusalem, I believe that the people of 
Israel rightfully recognize that support 
is key to their security and safety, if 
the gentleman agrees. 
Mr. MAST. I totally agree. But it 
didn’t stop with moving the Embassy 
to Jerusalem. It had to do with ac-
knowledging if Iran is a friend or an 
enemy and reversing what had gone on 
with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action, moving away from Iran, mov-
ing back toward our consistent friend 
and ally, Israel. It had more to do with 
going out there and recognizing the re-
lationships that we have through our

cross-military training exercises that 
we 
do, 
sharing 
of 
military 
tech-
nologies, and so on and so on. 
It didn’t just end with acknowledging 
something that everybody knew for 
decades since the beginning of Israel, 
where the capital is. That was an im-
portant piece of it for the President to 
make that acknowledgment. But it 
went so far beyond. Would the gen-
tleman agree? 
Mr. ROY. Well, I do agree with the 
gentleman. I might say to the Speaker, 
in order to be deferential to my friend’s 
time, if I might ask how much time re-
mains in the gentleman’s half-hour? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. I would agree with the gen-
tleman. I would add a couple of other 
thoughts. I noticed today a tweet on 
May 11, which would be yesterday, by 
Supreme Leader Khamenei, ‘‘Palestin-
ians are awake and determined. They 
must continue this path. One can only 
talk with the language of power with 
these criminals,’’ i.e., Israelis. ‘‘They 
must increase their strength, stand 
strong, 
confront 
the 
enemy,’’ 
the 
enemy being, of course, Israel, ‘‘and 
force them to stop their crimes.’’ 
Would the gentleman agree that Iran 
is certainly responsible and tied to 
Hamas, to the supply of rockets and 
technology that is being targeted to-
ward our friends in Israel and that we 
must remember where Iran stands with 
respect 
to 
Israel 
and 
the 
United 
States? 
Mr. MAST. I thank the gentleman for 
his question. 
I could continue on through this list 
and read year after year, nine killed, 
nine killed, six killed, 14 killed, 11 
killed. I read Hamas, Palestinian Is-
lamic jihad, al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, 
and Hezbollah in that list, as well, and 
the list goes on year after year after 
year. 
As you look at those threats and 
those calls to violence, it begs the 
question—I can’t take credit for this 
quote. I forget who exactly said it first. 
But they said you don’t sell a gun to 
somebody that wants to shoot you. 
This was the failed policy that Presi-
dent Trump worked to correct, in re-
versing from that relationship with 
Iran and strengthening that relation-
ship with Israel. Would the gentleman 
agree? 
Mr. ROY. I would agree, and I think 
that it is critically important to re-
member who we are dealing with and 
who we empower at the expense of both 
our national security and the national 
security of our friends in Israel. 
I would also offer a tweet that I saw 
from his home base in Qatar, the 
Hamas political director and literal 
United 
States 
designated 
terrorist 
Ismail Haniyeh. He tweets his support, 
tweets his support of the attacks on 
Israel. 
This individual notes, and I don’t 
know that we need to get into cancel 
culture, but this individual notes that 
he won’t be banned from Twitter, and I 
think this is something we should all 
be cognizant of as we are looking 
around the world when we remember 
that, in the previous administration, 
with President Trump’s policies, that 
we were seeing extraordinary gains in 
peace in the Middle East, Arab coun-
tries recognizing Israel, opening up 
flights and engagement between Israel 
and countries that before would not 
recognize them. Does the gentleman 
agree with that? 
b 2000 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his question. 
Not only do I agree with that, but I 
think one of the most important points 
that we make on that is that it was 
without concession. We didn’t have to 
negotiate. The President did not nego-
tiate or barter a deal that said, Listen, 
you need to go out there and submit to 
another authority that is bombing you, 
sending mortars, sending rockets, kid-
napping people from your territory. 
You don’t have to submit to some 
other authority in order to have this 
peace. 
It was a negotiated peace based upon 
a truth and, I believe, an acknowledg-
ment by those other nations of exactly 
what has been read off here today. The 
historical documentation of rocket at-
tacks, mortar attacks, suicide bomb-
ings that point to the fact that Israel 
is not the aggressor. They show a tre-
mendous amount of restraint year 
after year after year. The fact that 
their enemies that attack them are not 
simply a smoldering pile of ashes at 
this point is demonstration of the re-
straint. 
I don’t know that if we had that kind 
of history, we would—that our enemy 
would not be a smoldering pile of 
ashes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would agree 
with the gentleman. I would suggest 
that the gentleman made the point 
best earlier when he said, How would 
we respond in United States of America 
if this many missiles were being fired 
from Mexico? 
Where, by the way, we have cartels 
who are operating control of our bor-
der. 
If we had, literally—and here is some 
of the data. The gentleman quoted 
some data. Here is some from my staff: 
More than 1,500 missiles—possibly 700 
already, I think the gentleman alluded 
to—in the last 72 hours, on average, 
every 3 minutes by Hamas; 200 of the 
rockets fired fell short of crossing the 
border and caused civilian damage; IDF 
targeting military PIJ and Hamas in-
frastructure, the operatives and the 
rocket launchers, an Iron Dome bat-
tery was operationalized from reserves. 
IDF forwarded an attack by an elite 
Hamas unit, which is trying to dig a 
tunnel into Israel. And now you have 
got the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Quds 
Brigade saying it will expand the ring 
of fire and target Tel Aviv, and after 
Tel Aviv with huge rocket barrage. 
This is the state of things in Israel. 
And to the gentleman’s point, and I 
will yield back: No American would be 
sitting here today—if I am sitting here 
in Austin, Texas, or San Antonio, 
Texas, about 150 miles to the west and 
over to Mexico, if we had 1,500 rockets 
firing in on San Antonio or Austin, 
look, man, I would be grabbing my 
weapons and I would be heading down 
to the border, and we would be taking 
care of business. 
This is the reality of what we are 
talking about. So when I hear people 
saying Israel has a right to defend 
itself, Israel has a duty and a responsi-
bility to defend itself, I support them 
fully. 
Mr. Speaker, I would yield back to 
the gentleman. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, by my cal-
culation, we should have about 2 min-
utes remaining. So I will try to give 
the gentleman the last word in just a 
moment. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just bring us 
back to what I opened up with for my-
self here. And that was the tweet, the 
statement that was put out in a num-
ber of places by our colleague, who I 
am absolutely astounded sits on the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs with me, 
Representative OMAR. That Palestin-
ians deserve protection and that Israel 
is somehow the aggressor committing 
an act of terrorism. And ask that the 
American people go out there, do your 
own research, look up what the history 
is, look at the attacks, see what’s 
going on, and judge that for yourself in 
the most honest way that you can. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman. This was kind of an im-
promptu colloquy, but I think this is 
the best of what we do in the House, 
and I would like to do it more often 
with you and other colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just say to the 
gentleman who has served in IDF and 
who has served in our Armed Forces: 
You bear the scars of your service, and 
we thank you for that. You know well 
what the Israelis are experiencing 
every day. And I am glad that you and 
I stand here united, along with at least 
the majority of conference. 
I wish it was more of a bipartisan 
agreement of our duty in this country, 
our responsibility to stand with our 
friends in Israel, with whom we have 
an extraordinary relationship. That 
our joint efforts to stand athwart ter-
rorists to build things like Iron Dome. 
To work together on missile defense 
technology has made this world infi-
nitely safer. 
And that the most recent administra-
tion, the President Trump administra-
tion, deserves extraordinary credit, 
which it never gets in the press, for 
what was an unbelievable achievement 
with respect to Middle East peace and 
the direction we were headed. 
And that we are going to stand with 
Israel. That we are going to make that 
an unequivocal statement, that we 
stand with Israel, we are going to de-
fend Israel, and we are going to make 
sure that we can work together in

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, continue to guard the 
path of the godly. Lord, You have filled 
us with reverential awe for You. So 
please keep our feet from stumbling or 
slipping. We acknowledge that without 
the shield of Your favor, our law-
makers labor in vain. 
Bless them as they embrace Your 
promise in Psalm 84:11, which states, 
‘‘The Lord will withhold no good thing 
from those who do what is right.’’ May 
this promise motivate our Senators to 
refuse to deviate from integrity. 
Mighty God, be a refuge and strength 
for us all. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge

ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
later this morning, the four congres-
sional leaders will meet with President 
Biden and Vice President HARRIS at the 
White House. 
Speaking for the Democrats, our 
hope is to come together and find com-
mon ground where we can work in a bi-
partisan way to overcome the many 
challenges of our time. We cannot be 
small-minded or passive. We must be 
big and bold to meet the changes in the 
world, the rapid changes that are oc-
curring in the world. 
The world is rapidly changing and 
has been for some time. Just like the 
steam engine launched the Industrial 
Revolution and a century of tumul-
tuous change and electricity changed 
things dramatically in the latter half 
of the 19th and early parts of the 20th 
century, the internet has launched the 
technological revolution. 
We are living through that period of 
massive change everywhere: in media, 
communications, transportation, how 
we learn and work and live. The world 
is not going back to the old way that it 
was, and America needs to adapt so our 
workers, families, and businesses can 
compete and prosper in the 21st cen-
tury. 
There are so many different changes. 
Let me just point out one that our so-
ciety has basically neglected, and that 
is about childcare. When I was a kid in 
the late fifties and early sixties, the 
typical 
American 
family 
had 
two 
spouses, only one of whom worked. I 
would get home from school every day, 
and there would be my mom for me, 
my brother, and sister, with milk and 
cookies, to make sure we drank our 
milk. She didn’t care if we ate our 
cookies. 
And she asked us: Did you have 
homework? We went out to play, but 
she was keeping an eye on us. We 
would play in the street. That was one 
of the places I learned the most, just 
playing stickball and other stuff in the 
streets of Brooklyn. 
But, in any case, that is not true 
anymore. The typical American family 
is not the way it used to be. The vast 
majority are either single-parent fami-
lies or two-parent families where both 
work. That means that childcare is 
much more needed to maximize both 
the happiness and productivity of our 
society in the 21st century. 
Parents sweat over childcare. They 
need to go to work, but who is going to 
watch 
the 
kids? 
Can 
they 
afford 
childcare? Is it good enough for the 
children, of course, whom they love? 
Our children are our most precious pos-
session. And if we don’t dramatically 
change childcare, we are going to fall 
far behind, far behind. I read some-
where that of the 37 OECD nations, we 
are 36th in childcare. Only Turkey is 
lower. 
In general, these things should not be 
partisan 
issues. 
Infrastructure 
and 
jobs, putting our economy on firm 
ground should be the work of both 
Democrats and Republicans. 
Another change, obviously, is cli-
mate. In the fifties and sixties, we 
didn’t even imagine a world with cli-
mate change. In the last 20 years, it

May 12, 2021 
has become apparent that we had bet-
ter do something about it or we could 
have worse times than this COVID 
year, every year, 10 or 15 years from 
now. The dramatic changes that will 
discombobulate our society and risk 
our health and our economy, just as 
COVID did, will happen if we don’t do 
anything. So fighting climate change 
and making sure America leads the 
world in emerging industries that deal 
with climate should be the work of 
both Democrats and Republicans. 
This Congress has proven that we can 
legislate in a bipartisan way, just most 
recently on the anti-Asian hate crimes 
bill and a bipartisan water infrastruc-
ture bill. I believe we will continue 
that trend by taking up and passing a 
bipartisan competition bill this work 
period. 
So as we head to the White House 
today, I hope our other leaders are 
thinking about how we can come to-
gether to solve our Nation’s problems 
in a bold and lasting way. One hundred 
percent of Democrats’ focus—and I 
think I can speak for Speaker PELOSI 
as well as myself and President Biden— 
is on delivering help to the American 
people. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
speaking 
of 
bipartisan 
legislation, 
today the Commerce Committee will 
begin marking up the Endless Frontier 
Act, one of the most significant invest-
ments in American innovation in gen-
erations. The bill will be at the core of 
comprehensive legislation to address 
American competitiveness and security 
in the 21st century. 
Once again, for the information of 
the Senate, it is my intention for the 
Senate to consider and finish competi-
tive legislation before the end of the 
month. There have been productive bi-
partisan talks over the last week to 
improve the Endless Frontier Act. 
This is an issue I have worked on 
with my friend the Republican Senator 
from Indiana for the past few years. He 
has been a great help, a great partner, 
and I appreciate his work. And, of 
course, Senator CANTWELL, our chair-
man of the Commerce Committee, and 
Senator WICKER, our ranking member, 
have come together. And everyone had 
to give a bit here, there, and every-
where, but I think we have a strong bill 
that should get strong bipartisan sup-
port. 
The simple truth is very simple. The 
Endless Frontier Act is legislation our 
country desperately needs. For decades 
after the Second World War, our coun-
try led the world in science and tech-
nology, from healthcare to computers, 
from telecommunications to manufac-
turing, 
to 
defense. 
Our 
workforce 
brought these innovations to the global 
economy, and it produced more than 
half a century of prosperity. 
People in the last 50 years, from 1950 
to 2000, thought the future was going to 
be better even than the present, and it 
created the usual American optimism. 
But things have changed, and one of 
the things that has changed is years of 
Federal investment in sciences, and 
they have exposed long-term weak 
spots—serious weak spots—in our eco-
nomic competitiveness. This could hurt 
us dramatically in the next 50 years. 
The longer we put off investing in 
sciences, the likelier it is that other 
countries, like China but others too, 
will overtake America as the global 
leader in innovation, and that will 
have profound consequences for our 
economy, our national security, even 
the future of human liberty, and it will 
have a lot to do with whether Ameri-
cans believe that the future economi-
cally will be better for them than the 
present, which is part of the American 
hallmark and trademark, our sunny 
optimism, which we must restore. 
There has been a sourness in the land 
lately. It is our mission to restore it. 
So to take the initiative back, the 
Endless Frontier Act provides $100 bil-
lion for basic research through the Na-
tional Science Foundation, focusing on 
the critical technologies of tomorrow, 
where we have to stay the leader: AI, 
advanced 
manufacturing, 
renewable 
energy, quantum computing, cyber se-
curity, 5G, battery storage, and so 
much more. 
This bill will nurture tech labs and 
tech hubs across the country in places 
where they are not now. We have to 
spread the wealth. The clock is ticking 
on the need to make these critical in-
vestments. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
gone to extraordinary lengths to steal 
a generation of American intellectual 
property and cheat their way to inno-
vating and economic growth. We do 
not, we definitely do not—Democrats, 
Republicans, liberals, conservatives do 
not want a future where the Chinese 
Communist Party dictates the global 
order and how the world uses 5G, artifi-
cial intelligence, quantum computing. 
That is why the Endless Frontier Act 
is resoundingly bipartisan. We already 
have six cosponsors from each side—six 
Democrats, six Republicans—because 
these issues affect the future of our en-
tire country. I greatly look forward to 
the good work that Chair CANTWELL 
and the Commerce Committee will do 
to advance the bill this week. 
f 
REPUBLICAN PARTY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on a 
final topic, I am not in the habit of 
commenting on the House Republican 
minority, but today they have reached 
a new and very dangerous low point. 
Earlier this morning, the House GOP 
ousted LIZ CHENEY from the party’s 
leadership. Her crime? Telling the 
truth—telling the truth that Joe Biden 
is the legitimate President of the 
United States and Donald Trump is 
lying when he says the election is sto-
len. 
Congresswoman CHENEY spoke truth 
to power, and for that she has been 
fired. Make no mistake, the Congress-
woman and I disagree on so many pol-
icy issues, but we both agree that truth 
matters. And she, like so many char-
acters in history—I am just thinking 
now of Sir Thomas More—had the cour-
age to tell the truth and paid a big 
price for it. 
So this is sad—a very dark moment 
for the Republican Party. Republicans 
are seeking to perpetuate and act upon 
the big lie that the election was stolen, 
simply to placate the most dishonest 
President in American history. This 
President lies at will. He doesn’t care 
of the consequences for the future of 
grand, great, and wonderful democracy. 
He only cares about himself and feed-
ing his ego, and truth has nothing do 
with that. It mattered—what happened 
matters a great deal, and what the 
former President is trying to do hurts 
our country dramatically. The former 
President’s lies, right now, are poi-
soning our democracy, eroding our 
faith in government, and exciting a 
plague—often nasty, sometimes rac-
ist—of voter suppression laws. 
I had thought that January 6 re-
vealed the devastating consequences of 
the big lie. I thought that the invasion 
of our Capitol by an armed mob—a mob 
that sought to delay the peaceful 
transfer of power; a mob that I was 
within 15, 20 feet of at one moment— 
would demonstrate to all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, both 
ends of the Capitol, the awful price of 
Donald Trump’s lies. But after a brief 
and all-too-short period of introspec-
tion, it appears that the big lie is no 
longer on the retreat among Repub-
licans but, instead, is spreading like a 
cancer. 
Far be it for me to tell House Repub-
licans who should lead them, but it is 
truly a dangerous—dangerous—sign of 
our times that the price of admission 
in today’s Republican Party is silence 
in the face of provable lies. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
one-party takeover of our political sys-
tem—that is what Senate Democrats 
brought to the Rules Committee just 
yesterday, their side’s top priority for 
multiple years now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2465 
May 12, 2021 
The supposed rationales for the bill 
continue to change. A few years ago, 
when majorities of Democrats were 
mistakenly convinced that foreigners 
had hacked voting machines and tam-
pered with tallies in 2016, this was mar-
keted as an election security bill. But 
it keeps morphing to suit new head-
lines. Lately, it has been called a racial 
justice bill. Some Senators say it is 
really a response to some recent State- 
level legislation, even though their bill 
predates those bills by multiple years. 
A partisan power grab in search of a 
justification—that is what we have 
here. Voter turnout last November was 
the highest in decades. African-Amer-
ican turnout was twice as high in Mis-
sissippi as it was in Massachusetts. 
Democrats’ hysterical attacks against 
the new election law in the State of 
Georgia have been dismantled even by 
typically left-leaning fact checkers. 
There is no crisis. Our Democratic 
friends just want the power to rewire 
our democracy on a partisan basis. S. 1 
would take the Federal Election Com-
mission—the bipartisan panel that reg-
ulates elections and private citizens’ 
speech—and make it a partisan body 
run by the Democrats. 
It would let Washington Democrats 
act like a nationwide board of elections 
on steroids, neutering popular things 
like voter ID and forcing legalized bal-
lot harvesting onto all 50 States. This 
bill 
would 
let 
bureaucrats 
snoop 
around more in free speech; attack citi-
zens’ privacy so dramatically that even 
the liberal ACLU is unhappy; and even 
send public funds—get this: public 
funds—directly to politicians. 
Republicans put forward amendments 
to fix those things. If Democrats had 
wanted real, bipartisan solutions, Re-
publicans were there, right at the 
table, and ready, but Democrats voted 
us down. They wouldn’t even let us re-
direct any of that public money to the 
opioid crisis. They wanted that cash 
for their own campaigns. 
This partisan power grab failed to ad-
vance out of committee for the same 
reason it must never ever become law 
as currently written. It will shatter 
public confidence in our democracy if 
the Democratic Party decides it can rig 
the rules. 
f 
ISRAEL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a different matter, yet again, air 
raid sirens have been sounding in 
Israel. Israeli civilians have been hud-
dling in basements, shelters, and hos-
pital stairwells. Hamas rocket attacks 
are lighting up the skies, hitting build-
ings, and terrorizing, injuring, and kill-
ing innocent people. Of course, Hamas 
and Palestinian Islamic jihad receive 
significant support from Iran. 
Fortunately, a remarkable percent-
age of the incoming rockets have been 
intercepted in midair by Israel’s Iron 
Dome system. Americans should take 
some pride of our own in defending our 
friends with these high-tech defenses, 
which we have helped Israel bring on-
line and have advanced our own joint 
missile defense efforts at the same 
time. Missile defense is expensive but 
vital. It is yet another reason I am con-
cerned with this administration’s in-
tention to underfund defense. 
Whatever 
complaints 
Palestinians 
have with Israel’s Government, wanton 
violence against civilians is completely 
and totally inexcusable. This is bar-
baric terrorism, not a legitimate pro-
test; nor is it legitimate for Israel’s ob-
sessive critics to suggest any equiva-
lency whatsoever between these inex-
cusable attacks and Israel’s measured 
and quite targeted response against 
terrorists. 
Yesterday here in Washington, street 
protesters screamed—listen to this— 
‘‘Israel is a terrorist state.’’ On the 
streets of Washington, they screamed: 
‘‘Israel is a terrorist state.’’ Some 
Democratic 
Members 
of 
Congress 
echoed that rhetoric almost exactly. 
Look, the State of Israel has every 
right of self-defense. Its national secu-
rity leaders have continued to display 
restraint and invest so much in preci-
sion and avoiding civilian casualties. 
That has been the approach of the 
Israeli Government. 
Israel must know that their friends 
and allies here in the United States 
stand with them as they seek to re-
store deterrence, that we support their 
right to peace and security, and that 
we will not relax our efforts to hold 
terrorists and terrorists’ supporters to 
account. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now one final 
matter, Mr. President. This morning, I 
will be joining three other congres-
sional leaders to meet with President 
Biden at the White House. There is cer-
tainly no shortage of important busi-
ness to discuss. 
The 
President 
campaigned 
on 
a 
promise that his agenda would unite a 
divided nation. And he inherited a fa-
vorable situation. Vaccines were flood-
ing 
America. 
Science 
had 
proven 
schools can reopen. Job openings were 
beginning to pile up. 
Republicans sought to continue the 
2020 bipartisan streak on COVID relief, 
but our new President and our Demo-
cratic colleagues preferred a one-party 
approach. They used the end of the 
pandemic to pass what the President’s 
own 
staff 
admitted—admitted—was 
‘‘the most progressive bill in American 
history.’’ Not exactly shopping for con-
sensus. 
Republicans were upfront with our 
concerns. We said these old liberal 
ideas would slow rehiring, slow down 
the reopening, and stoke inflation. Of 
course, just a few minutes ago, the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics published the 
most dramatic monthly inflation re-
port in more than a decade. Many of 
the things American families buy have 
grown more expensive at a dizzying 
pace. 
Last 
week’s 
incredibly 
dis-
appointing jobs report showed what 
happens when Washington taxes work-
ing people to pay other people more to 
stay home. 
I am going to discuss these and other 
concerns with the President today, but 
I also hope we can begin to come to-
gether on pressing issues that should 
actually unite us. 
The last time Congress took com-
prehensive action on surface transpor-
tation 
infrastructure, 
83 
Senators 
signed on. By the way, that bill was 
produced by Senator Boxer, myself, 
and Senator INHOFE—a totally bipar-
tisan effort across broad ideological 
lines. The last time we drilled down on 
water resources, the margin was 92 to 
6. Infrastructure can and should be a 
bipartisan issue; the same for sup-
porting working families; the same for 
supporting our national defense. 
If the President can remember that 
he promised to govern for all Ameri-
cans, not just the far left, if my Demo-
cratic friends can remember they have 
just a 50–50 Senate and a closely di-
vided House—not exactly a sweeping 
mandate for a socialist agenda—there 
is much we can deliver together for the 
country. 
I hope today marks the start of a new 
course correction from this White 
House and a more successful dialogue 
across party lines. That is what Ameri-
cans need, and that is what they de-
serve. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Morning business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—Continued 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
motion to discharge the Brooks-LaSure 
nomination. 
The Senator from Texas is recog-
nized. 
MEDICAID 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, more 
than 4 million Texans, including half of 
the children in my State, depend on 
the stability of the State’s Medicaid 
Program to provide healthcare for 
themselves and their families. Every-
thing from emergency room visits to 
mental health care, Medicaid funding

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2466 
May 12, 2021 
is vital to the health of our most vul-
nerable friends and neighbors. The 
same is true in virtually every State 
across the country. 
Unfortunately, a recent move by the 
Biden 
administration 
has 
put 
the 
healthcare of these vulnerable citizens 
in jeopardy. A few weeks ago, the 
Biden administration rescinded ap-
proval of Texas’s 1115 waiver extension. 
I know that is an obscure reference to 
most folks, but, basically, here is the 
long and short of it. The previous ad-
ministration reached an agreement 
with the State that will enable billions 
of dollars to flow to Texans in need. 
Now, for some reason, the Biden ad-
ministration is trying to stop it. 
The real question is, Why? Why 
would the Biden administration try to 
jeopardize the healthcare for 4 million 
Texans, while the President has con-
sistently talked about ensuring every 
American 
has 
access 
to 
quality 
healthcare. Just 2 weeks ago in his 
joint session to Congress, he said: 
Healthcare should be a right, not a privi-
lege in America. 
So why would the administration 
take an unprecedented action to reduce 
access to healthcare for some of the 
most vulnerable people in my State? 
Well, the official answer from CMS is 
to correct an administrative error. But 
two Federal health officials did an un-
usual thing in Washington, DC, albeit 
anonymously. They told the truth. 
They told the Washington Post that 
this was done to ‘‘push State officials 
toward accepting the Affordable Care 
Act’s Medicaid expansion.’’ It is pretty 
bold to admit that this was not about 
an administrative error at all but 
about forcing Medicaid expansion onto 
the State of Texas. 
Many people will recall that this was 
a portion of the Affordable Care Act 
which was held unconstitutional in an 
opinion written by Chief Justice Rob-
erts. Chief Justice Roberts said that 
the Federal Government cannot put a 
gun to the head of the State and force 
it to accept the Medicaid expansion 
since it is a joint program between the 
Federal Government and the State. 
Now the administration is engaged in a 
game of political chicken, with 4 mil-
lion Texans on the line, and the only 
ones who are getting hurt are the low- 
income and uninsured Texans whose 
healthcare relies on this safety net. 
This move by the administration 
would have been damaging during nor-
mal times, but it is even more dam-
aging after this unprecedented year for 
our healthcare providers. In fact, it is 
downright reckless. Hospitals and pro-
viders in Texas have been pushed to the 
brink during the pandemic. On top of 
the additional expenses associated with 
COVID–19, they have faced serious fi-
nancial shortfalls from the pause on 
nonessential medical procedures as 
well as the hesitancy of patients to 
seek care because they have been wor-
ried about contracting the virus. 
Now, more than ever, hospitals and 
healthcare 
providers 
need 
reliable 
funding to plan ahead for their finan-
cial 
stability 
and 
uncompensated 
healthcare costs. If this funding stream 
goes away or is disrupted, it will di-
rectly threaten the healthcare for un-
insured Texans and harm the liveli-
hoods of healthcare providers as a 
whole. 
In rural areas and those that are al-
ready underserved, the consequences of 
this move could not be more dan-
gerous. Let’s say the Biden administra-
tion refuses to change course and 
Texas loses billions of dollars in Med-
icaid funding. If uninsured patients in 
small towns go only to local hospitals 
for emergency care, they will receive 
that emergency care because that is 
another Federal law, called EMTALA. 
But without the Federal funding to off-
set those costs, how would these hos-
pitals make ends meet? If these pa-
tients aren’t paying out of their pock-
ets and the Federal Government is not 
helping to cover the costs, what will 
happen? 
It is pretty simple, actually. Without 
funding, the rural hospital will close. 
So those same uninsured patients 
will start visiting the second closest 
hospital. In my State—it is a big 
State—that is, maybe, 30 minutes down 
the road. Maybe it is more than an 
hour away. Once again, without Fed-
eral funding to help cover the costs of 
treating rising numbers of uninsured 
patients, what will happen? 
Well, that hospital will close too. We 
will descend into a death spiral of hos-
pitals and healthcare providers that 
close their doors because they can no 
longer afford to provide healthcare. 
The hardest hit patients won’t be those 
with private health insurance; they 
will be those low-income and uninsured 
patients, especially in rural and under-
served areas. 
So the consequences of this irrespon-
sible move by the Biden administration 
could not be more serious, and they 
will be felt far and wide because this 
funding is vital to our healthcare sys-
tem as a whole. 
It is not hyperbole to say that these 
are going to have life-and-death con-
sequences. While patients in Texas may 
be the first to get caught in the game 
of political chicken, they will not be 
the last. There are only four States 
that don’t have approved or pending 
1115 waivers. Four—only four—don’t 
have approved or pending 1115 waivers. 
Every other State could find itself in 
the same situation as my State in the 
coming months. 
Florida was granted a waiver around 
the same time as Texas. What will hap-
pen to vulnerable Floridians? Ten-
nessee is already facing legal chal-
lenges to its waiver. Will its providers 
be in jeopardy too? North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Missouri, Idaho—the 
list of States that could be impacted by 
this life-or-death game of chicken goes 
on and on. The most vulnerable pa-
tients in States across the country 
could lose access to healthcare because 
of the Biden administration’s irrespon-
sible and reckless actions. Something 
must be done. 
To state the obvious, the nominee to 
lead the CMS, Ms. Brooks-LaSure, did 
not rescind the Texas Medicaid waiver 
approval. In fact, she has not been con-
firmed as yet, but before her nomina-
tion can advance, Members of the Sen-
ate deserve a commitment from the ad-
ministration that it won’t try to force 
the hand of States by putting the 
healthcare of millions on the line. 
If we don’t step up now and push 
back against this reckless move, what 
State will be next? How far will the ad-
ministration go—in the words of Chief 
Justice Roberts—to put a gun to the 
heads of the States, forcing them to 
dance to Washington’s tune? 
I have asked the administration to 
work with Texas to ensure that mil-
lions of impacted individuals won’t 
lose access to healthcare, but, so far, 
there has been zero progress. The ad-
ministration has been unwilling to pro-
vide any assurance that an agreement 
with Texas could be reached before the 
end of this fiscal year—something that 
would have dire consequences for our 
providers, especially those in mental 
and behavioral health. 
As a reminder, the CMS said the only 
issue with the Texas waiver was an ad-
ministrative error. Now it won’t even 
commit to providing reliable care for 
these patients. This unprecedented ac-
tion by the CMS threatens the security 
of the Texas Medicaid Program. It dis-
respects the continuity of this agree-
ment, and it erodes the partnership be-
tween the State and the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
I think it also violates the constitu-
tional authority of the States. The 
Federal Government is one of dele-
gated powers, with the rest retained by 
the States and we the people. That was 
the basis upon which the Supreme 
Court of the United States struck down 
the compulsory Medicaid expansion 
under the Affordable Care Act. Yet now 
the administration seeks to do through 
the backdoor what it could not do 
through the front door. This sets a dan-
gerous precedent of the administra-
tion’s undoing of agreements, nego-
tiated in good faith between the States 
and the Federal Government, for pure-
ly political reasons, and it could have 
cascading 
consequences 
across 
the 
country. 
I appreciate Ms. Brooks-LaSure’s ex-
perience in working with States to de-
velop these waivers as well as her will-
ingness to talk to me about this issue, 
but she doesn’t have any authority to 
force the Biden administration to undo 
its terrible and reckless mistake, at 
least not yet. Until Texas can receive a 
waiver and an assurance that this ac-
tion will be rectified and the rug will 
not be pulled out from under our poor-
est patients, I cannot support this 
nomination. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for 
the healthcare of their most vulnerable 
populations and push the administra-
tion to find an alternate path forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2467 
May 12, 2021 
If they are willing to do this to my 
State, they will do it to your State and 
every other State in the country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Democratic whip. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, they did 
it in a closed room. No one in the pub-
lic was allowed to watch. They did it 
by a voice vote so that there would be 
no physical record of how individual 
Congressmen—how they voted. And 
they decided to remove a Member of 
the Republican leadership in the House 
of Representatives this morning in 
that fashion. These proud, courageous 
disciples of Donald Trump didn’t want 
to be on the record publicly as to where 
they stood on the fate of Congress-
woman CHENEY. 
This is the same Congresswoman 
CHENEY who was reelected to leader-
ship in the House just a few weeks ago. 
This is the same Congresswoman CHE-
NEY who is one of the most ideologi-
cally conservative Members of the 
House. 
She 
voted 
with 
President 
Trump nearly 93 percent of the time 
while she was in office. With a name 
like CHENEY, it is hard to question her 
Republican credentials. 
No, the decision, in private, in secret 
this morning by a voice vote, was not 
about a disagreement over policy but 
the issue as to whether or not LIZ CHE-
NEY dares to tell the truth. 
She refused to defend or ignore the 
big lie that the 2020 election was stolen 
from Donald Trump, and in today’s Re-
publican Party, it seems like that is all 
that is necessary for grounds for re-
moval. 
More than 6 months after the 2020 
election was held, it is clear that the 
big lie has been spread in a big way. 
And that lie is not just a threat to the 
future of the Republican Party, it is a 
threat to our democracy. 
Since the start of this year, Repub-
lican State legislatures, inspired by 
Donald Trump’s big lie that the elec-
tion was stolen, have introduced more 
than 360 bills with restrictive voting 
provisions in 47 States—one of the 
most notorious examples, the State of 
Georgia. 
Remember, the State of Georgia— 
hotly contested in the 2020 election, 
and then the Trump troops came in and 
went to court over and over and over 
again, suggesting there was election 
fraud and dishonesty in the Georgia 
election. And the Georgia election offi-
cials, virtually all Republicans, stood 
up and said it was an honest election, a 
close one, but it was an honest elec-
tion. They were challenged over and 
over again, to the point where the 
former President of the United States, 
while he was still in power, called an 
election official in Georgia and basi-
cally threatened him; that if he didn’t 
change the votes and give President 
Trump what he thought he needed to 
win, he would pay a price for it. It went 
that far. 
To his credit, this election official 
stood up and said: The results are accu-
rate and I stand by them and I am not 
going to change it. 
It went that far. 
And there was a big turnout in Geor-
gia. In fact, there was an amazing turn-
out in the runoff elections for the two 
Senate seats won by JON OSSOFF and 
RAPHAEL WARNOCK, our colleagues here 
in the U.S. Senate. So even with that 
big turnout and even with the cer-
tainty that that election was honest 
from start to finish, the Georgia Legis-
lature decided to change the laws for 
voting in Georgia. It wasn’t volume 
they were looking for; it was loyalty. 
They wanted to make sure that the 
voters in the future would be friendlier 
to the Republicans. 
And so they changed the Georgia 
election law and made it harder for 
people, particularly people of color, 
young people, the elderly, and people of 
limited means, to vote. That law—that 
Georgia voting law—represents a bla-
tantly political effort to subvert our 
democratic process. 
Republicans of conscience know this, 
but it seems there is no future for 
those Republicans, if we reflect on the 
vote taken this morning in the House 
of Representatives Republican caucus. 
LIZ CHENEY’s expulsion from her role in 
the Republican conference is just the 
latest example of what happens to Re-
publican officials who dare to speak 
the truth about the 2020 election. They 
are not only silenced, they are purged 
from the party ranks. 
Our own colleague Senator MITT 
ROMNEY, not long ago a Republican 
candidate for President of the United 
States, was just censured by a Repub-
lican county organization in his State 
because he refuses to support the big 
lie of Donald Trump. The unfortunate 
reality is that, today, the loudest 
voices within the Republican Party 
have joined Donald Trump in declaring 
war on the basics of our democracy. 
That is why we in Congress need to 
do something. Immediately. This week, 
the Rules Committee held a markup on 
a measure that would combat voter 
suppression and protect our democratic 
process. It is known as the For the 
People Act. 
This is a democracy defense plan. It 
will ensure that all eligible Americans 
can exercise their constitutional right 
to vote without facing burdensome bar-
riers at the ballot box. The For the 
People Act invests in election infra-
structure, provides State and local offi-
cials with resources to run safe, secure 
elections. 
In addition to combating voter sup-
pression, the bill also reforms a broken 
campaign finance system that gives 
wealthy donors and big corporations 
far too much influence over our elec-
toral process. By passing it, we will 
say, loud and clear, that America’s 
elections are not for sale to the highest 
bidder. Above all, this legislation will 
strengthen the integrity of our demo-
cratic process and put more power in 
the hands of the people. 
Now, I know some of my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle are at-
tacking the bill as a ‘‘takeover’’ of the 
Nation’s election system. The truth is, 
American elections have already been 
taken over by special interests. This 
bill will start to restore our democracy 
and make it more accessible to every 
eligible American. 
I would love to know what my Re-
publican colleagues find so objection-
able about the legislation’s core provi-
sions. Listen, it automatically reg-
isters American voters when they get a 
driver’s license; it guarantees at least 
15 days of early voting; ends partisan 
gerrymandering nationwide; and brings 
greater transparency to the campaign 
finance system. These are reforms that 
will make our democracy whole again, 
and they are desperately needed, par-
ticularly at this moment in our history 
because in the world’s greatest democ-
racy, people shouldn’t have to wait in 
line for hours on end to have their 
voices heard. And yet that is the re-
ality for voters in States just like 
Georgia. And it is not an accident; it is 
intentional. Look at the people stand-
ing in the lines, and you can under-
stand why they are being discouraged 
from voting by waiting so long. 
Let’s be honest about these restric-
tive voting provisions being passed in 
State legislatures across the country, 
because they are grounded in one lie 
after another. The truth is that Presi-
dent Trump’s own officials at the De-
partment of Homeland Security de-
clared that the 2020 election was the 
most secure election in American his-
tory. 
The truth is, judges across the coun-
try, 
including 
many 
appointed 
by 
President Donald Trump, threw out 
more than 63 lawsuits that his fol-
lowers filed, challenging the results of 
last year’s elections. Why? There was 
no evidence, no basis in fact for the big 
lie. 
But the truth is, the big lie won’t 
just die with the 2020 election. It will 
sow distrust in our electoral system for 
years to come, unless my Republican 
colleagues act with courage. A few 
have done so. This morning, one paid a 
heavy price. 
The question to all of us is: Are we 
prepared to either discredit democracy 
or defend it? 
Rejecting the big lie is the defense of 
our democratic process. We have to 
join together in making certain that 
every American’s right to vote is pro-
tected. 
I yield the floor.

May 12, 2021 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND 
EMPLOYEES WEEK 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, our Na-
tion just concluded National Correc-
tional Officers and Employees Week. 
Because the Senate was not in session 
last week, I want to take this oppor-
tunity to recognize these heroes and 
everything they do to protect our peo-
ple and uphold the rule of law. 
Every day, correctional officers go in 
to work to guard and operate our Fed-
eral prisons, State prisons, and local 
jails. They not only administer justice 
on behalf of innocent victims, but they 
also defend the guilty from unjust ad-
versity. 
They combat the drug trade so that 
addicts can recover. They fight back 
against vicious prison gangs so that in-
mates can have a chance to find re-
demption instead of recidivism. They 
confront the most violent offenders so 
that persons with short minimum-secu-
rity prison sentences don’t turn out to 
have what is a death sentence. 
Without safety, security, and struc-
ture, our prisons and our jails would 
devolve into anarchy, into chaos, and 
crime. Correctional officers combat 
these forces of disorder so that these 
facilities can instead be centers of self- 
improvement and, indeed, correction. 
As a result, many inmates are able to 
pursue education, learn marketable 
skills, and find solace in God. 
The profession of a correctional offi-
cer is both noble and very dangerous. 
Fewer than 450,000 correctional officers 
protect and police approximately 1.5 
million inmates in a normal year, 
around the clock, every minute of 
every day. 
Riots, jailbreak attempts, and tar-
geted anti-police violence are common 
and result in particularly high-risk sit-
uations for correctional officers. In a 
9-year period measured by the National 
Institutes of Health, correctional offi-
cers suffered over 125,000 work-related 
injuries and 113 tragically lost their 
lives. 
Correctional officers willingly endure 
this danger, suffer these injuries, and 
sometimes give their lives so that our 
families, neighborhoods, and commu-
nities can be safe. The least we can do 
is to recognize their sacrifice and ex-
press our gratitude. 
This year, our correctional officers 
did even more than usual. For the past 
14 months, they have worked tirelessly 
to keep our inmates healthy in the 
middle of this global pandemic. They 
shifted normal confinement arrange-
ments, and they maintained order 
among the population under enhanced 
stress due to coronavirus protocols. 
Correctional officers have done an 
amazing job and saved so many lives 
during this crisis. Sadly, some even 
paid the ultimate price for their work. 
They should be proud of their work, 
and we ought to be proud of them. So 
from the floor of the U.S. Senate, I cer-
tainly can say I am proud of our cor-
rectional officers. 
But our Nation should go beyond 
gratitude. We ought to give correc-
tional officers the funding, the wages, 
the equipment, the facilities, and the 
support that they need. 
To start, Congress can finally crack 
down on contraband cell phones. In-
mates use them to maintain their 
criminal enterprises from behind bars 
and to terrorize those who put them 
there. They also use them to victimize 
other inmates and to prey upon ran-
dom victims outside prison walls. In 
other words, prisoners use these cell 
phones to undermine the life’s work of 
correctional officers. 
Contraband cell phones are even used 
as tools of retribution against the offi-
cers themselves. In 2010, a gang mem-
ber imprisoned in South Carolina used 
a contraband cell phone to order the 
murder of Captain Robert Johnson. 
Captain Johnson was then mercilessly 
shot six times in the chest and stom-
ach in his own house. Remarkably, he 
survived the attack, and he is now a 
leading advocate for taking action 
against contraband cell phones. 
Regrettably, the use of contraband 
cell phones shows no sign of slowing. 
On the contrary, they are becoming 
ubiquitous weapons inside of our pris-
ons. While available technologies can 
be helpful, it is also increasingly clear 
they are not capable of solving the 
problem alone. So that is why I will 
soon be reintroducing my Cell Phone 
Jamming Reform Act. This bill would 
empower State prisons to install jam-
ming technology and turn contraband 
cell phones into nothing but useless 
paper weights. This easy and common-
sense step will honor the hard work of 
correctional officers to clean up our 
streets and to keep our Nation safe. 
The men and women of this coun-
try—law-abiding citizens and those 
who serve their time alike—owe a debt 
to our Nation’s correctional officers. 
So I, once again, want to thank them 
for their courageous and diligent serv-
ice. And I hope they took time last 
week to celebrate National Correc-
tional Officers and Employees Week be-
cause they certainly deserved it. 
ABORTION 
Mr. President, a few years ago, main-
stream news articles trumpeted, sup-
posedly, stunning news out of Scan-
dinavia: Iceland was close to elimi-
nating Down syndrome. Eureka. Fan-
tastic. 
How is it possible? Have these Ice-
landic 
scientists 
discovered 
some 
amazing and miraculous new gene ther-
apy? No, they hadn’t because Iceland 
wasn’t eliminating Down syndrome. 
Iceland was eliminating babies with 
Down syndrome using prenatal testing 
to identify genetic anomalies and then 
aborting the babies that had those 
anomalies. 
According to one Icelandic genetic 
counselor—and this is a direct quote. I 
am not making it up. You might think 
I am. 
We don’t look at abortion as murder. We 
look at it as a thing that we ended. 
Imagine, how ghoulish that is. That 
is what this counselor and some like 
him believe, that a baby is just a 
‘‘thing.’’ But if they are honest with 
themselves, I think if they look into 
their hearts, they know the truth: Ba-
bies with Down syndrome aren’t just 
‘‘things.’’ 
They 
are 
living 
human 
beings of inestimable value who are 
loved by their Creator, even if they 
aren’t protected by the law or valued 
by too many in society. 
Sadly, Iceland is no exception. In 
many parts of the world, a Down syn-
drome diagnosis is tantamount to a 
death sentence. And while in America, 
thankfully, we are more welcoming, 
sadly, we still terminate roughly two- 
thirds of babies diagnosed with this ge-
netic condition. That needs to change. 
A civilized nation has a responsi-
bility to protect our most vulnerable 
people, and that means we have an ob-
ligation, especially, to protect unborn 
babies with Down syndrome. 
My home State of Arkansas passed a 
law to do just that—to make it illegal 
for an abortionist to perform an abor-
tion if they know it is motivated solely 
by a Down syndrome diagnosis. You 
would 
think 
this 
law 
would 
be 
uncontroversial. You would think a 
country that cares about ending dis-
crimination against people with dis-
abilities would leap at the chance to 
outlaw a particularly evil and final 
form of discrimination. After all, this 
Congress has taken many steps in re-
cent years to protect those with dis-
abilities. But, no, you would be wrong. 
That is not what happened. The abor-
tion lobby kicked into high gear and 
got a liberal judge to block Arkansas’ 
pro-life law from going into effect. 
The pro-abortion Guttmacher Insti-
tute denounced laws to protect babies 
with Down syndrome as ‘‘dangerous 
and coercive.’’ Now, this should not be 
surprising 
coming 
from 
the 
Guttmacher Institute. After all, it is 
named after a former leader of the 
American Eugenics Society, as so 
many abortion advocates can also 
trace their lineage to the dark, so- 
called science of eugenics of early last 
century. 
These modern-day eugenicists and a 
few liberal activist judges are putting 
babies with Down syndrome at grave 
risk every day. These babies can find 
no refuge under the laws of many of 
our States and our Nation. 
But, thankfully, that may be chang-
ing. The State of Arkansas is fighting 
to save its pro-life law in court, and to-
morrow, I and Representative ASHLEY 
HINSON, along with many of my col-
leagues in Congress, will submit an 
amicus brief urging the court to pro-
tect these most innocent and vulner-
able young babies. Time will only tell 
if the courts will hear these pleas.

But while we will make the most per-
suasive legal arguments available on 
the law and the facts, I must add that 
the most effective advocates for justice 
will always remain those little babies 
with Down syndrome and the parents 
who brought them bravely into this 
world. They will be the first to tell you 
that a person with Down syndrome 
isn’t a burden. It isn’t just a ‘‘thing,’’ 
to quote the Icelandic eugenicists. 
These babies are persons. They are 
fearfully and wonderfully made. They 
are created equal in the eyes of and 
image of God, just like each and every 
one of us. 
So let us fervently pray that one day 
soon, our laws will reflect this very 
basic truth and protect these innocent 
children.

IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH 
ACCESS FOR STUDENTS ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am 
going to talk for a few minutes about 
mental health for our kids. I think 
many Americans have known and, un-
fortunately, 
some 
Americans 
have 
loved some of our fellow citizens who 
suffer with depression and anxiety and 
thoughts of suicide. It is a particular 
problem for our young people. CDC re-
ports that one in four young Americans 
have actually considered suicide, and, 
in fact, the second leading cause of 
death for young people is suicide. 
I am sure there are a lot of reasons 
for this. I think it is harder to be a 
young person today. Many of our kids 
see things that those of us who are 
older didn’t have to deal with until we 
were adults—drugs, of course; alcohol; 
also, social media. You can still find 
kindness in America, but unfortu-
nately you have to go offline to do it. 
Some of our young people—many of 
our young people—just need someone 
to talk to. Some of them, when their 
anxiety and their depression is acute, 
need medical treatment, and this bill 
will simply provide a mechanism for 
our young people to receive it. 
The bill, as I said, is called the Im-
proving Mental Health Access for Stu-
dents Act. It would provide that 
schools—our universities—be required 
to print phone numbers for the Na-
tional Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the 
Crisis Text Line, and a campus mental 
health center or program on the stu-
dent ID cards. 
This bill would not require our 
schools to tear up current ID cards. It 
would be phased in. And if a school 
doesn’t use an ID card, they don’t have 
to start using an ID card. My bill

would simply require that the schools 
put the information on their website. 
This bill passed unanimously by UC 
in our last Congress, but, unfortu-
nately, the House ran out of time to 
take it up. 
Toward that end, Mr. President, as if 
in legislative session, I am going to ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 1585, introduced earlier 
today. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1585) to add suicide prevention re-
sources to school identification cards. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
know of no further debate on the bill. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If 
there is no further debate on the bill, 
the bill having been read the third 
time, the question is, Shall the bill 
pass?

lows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

INFORMATION TO SCHOOL IDENTI-
FICATION CARDS. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Section 487(a) of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.

following: 
‘‘(30)(A) In the case of an institution that 
creates and distributes identification cards 
for students at any time after the date of en-
actment of this paragraph, such institution 
shall include phone contact information on 
each such card for the following organiza-
tions: 
‘‘(i) The National Suicide Prevention Life-
line. 
‘‘(ii) Crisis Text Line. 
‘‘(iii) A campus mental health center or 
program, as determined by the institution. 
‘‘(B) In the case of an institution that does 
not create and distribute identification cards 
for students at any time after the date of en-
actment of this paragraph, such institution 
shall publish the suicide prevention contact 
information specified in subparagraph (A) on 
the website of such institution. 
‘‘(C) If an organization in clause (i) or (ii) 
of subparagraph (A) ceases to exist, the Sec-
retary may designate a different entity with 
a similar purpose to be included on the iden-
tification card.’’.

made by subsection (a) shall take effect be-
ginning on the day that is 1 year after the

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the nomination. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Ronald Stroman, of the Dis-
trict of Columbia, to be a Governor of 
the United States Postal Service for a 
term expiring December 8, 2021. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Michigan. 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE NOMINATIONS 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of the President’s nominees to 
serve on the U.S. Postal Service Board 
of Governors. I would like to thank 
Senator PORTMAN for working with me 
to swiftly advance the nominations of 
Ron Stroman, Amber McReynolds, and 
Anton Hajjar to fill the remaining va-
cancies on the Postal Service Board of 
Governors. 
Today, we are voting on the nomina-
tions 
of 
Mr. 
Stroman 
and 
Ms. 
McReynolds, and I expect to take up 
Mr. Hajjar’s nomination soon. 
The Board of Governors is an inde-
pendent, bipartisan body that provides 
leadership, strategic vision, and over-
sight of the U.S. Postal Service—one of 
the oldest and most trusted American 
institutions. 
For nearly 250 years, the Postal Serv-
ice has served communities all across 
our Nation. Countless Americans rely 
on the Postal Service to deliver crit-
ical medications and financial docu-
ments, to run their small businesses, to 
cast their ballots, to stay connected 
with family, and so much more. 
But the Postal Service continues to 
face enormous challenges. From long-
standing financial constraints to the 
impacts of the ongoing pandemic, the 
Postal Service has struggled to provide 
timely delivery and plan for its future. 
Our dedicated postal workers have 
shown time and again that they can 
get the job done when they are given 
the right tools and measures. The 
Board of Governors will be responsible 
for guiding the Postal Service through 
its current challenges and working 
with Congress to ensure that Ameri-
cans can rely on the Postal Service to 
deliver their mail each and every day. 
Mr. Stroman, Ms. McReynolds, and 
Mr. Hajjar are each highly qualified to 
serve as Governors. They are all ac-
complished leaders who bring diverse 
experiences and backgrounds that are 
currently 
not 
represented 
on 
the 
Board. 
Most importantly, they each under-
stand the public service mission of the 
Postal Service and are committed to 
improving and preserving reliable de-
livery service for Americans all across 
our country. 
Ron Stroman is a lifelong public 
servant who served as Deputy Post-
master General for nearly 10 years. He 
has a deep operational knowledge of 
the Postal Service and an extensive 
record of working across the aisle on 
postal issues. 
Amber McReynolds is the chief exec-
utive of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Na-
tional Vote at Home Institute and a 
former senior local government official 
for Denver, CO. She is a proven leader 
who drives innovation and understands 
how the Postal Service impacts both 
State and local governments. 
Anton Hajjar is an accomplished law-
yer who understands the unique chal-
lenges faced by the Postal Service’s 
large and diverse workforce. He has 
worked extensively in labor-manage-
ment relations, including forging com-
promises between Postal Service work-
ers and management. And prior to his 
decades of legal experience, as a high 
school student he spent a summer as a 
substitute letter carrier. 
Each of these nominees will each 
bring a fresh perspective to the Board, 
and I look forward to working with 
them to strengthen this vital public 
service for years to come. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting each of these highly quali-
fied nominees to serve as Governors of 
the U.S. Postal Service. 
I yield. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Iowa. 
AMERICAN FAMILIES PLAN 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, Wash-
ington has been on a dizzying spending 
spree over the past couple of months, 
passing trillion-dollar bills right and 
left. It is nearly impossible to cal-
culate the total cost. And now, Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats in Con-
gress are proposing several trillion dol-
lars in even more spending. 
With tax day approaching on May 17, 
the time has come to pay the bills for 
all of these government giveaways. 
And guess who will be forced to pay for 
it? Well, of course, it is the American 
people. 
Right now, Democrats are hoping to 
finance their ongoing spending splurge 
by increasing taxes on hard-working 
Americans across this country. One of 
the key tax hikes included in the Presi-
dent’s so-called American Families 
Plan would hit farm families especially 
hard. 
The Biden proposal would eliminate a 
protection that allows Iowa farm fami-
lies to pass down their assets to the 
next generation without a tax penalty. 
The Farm Bureau says the end result 
would be a significant tax increase on 
our farmers and ranchers. 
This is the last thing the ag sector 
needs as they continue on their eco-
nomic recovery. While hiking taxes on 
our farmers who help feed and fuel our 
Nation every single day, my Demo-
cratic colleagues also want to give a 
tax 
break 
to 
high-income 
coastal 
elites. 
And don’t just take my word for it. 
Congresswoman ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, the leader of the socialist 
squad in the House, says the Demo-
crats’ proposal to repeal the cap on the

to billionaires’’ and ‘‘a giveaway to the 
rich.’’ Never in a million years did I 
ever think that I would agree with 
AOC, but there is no arguing on that 
particular point. 
Those aren’t the only parts of the 
Democrats’ tax strategy that make no 
sense. According to recent reports, 
their demand to raise taxes on capital 
gains could actually cost the govern-
ment money. The calculation is that if 
rates get too high, people will just stop 
selling their assets. 
Well, here is an idea: Rather than 
taking more of Iowans’ hard-earned 
dollars to pay for their plans, maybe 
Democrats could stop their reckless 
spending. But let’s be honest, that 
probably won’t happen. They are the 
party of tax and spend, after all. 
Rather than raising taxes, my friends 
across the aisle could start by col-
lecting the $380 billion in taxes that is 
already owed, but not paid, every year. 
Current and retired government em-
ployees alone owe over $3 billion in de-
linquent taxes. Why should Iowans be 
paying the salaries and benefits of 
those who aren’t even paying their own 
tax bill? They shouldn’t. And that is 
why I am helping lead an effort that 
would collect the billions in back taxes 
owed by Federal employees. 
Another solution: We could bring in 
billions of dollars by closing a tax loop-
hole that literally goes all the way to 
China. If the communist regime was 
treated the same as a U.S. citizen, it 
would be required to pay taxes on in-
terest from our debt to China. 
But as a result of a three decades old 
treaty, communist China is exempt 
from paying taxes on these profits. In-
stead of increasing taxes on farm fami-
lies and working Americans, the Biden 
administration should collect the hun-
dreds of billions of dollars that is al-
ready owed to us and close the loophole 
that treats communist China better 
than our own U.S. citizens. 
Right now, to pay off your annual 
Federal tax bill, you would have to set 
aside every penny you earned from 
January 1 until mid-April, every single 
penny. 
Folks, Washington should be working 
for you, but it turns out you are work-
ing for Washington, and you can’t even 
claim the government as a dependent 
on your tax return. This plot to pick-
pocket taxpayers to pay for the left’s 
unpopular progressive policies is bad 
for our Nation’s economic recovery and 
even worse for working Americans who 
get stuck with the bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. First, I would like 
to associate myself with the remarks 
from the Senator from Iowa, who very 
clearly stated the problems that people 
all across the country are facing. I love 
the line about we can’t even claim the 
government as a dependent because the 
government truly is dependent upon 
the people of this great country. 
Tax day is just a few days away so I 
come to the floor to oppose the tax 
hikes proposed by President Biden. 
Today, tax revenues in America are at 
a near-record high of all times. We 
don’t have a revenue problem; we have 
a spending problem. Yet President 
Biden wants to take more money out of 
the wallets of America’s hard-working 
men and women. 
How much is he calling for? Aston-
ishingly, $3 trillion in additional taxes. 
This is on top of the taxes that are al-
ready being paid. It is the biggest tax 
increase in over half a century. 
It is supposed to pay for a lot of lib-
eral spending ideas. It is a big liberal 
agenda that this President is pro-
moting. Yet even with these historic 
tax increases being proposed, our Na-
tion will still need to continue to bor-
row money from China. 
In just over 100 days, President Biden 
has already put $1.99 trillion on our Na-
tion’s credit card. Now he wants more. 
In total, President Biden’s agenda 
would cost more than America’s total 
commitment to World War II. Are 
these liberal spending proposals as im-
portant to our Nation as was our vic-
tory in World War II? Of course not. 
As I have said before, our economy 
was already on track to be back to nor-
mal this summer. That was before 
President Biden passed his spending 
bill on a party-line vote crammed 
through the Senate after a middle-of- 
the-night debate, crammed through on 
a direct party-line vote using budget 
reconciliation. 
President Biden has said—it is inter-
esting, astonishing, and amusing to lis-
ten to the President when he says only 
the rich will have to pay these taxes. 
The American people have seen this 
movie before. We know as Americans 
that when we hear politicians say only 
the rich will pay, it is time to hold on 
to your wallet because they are coming 
for you. 
Working families are going to pay in 
the form of higher prices, lower wages, 
and fewer job opportunities. 
We are already seeing higher prices. 
We are seeing significant inflation 
since the day President Biden has 
taken office. We see it again today 
with the newest economic statistics 
that have come out. We hear about it 
at home on the weekends as we talk to 
folks at home about what is happening 
with their day-to-day life and their ex-
penses. 
Experts tell us that President Biden’s 
tax hikes could destroy a million jobs— 
a million jobs. When Republicans cut 
taxes in 2017—and it is good to be here 
on the floor with my friend and col-
league from Ohio who is one of the four 
horsemen who put that proposal to-
gether on behalf of the Republicans— 
revenue at the Federal Government ac-
tually went up. It is the same thing 
that happened when taxes were cut 
under President Coolidge and Kennedy 
and Reagan and George W. Bush. 
If you cut taxes, there is more money 
in people’s hands. They can do what 
they want to do with that money and 
make better decisions than the govern-
ment. I think it is very important to 
let people keep more of their hard- 
earned money. They make better deci-
sions than Washington, DC, does. 
People can decide what they want to 
spend, what they want to save, what 
they want to invest, how much they 
want to donate. And all four of these 
are very good for our Nation. That 
means more jobs, more growth, and, ul-
timately, more tax revenue with more 
people working, even though each is 
paying less in taxes individually. 
I have much more confidence when 
money is in the hands of the American 
people than I do when it is in the hands 
of the politicians in Washington, DC. 
I would urge all of my colleagues to 
say: Stop these tax hikes. Stop this 
reckless spending. Let people keep 
more of their hard-earned money and 
make decisions for themselves. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, 
I would like to congratulate my col-
league from Wyoming for his thought-
ful remarks. I mean, he is absolutely 
right. This is not the time for us to be 
raising taxes. 
It is tax day coming up next week, 
and Senator ERNST of Iowa put to-
gether this colloquy to focus us all on 
that issue and the fact that here we are 
coming onto tax day, yet there are pro-
posals out there saying you are not 
paying enough tax. So all of you who 
think you are paying too much tax, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
and the administration would like to 
increase those taxes substantially. 
It is going to really hurt our econ-
omy and hurt workers. That is my big 
concern about this proposal in this so- 
called 
infrastructure 
package. 
Our 
economy is kind of limping along still, 
in part, because we have spent so much 
in stimulus that it has overheated the 
economy, and you can see the inflation 
that is hitting us. You can see it in the 
gas prices when you go to the pump or 
food costs or, if you are trying to buy 
lumber these days, check out the cost. 
On the one hand, Democrats are en-
couraging more inflation through stim-
ulation that really wasn’t needed based 
on what we had learned from the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office— 
and that has overheated the economy— 
and, by the way, as former Secretary of 
the Treasury Larry Summers pre-
dicted. This was in a Democratic ad-
ministration, two of them. 
I am concerned about the spending, 
but then to pay for the spending, these 
tax cuts are really a mistake. What I 
would like to do is go back to the econ-
omy we had before COVID. That econ-
omy was really helping everyone. It 
was an inclusive economy. 
Two years ago, just before COVID, we 
had 
significant 
economic 
growth, 
which most people know about. What 
folks might not know about February a 
year ago, just before COVID hit, it was 
the 19th straight month of wage growth 
of 3 percent or more on an annual

May 12, 2021 
basis. Think about that, 3 percent or 
more wage growth. We haven’t had 
that in Ohio, my home State, in a long 
time, perhaps a decade and a half. 
That kind of wage growth was pri-
marily focused on lower income and 
middle-income workers, so the benefit 
wasn’t just to the companies and the 
people at the high end. The benefit was 
primarily to those who were at the 
lower end of the economic scale. 
We had a study by the Congressional 
Budget Office, as we looked to these 
corporate tax cuts that were made in 
2017, and they said that 70 percent of 
the benefit was going to go to workers 
in terms of higher wages and better 
benefits. That is exactly what hap-
pened. I think they were right. We tied 
the 50-year low in unemployment at 3.5 
percent. We also had historically low 
unemployment for some groups—His-
panics, Blacks, Asian Americans. 
In fact, before the pandemic, we 
reached the lowest poverty rate we 
ever had in this country. We started 
keeping track of it back in the 1950s, 
the late fifties. We had the lowest pov-
erty rate going into the pandemic than 
we had ever had. You probably haven’t 
heard that much because it wasn’t re-
ported much. Again, it was not just a 
growth economy; it was an inclusive 
economy. 
Importantly, the tax reform that was 
put in place in 2017 didn’t just help 
stimulate this kind of inclusive growth 
but also stopped these companies in 
America from going overseas. I remem-
ber this word ‘‘inversion.’’ The compa-
nies were literally inverting, meaning 
they were switching and becoming for-
eign companies to get out from under 
our Tax Code. We have two big compa-
nies in Ohio that did this. Probably 
some companies in your State did too. 
We were losing jobs and losing in-
vestments because they went overseas 
and took the investments with them. 
This was not a good situation for 
American workers. 
In addition, there was a lockout ef-
fect while companies were saying: I am 
not going to bring my cash home be-
cause it costs me too much. I will keep 
it overseas and invest it over there. 
So $1.6 trillion from overseas earn-
ings came back to our company after 
the 
2017 
tax 
reforms 
because 
we 
changed the way we taxed internation-
ally, and companies no longer had this 
incentive to keep their money over-
seas—$1.6 trillion. 
As a result of the 2017 changes, the 
largest U.S. companies increased their 
domestic research and development 
spending by 25 percent to $707 billion. 
They increased their capital expendi-
tures by 20 percent to $1.4 trillion. Be-
fore the pandemic, we had a good econ-
omy, but, importantly to me, it was an 
opportunity economy, creating jobs 
and increasing wages right here at 
home. All that progress could be 
thrown away through the tax increases 
that are being proposed. 
The centerpiece of the Biden plan is 
corporate tax increases that would 
raise the combined Federal and State 
corporate rate from an average of 25.8 
percent. That is the 21-percent Federal 
rate plus the average of the State in-
come tax for corporations. Twenty-one 
percent, by the way, is above the aver-
age of the OECD, the developed coun-
tries in the world. When we put it in 
place back in 2017, we did it at 21 per-
cent, specifically, to get right at the 
average so we wouldn’t be noncompeti-
tive. We would be able to compete and 
win. 
Since then, other countries have 
come below us, so we are actually 
above the average now. Yet the Biden 
administration would like to take this 
rate from 21 up to 28, but when you add 
the State and local, you know, the 
State taxes, it is to 32.8 percent. Again, 
it would put America, of course, as 
having the highest corporate tax rate 
in the entire world. It gives us a much 
higher tax rate than many of our com-
petitors like China. Why would we 
want to do that? 
Based on analysis by the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation, these combined 
corporate tax hikes are actually five 
times as big as the corresponding tax 
cuts were in 2017. Let me repeat that 
because it is fascinating. Democrats 
are proposing, they say, to get rid of 
the 2017 tax cuts, but that is not what 
they are doing. They are actually pro-
posing going back and adding five 
times more tax increases than were 
cut. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation— 
again, a nonpartisan group—says the 
tax cuts were about $300 billion over 10 
years, and the proposed tax increases 
are about $1.5 trillion. That just makes 
no sense for our workers. Again, CBO 
has said 70 percent of the benefit went 
to workers. Who is going to get hurt by 
doing this? The workers. 
The Biden plan also eliminates what 
is called the FDII, or the foreign-de-
rived 
intangible 
income 
provision. 
That is the one that incentivized U.S. 
companies to bring their intellectual 
property back here. We wanted that. 
We did it on purpose. The companies 
that did that brought all their IP back 
here, 
including 
Google, 
Cisco, 
Qualcomm, Synopsys, and Facebook— 
some pretty big companies and a lot of 
others. We wanted them to bring that 
valuable IP back here, and they did be-
cause it creates high-paying, high- 
skilled jobs here at home. Why would 
we want to stop that? That was the 
carrot to bring it back. 
It also makes it more costly for U.S. 
companies 
to 
operate 
outside 
the 
United States, again, punishing Amer-
ican workers who have jobs here that 
support international sales. Studies by 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office have shown, again, it is workers 
who will bear the brunt of that. This is 
what many seem to miss. When we talk 
about how this proposal makes us less 
competitive, we are really saying that 
it makes American workers less com-
petitive. It ties their hands behind 
their backs. 
In Ohio—this is one example—we 
have Procter and Gamble. Procter and 
Gamble makes a lot of diapers and a 
lot of other products. It is not cost-ef-
fective for them to make diapers here 
and ship them overseas so they have di-
aper plants overseas. That is the only 
way they can be competitive. These tax 
increases would punish companies like 
that if they are to do business over-
seas, even though they are creating 
jobs here in America by doing that. 
There are about 13,000 people who work 
for Procter and Gamble in Southwest 
Ohio, where I live. Forty percent of 
them have their jobs because of inter-
national sales. You are talking about 
losing thousands of jobs in America if 
they can’t be competitive globally. 
We want our American companies to 
be competitive globally, at least we 
should. These tax hikes are going to 
hurt our competitiveness and put do-
mestic jobs at risk. 
By the way, the Biden administra-
tion knows all this is going to happen. 
They know that increasing the cor-
porate rate is going to make us non-
competitive. 
Taxing 
international 
overseas earnings, taxing companies 
more that want to bring their IP back 
will make us less competitive. We 
know this because when Secretary of 
the Treasury Janet Yellen announced 
these proposals, she said: Help us, 
other countries in the world. Raise 
your taxes, too, to make it a ‘‘more 
level playing field.’’ It is a plea by 
America to other countries, saying: 
Please raise your taxes, too, so we can 
all be in this together. Other countries 
aren’t going to do that. Again, they ac-
tually lowered their taxes since 2017, 
on average. 
By the way, it is interesting. The 
Irish Finance Minister said right after 
that, when he was asked at a press con-
ference ‘‘Are you going to raise your 
taxes?’’ he said ‘‘No, we want to be 
competitive. We want to bring jobs.’’ 
Of course, they want to bring jobs to 
their countries. Other countries are 
looking at us and saying: Wow. Amer-
ica is just going to show the white flag 
and allow us to now beat them in terms 
of this global competition that is out 
there. 
That is the real world. It may sound 
good to raise taxes on business, but it 
is going to hurt workers, and it is 
going to make us noncompetitive. I 
really hope the Biden administration is 
not successful in this effort. I don’t 
want to see the workers hurt whom I 
represent in Ohio. I want to see us get 
back to that economy wherein we had 
not just low employment but rising 
wages and low poverty rates—the kind 
of inclusive economy we should all 
want. 
There are all sorts of other issues 
here, and I know my colleague from 
Iowa is probably going to talk about 
some of those, like the estate tax and 
the capital gains tax. I mean, there are 
all sorts of things that are being talked 
about. Yet, in this first package of in-
frastructure, just the corporate taxes

alone are going to be so damaging to 
our economy. Instead of pursuing these 
kinds of partisan tax hikes, let’s focus 
on getting back to where we were pre- 
COVID—back to that strong job and 
wage growth and back to that competi-
tive opportunity economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we 
are now in the final week of tax-filing 
season. While filing season typically 
ends on April 15, this year, taxpayers 
have until May 17 to file or to request 
an extension. 
This is also the third filing season 
under the tax cuts and reforms that the 
Republicans enacted in 2017. For the 
vast majority of Americans, this means 
they are paying significantly less in in-
come taxes than they were under prior 
law. Moreover, thanks to a nearly dou-
bling of the standard deduction, most 
Americans are paying less without hav-
ing the headache of itemizing their 
taxes. 
More importantly, prior to the pan-
demic, tax reform contributed to the 
best economy America had seen in dec-
ades. Unemployment reached a 50-year 
low and was at or below 4 percent for 24 
consecutive months. Family incomes 
and workers’ wages experienced robust 
gains. In fact, wage growth was the 
strongest for low-wage workers. As a 
result, we actually saw income inequal-
ity decline. 
Unfortunately, the current adminis-
tration’s ambitions to use the pan-
demic as an excuse to pass a Big Gov-
ernment, anti-growth agenda threatens 
our return to a thriving economy. 
First came its $2 trillion untargeted 
COVID relief bill that focused more on 
enacting a liberal wish list rather than 
on pandemic relief. A lot of my col-
leagues have referred to only 10 percent 
of that $1.9 trillion bill actually being 
related to problems caused by the pan-
demic. 
The 
dangers 
of 
passing 
this 
untargeted and largely unnecessary 
spending are already beginning to 
weigh 
on 
our 
economic 
recovery. 
Throughout the economy, prices are 
soaring, and job growth is tepid. April’s 
jobs growth data fell short of expecta-
tions by more than 700,000 jobs. This is 
deeply concerning, and it ought to be 
to every one of the Members of the 
Senate. 
I have heard firsthand from business 
after business in my State of Iowa that 
they are desperate for workers but that 
job applicants are scarce. As my Re-
publican colleagues and I have warned 
our Democratic colleagues for months, 
this is the natural result of the Demo-
cratic policies that pay people more 
not to work than to work. Yet, despite 
the obvious overreach of their liberal 
agenda, my Democratic colleagues are 
preparing to double down with an addi-
tional 
$4 
trillion 
Big 
Government 
spending spree. Then, in turn, to fi-
nance their progressive dreams, they 
are proposing trillions of dollars of job- 
killing tax hikes. 
You just heard from my colleague 
from Ohio, Senator PORTMAN, who went 
into that very deeply, how those tax 
policies are going to hurt our economy 
and the workers in our economy. 
Their proposals to roll back critical 
reforms to our corporate tax system 
would result in the United States once 
again having the highest corporate tax 
rate among our major trading partners 
and incentivizing companies to move 
headquarters abroad. 
Small businesses are also in their 
crosshairs. 
Family 
businesses 
and 
farms could be decimated by proposals 
to hike capital gains taxes and subject 
paper-only gains in family business as-
sets to taxation immediately upon the 
transfer of that farm or that business 
at death. 
My Democratic colleagues’ tax pro-
posal would make the United States a 
less attractive place to invest. It would 
erode American competitiveness and 
slow our Nation’s postpandemic eco-
nomic recovery. That means fewer 
jobs. It means lower wages for middle- 
class Americans. 
Postpandemic prosperity won’t be 
achieved through higher taxes and Big 
Government spending programs or the 
government itself, which consumes and 
doesn’t 
produce 
wealth. 
The 
real 
wealth of America is created by the 
working men and women of this coun-
try. If we are going to have this 
growth, it is going to be achieved 
through pro-growth policies and in the 
unshackling of our economy from 
stringent pandemic-era restrictions as 
we move toward a vaccinated world. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
was on the floor earlier this week, and 
I made a point that I think is really 
relevant to the discussion that we are 
having today as we are now looking 
straight into these proposals coming 
from the administration that would 
end up totaling $6 trillion in new 
spending. Now, that is not the annual 
appropriations; that is new spending. 
The point that I had made was that 
we have to go back pre-COVID and re-
member what was going on in this 
economy. Everything was thriving, 
really thriving, and people kept talk-
ing about how great the economy was. 
In Tennessee, I had so many people 
who would say: You know, I have more 
money at the end of the month, and be-
fore, during the Obama years, I had too 
much month left at the end of my 
money. 
Do you know what? They liked hav-
ing some money left over at the end of 
the month. 
That economy we had pre-COVID 
came about because of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act. It came about because of 
the work of President Trump and a Re-
publican-led House and Senate and, in-
deed, because of the support from some 
of our Democratic friends. This gave 
us, our country, the most robust econ-
omy we have seen in decades. Unem-
ployment had hit 3.5 percent—historic 
lows. Wage gains were at a record high. 
Pro-growth policies, like the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, had set a new stand-
ard. We proved we don’t have to tax 
and spend ourselves into oblivion to 
make a difference in the lives of strug-
gling families. It is a legacy that my 
Democratic colleagues wish the Amer-
ican people would forget because that 
memory is getting in the way of their 
work on behalf of big spending, big gov-
ernment, and big programs that take 
big bucks right out of the American 
taxpayers’ pockets. 
The Democratic agenda is not cheap. 
It is going to take a lot of taxpayer 
dollars. So how does President Biden 
intend to pay for this? It is called a $2 
trillion tax hike that targets all of the 
usual, supposed villains but that in re-
ality would harm the very people my 
colleagues across the aisle insist they 
are trying to help. 
Let’s look at the proposed corporate 
tax hike. Corporations are the left’s fa-
vorite villain, and they would certainly 
suffer under this scheme, but it is not 
the CEOs and the high earners who 
would feel the pain. As it stands, the 
proposal would impose a combined cor-
porate tax rate higher than any other 
developed nation. It would put us at 
the top of the heap in tax rates. The 
only way American corporations would 
maintain their competitiveness is if 
other countries were to set aside their 
advantages, which, of course, we know 
would never happen. Not only will the 
Amazons and the Apples bear the brunt 
of this decline, so will nearly a million 
small businesses. We call them the 
mom-and-pops, and they are organized 
as C-corps. 
Workers won’t escape the fallout ei-
ther. When the cost of doing business 
goes up, growth and investment stag-
nate, wages fall, and the people driving 
the economy suffer. That is right. This 
is going to hit Main Street in local 
communities where you are going to 
see small businesses that cannot afford 
to keep up with inflation, that cannot 
afford these high taxes, and that can-
not afford increased regulation. They 
are your friends and neighbors who 
have these small businesses. They are 
the ones who are going to suffer. And 
why will they suffer? Because the 
Democratic majority never ceases to 
have an outsized appetite for the tax-
payers’ dollar. 
Even conservative estimates from 
the nonpartisan Joint Committee on 
Taxation show that workers will bear a 
quarter of that new cost of doing busi-
ness. The workers, the laborers, are 
going to have this on their shoulders. 
Think about it. Think of what you are 
doing to families. 
The view doesn’t look any better 
from the owners’ side. Anyone taking 
advantage of an IRA or a pension plan 
will see a bigger tax bill too. 
Watching this White House make fis-
cal policy is like watching reruns of 
the Obama administration. The for-
mula is the same: Pitch a big idea.

Sound compassionate. Make a big 
promise—you are going to help all of 
these people—and then send the bill to 
hard-working taxpayers. They do it 
every time. 
Increasing taxes is bad enough, but 
now they are demanding bigger pay-
outs from struggling families and small 
businesses on Main Street in your com-
munity, and they are doing this in the 
middle of a pandemic recovery. They 
locked you down, and now they are 
going to push you down. They are 
going to shut the doors of your small 
business, your version of the American 
dream. Do they give a ripping flip? 
Probably not. It is all about getting 
the money to pay for what they want 
to do. It is a power grab. 
I would encourage my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to stop the 
madness, because we know this will 
cause irreparable harm to our Nation’s 
already fragile recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Alabama. 
(The remarks of Mr. TUBERVILLE per-
taining to the introduction of S. 1582 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I 
yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Utah. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as I offer 
these remarks on the Senate floor 
today, tensions between Israel and Pal-
estine continue to escalate to levels we 
haven’t seen in years. Innocent lives 
have been lost, and hundreds face inju-
ries. 
While the global media reports large-
ly paint Israel as the instigator of vio-
lence, this portrayal is patently false. 
It is simply not only not backed up by 
fact, it is contrary to the facts. 
Hamas, 
a 
U.S.-declared, U.S.-des-
ignated terrorist organization, pur-
posely exploited a nonviolent point of 
tension as justification to trigger a 
violent set of conflicts. 
On Monday night, Hamas launched 
thousands of rockets into Israeli cities. 
The intended targets? Well, the in-
tended targets were any Israeli person, 
civilian or not, residential or commer-
cial. The goal? Just to create destruc-
tion and terror. 
So to paint this action of armed ag-
gression as anything other than offen-
sive terrorism is disingenuous, and we 
in the United States and the U.S. Gov-
ernment itself must acknowledge and 
affirm Israel’s right to take propor-
tional action to defend itself against 
these attacks. 
What is perhaps even more disturbing 
and distressing than the media’s por-
trayal of these ongoing events is the 
Biden administration’s ongoing nuclear 
conversations in Vienna with Hamas’s 
No. 1 supporter—the Iranian regime. 
Iran, of course, is a well-known state 
sponsor of terrorism. It is a major 
funding source for Hamas, and their 
leaders continue to heap praise on 
Hamas, specifically for its attacks 
against Israel. 
Israel is undoubtedly our strongest 
democratic ally in the Middle East, 
and together, the United States and 
Israel have made great strides—tre-
mendous strides, historical, unprece-
dented strides—toward peace and sta-
bility through the region through the 
Abraham Accords. 
The Biden administration’s nuclear 
talks with Iran, as well as its posture 
of willingness to concede on sanctions 
relief to Iran without any meaningful 
corresponding gains to U.S. security, 
undermine both the U.S.-Israel rela-
tionship and the new partnerships 
formed by the Abraham Accords. 
We really must stand with our 
strongest democratic ally in the re-
gion, and we need to do that by recog-
nizing Israel’s right to self-defense 
against terrorism. 
U.S. policy really ought to be geared 
toward strengthening and not under-
mining this valued relationship. We 
certainly undermine that relationship 
when we legitimize a regime that is 
funding these very same terrorist ac-
tivities. 
I have gotten updates. Some of them 
are difficult to come by, given that 
sometimes it is hard to find real-time, 
accurate facts on what is happening on 
the ground. In addition to relying on 
U.S. media, I have relied on media 
sources from throughout the world. I 
have also spoken to people familiar 
with the area and in some cases, people 
who have lived or currently live in 
Israel. 
My friend Ruth Lieberman, a joint 
citizen of the United States and of 
Israel, recently commented, just not-
ing the exasperation that is in the air, 
noting the genuine source of frustra-
tion that she feels. She said: 
My kids are sitting ducks, and the world 
thinks we’re the aggressors. 
Ruth is one of many Israeli citizens— 
one of countless Israeli citizens—sub-
jected to these attacks. It is Ruth and 
her husband and their children who are 
among the many whose lives are put at 
risk every single day as a result of 
these cowardly acts of aggression. 
So we can’t hesitate to condemn vio-
lence when we see it; nor can we, nor 
should we ever step back and pretend 
that this is something that can be per-
ceived as a situation where language of 
moral relativism or even moral neu-
trality can fairly be applied. On some 
days, that would almost be a good day, 
if you could truly look at both sides, if 
the mainstream media could look at 
both sides with language of moral 
equivalence, but they don’t. They don’t 
even do that. Instead, they largely 
refuse to blow the whistle on the ag-
gressor and heap only blame and vitriol 
on our ally, which is not the aggressor. 
There are others who, regardless of 
whether they use terms of moral 
equivalence wrongly or even unfairly, 
heap blame on Israel and on Israelis. 
Some will resort to a different tactic, 
expressly or in some cases implicitly 
saying: Yeah, I know this is bad. Yeah, 
I know it is bad when hundreds and 
then thousands of rockets rain down on 
Israeli citizens, innocent victims, civil-
ians, often in residential neighbor-
hoods. Yeah, I know that is bad, but 
then again, Israel has a strong mili-
tary, in part because the U.S. supports 
its strong military and shares funding 
and equipment with the Israeli mili-
tary. 
Let’s think a little bit about the 
flawed logic there, how truly messed up 
that is. You know it is cold comfort to 
the men and women and children whose 
lives are put in danger every single day 
when they have rockets raining down 
on them; it is cold comfort to them 
when their loved ones die or are afraid 
to go outside even when they haven’t 
done anything wrong; it is cold comfort 
to them to say: Well, at least Israel has 
a strong military. 
Look, Iron Dome and David’s Sling— 
these great technologies that have 
been developed with the support of the 
United States—they provide a great 
source of security and comfort and 
safety to the Israeli people, and these 
same technologies benefit the Amer-
ican people as well. But let’s remem-
ber, those technologies are not fool-
proof. They can’t catch every single 
rocket. The more rockets that fire, the 
more difficult it is to protect citizenry 
from casualties. So let’s never make 
that mistake of saying it is not that 
big of a deal because Israel is well for-
tified and has a strong military infra-
structure and Israel has sophisticated, 
top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art equip-
ment. 
It doesn’t excuse—nor can it in any 
way, shape, or form negate—the terrors 
to which they are subjected. Look, 
whenever someone aggresses and starts 
firing on someone else, they are open-
ing up a whole can of worms. We can’t 
be good allies and we can’t be good 
global citizens unless we are willing to 
call out acts of unprovoked aggression, 
acts of violence, acts even of terrorism. 
Unless we are willing to step out and 
call those evil and unprovoked and un-
warranted—unless we are willing to do 
that—we won’t have the credibility 
that we need, not just with our allies 
but also with our enemies. We have to 
make sure that Hamas doesn’t enjoy 
our support—not directly, not indi-
rectly, not through our acquiescence or 
otherwise. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
the people in Israel. Everyone gets 
hurt—the Israelis and the Palestin-
ians—when Hamas engages in violence 
and then tries to pass that violence off 
as somehow a defense on their part. 
Nor can we allow Israel to be casti-
gated as the aggressor, as the insti-
gator of these acts of violence, when it 
is plainly and clearly not true. 
I hope our friends in the media and in 
the Biden administration will acknowl-
edge that. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2475 
May 12, 2021 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before the vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE NOMINATIONS 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the two U.S. Postal 
Service Board of Governors nominees 
that are before the Senate this after-
noon, as well as a third nominee under 
consideration later this month. 
Like our Presiding Officer, I had the 
privilege of serving our country in a 
time of war and a time of peace, with 
three tours in Southeast Asia and a 
good deal of time in the Cold War after 
that. My dad had many years in the 
Navy, and my uncle, my mom’s young-
est brother, was an enlisted man, a 
third-class petty officer on an aircraft 
carrier in 1944, the USS Suwannee. 
There was a kamikaze attack, and it 
never recovered. 
I know how important it was to my 
uncle, to my dad, and to myself when 
we would receive mail, whether it was 
in Southeast Asia, whether my uncle 
was deployed on his aircraft carrier or 
my dad was deployed around the 
world—how important the mail was. 
I know how important the Postal 
Service was to tens of millions of peo-
ple who voted last fall in local elec-
tions, State elections, and Federal 
elections across this country—more 
than ever, ever in the history of our 
country. 
There are some people I know who 
think that the Postal Service is a relic 
and is not something that we need. Ask 
the people who receive their medicine, 
not just their mail today, not just the 
things that they have ordered to come 
and are delivered by the Postal Serv-
ice—all kinds of stuff—but also the 
people who receive medicines, whether 
they are veterans or other people from 
all walks of life. 
The Postal Service today has had a 
profoundly challenging year. It has had 
a profoundly challenging year with the 
global pandemic. Drastic reforms were 
made without full knowledge of their 
service impact, and a busy holiday sea-
son created tremendous challenges for 
this venerable institution. 
Delays in mail and package delivery 
increased last year while employees 
struggled with the effects of the pan-
demic on themselves and their fami-
lies. At a time when reliance on mail 
and package delivery was perhaps high-
er than ever, the U.S. Postal Service 
struggled to deliver mail and packages 
in a timely and a predictable way. 
Delays in the mail service have real 
world impact in communities large and 
small. In Delaware, veterans of our 
Armed Forces had to wait longer for 
lifesaving 
medications 
and 
delayed 
packages. Our Delaware congressional 
delegation heard from literally hun-
dreds of constituents in our State 
about missed paychecks, credit card 
bills, and court notices. 
‘‘Mom and Pop’’ shops in my State— 
and I guess in Arizona, the home of our 
Presiding Officer—may have suffered 
from the delays. ‘‘Mom and Pop’’ shops 
in my State and across the country 
have suffered from delayed deliveries of 
important supplies to run their busi-
ness and to stay in business. Many 
poultry farmers, particularly in more 
rural parts of Delaware and on the Del-
marva Peninsula, to include the East-
ern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, 
too, were shocked to find that baby 
chicks died in the course of delayed 
postal deliveries to their farms. 
These impacts were unacceptable. 
They were driven by the pandemic and 
decisions largely made at the top of the 
Postal Service. 
Further, Postmaster DeJoy released 
in March a 10-year strategic plan that 
doesn’t do enough to address the sig-
nificant operational challenges being 
faced right now at the U.S. Postal 
Service. The plan limits operating 
hours and lowers service standards, 
which would harm many seniors and 
rural Delawareans up and down our 
State and across the country. If imple-
mented, such a plan would make it 
harder, not easier, to restore con-
fidence in the Postal Service. 
Fast forward to today. By selecting 
these nominees to the U.S. Postal 
Board of Governors, it has become 
clear that President Biden recognizes 
the dire need to get the Postal Service 
back to its core mission—reliable, af-
fordable, and on-time mail delivery 
service for Americans across this coun-
try. 
These well-qualified nominees—and 
they are well-qualified nominees—also 
make clear President Biden’s desire to 
drive innovation at the Postal Service 
that can keep costs low while boosting 
revenue opportunities and protecting 
the livelihoods of the men and women 
who work tirelessly to deliver our 
mail. 
Ron Stroman, whom I have had the 
privilege of knowing for more than a 
decade, is himself a former Deputy 
Postmaster General, a role he served in 
from 2011 to 2020, a longtime Federal 
servant—and he is a servant. Mr. 
Stroman has intimate knowledge of 
this institution and how to make long- 
lasting positive changes in large orga-
nizations like the U.S. Postal Service. 
Amber McReynolds is currently the 
CEO for the National Vote at Home In-
stitute and Coalition. What do they do? 
Well, they work to make it easier for 
Americans to vote securely, to vote 
safely, and to vote conveniently. Deliv-
ering ballots by mail is one of the most 
solemn obligations that the Postal 
Service has. It is the underpinning of 
our democracy in this country. 
Finally, Mr. Anton Hajjar is the 
third nominee, whose nomination we 
are considering later in this work pe-
riod, not today. Mr. Hajjar is the 
former general counsel of the Amer-
ican Postal Workers Union, where he 
fought to make sure that mail carriers 
and other postal employees get the 
support that they deserve. 
At the hearing we had last month in 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee, I was thor-
oughly impressed with each of these 
nominees and their knowledge of the 
needs of the Postal Service. All three 
nominees 
exhibited 
professionalism, 
the expertise, the leadership, and the 
commitment—the 
commitment—that 
we need at the Postal Service Board of 
Governors. Think of the Board of Gov-
ernors almost like a board of directors 
for a company. They don’t run the 
Postal Service every day, but they help 
set the tone, policies, and oversee the 
operations. 
Further, these three nominees agree 
that the Postal Service has tremendous 
opportunities ahead. The Postal Serv-
ice is currently in the midst of a once- 
in-a-lifetime update to the postal deliv-
ery vehicles, with a prime opportunity 
to be a leader in the fight against cli-
mate change. The Postal Service will 
replace up to 165,000 vehicles. 
So, every now and then, we see postal 
vehicles—probably every day. We prob-
ably look at them sometimes and say: 
That looks like an old vehicle. The rea-
son it looks like an old vehicle is be-
cause it is. Many of them are 25 years 
old. They run on gasoline. They run on 
diesel. They pollute, and they break 
down. We have an opportunity here to 
replace them with a new fleet of low- 
emission or no-emission vehicles pow-
ered by batteries and powered by hy-
drogen fuel cells. 
The nominees we are considering 
today and later this month also agree 
that the Postal Service has an obliga-
tion to work with Congress to enact 
important postal reform legislation 
which would help the agency save tens 
of billions of dollars over the next 10 
years. 
How might that happen? One, by bet-
ter 
integrating 
postal 
retirees’ 
healthcare with the Medicare Program 
and by repealing a burdensome retiree 
health benefit obligation that most 
other large companies don’t have to 
bear. 
I often refer to a saying made pop-
ular by Albert Einstein. I am not smart 
like Albert Einstein, but I am smart 
enough to quote Albert Einstein. Al-
bert Einstein used to say: ‘‘In adversity 
lies opportunity.’’ Think about that: 
‘‘In adversity lies opportunity.’’ 
The Bible says something like this: 
In all things, give thanks. 
I think it was Henry Ford who said: 
‘‘If you think you can or you think you 
can’t, you’re right.’’ 
But Einstein said: ‘‘In adversity lies 
opportunity.’’ The Postal Service has 
faced considerable adversity over the 
last decade or two. This has been per-
haps the most difficult stretch in its 
long and storied history. 
You know, the Postal Service is not 
an idea that somebody dreamed up 30, 
40, 50, or 60 years ago. It was originally 
outlined in the Constitution and the 
first Post Master General was a guy 
named Ben Franklin. After that storied 
history, we have an opportunity to face

the adversities the Postal Service faces 
today with an opportunity to confirm 
three 
well-qualified 
Postal 
Service 
Board of Governors to public service 
who will be ready on day one—not a 
month from now or a year from now, 
but on day one—to ensure that this in-
valuable institution is able to meet its 
vital mission. 
I am proud to support them. I am 
proud to say I know them, and I urge 
my colleagues to support them as 
well—two of them later today and an-
other one probably later this month. 
With that I yield the floor.

EAGLES ACT OF 2021 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today I would like to address the na-
tional plague of targeted violence. 
Whether it is in our schools, houses of 
worship, restaurants, businesses, or 
even on our city streets, these sense-
less killings are impacting all of us. 
I woke up Friday morning, April 16, 
to learn of another tragedy, this time 
in Indianapolis, where a 19-year-old 
walked into a private business and pro-
ceeded to kill eight innocent workers, 
including four members of the Sikh 
community. My heart breaks for an-
other set of families and friends newly 
devastated and the unthinkable hap-
pening to them. 
While it is still early in the inves-
tigation and an exact motive remains 
unclear, all signs indicate that that 
young killer suffered from mental ill-
ness. The killer’s own mother con-
tacted authorities just last May for 
fear that he was going to commit what 
she called ‘‘suicide by cop.’’ 
The date of April 16 is unfortunately 
significant, as it is the solemn anniver-
sary of the Virginia Tech massacre. 
Thirty-two students and educators lost 
their lives at the hands of a 23-year-old 
who had a well-documented record of 
mental illness. Despite clear homicidal 
warning signs, school authorities and 
counselors failed to intervene and help 
the troubled young man. 
Earlier this April, tragedy struck 
when a 25-year-old man rammed his ve-
hicle into a security barricade just 
steps from this Chamber. Fortunately 
for those inside, U.S. Capitol Police of-
ficers courageously intervened when 
the man brandished a large knife and 
lunged in their direction. As all of us 
know, this attacker tragically took the 
life of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Billy 
Evans. Officer Evans was a hero, and 
we mourn his loss. 
While the Capitol attacker’s exact 
motive is unknown, social media pro-
files indicate the man was a devout fol-
lower of a group that repeatedly holds 
racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ 
beliefs. It is too early to tell if these 
beliefs motivated this man to commit 
an act of terrorism, but what is clear is 
this man struggled with depression, 
hallucinations, and suicidal thoughts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2477 
May 12, 2021 
If someone had properly identified 
these symptoms as warning signs, per-
haps this tragedy could have been 
avoided. 
I could go on and highlight tragedies 
from just the past several years from 
all over the country. Post-incident in-
vestigations show that all of these vio-
lent actors often suffer from variations 
of mental health concerns, including 
depression, anxiety, delusions, para-
noia, bipolar disorder, suicidal and 
homicidal thoughts, and adherence to 
bizarre conspiracy theories. Many of 
those 
who 
are 
closest 
to 
these 
attackers were aware of their condi-
tions, and some even expressed concern 
about their propensity for violence 
ahead of their times of killing. 
The EAGLES Act of 2021 is a bipar-
tisan, commonsense piece of legisla-
tion. This bill carries the namesake of 
the Parkland, FL, Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School mascot—the Ea-
gles, that is—and it is a tribute to the 
17 Eagles who tragically lost their lives 
3 years ago at the hands of a former 
student struggling with severe behav-
ioral problems and mental illness. 
This legislation helps proactively 
mitigate threats of violence by reau-
thorizing as well as expanding the U.S. 
Secret Service’s National Threat As-
sessment Center, which also goes by 
the acronym NTAC. 
NTAC’s approach is squarely focused 
on research. After every instance of 
mass violence, their team of social 
science 
experts 
canvasses 
the 
cir-
cumstances and the attacker’s behav-
ior to determine the facts. 
NTAC’s 2019 publication called ‘‘Mass 
Attacks in Public Squares’’ found that 
during the previous year, 93 percent of 
the attackers engaged in threatening 
or concerning communications prior to 
carrying out violent actions. Another 
2019 NTAC study entitled ‘‘Protecting 
America’s Schools’’ made an even more 
definitive finding related to violence in 
our educational system. This study 
concluded that all—in other words, 
every one—of the school attackers ex-
hibited concerning behaviors prior to 
engaging in an act of violence. 
A family member, a teacher, a coach, 
a fellow employee, or a neighbor’s abil-
ity to observe someone’s behavior, 
home life circumstances, work life fac-
tors, and other political stressors, cou-
pled with NTAC’s threat assessment 
training, can prevent harmful out-
comes from occurring. But in order for 
this to be effective, we need to increase 
NTAC’s ability to continue their re-
search and get much needed training to 
their communities. The result will be 
increased opportunities for early inter-
vention and referrals to mental health 
services for those in need and also get 
names to the FBI database so that they 
can’t buy a gun. 
Just recently, the EAGLES Act got a 
resounding endorsement from the Na-
tional Association of Attorneys Gen-
eral. Forty attorneys general from all 
over the United States believe that 
NTAC’s proactive approach is critical 
to violence prevention and its training 
programs are urgently needed. These 
attorneys general are responsible for 
ensuring safe communities and are urg-
ing our quick action to pass this legis-
lation. We cannot afford to ignore or 
delay their explicit plea for assistance. 
So now, as a bottom line, I ask all of 
my Senate colleagues to consider the 
commonsense, practical solution pro-
vided in the EAGLES Act. The more 
research and threat assessment train-
ing that we can provide, the more vio-
lence we can prevent. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, I have come to the floor I think 
Monday, Tuesday, and today because 
this is National Police Week, to honor 
our men and women in blue. It started 
way back in 1962. Our Nation has annu-
ally celebrated the lives and memory 
of the men and women of law enforce-
ment who are killed in the line of duty. 
The origin of National Police Week 
goes back nearly 50 years to President 
John F. Kennedy’s proclamation that 
each May 15 be designated as ‘‘National 
Peace Officers Memorial Day.’’ Over 
the years, this single day has grown 
into a weeklong opportunity to honor 
the sacrifices of our law enforcement 
professionals throughout America. 
Normally, tens of thousands of police 
officers, deputy sheriffs, State troop-
ers, and others sworn to uphold the 
rule of law would have gathered here in 
our Nation’s Capital. They would be 
participating in a host of events that 
both honor their fallen colleagues and 
celebrate their comradery. Unfortu-
nately, the global virus pandemic con-
tinues to take its toll on nearly every 
aspect of life, with National Police 
Week events being no exception. It is 
very disappointing to lose the oppor-
tunity to celebrate, as we have every 
year before last year, our communities’ 
heroes in this public way. Maybe next 
year it will be back to normal. 
Rather 
than 
gathering 
in-person 
along the National Mall, this year’s 
events will include a virtual candle-
light vigil. On Thursday, May 13, 
Americans will come together online 
to pay tribute to our fallen protectors. 
The name of each man and woman who 
gave their last measure of devotion 
during the previous year will be read 
aloud. I encourage everyone to join me 
in honoring their sacrifice during this 
event. 
Despite the impact of COVID–19 and 
the risk to their individual safety, men 
and women of law enforcement con-
tinue to steadfastly uphold their oath 
to serve and to protect. 
Pandemic or not, the National Law 
Enforcement Memorial remains a focal 
point of National Police Week. It is 
here where cops come to remember 
their departed friends and honor those 
families of the lost ones. 
At the time of its dedication in 1991, 
the names of 12,000 local, State, and 
Federal law enforcement officers killed 
in the line of duty dating back to 1786 
were engraved onto that memorial. 
Each year, the curved stone walls are 
updated with the names of the recently 
fallen. Today, over 22,000 heroes are 
permanently venerated within those 
solemn 3 acres. 
In our own Declaration of Independ-
ence, our Founding Fathers spoke of 
certain unalienable rights endowed by 
our Creator. Those specifically men-
tioned were life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. None of these rights 
are possible without every citizen’s 
most basic level of security. 
While the United States has layers of 
safety built into our system of govern-
ment, none is more critical to our 
foundational rights than local law en-
forcement. Maintaining a free, safe, 
and civil society is squarely dependent 
on someone who is willing to answer 
the call without regard to time or cir-
cumstance and who puts themselves in 
harm’s way to ensure that the innocent 
are protected and the law is upheld. 
HONORING SERGEANT JIM SMITH 
This call to service was embodied by 
Sergeant Jim Smith of the Iowa State 
Patrol, who courageously gave his life 
on April 9, 2021. Sergeant Smith was 
tragically killed during an attempt to 
apprehend a violent suspect. 
Sergeant Smith, a 27-year-old Iowa 
State Patrol veteran and tactical team 
leader, put himself in harm’s way on 
behalf of his fellow Iowans last month, 
and it cost him everything. 
As his colleagues remembered Ser-
geant Smith during his memorial serv-
ice, he was described as a completely 
genuine man who loved his family and 
loved being a civil servant on behalf of 
his community. 
Sergeant Smith found his life’s pur-
pose as a dedicated law enforcement of-
ficer, and I know I speak for many 
Iowans when I say we are forever grate-
ful for his service. 
While I mourn the loss of Sergeant 
Smith, along with his family, fellow 
troopers, friends, and the entire Inde-
pendence, IA, community, I am pleased 
that his sacrifice will not be forgotten. 
His memory, along with the 306 officers 
we tragically lost in 2020, will live for-
ever, as their names will be inscribed 
on the stone walls of the National Law 
Enforcement 
Memorial. 
Iowans 
for 
generations to come will be able to 
visit 
Washington, 
find 
Sergeant 
Smith’s name, and be reminded of the 
high cost of preserving our precious 
rights. 
Earlier this week, I introduced a res-
olution to commemorate National Po-
lice Week. This resolution honors the 
brave men and women who put them-
selves in harm’s way to make their 
communities a safer place. As in years 
past, the measure has significant bipar-
tisan support and gives tribute to those 
who, despite knowing the inherent 
risk, chose to serve their fellow citi-
zens. Thank you to my many Senate 
colleagues who signed on as cosponsors 
to this resolution. 
In closing, I want to encourage ev-
eryone to visit the National Law En-
forcement Memorial. As you enter the

memorial grounds in Northwest DC, 
you pass a statue of an adult lion keep-
ing close watch over a pair of cubs. It 
is a telling illustration of the role un-
dertaken by our cops vigilantly defend-
ing us 24 hours a day. 
Underneath this statue is a quote 
from Vivian Eney Cross, the wife of 
fallen U.S. Capitol Police Sergeant 
Christopher Sherman Eney. The quote 
reads: 
It is not how these officers died that made 
them heroes, it is how they lived. 
Despite the uncertainties our Nation 
currently faces, I am sure of one thing: 
The sacrifices of American law enforce-
ment will never be forgotten. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize National Police 
Week and honor the law enforcement 
officers who selflessly serve and pro-
tect our communities. Law enforce-
ment professionals at all levels, from 
local police forces to sheriff’s depart-
ments, to State police and Federal law 
enforcement agencies, leave home each 
day not knowing what challenges they 
will experience, but they are ready to 
face danger head-on. 
National Police Week is a solemn oc-
casion to honor those who tragically 
lost their lives while performing their 
duties. Sadly, last year proved to be 
particularly dangerous for officers, and 
2020 was one of the deadliest years for 
law enforcement officers in recent 
memory. The COVID–19 pandemic cer-
tainly played a part in that unfortu-
nate reality. 
This year, the names of 394 officers 
killed in the line of duty have been 
etched into the walls of the National 
Law 
Enforcement 
Memorial. 
The 
deaths of 185 of those individuals were 
COVID–19 related, including Sergeant 
James Dancy of the North Little Rock 
Police Department. 
HONORING SERGEANT JAMES L. ‘‘BUCK’’ DANCY 
Sergeant Dancy was a 35-year-old 
veteran of the police force who helped 
mentor young officers at the depart-
ment. He contracted COVID–19 while 
performing his job. 
First responders like him were on the 
frontlines of the pandemic and kept 
going to work every day despite the 
risks to their own health. We are grate-
ful they did. Sergeant Dancy’s heroism 
and dedication are reminders that 
coronavirus took not only vulnerable 
populations but also dedicated public 
servants from us. 
We also reflect on the other heroes 
from Arkansas who lost their lives in 
the course of their service to their 
communities this past year. 
HONORING OFFICER TRAVIS WALLACE 
Officer Travis Wallace of the Helena- 
West Helena Police Department gave 
his life while attempting to apprehend 
a suspect wanted in connection with a 
violent crime. 
HONORING DETECTIVE KEVIN DWAINE COLLINS 
Pine Bluff Detective Kevin Collins 
had a lifelong dream to serve as a po-
lice officer. He made the ultimate sac-
rifice in the line of duty while con-
ducting an ongoing investigation. 
HONORING OFFICER BRENT WILLIAM PERRY 
SCRIMSHIRE 
Hot Springs Police Officer Corporal 
Brent Scrimshire had earned recogni-
tion as the Arkansas Southwest Region 
Officer of the Year in 2016. Sadly, he 
lost his life while conducting a traffic 
stop. 
We honor the service and sacrifice of 
these Arkansans and law enforcement 
officers all across the country who cou-
rageously gave their lives while up-
holding law and order. Their deaths are 
tragic and call us to acknowledge their 
tremendous heroism and selflessness. 
They also invite us to appreciate the 
reality that the stakes of this occupa-
tion are a lot higher than most others; 
they are life and death. The perilous 
nature of policing and law enforcement 
is something we simply can’t under-
estimate or fail to respect. 
I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate 
resolution marking National Police 
Week because we must always remem-
ber the brave officers whose lives are 
cut short because of their service and 
sacrifice. 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER TYLER FRANKS 
We also pray for the recovery of 
those injured in the line of duty, like 
Prairie Grove Police Officer Tyler 
Franks, who was shot while responding 
to a domestic disturbance call last 
week. Thankfully his condition is im-
proving, but we know he has a long 
road to recovery. 
By supporting policies to improve 
law 
enforcement 
training 
and 
re-
sources, we can recognize the dedica-
tion and heroism so often displayed by 
these public servants and help make 
them more effective and safer at the 
same time. 
Over the past year, we have wit-
nessed increased calls for defunding or 
abolishing police forces across the 
country. Instead of this misguided ap-
proach, we need to improve invest-
ments and resources for the men and 
women in blue. That is why it is impor-
tant that Congress fund programs like 
the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant 
Program, which has proven vital to 
helping States and local law enforce-
ment agencies purchase equipment and 
support much needed training for offi-
cers. 
We know there are more ways to en-
sure officers have the tools they need 
to enhance community safety and pro-
tect themselves so they can go home to 
the families they love and the support 
systems they rely on. That is why this 
week I will join Senators INHOFE, 
BROWN, and TILLIS to introduce the 
Law Enforcement Training for Mental 
Health Crisis Response Act. This legis-
lation will help provide police with bet-
ter strategies and procedures to re-
spond to calls involving a mental 
health crisis. 
We also need to hold all those who 
perpetrate attacks against law enforce-
ment accountable, so I urge my col-
leagues to pass the Protect and Serve 
Act. I am proud to support this legisla-
tion that will create Federal penalties 
for individuals who deliberately target 
local, State, or Federal law enforce-
ment officers with violence. 
On behalf of all Arkansans, I thank 
all of our law enforcement officers for 
making sacrifices to keep us safe. I will 
continue 
advocating 
for 
improved 
tools, resources, and training for offi-
cers so they can prepare for unpredict-
able circumstances. 
Our safety and peace of mind come at 
a cost, and our police officers need our 
support and our gratitude for being the 
first ones to pay it. We honor them this 
week and every week for what they do 
and for what they represent. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 136 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I rise 
here today, and I have been in the Sen-
ate a little over 21⁄2 years, and I never 
imagined that I would have to drift 
back to my days at Wabash College, as 
I migrated from a biology major to a 
political science major and, thank 
goodness, to an economics major. 
In that time, I never in my wildest 
dreams thought I would be able to talk 
about macroeconomics because back 
then there were a couple of points of 
view. You had Milton Friedman, who 
was a disciple of monetary theory— 
that if you get too much out there cir-
culating, your currency devalues and 
you get inflation. And then there was 
Keynes, who was a big disciple of the 
government, either through tax policy 
or spending. And, my goodness, how ei-
ther one of them would react to what 
we are contending with today, I think 
it would give them some pause in 
terms of where we are at. 
This has nothing to do with the un-
derlying policy goals. I am someone 
that comes from a State legislature in 
Indiana where we tackle things like in-
frastructure, defined there and then as 
roads and bridges. We came together. 
We actually paid for it through user 
fees, which we haven’t done here since 
1993. That is fuel taxes, which gen-
erally would be at least one thing you 
would look at when you want to spend 
a lot of money on infrastructure. 
So here we are today. We had a hear-
ing a couple of weeks ago, and I will

S2479 
May 12, 2021 
cite him in a moment. Robert Reich 
was in there, and I threw that question 
at him: How could we have come so far 
from Keynes’ economics and Milton 
Friedman, which has controlled the dy-
namic of this country, its monetary 
policy, and its fiscal policy, until just 
recently? 
Then comes along the Modern Mone-
tary Theory, a new approach to macro-
economics. This theory proposes that 
governments can spend however much 
they want, go into debt as much as 
they want, and have these structural 
trillion-dollar deficits that would work 
nowhere else. It only works now be-
cause we are the only reserve currency. 
Being the only reserve currency, people 
come to us with their currencies, and 
that keeps our interest rates down. 
That doesn’t acknowledge that there 
are places like China, which will be a 
larger economy than ours and lends us 
money currently. 
In places like China and most other 
places across the world—unless you 
were Greece, Italy, maybe Spain and 
Portugal, which kept the euro from 
being a prominent currency because 
they lived beyond their means—you 
cannot, just because you can get by 
with it in the short run, continue to do 
things into the mid and long term 
without consequences. 
This fanciful theory has found its 
way out of the faculty lounge and into 
the halls of Congress. Considering that 
President Biden has proposed another 
$4 trillion in spending. There is $1.9 
trillion that we have recently done—a 
done deal—borrowing every penny of it. 
We have not raised taxes. That is a 
false argument too. With the amount 
of taxes that you could raise, you 
wouldn’t even cover part of our day-to- 
day trillion-dollar deficit. It adds to 
our debt. 
When I got here, I think it was 
around $20 trillion. Soon it is going to 
be over $30 trillion. And listen to this: 
World War II was the highest debt we 
ever had as a country. We were savers 
and investors then. Now we are con-
sumers and spenders. They paid that 
off. We had basically no debt until the 
wars came along that we financed by 
borrowing, not paying for it. Then, 2008 
and 2009 came along, and that looks 
like chump change compared to what 
we are doing now. 
Now we had an approach to one of the 
biggest challenges we have ever had as 
a country, navigating through COVID, 
and of course we did things that basi-
cally needed some new idea how to jus-
tify it—Modern Monetary Theory. It is 
a recipe for hyperinflation and contin-
ued higher deficits. By the way, the 
trillion-dollar 
deficit 
without 
any 
COVID, just in its own momentum for-
ward, is going to be $1.5 trillion in 4 to 
5 years. 
I am not surprised the big spenders in 
DC have latched on to a theory that 
tells them it is OK to spend irrespon-
sibly and hike taxes. They may not ac-
knowledge that pre-COVID we were in 
a pretty good place. We were raising 
wages. Senator SANDERS and I would 
share that. We need to raise wages in 
places, but you can’t do it through the 
government. That is not the productive 
economy. Everything that the govern-
ment gets comes from the productive 
economy. 
I am surprised there has not been 
more pushback because it is a flawed 
economic theory. When I asked Robert 
Reich about it, he dismissed it: Well, it 
is too new. It is too novel. I can’t real-
ly talk about it. 
That shouldn’t be the foundation 
upon which you are having your spend-
ing plans laid out currently. 
What it is, in my opinion, is a bunch 
of malarkey that is embraced because 
we want to spend like drunken sailors. 
Coming through a crisis, we can’t do 
that. We have already done that. What 
we did in a bipartisan fashion in 2020 
probably made sense. Continuing that 
forward, you can’t base it upon this 
new idea that debt, deficits don’t make 
any difference. It is kind of like a kid 
coming up with a modern dietary the-
ory that says it is OK to eat cookies for 
every meal. It wouldn’t work. 
Many noted economists from across 
the political spectrum have warned 
that the implementation of the Modern 
Monetary Theory will pose a danger to 
the economy, and this wouldn’t be cen-
ter and right economists. Let’s listen 
to a few of them. 
The Secretary of the Treasury and 
Director of the National Economic 
Council, Lawrence Summers, back in 
the Clinton years, and Federal Reserve 
Chair Jerome Powell, who has been OK 
with accommodating some of it—he 
said that is not a new theory that you 
can rely upon. Even Paul Krugman, 
whom we know that generally he would 
be eating this up, he has reservations, 
and not to mention a host of others. I 
just told you what Robert Reich said 
when he dismissed it as something too 
new to comment on. 
Now, Secretary Janet Yellen dis-
cussed Modern Monetary Theory’s idea 
that interest rate payments can be 
handled by the central bank buying the 
debt back in 2019, calling it ‘‘a very 
wrong-minded theory because that’s 
how you get hyper-inflation.’’ 
Joel Griffith, a research fellow at the 
Heritage Foundation, summed it up 
well when he wrote: 
There is no free lunch. We will pay either 
through the visible burden of direct tax-
ation, the hidden tax of inflation, or higher 
borrowing costs. 
I said earlier that we are the only re-
serve 
currency. 
Interest 
rates 
are 
starting to go up. The Chinese could do 
things that could knock interest rates 
up two to three points quickly if they 
decided to take a different point of 
view. There is a lot of danger in living 
in the moment because you don’t feel 
any of the pain that will inevitably 
come in the future, and it is not far 
out. 
The acceptance of Modern Monetary 
Theory would lead to higher deficits 
and higher inflation. The underlying 
policy in terms of higher wages, trying 
to do things to improve the lot of 
Americans, that is fair game for discus-
sion. Just don’t mislead them, putting 
all that debt on our kids and our 
grandkids. That would be like running 
a business, running it into the ditch, 
going to your banker, and thinking 
that you could get a loan. You would 
be laughed out of the office if you tried 
to do it 2 years in a row. That is now 
standard operating procedure with tril-
lion-dollar deficits built into the sys-
tem, not to mention this. 
The Senate must abandon this fun-
damentally flawed, irresponsible eco-
nomic model in favor of mainstream 
fiscal and monetary frameworks that 
work everywhere else. The European 
Union, a recent example, headed to be 
a reserve currency, and even Greece, 
Spain, Portugal and Italy have found 
that they can’t do that and get by with 
it. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs be discharged from 
further consideration and the Senate 
now proceed to S. Res. 136. I further 
ask that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I find this 
resolution somewhat odd, if I may say 
so. There are enormous crises facing 
our country and the world. The fact 
that we are spending time on the floor 
of the Senate to condemn a proposition 
or a theory does not seem to me to be 
the best way to be spending our time. 
And the implication—and I think the 
Senator from Indiana made this impli-
cation—that 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United States is objecting to raising 
taxes is simply not factual. 
The President has come forward with 
some very specific tax proposals, but 
his proposals are not meeting much 
support on the other side of the aisle 
because he is saying that he doesn’t 
want to raise taxes on anybody in this 
country earning less than $400,000 a 
year, but he does want to raise taxes on 
some of the wealthiest people in Amer-
ica and some of the largest corpora-
tions that today may be paying zero in 
Federal income tax. And he shares a 
concern that many of us share and that 
Warren Buffet reminds us of, that the 
effective tax rate for the billionaire 
class is actually lower than it is for 
working families. 
The President’s view, which I share, 
is that this Congress must address the 
enormous crises facing working fami-
lies, and that is rebuilding our crum-
bling infrastructure, making sure that 
our kids have quality childcare and 
pre-K, that we have to address the exis-
tential threat of climate change, and 
we have to address many of the other 
problems facing working families, and 
one way we do that is demanding that

the wealthy pay their fair share of 
taxes. 
When we talk about resolutions con-
demning something—I am not, again, 
sure why we are condemning a par-
ticular theory—we might be today 
thinking about condemning the actions 
of the Republican Party in the House 
of Representatives today. They got rid 
of a Member of their leadership for the 
crime of suggesting that that party 
should not maintain a big lie implying 
that Donald Trump won the election. 
Shall we condemn that? I think that is 
worth condemning. 
I think we might want to condemn 
the fact that we have more income and 
wealth inequality today in America 
than at any time since the 1920s. Let’s 
condemn that. Maybe we want to con-
demn the fact that every scientist who 
has studied the issue tells us that cli-
mate change is a threat to our Nation 
and the world, and we have done vir-
tually nothing to lead the world in ad-
dressing climate change. Let’s con-
demn that inaction. 
Let’s condemn the fact that in the 
richest country in the history of the 
world, we have the highest rate of 
childhood poverty of almost any major 
country on Earth. How about con-
demning that? 
Let’s condemn the fact, maybe, that 
half of our people are living paycheck 
to paycheck. Let’s condemn the fact 
that we live in a country which has in-
stitutional racism. 
We can go on and on. There are a lot 
of things to condemn, but I don’t know 
that it is in the best interest of the 
U.S. Senate to be condemning a par-
ticular economic theory. 
You don’t like it, argue against it. 
That is fine. But I don’t know that we 
have to spend our time condemning it. 
So with that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. So I don’t disagree with 
what Senator SANDERS said in terms of 
policy that needs to be debated, but a 
classic tactic when you are focusing on 
how you are going to pay for some-
thing is to change the subject. And 
whatever you think about what hap-
pened over in the House of Representa-
tives, whatever you think about the 
other issues, this is about being honest 
with future generations and where has 
that worked and been a good end re-
sult. 
When it comes to some of the tax-
ation part of it, that is a smokescreen 
because even if you raise all the rev-
enue they are talking about with those 
taxes—and I am a believer that cor-
porations should pay their fair share. 
Multinationals that flatten their tax 
rate, that is different from many C 
corps, many corporations. But the dis-
honesty in that argument is that you 
couldn’t cover even 20 percent of our 
existing structural deficit. So you need 
to be honest. 
If you want to do this, ask your kids, 
ask your grandkids if they are willing 
to put that burden on them. And there 
is no theory out there, other than this 
which is being used as a current ration-
alization, that would make that ever 
have a pleasant outcome. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, if I 
could respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. I am not sure—the 
Senator from Indiana suggested a mo-
ment ago that the President was not 
interested in raising taxes, and, of 
course, he has a very specific proposal 
to raise taxes. 
And I would suggest to my colleague 
from Indiana that if we want to talk 
about the burden on our kids and on 
our grandchildren as a result of the na-
tional debt, maybe we should also be 
discussing the fact that, under the last 
administration, a massive tax break 
was given to the very wealthiest people 
in this country and the largest cor-
porations. We were told that that tax 
plan would pay for itself, but, in fact, 
it will result in almost $2 trillion in ad-
ditional national debt, and virtually all 
of those benefits went to the people on 
top. 
So all that I am saying is, we can 
argue taxation; we can argue economic 
policy; we can argue why we are the 
only major country on Earth not to 
guarantee healthcare to all people; we 
can argue why we are paying, by far, 
the highest prices in the world for pre-
scription drugs; we can argue why we 
have a political system that allows bil-
lionaires to buy elections—a lot of 
things that we could be talking about, 
but I am not sure that it is in the best 
interest of the Senate to be con-
demning a particular economic idea 
that some economists have brought up. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. I know we have a vote 
coming up, and I won’t belabor it. 
I think the basis for maybe a good 
conversation, because we are not going 
to solve it today, is when it comes to 
the tax package that was put through 
in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017— 
and I would have some authority on 
this, Senator SANDERS. I spent 37 years 
in the trenches running a small busi-
ness that ended up being a larger com-
pany. Three of my kids run it with a 
good young executive team—the Amer-
ican dream. And my observation was 
that we had kind of hit the sweet spot. 
And the CBO, which actually put 
that original cost of $1.5 trillion—$150 
billion per year, over 10 years—said 
that 
we 
were 
actually 
generating 
record revenues pre-COVID and that 
they could have revised, and still 
might, that trajectory. 
I think if we are going to go forward, 
you have to realize that there is a limit 
to anything you can do through gov-
ernment. And when you try to raise 
taxes, you have to be honest about it. 
Over 50 years, regardless of what the 
tax rate has been, the economy has 
generated about 17 percent of our GDP 
with tax revenues because when they 
are high, there is less economic activ-
ity. You actually find a sweet spot, 
like we did with the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act of 2017, and the economy was prov-
ing it pre-COVID.

MEMORIAL DAY 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay special tribute to the 
veterans throughout Michigan’s his-
tory who have given their lives while 
serving our country. Whether they 
served in the Civil War or the Korean 
war, in the Middle East or the South 
Pacific, we owe these heroes so much. 
Aleda E. Lutz is one of those heroes. 
She grew up in a large family; she was 
the youngest of 10 children—and her 
parents were immigrants from Ger-
many. She graduated from Arthur Hill 
High School in Saginaw and the Sagi-
naw General Hospital School of Nurs-
ing. When World War II broke out, Lutz 
felt called to serve her Nation. 
She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps 
in 1942 and began working as a general 
duty nurse at Selfridge Field. When she 
had the opportunity to become a flight 
nurse, she signed up. It wasn’t easy; it 
required a lot of training. But Lutz, 
known as ‘‘Lutzy’’ to her friends, was 
smart, determined, and extraordinarily 
brave. She made the cut and joined the 
elite 2 percent of World War II nurses 
qualified as flight nurses. She was pro-
moted to first lieutenant and trans-
ferred to the 802nd Medical Air Evacu-
ation Transport Squadron, which soon 
deployed to North Africa. 
Lutz transported more than 3,500 pa-
tients from the frontlines while earn-
ing six battle stars. She was known for 
her professional skill and her courage 
under fire. During her 196th mission, 
her C–47 plane crashed while carrying 
15 wounded soldiers. There were no sur-
vivors. Lutz is known to be the first 
military woman to die in a combat 
zone during World War II. 
Lutz is one of the most highly deco-
rated women in American military his-
tory. She was awarded the Distin-
guished Flying Cross, the Air Medal 
with four Oak Leaf Clusters, and the 
Purple Heart. An 800-patient hospital 
ship was named in her honor, as was a 
C–47 cargo plane. And in 1990, the Sagi-
naw veterans hospital, long known by 
her name, was officially rededicated as 
the Aleda E. Lutz Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Medical Center. It re-
mains a fitting memorial to honor a 
nurse who gave her life while serving 
her country. 
Not all veterans have had to give as 
much for their country as Aleda Lutz 
did, but all of them are willing to. It is 
what sets them apart. It is what makes 
them heroes. 
This Memorial Day, we honor 1LT. 
Aleda E. Lutz and all of the Michigan

Congress that, because the pilot program is 
limited with respect to scope and resources, 
communities that participate in the pilot 
program should acknowledge that the most 
successful efforts to mitigate the effects of 
urban flooding— 
(1) take a structural-based mitigation ap-
proach with respect to construction, which 
includes— 
(A) recognizing any post-storm damage 
that may occur; and 
(B) pursuing designs that proactively mini-
mize future flood damage; 
(2) make individuals in the community 
aware, through any cost-effective and avail-
able means of education, of the best ap-
proaches regarding the construction of prop-
erties that are able to survive floods, which 
reduces the cost of future repairs; and 
(3) encourage home and property owners to 
consider the measures described in para-
graphs (1) and (2), which are the most cost-

By Mr. TUBERVILLE (for him-
self, 
Mr. 
TILLIS, 
and 
Mr. 
ROUNDS): 
S. 1582. A bill to provide for enhanced 
Federal enforcement of, and State and 
local assistance in the enforcement of, 
the immigration laws of the United 
States, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I 
join my colleagues today during Police 
Week to honor the work of our Na-
tion’s law enforcement officers. 
Being a law enforcement officer is 
one of the toughest jobs that there is, 
but it is also foundational to a func-
tioning society. We rely on these brave 
men and women to protect and serve 
our country every day. 
Unfortunately, 
many 
officers 
are 
being driven out by a wave of anti-po-
lice rhetoric on the heels of bad actors 
who operated outside of their training. 
We need to have trust between law en-
forcement and citizens. Without it, our 
society frays and decays. 
Over the course of this week, my col-
leagues are sharing many stories of law 
enforcement officers stepping up to 
help their fellow citizens in times of 
need and build trust with the commu-
nities that they serve. 
We are lucky to have many brave and 
honorable officers in Alabama and 
around this country. 
I 
think 
about 
Officer 
Jonathan 
Espino from the Decatur Police De-
partment. Last year, Officer Espino re-
sponded to a medical call. A man was 
trying to bring his mom back to life, 
trying to perform CPR. Officer Espino 
took over for the man after he arrived 
and began CPR. Just before medical 
personnel arrived, the woman’s heart 
started beating again, and she was 
gasping for air. He saved her life. 
I think of Officer Wesley Harrison 
from the Abbeville Police Department. 
Officer Harrison received a call that a 
woman was in a burning building. Offi-
cer Harrison arrived on the scene min-
utes later and was able to carry the el-
derly woman out of the structure, with 
the help of another investigator. 
These police officers went above and 
beyond the call of duty, and lives were 
saved because of their heroism. But we 
know such an important job comes 
with great risk. Just last week, Ala-
bama honored the 11 law enforcement 
officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice 
the last 2 years. In the last 2 days alone 
across the United States of America, 
four law enforcement officers have 
been killed. We are forever grateful to 
each of these officers who have laid 
down their lives in service for their 
community. 
How would you like to every day 
wake up, put a uniform on, a badge on 
your chest, a gun on your side, leave 
your family, walk out the door, know-
ing it might be the last time you ever 
walk into that home or see your fam-
ily? That is what happens to these law 
enforcement officers every day of their 
career, which is why I firmly believe 
we need more support for law enforce-
ment, not less. 
They need more training so they can 
be better at handling difficult situa-
tions. This is especially true as we see 
an uptick in mental health issues all 
across this country. They need tar-
geted resources so they can recruit the 
best and brightest for these important 
roles in the community and across our 
country. Let’s invest in the resources 
that they can ensure all law enforce-
ment officers are a true force for good 
for all people across their State and 
across this country. 
Part of keeping communities safe is 
making sure our law enforcement offi-
cers have the authority they need to 
enforce compliance with our current 
laws. This is especially necessary as we 
see a flood of immigrants coming into 
our country illegally. 
Right now, unless State and local law 
enforcement agencies have an agree-
ment with Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, if an officer encounters 
an illegal alien in the course of per-
forming their normal duties in their 
hometowns, they cannot arrest or de-
tain that individual for immigration 
purposes. 
Right now, ICE arrests are low, even 
while illegal border crossings are his-
torically high. Under President Biden’s 
enforcement of our immigration laws, 
which has fallen dramatically, arrests 
by ICE for the last 4 months have fall-
en 66 percent. Under the Biden admin-
istration, ICE has released at least 
3,700 inmates. Alarmingly, 1,800 of 
those were charged or convicted of 
crimes including homicide, rape, as-
sault, child abuse, and more. Secretary 
Mayorkas recently limited the places 
where ICE and CBP can enforce the 
law. Many Federal law enforcement of-
ficers fear that the Biden administra-
tion will further restrict where they 
can do their jobs. 
If the Federal Government will not 
enforce the immigration laws, our 
State and local law enforcement should 
be empowered to do so. That is why 
today I introduced the Empowering 
Law Enforcement Act, which grants in-
herent authority to State and local of-
ficials to enforce our Nation’s immi-
gration laws. 
Additionally, my bill will give Fed-
eral authorities the flexibility to ex-
tend the amount of time they can de-
tain criminal aliens. If a State or local 
law enforcement entity is detaining an 
alien, this bill would require Homeland 
Security to take that illegal alien into 
custody upon request from that entity. 
The bill ensures that State and local 
authorities can get reimbursed for the 
cost related to the incarceration and 
transportation of the alien. 
The Empowering Law Enforcement 
Act is about common sense. If the 
Biden administration won’t enforce the 
law, let’s empower those who will. I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
practical solution to a very real and 
very serious problem.

lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 208 
Whereas, 
beginning 
in 
1991, 
National 
Nurses Week is celebrated annually from 
May 6, also known as ‘‘National Recognition 
Day for Nurses’’, through May 12, the birth-
day of Florence Nightingale, the founder of 
modern nursing; 
Whereas National Nurses Week is a time of 
year to reflect on the important contribu-
tions that nurses make to provide safe, high- 
quality health care; 
Whereas nurses serve on the front lines, 
risking their lives treating the injured and 
sick during wartime, natural disasters, and 
public health emergencies, including the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas nurses are known to be patient 
advocates, acting to protect the lives of indi-
viduals under their care; 
Whereas nurses represent the largest single 
component of the health care profession, 
with an estimated population of more than 
4,000,000 registered nurses in the United 
States; 
Whereas nurses are leading in the delivery 
of quality care in a transformed health care 
system that improves patient outcomes and 
safety; 
Whereas the Future of Nursing report of 
the Institute of Medicine has called for the 
nursing profession to meet the call for lead-
ership in a team-based delivery model; 
Whereas, when nurse staffing levels in-
crease, the risk of patient complications and 
lengthy hospital stays decreases, resulting in 
cost savings; 
Whereas nurses are experienced research-
ers, and the work of nurses encompasses a 
wide scope of scientific inquiry, including 
clinical research, health systems and out-
comes research, and nursing education re-
search; 
Whereas nurses provide care that is sen-
sitive to the cultures and customs of individ-
uals across the United States; 
Whereas nurses are well-positioned to pro-
vide leadership to eliminate health care dis-
parities that exist in the United States; 
Whereas nurses are the cornerstone of the 
public 
health 
infrastructure, 
promoting 
healthy lifestyles and educating commu-
nities on disease prevention and health pro-
motion; 
Whereas nurses help inform and educate, 
and work closely with, legislators to im-
prove— 
(1) the education, retention, recruitment, 
and practice of all nurses; and 
(2) the health and safety of the patients for 
whom the nurses care; 
Whereas there is a need— 
(1) to strengthen nursing workforce devel-
opment programs at all levels, including the 
number of doctorally prepared faculty mem-
bers; and

Whereas nurses touch the lives of the peo-
ple of the United States through every stage 
of life; and 
Whereas nursing has been voted the most 
honest and ethical profession in the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Nurses Week, as founded by the Amer-
ican Nurses Association; 
(2) recognizes the significant contributions 
of nurses to the health care system in the 
United States; and

Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms.

lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 209 
Whereas doulas can play an important role 
in— 
(1) maternal care; and 
(2) addressing maternal mortality and mor-
bidity in the United States; 
Whereas doula support includes continuous 
non-clinical 1-on-1 emotional, physical, and 
informational support around the time of 
birth, 
including 
during 
pregnancy 
and 
postpartum; 
Whereas doulas empower mothers with in-
formation about pregnancy and childbirth; 
Whereas studies have shown that doula-as-
sisted mothers are 4 times less likely to have 
a low birth weight baby, and 2 times less 
likely to experience complications during 
pregnancy; 
Whereas research indicates that, with the 
support of doulas, women are— 
(1) more likely to have vaginal births; and 
(2) less likely to require epidural anes-
thesia; 
Whereas, in 2013, the Expert Panel on Im-
proving Maternal and Infant Health Out-
comes in Medicaid and the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program of the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services identified pro-
viding coverage for continuous doula support 
during labor as a potential strategy to en-
hance maternal and infant care manage-
ment; 
Whereas the presence of a doula during 
pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum helps 
foster shared decision-making for birthing 
women by facilitating communication be-
tween women and their providers; 
Whereas a doula provides continuous sup-
port during labor and delivery and can alert 
hospital staff to signs and symptoms of com-
plications that require immediate medical 
attention, thus lowering the risk of esca-
lating complications for the mother and 
baby; 
Whereas access to doula support services, 
especially in underserved communities, may 
contribute to— 
(1) improved birth outcomes, both phys-
ically and emotionally; and 
(2) lower health care costs by reducing the 
risk of— 
(A) low birth weight babies; 
(B) complications that might otherwise 
go unnoticed; 
(C) low-risk cesarean deliveries; and 
(D) epidural anesthesia; 
Whereas training members of underserved 
communities to become doulas and support 
mothers in their own communities can— 
(1) help provide employment opportunities 
for improving maternal health; and 
(2) build trust and reduce adverse con-
sequences of racial bias for pregnant and 
postpartum women of color; and 
Whereas 
community-based 
maternal 
health care models, including doula support 
services, in collaboration with obstetrical 
care, show great promise in improving, and 
reducing disparities in, maternal health out-
comes: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the important role of doulas 
in providing respectful, responsive care to all 
women, including women in underserved 
communities who lack access to maternal 
health services; 
(2) acknowledges that doula support serv-
ices provide continuous physical and emo-
tional support to help mothers achieve 
healthy pregnancies and safe deliveries and 
recoveries; 
(3) urges greater recognition for the impor-
tant role that doulas play in— 
(A) supporting improved pregnancy, birth, 
and postpartum outcomes, including mater-
nal mental health; 
(B) reducing health care costs and working 
towards the elimination of health dispari-
ties; and 
(C) overcoming barriers for assisting low- 
income women of color and women in rural 
areas with access to health and social sup-
ports; 
(4) designates the week beginning May 9, 
2021, as ‘‘Doula Week’’ to raise awareness for, 
and advocate for the benefits of, doulas and 
the support services doulas provide; and 
(5) recognizes the importance of access to

Mr. 
GRAHAM 
(for 
himself, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, Mr. KELLY, Mr. COONS, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. RUBIO, and 
Mr. WARNOCK) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 210 
Whereas approximately 13,000 new cases of 
glioblastoma will be diagnosed in the United 
States in 2021; 
Whereas glioblastoma is— 
(1) the most common malignant, cancerous 
brain tumor, accounting for approximately 
half of all primary malignant brain tumors; 
and 
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult 
to treat, and deadly type of brain tumor; 
Whereas it is estimated that more than 
10,000 individuals in the United States will 
succumb to glioblastoma every year; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glio-
blastoma patients is only 7.2 percent and the 
median length of survival for glioblastoma 
patients is only 8 months; 
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a dis-
ease that affects the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the 
treatment and removal of glioblastoma pre-
sents significant challenges due to the 
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the 
brain, the primary organ in the human body 
that controls not only cognitive ability but 
also the actions of every organ and limb; 
Whereas, relative to other types of cancers, 
brain cancer has— 
(1) the highest per-patient initial cost of 
care, with an annualized mean net cost of 
care approaching $150,000; and 
(2) the highest annualized mean net costs 
for last-year-of-life care, with a cost of be-
tween $135,000 and $210,000 per patient, de-
pending on the age and gender of a patient; 
Whereas, although research advances may 
fuel the development of new treatments for 
glioblastoma, challenging obstacles to accel-
erating progress toward new treatments for 
glioblastoma remain and there are no screen-
ing or early detection methods; 
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first 
described in medical and scientific literature 
in the 1920s, and despite its devastating prog-
nosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device have 
been approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration to treat glioblastoma since the 
1920s and the mortality rates associated with 
glioblastoma have changed little during the 
past 30 years; 
Whereas, as a promising first step since the 
first Glioblastoma Awareness Day, the Na-
tional Cancer Institute established the Glio-
blastoma Therapeutics Network (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘GTN’’) in 2020, as part of 
a national infrastructure to enhance and 
support the discovery and development of 
glioblastoma 
therapies, 
with 
an 
initial 
$6,000,000 available for multi-institutional 
GTN teams to drive therapeutic agents 
through pre-clinical studies and early-phase 
clinical trials necessary to rapidly evaluate 
potential treatments to advance toward 
cures and improved quality of life; and 
Whereas there is a need for greater public 
awareness of glioblastoma, including aware-
ness of both— 
(1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glio-
blastoma patients; and 
(2) the opportunities for research and 
treatment advances for glioblastoma: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 21, 2021, as ‘‘Glio-
blastoma Awareness Day’’; 
(2) encourages increased public awareness 
of glioblastoma; 
(3) honors the individuals who have lost 
their lives to glioblastoma, a devastating 
disease, or are currently living with it; 
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the 
long-term prognosis and quality of life of in-
dividuals diagnosed with the disease; 
(5) expresses its support for the individuals 
who are battling brain tumors, as well as the 
families, friends, and caregivers of those in-
dividuals; 
(6) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
tumor research, which is a promising means 
of advancing the understanding and treat-
ment of glioblastoma; and 
(7) encourages continued investments in 
glioblastoma research and treatments, in-
cluding through the Glioblastoma Thera-
peutics Network and other existing brain 
tumor research resources.

Whereas the week of May 2 through May 8, 
2021, has been designated as ‘‘Public Service 
Recognition Week’’ to honor employees of 
the Federal Government and State and local 
governments and members of the uniformed 
services; 
Whereas millions of public servants have 
worked and continue to work to help the 
United States overcome the challenges from 
the COVID–19 pandemic, allowing essential 
services to continue and playing a critical 
role in protecting public health and safety; 
Whereas Public Service Recognition Week

lic servants and to honor the diverse men 
and women who meet the needs of the United

Whereas millions of individuals work in 
government service and as members of the

RECOGNIZING THE NINTH SUMMIT 
OF 
THE 
AMERICAS 
AND 
RE-
AFFIRMING 
THE 
COMMITMENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES TO A 
MORE 
PROSPEROUS, 
SECURE, 
AND 
DEMOCRATIC 
WESTERN 
HEMISPHERE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 28, S. Res. 120. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the resolu-
tion by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 120) recognizing the 
Ninth Summit of the Americas and reaffirm-
ing the commitment of the United States to 
a more prosperous, secure, and democratic 
Western Hemisphere. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the resolution, which had been 
reported from the Committee on For-
eign Relations without amendment, 
and with an amendment to the pre-
amble as follows: 
Whereas the United States has pursued mul-
tiple collaborative initiatives to advance the re-
gion’s enduring and shared interest in a more 
secure, prosperous, and democratic Western 
Hemisphere; 
Whereas the United States will host the Ninth 
Summit of the Americas for the first time since 
it hosted the inaugural Summit in Miami, Flor-
ida in 1994; 
Whereas, since 1994, the Summit of the Amer-
icas is a valuable forum for democratically elect-
ed heads of state and governments of the West-
ern Hemisphere to discuss common policy issues, 
affirm shared values, and commit to concerted 
actions at the national and regional level to ad-
dress the novel and existing challenges facing 
the Americas; 
Whereas the First and Second Summits of the 
Americas advanced commitments to lower trade 
barriers, improve transparency and market ac-
cess, and facilitate economic integration, and, 
following those Summits, the United States has 
signed free trade agreements with 12 of the 35 
countries in the region; 
Whereas, 
since 
2018, 
Argentina, 
Bolivia, 
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Repub-
lic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, 
Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, Suriname, and 
Uruguay have signed Memorandums of Under-
standing with the United States under the 
America Crece Program to leverage private in-
vestment in energy and infrastructure projects 
and advance economic prosperity, security, and 
good governance; 
Whereas, during the 2018 Summit of the Amer-
icas, the United States announced additional 
humanitarian assistance for Venezuelans who 
have fled their country as a result of the polit-
ical, economic, and security crises created by the 
regime of Nicola´s Maduro, including support for 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees (UNHCR) response to assist Venezuelan 
refugees in Colombia and Brazil; 
Whereas Transnational Criminal Organiza-
tions (TCOs) and their involvement in money 
laundering and the trafficking of people, nar-
cotics, and weapons in the region pose complex 
transnational threats to United States public 
health and national security, as well as the sta-
bility of the Americas, by undermining citizen 
security, basic human rights, the rule of law, 
good governance, and economic development; 
Whereas the United States has sought to im-
prove regional security through friendly and 
sustained relationships that build interoper-
ability, readiness, and capability with regional 
security partners, including through programs 
such as Plan Colombia, the Merida Initiative, 
the Central America Regional Security Initiative 
(CARSI), and the Caribbean Basin Initiative 
(CBI); 
Whereas the pandemic caused by coronavirus 
disease 2019 (commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID– 
19’’) has had devastating health and socio-
economic consequences for the states and peo-
ples of the Americas that have— 
(1) overwhelmed health systems; 
(2) led to the worsening of economic condi-
tions and contraction of gross domestic product 
per capita; 
(3) led to an increase in unemployment, espe-
cially for individuals working in small- and me-
dium-size businesses and large informal sectors 
across the region, and a rise in the number of 
people living in poverty; and 
(4) created conditions that have strengthened 
the illicit activities of criminal organizations; 
Whereas the United States Government re-
mains deeply concerned about the negative, 
often predatory effects of China’s growing polit-
ical, economic, military, and technological influ-
ence throughout the region, including signifi-
cant illegal, unreported, and unregulated fish-
ing activities in the Southern Atlantic Ocean 
and Eastern Pacific Ocean and opaque infra-
structure investments that impose unsustainable 
financial burdens on recipient countries, enable 
corruption, and undermine good governance; 
Whereas the United States Government is 
deeply concerned about the Government of the 
Russian Federation’s employment of a wide 
array of diplomatic, military, intelligence, cyber, 
misinformation, and commercial tools to under-
mine democratic systems in the region, including 
through its deepening political, economic, and 
security support for the Maduro regime in Ven-
ezuela; 
Whereas the United States Government is 
deeply concerned about efforts by the Govern-
ment of Iran to expand its political, economic, 
and security presence in the region, including 
through its deepening ties with the Maduro re-
gime in Venezuela; 
Whereas the regimes of Nicola´s Maduro in 
Venezuela, Miguel Dı´az-Canel in Cuba, and 
Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, have systemati-
cally eroded democratic institutions, commit 
widespread human rights violations, draw les-
sons from one another to sharpen state-spon-
sored repression and internal control mecha-
nisms, and receive the support of malign state 
and non-state actors, which pose a challenge to 
United States national security and national in-
terests; 
Whereas entrenched corruption, linkages be-
tween transnational criminal organizations and 
political actors, and the harassment and murder 
of journalists, human rights defenders, environ-
mental activists, and civil society leaders in 
Latin America and the Caribbean weaken citi-
zens’ confidence in democracy and negatively 
affect United States national interests; and 
Whereas weak rule of law, elevated levels of 
criminal violence, and systemic corruption in El 
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras fuel irreg-
ular migration that affects regional stability: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the occasion of the 
United States hosting the Ninth Summit of 
the Americas; 
(2) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to promote economic pros-
perity, security, and democratic governance 
throughout the Americas; and 
(3) calls on the President to lead a strong 
and coordinated diplomatic effort during the 
Summit process to ensure the Ninth Summit 
of the Americas— 
(A) strengthens democratic governance by 
building on the 2018 Lima Commitment to— 
(i) reduce bureaucracy; 
(ii) strengthen the independence of judi-
ciaries;

responses.

NOMINATION OF AMBER FAYE 
MCREYNOLDS 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want-
ed to come to the floor tonight to 
spend just a few minutes to speak 
about Amber McReynolds, President 
Biden’s nominee to serve on the Board 
of Governors of the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice. 
Everyone in America relies on the 
Postal Service, but hardly anyone 
knows about the Board of Governors 
and how much it matters to all of us. 
The Board sets the policies for the 
Postal Service. It directs its budget 
and reviews its practices. It also se-
lects the Postmaster General. 
But the Board’s most important job 
is to represent the public interest, not 
special interests, and to help manage

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2497 
May 12, 2021 
the Postal Service in a way that is 
competent, 
professional, 
and 
com-
pletely nonpartisan. That matters for a 
lot of reasons, but one of the most im-
portant is the critical and growing role 
that the post office plays in our democ-
racy. 
Over the past year, States all across 
the country followed our example in 
Colorado by giving people the freedom 
to vote by mail. As we have learned in 
my State, the case for voting by mail 
is overwhelming. It is more convenient. 
It is more accessible. It costs a lot less 
to administer and, during a pandemic, 
it is a lot safer than voting in person. 
But it only works if people have con-
fidence that the post office can deliver 
their ballots in a way that is reliable, 
secure, and completely free of politics. 
That is why I can’t think of anyone 
better to serve on the Board of Gov-
ernors than Amber McReynolds, who is 
one of the most respected election offi-
cials not just in Colorado but all across 
the country. 
Ms. McReynolds spent 13 years serv-
ing in Denver’s Elections Division, in-
cluding for 7 years as the city’s direc-
tor of elections. Under her leadership, 
Denver became a national model for 
making it easier for people to vote 
while increasing election security. 
She oversaw Denver’s transition to a 
fully vote-by-mail system, where every 
active voter can receive and return 
their ballot by mail or by taking it to 
a drop box in their community. Last 
November, we saw images on television 
of people lining up in this country for 
hours and hours on election day to cast 
their ballots. 
In Colorado, I left my ballot in a se-
cure drop box. There is no line. There 
is no wait. The whole process took 30 
seconds, if that. It is like that all 
across Colorado. It is like that all 
across my State because we have made 
it incredibly easy and secure for Colo-
radoans to cast their ballots. 
Ms. McReynolds had a lot to do with 
that by introducing one popular reform 
after another. She helped to make Den-
ver the first city in America to adopt a 
ballot tracking system, which notifies 
voters when their ballot is mailed, 
when it is delivered and counted so 
they can have transparency about the 
process every step of the way. 
I never have to wonder whether my 
ballot is in the mail or not or whether 
I sent it back or not because I get an 
email from the clerk telling me. You 
even get an email that tells you when 
your ballot has been counted. She had 
a lot to do with that. And after Denver 
put that system in place, cities across 
the country followed our example. 
Ms. McReynolds also led efforts to 
launch a new voting system that used 
touchscreen tablets and other tech-
nologies from Dominion, a fantastic 
Colorado company, that was much 
easier for voters to use and was just 
one-tenth the cost of typical voting 
machines. 
Under her leadership, Denver was 
also one of the earliest counties in Col-
orado to pioneer something called a 
risk-limiting audit, where election offi-
cials match a random sample of ballots 
against the official results to catch any 
discrepancies. It was a cost-effective 
way to reinforce the public’s trust in 
local elections, and it set the stage for 
Colorado to become the first State in 
America to introduce risk-limiting au-
dits statewide. 
The same thing happened with vote- 
by-mail. Ms. McReynolds’ success in 
Denver helped pave the way for Colo-
rado’s transition to a fully vote-by- 
mail system in 2013—2013. That was 8 
years ago. That is two Presidential 
elections ago that we went to vote-by- 
mail. 
And just like in Denver, when we did 
it in the State, none of those changes 
were 
partisan. 
We 
actually 
transitioned to vote-by-mail under a 
Republican secretary of state. In fact, 
there was a view at the time that mov-
ing to vote-by-mail would help Repub-
licans because it made it a lot easier 
for Coloradoans in rural areas to vote. 
In reality, it has made it easier for 
everybody to vote—Democrats, Repub-
licans, and unaffiliated voters, urban 
voters, suburban voters, busy voters, 
working people, students, everybody. 
And it is why we adopted vote-by-mail 
statewide, and turnout went up in 
every demographic group, seniors in-
cluded. Costs went down, and people 
across the State cheered the new sys-
tem. 
Today, I guarantee you, if a politi-
cian in Colorado tried to take away 
vote-by-mail, people would run them 
out of town. In my State, we are proud 
of the election model that we built in a 
collaborative, nonpartisan way, and 
Ms. McReynolds deserves a lot of credit 
for that. 
She is the right kind of leader who 
isn’t satisfied with the status quo. She 
is constantly asking how to make 
things better, how to make things 
more efficient, and how to make com-
plex systems simpler and more acces-
sible and useful to people. That is ex-
actly the kind of experience we need at 
the Postal Service, especially at a time 
when more Americans are voting by 
mail than ever before. 
The Postal Service needs someone 
with her expertise, her leadership, and 
her impatience, frankly, with the sta-
tus quo, and that is why I urge my col-
leagues from both parties to come to-
gether and confirm this outstanding 
nominee from my home State of Colo-
rado. 
With that, I yield the floor.

NATIONAL ROOFING WEEK 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the National Roofing 
Contractors 
Association 
headquartered 
in 
Rosemont, Ill., and its efforts to designate the 
week of June 6–12, 2021, as National Roofing 
Week. 
The roof is one of the most important com-
ponents of any home or business. It is the first 
line of defense against natural elements, such 
as rain, snow or wind, and yet it is often taken 
for granted until it falls into disrepair. National 
Roofing Week honors the thousands of roof-
ing-related businesses and workers across the 
country, as well as the industry’s commitment 
to public service. National Roofing Week is a 
valuable reminder of the significance quality 
roofing has on every home and business in 
the U.S. 
Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the na-
tion’s oldest trade associations and the voice 
of professional roofing contractors worldwide. 
NRCA has nearly 4,000 roofing company 
members who represent the entire roofing 
supply chain. Using its vast network of roofing 
contractors and industry-related members, 
NRCA is responsible for the installation of new 
construction and replacement roof systems on 
commercial and residential structures in Amer-
ica. Most of its members are small, privately 
held businesses that provide family-sustaining 
jobs for thousands of hardworking individuals 
who are the backbone of our economy. 
Professional roofing contractors provide vital 
services to their communities, on and off the 
clock. NRCA members will recognize National 
Roofing Week June 6–12 by supporting nu-
merous charitable projects and employee 
training programs throughout the nation. I 
commend NRCA and the vital role the organi-
zation and its members play in every commu-
nity, and I ask my colleagues to join me in ac-
knowledging their contributions during National 
Roofing Week.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. GLENN THOMPSON 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, due to a death in the family, I was 
unable to cast my vote on May 11, 2021. Had 
I been present, I would have voted NAY on 
Roll Call No. 134. 
HONORING KITTY WILLIAMS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Mrs. Kitty Williams, a Holocaust 
survivor and tireless advocate, as our Iowan of 
the Week. Mrs. Williams is a resident of Coun-
cil Bluffs, Iowa. She is a public speaker who 
travels to schools with the goal of educating 
the youth of America about her experiences 
as a survivor and to ensure that the memory 
of the Holocaust and the horrors of hate, big-
otry, and discrimination are never forgotten. 
She is described as extremely resilient and 
tough as nails and I couldn’t be more proud of 
the work she has done to educate youth and 
people from all walks of life. 
Through Kitty’s imprisonment at Auschwitz 
and later in Allendorf, she endured unspeak-
able atrocities. While she suffered greatly, she 
survived and worked to make a life for herself. 
She ultimately made her way to the United 
States. In her first marriage she experienced 
heartbreak and the loss of her son. She had 
been pressured to hide her Jewish heritage 
and her past but struggled to deny her herit-
age and the horror she experienced. Eventu-
ally, she became a working single mother and 
trained bank tellers. She remarried and found 
a loving husband who embraced her past. 
Through a challenging life, Kitty has per-
severed and survived. She has taken these 
experiences and—despite great heartache and 
trials—has touched the lives of countless indi-
viduals and made a lasting impact on the lives 
of those she interacts with. While the pan-
demic had brought a halt to her ability to do 
presentations, she has since been able to se-
cure a vaccine and fully intends to continue 
her work at the age of 96 educating and giving 
speeches to school children. 
During Women’s History Month it is crucial 
to remember the hard-fought rights and free-
doms gained by women like Kitty. Her bravery 
and determination highlight the efforts taken 
by those who came before us. While stories 
like Kitty’s aren’t often told or shared, her grit 
and force of will show how women can and 
must persist. 
We can never forget our past and the atroc-
ities that have been committed as there are 
still too many instances of bigotry and hate oc-
curring today. It is through stories like Kitty’s 
that we can bridge the experiences of those in 
the past and connect to the battles still to 
come. 
Kitty’s efforts to educate others and be an 
advocate is inspiring and I hope she can soon 
return to schools to remind the next genera-
tion to stay vigilant in the face of adversity and 
to be allies to those who face discrimination. 
I am proud to represent constituents like Kitty 
Williams, who aren’t afraid to stand up for 
themselves and ensure the next generation 
doesn’t forget the past. In this third week of 
Women’s History Month, I couldn’t be happier 
to name Ms. Kitty Williams our Iowan of the 
Week.

EXPLANATION OF ‘‘NO’’ VOTE ON 
H.R. 1629 
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I voted No 
on H.R. 1629. Although I support the bill, I do 
not support the tactics by which it was brought 
to the floor. H.R. 1629 was once a bipartisan 
bill but now, like so many other good bills, it 
will fail due to the pettiness of partisanship.

RECOGNIZING 
WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ 
EBEL, CITY MANAGER OF OVER-
LAND PARK 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize William ‘‘Bill’’ Ebel, City 
Manager of Overland Park for his exemplary 
professional accomplishments. Mr. Ebel has 
been recognized by the American Public 
Works Association’s as one of their ‘‘Top Ten 
Public Works Leaders of the Year’’. 
Mr. Ebel has lived a life committed to public 
service. Before serving as city manager of 
Overland Park, Kansas, Mr. Ebel graduated 
from West Point and served for 21 years in 
the United States Army. He continued pur-
suing an interest in public service through his 
graduate studies in public administration and 
civil engineering. 
In over a decade of public service as city 
manager, Mr. Ebel has prioritized solutions 
and innovation. He championed the Indian 
Creek Flood Control Project which solved 
flooding issues, created development opportu-
nities, and demonstrated his commitment to 
building partnerships between the public and 
private sectors. This commitment to public-pri-
vate partnerships has allowed Mr. Ebel to ex-
plore innovative financing solutions to fund de-
velopment and infrastructure improvements. 
This is just a small glimpse into a lifetime of 
work that has led to this professional achieve-
ment. 
One of the most rewarding parts of rep-
resenting the Kansas Third District is hearing 
about the exemplary service and accomplish-
ments of my fellow Kansans. Mr. Ebel is cer-
tainly no exception and I commend him for his 
dedication to our state and to our country.

HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the players, coaches, and stu-
dent managers of the Glasgow High School 
Boys Basketball Program who were recently 
enshrined in the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. 
This small Howard County community in 
Missouri’s 4th Congressional District has pro-
duced one of the most successful basketball 
programs in state history . . . with the 
Yellowjackets advancing to 16 Final Fours and 
earning Class 1 State championships in 1974, 
1978, and again in 1980. In addition, this 
roundball powerhouse has won 37 district ti-
tles and 28 conference championships. 
The 1986 movie ‘‘Hoosiers’’ told the story of 
a basketball team from a small Indiana town 
as it earned glory against all odds. It could 
easily be the story of the Glasgow High 
School basketball team—a small town team 
with a tremendous record of success. Con-
gratulations to Glasgow High School’s Boys 
Basketball Program on entering the Missouri 
Sports Hall of Fame.

IN MEMORY OF MICHELLE 
SANFORD 
HON. SCOTT FITZGERALD 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory and celebrate the 
life of Mrs. Michelle Sanford, a resident of 
Pewaukee, Wisconsin who passed away at 
the age of 52 on April 19, 2021 after a coura-
geous battle with cancer. 
Michelle will be remembered for her spirited 
and uplifting energy that she brought into 
every corner of her life. To her colleagues at 
the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, 
where she worked for more than 20 years, 
Michelle’s infectious laughter and smile will be 
missed. As will her energy that she brought to 
every project no matter how big or small, or 
close or far. Michelle started her career as a 
secretary at AEM, and quickly grew to become 
an integral leader of the AEM exhibitions and 
operations team. She oversaw operations for 
AEM’s many trade shows, and she traveled 
the globe to support international exhibitions in 
China, India, and Russia, among other places. 
Michelle enjoyed her time with family and 
giving back to her community. She volun-
teered at many organizations but notably vol-
unteered with the Ronald McDonald House 
Charities of Eastern Wisconsin. Michelle 
served on their board and as a direct volun-
teer. 
On behalf of Wisconsin’s 5th Congressional 
District, it is my privilege to celebrate the life 
and legacy of Michelle Sanford for her out-
standing contributions to our community. I 
offer my heartfelt condolences to Michelle’s 
family, including her loving husband Donald, 
her mother Claire, and her many nieces, 
nephews, cousins, relatives, and friends she is 
survived by.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
DIGNITY 
HEALTH 
DOMINICAN 
HOSPITAL 
AS THE RECIPIENT OF THE 2021 
AL 
SMITH 
FRIEND 
OF 
AGRI-
CULTURE AWARD 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Dignity Health Dominican Hos-
pital as the recipient of the 2021 Al Smith 
Friend of Agriculture Award. As a strong sup-
porter of local agriculture, the Dignity Health 
Dominican Hospital has been instrumental in 
the COVID–19 vaccination efforts for our local 
farmworkers. 
Dignity Health Dominican Hospital’s values 
include compassion, inclusion, integrity, excel-
lence, and collaboration. By leading the 
charge in providing COYID–19 vaccines to 
farmworkers in Santa Cruz County, they have 
demonstrated the impact and importance of 
their mission in our community. 
Dignity Health Dominican Hospital will cele-
brate their 80th Anniversary later this year. It 
has always been the Hospital’s steadfast mis-
sion to serve all who come through its doors, 
regardless of ability to pay. When its founders, 
the Adrian Dominican Sisters, arrived in Santa 
Cruz in 1941, they traveled from Michigan to 
reopen a failed hospital on West Cliff Drive. 
Even though only one of them was an active 
healthcare worker, they felt driven to provide 
care for our community. In 1988, the hospital 
joined what was then known as Catholic 
Healthcare West. Their founding tenets of 
community outreach and helping those in 
need have remained the driving values for the 
Dignity Health Dominican Hospital as it moved 
into the 21st century. 
Dignity Health Dominican Hospital has 
evolved to offer the greater surrounding com-
munity the kind of cutting-edge technology 
typically reserved for large metropolitan areas, 
earning them the recognition they deserve. 
The 2021 Al Smith Friend of Agriculture Award 
was awarded to the Hospital for their creation 
of the first large-scale vaccination clinic in 
California that is focused on farmworkers. Ad-
ditionally, they worked with local partners, 
such as the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau, 
to develop a formula to ensure equity in vac-
cine distribution to local farmworkers, Their 
ongoing efforts during vaccine distribution 
made Santa Cruz County a model for 
prioritizing farmworkers for counties through-
out the country. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize the compassion, excellence, and commu-
nity support exemplified by the Dignity Health 
Dominican Hospital, and I ask my distin-
guished colleagues to join me in recognizing 
their service. I extend my personal apprecia-
tion to the healthcare workers, administrators, 
and staff of the Dignity Health Dominican Hos-
pital for their service to our community.

IN HONOR OF THE YORK THEATRE 
COMPANY 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the 
York Theatre Company as it works to fully re-
open. The York Theatre Company was found-
ed by Janet Hayes Walker in 1969. Before the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the York Theatre pro-
duced nearly 200 musical theater perform-
ances each year, reaching over 37,000 pa-
trons. During the coronavirus shutdown, the 
Theatre streamed an online series, so that its 
patrons could continue to experience and 
enjoy musical theater. Unfortunately, on top of 
an already difficult year for New York City the-
aters, the York Theatre Company’s physical 
home was devastated by a flood caused by a 
municipal water main break in January. 
The unique mission of the York Theatre 
Company is two-fold as it aspires to produce 
new musical works, as well as rediscover 
musicals of the past. The York Theatre hosts 
several programs and activities that encourage 
musical theatre students to engage in Off-

Broadway productions, greatly impacting the 
Off-Broadway scene. With programs such as 
the Mainstage Series, Musicals in Mufti Se-
ries, Developmental Reading Series, intern-
ship offerings, and a volunteer program, the 
York Theatre has made its mark on New York 
City’s vibrant theatre community. 
Since 2015, the York Theatre Company has 
offered its Musical Theatre Training Program 
that brings together working professionals and 
dedicated theatre students. This program of-
fers training in singing, acting, and move-
ments, as well as master classes with New 
York’s top theater artists. The York Theatre’s 
intensive sessions are offered to students from 
middle school to college. Many of these 
intensives offer students an opportunity to per-
form on the York Theatre’s Off-Broadway 
stage at the conclusion of the program. 
In the fall of 2014, the York Theatre cele-
brated its 100th Musical in Mufti with the pro-
duction of Stephen Sondheim’s Saturday 
Night. The York Theatre’s Musical in Mufti en-
sures that lesser-known musicals of the past 
are performed and brought into new light for 
the enjoyment of modern audiences. 
All New York City theaters have faced un-
precedented challenges over the past year 
due to the COVID–19 pandemic and the im-
portant public health restrictions put in place, 
but the York Theatre also had to face the un-
expected and heartbreaking flooding of their 
physical home. Faced with these ‘‘slings and 
arrows of outrageous fortune,’’ the York The-
atre has shown its adaptability. It has pro-
duced and streamed an incredibly popular on-
line series. New York—its people and its insti-
tutions—are resilient, and I am confident that 
the York Theatre will soon be able to reopen 
its doors once again and introduce new audi-
ences to the joys of musical theater. 
The York Theatre Company has long been 
an incredible company that makes musical 
theatre accessible to New Yorkers of all ages 
and backgrounds, and I look forward to its full 
reopening. Off-Broadway theatre has played a 
pivotal role in making New York City the the-
ater capitol of the world. The York Theatre 
Company has had a substantial impact on this 
great city’s history. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
rise in recognition of the York Theatre Com-
pany, a principal in shaping New York City’s 
theatre culture, as they celebrate the inau-
guration of their new theatre seats.

IN HONOR OF MESA POLICE 
SERGEANT BRANDON MENDOZA 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor 
of Mesa Police Sgt. Brandon Mendoza who 
was tragically killed by an illegal alien 7 years 
ago. 
In the early morning hours of May 12, 2014, 
Sgt. Mendoza was driving home from his shift 
when he encountered an illegal alien driving 
under the influence of alcohol and meth. The 
illegal alien drove at high speeds in the wrong 
direction for 35 miles on four freeways in the 
Phoenix metro area. Despite law enforcement 
efforts to catch up to and stop the illegal alien, 
he ultimately collided head-on with Sgt. Men-
doza, killing them both. 
Sgt. Mendoza’s death was untimely and 
preventable. But it requires Democrats to get 
serious about enforcement of our immigration 
laws and putting American families first. 
Sgt. Mendoza’s illegal alien killer had pre-
viously pled guilty to criminal conspiracy 
charges in Colorado, but, despite his illegal 
presence, he was not removed from the 
United States. Instead, he roamed free in our 
communities, ultimately choosing to drive with-
out a license and while severely intoxicated. 
Today, there are more than 3 million illegal 
aliens with final orders of removal, many of 
whom are suspected or convicted criminals, 
living in American communities. President 
Biden should prioritize removal of these indi-
viduals before they can do any additional 
harm. 
I am enraged by President Biden’s non-
chalant attitude towards illegal immigration into 
the United States. In April, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection apprehended a near record 
number of aliens attempting to illegally enter 
the United States, more than 173,000. Presi-
dent Biden’s refusal to acknowledge the crisis 
at the border is a bold attempt to mislead the 
American public. 
Last week, I traveled to the southwest bor-
der with 10 fellow members of Congress to 
again see firsthand the damage of President 
Biden’s new border policies. Sgt. Mendoza’s 
mother, Mary Ann, joined us for a portion of 
the tour. Since her son’s death, Mary Ann has 
been a fierce advocate for border security, 
pleading with the Obama and Biden Adminis-
trations to protect other American families 
from experiencing the same pain and suf-
fering. 
During our visit, Mary Ann expressed con-
cern that government leaders have forgotten 
families like hers and instead placed the inter-
ests of illegal aliens ahead of the interests of 
our nation. Families like Sgt. Mendoza’s de-
serve to have their stories remembered. They 
deserve a government willing to protect them 
from the hands of illegal aliens. 
I will continue to fight for border security and 
enforcement of our immigration laws. Sgt. 
Mendoza and other victims of crime by illegal 
aliens deserve no less.

AMERICAN FAMILIES AT RISK 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on Saturday, a murderous, heinous 
car bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed doz-
ens of girls. The intentional targeting of girls 
should be inconceivable but is the deliberate 
aim of fanatical totalitarians who are obsessed 
with murdering American families. Sadly, the 
reality of the Global War on Terrorism is that 
we must defeat terrorists overseas or they will 
return to attack American families. 
I appreciate the insight of Congressman 
MIKE MCCAUL and former Ambassador Ryan 
Crocker in their May 4, 2021, op-ed in The 
New York Times: 
Last month, President Biden announced a 
complete withdrawal of all United States 
troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th 
anniversary of the day terrorists killed al-
most 3,000 people. 
Many in the defense and intelligence com-
munities oppose the move. A complete with-
drawal based on an arbitrary deadline, rath-
er than conditions on the ground, threatens 
our long-term national security. After all, it 
was the decision to rapidly pull out of Iraq, 
creating a power vacuum that allowed the Is-
lamic State to grow, that ultimately forced 
our return to Iraq, prolonging the war. 
We cannot allow history to repeat itself. 
It’s foolish to think the Taliban will en-
gage in good faith with the Afghan govern-
ment or abide by the commitments made to 
the previous administration after we’ve de-
parted. In response to the withdrawal an-
nouncement, 
the 
Taliban 
tellingly 
an-
nounced they would not participate in a 
peace conference planned to start late last 
month in Turkey and refused to commit to a 
date in the future, effectively ending the al-
ready fragile peace process. The Taliban 
clearly does not want peace. 
In fact, after America withdraws, it’s very 
likely the Taliban will try to take control of 
the country, once again giving our enemies a 
place from which to conduct external at-
tacks against us and our allies. Without a 
military presence in country, the United 
States will be giving the green light to the 
Taliban to roam and conquer. 
As William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, 
told the Senate Intelligence Committee in 
April, there is ‘‘significant risk’’ associated 
with withdrawal. ‘‘The U.S. government’s 
ability to collect and act on threats will di-
minish,’’ he said. ‘‘That’s simply a fact.’’ 
The decision, however, has been made. But 
before the pullout is complete, the Biden ad-
ministration must mitigate its dangers. As 
our sources on the ground will soon go dark, 
the gaps in our intelligence collection and 
counterterrorism networks must be rem-
edied so we retain the ability to identify and 
eliminate threats before they reach our 
shores. To do so, we must urgently set up 
agreements with neighboring countries to 
provide us with intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance capabilities. 
Mr. Biden promised that America’s human-
itarian and development assistance to the 
country would continue. To enable our per-
sonnel and the countless nongovernmental 
organizations we work with to provide that 
help, we must keep them safe. If the country 
slides back into civil war or once again falls 
under Taliban rule, maintaining an embassy 
presence and distributing assistance will be-
come close to impossible. The administra-
tion must develop a clear strategy for pro-
tecting our embassy, diplomatic staff and 
aid workers. 
The president must also acknowledge that 
the withdrawal will have dire consequences 
for Afghan women and girls—and work hard 
to prevent it. For the past 20 years, we have 
encouraged Afghan women to step forward, 
as students, teachers and professionals. En-
couraged by our presence, they did just that. 
But without our presence in the country, it 
will be difficult to safeguard the gains 
women have made in Afghan society and to 
ensure women ’s rights are protected.

Lastly, we have obligations to the thou-
sands of Afghans who supported us, mainly 
as interpreters for our military. They were 
promised special immigrant visas to get 
them out of harm’s way, but many have yet 
to materialize. The Taliban view them as 
traitors: Since 2014, there have been at least 
300 targeted killings of people who worked 
with us. Many more will die if the adminis-
tration doesn’t take immediate steps to 
speed up the process to get them out safely. 
These are vital issues Mr. Biden and his 
team must address—before we pull out on 
Sept. 11. 
Yet so far they have offered no clarity on 
what counterterrorism agreements, if any, 
have been reached with other countries. 
They have provided only minimal assurances 
for how they will secure the safety of our 
embassy and personnel. They appear to have 
no plans for protecting Afghan women. And 
they have announced no strategy to address 
the visa backlog that could endanger thou-
sands of our Afghan partners’ lives. 
When America pulls out of a conflict zone 
at the wrong time, it creates a vacuum in 
which the terrorist threat grows again. That, 
in turn, eventually requires a re-entry of 
forces to keep Americans safe. So begins yet 
another forever war. 
The ill-advised decision to pull out of Af-
ghanistan may do just that. But by ensuring 
proper guardrails are in place, we have a 
chance to limit the fallout.
