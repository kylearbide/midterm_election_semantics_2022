DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable JAMIE

Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Compassionate and merciful God, 
thank You for giving us another day. 
Lord, bless the world, give health to 
our bodies and comfort to our hearts. 
You ask us to not be afraid. When our 
faith is weak and we are fearful, this is 
difficult for us, but You, O Lord, will 
not leave us at the mercy of the storm. 
Bless those who continue to serve, 
even though threatened in doing so, 
healthcare professionals, food service 
workers, and those whose work de-
mands they engage outside zones of 
distance protection. 
If the struggle against COVID–19 is a 
war, then we are all truly an invisible 
army fighting in the most dangerous 
trenches, an army for whom solidarity 
is perhaps our most powerful weapon. 
May we all be willing to make per-
sonal sacrifices for the benefit of the 
entire community, especially when so-
cietal rules are moving toward opening 
after a prolonged period of isolation. 
Help us, O Lord, during this time to 
take stock and renew our lives to-
gether as citizens. Our ways of life, 
often 
so 
competitive 
and 
individ-
ualistic, have been slowed down and 
quieted. May we take appropriate 
stock, 
and 
perhaps 
emerge 
more 
grounded in our understanding that we 
are brothers and sisters and in need of 
the health and well-being of one an-
other, all of us. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen. 
f

ant to section 4(a) of House Resolution

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio led the 
Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

fore the House the following resigna-
tion from the House of Representa-
tives: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 22, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives,

DEAR MADAM SPEAKER, As I prepare to as-
sume my duties as Director of National In-
telligence, I hereby make official my res-
ignation from the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, effective Friday, May 22, 2020. I have 
also submitted my notice to Governor Ab-
bott to advise him on my resignation. I have 
attached that letter to this notice. 
The Ineligibility Clause of the Constitu-
tion of the United States precludes concur-
rent service in different branches of the fed-
eral government. In dedicating myself to the 
duties and responsibilities of my new office 
in the Executive branch, I must therefore 
yield my office in the Legislative branch. 
It has been my honor to be a Member of 
this Chamber and to serve the people of the 
great state of Texas and the constituents of 
the 4th District of Texas. I will forever be 
grateful for the opportunity. I look forward 
to continuing to work with you and your col-
leagues in the House serving the nation in 
my new position. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN RATCLIFFE, 
Member of Congress. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,

Hon. GREG ABBOTT, 
Governor, State of Texas 
Austin, TX. 
DEAR GOVERNOR ABBOTT, I hereby submit 
my resignation as United States Representa-
tive of the 4th District of Texas effective Fri-
day, May 22, 2020. 
I am also on the ballot for reelection to 
this same office in November. The Constitu-
tion of the United States precludes concur-
rent service in the Executive and Legislative 
branches of the federal government. There-
fore, I will be ineligible to serve as United 
States Representative of the 4th District of 
Texas if reelected. 
It has been my honor to represent the 
great state of Texas and the constituents of 
the 4th District of Texas. I will be forever 
grateful for the opportunity to serve the peo-
ple of Northeast Texas. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN RATCLIFFE.

HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RECOV-
ERY OMNIBUS EMERGENCY SO-
LUTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Heroes Act and the important 
programs in the bill that will help our first re-
sponders, health care workers, small busi-
nesses, and cities address this pandemic. 
Although the bill includes critical provisions 
to address the pension crisis by providing ad-
ditional funding and resources to multi-em-
ployer pensions, I am very concerned that it 
includes language regarding composite pen-
sion plans that is controversial within the labor 
and pension community. 
There are many who believe composite 
plans would provide workers with less benefits 
and more risk, and they contend that if these 
new composite plans existed during this 
COVID crisis, the value of their plans would 
have dramatically eroded. 
The Obama Administration in 2016 strongly 
opposed composite plan legislation that was 
nearly identical to the GROW Act. The then 
National Economic Council, PBGC, and De-
partments of Treasury and Labor sent to the 
Hill a position paper that explained that com-
posite legislation would put existing pension 
benefits at greater risk, result in less depend-
able and transparent retirement benefits, and 
deepen the insolvency crisis at the PBGC. 
The position paper urged Congress not to in-
clude composite plan legislation in a package 
because ‘‘such complex legislation deserves, 
at minimum, appropriate bicameral hearings 
and time for analysis and debate.’’ 
I hope that the Senate will look at this issue 
closely as there should be more debate and 
review of this proposal. I include in the 
RECORD statements regarding composite pen-
sion plans from a coalition of labor unions and 
the Pension Rights Center. 
Statement by the Bakery, Confectionery, 
Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Inter-
national Union (BCTGM), Directors Guild of 
America (DGA), International Brotherhood 
of Boilermakers, International Alliance of 
Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), Inter-
national Assoc. of Machinists & Aerospace 
Workers, International Longshore and Ware-
house Union (ILWU), International Union of 
Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), Musi-
cians for Pension Security Pension Rights 
Center, SEIU, United Food and Commercial 
Workers 
International 
Union 
(UFCW), 
United Steelworkers (USW), Western Con-
ference of Teamsters Pension Trust 
Our organizations, representing tens of 
millions of workers and retirees, strongly 
support passage this year of critical legisla-
tion to assist severely underfunded multiem-
ployer pension plans to ensure that retirees 
and their families receive their hard-earned 
pensions. More than ten million Americans 
depend on multiemployer pension plans for a 
secure retirement for themselves and their 
families. Throughout their careers, these 
workers gave up a portion of wages to earn 
their pension benefits. In retirement, they 
deserve to receive the pensions they earned 
and retire with dignity. The Emergency Pen-
sion Plan Relief Act proposal advanced by 
senators meets this standard by using a spe-
cial partition program funded by the federal 
government to support troubled plans and 
their participants. We urge that this pro-
posal be passed as soon as possible. 
At the same time, we strongly oppose com-
posite plan legislation. Composite legisla-
tion, including the GROW Act, hurts work-
ers, retirees, employers, and the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) and 
should not become law. 
Composite legislation is deeply flawed be-
cause it allows multiemployer plan trustees 
to ‘‘refinance’’ their obligations to workers 
and retirees in the existing plan over 25 
years instead of 15 years, so they can divert 
money to start a new composite plan. This 
weakens the existing plan and leaves neither 
plan—the existing plan nor the composite 
plan—with enough money to pay promised 
benefits. 
The current public health and economic 
crisis illustrates the harm composite plan 
legislation would inflict on Americans. If 
Congress had already passed the GROW Act 
and it was law now, workers in a previously 
healthy multiemployer pension plan that 
converted to a composite plan would face 
draconian benefit cuts. The benefits com-
posite plan participants expected they would 
earn would be cut 70%, and the vested bene-
fits they already earned would be cut 25%. At 
the same time, the vested benefits of work-
ers in the existing plan would be cut 21%. To 
avoid benefit cuts, employers would be re-
quired to increase contributions by approxi-
mately 82%—above and beyond what they al-
ready committed. 
The GROW Act also starves the PBGC of 
needed funds and would compound the insol-
vency problems faced by the agency. Com-
posite plans are not required to pay PBGC 
premiums, even though their creation will 
increase the PBGC’s liabilities by driving 
plans out of the multiemployer system and 
increasing risks on participants who con-
tinue to rely on the PBGC to insure their 
benefits. 
We applaud your efforts to address multi-
employer pensions as a part of legislation 
this year. We support legislation to preserve 
healthy multiemployer plans and to help re-
tirees in deeply troubled plans, but we 
strongly oppose the GROW Act. 
STATEMENT OF THE PENSION RIGHTS COALITION 
With the House of Representatives poised 
to vote on the next COVID–19 relief package, 
known as the HEROES Act, the Pension 
Rights Center applauds the congressional 
leaders who have included within the mas-
sive bill the important provisions of the 
Emergency 
Pension 
Plan 
Relief 
Act 
(EPPRA) which will strengthen the nation’s 
multiemployer pension system. PRC, how-
ever, urges Congress to strip from the pack-
age the misguided Giving Retirement Op-
tions to Workers Act (GROW Act), which 
would undermine this all-important system. 
By including EPPRA in the HEROES Act, 
Congress will not only help save workers’ 
and retirees’ pensions, but also stabilize for 
decades to come the federal agency that in-
sures our nation’s private pension plans, the 
Pension 
Benefit 
Guaranty 
Corporation 
(PBGC). 
‘‘More than 1 million workers and retirees 
have been closely watching Congress and 
waiting for policymakers to finally pass leg-
islation that ensures full payment of their 
promised 
pensions, 
which 
they 
earned 
through years of toil,’’ said Karen Friedman, 
the PRC’s executive vice president. 
‘‘First, their hopes were buoyed in 2019 
when the House passed a bill designed to pro-
tect their benefits, known as the Butch 
Lewis Act. But that legislation failed to ad-
vance in the Senate. Now, both the retirees 
and the PRC are excited that Congress has 
included the well-crafted EPPRA within the 
latest COVID–19 bill. By doing so, Congress 
recognizes that those workers and retirees 
who helped build this country and who will 
benefit from the legislation should be per-
mitted to receive the retirement income 
they earned through hard work and playing 
by the rules. We urge all members of the 
House and Senate to make these pension res-
cue provisions a reality for these workers 
and retirees and for their families.’’ 
PRC strongly supports EPPRA because it 
shores up underfunded plans by providing the 
PBGC with the funding to take on certain li-
abilities of ailing plans. This ‘‘partitioning’’ 
process will ensure that the plans survive for 
the long-term and are able to pay in full the 
earned benefits owed to workers and retirees. 
The bill also increases the guarantees paid 
by the PBGC when plans fail and would re-
store benefits to retirees who have already 
had their benefits cut because of the unfair 
provisions of the Multiemployer Pension Re-
form Act of 2014. EPP RA shares a structure 
similar to a proposal advanced by Senate Fi-
nance Committee Chairman Charles Grass-
ley (R–IA) and Senate Health, Education, 
Labor and Pension Committee Chairman 
Lamar Alexander (R–TN). 
‘‘We believe that it’s appropriate for 
EPPRA to be part of the HEROES Act since 
those most at risk of losing benefits in these 
multiemployer plans are the very same 
workers who are risking their lives to pro-
tect us in this time of crisis. They are the 
truck drivers who are transporting food and 
supplies, the nurses and health care workers 
at the front lines, the grocery store workers 
who are keeping us fed, the laborers who are 
building our hospitals, and the musicians 
who, despite social distancing, keep on play-
ing for us on line to soothe our anxiety’’ 
Friedman said. 
‘‘These are America’s unsung heroes who 
do—and did—the essential jobs that we all 
are depending on in this time of lockdown.’’ 
Unlike EPPRA, which will strengthen fail-
ing multiemployer plans and protect workers 
and retirees and the PBGC, passage of the 
GROW Act would undermine the multiem-
ployer plan system by weakening currently 
well-funded plans and creating new inferior 
plans that do not provide guaranteed bene-
fits. It would also lead to the underfunding 
of the PBGC. 
PRC urges the leaders of the House of Rep-
resentatives to drop the GROW Act from the 
HEROES Act. 
The GROW Act is also vigorously opposed 
by AARP, the Western Conference of Team-
sters, the SEIU, IBEW, Steelworkers, Ma-
chinists, Boilermakers and other unions and 
organizations.

The Center also cheers inclusion in the HE-
ROES Act of a provision that would provide 
grants to community-based organizations to 
help low-income divorced women and sur-
vivors of domestic abuse receive their court- 
awarded retirement benefits. This provision 
was originally introduced by Senator Patty

Protection Act (S. 975, H.R. 2005).

LILIE STOOLMAN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Lilie Stoolman 
for receiving the Adams County Mayors and 
Commissioners Youth Award. 
Lilie Stoolman is a 12th grader at Horizon 
High School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The 
dedication 
demonstrated 
by 
Lilie 
Stoolman is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Lilie 
Stoolman for winning the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award. I have 
no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication 
and 
character 
in 
all 
of 
her 
future 
accomplishments.

HONORING ELIZABETH S. ELLIS 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would like to include in the RECORD 
the following article honoring Elizabeth S. Ellis, 
the longtime influential publisher of Connecti-
cut’s Journal Inquirer newspaper, who passed 
away on May 4, 2020. Dedicating 53 years of 
her life to the Journal Inquirer, Ellis success-
fully expanded the small, local newspaper 
from five to eighteen towns. She notably broke 
gender barriers by directing the paper when 
few women were afforded leadership roles in 
journalism. What impressed me the most was 
how she was able to, in a relatively short pe-
riod of time, rival the State Paper of Record 
the Hartford Courant. She attracted talented 
journalists including the state’s leading sports 
writer, Randy Smith and editorial page editor 
and writer, Chris Powell. Elizabeth Ellis’ dedi-
cation to her community is commendable, and 
I believe it deserves recognition. 
[From the Journal Inquirer] 
PORTRAIT OF A LADY, AND US 
(By Keith C. Burris) 
Seekers look for teachers. They sit at the 
feet of those who can teach them something 
about how to live. My Uncle Tom, at whose 
feet I sat for a time (actually we sat in deck 
chairs on a high-rise balcony drinking gin), 
was an old test and fighter pilot with an eye 
for character and detail. He called me ‘‘little 
grasshopper’’ when I was in college. 
But I want to tell you about another per-
son who taught me, and did so for 21 years, 
never once in didactic fashion. 
Her name was Elizabeth Ellis, and she was 
my boss, mentor, friend, life coach, and mas-
ter teacher for all those years, at the Jour-
nal Inquirer. 
Betty died this week at the age of 92. 
The first thing she taught me was to be 
independent—to steer my own path and not 
to be intimidated. I never saw or heard her 
worry about ‘‘what people might say’’ or 
think. 
She had a worldview. I would call it Roo-
sevelt liberalism, but this worldview was as 
practical and subject to empirical testing as 
it was principled. She was an intellect, but 
she did not live in the world of abstraction. 
She lived in the world of the possible. 
An early lesson in her independence and 
pragmatism was the case of two young, inex-
perienced cops shooting and killing a man 
who was high and charged at them, threat-
ening to take them out. He had a knife, but 
was otherwise unarmed. 
I wanted to hammer the cops in an edi-
torial. I wanted to say their lives were never 
at risk and they should have shot the guy in 
the foot or leg. And, anyway, their superiors 
should not have sent two green cops on this 
call. These were not unreasonable positions. 
Betty quietly asked me some questions: 
Had I considered the dilemma from the 
young cops’ point of view? How long did they 
have to think? What information did they 
have? What did I know about the size, dis-
tance, and disposition of the man who came 
at the cops? And, most devastatingly, had I 
ever tried to shoot someone in the foot or 
leg? Had I ever been in a situation remotely 
similar? Did I know anyone who had? 
This was my lesson in empathy, with side 
tutorials in balance, skepticism, and judg-
ment. 
I never thought of Betty as a religious per-
son. But she was a deeply sensitive person 
and a profoundly Jewish person. Hence her 
innate sense of justice and understanding. I 
never once saw her get emotional or senti-
mental, but she walked me though the death 
of my father, and the long illness and death 
of my mother, as no one else did—with the 
blessed assurance of the psalmist. Or maybe 
just a mom. 
She once told me that a newspaper should 
be a place where a person could go when he 
has exhausted all other options—the paper 
should be the recourse of last resort. 
The third thing I learned from her was a 
sense of fun. 
Yes, she regarded journalism as a high 
calling. But there is no sense in owning or 
producing a daily newspaper, she thought, if 
you don’t have some fun—afflicting the com-
fortable as well as comforting the afflicted. 
Every day. 
And we did have fun. We laughed a lot and 
rattled a lot of cages. And we regularly sur-
prised people. And formed no permanent alli-
ances. (We didn’t endorse in political races.) 
We took the work seriously but ourselves 
not so much. We had a feisty little news-
paper. At one time, when such things were 
possible, the JI was the fastest growing 
paper in New England. The paper’s motto 
was: ‘‘We tell it like it is, somebody has to.’’ 
Betty set the tone and tenor. She was 
rightly called, in her JI obit, ‘‘the soul’’ of 
the paper. She drew the boundaries and let 
us all roam within. She never stopped being 
a fan of good journalism or good writing and 
she was lavish with praise when she thought 
any one of us reached the top. But occasion-
ally she would intone, always with a wry 
smile, ‘‘remember, it’s my sandbox.’’ 
She relished being the underdog and she 
loved a good fight. She adored jazz and the-
ater and she liked cocktails, and sentences, 
that packed a punch. Her wit was sharp and 
dry and her composure eclipsed the truth 
that she was actually tough as nails. But she 
was also, in every sense of the word—a word 
in unfortunate retreat these days—a lady. 
And when I say tough, I refer not only to 
things she endured in life—loss, pain, the 
ruthlessness of age—but a certain mental 
toughness about the world. She was an old- 
fashioned progressive, but there was nothing 
of what we would today call ‘‘woke’’ about 
her. Not one ounce of preciousness or virtue 
signaling. And when I think about her I won-
der if we have lost all rigor, both in our pro-
fession and in our society. What would she 
think about an entire economy shut down; a 
whole society sheltering in place, ad infi-
nitum? 
Maybe that it is good that we are starting 
to reopen America; good that we are starting 
to come out. Maybe she would say that risk 
is part of life and we take a risk every time 
we leave the house or turn the key in the 
car. And who wants to live in a society where 
you can’t shake hands or hug your kid or 
visit your aging mother or your newborn 
granddaughter? Life is risk. And either you 
risk or you live by fear. 
Elizabeth Ellis took risks. It seemed to me 
she was never afraid.

LUTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, we have had a 
lot of talk on this floor today about this bill with 
people pointing fingers and saying: It doesn’t 
do this or it doesn’t do that. 
However, if we were to examine the intent 
of this bill we can see one thing with crystal 
clarity. 
What it does do is to provide real support 
for American heroes: our physicians, our 
nurses, our cops, our teachers, our firemen, 
and our first responders. 
But there are many other heroes moving our 
country forward during these perilous times. 
Our grocery store clerks, bus drivers, mental 
health counselors, food bank employees, 
farmers and the list would certainly include 
leaders at every level of State and local gov-
ernments. 
And this is not just a Democratic effort. 
This is an effort that is supported by Repub-
licans as well, and somebody needs to say 
that. 
Republican Governors, Republican mayors, 
Republican County officials, and there will be 
some Republican Members on that side of the 
aisle who vote for this bill because it is the 
right thing to do. 
It provides needed testing, and it provides 
the resources those on the front lines in this 
war 
against 
our 
common 
enemy—the 
Coronavirus pandemic—who need to survive 
and to thrive once again. 
It is a critical way for us to do more than to 
simply offer words. 
It allows us to offer hope to these true 
American heroes.

EXPRESSING 
GRATITUDE 
TO 
MARK PETTITT FOR HIS SERV-
ICE TO AMERICA 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
after ably and honorably serving as my chief 
of staff for more than 9 years, Mark Pettitt will 
retire in June. Mark has provided exceptional 
leadership, and I’ve greatly benefited from 
having him as my chief advisor. I will miss his 
sound and candid guidance. 
When asked how he came to be my chief 
of staff, Mark will often reply, ‘‘I complained 
about politics too many times to an old friend.’’ 
That is only partly true. Really, it was Mark’s 
deeply ingrained sense of patriotism that led 
him to Capitol Hill. 
Mark’s tenure as chief of staff caps an al-
ready exemplary career as a successful pri-
vate sector engineer. For Mark, there are few 
more patriotic acts than simply working hard 
and contributing each day to America’s eco-
nomic and industrial prowess. 
Mark worked hard throughout his career. He 
earned both his masters and undergraduate 
degrees in engineering from Brigham Young 
University. He served as an R&D Engineer 
and Project Manager at Wylie Laboratories in 
Huntsville, Alabama from 1978–1989. While at 
Wylie, Mark earned his Professional Engineer 
license. He went on to work as an Executive 
Consultant 
and 
Product 
Manager 
for 
Intergraph Corporation from 1989–2010. As an 
aside, Mark is a 10th degree Jiu Jitsu black 
belt. 
Given his private sector background, Mark 
offers a unique perspective on federal policy 
issues. Always one to put America first, Mark 
has been particularly active in addressing 
America’s trade imbalances and has long ad-
vocated for trade policies that benefit Amer-
ican workers. 
As Mark’s career concludes, I cannot thank 
him enough for the value he provided me, the 
Tennessee Valley, and America. I wish Mark 
joy and contentment as he embarks on this 
next phase of life. He is looking forward to en-
joying well-deserved time with his wife, Diane, 
five children—John, Jared, Ben, Nichole, and 
Joseph—and 12 grandchildren! Mark has 
earned every bit of that family time. 
America is a stronger, more prosperous na-
tion thanks to Mark’s exemplary career.

ALDEN BURCH NARANJO, JR. 
TRIBUTE 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Alden Burch Naranjo, Jr. of Ignacio, 
Colorado, a leader within the Southern Ute 
Tribe who recently passed away. 
Alden attended Ute Vocational School and 
later graduated from St. Catherine’s Indian 
School in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After pur-
suing his education, Alden enlisted in the U.S. 
Army during the Vietnam War and served his 
country honorably. His service to others con-
tinued following the Vietnam War, when he 
transitioned into a career with the Southern 
Ute Tribe which spanned 40 years. 
Alden served as the Native American 
Graves 
Protection 
and 
Repatriation 
Act 
(NAGPRA) Coordinator, working to ensure 
federal laws protect Native American lineal de-
scendants with respect to the treatment, repa-
triation, and disposition of Native American 
human remains and culturally important ob-
jects were implemented. He also served as a 
police officer, staffer for the Division of Wild-
life, probation officer, and historian. He was 
also a member of Keepers of the Treasures— 
which predated NAGPRA—and a spiritual 
leader for tribal members. This role sent him 
around the world to educate people on Native 
American rights, spirituality, and culture. 
Alden also held the role of President of the 
Native American Church of the Southern Ute 
Indian Reservation and the United States 
Chapters. In what free time he had, he was a 
traditional Sun dancer and took great pride in 
his Native American heritage. He will be sorely 
missed by his large extended family, the entire 
Southern Ute Tribe, and State of Colorado. 
Madam Speaker, Alden’s death is a loss for 
not only the Southern Ute Tribe but for the en-
tire State of Colorado, and all of us who value 
the rich culture and historical heritage he 
worked so passionately throughout his life to 
share. Alden’s legacy will be remembered and 
live on for generations to come.

HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the achievements of 
Mr. Hank Browne, who was inducted into this 
year’s Arkansas Outdoor Hall of Fame by the 
Arkansas Game and Fish Foundation. 
Hank is a lifelong hunter and dedicated sup-
porter of the Arkansas Game and Fish Foun-
dation. 
He also founded his own business in Arkan-
sas in 1975, Hank’s Fine Furniture, which was 
recognized as one of America’s Top 100 Inde-
pendent Furniture Retailers. 
As a member of The Nature Conservancy 
Arkansas’ Last Great Places Society, he has 
been a champion of conservation efforts in the 
Natural State throughout his lifetime. 
His service to the state of Arkansas and to 
wildlife and conservation will never be forgot-
ten, and I join all Arkansans in congratulating 
Hank on this achievement and wish him much 
continued success.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
PAM BROWN LARSEN 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, today, 
the Tri-Cities community celebrates and hon-
ors the career of Pam Brown Larsen. For the 
past 25 years, Pam has served as Executive 
Director of Hanford Communities, an intergov-
ernmental cooperative organization embraced 
by four cities, two counties, and a port district. 
Pam began this journey in 1994 when she be-
came the first and only person to fill the posi-
tion created by the City of Richland. 
Throughout her career, Pam has been a 
steadfast advocate for the cleanup of the Han-
ford Site and for the people and communities 
surrounding it. Her leadership has been crucial 
to the progress seen at the 586 square mile 
site. Pam has played a pivotal role in increas-
ing the public’s access to information about

Hanford, and her efforts advocating for a cost- 
effective, safe, and prompt cleanup will con-
tinue to shape the mission at the site in the 
years to come. 
Pam has not only been an expert on nu-
clear cleanup issues at the local level; she has 
also shared her collaborative leadership model 
at the national and international levels as well. 
The Tri-Cities was the only Department of 
Energy community with a government advo-
cacy association at the time of its creation. 
Since then, communities like those in Los Ala-
mos, New Mexico and Oak Ridge, Tennessee 
have followed the example of Hanford Com-
munities in creating their own associations. 
Pam has gone on to share her model of waste 
cleanup community advocacy with agency 
leaders in Fukushima, Japan. Her leadership 
has made, and will continue to make, a sus-
taining mark on the cleanup efforts of the fu-
ture. 
Pam, it is an honor to know you, both as a 
constituent, and as a friend. I know I am not 
alone in thanking you for your years of service 
and in wishing you the very best in retirement. 
Congratulations.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN F. PRENTICE 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding in-
dividual, John Prentice, who passed away at 
the age of 66 on April 30, 2020. John was a 
loving husband, a dedicated community mem-
ber, and a dear friend of mine. He will be 
deeply missed. 
John was born on December 2, 1953, the 
son of Rita and George Prentice. John and I 
grew up together in Corona, California and 
had an incredible friendship that spanned from 
kindergarten to today. After graduating at the 
top of his class from Corona High School, 
John attended Cal Poly Pomona and earned a 
Bachelor of Science degree which led him to 
become a Certified Public Accountant. 
In 1980, John married the love of his life 
Melody Cissna, a wonderful woman who I 
have the pleasure of also calling a friend. To-
gether they shared almost forty years of mar-
riage filled with exciting travels, and lots of ski-
ing, boating, and golfing. John and Melody 
took on their adventures together and sur-
rounded themselves with good friends . 
John was an active CPA for more than 40 
years, joining Eadie & Payne, LLP as a staff 
accountant in 1976. He worked his way up to 
becoming the firm’s managing partner in 2000 
and served in that role until he retired in 2017. 
John served as my accountant for many 
years, and I can personally attest to the many 
lives he touched throughout his career where 
he was known for his humor, warmth, intel-
ligence, and optimistic outlook. 
John was an active member of the Rotary 
Club of San Bernardino and Inland Action, or-
ganizations which he graced with his time, 
leadership skills, and wit. He made lifelong 
friendships through his associations in profes-
sional accounting, agricultural, and construc-
tion trade groups. John was incredibly dedi-
cated to his colleagues, clients, friends, and 
family. 
John is survived by his wife Melody, mother 
Rita, and his brothers Dan, Joe, and Jim 
Prentice. He is fondly remembered by his 
cousins, nieces, nephews, extended family, 
and friends for his generosity and kind spirit. 
I had the pleasure of knowing John both 
personally and professionally throughout most 
of my life. He was a wonderful friend, a tal-
ented professional and a passionate advocate 
for our region. He was a great American and 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to my dear 
friend Melody and to all those who knew John. 
Although he may no longer be with us, he will 
continue to have a lasting impact on the lives 
of his family and community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MASTER 
PATROL 
OFFICER 
SPENCER 
BRISTOL 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of a dis-
tinguished public servant from Tennessee’s 
Sixth Congressional District, fallen Master Pa-
trol Officer Spencer Daniel Bristol. Officer Bris-
tol committed his life and career to keeping 
the city of Hendersonville, TN safe from crime, 
after serving 5 years in the United States 
Navy. 
His loss has been profoundly felt in and 
around Hendersonville and across the law en-
forcement community in Tennessee and be-
yond. Hundreds of Hendersonville residents 
from all walks of life lined the town’s main 
street to pay their respects the day he was 
laid to rest. It is important that we recognize 
the sacrifices made by law enforcement offi-
cers, not only during police week, but every 
day. We have them to thank for keeping our 
families, neighborhoods, and communities 
safe. 
Everyday heroes like Officer Bristol are the 
ones who continue to make this nation great. 
I offer my condolences to the family he leaves 
behind; his wife, Lauren, and their 3-year-old 
daughter, Eloise.

STEPHANIE ROSSI 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Stephanie Rossi, who after 
40 years of teaching, is retiring. Stephanie’s 
dedication to education in the Jefferson Coun-
ty School District and to the State of Colorado 
has made a significant impact on students 
which will last for years to come. 
Stephanie started teaching in the Jeffco 
School District in 1994. Currently she teaches 
courses in social studies—including AP U.S. 
history, world religions, and psychology—as 
well as geography and American government. 
Her reputation has become so legendary that 
kids who haven’t even reached high school 
cross their fingers to one day join her class-
room. She even has special nicknames, be-
coming known as Rossi Woman or Mama 
Ross within Wheat Ridge High School. And 
she does all of it with a smile on her face, and 
the passion and creativity that she gives to her 
students each and every day is tremendous. 
In addition to her teaching career, Stephanie 
has provided countless hours and resources 
to the Jefferson County community by serving 
on local and state boards and commissions. 
She spent countless hours working with the 
Jefferson County Education Association and in 
2015 received the Williams College’s annual 
George Olmsted, Jr. Class of 1924 Prize for 
Excellence in Secondary School Teaching. In 
her spare time, she works to improve school 
culture by promoting and encouraging diverse 
perspectives for students and adults alike. She 
also leads a Peace Jam Club, which promotes 
peaceful problem solving, and Compassion 
Crew, an anonymous student group that rec-
ognizes people who commit acts of kindness. 
Her contribution to the Jefferson County 
School District and the Jefferson County com-
munity is remarkable and her teaching has in-
spired thousands of students to pursue their 
dreams. I congratulate Stephanie on a lifetime 
of service and wish her all the best in retire-
ment.

HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RECOV-
ERY OMNIBUS EMERGENCY SO-
LUTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of House Democrats’ next 
comprehensive coronavirus relief package, the 
HEROES Act. 
The HEROES Act contains an additional 
$75 billion for the testing, tracing and treat-
ment required to match the threat posed by 
the coronavirus. We have also ensured that 
access to medical services is prioritized and 
safeguarded, such that every American can 
access free COVID–19 treatment. The HE-
ROES 
Act 
eliminates 
cost 
sharing 
for 
coronavirus treatment for Medicare and Med-
icaid beneficiaries, as well as those with pri-
vate health insurance, TRICARE, VA Health 
Care, and Federal Employee Health Benefits. 
Additionally, we have infused an additional 
$100 billion into the Health Care Provider Re-
lief Fund and have ensured that these funds 
are distributed to providers in an equitable and 
efficient way. All these investments in our pub-
lic health and medical systems will further sup-
port our communities as they withstand this 
coronavirus pandemic. 
In order to assist the small businesses bear-
ing the brunt of the economic impact of the 
coronavirus, the HEROES Act strengthens the 
Payroll Protection Program and adds safe-
guards to ensure equal funding distribution to 
underserved communities. These, paired with 
an extension of weekly unemployment pay-
ments through January of 2021, are vital life-
lines to small business owners and those they 
employ. 
The HEROES Act also commits nearly $1 
trillion alone to state and local governments 
for the purpose of paying those workers fight-
ing this disease and its effects on the 
frontlines. Additionally, it creates a $200 billion

hazard pay fund to ensure that frontline work-
ers are compensated accordingly for their ef-
forts in these dangerous conditions. 
For those who have lost their jobs, the HE-
ROES Act introduces funding for programs 
that, among others, address workplace and 
food security, housing assistance, health in-
surance, public education and direct payments 
to those who qualify. 
Mr. Speaker, though we as Members of 
Congress come to this floor from all corners of 
the country, representing different districts and 
demographics, we are united today by a com-
mon issue—our communities are struggling. 
Tens of thousands of loved ones have already 
been lost and millions now find themselves 
without a steady source of income, to say 
nothing of the additional hardships that will lin-
ger for years to come. The HEROES Act is an 
essential step forward to assure that we are 
appropriately addressing the needs of our 
communities, therefore I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill and urge the 
Senate to take it under consideration.

HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RECOV-
ERY OMNIBUS EMERGENCY SO-
LUTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. RON WRIGHT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 15, 2020 
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, while I am not 
able to attend the vote for H.R. 6800, the 
Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus 
Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act on May 
15, 2020. I want to express my strong opposi-
tion to this legislation, and I plan to vote 
against it. 
This 1800-page bill is anything but heroic. It 
reads more like a Democrat Christmas list. In-
stead of crafting law, the Speaker wrote and 
dropped a political bill that she and the rest of 
her party know is dead on arrival in the Sen-
ate. This is not a serious attempt to pass more 
relief for American workers, businesses, and 
health professionals. Changing election laws, 
incentivizing illegal immigration, bailing out 
mismanaged pensions, and spending the cap 
on state and local tax deduction for the top 1 
percent have nothing to do with the Wuhan 
Virus and do not address the real needs of the 
American people. 
As usual there are positive elements upon 
which there could be bipartisan support: more 
small business relief, help for our agricultural 
sector, additional resources for front line 
health care workers, and more funding for 
testing development and deployment. No 
doubt, these provisions will be cynically her-
alded as others ensure the bill’s demise. Writ-
ing a politically inspired bill behind closed 
doors without meaningful negotiations with the 
minority, the Senate, or the White House is 
not how law is crafted. Rather, it’s how 
mockeries are made that further erode the 
faith and confidence of the American people in 
Congress. 
Rather than spending another $3 trillion to 
push a socialist agenda and further expand 
government, we should be working together to 
assess how effectively the previous $3 trillion 
has been spent, and then identify the needs 
that are appropriate for the federal govern-
ment to fill. 
Enough with the political stunts. Let’s get 
back to working in a bipartisan manner so that 
we can re-open the economy, hold China ac-
countable, secure our supply chain, and bring 
an end to the COVID–19 pandemic. I continue 
to be inspired by the steadfast commitment 
from the men and women that leave their fam-
ilies, risk their health, and go to their essential 
jobs every day so that we can continue fight-
ing this war.

CONGRATULATING HAYDEN MARIE 
MARCHANT 
ON 
HER 
EIGHTH- 
GRADE 
GRADUATION 
AT 
THE 
HOCKADAY SCHOOL ON MAY 21, 
2020 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my granddaughter, Hayden 
Marie Marchant, upon her eighth-grade grad-
uation at The Hockaday School on May 21, 
2020. Located within my congressional district 
in Dallas, Texas, Hockaday was founded in 
1913, and has since developed into a beacon 
of educational excellence that draws students 
from across the country and around the world. 
As Hayden successfully completes her mid-
dle school education, our family is proud to 
celebrate her impressive accomplishments. 
Aside from managing her academic respon-
sibilities, Hayden has proven to be a dedi-
cated athlete by participating in volleyball, bas-
ketball, soccer, and softball. Off the field, she 
has excelled in other extracurriculars, as dem-
onstrated by her multiple awards at the State 
Fair of Texas Lego competition and her recent 
portrayal of Von Hussler in Hockaday’s per-
formance of Mary Poppins. Hayden has also 
displayed an entrepreneurial spirit by launch-
ing her own business, ‘‘Rocking M Beads’’, 
which she continues to run and operate. Her 
friends and relatives all agree that she is out-
standing in her field. 
Students at Hockaday celebrate the conclu-
sion of their middle school experience by arriv-
ing at their graduation ceremony in traditional 
white dresses and listening to congratulatory 
remarks from the administration, faculty, and a 
chosen student speaker. This final event 
serves as a rite-of-passage that prepares stu-
dents to assume the added responsibilities of 
their upper-school years. 
Hayden continues to make her parents, 
Matthew and Lindsay, extremely proud. Her 
two sets of grandparents, Donna Marchant 
and myself, and Rod and Sherry Hill of Frisco, 
Texas, could not be prouder of the young 
woman that she is becoming. Hayden truly 
embodies the four cornerstones of The 
Hockaday School: character, courtesy, schol-
arship, and athletics. Our entire family is ex-
cited for Hayden’s continued progress. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Hayden Marchant and The Hockaday School 
Class of 2024 on their eighth-grade gradua-
tion. As every school across the nation has 
been negatively impacted over the past few 
months, I would also like to recognize the 
teachers, administrators, and support staff that 
have been working hard to meet the edu-
cational needs of our youth. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MS. 
CAROLINA WINSTON BARRIE 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Mrs. Carolina 
Winston Barrie—a beloved wife, mother, 
grandmother, great-grandmother, and dedi-
cated advocate for veterans from California’s 
33rd Congressional District. Carolina passed 
away on April 29, 2020 at the age of 92. 
Carolina was born on November 24, 1927 in 
Los Angeles, California. She attended Marl-
borough School and the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley. She was the epitome of a 
matriarch and walked through life with con-
fidence and strength. Not only was she adored 
by her family, but also by those whose lives 
she touched. 
She was the great-niece of Arcadia Bandini 
de Baker, who along with United States Sen-
ator John Percival Jones, donated the first 300 
acres that made up the Pacific Branch of the 
National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers 
and Sailors, now known as the West Los An-
geles VA campus. 
Carolina and other descendants of Arcadia 
have for decades tried to honor the gift their 
ancestors so patriotically donated, most re-
cently in 2016 by founding the 1887 Fund, a 
non-profit organization dedicated to the phys-
ical and spiritual restoration of the five historic 
properties on the West Los Angeles VA cam-
pus, including the Wadsworth Chapel. Her ad-
vocacy for the campus and veterans was un-
paralleled. In addition to overseeing the 1887 
Fund, she was an advisor to the Veterans and 
Community Oversight and Engagement Board, 
a federal advisory committee that made rec-
ommendations to the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs regarding the West Los Angeles VA 
Master Plan, as well as outreach and services 
for veterans. 
Carolina was a woman of faith, compassion, 
intelligence and wit. Her legacy, not only for 
her family, but also to veterans, will forever 
carry on through her efforts to have veterans 
return to their rightful home at the West Los 
Angeles VA campus. As Carolina once said, 
‘‘We don’t have to go back to 1887 to do right 
by our veterans.’’ 
Carolina was predeceased by her husband, 
George; her three sons: Winston, Juan, Mat-
thew; and her daughter, Louisa. She is sur-
vived by two daughters, Christine and Caro-
lina; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson. 
May Carolina’s memory be an inspiration and 
blessing to us all.

RECOGNIZING SOURCE VERO 
BEACH 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, COVID–19 
has created unprecedented challenges in each 
of our communities, but it has shown us what 
we have to be grateful for and who we should 
be grateful to. Today I would like to recognize 
a local homeless outreach ministry, The 
Source Vero Beach, whose volunteers have 
been working tirelessly to provide essential 
services to the needy in Indian River County, 
during this pandemic. 
The Source has been a community leader 
since its establishment in 1995 as a homeless 
ministry that provided free meals and Bible 
Study sessions in Indian River County. They 
have since grown into a comprehensive as-
sistance center that prides itself on providing 
essential services to people from all walks of 
life, no matter background or struggle. Wheth-
er it be a free dinner, clothing, counseling, 
showers, access to a telephone, or just a lis-
tening hear, they have welcomed anyone and 
everyone into their care. Now more than ever, 
the community relies on their assistance. 
While The Source faced its fair share of 
hardship during the pandemic in continuing 
many of these essential services, they saw an 
opportunity to invest in and give hope to those 
who have been recently displaced from work, 
developing a new culinary training program 
that feeds the community. This program called 
‘‘Dining with Dignity’’ provides these individ-
uals with 18 weeks of hands-on kitchen train-
ing, knife skills, financial literacy, interpersonal 
skills, and a weekly stipend. Upon completion 
of the program, participants receive a State of 
Florida 
ServSafe/SafeStaff 
certification, 
a 
graduation bonus, and job placement within 
the restaurant industry. 
This back-to-work program has seen major 
success so far, providing life-changing training 
to fight chronic unemployment caused by 
COVID–19, while delivering over 550 meals a 
day, 7 days a week to the needy. To thank for 
the development and implementation of the 
program, is Executive Director of The Source, 
Mr. Anthony Zorbaugh, along with the rest of 
the outreach staff who are dedicated to serv-
ing our community, no matter the challenges 
they face. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to please join me in recog-
nizing the staff of The Source Vero Beach for 
their altruism and public servant hearts. Our 
community will be forever grateful for their in-
vestment and service to those who need it 
most.

HONORING REAR ADMIRAL BRAD 
COOPER’S SERVICE TO HIS COUN-
TRY AS THE SECRETARY OF THE 
NAVY’S CHIEF OF LEGISLATIVE 
AFFAIRS 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to both recognize and congratulate Rear 
Admiral Brad Cooper for his service as he 
concludes his tour as the Secretary of the 
Navy’s Chief of Legislative Affairs. In this ca-
pacity, he oversaw and led a team of 40 Naval 
officers, sailors, and civilians helping set de-
partmental priorities and advancing the shared 
understanding of what our Navy continues to 
do in support of our Nation. 
I have had the distinct pleasure of getting to 
know Brad through my role as Chairman of 
the Seapower and Projection Forces Sub-
committee in various CODELs and oversight 
hearings. Last year alone, he personally ac-
companied me, and many other members of 
Congress, to the United Kingdom, Iceland and 
Norway to see first-hand how the Navy was 
conducting anti-submarine operations in the 
High North and to see the awe-inspiring work 
that our sailors were doing on the USS Dwight 
D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) off the coast of Flor-
ida. In various office calls and oversight en-
gagements, the quality of assistance given 
has been unrivaled. Simply said, my office, the 
House Committee on Armed Services and this 
entire chamber is better off due to Admiral 
Cooper’s service. 
A career surface warfare officer, Admiral 
Cooper has served in various ships including 
destroyers, cruisers, and aircraft carriers cul-
minating with command of USS Russell (DDG 
59) and USS Gettysburg (CG 64). To help ar-
ticulate the caliber of officer that Brad is, I will 
share this anecdote: Every year, the Navy 
awards the Battle E to the best ship in a given 
squadron. Brad, and the phenomenal teams 
he helps build, have achieved this award ten 
times. 
During his recent tenure as Chief of Legisla-
tive Affairs, Brad has served admirably 
through significant change while keeping the 
Navy’s 
Capitol 
Hill 
posture 
even-keeled 
through the tenures of multiple Navy leaders. 
His staff has flawlessly executed Congres-
sional Delegations throughout the world, sup-
ported hearings, and negotiated the NDAA 
while considering military, political, and budg-
etary priorities. His team works flawlessly, and 
is my, and many of my colleagues, staff of 
choice when dealing with defense issues. 
I believe Brad’s success is built on his un-
derstanding that what makes this country 
great is the ability to establish and keep rela-
tionships. This fundamental approach to his 
craft has gained respect and admiration in 
both chambers of Congress and on both sides 
of the aisle. He has worked with us to broaden 
the Navy’s outreach beyond just those mem-
bers of defense committees. His efforts, solidi-
fied alongside those of the Navy’s senior lead-
ers, exposed the House of Representatives to 
the great work our sailors are doing around 
the globe each and every day. 
As Admiral Cooper continues his Naval 
service, it is my hope that he may recall, with 
a deep sense of pride and accomplishment, 
the outstanding contributions he has made to 
the United States Navy as Chief of Legislative 
Affairs. I would like to send him, his wife, 
Susan, and their children, Bradford and Katie, 
my very best wishes for continued success in 
Norfolk and their future endeavors. 
Well done Admiral. Fair winds and following 
seas.

Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in Honor of Robert Silva who

Robert joined the Army to serve his country. 
He was a husband, father, grandfather, and 
devoted member of the Mendota community.

served. He was a champion during the reces-
sion years where the economy and numerous 
droughts severely impacted the agricultural in-
dustry and Mendota’s farmworker community. 
He fought to bring back businesses and his ef-
forts resulted in the restart of stalled construc-
tion of a federal prison and a scheduled 
groundbreaking of a solar-energy farm. Mr. 
Silva never stopped advocating for his com-
munity and in his last years as Mayor he was 
able to secure a donation for the Mendota 
Boys and Girls club that prevented it from 
closing. Ensuring that the children of Mendota 
retained a safe place where they could learn, 
play, and grow as well as be provided with a 
daily nutritious meal. 
As one of the founders of the Latino Water 
Coalition Mr. Silva made sure that the voice of 
his community, and indeed the voice of all the 
Fresno Westside communities, was heard, 
and their needs brought to the attention of the 
media. He proudly defended his community 
because he knew that even though they are 
smaller than other communities, his was made 
up of hardworking people who were just as 
deserving as any other. The City of Mendota 
chose to honor Mr. Silva in 2018 for his serv-
ice to the City as the longest serving mayor by 
dedicating a newly built plaza in his honor. 
The Mendota community has experienced 
an immense loss, but his spirit lives on 
through the lives he touched. He was a man 
of great integrity whose dedication and con-
tributions to the Mendota community are innu-
merable. He will always be remembered, and 
his leadership will be missed. Mr. Silva leaves 
behind his wife Mary, their children and grand-
children.

May 22, 2020 
RECOGNIZING MELINDA STENTOFT 
OF SCOBEY 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Melinda Stentoft of Scobey for 
providing Eastern Montana’s health care pro-
viders with personal protective equipment dur-
ing the COVID–19 outbreak. 
Let me start of by saying Melinda wants ev-
erybody to know she doesn’t think she de-
serves this recognition. She said, ‘‘I just hon-
estly felt like it needed to be done.’’ 
That speaks volumes to the type of person 
Melinda is. She owns a boutique in Scobey, 
Montana. 
Once 
the 
COVID–19 
outbreak 
forced everyone indoors and businesses, like 
hers, to close their doors, business really 
started picking up on line. In fact, her numbers 
doubled in the past two months. 
But through all this success, she saw the 
harsh reality of the coronavirus and its impact 
on her community, state, and nation. When 
health care providers indicated they had an 
immediate need for PPE, Melinda realized 
there was a way she could help. 
Melinda’s boutique sells cloth masks to the 
public. She says everyone was ordering them, 
so she pledged to help with Eastern Mon-
tana’s health care PPE shortage. For every 
five masks her business sold, she would do-
nate two to health care systems like Daniels 
Memorial in Scobey, Roosevelt Memorial in 
Culbertson, and the Billings Clinic. Thanks to 
her efforts, hundreds of masks will be deliv-
ered to protect providers. 
This unprecedented time has reminded 
Melinda of her childhood when, she says, peo-
ple were so close, and the sense of a tight- 
knit community came back because of the out-
break. Instead of rushing all the time, Melinda 
feels people are taking more time to talk to 
each other, and she loves how people have 
found their own way to help. 
Madam Speaker, for identifying the needs of 
her community and selflessly giving back, I 
recognize Melinda Stentoft of Scobey for her 
Spirit of Montana.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF EL NUEVO DI´A NEWS-
PAPER 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize an 
important anniversary in Puerto Rican jour-
nalism. 
Fifty years ago, what is today the leading 
newspaper in Puerto Rico, El Nuevo Dı´a, was 
launched under the direction of the late editor 
Carlos Castan˜eda. It was his vision and lead-
ership that transformed one of our older re-
gionally-oriented 
papers 
into 
a 
major 
islandwide publication, marking a new era in 
the Puerto Rico press. 
During its half century of existence El Nuevo 
Dı´a newspaper has been home to valued and 
respected 
reporters, 
commenters, 
photojournalists, analysts and writers. I con-
gratulate each one of these distinguished indi-
viduals who have helped make El Nuevo Dı´a 
newspaper what it is today—from the many 
figures long established when the paper came 
into existence, to those who made their ca-
reers reporting for El Nuevo Dı´a newspaper, to 
those who have moved on to other outlets, to 
those who are just getting started. It is their 
collective efforts that have kept the record of 
moments of joy and of pain, of achievements 
and challenges, of history in the making, often 
pioneering new ways to cover daily news, poli-
tics, economics and business, sport and cul-
tural events. Even today, as we face this on-
going pandemic, El Nuevo Dı´a newspaper 
continues to find innovative ways to bring 
timely news to the people of Puerto Rico and 
beyond. 
A dynamic free press is essential to a dy-
namic free society and its role is vital in the 
process of informing the people and of main-
taining accountability, especially in times of 
uncertainty. I wish to congratulate the Ferre´ 
Rangel family and the whole family of El 
Nuevo Dı´a newspaper, past and present, on 
this anniversary, and extend my best wishes 
to continue a path of success.

RECOGNIZING AARON BAXTER 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize Aaron Baxter for his out-
standing work in the ICU at the University of 
Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
Aaron began his career in health care at 
UAMS in 2015 as a patient care technician 
after working in the energy and manufacturing 
sectors. While working as a patient care tech-
nician, Aaron attended nursing school and ob-
tained his RN. 
With the current pandemic, Aaron has taken 
on yet another role in his unit, working as both 
a COVID nurse and a dofficer, where his role 
is to help colleagues make sure they are prop-
erly using and removing their protective equip-
ment. 
His previous experience working with high 
voltage powerlines and steel fabrication has 
provided him with the ability to carefully mon-
itor and identify safety issues during this proc-
ess. 
Aaron’s superiors say that he is a team 
player who stands out due to his high regard 
for patient care and safety. 
I thank Aaron for his dedication to protecting 
the health of Arkansans during this time. He, 
and frontline workers like him, are vital to us 
overcoming COVID–19 as a nation.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL 
MARITIME DAY 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize May 22nd as National Mar-
itime Day. On this occasion, we are especially 
proud of Michigan’s status as a maritime in-
dustry powerhouse, which we owe to the 
many men and women who drive commerce 
on our beautiful Great Lakes. According to the 
American Maritime Partnership, this industry 
provides Michigan’s economy with an annual 
$2.8 billion, in addition to $703.6 million in 
worker income and 12,140 jobs. 
Michigan’s First District features more coast-
line than any other congressional district in the 
contiguous United States, and is home to the 
Great Lakes Maritime Academy in Traverse 
City, which continues to supply our waterways 
with the next generation of Merchant Marine 
officers. We have no shortage of reasons to 
celebrate this day and the proud maritime tra-
ditions of the Great Lakes. 
While the circumstances of today and our 
nation’s fight against the coronavirus make it 
difficult for anyone to participate in festivities, 
National Maritime Day 2020 is celebrated in 
spirit by our brave essential workers who 
are—at this moment—navigating ships, run-
ning ports, and operating locks. And as of this 
month, there are now those who are building 
a new lock in the Soo Locks complex. This 
historic milestone, as well as the jobs, growth, 
and security that will come with the new lock’s 
completion, are well worth celebrating on this 
commemorative day. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring National Maritime Day and the 
millions of individuals across the Great Lakes 
who maintain our national security by keeping 
our nation’s economic engine running, even in 
these most trying times.

KAY MARTINEZ-ACOSTA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 22, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kay Martinez-Acosta, who 
after 30 years of teaching, is retiring. Kay’s 
dedication to education in the Jefferson Coun-
ty School District and to the State of Colorado 
has made a significant impact on students 
which will last for years to come. 
Kay Martinez-Acosta was born and raised in 
Denver, Colorado. Growing up, Kay was 
known for being an exceptional student and 
avid reader. She was committed to her chosen 
career path at a young age. Kay always knew 
she wanted to be a teacher. After she grad-
uated from Marycrest High School in 1986, 
she received a scholarship and enrolled in the 
teacher’s program at the University of North-
ern Colorado. She received her bachelors de-
gree in Elementary Education in 1990 and did 
her student teaching with Denver Public 
Schools. In 1991, Kay accepted her first ele-
mentary school teaching position with Jeffco 
Public Schools and remained with the district 
throughout her career. She taught at Eiber El-
ementary School, Sierra Elementary School 
and 
has 
been 
currently 
teaching 
at 
Vanderhoof Elementary School for 24 years! 
In 1992, Kay married her husband Lee 
Acosta and they moved to Arvada, Colorado 
and raised two daughters, all while maintain-
ing her teaching career and continuing her 
education. In 1999, Kay received her Masters 
of Education in Curriculum and Development

from the University of Phoenix. In addition, 
she received an English Language Learner 
endorsement. Kay has made a difference 
teaching first, second and third graders, touch-
ing the lives of more than 750 school children 
during her notable career. She has even 
taught two generations of Jeffco families. I sa-
lute Kay on her retirement from 30 years of 
teaching in the field of elementary education 
and thank her for her incredible service to our 
community. 
Kay’s contribution to the Jefferson County 
School District and the Jefferson County com-
munity is remarkable. I congratulate Kay on a 
lifetime of service and wish her all the best in 
retirement.
