prayer: 
Lord, our God, how can we keep our 
thoughts, our words, our lives pure? 
Speak Your word to us in ways that 
we can hear and understand, that we 
would choose to think, speak, and live 
accordingly. 
May we seek You with our whole 
being and not allow our fear, our frus-
trations, or our lack of faith to hold us 
back from following You. 
May we not go astray from Your per-
fect will and find ourselves lost and 
helpless, ensnared in our own selfish 
volition and far from Your divine pro-
tection. 
With our lips may we praise You. 
With our lives may we rejoice in You. 
With our hearts may we delight in 
You, live in Your ways, and remain in 
Your presence each hour of this day. 
In the certainty of Your abiding love 
we pray. 
Amen.

IN RECOGNITION OF SAMUEL 
WORLEY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Samuel Worley as 
he celebrates his 100th birthday on June 13, 
2021. For nearly a century, Sam has dedi-
cated his life to public service. It is my privi-
lege to recognize his life and achievements 
ahead of this milestone. 
Born near Fannettsburg, Pennsylvania, Sam 
Worley proudly served as a member of the 
U.S. Army 8th Air Corps. During World War II, 
he worked in intelligence while stationed in 
England. 
Upon returning home, Sam Worley married 
his wife, June, and they raised two children, In 
Franklin County, Sam continued to serve our 
community. During his career in banking, Sam 
also was an active volunteer with the YMCA, 
Kiwanis Club, American Legion, Masonic fra-
ternity, and the Chambersburg Borough Coun-
cil. Sam was elected to serve as Franklin 
County Commissioner from 1988 to 1996, and 
then continued to serve our community as the 
Mayor of Chambersburg for eight years. 
As he marks this great milestone, I am 
grateful to Sam Worley for his continued dedi-
cation to our Nation and to Franklin County. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, 
it is my privilege to honor Sam for his many 
contributions and wish him continued health 
and happiness.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
LEOPOLDO TREVIN˜ O-GUERRA 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Leopoldo Trevin˜o-Guerra, who 
passed away on March 25, 2021. As a cham-
pion of farmworkers and the Latino commu-
nity, Leopoldo devoted his life to giving voice 
to the voiceless and fighting for what is right. 
His story is an inspiration to us all, and his im-
pact will undoubtedly be felt for generations to 
come. 
Leopoldo’s advocacy first began when his 
family settled in the Coachella Valley in the 
1970s. There, he became a member of the 
United Farm Workers (UFW) and helped ne-
gotiate the first collective employment contract 
with the lemon agribusiness. As the chief rep-
resentative of UFW in this landmark negotia-
tion, Leopoldo was instrumental in securing 
workers’ rights, including eight-hour workdays, 
rest periods, and higher wages. 
His tireless will and unmatched strength 
have made the Coachella Valley a better 
place for everyone who lives there. As a prin-
cipal founder of the Housing Rent Control 
Movement, he secured better conditions for 
farmworker housing—improving the quality of 
life for hundreds of families in our commu-
nities. 
Leopoldo was a true trailblazer. In 1988, he 
co-founded the first entirely Spanish-language 
newspaper 
in 
the 
Coachella 
Valley, 
El 
Informador 
del 
Valle. 
To 
this 
day, 
El 
Informador del Valle delivers news to the 
Latino community in the Coachella and Impe-
rial Valleys. Leopoldo’s unrelenting pursuit of 
justice led him to establish his second Span-
ish-language newspaper seven years later. El 
Independiente actively covered social justice 
work in the Latino community until 2008. With 
his excellent leadership and vision at both 
newspapers, Leopoldo successfully uplifted 
Latino voices throughout the region. 
Leopoldo faced numerous hardships in his 
life, but he overcame the obstacles that stood 
in his way to create a better future for his fam-
ily. His 19 children, 44 grandchildren, and 34 
great grandchildren are a testament to his out-
standing legacy. Leopoldo’s story is an exam-
ple of the excellence, dedication, and service 
to our Nation that all should seek to emulate.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
GRANT 
COTTAGE HISTORIC SITE AS IT 
IS 
DESIGNATED 
A 
NATIONAL 
HISTORIC LANDMARK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the christening of the 
Grant Cottage Historic Site as a National His-
toric Landmark. This home was the final dwell-
ing place of the 18th President of the United 
States, Ulysses S. Grant, and continues to be 
of great historical significance. 
Ulysses S. Grant rose to prominence during 
the American Civil War where he played a piv-
otal role in the defeat of the Confederate 
Army. In 1863, then-President Lincoln pro-
moted Grant to Major General and then in 
1864, Lieutenant General, holding command 
over all Union Armies. After the Civil War, 
Grant was elected as the 18th President of the 
United States in 1868 and is largely credited 
with reunifying the North and South. During 
his tenures, he created the Justice Depart-
ment and oversaw the ratification of the 15th 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which 
prohibited denying any citizen the right to vote 
based on race, color, or previous condition of 
servitude. 
The Grant Cottage Historic Site serves as 
both an educational experience, recounting 
Grant’s storied place in American History, and 
a time-capsule, displaying artifacts untouched 
since the day of his death. This cottage, at the 
top of Mount McGregor, served as a refuge for 
Grant and his family in his final days and is 
where the former President completed his 
autobiography, Personal Memoirs of U.S. 
Grant, just days before his death. After years 
of advocacy to the National Park Service, I am 
proud to stand in support with the Friends of 
the Ulysses S. Grant Cottage as this site is 
designated a National Historic Landmark. This 
designation ensures that the site will be eligi-
ble for federal funding to preserve and protect 
this important piece of history. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I am 
honored to recognize the work of the Friends 
of the Ulysses S. Grant Cottage for their dedi-
cation and perseverance in promoting this his-
toric landmark. Their work will ensure that 
generations to come are able to visit the Cot-
tage and recall the great importance of know-
ing our Nation’s history.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAPLETON 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and thank the 
Mapleton Fire Department in Huntingdon 
County for its 100 years of service to our com-
munity. 
Organized on May 13, 1921, the original fire 
company was comprised of 36 volunteers. 
Since then, the Mapleton Volunteer Fire De-
partment and its iconic green fire trucks have 
been a staple in the Huntingdon County com-
munity. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to calls 
ranging from structure fires to medical emer-
gencies. These brave men and women show 
their commitment to our community through 
their diverse and often-difficult work. 
For the past century, volunteer firefighters in 
Mapleton have worked tirelessly to protect life 
and property. As they mark this incredible 
achievement, I am grateful to the Mapleton 
firefighters for their steadfast service to our 
community and I wish them continued safety 
and success.

community. She joined Harnett County in 1996 
as Director of Information Technology and re-
tires after three years as County Manager. Ap-
pointed in 2018 by the Harnett County Board 
of Commissioners, Mrs. Stewart is the first 
woman to serve as County Manager. 
Mrs. Stewart has led a career of distinction 
and is a strong and effective leader. During 
her tenure with Harnett County, she improved 
customer service, expanded access to public 
services, enhanced public communications, 
and managed growth by embracing new op-
portunities while preserving the rich history of 
our community. She is credited with revising 
Harnett County’s fiscal policy, coordinating re-
sponse efforts to emergency events such as 
Hurricane Florence and the coronavirus pan-
demic, and oversaw construction of the 
Harnett County Resource Center and Library. 
Renee and I would like to extend our most 
heartfelt appreciation to Mrs. Stewart for her 
years of exemplary service to Harnett County, 
which is a better place today due to her work. 
I know I speak for our entire community in 
wishing her and her family continued success 
and happiness as they move on to their next 
great adventure. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring County Manager Paula Stewart for 
25 years of service to Harnett County.

HONORING 
BOUNTHIENG 
EGKHOUNMOUNG AS IOWAN OF 
THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor 
Master 
Sergeant 
Bounthieng 
Egkhounmoung, a recently retired veteran, as 
Iowan of the Week. Bounthieng, or BJ as he’s 
known, retired last week from the 132nd Wing 
of the Iowa Air National Guard after over a 
total of 38 years in service to the country and 
the state of Iowa. 
From the Marine Corps, Air National Guard, 
and the State of Iowa, BJ served his country 
through nearly four decades. He retires as a 
Master Sergeant from the 132nd Wing of the 
Iowa Air National Guard. The 132nd Wing, 
founded in 1941, has deployed in numerous 
conflicts throughout the world and played a 
critical role in our state’s flood recovery over 
the last few decades. Their values of Integrity 
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in 
All We Do was exemplified by BJ throughout 
his service. 
As Asian Pacific American Heritage Month 
comes to an end, may we celebrate the diver-
sity in our country and reflect on the chal-
lenges many in the Asian American and Pa-
cific Islander communities still experience. 
BJ’s exemplary service to our country and 
lived the military values of duty, honor, and 
country. To quote General MacArthur who was 
reflecting on his own 30 years of military serv-
ice said ‘‘Those three hallowed words (duty, 
honor, country) reverently dictate what you 
ought to be, what you can be, what you will 
be. They are your rallying points: to build cour-
age when courage seems to fail; to regain 
faith when there seems to be little cause for 
faith; to create hope when hope becomes for-
lorn.’’ Master Sergeant BJ embodied these 
values in his 38 years of service. 
Our country is safe and our communities 
are secure thanks to the service of the over 
20 million veterans and active service mem-
bers that protect our nation, including BJ’s 
service. As I rise today in honor of BJ, I en-
courage everyone to reach out to veterans 
and military families in your life, hear their sto-
ries, and give your thanks. I will continue to 
work across the aisle in Congress, such as my 
recently passed Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans’ 
Mental Health Act, to ensure our veterans get 
the care they need and deserve. 
It is my honor to recognize BJ for his nearly 
four decades of outstanding service to our 
country. I thank BJ for his service, and I hope 
he has an enjoyable retirement.

NORTHERN 
MARIANA 
ISLANDS 
AND AMERICAN SAMOA COLLEGE 
ACCESS ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Northern Mariana Islands and 
American Samoa College Access Act, which 
would authorize tuition assistance grants to 
cover the difference between in-state and out- 
of-state tuition costs for Northern Marianas 
and American Samoa community college 
graduates seeking to attend a four-year public 
university. 
The importance of having an educated citi-
zenry is a bedrock principle of our nation and 
has been since our founding. And in today’s 
competitive job market, a postsecondary edu-
cation is increasingly becoming a critical ne-
cessity for obtaining a decent job with a de-
cent wage. 
The Northern Mariana Islands has only 
been part of America for forty years. We un-
derstand well that education is key to our con-
tinued growth, but the reality is that household 
incomes in the Northern Marianas are less 
than half the national median. The U.S. terri-
tory of American Samoa is in similar economic 
straits. Poverty and unemployment rates there 
are among the highest in the country. 
I believe the best way to improve economic 
conditions in these territories is to improve the 
educational opportunities of our residents. Un-
fortunately, however, neither the Northern 
Marianas nor American Samoa has a four- 
year institution of higher education. In fact, 
they are the only two congressional districts in 
the country without a public four-year college 
or university. Each has an accredited commu-
nity college, but academic offerings are sub-
stantially limited. 
Students from these U.S. territories wanting 
the advantages of a four-year university in an-
other state or territory face significant financial 
difficulty. Nonresident students spend an aver-
age of $16,380 in out-of state tuition and fees 
more per year than their resident peers at 
public four-year colleges, according to College 
Board. And many students in the Marianas 
and American Samoa wanting to attend a 
four-year university not only face the cost-of- 
nonresident-tuition, but also the significant ex-
pense of travel. The Marianas are over 3,700 
miles from the nearest state, Hawaii—a 
$1,100 one-way trip by plane. American 
Samoa to Hawaii is over 2,500 miles, over 
$800 one-way. 
The bill follows the model of P.L. 106–98, 
the D.C. College Access Act, which allows 
students residing in the District of Columbia to 
apply for grants to help pay the cost of attend-
ing colleges outside D.C., but much smaller in 
scope and cost. It creates a program through 
which public four-year schools in the 50 
states, D.C., and other U.S. territories may be 
reimbursed for offering in-state tuition to un-
dergraduate students from the Northern Mar-
iana Islands and American Samoa. 
The gentlewoman from American Samoa, 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN, is an original cosponsor of 
the bill. I urge my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan legislation and help give students 
from the Northern Marianas and American 
Samoa the means needed to make their edu-
cational dreams a reality.

UNITED

SERVICE 
ACADEMY- 
BOUND STUDENTS 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, it is my 
great honor to come before my colleagues 
today to recognize those young men and 
women from Texas’ Third Congressional Dis-
trict who have accepted an appointment to 
one of our prestigious United States Service 
Academies. I am honored to have this oppor-
tunity to congratulate these young patriots and 
wish them success as they strive to fulfill their 
maximum potential in defending our nation. 
The United States Services Academies 
have a long-standing tradition of offering its 
students the highest caliber education and offi-
cer military training in the world. Each of the 
individuals recognized today began their jour-
ney of service by applying through their Mem-
ber of Congress or qualified source via a high-
ly competitive process. However, only a select 
few are found to meet the necessary stand-
ards set forth by the Academies. 
These outstanding students have proven 
they are the gold standard by demonstrating 
their excellence in academics, athletics, and 
commitment to their community both inside 
and outside of the classroom. I am confident 
these young men and women will achieve 
great success while further developing the 
qualities of leadership, honor, and self-sac-
rifice as they prepare to lead our Nation’s 
Armed Forces. 
As one who has worn the uniform, I thank 
these young patriots for their courage, convic-
tion, and commitment to our Nation, and it is 
my privilege to congratulate these leaders as 
they embark on this new mission of service.

INTRODUCTION OF THE TOTAL 
RECALL ACT OF 2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Total Recall 
Act of 2021, which would require businesses 
to strengthen and streamline notifications for 
product recalls to consumers. 
Every year, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) recalls at least 400 prod-
ucts, but due to poor notification practices by 
manufacturers and producers, the average re-
sponse rate of consumers for most recalls is 
only between 4 and 18 percent. Consumers 
are purchasing or failing to stop using prod-
ucts because they are unaware of recall notifi-
cations. 
As a mom myself, I know that parents can-
not be expected to check the CPSC website 
every time they purchase a product for their 
families. If a company sells a dangerous item, 
that company should be expected to market 
the recall as aggressively as they marketed 
the sale of the product. 
That is why I am introducing the Total Re-
call Act, legislation which will implement much 
needed reforms to increase the effectiveness 
of products recalled by the CPSC. This bill will 
increase requirements for companies to post 
recall notices on their websites and social 
media, and require or encourage companies 
to use parts of the original marketing budgets 
of the product in question on notifying con-
sumers of the recall. 
The numbers don’t lie; if consumers are not 
participating in recalls, then companies need 
to work harder to let their consumers know 
about any dangers that they face from contin-
ued use of these products. Companies know 
how to market products, it is time for them to 
apply those same skills to marketing recalls. 
2021 PA18 CONGRESSIONAL ART 
COMPETITION 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
artistic ability of a young high school student 
from my Congressional District, Makenzie Sing 
from the Pittsburgh Creative and Performing 
Arts School. 
Ms. Sing is the winner of the 2021 18th 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania’s High 
School Art Competition, ‘‘An Artistic Discovery. 
‘‘Ms. Sing’s artwork, a mixed media collage 
with pen and ink entitled ‘‘Portrait of Truths,’’ 
was selected from a number of outstanding 
entries to this year’s competition. In fact, 20 
works from 4 different schools in Pennsylva-
nia’s 18th Congressional District were sub-
mitted to our panel of respected local artists. 
It’s a real tribute to Ms. Sing’s skill and vision 
that their work was chosen as the winner of 
this year’s competition. 
Ms. Sing’s artwork will represent the 18th 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania in the 
national exhibit of high school students’ art-
work that will be displayed in the United 
States Capitol over the coming year. I encour-
age my colleagues, as well as any visitor to 
Capitol Hill, to view Ms. Sing’s artwork, along 
with the winning entries from the high school 
art contests held in other Congressional Dis-
tricts, which will be on display in the Capitol 
tunnel. It is amazing to walk through this cor-
ridor and see the interpretation of life through 
the eyes of these young artists from all across 
our country. 
Lillian Spencer from the Pittsburgh Creative 
and Performing Arts School was awarded sec-
ond place for their color pencil composition 
‘‘Seeing Eye to Eye.’’ Nathan Weaver from 
CAPA received third place for their acrylic 
painting entitled ‘‘Miners.’’ Bina Guo from the 
Pittsburgh 
Creative 
and 
Performing 
Arts 
School was awarded fourth place for their wa-
tercolor and pencil composition entitled ‘‘Or-
ganic Ruin,’’ and Margaret Tracht from CAPA 
received the fifth-place award for their pen on 
paper composition ‘‘Overgrown.’’ 
For the first time this year, we posted all of 
the entries online and allowed people to vote 
for their favorite one. Over the course of sev-
eral weeks, more than 400 people voted for 
their favorite entry. ‘‘Unclear,’’ a watercolor by 
Zoe McCoy from South Fayette High School, 
was the overwhelming favorite with just under 
20 percent of the votes cast, and so Zoe was 
the winner of our first ‘‘People’s Choice’’ 
award. 
In addition, Honorable Mention Awards were 
presented to works by Yutaka Tomokio from 
the Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts 
School, Zoe McCoy from South Fayette High 
School, and Annika Vaughan from the Pitts-
burgh Creative and Performing Arts School. 
I would like to recognize all of the partici-
pants in this year’s 18th Congressional District 
High School Art Competition, ‘‘An Artistic Dis-
covery:’’ from Allderdice High School, Sean

RECOGNIZING WARD TRANSPORT 
& LOGISTICS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ward Transport & 
Logistics for its longstanding dedication to our 
central Pennsylvania community as it cele-
brates 90 years of service. For decades, this 
nationally recognized trucking company has 
been instrumental in supplying and sustaining 
our local economy. 
Since W. W. Ward founded the company in 
1931, Ward Transport & Logistics has grown 
substantially and now operates 20 locations 
across the northeastern United States. This 
success is testament to the hard work and 
dedication of the Ward family. Ninety years 
later, Ward Transport & Logistics is now led 
by the fourth generation of the Ward family 
and it employs more than 1,400 workers in 
Pennsylvania and beyond. 
As the company has expanded, its commu-
nity outreach also has grown. Ward Hearts & 
Hands is a volunteer program overseen by 
employees with a heart for service. Their work 
to support critical community projects includes 
setting up charity events, serving meals and 
partnering with local food banks, delivering 
supplies to elderly members of the Blair Coun-
ty community, and fostering a children’s men-
toring program to grow the next generation of 
talent in our community. 
Throughout their work to provide essential 
services, Ward Transport & Logistics has gone 
above and beyond in support of the Blair 
County community. As the Ward family and 
their entire team celebrate 90 years of service, 
I congratulate Ward Transport & Logistics on 
this outstanding legacy and wish them contin-
ued success.

CONGRATULATING 
INDIANA 
SEC-
RETARY 
OF 
STATE 
CONNIE 
LAWSON ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate former Indiana Secretary 
of State Connie Lawson on her recent retire-
ment and to thank her for many years of dedi-
cated service to Hoosiers. 
Throughout her years of public service, 
Connie has dedicated herself to moving Indi-
ana forward. She was elected to the Indiana 
State Senate in 1996, and, in 2006, she be-
came the first woman to serve as Senate Ma-
jority Floor Leader. In 2012, she was ap-
pointed to serve as Indiana’s 61st Secretary of 
State. In these roles, she worked tirelessly to 
strengthen our communities and advance op-
portunities for future generations. Connie truly 
made our state a better place for Hoosiers to 
live, work, and thrive. 
I am grateful to have worked with Connie on 
behalf of our state’s businesses, workers, fam-
ilies, and voters. Her strong conservative val-
ues and Hoosier common sense have helped 
bring Indiana’s businesses into the 21st cen-
tury and ensured our elections remained free, 
fair, and secure. Her unmatched leadership, 
tenacity, and integrity, both in the Indiana Sen-
ate and as Secretary of State, have helped 
secure Indiana’s status as an economic pow-
erhouse. With a AAA credit rating, fiscally re-
sponsible budget, and low unemployment rate, 
our state is among the best places in the 
country to start and grow a business. 
Governor Eric Holcomb has dubbed Connie 
‘‘Indiana’s own Iron Lady,’’ and I couldn’t 
agree more. She is a true patriot with a serv-
ant’s heart, and her passion for helping her 
fellow Hoosiers has always been clear. I have 
no doubt her legacy will last far into the future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking Indiana’s 61st Secretary of 
State Connie Lawson for her lifelong commit-
ment to serving our communities. On behalf of 
2nd District Hoosiers, I wish her the best as 
she embarks on this next chapter in life.

COMMEMORATING THE 77TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF D-DAY AND RE-
MEMBERING THE MEMBERS OF 
THE 
GREATEST 
GENERATION 
WHO SAVED FREEDOM IN THE 
WORLD 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, to-
morrow, June 6, marks the 77th anniversary of 
D-Day, the Allied Forces’ audacious amphib-
ious landing at Normandy, France, on June 6, 
1944. 
This joint undertaking to liberate the con-
tinent of Europe from the clutches of an evil 
aggressor enemy was the first and most em-
phatic demonstration of the invincible strength 
of democratic nations when acting collectively. 
For more than 70 years, peace in Europe 
has been secured and no adversary, not the 
old Soviet Union or the contemporary Russian 
Federation, has dared to risk war by attacking 
a European ally of the United States because 
every American president has made clear that 
the United States is committed to Article V of 
the North Atlantic Treaty which holds that an 
attack on any NATO member is regarded as 
an attack on all of them. 
Madam Speaker, Operation Overlord, as D- 
Day was formally known, was the largest sin-
gle amphibious assault in the history of war-
fare. 
The success of D-Day, which was far from 
certain at the outset, led to the liberation of 
Western Europe, signaled the death knell of 
the German Wehrmacht, and paved the way 
to unconditional victory by the Allied Forces 
over the evils of Nazism, fascism, and Japa-
nese imperialism. 
It is no exaggeration to say that D-Day 
changed the course of human history. 
The aim of the meticulously planned D-Day 
operation was to open a second front in the 
European war theater from which the Allied 
Forces could attack the German army and 
push east to capture Berlin. 
With the Russian Army advancing from the 
east, coupled with the southern front opened 
by the Allied invasion of Italy from North Africa 
in 1942, the opening of a western front would 
set in motion the pincer movement that would 
catch the German Army in a trap from which 
there would be no escape. 
The formidable German Army expected that 
the Allied Forces would try to launch an inva-
sion from the western beaches of France. 
They just did not know when or where. 
So, in anticipation of an Allied invasion, the 
Nazis constructed the infamous Atlantic Wall, 
an extensive system of coastal fortifications 
built along the western coast of Europe and 
Scandinavia. 
Under the direction of Field Marshal Rom-
mel, the Atlantic Wall was reinforced by the 
addition of concrete pillboxes built along the 
beaches to house machine guns, antitank 
guns and light artillery. 
Mines and antitank obstacles were planted 
on the beaches themselves and underwater 
obstacles and mines were placed in waters 
just offshore. 
By the time of the D-Day landing, the Nazis 
had laid almost six million mines in northern 
France. 
And awaiting Allied soldiers who made their 
way onto and away from the beaches were 
gun emplacements and minefields extended 
inland. 
‘‘War is hell,’’ said General William Tecum-
seh Sherman during the Civil War. 
And that is an apt description of what await-
ed the brave Allied warriors who set sail from 
England to the beaches of Normandy in the 
early morning of June 6, 1944, at the begin-
ning of what has rightly been called ‘‘The 
Longest Day.’’ 
But they were buoyed in their resolve by the 
millions of prayers from Americans and others 
back home, of all races, religions, and creeds, 
invoking the Lord’s blessing, mercy, and 
grace. 
With the outcome in doubt, President Frank-
lin Roosevelt asked the nation to join him in 
this solemn prayer: 
‘‘Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our na-
tion, this day have set upon a mighty 
endeavor, a struggle to preserve our 
Republic, our religion, and our civiliza-
tion, and to set free a suffering human-
ity. 
‘‘Lead them straight and true; give strength 
to their arms, stoutness to their 
hearts, steadfastness in their faith. 
‘‘They will need Thy blessings. 
‘‘For these men are lately drawn from the 
ways of peace. 
‘‘They fight not for the lust of conquest. 
‘‘They fight to end conquest. 
‘‘They fight to liberate. 
‘‘They fight to let justice arise, and toler-
ance and goodwill among all Thy peo-
ple. 
‘‘They yearn but for the end of battle, for 
their return to the haven of home.’’

The prayers were needed because the cost 
of D-Day was high; U.S. casualties on D-Day 
totaled more than 2,499 dead, 3,184 wound-
ed, 1,928 missing, and 26 captured. 
Our British and Canadian allies suffered ter-
rible losses on D-Day as well: approximately 
2,700 for the British and 946 for the Cana-
dians. 
German casualties are estimated at 4,000 to 
9,000. 
In total, the number of combatants killed, 
wounded or missing in the Battle of Normandy 
for both sides exceeded 425,000, not including 
the estimated 15,000 to 20,000 French civil-
ians killed. 
But the operation was a success. 
More than 156,000 troops or paratroopers 
came ashore on D-Day, 73,000 from the U.S., 
83,000 from Great Britain and Canada. 
By the end of June 11, D-Day plus 5, 
326,547 troops, 54,186 vehicles and 104,428 
tons of supplies had come ashore. 
And with them came the seeds for the vic-
tory in Europe that would come less than a 
year later, on May 8, 1945, with the fall of Ber-
lin and the unconditional surrender of the 
Nazis. 
On the eve of the Normandy invasion, Gen-
eral Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme 
Commander of the Allied Forces, addressed 
the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied 
Expeditionary Forces and said to them that 
they were about to embark upon a ‘‘Great 
Crusade,’’ and that the ‘‘eyes of the world’’ 
were upon them. 
He told them that their task would not be 
easy because the ‘‘enemy is well trained, well 
equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight 
savagely.’’ 
But General Eisenhower said, ‘‘this is the 
year 1944. The tide has turned. The free men 
of the world are marching together to victory.’’ 
And march to victory they did, fully justifying 
General Eisenhower’s ‘‘confidence in their 
courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle.’’ 
Because of the heroism of these men who 
willingly risked their lives to be the tip of the 
spear of liberty, the war was won, and a world 
was saved for freedom. 
Madam Speaker, D-Day was, and remains, 
a day like no other in the history of man’s so-
journ on earth. 
We remember Gettysburg. 
There, President Lincoln paid tribute to 
those ‘‘who gave their lives so that the nation 
might live.’’ 
It is equally fitting and proper that we never 
forget D-Day and that we continue to honor 
those who risked all and gave all so that the 
light of freedom would never be extinguished 
in the world.

HONORING 
JOHN 
REMILLARD, 
PRESIDENT OF ELIZABETHTOWN 
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, ON HIS 
WELL-DESERVED RETIREMENT 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor John Remillard on his retire-
ment from the Elizabethtown Community Hos-
pital. 
John joined the University of Vermont 
Health Network as President of both the Eliza-
bethtown Community Hospital and the hospital 
in Ticonderoga 5 years ago. Since then, John 
has helped the hospital through renovations, 
additions, and restructuring. He has shown 
steadfast leadership in the face of great chal-
lenges, 
most 
notably 
throughout 
the 
Coronavirus Pandemic. I have had the pleas-
ure of working with John in the interest of the 
people of the 21st Congressional District, en-
suring that the hospitals received necessary 
federal funding and supplies. I am grateful for 
the sacrifice and hard work that John and the 
entire Elizabethtown Community Hospital staff 
put into keeping our community safe and 
healthy. 
As a federally designated critical access 
hospital, Elizabethtown Community Hospital 
provides vital care to the surrounding areas. 
John has faced unique challenges working in 
the rural healthcare field and yet, he continued 
to relentlessly pursue providing access to high 
quality care for all who walked through the 
hospital’s doors. For more than 30 years work-
ing in the healthcare field, John has been a 
caring and compassionate leader, under-
standing that it truly takes a village. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate John on 
reaching this important milestone. John has 
left a significant impact on our community and 
improved access to healthcare in our rural dis-
trict. I wish him well in this next chapter of his 
life.

IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICK G. 
HIMES, SR. 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my District Manager 
Patrick G. Himes, Sr., for his service to Penn-
sylvania’s 13th Congressional District. An Al-
toona native, Pat has worked alongside me 
since the beginning of my service in Con-
gress. 
During his tenure, Pat has been an integral 
member of my team as he worked with Penn-
sylvanians on the ground and led our district 
operations. Under his leadership, our team 
has delivered substantial results for the people 
of Pennsylvania—from leading outreach to 
constituents and supporting our local commu-
nities to cutting through red tape with federal 
agencies. During the uncertain days of 2020, 
Pat ensured that our district team continued to 
safely provide uninterrupted services. 
Every day, Pat’s work is marked by his 
commitment and dedication to the people of 
Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District. 
Pat has spent a lifetime in service to our 
community. Before joining my office, Pat 
served as a law enforcement officer in Blair 
County for 27 years, including as Blair County 
Parole Officer, Altoona Police Officer, and Al-
toona School District Police Officer. He at-
tended Bishop Guilfoyle High School and 
holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice 
from the University of Dayton. 
It is my privilege to recognize Patrick G. 
Himes, Sr., for his outstanding service to our 
region, and to thank him for his tireless work. 
I wish Pat and his family all the best as they 
embark on a new chapter. 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF COLONEL GERALD ‘‘JERRY’’ 
LUKOWSKI JR 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the esteemed career in 
public service of Colonel Gerald ‘‘Jerry’’ 
Lukowski, Junior. Colonel Lukowski retires on 
June 5, 2021, from the apex of his service as 
Chief of Staff to the Joint Staff for the Con-
necticut Army National Guard. Having dedi-
cated a 36-year long career toward securing 
the common defense through a distinguished 
vocation in the military, Jerry will move on and 
continue to benefit the State of Connecticut 
with his skill and expertise within the Con-
necticut Department of Transportation. 
Jerry’s sense of duty catalyzed his service 
to the public through a military-oriented career. 
This was exemplified from the earliest days of 
his education, when he was commissioned as 
a Second Lieutenant through the University of 
Connecticut’s ROTC program in 1989, before 
graduating from the University of New Haven 
in 1991. Armed with a Bachelors in Civil Engi-
neering, Second Lieutenant Lukowski set his 
sights on a path to leadership within the 
State’s civil defense unit, the Connecticut 
Army National Guard. He put himself forward 
on this path, engaging with various career-re-
lated roles whilst simultaneously advancing a 
civilian and military education, obtaining his 
Master’s in Environmental Engineering from 
his alma mater in 1997, completing countless 
military instruction courses and acquiring nu-
merous licenses within the State’s engineering 
apparatus as recent as 2019. 
Colonel Lukowski applied his affinity for 
knowledge throughout the ranks of his distin-
guished profession. His education prepared 
him for 17 years of service at several stations 
of duty with the Combat Engineers and most 
prominently catalyzed his ability to excel in the 
latter half of his career as the Construction 
and Facility Management Officer (CFMO) for 
13 years, and then Chief of Staff to the Joint 
Staff since 2016. As Chief of Staff, Colonel 
Lukowski greatly enhanced the operations of 
the Connecticut Army National Guard, pushing 
the troops to work with their respective units 
on their pre-deployment and redeployment re-
quirements. During his tenure as CFMO, Colo-
nel Lukowski’s leadership and expertise in fa-
cilities management, fiscal policy and federal 
contracting enabled the state to obtain nearly 
$975 million in Military Construction Project 
and Sustainment Restoration and Moderniza-
tion funding, resulting in the planning and im-
plementation of 17 total projects. His tenacity 
as an advocate for boosting Connecticut’s 
emergency response infrastructure has well 
positioned our state’s readiness capabilities for 
generations to come and has truly kept the 
safety of our public at heart. 
Madam Speaker, Colonel Lukowski has 
spent his life developing Connecticut’s emer-
gency response infrastructure. His example of 
selfless service now extends throughout his 
family—his wife Mary Beth and children John, 
Sarah, Megan and Emily—the last of whom 
has gone on to attend the US Air Force Acad-
emy after receiving a nomination from my of-
fice. While the Connecticut Army National

Guard is losing an incredibly influential pro-
ponent, we can at least find comfort knowing 
that he will continue to serve the State and the 
maintenance of its essential infrastructure in 
the Connecticut Department of Transportation. 
Having risen through the ranks from Second 
Lieutenant in 1989, all the way to Colonel in 
just 18 years, Colonel Lukowski’s impressive 
line of service to Connecticut has been dis-
played by his rapid rate of promotion and fur-
ther by his list of numerous accolades. To that 
end, I ask my colleagues in the House join me 
in honoring and thanking Colonel Jerry 
Lukowski for his extensive history of service 
and wishing him and his family all the best in 
this new chapter of their lives.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ESTABLISH-
MENT OF THE FEDERAL PRO-
TECTIVE SERVICE 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to introduce legislation to commemorate the 
50th anniversary of the establishment of the 
Federal Protective Service (FPS) in recogni-
tion of their service to our Nation. After pass-
ing the Capitol security bill in this chamber 
earlier this week, it is only natural that we 
highlight the work of our protection agencies 
and their commitment to the Federal work-
force. As a former law enforcement officer, I 
understand the pivotal role of security today 
more than ever. Following the U.S. Capitol at-
tacks on January 6, we witnessed firsthand 
how important it is to have law enforcement 
agencies like FPS to protect our federal facili-
ties and workforce. 
For half a century, FPS has served and pro-
tected the American people and government 
business with honor, integrity, and commit-
ment. Since its inception in 1971, FPS has 
contributed to the protection of people and 
property in the Federal Government by identi-
fying and mitigating vulnerabilities through risk 
assessments, law enforcement, intelligence 
analysis, and security measures. Two major 
acts of terror against the United States have 
shaped FPS to anticipate emerging threats 
more effectively: the bombing of the Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, 
and the terror attacks on September 11. 
Today, FPS provides the Department of 
Homeland Security Secretary with a highly 
trained, nationwide force that can support 
needs in countering emerging or existing 
threats and terrorism, within the boundaries of 
our Nation and territories. It is also responsible 
for protecting over 9,000 facilities and more 
than 1.4 million people who work, visit, or con-
duct business at these facilities each day. 
FPS has shown that it is a leader within the 
law enforcement and protection community. It 
is their work and dedication that brings us 
closer to the vision of a Federal workforce and 
workplace that is safe, secure, and resilient 
moving forward. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in recognizing one of our nation’s 
most critical federal agencies. 
VA ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE 
U.S. 
OUTLYING 
AREAS 
AND 
FREELY ASSOCIATED STATES 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, military vet-
erans living in the U.S. Outlying Areas and 
Freely Associated States do not have the 
same access to services as veterans else-
where in our Nation. They face numerous ob-
stacles accessing the benefits to which they 
are due. They cannot reach all the services 
that should be available to them. We must fix 
this inequality. 
As a first step, today I am introducing legis-
lation to create the Veterans Affairs Advisory 
Committee on the U.S. Outlying Areas and 
Freely Associated States. The new advisory 
committee would be composed of veterans 
from the U.S. Outlying Areas—the Northern 
Mariana Islands, which I represent, American 
Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 
Puerto Rico—and from the Freely Associated 
States of the Federated States of Micronesia, 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the 
Republic of Palau. The committee, a part of 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, will 
be responsible for assessing benefit avail-
ability and service accessibility in these U.S. 
Outlying areas and Freely associated States 
and for advising the Secretary on how any 
deficits can be addressed. 
As an example of these inequities, the 
Northern Marianas, my district, is the only U.S. 
jurisdiction without a VA Community-Based 
Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). The nearest full- 
service VA medical facility is in Hawaii, which 
can be over a 15-hour journey by plane. The 
Northern Marianas is also the only U.S. area 
without a Vet Center. Guam Vet Center staff 
travel to the island of Saipan in the Marianas 
to provide services, but visits are infrequent 
and limited to a few hours. Veterans on the is-
lands of Tinian and Rota must travel to Saipan 
or Guam to receive in-person services. The 
Marianas is also the only U.S. jurisdiction with-
out a Veteran Benefits office. Guam VA Bene-
fits Office staff travel to Saipan to meet with 
Marianas veterans and their families, but 
again those visits are infrequent and limited to 
a few hours. 
The advisory committee my legislation sets 
up will detail issues, like these that Marianas 
veterans face, and concerns raised by vet-
erans resident in the other U.S. outlying areas 
and freely associated states. And the com-
mittee will recommend to the Secretary how 
these issues should be addressed. 
It is also my intention that the committee’s 
existence within the Department will encour-
age VA leadership and staff to consider island 
area veterans from the outset, when devel-
oping new programs or initiatives, to put an 
end to this pattern of inequity. 
Providing equitable support to veterans in 
the outlying areas and freely associated states 
is an obligation long overdue. These veterans 
have fought in the same conflicts and suffered 
the same physical, mental, and spiritual 
wounds of service as veterans residing every-
where else in America. 
The legislation I am introducing today will 
give these veterans a voice within the Depart-
ment to advocate for equal treatment. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill.

IN RECOGNITION OF JANYCE 
COLLIER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Janyce Collier for 
her work as the Director of the Franklin Coun-
ty Career and Technology Center Practical 
Nursing Program. 
For the past 14 years, Janyce has selflessly 
served the people of Franklin County by en-
suring quality education for the nurses and 
technicians that staff our hospitals and treat 
our patients. Her extensive career experience 
includes her dedicated work as a medical sur-
gical nurse, time spent treating patients in the 
Intensive Care Unit, as well as work with 
home health care. 
Before coming to Franklin County, Janyce 
Collier served our nation with the United 
States Army Nurse Corp from 1980 to 1995. 
During her service, she was deployed to 
Nurnberg, Germany, and later served with the 
Army Reserves in the 99th Combat Support 
Hospital located in Lancaster County, Pennsyl-
vania. Previously, Janyce received her pre- 
clinical nursing accreditation at California State 
University-Sacramento, and then earned her 
BSN in Nursing from the University of Port-
land. She furthered her education with a mas-
ter’s degree from the Oklahoma City Univer-
sity, and a MSN in Nursing Education from 
Saint Joseph’s College of Maine, as well as a 
Vocational II Certificate from Penn State. 
Janyce Collier’s dedication to teaching the 
next generation of nurses is truly remarkable. 
I am incredibly grateful for her service to our 
Nation and to our community. On behalf of 
Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District, I 
thank her for her years of service and wish 
her every continued success as she begins a 
new chapter.

Carolyn was a cherished member of her 
community, who spent the last 28 years en-
suring the safety of Basking Ridge children as 
a crossing guard near the Liberty Corner 
School. Along with her husband, George, 
Carolyn was a source of love and support to 
the students and families who knew her. 
Carolyn prepared goody bags full of snacks 
and stickers on holidays, gave cards and 
small gifts on birthdays, and always had treats 
on hand for the neighborhood dogs. She 
never forgot to ask how a sick family member 
was doing and continually kept up to date with 
those around her.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF FIRE 
CHIEF MIKE FARBER 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the lifelong career of a great Fire 
Chief, Mike Farber. In a 40-plus-year career, 
Mike has selflessly risked his life as a fire-
fighter for the people of Arizona. His coura-
geous leadership and expertise was reflected 
in his role as a serving member of the Mesa 
Community College Curriculum Committee 
and Fire Science Advisory Committee. For 
three consecutive years, Mike facilitated a 
Leadership Academy and brought numerous 
recognized leaders from the fire service to 
share their wisdom and to help mentor the dis-
trict’s officers and staff. 
Mike was also well known for his extensive 
experience and educational background. For 
more than 20 years, Mike has taught courses 
at Mesa Community College and Central Ari-
zona Community College in Tactics & Strat-
egy, Hydraulics, Supervision, Algebra, and 
Communication. His commitment and work 
ethic to civic duty and his community is a 
characteristic that all Americans should strive 
for. I believe that Fire Chief Mike Farber is a 
great example of what being an American is 
about. His impact and involvement will not be 
forgotten by his local community and state. 
Madam Speaker, I express a sincere form 
of gratitude to Fire Chief Mike Farber, and I 
encourage my colleagues to join me in cele-
brating a successful career and legacy as a 
valuable protector to the people of Arizona.

100 
YEARS OF ACTION 
HON. JODEY C. ARRINGTON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Plainview Rotary 
Club, which is celebrating 100 years of serv-
ice. 
Since May 1, 1921, the Plainview Rotary 
Club has consistently served not only the 
Plainview community, but also the entire 
Texas Panhandle region and beyond. While 
times have undoubtedly changed over the 
past century, the Plainview Rotary Club’s 
foundation of ‘‘Service Above Self’’ has not. 
With almost 60 members, this clubs impact 
echoes throughout West Texas. 
Whether it is working with the Salvation 
Army at Christmas, providing dictionaries to 
Hale County third graders, awarding students 
with perfect attendance, giving protective 
equipment to medical personnel, or promoting 
community improvement projects, Plainview 
Rotarians are known for putting service into 
action. 
These individuals exemplify the principles of 
West Texas exceptionalism. For that, I wish to 
thank each member of the Plainview Rotary 
Club for their continuous, dedicated commit-
ment to improving the lives of others. It is an 
honor to represent these members in our Na-
tion’s capital. 
Again, congratulations on 100 outstanding

IN RECOGNITION OF GARY AND

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Gary and Marie 
Kline as they celebrate their 50th wedding an-
niversary on Saturday, June 5, 2021. 
Gary is a native and lifelong resident of 
Chambersburg, and Marie moved to the area 
from Edison, New Jersey. They met during a 
football game at Chambersburg Area High 
School. Mr. and Mrs. Kline were married on 
June 5, 1971, at Corpus Christi Catholic 
Church 
in 
Chambersburg 
by 
Father 
Clemmons. Together they raised a beautiful 
family, welcoming a son, Gary, and daughter 
in-law, Jessica. 
For decades, they have worked together to 
serve the Chambersburg community and are 
active members of the Corpus Christi Church. 
Gary is a Fourth Degree Member of the 
Chambersburg Knights of Columbus Council 
1426, where he served as Grand Knight from 
2000 to 2002. Marie’s community involvement 
extends from her volunteer work with the local 
Red Cross organizing blood drives across the 
region and to her service to local children at 
the Fourth Street Nursery School. 
Gary and Marie Kline have shared a won-
derful 50 years of marriage. Their enduring 
commitment to one another has held them to-
gether for better and for worse, and their 
strong and lasting marriage is one of life’s 
greatest blessings. As Mr. and Mrs. Kline cele-
brate this remarkable achievement, I wish 
them every continued health and happiness in 
the years to come.

MENSTRUAL EQUITY FOR ALL ACT 
OF 2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce that on May 28th, Menstrual Hy-
giene Day, I introduced my Menstrual Equity 
for All Act of 2021. No one should be inhibited 
from participating fully in daily life due to lack 
of access to menstrual products. Safe, afford-
able access to period products is a basic need 
for over half the population, moreover, it is a 
human right. 
Madam Speaker, period poverty permeates 
and cuts across a swath of issues—from edu-
cational equity to criminal justice reform; from 
economic and housing justice to immigration. 
The tragic reality for too many individuals in 
our nation, is that the cost of menstrual prod-
ucts is a barrier to managing monthly men-
struation in a safe and dignified manner. 
In the United States, 25 million women live 
at or below the poverty line. A 2019 study 
found that among low-income women in a 
major U.S. city, nearly half had to choose be-
tween buying food and spending money on 
menstrual products. One in five teens have 
struggled to afford period products, or were 
not able to purchase them at all. As a result, 
over 80 percent of teens say they missed 
school or know someone else who has. A re-
cent study revealed that 1 in 10 college stu-
dents was unable to afford menstrual prod-
ucts, and those who experienced period pov-
erty on a monthly basis, were more likely to 
experience moderate to severe depression. 
Madam Speaker, menstruators from all 
walks of life, across our country are having to 
choose between their period or their dignity. In 
fact, a lawsuit filed against DHS’s monstrous 
treatment of migrant children in its custody 
found that girls with periods were left to bleed 
through their clothes and denied showers for 
days on end. This is unconscionable. We must 
break the silence, raise awareness, and fight 
for menstrual equity for all—each and every 
day. 
My Menstrual Equity for All Act, is the first 
of its kind to comprehensively address the 
challenges of those experiencing period pov-
erty. My bill would provide students from ele-
mentary school through postsecondary edu-
cation free menstrual products, ensure that in-
carcerated individuals and detainees in fed-
eral, state, and local facilities have access to 
free menstrual products, allow homeless as-
sistance provides to provide these products 
with federal grant funds, require Medicaid to 
cover the cost of menstrual products, direct 
large employers to provide free menstrual 
products in the workplace, and ensure that all 
public federal buildings provide free menstrual 
products in restrooms. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot address edu-
cational equity, economic justice, or infrastruc-
ture reform without addressing the barriers 
that prevent our social infrastructure from car-
ing for the basic health care rights of our pop-
ulation. I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation and join me in upholding this 
human right. We must work to end period pov-
erty once and for all.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Evertt Atkinson of Mt. Vernon, Illi-
nois, who turns 99 tomorrow. 
Evertt was born on June 5, 1922, in Jeffer-
son County to Emery Pearl and Hallie 
Winnifred Morre Atkinson. Upon the death of 
his mother, Evertt dropped out of school at the 
age of 13 to help his father tend to the family 
dairy farm and help raise his three younger 
brothers. Upon hearing of the bombing of 
Pearl Harbor, Evertt hitchhiked from Mt. 
Vernon to Scott Air Force Base to enlist in the 
military. However, he was only 19 at the time, 
and he was forced to return home to get his 
father’s written permission to enlist.

By November of 1942, he became an Avia-
tion Cadet. He went on to take additional train-
ing as an electronic specialist, became a com-
missioned 2nd Lieutenant and then a Flight In-
structor in the Army Air Force. He was also 
elected to the Honor Committee and grad-
uated in the top 10 percent of his class. While 
on a 10-day leave, he met and fell in love with 
Doris Louise McCauley, whom he married on 
December 3, 1943. Three years later, Evertt 
was honorably discharged as a First Lieuten-
ant. 
Upon returning home to Mt. Vernon with 
Doris, they raised their three children: Ruth 
Ann Clark-Wheeler, Rebecca Louise Hill, and 
Dennis Dale Atkinson. In 1948, Evertt ac-
quired his high school diploma and worked on 
his wife’s family’s dairy farm until 1965. He 
then worked for Sturdi-Built as a salesman for 
the next 28 years. 
Those who know Evertt are familiar with his 
outgoing, positive approach to life and loss. 
He continues to volunteer for numerous chari-
table causes in his community. Madam Speak-
er, please join me in honoring Evertt Atkinson 
on his 99th birthday. On behalf of Southern Il-
linois, happy birthday.

RECOGNIZING 
DR. 
EDWARD 
TIRYAKIAN’S 
DONATION 
TO 
YEREVAN STATE UNIVERSITY 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Edward 
Tiryakian, Duke University Professor Emeritus 
of Sociology, for the creation of a library wing 
in his honor at Yerevan State University in 
Yerevan, Armenia. Dr. Tiryakian donated his 
professional library to the university and was 
recognized in an official dedication ceremony 
on May 24, 2021. 
Dr. Tiryakian is a renowned scholar, widely 
published in sociological theory, sociology of 
religion, and sociology of development. As a 
leading sociologist for 65 years, Dr. Tiryakian 
has amassed a large collection of important 
works in the field, ranging from 19th century 
texts written by founding sociologists to mid– 
20th century works written by prominent soci-
ologists he has studied under. Over two years 
ago, Dr. Tiryakian approached Yerevan State 
University about donating his professional li-
brary to the university. The university enthu-
siastically agreed and constructed a dedicated 
wing in their main library to house the collec-
tion. 
This generous gift included over 300 pub-
lished books, many of which are rarities in the 
field and are no longer in print. Dr. Tiryakian 
cited his desire to honor his Armenian heritage 
as a source of inspiration for the generous do-
nation. The University held an official com-
memoration this month for the library wing that 
will hold Dr. Tiryakian ’s beloved books. 
Dr. Tiryakian’s donation is the latest dem-
onstration of his dedication to students and 
study of sociology as well as his leadership in 
the field. He joined Duke University as a pro-
fessor in 1965, and he and I became friends 
and colleagues when I joined the faculty a 
decade later. At Duke, he has served as the 
Sociology Department Chair as well as Direc-
tor of International Studies and was instru-
mental in internationalizing the university. He 
also has held national leadership positions as 
President of the American Society for the 
Study of Religion and Chair of the American 
Sociological Association History of Sociology 
Section. Dr. Tiryakian received his bachelor’s 
degree from Princeton University and a Ph.D. 
in Sociology from Harvard University. He 
taught at both institutions before joining the 
faculty at Duke. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Tiryakian has re-
mained steadfast not only in his own pursuit of 
knowledge, but in his dedication to supporting 
the next generation of scholars at home and 
abroad. His generous donation opens the door 
for the university’s students to learn from great 
scholars in the field of sociology, including Dr. 
Tiryakian himself. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to 
know and work alongside Dr. Tiryakian during 
his extraordinary career. We have had many 
conversations about Armenian history and pol-
itics over the years, but I had never visited the 
country until 2019, when, as chairman of the 
House Democracy Partnership, we engaged 
the Armenian parliament in the wake of the 
country’s Velvet Revolution. I thought of Ed 
Tiryakian often during that visit. It is especially 
satisfying to see him close the circle person-
ally and professionally with this gift to Yerevan 
State University, knowing that it will benefit Ar-
menian students and enrich Armenian-Amer-
ican ties for years to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF DEBBY 
CUNNINGHAM 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Debby 
Cunningham as she becomes the newest Ex-
ecutive Director of Greencastle-Antrim Cham-
ber of Commerce. As a native of Greencastle, 
Debby is returning to the community to lead 
the Chamber of Commerce, support small 
businesses, and help revitalize our local econ-
omy. 
A graduate of the Hagerstown Business 
College, Debby served as the business man-
ager at the University of Maryland Extension. 
In this role, she managed the fiscal and 
human relations processes that kept the insti-
tution running smoothly across Maryland, 
while also supporting community relations. 
Debby Cunningham’s experience and pas-
sion for public service will be incredible assets 
as she leads the Greencastle-Antrim Chamber 
of Commerce. It is my honor to congratulate 
Debby on this new role, and I look forward to 
our continued work together to serve the peo-
ple of Franklin County. 
HONORING 
THE 
MINISTRY 
AND 
COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 
OF 
MR. 
LARRY 
YONKER 
AT 
SPRINGS 
RESCUE MISSION 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to honor the ministry and community 
impact of Mr. Larry Yonker at Springs Rescue 
Mission in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
Springs Rescue Mission has become a pillar 
of the Pike’s Peak region, not only by caring 
for the homeless but as a model of local busi-
ness, government, and faith-based collabora-
tion, for the good of the community. 
It was only one decade ago that Springs 
Rescue Mission was working to create its first 
shelter. The focus of its humble campus was 
still on feeding the homeless, men’s addiction 
recovery, and some limited daytime services. 
Under Mr. Yonker’s leadership, the Mission 
has become an expansive homeless resource 
campus—a Community of Hope for the most 
vulnerable men and women of Colorado 
Springs. With 450 beds, the Mission is now 
the largest homeless shelter in the region. The 
Resource Center offers case management 
and other essential services to help those in 
need to regain their health, return to work, and 
find permanent housing. Every day, hundreds 
of neighbors in need come to the Mission for 
a filling meal, a hot shower, a warm bed, and 
compassionate care. Just next door, 65 chron-
ically homeless people have found a home at 
Greenway Flats. And in the middle of it all, a 
new 200-seat Samaritan’s Kitchen, recently 
opened their doors to our community. 
As a Colorado native and graduate of the 
University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo, 
Larry is motivated by a deep faith in God and 
compassionate love for his neighbors. Larry’s 
drive and focus is derived from Matthew 
25:34–40, and has been the inspiration for 
Larry’s tenure at Springs Rescue Mission, 
‘‘Then the King will say to those on His 
right hand. ‘Come, you blessed of my Father, 
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from 
the foundation of the world; for I was hungry 
and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you 
gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took 
Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was 
sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and 
you came to Me.’ Then the righteous will an-
swer Him. saying, ‘Lord, when did we see 
You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give 
You drink? When die we see You a stranger 
and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 
Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, 
and come to You?’ And the King will answer 
and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, in-
asmuch as you did it to one of the least of 
these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ ’’ 
Over the years, Mr. Yonker has been com-
mitted to bringing community partners both in 
the private and public sectors together, with a 
mission to provide lifesaving and life-building 
care for those most in need. He has been a 
champion for those trapped in homelessness, 
addiction, and poverty and for collaboration 
and partnership across every walk of life to 
ensure people receive the care they need. 
As Larry retires, it is my highest privilege to 
honor and thank him for being a ‘‘faithful serv-
ant’’ to Colorado’s Fifth Congressional District.

CONGRATULATING REBA WARREN 
ON 
HER 
RETIREMENT 
AND 
RECORD OF SERVICE TO HER 
COMMUNITY AND THE NATION 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Reba Warren, a phe-
nomenal woman, and a soror of Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority, Inc., on her retirement after a 
long and distinguished career as a senior Cor-
porate Counsel for a Fortune 500 company. 
After graduating from Howard University in 
1981, Reba Warren was admitted to Duke 
Law School, from which she graduated in 
1984. 
As a corporate counsel for Reynolds, Reba 
Warren helped pave the way for African-Amer-
ican women to follow in a professional sector, 
in which they are woefully underrepresented. 
This daughter of AKA took to heart the guid-
ance that her fellow Howard alum, Vice-Presi-
dent KAMALA HARRIS, received from her moth-
er: ‘‘You may be the first you may be the first 
to do many things, but make sure you’re not 
the last.’’ 
For more than two decades, Reba Warren 
exhibited excellence in her professional duties 
and also mentored and encourage women, es-
pecially women of color, as they strove to cre-
ate career paths in male-dominated environ-
ments. 
A civic-minded community member, Reba 
Warren has served on several non-profit 
boards, is active in her church, and 
Reba Warren currently serves as a member 
of the Second Harvest Food Bank to end food 
insecurity for Forsyth County, which is but the 
latest civic engagement in a lifetime of service 
to her community, which includes Big Brothers 
Big Sisters, Neighborhood Justice Center 
Board, Salvation Army Girls Club Committee, 
Crosby 
Scholars 
Community 
Partnership 
Board, Novant Health/Forsyth Medical Center 
Foundation Board, Jack & Jill of America, Win-
ston Salem Chapter, Winston Salem Chapter 
of the Links, Incorporated, Girl Scouts of 
America, and the North Association of Black 
Lawyers. 
Madam Speaker, I wish this phenomenal 
woman and mother of three sons well in her 
retirement, but I know that her ethic to serve 
her community will continue as we will all be 
better off for it.

HONORING 
LUCIA 
EMILY 
DOUD 
WALLACE OF WILLSBORO, NEW 
YORK ON HER 106TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor long-time Willsboro resident, 
Lucia Emily Doud Wallace, as she celebrates 
her 106th birthday on June 1, 2021. 
Lucia Emily Doud was born in Malone, New 
York on June 1, 1915, the youngest of six chil-
dren. She attended the Fine Arts College of 
Syracuse University where she met her future 
husband, Edmund Whiting Wallace. The cou-
ple were married in 1938 and spent 74 happy 
years together. They raised two children, Mar-
jorie Alison Wallace, and Dr. Cynthia Day Wal-
lace. The Wallace family has shown tremen-
dous strength of character and perseverance 
through the challenges that life has thrown 
their way, including the deaths of Marjorie and 
Edmund. Through it all, Lucia remained a 
steadfast light in the lives of those around her. 
In addition, Lucia is quite the accomplished 
artist. She was awarded the National Sculp-
ture Award and studied under Lorado Taft, a 
renowned American sculptor. Lucia excelled at 
painting, sculpting, and is even an accredited 
national flower show judge. In her 106 years 
of life, Lucia’s joy and wisdom have been a 
constant presence in her community and her 
artistic talent has brought much happiness to 
her family and friends. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to wish Lucia a very 
happy 106th birthday. I wish her continued 
health and happiness in this next year of her 
life.

RETIREMENT OF ESTHER L. BUSH 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Esther L. Bush, who will be retiring after 27 
years as President and CEO of the Pittsburgh 
Urban League—one of the top-rated Urban 
League affiliates in the country. 
A Pittsburgh native, Ms. Bush is a member 
of the class of 1969 from Westinghouse High 
School in Pittsburgh. She went on to earn a 
bachelor’s degree in education from Morgan 
State University and a master’s degree in 
guidance and counseling from Johns Hopkins 
University before beginning her career as a 
high school teacher and later a college admin-
istrator and corporate consultant. 
Ms. Bush spent a total of 41 years working 
for the Urban League. Beginning in 1980, she 
worked for various Urban League branches in 
New York City and was President and CEO of 
the Urban League of Greater Hartford before 
returning to her hometown of Pittsburgh in 
1994. 
As a member of the Pennsylvania State 
Board of Education, she prided herself on her 
contributions to education and once stated 
that the formation of the Urban League of 
Greater Pittsburgh Charter School in 1998 
was one of her greatest accomplishments as 
the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh’s 
President and CEO. Her excellent work in 
education resulted in national recognition. In 
2013, Ms. Bush was 1 of 10 Americans recog-
nized at the White House as a Champion of 
Change in the Educational Excellence for Afri-
can Americans program. 
She also hosted the National Urban League 
Conference in 2013. Under her watch, the 
Pittsburgh Urban League Chapter also re-
ceived the distinction of receiving a 5-out-of-5 
top rating in its assessment from the national 
chapter. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 18th Congres-
sional District, I want to commend Esther 
Bush for her contributions to Pittsburgh and 
the African American community. Her actions 
are reflected in every life that she touched. 
Esther Bush should serve as an inspiration for 
us all. I am pleased to recognize her service 
to our community and wish her a happy and 
enjoyable retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF CORI 
SEILHAMER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 4, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Cori Seilhamer for 
her dedication and drive to establish and lead 
the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) in Franklin 
County. Her work to train Law Enforcement 
Officers and members of the community to re-
spond to mental health emergencies has 
made our community safer. 
The Crisis Intervention Team’s success has 
led to the development and implementation of 
the CoResponder/Community Liaison pro-
gram, which pairs mental health professionals 
with Law Enforcement Officers and their agen-
cies to respond directly to mental health emer-
gencies. 
As of April 2021, there have been 1,150 
unique individuals who have been referred for 
mental health treatment and services as a re-
sult of the team’s lifesaving work. The two co- 
responders and their law enforcement partners 
have been able to divert numerous arrests 
and court sanctions during the tenure of the 
co-responders. The team has linked numerous 
individuals with community resources and sup-
port which have helped to reduce recidivism 
and the need for contact with law enforce-
ment. 
The South-Central Pennsylvania CIT team 
has trained 225 individuals with experience 
ranging from law enforcement and emergency 
medicine to community organizers, mental 
health professionals, and veterans affairs em-
ployees. Cori Seilhamer’s extensive experi-
ence and guidance has paved the way for 
other agencies and counties to start their own 
Crisis Intervention Teams as a response to 
her outstanding successes in Franklin County. 
Cori’s commitment and selfless service to 
our community has had a phenomenal impact 
for the residents of Franklin County. On behalf 
of the 13th District of Pennsylvania, I thank 
her for her service to our community and wish 
her every continued success.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E610 
June 4, 2021 
Born in Peoria, Illinois on April 10, 1921, 
John F. Middleswart enlisted with the Marine 
Corps at age 19. After finishing boot camp in 
San Diego, he attended Sea School and was 
assigned to the Marine detachment aboard the 
USS Oklahoma stationed in Pearl Harbor, Ha-
waii. In October 1941, he was promoted to 
Private First Class. 
Moored on Battleship Row, the vessel was 
struck by multiple torpedoes from Japanese 
aircraft during the assault on the morning of 
December 7, 1941. When the ship capsized, 
PFC Middleswart and hundreds of his fellow 
crewmen were reported missing and later de-
clared dead. For decades, they were memori-
alized at the Court of the Missing at the Na-
tional Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in 
Honolulu, Hawaii. 
On January 28, 2021, PFC Middleswart was 
the 300th identification made by the Defense 
POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) in the 
USS Oklahoma Project. The DPAA works to 
identify all servicemembers lost during World 
War II and other conflicts. Specifically, the 
USS Oklahoma Project seeks to identify the 
remaining unaccounted-for crewmen of the 
vessel and is on track to identify 90 percent of 
the exhumed remains by the end of this year. 
The final burial of PFC Middleswart is made 
possible by the dedication and fortitude of the 
men and women of DPAA and the Armed 
Forces Medical Examiner System team of sci-
entists. DPAA’s noble mission to identify all 
fallen servicemembers is not yet complete, but 
each identification is a step closer. And, while 
we mourn this life that was cut short, we re-
joice the reunification of the Middleswart fam-
ily. Welcome home, PFC Middleswart. Semper 
Fidelis.
