The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sen-
ators, will you please be seated. 
If there is no objection, the Journal 
of proceedings of the trial are approved 
to date. 
I would ask the Sergeant at Arms to

The Acting Sergeant at Arms, Jen-
nifer A. Hemingway, made the procla-
mation as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are com-
manded to keep silence, on pain of imprison-
ment, while the Senate of the United States 
is sitting for the trial of the Article of Im-
peachment exhibited by the House of Rep-
resentatives against Donald John Trump, 
former President of the United States.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Democratic leader is recognized.

mately every 2 hours and a longer din-
ner break around 5 p.m. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pur-
suant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, 
the counsel for the former President 
has 16 hours to make the presentation 
of their case, and the Senate will hear

We recognize Mr. van der Veen to 
begin the presentation of the case for 
the former President. 
Go ahead. 
COUNSELS’ PRESENTATION 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Good 
afternoon, Senators, Mr. President. 
The Article of Impeachment now be-
fore the Senate is an unjust and bla-
tantly unconstitutional act of political 
vengeance. This appalling abuse of the 
Constitution only further divides our 
Nation when we should be trying to 
come together around shared prior-
ities. 
Like every other politically moti-
vated witch hunt the left has engaged 
in over the past 4 years, this impeach-
ment is completely divorced from the 
facts, the evidence, and the interests of 
the 
American 
people. 
The 
Senate 
should promptly and decisively vote to 
reject it. 
No thinking person could seriously 
believe that the President’s January 6 
speech on the Ellipse was in any way 
an incitement to violence or insurrec-
tion. The suggestion is patently absurd 
on its face. Nothing in the text could 
ever be construed as encouraging, 
condoning, or enticing unlawful activ-
ity of any kind. 
Far from promoting ‘‘insurrection’’ 
against the United States, the Presi-
dent’s remarks explicitly encouraged 
those in attendance to exercise their 
rights ‘‘peacefully and patriotically.’’ 
Peaceful and patriotic protest is the 
very antithesis of a violent assault on 
the Nation’s Capitol. 
The 
House 
Impeachment 
Article 
slanderously alleges that the President 
intended for the crowd at the Ellipse to 
‘‘interfere with the Joint Session’s sol-
emn constitutional duty to certify the 
results of the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion.’’ This is manifestly disproven by 
the plain text of the remarks. 
The President devoted nearly his en-
tire speech to an extended discussion of 
how legislators should vote on the 
question at hand. Instead of expressing 
a desire that the joint session be pre-
vented from conducting its business, 
the entire premise of his remarks was 
that the democratic process would and

February 12, 2021 
should play out according to the letter 
of the law, including both the Constitu-
tion and the Electoral Count Act. 
In the conclusion of his remarks, he 
then laid out a series of legislative 
steps that should be taken to improve 
democratic accountability going for-
ward, such as passing universal voter 
ID legislation, banning ballot har-
vesting, requiring proof of citizenship 
to vote, and turning out strong in the 
next primaries. Not only President— 
these are not the words of someone in-
citing a violent insurrection. 
Not only President Trump’s speech 
on January 6 but, indeed, his entire 
challenge to the election results was 
squarely focused on how the proper 
civic process could address any con-
cerns through the established legal and 
constitutional system. The President 
brought his case before State and Fed-
eral courts, the U.S. Supreme Court, 
the State legislatures, the electoral 
college, and, ultimately, the U.S. Con-
gress. 
In the past, numerous other can-
didates for President have used many 
of the same processes to pursue their 
own election challenges. As recently as 
2016, the Clinton campaign brought 
multiple postelection court cases, de-
manded recounts, and ridiculously de-
clared the election stolen by Russia. 
Many Democrats even attempted to 
persuade the electoral college dele-
gates to overturn the 2016 results. 
House Manager RASKIN objected to the 
certification of President Trump’s vic-
tory 4 years ago, along with many of 
his colleagues. 
You will remember, it was Joe Biden 
who had to gavel him down. 
(Text of Video presentation.) 
Mr. RASKIN. I have an objection because 
10 of the 29 electoral votes cast by Florida 
were cast by electors not lawfully certified.

from the State of Wisconsin, which would

from the State of North Carolina. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I object to the certificate 
from the State of Alabama. The electors 
were not lawfully certified. 
Vice President BIDEN. Is it signed by a 
Senator? 
Mr. RASKIN. Not as of yet, Mr. President.

Vice President BIDEN. Section 18, title 20 
of the United States Code prohibits debate in 
the joint session. 
Ms. WATERS. I do not wish to debate. I 
wish to ask, Is there one United States Sen-
ator who will join me in this letter of objec-
tion? 
Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. 
There is no debate. 
Ms. WATERS. Just one. 
Vice President BIDEN. The gentlewoman 
will suspend. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. In 2000, 
the dispute over the outcome was 
taken all the way to the Supreme 
Court, which ultimately rendered a de-
cision. 
To litigate questions of an election 
integrity within this system is not in-
citement to insurrection. It is the 
democratic system working as the 
Founders and lawmakers have de-
signed. To claim that the President, in 
any way, wished, desired, or encour-
aged lawless or violent behavior is a 
preposterous and monstrous lie. 
In fact, the first two messages the 
President sent via Twitter, once the in-
cursion of the Capitol began, were: 
Stay peaceful and no violence because we 
are the party of law and order. 
The gathering on January 6 was sup-
posed to be a peaceful event. Make no 
mistake about that. And the over-
whelming majority of those in attend-
ance remained peaceful. 
As everyone knows, the President 
had spoken at hundreds of large rallies 
across the country over the past 5 
years. There had never been any mob- 
like or riotous behaviors, and, in fact, 
a significant portion of each event was 
devoted to celebrating the rule of law, 
protecting our Constitution, and hon-
oring the men and women of law en-
forcement. 
Contrast the President’s repeated 
combinations of violence with the rhet-
oric from his opponents. 
(Text of Video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. I am your President of 
law and order and an ally of all peaceful pro-
testers. 
Vice President BIDEN. The vast majority 
of the protests have been peaceful. 
President TRUMP. Republicans stand for 
law and order, and we stand for justice. 
Ms. PELOSI. I just don’t even know why 
there aren’t uprisings all over the country. 
Maybe there will be. 
President TRUMP. My administration will 
always stand against violence, mayhem, and 
disorder. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. There needs to be unrest 
in the streets for as long as there is unrest in 
our lives. 
President TRUMP. I stand with the heroes 
of law enforcement. 
Ms. WATERS. And you push back on them, 
and you tell them they are not welcome any-
more anywhere. 
President TRUMP. We will never defund 
our police. Together, we will ensure that 
America is a nation of law and order. 
Vice President BIDEN. If we were in high 
school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat 
the hell out of him. 
Mr. TESTER. But I think you need to go 
back and punch him in the face. 
Mr. BOOKER. I feel like punching him. 
President TRUMP. We just want law and 
order. Everybody wants that. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to tell you, 
Gorsuch; I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You 
have released the whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price. 
President TRUMP. We want law and order. 
We have to have law and order. 
Mr. CUOMO. Show me where it says that 
protests are supposed to be polite and peace-
ful. 
President TRUMP. We believe in safe 
streets, secure communities, and we believe 
in law and order. 
Tragically, as we know now, the Jan-
uary—on January 6, a small group, who 
came to engage in violent and men-
acing behavior, hijacked the event for 
their own purposes. According to pub-
licly available reporting, it is apparent 
that extremists of various different 
stripes 
and 
political 
persuasions 
preplanned and premeditated an attack 
on the Capitol. One of the first people 
arrested was a leader of antifa. Sadly, 
he was also among the first to be re-
leased. 
From the beginning, the President 
has been clear: The criminals who infil-
trated the Capitol must be punished to 
the fullest extent of the law. They 
should be imprisoned for as long as the 
law allows. 
The fact that the attacks were appar-
ently premeditated, as alleged by the 
House managers, demonstrates the lu-
dicrousness of the incitement allega-
tion against the President. 
You can’t incite what was already 
going to happen. 
Law enforcement officers at the 
scene conducted themselves heroically 
and courageously, and our country 
owes them an eternal debt. But there 
must be a discussion of the decision by 
political leadership regarding force 
posture and security in advance of the 
event. 
As many will recall, last summer the 
White House was faced with violent ri-
oters night after night. They repeat-
edly attacked Secret Service officers 
and at one point pierced a security 
wall, culminating in the clearing of La-
fayette Square. 
Since that time, there has been a sus-
tained negative narrative in the media 
regarding the necessity of those secu-
rity measures on that night, even 
though they certainly prevented many 
calamities from occurring. 
In the wake of the Capitol attack, it 
must be investigated whether the prop-
er force posture was not initiated due 
to the political pressure stemming 
from the events at Lafayette Square. 
Consider this: On January 5, the Mayor 
of the District of Columbia explicitly 
discouraged the National Guard and 
Federal authorities from doing more to 
protect the Capitol, saying:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S669 
February 12, 2021 
[T]he District of Columbia is not request-
ing other federal law enforcement personnel 
and discourages any additional deployment 
. . . 
This sham impeachment also poses a 
serious threat to freedom of speech for 
political leaders of both parties at 
every level of government. The Senate 
should be extremely careful about the 
precedent this case will set. 
Consider the language that the House 
Impeachment Article alleges to con-
stitute incitement: 
If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not 
going to have a country anymore. 
This is ordinary political rhetoric 
that is virtually indistinguishable from 
the language that has been used by 
people across the political spectrum for 
hundreds of years. Countless politi-
cians have spoken of fighting for our 
principles. Joe Biden’s campaign slo-
gan was ‘‘Battle for the Soul’’ of Amer-
ica. 
No human being seriously believes 
that the use of such metaphorical ter-
minology is incitement to political vio-
lence. While the President did not en-
gage in any language of incitement, 
there are numerous officials in Wash-
ington who have indeed used pro-
foundly reckless, dangerous, and in-
flammatory rhetoric in recent years. 
The entire Democratic Party and na-
tional news media spent the last 4 
years repeating, without any evidence, 
that the 2016 election had been hacked 
and falsely and absurdly claimed the 
President of the United States was a 
Russian spy. Speaker PELOSI
herself 
said that the 2016 election was hijacked 
and that Congress has a duty to protect 
our democracy. She also called the 
President an imposter and a traitor 
and recently referred to her colleagues 
in the House as ‘‘the enemy within.’’ 
Moreover, many Democrat politi-
cians endorsed and encouraged the 
riots that destroyed vast swaths of 
American cities last summer. When 
violent, leftwing anarchists conducted 
a sustained assault on a Federal court-
house in Portland, OR, Speaker PELOSI 
did not call it insurrection; instead, 
she called the Federal law enforcement 
officers protecting the building ‘‘storm 
troopers.’’ 
When violent mobs destroyed public 
property, she said: ‘‘People will do 
what they do.’’ The attorney general of 
the State of Massachusetts stated: 
Yes, America is burning, but that’s how 
forests grow. 
Representative AYANNA PRESSLEY de-
clared: 
There needs to be unrest in the streets for 
as long as there’s unrest in our lives. 
The current Vice President of the 
United States, KAMALA HARRIS, urged 
supporters to donate to a fund that 
bailed violent rioters and arsonists out 
of jail. One of those was released and 
went 
out 
and 
committed 
another 
crime, assault. He beat the bejesus out 
of somebody. She said, of the violent 
demonstrations: 
Everyone beware . . . they’re not gonna 
stop before Election Day in November, and 
they’re not gonna stop after Election Day. 
[T]hey’re not going to let up—and they 
should not. 
Such rhetoric continued even as hun-
dreds of police officers across the Na-
tion were subjected to violent assaults 
at the hands of angry mobs. A man 
claiming to be inspired by the junior 
Senator from Vermont came down here 
to Washington, DC, to watch a softball 
game and kill as many Senators and 
Congressmen as he could. It cannot be 
forgotten that President Trump did not 
blame the junior Senator. 
The senior Senator from Maine has 
had her house surrounded by angry 
mobs of protesters. When that hap-
pened, it unnerved her. One of the 
House managers—I forget which one— 
tweeted ‘‘cry me a river.’’ 
Under the standards of the House Im-
peachment Article, each of these indi-
viduals 
should 
be 
retroactively 
censored, expelled, punished, or im-
peached for inciting violence by their 
supporters. 
Unlike the left, President Trump has 
been entirely consistent in his opposi-
tion to mob violence. He opposes it in 
all forms, in all places, just as he has 
been consistent that the National 
Guard should be deployed to protect 
American communities wherever pro-
tection is needed. 
For Democrats, they have clearly 
demonstrated that their opposition to 
mobs and their view of using the Na-
tional Guard depends upon the mob’s 
political views. Not only is this im-
peachment case preposterously wrong 
on the facts, no matter how much heat 
and emotion is injected by the political 
opposition, but it is also plainly uncon-
stitutional. 
In effect, Congress would be claiming 
the right to disqualify a private cit-
izen, no longer a government official, 
from running for public office. This 
would transform the solemn impeach-
ment process into a mechanism for as-
serting 
congressional 
control 
over 
which private citizens are and are not 
allowed to run for President. In short, 
this unprecedented effort is not about 
Democrats opposing political violence; 
it is about Democrats trying to dis-
qualify their political opposition. It is 
constitutional cancel culture. 
History will record this shameful ef-
fort as a deliberate attempt by the 
Democratic Party to smear, censor, 
and cancel not just President Trump 
but the 75 million Americans who 
voted for him. Now is not the time for 
such a campaign of retribution; it is 
the time for unity and healing and fo-
cusing on the interests of the Nation as 
a whole. 
We should all be seeking to cool tem-
peratures, calm passions, rise above 
partisan lines. The Senate should re-
ject this divisive and unconstitutional 
effort and allow the Nation to move 
forward. 
Over the course of the next 3 hours or 
so, you will hear next from Mr. Schoen, 
who is going to talk about due process 
and a couple of other points you will be 
interested to hear. I will return with 
an analysis of why the First Amend-
ment must be properly applied here, 
and then Mr. CASTOR will discuss the 
law as it applies to the speech of Janu-
ary 6. And then we will be pleased to 
answer your questions. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
Schoen. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Leaders, Sen-
ators, throughout the course of today, 
my colleagues and I will explain in 
some detail the simple fact that Presi-
dent Trump did not incite the horrific, 
terrible riots of January 6. We will 
demonstrate that, to the contrary, the 
violence and the looting goes against 
the law-and-order message he conveyed 
to every citizen of the United States 
throughout his Presidency, including 
on January 6. 
First, though, we would like to dis-
cuss the hatred, the vitriol, the polit-
ical opportunism that has brought us 
here today. The hatred that the House 
managers and others on the left have 
for President Trump has driven them 
to skip the basic elements of due proc-
ess and fairness and to rush an im-
peachment through the House, claim-
ing ‘‘urgency.’’ 
But the House waited to deliver the 
Article to the Senate for almost 2 
weeks, only after Democrats had se-
cured control over the Senate. In fact, 
contrary to their claim that the only 
reason they held it was because Sen-
ator MCCONNELL wouldn’t accept the 
Article, Representative CLYBURN made 
clear that they had considered holding 
the Article for over 100 days to provide 
President Biden with a clear pathway 
to implement his agenda. 
Our Constitution and any basic sense 
of fairness require that every legal 
process with significant consequences 
for a person’s life, including impeach-
ment, requires due process under the 
law, which includes factfinding and the 
establishment of a legitimate evi-
dentiary record with an appropriate 
foundation. 
Even last year’s impeachment fol-
lowed committee hearings and months 
of examination and investigation by 
the House. Here, President Trump and 
his counsel were given no opportunity 
to review evidence or question its pro-
priety. The rush to judgment for a snap 
impeachment in this case was just one 
example of the denial of due process. 
Another, perhaps even more vitally sig-
nificant, example was the denial of any 
opportunity ever to test the integrity 
of the evidence offered against Donald 
J. Trump in a proceeding seeking to 
bar him from ever holding public office 
again and that seeks to disenfranchise 
some 75 million voters—American vot-
ers. 
On Wednesday of this week, countless 
news outlets repeated the Democrat 
talking point about the power of never- 
before-seen footage. Let me ask you 
this: Why was this footage never seen 
before? Shouldn’t the subject of an im-
peachment 
trial—this 
impeachment

February 12, 2021 
trial—President Trump, have the right 
to see the so-called new evidence 
against him? 
More importantly, the riot and the 
attack on this very building was a 
major event that shocked and impacted 
all Americans. Shouldn’t the American 
people have seen this footage as soon 
as it was available? For what possible 
reason did the House managers with-
hold it from the American people and 
President Trump’s lawyers? For polit-
ical gain? 
How did they get it? How are they 
the ones releasing it? It is evidence in 
hundreds of pending criminal cases 
against the rioters. Why was it not re-
leased through law enforcement or the 
Department of Justice? Is it the result 
of a rushed, snap impeachment for po-
litical gain without due process? 
House Manager RASKIN told us all 
yesterday that your job as jurors in 
this case is a fact-intensive job, but, of 
course, as several of the House man-
agers have told you, we still don’t have 
the facts. 
Speaker PELOSI herself, on February 
2, called for a 9/11-style Commission to 
investigate the events of January 6. 
Speaker PELOSI says that the Commis-
sion is needed to determine the causes 
of the events. She says it herself. If an 
inquiry of that magnitude is needed to 
determine the causes of the riot—and 
it may very well be—then how can 
these same Democrats have the cer-
tainty needed to bring Articles of Im-
peachment and blame the riots on 
President Trump? They don’t. 
The House managers, facing a signifi-
cant lack of evidence, turned often to 
press reports and rumors during these 
proceedings, claims that would never 
meet the evidentiary standards of any 
court. In fact, they even relied on the 
words of Andrew Feinberg, a reporter 
who recently worked for Sputnik, the 
Russian propaganda outlet. You saw it 
posted. By the way, the report they 
cited was completely refuted. 
The frequency with which House 
managers relied on unproven media re-
ports shocked me as I sat in this Cham-
ber and listened to this. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. And there 
is a lot that we don’t know yet about what 
happened that day.

around him at the time, reportedly re-

Mr. Manager RASKIN. Media reports. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. According to re-
ports. 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Reported. 
Mr. Manager LIEU. Reportedly. 
As any trial lawyer will tell you, ‘‘re-
portedly’’ is a euphemism for ‘‘I have 
no real evidence.’’ ‘‘Reportedly’’ is not 
the standard in any American setting 
in which any semblance of due process 
is afforded an accused. ‘‘Reportedly’’ 
isn’t even ‘‘here is some circumstantial 
evidence.’’ It is exactly as reliable as ‘‘I 
googled this for you.’’ 
And if you are worried you might 
ever be tried based on this type of evi-
dence, don’t be. You get more due proc-
ess than this when you fight a parking 
ticket. 
One reason due process is so impor-
tant with respect to evidence offered 
against an accused is that it requires 
an opportunity to test the integrity, 
the credibility, the reliability of the 
evidence. Here, of course, former Presi-
dent Trump was completely denied any 
such opportunity. And it turns out 
there is significant reason to doubt the 
evidence the House managers have put 
before us. 
Let me say this clearly. We have rea-
son to believe the House managers ma-
nipulated evidence and selectively edit-
ed footage. If they did and this were a 
court of law, they would face sanctions 
from the judge. 
I don’t raise this issue lightly. Rath-
er, it is a product of what we have 
found in just the limited time we have 
had since we first saw the evidence 
here with you this week. 
We have reason to believe that the 
House managers created false represen-
tations of tweets, and the lack of due 
process means there was no oppor-
tunity to review or verify the accu-
racy. 
Consider these facts. The House man-
agers, proud of their work on this snap 
impeachment, staged numerous photo 
shoots of their preparations. In one of 
those, Manager RASKIN is seen here at 
his desk, reviewing two tweets side by 
side. The image on his screen claims to 
show 
that 
President 
Trump 
had 
retweeted one of those tweets. 
(Video presentation.) 
Now, Members of the Senate, let’s 
look closely at the screen because, ob-
viously, Manager RASKIN considered it 
important enough that he invited the 
New York Times to watch him watch-
ing it. 
What is wrong with this image? Ac-
tually, there are three things very 
wrong with it. Look at the date on the 
very bottom of the screen on Manager 
RASKIN’s computer screen when we 
zoom into the picture. The date that 
appears is January 3, 2020, not 2021. 
Why is that date wrong? Because this 
is not a real screenshot that he is 
working with. This is a recreation of a 
tweet. And you got the date wrong 
when you manufactured this graphic. 
You did not disclose that this is a man-
ufactured graphic and not a real 
screenshot of a tweet. 
To be fair, the House managers 
caught this error before showing the 
image on the Senate floor. So you 
never saw it when it was presented to 
you. 
But that is not all. They didn’t fix 
this one. Look at the blue checkmark 
next to the Twitter username of the ac-
count retweeted by the President. It 
indicates that this is a verified ac-
count, given the blue check by Twitter 
to indicate it is run by a public figure. 
The problem? The user’s real account 
is not verified and has no blue check-
mark, as you can see. Were you trying 
to make her account seem more sig-
nificant or were you just sloppy? 
If we had due process of law in this 
case, we would know the truth. But 
that is not all that is wrong with this 
one tweet. House Manager Swalwell 
showed you this tweet this week, and 
he emphasized that this tweet reflected 
a call to arms. He told you repeatedly 
that this was a promise to call in the 
cavalry for January 6. He expressly led 
you to believe that President Trump’s 
supporter believed that the President 
wanted armed supporters at the Janu-
ary 6 speech—paramilitary groups, the 
cavalry—ready for physical combat. 
The problem is, the actual text is ex-
actly the opposite. The tweeter prom-
ised to bring the calvary—a public dis-
play of Christ’s crucifixion, a central 
symbol of her Christian faith with her 
to the President’s speech—a symbol of 
faith, love, and peace. 
They just never want to seem to read 
the text and believe what the text 
means. You will see this was reported 
in the media last evening also. 
Words matter, they told you. But 
they selectively edited the President’s 
words over and over again. They ma-
nipulated video, time-shifting clips, 
and made it appear the President’s 
words were playing to a crowd when 
they weren’t. Let’s take a look. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
President TRUMP. After this, we’re going 
to walk down—and I will be there with you— 
we’re going to walk down. We are going to 
walk down to the Capitol. 
And we’re going to walk down to the Cap-
itol, and we’re going cheer on our brave Sen-
ators and Congress men and women, and 
we’re probably not going to be cheering so 
much for some of them because you will 
never take back our country with weakness. 
You have to show strength, and you have to 
be strong. We have come to demand that 
Congress do the right thing and only count 
the electors who have been lawfully slated— 
lawfully slated. 
I know that everyone here will soon be 
marching over to the Capitol Building to 
peacefully 
and 
patriotically make your 
voices heard. 
‘‘And we are going to walk down to 
the Capitol.’’ They showed you that 
part. Why are we walking to the Cap-
itol? Well, they cut that off: to ‘‘cheer 
on’’ some Members of Congress, and 
not others, ‘‘peacefully and patrioti-
cally.’’ 
The Supreme Court ruled in Branden-
burg that there is a very clear standard 
for 
incitement—in 
short, 
to 
para-
phrase, whether the speech was in-
tended to provoke imminent lawless 
action and was likely to do so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S671 
February 12, 2021 
‘‘Go to the Capitol, and cheer on 
some Members of Congress but not oth-
ers’’—they know it doesn’t meet the 
standard for incitement, so they edited 
it down. 
We heard a lot this week about ‘‘fight 
like hell,’’ but they cut off the video 
before they showed you the President’s 
optimistic, patriotic words that fol-
lowed immediately after. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
President TRUMP. We fight like hell. And 
if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going 
to have a country anymore. 
Our exciting adventures and boldest en-
deavors have not yet begun. My fellow Amer-
icans, for our movement, for our children, 
and for our beloved country—and I say this 
despite all that has happened—the best is yet 
to come. 
There is that famous quote, like one 
of the House managers said: A lie will 
travel halfway around the world before 
the truth has a chance to put its shoes 
on. 
Well, this lie traveled around the 
world a few times and made its way 
into the Biden campaign talking points 
and ended up on the Senate floor: the 
Charlottesville lie, ‘‘very fine people on 
both sides,’’ except that isn’t all he 
said. And they knew it then, and they 
know it now. 
Watch this. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
President TRUMP. But you also had people 
that were very fine people—on both sides. 
You had people in that group—excuse me, ex-
cuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. 
You had people in that group that were there 
to protest the taking down of, to them, a 
very, very important statue and the renam-
ing of a park from Robert E. Lee to another 
name. 
Unidentified Speaker. George Washington 
and Robert E. Lee are not the same. 
President TRUMP. George Washington was 
a slave owner. Was George Washington a 
slave owner? So will George Washington now 
lose his status? Are we going to take down— 
excuse me. Are we going to take down—are 
we going to take down statues to George 
Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? 
What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? Do 
you like him? Are we going to take down the 
statue? Because he was a major slave owner. 
Now are we going to take down his statue? 
So you know what? It is fine. You’re 
changing history. You’re changing culture. 
And you had people—and I am not talking 
about the neo-Nazis and the White national-
ists because they should be condemned to-
tally. But you had many people in that group 
other than neo-Nazis and White nationalists, 
OK? And the press has treated them abso-
lutely unfairly. 
Now, in the other group also, you had some 
fine people, but you also had troublemakers, 
and you see them come with the black out-
fits and with the helmets and with the base-
ball bats. You got—you had a lot of bad—you 
had a lot of bad people in the other group 
too. 
Unidentified Speaker. Who was treated un-
fairly, sir? I’m sorry. I just couldn’t under-
stand what you were saying. You were say-
ing the press treated White nationalists un-
fairly? I want to understand what you’re say-
ing. 
President TRUMP. No. No, there were peo-
ple in that rally—and I looked the night be-
fore. If you look, there were people pro-
testing, very quietly, the taking down of the 
statue of Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that 
group there were some bad ones. The fol-
lowing day, it looked like they had some 
rough, bad people—neo-Nazis, White nation-
alists—whatever you want to call them. But 
you had a lot of people in that group that 
were there to innocently protest and very le-
gally protest because, you know—I don’t 
know if you know, they had a permit. The 
other group didn’t have a permit. 
So I only tell you this: There are two sides 
to a story. I thought what took place was a 
horrible moment for our country, a horrible 
moment. But there are two sides to the 
country. 
Does anybody have a final—does anybody 
have a—you have an infrastructure— 
This might be, today, the first time 
the news networks played those full re-
marks in their context. And how many 
times have you heard that President 
Trump has never denounced White su-
premacists? Now you and America 
know the truth. 
Here is another example. One of the 
House managers made much of the 
President’s supposedly ominous words 
of ‘‘you have to get your people to 
fight.’’ But you knew what the Presi-
dent really meant. He meant that the 
crowd should demand action from 
Members of Congress and support pri-
mary challenges to those who don’t do 
what he considered to be right. Support 
primary challenges, not violent action. 
I know what he meant because I 
watched the full video, and so did the 
House managers. But they manipulated 
his words. You will see where they 
stopped it and to give it a very dif-
ferent meaning from the meaning it 
has in full context. Let’s watch. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. ‘‘You have to get 
your people to fight.’’ He told them. 
President TRUMP. You have to get your 
people to fight. And if they don’t fight, we 
have to primary the hell out of the ones that 
don’t fight. You primary them. We are going 
to. We are going to let you know who they 
are. I can already tell you, frankly. 
The ‘‘people’’ who need to fight are 
Members of Congress. Why do we have 
to skip the necessary due diligence and 
due process of law and any—that any 
legal 
proceeding 
should 
have? 
It 
couldn’t have been the urgency to get 
President Trump out of office. House 
Democrats held the Articles until he 
was no longer President, mooting their 
case. 
Hatred, animosity, division, political 
gain—and let’s face it, for House Demo-
crats, President Trump is the best 
enemy to attack. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. RASKIN. I want to say this for Donald 
Trump, who I may very well be voting to im-
peach. 
Mr. ELLISON. Donald Trump has already 
done a number of things which legitimately 
raise the question of impeachment. 
Ms. WATERS. I don’t respect this Presi-
dent, and I will fight every day until he is 
impeached. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. That is grounds to 
start impeachment proceedings. 
Those are grounds to start impeachment. 
Those are grounds to start impeachment 
proceedings. 
Yes, I think that’s grounds to start im-
peachment proceedings. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. I rise today, Mr. 
Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the 
President of the United States of America. 
Ms. WATERS. I continue to say: Impeach 
him. Impeach 45. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Impeach 45.’’) 
Impeach 45. 
Mr. COHEN. So we’re calling upon the 
House to begin impeachment hearings imme-
diately. 
Mr. JONES. On the impeachment of Don-
ald Trump, will you vote yes or no? 
Ms. OMAR. I would vote yes. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. I would vote—I 
would vote to impeach. 
Ms. TLAIB. Because we’re going to go in 
there and impeach the mother [bleep]. 
Mr. SHERMAN. But the fact is, I intro-
duced Articles of Impeachment in July of 
2017. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. If we don’t impeach 
this President, he will get reelected. 
Mr. COHEN. My oath requires me to be for 
impeachment. 
Have an impeachment hearing. He needs a 
scarlet ‘‘I’’ on his chest. 
Mr. BOOKER. The Representatives need to 
begin impeachment proceedings against this 
President. 
Ms. WARREN. It is time to bring impeach-
ment charges against him. 
Bring impeachment charges. 
Mr. NADLER. My personal view is that he 
richly deserves impeachment. 
Unidentified Speaker. I’m here at an im-
peachment rally, and we are ready to im-
peach the. . . . 
Ms. PELOSI. We can impeach him every 
day of the week for anything he’s done. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. That same ha-
tred and anger has led House managers 
to ignore their own words and actions 
and set a dangerous double standard. 
The House managers spoke about 
rhetoric, about a constant drumbeat of 
heated language. Well, as I am sure ev-
eryone watching expected, we need to 
show you some of their own words. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Ms. PELOSI. I just don’t even know why 
there aren’t uprisings all over the country. 
Maybe there will be. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. There needs to be unrest 
in streets for as long as there is unrest in our 
lives. 
Ms. PELOSI. You’ve got to be ready to 
throw a punch. 
We have to be ready to throw a punch. 
Mr. TESTER. Donald Trump, I think you 
need to go back and punch him in the face. 
Ms. Wallace. I thought he should have 
punched him in the face. 
Mr. BOOKER. I feel like punching him. 
Vice President BIDEN. I would like to take 
him behind the gym if I were in high school. 
If I were in high school, I would take him 
behind the gym and beat the hell out of him. 
You know, I wish we were in high school. 
I could take him behind the gym. 
Ms. WATERS. I will go and take Trump 
out tonight. 
Ms. WARREN. Take him out now. 
Mr. Depp. When was the last time an actor 
assassinated a President? 
Mr. Wilson. They are still going to have to 
go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump. 
Mr. Cuomo. Show me where it says a pro-
test is supposed to be polite and peaceful. 
Ms. WATERS. You push back on them, and 
you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, 
anywhere. 
Madonna. I have thought an awful lot 
about blowing up the White House. 
Mr. BOOKER. Please get up in the face of 
some Congresspeople. 
Ms. PELOSI. People will do what they do. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to tell you, 
Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh: You 
have released the whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price.

Ms. TLAIB. We’re going to go in there and 
we’re going to [bleep]. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. This is just a warning to 
you Trumpers: Be careful. Walk lightly. And 
for those of you who are soldiers, make them 
pay. 
Ms. DeGeneres. If you had to be stuck in an 
elevator with either President Trump, Mike 
Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? 
Ms. HARRIS. Does one of us have to come 
out alive? 
And there is more. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. McDonough. I promise to fight every 
single day. 
One, I’m a fighter and I’m relentless. 
But I’m a fighter and I’m relentless. 
A fighter and I’m relentless. 
I will fight like hell. 
Ms. WARREN. The way I see it now is that 
we pick ourselves up and we fight back; that 
is what it is all about. We stand up and we 
fight back. We do not back down, we do not 
compromise, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. You can lie down, you can whimper, 
you can pull up in a ball, you can decide to 
move to Canada, or you can stand your 
ground and fight back, and that is what it is 
about. We do fight back, but we are going to 
fight back. We are not turning this country 
over to what Donald Trump has sold. We are 
just not. Look, people are upset, and they’re 
right to be upset. 
Now, we can whimper, we can whine, or we 
can fight back. We’re up here to fight back. 
Me, I’m here to fight back. I’m here to fight 
back because we will not forget. We do not 
want to forget. We will use that vision to 
make sure that we fight harder, we fight 
tougher, and we fight more passionately 
more than ever. 
We still have a fight on our hands. Fight 
hard for the changes Americans are demand-
ing. Get in the fight. 
To winning the fight. 
Fight. 
Fighting.

We’ll use every tool possible to fight for 
this change. We’ll fight. We’ll fight. 
Fight. 
Fighting hard. 
Serious about fighting.

We’ve got to (inaudible) and fight back. 
Problems—we call them out and we fight 
back. 
I’m in this fight. 
I am fighting. 
I am fighting. 
Get in this fight. Get in this fight. Get in 
this fight. 
And fighting. 
We all need to be in the fight. We all need 
to stay in the fight. We stay in this fight. 
We fought back. We fought back. I am not 
afraid of a fight. I am in this fight all the 
way. You don’t get what you don’t fight for. 
Our fight. 
Our fight. 
We are in this fight for our lives. This is 
the fight of our lives. 
Mr. WARNER. But we are going to make 
sure this fight doesn’t end tonight. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. This is a fight for our

members and neighbors. It is a fight. 
Fight. 
And it is a fight that we’re going to work

It is a fight.

And that is what this fight is for.

TESTER, and you’re damn right I approve 
this message. 
Ms. ROSEN. And I’ll have lots of fights 
ahead of us, and I’m ready to stand up and 
keep fighting. 
We’re going to fight. 
We’re going to fight. 
And we need to fight. 
Fight. 
We need to fight. 
We got a few more fights. I’m going to take 
the privilege of a few more fights. 
And we have the biggest fight of all. I will 
never stop fighting. I will fight like hell to

Mrs. SHAHEEN. We need to say loud and 
clear that we are ready to fight. 
Mr. DURBIN. It’s a bare knuckles fight. 
Mr. WYDEN. Now they’re going to actually

Mr. SCHATZ. The fight has to be con-

Ms. HARRIS. To continue fighting, we 
each have an important role to play in fight-
ing in this fight like so many before it. It 
has been a fight. The American people are 
going to have to fight. 
And about the importance of fighting. I 
will always fight. 
Fighting. 
But we always must fight. 
Joe Biden has a deep, deep seeded commit-
ment to fight. 
And to fight. 
And about the importance of fighting. 
We always must fight. 
To fight. 
To fight. 
And to fight. 
As our willingness to fight. 
Continue the fight. 
As Joe Biden says, to fight. 
Fighting. 
What we are fighting for. 
We will tell them about what we did to 
fight. 
About a fight. 
Truly I do believe that we’re in a fight. 
I believe we’re in a fight. 
I believe we’re in a fight. 
I believe we’re in a fight. 
So there’s a fight in front of us. A fight for 
all of these things. And so we’re prepared to 
fight for that. 
We know how to fight. 
Our ongoing fight. 
A fight. 
We know how to fight. We like a good 
fight. We were born out of a fight. This is 
what is our fight right now. 
Mr. RASKIN. There’s the fight. 
There’re the fight. 
There’s the fight. 
And then there’s the fight to defend. 
Back in the fight. 
Ms. PELOSI. Our mission is to fight. That 
is the guiding purpose of House Democrats. 
Fighting. 
He has never forgotten who he is fighting 
for. 
March and fought. 
And we just have to fight. 
But this is a fight for our country. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Fighting the health crisis 
of COVID. 
Vice President BIDEN. I led the fight. 
And continue to fight. 
Never, never, give up this fight. I am a cit-
izen fighting for it. 
It means not only fighting. 
A 
leader 
who 
fought 
for 
progressive 
change. 
As a lawyer who fought for people his 
whole life. 
As well as other fights he’s in. I’m proud to 
have Tim in this fight with me. 
And above all, it is time for America to get 
back up and once again fight. 
Mr. Buttigieg. We will fight when we must 
fight. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. What kind of Amer-
ica are we fighting for? 
We’ve been fighting. 
We need to fight. 
But we also need to fight. 
Fight for America. 
Mrs. CLINTON. I am going to wake up 
every day and fight hard. 
I have been fighting

fight. 
And if we fight. 
And as the next Governor of Georgia, I will 
never stop fighting. We can show the old 
guard something new, and we can fight. 
Ms. DEAN. My fight. 
Those fights. 
And to fight. 
To fight an administration. 
Ms. HARRIS. Requiring us to fight and 
fight we will. 
Their fight. 
In their fight. 
In their fight. 
The fight is a fight. And so when we fight 
the fight that we are in. 
When we are fighting this fight. 
We fight this fight. 
The strength of who we are is we will fight. 
And we will fight. 
We will fight the fight. 
We are in a fight. 
The fight. 
Fight. 
Fight. 
It is a fight. 
It is a fight. 
And it is a fight born out of patriotism. 
This is a fight. 
Fighting. 
I say fight on. 
Fight on. 
Fight on. 
Fight on. 
Ms. WARREN. I am here to say one more 
time in public, this is not a fight I wanted to 
take on, but this is the fight in front of us 
now. 
Every single one of you and every 
one of you—that is OK. You didn’t do 
anything wrong. It is a word people 
use. But please stop the hypocrisy. 
Did you tone down the rhetoric last 
summer when all of this was hap-
pening? Did you condemn the rioters, 
or did you stand with NANCY PELOSI, 
who said: People are going to do what 
they are going to do. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Ms. HARRIS. This is a movement. I’m tell-
ing you, they’re not going to stop. And ev-
eryone beware because they’re not going to 
stop. They’re not going to stop before elec-
tion day in November, and they’re not going 
to stop after. 
Mr. Cuomo. Please, show me where it says 
a protest is supposed to be polite and peace-
ful. 
Ms. PELOSI. I just don’t even know why 
there aren’t uprisings all over the country. 
Maybe there will be. 
Unidentified Speaker. It was a violent 
night in St. Louis. They shot and killed 
David in cold blood. 
Ms. Hannah-Jones. Destroying property, 
which can be replaced, is not violence. 
Unidentified Speaker. This is an apartment 
complex on fire. It just collapsed. 
Unidentified Speaker. The building just 
collapsed. 
Unidentified Speaker. I don’t know where 
to go now. These people did this for no rea-
son. 
Unidentified Speaker. This is just a snap-
shot of some of the damage people will be 
waking up to. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I am proud of New York, 
and I am proud of the protests. 
Unidentified Speaker. There is damage ev-
erywhere you look. Honestly, it looks like a 
war zone. 
Ms. PELOSI. Heartwarming to see so many 
people turn out peacefully. 
Mr. SCHUMER. They keep doing it day 
after day after day. 
In fact, our country is a nation of protests. 
The patriots were protesters. 
Unidentified Speaker. St. John’s Church is 
on fire. 
Unidentified Speaker. Can you disavow 
that was antifa? 
Mr. NADLER. That is a myth. 
Unidentified Speaker. I hope someone 
burns down your whole precinct with all 
y’all inside. 
Mr. Velshi. It is not, generally speaking, 
unruly. 
Ms. WATERS. You push back on them, and 
you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, 
anywhere. 
Ms. HARRIS. They are not going to let up, 
and they should not. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. You claim 
that it is wrong to object to the certifi-
cation of election results. You, along 
with your allies in the media, at-
tempted to cancel and censor Members 
of this Chamber who voiced concerns 
and objected to certification. 
Manager RASKIN, you had been in 
Congress only 3 days when you ob-
jected in 2017. It is one of the first 
things you did when you got here. 
(Text of video presentations of 1–6– 
2017.) 
Mr. RASKIN. I have an objection because 
10 of the 29 electoral votes cast by Florida 
were cast by electors not lawfully certified. 
Vice President BIDEN. Is the objection in 
writing and signed not only by a Member of 
the House of Representatives but also by a 
Senator? 
Mr. RASKIN. It is in writing, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
Vice President BIDEN. Is it signed by a 
Senator? 
Mr. RASKIN. Not as of yet, Mr. President. 
Vice President BIDEN. In that case, an ob-
jection cannot be entertained. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. President, I object to 
the certificate from the State of Georgia on 
the grounds that the electoral vote does 
not—— 
Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. 
There is no debate. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. I object to the certificate 
from the State of North Carolina based on 
violation of the—— 
Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. 
There is no debate in the joint session. 
Ms. LEE. I object because people are horri-
fied by the overwhelming evidence—— 
Vice President BIDEN. Section 18, title 3 of 
the United States Code prohibits debate. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I object. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2005.) 
Ms. TUBBS JONES. I object to the count-
ing of the electoral votes of the State of 
Ohio. 
(Text of video presentations of 1–6– 
2017.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I object to the certificate 
from the State of Alabama. The electors 
were not lawfully certified. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I object to the 15 votes 
from the State of North Carolina because of 
the massive voter suppression and the clos-
ing of voting booths in early voting—— 
Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. 
There is no debate. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. 16 to 1—— 
Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. And the massive vot-
ing suppression that occurred—— 
Vice President BIDEN. The gentlewoman 
will suspend. 
(Text of video presentations of 1–5– 
2001.) 
Mr. FILNER. I have an objection to the 
electoral votes. 
Ms. WATERS. The objection is in writing, 
and I don’t care that it is not signed by a 
Member of the Senate. 
(Text of video presentations of 1–6– 
2017.) 
Ms. WATERS. I do not wish to debate. I 
wish to ask: Is there one United States Sen-
ator who will join me in this letter of objec-
tion? 
Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. The objection is signed by 
a Member of the House but not yet by a 
Member of the Senate. 
Vice President BIDEN. Well, it is over. 
(Laughter.) 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. And when the 
House 
managers 
realized 
that 
the 
President’s actual words could not 
have incited the riot, as you alleged in 
your Article of Impeachment, you at-
tempted to pivot. You said that raising 
the issue of election security and cast-
ing doubt on the propriety of our elec-
tions was dangerous. 
One of the House managers, Mr. 
CICILLINE, told you that this is not 
about the words Mr. Trump used in iso-
lation. Rather, it is about the big lie, 
the claim that the election was stolen. 
The House managers told you that it is 
the big lie that incited the riot and 
that the big lie was President Trump’s 
claim that the election was not a fair 
election or that the election was sto-
len. 
Claiming an election was stolen, you 
were told, are words that are inciteful 
to a candidate’s followers and cause 
people to respond violently. Claiming 
an election was stolen or not legiti-
mate is something that a candidate 
should never do because he or she 
knows or should know that such a

claim and such words can actually in-
cite violent insurrection, you were 
told. 
Well, it seems that the House man-
agers’ position must actually be a bit 
narrower than that. The House man-
agers’ position really is that, when Re-
publican candidates for office claim an 
election is stolen or that the winner is 
illegitimate, it constitutes inciting an 
insurrection and the candidate should 
know it, but Democratic Party can-
didates for public elective office are 
perfectly entitled to claim the election 
was stolen or that the winner is illegit-
imate or to make any other outrageous 
claim they can. 
It is their absolute right to do so, and 
it is their absolute right to do so irre-
spective of whether there is any evi-
dence to support the claim. Democratic 
candidates can claim that an election 
was stolen because of Russian collusion 
or without any explanation at all, and 
that is perfectly OK and is in no way 
incitement to an insurrection, and 
somehow, when Democratic candidates 
publicly decry an election as stolen or 
illegitimate, it is never a big lie. You 
have been doing it for years. 
(Text of video presentation of 2–10– 
2021.) 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. But can 
you imagine telling your supporters that the 
only way you can possibly lose is if an Amer-
ican election was rigged and stolen from 
you? And ask yourself whether you have ever 
seen anyone at any level of government 
make the same claim about their own elec-
tion. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–14– 
2018.) 
Mr. BROWN. If Stacey Abrams doesn’t win 
in Georgia, they stole it. It’s clear. It’s clear. 
And I say that publicly. It’s clear. 
(Text of video presentation of 5–4– 
2019.) 
Ms. CLINTON. You can run the best cam-
paign—you can even become the nominee— 
and you can have the election stolen from 
you. 
(Text of video presentation of 9–29– 
2019.) 
Ms. CLINTON. He knows he’s an illegit-
imate President. He knows. He knows that 
there were a bunch of different reasons why 
the election turned out the way it did. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–6– 
2018.) 
Ms. Abrams. Votes remain to be counted. 
There are voices that are waiting to be 
heard. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–16– 
2018.) 
Ms. Abrams. And I will not concede. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–18– 
2018.) 
Mr. Tapper. I respect the issues that you’re 
raising, but you’re not answering the ques-
tion. Do you think it was—— 
Ms. Abrams. I am. 
Mr. Tapper. You’re not using the word ‘‘le-
gitimate.’’ 
(Text of video presentations of 1–6– 
2005.) 
Ms. PELOSI. There are still legitimate 
concerns over the integrity of our elections 
and of ensuring the principle of one person, 
one vote. 
Mr. SANDERS. I agree with tens of mil-
lions of Americans who are very worried that 
when they cast a ballot on an electronic vot-
ing machine that there is no paper trail to 
record that vote. 
Ms. PELOSI. But constantly shifting vote 
tallies in Ohio and malfunctioning electronic 
machines which may not have paper receipts 
have led to an additional loss of confidence 
by the public. This is their only opportunity 
to have this debate while the country is lis-
tening, and it is appropriate to do so. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. House Man-
ager CASTRO no longer has to try to 
imagine it thanks to the distinguished 
Senator and others. It didn’t have to be 
this way. The Democrats promised 
unity. They promised to deliver the 
very COVID relief, in the form of $2,000 
stimulus checks, that President Trump 
called for. They should have listened to 
their own words of the past. I leave you 
with the wise words of Congressman 
JERRY NADLER. 
(Text of video presentation of 12–11– 
1998.) 
Mr. NADLER. The effect of impeachment 
is to overturn the popular will of the voters. 
We must not overturn an election and re-
move a President from office except to de-
fend our system of government or our con-
stitutional liberties against the dire threat, 
and we must not do so without an over-
whelming consensus of the American people. 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment supported by 
one of our major political parties and op-
posed by the other. Such an impeachment 
will produce the divisiveness and bitterness 
in our politics for years to come and will call 
into question the very legitimacy of our po-
litical institutions. 
The American people have heard the alle-
gations against the President, and they over-
whelmingly oppose impeaching him. They 
elected President Clinton. They still support 
him. We have no right to overturn the con-
sidered judgment of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, the case against the Presi-
dent has not been made. There is far from 
sufficient evidence to support the allega-
tions, and the allegations, even if proven 
true, do not rise to the level of impeachable 
offenses. 
Mr. Speaker, this is clearly a partisan rail-
road job. The same people who today tell us 
we must impeach the President for lying 
under oath almost to a person voted last 
year to re-elect a Speaker who had just ad-
mitted lying to Congress in an official pro-
ceeding. 
The American people are watching, and 
they will not forget. You may have the 
votes, you may have the muscle, but you do 
not have the legitimacy of a national con-
sensus or of a constitutional imperative. 
This partisan coup d’etat will go down in in-
famy in the history of this Nation. 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Thank you. 
Mr. VAN DER VEEN. Good afternoon 
again, Senators, Mr. President. 
There are two fundamental questions 
for purposes of this free speech anal-
ysis. First, does the First Amendment 
to the Constitution apply in this 
Chamber to these impeachment pro-
ceedings? Second, if it does, do the 
words spoken by Mr. Trump at the El-
lipse on January 6 meet the definition 
of ‘‘constitutional incitement’’ so as to 
void the protections afforded by the 
First Amendment? I will explain why 
the answers to both of these questions 
must be a resounding yes. 
The 
Constitution 
and 
the 
First 
Amendment must certainly apply to 
these impeachment proceedings, and 
Mr. Trump’s speech deserves full pro-
tection under the First Amendment, 
but before getting into the legal anal-
ysis, some preliminary observations 
about the House managers’ case should 
be made. 
First, this case, unfortunately, is 
about political hatred. It has become 
very clear that the House Democrats 
hate Donald Trump. This type of polit-
ical hatred has no place in our political 
institutions and certainly no place in 
the law. This hatred has led the House 
managers to manipulate and selec-
tively edit Mr. Trump’s speech to make 
it falsely appear that he sought to in-
cite the crowd to violently attack the 
Capitol. He didn’t, and we will show 
you why. 
The hatred has also led the House 
managers to make some astounding 
legal arguments. They astoundingly 
urge you to disregard your oath by ig-
noring the First Amendment of the 
Constitution. They also ignore land-
mark binding United States Supreme 
Court 
cases, 
precedents—Wood 
and 
Bond—both of which unequivocally 
hold that elected officials have core 
First Amendment rights to engage in 
the exact type of political speech 
which Mr. Trump engaged in. I was 
shocked the House managers not only 
spent a mere three pages on the First 
Amendment analysis in their trial 
memo but that, yesterday, they spent a 
mere 10 minutes, at the end of their 
case, as a throwaway. What we have 
read and what we have heard is devoid 
of any constitutional analysis, far less 
than what I would expect from a first- 
year law student. They left out land-
mark cases—total intellectual dishon-
esty. 
And, finally, hatred is at the heart of 
the House managers’ frivolous attempt 
to blame Donald Trump for the crimi-
nal acts of the rioters based on double 
hearsay statements of fringe rightwing 
groups based on no real evidence other 
than rank speculation. 
Hatred is a dangerous thing. We all 
have to work to overcome it. Hatred 
should have no place in this Chamber, 
in these proceedings. 
The second observation. 
The Senate is presented with an ex-
traordinary task of sitting in judgment 
of a former President’s words in a 
speech that he gave at a political 
event. The House managers accused 
Mr. Trump of using his words to incite 
the horrific events at the Capitol on 
January 6, but yesterday, they gave 
you a new and novel standard of incite-
ment, 
with 
an 
element 
of 
foreseeability, a negligence concept. 
They cite zero case law. They made it 
up. This task of applying a completely 
made-up legal standard of incitement 
to an impeachment proceeding is truly 
an unprecedented task for the Senate, 
and that is something the Senate must

February 12, 2021 
seriously consider when deciding the 
issue. 
Do you want to create a precedent 
where the Senate will be tasked with 
sitting in judgment as to the meaning 
and implied intent of a President’s 
words or words of any elected official? 
Will that allow and maybe encourage 
a majority party to weaponize the awe-
some power of impeachment against 
the minority to suppress a point of 
view? 
Will the Senate then have to deal 
with constant Articles of Impeachment 
by a majority party accusing minority 
Presidents or other elected officials of 
so-called inciteful or false speeches? 
You can see where this would lead. 
Sadly, we have all seen the political 
rhetoric get ratcheted up over the last 
few years. We have all been witnesses 
to many incendiary words by our offi-
cials at political events, broadcast over 
the media and internet. In each of 
those instances, will there now be Sen-
ate impeachment hearings? 
One last observation. 
We agree with the House managers: 
Context does, indeed, matter. 
The inflammatory rhetoric from our 
elected officials must be considered as 
part of the larger context of Mr. 
Trump’s speech at the Ellipse on Janu-
ary 6. 
The inflammatory language from 
both sides of the aisle has been alarm-
ing, frankly, but this political dis-
course must be considered as part of 
these proceedings to contextualize Mr. 
Trump’s words. 
We have some video to play that 
highlights some of what I am talking 
about. I preface this video by noting I 
am not showing you this video as some 
excuse for Mr. Trump’s speech. This is 
not about—this is not whataboutism. I 
am showing you this to make the point 
that all political speech must be pro-
tected. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Ms. PELOSI. I just don’t even know why 
there aren’t uprisings all over the country. 
Maybe there will be. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. There needs to be unrest 
on the streets for as long as there is unrest 
in our lives. 
Ms. PELOSI. We gotta be ready to throw a 
punch. 
You have to be ready to throw a punch. 
Mr. TESTER. Donald Trump, I think you 
need to go back and punch him in the face. 
Ms. Wallace. I thought he should have 
punched him in the face. 
Mr. BOOKER. I feel like punching him. 
Vice President BIDEN. I’d like to take him 
behind the gym, if I were in high school. 
If we were in high school, I’d take him be-
hind the gym and beat the hell out of him. 
You know, I wish we were in high school. 
I could take him behind the gym. 
Ms. WATERS. I will go and take Trump 
out tonight. 
Ms. WARREN. Take him out now. 
Mr. Depp. When was the last time an actor 
assassinated a President? 
Mr. Wilson. They’re still going to have to 
go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump. 
Mr. Cuomo. Show me where it says that 
protest is supposed to be polite and peaceful. 
Ms. WATERS. And you push back on them, 
and you tell them they are not welcome any-
more, anywhere. 
Madonna. I have thought an awful lot 
about blowing up the White House. 
Mr. BOOKER. Please, get up in the face of 
some Congresspeople. 
Ms. PELOSI. People will do what they do. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to tell you, 
Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You 
have released the whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price. 
Ms. TLAIB. We are going to go in there, we 
are going to impeach the [bleep]. 
Ms. Johnson. This is just a warning to you 
Trumpers: Be careful. Walk lightly. And for 
those of you who are soldiers, make them 
pay. 
Ms. DeGeneres. If you had to be stuck in an 
elevator with either President Trump, MIKE 
PENCE, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? 
Ms. HARRIS. Does one of us have to come 
out alive? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Again, 
I did not show you their robust speech 
to excuse or balance out the speech of 
my client, for I need not. I showed you 
the video because in this political 
forum, all robust speech should be pro-
tected, and it should be protected even-
ly for all of us. 
As a brief aside, we should all reflect 
and acknowledge the rhetoric has got-
ten to be too much and over the top. It 
is grating on the collective well-being 
of the body public, the citizens. Most 
would like it to stop. But the point is, 
when you see speech such as this, you 
have to apply the First Amendment 
evenly, blindly. She is blind, Lady Jus-
tice. 
Question 
No. 
1: 
Does 
the 
First 
Amendment apply to this Chamber in 
these proceedings? 
The House managers’ position, as 
stated in their trial brief, is ‘‘The First 
Amendment does not apply at all to an 
impeachment 
proceeding.’’ 
That 
is 
their position. This is plainly wrong. 
The text of the First Amendment ex-
pressly restricts Congress from regu-
lating speech. 
It says: 
Congress shall make no law respecting an 
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the 
free exercise thereof; or abridging the free-
dom of speech, or of the press; or the right of 
the people peaceably to assemble, and to pe-
tition the Government for a redress of griev-
ances. 
To ignore the Constitution would be 
contrary to the oath of office of a 
United States Senator: 
I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will 
support and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that I will bear true faith and 
allegiance to the same— 
Well, you all know the rest. 
No, the Senate cannot ignore the 
First Amendment. The Constitution 
itself limits the ability of the House to 
impeach to limited items, such as 
‘‘high crimes and misdemeanors.’’ 
The position advanced by the House 
managers is essentially an unlimited 
impeachment standard without con-
stitutional guardrails, unmoored to 
any specific legal test other than the 
unbridled discretion of Congress. 
This is distinctly not the intent of 
the Framers. The Framers were aware 
of the danger of any impeachment 
process that would make the President 
‘‘the mere creature of the Legislature,’’ 
a quote directly from the Framers 
while debating the impeachment proc-
ess on the floor of the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787. The Framers were 
fearful that any impeachment process 
that gave Congress full discretion on 
the standard for impeachment would 
constitute nothing less than a viola-
tion—‘‘a violation of the fundamental 
principle of good Government.’’ 
One Founding Father, James Wilson, 
wrote extensively on the impeachment 
process. Mr. Wilson was a renowned 
legal scholar at the time, a law pro-
fessor at the University of Pennsyl-
vania in Philadelphia. He was a major 
force in drafting and adopting the Con-
stitution in 1787. He served as one of 
the first Supreme—one of the first six 
Supreme Court Justices from 1789 to 
1798. He was appointed by President 
George Washington. In fact, Wilson 
taught the first course on the new Con-
stitution to President Washington and 
his Cabinet—the first in the Nation’s 
history—in Philadelphia at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania in 1789. 
Wilson, in his law lectures, the first 
of their kind under the Constitution, 
plainly states that the Senate may not 
ignore the Constitution in impeach-
ment proceedings. He states that law-
ful and constitutional conduct may not 
be used as an impeachable offense. Let 
me say that again. He states that law-
ful and constitutional conduct may not 
be used as an impeachable offense. 
Read along with me: 
The doctrine of impeachments is of high 
import in the constitutions of free states. On 
one hand, the most powerful magistrates 
should be amenable to the law: on the other 
hand, elevated characters should not be sac-
rificed merely on account of their elevation. 
No one should be secure while he violates the 
constitution and the laws: everyone should 
be secure while he observes them. 
To be clear, James Wilson is saying 
that the Constitution does 
indeed 
apply when judging whether to convict 
an official by impeachment. If the com-
plained-of conduct is constitutional, it 
cannot be impeachable. Are we to ig-
nore the words and teachings of James 
Wilson? The House managers surely 
want you to. 
The House managers have made sev-
eral references to this letter signed by 
140 partisan ‘‘law professors’’ calling 
Mr. Trump’s First Amendment defense 
‘‘legally frivolous.’’ This is really an 
outrageous attempt to intimidate Mr. 
Trump’s lawyers. 
Whenever a lawyer advances a truly 
‘‘frivolous’’ argument, they may vio-
late professional, ethical rules and 
could be subject to discipline. 
This letter is a direct threat to my 
law license, my career, and my family’s 
financial well-being. These ‘‘law profes-
sors’’ should be ashamed of themselves, 
and so should the House managers. 
How dare you? Do you really hate 
Donald Trump so much that you are 
willing to destroy good, hard-working 
people’s lives, people that are only

doing their jobs, and, frankly, as coun-
sel for an accused fulfilling a constitu-
tional role? It is astounding, really. I 
am a citizen, not a politician. 
I know these First Amendment argu-
ments are not anywhere close to frivo-
lous. They are completely meritorious. 
Interestingly, the law professors’ let-
ter was issued on February 5—3 days 
before we even filed our legal brief in 
this matter—and they ignored land-
mark, bedrock Supreme Court cases di-
rectly addressing this issue. 
In our brief, we have a direct quote 
from James Wilson, the Founding Fa-
ther, supporting our position. The di-
rect quote was documented in the 
Founding Father’s original legal papers 
on the subject. He was the primary 
draftsman of the Constitution who 
taught the new Constitution to Presi-
dent Washington. He says so long as 
acts of elected officials like Mr. Trump 
are 
constitutionally 
protected, 
he 
should not be impeached. 
We have landmark U.S. Supreme 
Court 
decisions—Wood 
and 
Bonds, 
which I will explain in detail—sup-
porting our position. 
All of this the House managers and 
the partisan law professors completely 
and misleadingly ignore. 
Frivolous? Hardly. The letter is a 
bully tactic, and I think evidence is the 
House managers know they have a 
problem with the First Amendment de-
fense on the merits, so they are resort-
ing to such tactics. 
The House managers’ suggestion that 
the First Amendment does not apply to 
this impeachment process is com-
pletely untenable. 
Ignoring the First Amendment would 
conflict with the Senators’ oath of of-
fice. It would also conflict with well- 
settled Supreme Court precedent and 
ignore the intent of the Framers of the 
Constitution, such as James Wilson. 
Above all else, ignoring the Constitu-
tion would adopt the new Raskin 
‘‘commonsense’’ doctrine we heard yes-
terday, eroding hundreds of years of 
First Amendment protections. 
We are here under the Constitution. 
It is illogical what the House managers 
said. The Constitution does apply to 
this constitutional impeachment proc-
ess. It is double talk. Nonsense. Illogi-
cal. 
If the House managers had their way, 
they would ignore all of the Constitu-
tion. Does that include the Sixth 
Amendment? The right to counsel? 
They would have Mr. Trump sitting 
here without lawyers. And who would 
be next? It could be anyone—one of you 
or one of you. 
You must reject this invitation to ig-
nore the First Amendment. It is anti- 
American and would set dangerous 
precedent forever. 
The law has developed over the years 
to clearly establish elected officials 
have the right to engage in protected 
speech. Mr. Trump is not just a guy on 
the street or a guy at a bar or a fire 
chief or a police officer—there were a 
few of them in there—all analogies 
given by the House managers. These 
sideways analogies are wrong. Mr. 
Trump was an elected official, and 
there is an entire body of law, Supreme 
Court landmark cases, supporting the 
conclusion that Mr. Trump actually 
has enhanced free speech rights be-
cause he is an elected official. These 
cases are ignored by the House man-
agers and the law professors, and that, 
too, is total intellectual dishonesty. 
The Supreme Court has long held 
that the First Amendment’s right to 
freedom of speech protects elected offi-
cials. 
Two important, on-point decisions 
from the Supreme Court—Wood v. 
Georgia and Bond v. Floyd—expressly 
contradict the House managers’ posi-
tion. The House managers do not even 
cite those cases in their brief. They 
barely acknowledge them in their 
reply, and they were mum on them yes-
terday. 
In Wood v. Georgia, the Supreme 
Court addressed the case involving a 
sitting sheriff whose reelection was 
being investigated by a grand jury 
impaneled by a judge based on allega-
tions of irregular ‘‘Negro bloc voting.’’ 
It was in the sixties. 
The sheriff spoke publicly in mul-
tiple press releases calling the grand 
jury investigations ‘‘racist,’’ ‘‘illegit-
imate,’’ and an attempt to ‘‘intimi-
date’’ voters. He even urged the grand 
jurors on how to decide the issues and 
‘‘not let its high office be a party to 
any political attempt to intimidate’’ 
voters. The sheriff viewed the grand 
jury’s challenging the legitimacy of his 
election. 
The sheriff even sent a letter to the 
grand jurors with these allegations, 
which is an extraordinary step since 
laws in most States, including Georgia, 
prohibit attempts to influence or in-
timidate 
jurors. 
The 
sheriff 
was 
charged and convicted of contempt of 
court and obstruction of the grand 
jury. But the Supreme Court, in a deci-
sion written by Justice Brennan, re-
versed. The Court held that the First 
Amendment protected an elected pub-
lic official’s speech because the voting 
controversy directly affected the sher-
iff’s political career: 
The petitioner was an elected official and 
had the— 
Read with me, please, everybody. 
The petitioner was an elected official and 
had the right to enter the field of political 
controversy, particularly where his political 
life was at stake. The role that elected offi-
cials play in our society makes it all the 
more imperative that they be allowed freely 
to express themselves on matters of current 
public importance. 
Wood thus stands for the proposition 
that a difference of political opinion, 
expressed in speech on an issue of vot-
ing irregularity, cannot be punishable 
where all that was done was to encour-
age investigation and peaceful political 
speech—just like Mr. Trump has done 
here. The legal scholars call that di-
rectly on point. 
A second case, Bond v. Floyd in-
volved a State legislature punishing an 
elected official for protected political 
speech. Bond is particularly instructive 
here, too. In Bond, the Supreme Court 
squarely addressed a question of an 
elected official’s punishment by a leg-
islature for statements alleged to have 
incited public violation of law—the 
burning of draft cards. The Court un-
equivocally 
rejected 
the 
idea—ad-
vanced here by the House managers— 
that an elected official is entitled to no 
protection under the First Amend-
ment. The Supreme Court held that the 
Georgia House of Representatives was 
in fact forbidden by the First Amend-
ment from punishing Bond, by not 
seating him, for advocating against the 
policy of the United States. 
There are three fundamental hold-
ings in Bond. 
No. 1: 
The manifest function of the First Amend-
ment in a representative government re-
quires that legislators be given the widest 
latitude to express their views on issues of 
policy. 
No. 2: 
Just as erroneous statements must be pro-
tected to give freedom of expression the 
breathing space it needs to survive, so state-
ments criticizing public policy and the im-
plementation of it must be similarly pro-
tected. 
Third holding: 
Legislators have an obligation to take po-
sitions on controversial political questions 
so that their constituents can be fully in-
formed by them, and be better able to assess 
their qualifications— 
Please, read along with me— 
their qualifications for office; also so they 
may be represented in governmental debates 
by the person they have elected to represent 
them. 
Mr. Trump enjoys this same First 
Amendment protection from Congress. 
The First Amendment’s protections 
guarantee free speech addressing the 
electoral integrity issues essential to 
his career that Mr. Trump has consist-
ently advocated. 
The House managers argue that ‘‘the 
First 
Amendment’’—and 
I 
quote— 
‘‘does not shield public officials who 
occupy sensitive policymaking posi-
tions from adverse actions when their 
speech 
undermines 
important 
government[al] interests.’’ That is flat 
wrong. They are in essence attempting 
to treat Mr. Trump as their employee. 
This is not the law under Wood and 
Bond. Mr. Trump was elected by the 
people. He is an elected official. The 
Supreme Court says elected officials 
must have the right to freely engage in 
public speech. 
Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly 
rejected the House managers’ argu-
ment in Wood v. Georgia, holding that 
the sheriff was ‘‘not a civil servant,’’ 
but an elected official who had ‘‘core’’ 
First Amendment rights which could 
not be restricted. That is Wood v. Geor-
gia, page 395, footnote 21. 
The House managers do not mention 
Wood or Bond in the trial brief or any-
where else. Why? Why not? Because it 
does not fit their narrative or their

story. They want to punish Mr. Trump 
for engaging in constitutionally pro-
tected free speech and they do not 
want you to consider the issue. But you 
must. 
Question 2: Does Mr. Trump’s speech 
deserve protection under the First 
Amendment? 
There is no doubt Mr. Trump engaged 
in constitutionally protected political 
speech that the House has, improperly, 
characterized as ‘‘incitement of insur-
rection.’’ The fatal flaw of the House’s 
arguments is that it seeks to mete out 
governmental 
punishment—impeach-
ment—based on First Amendment po-
litical speech. 
Speech for political purposes is the 
kind of activity to which the First 
Amendment offers its strongest protec-
tion. These are bedrock principles rec-
ognized by our Supreme Court for dec-
ades. The Court has stated in no uncer-
tain terms the importance of these 
principles to our democratic principles: 
The general proposition that freedom of 
expression upon public questions is secured 
by the First Amendment has long been set-
tled by our decisions. The constitutional 
safeguard, we have said, ‘‘was fashioned to 
assure unfettered interchange of ideas for 
the bringing about of political and social 
changes desired by the people.’’ 
New York Times v. Sullivan. 
Our First Amendment decisions have cre-
ated a rough hierarchy in the constitutional 
protection of speech. Core political speech 
occupies the highest, most protected posi-
tion. . . . 
Even political speech that may incite 
unlawful conduct is protected from the 
reach of government punishment. The 
Court has said: 
Every idea is an incitement, and if speech 
may be suppressed whenever it might inspire 
someone to act unlawfully, then there is no 
limit to the State’s censorial power. 
The government may not prohibit 
speech because it increases the chances 
of an unlawful act will be committed 
‘‘at some indefinite time’’ in the fu-
ture. The House managers showed you 
a series of tweets going all the way 
back to 2015 in an effort to prove ‘‘in-
citement.’’ All of that evidence is to-
tally irrelevant under the constitu-
tional definition of incitement. 
Brandenburg v. Ohio is really the 
landmark case on the issue of incite-
ment speeches. The applicable case was 
mentioned yesterday. In the Branden-
burg v. Ohio case, another landmark, 
the Court held the government may 
only—the government may only—sup-
press speech for advocating the use of 
force or a violation of law if ‘‘such ad-
vocacy is directed to inciting or pro-
ducing imminent lawless action and is 
likely to incite or produce such ac-
tion.’’ 
The Brandenburg holding has been 
interpreted 
as 
having 
three 
basic 
prongs to determine if speech meets 
the definition of ‘‘incitement.’’ 
The Brandenburg test precludes speech 
from being sanctioned as incitement to a 
riot unless— 
This is one— 
the speech explicitly or implicitly encour-
aged use of violence or lawless action, 
Two: 
the speaker intends that his speech will re-
sult in use of violence or lawless action, 
and— 
Three— 
the imminent use of violence or lawless ac-
tion is the likely result of the speech. 
The House managers cannot get past 
the first prong of the Brandenburg test. 
They have not and cannot prove Mr. 
Trump explicitly or implicitly encour-
aged use of violence or lawless action— 
period. 
Brandenburg requires a close exam-
ination of the words themselves. The 
words are either important or they are 
not. The House managers admitted 
that the incitement issue is not about 
the words. Why not? Because on the 
face of it, Mr. Trump’s words are no 
different than the figurative speech 
used by every one of the Senators as-
sembled here today. If it is not about 
the words but about the ‘‘Big Lie’’ of a 
‘‘stolen election’’ then why isn’t House 
Manager RASKIN guilty, since he tried 
to overturn the 2016 election? The more 
the House managers speak, the more 
hypocrisy gets revealed—hypocrisy. 
Even though they say it is not about 
the words, the law under Brandenburg 
requires a close analysis of the words 
to determine incitement. So we need to 
look at those words. 
Mr. Trump did the opposite of advo-
cating for lawless action—the opposite. 
He expressly advocated for peaceful ac-
tion at the Save America rally. He ex-
plicitly stated—these are the words: 
I know that everyone here will soon be 
marching over to the Capitol building to 
peacefully 
and 
patriotically 
make 
your 
voices heard. 
‘‘To 
peacefully 
and 
patriotically 
make your voices heard’’—that is how 
this President has spoken for years 
when he condemns violence, lawless-
ness, and rioters. 
The House managers have played ma-
nipulated, selectively edited parts of 
Mr. Trump’s speech. They focus heav-
ily on the word ‘‘fight.’’ The President 
used the word ‘‘fight’’ 20 times in his 
speech. They picked only two. Why? 
Why not the other 18? Because they 
don’t tell the story in the way they 
want to tell it. 
Here are all of them. Listen to the 
context. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. And, Rudy, you did a 
great job. He’s got guts. You know what? 
He’s got guts unlike a lot of people in the 
Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights. 
He fights. I’ll tell you. 
Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. 
I watched. That is a tough act to follow, 
those two. 
There’s so many weak Republicans. And we 
have great ones. JIM JORDAN and some of 
these guys—they’re out there fighting. The 
House guys are fighting. But it’s—it’s incred-
ible. 
Many of the Republicans, I helped them 
get in. I helped them get elected. 
Did you see the other day where Joe Biden 
said: I want to get rid of the America First 
policy? What’s that all about? Get rid of. 
How do you say I want to get rid of America 
First? Even if you’re going to do it, don’t 
talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we 
have to go through. What we have to go 
through. 
And you have to get your people to fight. 
And if they don’t fight, we have to primary 
the hell out of the ones that don’t fight. You 
primary them. We’re going to. We’re going to 
let you know who they are. I can already tell 
you, frankly. 
Republicans are constantly fighting like a 
boxer with his hands tied behind his back. 
It’s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. 
We want to be so respectful of everybody, in-
cluding bad people. And we’re going to have 
to fight much harder. 
And Mike Pence is going to have to come 
through for us, and if he doesn’t, that will be 
a, a sad day for our country, because you’re 
sworn to uphold our Constitution. 
And the accountability says if we see 
somebody in there that doesn’t treat our 
vets well or they steal, they rob, they do 
things badly, we say: Joe you’re fired. Get 
out of here. 
Before you couldn’t do that. You couldn’t 
do that before. 
So we’ve taken care of things. We’ve done 
things like nobody’s ever thought possible. 
And that’s part of the reason that many peo-
ple don’t like us, because we’ve done too 
much. But we’ve done it quickly. 
And we were going to sit home and watch 
a big victory, and everybody had us down for 
a victory. It was going to be great and now 
we’re out here fighting. I said to somebody, 
I was going to take a few days and relax 
after our big electoral victory. 10 o’clock it 
was over. 
The American people do not believe the 
corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ru-
ined their reputation. But you know, it used 
to be that they’d argue with me. I’d fight. So 
I’d fight, they’d fight, I’d fight, they’d fight. 
Pop pop. You’d believe me, you’d believe 
them. Somebody comes out. You know, they 
had their point of view; I had my point of 
view. But you’d have an argument. 
Now what they do is they go silent. It’s 
called suppression, and that’s what happens 
in a Communist country. That’s what they 
do. They suppress. You don’t fight with them 
anymore unless it’s a bad story. They have a 
little bad story about me. They make it 10 
times worse, and it’s a major headline. 
But Hunter Biden, they don’t talk about 
him. What happened to Hunter? Where’s 
Hunter? 
With your help over the last four years, we 
built the greatest political movement in the 
history of our country and nobody even chal-
lenges that. 
I say that over and over, and I never get 
challenged by the fakeness, and they chal-
lenge almost everything we say. 
But our fight against the big donors, big 
media, big tech, and others is just getting 
started. This is the greatest in history. 
There’s never been a movement like that. 
Our brightest days are before us. Our 
greatest achievements, still away. 
I think one of our great achievements will 
be election security. Because nobody until I 
came along had any idea how corrupt our 
elections were. 
And again, most people would stand there 
at 9 o’clock in the evening and say I want to 
thank you very much, and they go off to 
some other life. But I said something’s 
wrong here, something is really wrong, can 
have happened. 
And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you 
don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have 
a country anymore. 
Our exciting adventures and boldest en-
deavors have not yet begun. My fellow Amer-
icans, for our movement, for our children, 
and for our beloved country.

And I say this despite all that’s happened. 
The best is yet to come. 
‘‘A boxer fighting with his hand tied 
behind his back’’? ‘‘Members of Con-
gress fighting’’? ‘‘Rudy being Rudy.’’ 
These are the metaphorical, rhetorical 
uses of the word ‘‘fight.’’ We all know 
that, right? 
Suddenly, the word ‘‘fight’’ is off lim-
its. Spare us the hypocrisy and false in-
dignation. It is a term used over and 
over and over again by politicians on 
both sides of the aisle. And, of course, 
the Democrat House Managers know 
that the word ‘‘fight’’ has been used 
figuratively in political speech forever. 
But don’t take it from me. It is best to 
listen to them.

Hypocrisy. The reality is, Mr. Trump 
was not in any way, shape, or form in-
structing these people to fight or to 
use physical violence. What he was in-
structing them to do was to challenge 
their opponents in primary elections, 
to push for sweeping election reforms, 
to hold Big Tech responsible—all cus-
tomary and legal ways to petition your 
government for redress of grievances, 
which, of course, is also protected con-
stitutional speech. 
But the House Managers don’t want 
you to focus on those things because, 
again, it does not fit their story. In the 
end, I leave you with this quote from 
Benjamin Franklin: 
Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a 
free government; when this support is taken 
away, the constitution of a free society is 
dissolved, and tyranny is erected on its 
ruins. 
Thank you. 
RECESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate re-
cess for a 15-minute break. 
There being no objection, at 1:53 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 2:34 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the President 
pro tempore. 
COUNSELS’ PRESENTATION—CONTINUED 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who 
seeks recognition? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. I do, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
Castor is recognized. 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President, 
Members of the Senate, good after-
noon. 
It has been my great privilege over 
the past couple of weeks to lead this 
outstanding team of lawyers and dedi-
cated professionals in the defense of 
the 
45th 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States. One of the most difficult things 
in leading such a talented group is de-
ciding who is responsible for what and 
the strategy and the order in which we 
will present our evidence. 
You have heard from Mr. van der 
Veen and Mr. Schoen on the impor-
tance of the First Amendment and the 
importance of due process of law, and 
because I had the opportunity to set 
out the schedule, I decided that I would 
take the last substantive part of the 
case for myself. You can take that two 
ways. The first, perhaps, is the best, 
and that would be that it is almost 
over. The second is that perhaps you 
have to wait another hour for it to be 
over. 
The reason why I chose this section— 
and believe me, it was a very difficult 
decision to make because I thought 
that the other arguments presented by 
Mr. Schoen and Mr. van der Veen were 
outstandingly researched, thoroughly 
vetted, 
and 
wonderfully 
and 
articulately presented by them. But 
the critical issue in this case is the 
very narrow issue that is charged 
against the 45th President, and that 
issue is, did the 45th President engage 
in incitement of—they continue to say 
‘‘insurrection’’? Clearly, there was no 
insurrection. 
‘‘Insurrection’’ is a term of art de-
fined in the law, and it involves taking 
over a country, a shadow government, 
taking the TV stations over, and hav-
ing some plan on what you are going to 
do when you finally take power. Clear-
ly, this is not that. What our col-
leagues here across the aisle meant is 
incitement to violence, to riot. So the 
word ‘‘incitement’’ is the critical case 
and the critical issue in the case. 
Now, the first time that you heard 
from us, I told you that you would 
never hear from our side that what 
happened on January 6 was anything 
other than horrific and that the 45th 
President of the United States and his 
lawyers and his entire team adamantly 
denounce that violence by those crimi-
nals that occurred in this very Cham-
ber, this very building. 
There was a reason why we started 
our presentation back on Tuesday in 
that way, because I did not want the 
Senators to consider that there was 
any challenge to that particular fact. 
Yet the House managers, knowing it 
was not contested at all, chose to spend 
14-plus hours showing you pictures of 
how horrific the attack on the United 
States Capitol was. They spent no time 
at all in connecting legally the attack 
on the Capitol to the 45th President of 
the United States, which is the only 
question that needs to be answered, is, 
Was Donald Trump responsible for in-
citing the violence that came to this 
building on January 6? 
Now, by any measure, President 
Trump is the most pro-police, anti-mob 
rule President this country has ever 
seen. His real supporters know this. He 
made it clear throughout his Presi-
dency. He made it clear during the vio-
lence this past summer. He made it 
clear 
on 
January 
6. 
But 
politics 
changes things. Politics has created 
and interposed an element that should

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S679 
February 12, 2021 
not be here. It has interposed the ele-
ment of hatred. And the political world 
changes when hatred becomes part of 
the dynamic. 
As we wrote in our answer to the 
original 
charging 
document—and 
I 
hope that this is a phrase that lives on 
long after we are all departed and I 
hope someday this becomes the mantra 
by which all of us operate who work for 
the benefit of the public—that political 
hatred has no place in the American 
justice system and most certainly no 
place in the Congress of the United 
States. 
To illustrate the contrast that I am 
speaking of, we have a video. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
President TRUMP. I am your President of 
law and order and an ally of all peaceful pro-
testers. 
Vice President BIDEN. The vast majority 
of the protests have been peaceful. 
President TRUMP. Republicans stand for 
law and order, and we stand for justice. 
Ms. PELOSI. I just don’t even know why 
there aren’t uprisings all over the country, 
and maybe there will be. 
President TRUMP. My administration will 
always stand against violence, mayhem, and 
disorder. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. There needs to be unrest 
in the streets for as long as there is unrest in 
our lives. 
President TRUMP. I stand with the heroes 
of law enforcement. 
Ms. WATERS. (Inaudible.) 
You tell them that they are not welcome 
anymore, anywhere. 
President TRUMP. We will never defund 
our police. Together, we will ensure that 
America is a nation of law and order. 
Vice President BIDEN. If I were in high 
school, I would take him behind the gym and 
beat the hell out of him. 
Mr. TESTER. I think you need to go back 
and punch him in the face. 
Mr. BOOKER. I feel like punching him. 
President TRUMP. We just want law and 
order. Everybody wants that. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to tell you, 
Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You 
have released the whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price. 
President TRUMP. If we want law and 
order, we have to have law and order. 
Mr. Cuomo. Show me where it says that 
protesters are supposed to be polite and 
peaceful. 
President TRUMP. We believe in safe 
streets, secure communities, and we believe 
in law and order. 
Is there truly anyone in this Cham-
ber who disagrees with the words as 
spoken by President Trump on that 
video? Surely not. Surely not. 
This contrast and in this context, I 
ask you to keep that in mind. My col-
leagues here—actually, my colleague 
here, Mr. RASKIN, hopes that you don’t. 
They have used selective editing and 
manipulated visuals to paint a picture 
far different from this truth. 
Make no mistake, and I will repeat it 
now and anytime I am ever asked, Jan-
uary 6 was a terrible day for our coun-
try. 
The 
attack 
on 
this 
building 
shocked us all. President Trump did 
not incite or cause the horrific vio-
lence that occurred on January 6, 2021. 
They know that. We know the Presi-
dent did not incite the riot because of 
his plain words that day, as Mr. van der 
Veen elucidated on a few moments ago. 
We know the President could not have 
incited 
the 
riots 
because 
of 
the 
timeline of the events of that day. 
We heard a great deal from the House 
managers about their prosecutorial 
bona fides and their ability to analyze 
evidence, apply it to statutes, use 
timelines, and figure out what hap-
pened based on circumstantial evidence 
and direct evidence and testimony and 
forensic analysis. I can’t recall any of 
the House managers who got up that 
didn’t make some reference to prosecu-
torial bona fides. Well, I spent more 
than three decades locking up killers. 
And I do know a little bit about apply-
ing facts to the law. 
We know that the President would 
never have wanted such a riot to occur 
because his longstanding hatred for 
violent protesters and his love for law 
and order is on display, worn on his 
sleeve every single day that he served 
in the White House. But if we are going 
to apply the facts to the statute, it has 
to be done systematically. It has to be 
done with precision, the way a court 
would expect us to do that. 
Let’s look at the letter of the law. 
Again, Mr. van der Veen gave you an 
overview of the Brandenburg case and 
some of the related cases. You notice 
that when Mr. Van der Veen listed the 
elements that he took verbatim or 
close to verbatim right out of Branden-
burg, they bore no reference whatso-
ever to the elements that flashed up by 
the Democratic managers the other 
day repeatedly. He actually used the 
Supreme Court’s case. He didn’t make 
it up. 
Let’s look at the letter of the law. 
The Supreme Court of the United 
States, over 50 years ago, laid out a 
clear test to determine whether speech 
is incitement. Under that test, the 
Brandenburg v. Ohio test, there are 
three elements that must be proven be-
yond a reasonable doubt, by a prepon-
derance of the evidence—whatever the 
Senate considers—I suggest beyond a 
reasonable doubt. 
First, the speech in question must 
explicitly or implicitly encourage the 
use of violence or lawless action. But 
here the President’s speech called for 
peaceful protests. 
Second, the speaker must intend that 
his speech will result in the use of vio-
lence or lawless action. And, again, as 
Mr. van der Veen pointed out, the 
President clearly deplores rioters and 
political violence and did so through-
out his term as President and never 
hesitated to express his admiration for 
the men and women that protect this 
country. 
Finally, the third element under the 
Brandenburg test is the imminent use 
of 
violence—imminent 
use 
of 
vio-
lence—in other words, right then. The 
imminent use of violence or lawless ac-
tion must be the likely result of the 
speech—the likely result of the speech. 
Well, that argument is completely 
eviscerated by the fact that the vio-
lence was preplanned, as confirmed by 
the FBI, Department of Justice, and 
even the House managers—not the re-
sult of the speech at all. 
Several of my colleagues of the 
House managers got up and spoke 
about the proceeding in the House 
being like a grand jury proceeding. 
Well, I have been in grand jury pro-
ceedings. I have run grand juries. In 
grand jury proceedings, you call wit-
nesses; you hear evidence; you make 
transcripts; you take affidavits; you 
develop physical evidence; you hear re-
ports from police officers; you hear fo-
rensic analysis from scientists; in fact, 
you invite the target of the grand jury 
to come in and testify if he or she 
pleases to be heard by the grand jury. 
Which one of those things happened 
in the House prior to the Impeachment 
Article? I don’t believe any of them 
happened. So the suggestion that what 
happened in the House was anything at 
all like a grand jury investigating a 
case and referring it for prosecution is 
complete nonsense. And if the House 
managers are trying to fool you about 
that, you must ask yourself: What else 
are they trying to fool you about? 
Let’s look more closely at the Presi-
dent’s speech. We have mentioned this 
lie before, but it is so critical, we need 
to talk about it again. The President 
asked that the attendees at his rally 
peacefully make their voices heard. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. I know that everyone 
here will soon be marching over to the Cap-
itol Building to peacefully and patriotically 
make your voices heard. 
The managers would have you believe 
that the President’s supporters usually 
follow his every word but, in this case, 
imputing some imaginary meaning to 
them while ignoring his most clear in-
structions. 
President 
Trump 
said 
‘‘peacefully and patriotically make 
your voices heard.’’ And the House 
managers took from that ‘‘go down to 
the Capitol and riot.’’ So you are sup-
posed to put yourselves in the heads of 
the people who hear ‘‘peacefully and 
patriotically make your voices heard’’ 
and conclude that those words do not 
mean what the President said. 
More than that, the President criti-
cized the destruction wrought by left-
wing anarchists and rioters. He told his 
supporters that they build; they don’t 
destroy. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. If this happened to the 
Democrats, there’d be hell all over the coun-
try going on. There’d be hell all over the 
country. But just remember this: You’re 
stronger. You’re smarter. You’ve got more 
going than anybody. And they try and de-
mean everybody having to do with us. And 
you’re the real people. You’re the people 
that built this Nation. You’re not the people 
that tore down our Nation. 
Is it possible, listening to those 
words in the proper cadence without 
them 
being 
edited 
or 
the 
sound 
changed so that they are indistinguish-
able or sounds as though the crowd is 
right there, but listening to it here as 
you have here, unedited by us—is it

possible that President Trump’s dis-
dain for political violence could be any 
clearer to the persons listening as he 
was speaking? 
Is it possible his words could have 
been misunderstood? 
I suggest to you that is the possi-
bility. 
Now, the House managers said the 
President told the crowd: ‘‘You have to 
get [out] your people to fight.’’ The 
House managers’ claim is that the 
President of the United States was tell-
ing the audience to get each other to 
physically fight, but that is not what 
the President said. 
The people who should fight, he said, 
were Members of Congress. If they 
don’t fight, what the President said is, 
what should the rally attendees do? If 
Members of Congress wouldn’t fight for 
the principles they held dear, what was 
it that the President specifically told 
his supporters at that rally he wanted 
them to do? He wanted them to support 
primary challenges. 
Now, nobody in this Chamber is anx-
ious to have a primary challenge. That 
is one truism I think I can say with 
some certainty. But that is the way we 
operate in this country. When the peo-
ple of a State want to change their 
Representatives and their Senators, 
they use the electoral process. Presi-
dent Trump told his listeners that if 
their Members of Congress won’t fight 
for their views, then go back home and 
find others that will. That is what 
President Trump said—the people who 
should fight were the Members of Con-
gress. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. ‘‘You have to get 
your people to fight,’’ he told them. 
President TRUMP. You have to get your 
people to fight. And if they don’t fight, we 
have to primary the hell out of the ones that 
don’t fight. You primary them. We’re going 
to let you know who they are. I can already 
tell you, frankly. 
It is pretty stark contrast when you 
watch that video, isn’t it? When you 
see the House manager tell you—and I 
don’t know if we’re under oath here, 
but when I walked into this room, I 
sure as heck felt as if I was under oath 
and felt like I was speaking not only to 
Senators of the United States but be-
fore the entire world and with God 
watching. 
And a House manager got up here and 
told you that the President of the 
United States, on January 6, 2021, told 
the crowd that they had to go and 
fight. And the implication that they 
wanted you to draw was that he was 
sending them down to Capitol Hill to 
go and breach the building and trash 
the very sacred Halls of Congress. 
But we now know that is not at all 
anything near what the President said. 
What the President said was: If you 
can’t get your Members of Congress to 
do as you would like them to do, you 
primary them. That is the American 
way. 
The first way that the House man-
agers presented and wanted you to con-
clude, that is the criminal way. But 
what the President said was the Amer-
ican way. 
Again, the House managers manipu-
lated President Trump’s words. I can’t 
stand here and pretend to tell you that 
I know every time from all those vid-
eos that the House managers manipu-
lated what the President said, put up 
evidence that was not with the founda-
tion of correctness and admissibility 
we expect. I can’t tell you that I picked 
up every one. I don’t think Mr. van der 
Veen or Mr. Schoen or any of the oth-
ers who worked with us can tell you 
that. 
But what I can tell you is there were 
an awful lot of times. And I know at 
least some of you were judges in pre-
vious lives. If one of the lawyers was 
able to create the impression that one 
side intentionally presented false or 
misleading evidence, that judge would 
give an instruction called falsus in uno, 
falsus in omnibus: False in one thing, 
false in everything. In other words, if 
they are trying to fool you about one 
thing, not only might they be trying to 
fool you in something else, but under 
that maxim of the law, you may con-
clude they are trying to fool you in ev-
erything else. 
President Trump was immediate in 
his calls for calm and respect for law 
enforcement. The House managers em-
phasized President Trump’s tweet in 
the 6 p.m. hour where he told the 
crowds: 
Go home with love & in peace. Remember 
this day. 
What is it they left out? Well, the 
House starts their recitation of what 
President Trump said as far as the 
aftermath of when the Capitol was 
breached at roughly 6 p.m. What they 
don’t tell you and didn’t tell you—and 
which you probably don’t know be-
cause I think I am the first one to say 
it in this forum—is at 2:38, President 
Trump urged protesters at the U.S. 
Capitol to stay peaceful: 
Please support our Capitol Police and Law 
Enforcement. They are truly on the side of 
our Country. Stay peaceful! 
Before we run the graphic, I just 
want to point out to you, President 
Trump’s speech ended at 1:11 p.m. So at 
2:38 p.m., by the time word reaches the 
President that there is a problem down 
here, he is out urging people to support 
the police, stay peaceful, support our 
Capitol Police and law enforcement. 
They are on the side of the country. 
Stay peaceful. 
At 3:13 p.m., President Trump urged 
protesters at the U.S. Capitol to re-
main peaceful: 
No violence. Remember, WE are the Party 
of Law and Order. Respect the law and our 
great men and women in blue. 
3:13 p.m. 
President Trump’s words couldn’t 
have incited the riot at the Capitol. 
The day’s events make this clear. Let’s 
walk through the actual timeline. 
At 11:15 a.m. police security camera 
videos show crowds forming at First 
Street, near the Capitol Reflecting 
Pool. This is a full 45 minutes before 
President Trump even took the stage 
on January 6. Let me repeat that. Vio-
lent criminals were assembling at the 
Capitol, over a mile away, almost an 
hour before the President uttered a sin-
gle word on the Ellipse. You did not 
hear that fact during the hours and 
hours of the House managers’ presen-
tation, did you? 
When the President spoke, what did 
he 
call 
for? 
He 
called 
for 
rally 
attendees to peacefully and patrioti-
cally make their voices heard, for them 
to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to 
cheer on Members of Congress. 
President Trump went on for more 
than an hour, ending at 1:11. Now, why 
is this important? Because of all of the 
events that I am about to describe, 
they 
all 
occurred 
before—before— 
President Trump’s remarks concluded. 
At 12:49 p.m., the first barriers at the 
U.S. Capitol Grounds were pushed over, 
and the crowd entered the restricted 
area. 
At 1:05 p.m., Acting Defense Sec-
retary 
Christopher 
Miller 
received 
open source reports of demonstrator 
movements to the U.S. Capitol. 
At 1:09 p.m., U.S. Capitol Police Chief 
Steven Sund called the House and Sen-
ate Sergeant at Arms, telling them he 
wanted an emergency declared, and he 
wanted the National Guard called. 
The point: Given the timeline of 
events, the criminals at the Capitol 
were not there at the Ellipse to even 
hear the President’s words. They were 
more than a mile away, engaged in 
their preplanned assault on this very 
building. This was a preplanned as-
sault—make no mistake—and that is a 
critical fact. 
Watch this. 
(Text of video presentation of 2–10– 
2021.) 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Does anyone in 
this Chamber honestly believe that but for 
the conduct of President Trump that that 
charge in the Article of Impeachment, that 
that attack on the Capitol would have oc-
curred? Does anybody believe that? 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. Blitzer. It was not some sort of sponta-
neous decision by a bunch of ‘‘protesters’’ to 
go up to Capitol Hill and storm Capitol Hill. 
This was all planned out. 
Mr. Tapper. How much of it was planned? 
How much of this was strategized ahead of 
time? 
Mr. Perez. They are getting indications, 
some evidence that indicates that there was 
some level of planning. 
Ms. 
Quijano. 
There 
appears 
to 
be 
premeditation. 
Mr. Muir. An FBI internal report the day 
before the siege, warning of a violent war at 
the Capitol. 
Ms. Quijano. The FBI issued a warning of a 
‘‘war’’ at the Capitol. 
Mr. Colbert. The FBI warned law enforce-
ment agencies about this specific attack. 
(Text of audio presentation.) 
Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear 
glass breaking, doors being kicked in. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. D’Antuono. We developed some intel-
ligence that a number of individuals were 
planning to travel to the DC area with inten-
tions to cause violence. We immediately 
shared that information.

Ms. Herridge. And they pushed out that in-
formation through this JTTF structure. 
Mr. D’Antuono. It was immediately dis-
seminated through a written product and 
briefed to our command post operation to all 
levels of law enforcement. 
Unidentified Speaker. The FBI says two 
pipe bombs discovered near the Capitol on 
January 6 were placed there the night before. 
Unidentified Speaker. New video appears 
to show a person suspected of planting pipe 
bombs near the U.S. Capitol the night before. 
Unidentified Speaker. The FBI now says 
the bombs were planted the night before the 
Capitol siege, between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. 
Mr. Muir. They were planted the day be-
fore. 
Ms. Herridge. It all goes to the idea of 
premeditation and coordination among indi-
viduals. 
Mr. Comey. This was a planned assault of 
people going after a castle. 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. So, to answer 
the question of the House manager, 
‘‘Does anybody believe that this would 
have occurred but for the speech of 
Donald Trump?’’ I do. 
All of these facts make clear that the 
January 6 speech did not cause the 
riots. The President did not cause the 
riots. He neither explicitly nor implic-
itly encouraged the use of violence or 
lawless action but, in fact, called for 
the peaceful exercise of every Ameri-
can’s First Amendment right to peace-
fully assemble and petition their gov-
ernment for redress of grievances. In 
other words, the Brandenburg standard 
is not made out. 
The House managers admitted many 
facts 
are 
unknown. 
Even 
Speaker 
PELOSI admitted not knowing the real 
cause of the violence when she called 
for a 9/11-style Commission to examine 
the facts and causes that led to the vio-
lence. 
(Text of audio presentation.) 
On the screen is Speaker PELOSI’s 
call for the 9/11 Commission. 
Let’s touch now on the second absurd 
and conflated allegation in the House 
managers’ single Article. 
President Trump’s phone call to 
Georgia 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Brad 
Raffensperger—surreptitiously 
re-
corded, by the way—included multiple 
attorneys and others on the call. Let 
me point out the very obvious fact that 
the House managers ignored. The pri-
vate call that was made public by oth-
ers cannot really be the basis to claim 
that the President intended to incite a 
riot, because he did not publicly dis-
close the contents of the call. 
How could he have hoped to use this 
call to invite his followers if he had no 
intent to make the conversation public 
and, indeed, had nothing to do with its 
being secretly recorded? 
The House managers told you that 
the President demanded that the Geor-
gia secretary of state ‘‘find’’ just over 
11,000 votes. The word ‘‘find,’’ like so 
many others the House managers high-
lighted, is taken completely out of con-
text. The word ‘‘find’’ did not come out 
of thin air. Based on an analysis of 
publicly available voter data that the 
ballot rejection rate in Georgia in 2016 
was approximately 6.42 percent and 
even though a tremendous amount of 
new, first-time mail-in ballots were in-
cluded in the 2020 count, the Georgia 
rejection rate in 2020 was a mere four- 
tenths of 1 percent—a drop-off from 6.42 
percent to .4 percent. 
President Trump wanted the signa-
ture verification to be done in public. 
How can a request for signature verifi-
cations to be done in public be a basis 
for a charge for inciting a riot? 
With that background, it is clear 
that President Trump’s comments and 
the use of the word ‘‘find’’ were solely 
related to his concerns with the inex-
plicable dramatic drop in Georgia’s 
ballot rejection rates. 
Let’s examine how the word ‘‘find’’ 
was used throughout that conversa-
tion. 
Mr. Trump’s first use of the word 
‘‘find’’ was as follows: 
We think that, if you check the signatures, 
a real check of the signatures going back in 
Fulton County, you will find at least a cou-
ple hundred thousand of forged signatures of 
people who have been forged, and we are 
quite sure that’s going to happen. 
President Trump also used ‘‘find’’ as 
follows: 
Now, why aren’t we doing signature, and 
why can’t it be open to the public, and why 
can’t we have professionals do it instead of 
rank amateurs who will never find anything 
and don’t want to find anything? They don’t 
want to find—you know, they don’t want to 
find anything. Someday, you’ll tell me the 
reason why, because I don’t understand your 
reasoning, but, someday, you’ll tell me the 
reason why, but why don’t you want to find? 
President Trump echoed his previous 
sentiments again in the context of pur-
suing a legitimate and robust inves-
tigation into the lack of signature veri-
fication for mail-in and absentee bal-
lots. 
And why can’t we have professionals do it 
instead of rank amateurs who will never find 
anything and don’t want to find anything? 
They don’t want to find anything. You know, 
they don’t want to find anything. They don’t 
want to find—you know, they don’t want to 
find anything. Someday, you’ll tell me why, 
because I don’t understand your reasoning, 
but, someday, you’ll tell me why, but why 
don’t you want to find? 
We can go through signature verification, 
and we’ll find hundreds of thousands of sig-
natures, and you could let us do it, and the 
only way you can do it, as you know, is to go 
to the past, but you didn’t do that in Cobb 
County. You just looked at one page com-
pared to another. The only way you could do 
a signature verification is to go from one 
that’s signed on November ‘‘whatever,’’ re-
cently, and compare it to 2 years ago, 4 years 
ago, 6 years ago, you know, or even 1, and 
you’ll find that you have many different sig-
natures, but in Fulton, where they dumped 
ballots, you will find that you have many 
that aren’t even signed and that you have 
many forgeries. 
Mr. Trump continued to use the word 
‘‘find’’ throughout the conversation, 
each and every other time in the con-
text 
of 
his 
request 
that 
Mr. 
Raffensperger undertake a review of 
signature verifications and his con-
cerns, generally, with ballot integrity 
and his reported electoral deficit. Here 
are a few examples. 
But why wouldn’t you want to find the 
right answer, Brad? Instead of keep saying 
that the numbers are right, because those 
numbers are so wrong. 
Another example: 
We think that, if you check the signa-
tures—a real check of the signatures—going 
back in Fulton County, you will find at least 
a couple hundred thousand of forged signa-
tures of people who have been forged, and we 
are quite sure that’s going to happen. 
Moreover, there was nothing unto-
ward with President Trump or any 
other 
candidate, 
for 
that 
matter, 
speaking with the lead elections officer 
of the State. That is why the Georgia 
secretary of state took a call, along 
with members of his team, one of 
whom decided to record it and release 
it to the press. The only reason this 
conversation is being discussed in this 
Chamber is because, once again, the 
media and their Democratic allies dis-
torted the true conversation to mislead 
you and the American public. So we 
have a complete lack of evidence to the 
Article of Impeachment presented by 
the House managers. 
So why are we here? 
Politics. Their goal is to eliminate a 
political opponent, to substitute their 
judgment for the will of the voters. 
(Text of video presentations.) 
Mr. Capehart. Why bother with a Senate 
trial of Donald Trump? He’s no longer Presi-
dent. 
Mr. Pelley. He will be out of office anyway. 
Ms. Wallace. Is it to keep him from ever 
running again? 
Ms. DEGETTE. To make sure he may never 
run for office again. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. To keep him from 
running for office again. 
Mr. KAINE. So Donald Trump will not be 
able to run for office again. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Barring him from running

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. To disqualify him from 
running for office. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. To dis-
qualify him from ever running for office 
again. 
Mr. SCHIFF. To disqualify him from run-

Mr. Emanuel. It’s about focusing so that 
he can never run again. 
Mr. SCHUMER. To remove him from ever 
running for office again. 
Mr. POCAN. To never be able to run for of-

Ms. KLOBUCHAR. To ban former Presi-

Mr. GREEN of Texas. If we don’t impeach 
this President, he will get reelected. 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. The goal is to 
eliminate a political opponent, to sub-
stitute their judgment for the will of 
the voters. 
Members of the Senate, our country 
needs to get back to work. I know that 
you know that, but, instead, we are 
here. The majority party promised to 
unify and deliver more COVID relief, 
but, instead, they did this. We will not 
take most of our time today—us of the 
defense—in the hopes that you will 
take back these hours and use them to 
get delivery of COVID relief to the 
American people. 
Let us be clear. This trial is about far 
more than President Trump. It is about

silencing and banning the speech the 
majority does not agree with. It is 
about canceling 75 million Trump vot-
ers and criminalizing political view-
points. 
That is what this trial is really 
about. It is the only existential issue 
before us. It asks for constitutional 
cancel culture to take over in the 
United States Senate. 
Are we going to allow canceling and 
banning and silencing to be sanctioned 
in this body? 
To the Democrats, who view this as a 
moment of opportunity, I urge you in-
stead to look to the principles of free 
expression and free speech. I hope, 
truly, that the next time you are in the 
minority, you don’t find yourself in 
this position. 
To the Republicans in this Chamber, 
I ask when you are next in the major-
ity, please resist what will be an over-
whelming temptation to do this very 
same thing to the opposing party. 
Members of the Senate, this con-
cludes the formal defense of the 45th 
President of the United States to the 
Impeachment 
Article 
filed 
by 
the 
House of Representatives. 
I understand that there is a proce-
dure in place for questions, and we 
await them; thereafter, we will close 
on behalf of President Trump. 
Mr. President, we yield the balance 
of our time. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader.

RECESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that we take a 15- 
minute recess. 
There being no objection, at 3:16 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 3:54 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the President 
pro tempore. 
SENATORS’ QUESTIONS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will come to order. 
Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 
47, the Senate has provided 4 hours dur-
ing which Senators may submit ques-
tions 
in 
writing 
directed 
either 
through the managers on the part of 
the House of Representatives or coun-
sel for the former President. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the answers 
within the 4-hour question period be 
limited to 5 minutes each, and if the 
questions are directed to both parties, 
the times be equally divided; further-
more, that questions alternate sides 
proposing questions for as long as both 
sides have questions. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator will submit it. 
The question from Senator SCHUMER 
with Senator FEINSTEIN is directed to 
the House managers. 
The clerk will read it. 
The legislative clerk read the ques-
tion as follows: 
Isn’t it the case that the violent attack 
and siege on the Capitol on January 6 would 
not have happened if not for the conduct of 
President Trump? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers have up to 5 minutes. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. Good 
afternoon, everybody. To answer your 
question very directly, Donald Trump 
assembled the mob. He assembled the 
mob, and he lit the flame. Everything 
that followed was because of his doing, 
and although he could have imme-
diately and forcibly intervened to stop 
the violence, he never did. In other 
words, this violent, bloody insurrection 
that occurred on January 6 would not 
have occurred but for President Trump. 
The evidence we presented in trial 
makes this absolutely clear. This at-
tack, as we said, didn’t come from one 
random speech, and it didn’t happen by 
accident, and that mob didn’t come out 
of thin air. 
Before the election, Donald Trump 
spread lie after lie about potential 
fraud—an election, remember, that 
hadn’t even happened yet. Months be-
fore the election took place, he was 
saying it was rigged and that it was 
going to be stolen. All of his supporters 
believed that the only way he was 
going to lose is if the election was sto-
len, if the election was rigged. 
And when he did lose, he spent week 
after week inciting his supporters to 
believe that their votes had been stolen 
and that the election was fraudulent 
and it was their patriotic duty to fight 
like hell to stop the steal and take 
their country back. 
And, remember, this is in the United 
States, where our vote is our voice. 
You tell somebody that an election vic-
tory is being stolen from them, that is 
a combustible situation. 
And he gave them clear direction on 
how to deal with that. 
For example, on December 19, 18 days 
prior to January 6, President Trump 
told them how and where to fight for 
it. He first issued his call to action for 
January 6. This was a ‘‘save the date’’ 
sent 18 days before the event on Janu-
ary 6, and it wasn’t just a casual one- 
off reference or a singular invitation. 
For the next 18 days, he directed all 
of the rage he had incited to January 6; 
and that was, for him, what he saw as 
his last chance to stop the transfer of 
power, to stop from losing the Presi-
dency. And he said things like, ‘‘Fight 
to the death’’ and January 6 will be a 
‘‘wild’’ and ‘‘historic day.’’ And this 
was working. They got the message. 
In the days leading to the attack, re-
port after report, social media post 
after social media post, confirmed that 
these insurgents were planning armed 
violence, but they were planning it be-
cause he had been priming them, be-
cause he had been amping them up. 
That is why they were planning it. 
And these posts, confirmed by re-
ports from the FBI and Capitol Police, 
made clear that these insurgents were 
planning to carry weapons, including 
guns, to target the Capitol itself. And 
yet Donald Trump, from January 5 to 
the morning of his speech, tweeted 34 
times, urging his supporters to get 
ready to stop the steal. 
He even, on the eve of the attack, 
warned us that it was coming. He 
warned us that thousands were de-
scending into DC and would not take it 
anymore. 
When they got here at the Save 
America March, he told them again in 
that speech exactly what to do. His 
lawyer opened with: 
Let’s have trial by combat. 
That was Rudy Giuliani. And Donald 
Trump brought that message home. In 
fact, he praised Rudy Giuliani as a 
fighter, and President Trump used the 
words ‘‘fight’’ or ‘‘fighting’’ 20 times in 
that speech. 
Remember, you have just told these 
people—these thousands of people— 
that somebody has stolen your elec-
tion, your victory; you are not going to 
get the President that you love. 
Senators, that is an incredibly com-
bustible situation when people are 
armed and they have been saying that 
they are mad as hell and they are not 
going to take it anymore. 
He looked out to a sea of thousands, 
some wearing body armor, helmets, 
holding sticks and flag poles, some of 
which they would later use to beat 
Capitol Police; and he told them that 
they could play by different rules—play 
by different rules. He even, at one 
point, quite literally, pointed to the 
Capitol as he told them to ‘‘fight like 
hell.’’ 
After the attack, you know, we have 
shown clearly, well, that once the at-
tack began, insurgent after insurgent 
made clear they were following the 
President’s orders. You saw us present 
that evidence of the insurgents who 
were there that day who said: I came 
because the President asked me to 
come. I was here at his invitation. You 
saw that of the folks that were in the 
Capitol that day. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
time has expired. 
Are there further questions? 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does 
the Senator from South Carolina have 
a question? 
Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you very much, 
Mr. President. 
I send a question to the desk on be-
half myself, Senators CRUZ, MARSHALL, 
and CRAMER to counsel. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sen-
ator GRAHAM, for himself, Senator 
CRUZ, Senator MARSHALL, and Senator 
CRAMER, submits a question to the 
counsel for Donald Trump. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Does a politician raising bail for rioters en-
courage more rioting? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel has 5 minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S683 
February 12, 2021 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Yes. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does 
counsel yield back the rest of their 
time? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. I do. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel’s time is yielded back. 
Are there other questions? 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. I send a question to 
the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Send 
it to the desk. 
The Senator from Georgia, Senator 
WARNOCK, has a question for the House 
Managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Is it true or false that in the months lead-
ing up to January 6th, dozens of courts, in-
cluding State and Federal courts in Georgia, 
rejected President Trump’s campaign’s ef-
forts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House manager is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Senators, that is true. That is true. 
I want to be clear, though, that we 
have absolutely no problem with Presi-
dent Trump having pursued his belief 
that the election was being stolen or 
that there was fraud or corruption or 
unconstitutionality. We have no prob-
lem at all with him going to court to 
do it and he did and he lost in 61 
straight cases. In Federal court and 
State court, in the lowest courts in the 
land, in the U.S. Supreme Court, he 
lost it. 
He lost in courts in Pennsylvania, 
Arizona, 
Georgia, 
Michigan, 
Min-
nesota, Nevada, and Wisconsin. All of 
them 
said 
the 
same 
thing; 
they 
couldn’t find any corruption; they 
couldn’t find any fraud, certainly noth-
ing rising to a material level that 
would alter the outcome of any of the 
elections; and there was no unconsti-
tutionality. That is the American sys-
tem. 
So, I mean, it is hard to imagine him 
having gotten more due process than 
that in pursuing what has come to be 
known popularly as the big lie, the idea 
that somehow the election was being 
stolen from him. We have no problem 
with the fact that he went to court to 
do all those things. 
But notice, No. 1, the big lie was re-
futed, devastated, and demolished in 
Federal and State courts across the 
land, including by eight judges ap-
pointed by President Donald Trump 
himself. 
We quoted earlier in the case what 
happened in Pennsylvania, where U.S. 
District Court Judge Matthew Brann 
said: In the United States, this can— 
that 
This 
Court 
has 
been 
presented 
with 
strained legal arguments without merit and 
speculative accusations . . . 
In the [United States of America], this 
cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a 
single voter, let alone all the voters of its 
sixth most populated state. Our people, laws, 
and institutions demand more. 
Then it went up to Judge Stephanos 
Bibas, who is a Trump appointee, who 
is part of the appeals court panel. He 
said: 
The Campaign’s claims have no merit. The 
number of ballots it specifically challenges 
is far smaller than the [roughly] 81,000-vote 
margin of victory. And it never claims fraud 
or that any votes were cast by illegal voters. 
Plus, tossing out millions of mail-in ballots 
would 
be 
drastic 
and 
unprecedented, 
disenfranchising a huge swath of the elec-
torate and upsetting all down-ballot races 
too. 
Which, incidentally, they weren’t 
being challenged, even though it was 
the exact same ballot that had been 
brought. 
So the problem was when the Presi-
dent went from his traditional combat, 
which was fine, to intimidating and 
bullying State election officials and 
State legislators, and then finally, as 
Representative 
CHENEY
said, 
sum-
moning a mob, assembling a mob, and 
then lighting the match for an insur-
rection against the Union. 
When he crossed over from non-
violent means, no matter how ridicu-
lous or absurd—that is fine. He is exer-
cising his rights—to inciting violence, 
that is what this trial is about. 
We heard very little of that from the 
presentation of the President’s law-
yers. They really didn’t address the 
facts of the case at all. There were a 
couple 
of 
propaganda 
reels 
about 
Democratic politicians that would be 
excluded in any court in the land. They 
talked about the Rules of Evidence. All 
of that was totally irrelevant to the 
case before us. Whatever you think 
about it, it is irrelevant, and we will be 
happy, of course, to address the First 
Amendment argument too. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is from Senator COLLINS and 
Senator MURKOWSKI. It is for the coun-
sel for the former President. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Exactly when did President Trump learn of 
the breach of the Capitol, and what specific 
actions did he take to bring the rioting to an 
end, and when did he take them? Please be as 
detailed as possible. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Is it 
possible to read the question again? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will read the question again. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Exactly when did President Trump learn of 
the breach of the Capitol, and what specific 
actions did he take to bring the rioting to an 
end, and when did he take them? Please be as 
detailed as possible. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
van der Veen. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. The 
House Managers have given us abso-
lutely no evidence, one way or the 
other, on that question. 
We are able to piece together a 
timeline, and it goes all the way back 
to December 31; January 2, there is a 
lot of interaction between the authori-
ties and getting folks to have security 
beforehand on the day. We have a tweet 
at 2:38, so it was certainly sometime 
before then. 
With the rush to bring this impeach-
ment, there has been absolutely no in-
vestigation into that. And that is the 
problem with this entire proceeding. 
The House Managers did zero inves-
tigation, and the American people de-
serve a lot better than coming in here 
with no evidence, hearsay on top of 
hearsay on top of reports that are hear-
say. 
Due process is required here, and 
that was denied. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada, Senator ROSEN, 
submits a question for the House man-
agers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
On January 6, the anti-Semitic Proud Boys 
group that President Trump had told to 
stand by, laid siege to the Capitol alongside 
other rioters, including one wearing a ‘‘Camp 
Auschwitz’’ shirt. Is there evidence that 
President Trump knew or should have known 
that his tolerance of anti-Semitic hate 
speech, combined with his own rhetoric, 
could incite the kind of violence we saw on 
January 6? 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Mr. Presi-
dent, Senators, Donald Trump has a 
long history of praising and encour-
aging violence, as you saw. He has es-
poused hateful rhetoric himself. He has 
not just tolerated it, but he has en-
couraged hateful speech by others. He 
has refused, as you saw in the Sep-
tember debate—that interview—to con-
demn extremists and White suprema-
cist groups, like the Proud Boys, and 
he has, at every opportunity, encour-
aged and cultivated actual violence by 
these groups. 
Yes, he has encouraged actual vio-
lence, not just the word ‘‘fight.’’ He 
told groups like the Proud Boys, who 
had beaten people with baseball bats, 
to stand by. 
When his supporters in the 50-car 
caravan tried to drive a bus of Biden 
campaign workers off the road, he 
tweeted a video of that incident with 
fight music attached to it and wrote: 
‘‘I LOVE TEXAS!’’ 
When 
his 
supporters 
sent 
death 
threats to the Republican Secretary of 
State Raffensperger in Georgia, he re-
sponded by calling Mr. Raffensperger 
an enemy of the state, after he knew of 
those death threats. 
And in the morning of the second 
Million MAGA March, when it erupted 
in violence and burned churches, he 
began that day with the tweet: ‘‘We 
have just begun to fight.’’ 
I want to be clear that Donald Trump 
is not on trial for those prior state-
ments—however as hateful and violent 
and inappropriate as they may be. But

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S684 
February 12, 2021 
his statements, the President’s state-
ments make absolutely clear three im-
portant points for our case. 
First, President Trump had a pattern 
and practice of praising and encour-
aging violence, never condemning it. It 
is not a coincidence that those very 
same people—Proud Boys, organizers of 
the Trump caravan, supporters and 
speakers of the second Million MAGA 
March—all showed up on January 6 to 
an event that he had organized with 
those same individuals who had orga-
nized that violent attack. 
Second, his behavior is different. It is 
not just that it was a comment by an 
official to fight for a cause. This is 
months of cultivating a base of people 
who were violent—not potentially vio-
lent but were violent—and that their 
prior conduct both helped him cul-
tivate the very group of people that at-
tacked us; it also shows clearly that he 
had that group assembled, inflamed, 
and, in all the public reports, ready to 
attack. He deliberately encouraged 
them to engage in violence on January 
6. 
President Trump had spent months 
calling supporters to a march on a spe-
cific day, at a specific time, for a spe-
cific purpose. What else were they 
going to do to stop the certification of 
the election on that day but to stop 
you—but to stop you physically? There 
was no other way, particularly after 
his Vice President said that he would 
refuse to do what the President asked. 
The point is this: that by the time he 
called the cavalry—not calvary but 
cavalry—of his thousands of supporters 
on January 6, an event he had invited 
them to, he had every reason to know 
that they were armed, violent, and 
ready to actually fight. 
He knew who he was calling and the 
violence they were capable of, and he 
still gave his marching orders to go to 
the Capitol and ‘‘fight like hell’’ to 
stop the steal. How else was that going 
to happen? If they had stayed at the 
Ellipse, maybe it would have just been 
to violently—to fight in protest with 
their words. But to come to the Cap-
itol? 
That is why this is different, and that 
is why he must be convicted and ac-
quitted—and disqualified. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, on be-
half of Senator SCOTT of South Caro-
lina and myself, I would like to submit 
a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Tennessee submits a 
question. 
The question is for counsel for the 
former 
President 
from 
Senators 
HAGERTY and SCOTT of South Carolina. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Given that more than 200 people have been 
charged for their conduct at the Capitol on 
January 6, that our justice system is work-
ing to hold the appropriate persons account-
able, and that President Trump is no longer 
in office, isn’t this simply a political show 
trial that is designed to discredit President 
Trump and his policies and shame the 74 mil-
lion Americans who voted for him? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel is recognized. 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Thank you, 
Senators, for that question. That is 
precisely what the 45th President be-
lieves this gathering is about. 
We believe in law and order and trust 
that the Federal authorities that are 
conducting investigations and prosecu-
tions against the criminals that in-
vaded this building will continue their 
work and be as aggressive and thor-
ough as we know them to always be 
and that they will continue to identify 
those that entered the inner sanctum 
of our government and desecrated it. 
The 45th President no longer holds 
office, and there is no sanction avail-
able under the Constitution, in our 
view, for him to be removed from the 
office that he no longer holds. The only 
logical conclusion is that the purpose 
of this gathering is to embarrass the 
45th President of the United States and 
in some way try to create an oppor-
tunity for Senators to suggest that he 
should not be permitted to hold office 
in the future or, at the very least, pub-
licize this throughout the land to try 
to damage his ability to run for office 
when and if he is acquitted and, at the 
same time, tell the 74 million people 
who voted for him that their choice 
was the wrong choice. 
I believe that this is a divisive way of 
going about handling impeachment, 
and it denigrates the great solemnity 
that should attach to such proceedings. 
I yield the remainder of my time, Mr. 
President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I send a 
question for the House managers to the 
desk because the President’s counsel 
did not answer the question which was 
posed to them. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator will send the question. Debate 
is not allowed. 
The question is from Senator MAR-
KEY, with Senator DUCKWORTH, to the 
managers on the part of the House of 
Representatives. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Exactly when did the President 
learn of the breach at the Capitol, and what 
steps did he take to address the violence? 
Please be as detailed as possible. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Do 
the House managers wish to respond? 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Yes. Mr. 
President, Senators, this attack was on 
live TV, on all major networks, in 
realtime. The President, as President, 
has access to intelligence information, 
including reports from inside the Cap-
itol. 
He knew the violence that was under-
way. He knew the severity of the 
threats. And, most importantly, he 
knew that Capitol Police were over-
whelmingly outnumbered and in a fight 
for their lives against thousands of in-
surgents with weapons. We know he 
knew that. We know that he did not 
send any individuals. We did not hear 
any tweets. We did not hear him tell 
those individuals: Stop. This is wrong. 
You must go back. We did not hear 
that. 
So what else did the President do? 
We are unclear. But we believe it was a 
dereliction of his duty, and that was 
because he was the one who had caused 
them to come to the Capitol, and they 
were doing what he asked them to do. 
So there was no need for him to stop 
them from what they were engaged in. 
But one of the things I would like to 
ask is we still have not heard and pose 
to you all the questions that were 
raised by Mr. RASKIN, Manager RASKIN, 
in his closing argument: Why did Presi-
dent Trump not tell the protesters to 
stop as soon as he learned about it? 
Why did President Trump do nothing 
to stop the attack for 2 hours after the 
attack 
began? 
Why 
did 
President 
Trump do nothing to help protect the 
Capitol and law enforcement battling 
the insurgents? 
You saw the body cam of a Capitol 
Police officer at 4:29, still fighting—4:29 
after since what time?—1, 2 in the 
afternoon. Why did he not condemn the 
violent insurrection on January 6? 
Those are the questions that we 
have, as well, and the reason this ques-
tion keeps coming up is because the an-
swer is nothing. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Any 
further questions? 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. I send a question to 
the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Utah, Mr. ROMNEY, on be-
half of himself and Senator COLLINS, 
submits a question. 
The clerk will read the question. 
Oh, I apologize. The question is for 
both sides, and the time will be evenly 
divided. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
When President Trump sent the dispar-
aging tweet at 2:24 p.m. regarding Vice Presi-
dent Pence, was he aware that the Vice 
President had been removed from the Senate 
by the Secret Service for his safety? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers. And time will be 
evenly divided. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. I’m sorry. 
Could the question be read again, Mr. 
President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of 
course. 
Could the clerk read the question 
again. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
When President Trump sent the dispar-
aging tweet at 2:24 p.m. regarding Vice Presi-
dent Pence, was he aware that the Vice 
President had been removed from the Senate 
by the Secret Service for his safety? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers are recognized for 21⁄2 
minutes. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. 
Thank you. Well, let me tell you what 
he said at 2:24 p.m. He said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S685 
February 12, 2021 
Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do 
what should have been done to protect our 
Country and our Constitution . . . USA de-
mands the truth! 
And you know by now what was all 
over the media. You couldn’t turn on 
the television, you couldn’t turn on the 
radio, you couldn’t consume any media 
or probably take any phone calls or 
anything else without hearing about 
this and also hearing about the Vice 
President. 
And here is what Donald Trump had 
to know at that time because the 
whole world knew it. All of us knew it. 
Live television had, by this point, 
shown that the insurgents were already 
inside the building and that they had 
weapons and that the police were out-
numbered. 
And here are the facts that are not in 
dispute. Donald Trump had not taken 
any measures to send help to the over-
whelmed Capitol Police. 
As President, at that point, when you 
see all this going on and the people all 
around you are imploring you to do 
something and your Vice President is 
there, why wouldn’t you do it? Donald 
Trump had not publicly condemned the 
attack, the attackers, or told them to 
stand down despite multiple pleas to do 
so, and Donald Trump hadn’t even ac-
knowledged the attack. 
And, after Wednesday’s trial portion 
concluded, Senator TUBERVILLE spoke 
to reporters and confirmed the call 
that he had with the President and did 
not dispute Manager CICILLINE’s de-
scription in any way that there was a 
call between he and the President 
around the time that Mike Pence was 
being ushered out of the Chamber, and 
that was shortly after 2 p.m. 
And Senator TUBERVILLE specifically 
said that he told the President: Mr. 
President, they just took the Vice 
President out; I have got to go. 
That was shortly after 2 p.m. There 
were still hours of chaos and carnage 
and mayhem, and the Vice President 
and his family were still in danger at 
that point. Our Commander in Chief 
did nothing. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel for the former President. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. The 
answer is no. At no point was the 
President informed the Vice President 
was in any danger. Because the House 
rushed through this impeachment in 7 
days with no evidence, there is nothing 
at all in the record on this point be-
cause the House failed to do even a 
minimum amount of due diligence. 
What the President did know is that 
there was a violent—there was a vio-
lent riot happening at the Capitol. 
That is why he repeatedly called via 
tweet and via video for the riots to 
stop, to be peaceful, to respect Capitol 
Police and law enforcement, and to 
commit no violence and to go home. 
But to be clear, this is an Article of 
Impeachment for incitement; this is 
not an Article of Impeachment for any-
thing else. It is one count. They could 
have charged anything they wanted. 
They chose to charge incitement. So 
that the question—although answered 
directly no, it is not really relevant to 
the charges for the impeachment in 
this case. 
And I just wanted to clear up one 
more thing. Mr. CASTRO, in his first an-
swer, may have misspoke, but what he 
said was Mr. Trump had said ‘‘fight to 
the death.’’ That is false. I am hoping 
he misspoke. 
Thank you. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, on 
behalf of myself and Senators CASEY 
and BROWN, I send a question to the 
desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. This 
is a question from Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
Senator CASEY, and Senator BROWN to 
the House managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
In presenting your case, you relied on past 
precedents from impeachment trials, such as 
William Belknap’s impeachment. After what 
you have presented in the course of this 
trial, if we do not convict former President 
Trump, what message will we be sending to 
future Presidents and Congresses? 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. As we have 
shown, President Trump engaged in a 
course of conduct that incited an 
armed attack on the Capitol. He did so 
while seeking to overturn the results of 
the election and thwart the transfer of 
power. And when the attack began, he 
further incited violence aimed to his 
own 
Vice 
President, 
even 
dem-
onstrating his state of mind by failing 
to defend us and the law enforcement 
officials who protect us. 
The consequences of his conduct were 
devastating on every level. Police offi-
cers were left overwhelmed, unpro-
tected. Congress had to be evacuated; 
our staff barricaded in this building, 
calling their families to say goodbye. 
Some of us, like Mr. RASKIN, had chil-
dren here. 
And these people in this building, 
some of whom were on the FBI’s watch 
list, took photos, stole laptops, de-
stroyed precious statues, including one 
of John Lewis, desecrated the statue of 
a recently deceased Member of Con-
gress who stood for nonviolence. 
This was devastating. And the world 
watched us, and the world is still 
watching us to see what we will do this 
day and will know what we did this day 
100 years from now. 
Those 
are 
the 
immediate 
con-
sequences, and our actions will rever-
berate as to what are the future con-
sequences. The extremists who at-
tacked the Capitol at the President’s 
provocation will be emboldened. All 
our intelligence agencies have con-
firmed this; it is not House managers 
saying that. They are quite literally 
standing by and standing ready. Don-
ald Trump told them: This is only the 
beginning. 
They 
are 
waiting 
and 
watching to see if Donald Trump is 
right that everyone said this was to-
tally appropriate. 
Let me also bring something else up. 
I will briefly say that defense counsel 
put a lot of videos out in their defense, 
playing clip after clip of Black women 
talking about fighting for a cause or an 
issue or a policy. It was not lost on me, 
as so many of them were people of 
color and women and Black women, 
Black women like myself, who are sick 
and tired of being sick and tired for our 
children—your children, our children. 
This summer, things happened that 
were violent, but there were also 
things that gave some of us Black 
women great comfort: seeing Amish 
people from Pennsylvania standing up 
with us, Members of Congress fighting 
up with us. And so I thought we were 
past that. I think maybe we are not. 
There are longstanding consequences, 
decisions like this that will define who 
we are as a people, who America is. We 
have in this room made monumental 
decisions. You all have made monu-
mental decisions. We have declared 
wars, passed civil rights acts, ensured 
that no one in this country is a slave. 
Every American has the right to vote, 
unless you live in a territory. At this 
time, some of these decisions are even 
controversial, but history has shown 
that they define us as a country and as 
a people. Today is one of those mo-
ments, and history will wait for our de-
cision. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. I send a question to the 
desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Utah, Mr. LEE, sends a 
question on behalf of himself, Senator 
HAWLEY, 
Senator 
CRAPO, 
Senator 
BLACKBURN, and Senator PORTMAN, and 
the question is for the counsel for the 
former President. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Multiple State constitutions enacted prior 
to 1787—namely, the constitutions of Dela-
ware, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Vermont— 
specifically provided for the impeachment of 
a former officer. Given that the Framers of 
the U.S. Constitution would have been aware 
of these provisions, does their decision to 
omit language specifically authorizing the 
impeachment of former officials indicate 
that they did not intend for our Constitution 
to allow for the impeachment of former offi-
cials? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Good 
question, and the answer is yes, of 
course they left it out. The Framers 
were very smart men, and they went 
over draft after draft after draft on 
that document, and they reviewed all 
the other drafts of all of the State con-
stitutions, all of them. They picked 
and chose what they wanted, and they 
discarded what they did not. What they 
discarded was the option for all of you 
to impeach a former elected official. 
I hope that is answering your ques-
tion. Thank you. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S686 
February 12, 2021 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from California submits a 
question for the House managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Having been on the frontlines of combat-
ting the ‘‘big lie’’ over the past 4 years as 
California’s chief elections officer, it is clear 
that President Trump’s plot to undermine 
the 2020 election was built on lies and con-
spiracy theories. How did this plot to uncon-
stitutionally keep President Trump in power 
lead to the radicalization of so many of 
President Trump’s followers and the result-
ing attack on the Capitol? 
Mr. 
Manager 
CASTRO. 
Senators, 
Donald Trump spent months inciting 
his base to believe that their election 
was stolen, and that was the point— 
that was the thing that would get peo-
ple so angry. Think about that, what it 
would take to get a large group of 
thousands of Americans so angry to 
storm the Capitol. That was the pur-
pose behind Donald Trump saying that 
the election had been rigged and that 
the election had been stolen. 
To be clear, when he says the elec-
tion is stolen, what he is saying is that 
the victory—and he even says one 
time, the election victory—has been 
stolen from them. Think about how 
significant 
that 
is 
to 
Americans. 
Again, you are right, over 70 million— 
I think 74 million people voted for Don-
ald Trump. And this wasn’t a one-off 
comment. It wasn’t one time. It was 
over and over and over and over and 
over again, with a purpose. 
We are not having this impeachment 
trial here because Donald Trump con-
tested the election. As I said during the 
presentation, nobody here wants to 
lose an election. We all run our races 
to win our elections. But what Presi-
dent Trump did was different. What our 
Commander in Chief did was the polar 
opposite of what we are supposed to do. 
We let the people decide the elections, 
except President Trump. He directed 
all of that rage that he had incited to 
January 6, the last chance—again, to 
him, this was his last chance. This was 
certifying the election results. He 
needed to whip up that mob, amp them 
up enough to get out there and try to 
stop the election results, the certifi-
cation of the election. And, you all, 
they took over the Senate Chamber to 
do that. They almost took over the 
House Chamber. There were 50 or so or 
more House Members who were lit-
erally scared for their lives up in the 
Gallery. 
A woman who bought into that big 
lie died because she believed the Presi-
dent’s big lie. This resulted in a loss of 
one of his supporter’s lives. A Capitol 
Police officer died that day—other of 
President Trump’s supporters. Two 
Capitol Police officers ended up taking 
their own lives. 
Defense counsel—their defense is ba-
sically everything President Trump did 
is OK, and he could do it again. Is that 
what we believe; that there is no prob-
lem with that, that it is perfectly fine 
if he does the same thing all over 
again? 
This is dangerous. He is inciting his 
base. He was using the claim of a 
rigged election. We have never seen 
somebody do that over and over and 
over again—tell a lie, say 6 months 
ahead of time that it is a rigged elec-
tion. 
There is a dangerous consequence to 
that when you have millions of fol-
lowers on Twitter and millions of fol-
lowers on Facebook and you have that 
huge bully pulpit of the White House 
and you are the President of the United 
States. There is a cost to doing that. 
People are listening to you in a way 
that, quite honestly, they are not lis-
tening to me and they are not listening 
to all of us in this room. 
I just want to clear up—the defense 
counsel made a point about something 
that I read earlier. The defense counsel 
suggested I misspoke. I just want to 
clarify for the record that the tweet I 
referenced—let me read you the tweet 
directly: 
If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had 
an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of 
such acts at a level never seen before, the 
Democrat Senators would consider it an act 
of war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the 
Republicans do NOTHING, just want to let it 
pass. NO FIGHT! 
So Donald Trump was equating what 
Democrats would do if their election 
was stolen. He said they’d fight to the 
death. Why do you think he sent that 
tweet? Because he is trying to say: 
Hey, the other side would fight to the 
death; so you should fight to the death. 
I mean, do we read that any other 
way? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, on my 
behalf 
and 
the 
behalf 
of 
Senator 
CRAMER, I send a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sen-
ator HAWLEY, on behalf of himself and 
Senator CRAMER, sends a question for 
the counsel and House managers. And 
following our procedure, the first one 
to respond after it is read will be the 
counsel for the former President. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
If the Senate’s power to disqualify is not 
derivative of the power to remove a con-
victed President from office, could the Sen-
ate disqualify a sitting President but not re-
move him or her? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Would 
you read that question again, if you 
would please? 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
If the Senate’s power to disqualify is not 
derivative of the power to remove a con-
victed President from office, could the Sen-
ate disqualify a sitting President but not re-
move him or her? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel for the former President has 21⁄2 
minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. No. 
But I can’t let this rest. Mr. CASTRO at-
tributed a statement the time before 
last that he was up here that Donald 
Trump had told his people to fight to 
the death. I am not from here. I am not 
like you guys. I was being very polite 
in giving an opportunity to correct the 
record, and I thought that is exactly 
what he would do. 
But instead, what he did is he came 
up and illustrated the problem with the 
presentation of the House case. It has 
been smoke and mirrors, and, worse, it 
has been dishonest. He came up and 
tried to cover when he got caught, as 
they were caught earlier today with all 
of 
the 
evidence, 
checking 
tweets, 
switching dates—everything they did. 
And bear in mind, I had 2 days to 
look at their evidence. And when I say 
2 days, I mean they started putting in 
their evidence. So I started being able 
to get looking at it. That is not the 
way this should be done. 
But what we discovered was, he knew 
what he was doing. He knew that the 
President didn’t say that to his people. 
What he said was, if it happened to the 
Democrats, this is what they would do. 
In his speech that day, you know what 
he said? He said, if this happened to the 
Democrats, if the election were stolen 
from the Democrats, all hell would 
break loose. But he said to his sup-
porters: We are smarter. We are strong-
er. And we are not going to do what 
they did all summer long. 
So what he did was he misrepre-
sented a tweet to you to put forth the 
narrative that is wrong. It is wrong. It 
is dishonest, and the American people 
don’t deserve this any longer. You 
must acquit. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Representative from the House of Rep-
resentatives has 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
That was profoundly inaccurate and 
irrelevant to what the question is. So I 
am going to get back to the question. 
So under article II, section 4, a Presi-
dent who is in office must be convicted 
before removal and then must be re-
moved before disqualification. 
OK. But if the President is already 
out of office, then he can be separately 
disqualified, as this President is. But 
these powers have always been treated 
as separate issues, which is why I think 
there have been eight people who have 
been convicted and removed, and just 
three of them disqualified. 
And, as you know, there is a totally 
separate process within the Senate for 
doing this. The Constitution requires a 
two-thirds vote for conviction. But for 
disqualification, it is a majority vote. 
It is a separate thing. So people could 
vote to convict and then vote not to 
disqualify. If they felt that the evi-
dence demonstrated the President was 
guilty of incitement to insurrection, 
they could vote to convict. If they felt 
they didn’t want to exercise the fur-
ther power established by the Constitu-
tion to disqualify, they wouldn’t even 
have to do that. And that could be 
something that is taken up separately 
by the Senate and by a majority vote. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S687 
February 12, 2021 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The defense’s presentation highlighted the 
fact that Democratic Members of Congress 
raised objections to the counting of electoral 
votes in past joint sessions of Congress. To 
your knowledge, were any of those Demo-
cratic objections raised after insurrection-
ists stormed the Capitol in order to prevent 
the counting of electoral votes and after the 
President’s personal lawyer asked Senators 
to make these objections specifically to 
delay the certification? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you 
very much, Mr. President, for the op-
portunity to respond to that. 
The answer is no, we are not aware 
that any other objections were raised 
in the counting of electoral college 
votes, either by Democrats or Repub-
licans. This has been kind of a proud 
bipartisan tradition under the electoral 
college because the electoral college is 
so arcane and has so many rules to it. 
I think that my cocounsel on the 
other side had some fun because I was 
one of the people who took, I think, 
about 30 seconds in 2016 to point out 
that the electors from Florida were not 
actually conforming to the letter of 
the law because they have a rule in 
Florida that you can’t be a dual office-
holder. In other words, you can’t be a 
State legislator and also be an elector. 
That was improper form. 
I think then-Vice President Biden 
properly gaveled me down and said: 
Look, we are going to try to make the 
electoral college work, and we are 
going to vindicate the will of the peo-
ple. 
And that is pretty much what hap-
pened. 
Nobody has stormed the Capitol be-
fore or, as Representative CHENEY, the 
secretary of the Republican conference 
said, gone out and summoned a mob, 
assembled a mob, incited a mob, and lit 
a match. As Representative CHENEY 
said, all of this goes to the doorstep of 
the President. None of it would have 
happened without him and everything 
is due to his actions. This would not 
have happened. 
That is the chair of the House Repub-
lican conference, who was the target of 
an effort to remove her, which was re-
jected on a vote of by more than 2 to 1 
in the House Republican conference, 
when there was an attempt to remove 
her for voting for impeachment and be-
coming a leader for vindicating our 
constitutional values. 
So please don’t mix up what Repub-
licans and Democrats have done, I 
think, in every election for a long 
time, to say there are improprieties 
going on in terms of conforming with 
State election laws, with the idea of 
mobilizing a mob insurrection against 
the government that got 5 people 
killed, 140 Capitol officers wounded, 
and threatened the actual peaceful suc-
cession of power and transfer of power 
in America. 
If you want to talk about reforming 
the electoral college, we can talk about 
reforming the electoral college. You 
don’t do it by violence. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. My apologies to the 
Senator 
from 
Massachusetts 
for 
butting in. 
I send a question to the desk for the 
former President’s attorneys. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question from Senator CRAMER is for 
the counsel for the former President. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Given the allegations of the House man-
ager that President Trump has tolerated 
anti-Semitic rhetoric, has there been a more 
pro-Israel President than President Trump? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. No. 
But it is apparent that nobody listened 
to what I said earlier today, because 
the vitriolic speech needs to stop. You 
need to stop. 
There was nothing funny here, Mr. 
RASKIN. We aren’t having fun here. 
This is about the most miserable expe-
rience I have had down here in Wash-
ington, DC. There is nothing fun about 
it. 
And in Philadelphia, where I come 
from, when you get caught doctoring 
the evidence, your case is over, and 
that is what happened. They got 
caught doctoring the evidence, and this 
case should be over. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Vermont, Mr. SANDERS, 
has a question for both the counsel for 
the former President and the House 
managers. 
The clerk will read the question, and 
following our procedure, the House 
managers will go first. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House prosecutors have stated over 
and over again that President Trump was 
perpetrating a big lie when he repeatedly 
claimed that the election was stolen from 
him and that he actually won the election by 
a landslide. 
Are the prosecutors right when they claim 
that Trump was telling a big lie or, in your 
judgment, did Trump actually win the elec-
tion? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers have up to 21⁄2 min-
utes. 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. As we all 
know, President Trump did lose the 
election by 7 million votes, 306 elec-
toral votes. By the time of the January 
6 attack, the courts, the Justice De-
partment, all 50 States across the 
country had done—agreed that the 
votes were counted. The people had 
spoken, and it was time for the peace-
ful transfer of power as our Constitu-
tion and the rule of law demands. 
Sixty-one courts—61 courts—the Presi-
dent went to. That is fine, appropriate. 
He lost. He lost. He lost the election. 
He lost the court case. 
As Leader MCCONNELL recognized the 
day after the electors certified the 
votes on December 14, he said: 
Many millions of us had hoped that the 
Presidential election would yield a different 
result, but our system of government has 
processes to determine who will be sworn in 
on January 20. The electoral college has spo-
ken. 
Patriotism. Sometimes, there is a 
reason to dispute an election. Some-
times, the count is close. Sometimes, 
we ask for a recount, go to courts. All 
of that is appropriate. I lost my first 
election. I stayed in bed for 3 days. We 
do what we need to do, and we move 
on. This was not that because, when all 
of these people confirmed that Donald 
Trump had lost, when the courts, his— 
his—Department of Justice, State offi-
cials, Congress, his Vice President were 
ready to commit to the peaceful trans-
fer of power—the peaceful transfer of 
power—Donald Trump was not ready, 
and we are all here because he was not 
ready. 
Day after day, he told his supporters 
false, outlandish claims of why this 
election was rigged. Now, let’s be clear: 
President Trump had absolutely no 
support of these claims, but that 
wasn’t the point of what he was doing. 
He did it to make his supporters frus-
trated, to make them angry. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time 
has expired. 
Counsel for the former President is 
recognized for 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Thank 
you. 
May I have the question read again 
and not have it count against my time? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of 
course. 
The clerk will read the question 
again. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House prosecutors have stated over 
and over again that President Trump was 
perpetrating a big lie when he repeatedly 
claimed that the election was stolen from 
him and that he actually won the election by 
a landslide. 
Are the prosecutors right when they claim 
that Trump was telling a big lie or, in your 
judgment, did Trump actually win the elec-
tion? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel for the former President has 21⁄2 
minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Who 
asked that? 
Mr. SANDERS. I did. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. My 
judgment is irrelevant in this pro-
ceeding. It absolutely is. What is sup-
posed to happen here is the Article of 
Impeachment—— 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will be in order. 
Senators, under the rules, cannot 
challenge the content of the response. 
Counsel will continue. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. May I 
have the question read again, please? 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House prosecutors have stated over 
and over again that President Trump was 
perpetrating a big lie when he repeatedly 
claimed that the election was stolen from 
him and that he actually won the election by 
a landslide. 
Are the prosecutors right when they claim 
that Trump was telling a big lie or, in your 
judgment, did Trump actually win the elec-
tion?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S688 
February 12, 2021 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. In my 
judgment, it is irrelevant to the ques-
tion before this body. What is relevant 
in this Impeachment Article is, were 
Mr. Trump’s words inciteful to the 
point of violence and riot? That is the 
charge. That is the question; and the 
answer is, no, he did not have speech 
that was inciteful to violence or riot. 
Now, what is important to under-
stand here is the House managers have 
completely, from the beginning of this 
case to right now, done everything ex-
cept answer that question—the ques-
tion they brought before you, the ques-
tion they want my client to be pun-
ished by. That is the question that 
should be getting asked. 
The answer is, he advocated for 
peaceful, patriotic protest. Those are 
his words. The House managers have 
shown zero—zero—evidence that his 
words did anything else. Remember, all 
of the evidence is this was premedi-
tated; the attack on the Capitol was 
preplanned. It didn’t have anything to 
do with Mr. Trump in any way, what he 
said on that day on January 6 at that 
Ellipse, and that is the issue before 
this Senate. 
Now, on the issue of contesting elec-
tions and the results, the Democrats 
have a long, long history of just doing 
that. I hope everybody was able to see 
the video earlier today. Over and over 
again, it has been contested. When Mr. 
Trump was elected President, we were 
told that it was hijacked. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
former President’s counsel’s 21⁄2 min-
utes has expired. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk for both parties. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Wisconsin sends a ques-
tion for both counsel for the former 
President and the House managers. 
The clerk will read the question, and 
the counsel for the former President 
will have the first 21⁄2 minutes. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House managers assert that the Janu-
ary 6 attack was predictable, and it was fore-
seeable. If so, why did it appear that law en-
forcement at the Capitol were caught off 
guard and unable to prevent the breach? Why 
did the House Sergeant at Arms reportedly 
turn down a request to activate the National 
Guard, stating that he was not comfortable 
with the optics? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel for the former President is recog-
nized. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Would 
you read the question again, please? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will read the question again. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House managers assert that the Janu-
ary 6 attack was predictable, and it was fore-
seeable. If so, why did it appear that law en-
forcement at the Capitol were caught off 
guard and unable to prevent the breach? Why 
did the House Sergeant at Arms reportedly 
turn down a request to activate the National 
Guard, stating that he was not comfortable 
with the optics? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Holy 
cow. That is a really good question. 
Had the House managers done their 
investigation, maybe somebody would 
have an answer to that, but they 
didn’t. They did zero investigation. 
They did nothing. They looked into 
nothing. They read newspaper articles. 
They 
talked 
to 
their 
friends—you 
know, a TV reporter or something or 
something or another. 
But, Jiminy Cricket, there is no due 
process in this proceeding at all, and 
that question highlights the problem. 
When you have no due process, you 
have no clear-cut answers, but we do 
know that there was, I think, a certain 
level of foreseeability. It looks like, 
from the information they were pre-
senting, some law enforcement knew 
that something could be happening. 
In my presentation, we knew that the 
mayor, 2 days before—before—had been 
offered to have Federal troops or Na-
tional Guard deployed, beef up security 
here, and Capitol Police. It was offered. 
So somebody had to have an inkling of 
something. My question is, Who ig-
nored it and why? If an investigation 
were done, we would know the answer 
to that too. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers have 21⁄2 minutes. 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. First, if 
defense counsel has exculpatory evi-
dence, you are welcome to give it to us. 
We would love to see it. You have had 
an opportunity to give us evidence that 
would exculpate the President. Haven’t 
seen it yet. 
Everyone—the defense counsel wants 
to blame everyone else except the per-
son who was most responsible for what 
happened on January 6, and that is 
President Trump, Donald Trump. He is 
the person who foresaw this the most 
because he had the reports; he had ac-
cess to the information. He, as well, 
had—we all know how he is an avid 
cable news watcher. He knew what was 
going to happen. He cultivated these 
individuals. These are the undisputed 
facts. 
The National Guard was not deployed 
until over 2 hours after the attack. I 
heard reference to Mayor Bowser in the 
defense’s presentation. Mayor Bowser 
does not have authority over the Cap-
itol or Federal buildings. She could not 
deploy the National Guard to the Cap-
itol. That is outside of the jurisdiction 
of the Mayor of the District of Colum-
bia. 
At no point in that entire day did the 
President of the United States, our 
Commander in Chief, tell anyone—law 
enforcement struggling for their lives, 
insurgents who felt empowered by the 
sheer quantity of them, any of us in 
this building, or the American people— 
that he was sending help. 
He did not defend the Capitol. The 
President of the United States did not 
defend the Capitol of this country. It is 
indefensible. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sen-
ator MERKLEY submits a question for 
the House managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
If a President spins a big lie to anger 
Americans and stokes the fury by repeating 
the lie at event after event and invites vio-
lent groups to DC the day and hour nec-
essary to interrupt the electoral college 
count and does nothing to stop those groups 
from advancing on the Capitol and fails to 
summon the National Guard to protect the 
Capitol and then expresses pleasure and de-
light that the Capitol was under attack, is 
the President innocent of inciting an insur-
rection because in a speech he says ‘‘be 
peaceful’’? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers have 5 minutes. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. You 
all ask a very important question, 
which is, given everything that the 
President did leading up to the elec-
tion, after the election, and leading up 
to January 6, all of the incitement of 
his supporters, whom he convinced 
with a big lie over and over that the 
election had been stolen from them and 
from him, and then once the mob had 
stormed the Capitol, the Vice Presi-
dent was in danger, the Speaker was in 
danger, the Members of the House and 
the Senate and all the staff here—the 
janitorial staff, the cafeteria workers, 
everybody—and all of the hot rhetoric 
that he spoke with and then simply a 
few times said ‘‘stay peaceful’’—re-
member, he said ‘‘stay peaceful’’ when 
they had already gotten violent, when 
they had already brought weapons, 
when they had already hurt people. 
What he never said was: Stop the at-
tack. Leave the Capitol. Leave imme-
diately. 
Let me be clear. The President’s mes-
sage in that January 6 speech was in-
cendiary. So in the entire speech, 
which was roughly 1,100 words, he used 
the word ‘‘peaceful’’ once, and using 
the word ‘‘peaceful’’ was the only sug-
gestion 
of 
nonviolence. 
President 
Trump used the word ‘‘fight’’ or ‘‘fight-
ing’’ 20 times. 
Now, again, consider the context. He 
had been telling them a big lie over and 
over, getting them amped up, getting 
them angry because an election had 
been stolen from them. There are thou-
sands of people in front of him. Some of 
them are carrying weapons and arms. 
They are angry. He is telling them to 
fight. 
President Trump’s words in that 
speech, just like the mob’s actions, 
were carefully chosen. His words in-
cited their actions. Now, how do we 
know this? For months, the President 
had told his supporters his big lie that 
the election was rigged, and he used 
the lie to urge his supporters not to 
concede and to stop the steal. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. If you rob a 
bank and on the way out the door, you 
yell ‘‘respect private property,’’ that is 
not a defense to robbing the bank. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk directed at both 
sides.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S689 
February 12, 2021 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Texas has a question for 
both sides. 
The clerk will read the question, and 
the House managers will go first for 21⁄2 
minutes. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Out of their 16 hours, the House managers 
devoted all of 15 minutes to articulating a 
newly created legal standard for incitement: 
1, was violence foreseeable; 2, did he encour-
age violence; 3, did he do so willfully? Is this 
new standard derived from the Criminal 
Code or any Supreme Court case? 
While violent riots were raging, KAMALA 
HARRIS said on national TV: 
They’re not gonna let up—and they should 
not. 
And she also raised money to bail out vio-
lent rioters. 
Using the managers’ proposed standard, is 
there any coherent way for Donald Trump’s 
words to be incitement and KAMALA HARRIS’ 
words not to be incitement? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President and Senators. 
I am not familiar with the statement 
that is being referred to with respect to 
the Vice President, but I find it abso-
lutely unimaginable that Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS would ever incite violence 
or encourage or promote violence. Ob-
viously, it is completely irrelevant to 
the proceeding at hand, and I will allow 
her to defend herself. 
The President’s lawyers are pointing 
out that we have never had any situa-
tion like this before in the history of 
the United States, and it is true. There 
has never been a President who has en-
couraged a violent insurrection against 
our own government. So we really have 
nothing to compare it to. So what we 
do in this trial will establish a stand-
ard going forward for all time. 
Now, there are two theories that 
have been put before you, and I think 
we have got to get past all of the pica-
yune, little critiques that have been of-
fered today about this or that. Let’s 
focus on what is really at stake here. 
The President’s lawyers say, echoing 
the President, his conduct was totally 
appropriate; in other words, he would 
do it again. Exactly what he did is the 
new standard for what is allowable for 
him or any other President who gets 
into office. 
Our point is that his incitement so 
overwhelmed any possible legal stand-
ard we have that we have got the op-
portunity now to declare that Presi-
dential incitement to violent insurrec-
tion against the Capitol and the Con-
gress is completely forbidden to the 
President of the United States under 
the impeachment clauses. 
So we set forth for you the elements 
of encouragement of violence, and we 
saw it overwhelmingly. We know that 
he picked the date of that rally. In 
fact, there was another group that was 
going to have a rally at another date, 
and he got it moved to January 1. He 
synchronized exactly with the time 
that we would be in joint session, and 
as Representative CHENEY said: 
He summoned that mob, he assembled that 
mob, he incited that mob, he lit the match. 
Come on, get real. We know that this 
is what happened. 
The second thing is the foreseeability 
of it. Was it foreseeable? Remember 
Lansing, MI, and everything we showed 
you. They didn’t mention that, of 
course. Remember the MAGA 2 march, 
the MAGA 2 rally. They didn’t mention 
that. The violence all over the rally, 
the President cheering it on, delighting 
in it, reveling in it, exalting in it. 
Come on. How gullible do you think 
we are? We saw this happen. We just 
spent 11 or 12 hours looking at all that. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
managers’ time has expired. 
Counsel for the former President has 
21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Sen-
ator CRUZ, I believe the first part of 
your question refers to the newly cre-
ated Raskin doctrine on the First 
Amendment, and he just—his answer 
actually gave you a new one: appro-
priateness. 
The standard that this body needs to 
follow for law is Brandenburg v. Ohio, 
and the test really—the three-part test 
really comes out of Bible Believers v. 
Wayne County, to be specific. The 
speech has to be explicitly or implic-
itly encouraged, the use of ‘‘violence.’’ 
In other words, it has to be in the 
words itself, which is—clearly, it is not 
in the words itself. That is step one. 
They don’t get past it. 
Two, the speaker intends that his 
speech will result in use of violence or 
lawless action. There is no evidence of 
that, and it is ludicrous to believe that 
that would be true. 
Third, the imminent use of violence 
or lawless action is likely to result 
from speech. 
Also, they fail on all three points of 
the law as we know it and needs to be 
applied here. 
I don’t know why he said he never 
heard KAMALA HARRIS say about the 
riots and the people rioting and ruining 
our businesses and our streets that 
they are not going to let up and they 
should not because we played it three 
times today. We gave it to you in 
audio, I read it to you, and you got it 
in video. That is what she said. But it 
is protected speech. Her speech is pro-
tected also, Senator. That is the point. 
You all have protections as elected 
officials, the highest protections under 
the First Amendment, and that First 
Amendment applies here in this Cham-
ber to this proceeding. And that is 
what you need to keep focused on. You 
need to keep focused on what is the law 
and how do we apply it to this set of 
facts. It is your duty. You can’t get 
caught up in all of the rhetoric and the 
facts that are irrelevant. You need to 
keep focused on what is the issue be-
fore you decided based on the law— 
Brandenburg and Bible Believers—and 
apply it to the facts, and that requires 
you to look at the words, and there 
were no words of incitement of any 
kind. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
counsels’ time has expired. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator 
from 
Washington, 
Senator 
MURRAY, has a question for the House 
managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
At 6:01 p.m. eastern time on January 6, 
President Trump tweeted: 
These are the things that happen when a 
sacred 
landslide 
election 
victory 
is 
so 
unceremoniously 
and 
viscously 
stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly and unfairly treated for so long. 
Adding for rioters to ‘‘go home with love 
and in peace.’’ 
What is the relevance of this tweet to 
President Trump’s guilt? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers are recognized for up 
to 5 minutes. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. Sen-
ators, this was a key quote and a key 
statement by the President that day— 
that horrific day. 
Remember, the Capitol had been 
stormed. It had been attacked. People 
had yelled, ‘‘Hang Mike Pence.’’ People 
had gone after Speaker PELOSI. People 
brought baseball bats and other weap-
ons. Many Members of Congress in the 
Senate and the House were fearful for 
their own lives. 
The President didn’t call the Na-
tional Guard. His own administration 
didn’t list him as somebody who they 
had spoken with to activate the Guard. 
And he said: 
Remember this day forever. 
So if he was not guilty of inciting in-
surrection, if this is not what he want-
ed, if it wasn’t what he desired, by that 
time the carnage had been on tele-
vision for hours. He saw what was 
going on. Everybody saw what was 
going on. 
If it wasn’t what he wanted, why 
would he have said, ‘‘Remember this 
day forever’’? Why commemorate a day 
like that, an attack on the U.S. Cap-
itol, for God’s sake? Why would you do 
that, unless you agreed that it was 
something to praise, not condemn; 
something to hold up and commemo-
rate? 
No consoling the Nation, no reas-
suring that the Government was se-
cure, not a single word that entire day 
condemning 
the 
attack 
or 
the 
attackers or the violent insurrection 
against Congress. 
This tweet is important because it 
shows two key points about Donald 
Trump’s state of mind. First, this was 
entirely and completely foreseeable, 
and he foresaw it, and he helped incite 
it over many months. 
He’s saying: I told you this was going 
to happen if you certified the election 
for anyone else besides me, and you got 
what you deserve for trying to take it 
away from me. 
And we know this because that state-
ment was entirely consistent with ev-
erything he said leading up to the at-
tack.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S690 
February 12, 2021 
Second, 
this 
shows 
that 
Donald 
Trump intended and reveled in this. 
Senators, he reveled in this. He de-
lighted in it. This is what he wanted. 
‘‘Remember 
this 
day 
forever,’’ 
he 
said—not as a day of disgrace, as it is 
to all of us, but as a day of celebration 
and commemoration, and if we let it, if 
we don’t hold him accountable and set 
a strong precedent, possibly a continu-
ation later on. 
We will, of course, all of us, remem-
ber this day but not in the same way 
that Donald Trump suggested. We will 
remember the bravery of our Capitol 
and Metro police forces. We will re-
member the officer who lost his life 
and sadly the others who did as well, 
and the devastation that was done to 
this country because of Donald Trump. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Louisiana, Mr. CASSIDY, 
has a question for both counsel for the 
former President and counsel for the 
House. 
The clerk will read it, and counsel for 
the former President will go first, for 
21⁄2 minutes, and then the House of 
Representatives will have 21⁄2 minutes. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Senator TUBERVILLE reports that he spoke 
to President Trump at 2:15 p.m. He told the 
President that the Vice President had just 
evacuated. I presume it was understood at 
this time that rioters had entered the Cap-
itol and threatened the safety of Senators 
and the Vice President. Even after hearing of 
this, at 2:24 p.m. President Trump tweeted 
that Mike Pence ‘‘lacked courage,’’ and he 
did not call for law enforcement backup 
until then. 
This tweet and lack of response suggests 
President Trump did not care that Vice 
President Pence was endangered, or that law 
enforcement was overwhelmed. Does this 
show that President Trump was tolerant of 
the intimidation of Vice President Pence? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel has 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Di-
rectly, no. But I dispute the premise of 
your facts. I dispute the facts that are 
laid out in that question and, unfortu-
nately, we are not going to know the 
answer to the facts in this proceeding 
because the House did nothing to inves-
tigate what went on. 
We are trying to get hearsay from 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. There was hearsay 
from Mr. LEE—I think it was two 
nights ago—and we ended where Mr. 
LEE was accused of making a state-
ment that he never made. But it was a 
report from a reporter from a friend of 
somebody who had some hearsay that 
they heard the night before at a bar 
somewhere. I mean, that is really the 
kind of evidence that the House has 
brought before us. And so I have a 
problem with the facts in the question 
because I have no idea, and nobody 
from the House has given us any oppor-
tunity to have any idea. 
But Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have 
had a very good relationship for a long 
time, and I am sure Mr. Trump very 
much is concerned and was concerned 
for the safety and well-being of Mr. 
Pence and everybody else who was over 
here. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
manager on the part of the House of 
Representatives has 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
Counsel said before: This has been 
my worst experience in Washington. 
For that, I guess we are sorry, but, 
man, you should have been here on 
January 6. 
The counsel for the President keeps 
blaming the House for not having the 
evidence that is within the sole posses-
sion of their client, who we invited to 
come and testify last week. 
We sent a letter on February 4. I sent 
it directly to President Trump, invit-
ing him to come and to explain and fill 
in the gaps of what we know about 
what happened there. And they sent 
back a contemptuous response just a 
few hours later. I think they, maybe, 
even responded more quickly to my 
letter than President Trump did as 
Commander in Chief to the invasion 
and storming of the Capitol of the 
United States. 
But in that letter I said: You know, if 
you decline this invitation, we reserve 
all rights, including the right to estab-
lish at trial that your refusal to testify 
supports a strong adverse inference. 
What’s that? Well, Justice Scalia was 
the great champion of it. If you don’t 
testify in a criminal case, it can’t be 
used against you. Everybody knows 
that. That is the Fifth Amendment 
privilege against self-incrimination. 
But if it is a civil case and you plead 
the Fifth or you don’t show up, then, 
according to Justice Scalia and the 
rest of the Supreme Court, you can in-
terpret every disputed fact against the 
defendant. That is totally available to 
us. 
So, for example, if we say the Presi-
dent was missing in action for several 
hours and he was derelict in his duty 
and he deserted his duty as Commander 
in Chief, and we say that, as inciter-in- 
chief, he didn’t call this off and they 
say: Oh, no, he was really doing what-
ever he can. If you are puzzled about 
that, you can resolve that dispute— 
that factual dispute—against the de-
fendant who refuses to come to a civil 
proceeding. He will not spend one day 
in jail if you convict him. This is not a 
criminal proceeding. This is about pre-
serving the Republic, dear Senate. 
That is what this is about—setting 
standards of conduct for the President 
of the United States so this never hap-
pens to us again. 
So rather than yelling at us and 
screaming about how ‘‘we didn’t have 
time’’ to get all of the facts about what 
your client did, bring your client up 
here and have him testify under oath 
about why he was sending out tweets 
denouncing the Vice President of the 
United States while the Vice President 
was being hunted down by a mob that 
wanted to hang him and was chanting 
in this building: ‘‘Hang Mike Pence. 
Hang Mike Pence.’’ ‘‘Traitor. Traitor. 
Traitor.’’ 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
time for the answer is up. 
Next question? 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk directed to the 
House managers. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from West Virginia has a ques-
tion for the House managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Would the President be made aware of the 
FBI and intelligence information of a pos-
sible attack and would the President be re-
sponsible for not preparing to protect the 
Capitol and all elected officials of govern-
ment with National Guard and law enforce-
ment as he did when he appeared in front of 
the Saint John’s Episcopal Church? 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. It is the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
President 
to 
know. 
The President of the United States, 
our Commander in Chief, gets daily 
briefings on what is happening in the 
country that he has a duty to protect. 
Additionally, the President would have 
known, just like the rest of us know, 
all of the reports that were out there 
and publicly available. 
How many of you received calls say-
ing to be careful on January 6, to be 
careful that day? 
I’m 
not—I’m 
seeing 
reports. 
It 
doesn’t seem safe. How much more 
would the President of the United 
States? 
Donald Trump, as our Commander in 
Chief, absolutely had a duty and a 
sworn oath to preserve, protect, and 
defend us and to do the same for the of-
ficers under his command. And he was 
not just our Commander in Chief. He 
incited the attack. The insurgents were 
following his commands, as we saw 
when we read aloud his tweets attack-
ing the Vice President. 
And with regard to the Vice Presi-
dent, I’m sure they did have a good re-
lationship, but we all know what can 
happen to one who has a good relation-
ship with the President when you de-
cide to do something that he doesn’t 
like. I am sure some of you have expe-
rienced that when he turns against you 
after you don’t follow his command. 
You heard from my colleagues that, 
when planning this attack, the insur-
gents predicted that Donald Trump 
would command the National Guard to 
help them. Well, he didn’t do much bet-
ter. He may not have commanded the 
Guard to help them, but it took way, 
way too long for him to command the 
Guard to help us. 
This is all connected. We’re talking 
about free speech? This was a pattern 
and practice of months of activity. 
That was the incitement. That is the 
incitement—the activity he was en-
gaged in for months before January 6, 
not just the speech on January 6. All of

it, in its totality, is a dereliction of 
duty of the President of the United 
States against the people who elected 
him—all of the people of this country. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I send 
a question to the desk for the former 
President’s counsel. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Alaska, Senator SUL-
LIVAN, has a question for the House 
counsel. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. For 
the former President’s counsel. Sorry 
about that. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you, sir. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House manager said yesterday that 
due process is discretionary, meaning the 
House is not required to provide and, indeed, 
did not provide in this snap impeachment 
any constitutional protection to a defendant 
in the House impeachment proceedings. 
What are the implications for our constitu-
tional order of this new House precedent 
combined with the Senate’s power to dis-
qualify from public office a private citizen in 
an impeachment trial? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Coun-
sel has 5 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Mr. 
President, that is a complicated ques-
tion. Could I have that read again? 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House managers said yesterday that 
due process is ‘‘discretionary,’’ meaning the 
House is not required to provide, and indeed 
did not provide in this snap impeachment, 
any constitutional protections to a defend-
ant in House impeachment proceedings. 
What are the implications for our constitu-
tional order of this new House precedent 
combined with the Senate’s power to dis-
qualify from public office a private citizen in 
an impeachment trial? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Mr. 
President, well, first of all, due process 
is never discretionary. Good Lord, the 
Constitution requires that the accused 
have the right to due process because 
the power that a prosecutor has to take 
somebody’s liberty when they are pros-
ecuting them is the ultimate thing 
that we try to save. 
In this case, just now, in the last 2 
hours, we have had prosecutorial mis-
conduct. What they just tried to do was 
say that it is our burden to bring them 
evidence to prove their case, and it is 
not. It is not our burden to bring any 
evidence forward at all. 
What is the danger? Well, the danger 
is pretty obvious. If the majority party 
doesn’t like somebody in the minority 
party and they are afraid they may 
lose the election or if it is somebody in 
the majority party and there is a pri-
vate citizen who wants to run against 
somebody in the majority party, well, 
they can simply bring impeachment 
proceedings. And, of course, without 
due process, they are not going to be 
entitled to a lawyer. They are not 
going to be entitled to have notice of 
the charges against them. 
It puts us into a position where we 
are the kind of judicial system and 
governing body that we are all very, 
very afraid of. From what we left hun-
dreds of years ago, and when regimes 
all around this world that endanger 
us—that is how they act; that is how 
they conduct themselves: without giv-
ing the accused due process, taking 
their liberty, without giving them just 
a basic fundamental right, under the 
5th to the 14th applied to the States, 
due process. If you take away due proc-
ess in this country from the accused, if 
you take that away, there will be no 
justice and nobody, nobody will be safe. 
But it is patently unfair for the 
House managers to bring an impeach-
ment proceeding without any—again, 
without any investigation at all and 
then stand up here and say: One, they 
had a chance to bring us evidence; and, 
two, let’s, let’s, let’s see what we can 
do about flipping around somebody’s 
other constitutional rights to having a 
lawyer or to having a—to see the evi-
dence at all. It just gets brought in 
without anybody, as it was here, with-
out anybody having an opportunity to 
review it beforehand. They actually 
sent it to us on the 9th, the day after 
we started this. 
So it is a really big problem. The due 
process clause applies to this impeach-
ment hearing, and it has been severely 
and extremely violated. This process is 
so unconstitutional because it violates 
due process. I am not even going to get 
into the jurisdiction part. 
The due process part should be 
enough to give anybody who loves our 
Constitution and loves our country 
great pause to do anything but acquit 
Donald Trump. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Connecticut, Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, has a question for the 
House managers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Former President Trump and his attorneys 
have cited the Brandenburg v. Ohio case in 
support of their argument that the First 
Amendment protects Trump. Did the Bran-
denburg case prohibit holding public officials 
accountable, through the impeachment proc-
ess, for the incitement of violence? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President, Senators. 
So let’s start with the letter of more 
than 140 constitutional law professors, 
which I think they described as par-
tisan in nature. That is a slur on the 
law professors, and I hope that they 
would withdraw that. There are very 
conservative luminaries on that list, 
including the cofounder of the Fed-
eralist 
Society, 
Ronald 
Reagan’s 
former 
Solicitor 
General, 
Charles 
Fried; as well as prominent law profes-
sors across the intellectual, ideolog-
ical, and First Amendment spectrum. 
And they all called their First Amend-
ment arguments frivolous, which they 
are. 
Now, they have retreated to the posi-
tion of Brandenburg v. Ohio. They 
want their client to be treated like a 
guy at the mob, I think they said, a 
guy in the crowd who yells something 
out. Even on that standard, this group 
of law professors said there is a very 
strong argument that he is guilty even 
under the strict Brandenburg standard. 
Why? Because he incited imminent, 
lawless action and he intended to do it 
and he was likely to cause it. How did 
we know he was likely to cause it? He 
did cause it. They overran the Capitol, 
right? 
So even if you want to hold the 
President of the United States of 
America to that minimal standard and 
forget about his constitutional oath of 
office, as I said before, that would be a 
dereliction of legislative duty on our 
part if we said all we are going to do is 
treat the President of the United 
States like one of the people he sum-
moned to Washington to commit an in-
surrection against us. OK. 
The President swore to preserve, pro-
tect, and defend the Constitution of the 
United States. That is against all 
comers, domestic or foreign. That is 
what ours says, right? Did he do that? 
No. On the contrary. He is like the fire 
chief. He doesn’t just say: Go ahead 
and shout ‘‘fire’’ inside a theater. He 
summons the mob and sends the mob 
to go burn the theater down, and when 
people start madly calling him and 
ringing alarm bells, he watches it on 
TV. And he takes his sweet time for 
several hours and turns up the heat on 
the deputy fire chief, whom he is mad 
at because he is not making it possible 
for him to pursue his political objec-
tives. 
And then, when we say, ‘‘We don’t 
want you to be fire chief ever again,’’ 
he 
starts 
crying 
about 
the 
First 
Amendment. Brandenburg was a case 
about a bunch of Klansmen who assem-
bled in a field, and they weren’t near 
anybody such that they could actually 
do violent damage to people, but they 
said 
some 
pretty 
repulsive, 
racist 
things. But the Supreme Court said 
they weren’t inciting imminent lawless 
action because you couldn’t have a 
mob, for example, break out, the way 
that this mob broke out and took over 
the Capitol of the United States of 
America. 
And, by the way, don’t compare him 
to one of those Klansmen in the field 
asserting 
their 
First 
Amendment 
rights. Assume that he were the chief 
of police of the town who went down to 
that rally and started calling for, you 
know, a rally at the city hall and then 
nurturing that mob, cultivating that 
mob, pulling them in over a period of 
weeks and days, naming the date and 
the time and the place, riling them up 
beforehand, and then just say: Be my 
guest. Go and stop the steal. 
Come on. Back to Tom Paine. Use 
your common sense. Use your common

sense. That is the standard of proof we 
want. They are already treating their 
client like he is a criminal defendant. 
They are talking about beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. They think that we are 
making a criminal case here. 
My friends, the former President is 
not going to spend 1 hour or 1 minute 
in jail. This is about protecting our Re-
public and articulating and defining 
the standards of Presidential conduct, 
and if you want this to be a standard 
for totally appropriate Presidential 
conduct going forward, be my guest, 
but we are headed for a very different 
kind of country at that point. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Kansas, Mr. MARSHALL, 
has a question for the counsel for the 
former President. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House Managers’ single Article of Im-
peachment is centered on the accusation 
that President Trump singularly incited a 
crowd into a riot. Didn’t the House man-
agers’ contradict their own charge by out-
lining the premeditated nature and planning 
of this event and by also showing the crowd 
was gathered at the Capitol even before the 
speech started and barriers were pushed over 
some 20 minutes before the conclusion of 
President Trump’s speech? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Yes. 
The House managers contradicted their 
own charge by outlining the premedi-
tated nature and planning of this event 
and by also showing the crowd gath-
ered at the Capitol, even before the 
speech 
started, 
and 
barriers 
were 
pushed over some 20 minutes before the 
conclusion 
of 
President 
Trump’s 
speech. The answer is yes. 
And I want to take the rest of my 
time to go back to the last question be-
cause it was completely missed by the 
House managers. 
Brandenburg v. Ohio is an incitement 
case. It is not an elected official case. 
That is Wood and Bond. And the whole 
problem that the House managers have 
in understanding the First Amendment 
argument here is that elected officials 
are different than anybody else. He is 
talking about fire chiefs. Fire chiefs 
are not elected officials. Police officers 
aren’t elected officials. 
Elected officials have a different, a 
higher standard on the holdings that I 
gave you—the highest protections, I 
should say. It is not a higher standard. 
It is a higher protection to your speech 
because of the importance of political 
dialogue. Because of what you all say 
in your public debate about policy, 
about the things that affect all of our 
lives, that is really important stuff, 
and you should be free to talk about 
that in just about any way that you 
can. 
Brandenburg comes into play, from a 
constitutional 
analysis 
perspective, 
when you are talking about incite-
ment. Is the speech itself inciteful to 
riot or lawlessness—one of the two— 
and the answer here is no. 
In 
Brandenburg, 
through—again, 
Bible Believers require you to look at 
the words of the speech. You actually 
can’t go outside the words of the 
speech. You are not allowed to in the 
analysis. 
So all the time they are trying to 
spend on tweets going back to 2015 or 
everything they want to focus on that 
was said in the hours and the days 
afterward are not applicable or rel-
evant to the scholastic inquiry as to 
how the First Amendment is applied in 
this Chamber in this proceeding. So, 
again, we need to be focused on what is 
the law and then how do we apply it to 
this set of facts. 
So it is important to have that un-
derstanding that elected officials and 
fire chiefs are treated differently under 
First Amendment law, and that is to 
the benefit of you all, which is to the 
benefit of us all because we do want 
you to be able to speak freely without 
fear that the majority party is going to 
come in and impeach you or come in 
and prosecute you to try to take away 
your seat where you sit now. That is 
not what the Constitution says should 
be done. 
But, yes, they do. They do contradict 
themselves, of course. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Maryland, Senator VAN 
HOLLEN, has a question for the man-
agers. 
The clerk will read the question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Would you please respond to the answer 
that was just given by the former President’s 
counsel? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House manager will be recognized. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
thank you. 
I am not sure which question the 
Senator was referring to, but let me 
quickly just dispense with the coun-
sel’s invocation again of Bond v. Floyd. 
This is a case I know well, and I thank 
him raising it. 
Julian Bond was a friend of mine. He 
was a colleague of mine at American 
University. He was a great civil rights 
hero. In his case, he got elected to the 
Georgia State Legislature and was a 
member of SNCC, the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee, the 
great committee headed up by the 
great Bob Moses for a long time. He got 
elected to the Georgia Legislature, and 
they didn’t want to allow him to be 
sworn in. They wouldn’t allow him to 
take his oath of office because SNCC 
had taken a position against the Viet-
nam war. So the Supreme Court said 
that was a violation of his First 
Amendment rights not to allow him to 
be sworn in. 
That is the complete opposite of Don-
ald Trump. Not only was he sworn in 
on January 20, 2017, he was President 
for almost 4 years before he incited 
this violent insurrection against us, 
and he violated his oath of office. That 
is what this impeachment trial is 
about—his violation of his oath of of-
fice and his refusal to uphold the law 
and take care that the laws are faith-
fully executed. 
Please don’t desecrate the name of 
Julian Bond, a great American, by 
linking him with this terrible plot 
against America that just took place in 
the storming of the U.S. Capitol. 
I am going to turn it over to my col-
league Ms. PLASKETT. 
Ms. 
Manager 
PLASKETT. 
Thank 
you. 
Let’s just be clear. President Trump 
summoned the mob, assembled the 
mob, lit the flame. Everything that fol-
lowed was his doing. Although he could 
have immediately and forcefully inter-
vened to stop the violence, he didn’t. In 
other words, this attack would not 
have happened without him. 
This attack is not about one speech. 
Most of you men would not have your 
wives with one attempt of talking to 
her. 
(Laughter.) 
It took numerous tries. You had to 
build it up. That is what the President 
did as well. He put together the group 
that would do what he wanted, and 
that was to stop the certification of 
the election so that he could retain 
power to be President of the United 
States, in contravention of an Amer-
ican election. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is from the Senator from 
Florida, and it is to both sides. 
The clerk will read the question. The 
House managers will go first for the 
first 21⁄2 minutes. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Voting to convict the former President 
would create a new precedent that a former 
official can be convicted and disqualified by 
the Senate. Therefore, is it not true that 
under this new precedent, a future House, 
facing partisan pressure to ‘‘Lock her up,’’ 
could impeach a former Secretary of State 
and a future Senate be forced to put her on 
trial and potentially disqualify from any fu-
ture office? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers go first. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Senators, three quick points here. 
First of all, I don’t know how many 
times I can say it. The jurisdictional 
issue is over. It is gone. The Senate 
settled it. The Senate entertained ju-
risdiction exactly the way it has done 
since the very beginning of the Repub-
lic in the Blount case, in the Belknap 
case, and you will remember, both of 
them, former officials. 
In this case, we have a President who 
committed his crimes against the Re-
public while he was in office. He was 
impeached by the House of Representa-
tives while he was in office. So the hy-
pothetical suggested by the gentleman

from Florida has no bearing on this 
case because I don’t think you are 
talking about an official who was im-
peached while they were in office for 
conduct that they committed while 
they were in office. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
counsel for the former President has 
21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Thank 
you. 
Could I have the question read again 
to make sure I have it right and can 
answer it directly? 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Voting to convict the former President 
would create a new precedent that a former 
official can be convicted and disqualified by 
the Senate. Therefore, is it not true that 
under this new precedent, a future House, 
facing partisan pressure to ‘‘Lock her up,’’ 
could impeach a former Secretary of State 
and a future Senate be forced to put her on 
trial and potentially disqualify from any fu-
ture office? 
Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. If you 
see it their way, yes. If you do this the 
way they want it done, that could hap-
pen to, the example there, a former 
Secretary of State. But it could happen 
to a lot of people, and that is not the 
way this is supposed to work. Not only 
could it happen to a lot of people, it 
would become much more regular too. 
But I want to address that, and I 
want you to be clear on this. Mr. 
RASKIN can’t tell you on what grounds 
you acquit. If you believe—even though 
there was a vote that there is jurisdic-
tion, if you believe jurisdiction is un-
constitutional, you can still believe 
that. If you believe that the House did 
not give appropriate due process in 
this, that can be your reason to acquit. 
If you don’t think they met their bur-
den in proving incitement, that these 
words incited the violence, you can ac-
quit. Mr. RASKIN doesn’t get to give 
you under what grounds you can ac-
quit. So you have to look at what they 
have put on in its totality and come to 
your own understanding as to whether 
you think they have met their burden 
to impeach. 
But the original question is an abso-
lutely slippery slope that I don’t really 
think anybody here wants to send this 
country down. 
Thank you. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Colorado sends a ques-
tion to the desk. 
I would note just for the—as the hour 
tends to get late, I would note for all 
counsel, as Chief Justice Roberts noted 
on January 21, 2020, citing the trial of 
Charles Swayne in 1905, all parties in 
this Chamber must refrain from using 
language that is not conducive to civil 
discourse. 
The Senator from Colorado, Senator 
BENNET, has a question for the House 
managers, and the clerk will read the 
question. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Since the November election, the Georgia 
Secretary of State, the Vice President, and 
other public officials withstood enormous 
pressure to uphold the lawful election of 
President Biden and the rule of law. What 
would have happened if these officials had 
bowed to the force President Trump exerted 
or the mob that attacked the Capitol? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers have 5 minutes. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. I 
want to take a minute and remind ev-
erybody about the incredible pressure 
that Donald Trump was putting on 
election officials in different States in 
this country and the intimidation that 
he was issuing, and I want to remind 
everyone of the background of Donald 
Trump’s call to one secretary of state, 
the secretary of state from Georgia, 
Mr. Raffensperger. 
Donald Trump tried to overturn the 
election by any means necessary. He 
tried again and again to pressure and 
threaten election officials to overturn 
the 
election 
results. 
He 
pressured 
Michigan officials, calling them late at 
night and hosting them at the White 
House. 
He did the same thing with officials 
in Pennsylvania. He called into a local 
meeting of the Pennsylvania Legisla-
ture, and he also hosted them at the 
White House, where he pressured them. 
In Georgia, it was even worse. He 
sent tweet after tweet attacking the 
secretary 
of 
state 
until 
Mr. 
Raffensperger got death threats to him 
and his family. His wife got a text that 
said: 
Your husband deserves facing a firing 
squad. 
A firing squad for doing his job. 
Mr. Raffensperger stood up to him. 
He told the world that elections are the 
bedrock of this society and the votes 
were accurately counted for Donald 
Trump’s opponent. 
Officials like Mr. Sterling warned 
Trump that if this continued, someone 
is going to get killed, but Donald 
Trump didn’t stop. He escalated it even 
further. He made a personal call. 
He made a personal call. You heard 
that call because it was recorded. The 
President of the United States told the 
secretary of state that if he does not 
find votes, he will face criminal pen-
alties. 
Please, Senators, consider that for a 
second, the President putting all of 
this public and private pressure on 
elected officials, telling them that they 
could face criminal penalties if they 
don’t do what he wants. 
And not just any number of votes 
that he was looking for—Donald Trump 
was asking the secretary of state to 
somehow find the exact number of 
votes Donald Trump lost the State by. 
Remember, President Biden won Geor-
gia by 11,779 votes. In his own words, 
President Trump said: 
All I want to do is this. I just want to find 
11,780 votes. 
He wanted the secretary of state to 
somehow find the precise number, plus 
one, of votes that he needed to win. 
As a Congress and as a nation, we 
cannot be numb to this conduct. If we 
are and if we don’t set a precedent 
against it, more Presidents will do this 
in the future. This will be a green light 
for them to engage in that kind of pres-
sure and that kind of conduct. 
This could have gone a very different 
way if those elected officials had bowed 
to the intimidation and the pressure of 
the President of the United States. It 
would have meant that, instead of the 
American people deciding this election, 
President Trump alone would have de-
cided this American election. That is 
exactly what was at stake, and that is 
exactly what he was trying to do. He 
intended, wanted to, and tried to over-
turn the election by any means nec-
essary. He tried everything else that he 
could do to win. He started inciting the 
crowd; 
issuing 
tweet 
after 
tweet; 
issuing commands to stop the count, 
stop the steal. He worked up the crowd, 
sent a ‘‘save the date.’’ 
So it wasn’t just one speech or one 
thing; he was trying everything. He 
was pressuring elected officials. He was 
riling up his base, telling them the 
election had been stolen from them, 
that it had been stolen from him. It 
was a combination of things that only 
Donald Trump could have done. For us 
to believe otherwise is to think that 
somehow a rabbit came out of a hat 
and this mob just showed up here on 
their own, all by themselves. 
This is dangerous, Senators, and the 
future of our democracy truly rests in 
your hands. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I send a 
question to the desk. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Texas, Mr. CORNYN, has a 
question for both counsel for the 
former President and the House man-
agers. 
The clerk will read the question, and 
we will recognize first the counsel for 
the former President. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The House managers have argued that if 
the Senate cannot convict former officers, 
then the Constitution creates a January ex-
ception pursuant to which a President is free 
to act with impunity because he is not sub-
ject to impeachment, conviction, and re-
moval and/or disqualification. But isn’t a 
President subject to criminal prosecution 
after he leaves office for acts committed in 
office, even if those acts are committed in 
January? 
Mr. Counsel CASTOR. The Senator 
from Texas’s question raises a very, 
very important point. There is no such 
thing as a January exception to im-
peachment. There is only the text of 
the Constitution, which makes very 
clear that a former President is subject 
to criminal sanction after his Presi-
dency for any illegal acts he commits. 
There is no January exception to im-
peachment. There is simply a way we 
treat high crimes and misdemeanors 
allegedly committed by a President 
when he is in office—impeachment— 
and how we treat criminal behavior by 
a private citizen when they are not in 
office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S694 
February 12, 2021 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
House managers. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
Senators, thank you for this excellent 
question. 
Wouldn’t a President who decides to 
commit his crimes in the last few 
weeks in office, like President Trump 
by inciting the insurrection against 
the counting of electoral college votes, 
be subject to criminal prosecution by 
the U.S. attorney for the District of 
Columbia, for example, the Depart-
ment of Justice? 
Well, of course he would be, but that 
is true of the President regardless of 
when he commits his offense in office. 
In other words, that is an argument for 
prosecuting him if he tried to stage an 
insurrection against the Union in his 
third year in office or his second year 
in office. You could say, well, he could 
be prosecuted afterwards. 
The reason that the Framers gave 
Congress—the House the power to im-
peach; the Senate the power to try, 
convict, remove, and disqualify, was to 
protect the Republic. It is not a vindic-
tive power. 
I know a lot of people are very angry 
with Donald Trump about these ter-
rible events that took place. We don’t 
come here in anger, contrary to what 
you heard today. We come here in the 
spirit of protecting our Republic, and 
that is what it is all about. But their 
January exception would essentially 
invite Presidents and other civil offi-
cers to run rampant in the last few 
weeks in office on the theory that the 
House and the Senate wouldn’t be able 
to get it together in time—certainly 
according to their demands for months 
and months of investigation—wouldn’t 
be able to get it together in time in 
order to vindicate the Constitution. 
That can’t be right. That can’t be 
right. 
We know that the peaceful transfer 
of power is always the most dangerous 
moment for democracies around the 
world. Talk to the diplomats. Talk to 
the historians. They will tell you that 
is a moment of danger. That is when 
you get the coups. That is when you 
get the insurrections. That is when you 
get the seditious plots. And you know 
what, you don’t even have to read his-
tory for that. You don’t even have to 
consult the Framers. You don’t have to 
look around the world. It just happened 
to us. The moment when we were just 
going to collect the already-certified 
electoral college votes from the States 
by the popular majorities within each 
State—except for Maine and Nebraska, 
which do it by congressional district as 
well as statewide, but otherwise, it is 
just the popular majorities in the 
States. And we were about to certify it, 
and we got hit by a violent, insurrec-
tionary mob. 
Don’t take our word for it. Listen to 
the tapes, unless they are going to 
claim those are fabricated too. And the 
people are yelling: ‘‘This is our house 
now’’ and ‘‘Where are the ‘blank’ votes 
at?’’ and ‘‘Show us the votes,’’ et 
cetera. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
time is up. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is 
my understanding that there are no 
further questions on either side. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. That is correct. I 
know of no further questions on our 
side. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the time for questions and 
answers be considered expired. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that it be in 
order for myself and Senator MCCON-
NELL to speak for up to 1 minute each 
and then it be in order for me to make 
a unanimous consent request as if in 
legislative session. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN CON-
GRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
moment I will ask the Senate to pass 
legislation that would award Capitol 
Police Officer Eugene Goodman the 
Congressional Gold Medal. 
In the weeks after the attack on Jan-
uary 6, the world learned about the in-
credible, incredible bravery of Officer 
Goodman on that fateful day. 
Here in this trial, we saw new video, 
powerful video showing calmness under 
pressure, his courage in the line of 
duty, his foresight in the midst of 
chaos, and his willingness to make 
himself a target of the mob’s rage so 
that others might reach safety. 
Officer Goodman is in the Chamber 
tonight. 
Officer Goodman, thank you. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Leader MCCONNELL. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Oh, I am sorry. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I just want to say I 
think we can all agree that Eugene 
Goodman deserves the highest honor 
Congress can bestow. But before we 
move to pass this legislation, I want to 
be clear that he was not alone that 
day. The Nation saw and has now seen 
numerous examples of the heroic con-
duct of the Capitol Police, the Metro-
politan Police, and the SWAT teams 
that were with us on January 6 here in 
the Capitol, protecting us. Our heart-
felt gratitude extends to each and 
every one of them, particularly now as 
members of the force continue to bear 
scars, seen and unseen, from the events 
of that disgraceful day. Let us give 
them all the honor and recognition 
they so justly deserve. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to join the majority lead-
er’s request. 
January 6 was a day of fear for those 
who work here in the Capitol and of 
sadness for many more watching from 
afar, but that awful day also intro-
duced our Nation to a group of heroes 
whom we in Congress were already 
proud to call our colleagues and to 
whom we owe a great debt. 
In the face of lawlessness, the officers 
of the U.S. Capitol lived out the fullest 
sense of their oaths. If not for the 
quick thinking and bravery of Officer 
Eugene Goodman in particular, people 
in this Chamber may not have escaped 
that day unharmed. Officer Goodman’s 
actions reflect a deep personal commit-
ment to duty and brought even greater 
distinction upon all of the brave broth-
ers and sisters in uniform. So I am 
proud the Senate has taken this step 
forward, recognizing his heroism with 
the highest honor we can bestow. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as if 
in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 35 and that the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 35) to award a Congressional Gold 
Medal to Officer Eugene Goodman. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Van Hollen substitute 
amendment which is at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 890) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to, as 
follows: 
[Purpose: In the nature of a substitute] 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Officer Eu-
gene Goodman Congressional Gold Medal 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) On January 6, 2021, the United States 
Capitol Building was attacked by armed in-
surrectionists. 
(2) Members of the United States Capitol 
Police force were overrun and insurrection-
ists breached the Capitol at multiple points. 
(3) Around 2:14 in the afternoon, United 
States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Good-
man confronted an angry group of insurrec-
tionists who unlawfully entered the Capitol, 
according to video footage taken by Igor 
Bobic, a reporter with the Huffington Post. 
(4) Officer Goodman, alone, delayed the 
mob’s advance towards the United States 
Senate Chamber and alerted his fellow offi-
cers to the location of the insurrectionists. 
(5) Upon reaching a second floor corridor, 
Officer Goodman noticed the entrance to the 
Senate Chamber was unguarded.

February 12, 2021 
(6) As the mob approached, Officer Good-
man intentionally diverted attention away 
from the Senate entrance and led the mob to 
an alternate location and additional await-
ing officers. 
(7) At 2:15 in the afternoon, a Washington 
Post reporter from inside the Senate Cham-
ber noted ‘‘Senate sealed’’ with Senators, 
staff, and members of the press inside. 
(8) Officer Eugene Goodman’s selfless and 
quick-thinking actions doubtlessly saved 
lives and bought security personnel precious 
time to secure and ultimately evacuate the 
Senate before the armed mob breached the 
Chamber. 
(9) Amidst a shocking, unpatriotic attack 
on the Capitol, Officer Goodman’s heroism is 
recognized not only by Members of Congress 
and staff but also by the people of the United 
States they represent. 
(10) By putting his own life on the line and 
successfully, single-handedly leading insur-
rectionists away from the floor of the Senate 
Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman per-
formed his duty to protect the Congress with 
distinction, and by his actions, Officer Good-
man left an indelible mark on American his-
tory. 
(11) Officer Goodman’s actions exemplify 
the heroism of the many men and women 
who risked their lives to defend the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021.

duct hearings, shall be open to the public ex-
cept as otherwise specifically provided in

Rule 4.—(a) Subject to paragraph (b), one- 
third of the membership of the committee, 
actually present, shall constitute a quorum

nority. 
(b) A majority of the members of a sub-
committee, actually present, shall con-
stitute

for 
the 
purpose 
of 
transacting business: provided, no measure 
or matter shall be ordered reported unless 
such majority shall include at least one 
member of the minority who is a member of 
the subcommittee. If, at any subcommittee 
meeting, a measure or matter cannot be or-
dered reported because of the absence of such 
a minority member, the measure or matter 
shall lay over for a day. If the presence of a 
member of the minority is not then ob-
tained, a majority of the members of the 
subcommittee, actually present, may order 
such measure or matter reported.

reported from the committee or a sub-
committee unless a majority of the com-
mittee 
or

the committee or subcommittee, one mem-
ber thereof may conduct public hearings

While proxies may be voted on a motion to 
report a measure or matter from the com-
mittee, such a motion shall also require the 
concurrence of a majority of the members 
who are actually present at the time such 
action is taken. 
The committee may poll any matters of 
committee business as a matter of unani-
mous consent; provided that every member 
is polled and every poll consists of the fol-
lowing two questions: 
(1) Do you agree or disagree to poll the pro-
posal; and 
(2) Do you favor or oppose the proposal. 
Rule 7.—There shall be prepared and kept a 
complete transcript or electronic recording 
adequate to fully record the proceedings of

of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate, unless a majority of said members vote 
to forgo such a record. Such records shall 
contain the vote cast by each member of the 
committee or subcommittee on any question 
on which a ‘‘yea and nay’’ vote is demanded, 
and shall be available for inspection by any 
committee member. The clerk of the com-
mittee, or the clerk’s designee, shall have

distribution to the members of the com-
mittee. 
Rule 9.—The committee or a subcommittee 
shall require all witnesses heard before it to 
file written statements of their proposed tes-
timony at least 24 hours before a hearing, 
unless the chair and the ranking minority 
member determine that there is good cause 
for failure to so file, and to limit their oral 
presentation to brief summaries of their ar-
guments. Testimony may be filed electroni-
cally. The presiding officer at any hearing is 
authorized to limit the time of each witness 
appearing before the committee or a sub-
committee. 
The 
committee 
or 
a 
sub-
committee shall, as far as practicable, uti-
lize testimony previously taken on bills and 
measures similar to those before it for con-
sideration. 
Rule 10.—Should a subcommittee fail to re-
port back to the full committee on any 
measure within a reasonable time, the chair

dispensation of the committee or sub-
committee or the chair thereof.

subcommittee shall be empowered to adjourn 
any meeting of the committee or a sub-
committee if a quorum is not present within 
fifteen minutes of the time schedule for such

shall distribute to each member of the com-
mittee or subcommittee a document, pre-
pared by the sponsor of the bill or joint reso-
lution. If the bill or joint resolution has no 
underlying statutory language, the docu-
ment shall consist of a detailed summary of 
the purpose and impact of each section. If 
the bill or joint resolution repeals or amends 
any statute or part thereof, the document 
shall consist of a detailed summary of the 
underlying statute and the proposed changes 
in each section of the underlying law and ei-
ther a print of the statute or the part or sec-
tion thereof to be amended or replaced show-
ing by stricken-through type, the part or 
parts to be omitted and, in italics, the mat-
ter proposed to be added, along with a sum-
mary of the proposed changes; or a side-by- 
side document showing a comparison of cur-
rent law, the proposed legislative changes, 
and a detailed description of the proposed 
changes. 
Rule 16.—An appropriate opportunity shall 
be given the minority to examine the pro-
posed text of committee reports prior to 
their filing or publication. In the event there 
are supplemental, minority, or additional 
views, an appropriate opportunity shall be 
given the majority to examine the proposed 
text prior to filing or publication. Unless the 
chair and ranking minority member agree on 
a shorter period of time, the minority shall 
have no fewer than three business days to 
prepare supplemental, minority or addi-
tional views for inclusion in a committee re-
port from the time the majority makes the 
proposed text of the committee report avail-
able to the minority. 
Rule 17.—(a) The committee, or any sub-
committee, may issue subpoenas, or hold 
hearings to take sworn testimony or hear 
subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investiga-
tive activity has been authorized by major-
ity vote of the committee. 
(b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to 
take sworn testimony or hear subpoenaed 
witnesses, three members of the committee 
or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum: 
provided, with the concurrence of the chair 
and ranking minority member of the com-
mittee or subcommittee, a single member 
may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take 
sworn testimony. 
(c) The committee may, by a majority 
vote, delegate the authority to issue sub-
poenas to the chair of the committee or a 
subcommittee, or to any member designated 
by such chairman. Prior to the issuance of 
each subpoena, the ranking minority mem-
ber of the committee or subcommittee, and 
any other member so requesting, shall be no-
tified regarding the identity of the person to 
whom it will be issued and the nature of the 
information sought and its relationship to 
the authorized investigative activity, except 
where the chair of the committee or sub-
committee, in consultation with the ranking 
minority member, determines that such no-
tice would unduly impede the investigation. 
All information obtained pursuant to such 
investigative activity shall be made avail-
able as promptly as possible to each member 
of the committee requesting same, or to any 
assistant to a member of the committee des-
ignated by such member in writing, but the 
use of any such information is subject to re-
strictions imposed by the rules of the Sen-
ate. Such information, to the extent that it 
is relevant to the investigation shall, if re-
quested by a member, be summarized in 
writing as soon as practicable. Upon the re-
quest of any member, the chair of the com-
mittee or subcommittee shall call an execu-
tive session to discuss such investigative ac-
tivity or the issuance of any subpoena in 
connection therewith. 
(d) Any witness summoned to testify at a 
hearing, or any witness giving sworn testi-
mony, may be accompanied by counsel of his 
own choosing who shall be permitted, while 
the witness is testifying, to advise him of his 
legal rights. 
(e) No confidential testimony taken or con-
fidential material presented in an executive 
hearing, or any report of the proceedings of 
such an executive hearing, shall be made 
public, either in whole or in part or by way 
of summary, unless authorized by a majority 
of the members of the committee or sub-
committee. 
Rule 18.—Presidential nominees shall sub-
mit a statement of their background and fi-
nancial interests, including the financial in-
terests of their spouse and children living in 
their household, on a form approved by the 
committee which shall be sworn to as to its 
completeness and accuracy. The committee 
form shall be in two parts— 
(I) information relating to employment, 
education and background of the nominee re-
lating to the position to which the individual 
is nominated, and which is to be made pub-
lic; and, 
(II) information relating to financial and 
other background of the nominee, to be made 
public when the committee determines that 
such information bears directly on the nomi-
nee’s qualifications to hold the position to 
which the individual is nominated. 
Information relating to background and fi-
nancial interests (parts I and II) shall not be 
required of nominees for less than full-time 
appointments to councils, commissions or 
boards when the committee determines that 
some or all of the information is not rel-
evant to the nature of the position. Informa-
tion relating to other background and finan-
cial interests (part II) shall not be required 
of any nominee when the committee deter-
mines that it is not relevant to the nature of 
the position. 
Committee action on a nomination, includ-
ing hearings or meetings to consider a mo-
tion to recommend confirmation, shall not 
be initiated until at least five days after the 
nominee submits the form required by this 
rule unless the chair, with the concurrence 
of the ranking minority member, waives this 
waiting period. 
Rule 19.—Subject to statutory require-
ments imposed on the committee with re-
spect to procedure, the rules of the com-
mittee may be changed, modified, amended 
or suspended at any time; provided, not less 
than a majority of the entire membership so 
determine at a regular meeting with due no-
tice, or at a meeting specifically called for 
that purpose. 
Rule 20.—When the ratio of members on the 
committee is even, the term ‘‘majority’’ as 
used in the committee’s rules and guidelines 
shall refer to the party of the chair for pur-
poses of party identification. Numerical re-
quirements for quorums, votes and the like 
shall be unaffected. 
Rule 21.—First degree amendments must be 
filed with the chair at least 24 hours before 
an executive session. The chair shall prompt-
ly distribute all filed amendments electroni-
cally to the members of the committee. The 
chair may modify the filing requirements to 
meet special circumstances with the concur-
rence of the ranking minority member. 
Rule 22.—In addition to the foregoing, the 
proceedings of the committee shall be gov-
erned by the Standing Rules of the Senate 
and the provisions of the Legislative Reorga-
nization Act of 1946, as amended. 
GUIDELINES
OF
THE SENATE COMMITTEE
ON 
HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS 
WITH RESPECT TO HEARINGS, MARKUP SES-
SIONS, AND RELATED MATTERS 
HEARINGS 
Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorga-
nization Act requires each committee of the 
Senate to publicly announce the date, place, 
and subject matter of any hearing at least 
one week prior to the commencement of such 
hearing. 
The spirit of this requirement is to assure 
adequate notice to the public and other 
Members of the Senate as to the time and 
subject matter of proposed hearings. In the 
spirit of section 133A(a) and in order to as-
sure that members of the committee are 
themselves fully informed and involved in 
the development of hearings: 
1. Public notice of the date, place, and sub-
ject matter of each committee or sub-
committee hearing should be inserted in the 
Congressional Record seven days prior to the 
commencement of such hearing. 
2. At least seven days prior to public notice 
of each committee or subcommittee hearing, 
the majority should provide notice to the 
minority of the time, place and specific sub-
ject matter of such hearing. 
3. At least three days prior to the date of 
such 
hearing, 
the 
committee 
or 
sub-
committee should provide to each member a 
list of witnesses who have been or are pro-
posed to be invited to appear. 
4. The committee and its subcommittee 
should, to the maximum feasible extent, en-
force the provisions of rule 9 of the com-
mittee rules as it relates to the submission 
of written statements of witnesses twenty- 
four hours in advance of a hearing. 
Witnesses will be urged to submit testi-
mony even earlier whenever possible. When 
statements are received in advance of a hear-
ing, the committee or subcommittee (as ap-
propriate) should distribute copies of such 
statements to each of its members. Witness 
testimony may be submitted and distributed 
electronically. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
MARKING UP BILLS 
In order to expedite the process of marking 
up bills and to assist each member of the 
committee so that there may be full and fair 
consideration of each bill which the com-
mittee or a subcommittee is marking up the 
following procedures should be followed: 
1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for 
an executive session for the purpose of mark-
ing up bills the committee or subcommittee 
(as appropriate) should provide written no-
tice to each of its members as to the time, 
place, and specific subject matter of such 
session, including an agenda listing each bill 
or other matters to be considered and includ-
ing: 
(a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or 
other legislative matter (or committee print 
thereof) to be considered at such executive 
session; and 
(b) a copy of a summary of the provisions 
of each bill, joint resolution, or other legis-
lative matter to be considered at such execu-
tive session including, whenever possible, an 
explanation of changes to existing law pro-
posed to be made. 
2. Insofar as practical, prior to the sched-
uled date for an executive session for the 
purpose of marking up bills, the committee 
or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should 
provide each member with a copy of the 
printed record or a summary of any hearings 
conducted by the committee or a sub-
committee with respect to each bill, joint 
resolution, or other legislative matter to be 
considered at such executive session.

sponded to a prehearing questionnaire sub-
mitted by the committee. 
4.5 Action on Confirmation.—A business

ures, matters or recommendations or a vote 
on closing a meeting or hearing to the pub-
lic, provided that every member is polled and 
every poll consists of the following two ques-
tions: 
(1) Do you agree or disagree to poll the pro-
posal; and 
(2) Do you favor or oppose the proposal.

business meeting may be held at the same

ity vote of those members present, discharge 
a subcommittee from further consideration 
of a specific piece of legislation.

February 12, 2021 
7.6 Application of Committee Rules to Sub-
committees.—The proceedings of each sub-
committee shall be governed by the rules of 
the full committee, subject to such author-
izations or limitations as the committee 
may from time to time prescribe. 
RULE 8—INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS AND 
DEPOSITIONS 
8.1 Investigations.—Any investigation un-
dertaken by the committee or a sub-
committee in which depositions are taken or 
subpoenas issued, must be authorized by a 
majority of the members of the committee 
voting for approval to conduct such inves-
tigation at a business meeting of the com-
mittee convened in accordance with Rule 1. 
8.2 Subpoenas.—The Chairman, with the 
approval of the ranking minority member of 
the committee, is delegated the authority to 
subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the 
production 
of 
memoranda, 
documents, 
records, or any other materials at a hearing 
of the committee or a subcommittee or in 
connection with the conduct of an investiga-
tion authorized in accordance with para-
graph 8.1. The Chairman may subpoena at-
tendance or production without the approval 
of the ranking minority member when the 
Chairman has not received notification from 
the ranking minority member of disapproval 
of the subpoena within 72 hours, excluding 
Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of 
the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by 
the ranking minority member as provided in 
this paragraph the subpoena may be author-
ized by vote of the members of the com-
mittee. When the committee or Chairman 
authorizes subpoenas, subpoenas may be 
issued upon the signature of the Chairman or 
any other member of the committee des-
ignated by the Chairman. 
8.3 Notice for Taking Depositions.—Notices 
for the taking of depositions, in an investiga-
tion authorized by the committee, shall be 
authorized and be issued by the Chairman or 
by a staff officer designated by him. Such no-
tices shall specify a time and place for exam-
ination, and the name of the Senator, staff 
officer or officers who will take the deposi-
tion. Unless otherwise specified, the deposi-
tion shall be in private. The committee shall 
not initiate procedures leading to criminal 
or civil enforcement proceedings for a wit-
ness’ failure to appear unless the deposition 
notice was accompanied by a committee sub-
poena. 
8.4 Procedure for Taking Depositions.— 
Witnesses shall be examined upon oath ad-
ministered by an individual authorized by 
local law to administer oaths. The Chairman 
will rule, by telephone or otherwise, on any 
objection by a witness. The transcript of a 
deposition shall be filed with the committee 
clerk. 
RULE 9—AMENDING THE RULES 
These rules shall become effective upon 
publication in the Congressional Record. 
These rules may be modified, amended, or re-
pealed by the committee, provided that all 
members are present or provide proxies or if 
a notice in writing of the proposed changes 
has been given to each member at least 48 
hours prior to the meeting at which action 
thereon is to be taken. The changes shall be-
come effective immediately upon publication 
of the changed rule or rules in the Congres-
sional Record, or immediately upon approval 
of the changes if so resolved by the com-
mittee as long as any witnesses who may be 
affected by the change in rules are provided 
with them.

1. IN GENERAL.—The regular meeting dates 
of the Committee shall be the first and third 
Wednesdays of each month. Additional meet-
ings may be called by the Chair as the Chair 
may deem necessary, or pursuant to the pro-
visions of paragraph 3 of rule XXVI of the

of no more than 14 calendar days may be 
closed to the public on a motion made and 
seconded to go into closed session to discuss 
only whether the matters enumerated in 
subparagraphs (A) through (F) would require 
the meeting to be closed, followed imme-
diately by a record vote in open session by a

or any subcommittee, when it is determined 
that the matter to be discussed or the testi-

fense or the confidential conduct of the for-
eign relations of the United States;

mittee staff personnel or internal staff man-
agement or procedure; 
(C) will tend to charge an individual with

the professional standing of an individual, or 
otherwise to expose an individual to public 
contempt or obloquy, or will represent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy 
of an individual;

mittee or subcommittee prescribes. In the

statement in accordance with this rule, the 
Chair of the Committee or subcommittee, as

poena. Proxies may not be counted in mak-
ing a quorum for purposes of this paragraph. 
3. TAKING TESTIMONY.—For the purpose of 
taking sworn testimony a quorum of the 
Committee and each subcommittee thereof, 
now or hereafter appointed, shall consist of 1 
member of the Committee. 
RULE III—PROXIES

by proxy, in writing or through personal in-
structions. 
RULE IV—CONSIDERATION OF BILLS AND 
RESOLUTIONS

consideration of any bill or resolution unless 
the bill or resolution has been filed with the 
Clerk of the Committee not less than 48

approved by the ranking minority member 
as provided in this paragraph, the subpoena

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S699 
February 12, 2021 
of the Chair or any other Member of the 
Committee designated by the Chair. At the 
direction of the Chair, with notification to 
the ranking minority member of not less 
than 72 hours, the staff is authorized to take 
depositions from witnesses. The ranking mi-
nority member, or a member of the Com-
mittee staff designated by the ranking mi-
nority member, shall be given the oppor-
tunity to attend and participate in the tak-
ing of any deposition. Witnesses at deposi-
tions shall be examined upon oath adminis-
tered by an individual authorized by law to 
administer oaths, or administered by any 
member of the Committee if one is present. 
2. COUNSEL.—Witnesses may be accom-
panied at a public or executive hearing, or 
the taking of a deposition, by counsel to ad-
vise them of their rights. Counsel retained 
by any witness and accompanying such wit-
ness shall be permitted to be present during 
the testimony of the witness at any public or 
executive hearing, or the taking of a deposi-
tion, to advise the witness, while the witness 
is testifying, of the witness’s legal rights. In 
the case of any witness who is an officer or 
employee of the government, or of a corpora-
tion or association, the Chair may rule that 
representation by counsel from the govern-
ment, corporation, or association or by coun-
sel representing other witnesses, creates a 
conflict of interest, and that the witness 
may only be represented during testimony 
before the Committee by personal counsel 
not from the government, corporation, or as-
sociation or by personal counsel not rep-
resenting other witnesses. This paragraph 
shall not be construed to excuse a witness 
from testifying in the event the witness’s 
counsel is ejected for conducting himself or 
herself in such manner as to prevent, im-
pede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the 
orderly administration of a hearing or the 
taking of a deposition. This paragraph may 
not be construed as authorizing counsel to 
coach the witness or to answer for the wit-
ness. The failure of any witness to secure 
counsel shall not excuse the witness from 
complying with a subpoena. 
3. RECORD.—An accurate electronic or sten-
ographic record shall be kept of the testi-
mony of all witnesses in executive and public 
hearings and depositions. If testimony given 
by deposition is transcribed, the individual 
administering the oath shall certify on the 
transcript that the witness was duly sworn 
in his or her presence and the transcriber 
shall certify that the transcript is a true 
record of the testimony. The transcript with 
these certifications shall be filed with the 
chief clerk of the Committee. The record of 
a witness’s testimony, whether in public or 
executive session or in a deposition, shall be 
made available for inspection by the witness 
or the witness’s counsel under Committee 
supervision. A copy of any testimony given 
in public session, or that part of the testi-
mony given by the witness in executive ses-
sion or deposition and subsequently quoted 
or made part of the record in a public ses-
sion, shall be provided to that witness at the 
witness’s expense if so requested. Upon in-
specting the transcript, within a time limit 
set by the Clerk of the Committee, a witness 
may request changes in the transcript to 
correct errors of transcription and grammat-
ical errors. The witness may also bring to 
the attention of the Committee errors of fact 
in the witness’s testimony by submitting a 
sworn statement about those facts with a re-
quest that it be attached to the transcript. 
The Chair or a member of the Committee 
staff designated by the Chair shall rule on 
such requests. 
RULE VI—BROADCASTING OF HEARINGS 
Public hearings of the full Committee, or 
any subcommittee thereof, shall be televised 
or broadcast only when authorized by the 
Chair and the ranking minority member of 
the full Committee. 
RULE VII—SUBCOMMITTEES 
1. HEARINGS.—Any member of the Com-
mittee may sit with any subcommittee dur-
ing its hearings. 
2. CHANGE OF CHAIR.—Subcommittees shall 
be considered de novo whenever there is a 
change in the Chair, and seniority on the 
particular 
subcommittee 
shall 
not 
nec-
essarily apply.

offers an amendment to a bill or joint resolu-
tion under consideration, those amendments 
shall be presented to the Committee or Sub-
committee in a like form, showing by typo-
graphical devices the effect of the proposed 
amendment on existing law. The require-

February 12, 2021 
be conducted only by members of the Sub-
committee or such professional staff as is au-
thorized by the Chairman or the Ranking 
Member of the Subcommittee. 
[g] Special meetings.—If at least three 
members of a Subcommittee desire that a 
special meeting of the Subcommittee be 
called 
by 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee, those members may file in the 
offices of the Committee their written re-
quest to the Chairman of the Subcommittee 
for that special meeting. Immediately upon 
the filing of the request, the Clerk of the 
Committee shall notify the Chairman of the 
Subcommittee of the filing of the request. If, 
within 3 calendar days after the filing of the 
request, the Chairman of the Subcommittee 
does not call the requested special meeting, 
to be held within 7 calendar days after the 
filing of the request, a majority of the mem-
bers of the Subcommittee may file in the of-
fices of the Committee their written notice 
that a special meeting of the Subcommittee 
will be held, specifying the date and hour of 
that special meeting. The Subcommittee 
shall meet on that date and hour. Imme-
diately upon the filing of the notice, the 
Clerk of the Committee shall notify all 
members of the Subcommittee that such spe-
cial meeting will be held and inform them of 
its date and hour. If the Chairman of the 
Subcommittee is not present at any regular 
or special meeting of the Subcommittee, the 
Ranking Member of the majority party on 
the Subcommittee who is present shall pre-
side at that meeting. 
[h] Voting.—No measure or matter shall be 
recommended from a Subcommittee to the 
Committee unless a majority of the Sub-
committee are actually present. The vote of 
the Subcommittee to recommend a measure 
or matter to the Committee shall require the 
concurrence of a majority of the members of 
the Subcommittee voting. On Subcommittee 
matters other than a vote to recommend a 
measure or matter to the Committee no 
record vote shall be taken unless a majority 
of the Subcommittee is actually present. 
Any absent member of a Subcommittee may 
affirmatively request that his or her vote to 
recommend a measure or matter to the Com-
mittee or his vote on any such other matters 
on which a record vote is taken, be cast by 
proxy. The proxy shall be in writing and 
shall be sufficiently clear to identify the 
subject matter and to inform the Sub-
committee as to how the member wishes his 
or her vote to be recorded thereon. By writ-
ten notice to the Chairman of the Sub-
committee any time before the record vote 
on the measure or matter concerned is 
taken, the member may withdraw a proxy 
previously given. All proxies shall be kept in 
the files of the Committee. 
RULE 4.—WITNESSES 
[a] Filing of statements.—Any witness ap-
pearing before the Committee or Sub-
committee 
[including 
any 
witness 
rep-
resenting a Government agency] must file 
with the Committee or Subcommittee [24 
hours preceding his or her appearance] 30 
copies of his or her statement to the Com-
mittee or Subcommittee, and the statement 
must include a brief summary of the testi-
mony. In the event that the witness fails to 
file a written statement and brief summary 
in accordance with this rule, the Chairman 
of the Committee or Subcommittee has the 
discretion to deny the witness the privilege 
of testifying before the Committee or Sub-
committee until the witness has properly 
complied with the rule. 
[b] Length of statements.—Written state-
ments properly filed with the Committee or 
Subcommittee may be as lengthy as the wit-
ness desires and may contain such docu-
ments or other addenda as the witness feels 
is necessary to present properly his or her 
views to the Committee or Subcommittee. 
The brief summary included in the state-
ment must be no more than 3 pages long. It 
shall be left to the discretion of the Chair-
man of the Committee or Subcommittee as 
to what portion of the documents presented 
to the Committee or Subcommittee shall be 
published in the printed transcript of the 
hearings. 
[c] Five-minute duration. Oral statements 
of witnesses shall be based upon their filed 
statements but shall be limited to 5 minutes 
duration. This period may be limited or ex-
tended at the discretion of the Chairman pre-
siding at the hearings. 
[d] Subpoena of witnesses.—Witnesses may 
be subpoenaed by the Chairman of the Com-
mittee or a Subcommittee with the agree-
ment of the Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee or Subcommittee or by a majority 
vote of the Committee or Subcommittee. 
[e] Counsel permitted.—Any witness sub-
poenaed by the Committee or Subcommittee 
to a public or executive hearing may be ac-
companied by counsel of his or her own 
choosing who shall be permitted, while the 
witness is testifying, to advise him or her of 
his or her legal rights. 
[f] Expenses of witnesses.—No witness shall 
be reimbursed for his or her appearance at a 
public or executive hearing before the Com-
mittee or Subcommittee unless such reim-
bursement is agreed to by the Chairman and 
Ranking Member of the Committee. 
[g] Limits of questions.—Questioning of a 
witness by members shall be limited to 5 
minutes duration. Members may be per-
mitted further questions of the witness after 
all members have been given an opportunity 
to question the witness. 
Additional opportunity to question a wit-
ness shall be limited to a duration of 5 min-
utes until all members have been given the 
opportunity to question the witness for a 
second time. This 5–minute period per mem-
ber will be continued until all members have 
exhausted their questions of the witness. 
After a witness has completed his or her 
testimony before the Committee or Sub-
committee, members may submit questions 
in writing to the Clerk for the record, which 
shall be due to the Clerk by a date deter-
mined by the Chairman, in consultation with 
the Ranking Member, but such due date 
shall be no later than 7 calendar days after 
the witness’s appearance before the Com-
mittee or Subcommittee. Any such witness 
shall respond in writing to any such written 
question for the record no later than 45 cal-
endar days after the witness’s date of appear-
ance 
before 
the 
Committee 
or 
Sub-
committee. For nominees before the Com-
mittee, the Chairman shall, in consultation 
with the Ranking Member, determine the 
time periods for the submission of member 
questions and the receipt of responses from 
nominees. 
RULE 5.—VOTING 
[a] Vote to report a measure or matter.— 
No measure or matter shall be reported from 
the Committee unless a majority of the 
Committee is actually present. The vote of 
the Committee to report a measure or mat-
ter shall require the concurrence of a major-
ity of the members of the Committee who 
are present. 
Any absent member may affirmatively re-
quest that his or her vote to report a matter 
be cast by proxy. The proxy shall be suffi-
ciently clear to identify the subject matter, 
and to inform the Committee as to how the 
member wishes his vote to be recorded there-
on. By written notice to the Chairman any 
time before the record vote on the measure 
or matter concerned is taken, any member 
may withdraw a proxy previously given. All 
proxies shall be kept in the files of the Com-
mittee, along with the record of the rollcall 
vote of the members present and voting, as 
an official record of the vote on the measure 
or matter. 
[b] Vote on matters other than to report a 
measure or matter. On Committee matters 
other than a vote to report a measure or 
matter, no record vote shall be taken unless 
a majority of the Committee are actually 
present. On any such other matter, a mem-
ber of the Committee may request that his 
or her vote may be cast by proxy. The proxy 
shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently 
clear to identify the subject matter, and to 
inform the Committee as to how the member 
wishes his or her vote to be recorded there-
on. By written notice to the Chairman any 
time before the vote on such other matter is 
taken, the member may withdraw a proxy 
previously given. All proxies relating to such 
other matters shall be kept in the files of the 
Committee. 
RULE 6.—QUORUM 
No executive session of the Committee or a 
Subcommittee shall be called to order unless 
a majority of the Committee or Sub-
committee, as the case may be, are actually 
present. Unless the Committee otherwise 
provides or is required by the Rules of the 
Senate, one member shall constitute a 
quorum for the receipt of evidence, the 
swearing in of witnesses, and the taking of 
testimony. 
RULE 7. STAFF PRESENT ON DAIS 
Only members and the Clerk of the Com-
mittee shall be permitted on the dais during 
public or executive hearings, except that a 
member may have one staff person accom-
pany him or her during such public or execu-
tive hearing on the dais. If a member desires 
a second staff person to accompany him or 
her on the dais he or she must make a re-
quest to the Chairman for that purpose. 
RULE 8. COINAGE LEGISLATION 
At least 67 Senators must cosponsor any 
gold medal or commemorative coin bill or 
resolution before consideration by the Com-
mittee.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the following op-ed 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Fox News, Feb. 9, 2021] 
SEN. TED CRUZ: SHOULD THE SENATE EXER-
CISE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL? WHY THE ANSWER 
MATTERS 
(By Ted Cruz) 
The constitutional question of whether a 
former president can be impeached or tried 
after he has left office is a close legal ques-
tion. On balance, I believe that the better 
constitutional argument is that a former 
president can be impeached and tried—that 
is, that the Senate has jurisdiction to hold a 
trial. 
However, nothing in the text of the Con-
stitution requires the Senate to choose to 
exercise jurisdiction. In these particular cir-
cumstances, I believe the Senate should de-
cline to exercise jurisdiction—and so I voted 
to dismiss this impeachment on jurisdic-
tional grounds. 
Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution 
gives the House ‘‘the sole Power of impeach-
ment,’’ and Section 3 gives the Senate ‘‘the 
sole Power to try all impeachments.’’ At the 
time the Constitution was adopted, there 
was meaningful debate over whether im-
peachment encompassed so-called ‘‘late im-
peachments.’’ i.e. after the person had left 
office. 
The British common law, which informed 
the understanding of the Founders, suggests 
that the better answer is yes. 
In the 18th century, there were two English 
impeachments of note: Lord Chancellor 
Macclesfield in 1725 and India’s Governor- 
General Warren Hastings, which extended 
from 1787 to 1795. Both were late impeach-
ments (after they had left office). Shortly 
after the Founding, a third British impeach-
ment occurred: Lord Melville in 1806. His im-
peachment also occurred after he left office. 
The American experience is similar. In 
1797, the House impeached Sen. William 
Blount, and in 1876 the House impeached Sec-
retary of War William Belknap. Both had left 
office by the time articles of impeachment 
were delivered to the Senate. 
With Blount, the Senate voted that it 
lacked jurisdiction (although principally be-
cause he had been a senator and not a mem-
ber of the executive), and with Belknap, the 
Senate voted that it had jurisdiction but de-
clined to convict. 
To be sure, there is textual ambiguity on 
the question of whether impeachments of a 
former president are constitutional. 
One can look to other provisions of the 
Constitution—such as article II, Section 4’s 
reference to ‘‘the President’’ (not ‘‘a Presi-
dent’’), and that same section’s language 
that says an impeached individual who is 
convicted ‘‘shall be removed from office’’— 
and conclude in good faith that late im-
peachments are not permissible. 
However, 
given 
the 
historical 
underpinnings and the Constitution’s broad 
textual commitment (‘‘sole power’’) of the 
impeachment power to the House and Sen-
ate, I believe the best reading of the Con-
stitution is that the Senate retains jurisdic-
tion. Imagine, for example, that evidence 
were uncovered that a former president had 
sold nuclear secrets to the Chinese govern-
ment. In that instance, where the president 
had hypothetically committed both treason 
and bribery (explicit grounds for impeach-
ment in the Constitution), there is little 
question that both the House and Senate 
would have exercise jurisdiction to impeach 
and try those crimes. 
Importantly, there are two types of juris-
diction: mandatory and discretionary. With 
mandatory jurisdiction, the tribunal must 
hear the case; with discretionary jurisdic-
tion, the tribunal can decide whether to ex-
ercise its legal authority to hear the case. 
For example, the vast majority of the Su-
preme Court’s caseload arises on discre-
tionary jurisdiction—it has the authority to 
hear most cases, but it doesn’t have to do so. 
And nothing in the Constitution makes the 
Senate’s impeachment jurisdiction manda-
tory. ‘‘Sole power’’ means ‘‘sole power’’—the 
Senate can decide whether to hear the case. 
The present impeachment is an exercise of 
partisan retribution, not a legitimate exer-
cise of constitutional authority. 
The House impeached President Trump in 
a mere seven days. It conducted no hearings. 
It examined no evidence. It heard not a sin-
gle witness. 
For four years, congressional Democrats 
have directed hatred and contempt at Donald 
J. Trump, and even greater fury at the vot-
ers who elected him. 
On the merits, President Trump’s conduct 
does not come close to meeting the legal 
standard for incitement—the only charge 
brought against him. 
His rhetoric was at times over-heated, and 
I wish it were not, but he did not urge any-
one to commit acts of violence. And if ge-
neric exhortations to ‘‘fight’’ or ‘‘win’’ or 
‘‘take back our country’’ are now indictable, 
well, be prepared to arrest every candidate 
who’s ever run for office or given a stump 
speech. 
House Democrats argue that these cir-
cumstances are different. The situation was 
politically charged. The protesters were 
angry. And what started as a peaceful pro-
test on the Ellipse ended up with some of the 
protestors engaging in a violent terrorist as-
sault on the Capitol that tragically took the 
life of a police officer. 
If that’s the new standard—and if strong 
rhetoric constitutes ‘‘High Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’—then Congress better prepare 
to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D– 
Calif., Rep. Maxine Waters, D–Calif., Sen. 
Chuck Schumer, D–N.Y. and former Sen. 
Kamala Harris, D–Calif., next. 
Repeatedly over the past four years, mul-
tiple Democrats have engaged in incendiary 
rhetoric and encouraged civil unrest, includ-
ing Speaker Nancy Pelosi who expressly 
compared law enforcement to Nazis, Rep. 
Waters, who emphatically encouraged a cam-
paign of intimidation and harassment of po-
litical opponents, Sen. Schumer, who made 
threats—by name—to ‘‘release the whirl-
wind’’ against two sitting justices of the Su-
preme Court, and then-Sen. Harris, who ac-
tively campaigned to provide financial sup-
port, in the form of bail, for rioters last sum-
mer even after hundreds of law enforcement 
officers were injured and many people, in-
cluding retired St. Louis police captain 
David Dorn, were brutally murdered. 
There is no coherent rationale that renders 
President Trump’s remarks ‘‘incitement,’’ 
and somehow exonerates the angry rhetoric 
of countless Democrats. If Trump’s speech at 
the Ellipse was incitement, so too was Schu-
mer’s threat on the steps of the Supreme 
Court. 
The honest answer is both may have been 
irresponsible, but neither meets the legal 
standard for incitement. 
Accordingly, I voted against the Senate 
taking jurisdiction in this trial. In different 
circumstances, the Senate could choose to 
exercise its constitutional authority to try a 
former office-holder. But here, when the 
House has impeached without evidence or 
Due Process, and when it is petty and vindic-
tive and it fails to meet the legal standard, 
then the Senate should have declined to ex-
ercise jurisdiction. 
President Trump is no longer in office, and 
nothing 
is 
served—other 
than 
partisan 
vengeance—by conducting yet another im-
peachment trial.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LESLEY ROBINSON 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Lesley Robinson of Phillips County. 
Lesley recently made history when she 
became the first woman elected as the 
Montana Stockgrowers Association’s 
second vice president. 
Lesley is not afraid to be the first in 
any venture. Her past experience as a 
leader in Montana began in 1996 when 
she became the second woman ever 
elected to serve on the board of direc-
tors for the Montana Stockgrowers. 
Lesley also ran for office and was elect-
ed as a Phillips County commissioner 
in 2005. During her 12-year tenure as a 
commissioner, Lesley was a strong ad-
vocate for Phillips County and rural 
Montana. She also had a leadership 
role on the Executive Committee for 
the National Association of Counties. 
Most recently, Lesley served as former 
Congressman Greg Gianforte’s State 
director. 
As a fourth-generation rancher, Les-
ley knows the importance of hard 
work. She and her husband, Jim, own a 
commercial cow/calf and yearling oper-
ation near Zortman, MT. Her past lead-
ership roles and ranching experiences 
have led her to be a fierce voice for ag-
riculture and the importance it has as 
Montana’s No. 1 economic driver. 
It is my honor to recognize Lesley for 
her leadership and service to Montana. 
I look forward to hearing about her 
continued success.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO GARY HERBERT 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to congratulate my friend Gary Her-
bert on a career of esteemed public 
service. Gary’s steady hand of leader-
ship as the 17th Governor of Utah guid-
ed our State closer to fulfilling its 
promise of safety, security, and pros-
perity for all Utahns. 
A son of Orem, UT, Gary faithfully 
answered his call to service in his early 
life and career. From his missionary 
service for The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, to his military 
and civil service as a staff sergeant in 
the Utah Army National Guard, to 
elected office, Gary’s unwavering early 
commitment to public service earned 
him the respect and experience nec-
essary for future success.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S703 
February 12, 2021 
Gary Herbert’s unique ability to ar-
ticulate sound public policy on behalf 
of his community earned him a seat on 
the Utah County Commission, where he 
demonstrated principled leadership for 
14 years. Soon after, Herbert was elect-
ed to serve as lieutenant governor, 
overseeing multiple statewide commis-
sions and the State electoral office. 
Four years later, Utahns reaffirmed 
their State’s leadership with a record 
reelection victory for Governor John 
Huntsman Jr. and Lieutenant Governor 
Herbert. 
Governor Herbert assumed the man-
tle of leadership and gubernatorial re-
sponsibilities on August 11, 2009, fol-
lowing the resignation of his prede-
cessor. For the next decade, the Gov-
ernor 
approached 
significant 
chal-
lenges with a sharp focus and prin-
cipled decision making. He surrounded 
himself with impressive public serv-
ants and exemplified a compassionate 
and nuanced approach to good govern-
ance. Through an early economic crisis 
and a myriad of complex public policy 
challenges relating to civil liberties, 
faith, education, infrastructure, and 
public health, Governor Herbert’s leg-
acy reflects his impressive caliber of 
personal character and leadership in 
difficult circumstances. 
Gary’s lifetime of public service is 
sustained by the devotion he shares 
with former First Lady Jeannette Her-
bert and their children and grand-
children. Our great State owes Gary 
Herbert and his family an abundance of 
gratitude for years of integrity and vir-
tue as Utah’s chief public servant. 
Utah will continue to shine as the 
brightest star on our American flag.∑

‘‘(I) that not less than 40 percent of 
amounts made available under this section 
for purposes of procuring covered testing 
equipment and personal protective equip-
ment for the stockpile under paragraph (1) 
are allocated to procurement of such equip-
ment that is a domestic end product (as de-
fined in part 25.003 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations

under 
section 
1303(a)(1) of title 41, United States Code (or

ment to the Secretary for such purpose; and 
‘‘(II) that additional amounts made avail-
able under this section for the purposes de-
scribed in subclause (I), up to 100 percent of

equipment and the operational budget for 
the stockpile; and

ative agreement with an entity that has ex-
pertise in supply chain logistics and manage-
ment to carry out the activities described in 
this subparagraph. 
‘‘(ii) GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS AND 
MEDICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTORS.—In making 
sales under clause (i)(II)(bb), the Secretary

‘‘(C) 
VENDOR-MANAGED
INVENTORY.—For

final report on the program. 
‘‘(ii) CONSIDERATIONS.—The evaluation and 
reports under clause (i) shall consider how 
the program has impacted the continuity of 
stockpiling and readiness for the stockpile 
under paragraph (1), implications of the pro-
gram on the domestic supply chain, cost ef-
fectiveness of the program, and access to 
covered testing equipment and personal pro-
tective equipment for the Federal agencies 
and health care facilities pursuant to sub-
paragraph (B)(i)(II). 
‘‘(E) COVERED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND PER-
SONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.—For purposes

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smarter 
Pretrial Detention for Drug Charges Act of 
2021’’. 
SEC. 2. RELEASE CONDITIONS AND DETENTION 
IN FEDERAL CRIMINAL CASES. 
Section 3142 of title 18, United States Code, 
is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘(42 U.S.C. 14135a)’’ each 
place it appears and inserting ‘‘(34 U.S.C. 
40702)’’; and 
(2) in subsection (e)(3)— 
(A) by striking subparagraph (A); and 
(B) by redesignating subparagraphs (B), 
(C), (D), and (E) as subparagraphs (A), (B), 
(C), and (D), respectively. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. CORNYN): 
S. 311. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to include cer-
tain employment as a health care prac-
titioner as eligible for public service 
loan forgiveness, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about an issue of critical 
importance to California: doctor short-
ages. 
First, I want to express my deepest 
appreciation and gratitude to the en-
tire medical community, particularly 
the doctors, nurses, and support staff 
who have been on the frontlines of the 
coronavirus pandemic. Amidst a severe 
shortage of protective equipment, they 
nevertheless continue to work around 
the clock to save countless lives. I— 
and 
my 
colleagues—are 
eternally 
grateful. 
I have heard from countless Califor-
nians who have said the same thing: we 
need more doctors. 
That is why Congress established the 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness Pro-
gram in 2007 to encourage doctors to 
pursue careers at public and nonprofit 
facilities, especially in areas experi-
encing physician shortages. As a re-
sult, physicians who provide care in a 
nonprofit or public hospital can have 
their student debt forgiven by the Pub-
lic Service Loan Forgiveness Program 
after making 120 qualifying monthly 
payments under a qualifying repay-
ment plan. 
However, when the Department of 
Education issued implementing guid-
ance for the program, it unintention-
ally excluded California and Texas phy-
sicians from being eligible to receive 
loan forgiveness by requiring that bor-
rowers be classified as employees in 
order to be eligible for loan forgive-
ness. 
The problem is that under state law 
in California and Texas, doctors are 
prevented from being directly em-
ployed by corporations, including non-
profit organizations. As a result, physi-
cians in California and Texas who pro-
vide medical services at nonprofit hos-
pitals do not currently qualify for the 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness pro-
gram. 
To make matters worse, the United 
States is facing a shortage of physi-
cians, especially in California. 
The Council on Graduate Medical 
Education recommends 60 to 80 pri-
mary care physicians per 100,000 people. 
However, statewide in California, the 
number is already down to just 50 per 
100,000 people. And in some places, it is 
even lower: down to 35 primary care 
physicians per 100,000 people and 39 per 
100,000 people in the Inland Empire and 
San Joaquin Valley, respectively. 
During this difficult and challenging 
time, it is clear that more medical pro-
fessionals are needed. And long after 
this pandemic ends, we will still need 
more doctors to provide high-quality 
care, in both rural and urban areas. 
That is why I am pleased to intro-
duce the bipartisan ‘‘Stopping Doctor 
Shortages Act.’’ This legislation would 
help attract more doctors to public 
service and address the looming physi-
cian shortage by fixing a loophole that 
prevents thousands of doctors from 
participating in the Public Service 
Loan Forgiveness Program. 
According to the California Medical 
Association, this bill alone could bring 
as many as 10,000 physicians to Cali-
fornia over the next ten years. 
Similar legislation, soon to be intro-
duced in the House by Representatives 
JOSH HARDER, JAY OBERNOLTE, JOAQUIN 
CASTRO, and VAN TAYLOR, also enjoys 
bipartisan support. 
I would like to thank Senator JOHN 
CORNYN for his support on this critical 
issue and for cosponsoring the bill. 
I ask my colleagues to join us to pass 
the ‘‘Stopping Doctor Shortages Act’’ 
in a timely manner as we continue to 
find ways to combat the coronavirus 
pandemic and save lives. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
GRASSLEY, 
Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, 
Mr. TILLIS, Mr. COONS, Mr. 
CRAMER, Mr. BOOKER, and Mr. 
WICKER): 
S. 312. A bill to expand eligibility for 
and provide judicial review for the El-
derly Home Detention Pilot Program, 
provide 
for 
compassionate 
release 
based 
on 
COVID–19 
vulnerability, 
shorten the waiting period for judicial 
review during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and make other technical corrections; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD.

FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK OF

13 
THROUGH

ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK’’ TO 
RECOGNIZE

THE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 
WELL-BEING OF EVERY COMMU-

ACROSS 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. 
SCOTT
of South Carolina) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 57 
Whereas the experiment of self-governance 
is a profoundly entrepreneurial undertaking, 
grounded in the spirit of freedom, adventure, 
and enterprise; 
Whereas the entrepreneurial spirit, which 
is the ability, freedom, and courage to strike 
out on one’s own and build something new, is 
central to the identity of the United States 
and woven into the national consciousness; 
Whereas the United States is a nation of 
entrepreneurs, with small businesses— 
(1) comprising 99 percent of all businesses 
in the United States; and 
(2) employing nearly half of all workers in 
the United States; 
Whereas the Partnership for 21st Century 
Skills identified financial, economic, busi-
ness literacy, and entrepreneurship skills as 
the types of skills students need in order to 
enhance workplace productivity and career 
opportunities; 
Whereas students who participate in entre-
preneurship education programs have better 
attendance records, perform better on core 
subjects, and have lower drop-out rates than 
those who do not participate in those pro-
grams; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has— 
(1) closed hundreds of thousands of new 
businesses, also known as ‘‘startups’’, and 
small 
businesses, 
which 
has 
disproportionally affected women and people 
of color; and 
(2) destroyed millions of jobs, heightening 
the urgency of accelerating the post-COVID– 
19 recovery; 
Whereas research has demonstrated that 
startups— 
(1) are disproportionately responsible for 
the innovations that drive gains in produc-
tivity, which, in turn, propel economic 
growth; and 
(2) account for an outsized portion of net 
new job creation in the United States; 
Whereas research has demonstrated that 
rates of entrepreneurship in the United 
States have been in decline in recent dec-
ades, and that this decline is occurring in all 
50 States and across a broad range of indus-
try sectors; 
Whereas, in the wake of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the United States has seen an in-
crease in startup applications as individuals 
in the United States embody the entrepre-
neurial spirit to respond to the crisis; 
Whereas, given the importance of a thriv-
ing entrepreneurial spirit to innovation, eco-
nomic growth, job creation, rising wages, 
and expanding opportunity in the United 
States, the circumstances surrounding the 
COVID–19 amount to an emergency; 
Whereas reversing the decline in entrepre-
neurship in the United States requires 
changes in public policy; and 
Whereas National Entrepreneurship Week 
will focus on innovative ways in which inno-
vation, entrepreneurship communities, and 
policymakers in the United States can work 
together to improve the environment for en-
trepreneurs in the United States with the 
aim of— 
(1) reversing the multi-decade decline in 
entrepreneurship; and 
(2) expanding the rate of participation 
among women entrepreneurs and entre-
preneurs of color: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of February 13 
through February 20, 2021, as ‘‘National En-
trepreneurship Week’’; 
(2) celebrates the importance of entre-
preneurs and startups to the United States 
economy; 
(3) recognizes the contributions entre-
preneurs make to expand opportunity, pro-
vide more inclusive prosperity, and increase 
the well-being of every community across 
the United States; 
(4) affirms the importance and urgency of 
enacting policies that promote, nurture, and 
support entrepreneurs and startups; and 
(5) encourages Federal, State, and local 
governments, schools, nonprofit organiza-
tions, and other civic organizations to ob-
serve National Entrepreneurship Week annu-
ally with special events and activities— 
(A) to recognize the contributions of entre-
preneurs in the United States; 
(B) to teach the importance of entrepre-
neurship to a strong and inclusive economy; 
and 
(C) to take steps to encourage, support, 
and celebrate future entrepreneurs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S716 
February 12, 2021 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Officer Eu-
gene Goodman Congressional Gold Medal 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) On January 6, 2021, the United States 
Capitol Building was attacked by armed in-
surrectionists. 
(2) Members of the United States Capitol 
Police force were overrun and insurrection-
ists breached the Capitol at multiple points. 
(3) Around 2:14 in the afternoon, United 
States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Good-
man confronted an angry group of insurrec-
tionists who unlawfully entered the Capitol, 
according to video footage taken by Igor 
Bobic, a reporter with the Huffington Post. 
(4) Officer Goodman, alone, delayed the 
mob’s advance towards the United States 
Senate Chamber and alerted his fellow offi-
cers to the location of the insurrectionists. 
(5) Upon reaching a second floor corridor, 
Officer Goodman noticed the entrance to the 
Senate Chamber was unguarded. 
(6) As the mob approached, Officer Good-
man intentionally diverted attention away 
from the Senate entrance and led the mob to 
an alternate location and additional await-
ing officers. 
(7) At 2:15 in the afternoon, a Washington 
Post reporter from inside the Senate Cham-
ber noted ‘‘Senate sealed’’ with Senators, 
staff, and members of the press inside. 
(8) Officer Eugene Goodman’s selfless and 
quick-thinking actions doubtlessly saved 
lives and bought security personnel precious 
time to secure and ultimately evacuate the 
Senate before the armed mob breached the 
Chamber. 
(9) Amidst a shocking, unpatriotic attack 
on the Capitol, Officer Goodman’s heroism is 
recognized not only by Members of Congress 
and staff but also by the people of the United 
States they represent. 
(10) By putting his own life on the line and 
successfully, single-handedly leading insur-
rectionists away from the floor of the Senate 
Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman per-
formed his duty to protect the Congress with 
distinction, and by his actions, Officer Good-
man left an indelible mark on American his-
tory. 
(11) Officer Goodman’s actions exemplify 
the heroism of the many men and women 
who risked their lives to defend the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) 
PRESENTATION
AUTHORIZED.—The 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and 
the President pro tempore of the Senate 
shall make appropriate arrangements for the 
presentation, on behalf of the Congress, of a 
gold medal of appropriate design to Officer 
Eugene Goodman. 
(b) DESIGN AND STRIKING.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—For the purposes of the 
presentation referred to in subsection (a), 
the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in 
this Act as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall strike the 
gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, 
and inscriptions, to be determined by the 
Secretary. 
(2) IMAGE AND NAME.—The design shall bear 
an image of, and inscription of the name of, 
Officer Eugene Goodman. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
The Secretary may strike and sell dupli-
cates in bronze of the gold medal struck pur-
suant to section 3 under such regulations as 
the Secretary may prescribe, at a price suffi-
cient to cover the cost thereof, including 
labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
(a) NATIONAL MEDALS.—The medals struck 
pursuant to this Act are national medals for 
purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United 
States Code. 
(b) NUMISMATIC
ITEMS.—For purposes of 
section 5134 of title 31, United States Code, 
all medals struck under this Act shall be 
considered to be numismatic items.
