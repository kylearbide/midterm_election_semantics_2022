If H.R. 3684 (117th Congress) is enacted be-
fore the date of enactment of this Act, this 
Act shall not take effect and the provisions 
of this Act shall not be executed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 5434. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5434, the Surface Transportation Ex-
tension Act of 2021. 
I wish that we were not at this point, 
calling up a short-term extension of 
Federal 
highway, 
transit, 
highway 
safety, motor carrier, research, and 
transportation 
financing 
programs. 
Yet, here we are. 
The House did its work. We passed 
the INVEST in America Act on July 4, 
H.R. 3684, a 5-year transformative reau-
thorization of surface transportation 
for the Nation dealing with climate 
change, resilience, creating jobs, social 
equity, a host of other things, and re-
building our crumbling infrastructure. 
The Senate did something different, 
but they did pass the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act, the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 3684, which also in-
cluded a 5-year authorization of surface 
transportation programs. 
We have not yet found a path forward 
for both Chambers to pass the same 
version of this bill. But we do need to 
act immediately to restore the ability 
of Federal surface transportation pro-
grams to function and to prevent put-
ting thousands of U.S. Department of 
Transportation employees out of work 
for additional time. 
We need to act now to avoid further 
ramifications 
for 
surface 
transpor-
tation programs. At 12:01 a.m. today, 
October 1, 2021, U.S. Department of 
Transportation operations funded out 
of the highway trust fund had to shut 
down due to a lapse in authorization. 
Mr. Speaker, 3,700 employees received 
furlough notices that they could not 
work today or had to work without pay 
due to a temporary shutdown of these 
programs. 
Beginning this morning, the author-
ity for Federal highway, transit, high-
way safety, and motor carrier safety 
programs lapsed. This means that until 
Congress passes an extension or re-
placement authorization, the furlough 
of approximately 3,700 employees will 
continue, and the Federal Highway Ad-
ministration cannot provide any new 
funding to States, the District of Co-
lumbia, and the territories. The Fed-
eral Highway Administration can con-
tinue reimbursing States for obliga-
tions incurred before the lapse, but 
that is not enough. 
The Federal Transit Administration 
can’t issue new funding to 1,300 transit 
grantees that rely on Federal grants to 
fund construction, buy vehicles and 
equipment, and, in some cases, pay for 
operating costs. They can continue to 
make payments for grants issued be-
fore October 1, but that is not good 
enough. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration can’t award new high-
way traffic safety grants, and the Fed-
eral Motor Carrier Safety Administra-
tion must stop issuing new motor car-
rier safety grants. The Office of the 
Secretary can’t make any TIFIA loans, 
which are critical for many large 
projects. 
The Surface Transportation Exten-
sion Act of 2021 will allow the Depart-
ment of Transportation to restart oper-
ations of programs funded by the high-
way trust fund through October 31, 
2021, and bring employees back to 
work. It will also authorize DOT to 
provide backpay for employees who had 
to miss a day of work through no fault 
of their own and for those who worked 
without pay. 
The bill also includes provisions to 
adjust program levels should Congress 
enact a long-term surface transpor-
tation or infrastructure bill, H.R. 3684, 
during the extension period. 
Finally, the bill provides a similar 
short-term extension for the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission and the 
Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restora-
tion Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this extension which will help 
provide 
additional 
time 
to 
work 
through a final resolution on the legis-
lation between the House and the Sen-
ate. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am planning to sup-
port this short-term extension of high-
way programs because it is a clean ex-
tension, and it is the right thing to do 
at this point. 
At midnight last night, funding for 
these programs expired because I sup-
pose Speaker PELOSI and the majority

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5588 
October 1, 2021 
thought this lapse and shutdown would 
be minimal. Maybe we should ask the 
thousands of workers who are now fur-
loughed, our State departments of 
transportation, and other stakeholders 
whether they also would minimize the 
majority’s inaction and the game play-
ing that is taking place. 
Let me be clear: The Speaker’s par-
tisan process is what led us to this 
point, and this chaos highlights more 
than ever the need for us to be working 
across the aisle. Getting a bipartisan 
highway 
infrastructure 
bill 
done 
should be easiest thing that we do in 
Congress. Bipartisanship has always 
been the formula for success on infra-
structure, and that hasn’t changed. 
In my 20 years in Congress, I have 
supported all three highway bills that 
have been signed into law. All three of 
them were bipartisan. All three of 
them were under Republican chairmen. 
I stand ready to participate in a 
truly bipartisan process that involves 
input from both the House and the Sen-
ate, not just one Chamber. 
Republicans have put forward infra-
structure principles in numerous pieces 
of infrastructure legislation. We were 
ready to come to the negotiating table, 
but we didn’t get that opportunity. Re-
publicans warned that a partisan path 
would put us in a position like this, 
and here we are. 
Nevertheless, we remain ready to 
come to the table and get back to the 
bipartisan tradition on infrastructure. 
Passing this extension is the right 
thing to do, but the last thing we need 
is a series of short-term extensions. 
These short-term extensions are ex-
tremely detrimental to the States, to 
the stakeholders, and to the jobs that 
support these critical projects and pro-
grams. 
Short-term extensions mean leaving 
States with uncertainty in their plans 
to fix, maintain, and upgrade roads and 
bridges. Mr. Speaker, you can’t plan 
multiyear infrastructure and highway 
projects with the guarantee of only a 
few weeks of funding at a time. 
It is time to get back to what works. 
Bipartisanship on both sides of Capitol 
Hill is the key to success when it 
comes to infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this clean extension, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I believe 
I have the right to close. I have no fur-
ther speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume to close. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, this process has 
been horribly managed, and it is unfor-
tunate that we didn’t take this action 
before transportation programs were 
shut down and people were furloughed. 
Having said that, we need to provide 
this certainty for our State DOTs and 
for our transportation stakeholders. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I do urge 
support for this clean, short-term ex-
tension. It doesn’t cost anything, and 
it is the right thing to do. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this short- 
term extension to put DOT back to 
work and get on with the critical busi-
ness of rebuilding America’s infrastruc-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5434. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Alaska. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor this afternoon, 
unexpectedly. I had anticipated that I 
was going to be taking the long trek 
home, for even a short weekend, going 
back to Alaska. That is not the case 
this weekend, unfortunately. 
Our COVID numbers are at alltime 
highs, and most of the events and 
meetings that I would have had back 
home canceled. They are on Zoom. So 
life is just a little bit different. You 
roll with it. And it means that I am 
here in Washington, DC, on this Friday 
afternoon. 
But I opened up the paper this morn-
ing, the Anchorage Daily News, our 
largest statewide newspaper, to, again, 
headlines that have just kind of un-
folded over these past weeks with more 
just grim and difficult news. The head-
line today is: ‘‘Alaska infection rate re-
mains high with over 1,200 new COVID 
cases.’’ 
We are leading—we are leading the 
Nation right now in our COVID rates, 
and it is interesting. Alaska has—we 
are separated enough geographically, 
but through the advantages of air trav-
el and road travel, we mix, we mingle, 
we get around, and the virus knows no 
bounds, as we all know. But as we are 
seeing, thankfully, the case counts be-
ginning to decline here in the lower 48, 
Alaska is doing just the opposite. 
I am quoting here from our paper: 
On average, the U.S. saw a 26% decrease in 
cases over the last two weeks while Alaska 
recorded an 84% increase. 
They go on to say: 
If Alaska were a country, it would be the 
nation with the world’s highest per capita 
case rate, according to data from the Center 
for Systems Science and Engineering at 
Johns Hopkins University. 
The article proceeds to state that: 
Alaska’s 171 average daily cases per 100,000 
over the last seven days is nearly double the 
rate seen in West Virginia, which . . . [is 
currently] second in the [Nation]. Bermuda 
and Serbia, at the top of the global list, have 
a case rate of 99. 
So we are at 171 average daily cases 
per 100,000. It has been challenging. We 
are a State that has limited capacity. 
We have got a smaller population, ob-
viously. But that also means that we 
have fewer hospitals. We have more 
limited means, in terms of our ability 
to care for those who have become 
very, very sick, and it is straining—it 
is really maxing out our hospitals to 
levels that we really just could not 
have even anticipated could happen. 
As our hospitals are maxed out, it is 
not just the capacity, the number of 
people that you can put into your ICU; 
it is those who are daily doing the 
work of caring for those who are com-
ing into our hospitals, coming in sicker 
and staying longer. We have maxed out 
our hospitals, and when I say ‘‘maxing 
out,’’ in the Alaska vernacular, basi-
cally that means there is no room at 
the hospital. Our largest hospital is 
Providence, Alaska Regional, Mat-Su, 
Alaska Native Medical Center, Fair-
banks Memorial Hospital, Bartlett— 
they are at capacity within their ICUs, 
and let me share with you what it 
means to be at capacity in your ICU. 
I will share. I was at Alaska Regional 
just a weekend ago—actually, now two 
weekends ago—and I was told that 
their ICU, which is a 16-bed ICU, had 
been expanded to 20; and 100 percent of 
the beds, when I was there on that Sat-
urday, were occupied by COVID pa-
tients with no room for anyone else to 
come to that particular medical facil-
ity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6874 
October 1, 2021 
I had been at Fairbanks Memorial 
Hospital—actually there on an emer-
gency, not myself but with another in-
dividual. We go to the emergency 
room, and as we were waiting for the 
doctors to come and address this non- 
COVID-related medical emergency, I 
was advised by the evening supervisor 
that Fairbanks Memorial Hospital was 
at capacity within their ICU. And what 
that meant was that Fairbanks Memo-
rial was at capacity and, as of that 
evening, all of the other hospitals in 
Alaska that could care in an ICU ca-
pacity were filled. So I was told that 
my loved one may be in a situation, if 
he needed to be in the ICU, that I need-
ed to prepare myself and others that he 
may be sent to Seattle or Portland 
that night. For those of you that don’t 
know your geography there, that is a 3, 
31⁄2-hour flight by jet. It would have 
been a medevac. It is thousands of 
miles away. 
That is what is happening in Alaska 
right now. When your hospitals are 
full, you just can’t put them in an am-
bulance and take them to another 
town. We are taking these folks to an-
other State. And, again, keep in mind, 
the reason that I was there that 
evening with this individual was not 
COVID-related, but that is the squeeze. 
That is the pressure that it puts on the 
rest of your system. 
Just this week, the State is dealing 
with crisis standards of care guidelines 
as it relates to how individuals may re-
ceive monoclonal antibody treatments 
because the supplies are scarce out 
there. 
So it is tough right now. It is tough. 
Beds are hard to find, and the extraor-
dinary men and women who every day 
are going in and doing as best they can 
to provide for the level of care that is 
needed are doing so, but they are tired. 
They are tired. They can’t get enough 
help. You have those who are exposed. 
You have to quarantine. It puts pres-
sure on everybody else. People are run-
ning themselves to the ground. 
But we have good news that is hap-
pening. Our Governor has been working 
to bring additional health workers in, 
and we are starting to see, just this 
week, as many as—we were hoping 500 
but maybe a little bit less than that— 
nurses, 
respiratory 
therapists 
are 
starting to come to the State as part of 
a Federal contract. So you have got 
State-contracted healthcare workers. 
The Alaska Native Medical Center is 
going to be receiving additional sup-
port from a disaster medical assistance 
team. Again, we are at a point where 
you just can’t take it on anymore. And 
our numbers have not yet peaked. 
I don’t share these statistics and I 
don’t share the front page of the Daily 
News just to bring people up to speed 
as to what is happening in Alaska. 
That wasn’t necessarily my purpose 
here. 
My purpose this afternoon is, in the 
midst of this, in the midst of this real 
crisis in my State, when it comes to 
the availability of healthcare and re-
sponding to this virus that is killing— 
killing—Alaskans, killing Americans, 
killing people around the world, that 
we show a little kindness because right 
now that seems to be in as limited ca-
pacity as some of the hospitals that we 
have in Alaska. It is kindness and re-
spect for where people are. 
Your healthcare workers are giving 
every ounce of what they have to be 
there, to leave their families. They are 
worried about everybody. But they are 
there for us, and they are doing the 
best job possible. And some of what we 
see in return is not the best of Amer-
ica. It is not the best that Alaskans 
have to offer. 
We have had some just horrible, hor-
rible 
confrontations 
in 
our 
public 
meetings in Anchorage. The top of the 
fold in the Anchorage paper is about an 
assembly meeting where individuals 
wore yellow Stars of David to protest 
the mask ordinance that the Anchor-
age assembly was taking up, comparing 
the mask mandate to the Holocaust. It 
is shocking. At some of the assembly 
meetings—and it is not just in Anchor-
age, we are seeing it in other commu-
nities as well—it is neighbor against 
neighbor. 
We have had providers go to provide 
testimony before in these public meet-
ings, and not only have they been ridi-
culed and mocked, but we hear the sto-
ries, we read the stories that they have 
been spit upon. This is not how we 
show appreciation for those who are 
trying their absolute best to be there 
for us. And they will literally turn the 
other cheek and make sure that the 
care that they are providing in that 
ICU, in that ER, is without discrimina-
tion as to whether or not you have 
been vaccinated or not. They are going 
to be there to take care of you. So, 
please, can we please show some kind-
ness to one another at these times of 
stress and of anxiety to families? 
We in Alaska are pretty hardy. We 
are independent. We can handle things 
on our own, but we are better because 
we are also good neighbors to one an-
other, more often than not. 
When somebody’s car breaks down by 
the side of the road, and it is cold and 
it is dark, we stop. We help them. We 
are there for them. When somebody is 
sick, we deliver the food. We are good 
neighbors. So we, in Alaska, need to re-
member to be that good neighbor to 
one another. We can have disagree-
ments. We can have differing points of 
view. We can express them without de-
grading one another, without deni-
grating 
one 
another, 
without 
humiliating, and mocking one another. 
So I know that we will be beyond 
COVID. It is not coming soon enough 
for any of us. But I just ask that as we 
go through this, in this State and 
around this country and around the 
world, that we remember that we are 
all better when we care for one another 
and we show a little kindness. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized.

There being no objection, the Senate,

call of the Chair and reassembled at 
8:05 p.m. when called to order by the 
President pro tempore.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6876 
October 1, 2021 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. Res. 405, which was sub-
mitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 405) to authorize rep-
resentation by the Senate Legal Counsel in 
the case of Shawn Musgrave v. Mark Warner 
and the U.S. Senate Select Committee on In-
telligence. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
resolution concerns a lawsuit filed in 
Federal court in the District of Colum-
bia against the Select Committee on 
Intelligence and Chairman WARNER, 
that attempts to force the committee 
to release to the plaintiff the full re-
port of the Committee’s in-depth study 
of the CIA’s terrorist detention and in-
terrogation program. Plaintiff claims 
that he has a common law right, never 
before applied to Senate records, to re-
view this committee document despite 
the report being classified and despite 
the committee having not chosen to re-
lease the report publicly and having 
submitted it to the Senate confiden-
tially. 
It is important to note that the com-
mittee 
has 
already 
released 
the 
lengthy executive summary and the 
findings and conclusions from the re-
port, after a declassification review; so 
the public has been informed of the 
committee’s work and the findings and 
conclusions of its study. 
Plaintiff’s attempt to force the Sen-
ate to release to him the full report not 
only contravenes the Senate’s con-
stitutional prerogative to decide which 
documents to keep confidential, but 
also interferes with the independence 
of the Senate in conducting its legisla-
tive and oversight duties. This resolu-
tion would authorize the Senate legal 
counsel to represent the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence and Chairman 
WARNER in order to seek dismissal of 
this suit. 
Mr. WYDEN. I further ask that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble 
be agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 405) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to.

printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)

SEL IN THE CASE OF SHAWN 
MUSGRAVE V. J. THOMAS MAN-
GER, ET AL. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. Res. 406, which was sub-
mitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 406) to authorize rep-
resentation by the Senate Legal Counsel in 
the case of Shawn Musgrave v. J. Thomas 
Manger, et al. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
resolution concerns a lawsuit filed in 
Federal court in the District of Colum-
bia against the Secretary of the Senate 
and her office and that seeks to force 
the Secretary to provide the plaintiff 
with a copy of the Senate security 
manual. That manual, which is for in-
ternal Senate use and is not publicly 
available, sets forth the procedures for 
handling classified national security 
information within the Senate. Plain-
tiff claims that he has a common law 
right, never before applied to Senate 
records, to review this Senate docu-
ment despite the security manual 
being restricted to internal Senate dis-
tribution given the sensitivity of the 
procedures for protecting classified in-
formation maintained by the Senate. 
Plaintiff’s suit seeking to compel the 
production of this Senate document en-
croaches upon the Senate’s constitu-
tional prerogative to decide which doc-
uments to keep confidential and inter-
feres with the independence of the Sen-
ate in establishing its own internal 
rules and guidelines for handling infor-
mation necessary to carrying out its 
legislative and oversight responsibil-
ities. This resolution would authorize 
the Senate legal counsel to represent 
the Secretary and her office in this 
case in order to seek dismissal of this 
suit. 
Mr. WYDEN. I further ask that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble 
be agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 406) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to.

HONORING HOLLY’S HISTORY OF 
SERVICE 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize my little town of Holly and, in par-
ticular, its commitment to its men and women 
who have served in uniform. I am especially 
proud to commemorate the Holly Area Vet-
erans Resource Center and its dedicated 
members as they host a Welcome Home 
event tomorrow for our troops and their fami-
lies. 
Holly’s track record of service isn’t limited to 
just one event on one day—far from it. Our vil-
lage’s commitment is absolute, as evidenced 
by the namesake of the community center 
where the Veterans’ Resource Center holds its 
events: Lt. Karl Richter. 
As a 23-year-old officer in the Air Force, Lt. 
Richter became the youngest pilot to shoot 
down a MiG over Vietnam. He would eventu-
ally fly 198 missions—the most out of any air-
man at the time—and would ultimately earn 
the Air Force Cross, the Silver Star, and Pur-
ple Heart for his valor. 
Lt. Richter was born and raised in Holly, 
and the legacy of service that he exemplified 
continues to live on in our community. The old 
oak tree in the parking lot of Holly Elementary 
School is ringed by dozens of yellow ribbons 
noting which of our hometown heroes are on 
active duty. Holly is also home to the Great 
Lakes National Cemetery, where over fifty- 
thousand of our nation’s veterans and their 
family members have been laid to rest. At 
their military funerals, it’s common to see a 
joint honor guard of Holly VFW and American 
Legion members carry on their traditions with 
a performance. 
Lastly, together with local leaders and vet-
erans groups, my team led an effort to rename 
our local post office. I believe service is the 
greatest love letter you can send your country, 
and at the Holly Veterans Memorial Post Of-
fice, we will soon be able to pay tribute to that 
service each time we send letters of our own. 
In short, Holly is a place that knows its vet-
erans. We’re proud to stand with them 
throughout their entire careers—from that first 
bus that takes them to boot camp until their 
retirement and beyond. After all, when we 
send folks to fight for us, we have a responsi-
bility to care for them and their loved ones for 
the rest of their lives. 
That said, we know that the return to civilian 
life can be difficult. With its Welcome Home 
event tomorrow, Holly honors the service and 
sacrifice of veterans and their families. With a 
parade, food trucks, and live music, we will 
celebrate the folks who stepped up to serve 
our nation. And through a commemorative pin-
ning for any veteran who served from 1955 to 
1975, we will thank them for their willingness 
to risk life and limb to defend our way of life. 
Representing Holly is one of the greatest 
privileges of my life. I’m proud to honor Holly, 
so that its legacy of service can forever be re-
membered.

SARY OF THE DIAMOND JUBI-
LEE, OF SAINT TIMOTHY CATHO-
LIC CHURCH 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the 60th anniversary of the Diamond 
Jubilee, of Saint Timothy Catholic Church in 
Miami, FL. Saint Timothy was founded in 
1960, and the church and parish have ex-
panded to include many members of Florida’s 
26th Congressional District and beyond. 
Saint Timothy Catholic Church not only pro-
vides a place of worship but also engages its 
parishioners through outreach to give back to 
the surrounding community. By distributing 
food to the hungry and providing a wide range 
of outreach services, the church exhibits the 
strong passion it has for helping others. I am 
very thankful for all the great work that Saint 
Timothy Catholic Church and their parish-
ioners contribute to our community. 
I congratulate all members of Saint Timothy 
Catholic Church on their 60 years of commu-
nity. I look forward to their continued success 
and prosperity in the future.

HONORING BILL MCCARTHY, 2021 
CENTRAL OHIO SENIOR CITIZENS 
HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the Central 
Ohio Area Agency on Aging will host its 45th 
annual Central Ohio Senior Citizens Hall of 
Fame induction ceremony on October 6 in Co-
lumbus. I am honored to commend to the 
House one of this year’s inductees: William 
McCarthy of Marysville. 
Bill is a mainstay of the Marysville commu-
nity. He started working at Wolgamot’s Drug 
Store in 1949, the same year he graduated 
from Marysville High School. He then earned 
his pharmacy degree from Ohio Northern Uni-
versity, after which he purchased a share in 
Wolgamot’s. In 1971, after buying out the last 
of his partners, he renamed it McCarthy Phar-
macy. McCarthy Pharmacy was a downtown 
Marysville landmark for many years, famous 
for its five-cent coffee. 
Bill met his wife, Ruth, in 1949 while work-
ing at the pharmacy. They shared 63 years of 
marriage until her passing in 2016. They were 
long-time members of Trinity Lutheran Church 
and committed delivery drivers for Meals on 
Wheels programs in Marysville and Plain City. 
Bill continues to serve Marysville in many 
ways, including as a member of the G.L. 
Kingsmore Scholarship Committee. He is 
proud to be a 33rd degree Mason. 
Madam Speaker, selection for the Central 
Ohio Senior Citizens Hall of Fame is a high 
honor accorded to seniors who have devoted 
their lives to serving others. I am pleased to 
join in the accolades for Bill McCarthy on his 
induction and thank the Central Ohio Area 
Agency on Aging for recognizing his many 
sacrifices—and those of all of this year’s in-
ductees.

ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE LATINO CENTER 
ON AGING 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the 30th anniversary of the Latino 
Center on Aging (LCA). LCA was founded in 
1991 and for decades has been a champion 
of advocating on behalf of Latino senior citi-
zens by advancing and improving their quality 
of life. The center has been able to support 
and assist many members of Florida’s 26th 
congressional district and beyond. 
The Latino Center on Aging has success-
fully been able to carry out its mission through 
various avenues such as media engagement, 
testimony at public hearings, and conferences 
that directly address the problems Latino sen-
ior citizens are faced with. 
Additionally, LCA has implemented a weekly 
radio show titled Para Mayores that has been 
broadcasted for the last three years. During 
the 
COVID–19 
quarantine 
period, 
Para 
Mayores contributed to the lives of many sen-
iors by providing them with timely and valu-
able information. This has become of signifi-
cant importance as many times, language and 
cultural barriers impede seniors’ ability to ef-
fectively obtain the necessary assistance they 
require. 
As South Florida continues to see an ex-
pansion of Hispanic elderly residents in the re-
gion, now more than ever are LCA’s contribu-
tions and mission critical to the surrounding 
community. I congratulate the Latino Center 
on Aging on their 30 years of community and 
contribution. I look forward to their continued 
success and prosperity in the future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1056 
October 1, 2021 
the United States in recognizing the month of 
October as Hindu heritage month. The 8th 
Congressional District is home to many fol-
lowers of this uniquely pluralistic religion, and 
I wish to celebrate the Hindu community’s val-
uable contributions to my district and to our 
state and country. I believe this acknowledg-
ment is especially timely, given the disturbing 
rise of prejudice and racism in this country, in-
cluding Hinduphobia as manifested in hateful 
speech and violent acts perpetrated against 
Indian-Americans and Hindu houses of wor-
ship. 
The Hindu religion dates back millennia and 
has profoundly influenced both ancient and 
modern cultures. Its message of religious tol-
erance, non-violence, and the universality of 
the human experience was introduced to this 
country in 1893 by Swami Vivekananda in his 
landmark address at the World Parliament of 
Religions 
in 
Chicago, 
Illinois. 
Swami 
Vivekananda’s words of peace and his em-
phasis on self-perfection and service to others 
sparked interest in the Hindu faith and contrib-
uted to the growth of Hinduism in the United 
States. His spiritual understanding had a pro-
found influence on one of the greatest leaders 
of the 20th century, Mahatma Gandhi, who in 
turn inspired the important work of one of our 
nation’s most revered leaders, Martin Luther 
King, Jr., to advance the cause of civil rights 
in the United States. 
The Hindu faithful in our country include 
physicians, lawyers, scientists, economists, 
philosophers, artists, academics, business 
leaders, government officials—and Members 
of Congress. They are guided by Swami 
Vivekananda’s call to service and respect for 
all religions and all people. Madam Speaker, I 
know all Americans of goodwill share these 
beliefs, and today I would like to celebrate the 
work of the Hindu faithful in building bridges of 
understanding between all Americans, for their 
important contributions to our economy and 
our cultural and civic life, and for the part they 
play in creating our wonderful and distinctively 
diverse American experience.

HONORING SOROPTIMIST 
INTERNATIONAL CENTENNIAL 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with the honorable Congresswoman 
JACKIE SPEIER, Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO, 
and Congressman MIKE THOMPSON in celebra-
tion of Soroptimist International reaching its 
centennial on October 1, 2021. A global volun-
teer movement with over 72,000 members in 
121 countries, Soroptimist, later named Sorop-
timist International, was established to advo-
cate for gender equality and human rights, a 
mission that it has stayed true to this day. 
Founded in 1921 when women were still not 
permitted to join service organizations, Sorop-
timist began as an 80–member club in Oak-
land, California with a vision for a world where 
women and girls were provided the resources 
and support to achieve their individual and col-
lective potential. The club’s first project was 
Save the Redwoods, confronting logging com-
panies, lobbying the legislature, and rallying 
public support to designate a portion of the 
forest as protected land, which remains today. 
Within 5 years, the organization, renamed 
Soroptimist International, grew to 15 clubs 
throughout the United States. In 1924, the first 
Soroptimist club in Europe was founded in 
Paris and fueled the establishment of clubs 
throughout the continent. Several federations 
were established across the globe from Aus-
tralia to Africa, leading projects to support ref-
ugees, secure housing for the impoverished, 
assist individuals with disabilities, and provide 
vocational training for women and girls. Unit-
ing these federations, Soroptimist International 
Association was awarded consultative status 
in 1950 by the United Nations Economic and 
Social Counsel, an honor reserved for about 
3,000 non-governmental organizations world-
wide. UNICEF also granted the organization 
consultative status for service projects assist-
ing children in 1966. 
Today, Soroptimist International includes 5 
federations worldwide: Africa, the Americas, 
Europe, Great Britain and Ireland, and the 
South West Pacific. Their current priorities to-
wards achieving gender equity include strate-
gically addressing child marriage, female gen-
ital mutilation, domestic violence, rights of 
older women, migration, and human traf-
ficking. 
Madam Speaker, Soroptimist International 
has continued to be an innovative leader in 
promoting human rights and gender equity 
worldwide. Through the unwavering dedication 
of its many members and its continually grow-
ing network, the organization has never lost 
sight of its original purpose to educate, em-
power, and transform the lives of women and 
girls across the globe. Therefore, please join 
me in congratulating Soroptimist International 
for a century of inspiring work, and in wishing 
them many more years of success.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JON 
PRATT, 
EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR 
OF THE MINNESOTA COUNCIL OF 
NONPROFITS 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished career of Jon 
Pratt on the occasion of his retirement as Ex-
ecutive Director of the Minnesota Council of 
Nonprofits. During his more than three dec-
ades of nonprofit advocacy work and leader-
ship, Jon has made an enduring impact for 
residents of Minnesota and has uplifted the 
important and necessary work of nonprofit or-
ganizations across the country. As founder of 
Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, one of the 
largest statewide nonprofit associations in the 
country, Jon created a space to meet the 
needs of Minnesotans through the growing 
nonprofit sector—a space which today serves 
over 2,200 member organizations across the 
state. 
A lifelong Minnesotan, Jon began his career 
as a lawyer in 1977, and in the following dec-
ade gained valuable experience through sev-
eral different jobs. He first organized a state-
wide lobbying program during his time at Min-
nesota Public Interest Research Group and 
traveled the Midwest while learning the ins 
and outs of foundation work as the regional 
field director for The Youth Project, a founda-
tion providing grants and assistance to grass 
roots community organizations. And as cam-
paign manager for future U.S. Senator Paul 
Wellstone’s bid for state auditor, he learned 
how critical it is to engage government to 
serve all Minnesotans. He then served as ex-
ecutive director of The Philanthropy Project 
where he led a coalition advocating for an in-
crease in philanthropy efforts that benefited 
disadvantaged people across the state of Min-
nesota. 
It was these diverse experiences that led 
Jon to convene a group of local leaders of 
nonprofit organizations to establish the Min-
nesota Council of Nonprofits (MCN) in 1987. 
Only the third such trade association of its 
kind in the United States, MCN was launched 
to fill the increasing needs of nonprofits 
throughout the state, with the core belief that 
sharing information and working together 
across areas of common interest will be mutu-
ally beneficial and uplift the nonprofit sector as 
a whole. Today, MCN hosts classes and net-
working opportunities for both new and estab-
lished organizations, helps groups secure 
grants and other funding, facilitates a jobs 
board to connect employers with those seek-
ing a job in the sector, and advocates for pub-
lic policy changes at every level of govern-
ment. 
During his time with MCN, Jon was funda-
mental in helping elevate the status of Min-
nesota’s 
nonprofit 
sector 
by 
establishing 
standards of excellence for nonprofits, co-
developing Grant Advisor—a rating tool for 
those seeking grants that provides free and 
honest feedback about the grant process, cre-
ating training programs and materials to 
strengthen the service work of organizations, 
and conducting years of research on the non-
profit sector to promote transparency and 
positive change in the field. 
I am grateful to have worked with Jon for 
many years on key state and federal policy 
issues as he led the way in advocacy work on 
behalf of the Minnesota nonprofit community. 
MCN was the largest employer group to sup-
port raising the state’s minimum wage, they 
worked with the Minnesota Legislature to se-
cure a non-itemizer charitable tax deduction, 
and through MCN’s Minnesota Budget Project, 
led the charge to expand Minnesota’s working 
family tax credit. Jon’s advocacy also spreads 
beyond the immediate needs of the nonprofit 
world as he has been a constant voice for 
public good by opposing state voter ID bills 
and supporting human rights and equitable so-
cial programs. 
Jon has truly been a champion for non-
profits across the Nation and while his tremen-
dous leadership at Minnesota Council of Non-
profits will be missed by many, his lasting con-
tributions are sure to inspire the leaders and 
public servants of the future. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in honoring the exceptional ca-
reer of Mr. Jon Pratt.

was a fearless champion for LGBTQ+ causes 
and fought tirelessly to bring us one step clos-
er to eradicating HIV. Today, Arizona is a bet-
ter and brighter place for his presence among 
us. 
A New Jersey native, Richard had a pro-
found love for Arizona. Put best by Richard 
himself, ‘‘I will retire here someday.’’ After 
moving to the Grand Canyon state, Richard 
immediately rooted himself firmly giving all his 
time, heart, and soul to the betterment of our 
community. Casa Ben Dita—his beloved 
McCormick Ranch home—became a gathering 
place for some of the premiere LGBTQ+ orga-
nizations in Phoenix—particularly Lambda 
Legal, the oldest national legal organization 
dedicated to working for the civil rights of the 
LGBTQ+ community. Year after year, Richard 
inspired so many and had a unique sense of 
bringing people together for the common 
good. 
When Aunt Rita’s Foundation brought the 
AIDS Walk back to Phoenix, Richard was one 
of the first to jump in and support its success. 
He also was relentlessly active in Aunt Rita’s 
Red Brunch to celebrate World AIDS Day and 
joined the Foundation’s Red Purse Club, gen-
erously donating his time, talents, and treas-
ure year after year. 
His commitment to LGBTQ+ rights and the 
eradication of HIV extended beyond excel-
lence in service and volunteerism. Together, 
with community partners, Richard helped form 
permanent financial legacies for the Southwest 
Center for HIV/AIDs. His generosity trans-
formed the Southwest Center from a small or-
ganization to a thriving pillar of our community. 
Richard showed that by giving, anyone and 
everyone can change the world. 
Today, the Southwest Center for HIV/AIDs 
is known as Arizona’s premiere leader for fi-
nancially 
accessible, 
culturally 
competent, 
LGBTQ+ friendly healthcare. For his lifetime 
achievement, he received the Southwest Cen-
ter Philanthropist Lifetime Legacy Award and 
was named a Partner for Life. In his honor, 
the Center named its clinical trials division the 
‘‘Richard P. Stahl Research Wing’’. 
As we reflect how long we have come in the 
work to eradicate HIV, there is no doubt our 
progress was shaped by Richard Stahl. Ari-
zona owes him a debt of gratitude, and he will 
be deeply missed by his friends, family, and 
all those he uplifted with his positivity and un-
wavering support. 
Madam Speaker, in this spirit of remem-
brance, I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Richard Stahl. I thank Richard, and Godspeed.

who through their tireless dedication, have 
shattered glass ceilings and touched the lives 
of countless individuals around the world. For 
my part, I remain committed to defending reli-

of the struggle. ‘‘Daddy’s house was bombed, 
then in Louisville, Kentucky his church office 
was bombed. I was also jailed during the open

America.’’ Through her partnership with her 
husband, Dr. James Dobson, in ‘‘Focus on the 
Family’’ and ‘‘Family Talk’’ broadcasts, millions 
of families have received the support and en-
couragement they need to navigate their daily 
lives. Under her leadership and strong faith, 
the U.S. National Day of Prayer enjoyed mas-
sive growth. Millions of Americans now take 
their responsibility seriously to pray for govern-
ment leaders. 
Madam Speaker, I hope these women know 
full well the impact they have had on count-
less lives. These women are trailblazers, and 
the example they have set will be followed by 
people of my district, and many other Ameri-
cans, for years to come. I thank each of them 
for their passion and commitment. This honor 
is well-deserved.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1058 
October 1, 2021 
On July 27, 1846, residents of Providence 
village gathered to discuss building a meeting 
house. A vote determined that the meeting 
house would be governed by the. Pres-
byterians. On October 5, 1846, the First Pres-
byterian Church of Providence, Pennsylvania 
was organized. The first church building was 
built on the corner of Church Avenue and Oak 
Street, and the first meeting of the congrega-
tion took place on April 19, 1847. The house 
was dedicated on July 25, 1849 with Rev. Jo-
seph Barlow as the first pastor. In 1862, a par-
sonage was added to the grounds, and a lec-
ture and bible classroom was added to the 
church building in 1869. 
In 1882, the congregation purchased land to 
build a new house of worship. They sold the 
parsonage to fund the cost of the new church 
in 1884, and in 1886, the beautiful stone 
church was completed and dedicated. 
The faithful gathered and worshiped at 2020 
North Main Avenue for almost a century. In 
1971, the Providence Presbyterian Church 
merged 
with 
the 
Suburban 
Presbyterian 
Church to form the Providence United Pres-
byterian Church (PUPC). The congregations 
joined together to bear witness to their faith 
and serve their community. 
The PUPC has been a pillar of the strong 
and supportive faith community of the City of 
Scranton for nearly two centuries. When the 
Concord United Church of Christ closed its 
doors, the PUPC welcomed its members into 
their fold. From 2004 to 2008, the PUPC 
shared worship and gathering spaces with 
many area churches, such as Marywood Uni-
versity, Covenant Presbyterian Church, the 
Presbyterian Church of Dunmore, Immanuel 
Lutheran Church, and Throop United Meth-
odist Church. In 2008, the PUPC dedicated its 
new church building at 1145 Providence Road 
in Scranton. 
Today, PUPC continues to grow and thrive. 
The church welcomes the faithful of the City of 
Scranton to practice their faith, fostering com-
munity and fellowship within the congregation. 
I am honored to join with the congregation 
of the Providence United Presbyterian Church 
to celebrate 175 years of worship and commu-
nity and the essential role it has played in the 
growth of Presbyterianism in Scranton. May 
PUPC continue to be a mainstay in the Scran-
ton faith community and provide a safe and 
welcoming place to worship for generations to 
come.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF ELSA FORTH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Elsa Forth of Taylor, 
Michigan on her 100th birthday. Her life of 
courage and strength is worthy of recognition. 
Mrs. Forth was born in the city of Belluno, 
Italy on October 1, 1921, the second of twins, 
to Andreas and Maria Da Rin. She spent sum-
mers in the village of Laggio di Cadore with 
her sister Antonietta and brother Alvio. She 
was educated at the Vatican at the sponsor-
ship of Father Albino Luciani—later Pope John 
Paul I. Her hometown became a battlefield 
during World War II and Mrs. Forth played a 
major role in the operations of the Partisans 
who fought alongside the allied forces against 
the fascist Mussolini and Nazi Germany. Her 
actions branded her a hero to those who know 
her legacy in Belluno. She left her home after 
being proposed to by a man with American 
citizenship and moved to Melvindale, Michi-
gan. 
After taking time to learn to speak English, 
she started working as a waitress at The Ve-
netian Inn in downriver. In good company with 
the Italian family who owned the bar, they 
called her their ‘‘Italian Hero.’’ She was quick 
to make friends and was well beloved in her 
new home. Tragically, she came home one 
night to a drunken, jealous husband and came 
face to face with a shotgun. She managed to 
escape down the stairs of their small apart-
ment but was hit in her face and upper chest. 
She escaped bullets in Italy only to fall victim 
to gunshots in America. 
Luckily, Mrs. Forth was able to get an ex-
perimental plastic surgery and was able to 
heal quickly. Soon after, she met Raymond 
Forth and they wed. Together they have one 
son, Tony ‘‘Tone’’. She was able to find work 
in a technical industrial role where she re-
mained until her retirement at age 70. When 
Tony joined the Marines, Mr. and Mrs. Forth 
moved to a home in Taylor, Michigan. Today, 
they live together in the renovate family home, 
along with Tony’s wife, Antonette. Mr. Ray-
mond Forth passed away in 1983 Tony strug-
gles to keep up with his mother who remains 
full of life, even at age 100. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Mrs. Elsa Forth on her 
100th birthday. Her story is one that inspires 
all who hear it. I join with her family and 
friends in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day. I am proud 
to honor her life, her accomplishments, and 
her invaluable contributions to our community 
here at home and abroad.

WISHING KATHY CALDWELL, A 
HAPPY RETIREMENT 
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate and wish a happy re-
tirement to Kathy Caldwell, CEO of Legacy 
Community Health Centers. 
Our Houston community thanks Kathy for 
her hard work and for her remarkable leader-
ship at Legacy and in our community at large. 
Under her leadership, Legacy has expanded 
exponentially. 
What started as a small neighborhood clinic 
has become a large organization employing 
thousands of Texans serving Houston dili-
gently. 
Our community will miss her. 
We are certainly inspired by her work and 
thank her for what Legacy will continue to do 
for Houston. 
This work has been particularly important for 
low-income communities and communities of 
color, including Latinos, which have been dis-
proportionately affected by the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
We wish her the best on her next steps. 
I congratulate her on her retirement and 
God bless. 
RECOGNIZING THE SIXTIETH ANNI-
VERSARY OF JOHNSON ESTATE 
WINERY 
IN 
WESTFIELD, 
NEW 
YORK 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 30, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the sixtieth anniversary of Johnson 
Estate Winery in Westfield, New York and 
congratulate the Johnson family for reaching 
this tremendous milestone. 
Three generations of Johnsons have farmed 
what is now Johnson Estate Winery. After im-
migrating to Canada and attending Cornell 
University, Frederick Johnson purchased a 
circa-1822 home and farm along the banks of 
Freelings Creek in Westfield, New York. He 
planted various fruits like apples, peaches, 
and concord vineyards, and named the farm 
Sunnyslope Fruit Farm. He worked as an en-
tomologist with the Department of Agriculture 
in Washington, D.C. and North East, Pennsyl-
vania, met his wife, and raised his family. 
His son Frederick Spencer Johnson grew up 
on the farm, served in World War II as a naval 
aviator, graduated from Cornell, and raised his 
family overseas while working for Nelson 
Rockefeller’s various agricultural endeavors. 
He returned to the farm in 1960, after his fa-
ther died, and removed the aging fruit or-
chards before being the first Western New 
York Farmer to plant French hybrid grapes. 
His favorite hybrid, Chancellor, is in the 
winery’s famous Founder’s Red. In 1961, he 
opened the Johnson Estate Winery. 
Frederick Spencer’s children inherited the 
farm in 1998 and grew the winery with new 
vineyards, construction of a finished goods 
warehouse, and the introduction of new wines 
like fruit, sparkling, and ice wines. In 2010, 
Frederick Johnson, Jr. became the owner of 
the farm and winery with his wife, Jennifer. 
They renovated the century-old tasting room in 
2011 and still live in the two-hundred-year-old 
farmhouse. This year, they opened an outdoor 
wine and food pairing location, Flight, as a 
nod to Fred Sr.’s service as a naval aviator 
and the love of aviation he shared with his 
son, Fred Jr. Guests enjoy sights and smells 
of harvest while savoring delicious wine and 
locally-sourced fruits, curated cheeses, and 
charcuterie boards. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
recognize the sixtieth anniversary of Johnson 
Estate Winery in Westfield, New York. Con-
gratulations on this tremendous milestone.

Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today

ever since. On several occasions, Blake’s con-
dition worsened, and his family feared that 
they might be losing him. After countless sur-
geries, transfusions, needles, surviving being 
on a ventilator, kidney dialysis, and three 
failed stem cell transplants, his fight with leu-
kemia has now come to an end and Blake 
was recently put into hospice care. 
Blake’s family describes him a boy with a 
zest for life who makes an impact on anyone 
he comes in contact with. Despite a taxing 
fight against leukemia, he always has the en-
ergy to stick up for the underdog—a lesson 
we can all learn from. 
On October 14, Blake will turn seven years 
old having experienced more challenges than 
most people will over the course of their entire 
lives. We can all learn from Blake’s bravery 
and strength, and I am honored to represent 
him and his family as part of the 11th Con-
gressional District of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating Blake on his seventh birth-
day and in honoring his courage, persever-
ance, and spirit.
