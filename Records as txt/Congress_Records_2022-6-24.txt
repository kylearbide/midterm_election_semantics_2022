Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JUNE 24, 2022 
No. 108 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was

DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
June 24, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable LUCY 
MCBATH to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, You created the world 
and called it good—and it was good. As 
we acknowledge that our heritage is 
deeply rooted in the first human 
beings, we ask Your forgiveness. For 
like them, we have dared to challenge 
Your supreme authority in favor of our 
own will. 
Like Cain who murdered Abel with 
his hands because his heart had turned 
from You, even today our wills are set 
on our position, our power, and our 
pride. We weaponize the things at our 
hands and fail to humble our hearts to 
accept Your peaceful design for com-
munity. 
Turn our wills, O God, from evil. 
Speak into our souls and save us from 
ourselves. For from the beginning of 
time we have been the obstacles to 
peace and justice. From the smallest 
infraction against a colleague to the 
vengeance we call down on our en-
emies, we have been and remain re-
sponsible for the roadblocks to rec-
onciliation. 
God, grant us Your wisdom to live 
the righteous life You intended for our 
first ancestors. May Your divine in-
sight make our hearts pure, peace-lov-
ing, considerate, full of mercy, impar-
tial, and sincere. 
Then may our deeds henceforth be 
borne in the humanity that comes from 
Your eternal and gracious plan. 
In Your merciful name we pray, and 
by Your grace we live. 
Amen.

ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN) come forward and lead the House 
in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. DEAN led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

CONGRATULATING RAYMOND 
JADCZAK 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Raymond 
Jadczak, owner of PJ Auto Repair in 
Horsham, Pennsylvania, who is retir-
ing on July 9. 
This year marks the 50th anniversary 
of PJ Auto Repair, a family-owned 
business led by Ray and his son, Sam-
uel Jadczak. 
Born 
and 
raised 
in 
Jenkintown, 
Pennsylvania, and graduating from my 
alma mater, too, Abington High School 
in 1968, Raymond grew up in a me-
chanically-inclined 
household, 
often 
working on cars as a teenager with his 
late father, John. 
After high school, he turned his pas-
sion into a lifelong career. At just 22, 
Ray opened an ARCO gas and repair 
service business. He was one of the 
youngest 
ARCO 
franchises 
in 
the 
Philadelphia region. 
In 1982, Ray was recognized by the 
National 
Institute 
for 
Automotive 
Service Excellence as Mechanic of the 
Year. 
For five decades, PJ Auto Repair has 
helped thousands, while creating jobs 
in our district. 
As he prepares to hand off his busi-
ness to his son, Sam, I rise to con-
gratulate Raymond on a long and dis-
tinguished career of serving our com-
munity. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MASHAMA BAILEY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
rise 
today 
to 
honor 
Mashama Bailey for her achievement 
of receiving the prestigious James 
Beard Award for Outstanding Chef. 
Mashama is a renowned chef at The 
Grey in Savannah, Georgia, where she 
has served Southern cuisine since 2014. 
She 
traveled 
to 
many 
locations 
around the world, perfecting her cul-
inary craft, and uses what she has 
learned to showcase the amazing taste 
of Southern cuisine. 
The James Beard Award was estab-
lished to highlight the exceptional tal-
ent and achievements in the culinary

arts. Mashama also received the James 
Beard Award for Best Chef: Southeast 
back in 2019. 
Throughout her career, she has taken 
the fine dining world by storm through 
her exceptional dishes that have helped 
put Savannah among some of the best 
culinary spots in the Nation. 
Mashama’s commitment to her pas-
sion has fed many Savannahians some 
of the best food in the world, and she is 
an inspiration to the First Congres-
sional District. 
Congratulations, Mashama, and good 
luck in your future endeavors. 
f 
CRACKING DOWN ON UNFAIR 
SHIPPING FEES 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, supply chain disruptions caused by 
the pandemic have contributed to ris-
ing prices across America. These dis-
ruptions included considerable conges-
tion at our ports last year. 
In this void, the Port of Cleveland in 
my district, increased its tonnage by 
nearly 70 percent, helping to keep 
goods moving across America and be-
yond. 
Yet, even as congestion has eased, 
international shipping companies have 
been charging extremely high fees to 
transport goods. 
This is driving up costs on store 
shelves and hurting our small busi-
nesses while leaving key products wait-
ing on our docks. 
Last week, the House passed, and 
President Biden signed into law the bi-
partisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act. 
The law cracks down on these unfair 
shipping fees. 
This will help goods get in and out of 
docks like the Port of Cleveland 
quicker, it will reduce costs for fami-
lies, and it will level the playing field 
for our businesses. I call that a win- 
win. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DR. DAVIE JANE 
GILMOUR 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, after 
nearly 25 years of service as President 
of the Pennsylvania College of Tech-
nology, Dr. Davie Jane Gilmour is re-
tiring. 
During her accomplished tenure, Dr. 
Gilmour 
has 
guided 
Penn 
College 
through challenges, growth, and inno-
vation, ultimately shaping the institu-
tion into a national leader in applied 
technology education. 
Penn College has stepped up in a big 
way to develop Pennsylvania’s work-
force and close the skills gap, largely 
due to Dr. Gilmour’s vision and com-
mitment to giving students the tools 
to excel in high demand fields. 
Dr. Gilmour and I share that vision, 
and I have enjoyed working with Penn 
College in Congress to develop policies 
that bring job creators and the work-
force closer together, expand opportu-
nities for career and technical edu-
cation, 
promote 
economic 
develop-
ment, and spur job creation. 
I thank Dr. Gilmour for her service, 
vision, and tireless commitment to 
Penn College’s important mission. I 
wish Dr. Gilmour all the best in her fu-
ture endeavors. 
f 
BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to applaud President 
Biden and House Democrats’ efforts to 
lower the cost of goods for hard-
working American families. 
As we have seen, war criminal Putin 
has caused price hikes by way of his 
cruel war on Ukraine. As a result, 
Americans are seeing rising costs at 
the gas pump and the grocery stores 
and across the shelves of stores. 
While extreme MAGA Republicans 
have chosen to play the blame game, 
President Biden and House Democrats 
have decided to take action. Together, 
we are delivering results. 
We have passed key bills like the 
Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, which 
will strengthen supply chains and 
produce cleaner and cheaper gas. This 
will lead to lower prices. 
You see, Democrats are laser focused 
on lowering costs for hardworking fam-
ilies, not helping greedy billionaires 
and greedy companies. Together, we 
will continue building a better Amer-
ica. 
f 
PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL 
FREEDOMS 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, as a strong advocate and 
fighter for the Second Amendment, I 
cannot support the Senate’s gun con-
trol bill. 
The legislation is simply another at-
tempt to blame law-abiding gun owners 
instead of holding accountable the dis-
turbed criminals who are carrying out 
despicable acts of violence. 
The gun control bill would strength-
en red flag laws, which take away indi-
viduals’ due process rights, while al-
lowing law enforcement to remove 
guns from individuals at the request of 
an expansive list of acquaintances. 
In America, a person is innocent 
until proven guilty. But liberal Demo-
crats, they don’t see it quite that way. 
The presumption of innocence—the 
foundation of our criminal justice sys-
tem—apparently does not apply to law- 
abiding gun owners in the world of the 
Democrats’ vision. 
I will fight tooth and nail to protect 
families from Washington Democrats’ 
relentless attacks on our freedom and 
way of life. 
f 
MCGOVERN-DOLE 
INTERNATIONAL 
FOOD 
FOR 
EDUCATION 
AND 
CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAM 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the George 
McGovern-Robert Dole International 
Food for Education and Child Nutrition 
Program. 
Twenty years ago, Congress estab-
lished McGovern-Dole as a permanent 
program under USDA in the 2002 farm 
bill. McGovern-Dole provides at least 
one nutritious school meal to some of 
the world’s most vulnerable children. 
It is a life-changing program that has 
improved the food security, nutrition, 
literacy, and education of 31 million 
children, their families, and commu-
nities—building goodwill toward the 
American people in over 48 countries. 
With the support of American farm-
ers, ranchers, and millers, McGovern- 
Dole programs are carried out by 
NGOs, the U.N. World Food Pro-
gramme, local partners with U.S. fi-
nancial and technical assistance, and 
U.S. and locally purchased food com-
modities. 
Congressman TRACEY
MANN
and I 
have introduced H. Res. 1156 to con-
tinue the McGovern-Dole program and 
build upon its 20 years of success. I in-
vite all of my colleagues to cosponsor 
and support this resolution. 
f 
INFLATION 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, Federal 
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has con-
firmed what we knew all along: Infla-
tion isn’t because of Putin’s disgraceful 
invasion of Ukraine. It is because of 
President Biden’s and congressional 
Democrats’ reckless spending. 
Earlier this week, during a Senate 
Banking Committee hearing, my friend 
and fellow Tennessean, Senator BILL 
HAGERTY, pointed out that inflation 
had already risen to 7 percent well be-
fore the war in Ukraine. 
He asked Chair Powell if the war in 
Ukraine is the primary driver of infla-
tion. Chair Powell responded, ‘‘No. In-
flation was high before, certainly be-
fore the war in Ukraine broke out.’’ 
This isn’t a Putin price hike, it is 
Bidenflation, and the Biden adminis-
tration and congressional Democrats 
and their allies in the mainstream 
media need to stop with the misdirec-
tion and misleading excuses. Thank-
fully, Tennesseans are smart and can 
recognize the difference. 
Taking responsibility for mistakes 
followed by straight talk are necessary 
prerequisites for getting us out of this

f 
STOPPING HUNGER IN AMERICA 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
our children are hungry, and I rise to 
support hungry children and to end 
their hunger. 
I rise to support the Keep Kids Fed 
Act of 2022. One in every seven house-
holds with children struggle to get 
enough food on the table. 
Just weeks into our pandemic, which 
still continues, one in every three 
households with children, nearly half 
of all mothers, struggle to feed our 
children. 
It is crucial that we take emergency 
action to immediately stop the hunger 
in this Nation, and certainly, we 
should look around the world, as well. 
Congress must extend key flexibili-
ties, and so this legislation provides 
nationwide waiver authority, allows 
waivers related to the summer food 
program. 
In my district, all of the school dis-
tricts have children that are in need of 
food: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Stop 
hungry children from suffering and 
pass this legislation and end hunger for 
children as we know it. 
The work must continue. Hungry 
children cannot be what America is de-
fined as, and they must be safe. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in stopping 
hunger in America in our children and 
families.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
LAURA MULLIGAN THOMAS 
(Mr. GOOD of Virginia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Laura 
Mulligan Thomas. 
On May 18, 2022, Laura Mulligan 
Thomas, alongside her students, pre-
sented her final concert as director of 
the Charlottesville High School orches-
tra. 
After a 40-year career at Charlottes-
ville High School, Ms. Thomas will 
begin her retirement on June 30, 2022. 
She began in 1982 with a group of just 
eight CHS students as part of the CHS 
orchestra. Now that orchestra includes 
over 100 students and is internationally 
recognized. 
Ms. Thomas has received a number of 
awards, including winning the 2022 
American String Teachers Associa-
tion’s Elizabeth A. H. Green School Ed-
ucator Award. Beyond the accolades 
she has received, I specifically want to 
thank her for her commitment to sup-
porting the students of Charlottesville 
High School. 
Perhaps the greatest testament to 
Ms. Thomas’ work is knowing that 
many of her students have gone on to 
become music teachers just like her. 
I thank Laura Mulligan Thomas for 
her dedication to Charlottesville High 
School and her community. I wish her 
the best in her retirement.

woman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all

bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
earlier today, the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 1204, for two measures. 
First, it provides for consideration of 
the Senate amendments to the House 
amendment to S. 2938, the Bipartisan 
Safer 
Communities 
Act. 
The 
rule 
makes in order a motion offered by the 
chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary that the House concur in the Sen-
ate amendments. It provides 1 hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Second, the rule provides for consid-
eration of the Senate amendment to 
the House amendment to S. 2089, the 
Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022. The rule 
makes in order a motion offered by the 
chair of the Committee on Education 
and Labor that the House concur in the 
Senate amendment and provides 10 
minutes of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Finally, the rule deems passage of H. 
Res. 1132 and deems that the House 
concur in the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 4346 with an amendment. 
Madam Speaker, let me first say that 
I am so disappointed with where this 
school meals extension landed. We had 
a bipartisan, bicameral agreement in 
place, a measure that, in my opinion, 
didn’t go far enough. But I was willing 
to support it because we have a hunger 
cliff looming in 6 days. 
It passed the House yesterday by a 
vote of 376–42. Then, one Senator de-
cided to hold up the bill, a bill to give 
kids free meals over the summer and 
provide administrative flexibilities and 
extra funding to schools in the fall. 
The objection? A provision that gave 
free meals at school for kids at 185 per-
cent of poverty or below. For a family 
of four, that is a family with a max-
imum total household income of just 
over $50,000 a year. 
What a rotten thing to do. I can’t say 
the words I would like to use on the 
House floor to describe just how cal-
lous this is, so let me just say this: It 
takes a real jerk to take food out of 
the mouths of kids. 
I am going to support this bill. The 
stakes are too high for us not to sup-
port it, and there are a lot of good pro-
visions in here, provisions that extend 
the flexibilities and provide a reim-
bursement rate increase to schools to 
help them continue serving kids nutri-
tious meals and extend universal free 
meals over the summer. 
But I am going to continue fighting 
like hell at every chance to make sure 
that every child gets a free breakfast 
and lunch as part of their school day. 
Food is a right. I believe it is a fun-
damental human right. And for kids 
living in poverty, school meals are 
sometimes the only nutritious food 
that they have access to. 
I thank my friends, Chairman SCOTT 
and Chairwoman STABENOW, for their 
work in averting the hunger cliff and 
getting free meals to kids this summer. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for her incred-
ible leadership. I thank Chairwoman 
ROSA DELAURO for her persistence on 
this. 
They are all dedicated to ending hun-
ger, especially among children. I am 
going to continue to work with them 
until we finally end hunger in this 
country once and for all. 
In addition, Madam Speaker, let me 
just say that this is a historic moment. 
We are on the threshold of passing the 
first major overhaul of Federal gun 
safety legislation in decades. This bill 
that we will soon vote on will save 
lives, and it couldn’t come at a more 
important time. 
As the American people are demand-
ing that we do more to prevent gun vi-
olence, the Supreme Court is reck-
lessly striking down gun safety laws 
that have been on the books for over a 
century. 
As the American people look to Con-
gress to take action to prevent the 
next mass shooting, House Republican 
leaders are caving to the gun lobby, 
whipping against a bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement of commonsense 
gun safety measures that an over-
whelming majority of the American 
people support. 
Despite what you will hear on the 
floor today, the American people get it. 
They know the terrible toll gun vio-
lence has taken on communities all 
across this country: over 100 per day 
killed by guns; more children killed 
with a gun in the last two decades than 
on-duty police officers and Active-Duty 
military combined; the list of mass 
shootings and tragedies grows longer 
and longer by the month. 
Yet, if you talk to Republicans here 
in the House, you would think we are 
living in an alternative universe. Just 
this week, most Republicans voted 
down a bill to alert people when a mass 
shooting was happening near them. Let 
me repeat that: Just this week, Repub-
licans voted down a bill to alert people 
when a mass shooting was happening 
near them. 
Are you kidding me? What kind of 
people don’t even want you to know 
which way to run if there is a shooting 
nearby? 
I am so sick and tired of the strangle-
hold that the gun lobby and their blood 
money have on the Republican Party. 
Enough is enough. The time has come 
for action. The time has come for us to 
put aside politics and actually do the 
right thing. 
I commend the many Republicans 
who have done just that. I don’t think 
I could agree with Senator MITCH 
MCCONNELL on where to go to have 
lunch, but he said that the Safer Com-
munities Act is ‘‘a commonsense pack-
age of popular steps that will help 
make these horrifying incidents less 
likely while fully upholding the Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens.’’ That is MITCH MCCONNELL. 
Senator LINDSEY
GRAHAM—and we 
are polar opposites—said: ‘‘The legisla-
tion is not perfect, but we must not let 
the perfect become the enemy of the 
good.’’ That is LINDSEY GRAHAM. 
Even here in the House, some coura-
geous Republicans have said that they 
will support this bill, like Congressman 
TONY GONZALES, who said: ‘‘It is my 
duty to pass laws that never infringe 
on the Constitution while protecting 
the lives of the innocent.’’ 
The U.S. Senate is notorious for not 
being able to build consensus around 
solutions to fix the most straight-
forward of problems, yet here they 
have come up with a reasonable, bipar-
tisan deal on a contentious issue. 
I think it is shameful, quite frankly, 
that GOP Leader MCCARTHY and his 
team are parroting the gun lobby’s 
talking points. But what I find even 
more disappointing, frankly, are the 
crocodile tears about bipartisanship 
from the GOP when they vote time and 
time again against substantial bipar-
tisan deals like this one. 
Please spare us the lectures. Nothing 
in this bill is new. Nothing in this bill 
is controversial. These ideas have been 
around for decades, and they are what 
the American people want. 
If people are worried about backlash 
back home, this is an opportunity for 
you to correct the record. Go home and 
tell the truth that this bill does noth-
ing to infringe on the Second Amend-
ment, and it doesn’t punish law-abiding 
gun owners. 
b 0930 
This country is crying out for action. 
Americans are begging us to work to-
gether to protect our kids and our com-
munities. 
I know I am asking you to vote 
against your party’s leadership. I know 
that is a tough spot to put some of my 
Republican friends in. But I think at 
the end of the day, you owe it to your-
self to consider this one idea: What if 
this bill stops even one mass shooting 
from happening? Is a ‘‘no’’ vote worth 
the lives of your constituents? 
Don’t listen to those who are spread-
ing crazy conspiracy theories, saying 
that this is going to lead to everyone’s 
guns getting taken away. We hear it 
over and over and over again. Listen to 
your GOP colleagues who helped write 
this bill and who passed it over in the 
Senate. Listen to the American people 
who overwhelmingly support this bill, 
and then listen to your conscience.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5885 
June 24, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank the Representative from 
Massachusetts and the distinguished 
chair of the Rules Committee for yield-
ing me the customary 30 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, S. 2938, as amended 
in the Senate, is at its core an effort to 
chip away at the Second Amendment 
rights of law-abiding citizens. It has re-
ceived no hearings, no committee proc-
ess, and has only recently been re-
leased in bill form for the public to re-
view. It came to us very early this 
morning after the Senate passed it late 
last night, and my colleagues expect us 
to vote on this bill later today, despite 
the egregious procedural violations. 
Unfortunately for the American people, 
that is not a unique development here 
in Congress. I am disappointed that 
this is the way the majority has chosen 
to proceed with legislation, with no 
hearing and no public input. 
The bill provides $750 million over 5 
years in Federal Byrne JAG grant 
funding to States for crisis interven-
tion proceedings, including State-level 
red flag programs. However, this bill 
fails to provide explicit due process re-
quirements. We have seen in places 
where red flag laws have been adopted 
that these types of laws always in-
fringe on the constitutional rights of 
law-abiding gun owners. This ambig-
uous language contains insufficient 
guardrails to ensure that the money is 
actually going toward keeping guns 
out of the hands of criminals or pre-
venting mass violence. 
Vague red flag laws are ripe for abuse 
and can become extremely dangerous. 
For example, a person could have just 
gotten out of an abusive relationship 
and has a firearm to defend themselves 
against their ex-partner. Their abusive 
partner could report this individual 
and have their firearm taken away, 
putting the victim at even greater risk. 
This bill also includes provisions that 
will lead to enhanced scrutiny of cer-
tain adults based on their age before 
they 
can 
exercise 
their 
constitu-
tionally guaranteed rights. There are 
no other constitutional rights in which 
we require enhanced screenings of cer-
tain adults based solely on their age. 
There is also surprisingly little in 
this bill that actually focuses on mak-
ing our schools safer. The bill does 
nothing to help provide for additional 
school resource officers. I suspect this 
is due to the fact that some of my 
Democrat colleagues are still incapable 
of supporting funding for additional 
law enforcement officers, even in our 
children’s schools. 
Lastly, we know that this is just the 
tip of the iceberg. President Biden and 
my Democrat colleagues have made it 
abundantly clear that this is just a 
‘‘small step’’ toward their larger gun- 
grabbing agenda. The actions of this 
administration’s Department of Jus-
tice, FBI, and ATF have completely 
whittled away the confidence of gun- 
owning Americans that the provisions 
in these bills will not be abused beyond 
their stated scope. 
House Republicans are committed to 
identifying and solving the root causes 
of violent crimes and bolstering school 
security, but doing so must not in-
fringe upon the Second Amendment 
rights of law-abiding citizens. For ex-
ample, just earlier this week, we voted 
on the bipartisan Restoring Hope for 
Mental Health and Well-Being Act. 
This bill contains the bulk of the men-
tal health care provisions included in 
the Senate bill, without infringing on 
Second Amendment rights. 
In this case, the bill we are consid-
ering under this rule is not only a bla-
tant infringement on lawful gun own-
ers’ Second Amendment rights, but an 
unnecessary duplication of the bipar-
tisan work we have already done. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
oppose the rule, ask Members to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say that 
it is a little frustrating to kind of hear 
my colleagues imply that somehow we 
are moving too fast, after decades of 
inaction, of doing absolutely nothing, 
after massacre after massacre after 
massacre, doing nothing. Now we are 
being accused of moving too fast. 
Want to talk about the process? We 
have had countless hearings on gun vi-
olence and on measures to combat gun 
violence in a variety of committees 
here. We had a committee hold a hear-
ing with a young girl from Uvalde who 
told Members of Congress that she had 
to cover herself with the blood of her 
dead classmate and pretend that she 
was dead in order to escape being 
killed herself. 
We have heard from law enforcement 
officials. We have heard from grieving 
parents. Nothing in this bill is con-
troversial. People have seen—the text 
of this bill has been available since 
Tuesday. It is not that complicated. 
So when people say: Process, oh, we 
just need more time, and we should do 
more hearings, and we should do this 
and we should do that—no. I mean, this 
is put up or shut up time for all of us. 
This is an opportunity that we cannot 
miss. 
So the choice for Members on both 
sides is simple. I mean, we are either 
going to do something—again, this is 
way more modest than anything that I 
would suggest that we do. But we are 
either going to do something, or we are 
going to do the same old same old, 
nothing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), a distinguished member 
of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, the 
American people know that we cannot 
sit idly by and watch preventable gun 
deaths happen day after day, year after 
year. 
Over the past few weeks, I have heard 
from hundreds of constituents of all 
ages and all walks of life who are de-
manding action to reduce gun violence. 
When our Framers gathered in Phila-
delphia to write the Constitution, they 
were explicit about the purposes of 
that entire document: . . . establish 
justice, to insure domestic tranquility, 
provide for the common defense’’—not 
individual Armageddon—‘‘promote the 
general welfare, and secure the bless-
ings of liberty to ourselves and our pos-
terity.’’ 
With those words, our Government 
was created to meet the needs of the 
people. 
But how can we meet the needs of the 
people if we don’t take action to pre-
vent them from being gunned down in 
their schools, workplaces, houses of 
worship, or neighborhood streets? 
How can we be faithful to the pur-
poses of the Constitution while allow-
ing 
the 
routine 
terrorization 
and 
slaughter of our children, neighbors, 
teachers, doctors, and seniors? 
I refuse to tell the American people, 
and particularly our children, that 
they must be sacrificial lambs to a 
twisted 
theory 
of 
armed 
Second 
Amendment liberty that defies the ex-
press purposes of our Constitution by 
undermining the general welfare and 
destroying domestic tranquility. 
The American people know, as well 
as we do, that the time is now to act. 
The Safer Communities Act is a mini-
mal first step in taking action to keep 
our children and communities safe. But 
after 30 years of Senate inaction, it is 
a step, and we know that it should not 
be the last. 
Our children deserve a brighter fu-
ture in which they can enjoy the bless-
ings of liberty, instead of being trau-
matized by active-shooter drills and 
actual active shooters. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would just like to mention that my 
distinguished 
colleague 
repeatedly 
talks about how this is not controver-
sial. If it is not controversial, then 
committee hearings held by the major-
ity should not be a problem. So I would 
ask again that we follow the proce-
dures of the House. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider Congressman HUDSON’s STOP II 
Act, critical legislation that addresses 
two issues that both sides of the aisle 
should be able to agree on, hardening 
for schools and active-shooter training, 
law enforcement, and mental health 
funding. 
I ask unanimous consent to insert 
the text of my amendment in the 
RECORD, along with extraneous mate-
rial, immediately prior to the vote on 
the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5886 
June 24, 2022 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
House Republicans are committed to 
addressing the tragedy of these school 
shootings, but we cannot and should 
not impede the constitutional rights of 
law-abiding citizens. This is not a mat-
ter of Democrat or Republican; it is a 
matter of what is in the Constitution. 
Congressman HUDSON’s legislation is 
something we can pass right now, 
today, that will have immediate posi-
tive effects, keeping students safe 
while getting Americans the mental 
health resources they need. 
Many of these solutions are included 
in the bill we are considering under the 
rule, but Congressman HUDSON’s solu-
tion achieves the same outcome with-
out infringing on our Second Amend-
ment rights. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. HUDSON), to speak further on the 
amendment. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider my bill, 
H.R. 7966, the STOP II, Secure Every 
School and Protect our Nation’s Chil-
dren Act. 
It is an honor to be here today. In 
fact, what an honor that the people of 
North Carolina’s Eighth Congressional 
District have bestowed upon me to 
allow me to be their Representative 
here in the United States Congress. 
As I walked the Halls of this Capitol 
building this morning, I couldn’t help 
but think of the great American patri-
ots who have served here before us. 
I think about the patriots who came 
before, who pledged their lives, their 
property, and their sacred honor so 
that we could live in the freedom and 
prosperity we enjoy today. People like 
Patrick Henry, who famously said: 
‘‘Give me liberty or give me death.’’ 
The courage of our Founders, the 
faith, the strength of their convictions, 
the belief in an ideal—indeed, an idea— 
that all people are endowed by our cre-
ator with certain unalienable rights. 
And they devised a Constitution that 
protects and guarantees these rights. It 
is an incredible thing to think about, 
the legacy they have left in the hands 
of this, the 117th Congress. Each one of 
us swore an oath when we accepted this 
office. It wasn’t an oath to a person or 
a political party. It was an oath to de-
fend the Constitution. 
The issue before us today is what can 
we do—no, what should we do when 
faced with the challenge before us, this 
epidemic of children taking the lives of 
other children in our schools? 
Every single one of us grieves for the 
lives taken. As the father of an elemen-
tary school child, my heart aches for 
the lives lost and the unimaginable 
pain and grief felt by those who love 
them. Neither party cares more about 
this. Neither political party has a mo-
nopoly on wanting to do something. 
That is why Republicans have come 
to the table with ideas that will actu-
ally get to some of the root causes of 
this violence. More than 12 pieces of 
legislation have been introduced by Re-
publican Members of this House to 
strengthen background checks, to im-
prove law enforcement coordination 
and response, to address the mental 
health needs of our children, to make 
schools safer, and to prevent this vio-
lence. 
To date, my colleagues across the 
aisle have been unwilling to engage 
with us, to seek consensus, to work to-
gether to solve this problem. 
Just a few weeks ago, the majority 
party brought forth a package of gun 
control measures. This legislation tar-
geted the constitutional rights of law- 
abiding citizens. This legislation did 
nothing to address the security in our 
schools. It did nothing to provide bet-
ter mental health resources to improve 
the ability of school officials and law 
enforcement to intervene with these 
children in crisis. But it did let a lot of 
people around here feel better, because 
they could go home and say: We did 
something. 
Over in the Senate, they aren’t even 
considering this reckless package of 
bills. But Republicans and Democrats 
in the Senate did attempt to work to-
gether to find a solution, and there are 
many things that I like about this Sen-
ate legislation. In fact, I am flattered 
that they use much of the mental 
health and school safety provisions 
from my legislation. But as much as we 
feel the need to do something to tackle 
this problem, we cannot forget that 
oath that we all took on the first day 
of this Congress. 
b 0945 
Our highest calling as a Member of 
Congress is to defend the Constitution. 
And that is where this legislation sent 
to us by the Senate falls short. This 
open-ended 
gun 
control 
legislation 
opens the door to Federal funding of 
State red flag laws. First of all, these 
laws don’t work. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a list of 12 mass shootings that 
have taken place in States that already 
have red flag laws.

Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, the 
State with the most mass shootings is 
California. California has the most re-
strictive gun laws in America. Cali-
fornia already has a red flag law. But 
more important to this debate, red flag 
laws subvert due process protections 
and threaten the constitutional rights 
of law-abiding citizens. 
Why would we agree to borrow more 
money that we don’t have so the Fed-
eral Government can give it to States 
to enact laws that don’t work and that 
actually threaten the rights of our citi-
zens? 
Why would we do that? 
Second, this legislation singles out 
law-abiding citizens under the age of 21 
by giving the government discretion to 
delay, for any reason, their constitu-
tionally protected right to a firearm— 
a right, by the way, affirmed, yet 
again, by the Supreme Court just yes-
terday. 
We all want to keep firearms out of 
the hands of people that shouldn’t have 
them, and I am willing to consider 
ways to better identify people with 
mental health challenges, but I can’t 
help but think about that 20-year-old 
paratrooper stationed in Fort Bragg, 
North Carolina. 
Our Nation entrusted him to defend 
us with an automatic weapon or a mul-
timillion-dollar-weapon system, but we 
can’t trust him with a semiautomatic 
weapon to defend themselves in their 
own home? 
What about the 20-year-old spouse 
back home in Spring Lake, North Caro-
lina, alone because our paratrooper has 
deployed in service of our Nation. Are 
we to tell this spouse that the govern-
ment doesn’t trust you to defend your 
home? 
Instead, we are going to delay your 
purchase for 10 days. At the end of the 
10 days, the government doesn’t even 
have to get back to the gun owner or 
the gun store. Let that gun dealer de-
cide if they want to take a risk on sell-
ing you this firearm while an FBI in-
vestigation is still open. 
No, this is a de facto ban on gun sales 
to law-abiding citizens under the age of 
21.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5887 
June 24, 2022 
Third, this legislation also broadens 
firearm prohibitions for misdemeanors 
and nonviolent offenders. I think most 
of us can agree, someone convicted of 
beating up their spouse ought to be put 
on the background check system. The 
law extends this to misdemeanor as-
sault on a spouse or someone with 
whom you share a child. But we have 
to be careful when we are talking 
about taking away a constitutionally 
protected 
right 
over 
other 
mis-
demeanors. 
The language of this bill is so broad 
it can include nonviolent offenders, and 
I am concerned that the due process 
protections are simply not there. 
So what are we proposing today? 
Let’s set aside these controversial un-
constitutional provisions that divide 
us. Let’s unite around the idea that we 
are going to tackle the real causes of 
this violence. These school shootings 
are almost always done by a young 
male, often from a single-parent or no- 
parent home. They have experienced 
some trauma in their life. Most are 
likely on some behavioral medication, 
and they have shown plenty of signs of 
being in crisis. Yet, effective interven-
tion and mental health treatment did 
not happen. 
So let’s start there. Today, I rise to 
propose we defeat this previous ques-
tion and replace the Senate language 
with H.R. 7966. 
This legislation builds on the STOP 
School Violence Act signed into law in 
2018 by providing a billion dollars in 
grants to hire more school resource of-
ficers. It provides $1 billion to hire 
mental health guidance counselors so 
that schools have the resources to in-
tervene with these children in crisis. 
Imagine, if we had been able to inter-
vene with the shooter in Uvalde before 
he dropped out of high school. 
This legislation includes $5 billion to 
fund STOP School Violence programs 
to make schools safer, to provide ac-
tive shooter training to law enforce-
ment, and to better equip school offi-
cials and students and law enforcement 
to intervene before one of these stu-
dents reaches the breaking point. This 
$7 billion is paid for by redirecting 
unspent COVID–19 funds that have al-
ready been approved. 
Also, under my legislation, schools 
can apply for a threat assessment to 
identify weaknesses in their security 
and to assess the mental health serv-
ices at the school. We would also codify 
a clearinghouse at Homeland Security 
to collect and share best practices for 
school safety. These are practical, 
commonsense solutions that we should 
all be able to agree will have a real im-
pact. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with my 
friend. Now is our moment. Today, we 
can come together—Republicans and 
Democrats—and really address these 
issues in a meaningful way. We can do 
this while at the same time keeping 
the promise made by the sacrifice and 
the courage of our Founders by uphold-
ing our pledge on the first day in office 
to defend this Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against the previous 
question so we can immediately con-
sider this important legislation. God 
bless you. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me just say a couple of words in 
response to the gentleman from North 
Carolina. 
He just said that Democrats and Re-
publicans should come together. Well, 
they did. I mean, MITCH MCCONNELL is 
a Republican. LINDSEY GRAHAM is Re-
publican. TONY GONZALEZ is a Repub-
lican. I mean, Republicans and Demo-
crats have come together like they 
never have before on this issue. Maybe 
my Republican friends ought to get to-
gether with their Republican friends to 
try to work it out on their side. But 
Democrats and Republicans have come 
together. 
I am having trouble following the 
gentleman’s logic when he basically 
implies that if we can’t do something 
to stop all shootings, then maybe it is 
not worth doing anything. Nobody is 
saying that what we are doing today 
will prevent every shooting. What we 
are saying today is that it will prevent 
some. What we are saying today is it 
will protect lives. 
In the aftermath of Uvalde and Buf-
falo, people all across this country, re-
gardless of their politics, were so horri-
fied. They are demanding that we act. 
Again, as I said at the outset, I would 
have preferred that we do more. I un-
derstand that we can only get done 
what we can get done in the reality in 
which we are living here in the Con-
gress; and in the Senate you need 10 
Republicans to get permission to have 
a cup of coffee. The fact of the matter 
is, there is a process over there that 
has prevented even a debate on gun 
safety legislation because of the fili-
buster. But a number of Republican 
Senators came together because they 
listened to their constituents, and I 
think they finally said we have to do 
something. 
No one is saying this will stop every 
shooting, but under that logic, why do 
we have fire departments? 
We have fire departments but there 
are still fires. 
Why do we have seatbelt laws? 
There are seatbelt laws and there are 
still people that get killed in car crash 
fatalities. 
I mean, the bottom line is, we have 
them because they save some lives, and 
it is worth it. As I said at the outset, 
for every item in this bipartisan pack-
age there has been a hearing on at 
some point. None of these ideas are 
new. So there has been a process. 
But what I find particularly ironic is 
that as we are being lectured about, oh, 
we need more time, we need more hear-
ings, the gentlewoman says that we 
should bring up the gentleman’s bill 
and consider it immediately with no 
hearings, with no process. I mean, I get 
whiplash just trying to follow the logic 
of my friends from the other side. 
Madam Speaker, the bottom line is 
either we are going to do something, or 
we are not. And those who are arguing 
for delaying this more and more and 
more are the same people who will 
never vote for it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let my thank the chairman very much 
for yielding, and for the expeditious 
way in which the Committee on Rules 
realized that we are in crisis. 
Let me just start by saying to stop 
the carnage and the bloodshed, I rise in 
support of the bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act. And since I know that 
this Congress has vision and it has pas-
sion to move, as well, the Protect Our 
Kids Act as we go forward in the fu-
ture. 
I realize that this bipartisan effort is 
historic, particularly in light of the 
Supreme Court decision which took 
history and literally shredded the con-
stitutional privileges of life and liberty 
by suggesting that laws that under 
Heller were legal, could not be in place. 
Legislation that is going to come be-
fore us will, in fact, emphasize that we 
want to save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I support this effort 
going forward because I want to say to 
the grieving families of Buffalo, the 
grieving families of Mother Emanuel, 
the grieving families in Uvalde, the 
parent who spoke to me just two nights 
ago whose daughter bled out, that we 
are listening. 
I also rise today to support H. Res. 
1132, which says to the world that the 
United States Congress calls on the 
Government of Russia, the Russian 
Federation, to immediately release 
Brittney Griner. 
This bill was introduced by myself, 
Congressman STANTON
and Congress-
man ALLRED, because we realize this 
young woman who grew up and was 
born in Houston, Texas, who, was a 
two-time Olympian, who is a renowned 
WNBA player, is now wrongfully de-
tained in Russia. She has had a prolific 
collegiate career and went to Nimitz 
High School and Baylor University. 
She is someone who has been known 
to be generous in her community by 
providing an outstanding program that 
helps young people. She has the Heart 
and Soul Shoe Drive. She is an Ameri-
can’s American. 
We ask that you support this H. Res. 
1132 to release Brittney Griner now. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule 
which brings to the floor S. 2938, the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act, and H. Res. 
1132, ‘‘Calling for the immediate release of 
Brittney Griner’’. 
Both the bill and the resolution addressed 
by this rule advance bedrock American values 
and priorities that are intrinsic to our national 
character. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act pro-
vides reasonable, common-sense measures to 
enhance safety and reduce gun violence that 
is increasingly inflicting unspeakable pain and 
suffering on American families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5888 
June 24, 2022 
I have never met an American who does not 
want to keep their children safe, and espe-
cially protect them from gun violence. The bi-
partisan nature of the bill emphasizes the uni-
versal desire to protect our children and fami-
lies. 
When modest, reasonable measures can be 
taken to protect lives and avert tragedy, it is 
our responsibility to embrace that opportunity. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will 
surely save lives. Even if it prevents just one 
mass shooting—or even if it only saves one 
life—its worth will be proven. 
Consider what America would think if, with-
out enactment of this bill, children were mur-
dered in a mass shooting, and it were deter-
mined that the killer would have been pre-
vented from their heinous acts if only this bill 
had become law. For those families in mourn-
ing, Congress’s failure to act would be 
unforgiveable. 
Instead, by advancing this legislation, we 
will be averting the most painful tragedy that 
a family could experience, and many families 
will be spared that devastation. 
The bill’s reasonable steps will have a posi-
tive impact on public safety and family security 
for years to come. 
H. Res. 1132, which is also addressed by 
this rule, calls for the release of Brittney Griner 
and, in so doing, puts Congress on record em-
phatically defending true American values 
such as our devotion to human rights, respect 
and dignity for each person, the right to due 
process, and justice based on truth. 
Each of these have been offended by Rus-
sia unjustifiably holding Griner, and by the 
Russian distortion of a judicial system that ex-
tends her detention, preventing her release to 
return home, without a factual or legal basis 
for doing so. 
Brittney Griner, who grew up in Houston, 
Texas, is an extension of all of us. She rep-
resents quintessential American stories and 
qualities. The injustices inflicted upon her by 
Putin and his acolytes in Russia could have 
been imposed on any Americans within their 
reach. 
The denial of basic rights from Brittney of-
fends all Americans because they are rights to 
which we believe all people are entitled. We 
do not accept the dehumanization that is com-
monplace in Russia, and our values compel 
us to seek justice for Brittney, her immediate 
release, and her return home to her family and 
friends. 
As a mother who has raised a family, I can 
only imagine the gut-wrenching pain that her 
parents, family, and friends must be feeling 
right now. There is no worse feeling than 
when someone in your family is in imminent 
danger and they are beyond your reach to 
help them. 
As a Black woman, I can say there’s no 
greater fear than having a loved one being 
wrongfully placed in a situation or environment 
over which there is no control. 
For any of us, if we had a loved one placed 
in this situation, we would be doing everything 
in our power to ensure their prompt and safe 
return. 
We would be calling and seeking the help of 
everyone possible—including the media, the 
U.S. State Department, and even allies in 
Russia. 
We would press every politician and public 
figure to fight against the corrupt government 
of Russia to ensure that our family member is 
guaranteed their natural born rights to due 
process, a fair trial, and a prompt release from 
detention. 
No American citizen should be detained in a 
foreign country for months, denied access to 
American consular officials, and dependent 
upon the performance of a Russian lawyer, 
especially in absence of substantial evidence 
of a crime. 
Ms. Griner is suffering from Russia’s hei-
nous demonstration of power and control that 
stems from centuries of bigotry and hatred 
embodied in an autocratic leader who is the 
very antithesis of everything Ms. Griner rep-
resents. 
Ms. Griner’s detention is primarily based on 
the country of her citizenship, in a game of po-
litical leverage. Since she was targeted be-
cause of being an American, every American 
should take this personally. Her detention is 
an offense against our country, and against 
our people. 
Griner was detained on February 17, 2022, 
her initial release date was set to be May 
19th, it was then shifted to June 19th, and 
when that date approached, it was delayed to 
July 2nd. 
That is not justice—it’s oppression. We call 
on Putin and the Russian government to com-
ply with their international treaty obligations. 
By passing the rule bringing H. Res. 1132 
before us, Congress insists, alongside the 
Griner family, that Brittney Griner must be im-
mediately and safely released and returned 
home to the U.S. We are unified in demanding 
respectful treatment and justice for her, in ac-
cordance with American values. 
I also rise in support of the rule by which 
the House has passed H. Res. 1132, ‘‘Calling 
for the immediate release of Brittney Griner’’. 
A very important component of the rule cur-
rently before the House is that it: ‘‘Provides 
that House Resolution 1132 is hereby adopt-
ed.’’ 
I fought hard for passage of H. Res. 1132, 
introduced by Congressman STANTON, myself, 
and Congressman ALLRED, because, by rais-
ing our voices for Brittney Griner, we raise our 
voices for bedrock American values and prior-
ities that are intrinsic to our national character. 
H. Res. 1132 calls for the release of Brittney 
Griner and, in so doing, puts Congress on 
record emphatically defending true American 
values such as our devotion to human rights, 
respect and dignity for each person, the right 
to due process, and justice based on truth. 
Each of these have been offended by Rus-
sia unjustifiably holding Griner, and by the 
Russian distortion of a judicial system that ex-
tends her detention, preventing her release to 
return home, without a factual or legal basis

Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
wanted to point out to the gentleman 
from the Massachusetts that the ma-
jority solely holds the power to give 
the bill a hearing. And I am sure I can 
speak on behalf of the gentleman from 
North Carolina that he would be happy 
to be granted a hearing on his bill and 
would love to have that done given 
that you are in control of those hear-
ings. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to 
be here. This is a somber time. Yes, the 
Senate has sent us something over

again that we never got to really look 
into before we have to vote in the 
House. 
Madam Speaker, I actually have a 
bill, H.R. 7909, that I think you all 
would be interested if I had gotten to 
speak to it in the Committee on Rules 
this morning. 
It does three things: It says to our 
law enforcement retired professionals 
if they want to get a part-time job as 
an armed resource officer with the 
school district, they don’t have to pay 
Social Security, withholding taxes, 
FICA—none of that—that is so they 
don’t get thrown into a higher income 
tax bracket. 
The second thing it does, is it allows 
schools to hire an absolute profes-
sional, a retired law enforcement pro-
fessional at a reduced rate, because 
they don’t have to match Social Secu-
rity, withholding, and FICA. 
But third and most importantly what 
it does, is it gives the students and the 
teachers and the staff of that facility, 
first-class armed protection in that 
school system and in that school dis-
trict so that when and if this happens, 
they have got a professional there. 
May 18, 2018. It was a Friday; 10 peo-
ple were killed in Santa Fe High 
School, in my district. 
John Barns, a police officer, an un-
armed police officer was there within 3 
minutes. 
He came around to confront the gun-
man, and the gunman pretty much 
eviscerated his right arm with a shot-
gun. Other police officers showed up 
quickly. 
Madam Speaker, we can do this with 
help to the school districts. We can get 
armed professional police officers there 
to help protect our schools, the kids, 
teachers, and the staff. It doesn’t have 
to be about violating the Second 
Amendment. It doesn’t have to be 
about taking away gun rights. This is 
one simple thing. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge my 
colleagues to look at that bill, see if 
they are interested in it because it is 
one way we can help. 
b 1000 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
just want to take a moment to recog-
nize and thank a longtime Rules staffer 
who will be leaving us next week for 
the Department of Commerce as their 
director of legislative affairs. 
Rose Laughlin, who is next to me, 
has been with the Rules Committee for 
8 years, starting as an intern with the 
late 
Congresswoman, 
Chair 
Louise 
Slaughter. Rose was Ms. Slaughter’s 
right-hand woman. 
Rose, I know that Louise was terribly 
proud of all of your accomplishments 
and your dedication to the people of 
this country. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is fitting 
today that Rose is here because this 
will be her last rule on the House floor. 
It is fitting that she is here because 
this is a historic bipartisan measure on 
gun reform that will actually make it 
to the President’s desk. No one on this 
committee has worked harder or more 
thoughtfully over the years for gun re-
form than Rose. 
Her dependable, resourceful, collabo-
rative attitude has made this work 
easier for us all. This institution, and 
those we serve, are better off because 
of her dedication to public service. 
Rose, you always will have a home 
here at the Capitol. We are going to 
miss you, but we are excited about con-
tinuing to work with you in your new 
role, and we are very proud of you. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
we join the chairman in wishing Rose 
the best in her future endeavors. 
Thank you for that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, House Republicans 
want to ensure that our schools and 
communities are safe, but today the 
lack of hearings, the lack of public 
input, and the lack of procedure of-
fends our duty to our constituents and 
our oath to defend the Constitution. 
We are not willing to subvert con-
stitutional rights of law-abiding Amer-
icans, like this bill would do. There are 
solutions to prevent tragedies like we 
have seen without affecting law-abid-
ing gun owners. We can pass those 
today, and that, both sides can agree 
on. 
Unfortunately, the legislation pro-
vided under the rule attaches these so-
lutions to unconstitutional and mis-
guided policies that are a ‘‘small step’’ 
in the Democrats’ broader gun control 
agenda. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, 
and I ask Members to do the same. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues, Democrats and Republicans, 
to vote for this bipartisan bill. It is not 
that long, and people have had it since 
Tuesday. It has been posted since Tues-
day. 
As I said, it is not everything that I 
think needs to be done. Certainly, it is 
not everything that we have passed in 
this House, but it is a start. If we pass 
this and send it to the President for his 
signature, and it becomes law, it will 
save lives. It is what the American peo-
ple want. 
Madam Speaker, I have talked to so 
many families who have lost loved ones 
to gun violence. I have watched the 
hearings in which grieving parents and 
brothers and sisters have talked about 
how horrific it was to lose a loved one 
to gun violence, begging us to do some-
thing so that no other family has to go 
through that. 
For years, all of those pleas have fall-
en on deaf ears. When we have even 
tried to get anything done here, mod-
est legislation, we send it over to the 
Senate and couldn’t get the 60 votes to 
even have a discussion on the Senate 
floor. That just changed. 
It changed, I think, because people 
are so horrified about what just re-
cently happened, but also what has 
been happening time and time again in 
this country. 
I know the question for everybody 
here is not about: Does this violate the 
Second Amendment, or is this taking 
away guns from lawful gun owners? It 
is not. That is all garbage. It really is. 
That is not what this is about. 
I get it. The gun lobby is making 
phone calls and threatening to hold 
back checks if people somehow don’t 
frustrate this bill so that it can’t get 
to the President’s desk. 
We were elected to help people and to 
protect people. In the Senate, we have 
this remarkable bipartisan collabora-
tion, and in the House, we have Repub-
licans who have supported sensible gun 
safety legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I hope this is an 
overwhelmingly bipartisan vote in the 
House. I know that it may not be be-
cause the leadership here has urged Re-
publican Members to oppose this. I re-
gret that very much. 
When people say that this is some-
how a leftwing bill—I mean, MITCH 
MCCONNELL, LINDSEY GRAHAM? Give me 
a break. This is a truly bipartisan bill. 
It is a compromise. 
To suggest that we need more hear-
ings on a bill on a compromise that 
every single topic in this compromise 
has had hearings on before, to suggest 
to do that by people who don’t want 
this to move to begin with, come on. 
This is the put-up-or-shut-up mo-
ment for people here. We either do 
something, or we are going to do noth-
ing. We have been doing nothing for 
years. 
I urged in my opening that people 
think long and hard before they vote. 
Consult your conscience. 
I can’t go back and talk to parents 
who lost loved ones to violence and 
say: ‘‘Oh, we tried, but it wasn’t per-
fect.’’ I could easily go back and say: ‘‘I 
wish it were bigger and more. It is not 
perfect, so I am not going to support 
it.’’ I am supporting this because it is 
something, and it is going to save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to please support this. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ on the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ on the 
previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1204

Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
That the following sums are appropriated, out

dress threats to the Supreme Court of the United 
States.

TITLE III 
GENERAL PROVISIONS—THIS ACT 
SEC. 301. Each amount appropriated or made 
available by this Act is in addition to amounts 
otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year in-
volved. 
SEC. 302. No part of any appropriation con-
tained in this Act shall remain available for ob-
ligation beyond the current fiscal year unless 
expressly so provided herein.

designated by Congress as being for an emer-
gency requirement pursuant to section 4001(a)(1)

Congress), the concurrent resolution on the 
budget for fiscal year 2022. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supreme Court 
Security Funding Act of 2022’’. 
The text of the House amendment to 
the Senate amendment is as follows: 
In lieu of the matter proposed to be in-
serted by the Senate amendment, insert the 
following: 
SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the cost of insulin, a lifesaving medica-
tion for the approximately 7,400,000 Ameri-
cans who need it, is often prohibitive; 
(2) in 2020, nearly 1 in 6 adults reported de-
laying, skipping, reducing the amount of, or 
otherwise not getting prescription drugs be-
cause of the costs of the drugs; and 
(3) increased barriers to accessing nec-
essary medication can lead to lower medica-
tion use and increase in cost of related hos-
pitalizations and emergency room visits. 
SEC. 2. ADDITION OF VACCINES AGAINST COVID– 
19 TO LIST OF TAXABLE VACCINES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 4132(a)(1) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subpara-
graph: 
‘‘(Q) Any vaccine against COVID–19.’’. 
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.— 
(1) SALES, ETC.—The amendment made by 
this section shall apply to sales and uses on 
or after the later of— 
(A) the first day of the first month which 
begins more than 4 weeks after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, or 
(B) the date on which the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services lists any vaccine 
against COVID–19 for purposes of compensa-
tion for any vaccine-related injury or death 
through the Vaccine Injury Compensation 
Trust Fund. 
(2) DELIVERIES.—For purposes of paragraph 
(1) and section 4131 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, in the case of sales on or before 
the effective date described in such para-
graph for which delivery is made after such

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I have a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BROWN of Maryland). The Clerk will 
designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. SCOTT
of Virginia moves that the 
House concur in the Senate amendment to 
the House amendment to S. 2089. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1204, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 10 minutes 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
or their designees. 
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on the legislation currently under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here, again, to 
pass legislation to ensure that our Na-
tion’s children have access to healthy 
meals. The Senate amended the bill 
that we passed yesterday, and so today 
we are going accept that amendment so 
the bill can be forwarded on to the 
President for signature. 
S. 2089 would: 
Maintain school meal flexibilities 
that do not increase costs; 
Continue flexibilities to support sum-
mer food programs this year; 
Provide additional support for child 
and adult care feeding programs; and 
Increase school meal reimbursement 
rates for this upcoming school year. 
We know this bill alone will not end 
hunger in America, nor does it uphold 
the stronger provisions in the bill that 
the House passed yesterday, but it is an 
important step to take for our Nation’s 
children and to fulfill our basic respon-
sibility to keep them from going hun-
gry. 
I thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina, the ranking member of the 
committee, Dr. FOXX, for cooperating 
and making sure this legislation could 
come to the floor, along with the Sen-
ator STABENOW from Michigan and Sen-
ator BOOZMAN from Arkansas. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the motion, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my col-
league from Virginia yielding time. 
This is essentially the same bill we 
passed overwhelmingly yesterday, ex-
cept it was improved by our colleagues 
in the Senate. This bill is a more tar-
geted approach that includes tem-
porary 
support 
for 
students 
and 
schools. It puts an end to the perma-
nent pandemic narrative that led to 
unnecessary Federal programs with lit-
tle return to taxpayers. For more than 
2 years, broad nutrition waivers pro-
vided free meals to everyone, including 
wealthy families. This legislation re-
turns these programs to regular order. 
Most importantly, this bill is fully 
paid for. It is an example of respecting 
taxpayer funds, something the Federal 
Government is in short supply of. 
Simply put, this bill puts our school 
nutrition programs back on track, so 
taxpayers, schools, and students are 
better served. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
The reality is that Congress has 
reached its deadline. We must pass this 
critical legislation to ensure that chil-
dren have healthy meals this summer 
and that schools and daycares have the 
funding and flexibilities they need to 
respond to the supply chain challenges 
and high food costs in the future. 
If we do not act, we will jeopardize 
children’s access to nutritious meals. 
I wish, again, to thank the ranking 
member, Dr. FOXX, for her cooperation 
in bringing this bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation to the floor, along with Sen-
ators STABENOW and BOOZMAN. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 2089, support the motion, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD for S. 2089, as amended, 
the following letters from the Academy of Nu-
trition and Dietetics, Feeding America, Save 
the Children, the School Nutrition Association, 
the Council of the Great City Schools, and the 
Center for Law and Social Policy in support of 
the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022.

PROTECT NUTRITION SECURITY FOR CHILDREN: 
ACADEMY
OF
NUTRITION
AND
DIETETICS 
WELCOMES NEW BIPARTISAN BILL 
CHICAGO—The Academy of Nutrition and 
Dietetics strongly supports the new Keep 
Kids Fed Act, introduced June 21 in Con-
gress, as a crucial step in addressing nutri-
tion security among school-aged children in 
the United States. The bill was introduced 
by U.S. Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and 
John Boozman (Ark.) and U.S. Reps. Bobby 
Scott (Va.) and Virginia Foxx (N.C.). 
‘‘Studies have shown that the school cafe-
teria is the healthiest place for children to 
eat in the U.S.,’’ said registered dietitian nu-
tritionist and the Academy’s 2022–2023 Presi-
dent Ellen R. Shanley. ‘‘The Keep Kids Fed 
Act therefore is more important than ever in 
providing parents and guardians with the as-
surance that their children are receiving 
healthful meals to fuel them throughout this 
summer as well as the next school year.’’ 
The Academy commends the Keep Kids Fed 
Act, which grants the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture the authority to provide tem-
porary waivers that will provide full flexi-
bilities to summer meal programs, eliminate 
the reduced-price meal category and increase 
reimbursement rates in response to rising 
food costs. 
‘‘The Academy and our members have tire-
lessly advocated for the continuation of 
child nutrition waivers as the country con-
tinues to grapple with ongoing supply chain 
and labor shortages due to the COVID–19 
pandemic, as well as inflation,’’ Shanley 
said. 
Because the pandemic has had a dispropor-
tionate impact on people from underrep-
resented communities and those with diet- 
related disease, access to healthful school 
meals promotes nutrition security as well as 
health equity. 
While the Academy considers nutrition 
waivers to be a step in the right direction, 
the legislation comes late in the process as 
schools are organizing and operating summer 
meal programs and planning meal programs 
for the next school year. 
‘‘A better solution is to make school meals 
free for all children, all year,’’ Shanley said.

‘‘The Academy has long advocated for 
Healthy School Meals for All and will con-
tinue to educate members of Congress on its 
benefits. We look forward to working with 
Congress on a permanent solution to issues 
of nutrition security for all, particularly for 
children.’’

FEEDING AMERICA APPLAUDS BI-PARTISAN 
STEP TO EXTEND CHILD NUTRITION WAIVERS 
STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO VINCE HALL, CHIEF 
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS OFFICER 
‘‘Feeding America, the nation’s largest 
hunger-relief network of 200 food banks, 21 
statewide associations and 60,000 faith-based 
and non-profit partner food pantries and 
meal programs, applauds Congress for taking 
the needed steps to extend child nutrition 
waiver authority, which will help ensure 
children are able to access much-needed nu-
trition in the months ahead. Network food 
banks and partners have been asking for this 
continued flexibility for many months. The 
bi-partisan legislation, the Keep Kids Fed 
Act, was released today by Senators Debbie 
Stabenow (D–MI) and John Boozman (R–AR) 
and Representatives Bobby Scott (D–VA 03) 
and Virginia Foxx (R–NC 05) ahead of the 
June 30th deadline. The bill would provide 
temporary authority to USDA to provide 
summer meal program flexibilities, elimi-
nate the reduced-price meal category, and 
increase reimbursement rates to help offset 
rising food costs. It will offer much needed 
stability, predictability, and an assurance 
that children will be better able to get the 
meals they need through the coming year. 
Together, these provisions will provide sig-
nificant help for children who often do not 
know where they will get their next meal, 
particularly in communities of color who ex-
perience hunger at a disproportionate rate. 
‘‘Originally granted as part of the pan-
demic response to ensure access to meals for 
children in need during the school year and 
in the summertime, waivers allowing flexi-
bilities for child nutrition program operators 
remain essential to addressing child food in-
security, particularly amid continued supply 
chain disruptions and ongoing barriers to 
reaching kids in rural areas. As it stands, 
schools and communities need continued 
flexibilities to safely plan for and offer sum-
mer meal programs and nutrition assistance 
during the next school year. 
‘‘For millions of school children, school 
meals are often their only reliable nutrition 
source. Feeding America stands ready to 
work with Congress to ensure this important 
bill passes both chambers and is signed by 
President Biden, and we look forward to 
working with them on future legislation to 
ensure child nutrition programs remain 
strong and responsive to local needs in the 
months and years ahead.’’

ACTION
NETWORK—URGES
CONGRESS
TO 
SWIFTLY PASS THIS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION 
WASHINGTON, DC—After yesterday’s release 
of the bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act (H.R. 
8150), Cassidy Pont, Lead Policy Advocate 
for Domestic Child Nutrition at Save the 
Children, issued the following statement: 
‘‘We wholeheartedly welcome the release 
of the bipartisan and budget-neutral Keep 
Kids Fed Act, which will temporarily extend 
some child nutrition waivers, preventing 
nearly 7 million children from losing access 
to nutritious meals this summer alone. In 
the midst of increasing supply chain chal-
lenges and rising food and gas prices, this 
support will be a life-line for school nutri-
tion programs and child care providers, ena-
bling them to stay financially afloat while 
continuing to serve children the nutritious 
foods they need to grow, develop, learn and 
thrive. While we are disappointed the legisla-
tion doesn’t extend the USDA Secretary’s 
full waiver authority through the next 
school year, the Keep Kids Fed Act is an im-
portant step in the right direction. We urge 
Congress to act quickly to pass this legisla-
tion. If not, millions of children could go 
hungry, and we cannot let that happen.’’

SNA URGES PASSAGE OF SCHOOL MEALS 
AGREEMENT 
ARLINGTON, VA—The School Nutrition As-
sociation (SNA) praised a new agreement to 
provide critical support to school meal pro-
grams prior to the expiration of federal pan-
demic waivers. Set to expire June 30, the 
waivers have ensured students can access 
healthy school meals despite persistent sup-
ply chain, food cost and labor burdens. SNA 
urges Congress to swiftly pass The Keep Kids 
Fed Act of 2022. 
The $3 billion package will provide the fol-
lowing assistance through School Year 2022/ 
23: 
Allow students eligible for reduced-price 
meals to receive free meals 
Increase federal reimbursements for every 
school lunch by 40 cents and every school 
breakfast by 15 cents, above the annual infla-
tionary adjustment scheduled for July 1 
Extend no-cost waivers, including those for 
schools unable to meet nutrition standards 
due to supply chain disruptions and to re-
duce administrative and reporting burdens 
Extend waivers for 2022 summer meal pro-
grams 
‘‘School nutrition professionals have with-
stood crippling supply chain breakdowns, ris-
ing prices and labor shortages in their efforts 
to provide students healthy meals, at a time 
when families are struggling with higher 
costs. With crucial federal waivers on the 
verge of expiring, this agreement offers 
school meal programs a lifeline to help build 
back toward normal operations,’’ said SNA 
President Beth Wallace, MBA, SNS. 
‘‘SNA members are extremely grateful to 
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman 
Debbie Stabenow, Ranking Member John 
Boozman, House Education and Labor Com-
mittee Chairman Bobby Scott and Ranking 
Member Virginia Foxx for their consistent 
efforts to support school meal programs and 
to Congressional leaders for bringing this 
critical agreement to the floor,’’ said Wal-
lace. 
SNA members have reported an ongoing 
struggle to obtain sufficient food and sup-
plies for their programs, as manufacturers 
discontinue products ranging from low-so-
dium chicken breasts to low-fat milk cartons 
and yogurt cups. Members have reported 
shortages of as many as 150–200 menu items 
per order, which send short-staffed school 
nutrition 
teams 
scrambling 
to 
secure 
healthy menu substitutions for their stu-
dents. School nutrition directors across the 
country 
report 
unprecedented 
price 
in-
creases, including a 280% increase in the cost 
of a case of gloves and 137% increase on 
whole grain bread. 
‘‘SNA appreciates ongoing efforts of U.S. 
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to ad-
dress persistent supply chain challenges and 
USDA’s commitment to avert penalties for 
schools unable to comply with meal pattern 
requirements due to these disruptions,’’ said 
Wallace. ‘‘We will continue to work with 
USDA next school year as we seek solutions 
to support school nutrition professionals and 
ensure the financial sustainability of meal 
programs for the students they serve.’’ 
SNA’s 2022 Position Paper, released in Jan-
uary, urged Congress to extend pandemic-re-
lated child nutrition waivers and to perma-
nently increase school meal reimbursement 
rates, offer free school meals to all students 
and ease regulatory requirements. 
COUNCIL OF THE GREAT CITY SCHOOLS®, 
Washington, DC, June 22, 2022. 
Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Education and 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEM-
BER FOXX: The Council of the Great City 
Schools, the coalition of the nation’s largest 
central-city school districts, writes to offer 
our support for the Keep Kids Fed Act of 
2022. Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, urban districts have worked tirelessly 
to ensure that all of our students have safe 
access to healthy meal options, both during 
school closures and while on campus. Since 
March 2020, the COVID–19 waivers approved 
by Congress provided our Food Service de-
partments with the additional funding and 
flexibility needed to get meals to students 
wherever they are and to deal with rising 
costs, personnel shortages, and supply chain 
issues. 
Even though schools have been open this 
spring and are expecting to offer in-person 
instruction this fall, our child nutrition pro-
grams are still in crisis and have not re-
turned to pre-pandemic normal. Supply 
chain and staffing issues persist and the need 
to relieve school districts from meal pattern, 
non-congregate feeding, and mealtime re-
quirements remains essential. The Keep Kids 
Fed Act will provide school districts with 
the flexibility needed for continuity of oper-
ations next school year and offers additional 
funding to help serve more students and al-
leviate rising costs for meal items, food serv-
ice supplies, and personnel. 
With summer programs already operating 
and fall planning well-underway, school dis-
tricts are facing enormous challenges in 
serving nutritious meals to students every 
day. The Council appreciates the bipartisan 
solutions offered in the Keep Kids Fed Act of 
2022 to help mitigate some of these issues 
and urges a YES vote.

THE CENTER FOR LAW 
AND SOCIAL POLICY, 
Washington, DC, June 23, 2022. 
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: The Center 
for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) expresses 
our support for H.R. 8150, the Keep Kids Fed 
Act of 2022, which would extend key flexibili-
ties for school meal provisions enacted under 
the Families First Coronavirus Response Act 
(FFCRA). As a national, nonpartisan anti- 
poverty organization that places racial eq-
uity at the center of our work, we under-
stand how failing to extend this successful 
policy 
would 
harm 
food 
security 
in 
marginalized and low-income communities. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is ongoing, and 
schools are struggling to manage rising food 
costs and clogged supply chains. Congress’ 
failure to extend the waivers and flexibilities 
the FFCRA provides would mean schools not 
having the tools they need to continue pro-
viding consistent and reliable meals to stu-
dents. If Congress fails to extend these flexi-
bilities beyond the current expiration date of

June 30, 2022, millions of children face the 
possibility of losing access to healthy meals. 
CLASP is pleased to see the inclusion of 
the waiver ensuring all family child care 
homes qualify for the highest reimbursement 
rate under the Child and Adult Food Care 
(CACFP) program. This waiver eliminates 
the usual area eligibility requirement that 
limits this rate to providers in areas meeting 
a 50 percent low-income threshold. This 
threshold excludes many providers serving 
children in families with low incomes, espe-
cially in rural and suburban areas, where 
poverty is often less concentrated than in 
urban areas. In addition, the area eligibility 
test completely neglects providers and fami-
lies struggling in areas with a high cost-of- 
living. CLASP recommends permanently 
eliminating the area eligibility test perma-
nent. This change would bring more child 
care providers who serve low-income chil-
dren into CACFP, ensuring many more chil-
dren in need would receive healthy CACFP 
meals and snacks. 
The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated child 
hunger in the U.S., but did not create it. 
Prior to the pandemic, almost 1 in every 7 
households struggled with food security, a 
rate that spiked to 1 in 3 with the onset of 
the pandemic. The policies enacted through 
the FFCRA, namely the nationwide waiver 
authority 
and 
expanded 
reimbursement 
rates, has enabled schools to meet the im-
mense challenge of heightened demand and 
costs. As long as pandemic-related economic 
pressures remain, these flexibilities should 
as well. Many children in this country rely 
on meals through schools and child care pro-
grams as a source of reliable and nutritious 
food. These meals can support their develop-
ment and represent a wise investment from 
policymakers. CLASP encourages Congress 
in the future to support universal school 
meals so that all students can receive the 
nutrition they need without stigma or bur-
densome paperwork. 
CLASP thanks Sens. Stabenow and Booz-
man and Reps. Scott and Foxx for their bi-
partisan work on this important piece of leg-
islation. CLASP urges swift passage and 
looks forward to working with your office on 
legislative matters reducing poverty in this 
country. For more information, or to help 
answer 
any 
questions,

Tralonne Shorter, Director of Legislative Af-
fairs. 
Sincerely, 
INDIVAR DUTTA-GUPTA, 
Executive Director. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, long overdue legislation to address gun 
violence in our schools and neighborhoods. 
Although this legislation is far from perfect, it 
is an important step forward in solving the epi-
demic of gun violence that has gripped our na-
tion for decades. 
In the weeks following the tragedy in Uvalde 
at Robb Elementary and the racist attack at a 
grocery store in Buffalo, I spoke with many 
constituents who continue to urge action. 
Teachers, parents, and concerned community 
members from Northwest Oregon shared 
pleas for Congress to follow through on our 
responsibility to our children and our nation by 
immediately passing bold policies to imple-
ment gun safety reform. An educator I know 
told me that after Uvalde, she sat down with 
her students and told them she would take a 
bullet for them. Conversations like this are 
happening in classrooms across the country, 
but they shouldn’t have to. Congress must 
provide all students with safe learning environ-
ments free from the threat of gun violence. 
The House already passed a comprehensive 
slate of gun violence prevention legislation, 
and I look forward to building on that by voting 
for this legislation that came out of the bipar-
tisan Senate negotiations. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will 
help to protect Americans and make gun sales 
safer. The most effective way to protect com-
munities from gun violence is to keep guns out 
of the hands of individuals who are a danger 
to themselves and others. This legislation will 
incentivize states to establish extreme risk 
protection order laws, enhance background 
checks for people under the age of 21, end 
straw purchasing, and penalize gun traffickers. 
It will also safeguard survivors of domestic vio-
lence by closing the so called ‘‘boyfriend loop-
hole,’’ prohibiting people convicted of domestic 
violence crimes from possessing firearms. 
Additionally, this bill makes a robust invest-
ment in under Title IV–A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act. Fully funding this important 
grant program will help to close the oppor-
tunity and resource gaps in our nation’s public 
schools, and I’m pleased this bill recognizes 
the importance of this program in providing 
students of all backgrounds with a well-round-
ed, safe, and healthy education. 
Although these actions to address gun vio-
lence in our communities and fund critical 
school improvement programs are important, I 
am concerned about how various provisions in 
the bill could harm Black and brown students 
and students with disabilities in our nation’s 
schools. The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act increases funding for school resource offi-
cers (SROs) and codifies further involvement 
of the Department of Homeland Security in 
education through threat assessments. Re-
search and practice show that both SROs and 
threat assessments are ineffective in keeping 
students safe in schools. As Chair of the Civil 
Rights and Human Services Subcommittee, I 
remain committed to protecting students’ civil 
rights and delivering on the promise of an eq-
uitable, world-class public education for each 
and every student in this country. I will closely 
monitor the implementation of this legislation 
to make sure our most marginalized and vul-
nerable students are not subject to further dis-
proportionate discipline and discriminatory tar-
geting in schools. 
As a member of the Gun Violence Preven-
tion Taskforce, I again want to recognize how 
crucial the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
is to our schools, communities, and country. 
This bill will be the first substantive action on 
gun violence prevention since the passage of 
the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 
1994. In the last 30 years, our nation has 
been devastated over and over again by hor-
rific tragedies like we saw in recent weeks at 
Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. We can-
not bring back those who have been mur-
dered, but we can enact meaningful laws that 
will prevent more senseless deaths. 
I urge swift passage of the legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1204, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question is on the motion by the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
The motion to concur was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Pursuant to its authority under section 994 of 
title 28, United States Code, and in accordance 
with this subsection, the United States Sen-
tencing Commission shall review and amend its 
guidelines and policy statements to ensure that 
persons convicted of an offense under section 
932 or 933 of title 18, United States Code, and 
other offenses applicable to the straw purchases 
and trafficking of firearms are subject to in-
creased penalties in comparison to those cur-
rently provided by the guidelines and policy 
statements for such straw purchasing and traf-
ficking of firearms offenses. In its review, the 
Commission shall consider, in particular, an ap-
propriate amendment to reflect the intent of 
Congress that straw purchasers without signifi-
cant criminal histories receive sentences that are 
sufficient to deter participation in such activi-
ties and reflect the defendant’s role and culpa-
bility, and any coercion, domestic violence sur-
vivor history, or other mitigating factors. The 
Commission shall also review and amend its 
guidelines and policy statements to reflect the 
intent of Congress that a person convicted of an 
offense under section 932 or 933 of title 18, 
United States Code, who is affiliated with a 
gang, cartel, organized crime ring, or other such 
enterprise should be subject to higher penalties 
than an otherwise unaffiliated individual.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. NADLER moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendments to the House 
amendment to S. 2938. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1204, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary or 
their designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on S. 2938. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
did not comment on the decision of the 
Supreme Court, just minutes ago, to 
revoke the constitutional right to 
abortion, a right that millions of 
Americans have relied upon for half a 
century. 
Worse, Justice Thomas has indicated 
that this is merely the beginning of a 
radical, rightwing effort to roll back 
other rights, including the right to 
contraception, the right to marry 
whomever we choose, and the funda-
mental right to privacy. 
We should observe that the same Jus-
tices telling us today that questions 
about reproductive rights must be left 
to the States, told us just yesterday 
that the States cannot be trusted to 
regulate modern firearms, weapons 
that were never dreamed of by the 
Framers of the Second Amendment. 
History 
will 
prove 
these 
activists 
wrong on both counts. 
But today, Mr. Speaker, we take a 
historic first step toward ending the 
epidemic of gun violence in this Na-
tion, the only developed Nation with 
this problem. 
We come to this moment after the 
tragic loss of so many innocent lives: 
10 African Americans in Buffalo, tar-
geted because of their race; 19 young 
students and 2 teachers in Uvalde, just 
a few days short of their summer vaca-
tions; scores more lost in other mass 
shootings too numerous to mention; 
and over 100 more Americans killed 
every day in gun violence that never 
makes the headlines. 
No piece of legislation can ever bring 
these lives back. No legislation can 
make their families or their commu-
nities whole. But we can act to keep 
others from facing the same trauma 
they have endured. 
A few weeks ago, I was proud to bring 
forth the Protecting Our Kids Act,

which took a bipartisan and com-
prehensive approach to ending gun vio-
lence. I am pleased that the Senate in-
corporated portions of that bill into 
their own legislation. 
I wish there was more. I wish we 
could say we were doing everything we 
could to prevent another parent from 
losing their child to gun violence, but I 
am proud to be making an important 
start today. 
This cannot be the last step, but we 
also cannot let another day go by with-
out taking action to make our commu-
nities safer and to keep even one more 
family whole. 
Recently, I have turned to a par-
ticular teaching in the Talmud: 
Whoever takes one life, it is as if he kills 
the entire world; and whoever saves one life, 
it is as if he saves the entire world. 
This legislation includes provisions 
that will save many lives. Like the 
Protecting Our Kids Act, it includes 
funding to implement extreme risk 
protection laws and the prohibition on 
straw purchasing. It also strengthens 
background checks for those under 21, 
makes more sellers responsible for con-
ducting 
background 
checks, 
takes 
steps to address the boyfriend loophole, 
and provides significant funding for 
programs that will make our commu-
nities safer. 
Today, we will send legislation to the 
President’s desk, for the first time in 
decades, that will make progress to-
ward ending the scourge of gun vio-
lence. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me first say, God 
bless the United States Supreme Court. 
And God bless President Trump for the 
people he selected for our highest 
court. Today’s decision is a win for the 
Constitution and a win for the sanctity 
of human life. June 24, 2022, a date that 
will be remembered as a win for the sa-
credness of human life. 
Now this bill. Mr. Speaker, the rights 
spelled out in the First Amendment 
and protected by the Second Amend-
ment are why the United States is dif-
ferent than every other country. It is 
why we are special. It is why we are the 
greatest Nation in history. 
For 18 months, the Democrats have 
attacked our First Amendment lib-
erties. Today, they are coming after 
our Second Amendment liberties. And 
who knows what it will be tomorrow. I 
can only imagine. 
My guess is, in light of the decision 
yesterday from Justice Thomas, the 
decision today from the Court, my 
guess is they are going to look to pack 
the Court. The Democrat chair of the 
Committee on the Judiciary has al-
ready introduced legislation to pack 
the Court. 
It might be amnesty for the 2 million 
illegal immigrants who have come into 
our country in the Biden administra-
tion. They told us they want to end the 
electoral college and the filibuster— 
and who knows what it will be tomor-
row. But today, they are coming after 
law-abiding American citizens’ Second 
Amendment liberties. 
Understand 
what 
this 
legislation 
does. This legislation tells States: 
Someone who doesn’t like you can re-
port you to law enforcement or to a 
judge. There will be a hearing, a hear-
ing where you can’t be at, your lawyer 
can’t be at, you can’t confront your ac-
cuser. You didn’t commit any crime, 
but they can take your property. They 
can take your guns. They can take 
away your Second Amendment rights. 
And then you have to petition to have 
a subsequent hearing where you get 
them back. That is what this legisla-
tion does. 
And understand this, and this is so 
important. This is not being done in a 
vacuum. Understand what we have seen 
from the left and how they have 
weaponized a government against their 
political enemies. 
Mr. Speaker, 12 years ago, it was the 
IRS targeting conservatives. 
Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago, it was the 
FBI spying on President Trump’s cam-
paign. 
More recently, it was the Depart-
ment of Justice using counterterrorism 
measures against moms and dads. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security set up the 
Disinformation 
Governance 
Board; 
going 
to 
chill 
everyone’s 
speech. 
Today, they are coming after your Sec-
ond Amendment liberties. 
Here is the good news: Yesterday, the 
Supreme Court got it right. They got it 
right when it came to the Second 
Amendment. We should celebrate that. 
I hope that this bill doesn’t pass. It 
seems like it is going to, but I hope it 
doesn’t. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the distinguished 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
extraordinary leadership in bringing 
this very important legislation to the 
floor. I commend the chairman, as well 
as Mr. MIKE THOMPSON, the chair of our 
Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, 
and so many others who have partici-
pated in so many elements of this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 
strong step forward to combat Amer-
ica’s epidemic of gun violence and to 
protect our precious children. 
As lawmakers, we share a sacred re-
sponsibility to keep our kids safe from 
harm. But according to new data from 
the CDC, guns are the number one kill-
er of children in America; more than 
car accidents or cancer. Our hearts re-
main shattered by the rampage at 
Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, as 
they do from the massacre at Sandy 
Hook, and countless other commu-
nities across the Nation. 
Indeed, we know these schools could 
have been in any one of our districts— 
and have been in some, those families 
could have been any one of our neigh-
bors—and have been, and those chil-
dren could have been our own. 
All of us who have met with sur-
vivors in the wake of the tragedies 
have heard their message loud and 
clear. We must do something. 
Today, in their honor, we heed their 
powerful cry, sending a major gun vio-
lence prevention legislation to Presi-
dent Biden’s desk for signature. We 
send it to the President for his signa-
ture, with gratitude for his leadership 
on this important issue. He was the au-
thor of the Brady Law in 1994 and has 
been a champion ever since. 
This legislation, the bipartisan Safer 
Communities 
Act, 
includes 
several 
strong steps to save lives not only from 
horrific mass shootings, but also from 
the daily massacre of gun crime, sui-
cide, and tragic accidents. 
Included in this package are two 
major provisions which we have cham-
pioned here in the House: 
First, this bill includes significant 
investments to help States establish 
Extreme Risk Protection Order Laws, 
otherwise known as red flag laws. 
Thanks to the leadership of Rep-
resentative LUCY
MCBATH, who has 
been our inspirational leader on this 
subject in our caucus and this Con-
gress, and SALUD CARBAJAL, these pro-
visions will keep deadly weapons away 
from those who pose a threat to them-
selves and to others. 
Secondly, this bill takes strong ac-
tion to combat straw purchases, a 
cause Congresswoman ROBIN
KELLY 
spearheaded in our Chamber. Although 
we hear about the notorious mass mur-
ders every day on our streets and in 
our country, murders take place. Doing 
so will make it illegal to buy guns on 
behalf of those who cannot legally pur-
chase. 
If I can pass the test, I buy the gun. 
And then I sell it to you because you 
can’t pass the test. 
Straw 
purchase. 
Very 
dangerous. 
This bill addresses that. That is a giant 
step. 
This package also includes additional 
initiatives that will help reduce the 
danger of gun violence across our coun-
try. We are moving toward closing the 
boyfriend loophole: a victory to help 
protect survivors of domestic violence 
and to stop known abusers from acquir-
ing a gun. This has long been a pri-
ority. 
We are strengthening background 
checks for potential buyers under 21, 
which would have applied to the 18- 
year-old gunman at Uvalde. And we are 
making enormous investments in men-
tal health programs, school safety pro-
grams, and community-based violence 
prevention initiatives. 
I mention all these, Mr. Speaker, be-
cause, of course, I have to say that this

bill doesn’t do everything we would 
like to do. We need to do more on back-
ground checks. There is some other 
language that we would like to do in 
terms of background checks not only 
on guns, but perhaps on high-capacity 
armament. 
I say to my colleagues, as I fre-
quently do—but it applies here now 
more than ever: Let us not judge this 
legislation for what is not in it but re-
spect it for what it does. And what it 
does is save lives. And we are very, 
very proud of that. 
Again, I thank Chairman NADLER and 
Gun Violence Protection Task Force 
chairman, MIKE THOMPSON, for their 
determined leadership in bringing this 
legislation to the floor. This package 
represents the most significant action 
to prevent gun violence in nearly three 
decades and is a necessary step to 
honor our solemn duty as lawmakers 
to protect and defend the American 
people. 
Importantly, the bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act has earned strong 
support from gun owners, gun sur-
vivors, and law enforcement alike. 
Gun Owners for Responsible Owner-
ship endorse our bill saying: ‘‘We write 
today as responsible gun owners; but 
above all else, we are proud parents 
and grandparents of toddlers, students, 
and young teachers. We want them to 
be safe.’’ 
Everytown for Gun Safety wrote that 
this ‘‘commonsense legislation address-
es every form of gun violence.’’ 
And the Fraternal Order of Police 
and the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police applauded our bipar-
tisan agreement, calling it a giant step 
forward and one that will save lives. I 
repeat: A giant step forward and one 
that will save lives. The statements are 
from the Fraternal Order of Police and 
the International Association of Chiefs 
of Police. 
Indeed, keeping our children safe is a 
unifying issue for our country, and it 
must be a unifying issue in this Con-
gress. 
Yesterday, our Nation watched in 
horror as a radical partisan super-
majority of the Supreme Court ruled to 
flood America’s streets with even more 
deadly weapons. 
It is unconscionable that as America 
reaches a fever pitch of gun violence, 
the Court has chosen to create a new 
right to bring guns into public spaces, 
while hindering the ability of States to 
stop the bloodshed. In doing so, the 
GOP supermajority, Trump-McConnell 
Court, is implicitly endorsing the trag-
edy of mass shootings and daily gun 
deaths plaguing our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, with this bipartisan 
package, we take the first steps to 
fight back on behalf of the American 
people who desperately want new meas-
ures to keep communities safe in the 
high numbers in the polling. 
Our Democratic House majority has 
again and again passed landmark legis-
lation that would combat the scourge 
of gun violence, and we will never give 
up in our fight to save lives 
Mr. Speaker, our fight to prevent gun 
violence is of, by, and for the children. 
Of the children, because they are suf-
fering. It is heartbreaking that in 
America more children die from guns 
than any other cause. 
By the children, because they are 
leading. We see the children marching 
in the streets, testifying before Con-
gress, demanding action. 
And always for the children, building 
a future where every child can reach 
his or her fulfillment, free from the 
fear of gun violence. 
To the Members who lack the cour-
age to join in this work—to those who 
lack the courage to join in this work— 
I say your political survival is insig-
nificant compared to the survival of 
our children. Today, we will prevail for 
the children. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan ‘‘aye’’ vote for this lifesaving leg-
islation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I will tell 
you what saves lives. The decision we 
got from the Supreme Court today 
saves lives. This bill takes rights away 
from law-abiding citizens, their Second 
Amendment liberties. That is the key 
distinction. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my 
friend, the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, Speaker PELOSI just lectured 
us. She said guns are the number one 
killer of children in America. 
That is not true. Abortion violence is 
the number one killer of children in 
America, until today. There is no right 
to abortion in the Constitution. And, 
thankfully, the Supreme Court finally 
said that decisively. Thanks be to God. 
There is a right, however, a crystal- 
clear right in the Constitution to keep 
and bear arms. But here we are today. 
Congress is moving full steam ahead to 
restrict the right to self-defense for 
law-abiding gun owners and the right 
to due process for all Americans. 
This legislation is the wrong ap-
proach, and we ought to oppose it. 
In our Judiciary markup several days 
ago, some of our Democrat colleagues 
here on the floor today openly said 
they don’t care about the Constitution. 
They don’t care about its protections. 
They want to overlook that. This bill 
does that. It is the perfect example of 
Members of Congress simply ignoring 
the Constitution. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion are already disobeying laws that 
we have on the books to revoke firearm 
dealer licenses over simple clerical er-
rors. This legislation is going to make 
that worse. This is not going to help 
anything. It is going to lead to more 
errors, more false flags, more backlogs 
in the NICS system. There is nothing 
in this bill to fix that. There is nothing 
in this bill to increase school safety. 
Mr. Speaker, we want real solutions. 
We think that we ought to harden the 
schools; real, physical improvements to 
help protect children, but that is not 
here. They didn’t have time for that. 
Two weeks ago, I had a very moving 
conversation with Pastor YJ Jimenez. 
He is a pastor on the ground minis-
tering to the people of the Uvalde com-
munity who have suffered such an un-
speakable loss. He said something that 
was really clear, and I think it is 
echoed throughout America. People 
paid a lot of attention to it. 
He said, You know what, we need to 
address the root causes of all this 
bloodshed. He said America’s problem 
is not guns. America’s problem is a 
heart problem. And he is exactly right. 
Today we are seeing the results of 
decades of decline in the secularization 
of American society and the open as-
sault on our institutions: family, reli-
gion, morality, the breakdown of law 
and order. 
We see the results of all this on 
young people—in clinical settings, in 
schools, and everywhere else. 
We want to do things that matter. 
It is not more gun control. 
It is not more Federal laws. 
It is not more intrusive government. 
We need to address the root causes.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here in the name of Mr. Garza, 
whose daughter in Uvalde bled out, 
Buffalo, Tulsa, Parkland, Santa Fe, 
and Sandy Hook. I stand here with the 
recognition of my chairman, Mr. NAD-
LER, and the years and decades—mine, 
over two decades—of fighting for gun 
laws. 
As I hold up the number of gun laws 
that I introduced over 27 years—pages 
and pages—I can say to the Senate that 
in this bill, the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act, they have built on our 
legislation. 
My bill, the Mental Health Access 
and Gun Violence Prevention Act, 
which will increase access to mental 
health treatment, is in this bill. The 
Violence Against Women Act, the boy-
friend loophole, is in this bill. The Pro-
tecting Our Kids Act and the issues 
dealing with raising the age, bump 
stocks, and ghost guns are yet to be 
done, but we can stand on this because 
it was bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a list of gun violence prevention legis-
lation.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
people are dying every day, and it is 
obvious that through the legislation— 
The New York Times said here are the 
shootings, pages and pages, that could 
have been stopped by stricter gun laws. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this article has the mass shootings 
where stricter gun laws might have 
made a difference. 
We understand that this legislation 
is only the concrete beginning. My 
friends are going to attack that, but 
the American people are 70 percent for 
banning various weapons that are as-
sault weapons. They are 70 percent and 
more for extreme risk protection. They 
are 70 percent and more for under-
standing that we need an extended 
time for purchase of these guns. And, 
yes, they are supporters of the Kim-
berly Vaughn Safe Storage Act, which 
is a storage bill that says that we need 
to get people to prevent suicide and to 
store their guns. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2938, 
the ‘‘Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.’’ 
America is experiencing a crisis of gun vio-
lence. 
In America, gun violence threatens our 
sense of safety and security everywhere we 
go: where we shop for groceries; where we 
worship with our families; and where we enjoy 
movies, dancing, outdoor festivals, and con-
certs with friends. 
I and many other members of Congress 
have introduced commonsense gun safety leg-
islation to make communities safer—over and 
over, year after year, Congress after Con-
gress. Until now, we have been unable to 
pass any meaningful legislation. 
After more than twenty years of drafting and 
repeatedly introducing gun safety legislation, 
like my bill, the Mental Health Access and 
Gun Violence Prevention Act to increase ac-
cess to mental health treatment and promote 
reporting of mental health information to the 
background check system, I am encouraged 
by the steps we are taking today but wish we 
did not have to lose so many lives to reach 
this point. 
For years, I fought to close the boyfriend 
loophole—most 
recently 
in 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2021, 
which passed the House last year. 
Finally, through the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act, we will ensure abusive dating 
partners convicted of misdemeanor domestic 
violence offenses are prohibited from pur-
chasing or possessing firearms for at least five 
years. 
Two weeks ago, this body proved to the 
American people that a compromise could be 
reached on sensible gun safety measures 
when we passed the ‘‘Protecting Our Kids 
Act.’’ That legislation, which I introduced along 
with Chairman JERRY NADLER and Represent-
ative MIKE THOMPSON, encompassed decades 
of our hard work and proved to be the catalyst 
for the bill we are considering today. 
Like the Protecting Our Kids Act, this bill 
would establish new federal offenses that spe-
cifically prohibit gun trafficking and straw pur-
chasing to thwart guns moving through the 
iron pipeline, keeping them off the street and 
out of the hands of criminals. 
While our bill would have raised the age at 
which a person could purchase a semiauto-
matic rifle from 18 to 21—a concept I pro-
posed in my No More Atrocities with Guns Act 
of 2018—this bill would enhance the back-
ground check process and investigative period 
for purchases of rifles by anyone under the 
age of 21 and further strengthen the back-
ground check process by clarifying who is en-
gaged in the business of selling firearms and, 
as a result, is required to run background 
checks. 
We also passed the Federal Extreme Risk 
Protection Order Act of 2021 recently that 
would give loved ones the ability to seek an 
extreme risk protection order before our fed-
eral court when an individual presents a seri-
ous threat to themselves or others by use of 
a firearm and provide funding to enhance, pro-
mote, and implement similar laws at the state- 
level, which Safer Communities will do. 
With the passage of this bill, we make a sig-
nificant step forward in the fight to end gun vi-
olence. But we must keep working to find rea-
sonable solutions to other problems that con-
tribute to gun violence in this country that are 
not addressed in this bill. 
We must ban deadly bump stocks, ghost 
guns, and high-capacity magazines as we en-
deavored to do in the Protecting Our Kids Act. 
We must ban assault weapons. 
We must institute a seven-day waiting pe-
riod for purchases of the deadliest of instru-
mentalities such as silencers and body armor, 
which I have pressed for in my own bill, the 
Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act of 2017 and 2021, 
and assault weapons if we do not ban them. 
We must pass legislation that encourages 
safe firearm storage practices, like my bill the 
Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act 
that was included in the Protecting Our Kids 
Act to expand the requirement that safe stor-
age devices be made available at the point of 
sale, which will train new gun owners on the 
value of safe storage and remind seasoned 
gun owners that safe storage goes hand-in- 
hand with responsible gun ownership. 
23 years after Columbine when I first began 
introducing gun safety legislation, and hun-
dreds of thousands of gun deaths later, we 
continue to mourn the unnecessary loss of life. 
Enough is enough. 
While this bill may not solve all the prob-
lems that contribute to the epidemic of gun vi-
olence, we must pass it without delay. Far too 
many lives have been lost for us to wait any 
longer. 
I support this meaningful, bipartisan legisla-
tion and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Let us save lives and protect the children of 
America—together. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
would inject $4.5 billion in critical funding into 
various state agencies and programs through 
the Department of Justice, Department of 
Health and Human Services, and Department 
of Education to: 
Expand community mental health services 
for children and families, and fund school- 
based mental health services and supports;

Implement evidence-based school violence 
prevention efforts; and 
Encourage and support evidence-based, 
community violence intervention programs and 
crisis intervention services, including the im-
plementation of vital Red Flag Laws—which 
have been proven to reduce the firearm sui-
cide rates in states that have already enacted 
such laws. 
In America, gun violence is the leading 
cause of death among children. In America, 
an average of 70 women are shot and killed 
by an intimate partner every month. In Amer-
ica, mass shootings occur increasingly each 
year—and every day, 316 people on average 
are shot. In America, 45,979 deaths were by 
suicide in 2020—more than half of those 
deaths were by firearm. 
Each day parents send their children off to 
school, from elementary age to college, pray-
ing now more than ever that they will return to 
them safe and sound. 
19 elementary school-aged children and two 
teachers in Uvalde, Texas; 10 people going 
about their daily lives at a market in Buffalo, 
New York, all killed by 18-year-olds wielding 
AR–15–style weapons of war. And 4 people 
murdered at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma 
with another assault weapon purchased only 
hours earlier. 
In my home state of Texas, the El Paso 
Walmart 
shooting—22 
dead; 
Sutherland 
Springs—26 dead; Santa Fe High School—10 
dead; Fort Hood in 2009—13 dead; and the 
Dallas shooting of police—5 officers dead and 
nine others injured. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank God 
for the decision that stops the heinous 
practice that has taken more than 60 
million lives in this country over the 
last 50 years. I thank God that those 
voices that have been lost, we will not 
see that anymore. I hope and pray that 
that is the case. I thank them for that. 
There is no right to take that life, 
but there is a right to defend yourself. 
We have a God-given, constitutionally 
protected right to protect ourselves, 
and the Supreme Court reaffirmed that 
yesterday. 
This bill infringes on the constitu-
tionally protected rights of law-abiding 
Americans, and it provides funding for 
States to infringe on Americans’ Sec-
ond Amendment rights and violate 
their due process rights. 
It treats 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old 
Americans as second-class citizens. The 
Ninth Circuit recently held that the 
Second Amendment applies to 18-, 19-, 
and 20-year-old Americans just like it 
does to Americans over the age of 21. 
This bill criminalizes routine gun 
transactions 
between 
law-abiding 
Americans. 
Justice Alito, in his concurrence, 
highlighted the flawed logic used by 
the supporters of this bill. Alito said: 
‘‘Does the dissent think that laws like 
New York’s prevent or deter such 
atrocities? Will a person bent on car-
rying out a mass shooting be stopped if 
he knows that it is illegal to carry a 
handgun outside the home? And how 
does the dissent account for the fact 
that one of the mass shootings near the 
top of its list took place in Buffalo? 
The New York law at issue in this case 
obviously did not stop that perpe-
trator.’’ 
The essence of this is gun controls do 
not stop criminals because criminals 
have no regard for the law. That is the 
definition of a criminal. 
This bill will restrict law-abiding 
Americans’ ability to purchase fire-
arms and protect themselves and their 
families. It violates a basic God-given 
right. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill and 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN), 
a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this bill. 
My State of California has several 
provisions in law that are included in 
this bill, but it doesn’t work as a 
patchwork 
because 
individuals 
can 
cross State lines and endanger people. 
Everything in this bill is consistent 
with the Second Amendment. That is 
why it got such bipartisan support in 
the Senate. 
In the last 3 years alone, my district 
has had two cities added to the long 
list of communities that have experi-
enced mass shootings. 
America doesn’t have to be the only 
country in the world where mass shoot-
ings are a near-daily occurrence. There 
is broad support in the country for re-
form that will prevent this epidemic of 
gun violence. 
This bill doesn’t do everything that I 
think should happen, but it does some-
thing. It will make people safer. I 
strongly urge its support. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in-
stead of treating law-abiding citizens 
as if they were criminals, maybe we 
should start treating criminals as if 
they were criminals. Stop the plea bar-
gains, put gun predators behind bars 
until they are old and gray, and exe-
cute the murderers. 
Those measures worked until a gen-
eration of soft-on-crime judges, woke 
district attorneys, and politically cor-
rect police commissioners made a 
mockery of our laws. 
If someone is dangerously mentally 
ill, then, of course, they should not 
have access to firearms. They shouldn’t 
have access to any kind of weapons. We 
once confined them so we could treat 
them and prevent them from doing 
harm during the course of their illness. 
We had a commitment process that re-
spected due process. They could come 
before a judge to challenge the findings 
in open court, submit evidence on their 
behalf, and face their accuser, but not 
under the red flag laws this bill pro-
motes. 
An anonymous accuser can trigger a 
secret proceeding against you that you 
don’t even know is happening until the 
police bang on your door in the dead of 
night, ransack your house, and strip 
you of your right of self-defense. The 
burden then falls on you to try to re-
store it. 
This bill also targets young adults 
for special restrictions. We trust them 
to vote, to start families, to enter into 
legally binding agreements, but we 
don’t trust them with firearms because 
of what some criminal or madman 
their age did? 
Just laws hold people accountable for 
their own actions; unjust laws hold 
them accountable for other people’s ac-
tions. This is an unjust law. 
These atrocities will go on until we 
get the criminals and madmen off our 
streets. How many more tragedies do 
we need to go through before the Con-
gress 
understands 
this 
self-evident 
truth? 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, for years, 
the gun violence epidemic in our coun-
try has forced us to cope with immeas-
urable grief and loss. 
Throughout America, many commu-
nities have begun to erect memorials 
to remember those they have lost 
through gun violence. These monu-
ments are not much different than 
those right outside The National Mall 
that honor Americans killed in war. 
Just 
last 
week, 
people 
in 
San 
Bernardino, California, unveiled the 
Curtain of Courage made of steel and 
bronze to pay tribute to the 16 people 
who were murdered at a mass shooting 
there in 2015. 
In Newtown, Connecticut, a planned 
memorial will feature a spiral of gran-
ite inscribed with the names of 20 chil-
dren and 6 teachers killed at Sandy 
Hook Elementary in 2012. 
Memorials are being built or planned, 
as well, to honor those who died in 
shootings in Charleston, Orlando, Las 
Vegas, El Paso, Buffalo, Uvalde, and 
many others. 
The best way to honor those we have 
lost to gun violence, however, is not 
with bronze, steel, or granite. Rather, 
it is with meaningful action to prevent 
others from suffering the same fate. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, which was overwhelmingly passed 
by the United States Senate, and which 
I am pleased to bring to the floor 
today, is a step in the right direction 
to take action. 
This legislation includes measures 
that will reduce the threat of gun vio-
lence and save lives across the country. 
It will help implement red flag laws 
that empower law enforcement officers 
to keep guns out of the hands of people 
at risk of using them to harm them-
selves or others. Closing the so-called 
boyfriend loophole in this bill will pre-
vent people convicted of domestic 
abuse in a dating relationship from 
possessing deadly firearms. If they 
have displayed violence, they ought to 
be prohibited from getting weapons

that will make mass violence more 
probable and possible. It will also re-
quire 
more 
thorough 
background 
checks for Americans under the age of 
21 who seek to purchase a gun. 
We 
passed 
expanded 
background 
checks through this House, and 85 per-
cent of the American people say they 
are for that—and that is the min-
imum—but no action has been taken in 
the United States Senate. They have 
taken some action, and some action is 
better than no action. 
Additionally, 
this 
legislation 
in-
cludes $250 million in funding for com-
munity-based violence prevention pro-
grams. 
Do we not want to see community vi-
olence diminished? 
It will also crack down on those who 
make straw purchases, purchases of 
guns that otherwise, under the existing 
system, could not be purchased by the 
ultimate user of those guns. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator MUR-
PHY, Judiciary Committee Chairman 
JERRY
NADLER, Representative LUCY 
MCBATH, Representative ROBIN KELLY, 
Chairman MIKE THOMPSON of the Gun 
Violence Prevention Task Force, and 
those 
Republicans 
who 
said 
that 
‘‘NRA’’ does not stand for ‘‘no Repub-
lican action.’’ They took action. They 
stood up, even in the face of boos from 
their own party. 
This legislation, as I said, is a step 
forward. That is how we make progress 
in America, a step at a time. 
None of us have had the opportunity 
ever to vote on a perfect bill in this 
House. We vote on good bills that we 
feel will move our country forward. 
This is that kind of bill, a step forward 
but not enough. 
Many of us feel that we need to do 
more. We need to do comprehensive 
background checks. We need to close 
the Charleston loophole. We sent those 
bills to the Senate. 
We can and must do more. 
Yesterday, the Supreme Court issued 
a ruling that will weaken common-
sense gun safety laws all over the coun-
try. Yes, we can return to the O.K. Cor-
ral and everybody having a six-shooter 
on their hip. Anybody who thinks that 
would make us a safer, more civil com-
munity I think is sadly mistaken. That 
fact ought to disturb all of us very 
deeply. 
The Court’s decision to make it even 
easier for bad actors to carry dan-
gerous concealed guns without restric-
tions should serve as a reminder that 
we need to take additional active steps 
to protect our communities and our 
kids, actions that are supported by the 
overwhelming majority of the Amer-
ican people. 
If we fail to do that, if we allow this 
legislation to be the end instead of the 
beginning, parents will continue to re-
ceive that dreaded, unfathomable call 
that they will never see their children 
again, and new monuments honoring 
victims will continue to pop up in com-
munities across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my House col-
leagues, Republicans and Democrats, 
conservatives and liberals, we don’t 
need additional memorials. We need ac-
tion, and we need new laws. 
If we can follow today’s legislation 
with action on comprehensive back-
ground checks and further gun safety 
measures, 
however, 
future 
genera-
tions—perhaps it is not guaranteed, 
but it is certainly worth the effort to 
reduce the gun violence and to reduce 
the need for memorials. 
b 1200 
If we do not, then those who come 
after will wonder why their forebears 
allowed such violence to be perpetrated 
uniquely in America. 
Mr. Speaker, you don’t find this in 
other countries—democratic countries 
and free countries—that protect indi-
vidual rights. 
Mr. Speaker, today, in just a few 
minutes, let us begin to end the cycle 
of tragedy and inaction. Let us pass 
this bill and say: No more. 
Let us pass it and then do more. Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Today, the United States Supreme 
Court stood up in defense of the Con-
stitution in recognizing that it is the 
people—the people—who should be able 
to come together and make decisions 
about life and to be able to stand up 
and protect the God-given right to life. 
Here today on the floor of this body, 
the people’s House—the so-called peo-
ple’s House—is taking up legislation 
that is in direct conflict with the 
United States Constitution, our Bill of 
Rights, and the right to keep and bear 
arms. It is purposeful. 
Do you know what? 
When our colleagues say things like 
what the President said, that whether 
it is a 9-millimeter pistol or a rifle, I 
am going to continue to push to elimi-
nate the sale of those things. When it 
is Representative MONDAIRE JONES say-
ing 
that 
semi-automatic 
weapons 
would qualify as assault weapons and 
these things should be banned. Or when 
the Democrats tweeted that semi-auto-
matic rifles are weapons of war, then 
we should believe you. 
We should believe you that you want 
to take those weapons. That is what 
you are saying. That is what my col-
leagues are saying. 
Here is the thing: my colleagues say, 
oh, don’t worry, this is just money for 
mental health. 
Do you know what my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle and some 
academics say? 
They have put out stories talking 
about how supposedly conservatives 
are suffering from mental health issues 
and that Republicans have become the 
cult of the mentally ill. 
‘‘Is political conservatism a mild 
form of insanity?’’ writes Psychology 
Today. 
You get article after article. 
What do you think you want to do 
with the mental health money? What 
do you think you want to do? 
You want to come after our ability to 
defend ourselves against the very tyr-
anny you want to undermine by taking 
away the weapons we can use to defend 
ourselves against that tyranny. That is 
the purpose. 
My colleagues on this side of the 
aisle—the handful who are going along 
with it—should be ashamed of them-
selves because right now, today, we 
have a duty to stand up here and de-
fend our right to defend ourselves 
against the very tyranny that you ig-
nore. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, when the 
previous speaker refers to using guns 
to protect tyranny, he is talking— 
whether he realizes it or not—about 
stopping tyranny by turning those 
weapons against American troops. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), who is the 
chairman of the Gun Violence Task 
Force. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
legislation, the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act. 
While the tragic loss of 19 precious 
children and 2 teachers in Uvalde, 
Texas, and the disgusting racially mo-
tivated slaughter in Buffalo, New York, 
captured the Nation’s attention, we 
know that gun violence survivors and 
their allies across our country have 
been working every day to prevent the 
gun violence that kills 30 people every 
day and over 100 when you factor in ac-
cidents and suicides. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act passes three important tests. It is 
legal, it has the votes, and it saves 
lives. This bill saves lives by targeting 
convicted domestic abusers and felons 
coercing someone to illegally purchase 
a gun for them. This bill saves lives by 
strengthening school safety and mental 
health resources. 
This bill and the millions of gun vio-
lence victims and gun violence sur-
vivors deserve a ‘‘yes’’ vote today from 
every Member in this Chamber. A ma-
jority of Americans and responsible 
gun owners know this bill is important. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, on Feb-
ruary 14, 2018, my community hit the 
depths of despair when 17 innocent peo-
ple 
were 
slaughtered 
at 
Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School. The 
families from Stoneman Douglas who 
lost loved ones have committed them-
selves in so many ways since to help 
get us to this moment. For them, the 
families of Uvalde, Buffalo, Newtown,

and so many families that we all have 
had the opportunity to get to know, 
this day is about them. 
But I finish with this: on the day 
after Parkland, there was a rally in the 
park near the school. The field was 
covered with high school kids who 
came to express themselves. One of 
them came up to me, still with a look 
of shock in her eyes. She grabbed my 
arm, and she said: Congressman, my 
best friend bled out on me. You have to 
do something. 
Today, we do. 
Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘yes’’ to support 
this legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. 
FITZGERALD. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
what a great day for the babies and—as 
the Speaker described it—the Trump- 
McConnell Supreme Court. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to the House amendment to S. 
2938. This bill could have had strong bi-
partisan support if it had focused sole-
ly on mental health and school safety. 
The Supreme Court made it clear yes-
terday that the Second Amendment in-
cludes the right to carry a gun for self- 
defense purposes outside the home. 
This bill flies in the face of that rul-
ing. Specifically, the bill fails to define 
what constitutes a willful violation 
that would warrant a revocation of a 
Federal firearm license. This is espe-
cially important given the Department 
of Justice’s zero tolerance policy and 
the over 500 percent increase in license 
revocation proceedings that have oc-
curred under this administration. 
Current extreme risk protective or-
ders that exist in 19 States do not come 
close to providing adequate due process 
protections. We cannot support the use 
of taxpayer funds to implement more 
such unconstitutional laws without 
specific and ironclad assurances that 
due process rights will be protected. 
In the wake of the tragic shooting at 
Stoneman Douglas High School in Feb-
ruary 2018, I worked with my col-
leagues in the Wisconsin legislature to 
protect against school shootings. We 
worked to pass Act 143 which appro-
priated $100 million in school safety 
grants. That is where this bill should 
be going. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
focus on bipartisan solutions that will 
not infringe on our constitutional 
rights. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. LIEU), who is a 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, Democrats 
and Republicans are not the same. 
While Democrats are working to pass 
this gun safety legislation for the peo-
ple, Republicans have whipped their 
Members to oppose it. 
Democrats and Republicans are not 
the same. With the Supreme Court 
handing down radical decisions, you 
have 
extreme 
MAGA 
Republicans 
working to eliminate gun safety laws, 
while Democrats are working to ex-
pand gun safety laws. 
You have extreme MAGA Repub-
licans calling for a nationwide criminal 
abortion ban while Democrats are 
working to preserve Roe v. Wade. 
Democrats and Republicans are not 
the same. I urge all Americans to re-
member that this November. 
Mr. JORDAN. We sure aren’t the 
same, Mr. Speaker. We actually think 
you should protect the sanctity of 
human life, and we so appreciate the 
decision from the Court today. We 
don’t think you should take away 
rights from law-abiding American citi-
zens. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIF-
FANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, America 
does not have a gun problem. America 
has a crime problem. 
Mr. Speaker, law-abiding Americans 
do not want more laws chipping away 
at the Second Amendment. They do 
not want to see their right to bear 
arms eliminated on the installment 
plan. They want prosecutors to pros-
ecute. They want the police to police. 
They want dangerous criminals off the 
streets and behind bars. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. CORREA), who is a 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. 
CORREA. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
in 
Uvalde, Texas, children were killed in 
an elementary school. This is one of 
128—128—mass shootings in America 
over the last 40 years. 
It is time to act. This is not perfect 
legislation. But if we can save one, 
two, three or more lives, then it is our 
responsibility to pass this legislation. 
Our communities are depending on us. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chairman who 
has done so much on this issue for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act. 
More than 15 years ago, I was chair-
man of Fairfax County when the Vir-
ginia Tech tragedy occurred. We buried 
six young people in my community 
that week—six. I am still in touch with 
those families, and the emptiness in 
their souls will never go away. 
Today, we have an opportunity to 
choose: will we protect our children, or 
will we continue to persist in an ab-
stract ideological commitment to an 
absolute reading of the Second Amend-
ment which is false, and a false reading 
of the Constitution. 
We can do something finally. Amer-
ica demands we do something. We need 
to disenthrall ourselves from the gun 
mythology and do the right thing: pro-
tecting our communities and our chil-
dren. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
as a father, a combat veteran, a gun 
owner, and the Representative of a 
community devastated by gun vio-
lence. 
My 
constituents 
are 
family 
and 
friends of those who were killed at Col-
umbine, at the Aurora Theater, at 
STEM School Highlands Ranch, and at 
the Boulder King Soopers. As a com-
munity, we consoled each other after 
each one of these terrible shootings, 
and we demanded commonsense re-
form, but for too long our Nation’s 
leaders refused to act. 
When I came to Congress I promised 
my constituents that I would fight to 
protect our community from gun vio-
lence. 
Today, I am proud to vote for the 
first comprehensive gun violence pack-
age in 30 years. This bill is a first step. 
It doesn’t have everything we would 
hope for, but it is a step in the right di-
rection. 
Today’s success belongs to every Col-
oradan who turned their hurt into ac-
tion. This long overdue progress is 
theirs. 
Mr. Speaker, I plead with my col-
leagues for a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, may I 
ask how much time remains on each 
side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Each 
side has 161⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act. It is past time 
that Congress take action to end the 
gun violence epidemic that is harming 
communities across the Nation. We 
need to protect all people who are vul-
nerable to gun violence, and this in-
cludes survivors of domestic abuse. 
Existing Federal laws allow abusive 
dating partners to access firearms. 
Known as the ‘‘dating partner loop-
hole,’’ this dangerous gap in Federal 
law puts survivors of domestic abuse at 
risk every day. 
I thank people for including this and 
acknowledging that this is an issue. 
However, it is critical that the Depart-
ment of Justice swiftly issue regula-
tions and definitions pertaining to the 
implementation of the dating partner 
provisions. 
The definition of ‘‘dating relation-
ship’’ in this act is not intended to be 
overly restrictive, and the definition 
should be broadly constructed to cover 
dating relationships as commonly un-
derstood 
in 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Michigan.

June 24, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, inti-
mate partner violence is a serious 
issue, and 50 percent of domestic vio-
lence fatalities are caused by their in-
timate partner. I understand this. I 
lived in it. 
Let’s be clear: this is a significant 
bill. We have made progress, but we 
have more work to do. 
b 1215 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, it is esti-
mated that legal guns save 162,000 lives 
annually and prevent 2.5 million crimes 
a year, or 6,849 crimes every day. By 
their own admission, criminals fear 
armed citizens more than they fear the 
police. 
Up to 90 percent of criminals who 
commit crimes with a gun do not ac-
quire that firearm legally. 
We have serious problems in this 
country involving family, drugs, and 
mental health. Those issues have been 
going in the wrong direction for dec-
ades. Instead of addressing these issues 
head-on, the bill will instead jeopardize 
the right to bear arms for millions of 
law-abiding citizens. 
Decades of Supreme Court precedent 
prevent the government from exer-
cising prior restraint on our First 
Amendment rights to free speech. We 
should not treat the Second Amend-
ment differently. 
The Court just spoke forcefully in 
favor of this right. This body should do 
the same. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of S. 2938, the 
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. 
As we speak, our Nation is being 
wracked by an epidemic of gun vio-
lence. Every year, 40,000 Americans die 
from guns, more than 110 every single 
day, many of them children. We have 
the power to prevent this carnage, but 
for decades, Congress refused to act. 
Well, no more. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect. 
No bill is. But this legislation will save 
lives. Once signed into law, the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act will help 
keep guns out of the wrong hands. It 
will protect survivors of domestic 
abuse by closing the boyfriend loop-
hole. It will crack down on straw pur-
chases and improve background checks 
for people under 21. It will deliver hun-
dreds of millions of dollars for im-
proved mental health services, commu-
nity-based violence prevention initia-
tives, and school safety. 
The issue of gun safety is personal to 
me. It is about time that Congress 
takes action. Let us pass this historic, 
bipartisan bill and send it to the Presi-
dent’s desk today. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this fla-
grantly unconstitutional gun control 
act. This bill is yet another attack on 
our God-given rights to self-defense. 
For instance, the bill would provide 
taxpayer dollars for State-level gun 
confiscations without due process. 
We constantly hear this constant 
theme from the left on how you can’t 
be pro-life and pro-gun, which I think 
is poignant to point out today. For 
those who say you can’t be pro-life and 
pro-gun, why did you send billions of 
dollars of guns to Ukraine to help them 
save their lives against the Russians? 
You sent billions of dollars of guns 
over there so that our soldiers wouldn’t 
have to go over there and fight a war 
to save their lives. Guns save lives, or 
you wouldn’t have been sending the 
money over there. 
Our Founding Father, George Mason, 
who wrote the Virginia Declaration of 
Rights on which our Constitution’s Bill 
of Rights is based, once said: To disarm 
the people is the most effectual way to 
enslave them. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act. 
We are here today to protect our con-
stituents and save lives. We have wait-
ed far too long for this day. 
Elements of my bill, the Prevent Gun 
Trafficking Act, are included in this 
legislation to crack down on the illegal 
gun trafficking and straw purchasing 
that is bringing guns into communities 
across the country. 
I know just how detrimental traf-
ficking can be to a community. Last 
year, in Chicago, a single stolen gun 
was linked to at least 27 separate 
shootings before it was taken off the 
street. Two dozen people were shot dur-
ing its use and two of them killed. 
More than half of guns used in Chi-
cago shootings are brought into the 
city by trafficking. Thank you, Wis-
consin and Indiana. 
We have lost so many people and 
traumatized countless others. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this legislation to help 
make Chicagoland a safer place. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in defense of our Constitution 
today, in defense of law-abiding Amer-
ican citizens, and against this Senate 
gun control bill. 
This legislation takes the wrong ap-
proach in attempting to curb violent 
crimes. It turns our system of due 
process on its head. You will now be 
found guilty and your guns taken away 
until you can prove your innocence. 
It has vague language containing in-
sufficient guardrails to keep guns out 
of the hands of criminals or prevent 
mass violence. 
It creates a de facto waiting period 
for up to 10 business days for legal, 
law-abiding citizens’ firearm purchases 
and the consideration of whether an 
adult 
purchaser’s 
juvenile 
record 
should prohibit an individual from buy-
ing a firearm. 
We are committed to identifying and 
solving the causes of violent crimes 
and mental health crises, putting offi-
cers in our schools, and reinforcing our 
school buildings, but we must not in-
fringe upon the Second Amendment 
rights of law-abiding citizens while 
doing so. 
I cannot support this misguided leg-
islation, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Ms. 
SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, today 
has been a tough day as we watch an 
extremist 
and 
politicized 
Supreme 
Court roll back protections Americans 
have relied on for decades. But there is 
good news coming out of Congress. We 
have come together to pass the most 
comprehensive gun safety package in 
almost three decades. 
In New Jersey, we have already 
passed a large number of these pro-
posals, including extreme risk protec-
tions, assault weapons safeguards, and 
high-capacity magazine prohibitions, 
and we have seen the results. 
New Jersey has made major progress 
in combating gun violence. As of 2020, 
my State has the third lowest level of 
firearm mortality, according to the 
CDC. Think about that. The most 
densely populated State in the Nation 
has one of the lowest levels of gun vio-
lence in the Nation. As the rate of gun 
deaths has increased by 33 percent na-
tionwide, in New Jersey, it actually 
fell by 10 percent. 
Of course, as a mother, I am focused 
on keeping our kids safe. This law 
would have prevented the shooter in 
Uvalde from getting a firearm without 
an enhanced background check. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from New Jersey. 
Ms. 
SHERRILL. 
This 
law 
gives 
States the support they need to act 
when a mom worries that her child is 
contemplating suicide. 
It is why everyone from the Amer-
ican Society of Pediatrics to the Fra-
ternal Order of Police has endorsed this 
bipartisan bill. 
It is time for my Republican col-
leagues to put our Nation’s kids ahead 
of the gun lobby. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Ohio, soon to be the Ju-
diciary chair, for yielding. 
First, thank you to the Supreme 
Court for removing the curse of abor-
tion sanctioned by a Federal Court rul-
ing back in 1973. Six Supreme Court 
Justices have stood for life, and that is 
a beautiful thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5911 
June 24, 2022 
Now, regarding this gun control bill 
before us today, this bill would have 
done nothing to curb the actions of il-
legal-minded criminals intent on harm-
ing our children. But it will harm the 
law-abiding citizens of this great Na-
tion by violating their Second, Fourth, 
Fifth, and 14th Amendments, specifi-
cally, their due process rights. Let me 
refresh our collective memories. 
The Fourth Amendment: ‘‘The right 
of the people to be secure in their per-
sons, 
houses, 
papers, 
and 
effects, 
against unreasonable searches and sei-
zures, shall not be violated.’’ 
The Fifth Amendment: ‘‘No person 
shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law.’’ 
The 14th Amendment: ‘‘Nor shall any 
State deprive any person of life, lib-
erty, or property, without due process 
of law.’’ 
Then, of course, my favorite, the Sec-
ond Amendment: ‘‘The right of the peo-
ple to keep and bear arms shall not be 
infringed.’’ 
These red flag laws enable one-sided 
ex parte hearings, and though they 
don’t take some of the guns from all of 
the people, they take all of the guns 
from some of the people. This is com-
pletely unacceptable. 
I stand against it, and I encourage all 
Members of the House to vote against 
it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, today, 
June 24, 2022, marks 30 years to the day 
that my father was shot and killed by 
senseless gun violence. So, I stand here 
emotional as I prepare to cast a vote in 
favor of the Bipartisan Safer Commu-
nities Act, historic legislation that will 
reduce crime and break the cycle of vi-
olence that so many people throughout 
our country have unfortunately experi-
enced. 
One of the most important provisions 
in this bill is $2 billion in funding for 
antiviolence programs, including $250 
million for community violence inter-
vention from my Break the Cycle of Vi-
olence legislation. 
Every day, 110 Americans are killed 
with guns, and over 200 are shot and 
wounded. Amid the global pandemic, 
homicides by gun increased by 35 per-
cent. 
Today, gun violence remains the 
leading cause of premature death for 
Black men, as well as the number two 
cause of premature death for Latino 
men and Black women. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Nevada. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Today, I am casting 
my vote for my father; the 58 victims 
who lost their lives during the 1 Octo-
ber 
shooting 
in 
Las 
Vegas; 
Sean’Jerrion Coleman, a constituent 
and a Las Vegas youth leader; and so 
many other Americans who are victims 
and survivors of gun violence. 
I urge this body to pass the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP), my friend. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, in Dobbs earlier this great 
morning, and in the New York State 
RPA decision yesterday, the Supreme 
Court declared something astonishing, 
which has electrified the country and 
left radicals seething: The Constitution 
means what it says. 
In New York State RPA, the Court 
reiterated what Heller decided in 2008. 
To paraphrase, the decision said: Like 
we told you the first time, the Second 
Amendment protects an individual, 
fundamental right weighed and decided 
upon by the people at the founding. 
But just as most of the courts of ap-
peals flouted Heller by reweighing that 
right over and over for more than a 
decade, the Senate again flouts the new 
decision before the ink is dry. 
What is the historical analog from 
the founding era under which the right 
to bear arms could be targeted for com-
plete deprivation upon less than com-
plete process rights? Name it. Name 
the historical analog. That is Congress’ 
burden. 
The renewed assault on the Second 
Amendment is more than sufficient 
grounds to oppose this bill, but even 
the constitutionally permissible com-
ponents repeat the terrible misjudg-
ment that has afflicted this type of leg-
islation for far too long. 
I have said before that you are not 
grappling with the issue: 60 years of 
targeted destruction of the American 
culture 
by 
the 
secular 
and 
postmodernist left. Foremost in that 
destruction has been the unrelenting 
assault on the family. 
So what does this ‘‘do something’’ 
bill do? 
It displaces families further by build-
ing a massive new mental health deliv-
ery bureaucracy into public school 
agencies; it connects Medicaid and 
CHIP directly to schools for early and 
periodic 
screening, 
diagnostic, 
and 
treatment services in schools; and it 
supports the provision of culturally 
competent and trauma-informed care 
in school settings. 
b 1230 
Americans who have been watching 
will hear a familiar refrain in that jar-
gon. It means beyond the reach of par-
ents and the reach of common sense. 
Who is it that is delivering this dou-
ble down on woke to your child at 
school? Republican Senators. 
Moms and dads across the country, if 
you thought that Washington has 
heard you loud and clear, you are sore-
ly mistaken. 
Washington has yet to recognize that 
it is the author of the devastation we 
confront, and Washington is still fail-
ing to grapple with the core issue. 
They are taking another step down the 
long path we have trod that has trans-
formed America just as they want. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this bill is, at the same time, 
an attack on constitutional rights and 
a dangerous, poorly thought out, ill-de-
fined improvisation. 
Wringing your hands and doing some-
thing instead of the right thing will 
continue having the same result it has 
had since the 1960s. 
Show that honesty and courage does 
not reside only in the Supreme Court 
building across the street. Defeat this 
bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. CLARKE), from the great Em-
pire State. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today as a proud New 
Yorker deeply troubled by the epi-
demic of gun violence that has plagued 
our Nation for too long, leaving a wake 
of sorrow and grief that extends from 
generation to generation. 
I cannot overstate how yesterday’s 
reckless 
and 
detrimental 
Supreme 
Court ruling that struck down a 100- 
year-old New York State law puts in-
nocent Brooklynite lives at risk. 
What is more, there are no gun man-
ufacturers in New York City. Yet, de-
spite removing thousands of guns from 
our streets, illegal guns are arriving by 
car, train, and bus every single day 
through the Iron Pipeline. 
That is why today’s vote on the Safer 
Communities Act is an imperative. It 
addresses the issue of straw purchasing 
and the gun trafficking that is preva-
lent across New York City. 
Let me take this opportunity to 
thank and give honorable mention to 
Congresswoman ROBIN KELLY and Con-
gresswoman LUCY
MCBATH
for their 
courageous and unwavering fight to 
stop this sea of gun violence in our Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, we must pass common-
sense gun legislation, and I am proud 
to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. 
JORDAN, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to this anti-Second Amendment 
legislation. I know firsthand how im-
portant firearm ownership and the Sec-
ond Amendment are for self-defense. 
Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, I was in the 
batter’s box at a baseball field in Vir-
ginia, practicing for our Congressional 
Baseball Game, when a deranged gun-
man tried to kill us because we were 
Republicans. 
The attack would have been a mas-
sacre if not for the armed U.S. Capitol 
Police Officers, my heroes, David Bai-
ley and Crystal Griner, who were there. 
The actions on that field that day so-
lidified my support for the Second 
Amendment. Remember, Mr. Speaker,

this gunman wanted to settle his polit-
ical differences with us, who were try-
ing to fix a broken healthcare system, 
with bullets on a baseball field. 
It is not what we do in the United 
States of America, but that day, my 
thought was, I wish I had my firearm 
to protect myself. 
We don’t need more laws and restric-
tions that make it more difficult for 
law-abiding, gun-owning citizens to ex-
ercise their constitutional rights and 
protect their families. 
We need to support law enforcement 
and get tough on criminals who steal 
guns and commit violent crimes and 
further improve mental health pro-
grams. 
I am a proud gun owner. I am a con-
cealed carry licensee and a strong sup-
porter of our Second Amendment. I al-
ways have and always will work to pre-
serve the Second Amendment for law- 
abiding, American citizens. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this attack 
to undermine the Second Amendment. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time remains on each side, 
please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 9 minutes. 
The gentleman from Ohio has 7 min-
utes. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this gun bill today. After 
decades of inaction and too many inno-
cent lives lost to senseless gun vio-
lence, this is a step we must all take. 
It will provide needed resources for 
violence intervention, school safety, 
mental health funding, community vio-
lence intervention and prevention ini-
tiatives, school safety, and yes, en-
hanced background checks to make it 
harder for 18- to 21-year-olds to get 
guns, and it will close the boyfriend 
loop. 
To everybody who is saying no, go 
tell that to the children and families 
that lost lives. This bill will keep dan-
gerous weapons out of the hands of peo-
ple. Go tell your ‘‘no’’ vote to the fami-
lies and the children who lost lives. 
The compromise bill today, it is not 
perfect, but it will help us save lives. I 
am proud that the Congressional Black 
Caucus had a large role to play in this. 
I thank Congresswomen MCBATH and 
KELLY and Congressman HORSFORD for 
their support. Our power, our message. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair reminds Members to direct their 
remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to my friend, the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, no one on 
that side of the aisle cares more about 
the lives lost than the people on this 
side of the aisle. We are as heartbroken 
as anyone is. We are trying to find a 
balance between the thing that we 
have all agreed and swore an oath to 
uphold and defend, the rights granted 
by God enshrined in our Constitution 
and weigh that—and weigh that—with 
keeping our community safe. 
Ladies and gentlemen, our society 
has a sickness. That is for sure. The 
laws passed in this House to restrict 
people from their constitutional, God- 
given rights that criminals disobey is 
not going to change that. It is not 
going to change that. 
We can do something great here 
today. We could. We could do some-
thing great in this body, Mr. Speaker, 
but we are not going to. 
We are going to infringe on the rights 
of the law-abiding who want to defend 
themselves for the sake of the crimi-
nals who refuse to follow the law. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. MEEKS). 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am pray-
erful today, and finally today, that I 
can come on the floor of the House and 
say to the victims of gun violence and 
say to those who lost their lives, and to 
their families, that I can be on the 
floor of the House today, not just say-
ing, I give you my thoughts and my 
prayers; not just saying, I want to send 
to you my sympathies. 
I can’t tell you how tired I have been 
coming to the floor, feeling hurt in my 
heart, and all I could say is thoughts 
and prayers. 
Today I can vote on something that 
is going to make a meaningful dif-
ference to each and every one of them. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from New Mexico (Ms. LEGER 
FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding time. 
Across this country, we shed tears for 
the children who are killed, for the par-
ents who are killed, for the girlfriends 
who are killed. 
In this Chamber, we shed tears for 
the parents and the fathers who are 
killed, for the children and the sons 
who are killed. 
But we cannot only grieve. We can-
not only give our tears. We must act, 
and today we get to act. Today is the 
first step toward addressing the pan-
demic of violence and suffering at the 
loss of life to guns, to gun violence. 
New Mexico already has passed simi-
lar laws. We believe in protecting our 
children. We believe in protecting our 
women. Those who oppose this law 
clearly do not. 
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus 
understands that Latinos are too often 
killed by guns, but today, today, we 
act. I stand up in support of this action 
because not acting is an insult to the 
vast majority of our constituents who 
want this. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New York (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the leading cause of death of 
kids in America is now gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, 110 Americans die every 
day in America because of gun vio-
lence. 
Five weeks ago, ten people from my 
community of Buffalo, New York, were 
shot dead by a white supremacist who 
planned an attack, drove 300 miles to 
Buffalo and a Black community of our 
city. 
There was a retired police officer by 
the name of Aaron Salter. A 30-year 
veteran of the Buffalo Police Depart-
ment, he was working security that 
day. 
Someone once said that the best way 
to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good 
guy with a gun. Officer Aaron Salter 
was a good guy with a gun, but he 
didn’t stand a chance. He didn’t stand a 
chance because he was outgunned and 
outequipped. 
Our police officers in America, in 
Buffalo, and throughout the country 
are outgunned by the bad guys. They 
are outprotected by the bad guys. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER). 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, when I 
first took office in March of 2008, one of 
my first official acts was to attend me-
morial services for the 17 students 
killed and injured in the mass shoot-
ings at Northern Illinois University. 
In the 14 years since, I have at-
tempted to comfort families in my 
communities again and again, suffering 
from gun violence like incidents of the 
shooting at Henry Pratt. 
But until today, we had nothing to 
offer them but our thoughts and pray-
ers. What we are going to pass today 
may not be enough, but it is a start. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. MASSIE), the co-chair of the 
Second Amendment Caucus. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding 
time. 
The Democrats today describe this 
Senate bill as a step forward. If you are 
saving lives, it is a step backward, 
folks. If you are banning guns, it is a 
small step forward. Yes, in fact, it is. 
Almost everybody on the other side 
of the aisle today said, it doesn’t go far 
enough. What do they mean? Well, it is 
a red flag law bill, and they want to 
take all of the guns from some of the 
people. 
It doesn’t go far enough for them be-
cause it doesn’t yet take all of the guns 
from all of the people. That is their 
goal. 
Who has taken a step forward, which 
institution, which branch of govern-
ment? Well, actually, if you are count-
ing how many lives are going to be 
saved, you have to consider that the 
Supreme Court is the institution, the 
branch of government, that has taken 
two steps forward in the last 48 hours 
to save lives. 
One of those steps was to reaffirm 
the Heller decision that men and

women in this country have the right 
to defend their own lives. 
The second step taken today was to 
affirm that the State legislatures have 
the right to defend the lives of the un-
born. 
This bill is ineffective, unconstitu-
tional, and ill-conceived without con-
sideration for the dangerous unin-
tended consequences. 
Did the drafters consider that chang-
ing the definition of ‘‘gun dealer’’ to be 
more ambiguous is going to make 
every American a gun dealer when they 
transfer a gun to a friend or a family 
member? 
Did the Senators consider in their 
sleep deprivation when they drafted 
this bill hurriedly, late at night, that 
using childhood mental health records 
as a basis for denying adults their basic 
rights to self-defense is going to dis-
courage many parents from seeking 
mental health care for their children? 
If children who need it go without 
mental health care and early interven-
tion, their conditions will grow worse. 
We will see more suicides, and we will 
see more mass shootings. Unfortu-
nately and inevitably, this bill will 
cost more lives than it will save. 
Red flag laws are going to have the 
same effect that considering mental 
health care for children will have. Peo-
ple will not seek mental health care, 
and we will see more damage to the 
American public. 
If politicians here were serious—and 
they are not serious. They are going to 
come back. They will be back. 
You will be back here in 6 months, a 
year. You will want another bite at the 
apple to ban guns because this bill 
won’t do it. This bill won’t do what you 
say. 
If you were serious, you would ac-
knowledge that 96 percent of mass pub-
lic shootings happen in an area where 
guns are banned, and they would repeal 
the prohibitions that keep law-abiding 
citizens from exercising their God- 
given rights enshrined in the Second 
Amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
b 1245 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. GOMEZ). 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act in honor and memory of 
one of my constituents who was killed 
in the Las Vegas mass shooting in Oc-
tober 2017, Michelle Vo. 
I also rise in the memory of the kids 
who were killed in Uvalde, Texas, in 
Parkland, in Sandy Hook. 
I rise in their memories, and I also 
rise due to the fact that I will have a 
newborn child on August 8. That child, 
in a few years, will be going off to 
school, and I will be worried about that 
child being put in danger because he is 
going off to school when there are mass 
shootings across this country. 
I rise in support of this because it is 
a small step forward to prevent the loss 
of life. 
In the end, it comes down to one sim-
ple question, as my colleague from 
northern California posed: Are you 
with the kids, or are you with the kill-
ers? Are you with the victims, or are 
you with the killers? 
I choose the victims; I choose the 
kids; and I choose the countless lives 
we will save because we will pass this 
law. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER). 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, 
let’s start with the beginning of the 
Constitution: ‘‘We the people of the 
United States, in order to form a more 
perfect Union, establish justice, ensure 
domestic tranquility, provide for the 
common defense, promote the general 
welfare . . .’’ 
That is how our Constitution starts, 
to uphold the premise of the Declara-
tion of Independence, of freedom to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
This bill helps us move forward be-
cause it helps us with life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
My friend complains about the red 
flag rule. It helps us with those individ-
uals who suffer from domestic violence 
and who have suicidal ideation, but it 
also helps the families destroyed at 
Columbine in my area and at the Au-
rora movie theater. 
This bill that I am so happy to ad-
vance today is pro-Constitution, pro- 
freedom, and pro-liberty. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, experi-
ence has taught me when you have to 
say a bill is constitutional, it is prob-
ably not. When you have to say a bill 
adheres to due process, it probably 
doesn’t. And this bill certainly doesn’t. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I stand here 
in strong support of the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act. 
It was just 1 year ago when a young 
man went into the store, bought a gun, 
and, just hours later, went to an Asian 
spa in the Atlanta, Georgia area to 
murder Asian women. Then, he drove 
27 miles away to two more Asian spas 
to kill more Asian women. In all, he 
killed eight people, including six Asian 
women. 
They were mothers, grandmothers, 
daughters, and I will never forget the 
tears and sobs of their loved ones when 
we went down to Georgia to visit. 
To see that again in Buffalo and 
Uvalde, where families had their lives 
ripped apart in an instant, is more 
heartache than our country can bear. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act is an important step forward. 
There will be enhanced background 
checks for gun purchasers under 21. It 
provides funds for States for red flag 
laws. It closes the boyfriend loophole. 
This bill will save lives. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this legislation. 
Proponents say that this bill doesn’t 
violate due process. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
You haven’t been charged with a 
crime, but there is a hearing, a hearing 
that you are not allowed to be at. You 
can’t be present at a hearing where you 
don’t have a lawyer and a hearing 
where a judge can take your property. 
Again, just to underscore this, you 
haven’t been charged with a crime, but 
there is a hearing where your property 
and your rights are at stake. 
You are not allowed to be there; your 
lawyer is not allowed to be there; and 
you can’t confront your accuser. But 
they can take your gun; they can take 
your property; and they can take your 
Second Amendment liberty. 
Here is the scariest part of all: As my 
friend from Kentucky just pointed out, 
the Democrats say this is just the first 
step, that this doesn’t go far enough. 
Holy cow. So that kind of proceeding 
doesn’t go far enough when it comes to 
your Second Amendment liberties? 
One of the key things that separates 
this great Nation from all other coun-
tries is how we have due process in our 
justice system. This bill takes it away. 
No other way to put it. 
You can say all day long that it 
doesn’t violate due process, but as I 
said just a few minutes ago, every time 
I hear that, experience has taught me 
that it most certainly does. When you 
have to say it, it probably does. In this 
case, it is certainly violating due proc-
ess. There are other problems, but for 
that reason alone, we should vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Again, the scariest thing of all is 
that they are saying: ‘‘Oh, this is just 
the first step. This doesn’t go far 
enough.’’ Imagine where they want to 
take us. 
Their beef is with the Second Amend-
ment. They want it to go away. Don’t 
let it happen. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the difference between 
this country and other countries is 
only that in this country do we have 
mass shootings and mass murders of 
children. No other country has them. 
We know from the experience in New 
Jersey, as Ms. SHERRILL told us, that 
when we pass strong gun control legis-
lation, we can greatly reduce the num-
ber of children and adults shot. 
We hear from the other side of the 
aisle, ‘‘No, we don’t want to do that.’’ 
They are right: This legislation is the 
beginning. 
This legislation is not perfect. It is a 
bipartisan compromise. It is not nearly 
what we should do. It is not nearly 
what the House did, but it is a begin-
ning. It is a beginning in saving lives in 
this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5914 
June 24, 2022 
Anyone who stands in its way is 
standing in the way of saving lives in 
this country. I will not allow myself or 
anyone I associate with to stand in the 
way of saving lives, many lives. 
Again, I remind you, this is the only 
country that has it, and it is not be-
cause we have more mentally ill than 
other countries. It is because we do not 
have the gun control laws that other 
countries do. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote 
for this bill as a good beginning, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr, Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, long overdue legislation to address gun 
violence in our schools and neighborhoods. 
Although this legislation is far from perfect, it 
is an important step forward in solving the epi-
demic of gun violence that has gripped our 
Nation for decades. 
In the weeks following the tragedy in Uvalde 
at Robb Elementary and the racist attack at a 
grocery store in Buffalo, I spoke with many 
constituents who continue to urge action. 
Teachers, parents, and concerned community 
members from Northwest Oregon shared 
pleas for Congress to follow through on our 
responsibility to our children and our Nation by 
immediately passing bold policies to imple-
ment gun safety reform. An educator I know 
told me that after Uvalde, she sat down with 
her students and told them she would take a 
bullet for them. Conversations like this are 
happening in classrooms across the country, 
but they shouldn’t have to. Congress must 
provide all students with safe learning environ-
ments free from the threat of gun violence. 
The House already passed a comprehensive 
slate of gun violence prevention legislation, 
and I look forward to building on that by voting 
for this legislation that came out of the bipar-
tisan Senate negotiations. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will 
help to protect Americans and make gun sales 
safer. The most effective way to protect com-
munities from gun violence is to keep guns out 
of the hands of individuals who are a danger 
to themselves and others. This legislation will 
incentivize states to establish extreme risk 
protection order laws, enhance background 
checks for people under the age of 21, end 
straw purchasing, and penalize gun traffickers. 
It will also safeguard survivors of domestic vio-
lence by closing the so-called ‘‘boyfriend loop-
hole,’’ prohibiting people convicted of domestic 
violence crimes from possessing firearms. 
Additionally, this bill makes a robust invest-
ment in Student Support and Academic En-
richment Grants under Title IV–A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act. Fully funding this im-
portant grant program will help to close the 
opportunity and resource gaps in our Nation’s 
public schools, and I’m pleased this bill recog-
nizes the importance of this program in pro-
viding students of all backgrounds with a well- 
rounded, safe, and healthy education. 
Although these actions to address gun vio-
lence in our communities and fund critical 
school improvement programs are important, I 
am concerned about how various provisions in 
the bill could harm Black and brown students 
and students with disabilities in our Nation’s 
schools. The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act increases funding for school resource offi-
cers (SROs) and codifies further involvement 
of the Department of Homeland Security in 
education through threat assessments. Re-
search and practice show that both SROs and 
threat assessments are ineffective in keeping 
students safe in schools. As Chair of the Civil 
Rights and Human Services Subcommittee, I 
remain committed to protecting students’ civil 
rights and delivering on the promise of an eq-
uitable, world-class public education for each 
and every student in this country. I will closely 
monitor the implementation of this legislation 
to make sure our most marginalized and vul-
nerable students are not subject to further dis-
proportionate discipline and discriminatory tar-
geting in schools. 
As a member of the Gun Violence Preven-
tion Taskforce, I again want to recognize how 
crucial the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act 
is to our schools, communities, and country. 
This bill will be the first substantive action on 
gun violence prevention since the passage of 
the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 
1994. In the last 30 years, our Nation has 
been devastated over and over again by hor-
rific tragedies like we saw in recent weeks at 
Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. We can-
not bring back those who have been mur-
dered, but we can enact meaningful laws that 
will prevent more senseless deaths. 
I urge swift passage of the legislation. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to enter 
into a colloquy with my esteemed colleague 
from California, Congressman MIKE THOMP-
SON, regarding the S. 2938, Bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act. 
Mr. THOMPSON, is it your understanding and 
intent in supporting this bill that the Depart-
ment of Justice promulgate regulations per-
taining to Section 12005? 
Is it further your understanding and intent in 
supporting this bill that the Department of Jus-
tice in those regulations define the meaning of 
the terms ‘serious,’ ‘continuing,’ ‘recent,’ and 
‘recently?’ 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
the Congresswoman from Michigan, DEBBIE 
DINGELL, is correct. It is the intent that the De-
partment of Justice promulgate regulations to 
govern the application of Section 12005, in-
cluding defining the terms ‘serious,’ ‘con-
tinuing,’ ‘recent,’ and ‘recently.’ It is the intent 
that this law capture dating relationships in the 
way they happen in the lives of victims of dat-
ing violence. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am glad for 
the clarification from the gentleman from Cali-
fornia and pleased to know it is the legislative 
intent that the Department of Justice promul-
gate regulations to govern the application of 
section 12005, including defining the terms 
‘serious,’ ‘recent,’ and ‘recently.’ A consistent 
and authoritative interpretation of these terms 
that is reflective of the lived experiences of 
survivors of dating violence is critical to the 
successful implementation of this section. 
Rulemaking is necessary to both ensure 
that in its application, the law actually protects 
victims of dating violence and to stave off 
chaos. A lack of clearly defined terms will en-
courage trial level litigation into the specifics of 
the intimate relationship. State judges who are 
adjudicating these cases will be determining 
the relationship between the victim and the 
perpetrator based on the laws of their state. 
The introduction of ‘serious,’ ‘continuing,’ and 
‘recent’ should not be read to require judges 
to include specific findings of seriousness or 
continuity. Instead, the existence of a dating 
relationship must be determined based on the 
enumerated factors set forth in subparagraph 
(B) of this section, with the acknowledgment 
that a finding of a dating relationship under a 
state law with a definition that is substantially 
similar to federal law constitutes a finding of 
‘dating relationship’ for the purpose of this 
section. 
For example, in my state of Michigan, the 
term ‘dating relationship’ means ‘frequent, inti-
mate associations primarily characterized by 
the expectation of affectional involvement. 
This term does not include a casual relation-
ship or an ordinary fraternization between two 
individuals in a business or social context.’ 
This very clearly parallels the definition of ‘dat-
ing relationship’ in the Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act, and a finding of a ‘dating rela-
tionship’ under Michigan law must constitute a 
finding of a ‘dating relationship’ for the pur-
poses of this section. 
The 
Bipartisan 
Safe 
Communities 
Act 
shrinks the dating loophole, but it does not 
eliminate it. I will keep leading the fight to fully 
close it in future legislation. No dating abuser 
who has shown by his actions that he poses 
a danger to his victim, whose actions led to 
the issuance of a protective order after a hear-
ing, should be legally allowed to possess fire-
arms for the duration of the order. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I associate myself with the comments of my 
esteemed colleague from Michigan. Under 
California law, ‘dating relationship’ means fre-
quent, intimate associations primarily charac-
terized by the expectation of affectional or 
sexual involvement independent of financial 
considerations. Similar to the law in Michigan, 
the law in California very clearly parallels the 
definition of ‘dating relationship’ in the Bipar-
tisan Safer Communities Act, and it is my in-
tent and understand in voting for this bill that 
a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of do-
mestic violence against a dating partner under 
California law is sufficient to trigger the ex-
panded dating violence prohibitor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1204, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question is on the motion by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

RECOGNIZING ART COMPETITION 
WINNER LIERA BERTOLSIO 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today I welcome Liera 
Bertolsio and her family to Wash-
ington, D.C. to celebrate her great ac-
complishment. 
Liera is the 2022 winner of Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th Congressional District Con-
gressional Art Contest. 
The annual art competition, orga-
nized by the Congressional Institute, 
showcases the creative talents of high 
school students from across every con-
gressional district in the country. 
Liera has just finished her sophomore 
year at Forest Hills High School lo-
cated in Sidman, Pennsylvania. Her 
work ‘‘Girl with Pearl Earring’’ is an 
acrylic painting on canvas. 
This year, 81 students entered Penn-
sylvania’s 15th Congressional District 
art competition. Liera’s work was se-
lected by a panel of independent 
judges. The 2022 competition had our 
largest number of entries to date. 
All the winning pieces from around 
the country will be displayed for the 
year in the Cannon tunnel where they 
will be viewed by Members of Congress, 
staff, and those who visit the Capitol 
every day. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratu-
late Liera on her remarkable achieve-
ment. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s 
an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, at 
this time I am very proud to have a 
dear friend and colleague on the floor 
with me. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
believe we are here today and today is 
a very heavy day for so many of us 
across the country. 
Every single one of us woke up today 
with less rights than we had yesterday. 
Pregnant people, in particular, are in 
more danger in the United States 
today than we were yesterday as a re-
sult of the Supreme Court’s decision to 
overturn Roe v. Wade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5916 
June 24, 2022 
I think what we are experiencing 
here—it is important to tell the truth 
of what is going on. With so many indi-
viduals out here, I think it is impor-
tant for us to also tackle this myth 
that this is somehow about babies or 
children or life because the same indi-
viduals who purport and who claim to 
be protecting life, fight against uni-
versal healthcare. 
Do 
they 
believe 
in 
universal 
childcare? 
Do they believe in life after birth? 
From their policy positions, I assure 
you the evidence is lacking. 
A party and individuals who claim to 
protect the lives of children, just weeks 
after over a dozen children died in 
Texas, now claim to support their life— 
the lives of the young. 
Who are we protecting? 
Who does this protect? 
No one. 
Overturning Roe puts every single 
one of us in danger. What I think many 
of 
our 
colleagues 
perhaps 
haven’t 
quite—or perhaps they have—fully un-
derstood is that this also undermines 
the right to privacy in the United 
States of America. We are here to solve 
this issue. Our job is to develop a path 
forward. In that, we know that this 
House has passed and is willing to cod-
ify Roe. 
What we also need is answers from 
our colleagues in the United States 
Senate. To those Senators who voted 
for these Justices under the claim and 
the guise that this would not happen, 
this decision falls on them. 
What will they do—as they were lied 
to? 
What will they do as a consequence 
of this decision, whether that be Re-
publican or Democrat? 
We cannot allow this to go unan-
swered. We are talking about a court, 
with the majority of Justices ap-
pointed by a party that has not won a 
popular 
Presidential 
election 
more 
than once in 30 years, ruling against 
the majority of Americans. We have a 
Senate that is controlled by minority 
rule. We have a House suffering from 
the impacts of gerrymandering that 
amplifies and undermines our democ-
racy. 
We are in a very dangerous moment, 
not just for women, not just for LGBT 
communities, not just for all of us, but 
we are in a dangerous moment in the 
world because this is not just about the 
right to choose. This is about rule of 
law and democracy, and who is a full 
person in the eyes of the law. 
To all of those who are watching to-
day’s events unfold in fear, in anger, in 
rage, in depression, in anxiety, one 
thing remains steady: that we will not 
stop fighting until this is fixed. I say 
that to my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle. We are not going away. We 
stay. We fight. We push. We will not be 
silenced. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her mes-
sage, and I assure her that I will be 
part of that fight. 
b 1345 
There are some fights that you can-
not escape. I believe that women 
should have the right to choose. It is 
not my choice. It is the choice of the 
woman. I hope that we will see a time 
when the Supreme Court will realize 
that it has made a mistake that has to 
be corrected. 
But today I am here primarily and 
principally to talk about a state of af-
fairs in Texas. Sadly, regrettably, and 
unfortunately, the GOP—the Grand Old 
Party, the party of Lincoln—has degen-
erated and devolved into what I call 
the COT, the cult of Trump. The party 
of Lincoln has devolved into the cult of 
Trump. It is no longer the Lincolnian 
party firmly planted on the bedrock of 
the democratic principles, government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people. It has deteriorated into the 
Trumpian party firmly planted on the 
dubious ground of ‘‘government of 
Trump, by Trump, and for Trump.’’ 
This is best evidenced and evinced by 
juxtaposing the public policy stance 
taken by the GOP with the public pol-
icy stance codified and voted on by the 
Texas Republican Party—the COT, the 
cult of Trump—on June 18, 2022, at 
their party convention in Houston, 
Texas. And juxtaposing, the GOP, the 
party of Lincoln that took a stand and 
fought to keep the Union together, the 
COT, the cult of Trump, has taken a 
stand to secede from the Union lit-
erally. Texas now under Republican 
leadership desires to leave the Union. 
When I say Republican leadership, I 
mean those persons who participated in 
the convention. The Governor sent a 
message and State-elected officials 
were a party to it. Either directly or in 
some vicarious way they were all affili-
ated and associated. They knew about 
this vote that was taken, and either 
they voted for it, or they have acqui-
esced to it. 
The GOP, the party of Lincoln his-
torically, accepted and participated in 
the peaceful transfer of Presidential 
power. The COT, the cult of Trump, re-
jects the certified results of the 2022 
Presidential election and holds that 
President Biden was not legitimately 
elected by the people. This is all news 
that has taken place in the State of 
Texas recently—as of June 18, 2022— 
Texas wanting to leave the Union by 
and through the GOP. 
Now the cult of Trump and also the 
Texas Republican Party indicated that 
President Biden is not the President. 
They went so far as to say that they re-
ject the certified results of the 2022 
Presidential election that holds that 
President Biden was elected but they 
say not legitimately elected. 
Lastly, of the many things that I 
could mention—but it is something 
that is critical to people of color and 
women—the GOP, the party of Lincoln, 
forged the 15th Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution recognizing the right of 
former slaves to vote. Under the hand 
of GOP President George W. Bush, a 25- 
year reauthorization of the Voting 
Rights Act was signed into law. 
On the other hand, the COT, the cult 
of Trump, urges that the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965, codified and updated in 
1973, be repealed and not reauthorized. 
The Texas former Republican Party, 
now the cult of Trump, would repeal 
and not reauthorize the Voting Rights 
Act. 
Should this happen, the gender, com-
plexion, and diversity of the Congress 
will change significantly. 
Here is why: In 1965, when our dear 
colleague and brother, John Lewis, 
crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on 
what we now call Bloody Sunday, when 
he crossed the Edmond Pettus Bridge 
that day, he had to sense what fate was 
awaiting him on the other side of the 
bridge. I am not sure he anticipated it 
would be as dastardly imposed as it 
was. As he approached the bridge—I 
have been to the bridge many times; it 
has a zenith, and it has crest. As you 
approach the crest, Mr. Speaker, you 
can see what awaits you on the other 
side. 
On Bloody Sunday in 1965, peaceful 
protesters were marching from Selma 
to Montgomery. They were peaceful, 
doing no one harm, and simply wanting 
to peacefully demonstrate that they 
were willing to walk to a city that for 
years had been a place where there had 
been persons who were being mis-
treated and not having the opportunity 
to vote as other people were voting. 
But in any event, they were walking, 
and they came upon the police and the 
constabulary on horses. 
I spoke to my friend, John Lewis, 
about this. He said he thought he was 
going to die because they started beat-
ing them. They beat them all the way 
back to the church where they started. 
It was a sad day in history. It was a sad 
day in the history of this country and 
a sad day in the history of the world. 
The camera’s eye caught what was hap-
pening, and it was broadcast around 
the world. 
A President from Texas, Lyndon 
Johnson, wanted to do what he ulti-
mately did. But he didn’t have the mo-
mentum to get it done until Bloody 
Sunday when people saw the meanness, 
the hate, and just the desire to harm 
peaceful people. When they saw all of 
this, it gave him that momentum that 
he had been seeking. I admire him. He 
was able to get the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965 signed. 
That Voting Rights Act of 1965 
changed the diversity in Congress, the 
complexion of Congress, and the agen-
da of Congress. This is the same Voting 
Rights Act, Mr. Speaker, that the cult 
in Texas—the COT, the cult of Trump, 
no longer the Grand Old Party, the 
GOP—they would not reauthorize, they 
would repeal it. 
President Johnson signed the Voting 
Rights Act. At the time he signed it in 
1965 in the 89th Congress, there were 
four Asian Members—four. There were 
four Latino Members, six Black Mem-
bers, and 13 women in the Congress. 
There were four Asians in 1965. Now, 
fast-forward to 2022, the 117th Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5917 
June 24, 2022 
There are 21 Asian Members. Before the 
Voting Rights Act became law, there 
were four. In 2022, there are 21. Before 
the Voting Rights Act, there were four 
Latino Members. In 2022, there are 52. 
The Voting Rights Act has afforded op-
portunities that were not there prior to 
Bloody Sunday. 
There were six Black Members in 
1965. In 2022, there are 61 Black Mem-
bers. I am proud to be one of them—61. 
I would daresay that but for the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, I would not be one 
of the 61. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 
has made a difference in the com-
plexion of Congress. There were thir-
teen women in 1965. In 2022 there are 
151 women. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, when the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 made it possible 
for African Americans to have these 
opportunities, it did open the door for 
others as well. It opened the door for 
people of color. They were not the 
slaves that benefited from the 13th 
Amendment, but they were people who 
benefited from the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. 
It also provided people in my con-
gressional district to have a ballot 
printed in more than one language. 
Houston is a polyglot city. Many lan-
guages are spoken. The ballot in the 
Ninth Congressional District, where I 
am fortunate enough to serve, is print-
ed in four different languages: English, 
Spanish, Vietnamese, and Chinese. The 
Voting Rights Act made that possible. 
It has been reauthorized and amended 
such that language has been made a 
part of the Voting Rights Act giving 
people the opportunity to simply vote 
in a language that they understand. 
Some people would say: Well, they 
should all speak English. 
Well, there are some Native Alaskans 
who don’t necessarily find English as 
their native tongue. They are citizens. 
They ought to be able to vote. They are 
people who acquired citizenship and 
speak another language. They speak 
English well enough to have the kinds 
of conversations that can help in your 
daily life, but when you are casting a 
vote for President of the United States 
or some other public office such as 
judgeships, it would serve people well 
to be able to do this with the language 
they are most comfortable with. Hence, 
we have the ballot in these four lan-
guages. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has 
made, and continues to make, a dif-
ference notwithstanding the fact that a 
significant portion of it has been evis-
cerated. We still have section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act to help prevent in-
vidious discrimination that Texas is 
known for, by the way. Texas is the 
home 
of 
invidious 
discrimination. 
Texas has twice left its place in coun-
tries where slavery was not acceptable. 
Rather than remain, Texas has se-
ceded. Texas left Mexico because of 
slavery, and Texas left the United 
States because of slavery. So the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 has made a dif-
ference. 
But the State of Texas through many 
of its agents, and especially those asso-
ciated with the cult of Trump—for-
merly known as the GOP, the Grand 
Old Party—many of those agents would 
repeal the Voting Rights Act which 
would make a great difference in who 
speaks at this microphone and who 
walks the Halls of Congress. 
It seems that in Texas if you can’t 
conform with the law or you don’t 
want to, then you just simply change 
the law. 
b 1400 
And that is what they seek to do 
now, to change the law, rather than 
allow the diversity to exist that we 
currently see. They would change the 
law and roll back the clock; and I as-
sure you, the diversity that we cur-
rently experience would cease to exist. 
So I am here to say that the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 must be reauthor-
ized. It must be. 
I understand that the Supreme Court 
seems to be hostile to the rights of mi-
norities, 
hostile 
to 
the 
rights 
of 
women. My dear friend, Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, spoke quite eloquently on the 
subject. 
I indicated that this was my last 
topic, as it relates to the cult in Texas, 
but I do have to confess that in Texas, 
the former GOP, now the cult of 
Trump, bans abortions, or would ban 
abortions—this is what they codified 
and 
published—would 
ban 
abortion 
from the moment of fertilization. That 
means that there would be no legal 
abortions in Texas from the moment of 
fertilization. 
I do have sympathy for women who 
are raped. There would be no options, 
from the moment of fertilization. It ap-
pears, at least to some, that this would 
also mean, even if the mother’s life is 
in question. This is as draconian as a 
law can be. 
Women should have the right to 
choose. It is their body. I can have 
opinions, but they have to deal with 
the reality. And it is not an easy re-
ality for many women to confront. 
So this is something they should 
have the opportunity to talk about 
with their most trusted confidantes 
and make hard choices. I don’t wish 
the choice upon anyone, but I do think 
that women ought to have that choice. 
And my hope is that, as I indicated 
earlier, I live long enough to see a Su-
preme Court that will realize that Roe 
v. Wade—the decision in Roe v. Wade 
was a decision that gave women the op-
portunity to make choices that only 
they should have the opportunity to 
make. 
Mr. Speaker, these are some very dif-
ficult times. I see many people cele-
brating. But I also know that when I 
called a friend to discuss this, there 
were many tears being shed. And not 
everybody is happy today. For many 
people, this is a very dark day in the 
life of our country. 
Just yesterday, or the day before— 
the days run together sometimes when 
you are up late—the Supreme Court 
ruled that you can carry your gun 
openly, notoriously. 
I don’t want to live in a world where 
my safety is dependent upon my having 
an automatic Kalashnikov model 47, or 
some replica of an AR–15. I don’t want 
my safety to depend upon my being— 
having the quickest draw. I don’t want 
to resolve my disputes with a gun. 
I just think this is a very difficult 
time for us. And my prayer is that we 
will have persons in the Senate who 
will understand that there is little 
time left for us to make a difference. 
We have the House, meaning Demo-
crats. We have the Senate, and we have 
the Presidency. There is just little 
time left. But there is enough time left 
for us to make a difference if we choose 
to. 
And my prayer is that those Senators 
will understand that either we take up 
our agenda now, or we risk not having 
the opportunity to take it up within 
the foreseeable future. That is what we 
risk. 
I hope that they will see that now is 
the time to deal with a woman’s right 
to choose. The legislation is there. 
Now is the time to deal with gun 
safety laws that can prevent 18-year- 
olds from having weapons of war. 
Now is the time to take up voting 
rights, so that all persons will have an 
equal opportunity to serve. 
Now is the time to take up an agenda 
that will make America the beautiful a 
more beautiful America. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING ELLEN KISKER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Ellen Kisker. 
Ellen is an exceptional woman who won the 
award for Woman of Merit from the YWCA St. 
Joseph Awards Program. 
Ellen served as Director of the Non-Tradi-
tional Student Center and ADA Coordinator for 
Missouri Western State University for 24 
years. While at MWSU, she was honored with 
the National ANTSHE College Advisor of the 
Year and Northland Regional Excellence in 
Higher Education awards, as well as being 
awarded the MWSU Presidential Citation 
under two different presidents. After retiring 
from MWSU, Ellen worked at the YWCA for 8 
years, where she served in various capacities, 
ending her tenure there as the Family Re-
sources Director. As a hands-on leader, she 
facilitated the Choices/Decisions program, as 
well as assisted her staff in the Encore Plus 
and Healthy Teen Parents and Healthy Babies 
programs. Since retiring for the second time in 
2020, Ellen continues to be a strong supporter 
of the YWCA and serves on the Women of 
Excellence Steering Committee. Ellen’s hard 
work and service to the community has been 
extremely valuable and she is well-deserving 
of her award. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in thanking and congratulating Ellen Kisker 
for winning the Woman in the Workplace 
Leadership award as well as her service to the 
people of the Sixth Congressional District. I 
am proud to represent Ellen Kisker in the 
United States House of Representatives.

HONORING DIANA TAYLOR FOR 
CARIBBEAN HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Diana Taylor is 
an extraordinary radio host, broadcaster, and 
philanthropist from Central Florida who, since 
1984, has led her community by mastering the 
art of entrepreneurship to meet the spiritual, 
physical, and emotional needs of humanity— 
more specifically, children. 
Ms. Taylor engages children in her program 
titled ‘‘Young People’s Forum’’ on CAC radio 
and TV broadcasting on WOKB 1680 AM and 
100.1 FM studios, syndicating to South Florida 
and the Bahamas. She has been able to suc-
cessfully engage students in the Caribbean 
and Canada virtually as well. 
Her passion to mentor children for the real 
world has resulted in many who are now in 
leadership roles in today’s job market. Her 
motto, ‘‘Teach the children respect and they 
will learn respect. Give respect and get re-
spect,’’ has been lived by every child who has 
been a part of this program for the past 29

REFLECTING UPON TODAY’S DECI-
SION 
BY 
THE 
U.S. 
SUPREME 
COURT 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, as today 
marks my 39th birthday and an uncertain 
number of years that I will still be able to bear 
children, a chill rides up my spine for the 
healthcare that I can no longer receive in the 
United States of America. 
In a country with the highest maternal mor-
tality rate of the industrialized world, the action 
of the Supreme Court is to overturn Roe v. 
Wade, taking away the constitutional right of 
women to make their own health care deci-
sions. I shudder to think about what comes 
next. For the young girl with her whole life be-
fore her—will she be able to determine the 
outcomes of her life equally? How will we 
achieve equality, accessibility, and economic 
progress with women unable to make their 
own health care decisions? We are so much 
more educated, connected, and liberated than 
we were in 1973. 
I know a new time will mark a new moment 
for people wishing to conceive freely and fairly 
on their own terms. Michigan’s Governor, 
Gretchen Whitmer, and Attorney General 
Dana Nessel are standing with the women of 
this Nation. I want everyone to know they 
have a champion in me, and together, the 
views of the majority in the Nation will rise 
again. 
HONORING REVEREND MARY 
MCDONALD 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Reverend Mary 
McDonald. Mary McDonald is an exceptional 
woman and winner of the Woman in the Work-
place Leadership Award from the YWCA St. 
Joseph Awards Program. 
Reverend McDonald has served for 27 
years at Holsey Chapel, working faithfully and 
tirelessly on behalf of her congregants. During 
her years of ministry, Mary also worked for 34 
years at Boehringer-lngelheim and was twice 
the Outstanding Performance in Sales and 
Marketing Award recipient. Her hard work and 
dedication have enshrined her as a leader 
worth looking up to. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in thanking and congratulating Reverend 
McDonald for winning the Woman in the 
Workplace Leadership award as well as her 
service to the people of the Sixth Congres-
sional District. I am proud to represent Rev-
erend Mary McDonald in the United States 
House of Representatives.

CONGRATULATING THE SANTA FE 
FARMERS’ MARKET INSTITUTE 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I am pleased to congratulate the Santa Fe 
Farmers’ Market Institute on its 20th Anniver-
sary on Saturday, June 25, 2022. The Institute 
champions local farmers and ranchers and 
provides equitable access to fresh, local food 
to the community. 
Home to one of the largest farmers’ markets 
in the country, and the largest in New Mexico, 
the Institute serves as a venue for well over a 
hundred farmers from the 15 counties of 
northern New Mexico to sell their produce. 
The Institute nourishes us by giving us access 
to nutritious locally grown foods. At the same 
time, it brings our community closer together. 
In addition to providing a home for farmers 
and ranchers to sell their products, the Insti-
tute administers Farmer Focused Programs 
and Microloans. The flexible loans fund 
projects that support many of the vendors’ 
businesses. They also improve the quality and 
quantity of the products brought to the Market. 
Moreover, the Institute endeavors to benefit 
everyone in our community. Its Double Up 
Food Bucks program matches all EBT cards 
dollar for dollar. That essentially doubles 
SNAP participants’ purchase power for fresh 
and nutritious local produce. 
And almost as important as all of this, is 
that the Farmers’ Market is a joy. It is vibrant,

fun, delicious, and makes the community 
come alive in support of our local growers and 
makers. 
From here in D.C., I can easily recall the 
smell of green chile roasting in the fall, the 
crisp apples turned into cider, the fresh snap 
peas in the spring, and ah, the unforgettable 
taste of that first full big juicy tomato in the 
summer. Then there are those beautiful flow-
ers, first as seedlings in the spring, and then 
as bouquets of sunflowers or garlands of mari-
golds to be used for Dia de Los Muertos in 
November. 
The market brings to life not only our 
senses of smell, taste, and vision, but we are 
often serenaded as we parade through the 
vendors with marimbas or violins. 
I am proud to have the Santa Fe Farmers’ 
Market Institute in my congressional district. 
Congratulations on two decades of serving 
farmers, ranchers, families, and the entire 
community with such bountiful products.

HONORING 
EBISMENIA 
HASSELE 
FOR 
CARIBBEAN 
HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Ebismenia 
Hassele is a professional Latino woman who 
obtained her master’s degree in criminal jus-
tice and police science. This led to her work 
for the New York City Police Department and 
to currently volunteer for the Polk County 
Sheriff’s office. 
Ms. Hassele is a member of Lion Club in 
Auburndale, Florida. Previously, she was the 
president of the association for Inwood Com-
munity, Inc. for 11 years. 
Ms. Hassele established a festival of unity— 
the Multicultural Unity Festival—within a com-
munity that was divided. The event was co-
ordinated with the help of the Polk County 
Sheriff’s Office, the fire department, and sev-
eral county commissioners and brought the 
community and law enforcement together. 
The event is held every other month. Many 
members and residents of Inwood bring home- 
made food to a segment of the event known 
as ‘‘Cop’s Night Out.’’ 
Ms. Hassele has also organized a black-tie 
fundraising event with the help of Lieutenant 
Navarro as well as several health fairs and 
yard sales to help educate and give back to 
the Central Florida community. 
Throughout the years, Ms. Hassele has as-
sisted with free food distribution and put much 
of her focus on the needs of elders in her 
community to help bridge gaps in ages and 
move her community forward. 
Ms. Hassele’s community is one of three 
certified as a Green Dot Agent community, 
which use a curriculum to help those who 
have been victims of any type of violence. 
They work together to stop apathy and inspire 
the community to reconnect with the renewed 
possibility that violence is not inevitable. 
Ms. Hassele draws her indomitable strength 
from her family, chiefly her three supportive 
daughters, Jessica, Love and Candy; three 
grandchildren; and her late husband, Guy R. 
Hassele, who was a disabled veteran. 
HONORING MONICA MORREY 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Monica Morrey. 
Monica Morrey is an exceptional woman who 
won the award for Emerging Leader from the 
YWCA St. Joseph Awards Program. 
Monica has dedicated herself to advocacy 
and service to others. While in college, she 
worked at a crisis hotline serving survivors of 
domestic violence. Since then, she has dedi-
cated herself continually to advocate for vic-
tims of crime, especially domestic abuse. She 
has worked for Legal Aid of Western Missouri 
assisting victims of domestic violence and ac-
quiring orders of protection for them. Her dedi-
cation to these victims and their defense is ex-
traordinary and commendable. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in thanking and congratulating Monica for 
winning the Emerging Leader award as well 
as her excellence in serving the people of the 
Sixth Congressional District. I am proud to 
represent Monica Morrey in the United States

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
RALPH GROENER 
HON. KURT SCHRADER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the life of Ralph 
Grolener. Ralph served Oregonians as a 
Clackamas County Commissioner, state legis-
lator and was a leader in Oregon’s labor 
movement with AFSCME, helping make Or-
egon one of the most union states in the 
country. 
Ralph was a Christmas baby, born Dec. 25, 
1941, to George and Mary Groener in Oregon 
City, Oregon. He attended local schools and 
graduated from West Linn High School in 
1960. He spent four years in the U.S. Air 
Force and was awarded the Airman’s medal 
for heroism. 
In 1965 he married Sharon Rich, of Oregon 
City. Initially attending Portland Community 
College, they moved to Eugene where Ralph 
attended and graduated from the University of 
Oregon. While in college, Ralph worked part- 
time at a local Safeway, and became a mem-
ber of the retail clerk’s union. Upon graduation 
in 1969 he worked as a community organizer 
for the war on poverty, taking his first steps on 
a lifelong pathway fighting for the underprivi-
leged and working families. 
Ralph was elected to the state legislature in 
1972, where he served two terms in the Or-
egon House of Representatives. In 1973 
Ralph was an original co-sponsor of the first 
Gay Rights Legislation to be introduced in the 
nation. He was also instrumental in the pas-
sage of SB 100, Oregon’s landmark land con-
servation legislation, as the bill’s carrier on the 
House Floor. Ralph was then elected to the 
Clackamas County Board of Commissioners, 
where he served tirelessly for eight years ad-
vocating for children and senior citizens. 
In 1990 Ralph found his way back to the 
Capitol, where he served as a political coordi-
nator and lobbyist for AFSCME for nearly 
three decades. One of Ralph’s favorite bible 
passages was Matthew 25:40—Truly I say to 
you, to the extent that you did it for one of the 
least of these brothers or sisters of Mine, you 
did it for Me. It is not hard to see this principle 
guided him for over three decades fighting on 
behalf of working Oregonians. 
Ralph was a force of nature. He loved to 
talk. He could out-talk anyone, anytime, any-
where. A familiar sight and sound roaming the 
halls of the state capitol, he was rarely without 
his trademark smile or partner Mary Botkin. 
His son, Chris shared with me that he used to 
say—keep your chin up and never let them 
see you sweat. I never saw Ralph without his 
chin up. Ralph retired from AFSCME in 2018. 
Ralph’s career was filled with dozens of 
awards and accomplishments: 
United States Air Force Airman’s Medal, 
1963; 
Oregon 
State 
Sheriffs 
Association 
Award of Valor—Three-time recipient; Out-
standing Youth Leader of Clackamas County, 
1972; Distinguished Service Award from the 
American Association of Retired Persons, 
1972; One of the Outstanding Young Men of 
America, 1973 and 1975; Oregon’s Out-
standing Educator-Statesman Award, 1975; 
Oregon League of Cities ‘‘Friend of Cities 
Award, 2005; NW Senior and Disability Serv-
ices Advocacy Award, 2018 
Ralph passed away on June 1, 2022, losing 
a dogged fight to cancer. He is survived by his 
wife, Sharon; daughter Hilary Groener; son 
Chris Groener; and granddaughter Cassidy 
Hedger and her husband, Corey Hedger. 
Ralph is also survived by hundreds of his 
union brothers and sisters, friends and col-
leagues from the political and legislative world. 
I mourn with them on his passing.

Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Five outstanding athletes representing the 
Drexel High School girls’ track and field team 
won the Missouri State Championship in Jef-
ferson City, Missouri. The Lady Cats earned 
46 points over nine events at the champion-
ship meet. 
The 2022 Lady Cats track team is the first 
in the history of Drexel to win the state cham-
pionship title. Olivia Shipps, Gracie Marks, 
Emily Wheeler, Josie Parks, and Izzy Richard-
son demonstrate remarkable determination 
and perseverance by earning this title for their 
school. Their coach, Jenny Wheeler, trained 
these young athletes and got to see firsthand 
how the effort they put into achieving this title 
stating, ‘‘the girls had these goals before the 
season and would talk about them constantly. 
To see them work so hard and to win the 
state meet is very special.’’ 
These girls serve as a reminder that hard 
work always pays off. Congratulations to the 
Lady Cats on an incredible season, and I 
thank the teachers, coaches, and parents for 
providing the opportunity for these young 
women to compete fairly. I can’t wait to see 
what else the Drexel High School girls’ track 
and field team accomplishes in the future.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
RETIRE-
MENT OF OFFICER ROBERT PEM-
BERTON 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding 26-year career of Of-
ficer Robert Pemberton and congratulate him 
on his retirement from the City of Greenville 
Police Department. Officer Pemberton is a re-
markable example of the highest caliber of law 
enforcement 
professional 
and 
has 
dem-
onstrated unwavering devotion to the depart-
ment and community for over a quarter of a 
century. 
For most of his career, Officer Pemberton 
did not serve alone, as he was a K–9 officer. 
Impressively, the K–9 partners he worked 
alongside were just as exceptional. Officer 
Pemberton’s first K–9 partner was a German 
Shepherd named Ceiko. His next police-dog 
partner was the Belgian Malinois named Rex. 
And his third and final K–9 partner was the 
Dutch Shepherd named Trap, with whom he 
retired alongside. Officer Pemberton and these 
world class canines were repeatedly recog-
nized for outstanding performance in the de-
tection and prevention of crime. 
Together, these duos worked tirelessly to 
protect and serve their community. Throughout 
his career, Officer Pemberton with his K–9 
partners seized of over $2,000,000 in cash, 
with 
their 
largest 
single 
seizure 
being 
$480,000. They were also responsible for re-
covering a myriad of drugs with a street value 
worth millions of dollars. The City of Green-
ville, Hunt County, and the North Texas area 
were undoubtedly safer with every shift Officer 
Pemberton worked. 
On behalf of the great people of Texas’ 
Fourth Congressional District, I thank Officer 
Pemberton for all he has done for our commu-
nity.

MARKING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM 
HON. KIM SCHRIER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Pell 
Grant Program. 
In 1972, Congress amended the Higher 
Education Act by creating the Basic Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant. This legislation 
provides direct financial aid to low-income stu-
dents so they can have the same access to 
higher education and opportunity for success 
as their higher income peers. This program 
was later named the Pell Grant for its original 
sponsor, Sen. Claiborne Pell, Democrat from 
Rhode Island. The original bill was signed into 
law by Republican President Richard Nixon, 
and the program has maintained this original 
bipartisan support over the last 50 years. 
The federal investment in Pell Grants is tar-
geted to students with demonstrated financial 
need, with most families at incomes of 
$40,000 or less, and can be used to fund ca-
reer and technical education, community col-
lege education, university education, and post 
graduate education. The investment pays off 
by increasing college completion and boosting 
economic mobility. 
To date, more than 80 million students have 
received a Pell Grant to go to college since 
the program’s creation. Currently, nearly 7 mil-
lion students are going to college with Pell 
Grants, or about 40 percent of undergraduate 
students. 
In my congressional district, 6,796 students 
are receiving $28,721,279 in Federal Pell 
Grant funds to pursue their higher education 
goals at our local colleges. In my state of 
Washington, 
87,342 
students 
receive 
$357,725,397 in Federal Pell grant funds. 
I look forward to Congress continuing the bi-
partisan support for low-income student ac-
cess to college through the Pell Grant for an-
other 50 years.

HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND 
LEGACY OF NANCY L. DONAHUE 
HON. LORI TRAHAN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on her 92nd birthday to honor the tremendous 
contributions and legacy of Nancy Donahue, a 
passionate community leader who has led by 
example as an activist, arts enthusiast, hu-
manitarian and philanthropist. She has dedi-
cated her life to her family, to the tremendous 
success of the Whistler House Museum of Art, 
and to the prosperity of communities across 
the Merrimack Valley. 
Nancy was born in New Britain, Connecticut 
in 1930 to parents who instilled in her the im-
portance of giving back to her community. 
When World War II broke out, Nancy was in 
junior high school. Seeing her parents volun-
teer to help families who needed support, she 
decided to join the Victory Farmettes where, 
alongside other young girls, she harvested 
crops on farms around her town. During high 
school, she was a Candy Striper at the hos-
pital in her community. 
After graduating from Lasell University in 
1950, Nancy accepted a job at IBM, where 
she was one of five women salespeople in the 
entire company. Although she had a full time 
job, Nancy found a way to continue serving 
her community and country during the time of 
the Korean War. She volunteered to work 
nights as an Air Patrol where she watched for 
enemy planes on top of Hancock Tower. 
While living in Boston, Nancy met the love of 
her life, Richard Donahue, and the pair were 
married in 1952. They would go on to have 
eleven children whom they raised to always 
remember where they came from and to give 
back to their community whenever possible. 
Over the span of her lifetime, Nancy can be 
credited with spearheading the cultural revital-
ization of the City of Lowell. One of the most 
notable contributions she has made to our

community was being a founding member of 
the Merrimack Repertory Theatre. Throughout 
forty years, the Theatre has operated as a 
world class venue that has attracted famous 
artists from around the world. Due to her grit 
and determination, working class families in 
the community were introduced to the wonder-
ful world of arts and humanities. To this day, 
the Merrimack Repertory Theatre continues to 
be a cornerstone for the performing arts 
throughout the Merrimack Valley. 
Nancy has lived an extraordinary life dedi-
cated to service. Over the years, Nancy has 
given to countless local organizations and 
served on numerous boards that have posi-
tively impacted the Greater Lowell community. 
She 
was 
a 
longtime 
president 
of 
the 
Merrimack Repertory Theatre and chair of the 
Whistler House Museum of Art, and she has 
served and continues to serve on the boards 
of the New England Quilt Museum, the former 
Revolving and American Textile and History 
Museums, Lasell University, UMass Lowell, 
Enterprise Bank and so many more. She also 
played an integral role in the United Way of 
Mass Bay and Merrimack Valley, and the 
International Institute. 
Throughout her life, Nancy has remained 
steadfast in her dedication to giving back to 
our community. She has worked tirelessly to 
make Lowell a better place to live and work. 
Nancy’s contributions to the arts and human-
ities in Lowell has made a lasting impact on 
the City and will continue to be felt for genera-
tions to come. Tonight, Nancy will be honored 
by the Whistler House for her lifetime of serv-
ice, and celebrated as the model for all who 
are seeking to live a life dedicated to making 
the world a better place. 
Most importantly, Madam Speaker, Nancy is 
known for her love of her family and friends, 
the kindness she shows to those around her, 
her unbelievable humanitarianism and philan-
thropic work, and her immense pride in the 
Greater Lowell community. Her legacy is one 
that will prove unforgettable and everlasting in 
our City.

Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Anita Twardesky on the oc-
casion of her retirement from the Downriver 
Linked Greenways, where she served as 
Chair for over two decades. Her years of serv-
ice to the Downriver community and to our en-
vironment are worthy of commendation.

longtime environmental advocate in our com-
munity and previously worked as Recreation 
Director for the cities of Flat Rock and 
Woodhaven before starting as the Community 
Outreach Manager for Riverside Kayak Con-
nection. The non-profit the Downriver Linked 
Greenways was launched in 1999 as a result 
of the Downriver Summit hosted by the late 
Congressman John Dingell. As Chair of the 
Greenways, Ms. Twardesky spearheaded mul-
tiple projects to extend the Downriver Linked 
Greenways trail system, including the embark-
ing on the first Downriver trail project and the 
Detroit Heritage River Water Trail. Further-
more, she helped the organization become a 
501(c)(3) and secured over $15 million in 
funding for trail construction as well as gap 
analysis of the trail system. Her efforts have 
helped create over one hundred miles of trails 
in Downriver. 
In addition to her role at the Downriver 
Linked Greenways, Ms. Twardesky has long 
been a leader in Downriver. She served on 
the Healthy Trenton Coalition and helped 
found the International Wildlife Refuge Alli-
ance. Additionally, as the founder of Destina-
tion Downriver, she is actively changing the 
perception of Downriver and attracting new 
businesses and visitors to the area. Ms. 
Twardesky’s dedication to the evolution of 
Downriver and its community has not gone un-
noticed, and in 2019, she was awarded the 
Women of Achievement Leadership Award 
from the Southern Wayne Chamber of Com-
merce. Outside of work, Ms. Twardesky has 
headed the ‘‘Go Impact’’ program through her 
church, Southpointe Church, which supports 
seniors and disabled community members 
with yard and residential clean ups. A pas-
sionate volunteer, she also assists in feeding 
and housing our neighbors that are experi-
encing homelessness. Ms. Twardesky resides 
in Flat Rock with her husband, children, and 
grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Anita Twardesky for her 
exemplary work at the Downriver Linked 
Greenways. I join with Ms. Twardesky’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my grati-
tude to her for her tireless commitment to our 
community and to thank her for her role in 
Downriver’s environmental and economic de-
velopment. Though we will miss her passion 
for Downriver and for our wildlife, we wish her 
the very best in retirement.

their many years of service in healthcare, 
TBCHS has displayed steadfast devotion to

a 
group 
of 
Michiganders motivated to create greater ac-
cess to primary care services in the Great 
Lakes region. TBCHS opened their first clinic 
in Hillman, Michigan, in 1982 while also be-
coming a National Health Service Corporation 
solo practice. Today, they are a non-profit 
Federally Qualified Health Center, allowing 
them to provide a broad variety of much-need-
ed programs and services within rural areas. 
Throughout the years, TBCHS has contin-
ued to expand—building facilities to support 
the people of Montmorency, Alpena, Che-
boygan, Otsego, and Presque Isle Counties. 
Most recently, they opened their site in Fair-
view, adding Oscoda County to their commu-
nity of care. TBCHS prides itself on offering 
services such as dental and general health to 
ensure their population can find proper care, 
creating healthier Michigan communities. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
Thunder Bay Community Health Service, Inc. 
for decades of success and service to north-
eastern Michigan. Michiganders can take great 
pride in knowing the First District is home to 
such dedicated citizens. On behalf of my con-
stituents, I wish them all the best in their fu-
ture endeavors.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Samuel Rob-
erts has been involved in the Caribbean Amer-
ican community since 2004 when he was first 
elected vice president of the Guyanese Amer-
ican Cultural Association of Central Florida. 
He was later elected president and served in 
that capacity for a total of eight years, becom-
ing their longest-serving president. Roberts 
was instrumental in the establishment of the 
Caribbean American Heritage Month celebra-
tions initiative which launched in Central Flor-
ida in 2009. 
Roberts has held various positions in the 
Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce 
including vice president, and various com-
mittee chairs. Utilizing their platform on the 
chamber, their associations, and their publica-
tion, Roberts and his wife Guenet Roberts

community in the Central Florida area. Their 
actions have been recognized by groups like 
the Susan Taylor Cares organization. 
Roberts is a civil engineer with over 25 
years of experience in engineering and project 
management. He graduated in 1993 with a 
bachelor’s degree in civil engineering and a 
minor in mathematics. He most recently com-
pleted his master’s degree in emergency man-
agement. In 2004, he got his first introduction 
into the disaster recovery industry when hurri-
canes Charlie, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne af-
fected Central Florida. Roberts was placed in 
the field to help implement guidelines while 
ensuring the services being provided were 
FEMA compliant. Since that year, Roberts has 
been involved in every major hurricane recov-
ery project across the southeast. 
In 2017, while managing recovery oper-
ations in Polle County, Florida, Roberts devel-
oped a management plan that helped com-
plete clean-up activities in a systematic and 
efficient manner. That same year, he began 
working on a more efficient recovery manage-
ment application. In June of 2021 the app, 
GridMapI, was presented to attendees of the 
National Hurricane Conference in New Orle-
ans where it was well received. The app is 
now featured in the Apple and Android app 
stores.

Roberts is also responsible for the Fusion Fest 
which is presented annually by the Orange 
County Mayor’s Office. 
Roberts has been married for 26 years and

analyst behind the agency’s model for pro-
jecting potential output over the long run. In 
macroeconomic forecasting circles, those pro-
jections by CBO are the benchmark to which 
other forecasts are compared. The profession 
knows that the agency’s model of potential 
output is backed by very careful analysis and 
scrutiny. As the economy and data about it 
have evolved, Bob has made substantial im-
provements to the model and published a 
paper and code documenting this fundamental 
tool for CBO’s analysis. 
Bob also has been a primary contributor to 
CBO’s analysis of the economic effects of cli-
mate change and the policies that might be 
adopted in response. Almost 20 years ago, he 
wrote a comprehensive survey on the issue: 
The Economics of Climate Change: A Primer. 
Since then, he has helped develop and write 
several other CBO reports on climate change. 
Bob’s public service did not begin with his 
work at CBO. He came to the agency after 
eight years at the Environmental Protection 
Agency. At EPA, Bob worked with head-
quarters staff responsible for providing policy 
analysis. He directed state-of-the-art economic 
research policies aimed at mitigating the im-
pacts of climate change. 
By all accounts, Bob’s colleagues at CBO 
and in Congress appreciate his dedication, 
ability, skillful work, and breadth of experience. 
They will miss his generosity with his time and 
knowledge-and especially his musings about 
topics such as linguistics, geology, and bird 
watching. 
I know my colleagues join me in extending 
our thanks and appreciation to Bob for his 
service to our country. We wish him well in his 
future undertakings and hope that the Nation 
will continue to benefit from his expertise and 
commitment.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVERARY 
OF 
THE 
PELL 
GRANT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to mark the 50th Anniversary of 
the Pell Grant Program. 
In 1972, Congress amended the Higher 
Education Act by creating the Basic Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant, to provide direct fi-
nancial aid to low-income students so they 
would have the same access to higher edu-
cation and opportunity for success as their 
higher income peers. This program was later 
named the Pell Grant for its original sponsor, 
Sen. Claiborne Pell, Democrat from Rhode Is-
land. The original bill was signed into law by 
Republican President Richard Nixon, and the 
program has maintained this original bipartisan 
support over the last 50 years. 
To date, more than 80 million students have 
received a Pell Grant to go to college since 
the program’s creation. Currently, nearly 7 mil-
lion students are going to college with Pell 
Grants, or about 40 percent of undergraduate 
students. 
In my congressional district, 4,626 students 
are receiving $17,586,937 to pursue their 
higher education goals at our local colleges. 
The federal investment in Pell Grants is tar-
geted to students with demonstrated financial 
need, with most families at incomes of 
$40,000 or less, and the investment pays off 
by increasing college completion, and eco-
nomic mobility. 
Madam Speaker, as we approach the 50- 
year mark on the Pell Grant program, I look 
forward to Congress continuing the bipartisan 
support for low-income student access to col-
lege through the Pell Grant for another 50 
years. I urge my colleagues to support the bi-
partisan resolution declaring June 23, 2022, 
National Pell Grant Day this year, and in the 
future.

HONORING PHYLLIS MYERS 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 24, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Phyllis Myers. 
Phyllis won the award for Woman in Vol-
unteerism from the YWCA St. Joseph Women 
of Excellence Awards program for her service 
in her community. 
In 1970, Phyllis co-founded the New Gen-
eration Singers with her husband, the pastor 
of Wyatt Park Christian Church. Over the last 
52 years, she has served as a leader, mentor, 
and chaperone, attended countless rehearsals 
and performances, and accompanied the 
group on 2-week tours across the United 
States and Canada. She’s developed fond 
connections with thousands of young people, 
over the years, and has served as a substitute 
mother and grandmother to many. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in thanking and congratulating Phyllis 
Myers for winning the Woman in Volunteerism 
award as well as service to the people of the 
Sixth Congressional District. I am proud to 
represent Phyllis Myers in the United States 
House of Representatives.
