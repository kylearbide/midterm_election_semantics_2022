INVIDIOUS 
DISCRIMINATION 
SHOULD 
NOT 
EXIST 
IN 
THIS 
COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise a proud American, proud 
to be a citizen of the greatest country 
in the world, proud to proclaim that I 
am a liberated Democrat, speak truth 
to power, truth about power, unbought 
and unbossed. 
I am also proud to be aided today 
with my mnemonic notes. I would like 
to talk to you about invidious dis-
crimination in the United States of 
America, the greatest country in the 
world. 
I know of no one in this House who 
believes that invidious discrimination 
is appropriate. I believe that every 
Member of this House will go on record 
indicating that invidious discrimina-
tion should not exist in this, the great-
est country in the world. 
But what I would like to do is give 
some empirical evidence of the exist-
ence of this invidious discrimination 
and then say a word or two about pos-
sible remedies. 
Newsday had a testing investigation. 
On November 17, 2019, Newsday re-
leased a scathing report detailing an 
investigation into the nature and ex-
tent of real estate sales practices on 
Long Island in New York. 
Now, do not confuse the fact that 
this was in New York on Long Island 
with the notion that it doesn’t happen 
in other places. It could have happened 
in my city, Houston, Texas, and my be-
lief is it happens every day in a good 
many places around this country. 
The evidence continues with this. 
The report, titled, ‘‘Long Island Di-
vided,’’ was the culmination of a 31⁄2 
year comprehensive investigation en-
tailing 240 hours of secretly recorded 
meetings with real estate agents and 
analysis of 5,764 house listings. 
It appears that the Newsday report 
revealed a 19 percent rate of discrimi-
nation against Asian Americans, 39 
percent rate of discrimination against 
Latinos, and 49 percent rate of dis-
crimination against African Ameri-
cans. 
It appears that the persons who were 
the agents, the agents who were the 
persons being spoken to by persons 
seeking opportunities, it appears that 
these agents refused to provide service 
to customers of color—some of them, 
not all of them. 
They showed borrowers of color far 
fewer homes than their White counter-
parts, provided inaccurate information 
to borrowers of color, made inappro-
priate statements based on race, placed 
higher requirements on borrowers of 
color, and steered potential customers 
based on race. 
Nobody in this House would agree to 
this as appropriate. Everybody in this 
House, I believe, would condemn this. 
But here is where the rubber meets the 
road. 
It is one thing to condemn it and to 
say that it is wrong. That is a talking 
point. We can have the greatest talking 
points in the world, but this will con-
tinue until we make those talking 
points an action item. 
There are things that we can do to 
prevent this level of invidious discrimi-
nation. The question is not whether 
there is a way. The question is: Do we 
have the will to challenge and take on 
this level of invidious discrimination?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1194 
February 26, 2020 
Because of the many remedies pro-
posed, the one that stands out the most 
is that of increasing the fund for fair 
housing testing, to do exactly what 
they did with this report, to go into 
various venues and test and acquire 
this empirical evidence. 
Nobody wants to see this happen, but 
we cannot stop it by simply talking 
about it. We have to have an action, 
and the action item is testing. 
I will be saying more about this later 
on this week because there is legisla-
tion right here pending in this House 
that we can bring to the floor of this 
House, pass, and we can prevent this 
kind of behavior from taking place be-
cause, when we acquire the empirical 
evidence, we can then confront those 
who do this. We can also educate them, 
and we can pass on a legacy to future 
generations of success in ending invid-
ious discrimination.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FUTURE 
FARMERS OF AMERICA WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to recognize National 
Future Farmers of America Week. 
Without question, the hardworking 
men and women in the field of agri-
culture serve as the backbone of our 
Nation. 
Since its founding in 1917, the Future 
Farmers of America has prepared the 
next generation of chemists, veterinar-
ians, entrepreneurs, and premier agri-
culture professionals. These individ-
uals will go on to solve the world’s 
challenge of providing resources to 
growing populations. 
In North Carolina, the Future Farm-
ers of America continues to grow. Last 
year, it had over 20,000 members, and 
its 321 chapters contributed more than 
1 million service hours across the 
State. When you see these young peo-
ple in their dark blue jackets with the 
gold trim, you are seeing leaders and 
patriots. 
By learning to do, doing to learn, 
earning to live, and living to serve, the 
Future Farmers of America ensure 
that our Nation’s agricultural future 
remains bright. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
did not address imprudent comments 
about our Nation’s farmers that were 
recently brought to light. At an Oxford 
University 
event 
in 
2016, 
Michael 
Bloomberg offered commentary that 
was truly unsettling. He said: ‘‘I could 
teach anybody, even people in this 
room, to be a farmer. It’s a process. 
You dig a hole; you put a seed in; you 
put dirt on top, add water, and up 
comes the corn.’’ 
When you write off America’s farm-
ers, you write off the lifeblood of our 
country. To show you the impact of our 
farmers, we will look at the facts in 
just a moment. 
Contrary to the idea, as Michael 
Bloomberg said, that farming is so sim-
ple, the truth is that farmers must be 
among the most intelligent, innova-
tive, and creative people in the world. 
They face challenges every day that 
threaten their survival. 
Now, let’s look at the facts: 
Annually, one U.S. farm will feed 166 
people in the U.S. and abroad; 
In 2018, $139 billion of American agri-
cultural products were exported around 
the world; 
Ninety-eight percent of U.S. farms 
are operated by hardworking families; 
and 
About 11 percent of U.S. farmers are 
serving or have served in the military, 
compared to only 2 percent of the gen-
eral public, showing that American 
farmers are very patriotic. 
These facts speak for themselves. 
The work of American farmers goes far 
beyond Michael Bloomberg’s claim of 
simply digging holes, planting seeds, 
and adding water. 
I am proud to represent over 7,000 
farms and over 11,000 agricultural pro-
ducers in the Fifth District of North 
Carolina. Collectively, they generate 
over $1 billion every year and represent 
almost 10 percent of North Carolina’s 
agriculture sales. 
Recently, Alleghany County honored 
some of its farmers, young and old, and 
to hear of their efforts and dedication 
would inspire anyone. I commend and 
thank our farmers and our future agri-
cultural leaders for their unwavering 
commitment to our families, commu-
nities, and to our country. 
f 
THON, 
THE 
LARGEST 
STUDENT- 
RUN PHILANTHROPIC EFFORT IN 
THE WORLD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and thank Penn State students who 
have spent the last year dedicating 
countless hours to support a fantastic 
cause benefiting pediatric cancer pa-
tients. I am talking about THON. 
This yearlong fundraising effort cul-
minates in an annual 46-hour dance 
marathon to financially and emotion-
ally support more than 4,500 families 
with children who are battling cancer. 
THON was founded in 1973 by Penn 
State fraternities and sororities. What 
began as a small fundraiser bringing in 
$2,000 in its inaugural year has flour-
ished into a campus-wide effort with 
more than 16,000 student volunteers 
across the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania. 
This year, Penn State students raised 
$11.7 million, and, to date, students 
have shattered records and raised near-
ly $180 million, making THON the larg-
est student-run philanthropic effort in 
the world. 
Of course, their dedication is to be 
applauded, but ask any Penn State stu-
dent and they agree: THON isn’t about 
them; it is about the children and the 
families fighting cancer. 
Over the years, THON has supported 
more than 4,000 families with a child 
battling pediatric cancer. Patients are 
treated at the Penn State Hershey 
Medical Center, and because of THON, 
many of these families never receive a 
medical bill. 
THON is for the kids, and it is for the 
families to focus on celebrating more 
birthdays, piano recitals, science fairs, 
graduations, and every other milestone 
that a child should celebrate without 
fear. THON exists so that one day par-
ents never have to hear the words, 
‘‘Your child has cancer.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of these stu-
dents; but, more importantly, I am 
proud of the children and the families 
who have the courage to fight back 
against pediatric cancer. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST MAKE LYNCHING 
A FEDERAL HATE CRIME 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 35, the Em-
mett Till Antilynching Act, we will be 
voting on later this afternoon. I am 
pleased to see the House take steps in 
finally addressing this issue. 
Like many, despite our Nation’s ugly 
history of lynchings, I was shocked to 
learn that there was no law making 
lynching a Federal hate crime. 
My home in Omaha area is not unlike 
many other towns across the country 
with a gruesome past of lynching. 
George Smith was murdered in October 
1891, and this past fall marked the 
100th anniversary of the murder of Will 
Brown on the steps of the Douglas 
County Courthouse during the Red 
Summer. The hands of lawless and 
angry mobs in Omaha beat and lynched 
these men in what can only be charac-
terized as racial terrorism. 
We cannot simply wash away the 
past, but in order for our Nation to 
heal from past racial injustice, Con-
gress must specify criminal penalties 
for the crime of lynching or conspiracy 
to commit lynching. 
With at least 5,000 lynchings in our 
Nation’s history, this bill is important 
as an acknowledgement that this evil 
did occur, that millions felt fear in 
their homes and communities, that 
many feared for their lives, the lives of 
their dads and their sons, and that this 
formal acknowledgement will help fa-
cilitate reconciliation. 
b 1015 
Last year, I was approached by local 
African American community leaders 
to look into antilynching legislation. I 
felt that the language from Senator 
HARRIS’ bill that passed with over-
whelming bipartisan support in the 
Senate was the right one to support 
here in the House. This is how we are 
going to pass a bill and get it signed by 
the President of the United States. It 
is because of these reasons that I was 
honored to introduce the Senate-passed 
language in the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1195 
February 26, 2020 
The bill we are voting on today con-
tains the language of my bill that I in-
troduced 8 months ago verbatim. I do 
not complain because in the end, I 
want results. We want results. We are 
closer than we have ever been in mak-
ing lynching a Federal crime. The ac-
tion is long overdue, going back 200 at-
tempts since 1918, and today we are 
going to make history once and for all 
on this issue. 
It has been my privilege to be an ad-
vocate on this issue. I applaud Senator 
HARRIS
and Congressman RUSH
who 
have championed this bill for years. We 
will finally get this bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk to be signed into law in 
order to close one of the ugliest chap-
ters in America’s history once and for 
all.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF BILL MEUTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to wish Caldwell County resident 
Bill Meuth a happy 100th birthday. 
Mr. Meuth served as an Army medic 
in World War II. He stormed the beach-
es at Normandy on D-day, fighting 
with the Allies in the name of freedom. 
Prior to the war, he had quit school at 
an early age to help care for his father 
who was sick, representing the ethos of 
a generation who understood that com-
mitment to family and country some-
times comes at a personal cost. 
After the war, he worked in the oil 
fields instilling a strong work ethic in 
his family. 
In 1943, Mr. Meuth married his sweet-
heart, Lucy, and they remained mar-
ried for 72 years until Miss Lucy passed 
away in 2015. 
Together they had four children, 14 
grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren 
and two great-great-grandchildren. 
We in south Texas are incredibly 
thankful for his sacrifice at such a crit-
ical time in our history and for the 
cause of freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy birthday 
to Mr. Meuth, and may God bless him. 
CONGRATULATING NATHAN TUDOR 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Nathan Tudor 
for receiving the Texas Hospital Asso-
ciation Pioneer Award. Each year this 
award is given to rural hospital admin-
istrators or a CEO who demonstrates 
creative 
and 
innovative 
leadership 
within the organization and commu-
nity. 
This year the award was given to one 
of El Campo’s very own. Mr. Tudor 
came on board as the CEO of El Campo 
Memorial Hospital in January of 2017. 
Since Mr. Tudor has been on the 
team, the emergency department has 
expanded by 11 beds, three new campus- 
care clinics have been opened within 
the community, five walk-in clinics 
have been added, and new physicians 
have been recruited. 
El Campo has directly benefited from 
the expansion of services but so have 
the surrounding communities. 
We are thankful for Mr. Tudor and 
those working with him at the El 
Campo Hospital for their efforts in im-
proving and expanding healthcare serv-
ices for the El Campo area.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Dear Lord, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
We use this moment to be reminded 
of Your presence and to tap the re-
sources needed by the Members of this 
people’s House to do their work as well 
as it can be done. 
Send, O God, Your healing grace 
upon those torn nations and upon the 
Members of this assembly who struggle 
to see the shared hope for a better fu-
ture in those with whom they disagree. 
For many Americans, the holy sea-
son of Lent begins tomorrow, and fore-
heads are marked this day in recogni-
tion of our limits as men and women 
and as a reminder of Your power to for-
give and heal the harms done through 
our failures. 
All this day, and through the week, 
may our representatives do their best 
to find solutions to pressing issues fac-
ing our Nation. Please hasten the day 
when justice and love shall dwell in the 
hearts of all peoples and rule the af-
fairs of the nations of Earth. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RECOGNIZING REVEREND J. 
EDWARD NASH 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today as we celebrate 
Black 
History 
Month 
and 
adopt 
antilynching legislation to recognize 
civil rights trailblazer Reverend J. Ed-
ward Nash. 
The son of slaves, Reverend Nash 
served as pastor of the Michigan Street 
Baptist Church in Buffalo, New York, 
which opened its doors up as a meeting 
place for abolitionists and antilynching 
activists and as a stop on the Under-
ground Railroad. 
Last week, I visited the Nash House, 
a site on the National Register of His-
toric Places and a testament to his 
work as part of our national story. Our 
gracious hosts, former Buffalo Council 
President George K. Arthur and Sharon 
Jordan Holley, shared with me their vi-
sion, enthusiasm, and dedication to 
Nash, his home, and his legacy. 
Among his papers are notes from the 
1939 Urban League meeting benediction 
in which he applauds those working to 
‘‘free us from the shackles that hold us 
in the bondage of narrowness, selfish-
ness, and prejudice.’’ 
Let us heed the advice of Reverend 
Nash.

asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate National FFA week. FFA is a na-
tional leader in agricultural education, 
inspiring our Nation’s young people to 
pursue careers that help support a ro-
bust rural economy. 
Agriculture is the backbone of Penn-
sylvania’s economy. It is rooted in 
American heritage, and our Nation’s 
producers provide us the food, the 
fiber, the building materials, and the 
energy that we all depend upon. 
By committing to FFA, young men 
and women are helping shape the 
science, technology, and business of ag-
riculture. Every time I see a distinc-
tive blue FFA jacket, I am reminded of 
the strong character and impressive 
leadership abilities that come along 
with it.

VIRGIN 
ISLANDS 
WELCOME 
U.S. 
HOUSE COMMITTEES ON THEIR 
VISIT 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
this is a time of unprecedented oppor-
tunity to rebuild our highways and 
roads as well as harden our utilities 
and infrastructure. 
I was delighted to welcome Chairmen 
PETERSON
and DEFAZIO, along with 
members of the House Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee and the 
Agriculture Committee to the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands. 
Members were able to meet with 
FEMA officials to discuss the terri-
tory’s disaster recovery progress and 
objectives regarding housing, power, 
education, and project obligations and 
formulation. 
The delegations toured the hospital, 
the Arthur Richards School, Alexander 
Henderson School, as well as the STEP 
home. 
Members of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, with local farmers, officials, 
and USDA representatives, discussed 
challenges and opportunities for agri-
culture in the Virgin Islands. They also 
visited the U.S. Virgin Islands Agri-
culture Fair, which is the largest in 
the Caribbean. They saw firsthand the 
diversity of agriculture in the Virgin 
Islands and the resourcefulness of 
farmers to supply the growing demand 
for local and regional products. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to the 
committee members for coming. I am 
looking forward to working with them. 
My staff and I are committed to con-
tinuing to work with Chairmen DEFA-
ZIO and PETERSON to ensure that the 
future of local farmers, highways, and 
infrastructure are guaranteed all the 
resources needed. 
f 
REFLECTING ON THE LIFE OF JO 
ALLISON SMITH 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to reflect on the life of Jo Alli-
son Smith, a dear friend to many and 
lifelong North Carolinian who passed 
away Saturday, February 15. 
Jo was the devoted wife to Eddie 
Smith, Jr., for over 57 years, as well as 
a loving mother to their son, Chris. 
Beyond family, Jo was passionate 
about her faith and served as an active 
member of St. James United Methodist 
Church in Greenville, North Carolina. 
She will no doubt be remembered for 
her extraordinary voice, which graced 
the music program for years. 
She was also a strong supporter of 
women in need. She helped found and 
lead Women for Women’s Power of the 
Purse and served on the board of many 
other local charities. 
Jo was a passionate supporter of the 
UNC Tar Heels, where she served on 
the Board of Visitors for the UNC Com-
prehensive Cancer Center and graced 
UNC football fans with a wonderful 
rendition of our national anthem. 
Our State was blessed by Jo’s pres-
ence, and our family was blessed to call 
her friend. Please join me in giving 
thanks for Jo’s life and praying for the 
entire Smith family during this time. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 55TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SELMA MARCH 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, as 
we know, March 7 marks the 55th anni-
versary of the 1965 Selma march, where 
courageous men and women crossed the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge from Selma, 
Alabama, to Montgomery to peacefully 
fight for the right for Black Americans 
to register to vote. 
I rise today to honor those who 
marched and to spotlight and highlight 
the Sisters of St. Joseph in my home 
district of Rochester, New York. The 
Sisters of St. Joseph came to Alabama 
from New York and played an integral 
role in running the Good Samaritan 
Hospital in Selma, Alabama. 
The 600 peaceful marchers that day 
were met with tear gas and clubs, and 
the Good Samaritan Hospital was the 
only facility within nine counties that 
would serve Black citizens. Despite 
having just emergency room beds, the 
sisters diligently cared for the huge on-
slaught of people who had been at-
tacked and beaten in their pursuit of 
equality. 
Some of the nuns present reside in 
Rochester today, and I could not be 
prouder to call them my constituents. 
Let us celebrate them as courageous 
leaders and honor them by committing 
to continue their fight for justice and 
equality. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
WEEK 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, this 
week is Public Schools Week, and I rise 
today to recognize our public schools 
in Kentucky for the critical work they 
do to educate Kentucky’s students. 
Public schools are essential to the 
growth and development of future gen-
erations. They are the backbone of our 
communities and responsible for edu-
cating our young people and providing 
them with a stable and secure learning 
environment. 
The learning opportunities provided 
by our schools are also critical to pre-
paring a workforce capable of taking 
on the challenges of the 21st century 
economy. 
I am very proud of the public schools 
which make up the First Congressional 
District. As a product of the public 
school system myself, I know how hard 
our teachers and staff work to prepare 
our students for success. 
Madam Speaker, we thank our edu-
cators for their service, and I look for-
ward to advocating for the needs of our 
public schools moving forward.

TRUMP POLICIES SUCCEED 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that the 
Democratic Presidential debate was 
last night in my birthplace, the holy 
city of Charleston, where they would 
see firsthand the successes of the eco-
nomic policies of Donald Trump cre-
ating jobs. 
When President Trump visits North 
Charleston Friday, the facts are clear. 
The Post and Courier, on February 7, 
by David Wren, reported ‘‘SC Extends 
Global Reach.’’ 
‘‘By air and sea, South Carolina 
boosted the dollar amount of goods ex-
ported to foreign countries to a record 
of $41.5 billion in 2019—nearly 20 per-
cent better than the previous year, de-
spite the threat of tariffs. 
‘‘Dreamliner jets built at Boeing 
Co.’s North Charleston plant and vehi-
cles manufactured by BMW in the Up-
state 
and 
Volvo 
cars 
in 
the 
Lowcountry combined for more than 
half of the total, or roughly $24.4 bil-
lion . . . . ‘’ 
‘‘The dollar amount of outbound 
goods has swelled by 68 percent since 
2011, and South Carolina now accounts 
for 35 percent of all U.S. tire exports 
and 16 percent of all U.S. vehicle ex-
ports.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Best wishes to Zach Caldwell on his 
visit to Washington.

Rachel O’Kelley is 1 of only 40 teach-
ers around the country to receive this 
award and the sole honoree for North 
Carolina. Each and every day, she goes 
above and beyond the status quo to 
challenge and engage her students 
through thoughtful, creative, and de-
manding activities. 
As we strive to entice students to fol-
low the STEM course of study, it is 
wonderful to have bright and driven 
teachers like Rachel who inspire stu-
dents to fulfill their potential and form 
the minds of future generations. 
It is my pleasure to honor Ms. 
O’Kelley here on the House floor for 
her continued devotion to eastern 
North Carolina’s next generation of 
leaders.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF NORMA COMNICK 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and leg-
acy of Norma Comnick of Anderson, 
California, a friend of mine I have 
known many years in the political 
scene. She was born in Texas, and she 
made some fine Texas chili for me, too. 
Norma moved to Anderson in the 
mid-eighties and was first elected to 
the city council in 1996, where she 
served for 21 years and five terms as 
mayor. She loved civic duty in her 
hometown. She was a fierce advocate 
for veterans and seniors, as well as 
bringing housing opportunities to the 
area. 
Her passion for her city extended 
well beyond her service on the city 
council. She dedicated much of her 
time to the Anderson Rotary, where 
she was inducted as one of the first two 
female members of that club, as well as 
a group called Anderson Explodes, 
which raises funds for Anderson’s an-
nual Fourth of July celebration, which 
they hold on the third, a massive fire-
works display for the 12,000 people who 
attend. 
She was a small business owner, hav-
ing an insurance agency in Anderson 
until retiring from that in 2004. 
I had the opportunity to attend her 
memorial service just a few days ago. 
It was beautiful. It was moving. Her 
great friends were there. 
Indeed, she was always, to the last, 
when I visited not too long ago, con-
cerned about how her citizens were 
doing in her area. Indeed, she has a 
great legacy and will be missed. She 
was a blessing.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which a recorded vote or the yeas 
and nays are ordered, or votes objected

EMMETT TILL ANTILYNCHING ACT 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 35) to amend section 249 of 
title 18, United States Code, to specify 
lynching as a hate crime act, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 35 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The crime of lynching succeeded slav-
ery as the ultimate expression of racism in 
the United States following Reconstruction. 
(2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged 
practice in the United States until the mid-
dle of the 20th century. 
(3) Lynching was a crime that occurred 
throughout the United States, with docu-
mented incidents in all but 4 States. 
(4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly Af-
rican Americans, were reported lynched in 
the United States between 1882 and 1968. 
(5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators 
of lynching escaped from punishment by 
State or local officials. 
(6) Lynching prompted African Americans 
to form the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (referred to in 
this section as the ‘‘NAACP’’) and prompted 
members of B’nai B’rith to found the Anti- 
Defamation League. 
(7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the 
NAACP and later as the executive secretary 
of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously 
investigated lynchings in the United States 
and worked tirelessly to end segregation and 
racialized terror. 
(8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were in-
troduced in Congress during the first half of 
the 20th century. 
(9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents peti-
tioned Congress to end lynching. 
(10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of 
Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynch-
ing measures. 
(11) Protection against lynching was the 
minimum and most basic of Federal respon-
sibilities, and the Senate considered but 
failed to enact anti-lynching legislation de-
spite 
repeated 
requests 
by 
civil 
rights 
groups, Presidents, and the House of Rep-
resentatives to do so. 
(12) The publication of ‘‘Without Sanc-
tuary: Lynching Photography in America’’ 
helped bring greater awareness and proper 
recognition of the victims of lynching. 
(13) Only by coming to terms with history 
can the United States effectively champion 
human rights abroad. 
(14) An apology offered in the spirit of true 
repentance moves the United States toward 
reconciliation and may become central to a 
new understanding, on which improved ra-
cial relations can be forged. 
(15) Having concluded that a reckoning 
with our own history is the only way the 
country can effectively champion human 
rights abroad, 90 Members of the United 
States Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 
39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to apolo-
gize to the victims of lynching and the de-
scendants of those victims for the failure of 
the Senate to enact anti-lynching legisla-
tion. 
(16) The National Memorial for Peace and 
Justice, which opened to the public in Mont-
gomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, is the 
Nation’s first memorial dedicated to the leg-
acy of enslaved Black people, people terror-
ized by lynching, African Americans humili-
ated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and 
people of color burdened with contemporary 
presumptions of guilt and police violence. 
(17) Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology 
and the heightened awareness and education 
about the Nation’s legacy with lynching, it 
is wholly necessary and appropriate for the 
Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years 
of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to 
make lynching a Federal crime. 
(18) Further, it is the sense of Congress 
that criminal action by a group increases the 
likelihood that the criminal object of that 
group will be successfully attained and de-
creases the probability that the individuals 
involved will depart from their path of crim-
inality. Therefore, it is appropriate to speci-
fy criminal penalties for the crime of lynch-
ing, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit 
lynching. 
(19) The United States Senate agreed to 
unanimously Senate Resolution 118, 115th 
Congress, on April 5, 2017, ‘‘[c]ondemning 
hate crime and any other form of racism, re-
ligious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incite-
ment to violence, or animus targeting a mi-
nority in the United States’’ and taking no-
tice specifically of Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation 
statistics 
demonstrating 
that 
‘‘among single-bias hate crime incidents in 
the United States, 59.2 percent of victims 
were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ances-
tral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 per-
cent were victims of crimes motivated by 
the offenders’ anti-Black or anti-African 
American bias’’. 
(20) On September 14, 2017, President Don-
ald J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint 
Resolution 49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 
1149), wherein Congress ‘‘condemn[ed] the 
racist violence and domestic terrorist attack 
that took place between August 11 and Au-
gust 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia’’ 
and ‘‘urg[ed] the President and his adminis-
tration to speak out against hate groups 
that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, 
anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and 
use all resources available to the President 
and the President’s Cabinet to address the 
growing prevalence of those hate groups in 
the United States’’. 
(21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public 
Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took 
notice of ‘‘hundreds of torch-bearing White 
nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, 
and neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Se-
mitic, and anti-immigrant slogans and vio-
lently engaged with counter-demonstrators 
on and around the grounds of the University 
of Virginia in Charlottesville’’ and that 
these groups ‘‘reportedly are organizing 
similar events in other cities in the United 
States and communities everywhere are con-
cerned about the growing and open display of 
hate and violence being perpetrated by those 
groups’’. 
(22) Lynching was a pernicious and perva-
sive tool that was used to interfere with 
multiple aspects of life—including the exer-
cise of Federally protected rights, as enu-
merated in section 245 of title 18, United 
States Code, housing rights, as enumerated 
in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 
(42 U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of reli-
gion, as enumerated in section 247 of title 18, 
United States Code. Interference with these

rights was often effectuated by multiple of-
fenders and groups, rather than isolated indi-
viduals. Therefore, prohibiting conspiracies 
to violate each of these rights recognizes the 
history of lynching in the United States and 
serves to prohibit its use in the future. 
SEC. 3. LYNCHING. 
(a) OFFENSE.—Chapter 13 of title 18, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end 
the following: 
‘‘§ 250. Lynching 
‘‘Whoever conspires with another person to 
violate section 245, 247, or 249 of this title or 
section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 
U.S.C. 3631) shall be punished in the same 
manner as a completed violation of such sec-
tion, except that if the maximum term of 
imprisonment for such completed violation 
is less than 10 years, the person may be im-
prisoned for not more than 10 years.’’. 
(b) TABLE OF SECTIONS AMENDMENT.—The 
table of sections for chapter 13 of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 249 the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘250. Lynching.’’. 
SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 35, the Emmett 
Till Antilynching Act is long overdue 
legislation 
that 
would 
criminalize 
lynching for the first time under Fed-
eral law. 
The term ‘‘lynching’’ generally refers 
to premeditated acts of violence often 
resulting in death carried out by a mob 
in order to punish an alleged trans-
gressor or to strike fear among a tar-
geted group. 
H.R. 35 is named in honor of Emmett 
Till, a 14-year-old African American 
youth from Chicago, who was lynched 
in particularly gruesome fashion while 
visiting an uncle in Mississippi in 1955. 
His murder and the antilynching move-
ment that followed set the stage for 
the creation of the civil rights move-
ment that we recognize today. 
Generally, they could not rely on law 
enforcement to protect them, because 
they understood that the lynchings oc-
curring throughout the South were a 
very deliberate campaign to subjugate 
our Black population. And this very de-
liberate campaign was started in the 
1870s by the Ku Klux Klan and carried 
on right up to the present day through 
terrorism and forced Jim Crow. 
Because they realized this, African 
Americans mobilized their own efforts 
to combat the terror of lynching and 
the threat of racial violence through 
grassroots activism and the founding of 
integrated social justice organizations. 
During the period between the Civil 
War and World War II, thousands of Af-
rican Americans were lynched in the 
United States, mostly in the South, 
but not entirely, as a means of racial 
subordination and enforcing white su-
premacy. These violent incidents were 
largely tolerated by State and Federal 
officials, in fact, often promoted by 
State and Federal officials. They pro-
foundly impacted race relations and 
shaped the geographic, political, social, 
and economic conditions of African 
American communities in ways that 
are still evident today. 
Although the civil rights conspiracy 
statute does not specify the offense of 
lynching as a Federal crime, this sec-
tion has been used by the Department 
of Justice to prosecute civil rights-era 
crimes and hate crimes that were de-
scribed as lynching in public discourse. 
It remains important, however, to 
enact Federal antilynching legislation 
to acknowledge this shameful chapter 
in American history and to send a clear 
message that such violations, such vio-
lent actions motivated by hatred and 
bigotry will never again be tolerated in 
this country. 
The first Federal antilynching legis-
lation was introduced in 1900, almost 
120 years ago, by Congressman George 
Henry White, the only African Amer-
ican member of Congress at that time. 
Unfortunately, neither his bill nor any 
other antilynching bills managed to 
pass the Congress. Antilynching bills 
were routinely defeated on this floor. 
Today, we act to correct this histor-
ical injustice that should rest heavily 
on the conscience of Members of Con-
gress. I thank the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RUSH) for his leadership on 
this important issue and for his atten-
tion to history. I also thank the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 
his support of this legislation and the 
many cosponsors of this bill who 
helped pave the way for its passage 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 35, the Em-
mett Till Antilynching Act. This act 
recalls a horrible period in our Nation’s 
history. In fact, many can claim this 
bill is a century too late. After all, the 
first antilynching bill was introduced, 
as was just said by the chairman, over 
100 years ago, but it never became law. 
Back then, lynchings were a popular 
atrocity committed by the Ku Klux 
Klan against the Black community, 
Catholics, and Jews, among others. 
Lynching, which is used to intimidate 
a certain populous, is the practice of 
murder by a group of people by 
extrajudicial action. 
Today, while not eliminated, and we 
are all striving for that, groups on all 
sides need to understand that this kind 
of intimidation of groups is not toler-
ated. That is why today these influ-
ences have been diminished but they 
are not resolved, and we want to con-
tinue to fight against this. This is why 
I support H.R. 35. 
There is one thing I would like to 
make a little clearer and probably 
more to the point, and that is that I be-
lieve H.R. 35, this measure, will ensure 
that those who engage in mob violence 
that results in death are dealt with ap-
propriately in the Federal system. I 
think it would have been more appro-
priate to actually place a certain pen-
alty in this bill as well, such as a de-
fined number of years for committing 
this offense since the justice for such a 
heinous act should be swift and cer-
tain. They should know what they are 
getting. 
I agree we can move forward with 
this, but I will disagree with my Demo-
cratic colleagues that we chose not to 
put that in this bill. I think that is 
something we can look forward to in 
the future. But this is a good bill. It 
needs to move forward. 
I am proud to support this bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 35. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH), 
the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I want to 
say to the chairman, I am just so de-
lighted and thankful and grateful for 
all of his work on behalf of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise 
today in support of my bill, H.R. 35, the 
Emmett Till Antilynching Act. 
Lynching, Madam Speaker, plain and 
simple, is an American evil. This atroc-
ity is comparable to the French use of 
the guillotine, the Roman Empire’s use 
of crucifixion, and the British use of 
drawing and quartering as a tool of ter-
rorism. And for too long, Madam 
Speaker, Federal law against lynching 
has remained conspicuously silent. 
In 1918, 102 years ago, a Congressman 
from Missouri, Leonidas C. Dyer, intro-
duced the first antilynching legislation 
to actually pass the House, a bill that 
would subsequently die in the Senate. 
Therefore, I am pleased that the lan-
guage that we are voting on today has 
already been approved by the Senate, 
and I am exceptionally hopeful that it 
will face no further obstacles on its 
path to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, many may consider 
lynching to be a relic of the past, but 
as we all know, unfortunately, recent

events have shown us that this is not 
the case. Instead, we have seen a rise in 
race-based 
violence 
that 
has 
cul-
minated in events like the white su-
premacist rally in Charlottesville, Vir-
ginia, or the racially motivated mass 
shooting in El Paso, Texas. 
That is why, Madam Speaker, it is so 
important that we stand united today 
as a body and as a Congress to pass this 
bill. In passing this bill today, we send 
a resoundingly strong message about 
what we are as a Nation, our country’s 
values and, more importantly, what we 
as Americans stand for and what we 
will tolerate and what we will not tol-
erate. 
Today, Madam Speaker, we send a 
strong message that violence and race- 
based violence, in particular, has no 
place in American society. That is why 
I am so proud to have introduced this 
bill, and I am even prouder that we are 
considering it on the floor today. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. RUSH) and his pas-
sion there with that speech. 
It is my privilege now to introduce 
someone who has a similar passion and 
also has worked on this bill and done a 
great deal for it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield as much 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
Chairman RUSH for his leadership, his 
heart for this bill, and I thank the 
chairman and the ranking member for 
giving me a chance to speak and for 
their comments. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 35, the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act. I am pleased to see 
the House take steps in finally address-
ing this issue. Like many, despite our 
Nation’s ugly history of lynchings, I 
was shocked to learn that there was no 
law making lynching a Federal crime. 
My hometown area of Omaha is not 
unlike many other towns across the 
country with a gruesome past of lynch-
ing. George Smith was murdered in Oc-
tober 1891, and this past fall marked 
the 100th anniversary of the murder of 
Will Brown on the steps of the Douglas 
County Courthouse during the Red 
Summer. The hands of lawless and 
angry mobs in Omaha beat and lynched 
these men in what only can be charac-
terized as racial terrorism. 
We cannot simply wash away the 
past, but in order for our Nation to 
heal from past racial injustice, Con-
gress must specify criminal penalties 
for the crime of lynching or any at-
tempt or conspiracy to commit lynch-
ing. 
With at least 5,000 lynchings in our 
Nation’s history, this bill is important 
to the acknowledgment that evil did 
occur, that millions felt fear in their 
houses, their homes, and their commu-
nities, that many feared for the lives of 
their dads, their husbands, and sons, 
and that this formal acknowledgment 
will help facilitate reconciliation. 
Last year, I was approached by local 
African American community leaders 
from 
Omaha 
to 
look 
into 
the 
antilynching legislation, and I felt that 
the language from Senator HARRIS’ bill 
that passed with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support in the Senate was the 
right way to proceed. It is because of 
these reasons I was honored to intro-
duce the Senate-passed language in the 
House 8 months ago. 
The bill we are voting on today con-
tains the language of my bill that I in-
troduced 8 months ago verbatim, but I 
do not complain because in the end I 
want results. We want results. We are 
closer than we have ever been to mak-
ing lynching a Federal crime. This is 
an historical event. 
This action is long overdue, going 
back 200 attempts since 1918, and today 
we are going to get it done. We are 
going to make history. 
It has been my privilege to be an ad-
vocate on this issue. I applaud Senator 
HARRIS and Congressman BOBBY RUSH, 
who have been championing this for 
years. We will finally get this to the 
President’s desk to be signed into law 
in order to close one of the ugliest 
chapters in our history once and for 
all. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BASS). 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 35. 
Today, the House will pass the Em-
mett Till Antilynching Act and des-
ignate lynching as a hate crime under 
Federal law. But we must admit, it is a 
travesty that it has taken 120 years for 
the U.S. Government to address this 
crime. In fact, the first bill to outlaw 
lynching was introduced in 1900. 
Make no mistake, lynching is ter-
rorism. It is terrorism directed at Afri-
can Americans. Lynching was com-
monly used for 256 years during the pe-
riod of enslavement and for almost 100 
years after slavery, well into the 1950s. 
And, frankly, even today, periodi-
cally you will hear news stories of 
nooses being left on college campuses, 
in work locker rooms to threaten and 
terrorize African Americans, a vicious 
reminder that the past is never that far 
away. In fact, the last known victim of 
lynching was just 25 years ago, and for 
the first time in history, the perpe-
trator was actually convicted and exe-
cuted. 
We often like to only talk about the 
glorious parts of our history, and it is 
difficult for us to hear some of the ugly 
parts, but it is important that we do 
hear and understand our history in 
full. This form of terrorism was used to 
kill Black people and terrorize and ter-
rify those who were not murdered into 
understanding they were not consid-
ered as humans. 
Today, in Montgomery, Alabama, 
there is the National Memorial for 
Peace and Justice, and I hope that ev-
eryone has an opportunity to see that 
because it is the only place in our 
country that actually documents in 
every State where known lynchings 
were taken place and in every county. 
Lynchings were advertised in news-
papers as recreational events that fam-
ilies would attend. They would have 
picnics while they watched brutal mur-
ders take place. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
b 1230 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I want to 
leave with a 1930 editorial in the Ra-
leigh News and Observer that noted the 
elation of the audience witnessing a 
lynching as follows: ‘‘Men joked loudly 
at the sight of the bleeding body. . . . 
Girls giggled as the flies fed on the 
blood that dripped from the Negro’s 
nose.’’ 
Lynchings were brutal, violent, and 
savage public spectacles. As I said, 
they were advertised in newspapers, 
and postcards were sold. Souvenirs 
were made from victims’ remains. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I would inquire of the gentle-
woman, Ms. BASS, if she needs some 
more time. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I do not 
need additional time. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I was going to give the gentle-
woman some of my time, but she is 
done. I just wanted to make sure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the chairperson, and the 
ranking member as well, for bringing 
this legislation to the floor today. I 
also thank the majority leader, who 
happens to be in the room. 
Madam Speaker, this piece of legisla-
tion is more than 100 years in the mak-
ing, and it does deal with lynching, but 
truth be told, more than a lynching 
took place. 
Emmett Till’s body was mutilated. 
He was shot in the head, and he was 
thrown in the Tallahatchie River. His 
mother insisted on an open casket. 
This was the thing that sent shock 
waves across this country, causing peo-
ple to rethink what was happening in 
the South. 
Yes, he was lynched. Yes, this is the 
unfinished business of this House. And 
we have much more unfinished busi-
ness. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to com-
mend Congressman BOBBY RUSH for the 
outstanding job that he has done, as 
well as his cosponsors, in bringing this 
legislation to the floor. It is time. In 
fact, it is past time. And I am grateful 
that this House is taking up this legis-
lation. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.

Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The previous speaker, Mr. GREEN 
from Texas, said that it is time, that it 
is past time. But it is never too late to 
do the right thing. 
I am pleased that this will be a bipar-
tisan vote. 
This is about Emmett Till. It is 
about lynching. It is about violence. It 
is about hate. But in a larger sense, 
this is about who we are as a country, 
who we are as a country that said: ‘‘We 
hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal.’’ 
Surely, our Founders today would 
have said all men and women are cre-
ated equal. 
But in the eyes of two murderers, 
Emmett Till was neither equal nor a 
fellow human being, but a dehumanized 
being, undeserving of protection or of 
decency. 
To the surprise, I think, of probably 
many 
Americans, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
lynching has not been described as a 
hate crime. We will do that today. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. COLLINS 
and Chairman NADLER for bringing this 
bill to the floor. The House will make 
that determination today. I am proud 
to bring this legislation to the floor as 
majority leader. 
A broadcaster in our area, Joe Madi-
son, came up to me some year and a 
half ago and said: Why can’t you pass 
lynching legislation? 
I had no answer, so I went to the 
chair of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, who spoke just earlier, KAREN 
BASS, the former speaker of the Cali-
fornia Assembly, one of the leaders in 
this House. I said to her: ‘‘Karen, I 
want to make sure that we get lynch-
ing legislation on the floor.’’ 
I talked to my friend, BOBBY RUSH, 
who I have been a close friend of for 
more than two decades, a leader in this 
House, a leader on the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
and 
in 
this 
House. I talked to him about it. I 
talked to him about his legislation. 
Two Senators also had legislation. I 
am glad that they were able to come 
together and that we have this legisla-
tion before us. 
BOBBY RUSH represents the district in 
which Emmett Till lived. 
Emmett Till took a summer vacation 
to Mississippi. It was his last vacation. 
He came to be, and continues to this 
day to be, a symbol of the terror and 
hate and atrocities and prejudice di-
rected against American citizens whose 
color of skin was different than some 
others. This should be a lesson to us 
all. 
Then you see movies like ‘‘Hidden 
Figures,’’ the heroine of which just 
died a few days ago at the age of 101, or 
‘‘The Help,’’ or ‘‘Harriet,’’ Harriet Tub-
man from my State, to see the violence 
that was visited on our fellow human 
beings because of the color of their 
skin. 
If Elijah Cummings, my colleague, 
were alive today, he would say: ‘‘We 
are better than this.’’ 
That is what this legislation is say-
ing: We are better than this. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive RUSH, Chairman NADLER, Ranking 
Member COLLINS, the Congressional 
Black 
Caucus, 
Chairwoman 
KAREN 
BASS, and the CBC itself for their work 
on this bill. 
The Senate passed a similar bill last 
year, and, Madam Speaker, I thank 
Senators Booker and Harris for their 
work. 
I hope we can get this to the Presi-
dent’s desk and signed quickly. 
It is very fitting that this legislation 
will be named in memory of Emmett 
Till, 
the 
14-year-old 
whose 
brutal 
lynching in 1955 marked a turning 
point in America’s history. 
Many Americans might associate the 
term ‘‘lynching’’ with hanging, but if 
you go to the dictionary, it has a 
broader definition: the premeditated, 
extrajudicial killing by a mob or group 
of people in order to instill fear, to in-
timidate, to subjugate populations and 
individuals, and to enforce a social 
order on people, contrary to the con-
cepts out of which America was born. 
According to the Tuskegee Institute, 
by the time of Emmett Till’s murder, 
it had recorded more than 4,700 victims 
of lynching in America since the 1880s. 
We had a Civil War, the 13th, 14th, 
and 15th Amendments, and still, from 
1870 to the 1960s, there were people who 
thought, with impunity, they could 
take the lives or brutalize others—with 
impunity. 
Even today, we continue to see the 
memory of lynchings used to instill 
fear 
and 
threaten 
minority 
popu-
lations, from nooses being displayed as 
hate speech to threats of political vio-
lence using imagery of lynching. We 
still live with its dark legacy. 
Madam Speaker, I say to my col-
leagues, as we continue to observe 
Black History Month throughout Feb-
ruary, let us resolve to commemorate 
that history by doing our part to cor-
rect its injustices. 
I paraphrase Martin Luther King 
when he said: Do not worry so much 
about the voices of your opponents as 
you worry about the silence of your 
friends. 
Madam Speaker, this day, the House 
of Representatives shall not be silent. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 35, the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act, a bill that will speci-
fy lynching as a hate crime. 
This bill corrects a longstanding 
omission from Federal civil rights law. 
Historically, nearly 200 antilynching 
bills were filibustered out of existence 
or just plain ignored. 
Lynchings were violent and public 
acts of torture used for nearly a cen-
tury to enforce racial segregation. 
This legislation is long overdue. 
Lynchings were wrong, immoral, and 
inhumane. 
This bill is named in honor of Em-
mett Till, a 14-year-old African Amer-
ican youth from Chicago who was 
lynched in my district in 1955 while vis-
iting an uncle in Mississippi. 
There is a memorial dedicated to Mr. 
Till in my district. Unfortunately, it is 
the only memorial in America that has 
to be bulletproof. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman 
for 
yielding 
an 
additional 
minute. 
In years past, the signs have been 
stolen, thrown in the river, replaced; 
shot, replaced again; shot again; de-
faced with acid; and had ‘‘KKK’’ spray- 
painted on them. 
The signs were placed near the spot 
where Mr. Till’s body was pulled from 
the Tallahatchie River in 1955. 
The 14-year-old was tortured and 
killed by two White men after false ac-
cusations that he flirted with a White 
woman. 
His death became an important cata-
lyst in the civil rights movement. 
With the passage of this bill, we hope 
to heal the past and present racial in-
justice. Our country is in need of rec-
onciliation. 
Lynching claimed the lives of an im-
measurable number of African Ameri-
cans, yet the perpetrators were never 
held accountable. Conversely, official 
inaction has left lasting scars on our 
communities. 
Today, I represent Mississippi’s Sec-
ond Congressional District, which in-
cludes the area where Emmett Till was 
lynched. His murderers were never held 
accountable for what they did. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. COLLINS 
very much for yielding. 
This is kind of emotional for me, be-
cause I knew this young man’s mother 
before she died, a very wonderful lady 
who suffered an unfortunate tragedy at 
the hands of some dastardly individ-
uals. 
But more importantly, we are a bet-
ter country than what that deed dic-
tates. 
I support Congressman RUSH’s bill. It 
is a bill that is long overdue. But just 
as important, we have to commit our-
selves to making this country a better 
country. 
In the little town of Glendora, where 
the fan that was attached to young 
Emmett’s 
body 
that

a little museum dedicated not only to 
Mr. Till, but to the atrocities that have 
occurred in my district over time. 
Madam Speaker, I compliment those 
individuals for putting the museum to-
gether and also for dedicating them-
selves to letting the world know what 
happened, but also recommitting our-
selves to try not to let it happen again. 
So we must pass this legislation, 
Madam Speaker. We must pass it to 
correct the inactions of those before 
us. The inaction of others does not re-
lieve one of the obligation to do what 
is right. 
b 1245 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, let me thank the gen-
tleman for yielding, and, of course, I 
come to join with all of those who have 
extolled the virtues of this bill and 
urge its passage. I also reflect on the 
fact that I grew up in the State of Ar-
kansas. 
My father, who was a tremendous 
historian, would often point to places 
and show us sites in trees where 
lynchings were supposed to have taken 
place. The fact that we are now saying 
that any lynching activity should be a 
Federal crime is one that I concur 
with. 
I want to thank the Reverend Jesse 
Jackson because that is really who 
called me one day and said: You know, 
we need to do something about this. 
So I was pleased to interact with 
Congressman RUSH and say: Let’s do 
something about this. 
I want to thank Congressman RUSH 
for taking the leadership on this bill. I 
want to thank the Judiciary Com-
mittee for passing it. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is a bill that is 
long past due. It should have been done 
many years ago, and it was not. It is 
now time to get this done. 
As was said by the majority leader 
and others, this was a heinous act done 
by a mob for one purpose besides the 
killing: It is also to intimidate and to 
put fear into others. 
In my State of Georgia, it not only 
happened because of the color of some-
one’s skin, but by the creed of Catholic 
and Jews it had taken place as well. 
This should never happen again. This 
is a good step forward. I think it is 
something that is long overdue. I urge 
all my colleagues to support the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
In his farewell address to Congress, 
Representative George Henry White la-
mented the failure of his antilynching 
bill of 1900 to pass by observing that: 
‘‘During the last session of this Con-
gress, I took occasion to address myself 
in detail to this particular measure, 
But with all of my efforts, the bill still 
sweetly sleeps in the room of the com-
mittee to which it was referred. The 
necessity of legislation along this line 
is daily being demonstrated. The arena 
of the lyncher no longer is confined to 
Southern climes, but is stretching its 
hydra head over all parts of the 
Union.’’ 
Lynching no longer terrorizes Afri-
can American communities as it once 
did, but we owe it to the memory of its 
thousands of victims to outlaw this 
racist and gruesome practice once and 
for all. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I want to just commend the 
chairman for a moment on bringing 
this bill up. I think there have been a 
lot of things that we have disagreed on 
and there have been many places where 
we have seen that—we probably will do 
it again this afternoon—but just to 
have this time, I think, to reflect and, 
I think, from my State of Georgia and 
from New York and all over. 
The gentleman made a statement, 
and I wanted to commend the gen-
tleman for that, that this was hap-
pening all over. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman is talking too fast. I can’t 
understand him. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, the gentleman has been say-
ing that for a year, so I will go slow. 
I thank the gentleman for bringing 
this forward and thank him for being a 
part, and also the discussion among 
many of the Members here. 
This is a discussion not limited to 
one area. It was highlighted by the Em-
mett Till death, but it was also some-
thing that America needed to deal 
with. By bringing this forward today, I 
think that is a testament to both of 
our committees being able to work to-
gether and both of us being able to 
bring something together that Ameri-
cans can understand. 
Lynching was far beyond a murder. It 
was also an intimidation method that 
we saw used in many States in many 
areas. So I just want to commend 
Madam Speaker for that, and also com-
mend the chairman. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time, I thank the gen-
tleman very much. I certainly agree 
with the distinguished ranking mem-
ber, and I appreciate his support for 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
thank him and the ranking member for 
bringing this legislation to the floor. It 
is so appropriate that it is bipartisan 
because it is about American values. I 
rise to join you in passing H.R. 35, the 
Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which 
finally explicitly designates lynching 
as a Federal hate crime. 
More than a century ago, the first 
antilynching 
legislation 
was 
intro-
duced and later passed by this House 
‘‘to assure to persons within the juris-
diction of every State the equal protec-
tion of the laws and to punish the 
crime of lynching.’’ But over 100 years 
and 200 attempts later at passage, it is 
still not law. 
I salute Congressman BOBBY SCOTT— 
excuse me, BOBBY RUSH. I know BOBBY 
SCOTT had something to do with this as 
well, but, in this case, the leadership of 
BOBBY
RUSH—a lifelong civil rights 
champion in the Congress and in our 
country, for his leadership on H.R. 35, 
which will right this historic wrong. 
I thank Chairwoman KAREN BASS of 
the Congressional Black Caucus for her 
commitment and that of the entire 
Congressional Black Caucus for bring-
ing this legislation to the floor. 
I thank Chairman NADLER and Rank-
ing Member COLLINS for their leader-
ship as well, and Senators CORY BOOK-
ER and KAMALA HARRIS for leading this 
legislation in the Senate. 
Today, Congress has an opportunity 
to acknowledge its responsibility for 
its historic failure to confront and end 
the horror of lynching in America. We 
must 
begin 
by 
acknowledging 
the 
heartbreaking truth that racially mo-
tivated acts of terror have long been a 
part of American history and that they 
remain a stain on our Nation’s soul 
today. 
We must never forget: 
The massacre in Wilmington, North 
Carolina, 122 years ago in which 60 
Black Americans were brutally mur-
dered; 
The race massacre in the Greenwood 
District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, 100 years 
ago next year, called the single worst 
incident of racial violence in American 
history; 
The mutilation and murder of Em-
mett Till—for whom this legislation is 
named, a 14-year-old boy—65 years ago, 
one of the most appalling acts of racial 
violence in our history, forever seared 
in our collective memory; 
And we must remember the victims 
of more than 4,000 other lynchings and 
countless other acts of racial terror 
perpetrated throughout our Nation’s 
history. 
As recent events remind us, racially 
motivated violence and other forms of 
violence and hate targeting vulnerable 
communities are not a relic of the past.

22 innocent souls in El Paso after pen-
ning a racist, anti-Latino screed on the 
internet; and when an anti-Semitic 
murderer kills 11 innocent men and 
women engaged in peaceful prayer at 
the Tree of Life synagogue in Pitts-
burgh we cannot deny that racism, big-
otry, and hate still exist in America. 
As Members of Congress and as 
Americans, we have a responsibility to 
acknowledge the horrors of the past so 
that we can never have them occur 
again. 
As Ida B. Wells, the crusading jour-
nalist, 
antilynching 
advocate, 
and 
founding member of the NAACP said: 
‘‘The way to right wrongs is to turn 
the light of truth upon them.’’ 
This legislation will not erase the 
stain of lynching and racist violence, 
but it will help shine the light of truth 
on the injustices of the past so that we 
can heal our Nation and build a better, 
safer future for all of our children. 
In just over a week, many Members 
will travel to Selma, Alabama, to ob-
serve 55 years since the march for free-
dom. With the passage of this bill, we 
can make that pilgrimage—praying at 
the Brown Chapel AME Church and 
marching over the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge—with 
dignity, 
respect, 
and 
honor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a unanimous 
vote for H.R. 35. 
Again, I thank the chairman and the 
ranking member for their leadership. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 35—the 
Emmett Till Antilynching Act. This bill amends 
section 249 of title 18, United States Code, to 
specify lynching as a hate crime under federal 
law. It corrects a longstanding omission from 
Federal civil rights law. It is without question 
that this legislation is long overdue and need-
ed even today. 
The legacy of lynching is a stain on our na-
tion’s history, and the racism that motivated 
lynchings continues to fuel acts of hate today. 
This legislation should pass with strong and 
eager bipartisan support. 
This bill is named after Emmett Till who was 
only 14 years old when he was lynched in 
1955 
in 
Mississippi. 
A 
lynching 
is 
an 
extrajudicial killing by a mob, and is not limited 
to deaths by hanging. He was so badly tor-
tured that he was left unrecognizable. This 
was done here in America by Americans dur-
ing a Jim Crow era in a segregated frag-
mented society. Now in 2020, this hateful leg-
acy is unfortunately raising its head again forc-
ing us to defend our basic values. While we 
celebrate our freedom here in the United 
States and abroad, we must continue to be 
diligent in remembering our true history. 
The legacy of lynching in Texas can never 
be erased. The families and communities of 
victims are still impacted today. Even in my 
hometown of Waco, Texas, Jesse Wash-
ington, a seventeen-year-old farmhand was 
mutilated and burned to death, on May 15, 
1916, in what became one of the most well 
known documented cases of lynching. Sadly, 
in Texas, there are hundreds of others. 
The designation under federal law is impor-
tant and most relevant because state law did 
not protect the rights of the victims of 
lynchings. Horribly true, many of the lynchings 
were carried out either by officers and rep-
resentatives of the law or with the blessings of 
local law enforcement. African Americans and 
other people of color did not receive the same 
protections under the law that every American 
should have received. That is why this des-
ignation of lynching as a hate crime under fed-
eral law is critical even today. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill, im-
prove federal law and protect the rights of 
every person in the United States. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I strongly 
support the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. I will 
be proud to vote in favor of it on the House 
floor today. I have continuously fought against 
racial violence and racial discrimination, and 
this legislation is an important step forward. 
This bill recognizes the federal role in di-
rectly confronting this type of racial violence. 
In his case, Emmett Till, an innocent African 
American boy, lost his life. His death came to 
symbolize the continual threat of violence that 
hung over the African American community 
and helped spark the Civil Rights Movement. 
But this bill, named for Till, goes beyond his 
circumstances. It also provides some modicum 
of justice for the victims of the People’s Gro-
cery Lynching in Memphis. Thomas Moss, 
Calvin McDowell, and Will Stewart were false-
ly accused and killed in Memphis on March 9, 
1892. These three men were killed because 
they ‘‘were becoming economic competitors to 
whites.’’ For my district and the country, this 
vote is recognizing all the men and women 
who were lynched and never received any jus-
tice. 
In passing this bill, the House of Represent-
atives will clearly say these types of actions— 
this type of hate—have no place in our coun-
try. 
Unfortunately, this isn’t a historic phe-
nomenon. Now, in the year 2020, we still 
struggle with bias motivated crimes, racial vio-
lence, and vigilantism. We see the continu-
ation of racial violence directed at African 
Americans and other minorities today. 
I will continue to fight for equality and racial 
justice. I am proud to support this legislation 
and thank Rep. BOBBY RUSH, Speaker PELOSI, 
Leader HOYER, and Chairman NADLER for their 
leadership. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 35, the Emmett Till 
Antilynching Act, which amends 18 U.S. Code 
249, to establish the act of lynching as a fed-
eral hate crime. 
I thank our colleague, Congressman BOBBY 
RUSH of Illinois, for his work in shepherding 
this 
legislation 
and 
acknowledging 
the 
unfathomable, barbaric history of lynching. 
The Civil Rights Act of 1968 is the closest 
our country has ever come to adopting 
antilynching legislation. 
The Emmett Till Antilynching Act is nec-
essary legislation, intended to bring justice to 
victims of lynching, to heal past and present 
racial injustice and prevent these wretched, 
gruesome acts from continuing to occur. 
Ida B. Wells, the renowned educator, inves-
tigative journalist, and Civil Rights activist ad-
vocated tirelessly from 1886 to 1931 for the 
passage of antilynching legislation and col-
lected data to show the vast scope of racial 
tensions and hate crimes. 
In October 1892, Ms. Wells published re-
search on lynching in a pamphlet entitled 
Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases 
and continued to write, speak and organize for 
the recognition of lynching as a crime and for 
civil rights until her death in 1931. 
She traveled internationally, teaching foreign 
audiences about the intensity and severity of 
American racial tensions. 
Ms. Wells’ contributions to the Civil Rights 
Movement and American political discourse 
are still immensely influential and we look to 
her as a leader and role model to this day. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center reports 
that its research uncovered approximately 75 
other people who died violently between 1952 
and 1968 under circumstances suggesting that 
they were victims of racial violence. 
For most of them, the reason their names 
were not added to the Memorial is because 
not enough was known about the details sur-
rounding their deaths. 
Sadly, the reason so little is known about 
these cases is because they were not fully in-
vestigated or, in some cases, law enforcement 
officials were involved in the killings or subse-
quent cover-ups. 
And because the killings of African Ameri-
cans were often covered up or not seriously 
investigated, there is little reason to doubt that 
many slayings were never even recorded by 
the authorities. 
The reason justice had not been served was 
the callous indifference, and often the criminal 
collusion, of many white law enforcement offi-
cials in the segregated South. 
The all-white, all-male jury acquitted Roy 
Bryant and J.W. Milam for the murder of Em-
mett Till, with the two men posing for photo-
graphs and lighting cigars after the verdict was 
announced. 
There simply was no justice for African 
Americans during the civil rights era. 
The entire criminal justice system—from the 
police, to the prosecutors, to the juries, and to 
the judges—was perverted by racial bigotry. 
African Americans were routinely beaten, 
bombed and shot with impunity. 
Sometimes, the killers picked their victims 
on a whim. 
Sometimes, they targeted them for their ac-
tivism. 
Many times, prominent white citizens were 
involved and no consequences flowed. 
Herbert Lee of Liberty, Mississippi, for ex-
ample, was shot in the head by a state legis-
lator, E.H. Hurst, in broad daylight in 1961. 
It is, of course, fitting and proper that this 
legislation bears the name of Emmett Till, 
whose slaying in 1955 and his mother’s brave 
decision to have an open casket at his funeral 
stirred the nation’s conscience and galvanized 
a generation of Americans to join the fight for 
equality. 
Sadly, hundreds of them were killed in that 
struggle, and many of the killers, like those of 
Emmett himself, were never successfully pros-
ecuted. 
Madam Speaker, over the past half century, 
the United States has made tremendous 
progress in overcoming the badges and 
vestiges of slavery. 
But this progress has been purchased at 
great cost. 
Examples of unsolved cases include the 
1968 ‘‘Orangeburg Massacre’’ at South Caro-
lina State University where state police shot 
and killed three student protesters; the 1967 
shooting death of Carrie Brumfield, whose 
body was found on a rural Louisiana road; the

1957 murder of Willie Joe Sanford, whose 
body 
was 
fished 
out 
of 
a 
creek 
in 
Hawkinsville, Georgia; the 1946 killing of a 
black couple, including a pregnant woman, 
who was pulled out of a car in Monroe, Geor-
gia, and dragged down a wagon trail before 
being shot in front of 200 people. 
Solving cases like these is part of the unfin-
ished work of America. 
Madam Speaker, 53 years ago, Medgar 
Evers was murdered in Jackson, Mississippi; 
justice would not be done in his case for more 
than twenty years. 
But that day was foretold because the 
evening before the death of Medgar Evers, on 
June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy 
addressed the nation from the Oval Office on 
the state of race relations and civil rights in 
America. 
In his historic speech to the nation President 
Kennedy said: 
‘‘We are confronted primarily with a moral 
issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as 
clear as the American Constitution. 
‘‘One hundred years of delay have passed 
since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet 
their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. 
They are not yet freed from the bonds of injus-
tice. They are not yet freed from social and 
economic oppression. And this Nation, for all 
its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully 
free until all its citizens are free.’’ 
H.R. 35 will help ensure that justice is re-
ceived by those for whom justice has been de-
layed. 
In doing so, this legislation will help this Na-
tion fulfill its hopes and justify its boast that in 
America all persons live in freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support this leg-
islation and urge all Members to join me in 
voting for its passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 35, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

poned.

NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS

Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 560) to amend section 6 of the 
Joint Resolution entitled ‘‘A Joint 
Resolution to approve the Covenant To 
Establish a Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands in Political 
Union with the United States of Amer-
ica, and for other purposes’’, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 560 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Northern 
Mariana Islands Residents Relief Act’’.

ERN MARIANA ISLANDS. 
Section 6(e)(6)(B) of the Joint Resolution 
entitled ‘‘A Joint Resolution to approve the 
Covenant To Establish a Commonwealth of 
the Northern Mariana Islands in Political 
Union with the United States of America, 
and for other purposes’’, approved March 24, 
1976 (48 U.S.C. 1806), is amended— 
(1) in clause (iii), by inserting ‘‘except in 
the case of an alien who meets the require-
ments of subclause (VI) of clause (v),’’ before 
‘‘resided continuously and lawfully’’; and 
(2) in clause (v)—

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-

such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 560, which was 
introduced by my colleague, the Dele-
gate from the Northern Mariana Is-
lands (Mr. SABLAN), will address an 
issue involving certain long-term resi-
dents in his district that was not ad-
dressed when we extended the U.S. im-
migration laws to the CNMI in 2009. 
The Natural Resources Committee 
held a markup of the bill on September 
18, 2019, and ordered the bill reported 
favorably to the House by voice. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from the Northern Mariana Islands 
(Mr. SABLAN) to explain his legislation. 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time. 
I have been working for the last 
dozen years to make the transition to 
Federal immigration policy in the Mar-
ianas as least difficult as possible. 
In 2018, with Chairman ROB BISHOP’s 
essential help, we protected the rights 
of U.S. workers against the unfair com-
petition from foreign workers in the 
Marianas’ economy with Public Law 
115–218. 
Last year, President Trump signed 
Public Law 116–24 and helped us con-
vert about 1,000 people living under ad-
ministrative parole into residents with 
a permanent legal status in the Mari-
anas only, not eligible for any public 
charge at all. 
Just last week, the administration 
issued the necessary guidance to allow 
those 1,000 people to begin the applica-
tion process, and I am very grateful to 
the President and to everyone at 
USCIS and the Department of Home-
land Security for their support. 
Today’s bill, H.R. 560, continues this 
work of smoothing over the rough 
places in the application of national 
immigration law to my isolated dis-
trict. 
H.R. 560 provides the same perma-
nent status—in the Marianas only— 
that President Trump approved for pa-
rolees in June. This time, we want to 
give stability to a small group of inves-
tors who were in the Marianas even be-
fore Federal immigration. They have 
been holding on with short-term visas 
ever since, never certain from year to 
year about their business investments. 
b 1300 
We want to give the same certainty 
to a group of long-term workers—some 
of whom have been in the Marianas for 
40 years—and to the businesses that 
employ them. 
The Natural Resources Committee 
held a hearing on H.R. 560 last Feb-
ruary. Our Republican Governor, the 
Honorable Ralph Torres, testified in 
favor of the bill. The Trump adminis-
tration did not take a position, but 
their witness said: ‘‘Without a sus-
tained labor force, projected invest-
ment in the CNMI likely will wither.’’ 
Well, we can do something to avoid 
that consequence by passing H.R. 560. 
Again, this bill is Marianas only. It has 
bipartisan support. Chairman GRIJALVA 
and Ranking Member BISHOP are both 
cosponsors, for which I am grateful. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all Members 
now to vote in favor. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as was just de-
scribed, H.R. 560 would extend North-
ern Mariana Islands-only resident sta-
tus for two groups of foreign nationals: 
individuals who came to Northern Mar-
iana Islands as transitional workers in 
2015, and individuals who have resided

in the Northern Mariana Islands with 
an investor status. 
These individuals were excluded from 
a June 2019 law that allowed other 
classes of current Northern Mariana Is-
lands workers to remain in the terri-
tory. If signed into law, H.R. 560 would 
allow approximately 3,000 additional 
foreign nationals to remain there long 
term. 
Now, bear in mind that the entire 
population of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands is about 55,000, so just this addi-
tion of foreign nationals comprises 
about 5 percent of the entire popu-
lation of the islands. 
While I appreciate the majority did 
take this bill through regular order, I 
am still disappointed that it has not 
been willing to work with the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security or even 
wait for it to consider the impact of 
the bill before moving it to the floor. 
As the Department of Homeland Se-
curity is charged with managing pro-
grams that allow foreign nationals to 
work in the Northern Mariana Islands 
and elsewhere, I believe it is critical to 
have their views on something they 
will be charged with executing. 
Further, it is my continued hope that 
this body remains committed to pro-
moting an American workforce rather 
than that of a foreign one. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 560, as

The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2427) to amend the Chesa-
peake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 to re-
authorize the Chesapeake Bay Gate-
ways and Watertrails Network, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2427 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

inserting ‘‘2025’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2427, intro-
duced by Representative SARBANES, 
would reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay 
Gateways and Watertrails Network. 
The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and 
Watertrails Network is a State, local, 
and Federal partnership that helps the 
National Park Service and its partners 
connect people to the Chesapeake Bay 
and its tributaries. 
This system of more than 170 sites 
tells the story of the connection be-
tween people and nature throughout 
the region and has been critical for ex-
panding public access to the Chesa-
peake Bay, supporting enhanced inter-
pretation, education, youth employ-
ment, and recreation associated with 
the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 
This program is a great example of 
collaboration and partnership, and I 
want to thank my colleague from 
Maryland for his hard work to ensure 
that it succeeds. 
The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and 
Watertrails Network deserves our sup-
port, and so I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill and authorize this pro-
gram for an additional 5 years. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 2427 reauthorizes appropriations 
at current levels for the Chesapeake 
Bay Initiative Act of 1998 taking us 
through the year 2025. 
Much of the early history of our 
country was written on the Chesapeake 
Bay. Eight recognized American Indian 
Tribes maintain ancestral homes there. 
It is the site of Jamestown and the 
early English settlements. It was a 
center for the great Yankee trading 
ships, the birthplace of George Wash-
ington, the site of Fort McHenry, and 
the main line of the Underground Rail-
road which took so many to their free-
dom. 
The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and 
Watertrails Network, originally au-
thorized through the Chesapeake Bay 
Initiative Act of 1998, set up a network 
of Chesapeake Bay-related sites such as 
parks, wildlife refuges, and trails. The 
program includes 160 sites in six States 
and the District of Columbia. The Na-
tional Park Service provides matching 
grants for projects that enhance public 
education about and access to the 
Chesapeake Bay. 
At a time when so many are losing 
touch with our country’s proud herit-
age—or even denigrating that herit-
age—it is all the more important to 
keep alive the memory of those great 
days that set the American Nation on 
its path to prosperity and freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from California for 
his support of the bill. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2427, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed.

Word We Utter Monument to establish 
a commemorative work in the District 
of Columbia and its environs, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, ‘‘Every word we 
utter, every act we perform, waft unto 
innumerable circles beyond.’’ Those are 
the words Elizabeth Cady Stanton that 
inspired the movement for H.R. 473, 
which will create Washington, D.C.’s 
first statue memorializing the women’s 
suffrage movement. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
honor 
the 
diverse 
and 
multigenerational group of women who 
fought for decades to secure women the 
right to vote. 
This bill is strongly bipartisan and, 
in accordance with the Commemora-
tive Works Act, will cost nothing to 
the Federal Government. It received 
positive feedback from the National 
Capital Memorial Advisory Commis-
sion and passed the Natural Resources 
Committee with bipartisan support in 
October. 
Leading women’s organizations are 
in support of H.R. 473, including the 
Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commis-
sion and multiple chapters of the 
American Association of University 
Women as well as the League of Women 
Voters. 
I am honored to carry this legislation 
that recognizes and honors the suffra-
gists’ tireless efforts and the ripples of 
hope and civic progress they have elic-
ited for generations. 
Madam Speaker, I urge your support 
for this commonsense tribute to our 
Nation’s history, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This coming August 18 will mark the 
100th anniversary of the ratification of 
the 19th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion, which, after a century of earnest 
protest, extended the right to vote to 
all women. 
Forty years before that, suffragette 
Elizabeth 
Cady 
Stanton 
wrote 
admiringly to Lucretia Mott. She was 
born in 1793 during President Washing-
ton’s administration. At the time that 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote to her, 
she was in her 88th and final year of 
life. Mott was a Quaker, a major voice 
in the abolitionist movement, and later 
in the suffragette movement. Reflect-
ing on her leadership in these just 
causes and the effect that it had on the 
entire Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
said: 
One who has lived 88 years, reflecting ever 
the sober virtues of the true wife and moth-
er, the earnest reformer, the religious teach-
er, both in the schoolroom and Friends Meet-
ing, must have exerted a strong influence for 
good on our young, impressionable Nation. 
When we remember that every word we 
utter, every act we perform, in all our wak-
ing hours, the very atmosphere, the com-
bination all our faculties creates have their 
constant effect, on everyone who comes 
within the circle of our individual influence, 
and through them are wafted by word, by let-
ter and by thought, to innumerable other 
circles beyond, when we try to estimate all 
this, we can in a measure appreciate the ele-
vating influence on a nation of just one 
grand life. 
The Every Word We Utter Monument 
takes those words as a testament to 
the patient influence of so many who 
finally 
won 
adoption 
of 
the 
19th 
Amendment, and with it, the fulfill-
ment of American democracy. Those 
early suffragettes, like Mott and Stan-
ton, never lived to see the culmination 
of their life’s work, but the Every Word 
We Utter Monument will ensure that 
their example and achievement is me-
morialized in Washington, D.C., as are 
all of the great men and women and all 
of the great deeds that built this coun-
try, as Lincoln said, into the last best 
hope of mankind on this Earth. 
This memorial, which will be built 
without use of Federal funds, will serve 
as a lasting tribute to the brave and in-
telligent women who fought to secure 
voting rights for all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleague from Cali-
fornia for his remarks, and I couldn’t 
agree with him more. I appreciate his 
support of this important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further re-
quests for time, I am prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIP-
TON). 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, last 
year marked the 100th anniversary of 
the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment. While I wish the House would 
have passed this bill last year to honor 
the centennial anniversary of the suf-
fragettes’ decades-long fight to win the 
right to vote, I am glad we are debat-
ing this bill now. 
The Every Word We Utter Monument 
will serve as a continual reminder of 
the courage shown by women engaged 
in the suffrage movement, and we must 
all work to do what we can for the fu-
ture to be able to ensure quality and 
inclusion. 
I appreciate the opportunity to have 
worked with my colleagues from Colo-
rado on this bill and especially my col-
league from the Second District, Mr. 
NEGUSE. I have stood across from him a 
few times on this floor, and it is nice to 
be in agreement on a public lands bill 
that we are able to work together on 
now. It is a bill that will help us bring 
to 
light 
Loveland 
sculptor, 
Jane 
DeDecker’s, work to Washington. I 
think it is an adequate effort to be able 
to help recognize the suffrage move-
ment and the contribution of women to 
our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I want to thank my colleague and 
neighbor from the Third District for 
his very kind remarks and for his sup-
port of this bill, and my fellow Mem-
bers of the Colorado delegation for 
their unanimous support of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I must take a mo-
ment to thank the advocates who have 
worked on this legislation for many 
years, Jane DeDecker, who is a con-
stituent of mine in the wonderful com-
munity of Loveland, Colorado, who 
conceptualized the statue for which our 
bill is named; and the president of the 
Every Word We Utter board, Jody 
Shadduck-McNally, who also worked 
tirelessly. Both of these women have 
worked very hard to ensure that this 
piece of women’s history and the long 
legacy of women’s civic engagement 
that followed is commemorated effec-
tively and can stand as an inspiration 
for generations to come. 
I would close just on a personal note. 
As the Speaker knows, my daughter, 
Natalie, is just a year and a half old 
now. As she grows up, I want her to feel 
represented, empowered, and assured of 
the fundamental role that she plays in

Nation’s Capitol, she will hopefully be 
able to visit this statue and learn of 
the great struggle to ensure her equal-
ity and be assured America’s sons and 
daughters stand on equal footing at the 
doors of opportunity. 
In reverence to the brave women who 
fought for equality in the past, and on 
behalf of all of those who will follow, I 
thank my fellow Members for their 
consideration in support of this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 473, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CHIEF STANDING BEAR NATIONAL 
HISTORIC 
TRAIL 
FEASIBILITY 
STUDY 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2490) to amend the National 
Trails System Act to direct the Sec-
retary of the Interior to conduct a 
study on the feasibility of designating 
the Chief Standing Bear National His-
toric Trail, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2490 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. CHIEF STANDING BEAR NATIONAL 
HISTORIC 
TRAIL 
FEASIBILITY 
STUDY. 
Section 5(c) of the National Trails System Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1244(c)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(xx) CHIEF
STANDING
BEAR
NATIONAL
HIS-
TORIC TRAIL.—The Chief Standing Bear Trail, 
extending 
approximately 
550 
miles 
from 
Niobrara, Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, 
which follows the route taken by Chief Standing 
Bear and the Ponca people during Federal In-
dian removal, and approximately 550 miles from 
Ponca City, Oklahoma, through Omaha, Ne-
braska, to Niobrara, Nebraska, which follows 
the return route taken by Chief Standing Bear 
and the Ponca people.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2490, intro-
duced by Representative FORTENBERRY 
of Nebraska, would direct the Sec-
retary of the Interior to study the fea-
sibility of designating the Chief Stand-
ing Bear National Historic Trail. 
The proposed trail would extend ap-
proximately 550 miles from Niobrara, 
Nebraska, to Ponca City, Oklahoma, 
tracing the route taken by Chief 
Standing Bear during Federal Indian 
removal and their return to Nebraska. 
The trail would commemorate and 
elevate the story of Chief Standing 
Bear, and the trail would memorialize 
the honor, the courage, and the for-
titude of Chief Standing Bear and the 
Ponca people as they struggled to re-
turn to their homeland. It would serve 
as a reminder of their fight to achieve 
justice, freedom, and equality. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive FORTENBERRY
for championing 
this important legislation and for his 
efforts to bring about a greater under-
standing of Tribal sovereignty and 
rights. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The statue of Chief Standing Bear 
can be found in this Capitol, honored 
by the State of Nebraska as one of its 
favorite sons. 
Chief Standing Bear led the Ponca 
Tribe through the crisis that began 
with its displacement by a flood of 
westward-bound settlers encouraged by 
the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Tribe 
was pressured to abandon its most pro-
ductive lands and, essentially, made 
wanderers by a series of broken prom-
ises by the United States Government. 
When they sought refuge on the Omaha 
Reservation, Chief Standing Bear and 
his surviving tribesmen were arrested 
and detained at Fort Omaha, with no 
legal recourse. 
The legal case that followed estab-
lished, in 1879, the legal principle that 
American Indians were indeed Amer-
ican citizens protected under the Con-
stitution and accorded all the due proc-
ess rights enshrined in it. During that 
case, the words of Chief Standing Bear, 
pleading on behalf of his Tribe, moved 
the entire Nation and endure to this 
day. 
H.R. 2490, authored by Congressman 
FORTENBERRY, directs the Secretary of 
the Interior to study the feasibility of 
designating the Chief Standing Bear 
National Historic Trail. The Chief 
Standing Bear Trail, extending ap-
proximately 550 miles from Nebraska 
to Oklahoma, follows the route taken 
by Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca 
people during their forced removal. 
If supported by this study, any des-
ignation of the trail would require ad-
ditional action from the Committee on 
Natural Resources and the Congress. 
This legislation passed the House in 
the 114th Congress. It is long overdue 
to become law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY), the 
author of the measure. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, first of all, let me thank Chairman 
NEGUSE for his profound words, gen-
erous words, kind words, and com-
mitted support to this bill. I also thank 
Ranking Member MCCLINTOCK for his 
review of this impactful history of our 
Nation. 
This is the reason that Nebraska 
chose to honor Chief Standing Bear and 
to share his legacy with the entire 
United States with a statue recently 
placed in Statuary Hall. 
In fact, Madam Speaker, I was walk-
ing through there recently, and I 
stopped for a moment and paused. I 
watched the young children gather 
around the Chief Standing Bear statue 
because it is so impressive and so dig-
nified, and the words that are below it 
are so impactful: ‘‘I am a man.’’ 
You see, as Ranking Member MCCLIN-
TOCK traced some of this history, in 
1877, the Ponca people were forced off 
their land in Niobrara, Nebraska, forc-
ibly relocated in a harsh march down 
to Oklahoma—Indian territory, as it 
was called at the time. 
Chief Standing Bear’s little child, his 
daughter, died along the way. His son 
later became ill, perhaps because of the 
trauma of the journey. But he prom-
ised his son that he would bury him in 
their native homeland, and that is 
what led to this tale. 
That really is what led us here today, 
Chief Standing Bear honoring a prom-
ise to his son. With other members of 
the Tribe, in the winter of 1878, they 
started northward back to Nebraska in 
the harshest of weather conditions. He 
was arrested for leaving the reserva-
tion. The predecessor to today’s paper 
in Nebraska, the Omaha World-Herald, 
picked up on the story. It became a fa-
mous court case that was followed 
throughout America. 
At the end of the trial, Chief Stand-
ing Bear simply raised his hand and 
said this: 
That hand is not the color of yours, 
but if I pierce it, I shall feel pain. If 
you pierce your hand, you also feel 
pain. The blood that will flow from 
mine will be the same color as yours. I 
am a man. God made us both. 
With that profound statement, the 
court was so moved that the judge 
ruled, as Ranking Member MCCLINTOCK 
said, that Native Americans for the 
first time—this was 1879—would be de-
clared persons for purposes under the 
law. 
It is an amazing, traumatic, difficult, 
but poignant civil rights story. 
Today, what we are doing is poten-
tially talking about the establishment

and his great contribution to the idea

tant step toward establishing this

GOLD STAR MOTHERS FAMILIES 
NATIONAL 
MONUMENT 
EXTEN-
SION ACT 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2819) to extend the authority 
for the establishment of a commemora-
tive work in honor of Gold Star Fami-
lies, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2819 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gold Star 
Mothers Families National Monument Ex-
tension Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTAB-
LISHMENT 
OF 
COMMEMORATIVE 
WORK. 
Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, 
United States Code, the authority provided 
by section 2859 of the Military Construction 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (divi-
sion B of Public Law 112–239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 
U.S.C. 8903 note) shall continue to apply 
through January 2, 2024. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2819, intro-
duced by Representative KIM, would ex-
tend the authorization for the estab-
lishment of the commemorative work 
to Gold Star Families until 2024. 
I thank my freshman colleague, Rep-
resentative KIM, for bringing forward 
this critically important bill and for 
his leadership in the Committee on 
Armed Services and the Committee on 
Small Business. 
The Gold Star Families National 
Monument would honor the families of 
those who have made the ultimate sac-
rifices for our country. This commemo-
rative work was initially authorized in 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2013, but the au-
thorization expired in January 2020. 
Madam Speaker, the Gold Star is a 
widely recognized tradition that dates 
back to World War I, when families dis-
played service flags bearing a blue star 
for each family member serving in 
combat. If a relative was lost in com-
bat, the star’s color would be changed 
to gold. 
In November 2015, the Commission of 
Fine Arts approved a location for the 
memorial on National Park Service 
property immediately west of the Ar-
lington National Cemetery visitor cen-
ter. Since then, the National Capital 
Memorial Advisory Commission has 
consulted with the Gold Star Mothers 
National Monument Foundation on de-
sign concepts for the memorial. 
While we can never repay the debt 
that we owe our Nation’s Gold Star 
families, extending the authorization 
for this memorial helps take a step to-
ward fully honoring the sacrifices they 
have made, which is why this bill is so 
important and why I would like to, 
again, thank Representative KIM for 
his leadership in introducing it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
H.R. 2819 would extend the authoriza-
tion of the Gold Star Mothers National 
Monument Foundation so that it can 
construct the Gold Star Mothers Na-
tional Monument. 
The Gold Star Mothers of our Nation 
have sacrificed more on the altar of 
liberty than any among us. They have 
lost their children so that our children 
can be safe and sound and free. 
No words can begin to express the 
debt that we owe to them. While other 
families are celebrating Memorial Day 
with barbecues and frivolities, Gold 
Star families are gathered around the 
hallowed graves of their loved ones. 
The monument contemplated by this 
legislation is a small recognition of 
this. We do as much as we can to honor 
those who fall in defense of our country 
and its Constitution, and well we 
should. But we don’t do nearly enough 
to honor those who they leave behind. 
Our fallen heroes come from our 
communities, from our high schools 
and churches, but most importantly, 
they come from the homes of loving 
families. When we as a nation lose a 
soldier and a patriot, these mothers 
lose a child. We must remember that 
for the families of these fallen heroes, 
every day is Memorial Day. 
Time, 
sadly, 
does 
not 
heal 
all 
wounds. The grief of our Gold Star 
Mothers is just as great today as the 
day when the casualty officer came to 
their door. Their loss is a heavy burden 
that they carry with them every single 
day of their lives. Nonetheless, they 
persevere to keep alive the spirit of 
their brave children. 
Legislation signed into law during 
the 112th Congress authorized the Gold 
Star 
Mothers 
National 
Monument 
Foundation to erect a monument on 
Federal lands in our Capital City that 
would honor mothers whose children 
gave that last full measure of devotion 
defending the United States as part of 
our armed services. The extended au-
thorization will allow more time for 
the foundation to ensure that the 
monument’s construction and comple-
tion can be brought to fruition by 2027. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the distinguished gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Colorado, my 
friend, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the sacrifices of America’s Gold 
Star Mothers and families and to fur-
ther the cause of building a monument 
to acknowledge their contributions to 
our country. 
One of these Gold Star Mothers is Ju-
dith Young, a neighbor of mine down 
the street in Morristown, New Jersey. 
In October 1983, Judith lost her son, 
Jeffrey, in the bombing of the Marine 
barracks in Beirut. 
b 1330 
Judith said that Jeffrey always want-
ed to be a soldier. He graduated from 
high school in 1980 and went right into 
the Marines. He was proud to be a Ma-
rine. He was proud to serve his coun-
try.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1208 
February 26, 2020 
In the more than three decades since 
his death, Judith has been a fierce ad-
vocate for her fellow Gold Star Moth-
ers and Families. She represents thou-
sands of loved ones and family mem-
bers who have sacrificed so much for 
the freedoms we enjoy today. 
It is that sacrifice that we seek to 
honor in the Gold Star Families Na-
tional Monument Extension Act. By 
passing this bill, we can give Gold Star 
Families, like Judith’s, the time they 
need to complete a monument ac-
knowledging that sacrifices aren’t just 
made by those in uniform, but by the 
loved ones left behind. 
This is a monument that has a site 
selected; that won’t cost taxpayers a 
single dime; and that has truly bipar-
tisan support. If we don’t pass this bill, 
the authorization for this monument 
will expire. 
Our Gold Star Families have already 
been through so much. They have al-
ready endured and sacrificed beyond 
what so many of us here can under-
stand; the least we can do is support 
them by giving them the time to re-
member and honor those lost. 
The futility in finding the words and 
actions to thank loved ones like Judith 
isn’t new. In a letter to Lydia Bixby of 
Massachusetts in 1864, President Lin-
coln wrote: ‘‘I feel how weak and fruit-
less must be any words of mine which 
should attempt to beguile you from the 
grief of a loss so overwhelming.’’ 
Lincoln understood that there is 
nothing we can ever do to truly repay 
patriots like Judith. But he continued: 
‘‘But I cannot refrain from tendering 
to you the consolation that may be 
found in the thanks of the Republic 
they died to save.’’ 
Let us show the thanks of the Repub-
lic that so many brave men and women 
have given all to save. Let us show the 
thanks of the Republic that so many 
Gold Star Families have given so much 
to keep free. We can do that by passing 
this bipartisan bill and allowing the 
completion of this monument. 
I hope you will support me, my co- 
lead, Congressman RATCLIFFE, and the 
Gold Star Mothers and Families across 
the country in this effort. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
RATCLIFFE). 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman NEGUSE and Ranking 
Member MCCLINTOCK for their leader-
ship on this committee. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2819, the Gold Star Fami-
lies 
National 
Monument 
Extension 
Act. 
I was very pleased to have the oppor-
tunity to introduce this bipartisan bill, 
along with my Democratic colleague, 
the gentleman from New Jersey, Con-
gressman KIM, on behalf of our Na-
tion’s Gold Star Families. 
The term ‘‘Gold Star Family’’ dates 
back to World War I, when flags were 
displayed bearing a blue star to rep-
resent a family member serving abroad 
and gold stars used to designate family 
members who had been lost in combat. 
As the Representative of a congres-
sional district in northeast Texas with 
more than 50,000 veterans, and thou-
sands and thousands of active duty 
servicemembers, this bill very much 
hits home. 
My home State of Texas is home to 1 
of every 10 U.S. servicemembers, and 
nearly 25,000 Texas families have joined 
the National Gold Star Family Reg-
istry since World War II. 
The families of all the individuals 
who serve our country know the great 
sacrifices that are made when a loved 
one answers the call of duty because, 
unfortunately, all of our heroes don’t 
always make it back home; and it is 
their families who will forever bear the 
burden of that ultimate sacrifice when 
they don’t return home. 
As a grateful Nation, it must be our 
constant priority to honor our fallen 
heroes and their families. After all, we 
owe our freedom to their great sac-
rifice. 
I am confident that the Gold Star 
Families National Monument will help 
ensure that we honor our fallen heroes 
and their families on a national scale 
by extending the authorization for the 
establishment of a national monument 
located right in here in Washington, 
D.C. 
The Gold Star Family Monument 
will be constructed at no cost to tax-
payers, as all of the funds that are 
being raised are being raised by the 
Gold Star Mothers National Monument 
Foundation. 
I am grateful for the opportunity 
that the Gold Star Family Monument 
will provide to all of our citizens to 
pause and honor the ultimate sacrifices 
made by our fallen servicemen and 
servicewomen on our behalf as they 
visit our Nation’s capital. 
Despite the often polarized political 
climate in Washington, this is an issue 
that people across the political spec-
trum should all be able to stand be-
hind. 
Again, I thank my Democratic col-
league, Congressman KIM, for his lead-
ership on this important effort, and I 
urge the rest of our colleagues for their 
strong support on the floor today. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation. I thank Rep-
resentative KIM
and Representative 
RATCLIFFE

ward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2819, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, on

February 26, 2020 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 3399, the Nu-
tria Eradication and Control Act of 
2003. 
In case you were not lucky enough to 
see the stuffed nutria that the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
brought to our hearing in the Natural 
Resources Committee, you are in luck, 
because I understand that it is making 
another appearance here today on the 
floor. 
You can see firsthand that nutria are 
a large, invasive rodent species that 
have infested and damaged wetlands 
across the United States. 
This species was originally intro-
duced to the United States in 1899 for 
fur production, but its rapid breeding 
and destructive burrowing became a 
huge problem in areas like the Gulf of 
Mexico and the Chesapeake Bay. 
In 2003, by way of background, Con-
gress passed the Nutria Eradication 
and Control Act to provide assistance 
to Maryland and Louisiana to eradi-
cate or control nutria and to restore 
wetlands destroyed by nutria. Accord-
ing to some estimates, if these meas-
ures had not been adopted, nutria could 
have destroyed 17 percent of the Chesa-
peake Bay’s marshes in a 50-year pe-
riod. 
While this program has been success-
ful in Maryland and Louisiana, now the 
nutria have invaded habitats across the 
United States. 
Representative HARDER’s much-need-
ed bill would expand the Nutria Eradi-
cation and Control Act of 2003 to in-
clude any State with a nutria infesta-
tion issue and make them eligible for 
funding under the act. 
It is important to consider this bill 
in the context of the state of our wild-
life and habitat today. Species are 
going extinct at a faster rate than ever 
before in human history. Habitat loss 
is a major driver of the extinction cri-
sis that we are experiencing, and so 
protecting and restoring wetlands from 
invasive species like nutria is an im-
portant piece of the puzzle for pro-
tecting biodiversity in our country. 
In the face of the climate crisis, we 
must do all we can to protect habitat 
and wildlife, and eradicating this de-
structive invasive species is a step in 
the right direction. 
I thank my distinguished colleague 
from California for his leadership in in-
troducing this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
It is easy to joke about the nutria, 
more commonly called a ‘‘swamp rat,’’ 
but their proliferation in regions like 
California is a growing threat to water 
infrastructure throughout the State. 
Louisiana has suffered this invasive 
species since the 1930s; the Chesapeake 
since the 1940s. They are now prolifer-
ating in California, where they destroy 
irrigation systems, undermine dams 
and levees, erode riverbanks, displace 
native wildlife, and lay waste to aquat-
ic vegetation. 
This legislation amends the Nutria 
Eradication and Control Act of 2003 and 
reauthorizes funding for the program 
until fiscal year 2025. Currently, Mary-
land and Louisiana are the only States 
eligible for funding, yet the problem is 
national. According to estimates, there 
could be nearly a quarter million of 
these destructive creatures in Cali-
fornia within 5 years if we don’t take 
action now. 
California has enough problems of its 
own making to deal with. It requires 
the same assistance as provided to 
other parts of the country to control 
this invasive infestation, and this bill 
broadens the eligibility nationwide to 
do so. 
During committee consideration, this 
measure was amended to more closely 
resemble the language included in my 
legislation, H.R. 5217, the Water Opti-
mization for the West Act, which 
makes this a national program rather 
than an earmark. 
I urge adoption of the measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. HARD-
ER) and his nutria, whose name is Nel-
lie. 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam 
Speaker, people see swamp rats all the 
time roaming the halls of D.C., but I 
believe this is actually the first time in 
American history that we have a 
taxidermied swamp creature on the ac-
tual floor of the House of Representa-
tives. 
This here is my good friend, Nellie 
the Nutria. She has nacho-cheese col-
ored teeth, can weigh up to 40 pounds, 
she can eat 25 percent of her body 
weight every single day, and she has an 
exponential rate of growth. 
She may look cute to some people, 
but Nellie and her friends are a real 
menace, and farmers across Califor-
nia’s Central Valley and residents of 
the Louisiana swamp can tell you, too, 
how serious of a threat these giant 
swamp rats pose. 
Nutria can destroy crops, irrigation 
canals, wetlands and native species. 
And their exponential growth rate 
makes them a real problem. One fe-
male, like Nellie here, can lead to 200 
offspring in a single year. The State of 
California estimates that if we don’t do 
something about this problem, there 
are going to be 250,000 nutria in our 
State within the next 5 years. 
Nellie’s family in Louisiana have al-
ready caused an immense amount of 
damage over the last 100 years. And my 
Republican colleagues on this bill, Mr. 
GRAVES and Mr. MCCLINTOCK, can at-
test to the real havoc these swamp rats 
cause. 
My bill would simply revive a pro-
gram that the State of Maryland used 
to almost entirely eliminate the infes-
tation in the Chesapeake Bay, where 
Nellie here came from originally. That 
program uses a variety of strategies to 
control and eradicate this invasive spe-
cies. It ended up saving a lot of money 
in the long run, and my bill is going to 
bring back that proven program and 
make more States eligible for help. 
This is a tiny investment compared 
to what will be necessary if we wait 
any longer. 
I want to thank all my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle who joined 
me on this bill and ask for support in 
stopping this invasion. 
There is a lot of bickering that goes 
on in this Chamber, but I am proud 
that this is something Mr. GRAVES, Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK, and myself could find 
something that unites us, which is 
draining the swamp, not just in Wash-
ington, but also in California and Lou-
isiana, and the rest of the country. 
b 1345 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES). 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I look at the nutria, and I 
have to disagree with my friend from 
California. I feel like I see swamp rats 
on the floor all the time. But I do ap-
preciate him bringing the actual spe-
cies here to help folks understand what 
it is that we deal with. 
Madam Speaker, I have come on this 
House floor many times to describe the 
coastal challenges that we have in Lou-
isiana. We have lost 2,800 square miles 
of our coast. And I remind my col-
leagues that if the State of Rhode Is-
land lost 2,800 square miles of their 
coast, we would have 49 States today. 
Nutria is part of the problem. It is an 
invasive species. The population in my 
home State is nearly 4.5 million people, 
yet we have an estimated 20 million 
nutria. It is an extraordinary figure. 
If we could count them in the Census, 
we would have an additional 27 Mem-
bers of Congress. We are having infes-
tation without representation, and we 
need to do something about it. 
In Louisiana, we have a thing where 
if you can’t beat it, you eat it. So, we 
have even tried. We have tried to do 
nutria fajitas. We have tried to fry it. 
We have tried everything. It is not my 
favorite, Madam Speaker, but this 
really is a huge problem. 
Very seriously, we have 20 million 
nutria, and they cause the destruction 
and damage of tens of thousands of 
acres of our coastal wetlands every sin-
gle year. 
As my friends Mr. MCCLINTOCK and 
Mr. HARDER from California brought 
up, it is things like levees, productive

estuaries, irrigation canals, and other 
things that have devastating con-
sequences. 
This legislation does take some of 
the lessons learned from the programs 
in Maryland and Louisiana and ex-
pands upon the flexibility of dollars to 
actually not just work on eradication 
efforts but also do some restoration 
work. 
I thank the subcommittee chairman, 
Mr. NEGUSE, my friend from Colorado; 
Mr. HARDER; as well as the ranking 
member, Mr. MCCLINTOCK, for their 
work on this. This is a bipartisan bill. 
It is based upon and enacts improve-
ments that we have seen as a result of 
this program being carried out in Lou-
isiana and Maryland. 
I am looking forward to this going 
over to the Senate, and I strongly urge 
adoption of this important bill to help 
get this invasive species under control 
to help protect our communities. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
after the gentleman’s description, I am 
going to resist the temptation to com-
ment on the unique culinary traditions 
of my friends in Louisiana. 
In California, we don’t want to eat 
them. We just want to get rid of them. 
That is what this bill is all about. 
I urge its adoption, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I very 
much enjoyed this fascinating debate, 
and I appreciate the leadership of our 
colleague from Louisiana on this issue 
for many years and, of course, our col-
league from California for initiating 
the bill before the House. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by

Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1492) to update the map of, 
and modify the maximum acreage 
available for inclusion in, the Yucca 
House National Monument, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1492 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1492, sponsored by my 
friend and fellow Coloradan, Represent-
ative TIPTON. This bill would support 
access to one of the most significant 
cultural and archaeological sites in 
southwest Colorado, the Yucca House 
National Monument. 
Yucca House was an important com-
munity 
center 
for 
the 
ancestral 
Puebloan people and serves as an en-
during example of the history of these 
lands. H.R. 1492 would add 160 acres of 
donated land to the monument, quin-
tupling the size of the site and guaran-
teeing permanent public access. 
The addition would also allow the 
National Park Service to build a new 
public entrance to the monument, in-
cluding parking, visitor services, and 
interpretive facilities. This new access 
will allow more Americans to utilize 
and learn about the exceptional ances-
tral Puebloan sites protected at the 
monument. 
I congratulate my colleague on his 
efforts to support access with respect 
to this monument and to help enhance 
our appreciation for the Native Amer-
ican history enshrined in the kivas, 
towers, and plazas of the Yucca House 
National Monument. 
As a fellow lover of Colorado’s public 
lands and public land heritage, I again 
thank the gentleman for his leadership 
on this bill and certainly urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
the Yucca House National Monument 
is a classic example of how the Antiq-
uities Act is supposed to work. 
President 
Woodrow 
Wilson 
des-
ignated 9.6 acres as a national monu-
ment—I didn’t say 9.6 million acres; I 
said 9.6 acres—in order to protect an 
ancient 
American 
Indian 
archae-
ological site, the ruins of a sprawling 
600-room pueblo. 
That is the real purpose of the Antiq-
uities Act. That is the way it is sup-
posed to be used. It is there to protect 
small archaeological sites for study 
and preservation. It is not there to set 
aside hundreds of square miles of land 
just because we can. 
The site was donated to the United 
States Government by the landowner 
and 
subsequent 
owners 
who 
made 
available a small amount of additional 
acreage as artifacts have been discov-
ered. 
H.R. 1492, by Congressman TIPTON of 
Colorado, would make a further bound-
ary adjustment of about 160 acres of 
donated land adjacent to the monu-
ment that encompasses additional sites 
and provides for better public access. 
Unlike many recent national monu-
ment designations, this one has the 
strong support of the local commu-
nities affected and is focused on pre-
serving 
actual 
archaeological 
sites 
from antiquity. 
This bill should serve as an example 
for how monument designations or ad-
justments should be made, always with 
local collaboration and support. I ap-
plaud my friend for his diligent work 
on this legislation. I urge its adoption, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIP-
TON), the author of this measure. 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank both my colleagues for their 
kind words on this legislation. 
Madam Chair, the Yucca House Na-
tional Monument is in Montezuma 
County, Colorado, very near to my 
hometown of Cortez. It is one of the 
largest archaeological sites in south-
west Colorado, preserving a Monte-
zuma Valley ancestral Puebloan site 
that is unexcavated. 
If you were to look at it quickly, you 
might see just several mounds of rocks, 
but it contains some valuable informa-
tion that answers questions that we 
have about large, active farming com-
munities that existed in the area cen-
turies ago. 
In 2019, Yucca House National Monu-
ment celebrated its 100th birthday. 
Yucca House National Monument is 
surrounded by private land, and access 
is granted through an easement on pri-
vate property. The owner of that prop-
erty has experienced trouble with traf-
fic and parking, and the arrangement

is interfering with his ability to be able 
to manage the farm. 
A private landowner adjacent to the 
national monument is now seeking to 
be able to donate 160 acres to the 
monument to further protect archae-
ological sites and cultural resources 
and to alleviate access issues. 
The land has been studied and deter-
mined to be appropriate for inclusion 
in the national monument. The dona-
tion would facilitate a new access road 
to the monument and parking for visi-
tors. 
It is important to note that the Mon-
tezuma County Commission has ap-
proved the road and parking plan and 
waived a ‘‘no net loss’’ of private land 
policy to officially support the 160-acre 
donation. In doing this, the county has 
asked that my office work to be able to 
release five wilderness study areas 
within Montezuma and Dolores Coun-
ties, areas that pose problems for the 
counties when it comes to protecting 
nearby 
communities 
from 
wildfire 
threats, balancing recreation needs, 
and managing noxious weeds. I have al-
ready started working to release these 
WSAs, and I am committed to being 
able to see the process through. 
Currently, the National Park Service 
has minor boundary revision authority, 
as long as the sum total of the acreage 
added to the unit is less than 200 acres 
and the lands are adjacent to other 
Federal lands administered by the Na-
tional Park Service. 
Although this proposed donation is 
less than 200 acres, the donation would 
increase the acreage within the monu-
ment about six times over. Therefore, 
Congress must authorize a boundary 
revision before the donation can be ac-
cepted. 
The Yucca House National Monu-
ment is one of the most significant ar-
chaeological sites in the country and 
stands as a reminder of how the an-
cient Puebloans used to live hundreds 
of years ago. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill so that future generations can con-
tinue to be able to experience the cul-
tural and archaeological significance of 
the monument. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
NEGUSE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, I thank my colleague, friend, 
and neighbor, Mr. TIPTON, for his lead-
ership on this bill. I certainly urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
I also want to make sure we take a 
moment to take stock and reflect on 
the benefits of the Antiquities Act of 
1906, that bedrock law signed into law 
by President Teddy Roosevelt so long 
ago that has enabled us to move for-
ward with protecting monuments like 
the one included in the bill that is be-
fore the House today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.

HONORING JOYCE WATTERMAN 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a truly great person in 
my district, Council President Joyce 
Watterman, who was honored in my 
celebration of Black History Month. 
Ms. Watterman is the first African 
American woman to be elected council 
president for Jersey City. Right now, 
she is working to improve disabled 
parking, increase affordable housing, 
provide a safe environment for our 
children, and empower prisoners to bet-
ter their lives. 
In addition, she has one of the 
strongest commitments to promoting 
diversity and inclusion throughout the 
district. She is an active member of the 
local NAACP and co-chair of the Diver-
sity and Inclusion Advisory Board. 
This is not my only tribute for Ms. 
Watterman. I honored her during a spe-
cial Black History Month celebration 
on February 21. She is a tremendous 
asset to my district and deserves all 
these accolades and more. She is a 
truly great public servant through her 
ministry in church and her public of-
fice.

HONORING SECOND CLASS PETTY 
OFFICER MARILYN CHILDRESS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Second Class Petty 
Officer Marilyn Childress, a woman 
who served during the Vietnam war. 
Marilyn Childress enlisted in the 
Navy in 1972. Since women were not al-
lowed in combat areas at the time, she 
was attached to the dispensary at 
Naval Air Station Glynco, Georgia, and 
then at the then-Naval Air Station 
Millington, Tennessee, as an operating 
room technician corpswoman. 
After completing her service to her 
country in 1975, Marilyn enrolled at the 
University of Tennessee and earned her 
master’s degree. She settled in Georgia 
upon the completion of her degree, 
where she became the first female 
president of the Georgia Amateur 
Women’s Soccer Association. Perhaps 
her greatest accomplishment was her 
work in getting women’s soccer recog-
nized as an Olympic sport in 1996. 
When she returned to Knoxville in 
2013, she helped establish the Veterans 
Heritage Site Foundation, which cre-
ated the Sharp’s Ridge Veterans Memo-
rial Park in Knoxville, Tennessee, my 
hometown. 
Our country’s heroes are the men and 
women of our Armed Forces like 
Marilyn Childress who served in sac-
rifice for our freedom. 
It is my honor to recognize Second 
Class Petty Officer Marilyn Childress

ANTILYNCHING LEGISLATION 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to support further the bill today 
on the floor of the House, H.R. 35, the 
Emmett Till Antilynching Act, and I 
thank my colleague from Illinois for 
his astuteness. 
Lynching was the most heinous act 
of intimidation and violence against 
slaves and those who came after in the 
1800s and the early 1900s. 
Ida B. Wells, a renowned educator 
and investigative journalist, fought 
from 1886 to 1931 for the passage of 
antilynching legislation, the Emmett 
Till bill, which recounts the violence 
that a 14-year-old boy experienced 
until his death when he simply walked 
on a street and may have looked at a 
White woman. 
This is an important standard and 
statement that also hopes to bring 
about the debate and passage of H.R. 40 
on the floor of the House, which is the 
Commission to Study and Develop Rep-
aration Proposals for African-Ameri-
cans Act. 
Let me also acknowledge H.R. 2819, 
to extend the authority for the estab-
lishment of a commemorative work in 
honor of Gold Star Families, and for 
other purposes. I am a strong supporter 
of those families who, obviously, lost 
their loved ones. 
I want to finally say that this admin-
istration did not tell the truth on the 
coronavirus. It is absolutely impera-
tive that they address the American 
people and address the next steps for 
protecting the American people, as I 
have done.

NATIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEEK 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
this week is National Public Schools 
Week. This is a week where we recog-
nize all the schools, all the educators, 
all the students, and every educational 
professional’s hard work that goes into 
a student’s success. 
The strength of our Nation’s public 
schools is a direct reflection of the 
strength of our Nation and a direct re-
flection on the strength of the future. 
I stand here in solidarity to recognize 
the great work these professionals 
commit themselves to. Educators and 
educational 
professionals 
dedicate 
their lives to all students, regardless of 
where they come from, and help them 
achieve in every single aspect of their 
lives. 
I am also proud to be a cosponsor of 
H. Res. 862, designating this week as 
National Public Schools Week. 
I thank all of the educators, edu-
cational professionals, and students 
whom those professionals will be shap-
ing into the next generation of this 
great generation of America. May God 
bless them all.

REVERE COPPER DOCK COLLAPSE 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to how cor-
porate 
greed 
threatens 
our 
public 
health and environment with an alarm-
ing example from my hometown of De-
troit. 
On November 26, 2019, a portion of a 
dock operated by Detroit Bulk Storage 
collapsed into the Detroit River send-
ing tons of crushed limestone into the 
river, disturbing contaminated river 
sediment and exposing the public and 
our water supply to the decades of con-
tamination buried at this former ura-
nium rod manufacturing site. 
Detroit Bulk Storage took unneces-
sary risks by overloading its failing 
dock, caused a collapse into the river, 
and waited 3 days before notifying the 
National Response Center. When they 
did, they merely reported it as a dock 
collapse with no indication for State or 
Federal regulators of the contamina-
tion present at the site and the need 
for urgency. 
Testing from State regulators and 
the EPA is ongoing, and so far tests ap-
pear to indicate no significant radi-
ation exposure. However, the site’s 
owner, Revere Dock, LLC, continues to 
drag its feet in developing and imple-
menting a restoration plan. 
This is yet another stark reminder 
that we cannot ever count on corpora-
tions to put the public interest ahead 
of their own profits and that we need 
drastic changes to strengthen regu-
latory tools and to hold them account-
able to protect our public health.

CONGRATULATING MIRANDA HAR-
WOOD, HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY’S 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to congratulate Mrs. Miranda Har-
wood on becoming Hillsborough Coun-
ty’s Teacher of the Year. Mrs. Harwood 
is a fourth-grade math teacher at 
Brooker Elementary School in Bran-
don, Florida. 
Mrs. Harwood embodies everything 
that educators should be—a kind heart, 
dedication to her profession, and a 
commitment to her pupils. On Monday 
she hosts a math club for her excelling 
students, 
and 
on 
Wednesdays 
and 
Thursdays she stays late for those 
needing additional help and encourage-
ment. 
Not only does she create a learning 
environment conducive to academic 
achievement, but she also strives to 
promote safety and security for those 
with difficult home lives. She really, 
truly cares. A former student described 
the impact that she left on him and his 
classmates as ‘‘making every student 
feel like they are her own child.’’ Wow. 
Praise like this is both commendable 
and rare. 
As Mrs. Harwood moves forward to 
the State competition for Teacher of 
the Year, I wish her the best of luck. 
More importantly, I am honored to 
have her passion and dedication in my 
district and to have her instill these 
characteristics into our next genera-
tion.

CENTRAL VIRGINIAN OF THE 
WEEK: HENRY MACK 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Henry Mack, a 
blue water Navy veteran and our Cen-
tral Virginian of the Week. 
Mr. Mack served in the U.S. Navy 
and completed five combat tours in 
Vietnam. 
After attending Virginia Union Uni-
versity and settling in Chesterfield 
County, he witnessed the difficulties 
facing fellow veterans as they returned 
home. Unemployment and homeless-
ness were prevalent, and former serv-
icemembers faced extreme delays when 
trying to access their earned pensions 
and benefits. 
He decided to take action, and in 1998 
Mr. Mack founded the nonprofit Vet-
erans Helping Veterans Now. By inter-
vening early and walking alongside 
veterans through each step of an often 
tedious process, Mr. Mack’s organiza-
tion helps our neighbors gain employ-
ment, secure their benefits, and over-
come challenges like PTSD and addic-
tion. 
Today, Veterans Helping Veterans 
Now has assisted more than 4,000 Amer-
icans in Virginia and across the coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Mack 
for his selfless service both in uniform 
and as an advocate for his fellow vet-
erans.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF DR. 
WESLEY BALL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Dr. Wesley Ball who passed away 
on January 8 at the age of 88. 
Originally from Moultrie, Georgia, 
Dr. Ball came to Savannah in 1964 
where he practiced surgery for over 33 
years. Not only an exceptional surgeon, 
his work transcended that of just 
healthcare by breaking down political, 
racial, and international borders.

He became a lifelong member of the 
NAACP where he helped build plans to 
desegregate the school system. He 
made numerous medical mission trips 
to Haiti. And he was a mentor to many 
up-and-coming doctors to whom he was 
known as the Godfather of Medicine for 
his loving and kind manner. 
I am proud to have had someone like 
Dr. Ball working in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia. Simply put, 
Dr. Ball is leaving Savannah and much 
of the rest of the world a better place 
than he found it. 
Dr. Ball’s family will be in my

BORIS NEMTSOV AND RUSSIAN 
MALIGN INFLUENCE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in commemoration of the life of Boris 
Nemtsov who was tragically assas-
sinated by Vladimir Putin’s Russian 
regime 5 years ago this week in Mos-
cow. Boris served as deputy prime min-
ister and was a prominent voice for po-
litical freedom in Russia itself. 
Cities across the world have com-
memorated Boris’ sacrifice, including 
here in Washington, D.C., which named 
the square outside the Russian Em-
bassy Boris Nemtsov Plaza. Just re-
cently, Czech authorities in Prague 
have joined in solidarity. 
In the years since Boris’ assassina-
tion, Russia’s efforts to dismantle 
democratic 
institutions 
across 
the 
globe have increased, including here in 
the United States where they are con-
tinuing to interfere in the elections of 
this year. 
We must stand together against Rus-
sia’s aggression and malign behavior. 
Sanctions are a commonsense step. 
Today, I call upon the Trump admin-
istration to broaden stronger, targeted 
sanctions on Russia. To keep back-
pedaling, as the Trump administration 
has done, on an enemy of liberty is not 
acceptable.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEEK 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, as we 
mark Public Schools Week, I want to 
recognize the extraordinary educators 
across my community and our country. 
In spite of deep, systemic inequities 
we face in funding for our public 
schools and this administration’s pro-
posed further cuts, there are efforts in 
every school district to teach and sup-
port our young people in every aspect 
of their lives: 
Programs like the Allentown School 
District’s partnership with Lehigh Car-
bon Community College, which allows 
students to earn an associate’s degree 
before leaving high school. 
Initiatives like the efforts in Beth-
lehem School District to provide uni-
versal screening for students’ mental 
health challenges and to increase com-
munity involvement. 
Robust arts education programs like 
those featured in the Freddy Awards, 
hosted each year by the State Theatre 
in Easton, recognizing exceptional high 
school theater departments across the 
region. 
Vital services like the food pantry in 
East Stroudsburg School District to 
support food insecure students, and 
business education projects like a cof-
fee shop run by students in the same 
district, providing those students an 
invaluable experience. 
When we invest in public education, 
we invest in our common future as a 
country. Let us commit to making 
those investments full and equitable.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL 
PROBLEM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WILD). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
today we are convening our monthly 
special order hour of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus to talk about a press-
ing issue to our Nation, to our planet, 
in fact, and especially to communities 
of color. 
Climate change is a real global prob-
lem. It is affecting folks around the 
world contributing to natural disasters 
and droughts that lead to immigration 
and increased conflict. 
We have seen how the Caribbean, 
which stands in the pathway of natural 
disasters, has been hit time and time 
again from Superstorm Maria to Hurri-
cane Irma to the recent earthquakes in 
Puerto Rico. We have seen how this re-
gion of the world, the Caribbean, which 
is our third border, continually gets 
hammered by natural disasters. 
In fact, just 2 days ago, the National 
Security, Military and Intelligence 
Panel of the Center for Climate and Se-
curity, a nonpartisan security policy 
institute, released a damning report. 
Within the report it said that higher 
levels of warming will pose a cata-
strophic and likely irreversible global 
security risk over the course of the 21st 
century. 
Last September, the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change released yet another dire warn-
ing that the effects of climate change 
are already irreversible, and we only 
have just about a decade to act before 
it is too late. 
One thing that is important, though, 
about climate change is the dispropor-
tionate impact it has on communities 
of color. This is called environmental 
injustice, and that is why it is impor-
tant that we address this from the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus perspec-
tive, the perspective of those rep-
resenting communities of color. 
Climate change affects our everyday 
lives in big ways and small ways. Take 
my grandson, for example. He suffers 
from asthma and acute allergies, and 
other health issues that a lot of our 
kids have that are worsened by air pol-
lution. 
The issue is communities of color are 
not the biggest contributors to the pol-
lution of climate change. In fact, they 
contribute less but are disproportion-
ately hurt by climate change. We take 
public transportation. We don’t fill our 
streets with very expensive polluting 
cars, but we bear the greatest burden 
from this and many other pollutants. 
This is also called environmental injus-
tice. 
That is why I have introduced a reso-
lution on environmental justice to en-
sure that the government acknowl-
edges and addresses the disproportional 
harm that climate change has on our 
community and communities of color. 
Let me just take a moment to talk 
about some of my other work on this 
issue, because I believe it is a good 
summary of aspects that need to be ad-
dressed. 
I was proud to support H.R. 9, the Cli-
mate Action Now Act, which passed 
the House last year and will keep the 
U.S. in the historic Paris climate ac-
cord. I was able to include an amend-
ment to that bill stating that climate 
justice and environmental justice must 
be included in our efforts to meet the 
Paris Agreement and mitigate and 
adapt to climate change. 
When we apply funding and when we 
allocate funding to address climate 
change, those communities in crisis 
must be given the funding first. This 
must be a core tenet of our policies to 
address climate change. Every law we 
pass and every action we take to miti-
gate and adapt to climate change must 
include acknowledgment and protec-
tions for marginalized and frontline 
communities who bear the burden of 
climate change. 
One of my predecessors in the U.S. 
Congress, the late, great Adam Clayton 
Powell, Jr., one of the great civil rights 
leaders of our times, led year after year 
his Powell amendments to ensure Fed-
eral funding did not support segrega-
tion. Every time he introduced the 
amendments, they would be voted 
down. They would be systematically 
shut down. But yet he continued to 
present them year after year after 
year. Finally, during the 1960s in the 
middle of that decade when the civil 
rights legislation was drafted and 
passed, that legislation which still ben-
efits many of us across America, it was 
the Powell amendment that was in-
cluded in civil rights legislation. 
Environmental justice is my Powell 
amendment, and I believe we must 
work to ensure that in every bill this 
House considers environmental justice 
is upheld and advanced. 
I have also introduced the Green Cli-
mate Fund Authorization Act which 
commits the United States to provide 
climate finances to keep the planet

under 1.5 degrees Celsius of global 
warming. 
b 1515 
The Green Climate Fund is an inde-
pendent, multilateral fund established 
by the United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change to help de-
veloping countries limit or reduce 
their greenhouse gas emissions and 
adapt to climate change. 
We often read about the migration 
dynamic playing out on our southern 
border, and we think very often that 
those families are fleeing violence. 
That may be the case for some fami-
lies, but many of them are also fleeing 
food security issues manifesting them-
selves in the triangle countries because 
of a horrible drought caused by climate 
change. 
Developing countries have limited 
capacity to reduce their greenhouse 
gas emissions, and through the Green 
Climate Fund, the U.S. can contribute 
our fair share to enable mitigation and 
adaptation activities that uphold envi-
ronmental justice across the globe. 
Because it is these exact nations that 
are also on the front line of climate 
change, though they have contributed 
the least to these causes. Yet, one of 
the most important new approaches to 
combating climate change that has re-
ceived a lot of traction and attention 
in the past year is the Green New Deal. 
I was proud to be an early supporter of 
this bold proposal, and many of my col-
leagues have since signed on to it and 
support it as well. 
The Green New Deal pushes us to 
reach net-zero emissions and a 100 per-
cent renewable economy to stop pol-
luting our planet and ensure a safe cli-
mate for generations, for all of us, to 
come. It epitomizes environmental jus-
tice for frontline communities, espe-
cially underresourced groups, commu-
nities of color, Native Americans, peo-
ple with disabilities, children, and sen-
iors. 
The Green New Deal calls for a just 
transition for communities and work-
ers to ensure that there are jobs and 
training for a clean economy. The 
Green New Deal will save American 
families money with investments in 
weatherization, public transportation, 
and modern infrastructure. 
We often talk about the infrastruc-
ture bill. Whether it is $1 trillion or $2 
trillion, it must be built green. 
It recognizes that combating climate 
change is an important intersection for 
promoting clean air and water and pro-
viding nutritious food, affordable and 
safe 
housing, 
and 
high-quality 
healthcare and jobs. 
The Green New Deal recognizes that 
we need to build resiliency in the face 
of worsening and more frequent cli-
mate-related 
disasters 
and 
that 
marginalized communities often bear 
the brunt of these disasters. 
Arguably, the most important aspect 
about the Green New Deal is that it 
forces us to think about combating cli-
mate change, not just in a singular pol-
icy aimed at emissions, but with all 
the policies we consider here in Con-
gress, whether it is energy, education, 
the economy, jobs, or infrastructure. 
We need serious investments to miti-
gate and adapt to climate change, but 
it will cost us more in the long term if 
we do not act now, financially and exis-
tentially. Climate change, ultimately, 
is an existential threat to all of us 
across America and across the planet. 
By the time a child born today re-
tires, in 2085, the U.S. will be spending 
$300 billion each year on climate resil-
iency. 
The time to invest is now. In fact, 
the time to invest was two decades ago. 
But here we are. We need serious in-
vestment in our infrastructure and our 
transportation systems. We need to in-
vest in green roof technology and inno-
vative urban agriculture to address not 
just the carbon emissions of the agri-
cultural field, but also to address inter-
sectional issues of food security and 
climate change. 
Earlier this year, our Democratic 
majority, led by Speaker NANCY PELOSI 
and Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee Chair PETER DEFAZIO, re-
leased a framework for infrastructure 
investment that takes many compo-
nents of the Green New Deal into ac-
count. 
It makes bold investments in public 
transportation 
systems 
to 
harness 
zero-emission technology and reduce 
congestion. It ensures that newly pro-
posed transit projects are judged on 
their capacity to reduce emissions and 
congestion. 
The framework includes provisions 
like those in the Transportation Alter-
natives Enhancement Act, which will 
prioritize projects that promote biking, 
walking, and other alternative, cleaner 
forms of transportation and infrastruc-
ture. The plan will boost investment in 
resiliency and green infrastructure to a 
degree that we have not yet seen be-
fore. It will make improvements in re-
gional water resources to protect local 
ecosystems across the Nation. 
In short, Democrats are proud to put 
forward proposals that will not only 
protect our planet but will invest in 
America’s 
communities, 
invest 
in 
American workers, and invest in Amer-
ica’s youth and future generations so 
we are prepared to tackle this momen-
tous task in the decades to come. And 
the Green New Deal is one of the ways 
we are doing just that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N), my colleague, the second 
vice chairperson of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for holding this Special Order to ad-
dress the impact of the fossil fuel in-
dustry on Latinos and how a Green 
New Deal can address the needs in our 
communities. 
From sea level rise, to the location of 
power plants, to fossil fuel extraction, 
to the urban heat island effect, the in-
equities from our energy system and 
who bears its consequences are every-
where. People of color are on the front 
line of this issue. We are hit first and 
worst. 
We need a climate bill that rises to 
the scale of both the climate crisis and 
the damage from environmental racism 
that impacts my district and the dis-
tricts like it across the country. 
The best way for us to understand 
these challenges and how to overcome 
them is to meet environmental justice 
communities where they are. 
Our local challenges can provide use-
ful information for Federal climate 
policy that can address environmental 
justice issues across the country. 
America needs to lead on a just tran-
sition away from fossil fuels, and cli-
mate solutions must account for what 
that means for communities like mine. 
We deal with pollution from oil refin-
eries and ongoing urban oil drilling, 
which has a direct impact on the qual-
ity of the air we breathe. 
At the same time that the fossil fuel 
industry has a disproportionate foot-
print in minority communities, these 
industries often provide jobs, including 
union jobs, to my constituents. As we 
work to unwind the fossil fuel econ-
omy, we need our climate policy to en-
sure a just transition includes the 
needs of communities of color. This 
means creating union jobs in the clean 
energy industry with great benefits, 
and it means opportunities for minor-
ity-owned businesses to play a role in 
the clean energy future of tomorrow. 
We must also focus on air emissions 
from ports and the communities near 
them bearing the burden. In my dis-
trict, I have the Port of Los Angeles, 
one of the most ambitious ports in the 
country when it comes to reducing 
emissions. At the same time, the port 
is a significant source of air and cli-
mate pollution, and communities in 
my district believe the best path for-
ward is for the port to achieve zero 
emissions as quickly as possible. 
These are challenges that face ports 
throughout our country. Our climate 
policy must invest in America’s ports 
to keep them competitive and on a 
pathway to zero emissions. 
As Democrats are in the majority, we 
are in a position to move swiftly and 
boldly on this issue, and we must do so. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with my colleagues this year 
to craft bold climate solutions that 
leave no community behind. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ), my col-
league. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
New York, Representative ESPAILLAT, 
for holding this incredibly important 
hour on not just the climate crisis but 
the Green New Deal, in particular. 
As I was preparing for this evening, I 
would be remiss but to say that, last 
night, we had a national Democratic 
debate, and not a single question was 
asked about our climate crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1217 
February 26, 2020 
Right now, the global consensus, the 
IPCC report coming out the U.N., is 
sounding the alarm on what will hap-
pen if we do not keep emissions down 
to contain our warming levels below 1.5 
degrees Celsius. But if you look at 
today, we are on track to hit 3 degrees 
Celsius by 2100. This can bring unprece-
dented chaos to our order. 
Throughout this entire year, as we 
discussed the Green New Deal, I have 
noticed that there has been an awful 
lot of misinformation about what is in-
side this resolution. A tremendous 
amount of wild claims, everything 
from saying we are seeking to ban air-
planes to ending ice cream. As a con-
sequence, I realized that many of my 
colleagues have never even read the 
resolution that they are speaking on. 
They haven’t opened a single word of 
it. It is actually only about—I have it 
right in front of me—14 pages long. 
So I have decided that since some of 
my colleagues across the aisle could 
not, for some reason, read the resolu-
tion, that perhaps this hour would be 
spent best reading it to them for the 
public record. 
So, today, what I would like to do is 
to read the Green New Deal resolution 
for all those who are interested, who 
may want to fire this up on C–SPAN, or 
who may want to sit in the audience 
today. 
H. Res. 109, resolution recognizing the duty 
of the Federal Government to create a Green 
New Deal. 
Whereas the October 2018 report entitled 
‘‘Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 
Celsius’’ by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change and the November 2018 
Fourth National Climate Assessment report 
found that— 
(1) human activity is the dominant cause 
of observed climate change over the past 
century; 
(2) a changing climate is causing sea levels 
to rise and an increase in wildfires, severe 
storms, droughts, and other extreme weather 
events that threaten human life, healthy 
communities, and critical infrastructure; 
(3) global warming at or above 2 degrees 
Celsius beyond preindustrialized levels will 
cause— 
(A) mass migration from the regions most 
affected by climate change; 
(B) more than $500 billion in lost annual 
economic output in the United States by the 
year 2100; 
(C) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually 
burn at least twice as much forest area in 
the Western United States than was typi-
cally burned by wildfires in the years pre-
ceding 2019; 
(D) a loss of more than 99 percent of all 
coral reefs on Earth; 
(E) more than 350 million more people to 
be exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 
2050; and 
(F) a risk of damage to $1 trillion of public 
infrastructure and coastal real estate in the 
United States; and 
(4) global temperatures must be kept below 
1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrialized 
levels to avoid the most severe impacts of a 
changing climate, which will require— 
(A) global reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions from human sources of 40 to 60 
percent from 2010 levels by 2030; and 
(B) net-zero global emissions by 2050; 
Whereas, because the United States has 
historically been responsible for a dispropor-
tionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions, 
having emitted 20 percent of global green-
house gas emissions through 2014, and has a 
high technological capacity, the United 
States must take a leading role in reducing 
emissions through economic transformation; 
Whereas the United States is currently ex-
periencing several related crises, with— 
(1) life expectancy declining while basic 
needs, such as clean air, clean water, healthy 
food, and adequate healthcare, housing, 
transportation, and education, are inacces-
sible to a significant portion of the U.S. pop-
ulation; 
(2) a four-decade trend of wage stagnation, 
deindustrialization, and antilabor policies 
that has led to— 
(A) hourly wages overall stagnating since 
the 1970s despite increased worker produc-
tivity; 
(B) the third-worst level of socioeconomic 
mobility in the developed world before the 
Great Recession; 
(C) the erosion of earning and bargaining 
power of workers in the United States; and 
(D) inadequate resources for public-sector 
workers to confront the challenges of cli-
mate change at local, State, and Federal lev-
els; and 
b 1530 
(3) the greatest income inequality since 
the 1920s, with— 
(A) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 
percent of gains in the first few years of eco-
nomic recovery after the Great Recession; 
(B) a large racial wealth divide amounting 
to a difference of 20 times more wealth be-
tween the average White family and the av-
erage Black family; and 
(C) a gender earnings gap that results in 
women earning approximately 80 percent as 
much as men, at the median; 
Whereas climate change, pollution, and en-
vironmental destruction have exacerbated 
systemic racial, regional, social, environ-
mental, and economic injustices (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘systemic injustices’’) by 
disproportionately affecting indigenous peo-
ples, communities of color, migrant commu-
nities, deindustrialized communities, de-
populated rural communities, the poor, low- 
income workers, women, the elderly, the 
unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘frontline 
and vulnerable communities’’); 
Whereas, climate change constitutes a di-
rect threat to the national security of the 
United States— 
(1) by impacting the economic, environ-
mental, and social stability of countries and 
communities around the world; and 
(2) by acting as a threat multiplier; 
Whereas the Federal Government-led mo-
bilizations during World War II and the New 
Deal created the greatest middle class that 
the United States has ever seen, but many 
members of frontline and vulnerable commu-
nities were excluded from many of the eco-
nomic and societal benefits of those mobili-
zations; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives rec-
ognizes that a new national, social, indus-
trial, and economic mobilization on a scale 
not seen since World War II and the New 
Deal era is a historic opportunity— 
(1) to create millions of good, high-wage 
jobs in the United States; 
(2) to provide unprecedented levels of pros-
perity and economic security for all people 
of the United States; and 
(3) to counteract systemic injustices: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House 
of Representatives that— 
(1) it is the duty of the Federal Govern-
ment to create a Green New Deal— 
(A) to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas 
emissions through a fair and just transition 
for all communities and workers; 
(B) to create millions of good, high-wage 
jobs and ensure prosperity and economic se-
curity for all people in the United States; 
(C) to invest in the infrastructure and in-
dustry of the United States to sustainably 
meet the challenges of the 21st century; 
(D) to secure for all people of the United 
States for generations to come— 
(i) clean air and water; 
(ii) climate and community resiliency; 
(iii) healthy food; 
(iv) access to nature; and 
(v) a sustainable environment; and 
(E) to promote justice and equity by stop-
ping current, preventing future, and repair-
ing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, 
communities of color, migrant communities, 
deindustrialized communities, depopulated 
rural communities, the poor, low-income 
workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, 
people with disabilities and youth (referred 
to in this resolution as ‘‘frontline and vul-
nerable communities’’); 
(2) the goals described in subparagraphs (A) 
through (E) of paragraph (1) (referred to in 
this resolution as the ‘‘Green New Deal 
goals’’) should be accomplished through a 10- 
year national mobilization (referred to in 
this resolution as the ‘‘Green New Deal mo-
bilization’’) that will require the following 
goals and projects— 
(A) building resiliency against climate 
change-related disasters, such as extreme 
weather, including by leveraging funding and 
providing investments for community-de-
fined projects and strategies; 
(B) repairing and upgrading the infrastruc-
ture in the United States, including— 
(i) by eliminating pollution and green-
house gas emissions as much as techno-
logically feasible; 
(ii) by guaranteeing universal access to 
clean water; 
(iii) by reducing the risks posed by climate 
impacts; and 
(iv) by ensuring that any infrastructure 
bill considered by Congress addresses cli-
mate change; 
(C) meeting 100 percent of the power de-
mand in the United States through clean, re-
newable, and zero-emission energy sources, 
including— 
(i) by dramatically expanding and upgrad-
ing renewable power sources; and 
(ii) by deploying new capacity; 
(D) building or upgrading energy-efficient, 
distributed, and ‘‘smart’’ power grids, and 
ensuring affordable access to electricity; 
(E) upgrading all existing buildings in the 
United States and building new buildings to 
achieve maximum energy efficiency, water 
efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and 
durability, including through electrification; 
(F) spurring massive growth in clean man-
ufacturing in the United States and remov-
ing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions 
from manufacturing and industry as much as 
is technologically feasible, including by ex-
panding renewable energy manufacturing 
and investing in existing manufacturing and 
industry; 
(G) working collaboratively with farmers 
and ranchers in the United States to remove 
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from 
the agricultural sector as much as is techno-
logically feasible, including— 
(i) by supporting family farming; 
(ii) by investing in sustainable farming and 
land use practices that increase soil health; 
and 
(iii) by building a more sustainable food 
system that ensures universal access to 
healthy food;

greenhouse gas emissions from the transpor-
tation sector as much as technologically fea-
sible, including through investment in— 
(i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and 
manufacturing; 
(ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public 
transit; and 
(iii) high-speed rail; 
(I) mitigating and managing the long-term 
adverse health, economic, and other effects 
of pollution and climate change, including 
by providing funding for community-defined 
projects and strategies; 
(J) removing greenhouse gases from the at-
mosphere and reducing pollution by restor-
ing natural ecosystems through proven low- 
tech solutions that increase soil carbon stor-
age, 
such 
as 
land 
preservation 
and 
afforestation; 
(K) restoring and protecting threatened, 
endangered, and fragile ecosystems through 
locally 
appropriate 
and 
science-based 
projects that enhance biodiversity and sup-
port climate resiliency; 
(L) cleaning up existing hazardous waste 
and abandoned sites, ensuring economic de-
velopment and sustainability on those sites; 
(M) identifying other emission and pollu-
tion sources and creating solutions to re-
move them; and 
(N) promoting the international exchange 
of technology, expertise, products, funding, 
and services, with the aim of making the 
United States the international leader on 
climate action, and to help other countries 
achieve a Green New Deal; 
(3) a Green New Deal must be developed 
through transparent and inclusive consulta-
tion, collaboration, and partnership with 
frontline and vulnerable communities, labor 
unions, worker cooperatives, civil society 
groups, academia, and businesses; and 
(4) to achieve the Green New Deal goals 
and mobilization, a Green New Deal will re-
quire the following goals and projects— 
(A) providing and leveraging, in a way that 
ensures that the public receives appropriate 
ownership stakes and returns on investment, 
adequate capital (including through commu-
nity grants, public banks, and other public 
financing), technical expertise, supporting 
policies, and other forms of assistance to 
communities, organizations, Federal, State, 
and local government agencies, and busi-
nesses working on the Green New Deal mobi-
lization; 
(B) ensuring that the Federal Government 
takes into account the complete environ-
mental and social costs and impacts of emis-
sions through— 
(i) existing laws; 
(ii) new policies and programs; and 
(iii) ensuring that frontline and vulnerable 
communities shall not be adversely affected; 
(C) providing resources, training, and high- 
quality education, including higher edu-
cation, to all people of the United States, 
with a focus on frontline and vulnerable 
communities, so that all people of the United 
States may be full and equal participants in 
the Green New Deal mobilization; 
(D) making public investments in the re-
search and development of new clean and re-
newable energy technologies and industries; 
(E) directing investments to spur economic 
development, deepen and diversify industry 
and business in local and regional economies, 
and build wealth and community ownership, 
while prioritizing high-quality job creation 
and economic, social, and environmental 
benefits in frontline and vulnerable commu-
nities, and deindustrialized communities, 
that may otherwise struggle with the transi-
tion away from greenhouse gas intensive in-
dustries; 
(F) ensuring the use of democratic and 
participatory processes that are inclusive of 
and led by frontline and vulnerable commu-
nities and workers to plan, implement, and 
administer the Green New Deal mobilization 
at the local level; 
(G) ensuring that the Green New Deal mo-
bilization creates high-quality union jobs 
that pay prevailing wages, hires local work-
ers, offers training and advancement oppor-
tunities, and guarantees wage and benefit 
parity for workers affected by the transition; 
(H) guaranteeing a job with a family-sus-
taining wage, adequate family and medical 
leave, paid vacations, and retirement secu-
rity to all people of the United States; 
(I) strengthening and protecting the right 
of all workers to organize, unionize, and col-
lectively bargain free of coercion, intimida-
tion, and harassment; 
(J) strengthening and enforcing labor, 
workplace health and safety, antidiscrimina-
tion, and wage and hour standards across all 
employers, industries, and sectors; 
(K) enacting and enforcing trade rules, pro-
curement standards, and border adjustments 
with strong labor and environmental protec-
tions— 
(i) to stop the transfer of jobs and pollu-
tion overseas; and 
(ii) to grow domestic manufacturing in the 
United States; 
(L) ensuring that public lands, waters, and 
oceans are protected and that eminent do-
main is not abused; 
(M) obtaining the free, prior, and informed 
consent of indigenous peoples for all deci-
sions that affect indigenous peoples and 
their traditional territories, honoring all 
treaties and agreements with indigenous 
peoples, and protecting and enforcing the 
sovereignty and land rights of indigenous 
peoples; 
(N) ensuring a commercial environment 
where every businessperson is free from un-
fair competition and domination by domes-
tic or international monopolies; and 
(O) providing all people of the United 
States with— 
(i) high-quality healthcare; 
(ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing; 
(iii) economic security; and 
(iv) clean water, clean air, healthy and af-
fordable food, and access to nature. 
That is every word in the Green New 
Deal, and I want every person in this 
body and across the country to ask 
themselves why this is so controver-
sial. 
Why is healthcare for every Amer-
ican so controversial? 
Why is protecting our planet for the 
next generation so controversial? 
Why is dignified labor and protection 
at work so controversial? 
Why is taking on the fossil fuel in-
dustry so, so controversial? 
Because, 
for 
years, 
we 
have 
prioritized the pursuit of profit at any 
and all human and environmental cost. 
I humbly ask my colleagues and my 
country to question our priorities for 
once, because our priorities have led to 
an unprecedented amount of income in-
equality to millions of people living in 
poverty and many more who feel unsta-
ble in their economic life. 
So, please, as a moral, economic, and 
political prerogative, I humbly ask our 
country to care for our planet.

Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the great 
State of New York, Congresswoman 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, and the 98 Members 
who are cosponsors of the Green New 
Deal. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
allow me to thank the gentleman from 
New York for his friendship and for the 
recognition that the clarion call has to 
be called. 
Let me thank my colleague and 
friend from New York as well, from the 
great borough of the Bronx, ALEXAN-
DRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ, for her clarion 
call. 
I want to take this from a perspec-
tive of civil rights and the idea that, 
most often, civil rights are defined by 
the movement of the 1960s, framed 
around the marches of poor people led 
by Dr. King and many others who saw 
the inequities dealing with the treat-
ment of African Americans and others 
in the social justice system. 
One might not think that that move-
ment ties directly to where we are 
today. As a cosponsor of the Green New 
Deal, I see this as a question of social 
justice. 
When 
the 
foot 
soldiers 
marched, many did not understand why 
they were attempting to change the 
way people had lived for decades and, 
yes, centuries. They didn’t fully under-
stand that the unequal treatment 
under the law was oppressive and de-
nied families, children, regions of the 
country the ability to reach their high-
est dream. 
I represent, still, the many commu-
nities that are experiencing inequities. 
When I held a meeting some weeks ago 
to deal with what we call cancer clus-
ters, I had a thousand people at a town-
hall meeting. A chemical, creosote, had 
gotten into the soil of neighborhoods, 
which, in Texas, with your patches of 
land, front yard or back yard, you 
plant your fruit trees and other garden 
vegetables. 
I asked: ‘‘If you have cancer or your 
relatives have cancer, would you stand 
up?’’ 
Two-thirds 
of 
that 
audience 
stood. Today, I am still getting calls 
from people in surrounding neighbor-
hoods, talking about that chemical. 
When you begin to look at purifying 
and cleaning, making sure the air qual-
ity is clean, making sure the soil qual-
ity is clean, it is looking at ways not 
to diminish people who are working in 
industries, who are in hardworking, 
blue-collar jobs, but to expand their vi-
sion of what can happen if you commit 
to the reasonable policies of the Green 
New Deal that speak to bringing every-
one to the table and addressing this as 
a civil rights moment, not judging it 
on the inequities of race but on the in-
equities of the quality of your neigh-
borhood and the quality of your life. 
As I listened to the reading of the 
legislation, there is room at the table 
for everyone. There is room at the 
table for scientists. I was a member of 
the Science Committee for a good num-
ber of years. I believe in good science. 
There is room at the table for techni-
cians, people who are embracing tech-
nology. 
There is room at the table for pri-
mary and secondary students who can

learn what climate change has done 
and what the impact is, and how 
science is connected to a green econ-
omy. 
There is room at the table for elected 
officials. 
There is room at the table for large 
industries that have in their companies 
huge departments dealing with the en-
vironment. 
The sadness is that that information 
is not given to all of those who look at 
these companies and see a particular 
purpose, but they don’t know that they 
are working on environmental issues. 
My argument would be about education 
and information, and understanding 
that there is so much about quality of 
life that is tied to the quality of the air 
and water. 
Now, just one moment of deviation, 
as a member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, as one of the first Members 
who went to her district to speak about 
the coronavirus, asking why the ad-
ministration had done nothing and had 
not given information to the American 
public, who said that it was urgent 
that they give this information. Unfor-
tunately, in a presentation which we 
have seen when we deal with climate 
change or the Green New Deal, it was 
reported to us, Members of Congress, 
that there was nothing to worry about; 
it wouldn’t get here to the United 
States. 
Well, I dealt with H1N1 as a Member 
of Congress, and the Ebola virus, which 
hit Dallas, Texas. I am in Houston, and 
before we understood what it was, var-
ious providers had treated the indi-
vidual but had already left the State. 
Information can save lives. 
Just recently, before I left Houston, I 
had a press conference to at least share 
with the community the various docu-
ments and handouts about how one 
should react to any signs of a flu-like 
symptom, not to diagnose yourself, but 
to get to a health provider. In the 
Green New Deal, it talks about access 
to healthcare. 
Many of my constituents died from 
creosote because they had no access to 
healthcare. When I say creosote, the 
ramifications—cancer, respiratory ill-
nesses. 
I rise today to join my colleagues in 
a clarion call. I am supposed to be at 
the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee 
right now, but I really wanted to join 
in this commitment that we need to in-
form, educate, and activate so that we 
can begin to be on the journey in 
America, the greatest Nation in the 
world. 
In fact, the United States of America 
is the Nation now that is being looked 
on to bring relief on the coronavirus. 
And we are still missing a team or a 
plan. 
But the greatest Nation in the world 
can now be at the forefront of leading 
the idea that green is real and right, 
and it is good for the American people, 
good for our families, good for our chil-
dren, good for the leadership that we 
must give to developing nations and 
other nations around the world. 
I rise to join my colleagues and 
thank them again for their leadership. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE from the State of Texas, Congress-
woman NANETTE BARRAGA´ N from the 
State of California, and Congress-
woman 
ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO-CORTEZ 
from the great State of New York for 
bringing important facts to the table 
that will dispel the scare tactics that 
are being deployed and peddled across 
America about this Green New Deal. It 
will save lives. 
I represent the district that has one 
of the highest asthma rates in the 
State, Harlem. There is a significant 
number of bus depots in Harlem pol-
luting the air. In East Harlem, the 
children have one of the highest levels 
of respiratory diseases and asthma. 
Washington 
Heights 
is 
cut 
right 
through its heart by a polluting rail-
way called the Cross Bronx Express-
way. We are surrounded by highways, 
and we are surrounded by pollution, 
leading to a very low quality of air, 
which leads to disease and leads to 
death. 
This has been an enlightened con-
versation about the Green New Deal. I 
hope America understands the particu-
lars behind it and that we are better 
equipped and better informed to make 
the right decisions in support of this 
lifesaving piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for this 
opportunity to allow the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus to talk about the im-
portance of protecting our planet in 
the way in which the Green New Deal 
will do, while we are also making our 
Nation better. 
I thank everyone who was able to 
participate, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
first, I want to address a bill that we 
voted on this afternoon, one of the 
three bills under the suspension of the 
rules, H.R. 35, to amend section 249 of 
title 18, United States Code, to specify 
lynching as a hate crime act. 
I was in the Judiciary Committee 
when we took up the hate crimes act. I 
know there were people who said be-
cause of James Byrd, the African 
American who was drug behind a truck 
by three individuals, that that was a 
poster case that demanded hate crime 
legislation. 
Actually, I was quite comfortable if 
all three of the defendants in that case 
had gotten the death penalty. In Texas, 
we do have the death penalty for such 
a crime as that. Two of the three got 
the death penalty. One got life in pris-
on. And I felt like the death penalty, 
from everything I had read, was appro-
priate. 
I am someone who has looked two de-
fendants in the eye and sentenced them 
to death. It is a very somber, serious 
thing to do, but the crimes justified it 
in those cases. 
I was talking to my friend, Congress-
man BOBBY RUSH, a man who has been 
fighting 
injustice 
and 
unfairness, 
seems like, his whole life. He is abso-
lutely one of the kindest, most decent 
people to talk to and deal with here in 
Congress. He is just a real gentleman. 
This was Congressman RUSH’s bill. And 
I mentioned to him after the vote—I 
did vote ‘‘no’’ on this. 
Now, there are some great findings 
for the first six pages. But at page 7, we 
finally get to actually what the act 
does. It says: Whoever conspires with 
another to violate section 245, 247, or 
249 of this title or section 901 of the 
Civil Rights Act shall be punished in 
the same manner as a completed viola-
tion of such section, except that if the 
maximum term of imprisonment for 
such completed violation is less than 10 
years, the person may be imprisoned 
for not more than 10 years. 
That is ridiculous. First of all, I have 
trouble with the Federal nexus of 
lynching. I would, like in the James 
Byrd case, prefer that those defendants 
be tried under the Texas capital mur-
der statute rather than under the Fed-
eral hate crimes law. Because under 
the Texas capital murder laws, the de-
fendants could get the death penalty. 
And they should have been tried under 
that and should have gotten it. 
I have such respect for Congressman 
RUSH. Lynching is more serious than a 
10-year maximum sentence. And I 
would much rather, if somebody is 
lynched in Texas, they be subject, 
under Texas law, to the death penalty 
rather than a 10-year maximum. It 
sends 
entirely 
the 
wrong 
message 
about how serious this is. I couldn’t 
vote for a 10-year maximum when we 
are talking about lynching. 
I know there are some States that 
don’t have good criminal laws, that 
maybe they would prefer the Federal 
Government try such cases. But Con-
gressman RUSH said this was the best 
he could get an agreement on. But, God 
bless him, he knows better than most 
people how serious this is. 
So on the one hand, I applaud his ef-
forts at trying to bring people to jus-
tice who would commit such a heinous 
act, and I regret needing to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
But I just felt like this is too serious to 
be handled at such a low level. 
b 1600 
So I thank Congressman RUSH for his 
efforts. He is indeed a very fine man. It 
is a pleasure to interact with him here 
in Congress, but I couldn’t vote for 
that. That is just too serious. 
I have had a friend I met here years 
ago named Philip Haney. He was one of 
the finest, most patriotic, competent 
people I have ever known in my life, a 
man of absolute honesty, complete in-
tegrity, who cared deeply about the fu-
ture of this country. He also was a

Christian brother, and that certainly 
affected so much of what he did. 
Philip studied Arabic culture and 
language while he was working as a 
scientist in the Middle East before he 
became a founding member of the De-
partment of Homeland Security in 2002. 
He was there at the beginning when 
Homeland Security became a Depart-
ment for the first time. He was a Cus-
toms 
and 
Border 
Protection 
agri-
culture officer. 
He was a scientist by education and 
training. It was amazing how organized 
and how brilliant he was. I constantly 
marveled at his ability to organize 
facts in his own head and memorize 
them, remember things so clearly. 
But after he advanced as a CBP offi-
cer, where he served several tours of 
duty at the National Targeting Center 
near Washington, D.C., he was quickly 
promoted to its Advanced Targeting 
Team, which was an unprecedented ac-
complishment for an agent on tem-
porary duty assignment. 
The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force 
Award was something he was presented 
in recognition of his exceptional con-
tributions to interagency national se-
curity successes. He won numerous 
awards and commendations from his 
superiors for meticulously compiling 
information and reports that led to the 
identification of hundreds of terrorists. 
He specialized in Islamic theology 
and the strategy and tactics of the 
global Islamic movement. He wrote a 
book after he left and retired from gov-
ernment service, a takeoff on the 
Obama administration’s slogan, ‘‘See 
Something, Say Something.’’ 
But, as he experienced firsthand, he 
saw things that were a threat to this 
country, he said something, and he was 
severely punished for it, because appar-
ently the Obama administration had 
some radical Islamic ties that they did 
not want anybody, including Philip 
Haney, to expose. 
So, he had a book that he wrote, ‘‘See 
Something, Say Nothing,’’ and it docu-
mented the Obama administration’s ef-
fort to obfuscate the role that radical 
Islam played in numerous terrorist at-
tacks that took place in America from 
2008 to 2016. 
One review of Philip’s book described 
it as an expose of a politically correct 
Federal Government that capitulates 
to a subversive enemy within and pun-
ishes those who reject its narrative. 
In 2016, he, as a whistleblower, testi-
fied before the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, chaired by then-Senator TED 
CRUZ, to allege that the Obama admin-
istration had acted irresponsibly con-
cerning 
Islamic 
extremism. 
Philip 
Haney claimed that the administration 
had acted in favor of political correct-
ness rather than take actions that may 
well have prevented the June 2016 
Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando 
and the San Bernardino shooting in De-
cember of 2015. 
He was investigating groups that 
helped radicalize normal Muslim be-
lievers, radicalizing them to the point 
that they would commit acts of terror, 
and he found some ties. It was amaz-
ing, when he got ahold of a string, how 
he could trace that string back to its 
roots. 
He once said that he did, at the De-
partment of Homeland Security, what 
he did with bugs: He followed the trail 
and found the nest. It was amazing how 
he could do that, and that is the reason 
he was cited as he was. 
In fact, this letter from June 8 of 2012 
to Officer Philip B. Haney: 
On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection, I commend your outstanding con-
tributions while assigned to the National 
Targeting Center-Passenger. Your display of 
dedication and effort in the fight against ter-
rorism has been exemplary. 
Your talents and professionalism have con-
tributed to the continued achievements of 
the NTC-P. You played a key role by pro-
viding support to the CBP mission and the 
NTC lead role in defending and protecting 
our Nation’s borders. A key component of 
the National Targeting Center-Passenger’s 
success is the invaluable people, like you, 
who perform the work in our important mis-
sion. I am confident to know that CBP can 
rely upon you to provide expertise to combat 
threats against our Nation. 
Additionally, your expertise and experi-
ence has been invaluable while assigned to 
the Advanced Targeting Team. Your re-
search on the Tablighi Jamaat Initiative has 
assisted in the identification of over 300 per-
sons with possible connections to terrorism. 
The assistance you have provided in the de-
velopment of this initiative has been key to 
the future success of the project. The Na-
tional Targeting Center looks forward to 
your continuing support and assistance in 
the program. 
Once again, thank you for your unfailing 
commitment to the success of the National 
Targeting System mission. Your professional 
actions and achievements reflect favorably 
on you and all of the Customs and Border 
Protection. 
Thank you for a job well done. 
Well, that was June of 2012. It wasn’t 
terribly long after that he had been en-
tering information on radical Islamic 
ties with people in the United States, 
attempting to come into the United 
States, with ties to people in the 
United States. He was documenting all 
those things. 
We had a Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity who bragged about how Home-
land Security could connect the dots, 
and then he was ordered to start re-
moving these dots, so to speak. He was 
ordered to start deleting thousands of 
pages of data that he had carefully re-
searched and identified that would help 
protect America. 
That was during the Obama adminis-
tration. 
He was scared for his country, that 
the Obama administration would make 
him delete, and there was an occasion 
when he was watching his computer 
and somebody started deleting hun-
dreds of pages of documents as he 
watched, hundreds of pages of informa-
tion that would have helped keep 
America safe for the future. 
There was an opportunity the House 
of Representatives had—we were in the 
majority—where he could have been 
brought in as a specially requested 
agent for the House. Apparently, there 
were people who were afraid that he 
had so much information that the 
Obama 
administration 
might 
come 
after anybody who was attempting to 
help or protect him and the valuable 
information he had. 
He wasn’t brought in. He was told: 
Oh, go file an IG complaint with the 
Homeland Security inspector general. 
I implored him that that would be a 
mistake because the inspector general 
at that time at Homeland Security had 
already been cited for falsifying an IG 
report to protect the Obama adminis-
tration. We knew that it was not going 
to be a fair inspector general investiga-
tion. 
In fact, he became a whistleblower, 
filed his IG complaint about the Obama 
administration deleting so much data 
from its database to help identify ter-
rorists, and, clearly, for anybody who 
was involved in that effort to purge our 
computer data on foreign terrorists, 
his complaint could be seen as a threat 
to expose people within the Obama ad-
ministration who were involved in 
purging or, as one of our intel people— 
Homeland Security, like DOJ, began to 
blind itself of the ability to see our en-
emies. 
That is why, even though he was in-
vestigating Tablighi Jamaat and the 
manner in which normal Muslim be-
lievers were converted into radicals 
who would be capable of murder, there 
were a number of things that he no-
ticed that they did to move people in 
that direction. 
He identified that the people at San 
Bernardino who killed, I think it was, 
14 Americans there, that, if he had 
been allowed to pursue his investiga-
tion, would have identified those peo-
ple. 
We blinded ourselves of the ability to 
see our enemy, and we also had not 
been training people. 
Philip had identified a female in Cali-
fornia involved in the shooting. She 
took on the name of a famous radical 
Islamic male terrorist. If he had been 
allowed to question her, he would have 
immediately known: There is some-
thing very wrong here. Why would you 
take on the name of a male terrorist, 
historic terrorist? 
But it had been made very clear in 
the Obama administration that, if you 
are too active in pursuit of radical 
Islamists, it is not going to go well for 
you. 
b 1615 
And, in fact, after he filed the IG re-
port, I think it was an effort for some 
in the Obama administration to pro-
tect themselves. We have now seen it 
occur with the Trump campaign. 
There was a Grand Jury that was 
convened to go after and try to destroy 
Philip 
Haney’s 
life. 
His 
wife, 
Francesca, was a college professor, and 
the trauma of being raided, constantly 
harassed, and questioned, seeing one of 
the finest, most honest and honorable 
protectors of America in our history,

Philip Haney, she saw him just being 
savaged. And it ended up resulting in 
her going to the hospital. Whether it 
was a full-blown nervous breakdown or 
not, I am not sure, but it sent her to 
the hospital to have the United States 
Government go after a man she knew 
was a hero for and to the United 
States. 
Well, Philip was so meticulous, so or-
ganized. They couldn’t find anything 
with which to indict him. They were 
trying to drag up something, but he 
had documented well everything he had 
ever done. It was the way he was. It is 
who he was. They couldn’t find any-
thing to indict him. They had already 
moved him in basically a closet, kept 
him from doing the job he was the best 
at in protecting America. And finally 
they basically said, we can’t find any-
thing. So, look, if you will just agree to 
retire, then we will let everything go, 
but you have got to destroy stuff in 
your possession. 
Well, he retired, and that is when he 
wrote the book See Something, Say 
Nothing. He had been savaged by his 
own government, his own country that 
he was trying to protect. 
And I had commented to him about 
his book. He had given me a draft to 
read before it was published. I said, 
Philip, you don’t really name a whole 
lot of names in this book about where 
the problems have been. He said, ‘‘I 
know, this is just the first draft. I will 
do another that names names.’’ And 
that is what he was working on. 
After Francesca died about a year 
ago, he moved to California and was 
near his sister, Diana. I was so thrilled 
to get a text from Philip saying basi-
cally, I have met someone. She is won-
derful. They were soul mates. And I 
texted him that I had a minister friend 
that had said, you know, it is inter-
esting, when men who have been in 
long marriages have their wife pass 
away, it is not unusual; in fact, it may 
be average, to have them remarried in 
6 months. Of course, he volunteered, 
women that had been in a longstanding 
marriage when their husband dies, a 
lot of them don’t ever want to remarry. 
It is an interesting difference. 
I wasn’t surprised that Philip had 
found love again. Philip and Denise 
were going to be married on April 4. It 
appeared he would be coming back to 
work for the United States Govern-
ment and finally be able to put to full 
use his incredible knack for rooting 
out terrorists. 
I was amazed, because when you met 
Philip, you weren’t sure. He was kind 
of a quiet guy, and you didn’t realize at 
first just how brilliant he was. He 
could ask questions—and I know he did 
this with people trying to come into 
the country—and he got people to vol-
unteer information. I bet they thought, 
oh, this guy, what a doofus. What does 
he know? He got them to volunteer in-
formation that I doubt I could have 
ever gotten out of them, no matter how 
tough a cross-examination I had done. 
But Phil in his amazing way, he could 
get information out of people. It was 
amazing what he was able to do and ca-
pable of doing. 
So he had hoped to be coming back in 
the next few weeks to work for the 
Federal Government. But then he got 
some news last week that he needed to 
have open heart surgery. The chances 
of success were very good. Complete 
success shouldn’t be too long of a recu-
peration time. And he passed that 
along to the person that he was going 
to be coming to work for in the Federal 
Government. Sent him a text, I have 
got to have open heart surgery next 
week, but basically hope to be avail-
able for work shortly after that. Short 
recuperation. 
Philip either talked or texted with 
his sister virtually every day, and they 
texted up to the evening last Thursday. 
And Friday he was found in his car 
with a gunshot wound and a gun near-
by. 
I think the Amador County law offi-
cials are doing a decent job. They seem 
to be very committed. But his book 
was going to name names of people 
that put this country at risk. He was 
getting married April 4. Finally going 
to be able to come back to the U.S. 
Government and use his incredible tal-
ents and ability to spot danger for our 
country and stop it, and he ends up 
with a bullet in him. 
So the investigation is ongoing. He is 
severely missed by those of us who 
loved him. We had talked back before 
he filed the IG complaint, I had been 
concerned about his safety with all the 
information he knew and the people 
that could have gotten in trouble. And 
we had a mutual pact, if it was said ei-
ther one of us ended up having com-
mitted suicide, then the other is going 
to make sure that truth wins out. 
He was so organized, though. He had 
made it clear to his sister that there 
was something he was going to do and 
something he was doing, he said you 
need to come over because I have got 
everything laid out. If something hap-
pens during the heart surgery next 
week, I have everything laid out. And 
that is how he was, everything was so 
organized. I would love to be as orga-
nized as Phil. 
Philip had such a positive outlook on 
things. He had been through a horren-
dous time with his wife having been 
made ill by the raucous Obama admin-
istration coming after him to try to 
shut him up. 
See, that is a real whistleblower. He 
testified before the Senate. That is 
what a real whistleblower does. A real 
whistleblower does not remain anony-
mous. They come forward, subject 
themselves to cross-examination, and 
supposedly have protection. 
But that is not what happened in the 
Obama administration. In fact, the 
Obama 
administration 
prosecuted 
more people for leaking than every 
other administration in our country’s 
history added together. They went 
after whistleblowers. Rather tragic. I 
can’t adequately express it. 
February 5, 2016, The Hill had an arti-
cle about Phil. ‘‘DHS Ordered Me to 
Scrub Records of Muslims with Terror 
Ties.’’ 
Conservative HQ, George Rasley has 
done a really nice piece; ‘‘In Memo-
riam: Philip B. Haney, 21st Century 
Paul Revere.’’ 
Fox News had an article by Nick 
Givas, ‘‘Philip Haney, DHS Whistle-
blower 
During 
Obama 
Era, 
Found 
Dead, Police Say.’’ 
Joe Martin, ‘‘Philip Haney: Whistle-
blower and Happy Warrior.’’ 
What an amazing man. I miss him. I 
miss getting his cheery text messages. 
And I know his fiance and his sister 
and even his brother-in-law misses get-
ting those messages, as well. 
So there is big news supposedly that 
the Trump administration is now try-
ing to make sure that people that are 
working for the Trump administration 
are actually working for it and not 
against it. 
And the truth is, President Trump 
got some bad advice from people that 
were not concerned about his achieving 
the goals he promised he would work 
toward, but they were interested in 
stopping him. 
We found out after the George W. 
Bush administration there were hold-
overs from the Clinton years that 
would tell President Bush, yes, sir, we 
will take care of it, and then drag their 
feet and made sure what he wanted 
didn’t happen, and even would leak in-
formation to try to stop President 
Bush from achieving what he hoped to 
achieve. And we have certainly seen 
that occur in the Trump administra-
tion. 
In fact, an article mentions Rich Hig-
gins, he had prepared information, ba-
sically a memo, on how to move for-
ward and how the Trump administra-
tion could protect itself from people 
that would try to stop President 
Trump and to make sure that people 
working for him were actually working 
for him. 
But a buddy of Mr. Brennan and Mr. 
Clapper, named H.R. McMaster, found 
out about the memo and instead of re-
warding Rich Higgins for his brilliant 
work to help the Trump administra-
tion, he had him perp walked out and 
refused to let him even go back to his 
office. Because Mr. McMaster, despite 
his front and his sucking up to Presi-
dent Trump, he was all about stopping 
President Trump. 
And for his time there he may have 
helped on some little things, but over-
all he was making sure—it certainly 
appeared to me he was making sure— 
that President Trump didn’t achieve 
the goals he hoped to, and, in fact, was 
heard to bad-mouth, say vulgar things 
about President Trump. So it was good 
when he was gone. 
And President Trump has continued 
to work on efforts to get people that 
actually want to help him achieve his 
goals. And naturally deep-state estab-
lishment people in Washington, they 
don’t want to see that happen, so they

throw up things like, oh, gee, the 
Trump administration is on a witch 
hunt. It is not on a witch hunt. It just 
wants people that will work to help the 
President achieve his goals. 
If, for example, you have an inane 
person working with the National Se-
curity Council and in his mind he 
knows everything that anybody needs 
to know about Ukraine, and he puts to-
gether talking points for the President 
to use in talking to the President of 
Ukraine and the President doesn’t fol-
low his expert talking points because 
the President is foreign policy when he 
gets elected, not what some lieutenant 
colonel 
thinks—but 
you 
can 
tell 
Vindman got a burr in his saddle, so to 
speak, when the President didn’t follow 
his talking points to a T. 
b 1630 
He needed to go. It appears he likely 
leaked information to the so-called 
whistleblower, 
not 
a 
real 
whistle-
blower. 
A real whistleblower is a man of 
courage and integrity, like Phil Haney. 
That is a real whistleblower. 
A real whistleblower is somebody 
like Adam Lovinger, who sees that the 
Department of Defense is paying hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars, multiple 
payments, to some professor in London 
named Stefan Halper, who happens to 
be setting up the Trump campaign so 
that they can get warrants against it, 
and the Department of Defense is pay-
ing this guy. But Adam’s job is making 
sure the Defense Department was get-
ting their money’s worth when they 
paid, and he couldn’t see they were get-
ting any money’s worth from this Ste-
fan Halper guy in London. 
If the left really wants to see some-
body prosecuted who was in the U.S. 
Government who was paying for for-
eign 
interference 
in 
our 
election, 
maybe they should start with the guys 
that came after Adam Lovinger, a real 
whistleblower, not like this guy that 
filed a secret complaint that wasn’t 
firsthand, had no personal knowledge. 
They just knew they wanted to stop 
President Trump and didn’t mind put-
ting the United States Government at 
risk by doing so, because, after all, 
they hated the President. 
So it is worth looking back a little 
bit. 
Here is an article from October 19, 
2016, titled ‘‘Obama’s plan to make the 
administrative state permanent,’’ by 
Nathan Mehrens. This is before the 
election, a month before the 2016 elec-
tion. He points out that: ‘‘President 
Obama’s cronies are being placed into 
permanent staff positions in the Fed-
eral Government, and the administra-
tion is not even bothering to follow its 
own personnel rules which govern the 
process.’’ 
Apparently, there were people in the 
Obama administration that realized: 
You know, there is a chance Trump 
could win this election. Even though 
we are sure the American people will 
elect Hillary Clinton, there is a chance. 
There are supposedly around 4,000 
people or so that an administration ap-
points into politically appointed posi-
tions, but those people are subject to 
being fired on the whim of a new Presi-
dent. So, according to this article, the 
Obama administration started taking 
people who were political appointees 
and moving them into career appoint-
ments. 
We have even seen a case in Arizona 
where a Federal employee commits a 
Federal crime, is found guilty of a Fed-
eral crime, and a court comes back 
later and said: Eh, that wasn’t an ade-
quate basis to fire a Federal employee. 
Well, once you get into a position 
like she was in, it is hard to root them 
out even when they have committed a 
Federal crime in their job. That was in 
the VA. We have changed the law with 
regard to VA to make it easier to fire 
felons that commit felonies when they 
are in their job at the VA. 
The Office of Personnel Manage-
ment’s Director in November 2009 made 
a big show of a new policy requiring 
prior approval for these conversions, 
taking a political appointee and what 
is called burrowing them into the Fed-
eral Government so they will be part of 
the deep state, hard to ever get rid of, 
when they are nothing but political 
hacks. 
This statement says: 
I believe we must hold ourselves and the 
government to a higher standard, one that 
honors and supports the President’s strong 
commitment to a government that is trans-
parent and open. OPM’s responsibility to up-
hold the merit system is not limited to Pres-
idential election years nor to competitive 
service appointments. That is why I am in-
stituting a change in OPM policy with re-
spect to hiring political appointees for civil 
service jobs. 
They go on to say that in order to 
convert somebody from political ap-
pointee to career civil service status, 
they have to get the permission of 
OPM. But as the article says, appar-
ently, some agencies didn’t see the 
need to bother with that permission, 
and they processed conversions with-
out OPM permission. 
So we see what is happening. 
Here is another article, this one is 
from November 27, after President 
Trump was elected: 
Congressional Republicans are warning the 
departing Obama administration against 
moving any more political appointees into 
career jobs. 
But that is what they had done. 
It says: ‘‘Senate Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee 
Chairman Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Re-
publican, has asked Acting OPM Direc-
tor Beth Cobert for weekly reports on 
all conversions or attempted conver-
sions.’’ 
But I would be willing to bet they 
didn’t get what they were asking for, 
certainly not all of it. 
This article is from December 8, 2016. 
This is from the Daily Signal, Fred 
Lucas: ‘‘After President Barack Obama 
exits office, at least 88 of his political 
appointees will likely remain working 
in the Federal Government under a 
Donald Trump administration, accord-
ing to numbers from the Office of Per-
sonnel Management.’’ 
It goes on to talk about ‘‘Federal 
agencies 
selected 
112 
political 
ap-
pointees for career civil service jobs,’’ 
and that is just in December. They had 
about another 6 weeks to be moving 
people from political appointee posi-
tions into civil service so that when 
President Trump came in, he would 
have people in key positions who would 
hate him, be loyal to people like Sally 
Yates and President Obama, others, 
Brennan, Clapper. They could under-
mine the Trump administration, as 
they have been doing for 3 years now. 
In Axios, Jonathan Swan comes out 
with an article this week that appears 
to be taking aim at some people who 
are friends of the President who are 
trying to help him figure out who it is 
that is undermining and has no inter-
est in helping President Trump achieve 
his goals and, in fact, has an interest in 
destroying them. 
Three years in, I would think a Presi-
dent should be entitled to people work-
ing for him who are actually working 
for him and not against him, but I am 
sure there will be more people who I 
classify as heroes trying to help Presi-
dent Trump make America even great-
er by getting the people out that are 
trying to stop what he promised to do. 
People will come after one of my he-
roes, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Su-
preme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, 
and Barbara Ledeen, and those who are 
coming after people that are trying to 
help President Trump, have people who 
actually like him working for him, not 
people who can just suck up to him, 
but people who will actually like him, 
support his agenda, and want to help, 
and I think we will be seeing a lot more 
of that. 
It is a shame that they have not been 
doing articles pointing out some of 
these duplicitous people who say they 
are loyal to the Trump administration, 
and they do all they can to undermine 
it and violate their oaths. 
I still believe if Durham doesn’t end 
up indicting some people who could go 
to jail, we won’t get the country back. 
There is no deterrence in what has 
gone on so far. People abused the FISA 
court system, repeatedly lied to a Fed-
eral judge or judges in the FISA court 
to get warrants to spy on the Trump 
administration. 
If there are no consequences, if peo-
ple who have made it an instrument of 
politics to use the intelligence commu-
nity, Department of Justice, Depart-
ment of Defense, State Department to 
try to defeat a Presidential candidate, 
and then when he gets elected, try to 
remove him from office, if there aren’t 
multiple people who go to jail for what 
they have done, the crimes committed, 
then there is no deterrence. They will 
be up to it even bigger, but next time, 
they will have figured out where they 
made mistakes in getting caught and 
being unsuccessful, and we will lose the

freedom we once had to select our own 
leaders. 
But I don’t hear of these authors. I 
don’t read any of these authors actu-
ally condemning the DNC, the Clinton 
campaign, the Department of Defense, 
the DOJ in using and getting help from 
foreigners to try to combat the Trump 
campaign and to affect our election. 
Anybody who would say on this floor 
that there were no Ukrainians involved 
in trying to affect our election, they 
are just ignorant. You know, there is 
no harm, we are all ignorant of some 
things, but they are ignorant of the 
facts. 
We can start with the op-ed that the 
Ambassador from Ukraine wrote before 
the 
election, 
trashing 
President 
Trump. That is trying to affect our 
election by a Ukrainian, and we know 
it had to go a lot deeper than that. 
I would love to see some of these 
folks who want to come after President 
Trump and come after those of us who 
would like free and fair elections, I 
would like to see them be more fair on 
both sides of the aisle, as far as where 
crimes have really been committed. 
If we are going to preserve this little 
experiment in self-government, there 
needs to be multiple people go to jail 
for the crimes they have committed. If 
that doesn’t happen, we are in big trou-
ble. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

IN 
HONOR 
OF 
JOHN 
MCCAULEY 
UPON BEING AWARDED THE 2020 
REALTOR CUP 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate John McCauley for 
receiving the prestigious 2020 Realtor Cup 
award from the Greater Fayetteville Chamber 
of Commerce. 
A native of Fayetteville, John founded High-
land Paving Co. in 2002 and has since trans-
formed it into a regional firm with over 200 
employees. He is also the Founding Director 
of what is now Select Bank and Trust, which 
serves twelve cities and holds assets of over 
$1 billion. 
John is known throughout our community for 
his natural talent and innovation. An effica-
cious leader, he has stimulated unprecedented 
civic growth for both Fayetteville and sur-
rounding communities. John served four years 
on the Southeastern Economic Development 
Commission, is a member of the North Caro-
lina State Bar Ethics Committee, and serves 
on the Board of Directors for the Greater Fay-
etteville Chamber of Commerce. 
A former Assistant District Attorney, John 
founded and serves as President of Vision 
2026 to promote economic development 
throughout our community. Dedicated not only 
to processional excellence, he twice served as 
Deacon at First Presbyterian Church and 
raised over $2 million through stewardship 
campaigns. 
Fayetteville is a better place today because 
of John and today I join our community in of-
fering my most heartfelt appreciation. He is 
deserving of this honor and I wish him contin-
ued success as he continues to serve Cum-
berland County and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating 
John 
McCauley 
for 
being 
awarded the 2020 Realtor Cup.

THANKING KRISTEN AND TRAVIS 
COWAN FOR RAISING ORGAN DO-
NATION AWARENESS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Kristen and Travis Cowan of 
Katy, TX for their work turning a family tragedy 
into life-giving acts: promoting organ donation. 
Two years ago, the Cowans lived every par-
ent’s nightmare when their 13-month-old son 
Rylen passed away from bacterial meningitis. 
Kristen and Travis lost a son and their six- 
year-old son Corbyn lost his brother. In the 
face of this devastating loss, the Cowans 
chose to save lives by donating Rylen’s or-
gans. 
This decision could not have been an easy 
one but doing so saved the lives of five oth-
ers. The Cowans then began the Smilin’ Rylen 
Foundation in honor of their son, a charity that 
helps raise funds for organ donation-centered 
charities and increases awareness of lives that 
are saved through organ donation. 
Recently, the Cowans were flown out to 
California for the Rose Bowl Parade by the 
nonprofit LifeGift, one of their charity’s bene-
ficiaries and the organization that procured 
Rylen’s life-saving organs. Travis and Kristen 
walked with LifeGift’s float in the parade, 
which was themed ‘‘A Light in the Dark’’ and 
bore Rylen’s picture. 
Organ donation is a selfless act that, in 
death, gives others the gift of a longer life. On 
behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional 
District of Texas, I thank Kristen and Travis for 
their work to raise awareness of the selfless 
act of organ donation. My deepest apprecia-
tion to Rylen for his inspiration and the gift of 
life he gave others that ensures his memory 
lives on.

HONORING TERRY DECARLO FOR 
HIS SERVICE TO THE CENTRAL 
FLORIDA LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life and service of Terry 
DeCarlo. 
Born 
on 
March 
19, 
1962 
in 
Bethpage, N.Y. to Mario and Anne (Puglisi) 
Nunziato, Mr. DeCarlo served in the Air Force 
from 1980 to 1983. Even before moving to 
Florida in 1996, Mr. DeCarlo was an early ad-
vocate for persons with H.I.V. From 2006 to 
2014, he was the development director for the 
Broward House, a nonprofit social services or-
ganization for people living with HIV and other 
chronic health issues. 
In 2014, Mr. DeCarlo joined the staff as ex-
ecutive director of the Center, a non-profit 
community service organization empowering 
the LGBTQ+ community in Central Florida. As 
executive director on June 12, 2016, he be-
came a constant source of comfort and 
strength for the survivors, families of victims, 
and the entire Central Florida community fol-
lowing the Pulse Nightclub tragedy. The Cen-
ter was open and prepared with grief coun-
selors within hours of the attack. Even after 
his health began to deteriorate due to stress, 
Terry continued to serve as executive director 
of the Center until July 2017. 
In addition to his husband, Bill Huelson, 
Terry is survived by his mother, Anne 
Fabrikant; his sisters, Mary Detto and Deborah 
Waters; and his brother, John Nunziato. His 
work in the aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub 
tragedy will never be forgotten. He was a pillar 
of the Central Florida community and dedi-
cated champion of LGBTQ+ rights. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DERRICK LAMAR RICHARDSON 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Mr. Derrick Lamar Rich-
ardson, an intelligent, kind, hard-working man 
of faith and determination, who passed away 
on February 14, 2020. Derrick joined our staff 
as district press secretary for Alabama’s 7th 
Congressional District in Janua1y of 2016 and 
served his home district with distinction until 
August of 2017. 
Born on October 31, 1972 to Lovenia Rich-
ardson in Birmingham, Alabama, Derrick pro-
fessed his love for Christ at an early age. For 
many years, Derrick attended Maple Grove 
Church of God with his grandmother, Ada 
Ford, and it was there that he was granted his 
deep and abiding faith. Throughout his life, 
Derrick’s faith served as a foundational pillar 
of strength, guidance and wisdom, giving Der-
rick the courage to face whatever challenges 
crossed his path. 
Derrick received his education in the Bir-
mingham 
City 
School 
System, 
attending 
Hillman Elementary School and matriculating 
from Parker High School in 1991. As a high 
school student, Derrick was an active partici-
pant in the Marching Thundering Herd Band, 
where he played the tuba. 
During his junior year at Parker High 
School, Derrick’s devotion to his country com-
pelled him to enlist in the Army National 
Guard and Reserves. Before his senior year of 
high school, Derrick attended boot camp at 
Fort McClellan in Anniston, Alabama, and 
upon graduation, went on to attend the Army 
Communications School at Fort Gordon in Au-
gusta, Georgia. During his military service, 
Derrick served as a Legal Support Specialist 
in the 167th COSCOM (Headquarters Co.): 
JAG Corp. in Ft. Clayton, Panama, the 81st 
Regional Support Command: JAG Corp. in 
Homewood, Alabama and the 131st Signal 
Battalion (Headquarters Co.): Signal Corp. in 
Birmingham, Alabama. Derrick received two 
Meritorious Service Citations for Outstanding 
Performance and an honorable discharge. 
After his military service in 1995, Derrick en-
rolled at Jacksonville State University, where 
he soon became involved in the Student Gov-
ernment Association and the National Pan- 
Hellenic Council. At Jacksonville State Univer-
sity, Derrick became a member of his beloved 
fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., a 
brotherhood and network that would serve him 
as an invaluable support system for many 
years to come. At Jacksonville State Univer-
sity, Derrick also had an opportunity to pursue 
his passion for politics. In 1999, he graduated 
with a bachelor’s degree in political science; 
and after graduation went on to attend Long 
Island University, where he graduated Cum 
Laude with a master’s degree in Urban Policy.

February 26, 2020 
Professionally, Derrick continued to pursue 
his passion for politics, working up and down 
the east coast, from Alabama to Maryland to 
New York to Washington, D.C. He worked 
across the political spectrum, for campaigns, 
as a lobbyist and in this Congressional office. 
Derrick’s impressive resume includes: co- 
founding the lobbying firm Epps, Richardson 
and Associates; serving as the first African 
American Director of Public Policy for the Bir-
mingham Chamber of Commerce; serving as 
the Senior Director for State and Regional af-
fairs for the Center for American Progress in 
Washington, D.C.; serving as the Legislative 
Budget Director for the New York City Council; 
serving as the Director of Domestic Policy for 
the Lutheran Church in America; and serving 
as the Manager of Government Relations for 
Van Scoyoc Associates in Washington, D.C. 
Derrick joined our office in 2016 and served 
as District Press Secretary, devoting his con-
siderable talents to addressing the challenges 
faced by Alabama’s 7th Congressional District 
of Alabama, including unemployment, career 
and college readiness, economic viability and 
civil rights. 
Derrick then became the inaugural Execu-
tive Director of the Alabama Alliance of the 
Boys and Girls Club. There, he brought his 
same fierce commitment to justice and equal 
opportunity, lending his ample professional ex-
perience to expanding and uplifting the work 
of the Boys and Girls Club. 
Over the years, Derrick’s many accomplish-
ments have been recognized with numerous 
awards, including: The Veteran of Influence 
Award from the Birmingham Business Journal; 
the Maryland Gubernatorial Proclamation for 
Outstanding Public Service; and the Alabama 
Legislative Black Caucus Award for Trailblazer 
and Successful Lobbyist. 
Derrick leaves behind his mother, Lovenia 
Hart, his wife, State Representative Merika 
Coleman; his children, Jonathan, Dara Elisa, 
Elexia and Xaviar; his brothers, Everett How-
ard and Gerald (Grace) Richardson; a very 
devoted cousin/little brother, Tionne Birdsong; 
three nieces; two nephews; one very devoted 
sister/cousin, Barbara Birdsong; and a host of 
cousins, friends, frat brothers and church fam-
ily. On a personal note, Derrick was a beloved 
member of our congressional staff. I was hon-
ored that Derrick joined us on our journey to 
move Alabama’s 7th District forward. He was 
an outstanding press secretary who used his 
talents and strong work ethic to passionately 
advocate for the people of his home district. I 
am forever grateful that Derrick played such a 
special role in our journey. We will certainly 
miss his kindness, his gentle spirit, his sharp 
wit and his compassionate heart; but we know 
that Derrick’s legacy will live on through the 
many lives he has impacted. May we honor 
Derrick’s life by recommitting ourselves to the 
causes he cared about and the community he 
loved so much. Rest in peace, Derrick. Always 
Team Sewell. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Alabama’s 
7th Congressional District, I ask you and my 
colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the 
exemplary life of Derrick Lamar Richardson, a 
true servant leader who led by example.

HONOR 
OF 
GEORGE 
WASH-
INGTON PERRY’S 100TH BIRTH-
DAY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. George Washington Perry and 
wish him a very happy 100th birthday. 
The advent of World War II was a time that 
not only shaped the course of our country but 
the lives of many Americans, including Mr. 
Perry. He was one of the many patriots who 
felt compelled to serve our great country and 
enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1939 before 
joining the Air National Guard and later the 
U.S. Air Force. 
For over a quarter century, Mr. Perry as-
sisted in various campaigns throughout the 
continental United States, Germany, France, 
Italy, and even Antarctica. He showed endless 
bravery and courage in his pursuit of peace 
across the globe. 
After completing active duty, he returned to 
his wife Dorothy and son Richard and began 
a successful career in engineering with Can-
non Mills. Mr. Perry remained an active com-
munity leader and has been involved in the 
Masonic Brotherhood, St. John’s Reformed 
Church, and Boy Scouts of America. 
Mr. Perry was born on February 22, 1920 
and represents the best our nation has to 
offer. I am proud to join our community today 
in honoring all that he has accomplished over 
the last 100 years. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
thanking Mr. George Washington Perry for his 
service and wishing him a happy 100th 
birthday.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF FIONA 
HECKSCHER 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
offer my condolences to the family and friends 
of Fiona Heckscher, a valued member of the 
Office of House Legislative Counsel, who we 
lost over the February recess. At just 33 years 
of age, Fiona was one of only four members 
of the prestigious tax drafting team; her skilled 
draftsmanship can be seen throughout the tax 
code. From her work on the TCJA, to her work 
on important initiatives in the 116th Congress 
such as the Economic Mobility Act, the Lower 
Drug Costs Now Act, and the Protecting 
American Lungs Act, the knowledge and cre-
ativity that Fiona brought to the tax drafting 
process has left a lasting impact on our na-
tion’s laws. 
A graduate of Brown University and the 
Yale School of Law, Fiona began with the Of-
fice of House Legislative Counsel in 2014. 
Since that time, Members and staff alike had 
come to rely on Fiona’s wisdom beyond her 
years, the depth of her knowledge of the tax 
code, and the patience and warmth she ex-
uded day in and day out, no matter how 
stressful the job got. 
Fiona was an institutionalist and deeply be-
lieved in the worth of the non-partisan work 
done by the Office of the Legislative Counsel: 
for the members, their staff and most of all for 
the American people. She often said that she 
felt lucky to be doing work that could further 
bipartisan collaboration. Fiona will be remem-
bered for her dedication to the Congress, for 
the passion she showed for her work, and for 
the kindness with which she treated others. 
Fiona and her fiance´ Neal Desai had sched-
uled their marriage to take place when Con-
gress would be in recess for the 2020 elec-
tion. Her parents, Lavinia Hall and Charles 
Heckscher, her brothers Alexander and Dylan, 
and her fiance´ Neal mourn the loss of her light 
in their lives. 
I send my deepest sympathies out to them, 
and to all of Fiona’s close friends and col-
leagues, and I ask my colleagues to do the 
same. Please know that Fiona’s good work 
has left a meaningful and lasting mark on the 
Congress, and on the country.

REMEMBERING THE KHOJALY 
TRAGEDY 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 
613 Azerbaijani men, women, and children 
killed in Khojaly on February 25 and 26, 1992. 
We must never forget this tragedy and must 
work to prevent such atrocities from occurring 
again. 
Since the early 1990s, Azerbaijan has been 
involved in a conflict with its neighbor to the 
West, Armenia. The Khojaly tragedy was the 
single worst day in this conflict, resulting in 
hundreds of lives lost, families devastated, 
and the town destroyed. A cease-fire to the 
conflict was negotiated in 1994, but the con-
flict remains unresolved. 
The U.S. and Azerbaijan established diplo-
matic relations in 1992, the same year as the 
Khojaly tragedy. Since then, Azerbaijan has 
been a key partner in the War on Terror, and 
the two nations share a Trade Relations 
Agreement and a Bilateral Investment Treaty. 
Given our deepening ties with Azerbaijan, it is 
important for the United States to support a 
peaceful settlement to the Azerbaijani-Arme-
nian conflict. 
The anniversary of this tragedy is an appro-
priate time to honor the victims of these atroc-
ities and reflect on the need for all parties to 
work together to bring a swift end to this con-
flict. I urge my colleagues to join me in stand-
ing with Azerbaijanis as they commemorate 
this tragedy.

members who fought and won this key battle, 
many laying down their lives in service to our 
nation. The Battle of Iwo Jima marked a deci-
sive American victory and signaled the begin-
ning of the end of the war in the Pacific. 
On February 19, 1945, the United States 
Marines Corps began the invasion of the 
heavily fortified island of Iwo Jima. The ensu-
ing battle for the strategic island would be one 
of the fiercest conflicts of the Second World 
War. Before the Battle of Iwo Jima ended, al-
most 7,000 American service members were 
killed, including three of the Marines that 
raised the American flag at Iwo Jima. 
One day into the Battle for Iwo Jima, four 
Marine squads began their assault on Mount 
Suribachi, the 550-foot-high peak overlooking 
the island. After a three-day onslaught, our 
troops reached the top and defeated the last 
remaining Japanese defenders. At 10:20 a.m. 
on February 23, 1945, the 3rd Platoon, E 
Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Regiment, 5th 
Marine Division were the first group of Ameri-
cans during World War II to raise the Amer-
ican flag on Japanese soil. This was a defin-
ing moment of the Second World War. 
Four hours after the first flag was raised, 
Corporal Harlon Block, Sergeant Michael 
Strank, Corporal Harold ‘‘Pie’’ Keller, Corporal 
Ira Hayes, Private First-Class Franklin Runyon 
Sousley, 
and 
Private 
First-Class 
Harold 
Schultz defiantly raised a second, larger 
American flag atop the mountain. Corporal 
Block guided the base of the pole into the vol-
canic ash while the others raised the flag up-
ward. The iconic photograph of the Marines 
raising our flag at Iwo Jima is a testament to 
American strength and sacrifice. 
I encourage my colleagues and all Ameri-
cans to take a moment today to remember 
those who have sacrificed to protect our coun-
try and our way of life. We are all forever in-
debted to these brave service members, and 
on this day, we must reiterate our promise that 
we will never forget our nation’s heroes.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEG-
ACY OF COLONEL WALTER P. 
BETLEY 
HON. STEVE STIVERS 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of the people of Ohio’s 15th Con-
gressional District to recognize the life and 
legacy of Colonel Walter P. Betley, a true 
American hero. 
Colonel Betley made a mark in our commu-
nity in many ways, most notably, by commit-
ting twenty-eight years of service with the 
United States Army Corps of Engineers. 
Through tours of duty in World War II, the Ko-
rean and Vietnam Wars, Colonel Betley 
earned not one, but two, of our nation’s high-
est honors: Bronze Stars, for his achieve-
ments. 
Following his time in the Armed Forces, 
Colonel Betley continued his career of service, 
empowering the next generation by teaching 
vocational skills at the Eastland Career Center 
in Groveport, Ohio, where he worked for over 
two decades. 
A man of many talents, Colonel Betley went 
on to found the Woodworkers of Central Ohio 
and the Central Ohio Woodturners, and self- 
published his autobiography, From Cold Water 
Flat to Colonel. 
But most importantly, Colonel Betley is 
known to many for going above and beyond 
his call of duty. His granddaughter remembers 
Colonel Betley as ‘‘truly one ofthe good guys.’’ 
Let there be no doubt about his unwavering 
devotion to our nation and the positive impact 
he had on all whose lives he touched. Like a 
pebble dropped in a pond, the ripples created 
by Colonel Betley’s life are far-reaching, but 
his legacy will live on in the memories of those 
who knew him and loved him. 
Central Ohio is undeniably a better place 
because of Colonel Walter Betley and the tre-
mendous life of service he lived, and I am 
honored to celebrate his legacy.

BEING 
NAMED THE 2020 DIRECTOR OF 
THE 
YEAR 
BY 
THE 
FEDERAL 
LABORATORY CONSORTIUM 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Argonne National Laboratory’s 
Paul K. Kearns on being named the 2020 Di-
rector of the Year by the Federal Laboratory 
Consortium. The Federal Laboratory Consor-
tium Awards are prestigious honors awarded 
by a panel of experts from laboratories, indus-
try, government, and academia. 
Since becoming Argonne’s lab director in 
November of 2017, Paul Kearns has main-
tained the laboratory’s core values. Among the 
many accomplishments made during his ten-
ure, the nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode has 
seen extraordinary success and is now used 
in many of today’s electric vehicles. Argonne 
has also increased its partnerships with the 
entrepreneurial community and is aggressively 
expanding 
its 
collaboration 
initiatives. 
Throughout his tenure, Paul’s passion for 
community outreach and building the next 
generation of STEM professionals has been 
clear. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Paul Kearns for his out-
standing contributions to the science and tech-
nology industry and inspire the future genera-
tion of STEM professionals.

REMEMBERING THE KHOJALY 
MASSACRE 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the tragic deaths of over 600 Az-
erbaijani civilians that took place in Khojaly on 
February 26, 1992. On that heinous day, Ar-
menian and Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS) forces massacred 613 civilians. 
Innocent women, children and elderly men 
were brutally killed over the course of 22 
hours. 
Azerbaijan has been healing over the 28 
years since this horrendous event, working 
hard to become a successful nation with a 
booming economy. They are a reliable friend 
and trade partner to the United States and our 
ally Israel in a geopolitical region rocked by 
turmoil and turbulence. 
We must stand by our allies and friends in 
condemning attacks like this—past, present 
and future. Atrocities such as this have no 
place in our world. I urge my colleagues to 
join me and all of our Azerbaijani friends in re-
membering the lives lost during the Khojaly 
massacre.

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE SUMGAIT 
POGROM 
AND 
KHOJALY 
MAS-
SACRE 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
mark two painful anniversaries this week in 
the decades-long conflict over the territory of 
Nagorno Karabakh. Although separated by 
four years and 200 miles, the Sumgait Pogrom 
in 1988 and Khojaly Massacre in 1992 both 
demonstrated the heinous potential of inter-
ethnic hatreds to tear apart communities and 
trample human dignity. The commemoration of 
these horrific events is an opportunity to re-
flect on the innocent lives lost in this ongoing 
conflict as well as a chance to affirm the need 
for urgent steps to heal these wounds and find 
peace for all those afflicted once and for all. 
The Sumgait Pogrom occurred in the early 
days of the conflict between ethnic Armenians 
and Azeris over the semi-autonomous Soviet 
oblast of Nagorno Karabakh. At the time, the 
Armenian-majority region was self-governing 
but ensconced in the Azerbaijan Soviet Social-
ist Republic. In 1988, a mass Armenian polit-
ical movement sought to capitalize on admin-
istrative reforms in the Soviet Union to unite 
the territory with the Armenian state. This self- 
determination campaign quickly unmasked 
mutual suspicions and interethnic resentments 
that degenerated into violence. 
Azeri counter-protests emerged in Baku in 
early February 1988 as ethnic tensions in 
Nagorno Karabakh intensified. Later that 
month, the reported murder of ethnic Azeris in 
Nagorno Karabakh lit a tinderbox of tensions 
that had built up in the town of Sumgait, 20 
miles northwest of Baku. Gangs broke off from 
an Azeri rally in town and began looting, beat-
ing, raping, and murdering ethnic Armenians. 
Ethnic Azeris killed approximately 26 Arme-
nians and injured hundreds more in the vio-
lence. The trauma of the pogrom sparked 
fears of escalating violence and led to the first 
major wave of relocations that eventually re-
sulted in the near complete displacement of 
ethnic Armenians out of Azerbaijan and Azeris 
from Armenia. 
Reciprocal atrocities coinciding with the col-
lapse of the Soviet Union caused the outbreak 
of all-out war in the early 1990s. The Khojaly 
Massacre on February 26, 1992 is the single 
greatest loss of life in the history of the con-
flict, which continues to this day under a shaky 
ceasefire agreed in 1994. In the early morning 
hours, advancing Armenian fighters opened 
fire on a stream of mostly civilian Azeris flee-
ing the town of Khojaly in the Nagorno 
Karabakh region.

Although estimates vary, Armenian militia-
men killed several hundred Azeri civilians in 
the 
snow-covered 
woods 
of 
Nagorno 
Karabakh that morning. All told, the Nagorno 
Karabakh War claimed approximately 20,000 
lives and displaced more than a million people 
in both directions. 
Madam Speaker, as Chairman of the U.S. 
Helsinki Commission, I am deeply familiar with 
the efforts that the United States, in partner-
ship with the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, has made over the 
past quarter-century to resolve this conflict. 
The United States is a co-chair alongside 
France and Russia in the trilateral Minsk 
Group process the OSCE established in the 
late 1990s to facilitate de-escalation and 
peace talks between the sides. This process 
has largely succeeded in keeping all-out war 
at bay for more than 20 years, but the Arme-
nian and Azerbaijani sides bear responsibility 
for advancing the cause of peace, including by 
preparing their populations for a lasting resolu-
tion. 
I am encouraged by the significant decrease 
in ceasefire violations over the past couple of 
years as well as the steady pace of high-level 
encounters between Armenian and Azerbaijani 
leaders during this period. Yet no meaningful 
progress has been made in these talks. More-
over, the Armenian Prime Minister and Azer-
baijani President punctuate their private dis-
cussions with inflammatory public statements 
that often distort the historical record and 
damage the cause of peace. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage the 
political leadership in Yerevan and Baku to 
use 
these 
solemn 
commemorations 
of 
Sumgait and Khojaly this week to turn a new 
page in this terrible conflict. The most fitting 
way to honor the lives of those lost would be 
through words of reconciliation and steps to-
ward peace. Together, the peoples of Armenia 
and Azerbaijan can ensure such atrocities are 
never repeated and that future generations will 
know a life of secure and prosperous coexist-
ence.

HONORING THE LEMONT POLISH 
CLUB AND ST. JOHN PAUL II 
POLISH SCHOOL ON THEIR 40TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
AND 
THE 
POLANIE 
DANCE 
GROUP 
ON 
THEIR 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Lemont Polish Club, St. John 
Paul II Polish School and the Polanie Dance 
Group from Lemont, Illinois. This year the 
Lemont Polish Club and Polish School will cel-
ebrate their 40th Anniversary, while the 
Polanie dance group will celebrate its 20th an-
niversary. 
Founded in 1980 by Father Edward Witusik, 
the Lemont Polish Club has upheld the tradi-
tions, customs, and language of our Polish 
heritage, and united the Polish community 
through our Catholic roots. Shortly after its 
creation, the Lemont Polish Club founded the 
St. John Paul II Polish School. The St. John 
Paul II Polish School serves the people of Pol-
ish heritage of Lemont by offering kindergarten 
through high school students the opportunity 
to connect with and explore their Polish herit-
age. For forty years the school has excelled in 
teaching its students Polish language, history, 
and culture. Thousands of children have 
learned about Polish cultural heritage as well 
as the role Poles play in the United States and 
the world now and into the future. With its em-
phasis on civic responsibility, the school pro-
duces students dedicated to supporting and 
improving Chicago’s communities, and I am 
proud to have it in my district. 
The school has seen tremendous growth 
since its founding. Starting with just 41 stu-
dents in 1980, enrollment in the Polish school 
has increased to over 800 students. As St. 
John Paul II Polish School has grown, they 
have been able offer more opportunities for 
their students to learn about and enjoy Polish 
culture. In 2000, the Polish School created the 
Polish Dance Group Polanie. The student 
dancers dress in traditional Polish costumes 
and perform traditional Polish dances at com-
petitions and festivals across the United 
States and Europe. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the Lemont Polish Club, St. 
John Paul II Polish School and the Polanie 
Dance Group on their anniversaries and con-
gratulating them on their many accomplish-
ments. May the Lemont Polish Club and Pol-
ish School continue their great work in the 
community, and I wish them the best as they 
continue to preserve their traditions for gen-
erations to come.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
DEPUTY KEN MIZE 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Deputy Roger Kenneth 
‘‘Ken’’ Mize for his over five decades of serv-
ice to the people of northeast Georgia. 
Deputy Mize of the Banks County Sheriff’s 
Office retired on January 30, 2020, after serv-
ing in law enforcement for 52 years. Mr. Mize, 
who is best known for his integrity, his ‘‘serv-
ant heart’’ and the smile on his face, dedi-
cated his career to protecting our communities 
and educating our students. 
For over 26 years, Mr. Mize served as a 
role model and mentor for students in the 
Banks County School System. By working with 
the 
Drug 
Abuse 
Resistance 
Education 
(D.A.R.E.) and Choosing Healthy Activities 
and Methods Promoting Safety (C.H.A.M.P.S) 
programs, Mr. Mize furthered safety aware-
ness in over 30,000 fifth-grade students 
across Banks and Jackson counties. 
Throughout the community, Mr. Mize was 
known as a role model who always had a 
calming effect as he walked the school halls, 
attended board of education meetings, and 
participated in other school events. His service 
inspired members of his community to become 
involved and work to change the lives of stu-
dents. 
From his work as a first responder to his 
dedication to students, Deputy Mize has com-
mitted his career to transforming lives and pro-
tecting our communities. I join the people of 
northeast Georgia in thanking him for his over 
five decades of service, and I wish him and 
his beloved wife, Kathy, all the best in his next 
chapter of life.

IN HONOR OF MRS. IRENE 
MORGAN 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Irene Morgan who was 
among the first warriors on the frontline of the 
Civil Rights Movement. Although her valiant 
story is unknown to many, I applaud the Vir-
ginia Department of Historical Resources for 
issuing a new state historical marker for her in 
Gloucester County in my district. 
Irene’s incredible story highlights the social 
hardships that African Americans faced in the 
U.S. In 1944, while returning home to Balti-
more on a bus after visiting her mother in 
Gloucester, the bus driver ordered her to relin-
quish her seat to a white passenger. She re-
fused. Consequently, Middlesex County sher-
iffs arrested her, and the State convicted her. 
It was from this point that Irene took imme-
diate action. With the help of the NAACP, her 
case was heard by the Supreme Court. Then, 
in 1946, defended by Thurgood Marshall and 
Spottswood W. Robinson, III; Irene won her 
Supreme Court case, Morgan v. Virginia. Her 
case made it unconstitutional to enforce seg-
regation laws on interstate carriers. This land-
mark case set the stage for years of civil ac-
tion against draconian laws that discriminated 
against our own citizens. 
On behalf of Virginia’s First District, it is my 
pleasure to honor Irene. All Virginians and 
those of Virginia’s First District, should take 
the opportunity to learn about Irene and her 
act of courage. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
and my colleagues join me in honoring Irene 
and her family for their contribution to our na-
tion’s history and the African American Com-
munity. I also want to thank the Virginia De-
partment of Historical Resources for issuing a 
new marker for her, memorializing her story. 
On behalf of Virginia’s First District we say 
thank you.

RECOGNIZING THE 28TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF KHOJALY TRAGEDY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to bring our attention to the 28th Anniversary 
of what is known as the Khojaly Tragedy. 
Years ago, as the Soviet Union fell under the 
weight of socialism, and the despair and mal-
aise created by socialism finally became too 
much to bear, many of the former Soviet sat-

relative prosperity. Its petroleum resources are 
world renown, as is its hard-working citizens. 
The re-birth of this nation was not without its 
struggle. As the existing Soviet political regime 
broke down in 1991, ethnic and historical rival-
ries surfaced. Problems with neighboring Ar-
menia resulted in conflict and death, and the 
Nagomo-Karabakh conflict erupted. 
Out of that conflict, one notable tragic inci-
dent occurred 26 years ago, where the Azeris 
were subjected to reported indiscriminate 
shelling and targeting of the people of Khojaly 
at the hands of Karabakh Armenian and Ar-
menian forces. It has been reported that up to 
613 civilians died on February 26, 1992 as a 
result of the attack. 
We cannot change what happened, but we 
can remember the victims and remind the 
world that the targeting of civilians is never ac-
ceptable. 
The United States is proud to serve as a co- 
chair of the OSCE Minsk Group and we will 
continue to push for a peaceful resolution to 
this conflict, one that will honor the memory of 
the Khojaly people so that their families and 
countrymen may never suffer the same fate, 
nor anyone else in the world. 
We in the United States cherish our strong 
bilateral relationship with Azerbaijan. I am very 
optimistic about what our countries can 
achieve not just for the Azeris and my fellow 
countrymen, but for the development of the 
Caucuses as a whole, allowing the world to 
understand its potential alongside its rich cul-
ture and history. 
I am honored to recognize the Khojaly vic-
tims, and we will continue to keep them in our 
hearts and minds as we foster a strong work-
ing relationship between our two countries and 
promote a peaceful and fair resolution to this 
conflict. For Azerbaijan, and for Armenia, 
peaceful and neighborly relations will result in 
better prosperity for all of us.

HONORING KERRY THOMAS 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Mr. Kerry Thomas, Chief of 
Police for the city of Chamblee. A self-de-
scribed ‘‘forward thinker,’’ Chief Thomas has 
served as Chief of Police now for a little over 
three months. This weekend, citizens in 
Chamblee will honor Chief Thomas for his 
service as the city’s first African American po-
lice chief. 
Chief Thomas joined the Chamblee Police 
Department last November after over 30 years 
of service to the Savannah Police Department. 
During his career in Savannah, his work expe-
rience spanned from a Patrol Officer, Forensic 
Examiner, Captain, and Assistant Chief of Po-
lice. His appointment as Chief was rec-
ommended by Chamblee City Manager Jon 
Walker and confirmed by Mayor Eric Clarkson 
and the Chamblee City Council. He was se-
lected out of an application pool of 48 can-
didates from across Georgia and beyond. Ac-
cording to Mr. Walker, Chief Thomas ‘‘ex-
pressed a great depth of knowledge and of-
fered a methodical and results oriented ap-
proach to policing.’’ 
Prior to his service in the police force, Chief 
Thomas proudly served in the United States 
Army as an Armor Crewman Specialist from 
1984 until 1987. During his time in the Army, 
Chief Thomas deployed to Germany. Upon his 
honorable discharge, he transitioned into the 
Georgia Army National Guard, where he 
served another three years. 
It is my honor to recognize Chief Thomas 
for his service, his sacrifice, and his dedication 
to keeping the city of Chamblee safe. As we 
approach the end of Black History Month, may 
we be reminded of the enormous contributions 
that black men and women make to the 
United States every day. On behalf of myself, 
the Sixth Congressional District of Georgia, 
and the United States House of Representa-
tives, I am proud to join the city of Chamblee 
in honoring Chief Kerry Thomas.

KLINK FAMILY CONTINUES TO AD-
VOCATE 
FOR 
WOMEN 
CANCER 
PATIENTS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize sisters Sasha and Francesca 
Klink and their mother Irma Klink, for their tre-
mendous effort to help women going through 
cancer treatment feel their best. 
Cancer is a disease that affects people of 
all walks of life, regardless of race or eco-
nomic status. Sasha and her mother Irma are 
both breast cancer survivors. The Klinks 
opened their Sugar Land, TX beauty boutique, 
Cure & Co., and spa Pop & Pigment in 2013 
to bring positive distractions to other women 
going through cancer treatment. 
By providing beauty products, wigs, head 
coverings and spa treatments to cancer pa-
tients, the Klinks have helped many women 
feel beautiful and confident during their jour-
neys to wellness. 
Sasha, Francesca and Irma all understand 
the toll that cancer affects patients and their 
families, as well as the fear, uncertainty and 
frustration it brings. Their valuable work eases 
the pain of patients, helps heal the hurt of 
their families and inspires others to assist 
those in need. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I thank Francesca, 
Sasha and Irma for their dedication to helping 
the women of TX–22 on their journey to beat 
breast cancer.

REMEMBERING MEMPHIS LAWYER 
JAMES S. GILLILAND 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of Memphis lawyer, pub-
lic citizen and community leader James S. 
Gilliland, who passed away Monday at 86. Jim 
was one of the great lawyers of Memphis with 
a sterling national reputation, having received 
every award for his phenomenal profes-
sionalism and active role in community affairs 
throughout his career. That included the 2018 
‘‘Pillars of Excellence’’ Award from the Univer-
sity of Memphis School of Law. Well re-
spected in his hometown, Jim’s service in 
Washington, as general counsel to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture during the Clinton Adminis-
tration, added to his prestige. 
Jim was born in Memphis and graduated 
from my alma mater, Vanderbilt University, 
and its law school, being named the Most Out-
standing of the Law Class of 1957. After pass-
ing the bar, he served as a full-time pros-
ecutor in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific and Far 
East, after which he returned home to join the 
then seven-lawyer firm now known as Glankler 
Brown PLLC. He became a partner and re-
mained with the firm for 30 years. By 1964, he 
had met and married Lucia Flowers and the 
couple had three fine children—Katherine, 
Elizabeth and James Jr.—who continue to re-
flect their parents’ spirit of community involve-
ment. 
Jim’s civic commitment was seen in his 
service chairing the Liberty Bowl, the Memphis 
Cotton Carnival, the Memphis Arts Council 
and LeMoyne-Owen College boards of direc-
tors. Jim also oversaw the Memphis Mayoral 
Transition Team for our city’s first African 
American Mayor, Willie Herenton. He received 
the Memphis Bar’s Sam A. Myar, Jr. Award as 
the most outstanding young lawyer in 1972. In 
1995, baseball champion Hank Aaron pre-
sented him with the United Negro College 
Fund’s ‘‘Beacon of Hope’’ Award for his work 
supporting minority education. He was a close 
friend and counsel to Al Gore throughout his 
political career. 
In 1993, President Clinton nominated Jim 
for the general counsel post at the Department 
of Agriculture and he was confirmed by the 
Senate. There he managed a legal staff of 
200 lawyers in 23 regional offices around the 
country, dealing with the legal issues involved 
in agricultural production, international trade, 
food policy, the interests of the forestry indus-
try and rural small towns. 
Returning to Memphis after his federal serv-
ice, Jim became involved in local and national 
boards, including serving as chair of the Amer-
ican Battlefield Trust, the private partner of the 
National Park Service focused on preserving 
American battlefields. Jim was always sup-
portive of me and other public servants and he 
and Lucia helped make Memphis a more toler-
ant and inclusive community. 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to Lucia, 
his wife of 55 years, and his children, his 
grandchildren, his colleagues and his many 
friends. His was a life well-lived.

Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to

the national American Legion Auxiliary and the 
special one hundredth anniversary celebration 
being held by the Corning American Legion

War I. It was decided that a new women’s or-

tied to the Legion, Since the Auxiliary was 
founded, their goal has been to serve veterans 
and their families—a goal at which they have 
succeeded at time and time again. Even one 
hundred years later, the women of the Auxil-
iary continue on in their quest to help as many 
veterans as possible—and for that, we are 
deeply thankful. 
The one hundredth anniversary held by the 
Corning American Legion Auxiliary Unit No. 
746 will include remarks from several local 
and national officials. The Corning unit has 
been in operation since May 13, 1929 and will 
soon be celebrating ninety-one years of help-
ing veterans. 
Currently, the national American Legion 
Auxiliary has more than six hundred thousand 
members across the country who volunteer 
countless hours of their time and effort to per-
form various services. The Auxiliary has also 
stood with the American Legion to advocate 
for various issues such as veterans’ rights, en-
hancing United States Department of Veterans 
Affairs benefits and ending homelessness 
among veterans. 
This organization has always and will con-
tinue to serve our nation’s veterans. I thank 
them for their service, unwavering commit-
ment, and dedication to their mission. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body join me to recognize the one hundredth 
Anniversary of the American Legion Auxiliary.

TRIBUTE TO THE 2019 ELLIS IS-
LAND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPI-
ENTS 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the 2019 recipients of the 
prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor. 
Presented annually, the Ellis Island Medals 
of Honor pay tribute to our Nation’s immigrant 
heritage, as well as individual achievement. 
The Medals are awarded to U.S. citizens from 
diverse ethnic backgrounds who exemplify 
outstanding qualities in both their personal and 
professional lives, while continuing to preserve 
the richness of their particular heritage and 
culture. We honor these outstanding individ-
uals because the important work they do 
today, creates a better world for all of us to-
morrow. This momentous occasion was cele-
brated with a patriotic ceremony on Ellis Island 
and a re-commitment by the leaders of the or-
ganization to their mission of honoring diver-
sity, fostering tolerance and promoting reli-
gious and racial unity across America. 
Since the Medals’ founding, more than 
2,500 American citizens have received the 
Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including seven 
American Presidents, numerous United States 
Senators and Congressmen, two Nobel Laure-
ates, and many athletes, artists, clergy, and 
military leaders. This Medal is not about mate-
rial success, nor is it about the politics of im-
migration; it is about the people who have 
committed themselves to this nation, em-
braced the opportunities America offers, and 
most importantly, who have used those oppor-
tunities to not only better their own lives but 
make a difference in our county and in the 
lives of its people. 
Citizens of the United States hail from every 
nation known to man. The iconic metaphor of 
this nation as a veritable melting pot of cul-
tures continues to ring true, and it is this diver-
sity that adds to the unique richness of Amer-
ican life. It is the key to why America is the 
most innovative, progressive and forward- 
thinking country in the world. The Ellis Island 
Medals of Honor not only celebrate select indi-
viduals but also the pluralism and democracy 
that enabled our forbearers to celebrate their 
cultural identities while still embracing the 
American way of life. This award serves to re-
mind us all that with hard work and persever-
ance anyone can still achieve the American 
dream. In addition, by honoring these remark-
able Americans, we honor all who share their 
origins and we acknowledge the contributions 
they have made to America. I commend 
NECO and its Board of Directors headed by 
my good friend, Nasser J. Kazeminy, for hon-
oring these truly outstanding individuals for 
their tireless efforts to foster dialogue and 
build bridges between different ethnic groups, 
as well as to promote unity and a sense of 
common purpose in our nation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the good works of NECO 
and in congratulating all of the 2019 recipients 
of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. I also in-
clude in the RECORD the names of the recipi-

OBSERVING THE 27TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE KHOJALY MAS-
SACRE 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise to re-
member the victims of the Khojaly Massacre, 
and mark the 28th Anniversary of this attack. 
Azerbaijanis remember this tragedy as the 
darkest chapter in the Azerbaijan-Armenian 
conflict. 
In the fall of 1991, Armenian and Soviet 
forces surrounded the town of Khojaly in the 
region of Nagorno-Karabakh. After bom-
barding the city, these forces attacked on the 
night of February 25 and on the 26, killing 600 
innocent Azerbaijanis, including women, chil-
dren, and elderly people. Hundreds more were 
left severely disabled from the attacks. In a 
1992 report, Human Rights Watch stated that 
the attacks on fleeing civilians ‘‘deliberately 
disregarded . . . customary law restraint’’. 
The victims of Khojaly remind us of the 
value of peace. Unfortunately, the dispute over 
Nagorno-Karabakh is still ongoing, despite the 
efforts of the United States and international 
community to foster a negotiated settlement. I 
call on all parties involved to productively en-
gage with the Minsk Process to find a peace-
ful resolution to this decades old conflict. 
The horrific events in Khojaly almost three 
decades ago lead us to mourn the innocent ci-
vilians who lost their lives that day. I encour-
age my colleagues to join with me and the Az-
erbaijani people as they remember this trag-
edy.

REMEMBERING THE BAKU AND 
SUMGAIT POGROMS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 26, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the atrocities committed against 
Armenian civilians during the pogroms in 
Sumgait and Baku, Azerbaijan that took the 
lives of many innocent people. 
From February 26 to March 1 of 1988, the 
Armenian population in Sumgait was the tar-
get of a horrendous massacre. Innocent Arme-
nian civilians in this seaside town were beat-
en, raped and murdered in the streets and 
even in their own homes, simply because of 
their ethnicity. 
A similar atrocity occurred in Baku, Azer-
baijan just two years later. A seven-day mas-
sacre of Armenian civilians saw them at-
tacked, beaten and killed as perpetrators 
roamed the streets, committing arson and rob-
beries. Many Armenians were expelled from 
the city, targeted, as before, for their ethnicity.

Madam Speaker, in order to combat atroc-
ities such as these, we must first look to the 
past and ensure the victims of hate are never 
forgotten. We must educate ourselves and our 
neighbors on these events and all events like 
them to prevent further massacres in the fu-
ture. 
We have a solemn duty to remember the 
devastation the Armenian people suffered— 
and demand a world where freedom can be 
found for all people, and where events like the 
Baku and Sumgait Pogroms are relegated to 
a dark and distant past.
