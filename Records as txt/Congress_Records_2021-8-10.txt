PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, grant us wisdom this day, 
wisdom to approach our tasks, our 
daily dealings, and our lives with care 
and prudence, yielding to Your author-
ity. 
You have set before us standards and 
expectations for living according to 
Your principles. Reveal to us again our 
responsibility, in light of Your pre-
cepts, to change our self-serving ways 
and to follow paths of righteousness. 
When we are inclined to compare our-
selves with others, may we discover 
that it is in meditating on and abiding 
by Your commandments that give us 
value and purpose comparable to none. 
When we seek to grow in knowledge 
and accomplishments, may we learn 
that our wisdom and success will dis-
appoint us if we have not grounded our-
selves first in Your truth. 
May we come to delight in the reas-
surance of Your presence and in the 
protection of Your guiding hand. Allow 
us to taste the sweetness of Your prom-
ises. May Your words be like honey to 
our mouths. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

IN 
AMERICA ACT—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of H.R. 3684, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

A bill (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for 
Federal-aid highways, highway safety pro-
grams, and transit programs, and for other 
purposes. 
H.R. 3684 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
many States in the United States need 
infrastructure investment, but I would 
put the State of Washington high on 
the list of States that desperately need 
infrastructure investment. 
We have been blessed with a growing 
economy and a big trade economy 
based on the Pacific rim and the ac-
tions of the Pacific rim. So we need to 
keep moving products. We need to keep 
moving services, and we need infra-
structure investment to do so. 
I wanted to take this opportunity to 
thank the work done by the Commerce 
Committee and those who worked on 
the Infrastructure Investment Act, spe-
cifically: 
Kara 
Fischer, 
Michael 
Davisson, Joanie Lofgren, Zeb Schorr, 
Ronce Almond, Alex Simpson, G.G.

Beezer, Noam Kanter, Jordan Blue, Tif-
fany 
George, 
Lucy 
Koch, 
Hunter 
Hudspeth Blackburn, Kelly Ryan, Dave 
Stewart, Melissa Porter, and David 
Strickland. 
These are some of the individuals 
who were involved in putting together 
the commerce piece of this underlying 
bill. About 20 percent of the underlying 
bill was the focus of the Commerce 
Committee and its jurisdiction. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
WICKER and his staff for the hard work 
to pull off what was the bipartisan bill 
that came to the Senate floor as part 
of this package. 
Our legislation, I think, is a historic 
investment to rebuild our transpor-
tation infrastructure, including invest-
ments in things like megaprojects, ba-
sically helping to eliminate our prob-
lems at grade crossings, improve our 
freight network, improve our environ-
ment by removing culverts, and help-
ing Amtrak better serve the United 
States of America. 
All these were important invest-
ments, but we should look at the firsts. 
First, we are authorizing for the first 
time megaprojects. Megaprojects often 
take up so much of our budget in our 
States and federally they never get 
funded, but that doesn’t mean they 
aren’t critical to the United States. 
In the Northeast Corridor, we cer-
tainly have megaprojects. In the Pa-
cific Northwest, we have megaprojects 
that would be critical, like the Colum-
bia River Crossing between Vancouver 
and Portland, or the Highway 2 trestle 
in Everett. These projects deserve the 
attention of the Nation and, with this 
first-time authorization, will get so. 
The bill also puts a historic invest-
ment in freight and in Amtrak. As I 
mentioned, the economy of a global na-
ture is demanding that we be able to

move competitively our products. But 
if we don’t continue to invest in 
freight, we are not going to get that 
job done. So this provides $66 billion to 
improve our passenger rail and freight 
system, the single largest investment 
that we have had in our Amtrak sys-
tem that was funded 50 years ago. 
The Commerce Committee’s bill lays 
the foundation for this funding, which 
I believe will do three things. It will 
mean more investment to fix the prob-
lems in the Northeast Corridor; more 
specifically, it will give us the ability 
to have more sequencing of trains 
throughout the United States of Amer-
ica; and it will provide for new service 
in city pairs that, I hope, will help 
economies all across the United States 
with more investments. 
I know, specifically, the Senator 
from Montana, Senator TESTER, is very 
adamant about our Amtrak funding 
and the services that Montana de-
mands. I want to thank him for his 
help on this. 
I want to thank Senator DUCKWORTH 
for her hard work in making sure that 
Amtrak complies with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. This is so impor-
tant for us to do, and her language, 
making sure that we also have some-
one from the disabilities community 
on the Amtrak board, is the kind of 
thing that should be followed in other 
examples in this legislation. 
I also want to say, for the first time, 
we are addressing specifically at-grade 
crossings. This is the instance where 
there is congestion in freight, in my 
State, multiple times the increase in 
freight traffic. Again, you know, a lot 
of Midwest product moving to Asia has 
increased a demand in safety and 
transportation. Somebody quoted one 
of our reports that it took freight 3 
days to get through just the city of 
Chicago because of the amount of con-
gestion. 
Our job here is to make sure that our 
product, made and grown in the United 
States of America, gets quickly to its 
destinations or we will be outcompeted 
by other nations that have an infra-
structure system that can beat us to 
those marketplaces. So this provides, 
for the first time, a focused program on 
improving at-grade crossings to con-
tinue to make the investments that 
need to be made to keep our freight 
moving and our public safe. 
It also, for the first time, authorizes 
transportation improvements to repair 
culverts. Culverts and other transpor-
tation infrastructure have done dam-
age to our environment. They have 
done damage to fish; they have basi-
cally blocked spawning grounds. They 
have caused other infrastructure chal-
lenges to species all along our coastal 
States. This program will help to im-
prove that situation by repairing some 
of the fish passage that has been 
blocked for so many years. This is so 
important for us in the Pacific North-
west, but it is also important through-
out the South and for our many, many 
coastal communities. 
So this transportation legislation 
that went through the Commerce Com-
mittee, as I said, also, you know, 
makes other investments. This floor 
bill also makes other investments for 
bridge repair, for transit systems, for 
climate resiliency, and specifically for 
our airports. You probably haven’t 
heard too much about that out here on 
the floor, but in the Commerce Com-
mittee, I can tell you that aviation, 
transportation, 
and 
competitive—I 
know that the Presiding Officer knows 
this very well; that in Las Vegas or in 
Reno that infrastructure like our air-
ports is essential to our economy con-
tinuing to grow. SeaTac is probably 
one of the fastest growing airports in 
the United States right now, and under 
this legislation, we will also see an im-
portant improvement for our airports 
so they can continue to grow and so we 
can continue to make investments. 
I also want to, as I mentioned, thank 
Senator WICKER in the title for vehicle 
safety. These are important provisions 
that he and I and others on the com-
mittee—Senator BLUMENTHAL
for his 
work on safety legislation that related 
to both the Northeast Corridor and to 
individuals in transportation, includ-
ing, with Senator WICKER, the life-
saving technology, like an automatic 
emergency braking system, preventing 
child heat stroke deaths, and impaired 
driving faculties. 
So I again thank all of the members 
of the Commerce Committee for their 
hard work in getting this legislation as 
part of this package. 
I think we can see that we have some 
firsts 
here: 
first 
investing 
in 
megaprojects; first in cleaning up our 
environmental problems with culverts; 
getting our freight product through 
our most congested corridors with im-
proved at-grade crossing; and making 
the major investment so that Amtrak 
can continue to expand. 
So I look forward to working with 
my colleagues as we move through the 
legislative process and continue to 
make improvements in our transpor-
tation infrastructure. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
later today, Senate Democrats want to 
take their next big step toward playing 
Russian roulette with our country. 
They want to begin pushing through a 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
that was authored by our self-described 
socialist colleague, Chairman SANDERS. 
Today, the American people will learn 
exactly where each of their Senators 
stand. 
The American people elected a 50–50 
Senate, an incredibly close House of 
Representatives, and a President who 
pledged to govern down the middle and 
unify the country. But as soon as 
President Biden, Speaker PELOSI, and 
Leader SCHUMER got the keys, they 
handed them right over to the far left. 
Remember, 
Democrats 
inherited 
three safe and effective vaccines that 
were already rolling out nationwide 
and an economy that was primed to 
come roaring back, but our colleagues 
pressed ahead with a massive spring-
time spending package that even lib-
eral experts said would drive inflation, 
and, of course, it did. 
Overall inflation has risen at the 
fastest rate in nearly 13 years. Core in-
flation hit its highest level in almost 30 
years. Families are getting hit by high-
er prices everywhere, from the grocery 
store to the gas station, to their hous-
ing costs. Small businesses have had 
trouble reopening because would-be 
workers are getting a government 
bonus to actually stay home. 
So the country is still working 
through the side effects of the bor-
rowing and spending the Democrats 
forced through back in the spring, but 
Democrats don’t want to just refill 
their socialist prescription; they want 
to double the dose—double the dose. 
According to what they just released, 
Democrats want to unite behind Chair-
man SANDERS’ resolution to spend a 
staggering $4.2 trillion more. Of course, 
outside experts estimate the real cost 
will be even higher still. 
If it is even close to fully offset, as 
they claim it is, this seems almost cer-
tain to be the largest peacetime tax 
hike on record. So let that sink in—the 
largest peacetime tax hike on record. 
Even though their rough sketch of 
these tax hikes would shatter Presi-
dent Biden’s promise not to raise taxes 
on the middle class, families earning 
well 
under 
the 
President’s 
stated 
threshold would get hit and hit hard. 
This new reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree will fall like a hammer blow on 
workers 
and 
middle-class 
families: 
fewer jobs, lower wages, more inflation 
pushing costs higher and higher. 
What our colleagues are proposing 
and planning is absolutely jaw-drop-
ping. People want to pretend this is 
just business as usual, just liberals 
doing liberal things using Senate pro-
cedure. Make no mistake, this reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree is nothing 
like we have seen—nothing. 
The basic math of their taxing and 
spending is toxic enough, but the radi-
calism that we will be debating on the 
floor goes well beyond dollars and 
cents. The policies they want to put be-
hind this budget resolution read like 
somebody walked across the Rotunda 
to the House and handed the Squad a 
pen and piece of paper: sweeping— 
sweeping—amnesty for illegal immi-
grants in the middle of a border crisis, 
regulations that are so radical that our 
colleague Senator MARKEY said: 
The green new deal is in the DNA of this 
. . . budget resolution. All of the things that 
are in [this], we talked about in the green 
new deal. 
Senator MARKEY. 
They want to induce 49 other States 
to make their electric grids more like 
California’s; make it more expensive to 
mine critical minerals we need to com-
pete with China; they want to take

August 10, 2021 
working families’ child tax credit and 
turn it into a permanent welfare pro-
gram—listen to this—with no work re-
quirement; they want to tamper with 
the prescription drug industry in ways 
that would leave Americans with fewer 
new treatments and fewer new cures; 
they want to put government’s thumb 
on the scale of families’ childcare 
choices and selectively subsidize par-
ents whose households work the way 
Washington wants; and they want to 
tax more money out of Americans’ 
pockets while reviving a special tax 
cut 
that 
overwhelmingly 
benefits 
wealthy people in blue States. 
So let’s face it. The brute facts of the 
Senate’s rules mean that, if 50 Demo-
crats plus the Vice President stick to-
gether, Republicans will probably not 
be able to save our colleagues from 
themselves. If all 50 Democrats want to 
help Chairman SANDERS hurt middle- 
class families, even if our colleagues 
who claim they are moderates want to 
follow the far left off this cliff, well, 
that is their prerogative, but we are 
going to argue it out right here on the 
floor at some length. Every single Sen-
ator will be going on record over and 
over and over. 
Senate Republicans will be bringing 
forward 
commonsense 
amendments 
that represent what Americans actu-
ally want and actually need. Our col-
leagues can look forward to votes on 
national security and funding our 
Armed Forces; votes to remove back-
door tax cuts for wealthy liberals; 
votes to protect family-owned small 
businesses 
and 
family 
farms 
from 
crushing tax hikes; votes to encourage 
schools to finally reopen in person; to 
stop the catch and release of COVID- 
positive illegal immigrants coming 
into our country; to protect taxpayers 
from being forced to fund the horrors 
of abortion. And that is just a sam-
pling. Because our Democratic col-
leagues missed some deadlines, it has 
been an all-out sprint to prepare 
amendments. 
So I want to thank our nonpartisan 
Senate clerks and Parliamentarians. 
They have worked multiple weekends, 
straight through. They were kept up 
late last night processing hundreds of 
amendments, and they are going to be 
up late with all of us yet again. 
If President Biden and 50 Senate 
Democrats want to outsource domestic 
policy to Chairman SANDERS, if this 
historically reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree is how the modern Demo-
cratic Party wants to define itself, if 
they want inflation and tax hikes to be 
their legacy, then Republicans do not 
currently have the votes to spare the 
American families this nightmare, but 
we will debate and we will vote and we 
will stand up and we will be counted— 
and the people of this country will 
know exactly which Senators fought 
for them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
GUN CONTROL 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past 
Saturday, at 9 p.m., Chicago Police Of-
ficer Ella French was shot and killed 
during a traffic stop on the Chicago 
South Side. 
Her death is devastating. Officer 
French was 29 years old. She had 
served as a member of the Chicago Po-
lice Department since 2018. 
Her brother described her as the epit-
ome of a good Samaritan. A fellow offi-
cer said of her: ‘‘She truly showed the 
community that she loved them and 
would do anything for them.’’ 
Officer French’s partner was also 
shot and critically wounded. We pray 
for his recovery. 
Two men have been charged by the 
Cook County State Attorney’s Office in 
the shooting of these officers. A third 
man has been charged by the U.S. At-
torney’s Office for the Northern Dis-
trict of Illinois for conspiracy to vio-
late Federal firearms laws. 
I hope that justice is delivered swift-
ly and fairly for the perpetrators of 
this horrible crime. 
And let me be clear. As devastating 
as her death is, scores of individuals 
are shot every week in Chicago, and 
many lose their lives. For each of their 
families, the loss is just as intense as 
the loss of Officer French. 
And as heartbreaking as Officer 
French’s death is, it is also infuriating. 
We learned yesterday from the Chicago 
U.S. Attorney’s Office that the gun 
used to murder Officer French was 
straw-purchased from a gun dealer in 
Indiana. 
What is a straw purchase? It happens 
when a person who can pass a back-
ground check buys a gun and gives it 
to a person who can’t. 
Straw purchases have long been the 
way that guns have been funneled into 
the hands of those with felony convic-
tions in Chicago, then to the streets, 
then to deadly incidents. 
According to the charges filed yester-
day by the U.S. attorney, an Indiana 
man bought the handgun from a man 
in Hammond, IN, and gave to it a per-
son with a felony conviction, who al-
legedly used it this last weekend to kill 
Officer French. 
For years, I have been fighting to 
toughen our laws against straw pur-
chases. Right now, straw-purchasing is 
treated—listen to this—as a Federal 
paperwork violation for lying on a Fed-
eral gun purchase form. Charges are 
rarely brought, and when they are, the 
sentences are often just a matter of 
months. That needs to change. 
I have joined with Senator LEAHY of 
Vermont and Senator COLLINS of Maine 
to introduce the Stop Illegal Traf-
ficking in Firearms Act, a bipartisan 
bill that would make it an explicit 
Federal crime, carrying felony pen-
alties when a person straw-purchases a 
firearm. 
We need to take this type of gun traf-
ficking seriously. It is time for us to 
stop treating straw purchases like a 
paperwork misdemeanor. 
As we have learned in the death of 
Officer French, it is a deadly act and 
should be punished accordingly. 
Officer French’s death is also a call 
to action for the strike force recently 
set up by the Department of Justice to 
crack down on regional firearms traf-
ficking in Chicago. 
I met with Attorney General Garland 
in Chicago when he launched the strike 
force 2 weeks ago, and I have written 
to him now urging that the strike force 
immediately prioritize the investiga-
tion and prosecution of straw pur-
chases like the one that took the life of 
Officer French. 
The strike force was established to 
keep a sustained focus on firearms traf-
ficking in Chicago. That focus should 
include stopping straw purchases and 
holding the perpetrators accountable. 
I look forward to working with the 
Justice Department and with my col-
leagues to find ways to crack down on 
the deadly gun violence that straw pur-
chasers help to fuel. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. President, 2020 set a record for 
drug overdose deaths in America. More 
than 93,000 lives were lost in the year 
2020. In Illinois, 3,500 of our neighbors 
died of overdose, a 27-percent spike 
from the year before. 
How did we get to this point? Who is 
responsible for this? 
There is one clear culprit: the phar-
maceutical industry. For years, opioid 
manufacturers deliberately lied about 
the risks of their drugs—deliberately. 
These companies have claimed their 
pain killers should be prescribed for 
common aches and pains. They even 
downplayed their addictive nature even 
though their research showed that it 
was a very real danger. 
These companies then shipped moun-
tains of these pills to every corner of 
America. They aggressively promoted 
them to doctors, with the backing of 
dark money organizations. 
This epidemic wasn’t created by 
some infectious virus; it was created by 
corporate greed—corporate greed. In 
the words of Richard Sackler of Purdue 
Pharma, his company chose to flood 
our streets with ‘‘a blizzard of prescrip-
tions that will bury the competition.’’ 
It ended up burying the users. 
As a result, 500,000 Americans fami-
lies have had to bury loved ones who 
died of opioid overdoses and addictions 
since the start of the opioid epidemic— 
500,000 Americans, a figure in the same 
range as the 610,000 Americans we have 
lost to COVID–19. The numbers are 
numbing. 
From 2006 to 2014, drug companies 
like Purdue Pharma inundated the 
country with 100 billion pain pills—100 
billion. Let that soak in. That is 
roughly 300 opioid pills for every living 
American over that time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6196 
August 10, 2021 
They flooded communities like the 
rural county of Hardin in downstate Il-
linois. They received enough opioids in 
Hardin County for each resident to 
have a nearly 3-month supply. 
Some counties in West Virginia and 
Kentucky had twice that level of over-
supply. 
One pharma rep even bragged: ‘‘I 
don’t know how they can even house 
this many bottles.’’ 
Another wrote: 
Keep ‘em comin’! Flyin’ out of here. It’s 
like people are addicted to these things. Oh, 
wait, people are . . . 
That level of greed and disregard for 
human suffering is an outrage, and the 
companies responsible must be held ac-
countable. 
You may be asking: Why haven’t we 
done that already? 
It is a good question—because not 
only was the Federal Drug Enforce-
ment Administration aware of this ob-
scene volume of overproduction; they 
authorized it. They gave permission. 
The Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion of the U.S. Federal Government is 
responsible 
for 
determining 
the 
amount of opioid pills allowed to be 
put on the market each year. They are 
effectively the gatekeeper for these 
drug manufacturers and for years— 
years—they allowed opioid production 
quotas to keep increasing. 
Between 1993 and 2015, production of 
oxycodone 
increased 
39-fold; 
hydrocodone, 12-fold; fentanyl, 25-fold. 
In 2016, America’s pharmaceutical in-
dustry produced 14 billion opioid doses 
in 2016 alone, enough for every adult 
American to have a 3-week supply of 
opioids. 
Think about that. Authorized by the 
Federal Government, requested by the 
pharmaceutical industry, we put a 
quota 
that 
Pharma 
asked 
for 
to 
produce 14 billion opioid pills in a year, 
enough for every American to have a 3- 
week supply. 
Any wonder that we had an opioid 
epidemic? 
I pressed the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration on this issue years ago, 
when I learned of this. I asked them: 
How can you approve these ever-in-
creasing quotas. Pharma is insatiable. 
They will ask for as many pills as they 
can possibly push into the American 
people’s families, especially when DEA 
had data that showed this overproduc-
tion was fueling a deadly national drug 
crisis. 
A couple years ago I worked with my 
Republican colleague, Senator JOHN 
KENNEDY of Louisiana, to start stem-
ming the tide of addictive drugs. We 
passed a bipartisan bill that gave the 
DEA the authority they said they need-
ed to set commonsense production lev-
els. 
We changed the law so the DEA 
must—must—consider abuse, overdose 
deaths, and the public health impact 
when determining opioid quotas. 
Our approach worked, partially. Over 
the past 5 years, the DEA has lowered 
opioid quotas by an average of 60 per-
cent. 
The DEA, this Federal Agency, will 
soon be proposing its 2022 quotas, and I 
am sending a letter urging them to use 
their new authority and common sense 
to rein in the greed of Big Pharma. 
In the face of all this suffering, new 
legal challenges have been brought to 
hold Big Pharma accountable for death 
and despair of the opioid epidemic. 
Thousands of lawsuits from States, 
counties, cities, and victims have been 
consolidated in one Federal court in 
Cleveland, OH. 
This movement reminded me of an-
other breakthrough moment in public 
health, when our Nation came together 
to hold Big Tobacco accountable for its 
misleading marketing over the dec-
ades. We started holding these compa-
nies accountable in 1998, with the Mas-
ter Tobacco Settlement Agreement. 
That settlement was estimated to pro-
vide States with $246 billion over 25 
years. But despite the pressing need, 
only a tiny fraction—a meager 8 per-
cent of that amount—was actually 
dedicated to tobacco prevention and 
cessation activities. 
Instead, tens of billions from that 
settlement have gone toward filling 
gaps in State budgets and funding pet 
projects like roads and bridges and sta-
diums, even a tobacco museum. 
As 
new 
opioid 
settlements 
are 
reached, we must learn from the 
missed opportunity with tobacco law-
suits. We must ensure that the funds 
from forthcoming opioid settlements 
are used to fortify health systems so 
they can respond to the current opioid 
crisis and prevent our next drug epi-
demic. 
All of us know what is going on out 
there. Even people who acknowledge 
their opioid addiction and are des-
perate for treatment and need help im-
mediately wait for weeks and months 
to enter a drug rehab facility. That is 
just 
unacceptable. 
We 
need 
community- 
and 
residential-based 
treatment. We need to expand naloxone 
access. We need to address the child-
hood trauma often at the root of addic-
tion and other public health strategies. 
One of the things which I believe is 
essential, as our kids get back to 
school after the pandemic experience, 
is that we need more counselors on the 
scene at the schools dealing with these 
kids and this transition back into 
somewhat normal life. These are crit-
ical moments in a child’s formation, 
and I hope that we can have resources 
available to help them. 
The best way to hold Big Pharma ac-
countable is by compelling these com-
panies to pay the price for fueling this 
crisis, and their restitution should be 
devoted to helping America heal. 
Last month, a bipartisan group of 
State attorneys general announced the 
framework of a litigation settlement 
involving Johnson & Johnson and the 
Nation’s three largest drug distribu-
tors. The companies would pay a total 
of $26 billion over 18 years to resolve 
the suits, in addition to changing their 
business practices. 
The work isn’t over yet, and I ap-
plaud the State attorneys general for 
their extensive work involving these 
opioid defendants. 
Legal proceedings continue for sev-
eral other key industry stakeholders 
that have yet to be held accountable— 
that includes the Sackler family of 
Purdue and OxyContin infamy. 
The Sacklers are trying to engineer a 
legal 
scheme 
to 
escape 
liability 
through the bankruptcy court. That is 
the 
family 
that 
started 
Purdue 
Pharma, which was responsible for this 
opioid crisis. They think they found a 
venue now—a bankruptcy court—that 
is going to get them off the hook or at 
least make sure they can protect the 
money that they have made off of this 
criminal enterprise. 
The Sacklers are trying to engineer a 
legal scheme to escape liability for 
their conduct through the bankruptcy 
court, avoiding future lawsuits, while 
paying $4.5 billion, while protecting 
their vast fortunes estimated at over 
$11 billion. 
That is why Senator WARREN and I 
recently teamed up to introduce the 
Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act, 
which would prevent the nonconsen-
sual release of liability through bank-
ruptcy proceedings. 
Translation: The Sacklers should not 
get a discounted ticket to ride into the 
sunset protecting their billions of dol-
lars. They need to be held personally 
liable, and the amount charged against 
them should be taken into account. 
We must demand that the worst cor-
porate actors are held accountable for 
their role in this crisis. Far too many 
families have suffered as a result of 
corporate greed and malfeasance. 
RECOGNIZING BARB’S BAKERY 
Mr. President, sometimes you have 
the best of luck in life, and it is not 
planned. Neighbors of ours in Spring-
field, IL, Tom and Bridget Lamont, 
have invited us to join them at their 
little house on Lake Michigan in 
Leelanau Peninsula in the State of 
Michigan. In that time, we have had 
great experiences together, and we 
have come to know a terrific little 
shop 
called 
Barb’s 
Bakery 
in 
Northport, MI. After years and years of 
wonderful service and great pride, they 
are giving up the business soon. 
I have put in the RECORD a tribute to 
Barb’s Bakery of Northport, MI. I am 
joined by DEBBIE STABENOW and GARY 
PETERS, both Senators from Michigan. 
Mr. President, donuts have been en-
joying a renaissance in recent years. 
Today, you can find ‘‘gourmet’’ donuts 
with flavors like kumquat, beet, guava, 
bacon maple, malted, salted cookie 
dough, and blueberry bourbon basil. 
But for my money, nothing beats the 
famed 
cake 
donuts 
and 
cinnamon 
twists baked fresh every morning at 
Barb’s Bakery in the small town of 
Northport, MI. There is nothing exotic 
about Barb’s donuts. They are simple, 
old-fashioned perfection. 
My wife Loretta and I discovered 
Barb’s Bakery years ago during a vaca-
tion in Northport with our friends,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6197 
August 10, 2021 
Tom and Bridget Lamont, and we have 
gone back nearly every year since. 
Over the years, we have become friends 
with the owner, Barb Holcomb, and her 
husband Jerry Holcomb—great people. 
When Loretta and I first discovered 
her bakery, Barb’s donuts may have 
been the primary reason that travelers 
would 
make 
a 
detour 
through 
Northport, a picturesque little village 
at 
the 
tip 
of 
Michigan’s 
scenic 
Leelanau 
Peninsula. 
That 
has 
all 
changed now. In recent years, new res-
taurants and shops have sprung up 
around town. But Barb’s Bakery re-
mains the anchor, both a destination— 
and a local institution. Each morning, 
it brings local cherry farmers, young 
families, and tourists together over 
coffee and donuts. 
I try to stop by Barb’s a little after 6 
a.m., shortly after Barb or Jerry opens 
the doors. I will get a cup of coffee and 
a cinnamon twist, and Jerry and I will 
sit with the locals sharing local news 
and figuring out how to solve the prob-
lems of the world. Barb starts her 
workday at 1 a.m. each morning. That 
is when she goes to work to mix the 
batter for the next day’s baking. By 
6:30, the benches outside are usually 
filled with local farmers and retirees. 
At around 8 am, the late sleepers and 
tourists show up. But by 10:30 or 11, the 
last donut has usually been sold—so in-
sider tip: Get there early. 
You can smell the aroma of Barb’s 
Bakery about 2 blocks away. Barb tells 
me the butter-yellow, clapboard bakery 
building was first constructed around 
1850. Over the years, it has housed a 
dentist’s office, a shoe repair shop, and 
now, Barb’s bakery. 
Barb first start working there when 
she was 13. She bakes her signature 
cinnamon twists on massive trays that 
hold about 6 dozen twists each. On an 
average day, she sells six trays full. 
Donuts are another big seller—classic 
cake donuts, plain or chocolate-iced— 
plus the special, seasonal flavors: cher-
ry during cherry season and pumpkin 
in the fall. And Barb bakes the best 
cherry pies you have ever tasted. 
Barb learned how to make her fa-
mous cinnamon twists from the women 
who owned the bakery when Barb was a 
teenager. Now, Barb is getting ready to 
pass that precious knowledge on. After 
40 years of baking for others, Barb Hol-
comb recently sold her bakery to a 
young couple from the area, who plan 
to keep baking some of Barb’s signa-
ture treats, 
And Barb and Jerry are looking for-
ward to taking a little time off and 
maybe sleeping late every once in a 
while. Barb plans to put quite a few 
miles on the royal blue 1970s Cadillac 
she just bought. She will continue to 
give generously, and quietly, to the 
people and the village of Northport, as 
she always has. And Barb and Jerry are 
hoping to do some traveling. 
Years ago, shortly after she grad-
uated from high school, Barb and a 
girlfriend took a magical trip through 
Greece and Afghanistan. And Barb fell 
in love with Turkey. She returned 
again and again, often bringing friends 
with her. She bought a house in 
Istanbul, which she kept for many 
years. And she learned to speak Turk-
ish fluently. 
As Barb and Jerry get ready to start 
a new chapter of their lives together, 
Loretta and I want to thank them for 
all of the delicious donuts and for their 
friendship. And Michigan Senators, 
DEBBIE STABENOW and GARY PETERS, 
want to join me in saluting Barb and 
Jerry. 
Let me close by saying to Barb: ‘‘Iyi 
sanslar.’’ Best of luck, my friends. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in the 
time that I have been in the Congress, 
which includes 6 years in the House of 
Representatives and now in my 17th 
year in the Senate, I have been a part 
of or witness to or voted on numerous 
spending proposals and appropriation 
bills, tax bills, deficit reduction bills, 
and debt-limit increase bills through 
the years, and I don’t think I have ever 
seen in all my time in the Congress a 
spending bill where Democrats didn’t 
want to spend more and Republicans 
wanted to spend less. 
Maybe that is consistent with our 
overall governing philosophies. Repub-
licans historically believe in limited 
but effective government, in personal 
freedom coupled with individual re-
sponsibility, in economic freedom, and 
in peace through strength. Those are 
sort of guiding principles. 
So when you get into a debate about 
spending and budgets and appropria-
tion and taxes and all those sorts of 
things, in all the time I have been 
here—and I say this with respect to the 
bill that we are going to be voting on 
here in a few moments—Republicans 
try to spend more efficiently, more ef-
fectively—less, because they know that 
every dollar that gets spent here is 
coming from an American taxpayer. 
So when the bipartisan legislation 
that the Senate will vote on here mo-
mentarily was being considered, it 
started out at about $2.5 trillion. That 
is what President Biden wanted to 
spend on infrastructure. Democrats in 
the Congress—in the Senate; for sure in 
the House of Representatives but in the 
Senate here as well—wanted to spend 
way more than what Republicans want-
ed to spend. Republicans, on the other 
hand, wanted to come up with a bill 
that met the needs that the country 
has, that was robust in addressing in-
frastructure concerns out there but 
spent significantly less than what 
Democrats proposed. 
I say that simply because it has been 
my experience—I have observed this, as 
I said, over the better part of 25 years 
now here in the Congress—that every 
debate, every fight about spending, 
taxes, and debt, Democrats want to 
spend more and Republicans want to 
spend less, again with the recognition 
that every one of those dollars that 
gets spent here in Washington, DC, is 
coming from an American taxpayer 
somewhere across this country. 
So, as we think about what we are 
going to do next, I have to just say it 
is staggering to me, what we are talk-
ing about—the dimensions; the scale; 
$3.5 trillion in spending on top of $2 
trillion spent earlier this year, much of 
which had nothing to do with the 
coronavirus. 
Much of the justification for a lot of 
the spending at one time, at least, was 
that we had to deal with the pandemic, 
the coronavirus, but that is not the 
case now. We still have ongoing issues 
there. We need to make sure that we 
are investing in vaccines and all the 
things that make sure that people in 
this country are able to combat and 
that we are able to get this pandemic 
behind us. But what we are talking 
about with this $3.5 trillion that the 
Democrats are intending and that we 
are going to vote on later today—$3.5 
trillion—their own estimate, not ours. 
A lot of private estimates out there 
suggest that when this is fully imple-
mented over the full window, you are 
talking about $5.5 trillion. You add to 
that the $2 trillion that has already 
been spent earlier this year—all put on 
the debt, by the way, all borrowed from 
our children and grandchildren—and 
you are talking about a stunning, stag-
gering, insane amount of money. 
I have heard the analogy used here 
on the floor and other places by Demo-
crats saying: Well, this is like the New 
Deal. This is the modern New Deal for 
America. 
Well, the New Deal occurred in the 
middle of a Great Depression, where 
unemployment rates were running as 
high as 25 percent. The New Deal hap-
pened at a time when—my dad grew up 
in the Depression. I have heard him tell 
the stories through the years. People 
were struggling. They were struggling 
enormously. The government stepped 
in with some programs to help address 
that to get people back to work. 
But what we are talking about here 
is double—double—the size of the New 
Deal as a percentage of our economy— 
double—at a time when we have, and 
the President was crowing about this 
the other day, 5 percent, 5.4 percent un-
employment in this country and 900,000 
new jobs created in the last reporting. 
So if you think about where the 
economy is, we are coming out of the 
pandemic. People are investing again. 
People are getting out. They are spend-
ing money. We are seeing growth get 
back in the economy. We are seeing 
jobs created. It is literally, to me, the 
definition of ‘‘insanity’’ to pour 3.5 tril-
lion, by their estimate—by a lot of

other estimates, 5 trillion—more dol-
lars into the economy to literally give 
people free everything. 
This isn’t about addressing the pan-
demic or helping get people back to 
work. We have programs that do that. 
We have unemployment insurance that 
has been in place now for a long time. 
Many of us think the plus-up that the 
Federal Government provided was for 
too long because it was keeping people 
from going back to work. But the fact 
of the matter is, we are talking about 
a massive expansion of the Federal 
Government literally to give people 
pretty much free everything. 
Not only does that contradict, I 
think, what this country was all about, 
which in its inception was about free-
dom and liberty, personal freedom, eco-
nomic freedom, individual responsi-
bility, providing people incentives to 
achieve and to do well, making sure 
that we have programs in place, safety 
nets for those who need that help, but 
the idea that at a time when the econ-
omy is growing and expanding and un-
employment is at a fairly low rate his-
torically, we are creating jobs that the 
Federal Government would think that 
it needs, in all its wisdom here in 
Washington, DC, to infuse $5 trillion. 
We already have inflation. It is at the 
highest rate in 13 years. Do you think 
pouring a lot of—flooding the economy 
with a whole bunch more money isn’t 
going to exacerbate the inflation prob-
lem we already have? Not to mention, 
they are talking about paying for it—I 
don’t think it will all be paid for. I 
think a lot of it will go onto the debt. 
By the way, under this budget that is 
being proposed today, that the Demo-
crats are, on a one-sided partisan pro-
cedure, going to vote on, is the biggest 
thing that we have seen certainly in 
my lifetime and will dwarf, as I said, 
anything we have seen in history. The 
debt at the end of all that—at the end 
of all that, 2031, the 10-year budget 
window—will be $45 trillion, 134 percent 
of our gross domestic product. 
There was a day when we were wor-
ried about borrowing up to 100 percent 
of GDP. Well, we have blown past that. 
We have dwarfed that. This is now 
completely out of control, completely 
out of hand. We are talking about a 
massive amount of new spending to ex-
pand government and, to the degree 
that it is paid for, paid for with taxes 
that are going to hit individuals, that 
are going to hit businesses, that are 
going to hit small businesses, and that 
are going to hit farmers and ranchers. 
When you go down the list of taxes, 
the tax increases in this proposal, 
again, I mean, I don’t know where you 
stop. The idea—the suggestion by the 
administration that you are not going 
to hit people who make less than 
$400,000 a year is just absolutely, again, 
I think, insane. I don’t know how you 
can raise $3.5 trillion in taxes and not 
have an economic impact felt by people 
who are on the lower end of the income 
scale. 
I mean, think about it. When taxes 
go up on businesses, what happens? 
Well, 
people 
work 
for 
businesses. 
Democrats think it is easy. We will 
just raise taxes on businesses. Busi-
nesses are not paying enough. Well, 
where do people in this country work? 
They work for businesses. That is 
where they get their paychecks. That 
is where they get their benefits. Wages 
go down when taxes on businesses go 
up, to a historical fact. 
If you think about what also happens 
when taxes are put on businesses, busi-
nesses obviously can do a couple of 
things. They may reduce wages or not 
hire people or reduce the size of their 
workforce. But they also pass that on 
with the cost of higher prices to people 
out there in the economy who are pay-
ing the price for it. That is what we are 
talking about here. It is just abso-
lutely, absolutely stunning, really, in 
my time in the Congress to observe 
something that is being compared to, 
historically, the New Deal in a cir-
cumstance where the economy is grow-
ing and expanding, people should be 
going back to work; and in a time when 
we have already a $30 trillion debt, as 
I said, headed in 2031 to $45 trillion in 
debt, and something that literally 
dwarfs, as a percentage of the econ-
omy, what was done at the time of the 
New Deal, parallel the analogy that is 
being used here by my colleagues on 
the other side. There is just absolutely 
no rationale for doing this. 
But that is what it calls for, $31⁄2 tril-
lion. According to the budget com-
mittee analysts, it includes $4.2 trillion 
in spending—on discretionary spend-
ing—and increased interests on the 
debt are included. 
That bill, which was entirely unpaid 
for—and I am talking about the $1.9 
trillion bill that was passed in March, 
that was ostensibly COVID relief, but, 
in reality, was more like a list of pay-
offs to Democrat constituents. 
There were billions and billions of 
dollars 
for 
schools, 
while 
keeping 
teachers unions happy by omitting any 
requirement for actually getting kids 
back in the classroom, even though 
schools have barely touched the bil-
lions of COVID aid they have already 
been given. 
And, by the way, handoffs to States 
with a distribution formula heavily 
weighted in favor of blue States, in-
cluded bailouts for union pensions, 
loans for labor unions, and I could go 
on. 
And when we talk about the money 
that is going to be, you know, in the 
budget the Democrats are going to 
force us to vote on later today, the ad-
ditional spending that is going to be in 
there, that is on top of—on top of—the 
trillions that we put out the door last 
year, much of which went to State gov-
ernments and many of which don’t 
know how to spend the money they al-
ready have. We are talking trillions, 
much of which went to, as I said, blue 
States. 
But while that bill wastes a lot of 
taxpayer dollars, the problem with 
that bill pales in comparison to what is 
before us today. Today, Democrats are 
taking the first step toward a massive 
and permanent expansion of govern-
ment that would be paid for on the 
backs of ordinary Americans. And my 
colleagues, as I said, on the other side 
of the aisle, will tell you they are just 
levying tax hikes on wealthy Ameri-
cans, but that is not the whole story. 
Those 
corporate 
tax 
hikes 
that 
Democrats are proposing, that tax just 
isn’t going to be paid for by CEOs and 
the board members of corporations. A 
huge part of that is going to fall on 
American workers in the form of 
things like lower salaries and fewer op-
portunities. 
The Tax Foundation notes that the 
share of the corporate tax burden that 
falls on labor is, ‘‘routinely found to be 
between 50 percent and 100 percent, 
with 70 percent or higher the most 
likely outcome.’’ 
By substantially hiking taxes on cor-
porations, Democrats will be substan-
tially increasing the burden borne by 
workers, not to mention reducing our 
competitiveness in the global economy 
by once again giving the United States 
one of the highest corporate tax rates 
in the developed world. 
With our economy still emerging 
from the challenges of coronavirus, it 
is very difficult to understand why 
Democrats would decide that we should 
make American businesses less com-
petitive on the global stage. 
And that is the impact of just one of 
the Democrats’ tax hikes. I haven’t 
talked about the probable effects of 
their tax hike on small businesses— 
that is right, small businesses—or the 
negative economic effects of their huge 
tax increase on investment. 
And then—then—there is the Demo-
crats’ new death tax. That is right, new 
death tax to add to our already exist-
ing death tax, which will reduce inher-
itances 
for 
middle-class 
Americans 
around the country, not to mention 
threatening the very existence of fam-
ily farms and ranches and small busi-
nesses. 
From the way that Democrats have 
been governing, you would think that 
voters have given them a resounding 
mandate to permanently expand gov-
ernment and implement the socialist 
fantasies of the far left. 
In fact—we all know this—Democrats 
hold a narrow majority in the House of 
Representatives, where they lost seats; 
and the Senate is equally split between 
Democrats and Republicans. 
And Democrats’ far-left Presidential 
candidates couldn’t make it out of the 
Democrat 
primary. 
That 
is 
right, 
President Biden was able to win the 
Democrat primary and the general 
election because he presented himself 
accurately or inaccurately as a mod-
erate. 
But despite their lack of a mandate, 
Democrat leaders are apparently more 
and more willing to let the far left of 
the Democrat party run the show, 
which is why we are standing here 
today contemplating a $4.2 trillion

spending spree to permanently expand 
the size of government. 
We don’t yet know all the details of 
Democrats’ 
budget-busting 
spending 
legislation, but what we do know is not 
encouraging. In addition to taxes that 
will burden hard-working Americans 
and hurt our economy, Democrats are 
contemplating a new welfare benefit 
with no associated work requirement. 
Lots and lots of free stuff, like 2 free 
years of community college; elements 
of Democrats’ most extreme specialist 
fantasy, the Green New Deal; amnesty 
for individuals here in our country ille-
gally; funding for tens of thousands— 
yes, tens of thousands—of new IRS 
agents; a tax cut for blue State mil-
lionaires and billionaires; and more. 
And, by the way, on that point, it is 
really ironic to me to hear Democrats 
come down here and talk about Repub-
licans wanting to cut taxes for rich 
people when this proposal, in this legis-
lation, 50 percent—50 percent of the tax 
cut, by doing away with the cap on de-
ductibility of State and local taxes; 50 
percent of that benefit goes to people 
making more than $1 million a year. So 
much for worrying about people on the 
low income of the income scale. 
Democrats want to spend taxpayer 
dollars to hire hundreds of thousands 
of young people for a Civilian Climate 
Corps to fight climate change—Civilian 
Climate Corps. There is no word yet on 
whether this is actually an effective 
way to address our Nation’s climate 
challenges, but that isn’t going to stop 
Democrats from spending billions of 
dollars to find out. 
I haven’t even mentioned how all this 
new government spending is likely to 
increase inflation. Americans are al-
ready 
facing 
significant 
inflation, 
thanks in part to Democrats’ earlier 
flooding of the economy with govern-
ment spending. Now Democrats want 
to come close to doubling that spend-
ing. I don’t even want to think about 
what inflation will look like if they 
succeed in their spending plans. 
Thanks to Democrats’ decision to 
utilize special Senate budget rules for 
their tax-and-spending spree, they have 
the ability today to force through this 
massive spending package on a totally 
partisan basis. 
But my Republican colleagues and I 
will do everything we can to protect 
Americans from the consequences of 
Democrats’ reckless, reckless legisla-
tion. And I hope some of my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle—all it 
takes is one—will intervene before 
their party’s taxing-and-spending spree 
turns an economic recovery into an 
economic disaster. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, let me 
start by commending my colleague 
from South Dakota, Senator THUNE, 
for his explanation of what is before us 
next after the vote that we are about 
to take, and that will be getting into 
the budget resolution leading to a rec-
onciliation package. And he is abso-
lutely right, these taxes and this high- 
level spending is not something that 
our country can sustain, and I appre-
ciate his outlining the very specific im-
pacts it would have on the people we 
represent. 
But this morning, I am also here to 
talk about how the Senate will do 
something very good today prior to 
getting into the budget resolution. The 
Senate is about to make history. 
And we have heard over the years—in 
fact, over the decades—about the need 
for us to fix our infrastructure. Every 
President in modern times has talked 
about it—President Bush, President 
Obama, President Trump, President 
Biden. We have talked about it a lot 
here. There is a joke around town that 
infrastructure week has come and gone 
so many times that people are a little 
cynical when we talk about it. 
Well, today is infrastructure day. We 
are actually going to see what we have 
been talking about, which is the Sen-
ate, on a bipartisan basis, saying: You 
know what, it is time to fix our roads 
and bridges. We can do so in a respon-
sible way, not by raising taxes on the 
American people, but by making im-
portant investments in long-term cap-
ital assets that will last for years. 
So it is an investment in fixing up 
our roads, our bridges, our water sys-
tems, our railroads, our ports, our elec-
trical grids, our broadband network, 
and expanding that, and more. 
We have had a number of procedural 
votes to get us to this point; and based 
on those procedural votes, I think it is 
clear that we will have the votes today, 
on a bipartisan basis, to do this impor-
tant work. The Senate will have done 
its job, and we will have achieved a 
real lasting bipartisan victory for the 
people we represent. 
The bill, called the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act, will improve 
the lives of all Americans by making 
this long-overdue investment of $548 
billion over the next 5 years in new 
spending to repair, upgrade, and re-
place the crumbling infrastructure all 
of our constituents rely on every day. 
That doesn’t mean the money is 
going to be spent, by the way, over the 
next 5 years. It is authorized for that 
period, but we spend over the next 5, 10, 
15, maybe 20 years on projects all over 
the country. 
We know we need this investment. 
The American Society of Civil Engi-
neers gives our American infrastruc-
ture a grade of C-minus. They also 
project that our economy stands to 
lose more than $10 trillion in economic 
growth in GDP by 2039, should we fail 
to invest in repairs. 
There is an international organiza-
tion that looks at all the countries in 
the world, who says who has got the 
best infrastructure in the world and, by 
the way, we are number 13 or 14 on that 
list now. So many countries are ahead 
of us. 
China spends about four times more 
than we do on infrastructure as a per-
cent of their GDP. Why? Because they 
know that will make their economy 
more efficient and they want to beat us 
in the economic fight that we have 
globally. 
We want to win. That is one reason 
this is so important. 
The American people, by the way, 
understand the need for this invest-
ment. In two of the more recent polls 
from CNBC and CBS News, 87 percent 
of the American people back bipartisan 
efforts to fix our roads, our bridges, 
and our water systems. 
We know that this targeted, long- 
term investment in core infrastructure 
is good for the economy. Building out 
hard assets make us more competitive 
in the global economy and will create 
hundreds of thousands of good jobs for 
builders, 
plumbers, 
electrical 
engi-
neers, coders, and so many other fields. 
Economists, including Douglas Holtz- 
Eakin of the American Action Forum 
and Michael Strain of the conservative 
American Enterprise Institute, have 
pointed out that this type of spending 
on long-term spending on hard assets 
does not further inflation but, in fact, 
is counterinflationary. 
To me, not only does this investment 
make sense, but, importantly, what we 
are doing here today also demonstrates 
to the American people that we can get 
our act together on a bipartisan basis 
and get something done. We can do big 
things on a bipartisan basis if we put 
our minds to it. 
Again, after years, even decades of 
talking about the need to do this, we 
are finally getting it done. 
Is it exactly the bill I would have 
drafted? 
No. It is not exactly the bill any Sen-
ator in this Chamber would have draft-
ed because it represents a true bipar-
tisan effort. Each side made conces-
sions to find that common ground. 
I want to take this opportunity to 
briefly thank my colleagues who have 
gotten us to this point. We spent a lot 
of long nights and long days working 
to write this legislation, and there has 
been a group of members who have 
been particularly committed to it. 
One is SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, who is 
on the floor right now. The work she 
did with President Biden early on laid 
the foundation for this. She is also the 
ranking member of the EPW Com-
mittee that produced some of the legis-
lation that we incorporated on the sur-
face transportation front. 
But there are so many others. And I 
would like to start with my counter-
part, the lead negotiator on the other 
side of the aisle, Senator KYRSTEN 
SINEMA of Arizona. The two of us began 
meeting more than 4 months ago to 
have discussions that would then lay 
the foundation for our path forward. 
And it was in the context of President 
Biden having proposed a huge package, 
$2.65 trillion—so-called infrastructure 
package—and we believed we could pull 
out real infrastructure from there, 
take the high taxes out, and get some-
thing done for the American people. I

commend her for her leadership, for her 
courage, and for her ability to keep us 
on track during some tough times dur-
ing this process. 
From there, it truly became a group 
effort, particularly among five Repub-
licans and five Democrats, who spent a 
lot of long days and nights negotiating 
the framework of this legislation. 
Some of us had worked together before 
at the end of the year in putting to-
gether the so-called 908 framework for 
the COVID–19 bill that passed late last 
year, that was also bipartisan.

ator SUSAN
COLLINS, MITT
ROMNEY, 
LISA
MURKOWSKI, BILL
CASSIDY, JOE 
MANCHIN, JEANNE SHAHEEN, MARK WAR-
NER, and JOHN TESTER, thank you for 
your efforts these past few months. 
I also want to give special thanks to 
our colleague, KEVIN
CRAMER, who 
joined our group late but was instru-
mental in finalizing this agreement. 
I want to thank the White House and 
especially Steve Ricchetti and Brian 
Deese and Louisa Terrell for their sup-
port of this effort and their commit-
ment to trying to work in a bipartisan 
way to get it done. 
I also want to thank Senator TOM 
CARPER, who just joined us in the 
room. Along with Senator CAPITO, he 
was the EPW chair. He was the ranking 
member that laid much of the founda-
tion for this legislation, particularly 
with regards to our roads and our 
bridges. 
I want to thank my other colleagues 
in the so-called G–22, who helped in the 
22 different working groups that were 
formed to help put this legislation to-
gether: RICHARD BURR, LINDSEY GRA-

get to this point by giving us good 
input that was incorporated in the leg-
islation—MIKE

I want to give a particular thank you 
to my friend and colleague our Repub-
lican leader, Senator MITCH
MCCON-
NELL. I want to thank him for his en-
couragement and his support through-
out this process, for sticking his neck 
out. I know he is probably the only per-
son who is as happy as I am in this 
Chamber to see us move forward with 
this legislation that will help us find a 
long-term solution to a major bridge, 
the Brent Spence Bridge that links our 
home State of Ohio and Kentucky. 
I want to thank the committee 
staffs, who did so much to lay the 
groundwork for this legislation. About 
73 percent of the pages in this final 
2,700-page legislation are legislation 
that either passed the Senate or 
cleared committees in the Senate in 
this Congress, and that is a tribute to 
the quiet bipartisanship that goes on 
at the committee level every day that 
allows us to get these things done with 
the requisite knowledge and expertise. 
I also want to thank all of the non-
partisan staff here in the U.S. Senate 
for their work as well. I know that over 
the past few weeks, especially, the leg-
islative counsel has worked closely 
with my staff and the staffs of other of-
fices to help formalize this proposal 
into final text before us today. They 
worked weekends. They worked late 
nights. 
The same with the Joint Committee 
on Taxation and the Congressional 
Budget 
Office, 
they 
have 
worked 
around the clock to get us to this 
point. 
And the staff here on the floor, they 
have been here just as early as we have 
and stayed just as late as any of us, in 
fact, later, to ensure that this could be 
possible. I thank them. 
I also want to thank the more than 
100 industry associations, unions, and 
trade groups that came forward to en-
dorse this Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act. That includes business 
groups, like the chamber of commerce, 
the Business Roundtable, and the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers. It 
also includes labor groups, like the 
AFL–CIO Building Trades Council, the 
International Brotherhood of Team-
sters, the Laborers International Union 
of North America. 
It also includes supporters from all 
levels of government, including the Na-
tional League of Cities; the U.S. Con-
ference of Mayors, who endorsed it; the 
National Governors Association. 
It includes more than 30 agricultural 
groups, including the American Farm 
Bureau. 
These organizations, and so many 
others like them, have been critical to 
encouraging Members of the Senate to 
do the right thing. 
And, finally, I want to, again, thank 
my staff and the staffs of all the Mem-
bers who worked for months to get this 
bill to the finish line. We would not be 
here without them. There is no ques-
tion about that. 
On a personal staff level, I want to 
thank 
Kevin 
Smith, 
Sarah 
Peery, 
Avery Pierson, Anne Gordon, Mike 
Sinacore, Lydia Denis, Adeline Ewing, 
Connor Rabb, Connor Hinson, Kalyn 
Swihart, Matt Lloyd, and our entire 
comms team: Angie Youngen and Nate 
Dehmlow, Stephanie Mertz, and Chris 
Mitchell. 
On my Homeland and Security Gov-
ernmental Affairs staff, I want to 
thank Pam Thiessen, Amanda Neely, 
Sam Mulopulos, Cara Mumford, Trey 
Hicks, Liam McKenna, Jeff Post, and 
Emily Benavides. 
Again, we wouldn’t be standing here 
and about to have this vote without 
them working their hearts out, staying 
late, getting in early, and ensuring 
that every single part of this bill has 
been looked over carefully to make 
sure we got it right. 
Everyone involved in this effort can 
be proud of what this body is achieving 
today. The Senate is doing its job. It is 
doing its job by helping the American 
people we represent through a historic 
investment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture that will serve the American peo-
ple for decades to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 10 minutes, followed by 
Senators CARPER and SCHUMER for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, well, it 
is great to be on the floor today. I 
think we have much to celebrate. We 
have a lot of tired people, I think, who 
have devoted a lot of time and energy 
to this effort. And so, after a long week 
of amendments, it is time to get this 
done. 
Isn’t it, Senator CARPER, my chair-
man on EPW? 
We have talked all week about how 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act delivers for the American people, 
and I am proud that the foundation of 
this bill—the foundations of this bill— 
is, as the Senator from Ohio just men-
tioned, based off of the two very bipar-
tisan, unanimously bipartisan, EPW in-
frastructure bills that we passed in the 
spring. 
This historic investment reflects our 
commitment to keeping America safe, 
improving our global competitiveness, 
and growing our economy. So I am 
going to go through a few of the high-
lights because I think they are impor-
tant for the American people to know 
exactly what this bill does. 
It provides $303.5 billion over 5 years 
for Federal highway programs—a 35- 
percent increase from the last bill. 
There is a new $2 billion rural surface 
transportation grant that will dedicate 
resources to the Appalachian Develop-
ment 
Highway 
System 
that 
runs 
through many of our States and other 
critical projects across rural America. 
Combined, the overall package in-
cludes $40 billion in dedicated re-
sources for bridges—the single largest 
investment in bridge infrastructure 
construction of the Interstate System. 
I am from a small State. I got a lot 
of bridges. I got a lot of bridges, and, 
unfortunately, a lot of them are not in 
the best condition. This would be a 
monumental improvement in what I 
see every day in my State. 
The bill authorizes $35 billion for 
water projects across the country, with 
a focus on upgrading aging infrastruc-
ture. This is a bill that we passed out 
of our EPW Committee. 
It invests in innovative technologies 
and provides assistance to rural and 
low-income communities to help them 
keep their water safe and clean. 
This package represents the largest 
investment in clean drinking water in

our Nation’s history. That is some-
thing that I think we all can be proud 
of. 
There is funding for broadband—es-
sential to this 21st-century economy— 
education, tourism, healthcare, and all 
of the things we have realized that 
broadband brings us and how impor-
tant it is for each family and each busi-
ness to have it; ports, airports, locks 
and dams. Funding for the Corps of En-
gineers will improve our water re-
sources infrastructure, facilitating the 
movement of goods and mitigating 
flood risks. 
Reauthorization of the AML Program 
will provide billions of dollars to clean 
up abandoned mine sites. It is impor-
tant in our State. Pennsylvania has got 
a lot of them too. 
We 
are 
fighting 
against 
climate 
change, and we are cleaning up our en-
vironment. 
This legislation doesn’t just invest in 
our infrastructure, but it will allow 
projects to move more quickly. Far too 
often, infrastructure projects are de-
layed because of the expensive and ar-
duous environmental review and per-
mitting process. 
An environmental impact statement 
under the NEPA Act for highway 
projects takes an average of 7 years. 
Think about how long that is and how 
much more money that costs. 
The highway bill unanimously ap-
proved by our EPW Committee in-
cludes numerous project delivery pro-
visions to provide a more efficient, pre-
dictable process. 
Notably, it codifies ‘‘One Federal De-
cision.’’ One Federal Decision for high-
way projects would establish a 2-year 
goal for completing environmental re-
views. This isn’t skirting the environ-
mental process. This isn’t running 
roughshod over it. This is putting a 
time clock on it. Let’s move it. 
It requires predictable schedules co-
ordinated by Agencies and requires a 
single environmental document with 
concurrent reviews, providing account-
ability and transparency. 
The EPW bill that we passed makes 
other commonsense reforms, like al-
lowing States to be reimbursed for 
early utility relocation necessary for a 
project while the process is ongoing. 
Additional provisions in the broader 
legislation will extend the FAST–41 
permitting reforms, with which Sen-
ator PORTMAN
is very, very instru-
mental, to help us build other types of 
infrastructure more efficiently. 
The reforms and investments this bill 
makes aren’t just for now but for the 
next generation. 
We have had a very lengthy and ro-
bust debate on the Senate floor. I 
would like to thank Senators PORTMAN 
and SINEMA; Senator COLLINS, who is 
on the floor; Senator PORTMAN, Sen-
ator SINEMA, all of the group of 20. If I 
start naming them, I am going to leave 
somebody out. But, particularly, Sen-
ators PORTMAN and SINEMA picked up 
the ball where I left it. You know, I 
would like to think I got it to the 5- 
yard line. Maybe not so quite, but I got 
the ball rolling, and I got it moving in 
the right direction, and then they did 
the tough sledding ahead, and I thank 
them for that. 
I would also like to thank my coun-
terpart, Chairman CARPER. He has been 
great in managing this bill on the floor 
but also to keep the guardrails on that 
we established to make sure that the 
group—the bipartisan group—was fol-
lowing along with what the committee 
had unanimously passed and how we 
felt would be the most effective way to 
invest in our infrastructures for the fu-
ture. 
I would like to thank my entire EPW 
Committee team, starting with my 
staff director, Adam, who has been 
with me for many, many years. What 
you don’t know, and what I know, is 
that Adam was back in the back with 
Mary Frances, and they were the traf-
fic cops through the whole amendment 
process, working with the committees, 
the different five committees; Repub-
lican, Democrat; leadership, leader-
ship; all of the different individual 
Members. 
So I am going to give Adam 1 day off, 
and then I think he will be right back 
at it. But he is really irreplaceable to 
our committee but also to this whole 
process. 
And also in the Chamber with us 
today, Lauren Baker and Murphie Bar-
rett have many, many hours of just in-
credible depth of knowledge in this 
area. We couldn’t have done it without 
you. 
I am going to name the rest of my 
staff who is not here with us: Libby 
Callaway, Georgianna Clemmons, who I 
announced has still not had her baby— 
I announced it last I time mentioned 
her; she is still waiting—Marli Collier, 
Travis 
Cone, 
Sarah 
Delavan, 
Will 
Dixon, Elizabeth Horner, Max Hyman, 
Tyler Jenkins, Jess Kramer, Jake Ken-
nedy, Matt Lupes, Kayla McMurry, 
Taylor 
Meredith, 
Jacob 
Mitchell, 
Kelley Moore, Katherine Smith, Travis 
Voyles, and Andy Zock for their tire-
less efforts that have helped advance 
our committee’s infrastructure legisla-
tion. 
On my personal team, I would like to 
thank my chief of staff, Joe Brubaker 
and J.T. Jezierski for their leadership. 
I really want to thank Senator CAR-
PER’s 
EPW 
staff, 
especially 
Mary 
Frances Repko, who is on the floor 
with the Senator today, but also Re-
becca 
Higgins, 
John 
Kane, 
Greg 
Dotson, Laura Gilliam, Heather Dan, 
Mackie 
McIntosh, 
Annie 
D’Amato, 
Kenneth Martin, and Tyler Hoffman- 
Reardon for their dedication to this 
process as well. 
I will say, under Mary Frances’s lead-
ership and Adam’s leadership on my 
committee, I think they have dem-
onstrated to many committees, and 
certainly to us as the chairman and 
ranking member, that you can have 
conversations, 
communications, 
and 
you can work things out. You can work 
things out if you just stick with it. 
So thank you, both, very, very much. 
It is time to bring this bill home and 
do the work that the American people 
expect us to do, which is to find bipar-
tisan, consensus-driven solutions to 
our Nation’s pressing challenges. And 
this is a pressing challenge. 
Again, I urge a vote of yes on this 
historic bipartisan bill that will im-
prove our core infrastructure. 
If we pass this important legislation, 
I hope that the House will move swift-
ly—and as a former Member of the 
House, as we all are, the House can 
move swiftly when they need to—and 
get this bill to the President’s desk 
quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Senator 
CAPITO has been very, very gracious in 
her thanks and praise, and it is now her 
turn to be on the receiving end. 
We have all heard of the Gang of 20 or 
the Gang of 22—the Group of 20 or 22— 
but before there was a gang or a group 
of 22, there was a gang of 1—the Sen-
ator from West Virginia, my native 
State. 
She joined in with the President and 
the President’s team to really get the 
ball rolling and sort of took the hand 
off from what we had done working 
with the administration, meeting with 
the administration, meeting with the 
President. 
But with the President, after our 
meeting, they decided to engage. They 
decided to engage with the Senator. 
And, eventually, to use a football 
analogy here, she might not have got-
ten the ball into the end zone, but I say 
to the Senator, you certainly got it 
into the red zone, and we are grateful 
for all of your work, and, really, your 
good humor and good treatment when 
things were tough. 
Sitting right here on my left is Mary 
Frances Repko, the staff director of 
our EPW Committee on the Demo-
cratic side. And she is joined today, I 
think, on the floor by John Kane, by 
Mackie McIntosh, and by Tyler Hoff-
man. And we have Adam over here sit-
ting next to the ranking member— 
Adam. 
I have gone before through the names 
of your staff, but I will just say you all 
are back here, and we are grateful for 
the great support and work that you 
have done, each one of you. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t thank— 
you don’t get to be floor managers 
without somebody in the leadership 
saying: Well, we would like you to be 
floor managers. So to Senator SCHUMER 
and Senator MCCONNELL, thank you for 
putting your confidence and trust in 
Senator CAPITO and me. 
To the floor staff, the folks who work 
for the leaders, thank you very much 
for keeping us on the straight and level 
and heading in the right direction. 
ROB PORTMAN is still here on the 
floor. I don’t see KYRSTEN SINEMA. ROB 
is here. ROB, Senator PORTMAN, suc-
ceeds George Voinovich. He was a dear

friend as Governor. We were Governors 
together and Senators together. I miss 
George every day, but you have more 
than filled his shoes, my friend, and I 
salute you for your leadership. 
KYRSTEN
SINEMA
is relatively new 
here, but she has really, really im-
pressed a lot of people, taken the bull 
by the horns, never gave up, just 
wouldn’t give up. And because of her 
efforts and the partnership she has 
with Senator PORTMAN, we are here 
today. 
I quoted a couple of times during de-
bate the words of Winston Churchill. 
Winston 
Churchill, 
when 
he 
was 
thrown out of office at the end of World 
War II, was asked as he left 10 Downing 
Street: Is this the end? 
He replied, famously: This is not the 
end. This is not the beginning of the 
end. This is the end of the beginning. 
The end of the beginning. And so it is 
here with us today. 
We are nearing the end of a debate 
and the final vote on the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. And 
before we take a vote on the adoption 
of this measure, I just want to take a 
moment to reflect briefly on how this 
bipartisan infrastructure bill came to 
be. 
Senator CAPITO has already referred 
to this, but I wanted to reinforce it. In 
February of this year, at my encour-
agement, President Biden invited Sen-
ator CAPITO, Senator CARDIN, Senator 
INHOFE, and me—all senior members of 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee—to the White House to dis-
cuss the need to make bold investment 
in our Nation’s crumbling infrastruc-
ture. He asked us, the Environment 
and Public Works Committee, to lead 
the effort to address that need; to get 
to work in our committee by crafting 
and reporting to the full Senate, to 
this body, surface transportation legis-
lation—roads, 
highways, 
bridges—as 
well as drinking water and water sani-
tation infrastructure, climate change 
legislation by springtime. That was the 
request. 
In the weeks that followed, working 
together with all 22 members—20 mem-
bers, rather, of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, that is ex-
actly what we did—10 Democrats, 10 
Republicans working together. In May, 
we reported out of our committee a 5- 
year transportation bill with a unani-
mous bipartisan vote of 20 to 0. 
By more than a third, we increased 
investments in our roads, our high-
ways, and our bridges, with a historic 
climate title to help address the most 
serious challenge facing our planet, 
and that is the threat of global warm-
ing. 
That Transportation bill is at the 
core of the legislation we consider 
today, along with the drinking water 
and wastewater infrastructure legisla-
tion that was also reported unani-
mously out of the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works earlier this 
year and passed by the full Senate 
right here, earlier this year, by an 89- 
to-2 vote. 
That bill targets the most impover-
ished communities across America to 
help them meet their drinking and 
wastewater treatment needs. 
I am proud—we are proud—of the 
work that our committee has done, 
made possible by the partnership that 
we enjoy. I think of the work that we 
did—I think of it as laying the founda-
tion. Clean drinking water, wastewater 
sanitation, roads, highways, bridges, 
climate really are the foundation on 
which this package was built. 
And we tried to provide an example 
to the rest of the Senate and the other 
committees of jurisdiction, and I like 
to think that maybe we did that. 
Leadership is all about leading, and 
the President sought and encouraged 
us to try to lead earlier this year, and 
I think we have met that request and 
then some. I want to thank him. He 
didn’t give up either. And he has been 
negotiating with Senator CAPITO and 
negotiating with the team, the gang of 
22. He never gave up. A lot of people 
said this was a fool’s errand. He never 
gave up. I am proud of him and the 
leadership that he has provided. 
The bill that is before this body 
today builds on the strong bipartisan 
work of our committee, Environment 
and Public Works, as well as the good 
work done by our colleagues on other 
committees—the 
Commerce 
Com-
mittee and the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee among them. My 
appreciation to all who worked so tire-
lessly on this Herculean undertaking. 
Now, let me be clear. This legislation 
isn’t perfect. It has been said before. 
You will hear that again. I have never 
written a bill that was perfect, and this 
certainly, even though we had a fair 
hand in writing a lot of it, is not per-
fect. In spite of making real progress, 
it doesn’t go as far as we would like to 
go in advancing equity, the way we 
treat other people—the Golden Rule, 
treating other people the way we want 
to be treated—in tackling the existen-
tial crisis of our time, and that is cli-
mate change. 
There is much more work to do on 
these issues—issues that, in my mind, 
we have a moral obligation to address. 
So rest assured I will be joining my 
colleagues in fighting for progress on 
these fronts in the days and weeks 
ahead. 
But let’s not make the perfect the 
enemy of the good. And make no mis-
take, the bill before us does a whole lot 
of good. It is the largest long-term in-
vestment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture in almost a century—almost a 
century—and the largest Federal in-
vestment in history when it comes to 
public transit, clean energy trans-
mission, 
climate 
resiliency, 
clean 
drinking water, and wastewater infra-
structure. 
Now, on this day, the American peo-
ple are looking for us to strengthen our 
economy and support our communities 
and build for our future. On this day, 
we have a President dedicated to mov-
ing past partisan divides and meeting 
the moment for our Nation. And on 
this day, leaders in this body from 
across the political spectrum have 
come together in shared purpose, in 
common cause, and commitment to 
find a way forward. 
I want to close with the thought that 
there is a lot of bridge money in here, 
a lot of money to fix bridges all over: 
West Virginia, Delaware, Ohio, Maine. 
You name it. There is a lot of troubled 
water in our country, troubled water. 
And I would like to think, with this 
legislation, crafted together across the 
aisle, bipartisan, with the administra-
tion, we have created a bridge over 
troubled waters. Think about that: a 
bridge over troubled waters—and right 
at a time when we really needed one. 
And we could use a few more as we go 
along. 
Sometimes when I travel people ask 
me—they say: What do you do? What 
do you do anyway? 
They don’t know what I do, on the 
airplane or whatever. I say: I help peo-
ple. 
They say: How do you help them? 
I think the best way we can help peo-
ple is help them find a job, have a job 
where they can support themselves and 
their families. We can help make sure 
that they have clean water to drink. 
We can help make sure they have clean 
air to breathe. 
Those are ways that we are helping 
people with this legislation—big time, 
big time—and we will be doing it for a 
long time. 
Colleagues, on this day, we can vote 
to make a downpayment on a brighter 
future for our country. I want to ask 
you to join me in seizing the day in 
voting to advance this legislation to-
gether. On this day, let us seize the 
day. Carpe diem. Carpe diem. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first 
let me, before I begin, thank Senators 
CARPER and CAPITO for managing this 
bill and doing it in such a fine way— 
and their staffs as well. 
Now, Mr. President, it has been a 
long and winding road, but we have 
persisted, and now we have arrived. 
There were many logs in our path, de-
tours along the way, but the American 
people will now see the most robust in-
jection of funds into infrastructure in 
decades. 
In a few moments, the Senate will 
pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, 
dedicating over a trillion dollars to 
strengthen every major category of our 
country’s physical infrastructure. It 
has been a long time in coming. Our 
economy is No. 1 in the world, but in-
frastructure ranks No. 13. You will find 
better roads, bridges, airports, and 
broadband in the United Arab Emirates 
than in the United States of America. 
Today, the Senate takes a decades- 
overdue step to revitalize America’s in-
frastructure and give our workers, our 
businesses, and our economy the tools

August 10, 2021 
to succeed in the 21st century. The bill 
will make large and significant dif-
ferences in both productivity and job 
creation in America for decades to 
come. 
To my colleagues, particularly the 
group of 10, then 11, then 22 who 
worked so hard in a bipartisan way, 
congratulations. Congratulations on a 
job well done. Thank you to our com-
mittee chairs and ranking members 
whose expertise was required at several 
stages. And to the staff who sacrificed 
weekends, family gatherings, and most 
often sleep in order to finish this bill, 
thank you. 
Thank you to President Biden and 
his team at the White House. President 
Biden has been in office for only 7 
months, and already the Senate is 
about to pass the first major infra-
structure package in over a decade, on 
a bipartisan basis, with his complete 
and total involvement. 
Throughout the process, I have tried 
to prod the negotiators along when 
they have needed it and given them 
space when they have asked for it. At 
times, it took a deadline to kick nego-
tiations into high gear; other times it 
required a few extra days to allow com-
promise to gel. But when the Senate is 
run with an open hand rather than a 
closed fist, Senators can accomplish 
big things. 
So despite this long road we have 
taken, we have finally, finally reached 
the finish line. 
Of course, we Democrats believe we 
need to do much more. The bipartisan 
infrastructure bill is a very significant 
bill, but our country has other very 
significant, very important challenges. 
Working families need help. Small 
businesses need a leg up. Climate 
change threatens the future of our 
planet. Our Tax Code needs to be 
straightened out. Other parts of our in-
frastructure not addressed in this bi-
partisan bill still need focus, attention, 
and help. 
So to my colleagues who are con-
cerned that this does not do enough on 
climate, for families, and making cor-
porations and the rich pay their fair 
share, we are moving on to a second 
track, which will make generational 
transformation in these areas. 
Once this bill is complete, the Senate 
will immediately turn to the second 
track in our two-track strategy, pass-
ing a budget resolution that will 
unlock historic investments in Amer-
ican jobs, American families, and the 
fight against climate change. The two- 
track strategy is proceeding full steam 
ahead. 
At its core, the Democratic budget— 
both parts—is about restoring the mid-
dle class in the 21st century and giving 
more Americans the opportunity to get 
there. Too many in the middle class 
are worried about their future. The 
sunny American optimism has turned 
into a sourness, an anger, a divisive-
ness in the land. 
Bold, transformative action on both 
traditional infrastructure and on help-
ing families—middle-class families— 
cope and on climate will restore that 
bright, sunny optimism that has been 
part of this American psyche for cen-
turies. 
At its core, what we want to do is 
this: We want to cut taxes for families. 
We want to create millions of jobs 
while tackling the climate crisis, and 
we want to pay for it by making cor-
porations and the wealthy finally pay 
their fair share. 
After we pass the bipartisan infra-
structure bill this morning, Senators 
should expect to vote to proceed to the 
budget resolution, and we will begin 
the process for debating amendments 
shortly thereafter. 
Democrats are prepared to move 
quickly and decisively through the 
amendment process so we can finish 
what we set out to do before the end of 
the work period. The longer it takes to 
finish, the longer the Senate will be in 
session. 
At the start of July, I set two ambi-
tious goals for this Chamber before our 
August recess. One was to pass a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill to boost our 
economy, something the Senate has 
not achieved in many years, and this is 
a strong and bold accomplishment. The 
second was to pass a budget resolution 
with 
the 
kinds 
of 
transformative 
changes I have mentioned. Pundits 
called it wishful thinking in a Chamber 
known for unhurried deliberation. 
Well, we are moments away from 
achieving the first goal, and I am con-
fident that very soon the Senate will 
take the first major step toward 
achieving our second goal. The Senate 
is on track to finish both tracks and 
deliver an outstanding result for the 
American people.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The clerk will report the reso-
lution by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 14) 
setting forth the congressional budget for 
the United States Government for fiscal year 
2022 and setting forth the appropriate budg-
etary levels for fiscal years 2023 through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that for the dura-
tion of the Senate’s consideration of S. 
Con. Res. 14, the budget resolution for 
fiscal year 2021, the majority and the 
Republican managers of the resolution, 
while seated or standing at the man-
agers’ desks, be permitted to deliver 
floor remarks, retrieve, review, and 
edit documents, and send email and 
other data communications from text 
displayed on wireless personal digital 
assistant devices and tablet devices. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
the use of calculators be permitted on 
the floor during consideration of the 
budget resolution; further, that the 
staff be permitted to make technical 
and conforming changes to the resolu-
tion, if necessary, consistent with the 
amendments adopted during Senate 
consideration, 
including 
calculating 
the associated change in the net inter-
est function and incorporating the ef-
fect of such adopted amendments on 
the budgetary aggregates for Federal 
revenues, the amount by which the 
Federal revenue should be changed, 
new budget authority, budget outlays, 
deficits, public debt, and debt held by 
the public. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there be 2 
minutes for debate, equally divided, 
prior to each vote during consideration 
of S. Con. Res. 14. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me 
begin by thanking President Biden and 
Majority Leader SCHUMER
for their 
leadership 
in 
the 
arduous 
process 
which has gotten us to where we are 
right now. 
I do understand that many of my Re-
publican colleagues are in a bit of 
shock. They are in a bit of shock now. 
They are finding it hard to believe that 
the President and the Democratic Cau-
cus are prepared to go forward in ad-
dressing the long, neglected needs of 
working families and not just the 1 per-
cent and wealthy campaign contribu-
tors. That is not the way things usu-
ally happen around here. 
Usually, it is the big money inter-
ests, the campaign contributors, and 
the lobbyists who call the tunes. But 
not today. Today, we move this coun-
try in a very different direction. 
The American people are sick and 
tired of growing income and wealth in-
equality in our country, where two 
people now own more wealth than the 
bottom 40 percent, where the top 1 per-
cent owns more wealth than the bot-
tom 92 percent, and where 45 percent of 
all new income has gone to the top 1 
percent since 2009. 
In other words, the people on top are 
doing phenomenally well. 
Meanwhile, while the very rich have 
become much richer, the gross unfair-
ness of our current tax system has al-
lowed, in a given year, some of the 
wealthiest people in our country and 
some of the largest and most profitable 
corporations to not pay a nickel in a 
given year in Federal income tax—not 
one penny. 
Well, that is about to change. The 
American people want a government 
which represents all of us and not just 
the few. And this legislation is going to 
ask the wealthiest people in our coun-
try to start paying their fair share of 
taxes so that we can address the needs 
of working families, the elderly, the 
children, the sick, and the poor. 
And despite what some of my Repub-
lican colleagues may be saying, no one 
in America who makes less than 
$400,000 a year will pay a nickel more 
in Federal taxes. In fact, what we are 
looking at in this budget proposal is a 
historic tax cut for working families 
and the middle class. 
Further, and importantly, at a time 
when California is on fire, when Oregon 
is on fire, when Greece is burning, and 
when countries throughout the world 
are 
experiencing 
unprecedented 
drought, which will clearly impact food 
production, this legislation begins the 
process of combating climate change so 
that our kids and grandchildren can 
live in a country and on a planet which 
is healthy and habitable. It would be 
immoral and an absolute dereliction of 
our responsibilities as elected officials 
to do anything less. We cannot ignore 
climate change any longer. Now is the 
time for our great country to lead the 
world out of this existential crisis. 
And, by the way, as we address the 
long neglected needs of working fami-
lies and as we combat climate change, 
we are going to create millions of good- 
paying jobs, many of them union jobs. 
Let me very briefly take this oppor-
tunity to describe some of what is in 
this budget proposal. First, we are 
going to address the disgrace of the 
United States having the highest rate 
of childhood poverty of almost any 
major country on Earth. This is the 
wealthiest country on Earth, and we 
should not have millions of our chil-
dren living in poverty. 
This budget is going to provide the 
long-awaited-for help that working 
parents all over this country des-
perately need, and when we do that, we 
will substantially reduce childhood 
poverty in America. And we are going 
to do that by extending the child tax 
credit so that families continue to re-
ceive monthly direct payments of up to 
$300 per child. 
We began that process in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. It has been enor-
mously successful in Vermont and all 
over this country as parents finally get 
the help that they need to raise their 
kids, and, in fact, it has helped reduce 
childhood poverty in our country by 61 
percent. And we are going to extend 
those child tax credits. 
Further, we are going to help work-
ing parents by addressing the crisis in 
childcare by making sure that no 
working family in our country pays 
more than 7 percent of their income for 
childcare. And all over this country, in 
talking to parents in Vermont and 
elsewhere, people are paying 20 per-
cent, 25 percent of their income for 
childcare so that they can go to work. 
That makes no sense at all. Under our 
proposal, no working family will pay 
more than 7 percent. And when we do 
that, when we make childcare more af-
fordable and accessible, it will allow 
over a million women who are now 
home with their kids to reenter the 
workforce and improve our economy. 
Further, in terms of addressing the 
needs of our working parents and their 
kids, we will expand public education 
by providing universal pre-K to every 
3- and 4-year-old in the country. 
This budget proposal is going to end 
the 
international 
disgrace 
of 
the 
United States being the only major 
country on Earth not to guarantee paid 
family and medical leave as a right. 
Somebody who is sick today should not 
be forced to go to work and maybe, by 
expanding their illness by contagion,

make other people sick. Parents should 
be able to stay home with their sick 
children. When a woman has a baby, 
she should not be forced back into 
work a week after giving birth simply 
because she has no income to stay 
home. 
Yes, in America, we will join every 
other major country and guarantee 
paid family and medical leave. 
We will begin to address the crisis in 
higher education by making commu-
nity colleges in America tuition-free, 
and this will give millions of young 
people and working people the oppor-
tunity to get the education they need 
to acquire the skills so they can go out 
and get the good-paying jobs that are 
out there. It will also give people the 
opportunity to transfer the 2 years of 
credits earned at a community college 
to a 4-year school. Now, I hope in years 
to come we will go further, but 2 years 
of free community college is no small 
thing. 
This budget proposal begins the proc-
ess of taking on the greed of the phar-
maceutical industry and saving tax-
payers hundreds of billions of dollars 
by requiring that Medicare negotiate 
prescription drug prices with the phar-
maceutical industry. It is not accept-
able to me and to the American people 
that we continue to pay, by far, the 
highest prices in the world for prescrip-
tion drugs. Medicare must negotiate 
prescription drug prices, and this budg-
et sets the stage for that to happen. 
And we will use the savings acquired 
by negotiating prescription drug prices 
in Medicare by expanding Medicare. We 
are going to use those savings to ex-
pand Medicare to cover the dental care, 
the hearing aids, and the eyeglasses 
that seniors desperately need. This is 
the wealthiest country on Earth, and 
yet we have millions of senior citizens 
who lack teeth in their mouth. They 
need dentures; they can’t afford to get 
them. They need hearing aids in order 
to communicate with their grandkids; 
can’t afford to do that. They need a de-
cent pair of glasses; can’t afford that. 
And in terms of healthcare, we will 
also substantially increase the number 
of doctors, nurses, and dentists who 
practice in underserved areas and ex-
pand the Community Health Centers 
Program into new areas as well. 
This budget proposal will combat 
homelessness in America and address 
the reality that nearly 18 million 
households are paying over 50 percent 
of their limited incomes for housing 
through an unprecedented investment 
in affordable housing. We will ensure, 
further, that people in an aging soci-
ety—we are getting older as a society, 
and we will ensure that those people 
can receive the healthcare they need in 
their own homes instead of being 
forced into expensive and inadequate 
nursing homes and that the workers 
who provide that important care to the 
elderly and the disabled are not forced 
to exist on starvation wages. This is 
such important work and such emo-
tionally draining work; those folks de-
serve a decent paycheck. 
We will bring undocumented people 
out of the shadows and provide them 
with a pathway to citizenship, includ-
ing those very brave workers who have 
courageously kept our economy going 
in the middle of a deadly pandemic. 
As I mentioned earlier, we will take 
on the existential threat of climate 
change by transforming our energy 
system toward renewable energy and 
energy efficiency. Among many other 
provisions in terms of climate change, 
we will establish a Civilian Climate 
Corps which will give hundreds of thou-
sands of young people good-paying jobs 
and educational benefits as they roll up 
their sleeves and get to work to help us 
save the planet. 
This budget proposal will make it 
easier, not harder, for workers to join 
unions in America. 
My Republican colleagues are upset 
that we are using the reconciliation 
process and only 50 votes to pass this 
budget. They are very upset about 
that. But let us be clear. This idea of 
using reconciliation is certainly not a 
new idea. When Republicans controlled 
the Senate, they used reconciliation to 
pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks to 
the top 1 percent and large corpora-
tions. 
When 
Republicans 
controlled 
the 
Senate, they used reconciliation to 
make climate change worse by opening 
up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
for oil drilling. 
When 
Republicans 
controlled 
the 
Senate, they tried to use reconciliation 
to repeal the Affordable Care Act and 
throw 32 million Americans off of the 
healthcare they had. 
Well, today, it is true we will also use 
reconciliation, but we will do it in a 
different way. We will use it to help the 
working families of our country and 
not just the wealthy and the powerful. 
It is no great secret that millions of 
Americans are giving up on democracy, 
are moving toward authoritarianism, 
and are losing faith in their govern-
ment. Many of those people are work-
ing longer hours for lower wages; they 
can’t afford healthcare; they can’t af-
ford to send their kids to college; and 
they worry very much about the future 
of their kids and the future of this 
country. 
This legislation will not only provide 
enormous support—unprecedented in 
recent American history—to the chil-
dren in our country, to the parents in 
our country, to the elderly people in 
our country, to the working families of 
our country, but it will also, I hope, re-
store the faith of the American people 
in the belief that we can have a govern-
ment that works for all of us and not 
just the few. 
Thank you. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SINEMA). The Senator from South Caro-
lina. 
Good to see you back. 
Mr. GRAHAM. It is good to be back. 
Thank you for the inquiries about my 
well-being. 
To all my colleagues, I appreciate 
the good wishes and the phone calls 
and the food. 
I made it. I think the worst is behind 
me. 
I want to reinforce a simple message: 
If you haven’t been vaccinated regard-
ing the COVID problem, get vac-
cinated. I have been vaccinated, and I 
got COVID anyway; a couple of really 
bad days, but I am doing better and I 
feel on the mend. And I am confident 
that, if I hadn’t had the vaccine, it 
would have been a lot worse. 
So in my State, about 50 percent of 
the people are still unvaccinated. Just 
for your own good and the good of our 
State, I would urge you to consider 
getting vaccinated. I think the vaccine 
is safe, and it works. I am glad I had it. 
And the sooner we can get to herd im-
munity through vaccinations and other 
means, the better off we will be. 
To all my colleagues and people back 
home, thank you for the kind words 
and inquiries. 
We are back at work, and I am glad 
I was able to make this debate. I think 
this debate is worth having. We just 
passed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. 
The Presiding Officer, Senator SINEMA, 
from Arizona, was one of the architects 
of the bill. 
Congratulations. 
I voted for it because it made sense 
to me. We have been talking about in-
frastructure here for 5 or 10 years. In 
this $1 trillion package, 550 of new 
spending, which I believe will be paid 
for, goes into ports, roads, and bridges, 
and rural broadband; and 19 Repub-
licans voted for it. 
I am hoping we can make it reality 
and get it to President Biden’s desk be-
cause I think infrastructure is much- 
needed, and we were finding bipartisan-
ship in that space. 
Now we are moving on to something 
completely different—I dare say rad-
ical. Right after the majority was 
seized by the Democratic Party, they 
pushed through a $1.9 trillion package 
that had a lot of talk about COVID— 
but most of it wasn’t related to COVID 
as we know it—after we had worked to-
gether on $4 trillion of spending. 
Now, this budget resolution is pro-
posing $31⁄2 trillion of additional spend-
ing, and we will talk about how that 
affects you, the public, here in a 
minute. But the first thing I want you 
to know is it is not $31⁄2 trillion. That 
is not accurate. 
When you look at the increase in 
public debt and the authorization of 
new discretionary spending, it is at 
least $4.2 trillion. So it is not $31⁄2 tril-
lion; it is over $4 trillion. The first 
thing you have to do is be honest with 
the product you are selling. This will 
cost well over $4 trillion if fully imple-
mented. 
What else does this bill do that peo-
ple in this body need to know about? 
It changes the rule regarding emer-
gency spending. Right now, we can 
spend, through an emergency, basi-
cally, unlimited money and not have to 
worry about offsets and all that good 
stuff because there is truly an emer-
gency. But you need 60 votes to declare

something an emergency. This budget 
resolution will change that rule so that 
a simple majority of Senators can de-
termine anything they would like to be 
an emergency and spend without any 
accountability. 
I think that is a bad idea for the body 
because anything you can do, we can 
do, and it really is an assault on the 
idea of minority rights. I think it is 
the biggest blow to the institution yet. 
It is buried in this bill, but it elimi-
nates the 60-vote requirement to de-
clare items emergency spending, re-
place it with a simple majority, allow-
ing a majority—a single party—to 
spend without restriction in the name 
of emergency. 
So to my friends on the other side, 
you need to look at what is in this bill, 
and I hope you will find that to be an 
unacceptable change to the U.S. Senate 
because, when it comes to spending, it 
guts the idea that the minority mat-
ters because all you have to do, if this 
budget resolution is implemented the 
way they have written it, is to declare 
something an emergency, get 50 votes, 
and spend. Very bad idea. We are going 
to try to change that, and we are hop-
ing we can find some bipartisan sup-
port. 
Let me tell you about this bill. I am 
going to ask some questions. On the 
immigration side, Senator SANDERS 
said that this bill creates millions of 
new green cards for people here ille-
gally. 
So here is a question: If we told the 
world that in the budget reconciliation 
we are going to increase millions of 
green cards for people here illegally, do 
you think that would entice more peo-
ple to come here illegally? 
Here is what I think. I think that is 
the dumbest idea I could think of. In 
the middle of an invasion of this coun-
try by illegal immigrants, the Demo-
cratic Party, through budget reconcili-
ation, is going to authorize millions of 
new green cards for people here ille-
gally. It is in your document. Senator 
SANDERS admitted that. 
Here is what is happening as I speak: 
These statements are being translated 
into Spanish and every other language, 
and human traffickers all over the 
world are going to let the word get out 
that, Hey, the Senate is about to in-
crease the number of green cards avail-
able for illegal immigrants; why don’t 
you go and get in line? 
Nobody has asked the Border Patrol: 
How do you think this would affect our 
illegal immigration problem? 
Have you spent 15 minutes talking to 
anybody at the border about what this 
policy change would do to a broken im-
migration system? 
I guarantee you haven’t, because if 
you talked to anybody with common 
sense on the border, they would tell 
you the last thing you need to do right 
now is incentivize more illegal immi-
gration by allocating green cards to 
people who are here already illegally. 
What has happened in the last 6 
months? 
A 262-percent increase compared to 
last year. 
Does any Democrat have any idea 
what is happening here? Have any of 
you come to the floor to explain to the 
American people what the hell is going 
on at the border? 
You don’t have a clue; you don’t care. 
The same people who are writing this 
budget resolution to spend $4 trillion 
on liberal wish lists are the same peo-
ple in charge of the border. They 
haven’t asked one Border Patrol pro-
fessional the effect of this bill on a bro-
ken immigration system. 
We have had 1.2 million people come 
to the country illegally already. Let’s 
compare that to last year—a 262-per-
cent increase. 
Illegal crossings by unaccompanied 
minors have surged 186 percent com-
pared to last year. Why? The Biden ad-
ministration has kept the COVID de-
portation title 42 law in place, but it 
has made exception by unaccompanied 
minors. If you are a certain age, you 
can stay. Guess what. The human traf-
fickers have found that out, and word 
is out all over the Northern Triangle 
countries—but, really, the world. 
And we have had a 186-percent in-
crease in unaccompanied minors be-
cause of policy changes made by the 
Biden 
administration. 
Twenty-seven 
percent of unaccompanied minors re-
cently deported tested positive for 
COVID–19. 
How many of the unaccompanied mi-
nors have been released into the coun-
try? Of the 1.2 million people who have 
come here illegally: How many of them 
have been released? How many have 
them been tested? How many are posi-
tive for COVID? 
Nobody knows these numbers be-
cause nobody seems to have a clue of 
what to do about it. 
So what are the trends? 
Look at this chart. Look at 2020 com-
pared to ‘18, ‘19, and ‘20—an explosion 
of illegal immigrants, 1.2 million, al-
most. Year to date, in 2020, we had 
458,000. A 260-percent increase in illegal 
crossings at the border because the 
Biden administration did away with 
the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. 
So asylum claims went through the 
roof. We are allowing unaccompanied 
children to stay as an exception to 
title 42, along with families. And guess 
what. You have an explosion of illegal 
immigrant crossings in this country. 
If you pass this budget resolution the 
way Senator SANDERS described, you 
are going to throw jet fuel on this. This 
number will go through the friggin’ 
roof. 
Every human trafficker in the world 
is going to get the word out throughout 
the world that they are increasing the 
number of green cards made available 
to illegal immigrants to America: 
Come now, the time is right. 
What a dangerous idea, but it is part 
of this grand, new vision for America. 
Let me tell you about this vision for 
America: open borders; dropping people 
by the thousands off into the interior 
of the United States, not adequately 
tested; enticing young people to take a 
very dangerous journey; destroying all 
of the gains we had; stopping a wall 
that was almost built. That is the vi-
sion being created by the budget reso-
lution and then some. 
The idea of increasing green cards for 
illegal immigrants already here will 
make these numbers explode beyond 
what they already exploded. Only God 
knows. 
Has anyone told you the price at the 
pump? Has anybody mentioned to you 
on the other side what is the cost of 
this bill when we implement change re-
forms to you as a consumer? 
Senator MARKEY, who is a very pas-
sionate believer in climate change, said 
the Green New Deal is part of the DNA 
of this bill. 
Senator SANDERS is an avowed social-
ist, one of the most honest people in 
this building. Senator SANDERS’ vision 
for the last 20 and 30 years is in this 
budget resolution. This budget resolu-
tion is a dream for those who want to 
socialize America; it is a nightmare for 
working people. 
How much have gas prices gone up in 
the last 6 months? 
A dollar. 
Here is what I think: If you imple-
ment the provisions of this budget res-
olution regarding climate change, you 
are declaring war on the internal com-
bustion engine; you are going to shut 
out coal-fired plants in rural America. 
The question I have for my Demo-
cratic colleagues: How much will gas 
prices go up if this bill becomes re-
ality? How much will your heating bill 
go up because you shut down supply? 
How has there been an increase of a 
dollar at the pump? Policy matters. 
I dare say that, if this bill is ever im-
plemented, you are going to double gas 
prices. 
I hope you are listening out there, 
America. If they implement this rad-
ical transformation of our energy econ-
omy, you are going to have a dramatic 
increase of gas prices and heating 
prices. 
This is the worst thought-out idea I 
have ever seen. They are just throwing 
every liberal idea and hope it sticks to 
the wall, and their whole reason for 
being on the left is in this bill. 
There is a border-adjusted carbon tax 
proposal floating around out there. 
What does that mean to you? What the 
hell is a border-adjusted carbon tax? 
The best I can understand is it is 
going to be a tax on products coming 
into the country because the way the 
product was made is not sufficiently 
green enough. So they are going to 
charge for that product, put a tax on it 
at the border. Guess what. That is 
going to increase the cost of whatever 
good we are talking about. 
And where do you think that cost 
goes? 
It goes to you. 
This is the most inflationary idea I 
have ever seen. We have had 5.4-percent 
increase in inflation recently, wiping 
out all the gains in the economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6207 
August 10, 2021 
How could that be? 
You are spending money like drunk-
en sailors. And if this bill ever becomes 
law, if it is ever implemented and there 
is a border-adjusted carbon tax, it is 
going to be passed onto the consumer. 
If you are on a fixed income, this 
whole idea is a nightmare for you be-
cause your gas prices are going to go 
up, your heating bill is going to go up, 
and all of the things that they are 
going to make for free will create an 
inflationary effect. 
The size of the government is going 
to increase dramatically. Interest rates 
will have to go up. So if you own a 
home, you drive a car, you breathe air, 
get ready for more taxes and more 
spending. 
All I can say is that I believe in cli-
mate change, and I would like to have 
a rational approach to solving the 
problem. But this is not rational; this 
is partisan. And this $4.2 trillion bill— 
it is not three and a half—is going to 
lead a wave of illegal immigration, the 
likes of which you have never seen be-
fore; a 262-percent increase in the last 
6 months. If this bill, this idea, ever be-
comes reality, you can double that. If 
this bill ever becomes reality, a dollar 
increase in gas prices is going to be the 
good old days. 
If they shut down all the coal-fired 
plants without any way to replace 
them, other than a bunch of BS, good 
luck with the heating bill. 
They are going to change your coun-
try. It is going to be more like Ven-
ezuela and less like America. 
This idea that it is going to be paid 
for by taxing the rich is a bunch of BS. 
If you took the entire wealth of the 1 
percent, including their cars and their 
dogs, it is less than half of what we 
need to deal with the entitlement prob-
lems we already have. 
And you are growing exponentially 
the size of government—more govern-
ment to pay for. Eventually interest 
rates are going to have to go up. 
You are putting in motion, I think, 
the demise of America as we know it. 
You are putting in motion a govern-
ment that nobody’s grandchild could 
ever afford to pay. You are putting in 
motion the destruction of energy inde-
pendence. You have declared war on 
the fossil fuel industry in this country, 
and you have not done a damn thing 
about China, India, Russia, or Iran. 
The bottom line here is, if you be-
lieve in energy independence, then you 
need to vote against this budget resolu-
tion because we will lose it. If you be-
lieve that inflation is the death blow to 
the middle class, you need to vote 
against this budget resolution. If you 
don’t know how much gas prices are 
going to be increased, they owe you an 
answer. 
So I am going to ask this question 
for the next 15 hours: Do you have any 
idea, if all this becomes reality, how 
much increase at the pump will be af-
fected by the average consumer the 
next year? How much will our heating 
bills go up? As to the border-adjusted 
carbon tax, will it be inflationary? 
Where does the money go from the tax? 
Who gets it? Little details like this. 
All I can say is that everybody has a 
dream in America. There is the Amer-
ican dream and the American socialist 
dream for America. This budget resolu-
tion sets in motion an assault on free 
enterprise, the destruction of energy 
independence, incentivizing illegal im-
migration at a time we can afford it 
the least. 
If you don’t believe these things, 
then you haven’t read what is in this 
blueprint. Have you ever asked your-
self the question: What the hell has 
happened in the last 6 months; why are 
we up $1 a gallon at the pump? Because 
they declared a war on fossil fuels 
made in America. 
Why do we have a 262-percent in-
crease in illegal immigration? Because 
they changed all the policies that 
worked at the border. 
Why is inflation rising? Because the 
fiscal policies of the Biden administra-
tion and our friends on the left are 
driving up prices. 
The worst is yet to come. If this 
budget resolution becomes a reality, 
God help the American middle class. 
We will be less energy independent. Our 
money will go not nearly as far. 
You are going to have to automati-
cally raise taxes if you intend to pay 
for this monstrosity. And some Demo-
crats say it has to be paid for. There is 
no way in hell to pay for this bill un-
less you fundamentally raise taxes 
across the board—at a time when we 
are struggling to get back on our feet. 
This is why we have elections. In 
2022, this idea will be on the ballot. My 
goal and my Republican colleagues’ is 
to fight like hell to stop the increase at 
the pump, stop the increase of the 
heating bills, and to stop an invasion 
in our country by illegal immigrants 
all driven by bad policy choices. 
But everything they have done in the 
last 6 months pales in comparison with 
what they are going to do to this coun-
try if this budget resolution ever be-
comes a reality. 
Yes, sir, we are going to have one 
hell of a fight. I don’t know how long 
we are going to be here, but as long as 
it takes. America is worth fighting for. 
And America, we know, is at risk with 
this budget resolution. 
Thank you.

OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. BAR-
RASSO] proposes an amendment numbered 
3055. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit enactment of the 
Green New Deal) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
TO 
PROHIBIT

The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to Federal greenhouse gas 
restrictions, which may include limiting or 
prohibiting legislation or regulations to im-
plement the Green New Deal, to ship United 
States companies and jobs overseas, to im-
pose soaring electricity, gasoline, home 
heating oil, and other energy prices on work-
ing class families, or to make the United 
States increasingly dependent on foreign 
supply chains, by the amounts provided in 
such legislation for those purposes, provided 
that such legislation would not increase the 
deficit over either the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate equally 
divided. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
am offering this amendment to spare 
the Country from the so-called Green 
New Deal. The Green New Deal is not 
about protecting the environment. It is 
about making Big Government even 
bigger. 
This socialist scheme would destroy 
jobs. It will reduce the quality of life 
for the American people. Millions and 
millions of Americans will suffer. It 
would worsen already high inflation. It 
will drive a stake through the economy 
and eventually bankrupt the Nation. 
Senate Democrats have made it clear 
that they want to use this reckless tax- 
and-spending spree to implement the 
Green New Deal. Just last night, Sen-
ator MARKEY of Massachusetts made 
this statement, he said: ‘‘Without ques-
tion, the Green New Deal is in the DNA 
of this budget resolution.’’ 
Let me repeat. He said: ‘‘Without 
question, the Green New Deal is in the 
DNA of this budget resolution.’’ 
Instead of raising the costs of energy, 
we should be working to lower the 
costs of alternative technologies and

and resolution. 
I would encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the Barrasso amendment and reject the 
job-killing Green New Deal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
Mr. BARRASSO’s amendment is inter-
esting, when he talks about the Green 
New Deal. The only problem is what he 
is talking about has nothing to do with 
the Green New Deal. 
Despite what Senator BARRASSO says, 
the Green New Deal would not ship 
jobs overseas. In fact, it will create 
millions of good-paying jobs in the 
United States of America. It will not 
raise electricity prices. It will not 
make the United States dependent on 
dirty sources of energy from other 
countries. 
In case the Senator from Wyoming 
has missed it, Oregon is burning, Cali-
fornia is burning, Greece is burning. 
There is a drought hitting virtually 
every country on Earth. News flash: 
Climate change is real and the United 
States and other countries have got to 
address it. 
Madam President, as a supporter of 
the Green New Deal, I have no problem 
voting for this amendment because it 
has nothing to do with the Green New 
Deal. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3055 
The

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There

The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the 
amendment that I have called up is 
clear, it is simple, and it is straight-
forward. It makes clear that we are 
going to address the climate crisis. We 
are going to do it through policies that 
do several things: one, create jobs; two, 
create jobs here in the United States; 
policies that strengthen our economy— 
all while reducing the pollution that 
hurts our health and our environment. 
We are in a code red situation. This 
is all hands on deck when it comes to 
the climate crisis. We don’t have a mo-
ment to waste. We need to put politics 
aside and act now on climate change. 
The budget resolution should allow 
us to develop legislation that can re-
spond to the urgent challenge of cli-
mate change. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise to oppose the Carper amendment. 
Let’s be clear. We all want to address 
climate 
change, 
period. 
Now, 
this 
amendment does much more than that. 
Just because you say you want to ad-
dress climate change does not mean 
every policy that you propose is a good 
idea. There can be disagreement. And I 
disagree strongly with the Green New 
Deal policies in this $4.2 trillion bill 
that wastes taxpayer dollars. It costs 
hundreds of jobs, and it hurts our econ-
omy. 
Our economy should be a priority 
here. It should be the priority. We can 
protect the environment without pun-
ishing the economy, and this bill and 
amendment fail that test. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise

which would preserve the longstanding 
step-up in basis for family-owned busi-

value from the prior generation.

Changing this would hit genera-
tionally owned enterprises hard, par-
ticularly in rural communities. And it 
could force families to sell off part of 
the farm or business just to pay the 
new tax. 
Congress tried something similar be-
fore and had to repeal the tax before it 
took effect because it was unworkable. 
Unlike amendment No. 3317, which is 
a side-by-side the Democrats will be of-
fering here temporarily, which would 
simply delay the tax, my amendment 
would provide permanent relief by pre-
serving step-up in basis for all family- 
owned businesses, farms, and ranches. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
it and would add that I have letters of 
support from the National Association 
of Manufacturers, NFIB, Family Busi-
ness Estate Tax Coalition, Taxpayers 
Protection Alliance, Council for Citi-
zens 
Against 
Government 
Waste, 
Americans for Tax Reform, National 
Taxpayers Union, Center for a Free 
Economy, Family Business Coalition, 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship 
Council, and CASE.

Senator wish to call up his amend-
ment? 
Mr. THUNE. I call up amendment No. 
3106 and ask unanimous consent it be

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

The Senator from South Dakota [Mr.

3106. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: 
To 
protect 
owners 
of 
generationally-owned 
businesses, 
farms, 
and ranches so that they may continue to 
transfer ownership or operations to family

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Sen-
ate Democrats take a backseat to no 
one in standing up for family farmers, 
ranchers, and small businesses. In fact, 
President Biden has made it clear that 
any changes to stepped-up basis will 
provide durable protection for family 
farmers, ranchers, and small busi-
nesses. 
Speaking for myself, Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO and Senator TESTER, we are fol-
lowing through on that Biden pledge 
because it is both fair and common 
sense. 
Now, capital gains reform is about 
ensuring that the wealthiest pay their 
fair share. On our watch, multibillion-
aires cannot plant a few tomatoes and 
call themselves a family farmer. 
I will vote for the Thune amendment 
as well as the important Cortez Masto- 
Tester-Wyden amendment that will be 
taken up next.

Our amendment will protect family 
farms, ranches, and small businesses 
while ensuring that the wealthy pay 
their fair share. Family-owned busi-
nesses, farms, and ranches are the 
backbone of the American economy. 
Many of these family-owned businesses 
have held their assets for generations 
and have a deep connection to the land 
they inherit. They are essential for 
feeding America. 
Congress 
should 
protect 
these 
multigenerational, hard-working fami-
lies who have spent a lifetime creating 
jobs, building businesses, and serving 
their communities. We are committed

nesses while ensuring that the top 1

Madam President, I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a

There appears to be a sufficient sec-

The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the support of my colleagues 
in acknowledging the full benefit of 
step-up in basis for all businesses. 
This amendment proposed by the 
Senator from Nevada dilutes that sup-
port. 
As I previously described, the admin-
istration’s proposal would end the ex-
isting step-up in basis tax treatment 
that protects generationally owned 
businesses from tax liability when a 
business is passed on to the next gen-
eration. 
And I might add—I said this earlier— 
this was tried once in the 1970s. CHUCK 
GRASSLEY was here, and he was the guy 
who helped end this because it was un-
workable. So here we are trying to do 
this all over again. 
The 
administration 
suggested 
it 
might include arbitrary exemptions to 
this ill-advised idea, which I think is 
what the Cortez Masto amendment 
speaks to. But, unfortunately, these so- 
called protections for family-owned op-
erations would not provide sustained 
relief and, in practice, would be incred-
ibly difficult to implement—the reason 
they didn’t do it in the 1970s. 
We have never taxed unrealized gains 
in this country. This proposal is a half 
measure that would still punish hard- 
working families and businesses in this 
country, and I urge my colleagues to 
oppose it.

The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
The Senator from Wyoming [Ms. LUMMIS] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3104. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To cancel the Biden Administra-
tion’s ban on oil and gas leasing on Federal 
land to help lower gasoline prices and re-
duce energy dependence on the Organiza-
tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries) 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND

The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-

resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to Federal environmental 
and energy policy, which may include pro-
hibiting any Federal environmental permit-
ting or regulatory action that would prohibit 
or substantially delay new oil and gas, coal, 
hard rock, or critical mineral development 
or requiring the Secretary of the Interior to 
make additional areas of Federal land avail-
able for oil and gas leasing to help lower gas-
oline prices for consumers and to reduce 
United States energy dependence on the Or-
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Coun-
tries, by the amounts provided in such legis-
lation for those purposes, provided that such 
legislation would not increase the deficit 
over either the period of the total of fiscal 
years 2022 through 2026 or the period of the 
total of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Madam President, as 
Americans are trying to enjoy their 
last month of summer vacation before 
the kids go back to school, they are 
facing gasoline prices at a near 7-year 
high. 
What is the Biden administration 
doing about this? They are begging 
Russia and the OPEC oil cartels to 
pump more oil so that U.S. gasoline 
prices don’t rise any more than they 
already have under his watch. Mean-
while, through various Executive ac-
tions, such as the Biden ban on new oil 
and gas industry drilling and develop-
ment and canceling pipelines, this 
President is attacking American work-
ers and American energy independence. 
The oil and natural gas industry sup-
ports 11.3 million jobs across the coun-
try and contributes nearly $1.7 trillion 
to the American economy. It makes no 
sense to send production to other coun-
tries when we could be doing it here, 
produced cleaner, more efficiently. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Ms. LUMMIS. I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, 
Senator LUMMIS’s amendment targets 
new oil and gas leases that the admin-
istration instituted while the Depart-
ment of Interior reviews our Federal 
and oil gas leasing program. I, too, am 
eager to see the results of that review 
and was hoping we would have received 
it by now. 
I will continue to be vocal on my ad-
vocacy for American energy independ-
ence and addressing climate change 
through innovation, not elimination. 
However, drilling continued on existing 
leases throughout the time, and Sec-
retary Haaland testified before the En-
ergy Committee that the Department 
is in compliance with the recent court 
order, which still allows leasing. 
I believe the administration has the 
responsibility to evaluate these pro-
grams and to make sure that we are 
getting a reasonable return for the tax-
payers, while using our abundant re-
sources in the most responsible way. 
For that reason, I urge my colleagues 
to reject the amendment.

amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to offer a bipartisan amend-
ment to promote U.S. competitiveness 
and support American innovation. 
The R&D tax credit provides critical 
support and tax relief to the small 
businesses and startups that power our 
economy. These businesses are job cre-
ators, helping spur innovation in New 
Hampshire and across the country. 
This 
bipartisan 
amendment 
with 
Senator YOUNG would build on efforts 
to expand the R&D tax credit for 
startups, while protecting the tax in-
centives that allow U.S. companies, 
startups, and small businesses to stay 
competitive in our global marketplace 
and out compete China. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and yield my time to the 
Senator from Indiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, now 
more than ever, we must find bipar-
tisan solutions wherever possible to 
stimulate our economy, get Americans 
back to work, and ensure we maintain 
our position on the world stage as the 
leader in scientific and technological 
innovation. 
This 
amendment 
would 
preserve 
funding related to U.S. competitiveness 
and innovation by retaining the full ex-
pensing for research and development 
and expanding tax incentives for small 
businesses. Immediate R&D expensing 
incentivizes long-term investments in 
innovation and technological break-
throughs. 
By passing this amendment, we can 
make sure that the United States con-
tinues to be the world leader in this 
space. 
I understand we are prepared to pass 
this by voice vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). If there is no further debate, the

The

number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Idaho [Mr. CRAPO] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3099. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to preventing the moni-
toring and reporting of sensitive American 
taxpayer information to the Internal Rev-
enue Service by financial institutions 
about deposits and withdrawals made by 
any individual or business in savings, 
checking, or other accounts of as little as 
$600) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO PREVENTING MONI-
TORING AND REPORTING OF SEN-
SITIVE AMERICAN TAXPAYER INFOR-
MATION TO THE INTERNAL REV-
ENUE SERVICE BY FINANCIAL INSTI-
TUTIONS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to strengthening Federal tax 
administration, which may include prohib-
iting the Internal Revenue Service from 
using funds to monitor inflows and outflows 
of deposits or withdrawals in financial ac-
counts of American taxpayers, as well as 
other protections to ensure the privacy of 
taxpayer information, by the amounts pro-
vided in such legislation for those purposes, 
provided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the IRS 
financial institution reporting require-
ment forces financial institutions to 
turn over detailed bank account infor-
mation to the IRS based on vague and 
flexible criteria, such as a $600-thresh-
old, and account inflows and outflows 
would be covered—this all to be deter-
mined by the IRS. 
Think about that. It subjects every 
law-abiding American who has a bank 
account or a credit union account in 
which they transact more than $600 
worth of transactions to have that in-
formation monitored and reported to 
the IRS. 
This is an outrageous violation of the 
privacy of American citizens, and we 
should reject it. 
The community banks and credit 
unions support this amendment, and I 
thank the ICBA, CUNA, the ABA, and 
the NAFCU for their support, as well as 
the Americans for Tax Reform and the 
Center for a Free Economy. 
My amendment prevents the undue 
monitoring and reporting of sensitive 
financial information on law-abiding 
Americans. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Colleagues, a decade of 
Republican budget cuts to the IRS has 
resulted in rampant tax cheating at 
the top. Tax enforcement is going to 
require new resources and new tools to 
crack down on the high-flying tax 
cheats. 
The Crapo amendment would, for all 
practical purposes, preserve the status 
quo—the status quo that has contrib-
uted to the trillion-dollar tax cap 
mushrooming and growing bigger. 
This amendment would make it hard-
er to root out tax cheating, and it is 
unfair to working Americans who pay 
their taxes automatically out of each 
paycheck. 
Shortly—and we are going to reject 
the Crapo amendment—I will offer an 
alternative that will protect the little 
guy without forfeiting the chance to go 
after the big tax cheats, the wealthiest. 
I urge the vote.

AMENDMENT NO. 3365 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. I call up my amend-
ment No. 3365 and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Oregon [Mr. WYDEN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3365. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund relat-
ing to protecting the privacy of American 
taxpayer and small business tax informa-
tion while only reporting large financial 
account balances to the Internal Revenue 
Service, to ensure those evading the tax 
system pay what they owe) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. RESERVE FUND RELATING TO PRO-
TECTING TAXPAYER PRIVACY WHILE 
ENSURING THOSE EVADING THE TAX 
SYSTEM PAY WHAT THEY OWE. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to strengthening Federal tax 
administration, which may include requiring 
reporting on large financial account bal-
ances to ensure those evading the tax system 
pay what they owe while protecting the pri-
vacy of American taxpayer and small busi-
ness tax information, by the amounts pro-
vided in such legislation for those purposes, 
provided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over the period of the total 
of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the IRS 
Commissioner told the Senate Finance 
Committee that, in his judgment, the 
tax gap—the difference between taxes 
paid and taxes owed—is as much as $1 
trillion a year. Current tax gap esti-
mates likely miss a large number of 
the high flyers who clearly are driving 
this tax gap up and up. 
Taxpayers acting to conceal this in-
come from tax authorities are going to 
have a much tougher time if the Con-
gress requires that financial institu-
tions take practical and reasonable 
steps to require that financial institu-
tions report on financial accounts. 
Our interest on our side is to go after 
the big guys who generate significant 
inflows and outflows of cash and other 
assets, and we do it in a way that pro-
tects privacy and sensitive taxpayer 
and small business tax information. 
And this privacy issue has been one of 
the most important issues in my time 
in public service. And we are going to 
make sure that you can get the high 
flyers, the wealthy tax cheats, without 
forfeiting the rights of the little guy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this is 
one of the biggest violations of the pri-
vacy of American citizens to come to 
the floor of the Senate in a long time. 
This amendment would require re-
porting of—and I quote—‘‘large’’ finan-
cial account balances to the IRS. So 
now, instead of $600, they are going to 
say that whatever the IRS says is large 
is what they will require every single 
American, whether they are an indi-
vidual, a small business, or a corpora-
tion owner. Everyone is going to be 
subject to reporting on whatever the 
IRS says is ‘‘large.’’ 
And this comes after another pro-
posal that is coming down the pike to 
double or triple the funding to the IRS, 
so they can monitor the financial 
transactions of American citizens. 
This amendment should be rejected.

has doubled, and natural gas produc-
tion has increased by 60 percent. That 
is helping States like Colorado, New 
Mexico, Pennsylvania. And it rids us of 
our reliance on nations like Saudi Ara-
bia and Russia. 
And, by the way, banning fracking 
would lead to triple-digit oil prices and 
possible global economic shock as per 
the University of Chicago. 
Ironically, a ban on fracking would 
also increase global greenhouse gas 
emissions. Energy Secretary Granholm 
just recently said that the Russian gas 
is ‘‘the dirtiest form of natural gas on 
Earth.’’ And she is right. Emissions 
from Russian natural gas are over 40 
percent higher than ours. 
Democrats’ fracking ban would be 
bad for North Dakota and our Nation 
and the environment, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. 
SANDERS. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
would urge my Republican colleagues 
to read the recent IPCC report. And if 
they did, they would find that it is now 
unequivocal that climate change is 
caused by human activity. 
We are seeing what climate change is 
doing with our own eyes. We can no 
longer be blind to this reality. We are 
seeing the intensity and the increase in 
forest fires. We are seeing more ex-
treme weather disturbances. We are 
seeing rising sea levels that will soon 
threaten the habitability of great 
American cities like Miami, New York, 
and Charleston. We are seeing the 
acidification of the oceans that threat-
en fishing and marine life. And we are 
seeing an increase in disease. 
We have got to move away from fos-
sil fuel. We have got to end fracking. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amend-
ment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, in over a year of uncer-
tainty and the pain of living through a 
pandemic, I have to admit I am 
shocked that I have to come down here 
to talk about the importance of qual-
ity, in-person education. 
Today, we are debating a $4 trillion 
tax-and-spending bill, and that is on 
top of the $2 trillion we spent in March 
and the $4 trillion we spent last year. 
How insane is it that with all that 
spending, there is still no guarantee 
that our kids will be back in school 
this fall? 
The sad reality is, more than 1 mil-
lion kids did not enroll in their local 
schools during the pandemic. Thanks 
to 
labor 
union 
bosses 
and 
their 
unneeded and damaging school shut-
downs, kids have been kept out of 
school, and many—far too many—have 
suffered psychologically. 
For our children’s sake, I urge all my 
colleagues to vote yes on my amend-
ment and to join me in ensuring our 
children are no longer confined to vir-
tual learning. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment. We all agree that in-person 
learning is a top priority this school 
year. Democrats actually passed the 
American Rescue Plan without a single 
Republican vote so schools have the re-
sources to make safe, in-person learn-
ing possible. The CDC also updated its 
guidance 
on 
reopening, 
and 
State 
school districts and schools are work-
ing towards that goal. 
But in addition to ensuring in-person 
learning, we need to encourage adher-
ence to public health guidance, espe-
cially as this Delta variant is surging. 
We also need to support learning and 
the mental health needs of our stu-
dents and much more. There is no dis-
agreement on in-person learning, but 
the Scott amendment falls short on 
these very important points. 
By the way, we need to stop politi-
cizing this issue. 
So I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I agree 
with my colleague that we should stop 
politicizing this issue. All we have done 
for the last several months of this year 
is politicize this issue and every other 
major issue. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3073

The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Florida [Mr. RUBIO], for 
himself and the Senator from Florida, Mr. 
SCOTT, proposes an amendment numbered 
3097. 
The amendment is as follows 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to facilitating the pro-
vision of internet service to the citizens of 
Cuba, who have been deprived of the free 
flow of information by the illegitimate 
communist Cuban regime) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING 
TO 
FACILITATING 
IM-
PROVED INTERNET SERVICE FOR 
CUBAN CITIZENS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to improving the National 
Telecommunications and Information Ad-
ministration, which may include ensuring 
that the internet is an engine for innovation 
and economic growth for the Cuban people, 
by the amounts provided in such legislation 
for those purposes, provided that such legis-
lation would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, we wit-
nessed about a month ago historic and 
unprecedented protests in Cuba as the 
people took to the streets. One of the 
things that has been untold and I think 
now is a greater realization is that one 
of the reasons that is now possible is 
because Cubans had a limited access to 
the internet, which allowed them to 
then go on social media, communicate 
with each other and communicate with 
the world. As a result, they were able 
also to share with the world the true 
brutality of that regime by posting vid-
eos of what was happening. It was the 
first time that people had ever seen it. 
What this amendment does is it cre-
ates a reserve fund within the National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration to help ensure that we 
are doing all we can to provide internet 
access that is unfettered, uncontrolled 
by the regime in Cuba, which actually 
cuts off that access, as it did in the 
middle of these protests—by the way, 
using Chinese technology. 
So this would allow us to pursue how 
we can provide unfettered internet ac-
cess to the people of Cuba. It is some-
thing that I understand has broad sup-
port in this Chamber, even in the ad-
ministration, and I hope we can pass 
this. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
strongly 
support 
the 
gentleman’s 
amendment. In fact, the Biden admin-
istration is in the midst of trying to 
find out what is the greatest techno-
logical ability to create internet access 
for the people of Cuba and limiting the 
ability of the regime to jam that inter-
net access, and I hope that we will see 
this shortly. 
This reserve fund would be in good 
order and in line with what the admin-
istration is seeking to do as well. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3097 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
The amendment (No. 3097) was agreed 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a 
unanimous 
consent 
request, 
if 
I 
might—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the 
Senator from Alabama would withhold, 
the Senator from Vermont is recog-
nized 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I voted 
for the Rubio amendment because, like 
others here and in Cuba, I believe the 
Cuban people have as much right to ac-
cess to the internet as anyone else. No 
government should prevent that ac-
cess, or access to other sources of in-
formation, whether in Cuba or any 
other country. It is a universal right. 
However, we have only the vaguest 
idea of what this amendment envisions, 
how it would be implemented without 
violating 
Cuba’s 
territorial 
sov-
ereignty, or how much it would cost. 
These are important questions that 
need answers. 
I also note that the ‘‘purpose’’ of the 
amendment refers to the ‘‘illegitimate 
communist Cuba regime.’’ We are all 
familiar with that kind of rhetoric, and 
no one who believes in democracy 
would argue that the Cuban Govern-
ment is legitimate, since its leaders 
were not elected in a free and fair 
multi-party election. Cuba is a one- 
party state where political opposition 
is not tolerated. Presumably, that is 
because the Cuban authorities are 
afraid that if they allowed political op-
position parties to operate and a free 
and fair election were held, they might 
be voted out of office. In that sense, it 
is similar to pariah states like Iran and 
Syria, as well as U.S. allies and part-
ners like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, nei-
ther of which permits opposition par-
ties to operate and both of which en-
gage in repression on a scale far larger 
than in Cuba. 
I mention this because when it comes 
to principles of freedom of speech and 
association, we should at least try to 
be consistent. We have an economic 
embargo against Cuba, a tiny impover-
ished country that poses no credible 
threat to us, while we sell billions of 
dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia, 
home to most of the 9/11 terrorists, and 
the perpetrators of the assassination of 
Jamal Khashoggi and the disastrous 
war in Yemen. Saudi women are rou-
tinely discriminated against and im-
prisoned for acts that are protected by 
international law. The death penalty is 
carried out after sham trials. 
None of this is to excuse or justify 
the actions of the Cuban Government. 
But it is interesting that many of 
those who focus their wrath on Cuba 
and support a policy of sweeping sanc-
tions that is contributing to the mis-
ery of the Cuban people, support a very 
different approach toward other repres-
sive governments when it suits them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6215 
August 10, 2021 
(n) SUBMISSIONS.—In the Senate, not later 
than 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this 
amendment provides $50.2 billion to 
meet 
defense 
infrastructure 
needs 
across this Nation. I believe we need to 
modernize 
our 
shipyards, 
our 
test 
ranges, our depots, ammunition plants, 
install 
5G 
technology 
at 
military 
bases, support our nuclear defense in-
frastructure, and so much more. 
These infrastructure projects are ab-
solutely critical to our national secu-
rity. They impact millions of jobs 
across the country, both military and 
civilian. We are talking about projects 
not just in my home State of Alabama 
but in Arizona, Georgia, Virginia, 
Rhode 
Island, 
Connecticut, 
Maine, 
California, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, 
New Mexico, and many more—actually, 
all of us. 
My 
Democratic 
colleagues 
inexplicably blocked a vote on a re-
lated amendment in the infrastructure 
bill that just passed the Senate. Now it 
is time, I believe, to stand up and be 
counted for America, for national secu-
rity. 
Will my Democratic colleagues now 
support this multitrillion-dollar social 
spending binge while continuing to 
turn a blind eye to the military infra-
structure needs in their own States? I 
certainly hope not. 
This reflected neglect of our national 
security and the millions of jobs that 
support it is reckless. It must stop. I 
urge my colleagues to support our mili-
tary and vote yes on this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, this is 
well-intended because there are always 
needs for national defense, but I would 
like to point out that the Armed Serv-
ices Committee, on a bipartisan basis, 
raised the top line of the Defense bill 
this year by $25 billion, allowing us to 
cover the unfunded requirements of the 
Department of Defense. This was not 
only a bipartisan effort; it was over-
whelmingly approved by the com-
mittee. So we are not reneging on a 
commitment to fully fund the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
I know this amendment originated as 
an attempt to amend the infrastruc-
ture bill, but as it is written, this 
amendment would provide over $50 bil-
lion in funding for unspecified uses—it 
could be infrastructure; it could be 
military platforms; it could be a host 
of things—and the fund would extend 
from 2022 to 2031, which is beyond this 
Congress and beyond the current ad-
ministration. 
I think we should adhere to the rules, 
the regular order, which has been con-
ducted in the Armed Services Com-
mittee. I think we have well-positioned 
ourselves for an adequate budget and 
determination of spending this year. 
For that reason, I would urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3293 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask for

AMENDMENT NO. 3251 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I call up amend-
ment No. 3251, and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Iowa, [Mr. GRASSLEY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3251. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prevent changes to the State 
and local tax (SALT) deduction that main-
ly benefit the wealthy) 
On page 52, strike lines 2 through 12 and in-
sert the following: 
SEC. 3001. RESERVE FUND FOR LEGISLATION 
THAT WON’T RAISE TAXES ON PEO-
PLE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 
AND WON’T MAKE CHANGES TO THE 
STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION 
THAT 
MAINLY 
BENEFIT 
THE 
WEALTHY IN THE SENATE. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to changes in revenues, 
without raising taxes on people making less 
than $400,000 or making changes to the Fed-
eral tax deduction for State and local taxes 
which results in a tax cut for those earning 
over $1,000,000, by the 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Now hear me. You 
will be shocked what the Democrats 
want to do in their budget. They want 
to use reconciliation to provide a $120 
billion tax cut to the wealthy through 
SALT relief. The nonpartisan Joint 
Committee on Taxation estimates 51 
percent of the benefit from that repeal 
would go to those making over $1 mil-
lion, while those with incomes under 
$50,000 wouldn’t see any benefit. 
The liberal Tax Policy Center says 
the top one-tenth of 1 percent of house-
holds would receive an average tax cut 
of $144,000 a year. 
Democrats cry the wealthy are not 
paying their fair share, at the same 
time proposing to give billionaires six- 
figure tax cuts. If my Democratic col-
leagues are genuine in their concern 
about the wealthy paying too little 
taxes, their budget is not the way to do 
it. 
So vote to support my amendment to 
impose restrictions on repealing and 
modifying the SALT cap that would re-
sult in tax cuts for the wealthy. 
I reserve my time. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, col-
leagues, our tax bill will be progres-
sive, even though my friend from Iowa 
told you just the opposite. 
Now, the 2017 Trump tax laws specifi-
cally targeted families in the middle 
with tax hikes to pay for some of the 
handouts that Republican colleagues 
wanted to give corporations and the 
megawealthy. 
Over here, on our side, we want to fix 
that mistake, but my friend from Iowa 
is offering an amendment to lock in 
those tax hikes on families in the mid-
dle. 
Democrats are proposing very sub-
stantial tax cuts for working-class 
folks, for the middle class, and what we 
are going to be doing in our tax bill is 
working to make the Tax Code more 
progressive 
by 
ensuring 
that 
the 
megawealthy pay their fair share. 
I mean, we have all seen—and this 
has been documented for quite some 
time—and my colleague from Iowa 
knows that we have exposed these 
mega-IRAs that billionaires have. 
So I just hope my colleagues will re-
ject the Grassley amendment, and 
when we do, I will offer what is truly a 
progressive alternative. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Do I have any time 
left? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
no time remaining. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3251 
Mr. THUNE. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second?

OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Oregon [Mr. WYDEN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3569. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund relat-
ing to increasing the progressivity of the 
tax code) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. RESERVE FUND RELATING TO IN-
CREASING THE PROGRESSIVITY OF 
THE TAX CODE. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to changes in Federal tax 
law, which may include raising taxes on the 
wealthiest 0.1 percent of taxpayers while re-
ducing taxes on low- and middle-income tax-
payers, by the amounts provided in such leg-
islation for those purposes, provided that 
such legislation would not increase the def-
icit over the period of the total of fiscal 
years 2022 through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it takes 
extraordinary chutzpah for Senate Re-
publicans to claim the Democrats want 
to make the Federal Tax Code less pro-
gressive. The Trump 2017 tax law was a 
huge giveaway to the biggest corpora-
tions and the wealthiest individuals. 
Senate Democrats are going to fix 
that in our tax bill. We are going to 
have tax cuts for working people. For 
example, we are going to have tax cuts 
for middle-income people with kids, 
and we are going to make sure that 
those at the top, those multinational 
corporations and the wealthiest indi-
viduals, are going to pay their fair 
share. 
That is going to make the Tax Code 
more progressive and fairer. To vote 
for a progressive fair tax system, you 
have got to support our amendment 
3569. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
Senator from Oregon should have read 
the 2017 tax bill, and he wouldn’t give a 
speech like that. The Wyden amend-
ment is an example of Democrats on 
the one hand complaining the wealthy 
pay too little tax while supporting 
massive tax cuts for the rich. 
Nothing in my amendment prevents 
changes to the Tax Code that would 
make it more progressive. Capping the 
SALT deduction as part of the 2017 tax 
bill increases the progressivity of the 
Tax Code and allowed for larger tax 
cuts to the middle class. Undoing the 
SALT cap would make the Tax Code 
less progressive and jeopardize middle- 
class tax cuts that it helped enable. 
Anyone who supports the wealthy 
paying their fair share should have 
supported my amendment and vote no 
on the Wyden amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6217 
August 10, 2021 
Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.) (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Byrne JAG grant pro-
gram’’) or section 1701 of title I of such Act 
(34 U.S.C. 10381) (commonly known as the 
‘‘COPS grant program’’), to local govern-
ments that defund the police, by the 
amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, believe it or not, people back 
home actually listen sometimes to 
what we say here. 
To some local leaders across the 
country, 
the 
far-left 
rally 
cry 
of 
‘‘defund the police’’ is not just DC rhet-
oric; they are actually acting on it. 
More than 80 percent of law enforce-
ment in America is conducted by State 
and local police departments—80 per-
cent. These men and women are com-
munity heroes. We should invest in all 
of them. But local leaders across the 
country have decided the ‘‘woke’’ thing 
to do is cancel their city’s police force. 
My amendment is pretty simple. If 
your city council wants to defund their 
police, don’t expect the Federal Gov-
ernment to make up the difference. 
The American taxpayers in Alabama 
shouldn’t have to pick up the tab for 
local leaders in Oregon and Minnesota 
who value the ‘‘woke’’ ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ movement over their own com-
munity’s safety. 
I call on my colleagues to support 
our law enforcement by voting yes for 
this amendment. Opposing my amend-
ment is a vote in support of defunding 
the police and against the men and 
women in blue. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I am 
so excited. This is perhaps the high-
light of this long and painful and tor-
tuous night. 
Again, if it wasn’t complete abdica-
tion of Senate procedures and esteem, I 
would walk over there and hug my col-
league from Alabama. 
And I will tell you right now—thank 
God—because there are some people 
who have said that there are Members 
of this deliberative body that want to 
defund the police, to my horror. And 
now this Member has given us the gift 
that finally—once and for all—we can 
put to bed this scurrilous accusation 
that somebody in this great, esteemed 
body would want to defund the police. 
So let’s all of us—100 people—not 
walk but sashay down there and vote 
for this amendment and put to rest the 
lies. I am sure I will see no political 
ads 
attacking 
anybody 
here 
over 
‘‘defund the police.’’ 
And I would ask unanimous consent 
to add something else to this obvious 
bill. Can we add also that every Sen-
ator here wants to fund the police, be-
lieves in God, country, and apple pie. 
Thank you.

AMENDMENT NO. 3731 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I call up my amendment No. 3731 and 
ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Minnesota, [Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR], for herself and others, 
proposes an amendment numbered 3731. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund relat-
ing to honoring the United States Capitol 
Police, the District of Columbia Metropoli-
tan Police, and all other first responders, 
who fought and died protecting Congress 
and the United States Capitol on January 
6, 2021) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. RESERVE FUND RELATING TO HON-
ORING THE CAPITOL POLICE, DC 
METROPOLITAN POLICE, AND FIRST 
RESPONDERS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to honoring the United 
States Capitol Police, the District of Colum-
bia Metropolitan Police, and all other first 
responders, who fought and died protecting 
Congress and the United States Capitol from 
the mob of insurrectionists on January 6th, 
2021, by the amounts provided in such legis-
lation for those purposes, provided that such 
legislation would not increase the deficit 
over the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2031. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
this amendment, which I am intro-
ducing 
with 
Senators 
BOOKER, 
WARNOCK, and SCHATZ, would allow the 
Budget Committee to reallocate fund-
ing for the Capitol Police; Washington, 
DC; and Metropolitan Police and all 
first responders who defended the Cap-
itol on January 6. 
The insurrection at the Capitol was 
more than an assault on democracy; it 
was an actual life-or-death situation 
for the many brave law enforcement of-
ficers who show up here to work every 
single day. 
Last week, we unanimously passed 
legislation, which Senator BLUNT and I 
led, to award the Congressional Gold 
Medal to honor these officers. I was 
proud to stand with President Biden 
when he signed it into law. 
This amendment shows our contin-
ued commitment to remembering the 
heroism and the sacrifice of the first 
responders who risk their lives to pro-
tect this Capitol. 
Before I came to the Senate, I saw 
firsthand the vital role that law en-
forcement officers play in keeping our 
citizens safe. That is why I am not sur-
prised by the last vote and the nature 
of the last vote. 
I thank Senator BOOKER for his re-
sponse 
to 
Senator 
TUBERVILLE’s 
amendment. We also must ensure that 
the officers in this place have the re-
sources they need to do their jobs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. And we took an 
important path forward in passing the 
funding for the police. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
join me in introducing this amend-
ment. I ask all my colleagues to join us 
in voting for it. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3731 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

There appears to be a sufficient sec-

The

The senior assistant bill clerk read as 
follows: 
The Senator from West Virginia [Mrs. CAP-

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-

utilization, 
and 
sequestration 
tech-

The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-

gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to Federal environmental 
and energy policies, which may include sup-
porting or expediting the deployment of car-
bon capture, utilization, and sequestration 
technologies (including technologies that 
may be used on coal- and natural gas-fired 
power plants) in the United States to lower 
emissions and to increase the use of captured 
carbon dioxide for valuable products and en-
hanced oil recovery, by the amounts pro-
vided in such legislation for those purposes, 
provided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
am a strong supporter of carbon cap-
ture, utilization, and sequestration, 
otherwise known as CCUS. 
This technology allows us to turn 
carbon dioxide into a valuable product. 
Some anti-fossil fuel, ‘‘keep it in the 
ground’’ advocates only support CCUS 
when it has nothing to do with fossil 
fuels, and I believe that is a misguided 
approach. 
If we are serious about supporting 
and increasing the number of CCUS 
projects, which I am and many of us 
are, we need to support projects of all 
types of facilities, including on our 
coal- and gas-fired powerplants. We 
also need to support the use of carbon 
dioxide to produce oil through a proc-
ess called enhanced oil recovery. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
yes on amendment No. 3284 and recog-
nize that smart CCUS policies and fos-
sil fuel use can go hand in hand. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
rise also in support of my colleague’s 
amendment. 
Climate change is a global issue. We 
need to deploy all the climate solu-
tions that we can if we are going to 
meet our global climate goals. That in-
cludes coupling the use of our abun-
dant resources with technologies like 
CCUS that will ensure that we can use 
them in the cleanest way possible. We 
need to continue to do more to bring 
down the cost of these critical tech-
nologies and expedite the wide-scale 
deployment 
both 
domestically 
and 
abroad, including in countries like 
China and India, that are aggressively 
expanding their fossil fuel fleets as we 
speak. 
If the United States of America gets 
out of fossil fuels, I will guarantee you 
there won’t be another country to step 
up to the plate to do the research and 
development it takes to combat cli-
mate change. So I urge all my col-
leagues to support this legislation.

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-

nance, or improvement of fossil fuel-burning 
power plants by the amounts provided in 
such legislation for those purposes, provided 
that such legislation would not increase the 
deficit over either the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, 
my amendment will establish a deficit- 
neutral reserve fund to ensure rural 
electric cooperatives remain eligible 
for USDA financing for the construc-
tion, maintenance, or improvement of 
fossil fuel burning plants. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
commonsense approach to ensure that 
the electricity needs of rural America 
continue to be met and, in the future, 
are affordable and reliable. 
The amendment ensures that rural 
Americans continue to have accessible, 
affordable, reliable energy to power 
their 
farms, 
their 
businesses, 
and 
broadband networks in the 21st-cen-
tury economy. 
In order to achieve net zero emis-
sions by 2050, the Department of Agri-
culture has proposed the retirement of 
fossil fuel-burning powerplants in rural 
America. 
So this amendment would protect 
rural America and make sure they 
have reliable and affordable energy.

S6219 
August 10, 2021 
I ask my colleagues for a ‘‘yea’’ vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
unfortunately, I cannot support the 
amendment offered by my good friend 
and ranking member. 
This amendment would restrict the 
USDA’s ability to support a transition 
to clean fuel economies. Rural commu-
nities, especially rural utilities and 
rural electric co-ops, can help lead the 
transition to clean energy and create 
good-paying, clean energy jobs at the 
same time. We know that. We need to 
provide the USDA with the tools and 
the resources and the flexibility to 
make that happen. 
It is important to know that our 
rural partners are asking to be a part 
of this transition. They don’t want an 
amendment that locks them from 
being able to do that. 
We all know that tackling the cli-
mate crisis is imperative. Just yester-
day, the U.N. put out another report 
showing that the climate crisis is spi-
raling out of control. 
Our budget will ensure that the 
United States will not only compete 
but lead the world’s race toward a 
clean energy future, and certainly 
rural America is an important part of 
that. 
So I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.

(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to removing the prohi-
bition on States and territories against 
lowering their taxes) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO THE PROVISIONS OF 
THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the

tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, in the 
11th hour, Democrats added a provision 
in the American Rescue Plan that this 
body did not have time to vet. Under 
this provision, if States took the 
money, they cannot lower their taxes 
in any way through 2024. 
Six Federal lawsuits have already 
been filed, including States like Lou-
isiana, Ohio, and Arizona. West Vir-
ginia is leading a lawsuit with an addi-
tional 13 States, including New Hamp-
shire and Montana. 
States are not happy with this over-
reach. We can fix this mistake now. 
States have the right to cut their own 
taxes, and we have no right to get in 
their way. 
I introduced the Let States Cut 
Taxes Act with DAN BISHOP, of North 
Carolina, to repeal this overstep in the 
American Rescue Plan. A vote for this 
amendment is a vote to protect States’ 
power to impose or cut their own taxes. 
Please join me on this bill across the 
board, and I ask for the yeas and the 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be 
very brief. 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
Gov-
ernors want this. Certainly, on the 
Democratic side, they have expressed 
an interest in expanding tax cuts for 
working families and vulnerable people 
who are still feeling the economic pain. 
Some are interested in expanding low- 
income housing. This helps accomplish 
the goals. 
I support this, and if it is acceptable, 
maybe we can even do it by voice vote. 
(Chorus of ‘‘No’’.) 
Mr. BRAUN. No. It is a rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas 
and nays were previously ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise

This makes no sense whatsoever. 
First of all, our friends—no one voted 
on that side for the ARP. Next of all, 
this was done to help people with the 
programs that were going, who needed 
help. It was not intended to use peo-
ple’s tax dollars to regive them to the 
States so the States could look like 
they were reducing the taxes by not 
using the money. That’s ridiculous. We 
should not be supporting this whatso-
ever. It makes no sense at all.

do not get government subsidies to buy ex-

At the end of title III, add the following:

MEANS-TESTING 
ELECTRIC VEHICLE TAX CREDITS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-

pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to means-testing electric ve-
hicle tax credits, which may include limiting 
eligibility of individuals with an adjusted 
gross income of greater than $100,000 or set-
ting maximum car values allowed for eligible 
purchases at $40,000, by the amounts pro-
vided in such legislation for those purposes, 
provided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, Amer-
icans making over $100,000 a year 
claimed nearly 80 percent of electric 
vehicle tax credits in 2016. 
According to the National Resource 
Defense Council, a leftwing environ-
mental 
advocacy 
group, 
EVs 
cost 
$19,000 more than gas-powered vehicles. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle like to say wealthy Ameri-
cans should pay their fair share in 
taxes. Yet they want to expand the tax 
credit to disproportionately benefit 
even more people with six-figure sala-
ries. 
Everyday Americans are living pay-
check to paycheck because of the sharp 
rise in costs due to inflation, but my 
colleagues on the other side want to 
subsidize luxury vehicles only the rich 
can afford using money from hard- 
working taxpayers, and my amendment 
would put a stop to that. 
It simply prohibits individuals from 
claiming the tax credit if they make 
over $100,000 a year or if the car they 
are buying costs over $40,000. There is 
nothing wrong with the well-off buying 
fancy cars. I just don’t think America’s 
hard-earned taxpayer dollars should 
help to pay for it. 
While I question why we are sub-
sidizing this industry at all, the least 
we can do is to show bipartisan support 
for denying taxpayer subsidies for the 
rich. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we are 
strongly opposed. Senator STABENOW 
will speak for us. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, 
this amendment is just plain anti-pick-
up trucks. Let’s start there. When our 
farmers and small businesses and fami-
lies are buying their next pickup truck 
or SUV, we want them to have the in-
centive to purchase a new all-electric 
truck like we have seen now being pro-
duced by the companies. 
With the price ceiling in this amend-
ment—there is a price ceiling—they 
would not be allowed to receive the in-
centive that consumers buying small 
cars would receive. 
The fact is, more people buy pickup 
trucks and large vehicles than people 
who buy small vehicles. So we elimi-
nate more carbon pollution when peo-
ple who drive trucks and SUVs choose 
all-electric vehicles like the great ones 
that are now coming out into the mar-
ketplace. 
So I would ask you to vote no and 
stand with pickup truck owners across 
the country. 
(Applause.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, we 
have a pickup truck.

products. This ‘‘cow tax’’ will just re-
sult in higher food costs for Americans 
at the grocery store at a time when in-
flation has already caused prices to 
skyrocket. 
This ‘‘cow tax’’ could put our local 
farms out of business. They could dev-
astate our rural communities, which 
are continuing to feed and fuel the 
world. 
I won’t stand by while the Democrats 
force Iowa farmers and ranchers and 
American consumers to pay for their 
over-the-top regulations. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment and keep America’s farm-
ing and ranching operations going and 
food prices affordable for our hard- 
working families. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
would like to speak in opposition to 
the amendment. Let me be clear. Col-
leagues, let me be clear. Let me be 
clear. 
The EPA is not acting to regulate 
methane from cows or any other farm 
animals. This amendment is designed 
as a messaging amendment to suggest 
that the Agency is undertaking actions 
that it is not considering. 
Democrats are working to advance 
policies that assist farmers and ranch-
ers in participating in efforts to ad-
dress greenhouse gas emissions in ways 
that inure to their bottom line. 
Methane is a super climate pollutant. 
It is at least 80 times more powerful 
than carbon dioxide in terms of global 
warming. In order to stem the tide of 
climate change, we must reduce meth-
ane emissions. 
The Biden administration and my 
Democratic colleagues are laser-fo-
cused on making sure our Nation’s 
largest source of methane—the oil and 
gas sector—is doing all it can to reduce 
or eliminate methane emissions. 
The American people should rest as-
sured that no one is focused on regu-
lating cow emissions, as this amend-
ment would suggest. 
I recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote. Thank 
you.

OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

The Senator from Florida [Mr. SCOTT] pro-

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to preventing terrorist 
actions against the United States and its 
allies, and to ensure that United States tax 
dollars do not benefit terrorist organiza-
tions such as Hamas or the Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3004. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RE-
LATING TO FUNDING OF THE OF-
FICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to funding of the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, which may include 
additional resources for enforcement activi-
ties or additional sanctions against terrorist 
organizations, including those in the Gaza 
Strip and their members, by the amounts 
provided in such legislation for those pur-
poses, provided that such legislation would 
not increase the deficit over either the pe-
riod of the total of fiscal years 2022 through 
2026 or the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2031. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, earlier this year, we saw Hamas 
rockets rain down on Israel for 11 
straight days. Children, like 5-year-old 
Ido Avigal, died in these attacks. 
Following these attacks on Israel, 
President Biden’s State Department 
said it couldn’t guarantee that funding 
wouldn’t go to Hamas. That is unac-
ceptable. 
We have seen horrible anti-Israel sen-
timent permeate the Halls of Congress. 
But we cannot, and I will not, accept 
the ignorance of some of my colleagues 
to the evil and devastation Hamas ter-
rorists bring to Israel. 
My amendment will ensure that any 
money authorized to the territory of 
Gaza will not end up in the hands of 
Hamas terrorists and allows for further 
sanctions 
against 
these 
terrorist 
groups. 
This amendment is a commonsense 
way to protect American tax dollars, 
stand with our great ally Israel, and to 
continue our fight against the evils of 
Hamas terrorism. 
I hope all of my colleagues will vote 
for this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey is recognized. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the 
U.S. Government already has laws in 
place to prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars 
from going to terrorist organizations 
and laws that specifically prevent 
funds from going to Hamas and Pales-
tinian Jihad. 
So this is purely a messaging amend-
ment that does absolutely nothing in 
practice, but it is a message we can all 
get behind. And because Democrats 
stand against terrorist organizations 
that threaten innocent civilians in 
Israel and anywhere else in the world, 
we support the amendment, and we 
would urge the Senator to take a voice 
vote. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3383 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I ask for the

AMENDMENT NO. 3444 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I call 
up Young amendment No. 3444 and ask 
that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Indiana [Mr. YOUNG] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3444. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prevent tax increases that 
would violate President Biden’s repeated 
promise to not impose a single penny in 
tax increases on people making less than 
$400,000 per year) 
On page 53, line 8, strike the period and in-
sert ‘‘, except that no adjustment shall be 
made pursuant to this subsection if such leg-
islation raises taxes on people making less 
than $400,000.’’. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, over 
60 times during their campaign and 
since taking office, President Biden 
and 
Vice 
President 
HARRIS
have 
pledged not to raise one single penny in 
taxes—not one single penny—on any-
one making less than $400,000 a year. 
Today, my Democratic colleagues are 
using this budget to try to pull a fast 
one on the American taxpayers by giv-
ing lip service to this pledge while pro-
posing tax hikes that will largely be 
borne by middle- and working-class 
Americans. For example, it is well-un-
derstood that a significant portion of 
corporate tax hikes are borne by Amer-
ican workers in the form of fewer job 
opportunities 
and 
reduced 
wage 
growth. 
Now, while my colleagues included a 
nominal mention of the tax pledge in 
the underlying budget, importantly, 
the budget’s reserve fund for the up-
coming $31⁄2 trillion reckless tax-and- 
spend bill is not conditioned on that 
pledge. So this amendment will pre-
vent 
Congress 
from 
breaking 
the 
Biden-Harris tax promise to pay for 
reconciliation. 
As President Biden said: 
Not one penny. It’s a guarantee. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
Madam 
President, 
President Biden did, in fact, make it 
clear there would be no tax increase for 
anybody who makes up to $400,000 a 
year, and Democrats are going to stand 
by that commitment. In fact, Demo-
crats are proposing tax cuts for work-
ing-class and middle-class families, 
along with changes to make sure that 
corporations and the very wealthy fi-
nally pay their fair share. This amend-
ment is in line with that approach. 
I am voting aye.

The

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral

At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO ABORTION FUNDING. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-

pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference

grams, which may include prohibiting fund-
ing for abortions consistent with the Hyde 
amendment or limitations on Federal fund-
ing to State or local governments that dis-
criminate against entities who refuse to par-
ticipate in abortion consistent with the 
Weldon amendment, by the amounts pro-
vided in such legislation for those purposes, 
provided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this 
amendment would add language to pro-
hibit funding for abortions consistent 
with the longstanding Hyde amend-
ment, which has been the law of the 
land since 1976. 
The Hyde amendment has enjoyed 
decades of bipartisan support, includ-
ing from then-Senator Joe Biden, and 
it has been signed into law by Demo-
cratic and Republican Presidents alike. 
The Hyde amendment reflects a dec-
ades-long consensus that millions of 
Americans who are profoundly opposed 
to abortion should not be forced to pay 
for the taking of human lives of chil-
dren or incentivize it with their tax-
payer dollars. A 2020 Marist poll found 
that 60 percent of Americans, including 
37 percent of people who identify as 
pro-choice, oppose the use of their tax-
payer dollars to pay for abortions. 
Similarly, the Weldon amendment 
has been in law since 2004. It protects 
individuals from being forced to par-
ticipate in abortion if it would violate 
their conscience. 
Millions of Americans of faith and of 
no faith know that the only difference 
between a child in the womb and out-
side the womb is time. Just because 
they are smaller people doesn’t mean 
they should be any less protected by 
law. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this 
amendment is a serious threat to wom-
en’s safety that would allow someone 
else’s personal beliefs rather than a pa-
tient’s best interests determine a pa-
tient’s care.

Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I call

that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Alaska [Mr. SULLIVAN] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3627. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to prohibiting renew-
able energy projects receiving Federal 
funds and subsidies from purchasing mate-
rials, technology, and critical minerals 
produced in China) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO ENSURING ROBUST, 
SECURE, 
AND 
HUMANE 
SUPPLY 
CHAINS, SOURCED BY THE UNITED 
STATES AND ALLIES OF THE UNITED 
STATES, FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY 
MATERIALS, 
TECHNOLOGY, 
AND 
CRITICAL MINERALS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to Federal energy policy, 
which may include ensuring robust, secure, 
and humane supply chains for renewable en-
ergy products and critical minerals and pro-
hibiting 
or 
limiting 
renewable 
energy 
projects funded or subsidized by Federal 
funds 
from 
purchasing 
materials, 
tech-
nology, and critical minerals produced in 
China, by the amounts provided in such leg-
islation for those purposes, provided that 
such legislation would not increase the def-
icit over either the period of the total of fis-
cal years 2022 through 2026 or the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, my 
amendment would ensure that Federal 
funds used toward the technology and 
materials we need to advance our re-
newable energy sector is made and 
mined in the United States and by our 
allies, not by the Chinese Communists. 
We are currently dangerously reliant 
on China for roughly 80 percent of ma-
terials and minerals vital to the U.S. 
renewable energy sector and to our na-
tional security. 
It is not only dangerous to our na-
tional security to be so reliant on 
China, but it is also inhumane. China is 
using Uyghur forced labor to source 
many of America’s alternative energy 
imports. 
We have these resources right here in 
the United States, and by developing 
our national supply chains, we can cre-
ate thousands of good-paying jobs, pro-
tect our national interests, and deny 
support to the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
However, far too often, extreme envi-
ronmental groups seek to block domes-
tic critical mineral production right 
here at home. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. We need to produce 
these materials here, not in China, and 
I ask my colleagues to vote yes for this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is a 
challenging 
amendment 
that 
deals 
with unfair competition from China. 
I am going to vote yes, and when we 
are done with this amendment, I will 
offer a more targeted approach to re-
strict the purchase with Federal funds 
from any country of products produced 
with forced labor.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following the 
Paul amendment, the following amend-
ments be in order, the amendments be 
reported by number with no amend-
ments in order prior to a vote in rela-
tion to the amendment: Baldwin 3648,

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up

be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Oregon [Mr. WYDEN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3805. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund relat-
ing to ensuring robust, secure, and humane 
supply chains by prohibiting the use of 
Federal funds to purchase materials, tech-
nology, and critical minerals produced, 
manufactured, or mined with forced labor) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. RESERVE FUND RELATING TO EN-
SURING ROBUST, SECURE, AND HU-
MANE SUPPLY CHAINS BY PROHIB-
ITING THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS 
TO PURCHASE MATERIALS, TECH-
NOLOGY, AND CRITICAL MINERALS 
PRODUCED, 
MANUFACTURED, 
OR 
MINED WITH FORCED LABOR. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to ensuring robust, secure, 
and humane supply chains by prohibiting the 
use of Federal funds to purchase materials, 
technology, and critical minerals produced, 
manufactured, or mined with forced labor by 
the amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over the 
period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mr. WYDEN. Colleagues, I am going 
to be very brief. 
This amendment prohibits the use of 
Federal funds to purchase materials, 
technology, and critical minerals pro-
duced, manufactured, or mined with 
forced labor from any country. 
All supply chains need to be robust, 
secure, and free from these horrendous 
labor practices, like the genocidal 
forced labor practices in the Uighur re-
gion of China. 
It is not enough, colleagues, to ban 
China alone, while forced labor con-
tinues to be a problem in many nations 
around the world. For this reason, I 
urge the support of this amendment to 
ensure that our supply chains align 
with these American values. 
And I am willing to do a voice vote, 
Mr. President. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I also 
urge adoption of the Wyden amend-
ment, when he is talking about forced 
labor. But I want to point out one im-
portant issue. 
The amendment that we just voted 
on, my amendment, which bans the use 
of Federal funds on renewable projects, 
critical minerals from all of China, was 
opposed by the vast majority of the 
far-left environmental groups in Amer-
ica. 
They want to be able to import these 
products from China, even though we 
have them and we have the minerals. 
So there is a difference between the 
Wyden amendment and the Sullivan 
amendment. I urge its adoption, but 
let’s not be fooled here. The far-left, 
green agenda is to import products 
from China and not allow mining and 
critical mineral production in Amer-
ica. That is wrong. 
I am glad my amendment just passed, 
but I urge adoption of the Wyden 
amendment as well. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3805 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
sponsor of the amendment has asked 
for a voice vote. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
The amendment (No. 3805) was agreed 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3150 
(Purpose: In the nature of a sub-
stitute.) 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment 3150 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3150. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. PAUL. Isn’t it ironic that during 
today’s long debate, we have not heard 
a word of the actual subject at hand: 
the budget? 
The budget presented by the Demo-
crats has been entirely ignored by both 
parties. But if you read it, the Demo-
crat budget before us is a blueprint for 
bankruptcy. 
The 
Democrat 
budget 
never balances and spends and borrows 
$15 trillion over 10 years. Already, our 
national debt exceeds $28 trillion. We 
borrow $2 million a minute. 
Now, Republicans have largely been 
united in believing in a constitutional 
amendment to balance our amendment 
in 5 years. In fact, many of the Mem-
bers have voted for that. 
What I have presented today is an al-
ternative to the Democrat budget. This 
is a budget that balances in 5 years, 
and I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Sen-
ator PAUL’s amendment would slash 
Federal spending by trillions of dollars. 
It would mean massive cuts to Medi-
care, to Medicaid, to food stamps, to 
virtually every Federal program that 
impacts working people and low-in-
come people. It would cause massive 
suffering. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 3150

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 10, 2021 
SEC. 3004. RESERVE FUND RELATING TO GREAT 
LAKES ICE BREAKING OPERATIONAL 
IMPROVEMENTS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to improving Coast Guard 
operations, which may include funding for 
the acquisition, design, and construction of a 
Great 
Lakes 
heavy 
icebreaker, 
by 
the 
amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over the 
period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the BALDWIN, 
SMITH, GILLIBRAND, PETERS, and DUR-
BIN amendment that will help support 
good-paying union jobs, address the im-
pacts of climate change on the Great 
Lakes, and support billions of dollars 
in revenue and wages. 
The U.S. Great Lakes waterborne 
commerce supports more than 147,000 
jobs in eight Great Lakes States. This 
is made possible by the Coast Guard’s 
Great Lakes icebreakers that ensure 
ships can safely transit in and out of 
our ports in the winter. Unfortunately, 
the number of icebreaking vessels on 
the Great Lakes has declined, resulting 
in economic loss, including an esti-
mated 5,400 jobs in the 2018–2019 winter 
season. 
Additionally, climate change is re-
sulting in more heavy-ice winters and 
increasing intensity and frequency of 
extreme storms that are impacting ice 
cover thickness and unpredictable ice 
floes. 
My amendment would ensure that 
the 
Great 
Lakes 
has 
sufficient 
icebreaking capacity and keep our Na-
tion’s economy moving forward. Chair 
CANTWELL supports the Great Lakes 
icebreaker, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this amendment and 
ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of the Baldwin amendment. I 
appreciate Senator BALDWIN’s interest 
in making sure that the Coast Guard 
has adequate icebreaking in the Great 
Lakes. 
I will note that there is currently no 
funding for the Coast Guard in the 
Democrats’ budget resolution, and I 
hope that the vote we are about to 
have will show support for icebreakers. 
And perhaps Democrats will regret 
their decision to exclude the Coast 
Guard from the Commerce Commit-
tee’s allocation of over $80 billion. 
But I do support the amendment. The 
ranking member of the Budget Com-
mittee also supports the amendment.

(Purpose: To prevent reconciliation legisla-
tion from including trillions of dollars in 
job-killing tax hikes) 
On page 46, strike lines 17 through 21. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, my 
amendment is very simple. It elimi-
nates the instruction to the Senate Fi-
nance Committee whereupon people 
would be able to have their taxes in-
creased. 
If you want to have taxes go up in 
this country on corporations or people, 
vote against my amendment. If, in-
stead, you want to make sure taxes are 
not raised on corporations or people, 
vote for my amendment. Simple as 
that. 
I ask people in this audience who 
want to keep taxes down, vote yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
This 
amendment 
strikes the Finance Committee’s entire 
reconciliation instructions from the 
budget resolution. 
Colleagues, this would prevent the 
Senate from lowering the cost of pre-
scription medicine for all Americans. 
It would prevent fighting the climate 
crisis with clean energy tax cuts, pro-
viding 
home 
and 
community-based 
services for the elderly and disabled, 
prevent us from creating a national 
paid leave program, and cutting taxes 
for working families. It would also 
make it impossible for the subsequent 
reconciliation bill to be paid for. 
I will just wrap up. I urge strongly 
that we oppose this measure because it 
would stop cold the effort to support 
policies crucial to the American fam-
ily, and I urge its rejection.

The amendment (No. 3652) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3795 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I call up 
my amendment No. 3795, and I ask that 
it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MORAN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3795. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to immigration en-
forcement and addressing the humani-
tarian crisis at the southern border) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING 
TO 
IMMIGRATION 
EN-
FORCEMENT AND ADDRESSING THE 
HUMANITARIAN 
CRISIS 
AT 
THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to immigration enforce-
ment, which may include strengthening en-
forcement of immigration laws to address 
the humanitarian crisis at the southern bor-
der, dramatically increasing funding for 
smart and effective border security meas-
ures, improving asylum processing, and re-
ducing immigration court backlogs, by the 
amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, there is 
no denying that we have a humani-
tarian crisis at the southern border. I 
have witnessed this personally. Just 
last 
month, 
Customs 
encountered 
200,000 individuals attempting the dan-
gerous and deadly trek across the 
southern border. At least tens of thou-
sands of these individuals have been re-
leased into our country without an of-
ficial court date. 
The Biden administration’s rollback 
of immigration laws has not only mag-
nified the humanitarian crisis, but it 
has left our law enforcement with the 
impossible task of trying to slow the 
flow of illegal crossings while also at-
tempting to stop drugs, weapons, and 
human trafficking entering our coun-
try. 
My amendment simply states that we 
must enforce our existing immigration 
laws to address the humanitarian crisis 
and to increase resources for smart and 
effective border security, improve asy-
lum processing, and reduce immigra-
tion court backlogs. 
Voting no on this amendment signals 
a refusal to acknowledge we have a hu-
manitarian crisis on our southern bor-
der and an unwillingness to support our 
existing immigration laws. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
this straightforward amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at my 
request this amendment incorporates 
language reflecting Democratic prior-
ities funded by the budget resolution, 
including smart and effective border 
security measures like nonintrusive in-
spection systems, hiring additional 
Customs officers for screening at law-
ful ports of entry, hiring additional im-
migration judges and asylum officers 
to reduce backlogs and enhance the ef-
ficiency and fairness of the asylum sys-
tem. 
I thank the Senator from Kansas for 
accepting these changes, and I support 
his amendment.

The amendment (No. 3795) was agreed

The

(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
amendments be in order; that the 
amendments be reported by number, 
with no amendments in order prior to a 
vote in relation to the amendment: 
Cotton, No. 3680; Blackburn, No. 3062;

The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. COTTON] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3680. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to prohibiting the 
teaching of critical race theory in pre-
kindergarten programs and elementary 
and secondary schools) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO PROVIDING QUALITY 
EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to providing quality edu-
cation for the children of the United States, 
which may include prohibiting or limiting 
Federal funding from being used to promote 
critical race theory or compel teachers or 
students to affirm critical race theory in 
prekindergarten 
programs, 
elementary 
schools, and secondary schools, by the 
amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, growing 
up I was taught, as I suspect most of 
you were, that America is a great, 
noble nation, in large part because, as 
Lincoln put it, it is ‘‘dedicated to the 
proposition that all men are created 
equal.’’ 
In America, our rights have no color, 
our law and society should be color-
blind, and as Dr. Martin Luther King 
said, we should not be judged by the 
color of our skin, but by the content of 
our character. 
Sadly, today, some want to replace 
our founding principles with an un- 
American ideology called critical race 
theory. They want to teach our chil-
dren that America is not a good nation 
but a racist nation. Those teachings 
are wrong, and our tax dollars should 
not support them. 
My amendment will ensure that Fed-
eral funds are not used to indoctrinate 
kids as young as pre-K to hate Amer-
ica. Our future depends on the next 
generation of kids loving America and 
loving each other as fellow citizens, no 
matter their race. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
the amendment.

August 10, 2021 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, you 
know, this amendment is simply an at-
tempt to force the Federal Government 
to interfere with local school district 
decisions about curriculum and aca-
demic instruction. 
There are several longstanding provi-
sions in Federal education law that 
prohibit the Federal Government from 
mandating or directing school cur-
riculum. This amendment would con-
tradict that bipartisan consensus and 
allow the Federal Government to have 
a say over what schools can and cannot 
teach our children. 
I oppose this amendment because I 
believe States, local school districts, 
and educators should be in the driver’s 
seat when making decisions about cur-
riculum, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote no. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Tennessee [Mrs. BLACK-
BURN] proposes an amendment numbered 
3062. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike the Senate emergency 
legislation provision) 
On page 55, strike line 24 and all that fol-
lows through page 58, line 13. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this amendment maintains what has 
been the existing right of any Senator 
to weigh in on the special treatment 
we give to designated funds. 
As it stands, this current budget res-
olution would destroy that right and 
allow a simple majority of Senators 
free rein to declare anything and ev-
erything an emergency. Without this 
amendment, fiscal discipline will go 
out the window, along with the rules 
laid out in the Budget Act and any 
chance of countering the Biden admin-
istration’s reckless socialist agenda. 
The existing rule worked for bipar-
tisan COVID relief, and it will continue 
to work for this body. There is nothing 
broken here to fix. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
in opposition to this amendment that 
makes it more difficult for Congress to 
respond to an emergency when one oc-
curs. 
Let us be clear. There is no reason to 
hold up Federal dollars to help people 
recover from a natural disaster while 
Congress searches for revenue or spend-
ing cuts to pay for emergency assist-
ance. 
This amendment would create a 
supermajority hurdle for the Senate to 
declare something an emergency. When 
people are suffering after a hurricane 
or a wildfire, we should not be creating 
additional barriers to them getting the 
help they need. 
Congress has provided exemptions for 
emergency spending ever since the 
budget process started a pay-as-you-go 
system. This helps Federal dollars re-
spond to emergencies in a more timely 
manner. 
Importantly, the 60-vote threshold 
still exists for emergency legislation, 
meaning any bill that includes emer-
gency spending will still face a 60-vote 
hurdle. There is simply no need to 
make getting urgently needed money 
out of the door one step harder. I urge 
my colleagues to vote no on this 
amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6228 
August 10, 2021 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3781. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to ensuring that the 
Department of Homeland Security, pursu-
ant to title 42, United States Code, con-
ducts expulsions of illegal immigrants who 
may contribute to the spread of COVID–19, 
including any of the dangerous variants 
originating overseas, in order to protect 
the public health of the American people, 
save American lives, and assist in eradi-
cating the COVID–19 pandemic in the 
United States) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3004ll.DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO SECURING THE BOR-
DER, INCLUDING BY PREVENTING 
OR LIMITING THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND 
SECURITY 
FROM 
DE-
PARTING FROM THE MARCH 20, 2020, 
ORDER ISSUED BY THE CENTERS 
FOR DISEASE CONTROL. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to securing the border and 
public health, which may include preventing 
or limiting the Department of Homeland Se-
curity from departing from the March 20, 
2020, order issued by the Centers for Disease 
Control under sections 362 and 365 of the 
Public Health Service Act, by the amounts 
provided in such legislation for those pur-
poses, provided that such legislation would 
not increase the deficit over either the pe-
riod of the total of fiscal years 2022 through 
2026 or the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2031. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment ensuring that the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security continues 
to have the legal authority to expel il-
legal 
immigrants 
who 
may 
have 
COVID–19 under title 42 of the U.S. 
Code to protect Americans from the 
spread of this deadly pandemic. 
There is a crisis at our border caused 
by this administration’s policies, and 
the fact is that our open borders and 
unlimited illegal immigration coming 
into this country are contributing to 
the spread of COVID–19 and to the dan-
gerous Delta variant. For example, 
McAllen, TX, one city in the Rio 
Grande Valley, has a population of 
141,000 people. But this year alone, the 
Biden 
administration 
has 
released 
more than 7,000 illegal aliens who have 
been positive for COVID–19. In fact, 
this week alone, 1,315 illegal aliens 
were released positive with COVID–19. 
This is a serious public health crisis. 
Title 42 gives the administration the 
authority to protect public health 
against this pandemic. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, the 
Biden administration inherited both 
the COVID–19 public health crisis and 
the dismantling of the immigration 
system from the previous administra-
tion. 
This amendment would tie the Biden 
administration’s hands in addressing 
arrivals at our southern border. It 
would prevent adapting to changes in 
public health needs and making secu-
rity-based decisions related to pro-
tecting our homeland. 
Forcing the indefinite preservation of 
title 42 authorities raises both security 
and humanitarian concerns. This would 
prevent the imposition of the con-
sequence-delivery system that cracks 
down on individuals who attempt to 
cross the border repeatedly. We should 
not have to expel the same person for 
illegally crossing the border six or 
seven times. We need to expel them 
once and use tools like removal and 
prosecution to limit their ability to 
keep crossing the border illegally. 
This amendment also reduces the ad-
ministration’s ability to appropriately 
care for unaccompanied minors. 
We need to ensure that the adminis-
tration has every tool at their disposal 
as they work to tackle the pandemic 
and keep our Nation secure. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
amendment.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Missouri [Mr. HAWLEY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 2734. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to hiring 100,000 new 
police officers nationwide to combat the 
crime wave in the United States) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO HIRING 100,000 NEW 
POLICE OFFICERS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to public safety, which may 
include funding the hiring of 100,000 new po-
lice officers nationwide, by the amounts pro-
vided in such legislation for those purposes, 
provided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of hiring more law en-
forcement officers across this coun-
try—100,000 more, to be precise. And 
here is why. We are in the midst of an 
unprecedented crime wave in this coun-
try, a crime wave of violent crime, and 
our families and our children are in the 
crosshairs. 
This past year, the murder rate in 
this country rose, year over year, high-
er than anytime in six decades. This 
past year, the FBI reports that fatal 
felony attacks on law enforcement offi-
cers spiked by over 50 percent. In St. 
Louis, MO, my home State, 262 resi-
dents were killed in 2020. That is the 
highest number in over half a century. 
Cops are being targeted. Families are 
being targeted. Children aren’t safe on 
the streets. We need to take action now 
to put more law enforcement officers 
on our streets to protect our families. 
Now, I recognize that my friends 
across the aisle say they don’t want to 
defund the police. That is outstanding. 
Let’s go a step further. Let’s fund 
them. Let’s put 100,000 new cops on the 
streets right now to protect our fami-
lies, to protect our children. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second?

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this has 
been a historic day in the U.S. Senate. 
We started by passing a bipartisan in-
frastructure bill that made history, 
and now the Senator from Missouri is 
finally coming around to supporting 
the COPS Hiring Program that was 
created by Senator Joe Biden in 1994. 
Since its creation, the COPS Pro-
gram—listen to this—has helped over 
13,000 local police departments hire 
over 134,000 officers. We believe in it on 
the Democratic side. We are glad you 
have come around. 
We sent a letter to the Appropria-
tions Committee, signed by 37 Demo-
crats, for the COPS Program. Do you 
know how many Republicans signed 
the letter? None. But with your amend-
ment tonight, clearly you have come 
around. The Republicans are joining 
the 
Democrats 
in 
supporting 
Joe 
Biden’s COPS Program. You are right: 
We need 100,000 more police. And we 
stand with Joe Biden’s program and 
are glad that you have joined us.

AMENDMENT NO. 3243 
Mr. HOEVEN. I call up my amend-

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. 
HOEVEN] proposes an amendment numbered 
3243. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to preventing elec-
tricity blackouts and improving electricity 
reliability) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO PREVENTING ELEC-
TRICITY BLACKOUTS AND IMPROV-
ING ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to Federal environmental 
and energy policies, which may include pro-
moting the increased deployment and use of, 
or supporting the expansion of, baseload 
power resources in the United States, includ-
ing coal-fired and natural gas-fired power 
plants with carbon capture, utilization, and 
sequestration 
technologies 
and 
nuclear 
power to prevent blackouts and improve 
electric reliability, by the amounts provided 
in such legislation for those purposes, pro-
vided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mr. HOEVEN. This amendment en-
sures we continue to support policies 
that make our country an economic 
powerhouse, as well as keeping heating 
and cooling costs low for Americans, 
and that means protecting access to re-
liable, affordable energy. 
The North American Electric Reli-
ability Corporation recently warned 
that numerous areas of the country are 
at an elevated or high risk of experi-
encing blackouts or brownouts. This 
warning is not limited only to Cali-
fornia and Texas; it also included most 
of the West, New England, and the 
upper Midwest. 
My amendment promotes more base-
load power, specifically from coal-fired 
and natural gas power plants with car-
bon capture, as well as nuclear power. 
Instead of new taxes or the Green 
New Deal, we should be expanding ac-
cess to power generation from re-
sources available 24/7, regardless of 
weather conditions. 
We are the world’s leading economy 
with vast energy resources, and black-
outs and brownouts are simply not ac-
ceptable. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
this amendment to keep the lights on, 
energy costs low, and harness our 
abundant baseload resources with im-
proved environmental stewardship. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
just yesterday, the world’s scientists 
offered an unequivocal warning to us 
about the condition of our planet. 
Every single one of us has a home 
State university that teaches climate 
science, and if we ask them, they will 
confirm that warning; and yet we re-
lentlessly subsidize the fossil fuel in-
dustry, which floats already on a $600 
billion annual subsidy in this country, 
according to the International Mone-
tary Fund. 
Enough is enough. Our grid operators 
almost everywhere do a good job with 
reliability, and we have just added bil-
lions of dollars to improve grid reli-
ability. 
There is no reason whatsoever to put 
another thumb on the scales for this 
already heavily subsidized industry 
when most of these blackouts and 
brownouts 
are 
driven 
by 
extreme 
weather caused by the climate change 
from their pollution. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would 
note that I referenced carbon capture, 
as well as other environmental prac-
tices that we are taking, to lead the 
world in producing not only abundant, 
affordable baseload energy, but also 
with the latest, greatest technology in 
an environmentally friendly way. I 
would note the good Senator has joined 
with me on legislation to do that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the amendment.

The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MARSHALL],

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to protecting migrants 
and local communities against COVID–19) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND

GRANTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
AGAINST COVID–19. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the

gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to protecting migrants and 
local communities against COVID–19, which 
may include resources for testing and treat-
ment of migrants at the United States bor-
der, resources for quarantining migrants who 
test positive, or prohibiting migrants who 
have not received a negative COVID–19 test 
from being transported elsewhere, by the 
amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, as 
we all work to address vaccine hesi-
tancy and anxiously await full ap-
proval of the COVID–19 vaccines, open 
border policies undermine these ef-
forts. Americans can travel to Mexico 
City but not return to America without 
a COVID test, while an illegal immi-
grant has no test requirements, and in 
just a few days, it will be easier to ille-
gally cross our southern border than go 
to a restaurant or a bar in New York 
City. 
Some estimates would suggest hun-
dreds or, perhaps, even thousands of 
COVID-positive 
illegal 
immigrants 
enter our Republic every day. That 
means we have a superspreader event 
at our southern border every single 
day, and Americans are watching this 
public healthcare crisis. In McAllen, 
TX, almost 1,500 new infected migrants 
were released into their communities 
this past week alone. 
There is a healthcare crisis at our 
southern border, and it is unacceptable 
for the government to be transporting 
illegal migrants who pose a grave risk 
of transmitting COVID across our Na-
tion. 
My amendment would ensure re-
sources are provided for testing and 
treatment of migrants at the border 
and for quarantining those who test 
positive for COVID as well as prohib-
iting the transportation of migrants 
who have not received a negative test. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, imagine 
it is 3 in the morning, in a desert, on 
our border, and the Border Patrol is 
out there and finds a family—a mother 
and a father and two small children. 
What do they do when they are 50 
miles away from a port of entry? 
They obviously take them to that 
port of entry, but according to the 
Marshall amendment, they can’t do it. 
Listen to his language: ‘‘[p]rohibiting 
migrants who have not received a nega-
tive COVID–19 test from being trans-
ported.’’ 
They can’t be transported out of the 
desert because they don’t have a nega-
tive COVID–19 test? And what if they 
show up at the detention center—and I 
have mentioned this to Dr. MARSHALL 
already—and there is a new person 
walking in who happens to be a mother 
who is in labor and needs to go to a 
hospital immediately? 
According to your language, they 
cannot be transported unless they have 
a negative COVID–19 test. 
I would say to you, Doctor, that is 
not good medicine; that is not humane. 
I asked you to change those provisions. 
I gave you language to do that. I am 
sorry you didn’t.

AMENDMENT NO. 3758

up my amendment 3758 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KEN-
NEDY], for himself and others, proposes an 
amendment numbered 3758. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to improving health 
care by establishing penalties for providers 
performing elective abortions when the 
post-fertilization age of the unborn child is 
20 weeks or greater) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO IMPROVING HEALTH 
PROGRAMS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to improving health pro-
grams, which may include establishing pen-
alties for providers who perform elective 
abortions on an unborn child at 20 weeks ges-
tation or greater, by the amounts provided 
in such legislation for those purposes, pro-
vided that such legislation would not in-
crease the deficit over either the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 or 
the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, after 
20 weeks of gestation, medical science 
has determined that children in their 
mother’s womb feel pain. To channel 
my good friend and the distinguished 
Senator from Rhode Island, you can go 
to the appropriate professor at any of 
the universities in your State, and 
they will tell you that is so. 
This amendment will allow for pen-
alties for those who perform elective— 
elective—abortions on unborn children 
who are at least 20 weeks in gestation. 
This amendment would not apply to 
abortions in the case of rape, of incest, 
or when the life of the mother is in 
danger. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, even 
in the midst of a pandemic, a climate 
crisis, a childcare crisis, so many 
issues facing our working families, it is 
so disappointing but not surprising 
that Republicans continue to focus on 
restricting access to abortion care. 
Let’s be perfectly clear about this 
amendment. It is a clear attempt to 
undermine Roe v. Wade. It would im-
pose a 20-week abortion ban with no ex-
ception for rape or incest, and it would 
harm women and families across the 
country. 
In fact, leading medical groups like 
the American Medical Association and 
the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists oppose policies like 
this because they interfere with doc-
tors’ and patients’ ability to make de-
cisions based on science and based on 
what 
is 
best 
for 
their 
patients’ 
healthcare. 
Everyone has the right to make their 
own decisions about their own repro-
ductive healthcare. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amend-
ment.

The amendment (No. 3758) was re-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3141 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up my 
amendment No. 3141 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 3141. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to studying and pro-
viding for tax equivalency under the pay-
ments in lieu of taxes program) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO STUDYING AND PRO-
VIDING 
FOR 
TAX 
EQUIVALENCY 
UNDER THE PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF 
TAXES PROGRAM. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to studying and providing 
for tax equivalency under the payments in 
lieu of taxes program established under 
chapter 69 of title 31, United States Code, by 
the amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, States and 
localities are not allowed to tax land 
held by the Federal Government. As a 
result of this, Congress created the 
PILT Program to reimburse States for 
that lost revenue. 
Now, PILT payments are determined 
by a complex formula, a formula that 
unfortunately is far lower than it 
would be under a tax equivalency. 
Twenty-one years ago, the USDA con-
cluded that PILT payments needed to 
be increased by 31⁄2 times. On certain 
Federal lands, the number is much 
larger. A Utah study showed that for 
lands held in Utah cities, it needed to 
be 262 times larger. 
My amendment would help correct 
this inaccuracy. It would direct the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a 
study on the true taxable value of 
PILT land and treat it as if it were 
owned by anyone else other than the 
Federal Government and therefore sub-
ject to taxation. It would reform the 
program to more accurately com-
pensate States for the revenue that 
they lose simply by virtue of the fact 
that they have Federal land in them. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
yields time? 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, Sen-
ator LEE’s amendment sets up a def-
icit-neutral reserve fund to change the 
payment formula for the Payments in 
Lieu of Taxes Program. 
While I share a desire to revisit the 
PILT formula and to ensure that pay-
ments to counties are fair, I have con-
cerns with this amendment. 
The administration has testified that 
trying to incorporate a system into the 
PILT formula that involves appraising 
every parcel of Federal land and track-
ing every local tax rate would prove 
nearly impossible to administer. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on 
this amendment.

The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. INHOFE], 
for himself and others, proposes an amend-
ment numbered 3331. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to relating to improv-
ing health programs, which may include 
prohibiting funding for abortions of unborn 
children with Down syndrome or other 
chromosomal conditions) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO PROTECTING UNBORN 
CHILDREN FROM ABORTION ON THE 
BASIS OF DOWN SYNDROME. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills,

such legislation would not increase the def-
icit over either the period of the total of fis-
cal years 2022 through 2026 or the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. INHOFE. My friends, the amend-
ment—my amendment—is designed to 
protect a very small population but a 
very significant population: the babies 
with Down syndrome. 
Over two-thirds of the unborn babies 
diagnosed with Down syndrome in the 
United States are aborted. Some coun-
tries, like Iceland, are eradicating 
their entire population of individuals 
with Down syndrome through abortion. 
Now, I think we agree that an indi-
vidual should not be discriminated 
against due to his or her chromosome 
count. 
This is not partisan. It is not ex-
treme. Seventy percent of Americans, 
including 
56 
percent 
of 
pro-choice 
Americans, oppose abortion on the 
basis of a Down syndrome diagnosis. 
This amendment uses the budget 
mechanism to help protect the most 
vulnerable among us and who are being 
systematically targeted through abor-
tion.

Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
the stated purpose of this amendment 
is a pretext. It is a pretext for restrict-
ing reproductive rights and interfering 
with women’s decisions about whether 
to have an abortion. 
For all of us who care about people 
with Down syndrome, we ought to lis-
ten to the National Down Syndrome 
Society and devote more resources to 
research at NIH, to funding better set-
tings and care for people with Down 
syndrome, and better opportunities for 
their employment. There are ways to 
serve that community without this 
pretextual restriction of reproductive 
rights. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment.

the period of the total of fiscal years 2022 
through 2031. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Montana 
small businesses are critically impor-
tant for our jobs; for local economies; 
and, really, to bring our communities 
together. And through no fault of their 
own, many were hit very hard by the 
pandemic. 
Unfortunately, some Members on the 
other side of the aisle have put forth 
some very misguided efforts to raise 
taxes on these small businesses, at-
tempting to redefine what constitutes 
a small business. 
Thankfully, 
we 
already 
have 
an 
agreed-upon definition that was set by 
the Small Business Administration, 
which defines a small business as one 
with fewer than 500 employees. 
Efforts to end tax relief, such as to 
limit the 20-percent small business tax 
deduction passed in the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act based on arbitrary income 
thresholds, should be called out for 
what they are: These are small busi-
ness tax hikes. 
For this reason, I am offering an 
amendment to create a deficit-neutral 
reserve against prohibiting tax in-
creases on small businesses, as defined 
by the Small Business Administration. 
I urge my colleagues who believe in 
the importance of small businesses— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired. 
Mr. DAINES.—to join me in voting 
for this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our core 
belief is that taxes should not be raised 
on small businesses and that the 
wealthiest and the biggest corporations 
should pay their fair share. 
This amendment is consistent with 
that. I am going to support it. 
I hope we can do this on a voice vote.

The Chairman of the Committee on the

gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to ensuring that U.S. Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement has suffi-
cient resources to detain and deport a higher 
number of illegal aliens who have been con-
victed of a criminal offense in the United 
States, by the amounts provided in such leg-
islation for those purposes, provided that 
such legislation would not increase the def-
icit over either the period of the total of fis-
cal years 2022 through 2026 or the period of 
the total of fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, 
my amendment provides for ensuring 
that U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, which is charged by Con-
gress with enforcing immigration laws 
in the United States, has sufficient re-
sources to deport illegal aliens who 
have been convicted of crimes in the 
United States. 
According to ICE’s website, 92 per-
cent of the illegal aliens that ICE de-
ports have been convicted or charged 
with crimes. Yet despite the border cri-
sis and record border crossings, the 
Biden administration has drastically 
reduced deportations to roughly one- 
quarter of what they were last fiscal 
year, reaching the lowest levels on 
record this spring, from over 28,000 in 
October of 2019 to less than 3,000 in 
April of 2021. 
That means the administration is al-
lowing thousands of criminal illegal 
aliens per month to remain in Amer-
ican communities and potentially com-
mit more crimes. 
I ask for your support for enforcing 
our immigration laws and deterring il-
legal immigration and criminal activ-
ity by providing the resources nec-
essary 
to 
remove 
criminal 
illegal 
aliens from our streets. 
Thank you, and I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
all agree on one basic thing: No one 
who is dangerous to the United States 
should be allowed to come to this coun-
try. And those who are here and not 
citizens who are guilty of a serious 
crime should be removed from this 
country. 
That is the highest law enforcement 
priority not only of those gathered 
here but also of the Biden administra-
tion. 
The Hagerty amendment, though, 
makes it clear that he is seeking to in-
crease funding for detention and depor-
tation of more undocumented immi-
grants who have been convicted of any 
crime in the United States—not a seri-
ous crime, not a violent crime, any 
crime—including 
nonviolent 
mis-
demeanors. 
The ICE Agency has sufficient funds 
to carry out its law enforcement func-
tion, with a total budget of over $8 bil-
lion. This overly broad amendment 
does 
not 
distinguish 
between 
the 
crimes committed by individuals, the 
serious ones versus those that are not. 
It would divert ICE from focusing its 
resources on the truly serious public 
safety and national security threats. I 
urge my colleagues to vote against this 
amendment.

dent, our Nation’s communities and 
small businesses have had it rough 
these past 18 months as they struggle 
with the lasting effects of the pan-
demic. Today, they are also being vic-
timized amid surging violent crime 
rates and progressive prosecutors who 
adopt nonprosecution policies. And, as 
a result, small businesses are left vul-
nerable and unassisted as they are bur-
glarized, defaced, and destroyed. 
It is understandable for victimized 
small businesses, law enforcement, and 
the public to be dispirited as they are 
left to pick up the pieces while rogue 
prosecutors ignore their constitutional 
duty by refusing to prosecute violent 
crimes that affect the health, safety, or 
economy of our communities. 
Defying the rule of law and endan-
gering the public has Mississippians 
and Americans across the country say-
ing enough is enough. 
My 
amendment 
is 
simple 
and 
straightforward. Any city that pur-
posely obstructs the rule of law by re-
fusing to prosecute— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH.—certain violent 
crimes will not be subsidized by the 
American taxpayers. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Senator from Mississippi has stated her 
case explicitly: If a prosecutor fails to 
prosecute a case, the town or commu-
nity that he represents as prosecutor— 
the town or community—will be denied 
Federal funds. Think about this. Under 
the Senator’s amendment, if a district 
attorney decides not to charge a cer-
tain property offense, even in just one 
case, the whole town will lose its eligi-
bility for Federal funding under pro-
grams 
like 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act—we know what that is; it 
is certainly a refuge for many people 
who are victims of domestic violence— 
or the Bulletproof Vest Grant Act to 
protect law enforcement in that same 
community. They would lose their op-
portunity for Federal grants under the 
Senator’s amendment that she is offer-
ing. 
I think we ought to think carefully 
about this. Prosecutors decide whether 
to proceed with a case or not proceed 
based on the amount of evidence, the 
likelihood of conviction, the possibility 
of securing a plea bargain for a lesser 
offense. To deny a community Federal 
funds— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired.

all of my colleagues would oppose this 
amendment.

AMENDMENT NO. 3650 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
call up my amendment No. 3650 and ask

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Iowa [Mr. GRASSLEY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3650. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to prohibiting illegal 
aliens with criminal records from receiving 
conditional or lawful permanent resident 
status in the United States) 
At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND 
RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT 
OF IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions of a committee or committees, aggre-
gates, and other appropriate levels in this 
resolution, and make adjustments to the 
pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, 
joint resolutions, amendments, amendments 
between the Houses, motions, or conference 
reports relating to enforcing immigration 
laws, which may include preventing aliens 
who are unlawfully present in the United 
States and have been convicted of a crime or 
have pending criminal charges from being 
granted conditional or lawful permanent 
resident status in the United States, by the 
amounts provided in such legislation for 
those purposes, provided that such legisla-
tion would not increase the deficit over ei-
ther the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2026 or the period of the total of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2031. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. This amendment 
creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund 
for legislation that would prevent ille-
gal immigrants with criminal records 
from obtaining lawful permanent resi-
dent status in our country. It is pretty 
simple. Prohibiting illegal immigrants 
with criminal convictions or pending 
criminal charges from receiving legal 
status in the United States should be a 
very easy call and shouldn’t be very 
controversial. I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
I reserve my time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Grassley amendment would exclude 
from a path to citizenship any undocu-
mented immigrant who has been con-
victed of any crime or who has been 
merely charged with a crime. This is a 
broad exclusion, applies to any crimi-
nal conviction no matter how long ago 
it took place, how minor the crime, 
and to any criminal charge even if the 
individual is ultimately exonerated.

This exclusion is also unnecessary 
because every legalization bill pending 
in the Senate requires a criminal back-
ground check and excludes individuals 
convicted of a serious crime. For exam-
ple, the bipartisan House-passed Dream 
and Promise Act would bar an immi-
grant from receiving legal status if 
they have been convicted of any felony, 
any drug offense, or any crime of do-
mestic violence. 
Also, we have to accept the obvious: 
Crossing the border illegally can be a 
crime, if one wants to be charged with 
that. This amendment is inconsistent 
with due process and does nothing to 
increase public safety.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Alaska [Mr. SULLIVAN] 
proposes an amendment numbered 3626. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-
serve fund relating to restricting United 
States funding to international organiza-
tions, such as the United Nations Human 
Rights Council, until the Department of 
State certifies that no members of the or-

SUCH 
AS THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN

THAT NO MEMBERS OF THE ORGANI-

funding to international organizations, such 
as the United Nations Human Rights Coun-
cil, until the Department of State certifies 
that no members of the organization are 
state sponsors of terrorism, which may in-
clude a report from the Department of the 
Treasury on the prevalence of sanctioned en-
tities in the organization, by the amounts 
provided in such legislation for those pur-
poses, provided that such legislation would 
not increase the deficit over either the pe-
riod of the total of fiscal years 2022 through 
2026 or the period of the total of fiscal years 
2022 through 2031. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
my amendment would withhold Amer-
ican taxpayers’ support to the United 
Nations Human Rights Council until 
the Department of State certifies that 
no members of the organization are 
state sponsors of terrorism and the 
Treasury Department reports on the 
prevalence 
of 
American 
sanctioned 
countries within the organization. 
Right now, Cuba, which is designated 
by the State Department as a state 
sponsor of terrorism, serves on the U.N. 
Human Rights Council alongside au-
thoritarian regimes and human rights 
abusers, Russia, and Communist China. 
Recently, the Biden administration 
asked this very flawed international 
organization to investigate our own 
country’s record on human rights. This 
is an outrage, and the Congress should 
respond 
by 
defunding 
the 
Human 
Rights Council until all of its member 
countries 
actually 
respect 
human 
rights. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
it is past 3 a.m., and we are dealing 
with another messaging amendment. 
Like the junior Senator from Alaska, 
we all oppose terrorism; we condemn 
state sponsors of it. But this amend-
ment goes well beyond that and is 
drafted so broadly, whether inten-
tionally or not, that it signals a cutoff 
of funding to every international orga-
nization—every single one—including 
the United Nations because some mem-
bers are bad actors. 
Now, our Republican colleagues are 
well aware that adversaries such as 
China are expanding their influence at 
some of the most important inter-
national organizations. They are call-
ing the shots because we are not there. 
This amendment would cede the field 
to the Chinese so we can sit on the 
sidelines and watch them make the 
rules. 
When Israel is wrongly signaled out 
at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, 
we will not be there to defend her. And 
when international standards are being 
created for high-tech issues, we will 
not lead the world, as we should. That 
is why this amendment should be de-
feated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, do I 
have any time to respond? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
no time remaining.

AMENDMENT NO. 3681 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I call 
up my amendment No. 3681 and ask

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Texas [Mr. CRUZ] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 3681. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To create a point of order against 
legislation that would provide funding or 
subsidize the import from the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China of items relating to 
electric cars) 
At the appropriate place in title IV, add 
the following: 
SEC. 4lll. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST PRO-
VIDING FUNDING OR SUBSIDIZING 
THE IMPORT FROM THE XINJIANG 
UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION OF 
THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
OF ITEMS RELATING TO ELECTRIC 
CARS. 
(a) POINT
OF ORDER.—It shall not be in 
order in the Senate to consider any bill, 
joint 
resolution, 
motion, 
amendment, 
amendment between the Houses, or con-
ference report that would provide funding to 
or subsidize the import of— 
(1) significant goods, wares, articles, or 
merchandise mined, produced, or manufac-
tured wholly, or in part, in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s 
Republic of China to be used for the produc-
tion of electric vehicles; and 
(2) electric vehicles that incorporate or are 
otherwise produced using goods, wares, arti-
cles, or merchandise described in paragraph 
(1). 
(b) WAIVER
AND APPEAL.—Subsection (a) 
may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An af-
firmative vote of three-fifths of the Members 
of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall 
be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling 
of the Chair on a point of order raised under 
subsection (a). 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
this amendment to create a point of 
order against any legislation that 
would fund or subsidize the import of 
electric vehicles with supply lines that 
run through Xinjiang. 
Right now, the Chinese Communist 
Party is committing genocide against 
millions of Uighurs in Xinjiang. They 
are being tortured, murdered, and 
forced into slave labor. The CCP has 
exploited that slave labor to ensure 
that much of the world’s EVs are made 
in Xinjiang and have parts produced in 
Xinjiang. 
Our Nation is in perilous risk of be-
coming complicit in these atrocities as 
part of the massive rush to import 
EVs. This amendment would prohibit 
our bringing in EVs that are made with 
slave labor. We cannot and should not 
fund slave labor in communist China. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
have been advised that inclusion of this 
amendment in the budget resolution 
would be corrosive to the privileged 
status of the resolution. Since this 
amendment contains material inappro-
priate for inclusion in the budget reso-
lution, its adoption could jeopardize 
the privilege of this resolution, which 
would completely halt our efforts to 
consider a reconciliation bill later this 
year. 
Additionally, this amendment is not 
germane as required by law. Accord-
ingly, I raise a point of order that the 
pending amendment violates section 
305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, and I would urge a vote 
against a motion to waive. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Texas. 
MOTION TO WAIVE 
Mr. CRUZ. Pursuant to section 904 of 
the Congressional Budget Act, I move 
to waive, and I ask for the yeas and 
nays.

There appears to be a sufficient sec-

At the appropriate place in title IV, add

TION THAT WOULD CAUSE A NET IN-
CREASE IN OUTLAYS UNLESS THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL 
BUDGET OFFICE CERTIFIES THAT 
INFLATION IS BELOW 3 PERCENT. 
(a) POINT
OF ORDER.—It shall not be in 
order in the Senate to consider any bill, 
joint 
resolution, 
motion, 
amendment, 
amendment between the Houses, or con-
ference report that would cause a net in-
crease in outlays relative to the most re-
cently published Congressional Budget Office 
baseline unless the Director of the Congres-
sional Budget Office certifies (based on the 
most recent data available to the Director) 
that inflation, as measured in either the av-
erage of the annualized changes in the 3 
most recently published monthly reports on 
the consumer price index for all-urban con-
sumers published by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics of the Department of Labor, or the 
previous year’s unadjusted annual change in 
that index, is below 3 percent. 
(b) WAIVER
AND APPEAL.—Subsection (a) 
may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An af-
firmative vote of three-fifths of the Members 
of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall 
be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling 
of the Chair on a point of order raised under 
subsection (a). 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, inflation 
is out of control. Very few seem to be 
willing to talk about it, much less ad-
dress it. 
Now, look, it hasn’t been this bad 
since the great recession. Even then, 
only two of the months out of that en-
tire crisis were as bad or worse than in-
flation is right now, and it is showing 
up in every consumer product Ameri-
cans buy. Everything from groceries to 
gasoline, to housing, to healthcare is 
getting more expensive. Every dollar 
that we churn into the economy, that 
we print out when we don’t have it, 
makes these and all other products 
more expensive. 
Let’s be clear. The spending is facili-
tated by this budget resolution, and 
that same spending will exacerbate in-
flation. It will worsen the pain that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6237 
August 10, 2021 
Americans are feeling as they are fill-
ing their gas tanks and stocking their 
pantries and refrigerators. 
When inflation is surging, we can’t be 
piling onto the problem. We are not 
elected to make life worse. We need to 
get inflation back under our control. 
This simple amendment would em-
power Congress to do that by making it 
harder for Congress to increase spend-
ing whenever inflation is above 3 per-
cent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
this amendment is a poison pill that 
would defeat everything that many of 
us are trying to accomplish tonight in 
this historic budget: no reduction in 
childhood poverty; no expansion in 
childcare, pre-K, or Medicare; no in-
vestment in affordable housing or 
home healthcare; no paid family and 
medical leave; no effort to combat the 
existential threat of climate change; 
no creation of millions of good-paying 
jobs. Using an arbitrary inflation num-
ber, it would end all of that. This 
amendment must be defeated.

Democrats 
have 
just 
taken a massive step toward restoring 
the middle class in the 21st century, 
giving more Americans the chance to 
get there. 
Teddy Roosevelt said: 
Nothing in [the] world is . . . worth doing 
unless it means effort, pain, [and] difficulty. 
What we are doing here is not easy. 
Democrats have labored for months to 
reach this point, and there are many 
labors to come, but I can say with ab-
solute certainty that it will be worth 
doing. 
The Democratic budget will bring a 
generational transformation to how 
our economy works for average Ameri-
cans. It will cut taxes for American 
families; it will lower costs for every-
one; it will create good-paying jobs 
while tackling climate change; and it 
will be paid for by making our Tax 
Code more progressive and more fair: 
asking corporations and the wealthy to 
pay their fair share; it will help mid-
dle-class Americans stay in the middle 
class; and it will build ladders into the 
middle class. 
It will restore the basic social con-
tract in America: If you work hard, 
you can do better and pass on even 
greater opportunities for your children. 
And, in doing so, my friends, it will 
restore something in the American 
character that we have nearly lost: 
that hopeful optimism; that can-do at-
titude; that frontier spirit—eyes fixed 
on the horizons; the kindness and de-
cency and faith in the future that is 
fundamental not only to the American 
spirit but to American democracy. I 
can think of no more worthy pursuit.

RECOGNIZING U.S. SENATE COM-
MITTEE ON THE BUDGET STAFF 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want 
to say a quick thank you to my Budget 
Committee staff who have worked very 
hard over the past couple of weeks. 
They worked late nights, crunched the 
numbers, provided support to Repub-
lican offices on amendment drafting 
and more. 
Starting with our support staff, who 
help both sides of the aisle on com-
mittee: chief clerk Katie Smith, staff 
assistants 
Ben 
Mason 
and 
Maeve 
Poulson, and computer systems admin-
istrator George Woodall. 
Our senior staff, who manage an ex-
cellent team and keep everyone on 
track: staff director Nick Myers, who 
worked 
up 
until 
the 
buzzer, 
but 
couldn’t be here for vote-arama as he 
and his wife, Christine, welcomed their 
first child. 
Deputy staff director and chief coun-
sel Joe Keeley, deputy staff director 
Matt Giroux, and budget policy direc-
tor Becky Cole. 
Executive assistant Katherine Rossi 
is an invaluable member of our team 
and helps to keep our team organized 
and operating at our best. 
Our team of analysts who dig into 
the numbers of the budget resolution 
and interpret what it means for the 
country, they also do important work 
coordinating with other offices on 
amendments: 
Professional Staff Members: Kevin 
Dawson, Chris Devine, Derek Gondek, 
Chad Miller, Alyssa Palisi, and John 
Stout; along with economist Eric Hart-
man, senior policy adviser Walker 
Truluck, and general counsel Krisann 
Pearce. 
Our director of coalitions and out-
reach Blair Bjellos did an excellent job 
communicating with outside groups 
and stakeholders to keep them in-
formed and involved throughout the 
process. She also makes sure Repub-
lican Senate offices are plugged in on 
amendment order and details during 
vote-arama.

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021— 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, even at this 
late hour, and before the conclusion of 
the session, this Chamber is going to 
take one more step in the fight to pro-
tect voting rights in this country. 
In a moment, I will move to dis-
charge the Rules Committee from fur-
ther consideration of the For the Peo-
ple Act, a vehicle for the Senate to 
have a debate on voting rights. 
It is my intention that the first 
amendment to the bill would be the 
text of a compromise bill that a group 
of Senators are working on. 
Let me be very clear. This is a debate 
the Senate must have. In America 
today, we are witnessing the most 
sweeping and coordinated attacks on 
voting rights since the era of Jim 
Crow. 
Reactionary Republican legislatures 
are making it harder for poorer, young-
er, and non-White Americans to vote, 
while at the same time making it easi-
er for partisan actors to steal an elec-
tion. 
Senate Democrats are not going to 
stand by while this happens. We are 
going to fight to protect the sacred 
right to vote. 
Now, before I make my motion, I 
yield to my colleague and friend from 
West Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
have made it crystal clear that I do not 
support the For the People Act. 
Over the past few months, I have 
worked to eliminate the far-reaching 
aspects of that bill and amend the leg-
islation to make sure our elections are 
fair, accessible, and secure. 
In June, I voted to begin debate in 
the Senate on my amended voting 
rights legislation, not For the People 
Act. Tonight, I am again voting to 
move that process forward because I 
believe that we need to come together 
to restore people’s faith in the integ-
rity of our elections. 
But I do make it very clear that I 
will not support the For the People 
Act. For example, I firmly believe that 
we need commonsense voter ID require-
ments, just like we have in West Vir-
ginia, that strengthen the security of 
our elections without making it harder 
for Americans to vote. 
I 
also 
firmly 
believe 
that 
we 
shouldn’t politicize the Federal Elec-
tion Commission, prohibit any guard-
rails on vote by mail, or prevent local 
election officials from doing basic 
maintenance of voter rolls. 
The compromise bill we voted on in 
June included all of these important 
provisions, and I urge my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, to allow 
us to debate this critical issue and 
come up with a bipartisan solution 
that protects every American’s right to 
vote. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my friend for his dedication to 
finding a way forward on this critical 
issue. 
And now, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the 
Rules Committee being tied on the 
question of reporting, I move to dis-
charge the Rules Committee from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1, For the Peo-
ple Act of 2021. 
And for the information of the Sen-
ate, it is my intention the first amend-
ment to the bill would be the text of a 
compromise bill that a group of Sen-
ators are working on. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
The Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
well, here we go again, colleagues. We 
have seen this once before, and I think 
it is fitting that after passing this 
budget resolution full of reckless tax-
ing and spending, we end the evening 
with an effort to Federalize—take over 
all elections all across America by the 
Federal Government. 
Now, we are hearing it is going to be 
a substitute, but what is technically 
before us is as follows: After ramming 
through 
this 
reckless 
taxing-and- 
spending spree here in the dead of 
night, they also want to start tearing 
up the ground rules of our democracy 
and writing new ones, of course, on a 
purely partisan basis. 
I suppose the timing actually makes 
sense, given the terrible votes that 
every Democratic Senator has just cast 
here tonight. I can understand why 
their thoughts have turned so quickly 
to their next elections and why they 
might be feeling especially anxious to 
tilt the playing field in their direction. 
This ridiculous, go-nowhere bill that 
is stuck in the Rules Committee would 
let Washington Democrats take over 50 
State election laws, completely Fed-
eralize how we handle elections in this 
country. 
It would attack popular safeguards, 
like voter ID. It would turn the Federal 
Election Commission into a partisan 
body. It would even spend public funds 
on our political companies. Four-plus 
trillion dollars in new spending actu-
ally wasn’t enough tonight. It wasn’t 
enough. 
The preference of at least 49 out of 50 
of them is to spend public money on 
our own elections; have public money 
finance the attack ads of people you 
disagree with. 
So, look, my view is that maybe this 
is just concluding the night with a lit-
tle comic relief. S. 1 is an absurd and 
clumsy effort by one political party to 
literally rewrite the ground rules of 
our democracy to try to advantage 
them and disadvantage the other side. 
It is always a temptation when the 
majority wants to write the rules to 
make it more likely you can get the 
outcome you want. 
This isn’t going to work. It isn’t 
going to work tonight, and it isn’t 
going to work when we get back. 
VOTE ON MOTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to yield all re-
maining time on both sides.

Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6251 
August 10, 2021 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, this bill would con-
stitute a Federal Government takeover 
of elections. It would constitute a mas-
sive power grab by Democrats. It would 
disenfranchise millions of Americans. 
It would do precisely the opposite of its 
nominal title, ‘‘For the People.’’ It is, 
instead, for the politicians because it 
entrenches politicians and ensures that 
the people cannot vote them out of of-
fice. 
It would strike down virtually every 
reasonable voter integrity law in the 
country, including voter ID laws sup-
ported by the overwhelming majority 
of this country; including prohibitions 
on ballot harvesting—again, widely 
supported by people in this country. It 
would mandate that felons be allowed 
to vote, and it would automatically 
register millions of illegal aliens to 
vote. It would profoundly undermine 
democracy in this country, and for 
that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2670 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Republican mi-
nority has just prevented the Senate 
from even having a debate—a debate; 
just that—on voting rights in this 
country. 
I understand my Republican col-
leagues don’t approve of every aspect 
of the Democratic bill to protect vot-
ing rights, but surely there are areas 
where our two parties can find some 
agreement. Partisan gerrymandering, 
for instance, has plagued our country 
for too long. It skews our democracy 
towards the extremes. It strips the 
American people of their right to have 
a truly representative government. 
Voters ought to pick their politi-
cians, not the other way around. But in 
so many States, partisan legislators 
draw maps that artificially maximize 
the number of seats that the majority 
party will win. Some districts are so 
safe that the most extreme candidates 
can run and win with hardly any com-
petition. 
Surely my Republican colleagues 
would 
agree 
that 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering deserves a debate on the 
Senate floor. It is a small part of S. 1 
but one that has broad universal sup-
port—and the support, by the way, of 
all 49 of my Democratic colleagues. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 2670, Calendar No. 119, 
the Redistricting Reform Act of 2021. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, the text of the Con-
stitution explicitly assigns power to 
engage in redistricting to elected State 
legislatures in the States. There is a 
reason for that. That ensures that re-
districting is controlled by the people. 
We have an unfortunate pattern in 
today’s Congress, which is today’s 
Democrats no longer believe in democ-
racy. Their bill, S. 1—what many call 
the Corrupt Politicians Act—is de-
signed to prevent the voters from vot-
ing Democrats out of office. 
This bill, the bill to remove the State 
legislatures 
from 
their 
constitu-
tionally appointed responsibility of 
being in charge of redistricting, would 
instead assign that to commissions and 
ultimately to the Federal courts, to 
unelected Federal judges. 
Now, 
redistricting 
and 
gerry-
mandering can lead to ugly con-
sequences. This is not new. The Found-
ers were well aware of the ugly con-
sequences of gerrymandering. Indeed, 
the very word ‘‘gerrymander’’ comes 
from Elbridge Gerry, one of the Found-
ers whose district was so contorted, it 
looked like a salamander. That is 
where the district came from. 
The Founders knew that if you give 
redistricting 
to 
elected 
politicians, 
they will act based on political con-
cerns. The reason the Founders did so 
is, even with those down sides, it keeps 
the process accountable to the people. 
If you instead hand it over to unelected 
commissions or to unelected Federal 
judges, the people are disenfranchised. 
That is a serious mistake. 
I would note, over a decade ago, I de-
fended the constitutionality and the 
constitutional assignment of that re-
sponsibility to the State legislatures 
before the U.S. Supreme Court in the 
Texas redistricting case, and we won a 
landmark 5-to-4 victory where the Su-
preme Court upheld the clear constitu-
tional authorization of legislatures to 
engage in redistricting even if they en-
gaged in political concerns because the 
check on that is not unelected judges 
second-guessing the people; rather, the 
check on that is democracy and the 
people engaging in their own check and 
balance. 
Accordingly, I object. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. So the American peo-
ple should understand, Republicans 
just blocked the Senate from even de-
bating legislation to end partisan ger-
rymandering and make our Congress 
more representative of the people. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2671 
Mr. President, surely our Republican 
colleagues, however, would agree that 
billions of dollars in anonymous cam-
paign donations every year is not a 
function of a healthy democracy. Sure-
ly they must agree that America’s rep-
resentatives should have only one 
boss—the people, not the special inter-
ests. 
So I am going to ask the Senate now 
to debate a simple measure to bring a 
much needed transparency to campaign 
donations—just transparency, not even 
limits, although I would certainly sup-
port those. At the very least, the 
American people deserve to know who 
is trying to influence their representa-
tives and how strenuously. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 2671, Calendar No. 120, 
the DISCLOSE Act of 2021, which has 
the support of our entire caucus. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, you know, I would note there is a 
long history of government trying to 
force the disclosure of the identity of 
political contributions, and much of 
that history is sordid. 
Indeed, in a landmark case before the 
U.S. Supreme Court, racist southern 
Democratic politicians tried to force 
the NAACP to hand over their donor 
list, and they wanted to do so for rea-
sons that were not difficult to discern, 
because they intended to persecute 
those who dare contribute to the 
NAACP. 
And the Supreme Court, in a land-
mark decision, concluded that the Con-
stitution protects against that forced 
disclosure. But I will say, the majority 
leader said just a few minutes ago that 
surely there must be some area of com-
mon ground, and indeed there is on this 
issue. 
I think all of us, if we were speaking 
in a moment of candor, if we were not 
engaged in our typical partisan battle 
on the floor, would acknowledge the 
current system is stupid. The current 
system makes no sense. Super-PACs 
make no sense. Why is that? Because in 
all of our elections—every one of us has 
run for election—there are super-PACs, 
which are independent groups. It is il-
legal for us, as candidates, to speak 
with those independent groups. And in 
every one of our races—I see the Sen-
ator from Arizona. He is going have a 
hotly contested race. It wouldn’t sur-
prise me to see $100 million or more 
spent in his race, perhaps on both 
sides. Much of that will be spent in 
super-PACs. 
It is illegal for us, as candidates, to 
communicate with those super-PACs. 
So we are left with the bizarre situa-
tion where there is millions or some-
times tens of millions of dollars being 
spent on behalf of us; millions, some-
times tens of millions of dollars, spent 
attacking us; and we can’t commu-
nicate with them. We hope it has some 
bearing or relevance to what we be-
lieve. 
Every Congress, since I have been 
here, I have introduced legislation to 
end this. This is legislation called the 
SuperPAC Elimination Act. This act 
does two very simple things. No. 1, it 
allows unlimited individual contribu-
tions to Federal campaigns, not from 
unions, not from corporations but from 
real human beings, from people—un-
limited contributions. 
I would note this is the way the State 
of Texas handles State elections. 
No. 2, my legislation, the SuperPAC 
Elimination Act, requires immediate 
24-hour disclosure. So if an individual

writes a check to a campaign, that gets 
disclosed immediately, and you can de-
bate about whether that contribution 
was corrosive or not. 
This legislation would not prohibit 
super-PACs, but, as a practical matter, 
super-PACs would fade from relevance 
because every candidate would much 
prefer money given to their campaign, 
where you can spend on your own mes-
sage. It would make far more sense to 
have an open, transparent system. 
Accordingly, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of a bill at the 
desk that would protect freedom of 
speech in America’s electoral process 
and ensure transparency in campaign 
finance. I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed, and that a motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the able. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ob-
ject to the Senator from Texas’s legis-
lation. It is obvious to just about every 
American that it would make a bad sit-
uation even worse. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest from the Senator of New York? 
Mr. CRUZ. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in 
conclusion, before I turn it over to 
some of my colleagues, Democrats 
have tried to do something very sim-
ple. We asked the Senate to start de-
bate—just debate—on legislation to 
protect voting rights and strengthen 
our democracy. Republicans said no. 
Democrats have asked to debate a 
measure just to prevent partisan gerry-
mandering, and, then, frankly, in my 
colleague’s response, he was all over 
the lot: It is good to have politicians do 
it; it is not good to have politicians do 
it. It is good to have judges do it; it is 
not good to have judges do it. 
We would set standards to make sure 
that in a State like Wisconsin, where 
53 percent of the people voted for a 
Democratic member of the State as-
sembly, only a third of the districts 
were Democratic, drawn by a Repub-
lican legislature. 
So Republicans have said no. They 
don’t even want to debate these issues. 
Democrats have asked to debate the 
measure to bring much needed trans-
parency to campaign donations and get 
special interest dark money out of poli-
tics. Republicans still said no. 
So let there be no mistake about 
what is going on here. We have reached 
a point in this Chamber where Repub-
licans appear to oppose any measure— 
any measure—no matter how common 
sense, to protect voting rights and 
strengthen our democracy. 
Let there be no mistake. Both inside 
this Chamber and outside of it, Repub-
licans have formed a wall—a total 
wall—of opposition against progress on 
voting rights in the U.S. Senate. Even 
on an issue as sacred as the right to 
vote, Senate Republicans refuse to 
allow even a debate. They are afraid to 
debate. 
Yesterday morning, we saw what it 
looks like when the Senate comes to-
gether. This is what it looks like when 
it doesn’t. Apparently, there are very 
serious and important limits to bipar-
tisanship. There are some issues where 
Republicans refuse to join us, in good 
faith, to make progress for our coun-
try. 
I never thought I would see the day 
when voting rights, which used to be 
supported in a bipartisan way as re-
cently as 2006, would be one of those 
issues. But that is what we have come 
to—total 
Republican 
intransigence 
when it comes to simple measures to 
make our democracy more perfect and 
strengthen the hand of the individual 
voter. 
Now, let me be clear. Republicans re-
fusing to support anything on voting 
rights is not an excuse for Democrats 
to do nothing. In recent weeks, I met 
with a number of Democratic Senators: 
Senators KLOBUCHAR
and MERKLEY, 
MANCHIN and WARNOCK and PADILLA, 
KAINE, KING, and TESTER to discuss a 
compromise voting rights bill. We have 
made a great deal of progress on that 
legislation. We had a very good meet-
ing as late recently as yesterday after-
noon, and we intend to rally around it. 
So, tonight, I am filing cloture on a 
vehicle to allow the Senate to take up 
the compromise voting rights bill. Vot-
ing rights—voting rights—will be the 
first matter of legislative business 
when the Senate returns to session in 
September. Our democracy demands no 
less. 
I yield the floor. I yield to my col-
league from Oregon and then my col-
league from Rhode Island. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we 
have the privilege to come to this floor 
and examine issues important to every 
American. And what could be more im-
portant than the fundamental right to 
participate in the guidance of our 
country and to be able to cast a ballot. 
And that ballot box, it is the pulsating 
heart of our Republic. 
In fact, it is 56 years ago, just a cou-
ple of days ago, that President Johnson 
signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
And what did he say? He said it is 
wrong—deadly 
wrong—to 
deny 
any 
American the opportunity to vote. 
Well, what was deadly wrong in 1965 is 
deadly wrong in 2021. 
It is hard to believe that over 50 
years—over half a century—has passed, 
and we are reverting to that period be-
fore 1965, where there was a systematic 
effort to target specific groups of vot-
ers and prevent them from going to the 
poll. 
And we all know how this worked. On 
election day, there would be fewer pre-
cinct voting locations in those areas 
that you didn’t want to vote, and they 
would be understaffed so there would 
be long lines, or their voting machines 
would be out of order, or they would 
change the location every 2 years so 
people would be confused about where 
to go, or they would locate them where 
there was no parking—all of these 
things 
deliberately 
aimed 
at 
pre-
venting Black Americans from voting 
and preventing other communities of 
color from voting. 
Well, today, we are seeing in State 
after State after State an expanded 
version of this, not just targeting 
Black Americans and other commu-
nities of color but also targeting poor 
communities and college students. And 
we see these laws unfolding in just the 
recent months. 
I would expect 100 of our colleagues 
here to stand up and defend the ballot 
box. Aren’t we long removed from 
those days of that racist past? But ap-
parently not. 
So some of us have to stand up and 
say: We are going to stand up to the vi-
sion of our Constitution where all men 
and women are created equal and every 
man and woman has the right to par-
ticipate in the guidance of this coun-
try. 
You know, we know that in the 
founding of our country, we had a 
beautiful vision, imperfectly formed, 
that Black Americans, Native Ameri-
cans, and women were not allowed to 
vote. We fixed those things over time. 
We progressed in an arc to full oppor-
tunity, and that is what we are fight-
ing for now—full opportunity of every 
citizen to have a full measure of what 
it means to be a participant in a Re-
public. 
Well, there is much more in this bill 
to mend the assault on equal represen-
tation through the diabolical gerry-
mandering denied to bias the outcome 
from one party over the other, and cer-
tainly to keep billionaires from buying 
elections. 
And when we ask people around the 
country—Independents, Democrats, Re-
publicans—they all say: We do not 
want billionaires to buy elections. We 
do not want equal representation de-
stroyed by diabolical gerrymandering, 
and we want every citizen to have ac-
cess to the ballot box. 
But in this Chamber, suddenly, the 
views of the Republicans across this 
country are forgotten by my Repub-
lican colleagues across the aisle. In 
that thirsty quest for power, they are 
willing to violate the fundamental 
principles that inspire our Nation, and 
it is wrong—deadly wrong—today as it 
was in 1965. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, a 
short word on dark money. When the 
Republican justices on the Supreme 
Court opened the floodgates of unlim-
ited money in the disgraceful Citizens 
United decision, that suddenly made 
something new very important, and 
that was to hide who you are when you 
are spending the money.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6253 
August 10, 2021 
If the biggest check you can write is 
$5,000, there is no great premium in 
hiding who you are. When you can 
write a $5 million check to back a can-
didate, suddenly hiding who you are be-
comes extremely valuable and salient. 
So, suddenly, this became very real. 
But those Justices who had opened the 
door to unlimited money, when they 
made that decision, in order to justify 
that decision, they had to say that the 
spending had to be transparent. Other-
wise, the Citizens United decision 
would not have worked in the constitu-
tional scheme. They had to say that. 
But for the next decade, what did 
they do about it? Case after case came 
before them where the dark money 
problem was raised. We rode through a 
billion dollars in dark money being 
spent in our elections. This was on the 
front page of the newspaper. This was 
being done in plain view. And what did 
the Republican Justices on the Su-
preme Court do to enforce their own 
stated requirement of transparency? 
Not one thing. 
And so we have had a decade of cor-
ruption of government by billionaire 
interests who can hide who they are 
and operate through an enormous pha-
lanx of phony front groups whom they 
have stood up. And if you want to know 
how real this is, look at what we have 
had to do in the reconciliation measure 
to address climate change—because 
when I got here, there were Repub-
licans 
willing 
to 
address 
climate 
change. 
We had bill after bill in the Senate 
that were bipartisan and serious and 
sincere. That stopped dead in January 
of 2010. When Citizens United was de-
cided, the dark money spigots opened, 
and the fossil fuel industry behind 
them enforced compliance across the 
entire Republican Party. If you crossed 
the fossil fuel industry on climate 
change, if you are Bob Inglis, you were 
out, you were done. If you lined up 
with them and did what they said, in 
came tens of millions of dollars in dark 
money to support you. 
It was a devil’s bargain, and it cost 
us a lost decade on climate change. 
And now we have to go forward, sadly, 
in a partisan way to solve this prob-
lem. That is the pressure of dark 
money in our politics. It is behind the 
capture of the Supreme Court. It is be-
hind voter suppression. This is demon-
strable stuff, and we have got to put an 
end to it. And it is a tragedy and a dis-
grace that we can’t go to cleaning up 
the dark money mess. 
My Republican colleagues and their 
dark money groups are actually at the 
point now where they are accusing us 
of taking dark money. They are accus-
ing Democrats of being the dark money 
party. Well, we just settled that ques-
tion tonight. Democrats want to clean 
it up. They want to protect it. It is as 
simple as that. That is all you need to 
know. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
know the hour is late, but we have 
nearly 30 highly qualified Foreign Af-
fairs and Development nominees who 
are languishing on the Senate floor. We 
have to confirm these nominees to 
fully equip the United States to pursue 
our foreign policy objectives, and I will 
be asking unanimous consent to con-
firm each one. 
My 
distinguished 
colleague 
from 
Connecticut, Senator MURPHY, a mem-
ber of the committee, is here to join 
with me in this effort. I know the Pre-
siding Officer is also a distinguished 
member of the committee. 
In the nearly 30 years that I have 
been working on foreign policy, we 
have never faced such a confluence of 
global challenges: a once-in-a-century 
global 
pandemic; 
climate 
change 
threatening stability, health, and safe-
ty across the world; fueling displace-
ment and resource-driven conflicts; 
great power competition from an in-
creasingly emboldened China and Rus-
sia. 
We have the tools to confront these 
challenges; to promote American val-
ues and interests around the world to 
advance the safety, health, and eco-
nomic well-being of all Americans. But 
we cannot do that when we do not have 
empowered diplomats and development 
professionals in place to do so. 
So I call on this body to confirm 
these nominees—all of whom the For-
eign Relations Committee has moved 
with bipartisan support—to put the 
United States in the best position to 
advance our foreign policy, develop-
ment, and national security priorities. 
I am calling for confirmation of all of 
these nominees: those up for Ambas-
sadorships, senior State Department, 
and USAID positions. We need them in 
place. 
Now, the Trump administration had 
its first Ambassador confirmed on day 
62 of the Trump Presidency. The 
Obama administration had its first 
Ambassador confirmed at day 73. The 
George W. Bush administration had its 
first Ambassador confirmed at day 75. 
For the Clinton administration, it was 
day 75. For the George H. W. Bush ad-
ministration, it was day 83. 
We are now more than 200 days into 
the Biden administration, and as of 
this moment, there is not a single con-
firmed State Department country Am-
bassador—not one. And going back four 
administrations, there is a precedent of 
moving a package of nominees before 
the August recess. 
Under George W. Bush, the Senate 
confirmed a package of 81 nominees. 
During the Obama administration, the 
Senate confirmed a package of 104 
nominees. And during the Trump ad-
ministration, we confirmed a package 
of 75 nominees. 
We should be ashamed of holding the 
record for the longest delay in fully 
equipping the State Department and 
USAID to pursue the foreign policy, de-
velopment, and national security inter-
ests of the United States. 
Now, some Members of this body call 
on one hand for assertive American 
leadership on the global stage, and, at 
the same time, they hold up these crit-
ical positions. Many of these nominees 
are career diplomats, public servants 
who have dedicated their lives to ad-
vancing U.S. interests. They have 
served under the Trump administration 
in the same way they will serve in the 
Biden administration: on behalf of the 
American people. 
Many of my colleagues are readily fo-
cused on effectively confronting Chi-
nese malign influence. Well, a fun-
damentally critical element of con-
fronting China is empowered leadership 
in our diplomatic corps, across the 
world. So let me be clear. Holding up 
diplomats to posts across Africa and 
the Western Hemisphere is effectively 
ceding influence to China and actively 
undermining U.S. national security in-
terests. 
I recently heard an anecdote from a 
diplomat in Cameroon. When he travels 
outside the capital city, Cameroonians 
will greet him with a ‘‘ni hao,’’ assum-
ing that if he isn’t Cameroonian, he 
must be Chinese. 
Meanwhile, we haven’t had an Amer-
ican Ambassador in Cameroon in more 
than a year, and the Foreign Relations 
Committee approved a career diplomat 
for the post by voice vote nearly a 
month ago. What could possibly be the 
rationale for holding him up?

August 10, 2021 
Lastly, looking at the Department 
itself, critical leadership positions re-
main held up. 
Now, I know many of my colleagues 
have dedicated a significant amount of 
their time over the past few years to 
combating the flow of fentanyl into the 
United States, but here we have a hold 
on a career Foreign Service officer 
nominated to be Assistant Secretary 
for International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement, who would be leading the 
Department’s efforts to combat the 
flow of fentanyl. 
So which one do you want? The 
American people deserve better than 
this. 
Now, I know we are all tired of being 
here, and I want to salute and thank 
the different—the reading clerks, the 
Parliamentarian, the Democrat and 
Republican staff who are still here, but 
we feel compelled to go through and 
ask UC for each of these nominees. 
They all deserve to be confirmed to-
night. So let me start off. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to executive session to 
consider 
the 
following 
nomination: 
Calendar No. 233, Larry Edward Andre, 
Jr., of Texas, a Career Member of the 
Senior Foreign Service, to be Ambas-
sador of the United States to Somalia; 
that the nomination be confirmed, the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate; that no 
further motions be in order to the nom-
ination; that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action 
and the Senate then resume legislative 
session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, the Senator from 
New Jersey and, indeed, all of the Sen-
ators in this Chamber know precisely 
why these nominees have not moved 
forward, and the reason is because the 
Biden administration is currently en-
gaged in open defiance of the U.S. Con-
gress and is doing so in a way that is 
working serious and material harm to 
the United States national security. 
Over a year ago, December of 2019, 
this Senate and, indeed, the full Con-
gress 
passed 
legislation 
imposing 
strong sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline is 
a pipeline between Russia and Ger-
many designed to carry natural gas. It 
is a deep sea pipeline. 
Vladimir Putin desperately wants 
this pipeline completed. If the pipeline 
is completed, it will give billions of 
dollars to Putin to use for malign ef-
forts in Europe and throughout the 
world. 
This Congress is overwhelmingly con-
vinced 
that 
completing 
the 
Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline is terrible policy. It 
is bad for the United States; it is bad 
for Europe; and it is good for Russia 
and Putin. Accordingly, the Congress 
passed 
overwhelmingly 
bipartisan 
sanctions legislation that I authored, 
along with Democratic Senator JEANNE 
SHAHEEN, and that legislation proved 
tremendously successful. 
How successful was it? When the 
President signed it into law, if my 
memory serves correctly, at 7 p.m. on a 
Thursday, construction on the pipeline 
halted at 6:45 p.m. on that Thursday. 
Fifteen minutes before the sanctions 
went into law, they ceased building the 
pipeline. And for a year the pipeline 
lay dormant. It lay as a hunk of metal 
at the bottom of the ocean. 
We had succeeded together. This 
body had won a bipartisan national se-
curity victory for the United States. 
Then, in November of last year, Joe 
Biden was elected. When Joe Biden was 
elected, President Biden and his for-
eign policy team immediately began 
signaling weakness on Nord Stream 2 
to Putin, and that signal was heard. 
Putin commenced preparatory efforts 
to begin building the pipeline again 
within days of the Presidential election 
in November. And Russia began build-
ing the pipeline again in January, just 
days after Joe Biden was sworn in. 
Existing laws that this body has 
passed, not once but twice, mandate 
sanctions to stop the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. Unfortunately, the Biden ad-
ministration decided to waive those 
sanctions. Waiving those sanctions, I 
believe, will prove to be a generational 
geopolitical mistake. If we continue on 
the current pace set out by President 
Biden, Putin will complete the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. 
If that happens, for decades, Putin 
and the next dictator in Russia and the 
next dictator in Russia will get billions 
of dollars every year from this pipe-
line. They will use it for military ag-
gression. They will use it for spying on 
America. They will use it for attacking 
their enemies. 
Not only that, Europe will be captive 
to Russian natural gas. It will be sub-
ject to energy blackmail. We don’t 
have to hypothesize this because Putin 
has demonstrated his willingness to 
use energy blackmail on Europe going 
forward. This undermines the interests 
of Europe. It undermines the interests 
of America. And by the way, it also 
hurts jobs in the United States of 
America. 
I have made clear to every State De-
partment official, to every State De-
partment nominee, that I would place 
holds on these nominees unless and 
until the Biden administration follows 
the law and stops this pipeline, imposes 
the sanctions. 
As the Senator from New Jersey 
knows well—he and I worked together 
closely on these sanctions legislation 
that the Biden administration is refus-
ing to follow—I have been negotiating 
with the Biden administration in good 
faith for a month, months, laying out a 
path to move these nominees forward. 
But unfortunately, to date, President 
Biden has insisted on giving a multibil-
lion-dollar gift to Joe Biden benefiting 
Russia, hurting America, and hurting 
our national security interests. 
That being said, there is a path 
where I would readily lift these holds, 
and it is a path I am in a moment 
going to propound a unanimous con-
sent resolution—a unanimous consent 
request to take up and pass legislation 
that I have introduced that would im-
pose the sanctions that are already re-
quired by law that the Biden adminis-
tration refuses to follow. This legisla-
tion is legislation that both of the 
Democratic members of the Foreign 
Relations Committee have voted for 
substantially similar legislation in the 
past. 
If this legislation passes the Senate, 
if it passes the House and is signed by 
the President, the day it is signed by 
the President, I will lift these holds. 
But given that the President and the 
White House have indicated they in-
tend to defy the law, I am not going to 
lift the holds unless and until they re-
lent in their effort to give this gift to 
Vladimir Putin. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. President, accordingly, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of a bill at the desk that would 
require the imposition of sanctions 
with respect to Nord Stream 2. I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). Is there objection? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, and I will 
be brief for the sake of everybody here. 
There is a lot more to be said. But, 
look, first of all, this legislation was 
just introduced today—today. 
It has not been brought before the 
committee. It has not had a full vet-
ting. And it is not quite fair to say that 
it is exactly the same. It isn’t. I was 
just looking through it. 
Secondly, I know that the Senator 
believes that he can dictate to the 
President of the United States, duly 
elected by the American people, what 
the foreign policy should be. I believe 
we should have a role in foreign policy. 
I share that with the Senator. But you 
can’t say: If it passes the Senate, if it 
passes the House, signed by the Presi-
dent, then I will release my hold. 
I mean, I guess that would be nice if 
the Senator could accomplish it for his 
goals, but it is not the way the system 
ultimately works. 
And I would just say President 
Trump, for the longest period of time, 
did not issue the sanctions that were 
necessary because he was so cozy with 
Vladimir Putin, and the result was 
that the pipeline was almost finished 
by the time President Biden came to 
office. And had he done what the Sen-
ator wishes, we wouldn’t be in this po-
sition today. 
So for all of those reasons, I object to 
the Senator’s unanimous consent re-
quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the request from 
the Senator from New Jersey?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6256 
August 10, 2021 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I will respond briefly to the Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
The talking point from the Biden ad-
ministration as to why they have given 
this gift to Vladimir Putin is they say 
the pipeline is almost completed; that 
it is over 90 percent complete. The 
problem with that argument is it is de-
monstrably false because it was equal-
ly true in December of 2019. In Decem-
ber of 2019, the pipeline was over 90 per-
cent complete. And, indeed, at that 
time, there was a massive Russian 
disinformation campaign throughout 
Europe, where the Russian Government 
was putting out: These sanctions will 
never pass, and if they pass, they will 
never work. 
Why? Because the pipeline is over 90 
percent complete. Well, a pipeline that 
is 90 percent complete is a pipeline that 
is zero percent complete. Until it is 100 
percent complete, it transmits zero 
natural gas. The pipeline doesn’t work 
until you finish it, and that Russian 
disinformation we discovered the day 
the sanction legislation was signed was 
exactly that, was utterly false, non-
sense. 
Why? Because the day it was signed 
they stopped construction, and they 
stopped it for a year. And Putin only 
began construction after Joe Biden was 
elected, after he was sworn into office, 
and after his team indicated weakness, 
that they wouldn’t enforce the sanc-
tions against Russia. 
So their talking point that it was 90 
percent complete, that was true a year 
ago. And we knew we could stop it 
then. We can stop it now. The only rea-
son Putin is building this pipeline is 
because the Biden administration is 
unwilling to stand up to Russia. Ac-
cordingly, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, one 
thing that is demonstrably true is that 
Donald Trump did nothing as it relates 
toward this pipeline, and there wasn’t 
much effort to try to get them to stop 
the pipeline at the time. 
And while I disagreed with President 
Trump on a whole host of foreign pol-
icy issues, I did not hold up all his 
nominees just to get my view to be the 
order of the day. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, therefore, I ask that it 
be in order to make the same request 
that I made previously with respect to 
Executive Calendar No. 234, Elizabeth 
Moore Aubin, a Career Member of the 
Senior Foreign Service, to be Ambas-
sador of the United States to Algeria. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I would note, as the Senator from 
New Jersey knows well, that I pressed 
President Trump vigorously on this 
topic, engaged aggressively with the 
Trump administration, with the Treas-
ury Department, with the State De-
partment, with the National Security 
Council, and we prevailed in those bat-
tles. The Trump administration issued 
a series of sanctions, and they worked. 
They stopped the pipelines. 
So I have demonstrated a perfect 
willingness to stand up to a President 
of my own party on this issue, and we 
succeeded in stopping the pipeline. 
Now, when there is a Democratic Presi-
dent, we have yet to see Democratic 
Members of this body willing to stand 
up as vigorously to their own party’s 
President, who is actively and eagerly 
facilitating the building of this pipe-
line. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
would just simply say that the Senator 
from Texas did not hold up any of the 
nominees of President Trump as it re-
lates to this. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 235, Maria E. Brewer, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, to be Ambassador of the 
United States to the Kingdom of Leso-
tho. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because it is a gen-
erational geopolitical mistake to give 
a multibillion-dollar gift to Vladimir 
Putin to strengthen Russia and to un-
dermine national security, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar, 
No. 
236, 
Christopher 
John 
Lamora, a Career Member of the Sen-
ior Foreign Service, to be Ambassador 
of the United States to Cameroon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because it is a mas-
sive strategic error, one that weakens 
our allies, that endangers our allies, 
and makes Russia more dangerous, 
more aggressive, more willing to at-
tack and undermine U.S. national secu-
rity, and because Joe Biden and the 
Biden administration are defying U.S. 
law passed with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support from Congress, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 237, Tulinabo S. Mushingi, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, to be Ambassador of the 
United States to Angola and to serve 
concurrently as the Ambassador to the 
Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and 
Principe. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because the Biden 
administration should not be giving a 
massive 
multibillion-dollar 
gift 
to 
Putin, strengthening Russia, and weak-
ening America and U.S. national secu-
rity interests, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 238, Eugene S. Young, a Ca-
reer Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, to be Ambassador of the 
United States to the Republic of 
Congo. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, because I think it is a genera-
tional mistake, one that will harm U.S. 
nationality security interests, will en-
danger U.S. service men and women, 
will weaken America, will weaken our 
allies, and will strengthen our enemies 
and our adversaries, because I believe 
that Joe Biden giving a massive multi-
billion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin to 
make him stronger and more aggres-
sive is enormously harmful to America, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 239, Michele Jeanne Sison, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, to be Assistant Secretary of 
State for International Organization 
Affairs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because Joe Biden 
should not be giving a multibillion-dol-
lar gift to Vladimir Putin, strength-
ening Russia, and undermining U.S. na-
tional security, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, here 
is one where it is a monumental mis-
take to not permit this person to be 
confirmed when we want to stop 
fentanyl from coming into our country. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 240, Todd D. Robinson, of 
New Jersey, a Career Member of the 
Senior Foreign Service, to be Assistant 
Secretary of State for International 
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

has made the decision to give a mas-
sive multibillion-dollar gift to Vladi-
mir Putin, because that weakness to-
ward Russia empowers our enemies, en-
dangers our service men and women, 
weakens our national security, and de-
stroys jobs here at home, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 241, Daniel J. Kritenbrink, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, to be the Assistant Secretary 
of State for East Asian and Pacific af-
fairs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because Joe Biden 
should not be defying U.S. law, dis-
regarding the overwhelming bipartisan 
consensus of both Houses of Congress, 
because Joe Biden should not be giving 
a massive multibillion-dollar gift to 
Vladimir Putin that constitutes unilat-
eral surrender to Russia in a way that 
strengthens Russia, weakens America, 
and 
endangers 
our 
Nation, 
under-
mining U.S. national security, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 317, Marc Evans Knapper, a 
Career Member of the Senior Foreign 
Service, to be Ambassador of the 
United States to Vietnam; and that the 
Senator from Texas’ remarks, which he 
has made repeatedly, be inserted each 
and every time after the motion that I 
have made. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I appreciate my 
friend from New Jersey’s attempt to 
abbreviate this, and I am endeavoring 
to be concise but nonetheless lay out 
the factual predicate, because it was a 
mistake for Joe Biden to give a multi-
billion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin, to 
disregard U.S. law, to weaken U.S. na-
tional 
security 
interests 
and 
to 
strengthen Russia at our expense, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, now 
is here one where we heard a lot even 
during the debate we just had about 
the United Nations and the need for re-
form. Well, here is an opportunity. I 
ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 318, Christopher P. Lu, to 
be Representative of the United States 
of America to the United Nations for 
U.N. Management and Reform, with 
the rank of Ambassador. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because Joe Biden 
is giving a multibillion-dollar gift to 
Vladimir Putin, in defiance of U.S. law, 
in contravention of the overwhelming 
bipartisan 
consensus 
of 
Congress, 
which hurts America, strengthens Rus-
sia, and endangers the people of this 
Nation, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 319, Christopher P. Lu, to be 
an Alternate Representative of the 
United States of America to the Gen-
eral Assembly of the United Nations. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
my right to object, because Joe Biden 
is giving a multibillion-dollar gift to 
Vladimir Putin, which weakens Amer-
ica’s, strengthens Russia, and endan-
gers our national security, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 320, Rufus Gifford, to be 
Chief of Protocol, with the rank of Am-
bassador. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because it is a gen-
erational geopolitical mistake for Joe 
Biden to give a multibillion-dollar gift 
to Vladimir Putin, because that mis-
take weakens America, strengthens 
Russia, and endangers our national se-
curity, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, now, 
here is a generational mistake if we do 
not confirm the next person. We are in 
the midst in Latin America and the 
Caribbean of turmoil all around. We 
have the challenges of Venezuela, the 
Cuban people crying out for change, 
the situation in Haiti after the assas-
sination, Nicaragua becoming a new 
dictatorship. We need to have the As-
sistant Secretary of State for Western 
Hemisphere be out there helping us in 
the hemisphere. 
So I ask that it be in order to make 
the same request with respect to Exec-
utive Calendar No. 322, Brian A. Nich-
ols, a Career Member of the Senior For-
eign Service, to be Assistant Secretary 
of State for Western Hemisphere Af-
fairs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I can’t agree to 
move forward with this nominee today. 
I think this is really unfortunate. We 
could have avoided this. This could 
have been avoided altogether if the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
would simply disclose the responses to 
the questions for records to Members 
directly. Then Senators could review 
the nominees more quickly. 
Unfortunately, the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee has refused to do 
that, and so I have been forced to go to 
the State Department to get this infor-
mation. I received those responses on 
Monday evening. 
Just a few hours ago, I sent some ad-
ditional questions to the nominee. 
They would have been easy to respond 
to. I still await those responses, and I 
expect that I will receive them soon. 
But until then, I can’t do my job right. 
My advice and consent role can’t ade-
quately be performed without having 
the information. 
I am not going to relinquish that 
duty to represent the people of Utah on 
all matters and not just on those mat-
ters as to which I enjoy a seat on a 
committee. 
There is one type of Constitutional 
amendment that is preemptively un-
constitutional. All Senators are equal; 
you can’t treat them unequally. I de-
serve to have access to these answers, 
and they are not giving them to me. 
That is why we are here. That is why I 
can’t agree to this tonight, and I am 
not going to do that. I am not going to 
be bullied into it. They need to share 
this information. I therefore object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
don’t get to serve on every committee, 
and I don’t have the questions for the 
record of every committee hearing. 
Eventually, they get printed, and they 
are available to all Senators. But the 
suggestion that the Senator is being 
denied something when he is not a 
member of the committee is a unique 
one, to say the least. But nonetheless, 
I think there would have been another 
objection even if his interests were an-
swered. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 323, Marcela Escobari, to 
be an Assistant Administrator of the 
United States Agency for International 
Development. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object—and I would note 
something to my friend from New Jer-
sey, as the Senator from New Jersey 
knows—with respect to the previous 
nominee, I do not have a hold on the 
previous nominee. I have lifted my 
hold pursuant to discussions and nego-
tiations. The same is true with respect 
to former Senator Ken Salazar, who 
has been nominated to be Ambassador 
to Mexico. My understanding is he is 
going to be confirmed momentarily. I 
don’t have a hold, and I don’t believe 
there are any other holds or blocks to 
his confirmation. So that will occur 
momentarily.

August 10, 2021 
And, indeed, there have been several 
other nominees at the State Depart-
ment where I have lifted the holds in 
negotiations, including at the request 
of the Senator from New Jersey. I have 
worked with my colleagues, but at the 
same time used the leverage that we 
have as Senators to try to pressure the 
Biden administration to follow the law 
and to defend U.S. national security in-
terests. 
With regard to this particular unani-
mous consent request, because Joe 
Biden is giving Vladimir Putin a multi-
billion-gift, which is a generational 
geopolitical 
mistake, 
because 
it 
strengthens Russia at the expense of 
America and it undermines U.S. na-
tional security interests, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Executive Cal-
endar No. 324, Monica P. Medina, to be 
the Assistant Secretary of State for 
Oceans 
and 
International 
Environ-
mental and Scientific Affairs. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, because it is a gen-
erational geopolitical mistake for Joe 
Biden to give Vladimir Putin a multi-
billion-dollar gift that will continue 
for decades into the future, because 
that mistake strengthens Russia at the 
expense of America and it undermines 
U.S. national security, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, be-
fore I yield, finally, to my colleague 
from Connecticut, a member of the 
committee, I just want to say that in 
30 years of doing foreign policy be-
tween the House and the Senate, sit-
ting on both the House and Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, God forbid 
that something happens in one of these 
countries or in these regions where we 
do not have a confirmed Ambassador, 
Assistant Secretary of State, or Devel-
opment Official to promote our inter-
ests, to respond to it, to be able to deal 
with it. I wouldn’t want to be the Sen-
ator who held up that person when that 
happens at some point. I wouldn’t want 
to be the Senator who held up that per-
son when that happens at some point in 
the world. 
I yield to the Senator from Con-
necticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, 
Mr. Chairman. 
I am going to continue to propound 
these unanimous consent requests in 
the same form as the chairman of the 
Committee, but before I do, just a few 
brief remarks. I know the hour is late. 
First of all, it is wonderful to hear 
this 
revisionist 
history 
about 
the 
Trump administration’s disposition to-
wards Russia. Everybody knows what 
was going on. This was an administra-
tion that was practically sycophantish 
towards the Russian regime, refused 
over and over again to stand up in any 
meaningful way. 
That is why the pipeline got so far 
along. It was the eleventh hour when 
the Trump administration, at the very 
last minute, decided to move forward 
on sanctions. 
We are not here to paint the merits 
of the Trump administration’s deci-
sionmaking on Russia policy. But suf-
fice it to say, Russia did very well ex-
panding its influence around the region 
during the 4 years that Donald Trump 
was in office. 
Second, the effects of holding up all 
of these nominees is to kneecap Amer-
ican national security. Never, ever be-
fore has a President had so few nomi-
nees confirmed to key national secu-
rity posts than this President. It has 
never happened before. 
It is true that there is a history in 
this body of individual Senators plac-
ing a temporary hold on one or maybe 
two officials relevant to the policy 
over which they are having a disagree-
ment with the administration. Prob-
ably many Members of this body have 
done that. But at least in the time that 
I have been here and from what I have 
heard, never before has an individual 
Senator held up this many nominees 
for key national security posts over a 
disagreement on one specific policy. 
And if every single Senator did 
that—because every Senator here has a 
policy disagreement that they believe 
is significant with the Secretary of 
State, with the Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development, with the Sec-
retary of Defense—then the business of 
nominations and confirmations would 
grind to an absolute halt in this body. 
I had deep disagreements with Presi-
dent Trump, but never did I endeavor 
to hold up every single nominee to 
State Department posts, because I 
came to the conclusion that that would 
do much, much more harm to Amer-
ican national security than whatever 
concession I might get from the admin-
istration would provide a benefit to 
American national security. 
So I share this just, really, para-
lyzing fear that Senator MENENDEZ ex-
pressed, that something awful is going 
to happen without the kind of per-
sonnel that every President needs on 
post to do the job. We could probably 
get by if this was a hold of one or two 
or three individuals. We are talking 
about dozens of key national security 
posts that are left vacant because of 
the decision of one Senator. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, I will continue to pro-
pound these requests. I imagine the de-
cision will not be different. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request as those Senator MENEN-
DEZ was making with respect to Execu-
tive 
Calendar 
No. 
327, 
Anne 
A. 
Witkowsky, to be Assistant Secretary 
of State for Conflict and Stabilization 
Operations. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject. The Senator of Texas spoke of re-
visionist history. Perhaps it was fitting 
that he did so because we proceeded to 
hear quite a bit of revisionist history. 
The unfortunate reality is the Demo-
cratic Party in this Chamber has been 
reluctant to stand up to Russia and re-
luctant to stand up to the Soviet Union 
before that, for decades. The Demo-
cratic Party consistently has embraced 
weakness on Russia and the Soviet 
Union. 
I am old enough to remember Presi-
dent Barack Obama in debate with Re-
publican nominee MITT ROMNEY when 
MITT ROMNEY said we need to stand up 
to Russia. And President Obama stood 
up and said: MITT, the 1980s called and 
they want their foreign policy back be-
cause the Democratic Party position 
was weakness to Russia. 
I am old enough to remember Presi-
dent Obama leaning over to Medvedev 
caught on a hot mic saying: Tell Vladi-
mir—that would be Putin—I’ll have 
more flexibility after the election. 
It was only when Donald Trump was 
elected that the Democratic Party sud-
denly discovered Russia is a menace. I 
welcome that. I welcome that sudden 
discovery. I think Russia was a menace 
before and after. 
But for too many Senate Democrats, 
it is purely political. Russia, Russia, 
Russia was a stick to beat up on Don-
ald Trump and the substance of it 
didn’t matter. 
So the Senator from Connecticut 
said: Well, gosh, Donald Trump—he 
thinks—was terrible on Russia. 
Here is a simple fact. Under Presi-
dent Trump, we stopped the pipeline 
the day this sanctions legislation was 
signed into law. 
Under President Biden, Putin began 
building the pipeline again. Those are 
facts. You want to talk about who is 
weak on Russia? Those are simple 
facts, and those facts are dangerous. 
Because Joe Biden giving a multibil-
lion-dollar gift to Vladimir Putin was a 
generational geopolitical mistake be-
cause it strengthens Russia and it 
weakens America because it endangers 
U.S. national security interests, I ob-
ject.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6259 
August 10, 2021 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject. Just a few moments ago, the Sen-
ator from Connecticut said something 
bad is going to happen. Let me tell 
you, he is right. Something bad is 
going to happen, and there is a reason 
for it. 
The Biden foreign policy, in just 7 
months, has been the most disastrous 
foreign policy we have seen of any ad-
ministration since Jimmy Carter. To 
every enemy of America, they have 
projected weakness. 
On Russia, Joe Biden has given 
Vladimir Putin what he wanted most: 
A multibillion-dollar pipeline to let 
him extort Europe. 
On China, the Biden administration 
has been projecting weakness over and 
over and over again, including kow-
towing to China and reversing the 
State Department policy on Taiwan, 
prohibiting Taiwan from displaying 
their flag or wearing military uniforms 
on U.S. Government property; kow-
towing to the Communist Party of 
China. 
On Iran, the Biden administration 
said their top foreign policy objective 
is sending billions of dollars to the 
Ayatollah Khomeini, even as he is the 
leading state-sponsor of terrorism to 
the world and chants, ‘‘Death to Amer-
ica.’’ 
And on Hamas, the Biden administra-
tion has sent hundreds of millions of 
dollars to the Palestinian Authority, 
much of which has found its way to 
Hamas and has been materialized in 
rockets raining down on Israel. 
So is something bad going to happen? 
Yes, because when you show weak-
ness to our enemies, it encourages our 
enemies and they get more and more 
aggressive. 
Where I differ with the Senator from 
Connecticut is I don’t think the way to 
avoid something bad is to keep showing 
weakness and give Putin what he 
wants. The way to stand up to our en-
emies is to demonstrate strength, not 
weakness. I believe in peace through 
strength. I think appeasement invites 
conflict. 
Because Joe Biden’s multibillion-dol-
lar gift to Vladimir Putin is a genera-
tional geopolitical mistake, because it 
strengthens Russia at the expense of 
America, and because it undermines 
U.S. national security interests, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, because 
every single day that the President 
doesn’t have his team in place to pro-
tect this Nation, our Nation is under 
more serious threat. 
I ask that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Calendar 
No. 329, Mary Catherine Phee, a career 
member of the Senior Foreign Service 
to be a Member of the Board of Direc-
tors of the African Development Foun-
dation, for a term expiring September 
27, 2026. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. I would note one of 
the efforts that the State Department 
has endeavored to do to try to force 
these nominations through is planning 
a whole series of articles in papers, 
which they somehow believe would 
pressure me. The most abusing of 
which was an article, I believe, in PO-
LITICO, if I remember correctly, that 
began ominously: The mansions in Eu-
rope where our ambassadors reside are 
sadly empty due to this one Senator’s 
objections. 
I will confess, my heart is not broken 
that some rich Democratic donor is not 
wining and dining people in a grand 
ambassadorial mansion. I am sure that 
is an enormous crisis in Georgetown. 
What I think is a crisis is making 
Putin stronger and Russia stronger and 
weakening Europe, weakening our al-
lies, and weakening America. 
And because Biden’s multibillion-dol-
lar gift to Putin weakened America, 
strengthened Russia, and undermined 
our U.S. national security, I object.

tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS REQUEST CONSENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, because 
China is absolutely celebrating every 
single day that our Corps of diplomats 
is dramatically and dangerously under-
staffed because of these holds on the 
President’s nominees, I ask that it be 
in order to make the same request with 
respect to Executive Calendar No. 330, 
Mary Catherine Phee, a career member 
of the Senior Foreign Service to be a 
Member of the Board of Directors to 
the African Development Foundation, 
for a term expiring September 27, 2021. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject. I would note there is irony in the 
Senator from Connecticut expressing 
deep concern about China just an hour 
or 2 after this Chamber voted on an 
amendment I introduced that said we 
should not be importing electric vehi-
cles that were made in China using 
slave labor in concentration camps. 
The Senator from Connecticut and 
every single Democratic Senator, save 
one, voted to reject that amendment. 
The consequence is that the Biden 
administration is preparing to import 
millions of dollars of electric vehicles 
that were built—or parts of them were 
built—using slave labor in concentra-
tion camps in China. 
You want to talk about what is en-
couraging and empowering the Chinese 
Communist regime? 
It is the willingness of the Demo-
cratic Party to overlook their murder, 
torture in concentration camps be-
cause of their commitment to the 
Green New Deal. 
Because Joe Biden giving a multibil-
lion-dollar 
gift 
to 
Vladimir 
Putin 
strengthens Russia at the expense of 
America and it undermines U.S. na-
tional security interests, I object.

ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am at 
the final unanimous consent request, 
and I will make it in a moment. 
Just to note, as we are wrapping up 
here, this has taken a while, and this 
list of pending nominees is going to 
grow. It is going to get longer and 
longer. There are going to be more key 
posts that are going to go unfilled. 
I understand Senator CRUZ’s desire to 
use his power to hold these nominees in 
order to get a change in policy from 
this administration. I doubt that the 
administration, which has already set 
a clear direction and has executed an 
agreement with the Germans, is going 
to abide. 
My worry, though, is that this won’t 
be the end, that this is not going to be 
the last foreign policy decision that 
the Senator from Texas or other Re-
publican Senators will disagree with, 
nor will it likely be the last decision 
that any high-profile Cabinet member 
makes that finds disagreement from 
my Republican colleagues. 
And so I end where I began, which is 
to say that Senator CRUZ and I have a 
difference of opinion with respect to 
Nord Stream and the gravity of the 
moment that we find ourselves in. But 
this place just becomes unworkable if 
every single Senator holds up this 
many nominees over one particular 
policy disagreement. 
This tactic will be utilized by Demo-
crats when there is a Republican in the 
White House. It might not be me, be-
cause I find this objectionable, but it 
will be copied, and you will find the 
same thing happening to a Republican 
President 
and 
their 
administration 
grinding to a halt in whatever Depart-
ment finds itself the object of this tac-
tic. 
So I continue to express this deep 
worry about what it means to not have 
individuals in place in Somalia over-
seeing the Western Hemisphere and to 
not have someone overseeing our coun-
ternarcotics operations, but this list 
will get longer and longer and longer, 
and the risk to American security will 
be greater. 
Again, I will just suggest that the 
harm being done here to U.S. security 
is much greater than the benefit that 
the Senator believes will be gained 
through negotiation over these posts 
with the administration. 
So, at the risk of inspiring another 
very long speech from the Senator 
from Texas, I make those remarks. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. President, I ask, finally, that it 
be in order to make the same request, 
as I have and Senator MENENDEZ has, 
with respect to Executive Calendar No. 
150, Brett Holmgren to be an Assistant 
Secretary of State for Intelligence and 
Research. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, you know, the Sen-
ator from Connecticut is correct in 
that, if a Senator were to halt a large 
number of nominations for an idiosyn-
cratic concern, for a concern unique to 
that Senator that was not widely 
shared, that could constitute an abuse 
of power, and I am going to suggest 
some aspects of this situation that 
make it quite different and that, in a 
subsequent administration, if there 
were a comparable situation, would 
make these same levers appropriate. 
No. 1, the Biden administration is 
defying three separate Federal laws: 
two different Nord Stream 2 sanctions, 
both of which I authored, along with 
Democratic Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
both of which passed the Senate and 
the House and were signed into law, 
both of which enjoyed massive, near- 
unanimous bipartisan support. In addi-
tion to that is CAATSA—strong Russia 
sanctions that are mandatory, that are 
designed to force a President to sanc-
tion Russia even if they are reluctant 
to do so like Joe Biden is. 
Right now, the administration is 
defying the law, and so the message 
that I have conveyed to the adminis-
tration repeatedly is, follow the law. I 
am not asking for a change in the law; 
I am saying follow the law. That is No. 
1, if you have an administration that is 
openly defying the law, but No. 2, that 
is openly defying an overwhelming bi-
partisan consensus of Congress. 
This is not a narrow partisan issue. 
And I would note, after Joe Biden 
waived the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, 
in the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, I introduced an amendment to 
reverse his decision. Every single Sen-
ator but one on that committee voted 
in favor of my amendment. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut voted in favor of 
my amendment. The Senator from New 
Jersey voted in favor of my amend-
ment. 
The Biden administration is telling 
all of Congress, essentially: Jump in a 
lake. We don’t care that every Demo-
crat and virtually every Republican 
has a dramatically different assess-
ment of this situation than they do. 
Third is the national security mag-
nitude of this issue. This was a major 
national security victory. 
When I met with the Biden adminis-
tration, with each of their successive 
national 
security 
officials, 
I 
said: 
Look, I understand the instinct of any 
new administration to say, ‘‘Whatever 
the old guys did must be wrong.’’ I get 
that the Biden guys want to say,

‘‘Whatever Trump did must be wrong.’’ 
And by the way, the Trump guys, by 
and large, said, ‘‘Whatever Obama did 
must be wrong.’’ That is not a new 
thing. Whenever you have a change in 
an administration, that tends to be a 
default position. But what I urged 
them to do is, just because that is your 
knee-jerk instinct, this was a massive 
bipartisan victory for America, a na-
tional security victory that we won 
that Joe Biden is on the verge of 
throwing away. 
The Secretary of State sat in my of-
fice and promised to fight to sanction 
Nord Stream 2. The Deputy Secretary 
of State sat in my office and promised 
to fight to sanction Nord Stream 2. The 
Under Secretary of State sat in my of-
fice and promised to fight to sanction 
Nord Stream 2. They did, in fact, fight 
to sanction Nord Stream 2, but unfor-
tunately they were overruled by the 
White House, which made a political 
decision to give in to Putin. 
In those circumstances, when you are 
defying explicit U.S. law, when you are 
defying the overwhelming bipartisan 
consensus of Congress, and when you 
are endangering U.S. national security 
and, indeed, turning a victory into a 
loss, I think it is appropriate to use the 
tools we have in front of us. 
That being said, I have engaged in ac-
tive negotiation with the Biden admin-
istration. In the past week, I have had 
conversations on this topic with the 
Secretary of the Treasury, with the 
Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, with 
the National Security Advisor. I have 
had conversations with multiple Demo-
cratic Senators about a path forward. 
But I will tell you what the path for-
ward is not going to be. It is not going 
to be, let’s roll over, give Putin his 
pipeline, and accept a massive national 
security loss for America. If that is 
where Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS 
want to go, they can go there, but they 
are not going to go there with my ac-
quiescence, and I am going to use every 
tool I have as a Senator, elected by the 
people of Texas, to prevent that out-
come. 
Accordingly, because Joe Biden’s de-
cision to defy U.S. law; to defy the 
overwhelming bipartisan consensus of 
Congress; to surrender to Vladimir 
Putin; to give him his No. 1 priority— 
a multibillion-dollar pipeline that will 
provide billions of dollars of rewards 
for Russia for decades to come—be-
cause that decision is a generational 
geopolitical mistake on the order of 
magnitude of Jimmy Carter giving 
away the Panama Canal—that even 50 
years later, the consequences of that 
geopolitical mistake still reverberate— 
50 years from now, Russian dictators 
will benefit from Joe Biden’s weakness 
on Russia. 
Because that strengthens Russia, be-
cause it empowers Russia to attack our 
enemies, to extort our enemies, to en-
gage in economic blackmail against 
our enemies—our allies, rather—be-
cause our allies are begging us not to 
do this—I have met with senior offi-
cials of the Ukraine. The Ukrainians 
are begging us not to do this, and the 
Biden White House is threatening 
Ukraine: Keep your mouth shut be-
cause we have a political objective 
here. 
Because that strengthens Russia at 
the expense of the United States, at 
the expense of Europe, at the expense 
of our allies, because it destroys jobs in 
America, and because it endangers U.S. 
national security, I emphatically ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I un-
derstand the Senator believes he has 
such a serious objection to administra-
tion policy that it merits this excep-
tional tactic. I would submit, as I move 
into closing business, that it is not the 
biggest disagreement that a Senator 
has had with an administration. It is 
not the biggest disagreement that a 
group of Senators has had with an ad-
ministration. To believe that would be 
to elevate this dispute beyond its mer-
its. That is not to suggest it isn’t sig-
nificant, but it is not the most signifi-
cant disagreement that an individual 
Senator has ever had with an adminis-
tration. 
What is exceptional is his tactic. 
Never before has a U.S. Senator used 
their power in this way to hold up this 
many nominees at such a critical mo-
ment. That is what is exceptional. 
That is what makes this moment so 
dangerous. 
That 
is 
why 
Senator 
MENENDEZ and I came down to the floor 
to try to unlock some of these nomi-
nees toward confirmation, because it is 
the tactic, not the disagreement, that 
is the exception.

MORNING BUSINESS 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes-
terday, the Democrats unveiled their 
reckless tax and spend budget plan. 
With our country experiencing the 
highest inflation it has seen in decades 
and our national debt approaching an 
alltime high, common sense would dic-
tate that we ought to use the budget 
process to get our fiscal house in order. 
Instead, my Democrat colleagues are 
intent on using the budget to embark 
on a liberal wish list spending spree. 
My 
Democrat 
colleagues’ 
budget 
calls for over $4 trillion in new spend-
ing over the next decade and annual 
deficits would average $1.6 trillion over 
that period. As a result, the national 
debt would reach 119 percent of our 
economy, shattering the World War II 
record of 106 percent. 
Much of this new spending, bal-
looning the debt and deficits, is the 
product of a single bill Democrats hope 
to pass before the end of the year under 
the guise of so-called ‘‘human infra-
structure.’’ 
Infrastructure is popular and needed. 
It helps keep our economy competitive 
over the long run. That is why Demo-
crat leaders initially wanted their 
multitrillion dollar wish list to ride 
along on an infrastructure package. 
That plan fell apart when a bipartisan 
group was able to agree on a separate 
bill with just real infrastructure. 
This new spending spree, far from 
being an infrastructure bill like the bi-
partisan bill, has nothing to do with 
building roads or bridges. Instead, it 
would create massive new entitlements 
and impose massive new tax increases. 
This mishmash of massive new spend-
ing and job-killing tax hikes would act 
as a double whammy on middle-income 
Americans, small business owners, and 
farmers. 
Trillions of dollars in new spending is 
likely to set inflation ablaze. Inflation 
is a stealth tax that steals the value of 
the dollars Americans already earned. 
Hard-working Americans are already 
paying the price of excessive spending 
in the form of inflation with prices ris-
ing throughout the economy. 
As a result, while wages increased at 
a pace of 3.6 percent last month, Amer-
icans found themselves struggling to 
keep their heads above water with 
prices soaring 5.4 percent. 
Now, Democrats want to add tax 
hikes on top of this, which will slow 
economic growth, reduce business in-
vestment, and result in lower wages 
and fewer jobs over the long-run. 
What is more, the tax hikes that are 
being discussed take direct aim at fam-
ily run business and farms. 
This includes raising their income 
taxes, their capital gains taxes, and 
imposing a confiscatory new death tax 
when operations are passed to the next 
generation. 
Higher taxes, excessive spending, and 
escalating debt are not a prescription 
for prosperity. They are instead are a 
recipe for fiscal disaster. 
I urge my Democrat colleagues to tap 
the brakes before it is too late. 
Please think about the future and 
abandon your reckless tax and spend 
agenda.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On September 4, 2020, the CDC Director 
issued an Order temporarily halting evic-
tions in the United States for the reasons de-
scribed therein. That Order was set to expire 
on December 31, 2020, subject to further ex-
tension, modification, or rescission. Section 
502 of Title V, Division N of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the Order 
until January 31, 2021, and approved the 
Order as an exercise of the CDC’s authority 
under Section 361 of the Public Health Serv-
ice Act (42 U.S.C. 264). With the extension of 
the Order, Congress also provided $25 billion 
for emergency rental assistance for the pay-
ment of rent and rental arrears. Congress 
later provided an additional $21.55 billion in 
emergency rental assistance when it passed 
the American Rescue Plan. The Order was 
extended multiple times due to the changing 
public health landscape and expired on July 
31, 2021 after what was intended to be the 
final 
extension. 
Absent 
an 
unexpected 
change in the trajectory of the pandemic, 
CDC did not plan to extend the Order fur-
ther. 
Following 
the 
recent 
surge 
in 
cases 
brought forth by the highly transmissible 
Delta variant, the CDC Director now issues a 
new Order temporarily halting evictions for 
persons in counties or U.S. territories experi-
encing substantial or high rates of trans-
mission, for the reasons described herein. It 
is more limited in scope than prior orders, 
intended to target specific areas of the coun-
try where cases are rapidly increasing, which 
likely would be exacerbated by mass evic-
tions. 
Accordingly, subject to the limitations 
listed in the new Order, a landlord, owner of 
a residential property, or person with a legal 
right to pursue eviction or possessory action, 
shall not evict any covered person from any 
residential property in any county or U.S. 
territory while the county or territory is ex-
periencing substantial or high levels of com-
munity transmission levels of SARS–CoV–2. 
This Order will expire on October 3, 2021, but 
is subject to further extension, modification, 
or rescission based on public health cir-
cumstances. 
A copy of the Order is provided below. A

variant. It is intended to target specific 
areas of the country where cases are rapidly 
increasing, which likely would be exacer-
bated by mass evictions. Accordingly, sub-
ject to the limitations under ‘‘Applica-
bility,’’ a landlord, owner of a residential 
property, or other person with a legal right 
to pursue eviction or possessory action, shall 
not evict any covered person from any resi-
dential property in any county or U.S. terri-
tory while the county or territory is experi-
encing substantial or high levels of commu-
nity transmission of SARS–CoV–2. 
Definitions 
‘‘Available government assistance’’ means 
any governmental rental or housing pay-
ment benefits available to the individual or 
any household member. 
‘‘Available housing’’ means any available, 
unoccupied residential property, or other 
space for occupancy in any seasonal or tem-
porary housing, that would not violate fed-
eral, state, or local occupancy standards and 
that would not result in an overall increase 
of housing cost to such individual. 
‘‘Covered person’’ means any tenant, les-
see, or resident of a residential property who 
provides to their landlord, the owner of the 
residential property, or other person with a 
legal right to pursue eviction or a possessory 
action, a declaration under penalty of per-
jury indicating that: 
(1) The individual has used best efforts to 
obtain all available governmental assistance 
for rent or housing; 
(2) The individual either (i) earned no more 
than $99,000 (or $198,000 if filing jointly) in 
Calendar Year 2020 or expects to earn no 
more than $99,000 in annual income for Cal-
endar Year 2021 (or no more than $198,000 if 
filing a joint tax return), (ii) was not re-
quired to report any income in 2020 to the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or (iii) re-
ceived an Economic Impact Payment (stim-
ulus check). 
(3) The individual is unable to pay the full 
rent or make a full housing payment due to 
substantial loss of household income, loss of 
compensable hours of work or wages, a lay- 
off, or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical 
expenses; 
(4) The individual is using best efforts to 
make timely partial rent payments that are 
as close to the full rent payment as the indi-
vidual’s circumstances may permit, taking 
into account other nondiscretionary ex-
penses; 
(5) Eviction would likely render the indi-
vidual homeless—or force the individual to 
move into and reside in close quarters in a 
new congregate or shared living setting—be-
cause the individual has no other available 
housing options; and 
(6) The individual resides in a U.S. county 
experiencing substantial or high rates of 
community transmission levels of SARS– 
CoV–2 as defined by CDC. 
‘‘Evict’’ and ‘‘Eviction’’ means any action 
by a landlord, owner of a residential prop-
erty, or other person with a legal right to 
pursue eviction or possessory action, to re-
move or cause the removal of a covered per-
son from a residential property. This defini-
tion also does not prohibit foreclosure on a 
home mortgage. 
‘‘Residential property’’ means any prop-
erty leased for residential purposes, includ-
ing any house, building, mobile home or land 
in a mobile home park, or similar dwelling 
leased for residential purposes, but shall not 
include any hotel, motel, or other guest 
house rented to a temporary guest or sea-
sonal tenant as defined under the laws of the 
state, territorial, tribal, or local jurisdic-
tion. 
‘‘State’’ shall have the same definition as 
under 42 CFR 70.1, meaning ‘‘any of the 50 
states, plus the District of Columbia.’’ 
‘‘U.S. territory’’ shall have the same defi-
nition as under 42 CFR 70.1, meaning ‘‘any 
territory (also known as possessions) of the 
United States, including American Samoa, 
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.’’ 
Statement of Intent 
This Order shall be interpreted and imple-
mented in a manner as to achieve the fol-
lowing objectives: 
∑ Mitigating the spread of COVID–19 with-
in crowded, congregate or shared living set-
tings, or through unsheltered homelessness; 
∑ Mitigating the further spread of COVID– 
19 from one state or territory into any other 
state or territory; 
∑ Mitigating the further spread of COVID– 
19 by temporarily suspending the eviction of 
covered persons from residential property for 
nonpayment of rent; and 
∑ Supporting response efforts to COVID–19 
at the federal, state, local, territorial, and 
tribal levels. 
Background 
COVID–19 in the United States 
Since January 2020, the respiratory disease 
known as ‘‘COVID–19,’’ caused by a novel 
coronavirus (SARS–COV–2), has spread glob-
ally, including cases reported in all fifty 
states within the United States, plus the 
District of Columbia and U.S. territories. As 
of August 3, 2021, there have been almost 200 
million cases of COVID–19 globally, resulting 
in over 4,240,000 deaths. Almost 35,000,000 
cases have been identified in the United 
States, with new cases reported daily, and 
almost 610,000 deaths have been attributed to 
the disease. A renewed surge in cases in the 
United States began in early July 2021; case 
counts rose from 19,000 cases on July 1, 2021 
to 103,000 cases on July 30, 2021. Forecasted 
case counts predict that cases will continue 
to rise over the next four weeks. 
The virus that causes COVID–19 spreads 
very easily and sustainably between people, 
particularly those who are in close contact 
with one another (within about 6 feet, but 
occasionally over longer distances), mainly 
through respiratory droplets produced when 
an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. 
Individuals without symptoms can also 
spread the virus. Among adults, the risk for 
severe illness from COVID–19 increases with 
age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe 
illness means that persons with COVID–19 
may require hospitalization, intensive care, 
or a ventilator to help them breathe, and 
may be fatal. People of any age with certain 
underlying medical conditions (e.g., cancer, 
obesity, serious heart conditions, or diabe-
tes) are at increased risk for severe illness 
from COVID–19. 
New variants of SARS–CoV–2 have emerged 
globally, several of which have been identi-
fied as variants of concern, including the 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants. 
These variants of concern have evidence of 
an increase in transmissibility, which may 
lead to higher incidence. 
Currently, the Delta variant is the pre-
dominant SARS–CoV–2 strain circulating in 
the United States, estimated to account for 
over 82% of cases as of July 17, 2021. The 
Delta variant has demonstrated increased 
levels of transmissibility compared to other 
variants. Furthermore, early evidence sug-
gests that people who are vaccinated and be-
come infected with the Delta variant may 
transmit the virus to others. 
Transmission of the Delta variant has led 
to accelerated community transmission in 
the United States. CDC recommends assess-
ing the level of community transmission 
using, at a minimum, two metrics: new 
COVID–19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 
7 days and percentage of positive SARS– 
CoV–2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification 
tests in the last 7 days. For each of these 
metrics, CDC classifies transmission values 
as low, moderate, substantial, or high. As of 
August 1, 2021, over 80% of the U.S. counties 
were classified as experiencing substantial or 
high levels of community transmission. In 
areas of substantial or high transmission, 
CDC recommends community leaders en-
courage vaccination and universal masking 
in indoor public spaces in addition to other 
layered prevention strategies to prevent fur-
ther spread. 
COVID–19 vaccines are now widely avail-
able in the United States, and vaccination is 
recommended for all people 12 years of age 
and older. Three COVID–19 vaccines are cur-
rently authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for emergency use: 
Two mRNA vaccines and one viral vector 
vaccine, each of which has been determined 
to be safe and effective against COVID–19. As 
of July 28, 2021, over 163 million people in the 
United States (57.6% of the population 12 
years or older) have been fully vaccinated 
and over 189 million people in the United 
States (66.8% of the population 12 years or 
older) have received at least one dose. 
Changes in vaccine uptake and the extreme 
transmissibility of the Delta variant have re-
sulted in rising numbers of COVID–19 cases, 
primarily and disproportionately affecting 
the unvaccinated population. 
The COVID–19 vaccination effort has a 
slower rate of penetration among the popu-
lations most likely to experience eviction. In 
combination with the continued underlying 
COVID–19 spread, and the overlapping fac-
tors described above, this creates consider-
able risk for rapid transmission of COVID–19 
in high-risk settings. 
In the context of a pandemic, eviction mor-
atoria—like quarantine, isolation, and social 
distancing—can be an effective public health 
measure utilized to prevent the spread of 
communicable disease. Eviction moratoria 
facilitate self-isolation and self-quarantine 
by people who become ill or who are at risk 
of transmitting COVID–19. 
Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Re-
lief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act 
(Pub. L. 116–136) to aid individuals and busi-
nesses adversely affected by COVID–19 in 
March 2020. Section 4024 of the CARES Act 
provided a 120-day moratorium on eviction 
filings as well as other protections for ten-
ants in certain rental properties with federal 
assistance or federally related mortgage fi-
nancing. These protections helped alleviate 
the public health consequences of tenant dis-
placement during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The CARES Act eviction moratorium ex-
pired on July 24, 2020. The protections in the 
CARES Act supplemented temporary evic-
tion moratoria and rent freezes implemented 
by governors and other local officials using 
emergency powers. 
Researchers estimated that this temporary 
federal moratorium provided relief to over 
one-quarter a material portion of the na-
tion’s 
roughly 
43 
million 
renters. 
The 
CARES act also provided funding streams for 
emergency rental assistance; surveys esti-
mate that this assistance became available 
to the public through rental assistance pro-
grams by July 2020. 
The Federal moratorium provided by the 
CARES Act, however, did not reach all rent-
ers. Many renters who fell outside the scope 
of the Federal moratorium were instead pro-
tected under state and local moratoria. In 
early March 2021, the Census Household 
Pulse Survey estimated that 6.4 million 
households were behind on rent and just 
under half fear imminent eviction. In 2016, 
research showed that there were 3.6 million 
eviction filings and 1.5 million eviction judg-
ments over the span of a whole year, mean-
ing that the pandemic would cause a wave of

evictions on a scale that would be unprece-
dented in modern times. A large portion of 
those who are evicted may move into close 
quarters in shared housing or, as discussed 
below, become homeless, thus becoming at 
higher risk of COVID–19. 
On September 4, 2020, the CDC Director 
issued an Order temporarily halting evic-
tions in the United States for the reasons de-
scribed therein. That Order was set to expire 
on December 31, 2020, subject to further ex-
tension, modification, or rescission. Section 
502 of Title V, Division N of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the Order 
until January 31, 2021, and approved the 
Order as an exercise of the CDC’s authority 
under Section 361 of the Public Health Serv-
ice Act (42 U.S.C. 264). With the extension of 
the Order, Congress also provided $25 billion 
for emergency rental assistance for the pay-
ment of rent and rental arrears. Congress 
later provided an additional $21.55 billion in 
emergency rental assistance when it passed 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The 
Order was extended multiple times due to 
the changing public health landscape and ex-
pired on July 31, 2021 after what was in-
tended to be the final extension. Absent an 
unexpected change in the trajectory of the 
pandemic, CDC did not plan to extend the 
Order further. 
Following 
the 
recent 
surge 
in 
cases 
brought forth by the highly transmissible 
Delta variant, the CDC Director now issues a 
new Order temporarily halting evictions for 
persons in counties experiencing substantial 
or high rates of transmission, for the reasons 
described herein. This Order will expire on 
October 3, 2021, but is subject to further ex-
tension, modification, or rescission based on 
public health circumstances. 
Researchers estimate that, in 2020, Fed-
eral, state, and local eviction moratoria led 
to over 1.5 million fewer evictions filings 
than the previous year. Additional research 
shows that, despite the CDC eviction mora-
torium leading to an estimated 50% decrease 
in eviction filings compared to the historical 
average, there have still been over 450,000 
eviction filings during the pandemic just 
within approximately 31 cities and six states 
with more readily available data. This data 
covers approximately 1 in 4 renter house-
holds in the country, suggesting high de-
mand and likelihood of mass evictions na-
tionwide. 
Eviction, Crowding, and Interstate Trans-
mission of COVID–19 
By February 10, 2021, the U.S. Department 
of the Treasury had paid all of the $25 billion 
made available by the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2021 to states, territories, lo-
calities and tribes for the purpose of pro-
viding emergency rental assistance to eligi-
ble households in their jurisdictions. Addi-
tionally, as directed in the Act, Treasury has 
also made available 40 percent—more than 
$8.6 billion—of the additional funding to 
states, territories and localities for emer-
gency rental assistance provided in the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. While 
some emergency rental assistance programs 
were slow to open, every State program had 
opened by early June. Based on data col-
lected from grantees, Treasury reports that 
over 85,000 renter households received rental 
and utility assistance to support their hous-
ing stability by the end of March and this 
number increased to more than 100,000 in 
April, more than 156,000 in May and over 
290,000 in June. Though emergency rental as-
sistance has clearly started to reach increas-
ing numbers of families over recent months, 
state and local agencies have hundreds of 
thousands of applications for assistance that 
currently remain outstanding as programs 
accelerate their activity. The level of assist-
ance continued to increase in June, with 
nearly 300,000 households served. Based on 
analysis of grantee reporting, Treasury be-
lieves that the monthly deployment of rental 
assistance by state and local emergency 
rental assistance programs will continue to 
increase from the significant deployment in 
June. In addition to Emergency Rental As-
sistance, there are coordinated efforts across 
Federal agencies to—in partnership with 
states and localities—promote eviction pre-
vention strategies. 
Recent data from the U.S. Census House-
hold Pulse Survey demonstrates that just 
under half of households behind on rent be-
lieve that an eviction is likely in the next 
two months. A surge in evictions could lead 
to the immediate and significant movement 
of large numbers of persons from lower den-
sity to higher density housing at a time in 
the United States when the highly trans-
missible Delta variant is driving COVID–19 
cases at an unprecedented rate. 
Evicted renters must move, which leads to 
multiple outcomes that increase the risk of 
COVID–19 spread. Specifically, many evicted 
renters move into close quarters in shared 
housing or other congregate settings. These 
moves may require crossing state borders. 
According to the 2017 Census Bureau Amer-
ican Housing Survey, 32% of renters reported 
that they would move in with friends or fam-
ily members upon eviction, which would in-
troduce new household members and poten-
tially increase household crowding. Studies 
show that COVID–19 transmission occurs 
readily within households. The secondary at-
tack rate in households has been estimated 
to be 17%, and household contacts are esti-
mated to be 6 times more likely to become 
infected by an index case of COVID–19 than 
other close contacts. A study of pregnant 
women in New York City showed that women 
in large households (greater number of resi-
dents per household) were three times as 
likely to test positive for SARS–CoV–2 than 
those in smaller households, and those in 
neighborhoods 
with 
greater 
household 
crowding (>1 resident per room) were twice 
as likely to test positive. Throughout the 
United States, counties with the highest pro-
portion of crowded households have experi-
enced COVID–19 mortality rates 2.6 times 
those of counties with the lowest proportion 
of crowded households. 
Shared housing is not limited to friends 
and family. It includes a broad range of set-
tings, including transitional housing and do-
mestic violence and abuse shelters. Special 
considerations exist for such housing be-
cause of the challenges of maintaining social 
distance. Residents often gather closely or 
use shared equipment, such as kitchen appli-
ances, laundry facilities, stairwells, and ele-
vators. Residents may have unique needs, 
such as disabilities, chronic health condi-
tions, cognitive decline, or limited access to 
technology, and thus may find it more dif-
ficult to take actions to protect themselves 
from COVID–19. CDC recommends that shel-
ters provide new residents with a clean 
mask, keep them isolated from others, 
screen for symptoms at entry, or arrange for 
medical evaluations as needed depending on 
symptoms. Accordingly, an influx of new 
residents at facilities that offer support serv-
ices could potentially overwhelm staff and, if 
recommendations are not followed, lead to 
exposures. 
Modeling studies and observational data 
from the pre-vaccine phase of the COVID–19 
pandemic 
comparing 
incidence 
between 
states that implemented and lifted eviction 
moratoria indicate that evictions substan-
tially contribute to COVID–19 transmission. 
In mathematical models where eviction led 
exclusively to sharing housing with friends 
or family, lifting eviction moratoria led to a 
30% increased risk of contracting COVID–19 
among people who were evicted and those 
with whom they shared housing after evic-
tion. Compared to a scenario where no evic-
tions occurred, the models also predicted a 
4%–40% increased risk of infection, even for 
those who did not share housing, as a result 
of increased overall transmission. The au-
thors estimated that anywhere from 1,000 to 
100,000 excess cases per million population 
could be attributable to evictions depending 
on the eviction and infection rates. 
An analysis of observational data from 
state-based eviction moratoria in 43 states 
and the District of Columbia showed signifi-
cant increases in COVID–19 incidence and 
mortality approximately 2–3 months after 
eviction moratoria were lifted. Specifically, 
the authors compared the COVID–19 inci-
dence and mortality rates in states that lift-
ed their moratoria with the rates in states 
that maintained their moratoria. In these 
models, the authors accounted for time-vary-
ing indicators of each state’s test count as 
well as major public-health interventions in-
cluding lifting stay-at-home orders, school 
closures, and mask mandates. After adjust-
ing for these other changes, they found that 
the incidence of COVID–19 in states that lift-
ed their moratoria was 1.6 times that of 
states that did not at 10 weeks post-lifting 
(95% CI 1.0, 2.3), a ratio that grew to 2.1 at 
≥16 weeks (CI 1.1, 3.9). Similarly, they found 
that mortality in states that lifted their 
moratoria was 1.6 times that of states that 
did not at 7 weeks post-lifting (CI 1.2, 2.3), a 
ratio that grew to 5.4 at ≥16 weeks (CI 3.1, 
9.3). The authors estimated that, nationally, 
over 433,000 cases of COVID–19 and over 10,000 
deaths could be attributed to lifting state 
moratoria. 
Although data are limited, available evi-
dence suggests evictions lead to interstate 
spread of COVID–19 in two ways. First, an 
eviction may lead the evicted members of a 
household to move across state lines. Of the 
35 million people in America who move each 
year, 15% move to a new state. Second, even 
if a particular eviction, standing alone, 
would not always result in interstate dis-
placement, the mass evictions that would 
occur in the absence of this Order would in-
evitably increase the interstate spread of 
COVID–19. This Order cannot effectively 
mitigate interstate transmission of COVID– 
19 without covering intrastate evictions 
(evictions occurring within the boundaries of 
a state or territory), as the level of spread of 
SARS–CoV–2 resulting from these evictions 
can lead to SARS–CoV–2 transmission across 
state borders. 
Moreover, 
intrastate 
spread 
facilitates 
interstate spread in the context of commu-
nicable disease spread, given the nature of 
infectious disease. In the aggregate, the 
mass-scale evictions that will likely occur in 
the absence of this Order in areas of substan-
tial or high transmission will inevitably in-
crease interstate spread of COVID–19. 
Eviction, 
Homelessness, 
and 
COVID–19 
Transmission 
Evicted individuals without access to sup-
port or other assistance options may become 
homeless, including older adults or those 
with underlying medical conditions, who are 
more at risk for severe illness from COVID– 
19 than the general population. In Seattle- 
King County, 5–15% of people experiencing 
homelessness between 2018 and 2020 cited 
eviction as the primary reason for becoming 
homeless. Additionally, some individuals and 
families who are evicted may originally stay 
with family or friends, but subsequently seek 
homeless services. Data collection by an 
emergency 
shelter 
in 
Columbus, 
Ohio, 
showed that 35.4% of families and 11.4% of 
single adults reported an eviction as the pri-
mary or secondary reason for their seeking 
shelter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6265 
August 10, 2021 
Extensive outbreaks of COVID–19 have 
been identified in homeless shelters. In Se-
attle, Washington, a network of three re-
lated homeless shelters experienced an out-
break that led to 43 cases among residents 
and staff members. In Boston, Massachu-
setts, universal COVID–19 testing at a single 
shelter revealed 147 cases, representing 36% 
of shelter residents. COVID–19 testing in a 
single shelter in San Francisco led to the 
identification of 101 cases (67% of those test-
ed). Data from 634 universal diagnostic test-
ing events at homeless shelters in 21 states 
show an average of 6% positivity among 
shelter clients. Data comparing the inci-
dence or severity of COVID–19 among people 
experiencing homelessness directly to the 
general population are limited. However, 
during the 15-day period of the outbreak in 
Boston, MA, researchers estimated a cumu-
lative incidence of 46.3 cases of COVID–19 per 
1000 persons experiencing homelessness, as 
compared to 1.9 cases per 1000 among Massa-
chusetts adults (pre-print). 
Among other things, CDC guidance rec-
ommends increasing physical distance be-
tween beds in homeless shelters, which is 
likely to decrease capacity, while commu-
nity transmission of COVID–19 is occurring. 
To adhere to this guidance, shelters have 
limited the number of people served through-
out the United States. In many places, con-
siderably fewer beds are available to individ-
uals who become homeless. Shelters that do 
not adhere to the guidance, and operate at 
ordinary or increased occupancy, are at 
greater risk for the types of outbreaks de-
scribed above. 
Application of COVID–19 Prevention Strate-
gies Based on Community Transmission 
CDC recommends strengthening or adding 
effective COVID–19 mitigation strategies in 
communities with considerable transmission 
risk. As discussed above, CDC guidance 
specifies that everyone, regardless of vac-
cination status, should wear masks in indoor 
and public settings in communities experi-
encing substantial or high rates of commu-
nity transmission. Similarly, CDC guidance 
for homeless shelters recommends maintain-
ing layered COVID–19 precautions as long as 
community transmission is occurring and 
provides options for scaling back precautions 
when community transmission is low. 
Eviction moratoria represent a COVID–19 
transmission prevention measure that can 
similarly be applied when the epidemiolog-
ical context is appropriate, for example in 
communities with substantial or high trans-
mission of COVID–19. Prevention strategies 
like these should only be relaxed or lifted 
after two weeks of continuous sustained im-
provement in the level of community trans-
mission. In areas with low or no SARS–CoV– 
2 transmission and with testing capacity in 
place to detect early introduction or in-
creases in spread of the virus, layered pre-
vention strategies might be removed one at 
a time while monitoring closely for any evi-
dence that COVID–19 cases are increasing. 
Decisions to add or remove prevention strat-
egies should be based on local data and pub-
lic health recommendations. The emergence 
of more transmissible SARS–CoV–2 variants, 
including Delta, increases the urgency for 
public health agencies and other organiza-
tions to collaboratively monitor the status 
of the pandemic in their communities and 
continue to apply layered prevention strate-
gies. 
Persons at Higher Risk of Eviction May Also 
Be at Higher Risk of Being Unvaccinated 
Communities with high rates of eviction 
have been shown to have lower coverage of 
COVID–19 vaccination—a focus for current 
vaccination campaigns. A study in the spring 
of 2021 showed that counties with high social 
vulnerability (i.e., social and structural fac-
tors associated with adverse health outcome 
inclusive of socioeconomic indicators related 
to risk of eviction)had lower levels of 
COVID–19 vaccination. 
CDC Eviction Moratorium 
The Department of the Treasury has made 
funding available to states, territories, local-
ities, and Tribal governments, which con-
tinue to distribute emergency rental assist-
ance funds that may help mitigate spikes in 
COVID–19 transmission due to increases in 
evictions. Alongside other federal and state 
efforts to prevent evictions, these funds are 
expected to make a meaningful difference for 
hundreds of thousands of people who are ex-
pected to receive the rental assistance. 
On September 4, 2020, the CDC Director 
issued an Order temporarily halting evic-
tions in the United States for the reasons de-
scribed therein. That Order was set to expire 
on December 31, 2020, subject to further ex-
tension, modification, or rescission. Section 
502 of Title V, Division N of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the Order 
until January 31, 2021. With the extension of 
the Order, Congress also provided $25 billion 
for emergency rental assistance for the pay-
ment of rent and rental arrears. Congress 
later provided an additional $21.55 billion in 
emergency rental assistance when it passed 
the American Rescue Plan. 
On January 29, 2021, following an assess-
ment of the ongoing pandemic, the CDC Di-
rector renewed the Order until March 31, 
2021. On March 28, the CDC Director renewed 
the Order until June 30, 2021. On June 24, the 
CDC Director renewed the Order until July 
31, 2021 (July Order). The CDC Director indi-
cated that the July Order would be the final 
extension of the nationwide eviction morato-
rium absent an unexpected change in the 
trajectory of the pandemic. Unfortunately, 
the rise of the Delta variant and cor-
responding rise in cases in numerous coun-
ties in the United States have altered the 
trajectory of the pandemic. As a result, CDC 
is issuing this narrower, more targeted Order 
to temporarily halt evictions in the hardest 
hit areas. Without this Order, evictions in 
these areas would likely exacerbate the in-
crease in cases. To the extent any provision 
of this Order conflicts with prior Orders, this 
Order is controlling. 
Applicability 
This Order applies in U.S. counties experi-
encing substantial and high levels of commu-
nity transmission levels of SARS–CoV–2 as 
defined by CDC, as of August 3, 2021. If a U.S. 
county that is not covered by this Order as 
of August 3, 2021 later experiences substan-
tial or high levels of community trans-
mission while this Order is in effect, then 
that county will become subject to this 
Order as of the date the county begins expe-
riencing substantial or high levels of com-
munity transmission. If a U.S. county that is 
covered by this Order no longer experiences 
substantial or high levels of community 
transmission for 14 consecutive days, then 
this Order will no longer apply in that coun-
ty, unless and until the county again experi-
ences substantial or high levels of commu-
nity transmission while this Order is in ef-
fect. 
This Order does not apply in any state, 
local, territorial, or tribal area with a mora-
torium on residential evictions that provides 
the same or greater level of public-health 
protection than the requirements listed in 
this Order or to the extent its application is 
prohibited by Federal court order. In accord-
ance with 42 U.S.C. 264(e), this Order does not 
preclude state, local, territorial, and tribal 
authorities from imposing additional re-
quirements that provide greater public- 
health protection and are more restrictive 
than the requirements in this Order. 
This Order is a temporary eviction morato-
rium to prevent the further spread of 
COVID–19. This Order does not relieve any 
individual of any obligation to pay rent, 
make a housing payment, or comply with 
any other obligation that the individual may 
have under a tenancy, lease, or similar con-
tract. Nothing in this Order precludes the 
charging or collecting of fees, penalties, or 
interest as a result of the failure to pay rent 
or other housing payment on a timely basis, 
under the terms of any applicable contract. 
Nothing in this Order precludes evictions 
based on a tenant, lessee, or resident: (1) En-
gaging in criminal activity while on the 
premises; (2) threatening the health or safety 
of other residents; (3) damaging or posing an 
immediate and significant risk of damage to 
property; (4) violating any applicable build-
ing code, health ordinance, or similar regula-
tion relating to health and safety; or (5) vio-
lating any other contractual obligation, 
other than the timely payment of rent or 
similar housing-related payment (including 
non-payment or late payment of fees, pen-
alties, or interest). 
Any evictions for nonpayment of rent ini-
tiated prior to issuance of this Order but not 
yet completed, are subject to this Order. Any 
tenant, lessee, or resident of a residential 
property who previously submitted a Dec-
laration, still qualifies as a ‘‘Covered Per-
son’’ and is still present in a rental unit is 
entitled to protections under this Order. Any 
eviction that was completed before issuance 
of this Order including from August 1 
through August 3, 2021 is not subject to this 
Order, as it does not operate retroactively. 
Under this Order, covered persons may be 
evicted for engaging in criminal activity 
while on the premises. But covered persons 
may not be evicted on the sole basis that 
they are alleged to have committed the 
crime of trespass (or similar state-law of-
fense) where the underlying activity is a cov-
ered person remaining in a residential prop-
erty for nonpayment of rent. Permitting 
such evictions would result in substantially 
more evictions overall, thus increasing the 
risk of disease transmission as otherwise 
covered persons move into congregate set-
tings or experience homelessness. This result 
would be contrary to the stated objectives of 
this Order, and therefore would diminish 
their effectiveness. Moreover, to the extent 
such criminal trespass laws are invoked to 
establish criminal activity solely based on a 
tenant, lessee, or resident of a residential 
property remaining in a residential property 
despite the nonpayment of rent, such invoca-
tion conflicts with this Order and is pre-
empted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 264(e). 
Individuals who are confirmed to have, 
who have been exposed to, or who might 
have COVID–19 and take reasonable pre-
cautions to not spread the disease may not 
be evicted on grounds that they may pose a 
health or safety threat to other residents. 
This Order is in effect through October 3, 
2021, based on the current and projected epi-
demiological context of SARS–CoV–2 trans-
mission throughout the United States. This 
timeframe will allow the assessment of nat-
ural changes to COVID–19 incidence, the in-
fluences of new variants, additional distribu-
tion of emergency rental assistance funds, 
and the expansion of COVID–19 vaccine up-
take. 
Declaration Forms 
To qualify for the protections of this 
Order, a tenant, lessee, or resident of a resi-
dential property must provide a completed 
and signed copy of a declaration with the 
elements listed in the definition of ‘‘Covered 
person’’ to their landlord, owner of the resi-
dential property where they live, or other 
person who has a right to have them evicted

or removed from where they live. To assist 
tenants and landlords, the CDC created a 
standardized declaration form that can be 
downloaded 
here: 
https://www.cdc.gov/ 
coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/declaration- 
form.pdf. 
Tenants, lessees, and residents of residen-
tial property are not obligated to use the 
CDC form. Any written document that an el-
igible tenant, lessee, or resident of residen-
tial property presents to their landlord will 
comply with this Order, as long as it con-
tains the required elements of ‘‘Covered per-
son’’ as described in this Order. In they meet 
the elements of ‘‘Covered person’’ in other 
languages. 
All declarations, regardless of form used, 
must be signed, and must include a state-
ment that the tenant, lessee, or resident of a 
residential property understands that they 
could be liable for perjury for any false or 
misleading statements or omissions in the 
declaration. This Order does not preclude a 
landlord challenging the truthfulness of a 
tenant’s, lessee’s, or resident’s declaration in 
court, as permitted under state or local law. 
In certain circumstances, such as individ-
uals filing a joint tax return, it may be ap-
propriate for one member of the residence to 
provide an executed declaration on behalf of 
the other adult residents party to the lease, 
rental agreement, or housing contract. The 
declaration may be signed and transmitted 
either electronically or by hard copy. 
As long as the information in a previously 
signed declaration submitted under a pre-
vious order remains truthful and accurate, 
covered persons do not need to submit a new 
declaration under this Order. However, eligi-
bility for protection will be based on the 
terms of this Order. 
Determination, Findings and Action 
For the reasons described herein, I have de-
termined based on the information below 
that issuing a temporary halt in evictions in 
counties experiencing substantial or high 
levels of COVID–19 transmission constitutes 
a reasonably necessary measure under 42 
CFR 70.2 to prevent the further spread of 
COVID–19 throughout the United States. I 
have further determined that measures by 
states, localities, or territories that do not 
meet or exceed these minimum protections 
are insufficient to prevent the interstate 
spread of COVID–19. 
State and local jurisdictions continue to 
distribute 
emergency 
rental 
assistance 
funds, provided by the Department of Treas-
ury, that will help avert a spate of evictions 
and thus mitigate corresponding spikes in 
COVID–19 transmission. Trends have dra-
matically worsened since June 2021 and 
transmission is rapidly accelerating in the 
United States. 
Congress has appropriated approximately 
$46 billion—of which almost three-quarters is 
currently available to state and local grant-
ees—to help pay rent and rental arrears for 
tenants who may otherwise be at high risk of 
eviction. According to estimates based on 
the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey, ap-
proximately 6.9 million renter households 
were behind on their rent in late June. At 
that time, about 4.6 million renter house-
holds were concerned that they could not 
pay next month’s rent. The successful deliv-
ery of those funds by states and localities 
should greatly reduce the incidence of evic-
tion that would occur in the absence of that 
support. However, many states and localities 
are still ramping up the collection and proc-
essing of applications and the delivery of as-
sistance and putting in place other eviction 
prevention strategies. It was only in the be-
ginning of June that all state-run emergency 
rental assistance programs had opened for 
applications. If the moratorium is not in 
place, a wave of evictions, on the order of 
hundreds of thousands, could occur in late 
summer and early fall, exacerbating the 
spread of COVID–19 among the significant 
percentage of the population that remains 
unvaccinated. In appropriating these emer-
gency rental assistance funds, Congress in-
tended that the funding would work in con-
cert with the eviction moratorium, providing 
time for rental assistance to reach eligible 
tenants and landlords to sustainably reduce 
the threat of an eviction wave after an evic-
tion moratorium was no longer in effect. 
While the pace of assistance is continuing to 
increase, without additional time for states 
and localities to deliver this needed relief 
and engage in other efforts to prevent evic-
tions, a surge of evictions would occur upon 
the conclusion of the national moratorium. 
A surge in evictions would lead to immediate 
movement, crowding, and increased stress on 
the homeless service system. In combination 
with surging COVID–19 rates across the 
country, and the overlapping factors de-
scribed above, this would create considerable 
risk for the rapid transmission of COVID–19 
in high-risk settings. 
Based on the convergence of these issues, I 
have determined that issuing a new Order 
temporarily halting evictions is appropriate. 
Accordingly, a landlord, owner of a resi-
dential property, or other person with a legal 
right to pursue eviction or possessory action 
shall not evict any covered person from any 
residential property in any county or U.S. 
territory while COVID–19 transmission is 
substantial or high and the relevant state, 
county, locality, or territory has provided a 
level of public-health protections below the 
requirements listed in this Order. 
This Order is not a rule within the mean-
ing of the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) but rather an emergency action taken 
under the existing authority of 42 CFR 70.2. 
The purpose of section 70.2, which was pro-
mulgated through notice-and-comment rule-
making, is to enable CDC to take swift steps 
to prevent contagion without having to seek 
a second round of public comments and with-
out a delay in effective date. 
Good Cause 
In the event this Order qualifies as a rule 
under the APA, there is good cause to dis-
pense with prior public notice and comment 
and a delay in effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(B), (d)(3). Good cause exists, in sum, 
because the public health emergency caused 
by the COVID–19 pandemic and the unpre-
dictability of the trajectory of the pandemic 
make it impracticable and contrary to the 
public health, and by extension the public in-
terest, to delay the issuance and effective 
date of this Order. 
I have determined that good cause exists 
because the public health emergency caused 
by COVID–19 makes it impracticable and 
contrary to the public health, and by exten-
sion the public interest, to delay the 
issuance and effective date of the Order. A 
delay in the effective date of the Order would 
permit the occurrence of evictions—poten-
tially on a mass scale—that would have po-
tentially 
significant 
public 
health 
con-
sequences. I conclude that the delay in the 
effective date of the Order would defeat the 
purpose of the Order and endanger the public 
health and, therefore, determine that imme-
diate action is necessary. 
The rapidly changing nature of the pan-
demic requires not only that CDC act swift-
ly, but also deftly to ensure that its actions 
are commensurate with the threat. This nec-
essarily involves assessing evolving condi-
tions that inform CDC’s determinations. De-
spite promising trends in the spring of 2021, 
the surge of cases spurred by the Delta vari-
ant has confirmed that the fundamental pub-
lic health threat—of the risk of large num-
bers of residential evictions contributing to 
the spread of COVID–19 throughout the 
United States—continues to exist. Without 
this Order, there is every reason to expect 
that evictions will increase dramatically at 
a time when COVID–19 infections in the 
United States are increasing sharply. It is 
imperative that public health authorities act 
quickly to mitigate such an increase of evic-
tions, which could increase the likelihood of 
new spikes in SARS–CoV–2 transmission. 
Such mass evictions and the attendant pub-
lic health consequences would be very dif-
ficult to reverse. 
For all of these reasons, I hereby conclude 
that immediate action is again necessary 
and that notice-and-comment rulemaking 
and a delay in effective date would be im-
practicable and contrary to the public inter-
est. 
Miscellaneous 
Similarly, if this Order qualifies as a rule 
under the APA, the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has determined 
that it would be an economically significant 
regulatory action pursuant to Executive 
Order 12866 and a major rule under Subtitle 
E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforce-
ment Fairness Act of 1996 (the Congressional 
Review Act or CRA), 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Thus, 
this action has been reviewed by OIRA. CDC 
has determined that for the same reasons 
given above, there would be good cause under 
the CRA to make the requirements herein ef-
fective immediately. 5 U.S.C. 808(2). 
If any provision of this Order, or the appli-
cation of any provision to any persons, enti-
ties, or circumstances, shall be held invalid, 
the remainder of the provisions, or the appli-
cation of such provisions to any persons, en-
tities, or circumstances other than those to 
which it is held invalid, shall remain valid 
and in effect. 
This Order shall be enforced by federal au-
thorities and cooperating state and local au-
thorities through the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 
3559, 3571; 42 U.S.C. 243, 268, 271; and 42 CFR 
70.18. However, this Order has no effect on 
the contractual obligations of renters to pay 
rent and shall not preclude charging or col-
lecting fees, penalties, or interest as a result 
of the failure to pay rent or other housing 
payment on a timely basis, under the terms 
of any applicable contract. 
Criminal Penalties 
Under 18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571; 42 U.S.C. 271; and 
42 CFR 70.18, a person violating this Order

August 10, 2021 
states and units of local government are re-
minded that the Federal Government has de-
ployed unprecedented resources to address 
the pandemic, including housing assistance. 
The Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment (HUD), the Department of Agri-
culture, and the Department of the Treasury 
have 
informed 
CDC 
that 
unprecedented 
emergency resources have been appropriated 
through various Federal agencies that assist 
renters and landlords during the pandemic, 
including $46.55 billion to the Treasury 
through the Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan (ARP). 
Furthermore, in 2020 44 states and 310 local 
jurisdictions allocated about $3.9 billion to-
ward emergency rental assistance, largely 
from funds appropriated to HUD from the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity (CARES). These three rounds of federal 
appropriations also provided substantial re-
sources for homeless services, homeowner as-
sistance, and supplemental stimulus and un-
employment benefits that low-income rent-
ers used to pay rent.

Visit

the Rental Assistance Finder that connects 
renters and landlords with the state and

of dollars in federal assistance. Relevant 
agencies have informed CDC that forbear-
ance policies for mortgages backed by the 
federal government provide many landlords, 
especially smaller landlords, with temporary 
relief as new emergency rental assistance 
programs are deployed. 
Treasury, HUD, and USDA grantees and 
program participants play a critical role in 
prioritizing efforts to support this goal. All 
communities should assess what resources 
have already been allocated to prevent evic-
tions and homelessness through temporary 
rental assistance and homelessness preven-
tion, particularly to the most vulnerable 
households. 
Treasury, HUD, and USDA stand at the 
ready to support American communities in 
taking these steps to reduce the spread of 
COVID–19 and maintain economic prosperity.

BILLING CODE 4163–18–P 
f 
NICARAGUA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the accelerating polit-
ical crisis in Nicaragua and the Ortega 
regime’s 
anti-democratic 
efforts 
to 
hold illegitimate elections in Novem-
ber. 
On November 7, Daniel Ortega will 
attempt to deny the Nicaraguan people 
their most basic right: the right to 
choose their country’s leaders in free 
and fair elections. This grave restric-
tion on basic democratic freedoms con-
firms that the Ortega regime is con-
solidating the Western Hemisphere’s 
third dictatorship. In the lead up to 
these elections and in response to unre-
strained assaults against democracy, 
the U.S. Senate unanimously passed 
my legislation entitled the ‘‘Rein-
forcing Nicaragua’s Adherence to Con-
ditions 
for 
Electoral 
Reform 
(RENACER) Act.’’ This bipartisan leg-
islation, taken together with the Biden 
administration’s additional imposition 
of visa restrictions against individuals 
affiliated 
with 
the 
regime, 
dem-
onstrates the United States is firmly 
committed to the restoration of de-
mocracy to Nicaragua. 
The legislation is also consistent 
with our commitments to promote and 
defend democracy in the Americas. As 
the 20th anniversary of the Inter-Amer-
ican Democratic Charter approaches 
next month, we must recognize that a 
growing trend of deeply flawed and 
fraudulent electoral processes jeopard-
izes regional consensus in support of 
free, fair, and transparent elections 
across the Americas. Whether in Nica-
ragua in 2016, Honduras in 2017, Bolivia 
in 2019, Guyana in 2020, or Venezuela in 
2017, 2018, and 2020, democratic elec-
tions are under attack by autocrats 
and populists alike. Regretfully, the 
Ortega regime is taking steps to con-
tinue this trend. 
Today, Daniel Ortega and Rosario 
Murillo hold more than 140 political 
prisoners, including eight opposition 
candidates for President and Vice 
President. These individuals represent 
a broad political spectrum and include 
Arturo Cruz, Fe´lix Maradiaga, Juan 
Sebastia´n 
Chamorro, 
Medardo 
Mairena, and Miguel Mora. Three more 
contenders, 
Berenice 
Quezada, 
Cristiana 
Chamorro, 
and 
Noel 
Vidaurre, are under house arrest. 
On July 27, the regime incarcerated 
the country’s 76-year-old former Min-
ister of Foreign Affairs, Francisco 
Aguirre Sacasa, under bogus charges of 
treason and without regard for his 
health or well-being. The regime is 
holding Sacasa and many others at El 
Chipote detention center: a facility in-
famous for acts of torture and ill-treat-
ment, according to the United Nations 
Human Rights Commission. The re-
gime continues to deny prisoners due 
process, access to family contact, and 
legal counsel. Essentially, many of 
them have been disappeared. 
On Friday, Ortega cancelled the reg-
istration of the last remaining opposi-
tion political party that was positioned 
to participate in the November elec-
tions, Ciudadanos por la Libertad— 
Citizens for Freedom. The regime went 
as far as to strip the head of that party 
of her Nicaraguan citizenship. These 
are not actions that would be tolerated 
in any democratic system in the world; 
these are the actions of a tin-pot dic-
tator. 
The events since June are the cul-
mination of the Ortega regime’s years- 
long process to dismantle democracy in 
Nicaragua. When Nicaraguans took to 
the streets to protest their living con-
ditions in 2018, the regime responded 
with a brutal campaign of violence. 
Over 330 protesters were killed. Today, 
the number of Nicaraguans fleeing the 
country is on the rise, increasing the 
complexity and reach of the challenge. 
The Ortega-Murillo regime’s authori-
tarian power grab poses a direct chal-
lenge to U.S. national security and re-
gional stability. I am proud to have au-
thored the RENACER Act and to lead 
the bipartisan, bicameral effort to send 
a clear message to Daniel Ortega and 
Rosario Murillo: Reverse course now 
and 
the 
international 
community 
stands ready to support the restoration 
of democracy; or continue down the 
current path and face consequences. 
The RENACER Act requires the 
United States, working with our part-
ners in the European Union, Canada, 
and Latin America and the Caribbean, 
to align our diplomatic efforts and 
sanctions tools to push for one goal, 
democratic elections. The bill requires 
increased intelligence reporting on the 
regime’s corruption and its malign 
partnership with Russia. This legisla-
tion will provide for better documenta-
tion of human rights violations and 
guarantee that the regime and its 
enablers are held accountable. 
The law further calls for the Presi-
dent to review Nicaragua’s participa-
tion in the Central America Free Trade 
Agreement—CAFTA. 
The 
United 
States would never sign a free trade 
agreement with Belarus given the au-
thoritarian conditions that exist in the 
country. And the United States should 
not turn a blind eye if one of our free 
trade partners becomes the Belarus of 
Central America. 
In closing, let there be no doubts— 
the United States will continue to sup-
port defenders of democracy in Nica-
ragua, condemn violence and intimida-
tion, and hold accountable the Ortega 
regime and those who support it. If 
Daniel Ortega assumes a fourth con-
secutive term via sham elections, he 
will rule without a shred of legitimacy. 
I urge my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to pass the RENACER 
Act so that we can speak with a single 
voice and make it clear that Daniel 
Ortega’s paranoia of losing at the bal-
lot box is no excuse for his systematic

RECOGNIZING CHESED SHEL EMES 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the first responders 
and 
community 
members 
who 
re-
sponded to the horrific tragedy in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the 
Champlain Towers South condo build-
ing suddenly collapsed in the middle of 
the night. 
Our Jewish Community, particularly 
Orthodox Jews, have been especially af-
fected by this tragedy. We are incred-
ibly grateful to Chesed Shel Emes for 
immediately rushing in to respond fol-
lowing the building collapse. They 
swiftly heeded the call of duty to aid in 
rescue and recovery efforts. In the face 
of tremendous tragedy, they ran into 
danger. They are heroes, and we can 
never thank them enough for their 
bravery and determination in the face 
of this terrible tragedy. 
I would also like to thank Rabbi 
Mark Rosenberg, who serves as direc-
tor of Chesed Shel Emes, and all of 
those who worked selflessly to support 
our Jewish community and provide 
comfort during this time of need. 
Chesed Shel Emes did everything pos-
sible to make sure that search, rescue, 
and recovery efforts upheld Jewish law. 
Chesed Shel Emes worked tirelessly 
and relentlessly, offering resources, 
support, and comfort to the survivors 
and community in Surfside and to 
make sure that the needs of the Jewish 
community were met. This work was 
critical in helping to bring comfort to 
families who lost relatives, giving 
them faith that their loved ones were 
being cared for appropriately and re-
spectfully. 
The pain these families are experi-
encing is unimaginable, and Chesed 
Shel Emes was there every step of the 
way to make ensure the Jewish com-
munity’s beliefs and faith were hon-
ored. They exemplify true loving kind-
ness in both words and actions. 
Chesed Shel Emes provided strength 
amidst tragedy. The community leaned 
on them to advocate for their needs 
and to be their voice. They helped 
every person who turned to them. They 
worked diligently, sensitively, and effi-
ciently to help mourners cope with the 
unknown and provide assistance and 
guidance. Ann and I continue to pray 
for the Surfside community, our Jew-
ish community, the families and loved 
ones of the lost, and all of those who 
worked tirelessly to serve the Surfside 
community.

RECOGNIZING FL–1 URBAN SEARCH 
AND RESCUE TASK FORCE 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021. 
I want to thank the FL–1 Urban 
Search and Rescue Task Force—FL- 
TF1—for responding when the Cham-
plain Towers South condo building in 
Surfside, FL, suddenly collapsed in the 
middle of the night. They swiftly heed-
ed the call of duty to provide search, 
rescue, and recovery efforts following 
the collapse. In the face of tremendous 
tragedy, they ran into danger. They 
are heroes. 
FL-TF1 is one of 28 Federal search 
and rescue task forces overseen by 
FEMA, and its capabilities include 
search and rescue, emergency care, en-
gineering 
expertise, 
and 
logistics. 
When they are not being dispatched to 
countries in crisis, many of them work 
for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue as local 
firefighters. 
FL-TF1 has responded to some of the 
world’s most notable disasters, includ-
ing earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and 
plane crashes, among others. They re-
sponded once before in their own com-
munity, when Hurricane Andrew hit 
south Florida in 1992. Their expertise 
and range of skills has made them in-
valuable in disasters and well-known 
internationally. These brave men and 
women dropped everything to selflessly 
assist in Surfside, a particular chal-
lenge since the tragedy affected their 
own community, and some had missing 
friends or loved ones. 
FL-TF1 worked nonstop and with 
heavy hearts following the collapse in 
Surfside to provide comfort and closure 
for the families. They worked tire-
lessly, even when smoke and heat from 
a fire inside the building’s standing 
portion hampered their efforts. They 
persisted when the temperatures esca-
lated so much that some needed IVs to 
replenish fluids. They continued on 
when Tropical Storm Elsa passed near-
by and dumped torrential rain. They 
left the pile only when they absolutely 
had to. They braved conditions the 
likes of which we could never imagine. 
I also want to thank FL-TF1 dogs for 
their hard work to support search, res-
cue, and recovery efforts. We cannot 
thank these brave men and women of 
the FL-TF1 enough. They are heroes 
who stepped up to serve the commu-
nity in the wake of an unprecedented 
and unimaginable disaster. Not only 
did they help lead the search, rescue, 
and recovery operation, they also pro-
vided endless care and compassion to 
the families of Surfside and did every-
thing they could to bring closure to 
those who lost loved ones. 
We are incredibly grateful to these 
heroes and their families for their 
bravery, self-sacrifice, and determina-
tion in the face of this terrible tragedy. 
Ann and I are praying for the Surfside 
community, our Jewish community, 
the families and loved ones of the lost, 
and all of those who worked tirelessly 
to serve the Surfside community.

RECOGNIZING FLORIDA’S FIRST 
RESPONDERS 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021. 
I want thank all of Florida’s first re-
sponders 
who 
responded 
when 
the 
Champlain Towers South condo build-
ing in Surfside, FL, suddenly collapsed 
in the middle of the night. They imme-
diately answered the call to serve, and 
firefighters, law enforcement officers, 
search and rescue crews, emergency 
medical 
technicians, 
physicians, 
nurses, and others from across the 
State of Florida came rushing in to try 
to save lives. In the face of tremendous 
tragedy, they ran into danger. They 
are heroes. 
Some of these responders lost family 
in the collapse; yet they still answered 
the call. Rescue crews worked tire-
lessly, even when smoke and heat from 
a fire inside the building’s standing 
portion hampered their efforts. They 
persisted when the temperatures esca-
lated so much that some needed IVs to 
replenish fluids. They continued on 
when Tropical Storm Elsa passed near-
by and dumped torrential rain. They 
conducted their searches with enor-
mous care and diligence and closely 
worked with faith leaders to make sure 
that rescue and recovery efforts were 
done with the respect. They left their 
families and faced dangerous and life- 
threatening conditions, and they never 
gave up hope. Their work to recover 
victims gave closure to so many fami-
lies, and I am so proud of these Florida 
heroes. 
We can never thank them and their 
families enough for their bravery, self- 
sacrifice, and determination in the face 
of this terrible tragedy. Ann and I are 
praying for the Surfside community, 
our Jewish community, the families 
and loved ones of the lost, and all of 
those who worked tirelessly to serve 
the Surfside community.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in

I want to thank Florida’s brave law 
enforcement community for responding 
when the Champlain Towers South

In the face of tremendous tragedy, they

Florida’s law enforcement officers 
were on site within minutes of the col-
lapse, and their rapid response saved 
lives. These brave men and women 
worked around the clock to support 
search and rescue efforts and provide 
protection and comfort to the entire 
Surfside community. They worked tire-
lessly, and they never gave up hope. 
I would also like to thank the law en-

all of the families that were impacted 
by this tragedy. The chaplains were a 
source of comfort and ensured that the 
emotional and religious needs of fami-
lies and first responders were met. 
The chaplains were instrumental in 
making sure families were constantly 
updated and that all of their questions 
were answered in both a timely and ef-
ficient manner, to the greatest extent 
possible. They provided as much trans-
parency and kindness as they could 
during this unimaginable tragedy. We 
cannot thank them enough. 
Law enforcement teams worked to 
recover personal property and religious 
artifacts and followed careful collec-
tion protocols. They worked around 
the clock to ensure all recovered per-
sonal property and family heirlooms 
were treated with the utmost respect 
and with great consideration for faith 
traditions when recovering items of re-
ligious significance. So many came to-
gether, as one, in the relentless pursuit 
to save lives. We honor the precious 
lives lost and pay homage to loved ones 
and all those that have suffered im-
mensely. 
Our law enforcement officers put 
their lives on the line every day to 
keep Floridians, and this was no excep-
tion. We can never thank them and 
their families enough for their bravery, 
self-sacrifice, and determination in the 
face of this terrible tragedy. Ann and I 
are praying for the Surfside commu-

RECOGNIZING 
FLORIDA’S 
URBAN 
SEARCH 
AND 
RESCUE 
TASK 
FORCE TEAMS 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021. 
I want to thank all eight of Florida’s 
Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 
teams from Miami-Dade County, the 
city of Miami, Hillsborough County, 
Central Florida, Northeast Florida, 
Southwest Florida, North Florida, and 
North Central Florida for responding 
when the Champlain Towers South 
condo building in Surfside, FL, sud-
denly collapsed in the middle of the 
night. They swiftly heeded the call of 
duty to assist in search, rescue, and re-
covery efforts following the collapse. 
In the face of tremendous tragedy, they 
ran into danger. They are heroes. 
Florida’s Urban Search and Rescue 
Task Force teams are deployed to aid 
communities following a natural or 
manmade disaster, and all eight de-
ployed to Surfside to aid in the search, 
rescue, and recovery efforts. Nearly 370 
urban search and rescue members 
worked on-site, making this the largest 
nonhurricane deployment in Florida’s 
history. 
Some of these responders lost family 
in the collapse; yet they still answered 
the call. Rescue crews worked tire-
lessly, even when smoke and heat from 
a fire inside the building’s standing 
portion hampered their efforts. They 
persisted when the temperatures esca-
lated so much that some needed IVs to 
replenish fluids. They continued on 
when Tropical Storm Elsa passed near-
by and dumped torrential rain. They 
left their families and faced dangerous 
and life-threatening conditions, and 
they never gave up hope. Their work to 
recover victims gave closure to so 
many families, and I am so proud of 
these Florida heroes. 
I also want to thank Florida’s Urban 
Search and Rescue Task Force teams 
dogs for their hard work to support 
search, rescue, and recovery efforts. 
Florida’s Urban Search and Rescue 
Task Force teams are heroes who 
stepped up to serve the community in 
the wake of unprecedented and un-
imaginable disaster. Not only did they 
help lead the search, rescue, and recov-
ery operation, they provided endless 
care and compassion to the families of 
Surfside and did everything they could 
to bring closure to those who lost loved 
ones. 
We can never thank them and their fami-
lies enough for their bravery, self-sacrifice, 
and determination in the face of this terrible 
tragedy. Ann and I are praying for the 
Surfside community, our Jewish community, 
the families and loved ones of the lost, and 
all of those who worked tirelessly to serve 
the Surfside community.

RECOGNIZING HATZALAH OF 
SOUTH FLORIDA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the first responders 
and 
community 
members 
who 
re-
sponded to the horrific tragedy in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the 
Champlain Towers South condo build-
ing suddenly collapsed in the middle of 
the night. 
Our Jewish Community, particularly 
Orthodox Jews, have been especially af-
fected by this tragedy. Hatzalah is a 
volunteer emergency medical service 
organization serving Jewish commu-
nities around the world. We are incred-
ibly grateful to Hatzalah of South 
Florida for immediately rushing in to 
try to save lives following the building 
collapse. They swiftly heeded the call 
of duty to aid in rescue and recovery 
efforts. In the face of tremendous trag-
edy, they ran into danger. They are he-
roes, and we can never thank them 
enough for their bravery and deter-
mination in the face of this terrible 
tragedy. 
Hatzalah of South Florida had a 
steady presence in Surfside, helping 
with the search, rescue, and recovery 
operation. They offered resources, sup-
port, and comfort to the survivors, 
families of the victims, and the entire 
community in Surfside. They provided 
medical services to evacuees, families 
of missing persons, and personnel in-
volved in the search and rescue oper-
ations. They worked tirelessly and re-
lentlessly to make sure that the needs 
of the community were met. Ann and I 
continue to pray for the Surfside com-
munity, our Jewish community, the 
families and loved ones of the lost and 
all of those who worked tirelessly to 
serve the Surfside community.

RECOGNIZING ISRAEL’S AID 
DELEGATION 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the horrific tragedy in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the 
Champlain Towers South condo build-
ing suddenly collapsed in the middle of 
the night. 
Our Jewish Community, particularly 
Orthodox Jews, have been especially af-
fected by this tragedy, and imme-
diately following the collapse, Israel 
mobilized resources and personnel to 
help in the response. We are incredibly 
grateful to Israeli Prime Minister 
Naftali Bennett for deploying the joint 
Israel Defense Forces—IDF—and Min-
istry of Foreign Affairs delegation to 
Surfside following the collapse. I want 
to thank commander of IDF’s National 
Rescue Unit in the Home Front Com-
mand, Colonel Golan Vach, for leading 
the search and rescue delegation and 
Israeli 
Diaspora 
Affairs 
Minister, 
Nachman Shai, who helped to make 
sure the needs of the Surfside commu-
nity were addressed. I am eternally 
grateful for their hard work and quick 
response to this terrible tragedy. 
I also want to thank Israel’s Consul 
General, Maor Elbaz-Starinsky, and his 
team, who were on site working tire-
lessly to address the needs of the com-
munity and who worked alongside first 
responders and rescue crews to respond 
to the collapse. 
Israel Defense Forces Home Front 
Command operates search and rescue 
missions in Israel and around the 
world, aiding in rescue and recovery ef-
forts for disasters. Using building in-
formation modeling tools and tech-
nologies and careful measurements 
taken on site, the Home Front Com-
mand was able to generate 3D digital 
models of the building before and after 
its collapse. This, combined with infor-
mation gathered from surviving family 
members and friends, produced highly 
accurate 
information 
to 
help 
the 
search, rescue, and recovery efforts. 
Their efforts gave search teams from 
across the United States and around 
the world the most accurate and up-to-

target their search efforts. 
Israel responds immediately to emer-
gencies around the world, and our grat-
itude is immense. Israel is a partner in 
every sense of the word. Their presence 
was greatly appreciated by the people 
of Surfside, the State of Florida, and 
the entire Nation. The Israeli rescue 
team demonstrated once again the 
kindness and strength that Israel pro-
vides. They swiftly heeded the call of

mendous tragedy, they ran into danger. 
They are heroes. They worked tire-
lessly and relentlessly to make sure 
that the needs of the community were 
met. We can never thank them enough 
for their bravery and determination. 
The Israeli delegation succeeded in 
alleviating suffering and demonstrated 
what the Jewish state can mean to peo-
ple thousands of miles away during the 
worst moment of their lives. The trag-
edy in Surfside shows the strength of 
the connection between American Jews 
and the Jewish state and that Israel is 
a great ally and friend to the United 
States. Ann and I continue to pray for 
the Surfside community, our Jewish 
community, the families and loved 
ones of the lost, and all of those who 
worked tirelessly to serve the Surfside

RECOGNIZING MEXICO’S GO TEAM 
OF CADENA INTERNATIONAL 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the first responders 
who responded to horrific tragedy in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the 
Champlain Towers South condo build-
ing suddenly collapsed in the middle of 
the night. 
We are incredibly grateful to Mexico 
for sending its search and rescue spe-
cialists to aid in the response, includ-
ing the ‘‘Go Team’’ of Cadena Inter-
national, a Jewish nonprofit which has 
responded to more than 1,000 natural 
disasters and humanitarian crises since 
2005. The Mexico-based team worked 
tirelessly in Surfside with search, res-
cue, and recovery efforts. We cannot 
thank them enough for their willing-
ness to risk their lives for others in 
this incredibly dangerous work. They 
are heroes. Their commitment and 
willingness to serve will never be for-
gotten. 
In the face of tremendous loss, the 
Cadena International team heeded the 
call to action, and for that, we will be 
eternally grateful. We are incredibly 
grateful to these heroes and their fami-
lies for their bravery and determina-
tion in the face of this terrible tragedy. 
Ann and I continue to pray for the 
Surfside community, our Jewish com-
munity, the families and loved ones of 
the lost, and all of those who worked 
tirelessly to serve the Surfside commu-
nity.

RECOGNIZING 
OUT-OF-STATE 
URBAN 
SEARCH 
AND 
RESCUE 
TASK FORCES 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021. 
I want to thank the out-of-State 
Urban Search and Rescue—USAR— 
teams from Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and emer-
gency specialists from California for 
responding when the Champlain Tow-
ers South condo building in Surfside, 
FL, suddenly collapsed in the middle of 
the night. They swiftly heeded the call 
of duty to provide search, rescue, and 
recovery efforts following the collapse. 
In the face of tremendous tragedy, they 
ran into danger. They are heroes. 
More than 440 USAR members from 
New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia, Pennsyl-
vania, and Indiana were on the ground 
in Surfside to help supplement the 
search and rescue efforts. Florida is 
grateful for the outpouring of support 
from our fellow Americans. We are 
grateful for the task force teams that 
came from all over the country, trav-
eling thousands of miles to work along-
side local, State, Federal, and inter-
national counterparts in the relentless 
search for survivors. Their presence 
and efforts brought great comfort to 
the community and helped provide clo-
sure to the families of the victims. 
Rescue crews worked tirelessly fol-
lowing the collapse, even when smoke 
and heat from a fire inside the build-
ing’s standing portion hampered their 
efforts. They persisted when the tem-
peratures escalated so much that some 
needed IVs to replenish fluids. They 
continued on when Tropical Storm 
Elsa passed nearby and dumped tor-
rential rain. They left the pile only 
when they absolutely had to. They left 
their families back home and put it all 
on the line for the Surfside commu-
nity. They braved conditions that the 
likes of us couldn’t ever imagine. 
I also want to thank the search and 
rescue dogs for their hard work to sup-
port search, rescue and recovery ef-
forts. We cannot thank these brave 
men, women, and canine units enough. 
They are heroes who stepped up to 
serve the community in the wake of 
unprecedented and unimaginable dis-
aster. Not only did they help lead the 
search, rescue, and recovery operation, 
they provided endless care and compas-
sion to the families of Surfside and did 
everything they could to bring closure 
to those who lost loved ones. 
We are incredibly grateful to these 
heroes and their families for their 
bravery, self-sacrifice, and determina-
tion in the face of this terrible tragedy. 
Ann and I are praying for the Surfside 
community, our Jewish community, 
the families and loved ones of the lost, 
and all of those who worked tirelessly 
to serve the Surfside community.

RECOGNIZING THE MIAMI-DADE 
FIRE RESCUE 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021. 
I want to thank Miami-Dade Fire 
Rescue for swiftly heeding the call of 
duty to provide search, rescue, and re-
covery efforts following the collapse. 
In the face of tremendous tragedy, they 
ran into danger. They are heroes. 
Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded 
within minutes of the collapse, and 
their rapid response saved lives. They 
worked around the clock, and they 
were tireless in their pursuit to try and 
find survivors. These first responders 
braved extremely dangerous conditions 
to find those missing and to bring com-
fort and closure to the families of the 
victims. 
Many of these responders had friends 
or family lost in the collapse; yet they 
still answered the call. Miami-Dade 
Fire Rescue never quit, even when 
smoke and heat from a fire inside the 
building’s standing portion hampered 
their efforts. They persisted when the 
temperatures escalated so much that 
some needed IVs to replenish fluids. 
They 
continued 
on 
when 
Tropical 
Storm Elsa passed nearby and dumped 
torrential rain. They left their families 
and faced dangerous and life-threat-
ening conditions, and they never gave 
up hope. Their work to recover victims 
gave closure to so many families, and I 
am so proud of these Florida heroes. 
Not only did they help lead the 
search, rescue, and recovery operation, 
they also provided endless care and 
compassion to the families of Surfside 
and did everything they could to bring 
closure to those who lost loved ones. 
I also want to thank the search and 
rescue dogs that helped this mission, 
along with the therapy dogs from 
Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, who worked 
in shifts to provide relief and comfort 
to the victims and to their loved ones. 
We can never thank them and their 
families enough for their bravery, self- 
sacrifice, and determination in the face 
of this terrible tragedy. Ann and I are 
praying for the Surfside community, 
our Jewish community, the families 
and loved ones of the lost, and all of 
those who worked tirelessly to serve 
the Surfside community.

POLICE DEPARTMENT 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded to the building collapse in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021. 
I want to thank the Miami-Dade Po-
lice Department—MDPD—for respond-
ing when the Champlain Towers South 
condo building in Surfside, FL, sud-
denly collapsed in the middle of the 
night. In the face of tremendous trag-
edy, they ran into danger. They are he-
roes. 
The MDPD responded within minutes 
of the collapse and their rapid response 
saved lives. These brave men and 
women worked around the clock to 
support search and rescue efforts and 
provide protection and comfort to the 
entire 
Surfside 
community. 
They 
worked tirelessly, and they never gave 
up hope.

forts to lead the investigation into the

debris, searching for remains and per-
sonal items to bring closure to fami-
lies. They worked closely with faith 
leaders to ensure search and rescue ef-
forts were done with respect. 
I also would like to personally thank 
MDPD Director Alfredo Ramirez III, 
Chief Rosanna Cordero-Stutz, Officer 
Deborah Valdes, as well as every law 
enforcement officer, victim advocate, 
and individual at the MDPD for heed-
ing the tremendous call of duty to as-
sist with missing persons reports and 
identification and notification proc-
essing for the victims and their fami-
lies. This was an extremely difficult 
task, and they worked around the 
clock to bring order, comfort, and 
often closure to the families. Our 
hearts go out to all of those that lost 
loved ones. 
I would also like to thank the MDPD 
chaplains who did everything they 
could to support the needs of those re-
sponding to the collapse and to all of 
the families that were impacted by this 
tragedy. The chaplains were a source of 
comfort and ensured that the emo-
tional and religious needs of the fami-
lies and first responders were met. 
The MDPD also offered countless re-
sources to the community, ensuring 
that short-term and long-term needs 
were met, including counseling and 
comfort, shelter, and assistance to all 
who needed it. They were instrumental 
in making sure that families were con-
stantly updated and that all of their 
questions were answered in a timely 
and efficient manner, to the greatest 
extent possible. They provided as much 
transparency and kindness as they 
could during this unimaginable trag-
edy. 
The MDPD teams worked to recover 
personal property and religious arti-
facts and followed careful collection 
protocols. They worked around the 
clock to ensure all recovered personal 
property and family heirlooms were 
treated with the utmost respect and 
with great consideration for faith tra-
ditions when recovering items of reli-
gious significance. So many came to-
gether, as one, in the relentless pursuit 
to save lives. We honor the precious 
lives lost and pay homage to loved ones 
and all those that have suffered im-
mensely. 
Our law enforcement officers put 
their lives on the line every day to 
keep Floridians safe, and this was no 
exception. We can never thank them 
enough for their bravery, self-sacrifice, 
and determination in the face of this 
terrible tragedy. Ann and I are praying 
for the Surfside community, our Jew-
ish community, the families and loved 
ones of the lost, and all of those who 
worked tirelessly to serve the Surfside 
community.

RECOGNIZING THE SHUL OF BAL 
HARBOUR 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the selfless serv-
ice of the individuals who responded to 
horrific tragedy in Surfside, FL, on 
June 24, 2021, when the Champlain Tow-
ers South condo building suddenly col-
lapsed in the middle of the night. 
Our Jewish Community, particularly 
Orthodox Jews, have been especially af-
fected by this tragedy. We are incred-
ibly grateful for the service and com-
passionate 
care 
of 
Rabbi 
Sholom 
Lipskar, 
Rebbetzin 
Chani 
Lipskar, 
Rabbi Schneur Lipskar, community 
leaders, The Shul members, volunteers, 
and all of those who worked selflessly 
to support our Jewish community and 
provided comfort during this time of 
need. 
In the days following the Surfside 
tragedy, the world watched as our Jew-
ish community united to assist and 
console friends, neighbors, and the 
countless families and individuals af-
fected by the collapse. The outpouring 
of love and support was absolutely in-
credible, even amidst such tragedy. 
Hundreds gathered every day at The 
Shul of Bal Harbour to pray that sur-
vivors would be found. 
The Surfside Jewish community has 
always held service and generosity to 
others in high regard and practiced giv-
ing daily. When the tragic collapse 
took place, the community quickly 
sprang into action. The Shul became a 
resource center for survivors, family 
members of victims, as well as first re-
sponders and rescue teams. 
Hundreds were hosted by The Shul 
for Shabbat meals. Folding tables set 
up in The Shul were piled high with 
clothing, toys, food, electronics, and 
household goods for those who lost ev-
erything in the collapse. An emergency 
fund set up by The Shul raised funds to 
be disbursed directly to the victims 
and families. The Surfside Jewish com-
munity was a vital lifeline of support 
and comfort in the midst of unimagi-
nable pain and tragedy. 
There were numerous members of the 
synagogue that were victims of this 
terrible tragedy, and our hearts are 
heavy for them. We pray for those who 
were unexpectedly lost. They had great 
faith and served their synagogue faith-
fully. They will be missed greatly. Let 
us pray that their memory be a bless-
ing. Ann and I continue to pray for the 
Surfside community, our Jewish com-
munity, the families and loved ones of 
the lost, and all of those who worked 
tirelessly to serve the Surfside commu-
nity.

RECOGNIZING UNITED HATZALAH 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to honor the bravery and 
selfless service of the individuals who 
responded 
to 
horrific 
tragedy 
in 
Surfside, FL, on June 24, 2021, when the 
Champlain Towers South condo build-
ing suddenly collapsed in the middle of 
the night. 
Our Jewish Community, particularly 
Orthodox Jews, have been especially af-
fected by this tragedy. We are incred-
ibly grateful to United Hatzalah for 
rushing in to respond following the 
building collapse. They swiftly heeded 
the call of duty to help provide emer-
gency medical services. In the face of 
tremendous tragedy, they ran into dan-
ger. They are heroes, and we can never 
thank them enough for their bravery 
and determination in the face of this 
terrible tragedy. 
International rescue crews and emer-
gency 
support 
organizations 
from 
Israel responded to the site to aid in 
the search, rescue, and recovery ef-
forts. United Hatzalah is an Israeli vol-
unteer-based emergency medical serv-
ices organization based in Jerusalem. 
Its mission is to provide immediate 
medical intervention during the crit-
ical window between the onset of an 
emergency and the arrival of tradi-
tional ambulance assistance. It is one 
of many Hatzalah organizations in var-
ious parts of the world. 
United Hatzalah of Israel sent a team 
to Surfside to assist the community 
and provide psychological support and 
stabilization to all those affected by 
the tragedy. Ann and I continue to 
pray for the Surfside community, our 
Jewish community, the families and 
loved ones of the lost, and all of those 
who worked tirelessly to serve the 
Surfside community.

They are heroes. 
International rescue crews and emer-
gency

organizations 
from 
Israel responded to the site to aid in 
the search, rescue, and recovery ef-

law. ZAKA sent rescue workers to 
Surfside to provide critical support and 
assist with identifications and burial 
preparation. They worked tirelessly 
and relentlessly to make sure that the 
needs of the community were met. 
ZAKA offered resources, support, and 
comfort to the survivors and commu-

dous loss, ZAKA heeded the call to ac-

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TYLER BLANCHETTE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Tyler Blanchette 
of Hudson as August’s Granite Stater 
of the Month. Tyler has helped run an 
annual fundraiser outside his family’s 
home in the middle of the winter to 
raise money for the Alzheimer’s Asso-
ciation and has continued this effort 
even as he faces his own brain cancer 
diagnosis. 
The yearly fundraiser began on a 
chilly day in the winter of 2009 when 
Tyler’s older brother Brandon decided 
to sell hot chocolate on his front lawn 
to raise money to support Alzheimer’s 
research. The inspiration behind the 
fundraiser stemmed from their great- 
grandfather, nicknamed ‘‘Big Papa,’’ 
who was diagnosed with the disease 
and died from it when Brandon and 
Tyler were young. 
Once Brandon grew older and moved 
out of the Blanchette’s home, Tyler ea-
gerly took over running the event— 
making the signs, brewing the hot 
chocolate, and getting the word out to 
the community. 
The fundraiser, named Big Papa’s 
Cocoa Stand in honor of Tyler’s great- 
grandfather, sells hot chocolate for $1 
to friends, neighbors, and community 
members who come by for a hot drink 
and a good cause. All of the sales go to 
the 
Massachusetts/New 
Hampshire 
chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, 
and since its founding, Tyler’s family 
has raised approximately $30,000 for the 
organization. 
Four years ago, Tyler was diagnosed 
with brain cancer, a diagnosis he is liv-
ing with today. Yet he was determined 
to continue helping others by running 
the cocoa stand. Tyler never let his di-
agnosis stand in the way of his goal to 
raise money for the organization that 
is working to find a cure for the disease 
that took his great-grandfather’s life. 
Despite incredible adversity, Tyler 
has exemplified the spirit of the Gran-
ite State by forging on and serving his 
community 
no 
matter 
the 
cir-
cumstances. It is a mark of Tyler’s 
compassion and grit that he continues 
to operate this fundraiser as he battles 
his own health challenges. I am proud 
to honor Tyler for his efforts and will 
pray for him and his family during this 
difficult time.∑

RECOGNIZING BAXTER’S COFFEE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize a family-owned small business 
and beloved staple, Baxter’s Coffee of 
Somerset, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
In 2001, Terri Tuttle opened Baxter’s 
Coffee in Somerset, KY. After running 
a successful ice cream store, Terri de-
cided to pursue a different business 
venture. She noticed an opportunity to 
fill a gap in the Somerset market since 
there were no coffee shops in town. As 
Terri brainstormed business names, she 
was inspired by her family’s dog, Bax-
ter. When Baxter’s Coffee first opened 
in 2001, it was an instant hit. Along 
with delicious coffee, Terri and her 
team provided family-friendly service 
and a welcoming atmosphere. To meet 
growing demand, the original Baxter’s 
Coffee shop soon moved to a new loca-
tion on Ogden Street and opened a sec-
ond location in 2005. 
In 2021, Baxter’s Coffee continues 
serving some of the best coffee in Pu-
laski County. As the business grew, so 
did the Tuttle family’s involvement. 
Today, Terri’s children, Jay, Lauren, 
and Ann, are actively involved in every 
facet of the business, from coffee roast-
ing, to marketing, and bookkeeping. 
They continue welcoming customers 
from all over Kentucky and have ex-
panded to four locations in Somerset, 
including a kiosk at Lake Cumberland 
Regional Hospital. Notably, since 2009, 
Baxter’s Coffee has roasted its own cof-
fee. 
Their 
newest 
location, 
which 
opened in 2016, includes a drive-thru, as 
well as a roasting and warehouse facil-
ity. Baxter’s Coffee proudly offers its 
signature blends at all four locations 
and also sells its coffee wholesale and 
online. Baxter’s Coffee also features 
baked goods and treats from local 
small businesses. 
Like many small business owners, 
Terri is actively involved in her com-
munity. Baxter’s Coffee is a member of 
the Somerset Pulaski Chamber of Com-
merce and regularly partners with 
them to hire local community mem-
bers. For years, Baxter’s Coffee has 
contributed to a wide range of local 
philanthropic organizations, including 
God’s Food Pantry, and supported 
events such as charity golf tour-
naments, walks, and runs. They regu-
larly support local school district 
events and organizations, including 
PTA fundraisers. To demonstrate ap-
preciation for first responders, Baxter’s 
Coffee provides free coffee to all on- 
duty police officers. 
Baxter’s Coffee is a remarkable ex-
ample of the critical role small busi-
nesses play in uplifting and building 
community. Family-owned small busi-
nesses like Baxter’s Coffee form the 
heart of towns across Kentucky, regu-
larly stepping up to support their com-
munities. Congratulations to Terri and 
the entire team at Baxter’s Coffee. I 
wish them the best of luck and look 
forward to watching their continued 
growth and success in Kentucky.∑ 
RECOGNIZING THE FLORIDA CHAP-
TER OF THE ALS ASSOCIATION 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
is a progressive neurodegenerative dis-
ease that affects nerve cells in the 
brain and the spinal cord. ALS causes 
progressive 
degeneration 
of 
these 
motor neurons leading to their death. 
There is no cure for ALS, and although 
the mean survival time with ALS is 3 
to 5 years, some people live 5, 10, or 
more years. While ALS is considered a 
‘‘rare’’ disease, the reality is that 
500,000 people alive today will eventu-
ally die from the disease. 
I have seen how devastating and 
heartbreaking an ALS diagnosis is for 
families. Over time, this disease robs 
people of the ability to walk, talk, 
move, and breathe. In most cases, 
members of a patient’s family eventu-
ally need to become full-time care-
givers to help navigate all the chal-
lenges that ALS creates. 
I want to commend the Florida chap-
ter of the ALS Association for their 
work to fight ALS on all fronts and 
support the 1,300 families in Florida 
who are battling this disease each day. 
They work closely with a network of 10 
ALS multidisciplinary clinics in the 
State to ensure those families have ac-
cess to critical support as they fight 
this disease. Additionally, they provide 
a variety of programs and services that 
are designed to help ease the burden of 
ALS. 
I want to thank the ALS staff and 
their many volunteers for their service 
to the community. I want to specifi-
cally recognize three individuals who 
are battling ALS. 
John Robinson is a recently retired, 
32-year veteran of the U.S. Army. Most 
recently, he served as the chief warrant 
officer of the Army’s field artillery 
branch. In the same way that he served 
in the military to protect our freedom 
here at home, he serves in the ALS 
community to help those coming along 
behind him with ALS. Just as John 
protected our freedom, he is a staunch 
protector of hope in the ALS commu-
nity. John wants the next generation 
of those diagnosed with this dreadful 
disease to have better care, more effec-
tive treatments, and the possibility of 
improved prognosis and quality of life. 
Troy Fields is a husband and father 
of four living with ALS in Tampa, FL. 
Prior to his diagnosis, Troy worked at 
a global financial technology company 
for 26 years. Troy believes acceptance 
never means that having ALS is okay. 
It simply means one is willing to deal 
with it. Whether he is talking about 
advocacy with the ALS community and 
encouraging others to take action or 
talking one on one with a chapter 
board member about outlining stra-
tegic goals, Troy’s strategy for coping 
is to live in the moment, accept what 
he cannot control, and work to change 
what he can. 
Diane Mummaw is from Deltona, FL, 
and is the mother of two children and

owner. Despite battling ALS, she con-
siders herself lucky because she is one 
of the precious few who has survived 
more than 5 years since her diagnosis. 
ALS affected her ability to function 
but it did not take away her ability to 
work for improvement. As an entre-
preneur, she took on living with ALS 
with the very same grit, fortitude, and 
determination that she used to build 
and grow her business. 
These three Floridians show so much 
strength and hope in the face of adver-
sity, and I thank them for their many 
contributions to the ALS community 
and to our State. 
Last year, Congress passed the ALS 
Disability Insurance Act to eliminate 
the 5-month waiting period for Social 
Security Disability Insurance benefits 
for disabled workers with ALS. I was 
proud to support this important legis-
lation and will keep working to sup-
port Floridians with ALS and help to 
fight 
this 
horrible 
disease 
on 
all 
fronts.∑

TRIBUTE TO BISHOP DOUGLAS 
MILES 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to a beloved pastor, 
an inspirational leader, and a lion for 
justice: 
Bishop 
Douglas 
Miles. 
He 
passed away on August 3 of this year at 
the age of 72, and I would like to take 
this time to honor his life and his leg-
acy. 
Bishop Miles was a lifelong Mary-
lander, born in Baltimore City and 
raised in Lafayette Courts in East Bal-
timore. By the time he entered Johns 
Hopkins 
University 
as 
an 
under-
graduate, he had determined that he 
would become a doctor and set out to 
earn his medical degree. He wanted to 
serve the weak and heal the sick. It 
was an auspicious career choice be-
cause, while he eventually switched 
majors and earned his degree in hu-
manistic studies, Bishop Miles would 
commit five decades of his life to serv-
ing and to healing communities across 
Baltimore. 
He first embarked on that mission by 
helping to found the organization Bal-
timoreans United in Leadership Devel-
opment, or BUILD, where he served as 
cochair. In this role, Bishop Miles 
fought to build a better and stronger 
Baltimore for all by expanding job op-
portunities, 
supporting 
schools, 
strengthening neighborhoods, and im-
proving housing. His efforts to force 
real action on housing at BUILD re-
sulted in the construction of at least 
767 affordable homes throughout the 
city over a 14-year span, and his leader-
ship was pivotal in revitalizing the Oli-
ver neighborhood in East Baltimore 
after a tragic fire that claimed seven 
lives. 
When he wasn’t pushing for progress 
with BUILD and the many other orga-
nizations he helped lead, including the 
Industrial Areas Foundation, the Col-
lege Bound Foundation, and the Johns 
Hopkins BLocal initiative, he was run-
ning his beloved Koinonia Baptist 
Church, which he founded in 1992. As 
pastor, he used his gift for oratory and 
his deep religious faith to guide his 
congregation with spirit and grace. He 
was a titanic force, who could com-
mand an audience with equal vigor at 
the pulpit, the podium, and the policy 
table. 
But regardless of whether he was de-
livering a sermon on the scriptures or 
leading a rally for social change, 
Bishop Miles always spoke his mind 
and lived his values fully. Just a few 
weeks ago, I met with him and a group 
of advocates about how to close the ra-
cial homeownership gap in this country 
and help every American achieve their 
full potential. He dedicated his life to 
holding the powerful to account and 
raising the voices of those who had too 
often been left out and left behind. I 
was honored to work with him over the 
years to strengthen our healthcare sys-
tem, expand access to affordable hous-
ing, and prevent teen tobacco use, and 
I am forever grateful for his leadership 
on a host of other issues from gun vio-
lence to education to public safety to 
immigration. His dedication to the 
causes he held dear left an indelible 
mark on our communities, and you can 
find proof of his lifelong service in the 
countless lives he changed for the bet-
ter throughout Baltimore City. 
He is gone too soon, but his legacy 
and his spirit live on in all the Mary-
landers he helped shape and inspire, 
both as a faith leader and as an advo-
cate for justice. Bishop Miles taught 
all of us what it means to live a life 
dedicated to serving your community, 
and it is a lesson we must never forget. 
In living, he inspired a generation to 
fight harder for those in need. In pass-
ing, his memory will continue to push 
future generations to serve and to heal, 
as he did.∑

drew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the 20

HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 54 
Whereas, 
Harriet 
Tubman 
was

Araminta ‘‘Minty’’ Ross in the early 1820s in

County, 
Maryland; 
she 
was 
enslaved at a young age and began working 
the field by harvesting flax at age 13; and 
Whereas, Harriet Tubman escaped when 
she was around 27 years old; she walked the 
nearly 90 miles to Philadelphia, where she 
took jobs as a domestic and cook and spent 
summers working in Cape May, New Jersey; 
and 
Whereas, Harriet Tubman returned to 
Maryland approximately 13 times to rescue 
as many as 70 enslaved people through the 
Underground Railroad, which was a network 
of escape routes and safe houses organized by 
Black and white abolitionists; she claimed 
she never lost a passenger; she gave instruc-
tions to 70 others who found their own way 
to freedom; and 
Whereas, If Harriet Tubman had been 
caught, she would have faced physical pun-
ishment and been sold back into slavery in 
the Deep South due to the 1850 Fugitive 
Slave Law; and 
Whereas, During the Civil War, Harriet 
Tubman worked for the Union Army as a 
scout, spy, guerrilla soldier, and nurse; this

became involved in the campaign for wom-
en’s suffrage along with Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; in 1859, she 
purchased a home in Auburn, New York and 
established it as a home for the elderly; and 
Whereas, Harriet Tubman died in 1913 and 
was buried with military honors at Fort Hill 
Cemetery; and 
Whereas, In 2014, President Barack Obama 
launched the effort to get Harriet Tubman 
on the $20 bill after receiving a letter from a 
girl 
from 
Massachusetts 
saying 
women 
should appear on currency; and 
Whereas, In April of 2016, President Obama 
announced that Harriet Tubman would be re-
placing President Andrew Jackson on the $20 
and that Jackson would be moved into a 
scene of the White House on the reverse side; 
and 
Whereas, For years, critics have called for 
Jackson to be removed from the $20 bill be-
cause of his legacy of supporting the institu-
tion of slavery, having owned 95 enslaved 
people months before he became president 
and bringing 14 of them to the White House, 
and for his role in the forced, violent trans-
fer of tens of thousands of Native Americans 
from the South on what became known as 
the Trail of Tears; and 
Whereas, The new design was initially 
scheduled for 2020 but stalled under Presi-
dent Trump who called the move ‘‘pure polit-
ical correctness’’ and said that Jackson ‘‘had 
a great history’’; and 
Whereas, No women or people of color have 
ever been pictured on a denomination of cur-
rency still in circulation; therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the House of Representatives 
of the One Hundred Second General Assem-
bly of the State of Illinois, that we urge the 
federal government to replace Andrew Jack-
son with Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution be sent to President Joe Biden, Vice 
President Kamala Harris, the Majority Lead-
er and Minority Leader of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
and all members of the Illinois Congressional 
delegation. 
POM–71. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Idaho opposing 
the removal or breaching of the dams on the 
Columbia-Snake River System and its tribu-
taries; to the Committee on Environment 
and Public Works. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 103 
Whereas, the Idaho Legislature recognizes 
the Columbia-Snake River System as part of 
the United States Marine Highway network; 
and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem and its tributaries, collectively and in 
its entirety, are a multiuse system providing 
navigation, transportation, fish and wildlife 
habitat, recreation, hydropower generation, 
flood control, and irrigation to the citizens 
and industry of the Pacific Northwest; and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem and its tributaries provide a vital con-
tribution to the well-being of the State of 
Idaho and to the quality of life of its citi-
zens, being among the most operationally 
important and cost-effective projects in the 
Federal Columbia River Power System; and 
Whereas, a balanced river system produces 
economic benefits like jobs, trade, and re-
newable electricity while caring for environ-
mental values through good management 
practices and reinvestment in our natural re-
sources; and 
Whereas, no amount of money can replace 
the lifestyle and economies of the commu-
nities that depend upon the Columbia-Snake 
River System’s hydropower, navigation, irri-
gation, flood risk management, recreation, 
and municipal and industrial water supply 
benefits; and 
Whereas, the State of Idaho reasserts and 
confirms sovereign control over all water re-
sources within the state; and 
Whereas, the decline of anadromous fish is 
due to many factors, including increased pre-
dation, unfavorable ocean conditions, and 
harvest levels; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6278 
August 10, 2021 
Whereas, breaching the four lower Snake 
River dams is an idealistic, single variable 
model to Pacific salmon recovery that flies 
in the face of reality for salmon, is illogical 
from an environmental perspective, hurts in-
dustry and communities, puts politics over 
science and local jobs, and may neither re-
store Idaho salmon nor prevent their extinc-
tion; and 
Whereas, only four of the thirteen Endan-
gered Species Act-listed salmon runs swim 
past the lower Snake River darns, and they 
do so with over 95% survival at each of the 
dams; and 
Whereas, breaching the four lower Snake 
River dams would be a drastic measure that 
would forever alter our way of life in the Pa-
cific Northwest; and 
Whereas, breaching the lower Snake River 
dams is an outdated argument that is not 
supported by current dam passage survival 
studies of juvenile Pacific salmon; and 
Whereas, in 2008, 2014, and 2020 the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion produced biological opinions that stated 
breaching the four lower Snake River dams 
was not necessary action for salmon recov-
ery; and 
Whereas, the governor of Idaho commis-
sioned the Governor’s Salmon Workgroup, a 
diverse group of stakeholders that worked 
for 18 months to study the issue of salmon 
recovery, representing for the first time 
broad interests working collaboratively to 
help shape the state’s salmon and steelhead 
policy; and 
Whereas, that workgroup developed many 
practical recommendations to address the 
issue of improved river systems and habitat 
conditions for healthy salmon populations, 
specifically excluding any recommendations 
for removing dams; and 
Whereas, due to the efforts of the state, 
the Nez Perce Tribe, and Idaho water users 
in entering into the 2004 Snake River Water 
Rights Agreement, up to 487,000 acre-feet of 
Idaho’s water is used for flow augmentation 
for salmon and steelhead in the lower Snake 
and Columbia rivers, with water being re-
leased through willing-buyer, willing-seller 
arrangements. In return for flow augmenta-
tion, the 2004 agreement provides protections 
to Idaho water users in the form of a 30-year 
biological opinion; and 
Whereas, agricultural and industrial appli-
cations of water have a legal priority within 
the state; and 
Whereas, the Port of Lewiston, Idaho’s 
only seaport, is part of the collective Colum-
bia-Snake River System and is an asset to 
the State of Idaho and an asset to the Inland 
Northwest region, providing global competi-
tiveness and connectivity for regional prod-
ucts, economic development investment, and 
multimodal transportation; and 
Whereas, the State of Idaho supports the 
Port of Lewiston activities and believes that 
reservoir drawdowns or removal of the dams 
on the lower Snake and Columbia rivers 
would inflict on the citizenry a loss of recre-
ation, an increase in electric rates, a loss of 
navigation, a risk of floods, economic hard-
ship, and an impaired quality of life; and 
Whereas, cruise boat traffic to the Port of 
Lewiston has steadily increased over the last 
10 years and is projected to increase from 
19,000 passengers in 2019 to over 33,000 pas-
sengers in 2022, a growth of 76%, bringing 
much financial growth to the entire Snake 
River area; and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem acts as a top wheat export gateway in 
the United States, with approximately 10% 
of all United States wheat exports barged 
through the four dams on the Snake River 
and about 50% of all Idaho-grown wheat 
barged from Lewiston to Portland and then 
onto export markets around the world; and 
Whereas, barging on the Columbia and 
Snake rivers is the safest, most fuel-efficient 
means of transporting cargoes in the North-
west, being 40% more fuel-efficient than 
freight trains and 270% more fuel-efficient 
than semitrucks; and 
Whereas, without the ability to barge 
goods down the river, diesel fuel consump-
tion would increase by nearly 5 million gal-
lons per year as barges would be replaced by 
less efficient truck-to-rail shipments, result-
ing in increases in carbon dioxide and other 
harmful emissions by over 1.2 million tons 
per year; and 
Whereas, the Columbia-Snake River Sys-
tem is also highly valued on the west coast 
for forest product exports and mineral ex-
ports, is second in the nation for soy exports, 
and is a major gateway for auto imports and 
exports. Each year, around 250,000 tons of 
wood chips are barged from the Lower Gran-
ite Pool to be turned into pulp for paper pro-
duction at mills on the lower Columbia 
River; and 
Whereas, hydroelectric power is one of the 
best energy sources we have, with clean, reli-
able, renewable baseload generation that is 
more valuable than ever as the four lower 
Snake River dams produce thousands of 
megawatts 
of 
low-cost, 
affordable 
elec-
tricity, which is renewable energy that pro-
vides power to 22 rural Idaho utilities serv-
ing tens of thousands of Idahoans, numerous 
Idaho cities, farmers, and industries, while 
acting as a battery to integrate other inter-
mittent renewable energy resources on the 
system; and 
Whereas, the Idaho Legislature believes 
that 
any 
actions 
to 
degrade 
the 
functionality, in whole or in part, or to re-
move or breach dams on the Columbia-Snake 
River System or its tributaries, or to take 
water from the state for anadromous fish en-
hancement efforts would inflict on the citi-
zenry of the state a loss in economic and 
trade opportunities, a loss of recharge waters 
for the state’s aquifers, a loss of navigation 
and transportation, an increased risk of 
floods, an increase in electrical rates, a 
shortfall in power generation, a loss of rec-
reational opportunities, and a threatened 
quality of life for Idaho citizens. Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, By the members of the First Reg-
ular Session of the Sixty-sixth Idaho Legis-
lature, the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein, that Idaho 
opposes the removal or breaching of the 
dams on the Columbia-Snake River System 
and its tributaries, has sovereignty of its 
water resources, prohibits contributions of 
water from Idaho’s reservoirs for flow aug-
mentation except those expressly authorized 
by state law, contends that efforts for fur-
ther recovery of anadromous fish must be 
based on sound science, and supports mainte-
nance and multiple-use benefits of the Co-
lumbia-Snake River System. Additionally, 
the Idaho Legislature recognizes and sup-
ports 
the 
international 
competitiveness, 
multimodal transportation, and economic 
development benefits provided by the Port of 
Lewiston. Be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be, and she is hereby authorized and directed 
to forward a copy of this Memorial to the 
President of the Senate and the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives of Congress and 
to 
the 
congressional 
delegations 
rep-
resenting the states of Idaho, Montana, 
Washington, and Oregon in the Congress of 
the United States. 
POM–72. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii urging statewide 
implementation of the United Nations uni-
versal periodic review recommendations; to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 157 
Whereas, the United Nations (UN) estab-
lished the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) 
in 2006 to review the human rights records of 
all one hundred ninety-three UN member 
states, with the goal of improving human 
rights; and 
Whereas, every UN member state appears 
and actively participates in the UPR hosted 
by the UN Human Rights Council Working 
Group in Geneva twice a decade, with each 
review cycle lasting four and a half years; 
and 
Whereas, the United States appeared at the 
UPR in 2010, 2014, and most recently on No-
vember 9, 2020; and 
Whereas, hundreds of recommendations 
have been suggested to improve and produce 
a positive impact in Hawai‘i and the United 
States; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i is an island state with a 
multicultural population from around the 
world, recognizing the ancestral wisdom of 
our host culture, cherishing our natural en-
vironment, and recognizing our unique role 
in the United States and global community; 
and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i was considered in 1944 by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a poten-
tial host for the UN headquarters, to serve as 
a global diplomatic hub; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i has had civil society and 
community associations participate in all 
three UPR cycles and found that the stake-
holder submissions and recommendations 
issued provided a heightened awareness 
among state legislators of the significance of 
promoting and protecting human rights at 
home in Hawai‘i; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i hosts an annual Human 
Rights Day to illuminate important and im-
minent issues at the international and island 
levels and to review the recommendations 
provided in the UPR; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i was designated as Amer-
ica’s first Human Rights state by House Res-
olution No. 194, which was adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the Twenty-sev-
enth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Reg-
ular Session of 2014; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i was the first state to 
conduct a Voluntary Local Review at the 
UN, sharing our local strategies regarding 
the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
through our Aloha+ Challenge; and 
Whereas, the Office of Planning has sup-
ported the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, and it has aligned them with 
the Hawai‘i State Planning Act, the Hawai‘i 
2050 Sustainability Plan, and the State of 
Hawaii’s Aloha+ Challenge; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i continues to bring to-
gether civil society to review the UPR rec-
ommendations and to discuss innovative ini-
tiatives to realize human rights at home; 
and 
Whereas, in spring 2021, the UN Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
will issue a report connecting the third UPR 
human rights recommendations with the 17 
Sustainable Development Goals, which can 
be used as a guide to achieve the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development in Hawai‘i; and 
Whereas, civil society can generate solu-
tions and share templates that provide con-
cise, complete contributions about how to 
realize human rights on every Hawaiian is-
land; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i continues to be pioneer 
in peace, sustainability, human rights, and 
global justice, partnering with city and 
county councils, as well as leadership from 
state agencies and elected public officials, to 
maintain the human rights movement in 
Hawai‘i; and 
Whereas, Hawai‘i continues to participate 
in all phases of the UN processes, and it will

continue to organize community conversa-
tions and commemorations for upcoming 
global events such as the Paris Agreement, 
using a locally determined contribution 
(LDC) to supplement the nationally deter-
mined contribution (NDC) and future reports 
to the United Nations Human Right Core 
Treaty Bodies; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular 
Session of 2021, that the Office of Planning is 
requested to implement the recommenda-
tions of the third Universal Periodic Review 
statewide across all executive departments 
in furtherance of the State’s Planning Act; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the UN Secretary 
General, UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, President of the United States, Vice 
President of the United States, Speaker of 
the U.S. House of Representatives, Majority 
Leader of the U.S. Senate, Hawai‘i’s congres-
sional delegation, U.S. Department of State, 
Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, Gov-
ernor, and Director of Planning. 
POM–73. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio 
urging the United States Congress not to 
adopt H.R. 1 of the 117th Congress; to the 
Committee on Rules and Administration. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 5 
Whereas, House Resolution 1, a sweeping 
federal bill that would usurp the power of 
states to conduct elections as they see fit, 
against the intentions of our nation’s found-
ers, is currently under consideration by Con-
gress; and 
Whereas, Article I, section 4 of the United 
States Constitution grants the legislative 
branch of each state the authority to pre-
scribe the ‘‘Times, Places and Manner of 
holding Elections for Senators and Rep-
resentatives,’’ 
an 
authority 
the 
United 
States Congress should only supersede in 
‘‘extraordinary circumstances’’ according to 
Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Number 
59; and 
Whereas, Voting laws have evolved across 
the 50 states over time, providing more and 
more access, security, and accuracy. But 
most importantly, each of those same 50 
states have created their own unique elec-
tion systems. From who administers the 
elections, to how votes are cast, to how a 
vote is protected—each unique system was 
born of federalism; and 
Whereas, The imperfection of voting laws 
across the country is not proof that H.R. 1 is 
necessary or appropriate, but rather evi-
dence that United States citizens are con-
tinuing to strive toward a more perfect 
union; and 
Whereas, Forcing completely new stand-
ards, procedures, and expectations into state 
election systems, which are not built for 
those requirements, as is the case under H.R. 
1, would bring chaos to those election sys-
tems, and that chaos would bring with it a 
lack of trust by the people in the results of 
those elections; and 
Whereas, In Ohio, a state whose elections 
have long been under the watchful eye of the 
nation, we have developed a system that has 
ensured voters have confidence in the out-
come of our elections. Voter fraud and voter 
suppression are exceedingly rare. Our efforts 
to strengthen the security of our elections 
have become a national model. States are 
even coming to us to learn our best election 
practices so they can mirror them back 
home; Now therefore be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the 
134th General Assembly of the State of Ohio, 
affirm our belief in the federal structure of 
the United States government and declare 
current voting laws a credit to the design of 
federal government to allow for democratic 
experimentation 
throughout 
the 
several 
states; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge the United States 
Congress not to adopt H.R. 1 of the 117th 
Congress; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives transmit a duly authenti-
cated copy of this resolution to the Speaker 
and Clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the President Pro Tempore and 
Secretary of the United States Senate, the 
members of the Ohio Congressional delega-
tion, and the news media of Ohio so they 
may be apprised of the sense of the General 
Assembly of the. State of Ohio in this mat-
ter. 
POM–74. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-

1972 Equal Rights Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States only was valid 
through March 22, 1979; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4010 
Whereas, the 92nd Congress of the United 
States of America, during its second session, 
with the constitutionally required vote of 
two-thirds of both houses, on March 22, 1972, 
gave final approval to House Joint Resolu-
tion No. 208, commonly referred to as the 
Equal Rights Amendment, to propose the 
amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, pursuant to Article V of the 
Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, in offering the proposed federal 
constitutional 
amendment 
to 
America’s 
state lawmakers, the 92nd Congress chose a 
deadline of 7 years, or until March 22, 1979, 
for the constitutionally mandated ratifica-
tion of the amendment by three-fourths of 
the country’s state legislatures; and 
Whereas, in Senate Concurrent Resolution 
No. 4007, the regular session of the 44th Leg-
islative Assembly in 1975, responded by rati-
fying the proposed 1972 Equal Rights Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United 
States; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of North Dakota, the 
House of Representatives concurring therein: 
That the 67th Legislative Assembly deems 
that the vitality of Senate Concurrent Reso-
lution No. 4007 of the 44th Legislative Assem-
bly by which North Dakota lawmakers rati-
fied the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment, offi-
cially lapsed at 11:59 p.m. on March 22, 1979; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That, after March 22, 1979, the 
Legislative Assembly, while in agreement 
women and men should enjoy equal rights in 
the eyes of the law, should not be counted by 
Congress, the Archivist of the United States, 
lawmakers in any other state, any court of 
law, or any other person, as still having on 
record a live ratification of the proposed 
Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States as was offered by 
House Joint Resolution No. 208 of the 92nd 
Congress on March 22, 1972; and be it further 
Resolved, That the 67th Legislative Assem-
bly respectfully requests the full and com-
plete verbatim text of this resolution be duly 
published in the United States Senate’s por-
tion of the Congressional Record, as an offi-
cial memorial to the United States Senate, 
and that this resolution be referred to the 
committee of the United States Senate with 
appropriate jurisdiction over its subject 
matter; and be it further 
Resolved, That the 67th Legislative Assem-
bly respectfully requests the substance of 
this resolution be duly entered in the United 
States House of Representatives’ portion of 
the Congressional Record, as an official me-
morial to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and that this resolution be re-
ferred to the committee of the United States 
House of Representatives with appropriate

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
SULLIVAN, Ms. DUCKWORTH, and 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO): 
S. 2688. A bill to require consulta-
tions on reuniting Korean Americans 
with family members in North Korea; 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the ‘‘Korean War 
Divided Families Reunification Act’’ 
with my colleague Senator SULLIVAN. 
This bipartisan piece of legislation 
would open opportunities for Korean 
Americans to be included in reunions 
with their relatives who remain in 
North Korea. Many first generation 
Korean Americans, now in their 80’s 
and 90’s, are waiting to be reunited 
with their parents, spouses, children, 
siblings, and cousins. They should not 
have to wait any longer. 
One of the tragic legacies of the Ko-
rean War is the permanent separation 
of Korean families. Sixty-eight years 
ago, the United States, People’s Repub-
lic of China, North Korea, and South 
Korea agreed to an armistice which 
drew a new border between North 
Korea from South Korea. Since then, 
there has been little contact between 
South Koreans and their family mem-
bers who remained in North Korea, and 
almost no contact between Korean 
Americans and their loved ones in 
North Korea. 
North and South Korea first agreed 
to hold reunions of divided families in 
1985. There have been 21 face-to face re-
unions and multiple video-link re-
unions, which have given approxi-
mately 24,500 Koreans the opportunity 
to briefly reunite with loved ones. 
There is no official channel, however, 
for Korean Americans to participate in 
these reunions. 
Many Korean Americans long for an 
opportunity to meet their North Ko-
rean relatives. My constituent, Carol 
Li from Honolulu, wants to reconnect 
with her family’s past and learn more 
about where her grandparents were 
from. Carol’s maternal grandparents 
fled from North Korea to the South 
during the Korean War, leaving behind 
their 
siblings. 
Unfortunately, 
her 
grandparents passed away before they 
were able to reconnect with their sib-
lings who remained in North Korea. 
While she was teaching English in 
South Korea, she grew more curious 
about her North Korean relatives and 
the war that divided them. With pas-
sage of this legislation, Carol hopes she 
can participate in future reunions to 
meet her North Korean relatives. She 
deserves the opportunity to do so. 
The legislation I am introducing 
would open official channels between 
Korean Americans and their families in 
North Korea by directing the U.S. Sec-
retary of State to consult with his 
counterpart in South Korea to identify 
opportunities for Korean Americans to 
participate in future family reunions. 
It also directs the State Department’s 
Special Envoy on North Korean Human 
Rights Issues to consult the Korean 
American community on efforts to re-
unite families, including opportunities 
for video reunions. 
Time is of the essence for those who 
have been seeking the opportunity to 
reconnect with their loved ones for 
nearly seven decades. Thanks to the 
leadership of Rep. GRACE MENG of New 
York, the House of Representatives 
passed this legislation on July 19, 2021 
by a vote of 415 to 0. It is time for the 
Senate to act. I call on my Senate col-
leagues to swiftly pass this bill. Thank 
you. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mrs. CAPITO): 
S. 2691. A bill to amend title XIX of 
the Social Security Act to ensure ade-
quate access to vaccines under the 
Medicaid program and the Vaccines for 
Children program, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
pleased to introduce the Strengthening 
the Vaccines for Children Program Act 
of 2021 with Senator SHELLEY MOORE 
CAPITO. This bill seeks to protect chil-
dren and their communities from pre-
ventable illness during the pandemic 
and for the long term by making vac-
cines more accessible. Similar bipar-
tisan legislation has been introduced in 
the House of Representatives by Rep-
resentatives KIM SCHRIER, JOHN JOYCE, 
G.K. BUTTERFIELD, and DAVID MCKIN-
LEY. 
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, rou-
tine childhood vaccination rates are 
down, as parents have sought to avoid 
visits to the doctor and other medical 
care for their children for fear of catch-
ing or spreading COVID–19. These lower 
immunizations rates raise the very real 
possibility of a secondary outbreak of 
an infectious disease such as measles, 
mumps, or whooping cough. The Vac-
cines for Children (VFC) program pro-
vides federally purchased vaccines to 
approximately half of all children in 
the United States, including children 
who are enrolled in Medicaid or who 
are uninsured or underinsured, and 
plays a critical role in ensuring high 
rates of childhood vaccination. As chil-
dren return to school in person this 
fall, the VFC program will be critical 
to helping children catch up on their 
routine immunizations to prevent out-
breaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. 
However, much more must be done to 
update and improve the VFC program 
to better reflect the challenges of ad-
ministering vaccines today. 
Our 
bipartisan 
legislation 
would 
modernize the VFC program, address-
ing barriers to participation among 
families and their pediatricians. As 
such, this bill would extend eligibility 
to children enrolled in the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program, stream-
lining and filling a gap in program ad-
ministration. The bill would also en-
sure that Medicaid can pay appro-
priately for the administration and 
counseling of modern, multicomponent 
vaccines, helping to address vaccine 
hesitancy. Lastly, the bill includes new 
reporting requirements to identify dis-
parities and pockets of low vaccination 
rates. 
This legislation has already passed 
unanimously in the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, demonstrating 
broad, bipartisan support for improving 
the VFC program and addressing lag-
ging childhood vaccination rates. I 
look forward to working with Sen. CAP-
ITO, 
as 
well 
as 
Representatives 
SCHRIER, 
JOYCE, 
BUTTERFIELD, 
and 
MCKINLEY towards passage of this leg-
islation in both chambers in the near 
future. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 2693. A bill to amend the Reclama-
tion Projects Authorization and Ad-
justment Act of 1992 to authorize addi-
tional projects related to the Salton 
Sea, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the bipartisan ‘‘Salton 
Sea Projects Improvement Act’’ to ex-
pand the Bureau of Reclamation’s abil-
ity to participate and invest in projects 
at the Salton Sea. 
This legislation would ensure Rec-
lamation can meaningfully partner 
with state, local, and Tribal govern-
ments to address both the public 
health and environmental crises at the 
Salton Sea. 
Under current law, the Bureau of 
Reclamation is only able to engage in 
projects that have a research focus. 
This means that Reclamation can only 
engage in projects to research how to 
protect habitat, enhance fisheries, en-
hance recreational opportunities, or 
control salinity. Reclamation also op-
erates under a $10 million authoriza-
tion. 
This effectively prohibits Reclama-
tion from participating in the Salton 
Sea Management Program run by Cali-
fornia. 
This legislation would expand Rec-
lamation’s authority so they can par-
ticipate in large-scale projects, even if 
they don’t have a research focus. 
Projects could improve air and water 
quality, restore fish and wildlife habi-
tat, and improve public health at the 
Salton Sea. It would also increase Rec-
lamation’s authorization for Salton 
Sea efforts from $10 million to $250 mil-
lion. 
The Salton Sea, located in southern 
Riverside and northern Imperial coun-
ties, is California’s largest inland body 
of water. It formed after Colorado 
River floodwater breached an irriga-
tion canal and flowed into the Salton 
Sink. 
The current Salton Sea maintains 
water levels from irrigation runoff but 
has been shrinking for many years. The 
water has become increasingly salty, 
so much so that its salinity is 50% 
higher than the Pacific Ocean. This has 
led to major water quality issues with

devastating impacts to the Salton 
Sea’s ecosystem, which serves as crit-
ical habitat for migratory waterfowl 
and other species. 
But this ecological crisis has even 
more widespread impacts. The declin-
ing water levels have also exposed wide 
swaths of lakebed at the Salton Sea, 
polluting the air with dust and pes-
ticides. 
The 
largely 
disadvantaged 
communities who live nearby suffer 
from toxic, poisonous air and experi-
ence higer levels of related health con-
ditions like asthma. 
It is an environmental and public 
health crisis, and we need to ensure 
that the Bureau of Reclamation has 
the authority it need to partner with 
the State of California, Tribal and 
local governments, and nonprofits to 
adequately address these crises. 
I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for co- 
leading this bill with me, and for her 
decades of efforts at the Salton Sea. I 
also thank Congressmen RUIZ

(1) the Comptroller General of the United

SEC. 4007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREAT-
MENT OF REDUCTION OF APPRO-
PRIATIONS 
LEVELS 
TO 
ACHIEVE 
SAVINGS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for fis-
cal year 1981, gave authorizing committees 
reconciliation instructions which amounted 
to approximately two-thirds of the savings 
required under reconciliation. 
(2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 re-
sulted in a debate about how reconciling dis-
cretionary spending programs could be in 
order given that authorizations of appropria-
tions for programs did not actually change 
spending and the programs authorized would 
be funded through later annual appropria-
tion. The staff of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate and the counsel to the 
Majority Leader advised that upon consulta-
tion with the Parliamentarian, the original 
instructions on discretionary spending would 
be out of order because of the phrase, ‘‘to 
modify programs’’. This was seen as too 
broad and programs could be modified with-
out resulting in changes to their future ap-
propriations. 
(3) To rectify this violation, the Com-
mittee on the Budget of the Senate reported 
S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising the 
congressional budget for the United States 
Government for fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 
1983, to include reconciliation, which revised 
the language in the reconciliation instruc-
tions to change entitlement law and ‘‘to re-
port changes in laws within the jurisdiction 
of that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings’’. 
(4) This was understood to mean changes in 
authorization language of discretionary pro-
grams would be permissible under reconcili-
ation procedures provided such changes in 
law would have the result in affecting a 
change in later outlays derived from future 
appropriations. Further it was understood 
that a change in authorization language that 
caused a change in later outlays was consid-
ered to be a change in outlays for the pur-
pose of reconciliation. 
(5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 
10 to approve S. Con. Res. 9 with the modi-
fied reconciliation language. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that committees reporting 
changes in laws within the jurisdiction of 
that committee sufficient to reduce appro-
priations levels so as to achieve savings shall 
be considered to be changes in outlays for 
the purpose of enforcing the prohibition on 
extraneous matters in reconciliation bills. 
SEC. 4008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIV-
ERS. 
In the Senate, it shall not be in order to 
move to waive or suspend a point of order 
under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 
U.S.C. 621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolu-
tion on the budget with respect to a bill, 
joint 
resolution, 
motion, 
amendment, 
amendment between the Houses, or con-
ference report unless the point of order has 
been specifically raised by a Senator. 
SEC. 4009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION RE-
DUCING APPROPRIATIONS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-
tions in effect under section 302(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
633(a)) and the allocations of a committee or 
committees, aggregates, and other appro-
priate levels in this resolution for any bill or 
joint resolution considered pursuant to sec-
tion 2001 containing the recommendations of 
one or more committees, or for one or more 
amendments to, a conference report on, or 
an amendment between the Houses in rela-
tion to such a bill or joint resolution, by the 
amounts necessary to accommodate the re-
duction in the amount of discretionary ap-
propriations for a fiscal year caused by the 
measure. 
SEC. 4010. ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT LEGISLA-
TION NOT INCLUDED IN THE BASE-
LINE. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may make adjustments 
to the levels and allocations in this resolu-
tion to reflect legislation enacted before the 
date on which this resolution is agreed to by 
Congress that is not incorporated in the 
baseline underlying the Congressional Budg-
et Office’s September 2020 update to the 
Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030. 
SEC. 4011. AUTHORITY. 
Congress adopts this title under the au-
thority under section 301(b)(4) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
632(b)(4)). 
SEC. 4012. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS. 
Congress adopts the provisions of this 
title— 
(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power 
of the Senate, and as such they shall be con-
sidered as part of the rules of the Senate and 
such rules shall supersede other rules only to 
the extent that they are inconsistent with 
such other rules; and 
(2) with full recognition of the constitu-
tional right of the Senate to change those 
rules at any time, in the same manner, and 
to the same extent as is the case of any other 
rule of the Senate.

icit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 902) (as in 
effect prior to September 30, 2002) if the pro-
vision was included in legislation other than 
an appropriation Act; and 
(B) results in a net decrease in budget au-
thority in the current year or the budget 
year, but does not result in a net decrease in 
outlays over the period of the total of the 
current year, the budget year, and all fiscal 
years covered under the most recently adopt-
ed concurrent resolution on the budget; 
(2) the term ‘‘Crime Victims Fund’’ means 
the Crime Victims Fund established under 
section 1402 of the Victims of Crime Act of 
1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101); and

means the annual average amount that was

in such bill or joint resolution, or amend-
ment

amendment 
between 
the 
Houses in relation thereto, conference report 
thereon, or motion thereon, that contains a 
CHIMP that, if enacted, would cause the 
amount available for obligation during the 
fiscal year from the Crime Victims Fund to 
be less than the 3-year average amount. 
(B) POINT OF ORDER SUSTAINED.—If a point 
of order is made by a Senator against a pro-

sist of only that portion of the conference re-
port or House amendment, as the case may

port by operation of this subsection), no fur-
ther amendment shall be in order. 
(4) SUPERMAJORITY WAIVER AND APPEAL.—In 
the Senate, this subsection may be waived or 
suspended only by an affirmative vote of 
three-fifths of the Members, duly chose and 
sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of

sworn shall be required to sustain an appeal 
of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order 
raised under this subsection.

ment to, or a conference report on, a bill or 
joint resolution making full-year appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2022 if such amendment

August 10, 2021 
HONORING PRESIDENT BARACK 
OBAMA ON HIS 60TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of the nation’s 
greatest presidents, Barack Obama, who turns 
60 years old. It is fitting and proper that we 
take a moment to recount and appreciate the 
extraordinary accomplishments of President 
Barack Obama, the 44th president and one of 
the singular figures in American history. 
Madam Speaker, I remember that cold morn-
ing of January 20, 2009, one of the coldest 
days on record in Washington, D.C. But it was 
nothing compared to the chill wind blowing 
through the American economy and body poli-
tic. 
The nation was facing economic challenges 
unseen since the Great Depression: Ameri-
cans were losing their jobs at a frightening 
rate of 800,000 per month; the national unem-
ployment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and 
would continue to climb until reaching its peak 
of 10.0 percent in October 2009. For African 
Americans, the numbers were much grimmer, 
a jobless rate of 13.5 percent in January 2009 
which would grow to 16.5 percent by the end 
of the year. And on top of this, tens of thou-
sands of American families each month were 
losing their health insurance and their homes 
to foreclosure. 
The United States was still bogged down in 
the quagmire that was the Iraq War and young 
people by the thousands were being forced to 
defer or drop out of college because of lack of 
financial aid. And the average price of gas ex-
ceeded $4 per gallon. It was against this back-
drop that I watched from the inaugural plat-
form as Barack Obama, surrounded by his ra-
diant and beautiful wife, Michelle, and their 
two adorable daughters, rose to take the oath 
of office. After being sworn in as the nation’s 
44th President of the United States, President 
Obama reassured an anxious but hopeful na-
tion, saying: 
‘‘Today I say to you that the challenges we 
face are real. They are serious and they are 
many. They will not be met easily or in a short 
span of time. But know this America: They will 
be met.’’ 
Watching Barack Obama address the nation 
that day, spectators in attendance and viewers 
across the country and around the world un-
derstood they were witnessing a historic presi-
dent, the first African American ever to hold 
the nation’s highest office. 
But more than being a historic president, 
Barack Obama’s actions and leadership over 
the ensuing eight years would demonstrate his 
would be a consequential presidency that 
changed America for the better. His first and 
most pressing task was to rescue an economy 
on the brink of collapse. Working with the 
Democratic-controlled Congress, the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed, 
which created 3.7 million jobs and saved the 
jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters, police 
officers, and social service providers. The Re-
covery Act also cut taxes for working families, 
extended unemployment insurance, and ex-
panded the Earned Income and Child tax 
credits, which disproportionately benefit Afri-
can American families. The verdict is in on the 
economic plan put in place by President 
Obama and the Democratic Congress and it is 
undeniable. 
The Recovery Act ended the Great Reces-
sion, transformed the economy from one hem-
orrhaging jobs to one that created over 16 mil-
lion new jobs over a record 71 consecutive 
months. The national unemployment rate 
dipped under 5 percent for the first time since 
President Clinton left office, the deficit was cut 
by 71 percent, and the Dow Jones stock mar-
ket index set 118 record closing highs and 
stood at 19,732 on January 20, 2017, a three- 
fold over its nadir of 6,547 at the depths of the 
Great Recession. And, as an added benefit, 
the average price of gasoline fell from more 
than $4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest 
price since before the tragedy of September 
11. 
The Obama years also effected policy 
changes in the areas of criminal justice re-
form, health and education, national security, 
and foreign affairs. A partial listing of these 
achievements is substantial, impressive, and 
varied. President Obama signed the Fair Sen-
tencing Act in August 2010, which reduces the 
disparity in the amounts of powder cocaine 
and crack cocaine required for the imposition 
of mandatory minimum sentences and elimi-
nates the mandatory minimum sentence for 
simple possession of crack cocaine. In July 
2015, President Obama became the first 
president ever to tour a federal prison when 
he visited the El Reno Federal Correctional In-
stitution outside of Oklahoma City. President 
Obama launched the Smart on Crime initiative 
through which the Department of Justice modi-
fied its charging policies certain federal low- 
level drug-related offenses, improved diversion 
and re-entry policies, and strengthened protec-
tions for the most vulnerable. 
President Obama established Smart on Ju-
venile Justice grant program to expand the 
use of effective community-based alternatives 
to youth detention and launched the Second 
Chance Pell Pilot Program for Incarcerated In-
dividuals to test new models to allow incarcer-
ated Americans to receive Pell Grants and 
pursue the postsecondary education with the 
goal of helping them get jobs, support their 
families, and turn their lives around. 
President Obama directed the Office of Per-
sonnel Management to act where it can to 
‘‘ban the box’’ by modifying its rules to delay 
inquiries into criminal history until later in the 
hiring process and called on Congress. to 
enact legislation ’’banning the box’’ on job ap-
plications in the private sector. President 
Obama increased the use of body-worn cam-
eras through $20 million in grants to state and 
local law enforcement. President Obama 
issued an Executive Order to increase the ca-
pacity of VA mental-health programs by hiring 
1,600 more mental-health professionals and 
expanding the capacity of the Veterans Crisis 
Line. President Obama provided nearly $60 
billion in benefit payments under the Post–9/ 
11 G.I. Bill to over 1.5 million individuals and 
relaxed the evidence requirements for vet-
erans seeking disability pay for post-traumatic 
stress disorder with the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. 
President Obama acted to reduce gun vio-
lence by issuing executive orders requiring 
background checks for people trying to buy 
some of the most dangerous weapons and 
other items through a trust or corporation and 
an overhaul of the background check system 
to make it more efficient and effective. Presi-
dent Obama signed into law the Affordable 
Care Act passed by the Democratic Congress 
which has provided access to quality, afford-
able health insurance to nearly 20 million pre-
viously uninsured Americans. 
President Obama launched the ‘‘My Broth-
er’s Keeper’’ Initiative in 2014 to address per-
sistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and 
young men of color and ensure that all young 
people can reach their full potential. In Octo-
ber 2009, Congress passed, and President 
Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and 
James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, 
historic legislation extending coverage of fed-
eral hate-crime law to include attacks based 
on the victim’s race, religion, nationality, or ac-
tual or perceived sexual orientation or gender 
identity. 
President Obama established the new De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) 
policy for young undocumented people who 
came to the U.S. as children in an effort to 
better focus enforcement resources. President 
Obama expanded opportunity for America’s 
children by strengthening Head Start. Presi-
dent Obama made college more affordable by 
increasing Pell grants, keeping interest rates 
on student loans low, and helping students 
manageably repay their loans. President 
Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids 
Act, which made historic investments: in im-
proved child nutrition and health for the 31 mil-
lion children who rely on school meals and up-
dated science-based school meal standards to 
increase fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean 
protein and low-fat dairy, while reducing fats 
and sodium. 
In December 2010, the Congress passed, 
and President Obama signed the Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 into law, allow-
ing gay men and women to serve openly and 
with integrity in the U.S. military. President 
Obama also made history by appointing two 
women to the U.S. Supreme Court, including 
the first Hispanic American to serve on the 
Court. President Obama appointed the first Af-
rican American man and woman to serve as 
Attorney General and the first woman to Chair 
the Federal Reserve Board. In the area of for-
eign affairs and national security, President 
Obama ended the Iraq War, assembled and 
led an international coalition to impose sanc-
tions so crippling on Iran that it was forced to

the negotiating table that yielded the Iran Nu-
clear Agreement that prevents Iran from ever 
attaining a nuclear weapon. And of course, as 
the world knows, because of President 
Obama’s leadership, General Motors is alive, 
and Osama Bin Laden is dead. 
President Barack Obama represented our 
country with grace, integrity, honor, and dis-
tinction. He provided consolation, hope, and 
healing in the face of unspeakable tragedies 
such as the massacre of innocent children at 
Sandy Hook, worshippers at Mother Emanuel 
AME Church in Charleston, spectators at the 
Boston Marathon, and mass shootings in Au-
rora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona. He ex-
pressed and symbolized our joy and pride in 
the progress made over the last half century— 
and the distance we still have to travel—when 
he marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
and addressed the multitude from the spot on 
the steps where Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
shared his dream for America’s future. 
It is clear beyond doubt that President 
Obama kept the promise he made to the na-
tion seven years ago on that cold day in Janu-
ary when he said: 
‘‘Today I say to you that the challenges we 
face are real . . . . But know this America: 
They will be met.’’ 
They were more than just met; under his 
leadership they were overcome with amazing 
grace. And because of President Barack 
Obama, when he left office the United States 
was stronger, more prosperous, and better po-
sitioned than ever to win the future. As a pres-
idential candidate in 2008, then Senator 
Obama promised the America people ‘‘change 
you can believe in.’’ 
In office, President Obama made good on 
that promise, delivering positive change that 
the American people can see and feel. And 
that is what makes his one of the most con-
sequential presidencies in American history. I 
wish President Obama a happy birthday, and 
thank him for all he did in leading our country 
to a new era of greatness.

CONGRATULATING 
BILL 
HAGER 
FOR BEING NAMED 2021 U.P. VET-
ERAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize retired Master Sergeant C. 
William ‘‘Bill’’ Hager as the 2021 Upper Penin-
sula Veteran of the Year. His continued serv-
ice on and off the battlefield, his dedication to 
fellow veterans, and his devotion to our local 
Michigan communities make him a well-de-
serving recipient of this distinguished award. 
The U.P. Veteran of the Year is chosen an-
nually by a selection committee consisting of 
past commanders of various service organiza-
tions throughout the Upper Peninsula. It rec-
ognizes Yooper veterans who go above and 
beyond in their service to their local commu-
nities and fellow veterans. 
A native Yooper, Bill was born and raised in 
Iron River and has stayed a longtime resident 
of the U.P. During his military career, Bill 
served in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Na-
tional Guard, where he was decorated with 
numerous awards which include but are not 
limited to the Meritorious Service Medal, Com-
bat Action Ribbon, and Vietnam Campaign 
Medal. His service to his fellow veterans has 
not waivered as he continues to be a life 
member of the DAV, American Legion, VFW, 
Vietnam Veterans of America, and AM Vets 
where he continues to advocate. The impact 
of his service on his fellow Michiganders can-
not be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late Bill Hager for his decades of service to 
fellow Michigan veterans and for being named 
the 2021 Upper Peninsula Veteran of the 
Year. Michiganders can take great pride in 
knowing the First District is home to such a 
selfless and devoted individual. On behalf of 
my constituents, I wish Bill all the best in his 
future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING COACH BOB 
SEPULVEDA 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to acknowledge Coach Bob Sepulveda. 
Bob is a 1954 graduate of Goodwell High 
School in Goodwell, Oklahoma, where he let-
tered in football, basketball, and baseball. He 
then attended Oklahoma Panhandle State Uni-
versity, earning his B.A. degree in History in 
1958, while also lettering in football and track. 
Bob’s coaching career began in 1960 in Tel-
luride, Colorado, where he served as head 
basketball and track coach and assistant 
baseball coach. His 1964 basketball team won 
the Mountain League District Class A Cham-
pionship and placed second at the Western 
Colorado Regional Class A tournament. He 
also helped coach the 1964 Telluride High 
School baseball team that won the Class A 
State Championship. 
Taking his coaching career on the road, Bob 
moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico, in 1964, 
where he coached both track and football for 
32 years. In 1969 he was named head track 
coach and then head football coach in 1971. 
During his 27 years as head track coach his 
teams won more medals for Alamogordo than 
any coach in its history. 
19 District Championships, 5 State Cham-
pionships, 1 second place finish, 5 third place 
finishes, 170 Invitational Track meet wins, and 
102 first place medals at the State Track Meet 
showcase Bob’s dedication to the team and 
the athletes. 
Under Bob’s coaching, several student ath-
letes went on to become NCAA Champions, 
some establishing records that still stand 
today. Three of his athletes even went on to 
the Olympic trials. 
If his record alone wasn’t a testament to 
Bob’s coaching abilities, he has also received 
numerous 
awards 
during 
his 
tenure 
at 
Alamogordo High School. He was selected as 
New Mexico Coach of the Year for boys track 
in 1982, 1991, and 1996 and received the 
NHSACA Region 8 Coach of the Year in 
1982, 1991, and 1996. He was also named 
the NFSHSA Section 6 Coach of the Year in 
1991 and 1996 and was also awarded, along 
with his wife Marilyn, the New Mexico High 
School Coaches Association Level IV Coach-
ing Milestone ring in 1989 and was inducted 
into the Alamogordo Tiger Hall of Fame in 
1988. He also served on the Board of Direc-
tors for the New Mexico Track and Field and 
Cross-Country Association and was the Presi-
dent of the Association from 1991 through 
1992. 
In a fitting act of recognition for his lifelong 
dedication and achievements, the Board of 
Education of the Alamogordo Public School 
District voted to name the Alamogordo High 
School Tiger Stadium Track in honor of Bob 
Sepulveda. A public celebration and official 
public christening will take place on Sep-
tember 3, 2021.

IN RECOGNITION OF DEPUTY PHIL-

OF 
THE 
KERN 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF’S 
DEPART-
MENT 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of the Deputy Phillip 
Campas who passed away in the line of duty 
on July 25, 2021. 
Deputy Campas began serving the Kern 
County Sheriff’s Department in February of 
2016. He held a variety of positions within the 
department including patrol deputy, recruit 
training officer, and SWAT team member. He 
provided firearms training and mentoring for all 
armed staff. In addition, Deputy Campas 
served the United States Marine Corps and 
was deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. His 
commitment to protecting the Kern County 
community and the citizens of the United 
States was unwavering and a true sign of her-
oism. 
Deputy Campas demonstrated great cour-
age and bravery while protecting the residents 
of Kern County. During his final mission, Dep-
uty Campas lived up to his reputation of fear-
lessness in his rescue efforts and leaves be-
hind a legacy of incredible dedication and self-
lessness. The Kern County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment and his entire community mourns this 
great loss. 
Deputy Campas is survived by his wife 
Christina, his two daughters, and his stepson. 
He is remembered as a hero of Kern County, 
a true public servant, and a beloved member 
of his community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the life of Deputy Sheriff Phillip Campas.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA ZONING COMMIS-
SION HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Zoning Com-
mission Home Rule Act. This bill would give 
the District of Columbia the authority to ap-
point all members of the D.C. Zoning Commis-
sion (Commission). Currently, the Commission 
consists of two federal officials (the Architect 
of the Capitol (AOC) and the Director of the 
National Park Service (NPS), or their des-
ignees), and three mayoral appointees, sub-
ject to D.C. Council approval. The federal offi-
cials are members even though the Commis-
sion has no authority over federal property. 
Land use is a quintessential local matter in 
our country. Despite the D.C. Home Rule Act, 
which gave the District jurisdiction over its 
local matters, 40 percent of the members of 
the Commission are federal officials, who are 
unaccountable to the more than 700,000 resi-
dents who live in the District. The federal gov-
ernment would lose nothing as a result of this 
bill because the federal government’s land-use 
interests in the nation’s capital are protected 
by federal law and federal agencies. 
The Commission creates the zoning maps 
and regulations, which must ‘‘not be incon-
sistent with the comprehensive plan for the 
national capital.’’ The mayor is responsible for 
the local elements of the comprehensive plan, 
subject to Council approval. The National Cap-
ital Planning Commission (NCPC), which is 
the central federal planning agency for the 
federal government in D.C. and approves fed-
eral projects here, is responsible for the fed-
eral elements of the comprehensive plan. This 
bill would not alter the comprehensive plan 
process or the authority of NCPC and the 
Commission. 
This bill would immediately remove the AOC 
and the Director of the NPS from the Commis-
sion, and the Commission would, at least ini-
tially, consist solely of the three mayoral ap-
pointees. The District would have the authority 
to reconstitute the membership of the Com-
mission through local legislation. 
This is an important step to increase home 
rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this bill.

FAREWELL TO MAJOR BRITTANY 
WEIGHTMAN 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. BROWN. Madam Speaker, today I 
honor a superb leader, liaison and soldier for 
her tireless commitment to the United States 
Army which include three years of service with 
the Army Office of the Legislative Liaison. Dur-
ing 2019, Major Brittany Weightman served in 
the Washington office of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Maryland and went on to 
serve as an Army Legislative Liaison in the 
Senate. As Major Brittany Weightman pre-
pares to go to the Defense Programs Support 
Activity, in Elkridge, Maryland, I believe it is fit-
ting to recognize her dedication to fostering 
the relationship between the U.S. Army and 
Congress. 
Major Weightman was essential to the of-
fice. She worked to solidify important legisla-
tion in the National Defense Authorization Act, 
proved invaluable in educating Members and 
staff on Army combat systems, modernization 
programs, and policy initiatives. 
Major Weightman has deployed three times: 
twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. She is 
the recipient of the multiple Bronze Star Med-
als, Combat Action Badge, Meritorious Service 
Medals, and many other deserved awards. 
I am thankful for her commitment to Amer-
ica 
and 
this 
Chamber 
will 
feel 
Major 
Weightman’s absence. I join many past and 
present Members of Congress in my gratitude 
and appreciation to Major Weightman for her 
outstanding leadership and unwavering sup-
port.

HONORING JEFFREY J. JACOBSON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Senior Master 
Sergeant Jeffrey Jacobson, who had an ac-
complished military career in the United States 
Air Force and was an upstanding community 
member in California’s 5th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Born in Vallejo, Calif. and raised in Napa, 
California, Senior Master Sergeant Jacobson 
rooted himself in bettering our community from 
the start. After graduating from Napa High 
School in 1984, he enlisted in the United 
States Air Force and served for 26 years, retir-
ing in 2011 as the First Sergeant of the 48th 
Security Forces Squadron, RAF Lakenheath, 
England. In addition to serving overseas in 
multiple countries, he pursued a degree in 
criminal justice at Minot State University and 
then a Master of Arts in adult education from 
Central Michigan University. 
Senior Master Sergeant Jacobson’s service 
can only be described as that of a true Amer-
ican patriot. In his deployments to Saudi Ara-
bia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, he supported Oper-
ations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. 
He was best described as being rooted in the 
Air Force’s core values of ‘‘Integrity first, Serv-
ice before self, and Excellence in all we do.’’ 
For his outstanding character and strong lead-
ership, he was named the 31st Fighter Wing 
and the United States Air Forces in Europe 
First Sergeant of the Year for 2005, and the 
48th Fighter Wing First Sergeant of the Year 
for 2009. 
After serving in the military, Senior Master 
Sergeant Jacobson was a devoted educator in 
retirement, and an incredibly loving family 
man. He founded Heritage High School’s Air 
Force Junior ROTC Program in Brentwood, 
California, where he served as the Aerospace 
Science Instructor. He also served as Post 
Commander of Karl H. Kreh Veterans of For-
eign Wars Post 1123 and supported the Vet-
erans Home in Yountville, California. He is 
survived by his two daughters, Elizabeth and 
Rebecca, and life partner, Charlein, for whom 
he was a supportive and loving family mem-
ber. 
Madam Speaker, Sergeant Jacobson was a 
larger-than-life leader in the community, in the 
military, and in the classroom. It is therefore 
fitting and proper that we honor his life here 
today.

HONORING RAY DIPASQUALE AT 
THE CONCLUSION OF HIS ROLE 
AS PRESIDENT OF CLINTON COM-
MUNITY COLLEGE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ray DiPasquale at the conclu-
sion of his role as president of Clinton Com-
munity College. 
President DiPasquale has dedicated his 
long and distinguished career to higher edu-
cation. Before coming to Clinton Community 
College, he previously served as president of 
the Community College of Rhode Island and 
held positions at the Rhode Island Board of 
Governors for Higher Education, the SUNY 
College at Brockport, Springfield Technical 
Community College, and Middlesex Commu-
nity College. After a nationwide search, he 
was selected as the new president of 
Massasoit Community College, where he will 
work following his departure from the Clinton 
Community College. 
President DiPasquale has been with Clinton 
Community College since 2016, where he 
oversaw $28 million of campus renovations 
and the creation of the Institute for Advanced 
Manufacturing, both of which will benefit stu-
dents at the college for years to come. The 
North Country is proud of the work he has 
done for Clinton Community College through-
out his over four years of service and are 
grateful for the strong partnerships and friend-
ships he developed with the local community. 
President DiPasquale has shown exemplary 
dedication to the students and faculty at Clin-
ton Community College and has represented 
the North Country well. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st Congressional District, I would like 
to congratulate president DiPasquale for his 
contributions to the college and the commu-
nity. I wish him the best of luck as he takes 
on his new role.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
SPEERS BOROUGH MAYOR WIL-
LIAM LEE 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Speers Borough 
Mayor William ‘‘Bill’’ Lee, who passed away on 
December 18, 2020, at the age of 75. As a 
lifetime resident of the Mon-Valley, Bill will al-
ways be remembered for his commitment to 
his community, region, and country. 
After graduating from California State Col-
lege in 1967, Bill’s amiability led him to a ca-
reer in sales and in 1980, he joined his cous-
ins at Lee Supply Company. With their rollout 
of HDPE pipe in the 1970s, Lee Supply Co. 
had become one of the largest suppliers of 
pipe and pumping systems for the eastern 
United States. As environmental sales man-
ager, he was fondly known as ‘‘Land Fill Bill.’’ 
He retired in 2013 but remained active to 
mentor the next generation and represent Lee 
Supply Co. at trade shows. 
Throughout his life, Mayor Lee’s dedication 
to his community was clear. He served on the 
Mon Valley Progress Council, Charleroi Area 
Board of Education, the Water Authority Board 
of Charleroi and as chairman of the Charleroi 
Regional Police Department. Most remarkably, 
Bill served as Speers Borough mayor for more 
than twenty years. 
Beyond public service, Bill was a pillar of his 
community. At St. Andrew of the Apostle, his 
booming voice was the first to lead parish-
ioners in song. As the president of the Mon 
Valley Ancient Order of Hibernians, he sang 
his way through 40 years at the Pittsburgh St. 
Patrick Day parades, receiving many awards 
for singing ‘‘Molly Malone.’’ Bill was also well 
known for his impromptu but enthusiastic ren-
ditions of ‘‘God Bless America.’’ As a Meals 
on Wheels delivery man, he treated everyone 
with dignity and made their week brighter. 
Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness 
that I recognize the loss of Mayor William 
‘‘Bill’’ Lee. Bill’s outstanding legacy of service 
will have a lasting impact and he will be great-
ly missed by his family, friends, and commu-
nity. 
COMMEMORATING 56TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS 
ACT OF 1965 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today not just to commemorate the landmark 
achievement of 56 years ago but to inform our 
colleagues and the nation of the need to re-
double and rededicate our efforts to the work 
that remains to be done to protect the right of 
all Americans to vote free from discrimination 
and the injustices that prevent them from exer-
cising this most fundamental right of citizen-
ship. 
On August 6, 1965, in the rotunda of the 
Capitol and in the presence of such luminaries 
as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference; Roy Wilkins of 
the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National 
Urban League; James Foreman of the Con-
gress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of 
the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John 
Lewis of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating 
Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert 
Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President 
Johnson addressed the nation before signing 
the Voting Rights Act: 
‘‘The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which im-
prison men because they are different from 
other men.’’ 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to 
preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-
tions that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised. In 1940, for exam-
ple, there were less than 30,000 African Amer-
icans registered to vote in Texas and only 
about 3 percent of African Americans living in 
the south were registered to vote. Poll taxes, 
literacy tests, and threats of violence were the 
major causes of these racially discriminatory 
results. After passage of the Voting Rights Act 
in 1965, which prohibited these discriminatory 
practices, registration and electoral participa-
tion steadily increased to the point that by 
2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans 
living in Texas were registered to vote. 
In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights 
Act became law, there were approximately 
300 African Americans in public office, includ-
ing just three in Congress. Few, if any, African 
Americans held elective office anywhere in the 
south. Because of the Voting Rights Act, today 
there are more than 9,100 black elected offi-
cials, including 46 members of Congress, the 
largest number ever. Because of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 signed into law by Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson on this day 53 years 
ago, I stand before you as the first African 
American woman Ranking Member of the 
House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. 
Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act 
opened the political process for many of the 
approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials 
that have been elected and appointed nation-
wide, including more than 275 at the state or 
federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress. 
Native Americans, Asians, and others who 
have historically encountered harsh barriers to 
full political participation also have benefited 
greatly. The crown jewel of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 is Section 5, which requires that 
states and localities with a chronic record of 
discrimination in voting practices secure fed-
eral approval before making any changes to 
voting processes. Section 5 protects minority 
voting rights where voter discrimination has 
historically been the worst. 
Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more 
than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in 
their 
tracks, 
including 
107 
discriminatory 
changes right here in Texas. And it is a 
source of eternal pride to all of us in Houston 
that in pursuit of extending the full measure of 
citizenship to all Americans, in 1975 Con-
gresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also rep-
resented this historic 18th Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas, introduced, and the Congress 
adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and 
4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, which ex-
tended the protections of Section 4(a) and 
Section 5 to language minorities. During the 
floor debate on the 1975 reauthorization of the 
Voting Rights Act, Congresswoman Jordan ex-
plained why this reform was needed: 
‘‘There are Mexican-American people in the 
State of Texas who have been denied the 
right to vote; who have been impeded in their 
efforts to register and vote; who have not had 
encouragement from those election officials 
because they are brown people. 
‘‘So, the state of Texas, if we approve this 
measure, would be brought within the cov-
erage of this Act for the first time.’’ 
When it comes to extending and protecting 
the precious right to vote, the Lone Star State, 
the home state of Lyndon Johnson and Bar-
bara Jordan, can be the leading state in the 
Union, one that sets the example for the na-
tion. But to realize that future, we must turn 
from and not return to the dark days of the 
past. We must remain ever vigilant and op-
pose all schemes that will abridge or dilute the 
precious right to vote. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to remind the nation that the right 
to vote, that ‘‘powerful instrument that can 
break down the walls of injustice,’’ is facing 
grave threats. 
The threat stems from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. According to the 
Supreme Court majority, the reason for strik-
ing down Section 4(b) was that ‘‘times 
change.’’ Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. But what the Court did not fully ap-
preciate is that the positive changes it cited 
are due almost entirely to the existence and 
vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. 
And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still 
needed. Let me put it this way: in the same 
way that the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas 
Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects 
but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the 
Voting Rights Act succeeded in stymieing the 
practices that resulted in the wholesale dis-
enfranchisement of African Americans and 
language minorities but did eliminate them en-
tirely. 
The Voting Rights Act is needed as much 
today to prevent another epidemic of voting 
disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk’s vaccine is 
still needed to prevent another polio epidemic. 
However, officials in some states, notably 
Texas and North Carolina, seemed to regard 
the Shelby decision as a green light and

rushed to implement election laws, policies, 
and practices that could never pass muster 
under the Section 5 preclearance regime. My 
constituents remember very well the Voter ID 
law passed in Texas in 2011, which required 
every registered voter to present a valid gov-
ernment-issued photo ID on the day of polling 
in order to vote. The Justice Department 
blocked the law in March of 2012, and it was 
Section 5 that prohibited it from going into ef-
fect. At least it did until the Shelby decision, 
because on the very same day that Shelby 
was decided officials in Texas announced they 
would immediately implement the Photo ID 
law, and other election laws, policies, and 
practices that could never pass muster under 
the Section 5 preclearance regime. 
The Texas Photo ID law was challenged in 
federal court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Fifth Circuit upheld the decision of U.S. 
District Court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos 
that Texas’ strict voter identification law dis-
criminated against Blacks and Hispanics and 
violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
Madam Speaker, protecting voting rights and 
combating voter suppression schemes are two 
of the critical challenges facing our great de-
mocracy. Without safeguards to ensure that all 
citizens have equal access to the polls, more 
injustices are likely to occur and the voices of 
millions silenced. Those of us who cherish the 
right to vote justifiably are skeptical of Voter ID 
laws because we understand how these laws, 
like poll taxes and literacy tests, can be used 
to impede or negate the ability of seniors, ra-
cial and language minorities, and young peo-
ple to cast their votes. Consider the demo-
graphic groups who lack a government issued 
ID: 
African Americans: 25 percent; 
Asian Americans: 20 percent; 
Hispanic Americans: 19 percent; 
young people, aged 18 through 24: 18 per-
cent; 
persons with incomes less than $35,000: 15 
percent; 
And there are other ways abridging or sup-
pressing the right to vote, including: 
Curtailing or eliminating early voting; 
ending same-day registration; 
not counting provisional ballots cast in the 
wrong precinct on Election Day will not count; 
eliminating adolescent pre-registration; 
shortening poll hours. 
Lessening the standards governing voter 
challenges thus allowing self-proclaimed ‘‘bal-
lot security vigilantes’’ like the King Street Pa-
triots to cause trouble at the polls. 
Madam Speaker, on this day, the 56th anni-
versary of the landmark Voting Rights Act 
signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson 
on August 6, 1965, I call upon the leadership 
of Congress in both chambers to bring to a 
vote legislation intended to protect the right to 
vote of all Americans. 
Specifically, I call for the passage of H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, of which I am an original co-sponsor, 
which repairs the damage done to the Voting 
Rights Act by the Supreme Court’s Shelby de-
cision. This legislation provides even greater 
federal oversight of jurisdictions which have a 
history of voter suppression and protects vul-
nerable communities from discriminatory vot-
ing practices. Madam Speaker, before con-
cluding there is one other point I would like to 
stress. 
In his address to the nation before signing 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President John-
son said: 
‘‘Presidents and Congresses, laws and law-
suits can open the doors to the polling places 
and open the doors to the wondrous rewards 
which await the wise use of the ballot. 
‘‘But only the individual Negro, and all oth-
ers who have been denied the right to vote, 
can really walk through those doors, and can 
use that right, and can transform the vote into 
an instrument of justice and fulfilment.’’ 
In other words, political power, and the jus-
tice, opportunity, inclusion, and fulfillment it 
provides, comes not from the right to vote but 
in the exercise of that right. And that means 
it is the civic obligation of every citizen to both 
register and vote in every election, state and 
local as well as federal. Because if we can 
register and vote, but fail to do so, we are 
guilty of voluntary voter suppression, the most 
effective method of disenfranchisement ever 
devised. And in recent years, Americans have 
not been doing a very good job of exercising 
our civic responsibility to register, vote, and 
make their voices heard. 
Madam Speaker, for millions of Americans, 
the right to vote protected by the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the 
sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary 
Americans who showed the world it was pos-
sible to accomplish extraordinary things. So on 
this 56th anniversary of that landmark law, let 
us rededicate ourselves to honoring those who 
won for us this precious right by remaining 
vigilant and fighting against both the efforts of 
others to abridge or suppress the right to vote 
and our own apathy in exercising this sacred 
right.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
SERGEANT 
FIRST CLASS (RETIRED) JOSEPH 
FRENCHMAN KYLES 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor an extraordinary leader, 
soldier, veteran, and dedicated civil servant, 
SFC (Ret.) Joseph F. Kyles, who most re-
cently retired from an impressive career with 
the United States Postal Service spanning al-
most three decades. He was honored at a re-
tirement event on Saturday, August 7, 2021, 
at 6 p.m. at the Columbus Civic Center. 
Joseph Frenchman Kyles was born in 
Sampson, Alabama on July 26, 1950, to the 
union of Nathaniel and Corine Kyles as the 
oldest of seven children. He is the loving hus-
band of Minister Nila Kyles, the father of four 
children, and the grandfather of five grand-
children. 
In 1972, Joseph Kyles answered the call to 
serve his nation and joined the United States 
Army. During his distinguished 20-year career 
in the U.S. Army, he became a non-commis-
sioned officer retiring at the rank of Sergeant 
First Class. During his Army career, he served 
at Fort Benning in the Harmony Church area 
(specializing in Engineering, Weapon Night 
Firing, Leadership Training, and Tactical Train-
ing Maneuvers) and completed various over-
seas duties and assignments before retiring in 
1992. To further hone his skills, he attended 
Columbus Technical College to obtain a de-
gree in Engineering, Leadership, and Tactics 
Training. 
Following his retirement from the U.S. Army, 
SFC (Ret.) Kyles built quite an impressive 
public service career with the United States 
Postal Service (USPS), beginning in 1992, 
when he started as a mail clerk. Over the 
span of 29 years, he served in several other 
capacities with USPS including mail handler, 
mail carrier, and mail truck driver. 
Also, following his military service, he con-
tinued to serve his community and make an 
impact in the lives of others. His contributions 
include serving and financially supporting 
youth through Little League Football and Soft-
ball; Lonnie Jackson Academy Tutorial pro-
gram; South Columbus Coalition; South Co-
lumbus Exchange Club; Youth of the Year 
program; and The House Of Refuge Ministry 
with his wife and son, Darian Hall, who is the 
pastor. He has also served as mentor and fi-
nancial supporter for his fellow Veterans by 
assisting and transporting veterans to and 
from appointments, helping them acquire ben-
efits and receive medical supplies for life en-
durance following their military service. 
Douglas Adams once said that ‘‘To give real 
service you must add something which cannot 
be bought or measured with money, and that 
is sincerity and integrity.’’ SFC (Ret.) Joseph 
F. Kyles has demonstrated through his career 
and life, outstanding achievement, service, 
and public distinction. Our community, our 
state, and our nation are better because of 
him. In honor of his commendable accomplish-
ments and years of service, B.H. ‘‘Skip’’ Hen-
derson III, Mayor of Columbus, Georgia, 
signed a proclamation declaring August 7, 
2021 as ‘‘Joseph Frenchman Kyles Day’’. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along 
with the more than 730,000 residents of the 
Second Congressional District in honoring and 
commending SFC (Ret.) Joseph Frenchman 
Kyles for his outstanding service to his nation, 
community, and humankind as well as upon 
the occasion of his retirement from the United 
States Postal Service. We extend our best 
wishes to him as he begins a new chapter in 
his life.

HONORING THE BIG RED BARREL 
PROJECT 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the tenth anniversary of the Big Red 
Barrel Project, founded in Livingston County. 
On Good Friday in 2011, two local resi-
dents, Joe Carney and Terry Murray, struck 
up a conversation with then-Under Sheriff 
Mike Murphy. The three men were attending a 
biannual DEA drug takeback event and 
agreed that safe disposal of prescription drugs 
should happen every day—not just every two 
years. 
What began with that conversation turned 
into the original Big Red Barrel, a metal 
dropbox at the Michigan State Police Post in 
Brighton where folks could safely dispose of 
their unused medications. Today, there are 
more than 75 Big Red Barrels all over the 
state.

In addition to the permanent locations, 
sponsors have teamed up with the drain com-
missioner to host several events at local recy-
cling centers where residents can drop off 
needles in addition to prescription pills. 
In its first decade, the Big Red Barrel project 
has safely disposed of over 20 tons of unused 
medications. It’s lifesaving work, because as 
that number grows, it means more pills out of 
the wrong hands and out of municipal water 
systems. 
Michiganders don’t admire problems from 
afar—when they see something that needs fix-
ing, they go out and do it. For ten years, the 
Big Red Barrel Project has been a perfect ex-
ample of folks coming together for the com-
mon good. I’m proud to recognize it, and I 
wish this community project the best for the 
next 10 years to come.

IN HONOR OF JAMES STEWART 
MCFARLAND 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
a great American, James Stewart ‘‘Jim’’ 
McFarland. Mr. McFarland lives in North Mid-
dletown, Kentucky. He celebrates his 90th 
birthday on August 12th. 
Mr. McFarland served our nation in the 
United States Army in the 1950’s during the 
Korean Conflict. Following his military service, 
he returned to Bourbon County and worked in 
electronics repair. 
In 1959, Mr. McFarland began serving the 
people of North Middletown as a volunteer 
firefighter. He became chief of the North Mid-
dletown Volunteer Fire Department in 1971. 
As Chief, he was instrumental in acquiring 
funds for and overseeing the construction of 
the fire station that is still in use today in North 
Middletown. He also was a key resource in 
the formation of the Little Rock Volunteer Fire 
Department. Mr. McFarland conducted numer-
ous fire training classes both in Bourbon 
County and throughout Central Kentucky. Cur-
rently, Mr. McFarland serves as assistant fire 
chief for the North Middletown community. 
In addition to his 62 years of service with 
the Fire Department, Mr. McFarland has par-
ticipated in seven mission trips to Honduras 
where he used his carpentry skills on numer-
ous construction projects. He also serves 
North Middletown Christian Church as an 
elder, a deacon, and property committee chair. 
For all the ways that Mr. McFarland has 
served our nation and his community, he is to 
be commended and appreciated. It is my 
honor to recognize James Stewart McFarland 
on the occasion of his 90th birthday before the 
United States Congress.

OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF 
2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 
2021,’’ with Congressman DUSTY JOHNSON 
(R–SD). Our bipartisan legislation would better 
support American exporters by ensuring recip-
rocal trade to help reduce the United States’ 
longstanding trade imbalance export-driven 
countries like mainland China. 
This would be the first major overhaul of 
federal regulations for the global ocean ship-
ping industry time since Congress passed the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 (Public 
Law 105–258). There has since been consid-
erable consolidation amongst the ‘‘ foreign- 
based ocean carriers, coinciding with the con-
tinued decline of the U.S.-flagged international 
fleet. In late 2001, the People’s Republic of 
China was granted permanent normal trade 
relations with the United States, so-called 
‘‘most-favored nation’’ status, following the 
country’s admission to the World Trade Orga-
nization. 
Foreign businesses’ access to the American 
market and our consumers is a privilege, not 
a right. California’s agricultural exporters and 
other businesses are willing to pay to ensure 
that their products reach emerging markets in 
the Asia-Pacific. In turn, companies looking to 
offload foreign-made products at West Coast 
ports must provide opportunities for American 
exports. Congress must ensure reciprocity in 
trade with other countries to reduce the United 
States’ trade imbalance, particularly with 
cheap imports from Asia. Even during a global 
pandemic, trade must be mutually beneficial, 
and that is exactly what our bipartisan bill 
would ensure. 
On March 9, 2021, Congressman JOHNSON 
and I joined over 100 Members of Congress in 
a bipartisan letter urging the Federal Maritime 
Commission to crack down on anti-competi-
tive, unfair, and likely illegal business practices 
by some ocean carriers during the height of 
the pandemic in 2020. Dozens of agricultural 
exporters contacted my office reporting that 
ocean carriers simply refused to accept cargo 
bookings for U.S. exports, instead choosing to 
send cannisters empty back to the Asia-Pa-
cific, as quickly as possible. Outright refusing 
to take U.S. exports at seemingly any price is 
simply not an acceptable business practice by 
the ocean carriers. 
On June 15, 2021, Congressman JOHNSON 
and I announced our intention to pursue this 
legislation, at the Maritime Subcommittee’s 
hearing on the ‘‘Impacts of Shipping Container 
Shortages, Delays, and Increased Demand on 
the North American Supply Chain.’’ 
On July 20, 2021, the Federal Maritime 
Commission established a new audit program 
to assess ocean carriers’ compliance with fed-
eral regulations on detention and demurrage 
and increase the agency’s monitoring of the 
marketplace for ocean cargo services. This 
action underscores the need for our bipartisan 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members to co-
sponsor the ‘‘Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 
2021.’’ As a member of the House Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure, where I 
serve with Congressman JOHNSON, and the 
former ranking member of the Maritime Sub-
committee from the 113th to the 115th Con-
gresses, I plan to make this legislation a major 
priority. Specifically, I hope to include our bi-
partisan legislation in the maritime title of the 
next Coast Guard Authorization Act for fiscal 
years 2022 to 2023. 
CELEBRATING 
MEADVIEW 
VFW 
AUXILIARY 11014’S 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to wish the Meadview VFW Auxiliary a won-
derful 30th anniversary. The Meadview Auxil-
iary embodies the very best our country has to 
offer. Their work with Mt. Tipton Elementary 
school—particularly Constitution Day in Sep-
tember—teaches our future leaders to respect 
and engage with our great republic. We are in 
debt to your service. 
Their Resource and Stand-down fairs as-
sisted countless veterans and ensured our na-
tion’s finest have their voices heard in Con-
gress. Each and every one of the Auxiliary’s 
members and contributors are patriots; their 
collation of 100,000 poppies when disabled 
veterans were unable to meet proved as 
much. 
The United States is in short supply of men 
and 
women 
such 
as 
yourselves. 
The 
Meadview community and the people of Ari-
zona are blessed to have great Americans 
setting an example for generations to come. I 
am proud to be a friend of the Meadview VFW 
Auxiliary, and I look forward to continue fight-
ing for Veterans’ issues here in Washington.

SALINE COUNTY CAREER 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTER 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the opening of the Saline County 
Career Technical Education Center. 
I commend Saline County for uniting to pro-
vide overwhelming support for this new edu-
cational center. 
As the co-chair of the Congressional Skilled 
Workforce Caucus, I am excited to see Saline 
County invest in skilled workforce education. 
This educational center will teach students 
skills at a young age, so they may receive a 
head start in the technical field of their choos-
ing. This will allow these students to be career 
ready to enter the workforce after graduation. 
The current workforce shortage proves that 
there is no better time to invest in skilled work-
force education and America’s next genera-
tion. 
Thanks to many efforts in Arkansas, includ-
ing the new Saline County Career Technical 
Education Center, the future looks even bright-
er. My home state of Arkansas will continue to 
have bright, driven, hard-working, exception-
ally trained, and career ready students. 
The Saline County Career Technical Edu-
cation Center will serve as a new benchmark 
for Arkansas. I am humbled to witness the 
start of its inspiring future.

SMITH’S 
COL-
LEGE ON THEIR 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
Paul Smith’s College. 
Paul Smith’s College received its first class 
in 1946 on the grounds of the former Paul 
Smith’s Hotel, the Adirondacks’ first wilderness 
resort. Since then, Paul Smith’s College has 
graduated thousands of students from around 
the nation. Over the past 75 years, the college 
has expanded to include unique degree pro-
grams ranging from the natural sciences, to 
forestry, to culinary arts. Paul Smith’s degree 
programs offer students a wide variety of op-
portunities to prepare for their future career. 
The faculty and staff are dedicated to the suc-
cess of their students, with 90 percent finding 
employment or enrolling in graduate school 
within 6 months of graduating. Of the approxi-
mately 750 students, 46 percent the first in 
their family to go to college. These numbers 
speak to the impact that the college has had 
in the lives of students and the community. 
Paul Smith’s College has been a vital re-
source to the North Country and continues to 
serve the region well as it has the past 75 
years. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I 
would like to congratulate the students, fac-
ulty, staff, and leadership team at Paul Smith’s 
College on reaching this milestone. I look for-
ward to their continued success.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT COLO-
NEL PHILLIP JAMES DEVRIES II 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE 
WITH 
THE 
UNITED STATES ARMY 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Phillip 
James DeVries II for his three decades of 
service in the United States Army. Through his 
exceptional leadership and steadfast devotion, 
LTC DeVries has helped to strengthen our for-
eign diplomatic relations and ensure the safety 
and security of his fellow Americans. 
LTC DeVries started his military career 32 
years ago at West Point Military Academy, 
where he was awarded the rank of second 
lieutenant field artillery officer. Given his com-
prehensive military and strategic background, 
he also became a strategic plans and policies 
officer helping to modernize the U.S. military 
and better assist his fellow soldiers in the field. 
While in the Army, he served in numerous 
countries across the world and deployed four 
times to Afghanistan and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
In addition, DeVries recognized the impor-
tance of international diplomacy and relations 
during his service, which is why he constantly 
worked to strengthen alliances in the sur-
rounding communities. In pursuit of this, he at-
tended the NATO Defense College in Rome 
and was involved in many projects across 22 
different countries with hundreds of inter-
national officers. Phillip’s longtime devotion to 
our country is commendable, and the impact 
of his work on his fellow servicemembers and 
the people of the United States cannot be 
overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Lieutenant Colonel Phillip James DeVries II for 
his decades of service to the United States 
Army and his leadership that will inspire future 
generations. On behalf of my constituents, I 
wish LTC DeVries all the best in his future en-
deavors.

TRIBUTE HONORING THE WORK OF 
RAYNA LEHMAN 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 10, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the extraordinary work of Rayna Leh-
man, a champion of women and labor and a 
true patriot, who is retiring after serving with 
great distinction and effectiveness for 39 years 
as the community services director of the San 
Mateo County Labor Council. She will receive 
the well-deserved honor of the Cope Unity 
Award at the 41st Annual Cope Banquet to be 
held at the Hyatt Regency at San Francisco 
International Airport on August 13, 2021. 
Rayna was born in the Bronx, New York, to 
a working-class family. She was educated in 
public schools and was a day camp counselor, 
a salesperson, and a TSP telephone operator, 
before she came to California in 1970. 
The list of glass ceilings Rayna has broken 
began with the San Mateo County Union 
Community Alliance, and the list of the posi-
tions she has held that never had been held 
by a woman before is a long one. The honors 
she has earned include the San Mateo Labor 
Council Unity Award; PALCARE Outstanding 
Service Award; McCowan Takalo Anti-Hunger 
Advocacy Award; APALA Community Services 
Leadership Award; the UC Berkeley Labor 
Center Helping Hands Award; Menlo Park 
Hometown Hero; Senate District 13 2021 
Woman of the Year; the Hispanic Chamber 
Community Leader Award; and many more. 
She 
participated 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
PALCARE, was appointed to the San Mateo 
County Childcare Partnership Council, and 
represented Labor on the inaugural First Five 
Community Steering Committee. She created 
Health@Work and helped create the Commu-
nity Health Reform Advisory Committee to in-
troduce the Affordable Care Act to San Mateo 
County. 
As the community services director of the 
San Mateo County Central Labor Council, 
Rayna created the Union Hardship Fund, 
trained union counselors to assist local union 
members, and coordinated a partnership with 
Second Harvest Silicon Valley Food Bank to 
provide twice monthly food distributions that 
help more than 800 families. She’s a member 
of Office and Professional Employees Local 
29 and served as president of Painters Local 
15 for nine years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in thanking Rayna 
Lehman for her extraordinary work and in con-
gratulating her on being honored for her ex-
ceptional leadership as San Mateo County 
Central Labor Council’s community services 
director. The blessings of her work have 
touched thousands of families, and we are a 
better, stronger county and country because of 
her.
