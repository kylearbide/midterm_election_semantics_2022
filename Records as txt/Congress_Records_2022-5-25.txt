PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal redeemer, the Father of mer-
cies, You are our help in time of need. 
Lord, as we mourn the senseless trag-
edy at Robb Elementary School in 
Texas, guide us with Your grace. 
Lord, sometimes prayers seem so use-
less. Yet in 1 Thessalonians 5:17, You 
told us to pray without ceasing. We lift 
our voices again to You. We pray be-
cause You have helped us in the past. 
We pray because You are our hope for 
the years to come. Strengthen us to 
pray and work until justice rolls down 
like waters and righteousness like a 
mighty stream. 
Inspire our lawmakers to strive to 
become islands of mercy in the midst 
of a sea of indifference. Lord, use our 
Senators to build a more safe nation 
and world. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
there is a plague—a plague—upon this 
Nation, a plague of gun violence that 
has taken over this country. Two 
weeks ago, that plague claimed the 
lives of 10 Black Americans who were 
massacred in broad daylight while 
shopping at a grocery store in Buffalo. 
They were Black, and they were in a 
grocery store. That is the reason they 
were shot by an 18-year-old with an 
AR–15. 
And then, yesterday, just 10 days 
after Buffalo, that plague struck again 
in Uvalde, TX, where 19—19—innocent 
children and 2 teachers were gunned 
down at Robb Elementary in the mid-
dle of the school day, just before the 
start of summer when these kids were 
looking forward to having such a won-
derful time with their family and 
friends. 
Gone. They are gone. 
The shooter crashed his truck near 
the school, overpowered the police al-
ready at the scene, and reportedly 
began shooting inside a fourth grade 
classroom. Nineteen kids, two teach-
ers, forever gone in the blink of an eye. 
America’s 
gun 
epidemic 
is 
un-
matched by any of our peer nations in 
the world. No American is safe from it, 
and the American people are sick and 
tired of it. But we also have a prob-
lem—a big problem—here in the U.S. 
Senate—a big problem in the U.S. Sen-
ate. The problem in the Senate is sim-
ple: Too many Members on the other 
side of the aisle are disconnected from 
the suffering of the American people. 
Too many Members on that side care 
more about the NRA than they do 
about families who grieve victims of 
gun violence. 
As I said, the American people are 
sick and tired of mass shootings. They 
are sick and tired about active shooter 
alerts. They are sick and tired of chil-
dren—children: 
9-year-olds, 
10-year-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2676 
May 25, 2022 
olds, 11-year-olds—being shot, gunned 
down in their schools. 
When I read the news of yesterday’s 
shooting, I ached for the families and 
then thought: What if it was one of my 
children? I imagined what I would feel 
if this happened to one of them. The 
mere thought—just thinking about it— 
was a gut punch in my stomach. The 
fear sent ripples down my spine. 
To my Republican colleagues: Imag-
ine if it happened to you. Imagine if 
this was your kid or your grandkid. 
How would you feel? Could you ever 
forgive yourself for not supporting a 
simple law that would make these 
mass shootings less likely? 
Please, please, please—damn it—put 
yourself in the shoes of these parents 
for once. Maybe that thought, putting 
yourself in the shoes of these parents 
instead of in the arms of the NRA, 
might let you wriggle free from the 
viselike grip of the NRA, might free 
you to act on even a simple measure 
for the sake of these children—these 9- 
year-olds, these 10-year-olds, these 11- 
year-olds, 
these 
beautiful 
children. 
Please—damn it—think if it were your 
child or grandchild. 
Now, Madam President, it wasn’t al-
ways this way in Congress. Nearly 30 
years ago, I was proud to be the author 
of the Brady Bill and a leader of the as-
sault weapons bans. These were major 
legislative accomplishments, and they 
worked because they were good, com-
monsense laws, and they passed be-
cause both sides of the aisle worked to-
gether. And because they became law, 
tens of thousands—hundreds of thou-
sands, perhaps—of lives were saved: 
children, elderly people, people of 
color, you name it, people now walking 
the streets who might have been dead 
had we not passed these laws. But 
today the NRA has made it all but im-
possible for even the bare minimum to 
move forward in Congress, and the 
other side is all too ready to bow in 
obeisance to the NRA, in service of 
their whims. 
Madam President, these types of 
shootings used to be rare—so rare, in 
fact, that each occurrence stood apart 
as a singular event. But now these 
shootings happen so frequently that 
the Nation can barely keep up, barely 
mourn the 10 people shot in the grocery 
store in Buffalo before being rocked to 
our collective core by the slaughter of 
19 elementary schoolchildren in the 
predominantly Latino community of 
Uvalde, TX. 
These shootings happen everywhere: 
movie theaters, churches, synagogues, 
concerts, nightclubs, grocery stores, 
college campuses, high schools, ele-
mentary schools—elementary schools, 
with beautiful children getting ready 
to move out into the prime of life. 
Honestly, I thought Sandy Hook 10 
years ago would be the breaking point. 
I thought that that would be the trag-
edy that forced Republicans to examine 
their conscience and think: Oh, God, 
we can’t allow schoolchildren to be 
slaughtered. 
Well, I was wrong. The slaughter of 
20 elementary schoolchildren in Sandy 
Hook didn’t move them. We heard 
about their thoughts and their pray-
ers—but no action. Then came Aurora. 
And 
the 
Navy 
Yard. 
Then, 
after 
Charleston, I thought: Maybe this— 
maybe this is the moment. Nine Ameri-
cans shot in a church during Bible 
study? This has to move the Repub-
licans here in the Senate. 
Nope. It didn’t. They gave a few more 
thoughts, a few more prayers, no real 
effort to solve the problem. 
So, Madam President, it continued 
on and on and on: San Bernardino; Or-
lando; Las Vegas; Sutherland Springs; 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School; Thousand Oaks; the Pittsburgh 
synagogue; Santa Fe, TX; the El Paso 
Walmart; 
Dayton; 
Virginia 
Beach; 
Boulder; Buffalo; and now Uvalde. 
When will it end? We must act to 
have it end, not thoughts and prayers— 
action. 
After the shootings in El Paso and 
Dayton 3 years ago, the Republican 
leader promised that red flag laws and 
background checks would be front and 
center in a Senate debate. He was then 
majority leader, but then the Repub-
licans did nothing. They ensured there 
was no debate, just as they wanted. 
They don’t want to debate this issue. 
Indeed, all we hear from Republicans 
are thoughts, prayers. And now there is 
a new phrase. Now some of my Repub-
lican colleagues want to ‘‘lift up’’ the 
community. That sounds heartening, 
but it does absolutely nothing—noth-
ing—to prevent the next family from 
having to grieve their loss, and it won’t 
do a single damn thing to prevent an-
other life from being taken. It won’t do 
a single damn thing to prevent another 
child from being shot at school—a 9- 
year-old, a 10-year-old, an 11-year-old— 
beautiful children. 
Madam President, you may have no-
ticed that when they aren’t offering 
thoughts and prayers to distract from 
their inaction, many of my Republican 
colleagues focus on the motives of the 
shooters instead of focusing on the ob-
vious common denominator. They talk 
about the real villain being mental ill-
ness and say nothing of the fact that 
we are a nation suffocated by firearms. 
Rates of mental illness are more or less 
the same across the developed world. 
The United States is not an outlier on 
mental illness, but we are an outlier in 
the sheer number of guns available in 
this country. That is why we have so 
many shootings and other Western 
countries don’t. If mental illness were 
the simple cause, you would see mass 
shootings happening all over the devel-
oped world, but you don’t. 
What you do see here in America are 
enough 
guns 
to 
give 
every 
man, 
woman, and child in this Nation a fire-
arm and still have nearly 70 million 
guns left over. What you do see is that 
it is far too easy for people to access 
weapons in this country and then to 
use them to slaughter people, to 
slaughter children by the dozens—by 
the dozens. 
Again, America doesn’t stand out 
when it comes to the rate of mental ill-
ness, but we are unique among the 
world’s 
developed 
nations 
in 
that 
today, the leading cause of death 
among children is no longer a car acci-
dent; 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
illness 
or 
malnourishment. The leading cause of 
death among children is a firearm. The 
leading cause of death of children—do 
you hear that, my Republican col-
leagues?—is a firearm. 
Clearly, many of these shooters had 
different motives, but at the end of the 
day, does the motive really matter to 
the family with an empty seat at their 
dinner table? Children who lost parents 
don’t just care whether the shooter was 
mentally ill; they care that the shooter 
had ready access to a gun. Spouses who 
lost their partners don’t just care that 
the shooter had a grudge or an agenda 
or a grievance; they care that the 
shooter had ready access to a gun. 
Americans who lost friends and co-
workers and parishioners, who lost fel-
low worshippers don’t just care wheth-
er the shooter wrote a manifesto; they 
care that the shooter had ready access 
to a gun. They care that their loved 
ones had been taken from them by 
someone who had access to a gun— 
taken from them while some Members 
of this body refuse to do what it takes 
to prevent those losses, refuse to focus 
on the denominator to every single one 
of these shootings, refuse to even do 
the bare minimum as they bow in obei-
sance to the wretched NRA. 
What do we do about it? If the 
slaughter of schoolchildren can’t con-
vince the Republicans to buck the 
NRA, what can we do? There are some 
who want this body to quickly vote on 
sensible gun safety legislation—legisla-
tion supported by the vast majority of 
Americans, Democrats, Republicans, 
and Independents alike. They want to 
see this body vote quickly so the Amer-
ican people can know which side each 
Senator is on—which side each Senator 
is on. 
I am sympathetic to that, and I be-
lieve that accountability votes are im-
portant. But, sadly, this isn’t a case of 
the American people not knowing 
where 
their 
Senators 
stand. 
They 
know. They know because my Repub-
lican colleagues are perfectly clear on 
this issue, crystal clear. Republicans 
don’t pretend that they support sen-
sible gun safety legislation. They don’t 
pretend to be moved by the fact that 90 
percent of Americans, regardless of 
party, support something as common 
sense as background checks, that the 
vast majority of gun owners support 
the background checks bill. They don’t 
pretend that they want to keep guns 
out of the hands of those who might 
use weapons to shoot concertgoers or 
movie watchers or worshippers or shop-
pers or children. They don’t pretend at 
all. 
Just listen to them when they show 
up in obeisance to the NRA at the 
NRA’s 
convention 
in 
Houston—the 
same State as Uvalde—on Friday. They

will offer their thoughts and prayers. 
They will say they want to lift up the 
community. And then they will go 
back to their smoke-filled rooms and 
ensure the NRA and gun manufacturers 
that nothing will change, that they 
have the NRA’s back. 
No, Madam President, no, this isn’t a 
case of Republicans hiding their posi-
tion. They proudly tell the American 
people which side they are on, and 
America is much worse off for it. And 
if nothing does change, we are con-
demned to find ourselves right here 
once again very, very soon. 
As I was reading the reports of the 
tragedy in Texas, I saw that Amanda 
Gorman, the young woman who mes-
merized 
the 
Nation 
at 
President 
Biden’s inauguration, tweeted: 
The truth is, one nation under guns. 
‘‘One nation under guns.’’ That is 
simply 
heartbreaking—heart-
breaking—to think that this is the leg-
acy that older generations are leaving 
behind for young Americans: ‘‘one na-
tion under guns.’’ 
It doesn’t have to be that way. Our 
parents don’t need to drop their kids 
off at school and wonder if their kid 
will be next. That is in the thoughts of 
millions of moms and dads right now. 
Our citizens don’t have to endure the 
fear of getting groceries while con-
stantly keeping an eye behind their 
backs. Again, millions of Americans 
are worried about that right now. 
Americans can make a choice. Amer-
icans can reject the Republican ‘‘guns 
at all cost’’ doctrine, obeisance to the 
NRA, not even voting for the most sim-
ple, sensitive, positive, and popular gun 
legislation. Americans can cast their 
vote in November for Senators or Mem-
bers of Congress who reflect how he or 
she stands with guns, with this issue— 
this issue—at the top of the voters’ 
lists. 
In the meantime, my Republican col-
leagues can work with us now. I know 
this is a slim prospect—very slim, all 
too slim. We have been burned so many 
times before. But this is so important, 
and I have such a firm belief—taught 
to me by my late father, who passed 
away in November—that if you do the 
right thing and persist, justice will 
eventually prevail. But you have to 
keep persisting, and we will. 
For that reason alone, we must pur-
sue action and even ask Republicans 
again 
to 
join 
us—maybe, 
maybe, 
maybe. Unlikely. We have been burned 
in the past. But their hearts might see 
what is happening and join us and do 
the right thing. They know it is the 
right thing. They can work with us to 
craft legislation that would prevent 
needless loss of life. It is their choice. 
As majority leader, I haven’t been 
shy about putting bipartisan legisla-
tion on the floor for a vote, but bipar-
tisan means both parties must engage 
in crafting a bill, like what happened 
in the House and Senate 30 years ago 
with the Brady law and the assault 
weapons ban. 
Democrats have been trying to work 
hard with Republicans—Senator MUR-
PHY, Senator MANCHIN—on legislation 
that will eventually pass and become 
law. The other side has refused. There 
are so many options available to us, so 
many ideas. We just need some brave 
Republicans to stand before history 
and yell ‘‘stop,’’ to think, if it was your 
child, your grandchild, how you would 
feel. Would that move you to do some-
thing—something—about this plague of 
guns? 
Like my colleague Senator MURPHY, 
I refuse to believe that we cannot find 
a path forward. Make no mistake about 
it, if we can’t find a good, strong bill 
that has bipartisan support, we will 
continue to pursue this issue on our 
own. We have no choice. It is too im-
portant. Lives are at stake. 
I accept the fact that most of my Re-
publican colleagues are not willing to 
do what it takes to prevent this need-
less loss of life. The NRA will have a 
hold on them. That is just a reality, 
unfortunately. But it is unacceptable 
to the American people to think that 
there are not 10 of my Republican col-
leagues, just 10—1 out of 5 over here— 
who would be ready to work to pass 
something that would reduce this 
plague of gun violence. 
It is unacceptable that there are not 
10 Members of the Republican caucus 
willing to save lives, find a way to do 
it. Yet that is where we are. That is 
where we are. Another week, another 
American community devastated by a 
mass shooting. All of us thinking of 
these 9- and 10- and 11-year-old children 
just shot, gone. Another American 
community, Uvalde, which will never 
recover, like the other communities 
before it. Will it be yet—Uvalde—an-
other example of Republicans unwill-
ing to do what it takes to keep Ameri-
cans safe? 
I yield the floor.

MEASURES PLACED ON THE CAL-
ENDAR—H.R. 3807, H.R. 3967, H.R.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
understand there are five bills at the 
desk due for a second reading en bloc. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the titles of 
the bills for the second time. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3807) to amend the American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to increase appro-
priations to the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund, and for other purposes. 
A bill (H.R. 3967) to improve health care 
and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic 
substances, and for other purposes. 
A bill (H.R. 6833) to amend title XXVII of 
the Public Health Service Act, the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, and the Employee Re-
tirement Income Security Act of 1974 to es-
tablish requirements with respect to cost- 
sharing for certain insulin products, and for 
other purposes. 
A bill (H.R. 8) to require a background 
check for every firearm sale. 
A bill (H.R. 1446) to amend chapter 44 of 
title 18, United States Code, to strengthen 
the background check procedures to be fol-
lowed before a Federal firearms licensee may 
transfer a firearm to a person who is not 
such a licensee. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place 
these bills on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I would object 
to further proceeding en bloc.

ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
SHOOTING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our country is sickened and outraged 
by the senseless evil that struck Robb 
Elementary School in Uvalde, TX, only 
yesterday. According to early reports 
from authorities, it appears that a de-
ranged young man tried to murder his 
own grandmother, then crashed his car, 
and then ran into an elementary school 
and began killing. 
At least 19 young children and 2 
teachers were murdered—murdered— 
for no apparent reason at all. These in-
nocent kids were simply going to 
school. They put on their backpacks, 
said goodbye to their parents, and 
headed off for another day of learning 
and friendship. There were only 2 days 
left before summer break. And because 
of this maniac, at least 19 of these kids 
never made it home. 
One of the victims was a 10-year-old 
girl whose father described her as ‘‘full 
of life, a jokester, always smiling.’’ A 
10-year-old boy who loved sports and 
art had just received his honor roll cer-
tificate a few hours earlier. His mother 
says he was thrilled—thrilled—about 
moving up into middle school next 
year. 
It is literally sickening—sickening— 
to consider the innocent young lives 
that were stolen by this pointless, 
senseless brutality; to consider the par-
ents and families who sat waiting at 
the civic center, waiting to either be 
reunited with their son or their daugh-
ter or to learn they never would be. 
The investigation is still underway. 
The authorities will continue to learn 
exactly what happened and how. In the 
meantime, we are also praying for the 
Border Patrol officer who, according to 
reports, was wounded after he re-
sponded to the scene, and for all the 
law enforcement, paramedics, and first 
responders whose dedication yesterday 
saved lives. 
Most of all, the entire Nation’s 
hearts are broken for the victims and 
for their families. Words simply fail. 
Yesterday, the Uvalde school super-
intendent said: 
We’re a small community [and] we’re going 
to need your prayers to get us through this. 
We pray fervently that in the midst 
of this nightmare of grief, our Heav-
enly Father will make manifest to

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Sandra L. Thompson, of Maryland, to 
be Director of the Federal Housing Fi-
nance Agency for a term of five years. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
just had heard the minority leader say 
he was sickened by what happened in 
Uvalde. 
Tomorrow, we have a bill coming to 
the floor that addressed the last shoot-
ing, the one in Buffalo. Will he join us 
in allowing a debate and amendments 
to that bill that will address the gun 
plague in America? 
Thoughts 
and 
prayers 
are 
not 
enough. We need action. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
had 
originally, 
before 
yesterday, 
planned to speak today at length about 
the fact that in 36 days children across 
the country are going to lose healthy 
meals they have been getting in the 
summer, as well as meals during the 
school year, and schools are going to be 
put in a very difficult situation—up to 
one-third of the schools may not be 
able to offer school meals at all. 
So that was my intent in coming to 
the floor, but after what happened, the 
horrible situation in Texas, 19 more 
children, a teacher, a grandma dying, 
now I wonder if it is how many more 
kids will be killed in the next 36 days. 
We don’t have to live like this. We 
don’t have to live like this where we 
are begging for 8 more Republicans to 
join us, 52 of us, who want to make 
sure kids get healthy meals. We don’t 
have to live like that, and we don’t 
have to live in a situation where par-
ents are afraid—where people are afraid 
to go to their place of worship or they 
are afraid to go to the grocery store, 
where they are afraid to just live be-
cause of some random shooting by 
somebody who got a hold of a—of a 
gun, a military assault weapon or 
didn’t have to go through a background 
check and went to a gun show or what-
ever it is, whatever it is that is causing 
the carnage in our country related to 
guns and mass shootings. 
It is not happening in other coun-
tries—it is not happening in other 
countries, and they have as many chal-
lenges as we do. But in other countries, 
that may be somebody going into 
school with a knife and the kids get 
hurt, but they live. Here, it is assault 
weapons. It is shooting children indis-
criminately in an elementary school. 
We don’t have to live like this. We 
don’t have to live like this. 
The question is, how many Repub-
licans would join us to save children’s 
lives from gun violence? How many? 
Can we just get started? You know, 
Leader SCHUMER has put two bills on 
the calendar related to background 
checks: 
the 
bipartisan 
Background 
Checks Act—closing the gun show loop-
hole, requiring background checks for 
gun purchases made through private 
unlicensed dealers—and the Enhanced 
Background Checks Act, which would 
provide a national background check 
system, enough time to thoroughly re-
view gun sales. 
Now, these are not controversial. 
Neither is feeding children by the way. 
These are not controversial. Ninety 
percent of the public says, duh, of 
course, of course. 
Now, the folks that don’t want us to 
do it are the folks that make the guns. 
They make a lot of money. They are 
trying to pit us against each other. 
They put out all kinds of crazy theo-
ries. They are funding our Republican 
colleagues to stop anything from hap-
pening because, God forbid, if the prof-
its of the gun manufacturers would go 
down because maybe there were a few 
less guns that were on the street. 
This is not rocket science. We know 
what to do. I grew up in a northern 
Michigan community surrounded by 
legal gun ownership—my own family, 
my friends, my relatives. You know 
when the assault weapon ban went in 
for 10 years, nobody in my family 
stopped hunting. Nobody in my family 
had to say, oh, well, we can’t do what 
we want to do because military assault 
weapons aren’t available. 
That was put in by Democrats. It was 
then repealed by Republicans. And we 
saw violence—violent shootings that 
had gone down tremendously, suddenly 
go up. So there is a lot of different 
things that we could do. And the ques-
tion is, will we come together on any of 
them? Will we start with comprehen-
sive background checks? That is the 
question. 
Will we have Republicans joining us? 
Every action we take—or inaction—re-
lates to our values, and it relates to 
our will to do it. 
We can do anything if we want to do 
it. I mean, last week we came together 
on this floor to address baby formula 
for the WIC program, and we did it to-
gether. It was great. One of the fastest 
things I have ever seen move through 
here, and I appreciate that. I appre-
ciate Senator BOOZMAN joining me in 
that. 
But why can’t we then extend that, 
first of all, to making sure in the sum-
mer, kids get healthy food that they 
are going to start losing in 36 days and 
that during the school year we are sup-
porting our schools to provide healthy 
meals for all of our children in a time 
of supply chain breakdowns, costs 
going up. 
And what happens when we start 
hearing in the fall from those schools 
that have to stop all school meals be-
cause somehow we couldn’t come to-
gether and prioritize feeding children? 
And on top of that—I mean, I hate to 
say feeding children is, you know—all 
of this is important, but their lives—we 
can’t even come together around basic 
commonsense measures that will begin 
to address what is happening with the 
random shootings and the killings of 
our babies, of our children. We can do 
better than this. We have to do better 
than this. We have to do better than 
this. 
We only need 10 Republicans—we 
need 8 Republicans to help us feed 
healthy kids in the summer and on 
into the—give kids healthy meals this 
summer and in the fall, 8. We only need 
10, we only need 10 Republicans to join 
us on background checks, closing the 
gun show loophole. 
We don’t need everybody. We don’t 
need everybody. Some folks can go run 
and stand with the gun manufacturers 
and what has become incredibly ex-
treme NRA dangerous positions. 
Folks, we just need 10—10 people to 
stand up and go: This is too much. This 
has gone too far. We can do better than 
this. 
Because if not now, what is the num-
ber? I would like to ask Leader MCCON-
NELL, what is the number? 
How many children will he describe 
and how much sympathy will he show 
for dead children on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate before it is enough? How 
many? One hundred more? Two hun-
dred more? A thousand more? When is 
it enough, when too many children 
have been killed? When is it enough? 
It is past enough right now. We can 
do better than this for our kids, and I 
hope this is the moment that Repub-
licans in the U.S. Senate will step up 
and join us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2680 
May 25, 2022 
yet again—and not just another trag-
edy. In this case, the death of the 19 
children and 2 adults, at least that is 
the latest reporting, but also indi-
cating that the deaths took place be-
cause an armed gunman came into a 
school with body armor protecting him 
from the response from any law en-
forcement. 
So we have another example, in bare-
ly less than a week, where a gunman 
goes into a setting in a grocery store in 
Buffalo, NY, and now into a school 
where second graders, third graders, 
and fourth graders are killed because 
he has a high-powered weapon, and he 
is fully protected from any law enforce-
ment or any other response. And we are 
supposed to just get used to this, I 
guess. That seems to be the response 
here in Washington. 
Now, this isn’t a problem of Con-
gress, more broadly, or the executive 
branch of our government. This is a 
problem—the failure to address this 
problem, even to pass something as 
simple as background check legisla-
tion—this is a problem in the Senate of 
one side. You have got 50 U.S. Senators 
who are Republicans who have refused 
now for years to pass anything re-
motely resembling commonsense gun 
measures. 
I would support a whole series of bills 
that we could talk about. We don’t 
have time today. But at least the U.S. 
Senate should be able to pass a back-
ground check bill supported by 90 per-
cent of the American people. 
And you have to ask, why is that? 
And it is not simply that you have so 
many Republicans who are beholden to 
the gun lobby. That is obvious. That is 
right in front of us. 
The other problem is—and I think it 
is related to the question of the power 
of the gun lobby in one party—you 
have got a whole party that seems to 
want to surrender to this problem, to 
throw up their hands and say: ‘‘There 
is nothing the most powerful Nation in 
the world can do, nothing at all the 
most powerful nation in the world can 
do to stop the killing, over and over 
again, of Americans,’’ and especially in 
the context of the horror—the un-
speakable horror—yesterday of second, 
third, and fourth graders being gunned 
down in a manner that is so horrific 
that some of them can’t be identified 
because of the power of the weapon and 
the number of bullets that can be dis-
charged in a matter of seconds. So even 
if law enforcement gets there and isn’t 
confronting body armor, no law en-
forcement is fast enough to get to a 
scene in seconds to prevent a horrific 
mass shooting. 
So we are supposed to accept the 
fact, as Americans—I guess this is 
what the Republican position is—that 
we should surrender to this problem. 
The most powerful Nation in the world 
can’t stop second, third, and fourth 
graders 
from 
being 
murdered 
in 
schools. The most powerful country in 
the world, I guess, can’t prevent the 
shooting we saw in Buffalo. And you 
can go down the list of other tragedies. 
This is a uniquely American problem. 
No other country that is similarly situ-
ated—has an economy like ours as a 
country even close to what we have— 
no other country has this problem and 
has any kind of change or reform or ac-
tion being blocked by one side. And I 
know there is work that has to be done 
at the State legislative level and all 
that. 
But right here, we could vote this 
week on a background check bill, and 
it would be supported overwhelmingly. 
But think about this, and I will end 
with this. Think about if we had the 
same attitude about 9/11. What if some-
one said right after 9/11: ‘‘You know 
what, there is really nothing we can do 
as Americans to stop a foreign ter-
rorist from taking an airplane into a 
building or crashing an airplane into 
the Pentagon or the plane that went 
down in Pennsylvania. There is noth-
ing we can do about that so we just 
have to get used to that reality of ter-
rorists doing that to our country’’? No 
one would say that—then or now. We 
created an entire new Agency, the De-
partment of Homeland Security. And 
guess what, a lot of those reforms that 
we made to protect Americans against 
terrorism worked. Just like no one said 
years ago, when we had these viruses 
and the potential of pandemics, that 
we shouldn’t do anything about it even 
though we have the knowledge and the 
skill to create a vaccine. 
We invested. We did what Americans 
do—confronted a big problem and did 
something about it. 
What if during World War II, what if 
everyone stood up and said: ‘‘You 
know, the Axis nations are pretty pow-
erful. Those nations are pretty power-
ful. They have the most well-funded, 
sophisticated armies in the world, and 
there is nothing we can do in 1941 to 
take on the Axis powers’’? We didn’t 
say that. 
It is un-American to surrender—to 
surrender to a problem. Now you have 
an entire political party in this Cham-
ber that has not just surrendered to the 
lobby—that is objectionable and insult-
ing enough—but they surrendered to 
the problem; that there is nothing we 
can do about it. That, I would submit, 
is un-American. And it is about time 
that the Republicans in the Senate 
begin to be part of the solution to do 
something that Americans do all the 
time—confronting evil, like we did 
after 9/11; confronting terrorism or dis-
ease or whatever it is; and in this case 
to confront gun violence and do some-
thing about it, not sit around and pre-
tend that there is nothing we can do. 
That is un-American. 
We don’t surrender. We are Ameri-
cans. We take on tough problems like 
our entire history has shown. But we 
haven’t taken on this problem. 
What we should be saying to these 
families, in addition to offering our 
sympathy, is: Your government has 
failed you. Your government at the 
Federal level and your government at 
the State level, it has failed you. And 
in this case and in this Chamber it has 
failed because one side will not even 
entertain the idea of passing any gun 
measures. They have surrendered. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF SANDRA L. THOMPSON 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I urge 
my 
colleagues 
to 
support 
Sandra 
Thompson’s historic nomination to be 
the Director of the Federal Housing Fi-
nance Agency. 
Ms. Thompson is an exceptional 
nominee, with decades of experience in 
mortgage markets and Federal finan-
cial regulation. 
Since 
June 
2021, 
Ms. 
Thompson 
served as Acting Director at FHFA, 
where she has played a vital role in 
promoting access to mortgage credit, 
to overseeing and supervising Fannie 
Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal 
Home Loan Banks, and to protecting 
the safety and soundness of the hous-
ing finance system. 
Before being designated as Acting Di-
rector, Ms. Thompson served for 8 
years as a Deputy Director for the Di-
vision of Mission and Goals at FHFA, 
so she is clearly very qualified. 
She spent 18 years at the Federal De-
posit 
Insurance 
Corporation. 
While 
there, she worked for seven different 
chairpersons, obviously, from both po-
litical parties and in senior-level posi-
tions. 
She will be the first woman. She will, 
notably, be the first Black woman con-
firmed to lead FHFA. 
For the first time, we have an admin-
istration and a Senate Banking and 
Housing Committee that understand 
how important it is to have economic 
leaders who reflect the country, who 
look like the country and think like 
the country—people who make it work. 
She will join a growing list of experi-
enced, talented Black women who have 
come through our committee—MARCIA 
FUDGE, who was my Congresswoman in 
Cleveland. She is now Secretary of 
HUD; Cecilia Rouse, Chair of the Coun-
cil on Economic Advisers at the White 
House; Reta Jo Lewis, a CEO of the Ex-
port-Import Bank; Lisa Cook, first 
Black woman ever in 109 years—109 
years, the first Black woman—at the 
Federal 
Reserve; 
Alanna 
McCargo; 
Alexia Latortue, just to name a few. 
Ms. Thompson has proven she will 
work and she will listen to lenders, and 
consumers, and both sides of the aisle. 
Before the pandemic, housing was too 
expensive and too hard to find, even be-
fore the pandemic. Whether you are 
looking to rent or to buy, FHFA has an 
important role to play in bringing

down housing costs and empowering 
more families to be able to afford a 
safe and stable home. 
I strongly urge my colleagues in sup-
porting Ms. Thompson’s nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The senior Senator from 
Iowa. 
PESTICIDES 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
farmers across Iowa are finishing their 
planting of corn and soybeans. As for 
the Grassley farm, Robin and Pat 
Grassley finished planting last Thurs-
day. 
Most people have never stepped foot 
on a family farm, let alone know all 
about the complexities that go into 
planting, growing, and harvesting a 
bountiful crop. That is why I often use 
my social media to show my followers 
what is going on in farming—hashtag 
‘‘corn 
watch,’’ 
hashtag 
‘‘soybean 
watch.’’ I like to show how only 2 per-
cent of the population raises food for 
the other 98 percent, plus exporting 
one-third of our production to feed peo-
ple overseas. Food doesn’t just magi-
cally appear on grocery store shelves. 
When so few people know what it 
takes to produce food, we often run 
into obstacles at policymaking tables 
here in Congress and around Wash-
ington, DC. I often quote something 
Dwight Eisenhower said, and he said it 
best: 
Farming looks mighty easy when your 
plow is a pencil, and you’re a thousand miles 
from the corn field. 
There has never been a more impor-
tant time than right now for farmers 
to have a successful year. We are facing 
a world threatened by food shortages 
and food insecurity the likes of which 
we haven’t seen since the Arab Spring 
a decade ago, in large part today be-
cause of Putin’s unprovoked invasion 
of Ukraine. 
The productivity of the American 
farmers and ranchers this crop season 
will have a big impact on the security 
and prosperity of countries around the 
world, as well as to make sure we don’t 
get into a devastating shortage of food. 
With so much at stake, Washington, 
DC, must provide farmers across the 
country a consistent policy when it 
comes to regulation of inputs and crop 
protection products. One State out of 
fifty can’t go another direction with-
out bringing harm to food production. 
When it comes to the regulation of 
these products, public policy must be 
based on the best science available to 
make 
informed 
decisions. 
Science- 
based decisions shouldn’t surprise any-
body in this town because science was 
the Golden Rule in every coronavirus 
decision made in the Trump adminis-
tration and still being made in the 
Biden administration. 
The best science is why Congress en-
acted, in 1972, the regulation that goes 
by the title of the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act or 
FIFRA for short. Since 1972, FIFRA has 
expressly preempted State law, vested 
the EPA with final authority over pes-
ticide labeling and the usage of that 
pesticide. Specifically, FIFRA gave the 
EPA authority over pesticide labeling 
and the usage of that pesticide. Under 
FIFRA, it is the EPA’s responsibility 
to undertake very extensive scientific 
review of regulated products and then 
determine what disclosures, if any, 
must be on the product labels. FIFRA 
provides that EPA conduct studies to 
determine product safety. 
Congress intended that there be a 
Federal regulatory regime that would 
impose warnings, impose disclosures, 
and impose restrictions on the use of 
products under FIFRA. Congress made 
it very clear that Congress wanted 
science-based certainty and predict-
ability for farmers and the resulting 
benefit that is to the farm entire econ-
omy. 
Unfortunately, we have seen politi-
cally 
motivated 
environmentalists 
pushing for restrictions on regulated 
products that the EPA has determined 
are not necessary. This fundamentally 
undermines trust in the EPA and trust 
in Federal regulation of these products 
used in farming. 
Make no doubt about my stand or 
anybody’s stand here in the U.S. Sen-
ate, we all strongly support thorough 
vetting of regulated products to ensure 
public safety. However, I strongly sup-
port ensuring Iowa farmers have the 
supplies they need to feed families 
across America. 
I hope President Biden would agree 
with me. His administration should be 
putting forward policies and taking po-
sitions that protect public safety, 
while ensuring farmers can produce the 
food that we need here in America and 
that we are able to supply one-third of 
our production for overseas. As we look 
at the world with a growing shortage of 
food—as I emphasized, partly because 
of what is going on in Ukraine—we 
must then ask ourselves what more we 
can be doing to support farmers. 
Unfortunately, some recent decisions 
just made by this administration do 
just exactly the opposite. I said ‘‘just 
made by this administration’’ because 
2 weeks ago, President Biden’s Solic-
itor General filed a brief in a case in-
volving widely used pesticides. In that 
brief, the Solicitor General flipped the 
government’s long-held position that 
FIFRA preempts State law and instead 
argued against EPA’s authority. So it 
looks to me like politics overcomes 
science. 
You would think such a significant 
change would be firmly based on the 
law and science, just as I said. How-
ever, the Solicitor General explained 
this astounding change wasn’t based on 
science because it was based on poli-
tics. Perhaps that is why the EPA gen-
eral counsel’s name doesn’t appear on 
the brief. 
I heard from many constituents 
about how serious of an impact the po-
sition taken by Biden’s Solicitor Gen-
eral would have on the farming indus-
try at-large. If the Court, meaning the 
Supreme Court, effectively adopts the 
Solicitor General’s position and that of 
the lower court decision, it will fun-
damentally disrupt the Federal regula-
tion of use and of warnings under 
FIFRA related to substances such as 
these that farmers rely on every day in 
production agriculture. 
It is clear that it wasn’t the intent of 
Congress when it enacted FIFRA for 
there to be 50 State standards in addi-
tion to Federal standards because we 
all know the purpose of FIFRA was to 
create a uniform regime with authority 
vested in the EPA to set such stand-
ards, and that has never been ques-
tioned until now. 
It is shocking that President Biden 
chose to put forward an argument that 
undermines the public trust in the EPA 
by putting politics ahead of the long-
standing and consistent EPA regula-
tion that enables farmers to grow the 
food that we and the world need. This 
abrupt change in the administration’s 
position will have serious implications 
for the farm economy and our food sup-
ply. 
Again, there needs to be a consistent 
regulatory 
regime 
to 
ensure 
the 
public’s trust and to support U.S. agri-
culture so farmers can produce food, 
again, I say, that the Nation needs and 
the world needs. 
So I hope the Solicitor General re-
verses her position, and even if she 
doesn’t reverse her position, I hope the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
will be willing to hear this case. 
I want to now quote Dr. Norman 
Borlaug, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
I think, in 1970. This winner was born 
and raised in Iowa: 
If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but 
at the same time cultivate the fields to 
produce more bread; otherwise there will be 
no peace. 
I think what he is referring to there 
is—at least what I believe and I have 
heard—that societies are only nine 
meals away from revolution. In other 
words, if you are a father and a mother 
and you can’t feed your kids for 3 days, 
you will go to almost any end to make 
sure they get the food. So if you want 
social cohesion in America and around 
the world, we have to have enough food 
to feed our people. 
I yield the floor.

ior Senator from Delaware. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, like a 
lot of other Americans, I didn’t sleep 
much last night, didn’t sleep much at 
all. I couldn’t shake the overwhelming 
feeling of sorrow that I felt for the 
community of Uvalde, TX. Nineteen in-
nocent children, fourth graders, were 
gunned down in their classroom 3 days 
before summer break—3 days. Two 
teachers were murdered as well. Count-
less children witnessed their class-
mates and teachers shot and killed as 
they climbed through windows to try 
to escape the massacre. Twenty-one 
families are living every parents’ worst 
nightmare—the loss of a child. Instead

May 25, 2022 
of planning their summer vacations, 
those families are now planning their 
children’s funerals. Their nightmare is 
our national nightmare. 
Though my own boys are now grown 
adults, I can’t help but think when my 
wife and I used to help them with their 
homework and tuck them into bed at 
night. I can’t help but think of when 
they were the same age of the 19 ele-
mentary children gunned down at their 
school yesterday. Like millions of 
American parents across our country, 
my wife and I are brokenhearted today. 
Millions of Americans dropped their 
children off at school this morning, and 
my guess is they probably hugged them 
extra tightly. They said goodbye and 
watched those kids walk into school. 
And they left to hope and pray today 
that their children will be there, alive, 
at pickup at the end of the day or that 
they will be on the bus ride coming 
home at night. They are left to hope 
and pray that they never get the shat-
tering call that those families in 
Uvalde received yesterday. 
We are the only country in the world 
where parents have to hope and pray 
that their children will not be mur-
dered at school by a gunman. We are 
the only country in the world where a 
fourth grade classroom can be turned 
into a battlefield by a madman with an 
assault weapon. 
This has to stop. We can’t go on this 
way. We are mourning this tragedy, 
and I refuse to accept inaction. I refuse 
to accept that the mass slaughter of 
children in their fourth grade class-
room is somehow normal. This has to 
stop. We can’t go on this way. 
For as long as I have been in this 
Chamber—that is some 21 years—we 
have been failing to address the epi-
demic of gun violence in this country. 
This has to stop. We can’t go on this 
way. I refuse to believe that Congress 
can’t reform our gun laws in a way 
that the American public broadly sup-
port. I refuse to believe that changing 
our laws won’t reduce gun violence and 
make these tragedies less likely from 
recurring in the future. 
We are long overdue to make com-
monsense reforms to our Nation’s gun 
laws. To put it bluntly, this is not 
going to be easy. I know it. I think we 
all realize that. 
Many of our friends in this Chamber 
revere the Second Amendment and re-
spect the tradition of lawful gun own-
ership in this country. I myself am a 
gun owner and have been one since I 
was 12 years old when I bought my first 
BB gun. However, the Second Amend-
ment does not give us the right to mur-
der children at school or gun down wor-
shippers at church or kill African 
Americans at a grocery store. 
In our Declaration of Independence, 
Thomas Jefferson wrote these words 
that we all remember. He wrote: 
All men [and women] are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable Rights, that among 
these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of 
Happiness. 
These 19 children were denied the 
right to life, to liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness. 
So in Uvalde, there is no little league 
game this weekend. There is no fifth 
grade next year. They will never get to 
be teenagers, go to the prom, graduate, 
go on to college, have a career, or have 
children of their own, and, if lucky, 
maybe grandchildren someday. Their 
lives were stolen from them by a gun-
man; and, tragically, we can never 
bring them back. 
What we can do though—what we can 
do though—is to try hard, really hard 
to prevent this from ever happening 
again. 
We need to be able to say to the 
American people: We have had enough. 
This has to stop. We can’t go on this 
way. We won’t go on this way. 
Today, we are a nation in mourning. 
We also need to be a nation working to-
gether to address this epidemic, work-
ing to reform our gun laws, and doing 
whatever it takes to prevent another 
massacre in an American school, in a 
place of worship, or in a grocery store. 
May God bless the community of 
Uvalde. May the Lord be with those 21 
families 
during 
this 
time 
of 
unfathomable heartache and anguish. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Wisconsin. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 111 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, 
today America grieves. There is noth-
ing partisan about being a parent and 
grandparent. I cannot imagine—I can-
not imagine—the grief felt by the par-
ents of those children. Unless you have 
experienced it, none of us can. 
What is the solution? There is no one 
solution. Let’s be honest about that. 
Following Sandy Hook, following Park-
land, I met with the parents of those 
horrific and senseless tragedies. I have 
been blessed to get to know three par-
ents quite well: Tom and Gina Hoyer, 
and Max Schachter. Tom and Gina are 
the parents of Luke Hoyer; Max is the 
father of Alex Schachter—two of the 17 
victims 
of 
the 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School 
slaughter 
in 
Parkland, FL, that occurred on Feb-
ruary 14, 2018. 
In getting to know Tom and Gina and 
Max, you get some sense of the level of 
grief. I mentioned there is nothing par-
tisan about grief. I listened to Presi-
dent Biden’s remarks last night, I 
think the point he made that pierced 
my heart, because President Biden has 
known tragedy, is when he said that 
those parents in Texas, they are asking 
themselves will they ever sleep again. 
So we all grieve. We are all looking 
for solutions. The good Senator from 
Delaware said: ‘‘We must take action.’’ 
So what I have always valued about 
Tom and Gina and Max is these are 
three individuals, parents who do know 
the pain, that still grieve the loss of 
their sons, and yet they have not ap-
proached trying to find solutions in 
any partisan way whatsoever. They are 
trying to find areas of agreement. 
They advised the Federal Commis-
sion on School Safety. They came up 
with a pretty commonsense action. It 
may not solve all the problems, but it 
is a good idea. It is such a good idea 
that as chairman of the committee— 
Subcommittee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs, we codified 
it, we passed it unanimously out of our 
committee in November of 2019. It is 
called the Luke and Alex School Safety 
Act. It is pretty simple. It just creates 
a clearinghouse of information of the 
best practices for school safety. 
It involves numerous Departments— 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, Justice, Homeland Security. 
All must approve what these best prac-
tices are. It ensures the parents, teach-
ers, school officials, other stakeholders 
have input into what those best prac-
tices are. It doesn’t allow the clearing-
house to mandate any school take any 
certain action. 
And maybe, most importantly, it 
publishes the available grant programs 
and Federal resources available for 
school safety. Again, it passed out of 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs twice, unani-
mously, once under my chairmanship, 
once under the chairmanship of Sen-
ator PETERS. There is nothing partisan 
about this bill whatsoever. It is just a 
good idea that can save lives. 
It was such a good idea that under 
the previous administration, they set 
up that clearinghouse. It is up and it is 
operating. So all this bill does at this 
point is serve as a model for what is 
happening. All this bill does now is 
codify it, to make sure this clearing-
house stands the test of time, that it 
will always be there to provide those 
best practices on school safety. 
Now, I am very sensitive to the mo-
ment in time we are sitting here right 
now. We should let the Nation and 
those parents grieve. I don’t want to 
politicize anything about this moment. 
So I called up Max, I called up Tom 
and Gina and asked them what would 
you like me to do? They have been try-
ing to get this codified, passed into law 
for 4 years. I can’t explain why it is not 
law. Just last month, the Senate 
passed the Pray Safe Act, which was 
basically it took that bill, the Luke 
and Alex School Safety Act and just 
applied it to churches. That passed by 
unanimous consent—no objection. 
I tried to attach this bill to that bill, 
but for whatever reason, somebody is 
objecting. I have no idea why. None. 
Again, 
it 
passed 
our 
committee 
unanimously twice. It is a good idea. It 
could save lives. It is an action when 
people are calling for action following 
this tragedy. 
So I know I see the Senator from 
Florida that would also like to speak 
to this bill before I ask consent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. When I heard 
the horrific news from Uvalde, TX, yes-
terday, I immediately thought of two 
things, my grandchildren, most of

whom are in elementary school, and 
the 17 lives we lost in Parkland, FL, 4 
years ago. Our hearts are shattered at 
the loss of these small children—19 
children that are just in fourth grade 
and two teachers. It is infuriating and 
heart-wrenching. 
I can’t imagine losing a child or a 
loved one. Unfortunately, there are 17 
families in Florida who don’t have to 
imagine it. They know that pain and 
live it each and every day. There is sel-
dom a day that goes by that I don’t 
think about the families that lost their 
children and loved ones that day. No 
community should feel the pain that 
families in Parkland and Uvalde now 
feel. We will never be able to prevent 
every vicious crime, but we can and 
must act. 
There are solutions to be found at 
the State level and the Federal level, 
and today, we can take action in the 
Senate to make our schools safer. 
I want to thank Senator JOHNSON for 
leading this bill and Senators RUBIO, 
RISCH, and GRASSLEY for their strong 
support of this legislation and other ef-
forts to keep our kids safe. 
This bill, the Luke and Alex School 
Safety Act was named in honor of Luke 
Hoyer and Alex Schachter. Luke and 
Alex were taken from us in the shoot-
ing at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High 
School on February 14, 2018, in Park-
land, FL. 
Since that horrible day, I have 
worked closely with many of the vic-
tims’ families as Governor and now as 
Senator to do everything possible so 
that no child, educator, or family has 
to experience that again. 
There is clearly a lot more work to 
do. This legislation, the Luke and Alex 
School Safety Act, codifies a Federal 
school safety clearinghouse by inform-
ing parents and educators on expert 
recommendations and best practices 
that schools can implement to improve 
school security. This bill builds on our 
work to keep schools safe and prevent 
another tragedy. 
Today, we can get something done 
that creates safer schools for our kids 
and our teachers. I appreciate the work 
again of Senators JOHNSON, RUBIO, 
RISCH, and GRASSLEY and all of our col-
leagues. 
As we continue to pray for Uvalde 
and the families that have suffered this 
tremendous loss, I urge the Senate to 
pass this good bill and take a step in 
the right direction that keeps our kids 
and teachers safe. 
Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator 
from Florida for those comments. 
I just want to again emphasize the 
fact that I just spoke with Max and 
Gina and Tom. These are parents of 
children who lost their lives in a school 
shooting. These are parents that have 
come up with a solution—a non-
partisan solution—got it recommended 
by the Federal Commission on School 
Safety. 
They told me that the day after 
Parkland, had a parent from Sandy 
Hook had a piece of legislation that 
they had been trying to get passed but 
couldn’t, it would help. They would 
have been 100 percent supportive of 
that piece of legislation, come to the 
floor, and pass it by unanimous con-
sent, irrespective of the timing. 
They asked me to come to the floor 
today to ask my colleagues to lay aside 
partisanship, to do something for these 
families, provide them some measure 
of comfort by passing a completely 
nonpartisan bill that could make a dif-
ference, that could save a life. There is 
no reason not to pass this bill today in 
this Chamber at this hour. 
So, as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 102, S. 111. 
I further ask that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the American people have had to en-
dure two of the worst mass shootings 
in recent history in just the span of 10 
days. One of them happened to be in 
my home State of New York in the 
dear city of Buffalo; the other hap-
pened yesterday in Texas, the worst 
school shooting since Sandy Hook, and 
we can’t get out of our minds—I can’t— 
the picture of 10, 11, and 9-year-olds 
being shot, killed, just ready to burst 
into the adolescent and adult phases of 
their lives. 
What the American people want is 
real solutions to our Nation’s gun vio-
lence epidemic. We have had too many 
moments of silence, too many thoughts 
and prayers. Americans are sick of it. 
Many in this Chamber are sick of it. 
Here is the sad truth about what hap-
pened yesterday and why I plan to ob-
ject to my colleague’s UC: hardening 
schools would have done nothing to 
prevent this shooting. In fact, there 
were guards and police officers already 
at the school yesterday when the 
shooter showed up. One was a school 
police officer, two were from the 
Uvalde Police Department. The shooter 
got past all of them with two assault 
weapons 
that 
he 
purchased. 
They 
couldn’t stop him. 
The bill would not have protected 
those children. More guns won’t pro-
tect our children. That is the wrong 
answer. There are too many guns and 
too many options for the wrong people 
to get guns. 
So I plan to object to passing this 
measure today through consent, but I 
would tell my colleague from Wis-
consin, tomorrow we can begin voting 
on a bill that will take us—that will let 
us take action on guns, and we could 
consider amendments like this then, 
along with others. 
Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to 
take the first step—the first step—in 
responding to the shooting that hap-
pened in my home State of New York 2 
weeks ago and so many other mass 
shootings over the years that have 
been motivated by race. 
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act, which I set in motion earlier this 
week, is a necessary and timely step to 
honor the memories of the dead in Buf-
falo and to make sure mass shootings 
motivated by race don’t happen again. 
I urge all my Republican colleagues 
to vote to get on the bill. All we are 
asking is a vote ‘‘yes’’ on the motion to 
proceed. 
I urge my colleague from Wisconsin 
to vote yes on that bill. 
If Senator JOHNSON helps us get on 
the domestic terrorism bill, we could 
consider amendments related to guns— 
his and others’ who have a different 
point of view. If Republicans can vote 
with us to get on that bill, we can have 
a debate on considering commonsense, 
strong gun safety amendments, hope-
fully with bipartisan support. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin says his bill is bi-
partisan. There are five Republican 
sponsors. 
The bottom line is, if you want to 
have bipartisan debates, you don’t just 
say: My bill must pass by unanimous 
consent, and no other bill can pass. I 
am providing a path that we can have 
a debate on these amendments. 
Let me be clear. We are going to vote 
on gun legislation, and the Republicans 
could let us start doing that as soon as 
tomorrow if they simply vote yes on 
the motion to proceed, and I give them 
a pledge that we will then start debat-
ing gun amendments—Senator JOHN-
SON’s and many others’ who have a dif-
ferent point of view. I repeat, though, 
we are going to vote on gun legislation. 
The American people are tired of mo-
ments of silence, tired of the kind 
words offering thoughts and prayers. 
We can use the domestic terrorism 
bill tomorrow to begin—I repeat, to 
begin—considering gun safety amend-
ments, and we can consider the pro-
posal he brings to the floor today. So 
we won’t just have this amendment; we 
will have a lot of amendments to de-
bate. That seems perfectly fair and, in 
fact, bipartisan. Alone, the Johnson 
bill is not in any way, shape, or form a 
sufficient solution, and so I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. 
JOHNSON. 
As 
chairman 
of 
Homeland Security, I have passed more 
than 300 pieces of legislation out of 
committee, and over 130 of those be-
came law. Very few of those—almost 
none—were partisan in any way, shape, 
or form. The approach I used to have 
that kind of legislative success is, rath-
er than focus on issues that divide us, 
I concentrated on areas of agreement. 
Today, I brought to the Senate floor 
a nonpartisan bill, a bill crafted by the 
parents—the parents—who lost their 
sons in one of these horrific tragedies. 
It passed out of our committee twice 
unanimously. Those parents asked me

to come today to please pass this bill; 
take some action; provide some com-
fort to all the parents who are griev-
ing, to a nation that is grieving. 
So I came to the floor today, and I 
will not engage in partisanship other 
than to say it is just sad—it is just sad 
that this body can’t pass this bill when, 
about a month ago, they passed an 
identical bill that applied to churches. 
This one applies to schools. Yet it is in-
appropriate, according to the majority 
leader, to pass this nonpartisan bill by 
unanimous consent? This is a very sad 
day for the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
NOMINATION OF HENRY CHRISTOPHER FREY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
gas prices have set new alltime record 
highs every day for more than 2 weeks. 
Overall inflation is the worst it has 
been in more than 40 years. And the 
Biden administration is preparing to 
follow their botched Afghanistan re-
treat with a disastrous nuclear deal 
that would help Iran and hurt America. 
But this week, the Senate Democrat 
majority is not taking action on any of 
those things; the Senate is instead 
spending the week cramming more far- 
left bureaucrats into the executive 
branch, where they will keep making 
these problems even worse. 
Later today, Senate Democrats want 
to confirm as Assistant Administrator 
for EPA someone who has previously 
researched the environmental impact 
of football tailgating and concluding it 
would be best for the environment if 
the authorities—listen to this—banned 
charcoal grills and gas generators. This 
is no joke. Dr. Christopher Frey lit-
erally coauthored a research paper that 
argued 
that 
‘‘the 
most 
environ-
mentally responsible policy would be 
. . . a universal ban on idling, charcoal 
grills, and old generators’’—just the 
nominee the American people need 
confirmed by Memorial Day weekend. 
So, honestly, where do they find 
these people? The same nominee wrote 
in defense of the illegal, job-killing so- 
called Clean Power Plan. As a past 
chairman of the EPA’s Clean Air Sci-
entific Advisory Committee, he worked 
to politicize its work from outside. 
Things aren’t going any better at the 
committee level. This morning, the 
HELP Committee deadlocked on the 
nomination of Kalpana Kotagal, whom 
President Biden wants to put on the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission. Ms. Kotagal is a liberal plain-
tiff’s lawyer who is best known for re-
writing Hollywood legal contracts to 
push 
movie 
casting 
toward 
racial 
quotas, gender quotas, and sexual ori-
entation quotas. The President has 
found the one person in America who 
thinks liberal Hollywood is not woke 
enough. 
The nominee also has a record of hos-
tility to American energy. She has 
been both an official spokeswoman and 
a registered lobbyist for a far-left 
group that wants to eliminate fossil 
fuels. She is on the board of another or-
ganization that has frivolously sued 
the State of West Virginia over energy 
issues. 
The American people know Wash-
ington Democrats’ policies hurt work-
ing families. They have seen that in 
our colleagues’ legislation. And it is 
more of the same when it comes to the 
nominees they are picking to design 
and carry out their tsunami of regula-
tions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works, I rise 
to oppose the nomination of Dr. Chris 
Frey due to the consistent lack of re-
sponsiveness from the EPA on our crit-
ical oversight matters. 
The 
Republican 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, just talked about Dr. 
Frey’s research on gas grills and grill-
ing out, but over the past 16 months, 
my objections are that the Biden EPA 
has repeatedly slow-walked responses 
to reasonable oversight requests for 
Agency briefings and documents re-
lated to implementation of policies 
with huge, huge implications for our 
economy and our constituents’ lives. 
We cannot adequately oversee the 
Agency’s programs—including historic 
levels of drinking water infrastructure 
funding made possible by the bipar-
tisan IIJA—without this transparency. 
Until the EPA heeds congressional 
oversight requests, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in opposing Dr. 
Frey’s nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, as 
we heard from previous speakers, we 
will shortly vote to invoke cloture on 
the nomination of Dr. Christopher Frey 
to 
be 
Assistant 
Administrator 
for 
EPA’s Office of Research and Develop-
ment. I rise today in strong support of 
his nomination. 
Chris Frey, as he is known to his 
friends and colleagues, is an out-
standing public servant, a deeply re-
spected scientist, and an excellent 
choice to fill this leadership role at 
EPA. 
The Office of Research and Develop-
ment provides the bedrock of scientific 
analysis upon which we establish our 
Nation’s critical environmental protec-
tion regulations. The EPA is able to 
fulfill its responsibilities to protect our 
air that we breathe, to protect the 
water that we drink, and the land we 
build our communities upon because of 
the robust scientific research provided 
by what is called O-R-D, the Office of 
Research and Development. 
Dr. Frey’s nomination received a bi-
partisan vote in the Committee on En-
vironment and Public Works. He has 
the experience, intellect, and integrity 
to lead this indispensable office. I am 
eager to see him confirmed. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in supporting cloture on his nomina-
tion. This is about restoring science as 
the guiding force in EPA’s work. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON THOMPSON NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
know of no further debate on the nomi-
nation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is, 
Will the Senate advise and consent to 
the Thompson nomination? 
Mr. CARPER. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Henry Christopher Frey, of North Caro-
lina, to be an Assistant Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Is this a proper forum 
to do a unanimous consent request? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs needs a 
steady hand to guide the Veterans 
Health Administration, this Nation’s 
largest integrated healthcare system 
that delivers quality care and timely 
care to our veterans, if they have a 
leader. 
I rise today because Dr. Shereef 
Elnahal is that person. He has an im-
pressive record of leading healthcare 
systems and health agencies. 
Most recently Dr. Elnahal served as 
president and CEO of University Hos-
pital in Newark, NJ, and previously as 
New Jersey’s 21st health commissioner. 
But, more importantly, he is com-
mitted to caring for the more than 9 
million veterans in VA care, a commit-
ment he has carried out as assistant 
deputy undersecretary for health and 
quality, safety, and value at the de-
partment. It is no secret that VHA and 
healthcare systems of providers nation-
ally are going through a challenging 
time. 
VA is continuing to battle the im-
pact of the COVID–19 pandemic, with 
veterans’ cases, hospitalizations and 
death on the rise again. And VA staff 
are dealing with burnout and increas-
ing turnover in our VA system. 
So I am going to tell you, if the peo-
ple of this body want to help—want to 
help veterans, holding this nominee is 
not the way to help veterans. And I 
will tell you what, they are actually 
doing a disservice to veterans and their 
families by playing political games and 
preventing permanent healthcare lead-
ership at the VA, which is so critically 
important. 
In the past, this body has been able 
to rise above politics to install quali-
fied individuals at the VA, responsible 
for getting vets the healthcare and the 
benefits that they not only need but 
they have earned. And today, we must 
do that again. 
We must act without delay to con-
firm Dr. Elnahal as VA’s next under-
secretary for health. 
So with that, I would ask unanimous 
consent that notwithstanding rule 22, 
the Senate consider the following nom-
ination: Calendar No. 902, Shereef M. 
Elnahal, 
to 
be 
undersecretary 
for 
health of the Department of Veterans’ 
Affairs; that the Senate vote on the 
nomination without intervening action 
or debate, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table, that any statements related to 
the nomination be printed in the 
record. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Reserving the 
right to object. 
Throughout 
his 
presidency, 
Joe 
Biden and his administration have 
shown an inability to place qualified 
and competent people in many posi-
tions of power across the Federal Gov-
ernment. We have had crisis after crisis 
due to the failed leadership of Presi-
dent Biden and his appointees. 
Americans have been left with no 
faith in President Biden’s ability to 
lead or appoint qualified individuals to 
serve in these important roles. And 
this nominee, who will be in charge of 
critical healthcare programs in the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, is no dif-
ferent. 
I cannot and will not consent to 
allow this nominee to move forward in 
an expedited manner. 
We should take a vote so every Sen-
ator can get on the record with their 
support or opposition to this nominee. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The senior Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, this 
individual—through 
the 
Chair—has 
been President and CEO of University 
Hospital in Newark, NJ. He has been 
New Jersey’s 21st health commissioner. 
Why do you think—Senator from Flor-
ida, through the Chair, why do you 
think that makes him unqualified? 
Would the Senator from Florida like to 
respond? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I don’t think 
we should do this in an ex parte man-
ner. 
Mr. 
TESTER. 
What 
is 
that? 
I 
couldn’t hear you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I don’t think 
we should do this in an ex parte man-
ner. I think everybody should be on the 
record. 
Mr. TESTER. So we had a hearing on 
Mr. Elnahal. If my memory serves me 
correct, he went out by voice, because 
he was so very, very good. 
I would really appreciate it if the 
Senator from Florida would at least 
stay here rather than turn his back on 
the veterans of America and walk out 
the door, turning his back on the 
American veterans, the people who 
have served this country, the people 
who have fought. We are coming up to 
Memorial Day. I hope that the Senator 
from Florida doesn’t walk into Memo-
rial Day services and talk about what a

great friend he is of our veterans be-
cause he is not. 
All I am asking for is to give the VA 
the tools they need to be able to pro-
vide our veterans with the healthcare 
they have earned. 
This isn’t the first time I have been 
on the floor for a unanimous consent 
request with the Senator from Florida. 
But this is an excuse that doesn’t hold 
water. I didn’t see the Senator from 
Florida at the committee hearing. 
Even though he is not a member of the 
VA Committee, if he was so concerned 
about this person, why wasn’t he at the 
committee hearing to hear the re-
sponses that Dr. Elnahal gave? 
I am going to tell you what this is. 
With all due respect to the Senator 
from Florida, this is obstruction at the 
worst because this obstruction stops 
our 
veterans 
from 
getting 
the 
healthcare they need. 
You want to talk about why the 
American people think the U.S. Senate 
is dysfunctional? The Senator from 
Florida could look in the mirror. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
at the end of April, I had the honor of 
traveling to Germany, Poland, and 
Lithuania to meet with American serv-
icemembers and hear from high-level 
government officials on the state of de-
mocracy in Europe as Russia wages 
war against Ukraine. I returned to the 
United States with the reassurance 
that the commitment of our partners 
and allies to defending freedom and de-
feating tyranny has only grown strong-
er. I also returned with three impor-
tant takeaways that I believe must be 
central in America’s response to Rus-
sia’s murderous invasion of Ukraine 
and must define our commitment to 
supporting our NATO allies and pre-
serving democracy. 
First, America and our freedom-lov-
ing partners across the world must 
renew 
our 
commitment 
to 
‘‘never 
again,’’ support the massive humani-
tarian efforts underway to aid Ukrain-
ian refugees and those who are helping 
them, and forcefully condemn the 
genocide occurring at the direction of 
Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. 
Let me say that again. First, Amer-
ica and our freedom-loving partners 
across the world must renew our com-
mitment to ‘‘never again,’’ support the 
massive humanitarian efforts under-
way to aid Ukrainian refugees and 
those who are helping them, and force-
fully condemn the genocide occurring 
at the direction of Vladimir Putin in 
Ukraine. 
In 2005, my wife, daughters, and I 
spent 2 days visiting the Auschwitz Me-
morial and Museum in Poland. Anyone 
who has had the opportunity to walk 
the grounds of that place will tell you 
how overwhelming it is to confront the 
horrors that occurred there. It is out of 
these horribly dark places that the 
phrase ‘‘never again’’ was born. 
Following the liberation of the Nazi 
concentration 
camps, 
the 
world 
pledged to never again allow genocide 
to take the lives of innocent people, 
but today, Putin is choosing that path. 
When I returned to Poland last 
month, I had the solemn honor of par-
ticipating in a Holocaust memorial 
ceremony alongside U.S. Ambassador 
to Poland Mark Brzezinski in what was 
formerly the Warsaw ghetto and laid a 
wreath there to honor the Jewish peo-
ple who fought the Nazi occupation. I 
also visited a refugee center serving 
the thousands of Ukrainians forced 
from their homes and who have been 
welcomed with open arms by the Polish 
people. 
During the ceremony and as I walked 
through 
the 
refugee 
center, 
my 
thoughts constantly turned to the 
atrocious attacks on Mariupol. The 
leveling of that city and the mass 
graves found there in Bucha cannot be 
ignored or dismissed as part of the war. 
These are crimes against humanity. 
Children are dying. Families are dying 
precisely because they are Ukrainian 
and won’t do what the dictator Putin 
wants them to do. This is genocide. 
World leaders promise ‘‘never again,’’ 
but they are failing. 
I thank God for the incredible hospi-
tality of the Polish people to welcome 
these Ukrainian families. I am grate-
ful, too, for what other European coun-
tries are doing to help them. 
We must do everything in our power, 
using our voices, actions, and re-
sources, to support these humanitarian 
missions 
and 
forcefully 
condemn 
Putin’s genocide in Ukraine. 
Second, we must continue to show 
full support to Ukraine and do every-
thing in our power to help it win in 
this war. That includes approving de-
livery of the MiG–29 fighter jets that 
President Zelenskyy has been request-
ing for months. 
President Biden’s blockade of these 
aircraft is an act of weakness and 
makes no sense. If we want to prevent 
putting American men and women on 
the 
battlefield, 
we 
need 
to 
give 
Ukraine every military and intel-
ligence resource it needs to fight and 
win this war. Most of our NATO allies 
agree with this, but Joe Biden insists 
on standing in the way and is actively 
helping Putin maintain dominance in 
the skies. 
Vladimir Putin is a murderous thug. 
His unjust war intentionally targets ci-
vilians and has taken thousands of in-
nocent lives. This is genocide. 
The Ukrainians have shown that they 
are willing and able to fight this war 
themselves and can defeat Putin. We 
need to let them do it. When the war is 
over, accountability must be demanded 
and secured. Putin and his thugs in 
Russia and Belarus must be tried for 
their crimes in a war tribunal. They 
should never see another day of free-
dom as long as they live. 
Third and finally, we must recognize 
the importance of energy and indus-
trial independence from tyrannical and 
genocidal regimes like Russia and com-
munist China. 
I have long advocated for American 
businesses to decouple their operations 
from communist China. In March, I ap-
pealed directly to American business 
leaders and urged them in an open let-
ter to begin the process of cutting ties 
with communist China and our depend-
ence on its supply chain and realign 
American businesses with U.S. values. 
Russia’s 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine shows exactly why decoupling 
from evil regimes is so important, and 
Europe now understands this better 
than anyone else. That is why we 
should applaud businesses that have 
taken steps to end their relationships 
with these regimes and applaud nations 
like Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, 
which have taken aggressive action to 
end their reliance on Russian energy. 
Lithuania has also boldly stood up to 
communist China and supported Tai-
wan. Their bravery is exemplary and 
deserves our support. 
These nations are the exception to 
the rule in Europe, but their leadership 
in forming partnerships with demo-
cratic neighbors like Norway has prov-
en critical to freeing them from the 
Kremlin’s threats of withholding re-
sources. 
To 
protect 
democracy 
and 
sov-
ereignty from the influence of evil 
leaders like Putin and Xi, we must 
commit to preferring to do business 
with fellow democratic governments as 
much as possible. That is why I have 
been demanding that Biden take imme-
diate steps to put America back on the 
path to energy independence, stop his 
appeasement policies with the world’s 
dictators, and end all trade talks with 
Venezuela and other evil regimes. 
I recently secured a commitment 
from Energy Secretary Granholm that 
the United States would not import 
any oil from Venezuela or Iran. She 
said so in an open and public hearing in 
the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
President Biden needs to publicly reaf-
firm that commitment. 
Our attitude should always be Amer-
ica first, but if it can’t be made in 
America, it must be made by a demo-
cratic partner or at the very least one 
who seeks mutual benefit with us in-
stead of our downfall. 
Decoupling from Russia and com-
munist China and other tyrannical re-
gimes will not be easy for many busi-
nesses or governments, America in-
cluded. This move won’t occur over-
night, but it is absolutely necessary as 
these despots advance their plans for 
world domination and continue to 
carry out assaults on sovereignty and 
democracy in Europe and Asia, as well

as support dictators in Latin America 
like Maduro, Ortega, and the Castro/ 
Diaz-Canel regime. If America and our 
freedom-loving partners are going to 
truly stand for democracy, we cannot 
do so while lining the pockets of those 
who seek to actively destroy liberty 
and independence wherever it exists. 
Whether we like it or not, we need to 
recognize the evil in our world. It ex-
ists in the Governments of communist 
China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Ven-
ezuela, Nicaragua, and Russia. They 
want a different world, one where the 
enemies of democracy, human rights, 
and sovereign nations issue the orders 
and the United States and our allies do 
what we are told. They will bully and 
crush anyone in their way if they are 
allowed. I, for one—and I know I am 
not alone—will not accept this. 
Out of this terrible conflict, America 
has an opportunity to reaffirm our 
commitment to the security and inde-
pendence 
of 
democratic 
nations, 
strengthen our energy and industrial 
independence and partnerships was fel-
low democracies, and stop genocide, re-
newing the promise of ‘‘never again.’’ 
We cannot allow this moment to pass 
without creating this need to change. 
The survival of democracy and the 
United States depends on it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
just share candid emotions about yes-
terday’s tragic shooting of school-
children who were 2 days from the end 
of the school year in Texas—19 deaths 
of little ones and 2 teachers and others 
injured. This is rough. I don’t have any 
notes because I am really emotional 
about it. These shootings kind of give 
me PTSD, I have to admit. 
I was the mayor of Richmond, and 
our city had the second highest homi-
cide rate in the United States. At a 
much younger period of my life, I found 
myself going to too many funerals, to 
too many wakes, to maybe the most 
memorable crime scenes, then also to 
homicide victims’ family support group 
meetings in church basements in my 
city. 
Then I got to be the Governor of Vir-
ginia. In April of 2007, my wife and I 
landed in Japan while leading a trade 
mission, and we went to a hotel and 
immediately got a phone call saying 
that there was a shooting underway on 
the campus of Virginia Tech University 
and that I should turn on CNN, which 
I did, in Japan. 
As I saw the events unfold, I said: 
Take us right back to the airport. 
We had flown 14 hours. We were in 
the hotel for about an hour but went 
right back to the airport and flew all 
the way back home to what was the 
worst day of my life in trying to com-
fort 32 family members who had lost 
kids or their spouses who were faculty 
members—and that process went on for 
years—in the days right after the hor-
rible tragedy but then commissioning a 
study about what went wrong and then 
trying to find an appropriate settle-
ment with these families that would 
honor their loved ones. 
I had to deal with State police offi-
cers—hardened, hardened law enforce-
ment veterans—who walked into the 
classrooms at Virginia Tech, to find 
carnage and on each body a cell phone 
ringing because a parent had seen it on 
television and wanted to call to make 
sure it wasn’t one of their children who 
had been killed. My law enforcement 
officers talked about how those rings 
that would never be answered just 
haunted them, haunted them. 
So when there are these shootings at 
a school, at a nightclub, at a concert, 
in a grocery store, in a church, in a 
synagogue, I feel like I am back in 
April of 2007, experiencing those emo-
tions for the first time. 
I was analyzing my own emotions for 
the first time last night. Why have I 
not been able to reach a point of 
more—I don’t know—emotional equi-
librium about this after 15 years? I re-
alized that the reason was that my 
emotional reaction that is kind of a 
PTSD thing is not just because of the 
shootings, not just because of the 
deaths, not just because of the prom-
ising lives cut short; it is compounded 
by a realization that, here in this body, 
we have done nothing. 
It would be bad enough to experience 
the violence and be reminded of that 
most painful time in my life, but to ex-
perience it as a U.S. Senator, as a 
Member of a body, and to say, ‘‘Well, 
what have we done? We didn’t do any-
thing at the Federal level after Vir-
ginia Tech, and we didn’t do anything 
after Pulse, and we didn’t do anything 
after Las Vegas, and we didn’t do any-
thing after Sandy Hook, and we didn’t 
do anything after one tragedy after the 
next,’’ then that compounds in some 
ways, and that is the thing that makes 
the emotional reaction a reaction that 
is as fresh today as it was in April of 
2007. It is a wound that can’t heal until 
we do something to heal the injury, to 
heal the problem. 
I was thinking about this last night, 
and I was trying to, you know, think, 
what is some wisdom that I can derive 
to make me feel less down and less de-
spondent? And I just thought of two 
things that I wanted to share. One is a 
spiritual insight, and the other is a 
practical reason not to lose hope. 
So, as a spiritual insight, a few years 
ago, Pope Francis was kicking off a 
yearlong effort to encourage the revi-
talization of parish life—not the life of 
the big, universal church but the life of 
parishes. He challenged parishes, but 
this challenge could go for people, and 
it certainly could go for political lead-
ers. He challenged parishes to be 
(statement made in Spanish) ‘‘islands 
of mercy in the midst of a sea of indif-
ference,’’ and I thought, what an inter-
esting challenge. 
The thing about that challenge that I 
thought was so beautiful and a little 
bit unexpected is he didn’t counterpose 
mercy to evil or mercy to cruelty or 
mercy to hatred; he contrasted mercy 
with indifference—with indifference. 
There is evil in the world, and there 
is hatred in the world, and there is cru-
elty in the world. Yet usually those 
forces are not strong enough to succeed 
for very long unless—unless—there is 
widespread indifference. We are chal-
lenged not to be indifferent. 
If we assess why the Senate, this 
great deliberative body, has been un-
willing to act for 15 years, I don’t think 
it is cruelty or evil; it is indifference. 
It is the very thing that Pope Francis 
was warning us to avoid. 
We should be merciful. We should not 
be indifferent. Evil doesn’t thrive for 
very long absent indifference. Yet, de-
spite what we often say after tragedies 
like this, with our thoughts and our 
prayers and our sincere emotions, if we 
don’t demonstrate by more than just 
words that we are touched by these 
tragedies, then we are committing the 
sin of indifference. 
I hope very much that the tragedy of 
these little children’s deaths may push 
us out of the indifference that we have 
been sunk in at least on this issue. I 
really hope that it will. 
Then, finally, there is a practical rea-
son I am not going to give up hope that 
it will. I mentioned that I was the 
mayor of Richmond, dealing with a 
homicide problem, and that I was the 
Governor during what was at the time 
the worst mass shooting in the history 
of the United States. Sadly, it has been 
eclipsed. The Virginia Tech shooting is 
no longer the most tragic shooting in 
history. Others have eclipsed it in 
terms of the numbers of those killed. 
I felt that same despair then, and I 
threw myself into trying to make 
changes. I made the changes in the Vir-
ginia laws that I could make as the 
Governor by executive action, but 
there are some things I couldn’t do by 
executive action. I needed the support 
of my legislature to do a comprehen-
sive background check bill because, in 
the case of the Virginia Tech shooting, 
Seung-Hui Cho, the disturbed 19-year- 
old who committed that crime, was le-
gally barred from owning a weapon, 
but weaknesses in the background 
check system didn’t catch that, and he 
was able to get the weapons that led to 
that carnage. 
I couldn’t get my legislature, even in 
the aftermath of the worst shooting in 
the history of the United States, to be 
willing to take action, but we never 
gave up. We kept pushing. We kept 
pushing in Virginia, the headquarters’ 
State of the National Rifle Associa-
tion. We kept pushing and pushing and 
pushing, and in 2019, 12 years after the 
tragedy at Virginia Tech, my legisla-
ture passed a set of commonsense gun 
safety rules: one handgun a month, a 
ban on certain kinds of weapons that 
nobody needs, a comprehensive back-
ground check, mental health support— 
a series of initiatives. My legislature 
did pass it in 2019, and my State is 
safer as a result, but 12 years was a

long time to wait. There were a lot of 
tragedies that happened between 2007 
and 2019. 
Thank God for the Virginia Tech 
family members and for the other ad-
vocates who said: We will wait. We are 
not going away. We are patient. We are 
discouraged. Each loss we feel afresh, 
but we are not stopping until we make 
that happen. 
In my first months in the Senate, we 
voted on the floor on a comprehensive 
background check bill. I think that 
was the last time we had a meaningful 
debate about gun safety policy on the 
floor of this body—9 years ago. It is 
like there is a gag rule here. You know, 
it used to be, in Congress, you were not 
allowed to have debate or to vote about 
issues dealing with slavery during the 
1830s. It is like we have a gag rule 
about debating gun safety on the floor 
of this body. 
But I remember voting that day, and 
it was on the anniversary of the shoot-
ing at Virginia Tech that we voted on 
a bipartisan background check bill in 
this body in 2013. The Sandy Hook fam-
ilies were sitting in the Galleries, and 
many of the Virginia Tech families had 
come up to join them to offer them 
support. I was reminded of the Scrip-
ture and the letter of Paul to the He-
brews being surrounded by a great 
cloud of witnesses. And here we were 
on the floor, trying to respond to this 
tragedy and do something to ease their 
grief, and we fell a couple of vote 
shorts. We couldn’t get to 60. I think 
we had 57 votes that day for a back-
ground check bill. That was painful. It 
was painful. It was especially painful 
to fall short in the view of all of these 
grieving family members. 
But I draw hope from this. If we can 
make progress on this issue in Vir-
ginia—the headquarters of the NRA— 
we can make it in the U.S. Senate. It 
may not happen as quickly as I want, 
and it may not happen while I am still 
here to see it, but there is no reason to 
give up. If we can do this in Virginia, 
we can do this in the U.S. Senate, and 
we ought to. There is nothing we can 
do to bring back the lives of these 
young people, but if we can act to de-
crease the chance that this will ever 
happen again, they will at least have 
the ability to grab on and say: Our ad-
vocacy made a difference, and kids who 
go to school will be safer in the future. 
This is the last thing I will say, and 
I will sit down. I was walking around 
the building this morning, and because 
I am fluent in Spanish and people 
around here know it—a lot of the Cap-
itol staffers are Latinos, and they talk 
to me in Spanish—I passed by a long-
time Capitol staffer who said in Span-
ish: Senator, what is going on? What is 
going on with this country? 
I said: I know what you are asking 
me about, and it is such a tragedy. 
Then she said this to me. She is from 
El Salvador. She said: My country is a 
mess, and the violence is awful, and the 
homicide rate is unacceptable, but no 
children in schools feel unsafe. No peo-
ple going to church services feel un-
safe. What is going on, Senator? 
I didn’t have a good answer for her. I 
didn’t have a good answer for her. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 
last night, as I was doomscrolling—as 
they say one does at 2 in the morning 
when you can’t sleep—what I was look-
ing up were places to buy ballistic pro-
tective backpacks for my daughters, 
who are 4 and 7, and places to buy bal-
listic protective white boards, which 
could be donated to my girls’ school, 
that would act as shields should a 
shooter go to their school. It is bad 
enough that I felt I had to do that, but 
the fact of the matter is, those pages 
were already bookmarked because it 
was not the first time that I have had 
to look them up. 
Just 10 days, 240 hours, less than 2 
weeks is all it took. It took just 10 
days from the racially motivated do-
mestic terrorism attack in Buffalo be-
fore we had to mourn the loss of yet 
more Americans—this time, 19 babies 
and 2 teachers—to a senseless, horrific, 
and, importantly, preventable mass 
shooting in Uvalde, TX. These were 
children gunned down at their school, 
with their small bodies mangled, ut-
terly destroyed by lethal weapons of 
war that are designed to quickly kill 
adults. 
So, last night when I got home, I held 
on to my two babies so tightly. They 
didn’t know why, but I wasn’t going to 
let them go. I was just so grateful they 
came home from school. 
Today, there are at least 19 more 
families in our country that will never 
be able to forget the horrific site of 
what happens to a baby’s body, to a 
child’s body when shot at close range 
with an AR–15 or similarly styled rifle 
meant for battlefields and not schools. 
I come to the floor today because, as 
a mother, I am beyond angry. I am fu-
rious, heartbroken, and fed up. I am 
sick to my stomach thinking about 
what those parents are feeling right 
now. They sent off their babies to 
school yesterday morning, just like I 
did. They packed their lunch, like I 
did. They argued with their babies 
about hurry up, the bus is coming. You 
are going to miss the bus. No, you real-
ly do have to wear a sweater. I know 
that you don’t think it is cold, but you 
have to wear a sweater or today is PE 
day, and you have to wear your tennis 
shoes. But unlike my daughters, those 
babies never came home again. They 
will never laugh their beautiful laughs 
again. They will never smile their wild, 
silly, gorgeous smiles again. That is a 
hell on Earth I wouldn’t wish on my 
worst enemy. 
As a Senator, I ask my colleagues: 
How many more children will you 
allow to be murdered on your watch? 
How many more? How many more tiny 
bodies have to be ripped apart by weap-
ons of war before you will stand up to 
the gun lobby and the NRA? How many 
more children will you allow to go to 
school each day traumatized, fearing 
for their lives; children, terrified of 
being gunned down in their classrooms, 
practicing active shooter drills instead 
of studying their ABCs and 123s. When 
will it be enough for you to do some-
thing, anything, to simply do your job? 
When will children’s lives matter more 
than your check from the gun lobby? 
When? 
Last night, my colleague from Con-
necticut Senator MURPHY came to the 
floor to ask our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, ‘‘What are we doing?’’ 
But my Republican colleagues know 
exactly what they are doing. They 
know exactly what they are risking, 
whose lives they are endangering when 
they refuse to lift a finger in the wake 
of yet another mass shooting. 
When the assault weapons ban was 
allowed to expire, the number of mass 
shooting deaths tripled—tripled. We 
know that the ban works, and we need 
to reinstate it. 
Republicans are yet again pushing 
for nothing to be done, falling back on 
the old line that only one thing stops a 
bad guy with a gun, and that is a good 
guy with a gun, knowing full well that 
there were good guys with guns at both 
Uvalde and Buffalo. And here we are, 
mourning dozens of lives anyway. 
And I have even heard some of them 
say let’s equip the teachers with guns. 
I would rather equip teachers with 
more pieces of chalk and more learning 
tools than guns because even if those 
teachers had had a gun in the class-
room, they didn’t have a chance to 
react to go grab that gun, and they are 
dead today. 
They pretend like all we can do is 
send thoughts and prayers or they say 
it is too soon to talk about politics. 
But they know that we don’t have any 
time to wait. This time, we didn’t even 
have 10 days to wait from Buffalo. 
It is their job to do more than send 
thoughts and prayers. It is their job— 
our job—to prove that we care even the 
least little bit about those little bodies 
and the giant heartbreaks they leave 
behind. 
We know how to stop these attacks 
from happening as often as they do. 
Heck, the entire rest of the world has 
figured it out. We all know there will 
be another and another and another at-
tack in the weeks and months ahead if 
we do nothing. More innocent lives will 
undoubtedly be lost. 
So if you are not willing to act, if 
you are not willing to do the most 
basic part of your job to prevent the 
senseless loss of innocent life, then 
again I ask, why are you here? 
The Senate should immediately, at a 
50-vote threshold, vote on the common-
sense gun safety reforms that the 
American people have demanded for so 
long. And don’t tell me this is about 
the filibuster because we have, time 
and again, voted at the 50-vote thresh-
old on things that matter, like raising 
the debt ceiling or the defense budget. 
Yet the lives of our babies, the right of

our babies to not be torn apart by 
weapons meant for war is not worthy of 
that? 
We are talking about universal back-
ground checks. We are talking about 
the kind of reforms that widespread 
majorities of Americans support. And 
in the face of yet another moment of 
unimaginable, 
unbearable, 
unfathomable grief, let’s show the Na-
tion that we value children’s lives 
more than an arcane Senate procedure 
rule. Let’s do what adults are supposed 
to do. Let’s protect our kids, the most 
vulnerable, the most innocent. Let’s do 
our jobs. Let’s do what we were sent 
here to do, what our children are de-
pending on us to do. 
We owe it to each victim of this trag-
edy and every tragedy before it and 
their loved ones to finally act. Enough 
was enough a very, very long time ago. 
May those babies rest in peace, those 
little angels now in Heaven. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maine. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Madam 
President, 
shortly, the Senator from Rhode Is-
land, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, will come to the 
Senate floor and attempt to have a live 
unanimous consent request for a nomi-
nee to be the Assistant Secretary of 
Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. 
When he does so, Madam President, I 
intend to object to that request, and I 
want to explain why to my colleagues. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE has been delayed 
in getting to the Senate floor, so I am 
going to outline my objections prior to 
his making the request. 
Madam President, in all of the time 
that I have served in the U.S. Senate, I 
don’t ever recall coming to the Senate 
floor to object to a unanimous consent 
request. I say that because it dem-
onstrates how unusual it is for me to 
be standing here objecting to one of my 
colleague’s 
unanimous 
consent 
re-
quests. Indeed, as I said, I don’t believe 
I have ever done this in all of the time 
I have served in the Senate. 
So let me give the Presiding Officer 
and my colleagues some background. 
On May 1, despite the objections of the 
entire Maine congressional delegation 
and its Democratic Governor, the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration, better known as NOAA, 
imposed onerous new regulations on 
Maine’s lobster industry. 
Now, Madam President, if I asked 
you what is the first thing you think of 
when I say the State of Maine, you 
probably would say lobster, our iconic 
industry. We have more than 4,500 
lobstermen and -women, each of whom 
is self-employed. They have been good 
stewards, always, of the lobster re-
source. They have taken care over the 
decades to make sure that the lobsters 
are large enough, for example, to keep. 
They throw back egg-bearing lobsters. 
There are all sorts of rules and regula-
tions that the lobster industry has 
worked with the State of Maine over 
decades to preserve the precious re-
source. 
But, now, in comes NOAA. NOAA is 
imposing onerous, possibly impossible 
new regulations that do not reflect the 
reality in the Gulf of Maine with re-
gard to the right whale. The final rule 
imposed on May 1 does not even come 
close to reflecting the reality of the 
Maine fishing and lobstering industry 
and the endangered right whale. 
NOAA’s focus on the State of Maine’s 
lobster industry is flawed and unfair. 
In fact, Madam President, the Agency’s 
own data show that there has never, 
never been a right whale entanglement 
death attributed to the Maine lobster 
fishery. 
NOAA denied an entirely reasonable 
request to at least delay the implemen-
tation of these onerous new regulations 
for just 2 months until July 1. The en-
tire delegation, plus our Governor, 
asked for this delay, this 2-month 
delay, because our lobstermen cannot 
even find enough of the gear, the new 
gear that is being mandated by NOAA. 
Just a 2-month delay would have 
helped to prevent huge losses to these 
small business owners. 
Now, this isn’t the first request that 
NOAA has refused. We have worked 
over more than a year with NOAA to 
try to prevent these regulations from 
going into effect in the first place be-
cause they are not relevant to pre-
serving the right whale. Nobody wants 
to see the population of right whales 
decimated, but if you look at the data, 
here is what is happening, Madam 
President. It is ship strikes that have 
been responsible for the death of right 
whales. They have occurred in the St. 
Lawrence Seaway in Canada, not even 
in the State of Maine. 
In addition, there is evidence that 
there is some gear that is used for the 
Canadian snow crab that has been 
found to entangle the right whale. 
That is different from our lobster gear. 
And as I said, there has never been a 
right whale entanglement death attrib-
uted to the Maine lobster fishery. 
So these regulations make no sense 
in the first place, but at least—at 
least—in response to a plea from the 
lobster industry, from the Maine De-
partment of Marine Resources, from 
the Democratic Governor of Maine, 
from the entire Maine delegation—at 
least NOAA could have answered our 
plea to delay these onerous regulations 
for 2 months—2 months—during which 
time maybe this brandnew, very expen-
sive gear would have become more 
available. But, no. Once again, NOAA 
refused. 
This really is outrageous, and the in-
dustry is expected to lose out on $7 
million due to lost fishing time during 
these 2 months. 
Now, 
perhaps 
the 
Senator 
from 
Rhode Island and others do not believe 
what the Maine delegation, the Demo-
cratic Governor of Maine, the Maine 
Department of Marine Resources, and 
many experts are saying about the im-
pact of these regulations and the lack 
of availability of this new gear and the 
fact that the data show that we are not 
the problem in the State of Maine. As 
I said, it is fish strikes and due to 
warming waters, which I know is of 
great concern to the Senator from 
Rhode Island, as it is to me. 
The right whale are actually moving 
and following their food supply into 
Canadian waters. In fact, I have talked 
to many lobstermen and -women who 
have never seen a right whale—never— 
in all the time that they have been 
lobstering. But as I said, maybe NOAA 
just thinks that we are just automatic 
advocates for an iconic industry, de-
spite the extraordinary record of stew-
ardship by the lobster industry. 
So let me give you another source. 
Denying this 2-month extension con-
flicted with the recommendations of 
the U.S. Small Business Administra-
tion’s Office of Advocacy, an inde-
pendent voice for small business within 
the Federal Government. The office of 
advocacy asserted that NOAA was put-
ting lobstermen and -women in ‘‘an im-
possible scenario,’’ and went on to say: 
If they are not granted a short delay of the 
compliance deadline, they may stand to lose 
significant amounts of revenue, or in some 
instances, their entire business. 
This isn’t just the Maine delegation. 
It isn’t just our Governor. It isn’t just 
the Maine Department of Marine Re-
sources. This is another government 
agency. It is the Small Business Ad-
ministration’s 
Office 
of 
Advocacy 
which is saying this. 
Maine harvesters are justifiably wor-
ried about what they are going to do 
and I don’t know what more the Maine 
delegation can do. We have had count-
less meetings with the Department of 
Commerce, with NOAA. I met with the 
Fisheries Administrator in NOAA. I 
asked for his help. He promised to work 
with us. Instead, things have gotten 
only worse. And now our lobster indus-
try worries that NOAA will continue to 
steadily whittle away at their liveli-
hoods while ignoring not only their on- 
the-water expertise, the expertise of 
the State of Maine, but the impartial 
advice of the Federal Government’s 
Small Business Advocate as well. 
The entire agency, all of NOAA, 
needs to recognize that the practice of 
implementing management decisions 
based on incomplete, imprecise, inac-
curate data—especially when those de-
cisions have a harmful effect on a fish-
ery that is known for its conservation 
methods and on the communities that 
this fishery has supported forever in 
the State of Maine—cannot continue. 
So that is the situation in which we 
find ourselves, and that is why I be-
lieve, for the first time in all the years 
that I have served in the Senate, I have 
come to the floor to object when the 
unanimous consent request is made. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I do not want to 
keep the distinguished Senator from 
Maine on the floor any longer than we 
have to, so I am going to move rapidly 
to the unanimous consent motion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2691 
May 25, 2022 
But I do want to tell the Senator 
that I am actually rather sympathetic 
to her concerns. In Rhode Island, we 
have had issues regarding the black sea 
bass, which NOAA scientists have 
known for more than a decade were 
moving up into our waters, yet the 
fisheries regulation and the allotments 
have not moved accordingly. We have 
problems with evanescent species like 
butterfish and loligo squid that rep-
licate more rapidly than the regulatory 
regime can keep up, so the information 
is really nonsense. And we have an ur-
gent need to enhance electronic moni-
toring on our boats so that human 
monitors don’t have to be taken out on 
the boat. 
Yes, we have frustrations with NOAA 
about its pace in a lot of these areas, 
but I simply think that an understaffed 
NOAA is not a solution to those prob-
lems. 
If I may, I ask unanimous consent 
that notwithstanding rule XXII, the 
Senate consider the following nomina-
tion: Calendar No. 768, Jainey Kumar 
Bavishi, to be Assistant Secretary of 
Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere; 
that the Senate vote on the nomina-
tion without intervening action or de-
bate; that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table; that any statements related to 
the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Ms. COLLINS. I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, let me just say I hope we can find 
a way to move forward. Ms. Bavishi is 
needed to fill a very important posi-
tion. Those of us in coastal States 
know the problem with Oceans and At-
mosphere is profound. Perhaps my fa-
vorite 
new 
figure 
is 
called 
the 
zettajoule, the joule being the unit of 
heat energy by which we measure en-
ergy. The zettajoule is a joule with 21 
zeros. It is a very, very big number. It 
is twice the complete full energy pro-
duction and use by human species on 
the planet. All of our energy, our cars, 
our trucks, our homes, our factories— 
everything is half a zettajoule. For the 
price of that, we add 14 zettajoules of 
heat into the ocean every single year— 
every single year. It is the equivalent 
of three or four Hiroshima-sized atomic 
bombs being set off in the ocean every 
second and the ocean having to absorb 
that heat energy. 
As the Senator from Maine knows, 
the Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest 
heating bodies of water on the planet, 
and she sees it as her fisheries and her 
lobster fisheries, in particular, move 
northward. 
I am eager to find a way to make 
sure that Bavishi can get in place. She 
is a leading climate expert who worked 
in the New York Mayor’s Office of Cli-
mate Resiliency and, before that, in 
the CEQ at the White House. 
I respect the concerns that the Sen-
ator from Maine has indicated. As I 
said, I have my own. I just have a dif-
ferent view as to whether stopping the 
Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Ad-
ministration position from being filled 
is conducive to getting those concerns 
met. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1787 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise 
again today in support of the bipar-
tisan 
State 
Antitrust 
Enforcement 
Venue Act. This is an overwhelmingly 
bipartisan bill. In fact, 99 Senators sup-
port passing this bill. Only one—oddly, 
the lead cosponsor of this bill—has ob-
jected. 
Now, the nature of the objection was 
that passing this bill would somehow 
reduce the chances of passing that Sen-
ator’s own wholly unrelated bill, a dif-
ferent bill, a bill not touching the sub-
ject matter of this bill. But the idea 
that it must be all or nothing is silly, 
and it highlights one of the more vex-
ing problems facing Congress. The idea 
that unless Congress will pass all of 
what a particular Senator wants, that 
no one else can pass anything is some-
thing that is a cause of great dismay 
and frustration. 
Making it easier for State attorneys 
general to enforce the antitrust laws is 
good policy, but it is, of course, not a 
silver bullet. I agree we still need 
meaningful reform at the Federal level. 
Passing this bill would, in no way, 
shape, or form, set back that project. It 
would just allow State attorneys gen-
eral to bring antitrust suits now rather 
than worrying that Big Tech compa-
nies will be able to slow them down by 
requesting that courts combine them 
with private litigation. 
This UC is precisely what happened 
in the Texas v. Google case. In fact, 
unanimously passing this bill will only 
strengthen momentum in Congress for 
meaningful, much-needed antitrust re-
form. It will be a proof of concept of 
sorts, one that indicates that we can 
set aside our egos and partisan dif-
ferences in order to achieve a shared 
goal—in this case, a goal that I believe 
is shared by all 100 Members of this 
body. 
Standing in the way of that achieve-
ment accomplishes nothing. In fact, it 
only plays into the hands of Big Tech. 
Big Tech would love nothing more than 
to see antitrust reform suffocate and 
die on the Senate floor, yet another 
victim 
of 
this 
‘‘all 
or 
nothing’’ 
mindset, of this mindset that would 
suggest unless we pass all of what I 
want now, you can’t pass anything, 
even something that I support. 
It is important that we pass this bill. 
All 100 Senators support it. There is 
only one who has been objecting, and 
the basis of that objection has nothing 
to do with the merits of the legislation; 
it has only to do with the misguided 
and, ultimately, incorrect assumption 
that this would somehow interfere with 
that Senator’s wholly unrelated bill. 
To that end, Madam President, as if 
in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 261, S. 1787; I further ask that the 
Lee amendment at the desk be consid-
ered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. As chairman of the ap-
propriate jurisdictional committee and 
on behalf of Senator KLOBUCHAR
of 
Minnesota, I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I appre-
ciate the longstanding friendship I 
have with my friend and distinguished 
colleague, the Senator from Illinois. I 
know he has no objection to passing 
this bill in this fashion. In fact, it was 
after a long negotiation process culmi-
nating with an agreement between me 
and the Senator from Illinois that we 
made modifications to this legisla-
tion—modifications I didn’t want to 
make but I made in order to get this 
passed. 
It was represented to me in good 
faith by the Senator from Illinois that 
it would pass the hotline; it could pass 
by unanimous consent, if it happened. 
Had it all gone according to how we 
had every reason to believe and how 
the Senator from Illinois had every 
reason to believe at the time, this 
would have been passed by now. 
What we didn’t anticipate was that 
the lead cosponsor of this legislation 
who had herself been a part of these ne-
gotiations, been a part of the conversa-
tion about how we were going to get it 
passed, and been a part of the conversa-
tions about the very modification that 
might be necessary in order to get it 
passed by unanimous consent, would 
then suddenly decide to object. 
Again, this is based not on a sub-
stantive objection to the bill, of which 
she is the lead cosponsor; it is based 
solely on her assessment that this 
might somehow jeopardize her chances 
of passing another antitrust bill, an 
antitrust bill that does not contain any 
provision like this one, an antitrust 
bill that does not preclude consider-
ation of this one nor would this pre-
clude consideration of that one. It is, 
in short, folly, to say the least, to ob-
ject to this under these circumstances. 
It is also bad faith, I believe, to ob-
ject at the very last minute after 
many, many months of negotiation on 
this issue as the lead cosponsor of the 
legislation. It is unfortunate that she 
is unwilling to agree to that. 
It is unfortunate, also, she is not 
willing to be here to raise the objection 
on her own but insisting on doing so 
through a third party—through no 
fault of his own—who is here at her re-
quest, being a good colleague, as he is, 
doing as she had requested.

This is unnecessary. This is petty. 
We are better than this. We need to 
pass this bill. I will be back. I am not 
going to quit until this thing is passed, 
because the fact is, all 100 Senators 
agree that this is good legislation, in-
cluding the objecting absent party. 
We should never get to the point 
where egos get in the way. And egos, 
alone, prevent us from passing legisla-
tion that all 100 Senators agree would 
make things better. I can tell you, 
there is no one who would be happier 
about this than Big Tech. So if the ob-
jecting Senator, who is absent today, 
wishes to make sure that Big Tech is 
held accountable, then she should 
allow this to pass forthwith without 
her objection. If, on the other hand, she 
wants to make it easier for Big Tech, 
then this objection would be the way to 
go. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. As cosponsor of both 
pieces of legislation that are being de-
bated here, I would say to the Senator 
from Utah: Keep the faith. The day will 
come. This legislation will see the 
light of day, and I believe should be-
come law along with Senator KLO-
BUCHAR’s bill. I believe both are good 
pieces of legislation. 
This is not the appropriate moment, 
but that moment will come. 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Madam President, I cannot imagine 
what it was like last night in Texas in 
the homes of the 19 or 20 children who 
lost their lives in that Robb Elemen-
tary School gun massacre. Those are 
the longest, loneliest nights of your 
life as a parent when you have lost a 
child. And for each of them, it came as 
a stunning shock: a child sent off to 
school, nearing the end of the school 
year, probably happily anticipating 
summer camp, a visit with relatives, a 
family vacation, whose life was taken 
away in an instant. 
The freedom and joy of youth was 
ripped from every single one of those 19 
children, and 2 of the heroic teachers 
who sought to protect them when they 
were murdered in cold blood by this 
gunman. 
Today, instead of thinking about va-
cation and summer, the parents are 
sadly making funeral arrangements for 
their babies. Others are sitting down 
with their children and trying to ex-
plain why their playmates are not at 
school. 
It is not even June, and this year 
alone there have been more than 200 
mass shootings in the United States. 
My colleague CHRIS MURPHY of Con-
necticut said last night there had been 
more mass shootings than days in this 
last year. 
Now families across America are 
stepping forward to offer their condo-
lences, to donate to the families who 
lost these precious, precious children, 
and to demand that this Senate act to 
prevent something—do something to 
prevent the appalling acts of mass 
murder that we see way too often. 
The Members of the Senate have to 
make a choice: Will we listen to the 
American people in their overwhelming 
numbers calling on us to set politics 
aside and stop the killing of children 
and other innocent Americans or will 
we cower in front of the gun industry? 
The lives of countless children, and I 
might add, grandchildren, depend on 
our answer to that question. 
It was 21 years ago—hard to imag-
ine—but 21 years ago this September 
when we lived through 9/11. 
That morning, I was in this building, 
down the hall at a meeting at 9 in the 
morning called by Senate Majority 
Leader Tom Daschle. We had just heard 
that a plane had crashed into a sky-
scraper in New York, and we didn’t 
know much more. We quickly turned 
on the television to see another plane 
crash into an adjoining building. It was 
obvious that something horrible had 
happened. And it wasn’t long after that 
that we looked out the window and 
looked west down the Mall to see black 
smoke billowing in. We learned it came 
from the Pentagon, where another 
plane had crashed into that building. 
That was a day none of us will ever 
forget, nor should we. It was a day 
when America changed in so many 
ways. That was the beginning of TSA 
security checks at airports. Things 
that have become commonplace in our 
life were initiated because of 9/11. 
And did we ever mount an effort to 
stop international terrorism against 
the United States. We were serious. It 
was a deadly serious issue, 3,000 inno-
cent people losing their lives on 9/11. 
We were bound and determined—so de-
termined that this Senate declared war 
on al-Qaida and called for the invasion 
of Afghanistan. 
I voted for that because I felt then 
and feel now, no one should attack the 
United States with impunity. There is 
a price to pay. And so we made a deci-
sion which for 20 years guided our for-
eign policy in Afghanistan and other 
decisions by the scores around the 
world that really fought international 
terrorism. 
We learned something recently. Last 
year, we had the Director of the FBI 
come before us, and I asked him about 
domestic terrorism. What about the 
terrorists in America itself who are 
killing innocent people? His report to 
us was sobering. He said it is a real 
threat, and it is a threat that is metas-
tasizing. We know that horrible word 
from the disease of cancer. It means 
that the cancer itself is advancing in a 
deadly way. That is the way the FBI 
Director described domestic terrorism. 
As we mourn yesterday’s mass shoot-
ing in Uvalde, TX, we have a bill com-
ing before the Senate tomorrow that 
responds to the mass shooting that 
took place in Buffalo just 11 days ago, 
in which a gunman killed 10 Black 
Americans in a racist act of violence. 
Tomorrow, we will vote on my bill, 
the Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act. I first introduced it in the year 
2017, and that passed the House on a bi-
partisan basis last week. 
This legislation will help law en-
forcement combat the serious and le-
thal threat of domestic terrorism. It 
will authorize offices within the De-
partment of Justice, the FBI, and the 
Department of Homeland Security that 
are squarely focused on this threat. 
And these offices will be required to 
regularly assess domestic terrorism 
risk and provide training and resources 
to State, local, and Tribal law enforce-
ment. 
The bill will also establish an inter-
agency task force to combat White su-
premacists’ infiltration of the uni-
formed services and Federal law en-
forcement. 
Like gun safety reform, the Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act is long over-
due. I first held a hearing on domestic 
terrorism 10 years ago after a White su-
premacist 
marched 
into 
a 
Sikh 
gurdwara in Oak Creek, WI, opening 
fire and killing seven people. 
In the 10 years since, violent White 
supremacists have massacred Ameri-
cans with their sickening attacks. In 
2015, a White supremacist shot and 
killed nine Black worshippers at the 
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church in Charleston, SC. 
At the time, it was the deadliest at-
tack in a place of worship in recent 
American history, a horrifying record 
that sadly was surpassed just a few 
years later. 
In 2018, an anti-Semitic terrorist 
killed 11 people at the Tree of Life syn-
agogue in Pittsburgh. Think about this 
for a moment. There are members of 
that synagogue who actually survived 
the Holocaust in World War II, only to 
be targeted by the same hate nearly 80 
years later in America. 
A year after that, a far-right extrem-
ist killed 23 people at the Walmart in 
El Paso, TX, targeting immigrants and 
members of the Hispanic community. 
Some of these gunmen subscribe to the 
same racist conspiracy theory as the 
shooter in Buffalo a few days ago, the 
so-called ‘‘great replacement theory.’’ 
It has become the great rallying cry 
for White supremacists. Each of these 
acts of hate-fueled mass murder has 
torn apart a community, traumatized 
the Nation, and left unimaginable grief 
and pain in its wake. 
And so it was over a year ago that 
FBI Director Christopher Wray testi-
fied to domestic terrorism metasta-
sizing and growing in the United 
States. 
Well, I think it is time that we take 
action to stop this threat. Time and 
again, the Senate has failed to take 
any meaningful steps to prevent vio-
lent extremism. When exactly did stop-
ping mass murder become a partisan 
issue? It wasn’t like this after 9/11. 
Twenty years ago, Republicans and 
Democrats joined in common cause to 
confronting 
international 
terrorism 
threatening America. 
After that horrific act of mass mur-
der on 9/11, we worked together on a bi-
partisan basis to reconfigure our entire 
national security apparatus. We cre-
ated a new Agency, the Department of

May 25, 2022 
Homeland Security, designed to pre-
vent the next 9/11. 
To be sure, there were moments when 
we went off in the wrong direction. 
Over the years, we worked to rein in 
legislation like the PATRIOT Act and 
protect civil liberties of the American 
people. 
As lawmakers, our responsibility is 
to enact sensible solutions and save 
lives while also protecting our Con-
stitution. That is exactly what the Do-
mestic Terrorism Prevention Act is all 
about. It will improve data collection 
on incidents of domestic terrorism and 
strengthen Federal coordination to 
combat it. 
That is why it makes no sense to me 
that there are Republicans who oppose 
it. The same Republicans who once 
took bold steps to prevent terrorism on 
an international basis now won’t even 
allow us to debate a bill to prevent ter-
rorism at home. 
There are actually Republican Mem-
bers of the House who are cosponsors of 
my bill, the Domestic Terrorism Pre-
vention Act, who just last week voted 
against it, cosponsors. What exactly is 
the reason for this Republican opposi-
tion? 
Well, one Senate Republican claimed 
that the Domestic Terrorism Preven-
tion Act would be ‘‘the PATRIOT Act 
for American citizens.’’ That is phony 
and wrong. 
First of all, as I just mentioned, the 
PATRIOT Act was flawed. It was an ex-
cessive policy response to a nation in 
panic. I should know because I voted 
for it and then led the effort to change 
it. Here is why the Domestic Terrorism 
Prevention Act is different. 
Unlike the PATRIOT Act, it will not 
provide any new law enforcement or 
surveilling power to the government. It 
also does not establish a single new 
criminal offense. Let me repeat this. 
The bill that comes before us on do-
mestic terrorism does not create any 
new Federal crime, period. This is a 
modest bill with a simple goal: ensure 
that the Federal Government devotes 
existing resources and authorities to 
what has been identified by the FBI as 
the most significant domestic ter-
rorism threats. 
Who supports this bill? The Leader-
ship Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, Asian Americans Advancing 
Justice, the Arab-American Institute, 
the NAACP. All of them and more sup-
port the Domestic Terrorism Preven-
tion Act. 
I hope our Republican colleagues will 
join us in a bipartisan effort to keep 
America safe. Last week, I spoke to the 
courage and sacrifice of Aaron Salter, a 
retired police officer who was working 
as a security guard in that Buffalo gro-
cery store at the time of the attack. 
When the shooter entered the store, 
Officer Salter jumped into action. He 
fired multiple shots at the attacker, 
but his skill and courage were not 
enough. He was outgunned. He had a 
pistol. The shooter had an assault rifle 
and a tactical vest. It is a scenario 
that, sadly, is becoming too common. 
We saw it yesterday in Texas. 
The attacker in yesterday’s school 
shooting in Uvalde was also carrying 
an assault rifle and wearing a tactical 
vest. He reportedly shot two officers 
before entering the school and wound-
ing a Federal law enforcement official. 
Can the Members of this Senate say 
in good conscience that we have done 
enough to protect the lives of police of-
ficers and the children in communities 
like Uvalde? Of course not. They were 
killed by people who never should have 
had a gun in the first place. 
With the Domestic Terrorism Pre-
vention Act, this Senate can take the 
first step of many steps needed to save 
lives and reject hate. The next step is 
finally closing the loophole that allows 
guns to fall into the wrong hands. Ten 
years ago, after 26 little children, God 
bless them, were murdered by a dis-
turbed gunman in Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary School, we voted to close gaps in 
the gun background check system, and 
we fell short. 
Will we finally close those gaps now 
after another school filled with little 
babies and children was targeted in a 
mass shooting? The CDC reported last 
week that for the first time in more 
than 60 years, car accidents are no 
longer the leading cause of death for 
kids and teens. As of 2020, the leading 
cause of death of children and adoles-
cents in America is guns—guns. Guns 
are the No. 1 threat to our children. 
When will we finally find the courage 
and the spine to pass commonsense 
changes to our gun laws that the vast 
majority of Americans support? 
Well, this Friday, the National Rifle 
Association is holding its annual meet-
ing in, of all places, Texas. A few of the 
politicians who are scheduled to speak 
at that gathering were among the first 
to send their thoughts and prayers to 
Uvalde. Well, I hope and pray they will 
find the courage to stop cowering be-
fore the gun lobby and take action to 
save our children’s lives. 
Let me address one last misconcep-
tion about this bill. A number of my 
colleagues have said: Well, why did you 
have to use the words ‘‘White suprema-
cists’’ or ‘‘neo-Nazis’’ in the bill? Why 
did you want to focus on that? 
Let me make it clear that we are fo-
cusing on domestic terrorism, and that 
is why we mention White supremacism. 
The bill requires reports to Congress on 
all domestic terrorism activity, with a 
breakdown by specific category. 
The bill requires that White su-
premacist terrorism be one of those 
specific categories. We include this re-
quirement because during the Trump 
Presidential administration, the FBI 
was ordered to stop tracking White su-
premacist attacks as a separate cat-
egory of domestic terrorism. 
Remarkably, the FBI stopped track-
ing White supremacist attacks in the 
middle of the spate of White suprema-
cist violence, including the lethal at-
tack at the 2017 Charlottesville ‘‘Unite 
the Right’’ rally and the 2018 Tree of 
Life synagogue shooting. 
This decision also came after an un-
classified May 2017 joint intelligence 
bulletin from the FBI and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security that found 
‘‘white supremacist extremism poses 
[a] persistent threat of lethal’’—le-
thal—‘‘violence,’’ and that White su-
premacists ‘‘were responsible for 49 
homicides and 26 attacks from 2016 . . . 
more than any other domestic extrem-
ist movement.’’ 
I am not making this up. People are 
dying because of these extremists. We 
are asking the FBI and other Agencies 
to identify the incidents of violence so 
that we can track them, find if they 
are growing or receding; train local law 
enforcement to recognize it. 
This bill does not require collecting 
of data on First Amendment-protected 
speech at all, no matter how vile that 
speech may be. It only requires the FBI 
to provide a report to Congress on vio-
lent domestic terrorist activity that 
the FBI is already investigating. 
In fact, this bill does not provide any 
new law enforcement or surveillance 
powers to the government. It does not 
establish any new criminal offenses. 
This morning there is an outrage 
over the violence that took place in 
Texas. The question is, Can we channel 
this outrage into an active, productive 
effort to pass legislation to make 
America safer? 
We know what the problem is. We 
know what the challenge is with do-
mestic terrorism. The question is, Can 
we gather the information to put an 
end to it? Isn’t that our responsibility, 
what comes to our responsibility as 
Senators and as citizens in this coun-
try? 
In the U.S. Senate, let’s start with 
this bill. Domestic terrorism is for 
real. We saw a form of it in Buffalo, 
NY, and we are going to see it again, I 
am afraid, unless we take it very seri-
ously. 
Fighting terrorism used to be a bi-
partisan effort, and I hope it will once 
again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I

of Labor’s Employee Benefit Security 
Administration, or EBSA. 
EBSA has the massive task of help-
ing retirees recover the benefits they 
are entitled to and forcing protections 
for people who get their healthcare 
coverage through their job, and over-
seeing millions of retirement plans, 
health plans, and other welfare benefit 
plans. 
We need a strong leader at EBSA who 
will protect families’ savings and fu-
tures and make sure people get the 
benefits they deserve under Federal 
law. 
We need someone like Lisa Gomez. 
Ms. Gomez is a highly respected profes-
sional in the field of employee benefits 
law, who has represented a wide range 
of health plans, retirement plans, and 
more. And I am confident as Assistant 
Secretary she will fight to hold em-
ployers accountable to the law, ensure 
workers get the benefits they are owed, 
and protect families’ financial secu-
rity, and I strongly urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in voting to confirm 
her. 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Madam President, I can’t leave the 
floor of the Senate today without talk-
ing about the heartbreaking shooting 
that took place at Robb Elementary 
School in Texas yesterday. 
Nineteen children, two teachers at an 
elementary school. These were kids 
who 
were 
excited 
for 
summer, 
playdates with their friends—murdered 
by weapons of war. 
This carnage is happening right here 
in America in fourth grade classrooms. 
My heart breaks for the family and 
loved ones of these kids and their 
teachers, not to mention the kids and 
educators who will carry the trauma of 
that day with them for the rest of their 
lives. 
But I am also furious. A lot of people 
have characterized this tragedy as ‘‘un-
thinkable.’’ But at this point, this kind 
of tragedy is not unthinkable. Parents 
in Washington State and everywhere 
else in America think about this all 
the time. They think about it every 
day when they drop off their kids at 
school. How can you not? They thought 
about it after the shooting in Buffalo 
at a grocery store 10 days earlier. They 
think about it every time there is an-
other mass shooting, which is far, far 
too often—3,865 times since the Sandy 
Hook school shooting 10 years ago, to 
be exact. 
What is unthinkable is that every 
time this happens, nothing changes. 
Every time, Republicans stand in the 
way of meaningful action. That is not 
just unthinkable; it is unacceptable. 
But we don’t have to live like this. 
This is a solvable problem. Republicans 
need to have the courage, the decency, 
the basic concern for the lives of our 
kids to work with Democrats on com-
monsense gun safety reforms. 
They need to decide should school be 
a place where our kids and teachers 
feel safe, where they can talk about 
homework and class projects, where 
they can be kids and laugh about what-
ever happened during lunch or art 
class? Or will they continue to be a 
place where school shooter drills are as 
routine as recess or algebra for our 
kids? 
I want my colleagues to consider 
that. 
What message are you sending to 
parents and kids, to teachers and stu-
dents if you won’t even allow a debate 
on commonsense measures like uni-
versal background checks? 
I have heard Republican lawmakers 
talk about the need to have police offi-
cers at every school. I wish it were that 
simple, but we know it is not. 
We saw yesterday that having an 
armed officer onsite at schools will not 
solve this crisis, despite the best ef-
forts of law enforcement. 
Some Republicans have suggested 
arming teachers. Are you kidding? Can 
you hear yourself? Teachers did not 
sign up to be soldiers, and guns have no 
place in our classroom. 
Some Republicans will say: Well, this 
is a mental health issue. So let me be 
clear: America is facing a mental 
health and substance use disorder cri-
sis. It is serious. It requires urgency, 
and I am actively working on bipar-
tisan legislation to expand access to 
prevention and treatment and recovery 
services. 
But I want to make this plain: The 
majority of people with mental illness 
do not commit violence against others. 
Treating gun violence as a mental 
health issue rather than a gun issue 
will never get us to the root cause of 
these horrific shootings. 
If we want to get at the heart of real-
ly stopping gun violence, I beg my col-
leagues to pull their heads out of the 
sand and finally start talking about 
what can really address this crisis of 
gun violence: commonsense gun safety 
legislation—and there is no getting 
around 
it—universal 
background 
checks and an assault weapons ban. 
Now, I am ready to work with any 
Republican to make any kind of mean-
ingful progress here. States like mine 
have made good progress on gun safety 
measures to keep our communities 
safe, but we cannot count on a patch-
work of laws where one State requires 
background checks and another one 
right next door does not. We need Fed-
eral action. We need to get something 
done. 
To my constituents in Washington 
State and the American people, I know 
and understand it can be disheartening 
to parents around the country to see 
the continued Republican obstruction 
on gun safety in Congress. Change is 
not easy, but let me be clear: Doing 
nothing and letting this continue to 
happen is the most extreme option on 
the table. 
I have come to the floor of the Sen-
ate countless times to call for action to 
keep our kids and our families safe 
from gun violence, just to have Repub-
licans block our efforts again and 
again. It is frustrating. It is infuri-
ating. But I will keep pushing for gun 
safety laws that the majority of Ameri-
cans do support because we cannot give 
up. That is what the NRA and other ex-
tremists want us to do. The vast ma-
jority of Americans have made clear, 
they want an end to gun violence. 
And I refuse to let Republicans get 
away with this yet again, to dance 
around the real issue, to distract us 
with 
conversations 
about 
arming 
teachers or tripwires outside elemen-
tary schools. Enough. Enough. 
We need to force Republicans to bear 
witness to the tragic consequences of 
their inaction. We need people and 
families across the country to do the 
same. No one gets to look away. No one 
gets to change the subject. I promise 
all of the students and parents, grand-
parents, teachers, everyone in Wash-
ington State that despite the obstruc-
tion and silence from my Republican 
colleagues, I will not stay quiet and I 
will keep pushing for change and I real-
ly hope the American people will do 
the same. 
Using our voices and our votes, we 
can change things. We can hold Repub-
licans accountable, and we can make 
progress to end gun violence. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it seems 
very appropriate that Senator MURRAY, 
our chair of the HELP Committee—she 
and I—I am the chair of the Finance 
Committee—often work together on 
these issues. As Northwest colleagues, 
we see how serious and how incredibly 
damaging the last 24 hours have been 
to our country. 
I am going to speak in a few minutes 
about a Health and Human Services 
nomination, but I want to pick up 
where Senator MURRAY left off with re-
spect to guns and specifically talk 
about the atrocity—the atrocity—that 
took place yesterday in Texas. 
I think Senators can barely begin to 
imagine the pain the families in Texas 
are feeling at this moment. They are 
living every parent’s worst nightmare. 
This morning, around the country 
millions 
and 
millions 
of 
parents 
dropped kids off at school, and they 
were fearful. In a country that we all 
believe is and must continue to be the 
greatest country on Earth, parents 
drop their kids off at school in fear 
that a gunman would walk into their 
classrooms and murder them. 
Let’s think about that. 
And it has been going on for dec-
ades—decades—in our country. We can 
remember the sinking, empty feeling 
after Sandy Hook. For a few days, 
there was a glimmer of hope that the 
Senate would do something on a bipar-
tisan basis, but then the other side 
caved to the gun lobby. Congress has 
done nothing in response to all this 
carnage in our schools, in our grocery 
stores, in our churches. Atrocity after 
atrocity after atrocity, and yet people 
still live in fear that their kids are 
next. They live with hopelessness due

to the fact that their elected officials 
are unwilling to act. 
There are no excuses left. This hap-
pened in a State that is flooded with 
guns. There was armed security at the 
school and still 19 kids and two teach-
ers are dead, still their families are 
broken. No excuses. 
Perhaps that is why I have heard 
multiple Republicans say today that 
there is nothing you can do to stop the 
shootings; that they are just going to 
happen. That is the way it is. They are 
going to happen regardless. 
I just believe with all my being that 
is just nonsense, and it is ridiculous 
coming from so many Senators who 
haven’t lifted a finger to do anything 
about the violence. 
My wife always says I am a glass- 
half-full guy. I try to be positive, al-
ways about bringing the two sides to-
gether. But on this issue, I don’t know 
what else to say. The truth is that if 
we act, then maybe—maybe—it will be 
possible to prevent another massacre 
in another school. That should be 
enough. That should be enough. 
The 100 of us here in the Senate are 
the ones with the power to act—not 
anybody else. It is about us. So, Sen-
ators, we have got a choice, either we 
can choose to act on moral courage or 
just let the fear and hopelessness win 
out. As far as I am concerned, if you 
don’t have the moral courage to act 
here on the Senate floor or at least try 
to prevent more of these massacres, 
then you ought to hang it up, go home, 
and let somebody else have the job. 
NOMINATION OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS 
Mr. President, let me turn now to the 
nomination we will be voting on in a 
few moments, Samuel Bagenstos, to 
serve as general counsel of the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
Just a few words on why the Senate 
ought to support the nomination. He is 
an experienced public servant, an ac-
complished lawyer and educator. He 
currently serves as general counsel to 
the Office of Management and Budget. 
He previously served as Principal Dep-
uty Assistant Attorney General for 
Civil Rights. He has been a leader in 
the State of Michigan on the issue of 
workers’ rights. He has argued cases 
before the Supreme Court. He is a high-
ly respected law professor on leave 
from the University of Michigan. 
He has got the experience to serve as 
HHS general counsel and the right out-
look on what public service in the law 
is all about. I am particularly pleased 
that he has been a crusader for the 
rights of Americans with disabilities. 
He has argued cases before the Court 
on the subject. He literally wrote the 
book—the most prominent law school 
casebook—on disability rights law. 
During the Finance Committee hear-
ing on his nomination, he talked about 
how that experience and perspective 
will guide his work in the Department 
if he is confirmed. I am sure pleased to 
see somebody like this attracted to 
public service, protecting vulnerable 
people—people who fall between the 
cracks all too often, all too often. That 
is the key to improving the health and 
well-being of all Americans. 
This nominee, Mr. Bagenstos, is the 
right choice for Health and Human 
Services general counsel. He is highly 
qualified, deserving of broad support. 
We will be voting on his nomination in 
a few minutes. I urge all Senators to 
support this nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Thanks, Mr. President. 
I always enjoy following my friend 
from Oregon who has done such impor-
tant work on tax and trade law and 
Medicare and Medicaid and everything 
since his career began as a young Gray 
Panther. 
NOMINATION OF TODD M. HARPER 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues 
to support Todd Harper’s nomination. 
He came out of my and Senator 
SMITH’s and the Presiding Officer Sen-
ator OSSOFF’s committee to be Chair-
man of the National Credit Union Ad-
ministration. 
Mr. Harper is an experienced regu-
lator. He has the background, knowl-
edge, and leadership experience to safe-
guard the credit union system, a very 
important component of our financial 
system, and to protect millions of cred-
it union members. 
We know that credit unions, more 
than Wall Street banks, really look out 
for the little guy and regular people 
and people who are, you know, mostly 
solidly middle class or aspiring to the 
middle class. 
A career public servant with mid-
western roots, Todd Harper under-
stands the vital role that credit unions 
play in local communities, especially 
rural and underserved communities. 
Being the first openly gay leader of 
any Federal financial regulatory Agen-
cy, the first NCUA career staff member 
to serve on the NCUA Board, he brings 
a vitally important perspective. We 
know that prior to this President tak-
ing over and my becoming chair of the 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee, we know most of the Fed-
eral regulators look like me and walk 
like Wall Street. Those days are behind 
us. Another reason for Todd Harper’s 
nomination to NCUA. 
Throughout his career as an NCUA 
Board member and Chair, he has 
worked with both parties. He has 
worked for advocates and industry to 
strengthen credit unions to fight for 
consumers. In 2019, the Senate con-
firmed Mr. Harper by voice vote to the 
three-member NCUA Board. In 2021, 
President Biden designated him as 
Chair. 
As Chair of the NCUA, he has worked 
with his fellow Board members to ad-
vance bipartisan efforts on important 
issues facing credit unions and their 
members, like digital assets and emer-
gency capital investment. 
Prior to serving on the Board, he was 
Director of the Office of Public and 
Congressional Affairs. He was Chief 
Policy Advisor to former Chairs Debo-
rah Matz and Rick Metsger. 
Mr. Harper previously served as a 
staffer in the House of Representatives, 
as staff director for the Subcommittee 
on Capital Markets. 
If confirmed, he will continue to 
work collaboratively. It is what we ask 
him to do, to represent all taxpayers to 
ensure that our credit union system is 
safe, sound, and works for all its mem-
bers. 
Mr. President, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the nomination of 
Todd Harper. 
I yield the floor.

May 25, 2022 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I also ask 
unanimous consent that the rest of the 
votes for this evening be 10-minute 
votes.

Without objection, it is so ordered. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate continues the impor-
tant work of confirming highly quali-
fied, diverse nominees to the Federal 
Judiciary. Working closely with Senate 
Democrats, the Biden administration 
has prioritized the selection of judicial 
nominees who are faithful to the rule 
of law, who are evenhanded and impar-
tial, and who understand the critical 
distinction between being an advocate 
and being a judge. And together, we are 
building a Federal judiciary that is 
more representative of the Nation as a 
whole, both in terms of demographic 
and professional diversity. The five 
nominees under consideration by the 
Senate this week are no exception, and 
I want to speak briefly on each of 
them. 
Yesterday, 
the 
Senate 
confirmed 
Judge Stephanie Davis to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
Since 2019, Judge Davis has served as a 
U.S. District Court Judge in the East-
ern District of Michigan. She was nom-
inated for the District Court by Presi-
dent Trump. And she was voted out of 
the Judiciary Committee by voice vote 
and confirmed by voice vote as well. 
Prior to serving on the District 
Court, Judge Davis served as a U.S. 
magistrate judge for approximately 3 
years, also in the Eastern District of 
Michigan. In total, Judge Davis has 
served as a Federal judge for more than 
6 years. Before assuming the bench, 
Judge Davis was an Assistant U.S. At-
torney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the Eastern District of Michigan for 
nearly two decades. During her last 5 
years in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, she 
served as the Executive Assistant U.S. 
Attorney. She also spent 3 years as the 
deputy chief of the Controlled Sub-
stances Unit. While serving as a Fed-
eral prosecutor, Judge Davis pros-
ecuted elder fraud cases, served on a 
committee that addressed a backlog of 
untested rape kits, and led one of the 
earliest prosecutions combating the 
opioid epidemic in the Eastern District 
of Michigan. Judge Davis also spent 5 
years in private practice. During this 
time, she volunteered with the Wom-
en’s Justice Center, helping victims of 
domestic violence obtain personal pro-
tection orders. 
Born in Kansas City, MO, Judge 
Davis earned her college degree from 
Wichita State University and her law 
degree from Washington University 
School of Law. 
Judge Davis has been unanimously 
rated ‘‘Well Qualified’’ for the Sixth 
Circuit by the American Bar Associa-
tion, and she has the strong support of 
her two home State Senators, Ms. STA-
BENOW and Mr. PETERS. 
Once sworn in, Judge Davis will be 
the first Black woman from Michigan 
to serve on the Sixth Circuit—and only 
the second ever Black woman to serve 
on the court. 
With Judge Davis’s extensive experi-
ence as a judge, a prosecutor, and a lit-
igator in private practice, as well as 
her decades-long commitment to public 
service, she is clearly well qualified to 
serve on the Sixth Circuit. 
This morning, the Senate also con-
firmed the nomination of Evelyn Padin 
to the District of New Jersey. A native 
of New Jersey, Ms. Padin received her 
B.A. from Rutgers University, her 
M.S.W. from Fordham University Grad-
uate School of Social Services, her cer-
tificate in European legal studies from 
Tulane University, and her J.D. from 
Seton Hall Law School. Since grad-
uating from law school, Ms. Padin has 
spent nearly three decades practicing 
law. 
In 1995, Ms. Padin opened her own law 
firm, and she has appeared regularly in 
both State and Federal courts ever 
since. She has tried approximately 10 
jury trials to verdict, judgment, or 
final decision. In addition to her 
lengthy career as a litigator, Ms. Padin 
also has judicial experience, having 
served as a municipal court judge for 
the Jersey City Municipal Court. In 
this role, she presided over nearly 3,000 
cases—all bench trials—that went to 
verdict or judgment, primarily involv-
ing minor criminal-type offenses, traf-
fic violations, and municipal ordinance 
offenses. 
Outside the courtroom, Ms. Padin 
has been active in the legal commu-
nity. She was the first Latina to serve 
as the president of the New Jersey 
State Bar Association. In that role, she 
worked to improve access to justice in 
New Jersey, including by starting legal 
clinics to serve the economically dis-
advantaged. 
Ms. Padin received a ‘‘Qualified’’ rat-
ing from the American Bar Association 
and has the strong support of her home 
State Senators, Mr. MENENDEZ and Mr. 
BOOKER. Ms. Padin’s years of experi-
ence with New Jersey’s legal system, 
coupled with her broad legal expertise, 
make her well-suited to serve on the 
Federal bench. 
And the Senate also confirmed the 
nomination of Charlotte Sweeney to 
the District of Colorado. Ms. Sweeney 
is a trial litigator who has spent over 
26 years defending the employment 
rights of Americans who have faced 
discrimination or harassment—based 
on their race, national origin, gender, 
age, or disability—in the workplace. 
Practicing primarily in Federal court, 
she has tried more than 20 cases to ver-
dict or judgment. 
Through her work, Ms. Sweeney has 
earned a reputation for integrity and 
fairmindedness, both from her peers 
and from those before whom she has 
practiced. Twenty-six attorneys who 
regularly work as opposing counsel to 
Ms. Sweeney have offered their ‘‘strong 
support’’ of her nomination, writing 
that she ‘‘will be an impartial, pre-
pared, and reasoned jurist.’’ Similarly, 
17 former judges and employment law-
yers who have acted as settlement or 
arbitration proceeding neutrals have 
also endorsed her nomination. Based on 
Ms. Sweeney’s advocacy before them, 
they believe she ‘‘will make an excep-
tional district court judge.’’ 
With so much support from the Colo-
rado legal community and as a Colo-
rado native herself, it is no surprise 
that Ms. Sweeney has the strong sup-
port of her home State Senators, Mr. 
BENNET and Mr. HICKENLOOPER, or that 
she was rated ‘‘Well Qualified’’ by the 
American Bar Association. 
Additionally, Ms. Sweeney will ad-
vance President Biden’s commitment 
to ensuring the Federal judiciary re-
flects the country it serves. She will be 
the first openly LGBTQ article III 
judge in Colorado and the first openly 
LGBTQ woman to serve as a Federal 
district court judge in any State west 
of the Mississippi. 
The Senate is also considering Nina 
Morrison, nominated to the Eastern 
District of New York. Ms. Morrison at-
tended Yale College and New York Uni-
versity Law School before clerking for 
Judge Pierre N. Leval on the Second 
Circuit Court of Appeals. She then 
worked in private practice and at the 
American Civil Liberties Union before 
joining the Innocence Project. 
Ms. Morrison is now one of the most 
senior attorneys at the Innocence 
Project, where she works to exonerate 
wrongfully imprisoned individuals by 
petitioning for access to DNA evidence 
and 
other 
post-conviction 
relief. 
Thanks to Ms. Morrison’s efforts, near-
ly 30 wrongfully convicted individuals 
in more than 10 States have been freed 
from prison or death row. In addition, 
her work has helped to correctly iden-
tify the perpetrators of violent crimes, 
delivering justice to both their victims 
and to those who have been wrongfully 
imprisoned. 
Ms. Morrison is a seasoned litigator 
who has practiced in State and Federal 
courts all across the country. The 
American 
Bar 
Association 
unani-
mously rated her ‘‘Well Qualified’’ to 
serve as a district judge, and she has 
the strong support of both of her home 
State Senators, Mr. SCHUMER and Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND. 
Ms. Morrison has dedicated her ca-
reer to ensuring that our justice sys-
tem lives up to America’s ideals. Her 
dedication, breadth of experience, and 
unique perspective will make her an 
asset to the Eastern District of New 
York. 
Finally, the Senate will consider 
Robert Huie, nominated to the South-
ern District of California. Mr. Huie is 
an accomplished litigator who pre-
viously served as an Assistant U.S. At-
torney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the district to which he has been nomi-
nated. Notably, he was counsel of

record in more than 600 district court 
cases and was lead appellate counsel in 
approximately two dozen appeals. 
After leaving the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice, Mr. Huie went into private prac-
tice, where he is currently Of Counsel 
in the San Diego office of Jones Day 
and a leader in the firm’s Investiga-
tions and White Collar Defense Prac-
tice. He is also the San Diego office’s 
pro bono coordinator and chair of the 
diversity and inclusion committee. A 
graduate of Yale Law School and a law-
yer with extensive criminal and civil 
experience, Huie is well-positioned to 
join the Federal bench. He has tried 22 
cases—both jury and nonjury—to ver-
dict, judgment, or final decision. 
Mr. Huie has the strong support of 
Senators Feinstein and Padilla, and he 
was rated unanimously ‘‘Well Quali-
fied’’ by the American Bar Association. 
His legal work both in and out of the 
courtroom, coupled with his decades- 
long career serving the Southern Dis-
trict of California, make him an out-
standing nominee. 
I am pleased that three of these 
nominees received bipartisan confirma-
tion votes and another nominee has al-
ready received a bipartisan cloture 
vote. And I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting those nominations 
that have not yet come up for a vote. 
With their records, experience, and 
evenhanded approach, all of these 
nominees will be ready on day one to 
serve this Nation as Federal judges.

conditions requiring that obligations under

for a comprehensive trade agreement;

gress, should work to conclude negotiations 
for such comprehensive trade agreements 
contingent upon an agreement between the 
European Union and the United Kingdom 
that fully protects and preserves the Good 
Friday Agreement consistent with the senti-
ments expressed by the Senate in S. Res. 117 
(117th Congress); and 
(4) the President, in consultation with Con-
gress, should strive to reach mutually advan-
tageous resolutions of commercial disagree-
ments between the United States and the

ital Services Tax on United States busi-
nesses and ensuring a satisfactory final reso-
lution to the World Trade Organization large

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
know of no further debate on the reso-
lution, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

Hearing none, the question is on

S2699 
May 25, 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
the 
Lee 
amendment to the preamble be consid-
ered and agreed to; the preamble, as 
amended, be agreed to, the Lee amend-
ment to the title be considered and 
agreed to, the title, as amended, be 
agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 5046) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, on March 5, 1946, Sir Winston 
Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech 
in Fulton, Missouri, solidifying the ‘‘Special 
Relationship’’ between the United States and 
the United Kingdom; 
Whereas, since the end of World War II, the 
United States and the United Kingdom have 
been beacons of freedom to the world, stand-
ing together in the fight against tyranny; 
Whereas the Special Relationship between 
the United States and the United Kingdom 
has driven economic prosperity and security 
cooperation in both nations for more than 70 
years; 
Whereas, according to ‘‘Sterling Assets,’’ a 
report from the Confederation of British In-
dustry, the United States and the United 
Kingdom share the world’s largest bilateral 
trade and investment relationship; 
Whereas, while the United States and the 
United Kingdom already share a robust eco-
nomic partnership and strong labor ties, 
there remain clear opportunities for both 
countries to further strengthen those ties; 
Whereas the United States Trade Rep-
resentative and United Kingdom Department 
for International Trade have engaged in sub-
stantive negotiations towards the conclusion 
of a comprehensive trade agreement since 
May 2020; 
Whereas the United States seeks to sup-
port higher-paying jobs in the United States 
and to grow the United States economy by 
improving United States opportunities for 
trade and investment with the European 
Union; 
Whereas the economic relationship of the

The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The title amendment (No. 5047) was 
agreed to, as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the title) 
Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘A resolu-
tion expressing the sense of the Senate that 
the President should work with the Govern-
ment of the United Kingdom to conclude ne-
gotiations for a comprehensive trade agree-
ment between the United States and the 
United Kingdom that the President should 
work with the President of the European 
Commission to conclude negotiations for a 
comprehensive trade agreement between the 
United States and the European Union.’’. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 134 
Whereas, on March 5, 1946, Sir Winston 
Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech 
in Fulton, Missouri, solidifying the ‘‘Special 
Relationship’’ between the United States and 
the United Kingdom; 
Whereas, since the end of World War II, the 
United States and the United Kingdom have 
been beacons of freedom to the world, stand-
ing together in the fight against tyranny; 
Whereas the Special Relationship between 
the United States and the United Kingdom 
has driven economic prosperity and security 
cooperation in both nations for more than 70 
years; 
Whereas, according to ‘‘Sterling Assets,’’ a 
report from the Confederation of British In-
dustry, the United States and the United 
Kingdom share the world’s largest bilateral 
trade and investment relationship; 
Whereas, while the United States and the 
United Kingdom already share a robust eco-
nomic partnership and strong labor ties, 
there remain clear opportunities for both 
countries to further strengthen those ties; 
Whereas the United States Trade Rep-
resentative and United Kingdom Department 
for International Trade have engaged in sub-
stantive negotiations towards the conclusion 
of a comprehensive trade agreement since 
May 2020; 
Whereas the United States seeks to sup-
port higher-paying jobs in the United States 
and to grow the United States economy by 
improving United States opportunities for 
trade and investment with the European 
Union; 
Whereas the economic relationship of the 
United States and the European Union is the 
largest and most complex in the world, with 
over $1,100,000,000,000 in annual two-way 
trade; 
Whereas the United States Trade Rep-
resentative and the European Union have en-
gaged in substantive negotiations toward the 
conclusion of a trade agreement; 
Whereas the United States has historically 
acted as a guarantor of the 1998 Good Friday 
Agreement, an agreement between the Brit-
ish and Irish governments, designed to pro-
tect peace in Northern Ireland by avoiding a 
hard border on the island of Ireland; 
Whereas Prime Minister Boris Johnson of 
the United Kingdom, President of the Euro-
pean Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and 
President of the European Council Charles 
Michel signed the Brexit Withdrawal Agree-
ment on January 24, 2020; 
Whereas as part of the Brexit Withdrawal 
Agreement, in order to protect the Good Fri-
day Agreement in the aftermath of the 
United Kingdom’s departure from the Euro-
pean Union, the two parties agreed to the 
Northern Ireland Protocol; and 
Whereas the constitutional power of mak-
ing trade agreements with foreign nations 
rests with Congress: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the United States should strengthen its 
close and mutually beneficial trading and 
economic partnership with the United King-
dom that takes into account, as relevant, 
conditions requiring that obligations under 
the Good Friday Agreement be met; 
(2) the United States should strengthen its 
close and mutually beneficial trading and 
economic partnership with the European 
Union by working to conclude negotiations 
for a comprehensive trade agreement; 
(3) the President, in consultation with Con-
gress, should work to conclude negotiations 
for such comprehensive trade agreements 
contingent upon an agreement between the 
European Union and the United Kingdom 
that fully protects and preserves the Good 
Friday Agreement consistent with the senti-
ments expressed by the Senate in S. Res. 117 
(117th Congress); and 
(4) the President, in consultation with Con-
gress, should strive to reach mutually advan-
tageous resolutions of commercial disagree-
ments between the United States and the 
United Kingdom, including ending the Dig-
ital Services Tax on United States busi-
nesses and ensuring a satisfactory final reso-
lution to the World Trade Organization large 
civil aircraft dispute.

GEN-
ERAL MARIA CONSUELO PORRAS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many 
hoped 
that 
President 
Giammattei 
would reject the corruption and impu-
nity that his predecessors institu-
tionalized. The reappointment of At-
torney General Porras, who according 
to the State Department has ‘‘repeat-
edly obstructed and undermined anti- 
corruption investigations,’’ shows that 
it is business as usual. 
Democracy cannot survive without 
an independent judiciary, which Attor-
ney General Porras has sought to dis-
mantle by persecuting prosecutors and 
judges who have stood up for the prin-
ciple that no one is above the law. As 
long as this continues, Guatemala’s 
government is not a serious anti-cor-
ruption partner of the United States. 
f 
BETA TECHNOLOGIES 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a person 
wandering up Church Street or jogging 
down on the shores of Lake Champlain 
on a crisp, snowy day in Burlington, 
VT, 
this 
past 
winter 
could 
have 
glanced up at the sky and seen an an-
gular, white aircraft gliding through 
the air. It is called the Alia and is an 
electric aircraft modeled after an Artic 
tern that has been designed and manu-
factured by Beta Technologies. 
At their headquarters, located beside 
the Burlington International Airport 
in 
South 
Burlington, 
Beta 
Tech-
nologies has been ‘‘quietly’’ revolution-
izing the aviation industry by design-
ing an environmentally friendly, re-
chargeable, and, yes, quiet, electric 
aircraft that can vertically take off 
and land without a runway. It is in-
credible technology that has game- 
changing applications for the domestic 
shipping industry, private transpor-
tation, and the military. Their re-
search, production, and testing has 
been supported by dozens of private in-
vestors, several public companies, and 
funding appropriated by the Appropria-
tions Committee to the Air Force’s 
AFWERX Agility Prime program. The 
Agility Prime program was launched in 
2020 in an effort to encourage private 
commercial development of the elec-
tric vertical takeoff and landing— 
eVTOL—aircraft industry. 
I am proud of the innovative work 
that 
Beta 
Technologies 
does 
in 
Vermont. The company employs a 
workforce of over 350 employees and is 
growing, employing veterans, pilots, 
engineers, and technicians. The com-
pany is enriching the engineering and 
technology community of Vermont. I 
am excited about the potential for 
Beta’s aircrafts and look forward to 
supporting their work in the future. 
On April 16, 2022, The New York 
Times published an article on the inno-
vative work of Beta Technologies, and 
I ask unanimous consent that it be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 16, 2022] 
THE BATTERY THAT FLIES 
(By Ben Ryder Howe) 
KITTY HAWK.—The invention of the jet en-
gine. And on a frozen Vermont morning, cir-
cling above Lake Champlain, the Alia. 
In the mind of Christopher Caputo, a pilot, 
each moment signals a paradigm shift in 
aviation. ‘‘You’re looking at history,’’ Mr. 
Caputo said recently, speaking from the 
cockpit of a plane trailing the Alia at close 
distance. It had an exotic, almost whimsical 
shape, like an Alexander Calder sculpture, 
and it banked and climbed in near silence. 
It is, essentially, a flying battery. And it 
represented a long-held aviation goal: an air-
craft with no need for jet fuel and therefore 
no carbon emissions, a plane that could take 
off and land without a runway and quietly 
hop from recharging station to recharging 
station, like a large drone. 
The Alia was made by Beta Technologies, 
where Mr. Caputo is a flight instructor. A 
five-year-old start-up that is unusual in 
many respects, the company is the brain-
child of Martine Rothblatt, the founder of 
Sirius XM and pharmaceutical company 
United Therapeutics, and Kyle Clark, a Har-
vard-trained engineer and former profes-
sional hockey player. It has a unique mis-
sion, focused on cargo rather than pas-
sengers. And despite raising a formidable 
treasure chest in capital, it is based in Bur-
lington, Vt., population 45,000, roughly 2,500 
miles from Silicon Valley. 
A battery-powered aircraft with no inter-
nal combustion has been a goal of engineers 
ever since the Wright brothers. Larry Page, 
the Google co-founder, has been funding elec-
tric plane start-ups for over a decade. Elec-
tric motors have the virtue of being smaller, 
allowing more of them to be fitted on a plane 
and making it easier to design systems with 
vertical lift. However, batteries are heavy, 
planes need to be light, and for most of the 
last century, the e-plane was thought to be 
beyond reach. 
That changed with the extraordinary gains 
in aviation technology realized since the 
1990s. Late last year, curious about the po-
tential of so-called green aviation, I flew in 
a Pipistrel Alpha Electro, a sleek new Slove-
nian two-seater designed for flight training. 
The Electro looks and flies like an ordinary 
light aircraft, but absent the roar of internal 
combustion, its single propeller makes a 
sound like beating wings. ‘‘Whoa!’’ I ex-
claimed when its high-torque engine caused 
it to practically leap off the runway. 
However, the Electro’s power supply lasts 
only about an hour. After ours nearly ran 
out, I wondered how many people would 
enjoy flying in an electric plane. That take 
off is fun. But then you do start to worry 
about the landing. 
Despite the excitement about e-planes, the 
Federal Aviation Administration has never 
certified electric propulsion as safe for com-
mercial use. Companies expect that to 
change in the coming years, but only gradu-
ally, as safety concerns are worked out. As 
that process occurs, new forms of aviation 
are likely to appear, planes never seen before 
outside of testing grounds. Those planes will 
have limitations as to how far and fast they 
can fly, but they will do things other planes 
can’t, like hover and take off from ‘‘runways 
in the sky.’’ 
They will also, perhaps most importantly 
for an industry dependent on fossil fuels, cut 
down on commercial aviation’s enormous 
contribution to climate change, currently 
calculated as 3 to 4 percent of greenhouse 
gases globally. 
‘‘It’s gross,’’ Mr. Clark said. ‘‘If we don’t, 
the consequences are that we’ll destroy the 
planet.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2701 
May 25, 2022 
In 2013, Ms. Rothblatt became interested in 
battery-powered 
aircraft. 
United 
Thera-
peutics makes human organs, including a 
kidney grown inside a pig that was attached 
to a person last fall, the first time such a 
procedure has been done. Ms. Rothblatt 
wanted an electric heli-plane ‘‘to deliver the 
organs we are manufacturing in a green 
way,’’ she said, and fly them a considerable 
distance—say, between two mid-Atlantic cit-
ies. 
At the time, though, batteries were still 
too heavy. The longest an electric helicopter 
had flown was 15 minutes. One group of engi-
neers told her it would take three years of 
design and development, too long, in her 
mind, to wait. 
‘‘Every single person told me it was impos-
sible,’’ Ms. Rothblatt said. 
A GRAND VISION 
Kyle Clark flew alone for the first time in 
1997 on a plane from Burlington to Erie, Pa. 
Mr. Clark, then 16, had just been selected by 
the U.S.A. Hockey national team. ‘‘I was the 
worst player on the ice,’’ he said, ‘‘so I de-
cided to fight all the opposing players.’’ As a 
result, ‘‘the team named me captain.’’ 
At 6 feet 7 inches, a self-described physical 
‘‘freak,’’ Mr. Clark would go on to a brief 
professional hockey career as an extremely 
low-scoring right wing and enforcer. (His 
Linkedin 
page 
shows 
him 
brawling, 
helmetless, as a member of the Washington 
Capitals organization.) 
After a stint in Finland’s professional 
hockey league, he left the sport and received 
an 
undergraduate 
degree 
in 
materials 
science at Harvard, where he wrote a thesis 
on a plane piloted like a motorcycle and 
fueled by alternative energy. It was named 
the engineering department’s paper of the 
year. 
He then found himself considering a career 
on Wall Street, doing something he didn’t 
want to do away from where he wanted to be: 
back in Vermont. 
‘‘There’s a brain drain’’ among engineers 
from his home state, he said. ‘‘People go 
away to college and come back when they’re 
40, because they realize San Francisco or 
Boston isn’t the cat’s meow.’’ Returning to 
Burlington in his mid–20s, Mr. Clark became 
director of engineering at a company that 
designed power converters for Tesla. 
In 2017 he attended a conference where Ms. 
Rothblatt made her pitch for an e-helicopter. 
‘‘There were like 30 people in the room, none 
of whom excited me,’’ Ms. Rothblatt re-
called. ‘‘Then Kyle stood up and said, ‘I’m an 
electronics and power systems person, and 
I’m confident we can achieve your specifica-
tion with a demonstration flight within one 
to two years.’ Other people were shaking 
their head. He was probably the youngest 
guy in the room. So I came up to him during 
break and said, ‘Where’s your company lo-
cated?’ And he said, ‘I live in Vermont.’ ’’ 
A few weeks later, after a second meeting, 
Mr. Clark drew a watercolor of his design 
and sent it to Ms. Rothblatt. Within hours, 
$1.5 million in seed capital for Beta Tech-
nologies had been wired to his bank account. 
‘‘He drew a nice design,’’ Ms. Rothblatt 
said. 
A prototype with four tilting propellers 
was assembled in eight months, with Mr. 
Clark piloting the vehicle himself. Built in 
Burlington, the plane had to be flown over 
Lake Champlain, away from population cen-
ters. 
‘‘It was so fun to fly it that we found an ex-
cuse to every chance we could,’’ Mr. Clark 
told an audience at M.I.T. in 2019. Ulti-
mately, though, it turned out to have too 
complex a design and Mr. Clark threw it out. 
He created a streamlined prototype modeled 
after the Arctic tern, a small, slow bird capa-
ble of flying uncanny distances without land-
ing. 
Since then, Beta’s work force has grown to 
over 350 from 30. The company’s head-
quarters have expanded to several buildings 
wrapping around the runway at Burlington 
International Airport, with plans for an ad-
ditional 40–acre campus. 
The board is stocked with players in fi-
nance and tech, including Dean Kamen, the 
inventor of the Segway, and John Abele, 
founder of Boston Scientific. It has $400 mil-
lion of funding from the government and in-
stitutions, including Amazon. But it is not 
alone in trying to bring something like 
this—what’s known as a vehicle with ‘‘elec-
tric 
vertical 
takeoff 
and 
landing’’ 
or 
eVTOL—to market. 
Propelled by advances in batteries, control 
systems and high performance motors, more 
than a dozen well-financed competitors have 
their own prototypes, nearly all focused on 
what the industry calls ‘‘urban air mobil-
ity,’’ or flying taxis or privately owned fly-
ing vehicles. That no major breakthrough 
has reached consumers in significant num-
bers yet gives skeptics ammunition, but does 
not tamp down the optimism within the in-
dustry, especially not at Beta. Beta is alone 
in focusing on cargo, and is hoping to win 
F.A.A. approval in 2024. If it succeeds, it be-
lieves it will do more than make aviation 
history. 
In the company’s grand vision, electric 
cargo planes replace fleets of exhaust-spew-
ing short-haul box trucks currently con-
gesting America’s roads. 
With a limit of 250 nautical miles per bat-
tery charge, the vehicles would land atop 
solar-powered charging stations made out of 
shipping containers, some equipped with 
showers, bunks and kitchenettes. (The cabi-
netry is Vermont maple.) Beta also makes a 
stand-alone charger that ‘‘our group is plac-
ing at airports all over the country,’’ said 
Mr. Clark. 
A plane like Beta’s could be a catalyst for 
‘‘decentralizing’’ the hub and spoke system, 
the company hopes, taking dependence on 
shipping centers like Louisville and Mem-
phis out of the equation and rebuilding the 
supply chain. 
‘‘If you think about a path between two 
cities where there’s no direct air service,’’ 
Blain Newton, Beta’s chief operations officer 
said, ‘‘the only way is by taking one connec-
tion, two connections.’’ Alia can change 
that—especially by increasing access to less 
populated parts of the country, such as 
northern Vermont. 
The ambitions are lofty. Bolstering Mr. 
Newton’s claims, however, UPS has already 
bought 10 Alias to be delivered in 2024 and 
signaled its intent to buy 140 more, which it 
plans to use as ‘‘micro-feeders’’ for time-sen-
sitive deliveries such as medicine. 
Amazon has invested heavily in Beta 
through its Climate Pledge Fund. Both the 
Air Force and the Army have signed con-
tracts with the company worth a combined 
$43 million. And Blade, the commuter heli-
copter service, perhaps sensing that urban 
air mobility is not so far off, has reserved 
the right to buy five Alias, at a price of $4 
million to $5 million apiece. 
‘THE DNA OF VERMONT’ 
Beta’s headquarters at the Burlington Air-
port—close enough to be seen from the Ter-
minal B waiting area—still has the youthful 
informality of a start-up. On a December 
morning in the hangar, Naughty by Nature’s 
‘‘Feel Me Flow’’ somehow penetrated the din 
of whirring propellers and industrial tools. 
The heavily tattooed Mr. Clark, whose idea 
of formal wear seems to be rotating his base-
ball cap forward, pinballed around the hang-
ar, grabbing stray machinery and vaulting 
up staircases with the agility of a profes-
sional athlete. 
Before he joined Beta, Mr. Newton worked 
in health care. At his job interview, Mr. 
Clark took him for a helicopter ride. 
‘‘He gave me the controls and said: ‘Your 
aircraft. Figure it out,’ ’’ Mr. Newton re-
called, chuckling. ‘‘I’d never flown before. I 
ended up taking a 65 percent pay cut to work 
for him.’’ 
On their way back, with Mr. Clark back at 
the controls, the helicopter flew over Bur-
lington, a city built largely around the Uni-
versity of Vermont and companies known for 
their progressive bona fides, like Seventh 
Generation and Ben & Jerry’s. The city is fa-
mously left-leaning: Senator Bernie Sanders 
served four terms as its mayor. It also hosts 
a number of renewable energy startups. 
‘‘Clean energy is built into the DNA of 
Vermont,’’ said Russ Scully, a Burlington 
entrepreneur who raised capital for Beta. 
Burlington is closer to becoming net zero 
than almost any municipality in the coun-
try; in the Beta parking lot, many cars have 
charging cables inserted. 
Another local resource: One hundred miles 
north, near Montreal, is one of the largest 
aerospace clusters outside Toulouse and Se-
attle, led by Bombardier, the Canadian busi-
ness jet-maker, and CAE, the world’s pre-
mier manufacturer of flight simulators. 
For Blake Opsahl, a network planner who 
left Amazon to join Beta, doing so was a no- 
brainer. ‘‘My husband grew up here and 
we’ve always wanted to to come back,’’ said 
Mr. Opsahl, who described an affinity be-
tween Beta engineers and Vermonters as 
‘‘passionate tinkerers.’’ 
Mr. Newton said: ‘‘I don’t want to throw 
any of our competitors under the bus, but 
some folks out West are paying huge salaries 
to attract people, and we’re capturing a lot 
of high-end aerospace talent for the lifestyle. 
They said, No, I want to be part of this thing 
here.’’ 
Mr. Clark said he was offered opportunities 
to move the company elsewhere but de-
clined. It has now become one of Bur-
lington’s marquee employers, contributing 
to a population swelling with high-earning 
remote workers who left larger cities and 
brought with them a worsening housing cri-
sis. Burlington may be the kind of small city 
that Beta aims to serve, but as its success 
has shown, it is also the kind of city where 
sudden growth can bring challenges to liv-
ability. 
In high school, Mr. Clark began building 
planes with spare parts from the machine 
shop his father ran at the University of 
Vermont. His mother, an artist, burned one 
in the backyard to prevent him from flying 
it. 
Like Mr. Newton, many recruits were 
treated to hair-raising airplane rides. The 
company has a fleet of aircraft that the com-
munications director, Jake Goldman, calls 
an ‘‘amusement park for aviation fanatics,’’ 
including a World War II biplane and the ex-
perimental Pipistrel. (‘‘I did not puke,’’ Mr. 
Goldman said of his inaugural ride in an 
aerobatic plane, ‘‘but it was touch and go for 
a while.’’) 
The company offers free flying lessons to 
all its 350 employees, and has more than 20 
flight instructors on staff, including Nick 
Warren, formerly a Marine One pilot for 
President Barack Obama. The idea is that in 
order to promote ‘‘critical thinking in avia-
tion’’ it helps to be airborne. ‘‘It’s very 
Vermont—instead of just analyzing things 
on a computer, you actually try them out,’’ 
said Lan Vu, a Beta electrical engineer who 
attended public high school with Mr. Clark. 
Like many of her colleagues, Ms. Vu had 
worked previously for Mr. Clark, who re-
cruited her. (‘‘You know how good of a talk-
er he is,’’ she said.)

She had no prior interest in flying, she 
said, but ‘‘that was one of the things Kyle 
made sure to talk about when he was pitch-
ing me.’’ 
‘‘And I was like: ‘Yeah, I don’t have that 
kind of time. I have three kids,’ ’’ she said. 
After changing her mind and getting her 
pilot’s license through the employee pro-
gram, however, Ms. Vu began competing in 
aerial acrobatic competitions. As an engi-
neer, she said, flying helps her address safety 
concerns. ‘‘If I’m building this, would I fly 
it?’’ said Ms. Vu, who said she considered 
herself a conservative pilot, although, she 
admits, ‘‘I was kind of surprised how much I 
enjoyed flying upside down.’’ 
THE FUTURIST AND THE TEST PILOT 
Is the world ready for wingless hovercraft 
levitating 
over 
cities 
and 
hotrodding 
through congested air corridors? 
The consensus within the industry is that 
the F.A.A., which regulates half the world’s 
aviation activity, is several years from certi-
fying urban air mobility. 
‘‘It’s a big burden of proof to bring new 
technology to the F.A.A.—appropriately so,’’ 
Mr. Clark said. Currently the certification 
process for a new plane or helicopter takes 
two to three years on average. For an en-
tirely new type of vehicle, it could be consid-
erably longer. (One conventionally powered 
aircraft that can take off and land without a 
runway had its first flight in 2003. It remains 
uncertified.) 
Ms. Rothblatt has built a career out of the 
long view. She is a celebrated futurist who 
has argued passionately for transhumanism, 
or the belief that human beings will eventu-
ally merge with machines and upload con-
sciousness to a digital realm. And she has 
taken 
positions 
on 
issues 
such 
as 
xenotransplantation—the interchange of or-
gans between species, including humans— 
considered audacious not long ago, though 
no longer. 
Yet in certain ways she and Mr. Clark 
make for unlikely partners. Mr. Clark has a 
familiar demeanor for a test pilot: exuber-
ant, risk-taking, hyper-confident. 
Ms. Rothblatt, on the other hand, calls 
herself an exceedingly cautious person, both 
as a pilot and in general. ‘‘I’m an adven-
turous thinker, but I’m cautious in every-
thing,’’ she said. She brought up her life ex-
perience as an example. Aside from her ac-
complishments in medicine and aerospace, 
Ms. Rothblatt is known as a transgender pio-
neer; when she started Sirius XM and rose to 
prominence, she hadn’t yet transitioned. 
‘‘When I changed my sex, it was only after 
watching presentations by a dozen top sur-
geons and I was absolutely confident that it 
would be safe,’’ she said. 
The dichotomy between the futurist and 
the test pilot gets to a real issue facing any 
plane with a battery: Who will fly them? 
According to Dan Patt, a technology ana-
lyst, vehicles like the one Beta is building 
are ‘‘very unlikely to make money unless 
they go unmanned.’’ Aviation in general 
faces a pilot shortage, and labor comprises 
up to a third of operating costs at legacy air-
lines. 
The question for Beta as a business, said 
Mr. Patt, who led the development of drones 
for the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency, is: ‘‘What does it take for their 
model to be competitive with ground trans-
portation?’’ 
Beta says its vehicles are designed to be 
‘‘optionally manned’’ in the future. Yet ana-
lysts such as Mr. Patt see unpiloted commer-
cial aviation as even farther from winning 
F.A.A. approval than the electric plane 
itself, raising a dilemma: 
‘‘What’s more important, going unmanned 
first, or do you build the vehicle first? Beta 
is clearly in the latter camp.’’ 
Nathan Diller, an Air Force colonel, is not 
a futurist, but his job is to find and support 
companies doing forward-thinking, futuristic 
things. 
The military applications of a vehicle like 
the Alia—especially logistics—have gotten 
attention at the highest levels of the Air 
Force, which has backed Beta and some of 
its peers through an accelerator called Agil-
ity Prime. 
Last month, for the first time, uniformed 
Air Force pilots flew an Alia, soaring above 
Lake Champlain in a plane powered only by 
a battery. 
Colonel Diller sees this kind of transport 
as a national security issue, in part because 
of its potential to reduce fuel consumption, 
but what seems to intrigue him most is ‘‘the 
democratization of air travel.’’ 
He grew up flying experimental planes on 
an organic farm in West Texas, aware of the 
limits on where a plane can land and who 
can fly. Looking at a floating sculpture 
twirling above a lake, he sees a different fu-
ture for aviation: ‘‘Everyone a pilot, every-
where a runway.’’

TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–33 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Radio Frequency TOW 2A (RF) Mis-
sile (BGM–71–4B-RF) is a direct attack mis-
sile designed to defeat armored vehicles, re-
inforced urban structures, field fortification 
and other such targets. TOW Missiles are 
fired from a variety of TOW Launchers in the 
U.S. Army, USMC, and FMS partner forces. 
The TOW 2A RF missile can be launched 
from the same launcher platforms as the ex-
isting wire-guided TOW 2A missile without 
modification to the launcher. The TOW 2A 
missile (both wire and RF) contains two 
tracker beacons (Xenon and thermal) for the 
launcher to track and guide the missile in 
flight. Guidance commands from the launch-
er are provided to the missile by the RF link 
contained within the missile case. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Egypt can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of 
Egypt.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask

CONFIRMATION OF BRIDGET A. 
BRINK 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I opposed 
the confirmation of Bridget Brink to be 
U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine because of 
her support for the expansion of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
NATO. Ambassador Brink believes in 
expanding NATO to any country who 
would like to join, including Ukraine. 
An important part of diplomacy is 
understanding your adversary. When I 
questioned Ambassador Brink about 
the eastern expansion of NATO, how-
ever, she expressed her belief that Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin merely 
uses the NATO question as a pretext 
for actions he would take anyway. I 
strongly disagree. We must evaluate 
our leaders’ actions, as well as the ac-
tions of our adversaries, on the world 
stage. 
Putin is an aggressor and must be 
condemned, but we cannot allow our 
revulsion for his invasions to blind us 
to the fact that our adversaries react 
to the actions of the West. For years, 
Putin stated that any attempt to ex-
pand NATO to Russia’s borders would 
be perceived as a direct threat. Fifteen 
years ago, Putin asked, ‘‘Against whom 
is this expansion intended?’’ Yet, a 
year later in 2008, NATO promised that 
Ukraine and Georgia would one day 
join the alliance. Russia’s invasions of 
Georgia and Ukraine are not a coinci-
dence, but I left my meeting with Am-
bassador Brink believing that she is 
not willing to reflect upon the actions 
of the West and how they would be 
viewed by Russian eyes. 
Putin has no justification for em-
barking on a war and invading another 
country. I fully support the Ukrainians 
in their fight against Russia. Russia’s 
brutal use of its military to achieve its 
objectives is unacceptable. But we 
must understand the reasons why he 
chose to invade in the first place. 
When the Cold War ended, the United 
States had the benefit of the wisdom of 
foreign policy officials who took Rus-
sia seriously. George Kennan warned 
that NATO expansion would ignite a 
new cold war. Henry Kissinger pro-
posed a peaceful coexistence in which 
Ukraine pursued a policy of neutrality, 
with one foot in the West and one foot 
in the East. Jack Matlock, our Ambas-
sador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to 
1991, called the current crisis ‘‘predict-
able’’ and, in 1997, warned Congress 
that he believed that NATO expansion 
‘‘could well encourage a chain of events 
that could produce the most serious se-
curity threat to this nation since the 
Soviet Union collapsed.’’ 
Those wise voices are either gone or 
retired. Had we listened to their warn-
ings, today’s crisis might have been 
averted. But the State Department is 
now filled with officials who refuse to 
listen to adversaries or consider how 
our actions may make peace more dif-
ficult to obtain. 
Although I opposed the confirmation 
of Bridget Brink to be Ambassador to 
Ukraine, I wish her luck in rep-
resenting the United States and finding 
a path to a peaceful end to the conflict.

TRIBUTE TO CRAIG MCLEAN 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to acknowledge the public serv-
ice of Craig McLean who retired in 
April after a distinguished 40-year ca-
reer within the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. 
Within NOAA, Mr. McLean was as a 
dedicated 
leader, 
advocating 
for 
science to advance NOAA’s mission to 
understand and predict changes in cli-
mate, weather, ocean, and coasts. 
Mr. McLean has a deep dedication to 
our oceans and waterways, garnered 
from growing up along the Passaic 
River in Rutherford, NJ. As a child, he 
took a small boat out on the Passaic. 
As a teenager, he learned to dive and 
performed 
decompression 
diving 
in 
order 
to 
explore 
deep-ocean 
ship-
wrecks. These experiences helped in-
spire his career. 
Mr. McLean began his NOAA career 
in 1981 as a uniformed officer in the 
NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and 
served for nearly 25 years before retir-
ing at the rank of captain. During that 
time, he was instrumental to the 
founding of the NOAA Office of Ocean 
Exploration and Research, OER. Later, 
during his 16 years as a Federal execu-
tive, he provided continued leadership 
in driving forward mapping of U.S. 
waters to advance oceanographic sci-
entific knowledge and discover deep 
ocean secrets including new species, 
historical shipwrecks, and undersea 
mountains. His leadership underlies 
OER’s astounding accomplishments in-
cluding mapping 2 million square kilo-
meters and collecting ocean data in the 
waters of 16 countries and the high 
seas. This work contributed to key 
conservation decisions for vital marine 
habitats. 
Most recently, Mr. McLean served as 
Assistant Administrator for NOAA’s 
Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Re-
search—OAR—for more than 6 years,

leading an enterprise of 10 Federal lab-
oratories across the country and six 
major programs performing vital re-
search 
to 
understand 
and 
predict 
changes in climate, weather, ocean, 
and coasts for the benefit of the Na-
tion. Mr. McLean’s preeminent leader-
ship of OAR enabled vital advance-
ments, including improved forecasting 
of weather extremes such as hurri-
canes, winter storms, extreme precipi-
tation, and drought as well as a greatly 
increased understanding of the Earth’s 
climate system. His leadership has en-
abled NOAA to better prepare society 
in order to reduce the severe impacts of 
these events on life and property. 
On the international stage, as the 
U.S. Representative to the Intergov-
ernmental Oceanographic Commission 
of the United Nations Educational, Sci-
entific, and Cultural Organization— 
UNESCO—Mr. McLean’s skillful col-
laborative approach helped advance 
U.S. scientific goals and garnered sup-
port from our partners in ocean observ-
ing around the world. He helped broker 
consensus for global biogeochemical 
ocean sensors, known as Argo, which 
enabled a $53 million international 
commitment to expand deployments to 
improve ocean health and climate fore-
casting. Through this role, Mr. McLean 
served as a leader for the United Na-
tions Decade of Ocean Science for Sus-
tainable 
Development, 
championing 
this global undertaking to provide a 
common framework that ensures ocean 
science can support countries and 
achieve the United Nations’ 2030 Sus-
tainable Development Goals. 
Finally, I want to acknowledge Mr. 
McLean’s commitment to scientific in-
tegrity within NOAA. During the last 
administration, he boldly stepped for-
ward as a complainant when NOAA ex-
perienced political interference, put-
ting himself at risk to uphold scientific 
integrity and the Agency’s reputation. 
He also served as the Department of 
Commerce representative on the Na-
tional Science and Technology Council 
Fast-Track Action Committee on Sci-
entific Integrity where he cochaired a 
working group to provide responsive 
outcomes for the Presidential Memo-
randum on Restoring Trust in Govern-
ment Through Scientific Integrity and 
Evidence-Based Policymaking. NOAA’s 
science and the Agency’s integrity has 
been 
made 
stronger 
through 
Mr. 
McLean’s commitment and leadership 
on this issue. 
On behalf of my constituents in New 
Hampshire, I thank Craig McLean for 
his decades of excellent service to our 
Nation and wish him well in his retire-
ment. I hope he enjoys the chance to 
take his family out on the water more 
in retirement and enjoys the oceans he 
has championed throughout his career.

TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL 
ROBERT D. SHARP 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of myself, Vice Chair-
man RUBIO, Senator BLUNT, and all 
members of the Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence to recognize the 
service and accomplishments of VADM 
Robert D. Sharp and congratulate him 
on his upcoming retirement. His lead-
ership and vision drove the National 
Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency— 
NGA—to deliver support to a wide 
array of customers while simulta-
neously transforming its operating pro-
cedures and business practices. As Di-
rector of NGA, Vice Admiral Sharp en-
sured that timely, relevant, and accu-
rate geospatial intelligence was pro-
vided to policymakers, warfighters, 
first responders, the intelligence com-
munity, and the congressional intel-
ligence oversight committees. 
A veteran of the war in Afghanistan 
and the Gulf War, Vice Admiral Sharp 
served our country during a highly 
decorated 34-year career with the U.S. 
Navy, receiving two Bronze Stars, the 
Legion of Merit, two Defense Superior 
Service Medals, and the Navy Distin-
guished Service Medal. 
Vice Admiral Sharp’s service in-
cluded operational deployments with 
USS Ranger (CV61), Carrier Air Wing 2 
embarked on USS Constellation (CV 64), 
and Carrier Group 2 embarked on USS 
Harry S. Truman (CVN 75). Addition-
ally, in 2016, Vice Admiral Sharp was 
tasked with serving as commander, Of-
fice of Naval Intelligence, and director, 
National Maritime Intelligence-Inte-
gration Office. 
Vice Admiral Sharp culminated his 
distinguished career as the seventh di-
rector of the NGA. In this capacity he 
also served as the intelligence commu-
nity’s functional manager for GEOINT, 
head 
of 
the 
National 
System 
for 
Geospatial Intelligence, and chair of 
the Allied System for Geospatial Intel-
ligence. 
As NGA director, Vice Admiral Sharp 
led 14,500 military, civilian, and con-
tractor women and men with care, 
compassion, and resourcefulness during 
the challenges of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. As the government shifted to 
maximize telework, NGA found new 
and innovative ways to meet mission 
demands while ensuring the safety of 
the workforce and, simultaneously, sig-
nificantly improving the morale of the 
workforce. 
Vice Admiral Sharp managed the 
multibillion-dollar 
annual 
operating 
budget of the Agency, including the 
construction of a new, state-of-the-art 
$1.7 billion NGA-West campus in down-
town St. Louis, which includes the 
Senator Roy Blunt Geospatial Learn-
ing Center. This innovative facility 
will be a model for the IC in the future. 
Under Admiral Sharp’s leadership, the 
agency has maintained a constructive 
and productive relationship with the 
city, the local community, academia, 
and the private sector, marking St. 
Louis—now alongside Springfield, VA— 
as a leader in the GEOINT community. 
Vice Admiral Sharp also directed the 
use of new technology and commercial 
capabilities to meet steadily increasing 
demands of the customer base for 
trusted GEOINT with speed, accuracy, 
and precision—while working to keep 
ahead of the speed of change occurring 
in GEOINT inside and outside govern-
ment and around the globe. The impor-
tance to the Nation—and the world—of 
the ability to utilize new commercial 
GEOINT capabilities has recently been 
made clear during Russia’s unprovoked 
invasion of Ukraine. Vice Admiral 
Sharp also refocused investment in 
great power competition and empha-
sized the importance of assured posi-
tioning, navigation, timing, and tar-
geting. 
Throughout his tenure at NGA, Vice 
Admiral Sharp focused attention on a 
whole-of-enterprise approach by ex-
panding and deepening relations with 
partners across the enterprise. In par-
ticular, he has fostered increased en-
gagement with colleges and univer-
sities and promoted geographic lit-
eracy and STEM education in K–12 in-
stitutions. NGA has an active CRADA 
with the University of Virginia and 
open source intelligence partnerships 
with William and Mary University and 
Virginia Tech. NGA has also signed

tradecraft during an unprecedented 
time in the history of the nation. His 
leadership of NGA and his decades of 
service to our country displayed honor, 
courage, and commitment. We con-
gratulate Vice Admiral Sharp on his 
retirement and thank him for his serv-
ice to our country.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO EDWARD B. GARONE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to thank and pay tribute to the 
service of Derry Police Chief Edward 
Garone. 
For more than 50 years, Chief Garone 
has served with dedication and has 
worked to keep the people of Derry and 
people throughout the Granite State 
safe. 
Throughout it all, Chief Garone has 
worked tirelessly to ensure public safe-
ty—the most fundamental task of any 
government—creating 
the 
stability 
necessary for our people, families, and 
economy, to thrive. 
After bravely serving our country in 
the Marines, Chief Garone began his

career as a police officer in 1964 and 
eventually became captain. In 1972, he 
and his family moved to Derry, where 
he took on the role as police chief, a 
position that he has remained in for 
more than four decades, becoming one 
of the longest serving full-time police 
chiefs in the United States. 
Chief Garone quickly became a val-
ued member of the Derry community, 
even being named Derry’s Citizen of 
the Year in 1984. And in addition to his 
work in uniform, he worked to improve 
Derry in a variety of ways, including as 
Rotarian and by volunteering with the 
Boys and Girls Club of Greater Derry. 
Above all, the chief has said that he 
has appreciated his many years in 
Derry because he enjoys helping peo-
ple. And people across New Hampshire 
are indeed grateful for his commitment 
to service. 
Chief Garone represents the very best 
of New Hampshire’s law enforcement; 
he has lived his life in service to our 
country, and I have appreciated our 
work together. I join the people of 
Derry in thanking him, as well as his 
family, for all that they have done on 
behalf of the Granite State.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE MANNING 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Mike Manning of 
Penacook as May’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. After a chance stop-by at 
the Open Door Community Kitchen, 
Mike Manning stepped up to volunteer 
and now even comanages the kitchen, 
which provides free meals to help indi-
viduals in need in the community. 
When Mike saw a ‘‘Free Meals’’ sign 
outside the United Church of Penacook 
in 2015 and decided to venture in, he 
had no idea how much that decision 
would impact his life. Mike connected 
with the chair of Open Door Commu-
nity Kitchen and learned about their 
mission of serving meals to commu-
nities in and around Penacook. Later 
that year, Mike became the kitchen’s 
cochair, organizing volunteer shifts, 
food orders, and donations. 
In his first years as cochair, Mike 
made sure that Open Door Community 
Kitchen provided three free sit-down 
meals a week, with extra food for peo-
ple to bring home and last them the 
following days. Mealtimes provided a 
sense of camaraderie and togetherness 
among volunteers and attendees alike. 
Yet when the COVID–19 pandemic 
began, Open Door Community Kitchen 
was hard hit. Many of the volunteers 
were older and started to stay home at 
the onset of the pandemic because of 
the risk to their health. With limited 
capacity, the kitchen had to reduce its 
three free meals per week to two. In 
addition, the dining hall space had to 
close, and Open Door transitioned to 
making to-go meals. 
Nevertheless, Mike put every effort 
into making sure that Open Door Com-
munity Kitchen was able to keep run-
ning during the entire pandemic, never 
missing a week. Even with a skeleton 
staff and rising food prices, Mike has 
worked around the clock to continue 
serving meals. And now, he is working 
to restart Open Door’s in-person meals, 
which provide an important sense of 
community. 
Mike’s efforts to serve his neighbors 
during a time of need and under un-
precedented challenges are commend-
able. As Mike himself says, if everyone 
could just help each other, the world 
would be a much better place. His ac-
tions exemplify the best of the Granite 
State spirit of working together to sup-
port each other, no matter the obsta-
cles, and we are lucky to have him in 
our midst.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO GUS MACHADO 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I recog-
nize and honor the life of Gus Machado, 
a long-time businessman and entre-
preneur in Hialeah, FL, for his con-
tributions to the south Florida commu-
nity. 
Mr. Machado was born in Cuba and 
moved to the United States at the age 
of 15, where he founded a vehicle export 
business. When the U.S. and Cuba 
broke ties in 1960 as part of the Cold 
War, Mr. Machado remained in his new 
home of Miami and built three more 
businesses that sold General Motors ve-
hicles to inhabitants of Puerto Rico. 
During the 1980s, he began selling 
Buicks and Fords as well, and he even-
tually became the No. 1 Ford dealer in 
Miami-Dade County. 
Mr. Machado’s entrepreneurial leg-
acy continues to employ and support 
the people of south Florida to this day. 
Moreover, he will be remembered for 
his charitable contributions, especially 
to St. Thomas University in Miami— 
where College of Business students 
study 
in 
the 
proudly 
named 
Gus 
Machado 
Building—as 
well 
as 
the 
American Cancer Society. 
Mr. Machado’s story is an inspiring 
example of the American Dream and a 
testament to the contributions of 
Cuban immigrants to South Florida. I 
admire his hard work and his commit-
ment to his community and know that 
Mr. Machado’s efforts will bear fruit 
for years to come. I send my deepest 
sympathies and condolences to the en-
tire Machado family.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO EDWARD B. GARONE 
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to pay tribute to Ed-
ward B. Garone, a long-time law en-
forcement official in the Granite State. 
There are many reasons to salute Ed 
Garone, including an incredible 50 
years as police chief of the Derry, NH, 
police department and an extensive 
record of local involvement. I join 
Chief Garone’s colleagues and count-
less friends in thanking him for his 
tireless 
work 
and 
recognizing 
the 
qualities behind his many contribu-
tions and accomplishments: a humble 
desire to serve others and strengthen 
his community. 
After a 3-year tour of duty in the 
U.S. Marine Corps, Chief Garone began 
his law enforcement career as a police 
officer in the Lebanon, NH, police de-
partment. He would serve the city of 
Lebanon for 7-and-a-half years, rising 
to the rank of captain, before accepting 
an offer in 1972 to become the chief of 
police in Derry, NH. At 29 years old, he 
moved with his young family—wife 
Blanche and children Vicky and Mi-
chael—to southern New Hampshire and 
planted roots in a community he would 
serve for the next five decades. A local 
newspaper noted at the time that he 
was ‘‘an experienced officer with a lot 
of skill.’’ 
Chief Garone would tap into these 
skills to guide the town of Derry 
through a variety of law enforcement 
challenges. He also managed consider-
able growth within his department and 
witnessed significant development in 
the community it serves. Derry’s popu-
lation has nearly tripled since the 
1970s, and its police department ex-
panded from roughly 20 full-time offi-
cers in 1972 to over 70 full-time and 
part-time 
personnel 
today. 
Chief 
Garone is their strongest advocate, al-
ways making sure his officers have the 
most current and effective equipment, 
technology, and training. He is also 
their loudest champion, and he’s quick 
to deflect any compliment or praise to-
ward his officers who share his belief of 
‘service above self.’ 
Chief Garone is a well-respected fig-
ure and sought-after voice in New 
Hampshire’s law enforcement commu-
nity. He has been on the board of direc-
tors of the Regional Information Shar-
ing Systems—New England State Po-
lice Information Network for 17 years. 
He remains an active, 50-year member 
of the New Hampshire Association of 
Chiefs of Police and has served as its 
secretary for the past 32 years. So 
many of his fellow officers across the 
Granite State—from the longest serv-
ing chief to the newly-sworn-in patrol 
officer—look to Chief Garone for guid-
ance, for leadership, and for encourage-
ment as they work to keep our commu-
nities safe. 
Chief Garone’s service goes beyond 
all he has given and all he has accom-
plished at the Derry Police Depart-
ment. He is involved in a number of 
community and charitable organiza-
tions. Chief Garone is a 45-year mem-
ber of the Greater Derry Boys and Girls 
Club board of directors and a past 
president of the club. He is currently 
the longest serving member and former 
president of the Derry Rotary Club. He 
has led the Viviana Leon Memorial 
Foundation, a charitable foundation 
that provides funds each year to local 
groups. He is the current director of 
the Derry Veterans Assistance Fund, a 
nonprofit that seeks to improve the 
quality of life for local veterans. Chief 
Garone also serves on the board of di-
rectors for the Alexander Eastman 
Foundation and the Seacoast Child Ad-
vocacy Center. He even lends his time

and expertise to the public safety com-
mission of his hometown of Bradford, 
VT. 
Exhaustive research conducted by his 
colleagues 
concluded 
that 
Edward 
Garone is the longest serving full-time 
chief of police in the history of New 
Hampshire and quite possibly the en-
tire country. This distinction is a tes-
tament to Ed’s unwavering commit-
ment to bettering his community and 
helping others. The Granite State and 
the many communities he has served 
are grateful for Chief Garone’s many 
contributions and acts of selfless serv-
ice. In the coming month, friends and 
fellow officers will gather to salute Ed 
and thank him for all that he has given 
to the town of Derry and the State of 
New Hampshire. I am with them in 
spirit as they honor this good and gen-
erous man.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. MAR-
SHALL, Ms. HASSAN, and Mr. CAS-
SIDY): 
S. 4302. A bill to amend the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to re-
quire prompt reports of marketing sta-
tus by holders of approved applications 
for biological products, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the Food 
and Drug Administration’s ‘‘Purple 
Book’’ provides patients, providers, and 
public health experts with key infor-
mation about FDA-licensed biological 
products. Providers rely on accurate 
and up-to-date information from this 
searchable online database to make 
crucial decisions regarding the treat-
ment of their patients. The ‘‘Purple 
Book’’ provides transparency on the 
availability 
of 
biological 
products. 
This can help inform public health de-
cision-making and increase competi-
tion among manufacturers to lower 
prices. Improvements to the ‘‘Purple 
Book’’ clarifying when biological prod-
ucts leave the market would allow the 
FDA and the public to monitor the 
availability of these key medications. 
That is why I am proud to join my 
colleagues, Senators MARSHALL, HAS-
SAN, and CASSIDY, in introducing the 
Biologics Market Transparency Act, 
legislation that would extend to bio-
logical products certain reporting and 
transparency requirements that al-
ready exist for small molecule drugs. 
This is the Senate companion to legis-
lation introduced by Representatives 
KATHY MANNING and RICHARD HUDSON 
in the House. It would require manu-
facturers of biological products to con-
firm that their products listed in the 
‘‘Purple Book’’ are available for sale. 
This bill would also require manufac-
turers to report to the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services when their 
products are withdrawn from the mar-
ket. These updates to the ‘‘Purple 
Book’’ would provide patients and pro-
viders with real-time access to changes 
in drug availability, allowing physi-
cians 
to 
make 
informed 
decisions 
about the best treatment for their pa-
tients. These changes would also im-
prove the ability of the FDA to respond 
to and anticipate drug shortages. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass these commonsense 
reforms to strengthen public health 
and increase transparency for patients 
and providers. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 4303. A bill to provide for a period 
of exclusivity for first interchangeable 
biological products; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, biologics, 
or complex large molecule drugs typi-
cally derived from living organisms, 
play a critical role in our healthcare 
system, treating a range of conditions 
such as diabetes, arthritis, and cancer. 
Yet spending on these products ac-
counts for an alarming and significant 
portion of overall drug spending in the 
United States. In 2018, biologics ac-
counted for 40 percent of spending on 
all prescription drugs, with spending 
on biologics growing twice as quickly 
as overall drug spending since 2015. 
Biosimilars are drugs that are highly 
similar to existing biologics, and inter-
changeable biosimilars are biosimilars 
that can be substituted for a biologic 
product without the intervention of a 
healthcare provider. Biosimilars and 
interchangeable biosimilars can play a 
significant role in reducing drug spend-
ing. For example, Medicare Part D 
spending for both beneficiaries and the 
program is less than spending on ref-
erence biologic products even as the 
use of biosimilars increases with in-
creased availability. As of April 2022, 
there were 33 biosimilar products on 
the market including interchangeable

biosimilar products. Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, FDA, approval of addi-
tional 
interchangeable 
biosimilars 
could provide patients with more treat-
ment options, increase competition, 
and lower costs. We must take steps to 
provide clarity around the FDA’s re-
view 
process 
for 
interchangeable 
biosimilars to facilitate development 
of these products, bringing them to 
market faster. 
That is why I am proud to join my 
colleague, Senator COLLINS, in intro-
ducing the Interchangeable Biologics 
Clarity Act, legislation that would 
make key improvements in the FDA’s 
review 
process 
for 
interchangeable 
biosimilars. 
Specifically, 
this 
bill 
would clarify the FDA’s authority to 
tentatively approve a second or third 
interchangeable before the end of the 
first interchangeable’s exclusivity pe-
riod, allowing additional products to 
enter the market more efficiently 
when that exclusivity period ends. This 
legislation would also specify that two 
interchangeable biologics approved on 
the same day could share an exclu-
sivity period. These provisions would 
allow the FDA to issue additional guid-
ance around the review of interchange-
able biologic products and ensure in-
creased transparency about the exclu-
sivity periods for interchangeable prod-
ucts. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to pass these important im-
provements to the FDA’s biosimilar re-
view process that will increase pa-
tients’ treatment options and help fos-
ter competition.

(3) the President, in consultation with Con-
gress, should work to conclude negotiations 
for such comprehensive trade agreements 
contingent upon an agreement between the 
European Union and the United Kingdom 
that fully protects and preserves the Good 
Friday Agreement consistent with the senti-
ments expressed by the Senate in S. Res.117 
(117th Congress); and 
(4) the President, in consultation with Con-
gress, should strive to reach mutually advan-
tageous resolutions of commercial disagree-
ments between the United States and the 
United Kingdom, including ending the Dig-
ital Services Tax on United States busi-
nesses and ensuring a satisfactory final reso-
lution to the World Trade Organization large 
civil aircraft dispute. 
SA 5046. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. LEE) 
proposed an amendment to the resolu-
tion S. Res. 134, expressing the sense of 
the Senate that the President should 
work with the Government of the 
United Kingdom to conclude negotia-
tions for a comprehensive trade agree-
ment between the United States and 
the United Kingdom that the President 
should work with the President of the 
European Commission to conclude ne-
gotiations for a comprehensive trade 
agreement between the United States 
and the European Union; as follows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, on March 5, 1946, Sir Winston 
Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech 
in Fulton, Missouri, solidifying the ‘‘Special 
Relationship’’ between the United States and 
the United Kingdom; 
Whereas, since the end of World War II, the 
United States and the United Kingdom have 
been beacons of freedom to the world, stand-
ing together in the fight against tyranny; 
Whereas the Special Relationship between 
the United States and the United Kingdom 
has driven economic prosperity and security 
cooperation in both nations for more than 70 
years; 
Whereas, according to ‘‘Sterling Assets,’’ a 
report from the Confederation of British In-
dustry, the United States and the United 
Kingdom share the world’s largest bilateral 
trade and investment relationship; 
Whereas, while the United States and the 
United Kingdom already share a robust eco-
nomic partnership and strong labor ties, 
there remain clear opportunities for both 
countries to further strengthen those ties; 
Whereas the United States Trade Rep-
resentative and United Kingdom Department 
for International Trade have engaged in sub-
stantive negotiations towards the conclusion 
of a comprehensive trade agreement since 
May 2020; 
Whereas the United States seeks to sup-
port higher-paying jobs in the United States 
and to grow the United States economy by 
improving United States opportunities for 
trade and investment with the European 
Union; 
Whereas the economic relationship of the 
United States and the European Union is the 
largest and most complex in the world, with 
over $1,100,000,000,000 in annual two-way 
trade; 
Whereas the United States Trade Rep-
resentative and the European Union have en-
gaged in substantive negotiations toward the 
conclusion of a trade agreement; 
Whereas the United States has historically 
acted as a guarantor of the 1998 Good Friday 
Agreement, an agreement between the Brit-
ish and Irish governments, designed to pro-
tect peace in Northern Ireland by avoiding a 
hard border on the island of Ireland; 
Whereas Prime Minister Boris Johnson of 
the United Kingdom, President of the Euro-
pean Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and 
President of the European Council Charles 
Michel signed the Brexit Withdrawal Agree-
ment on January 24, 2020; 
Whereas as part of the Brexit Withdrawal 
Agreement, in order to protect the Good Fri-
day Agreement in the aftermath of the 
United Kingdom’s departure from the Euro-
pean Union, the two parties agreed to the 
Northern Ireland Protocol; and 
Whereas the constitutional power of mak-
ing trade agreements with foreign nations 
rests with Congress: Now, therefore, be it 
SA 5047. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. LEE) 
proposed an amendment to the resolu-
tion S. Res. 134, expressing the sense of 
the Senate that the President should 
work with the Government of the 
United Kingdom to conclude negotia-
tions for a comprehensive trade agree-
ment between the United States and 
the United Kingdom that the President 
should work with the President of the 
European Commission to conclude ne-
gotiations for a comprehensive trade 
agreement between the United States 
and the European Union; as follows: 
Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘A resolu-
tion expressing the sense of the Senate that 
the President should work with the Govern-
ment of the United Kingdom to conclude ne-
gotiations for a comprehensive trade agree-
ment between the United States and the 
United Kingdom that the President should 
work with the President of the European 
Commission to conclude negotiations for a 
comprehensive trade agreement between the 
United States and the European Union.’’.
