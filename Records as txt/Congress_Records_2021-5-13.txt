WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2021 
No. 83 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, our refuge and our protec-
tion, our shield and defense, into Your 
hands we commend our Nation’s police 
force. 
Even as these men and women, our 
compatriots, place their lives on the 
line in service to their hometowns, 
their communities, their country, and 
this Capitol, we pray Your spirit be 
upon them. 
For their countless acts of dedica-
tion, selfless service, and heroism, and 
for the 394 men and women whose 
names were added to the National Law 
Enforcement Memorial this year, and 
for all who have gone above and be-
yond, paying the ultimate price so that 
we would enjoy security on our streets 
and in our cities, we are deeply in-
debted. 
We pray that You keep them safe as 
they step into the fray each day. We 
also ask that You enable them, when 
they find themselves in volatile and 
complex environments that we can’t 
even begin to fathom, to discern the 
precarious lines they walk between 
public protection and self-preservation 
and between skilled insight and rash 
judgment. 
Remind us, O God, whether in uni-
form or as common citizens, that You 
have given each of us full armor to 
guard us from the hazards of each day. 
May we be willing to put on the belt of 
truth and the breastplate of righteous-
ness. May our feet and our whole selves 
be equipped with a readiness that has 
prepared us to walk always the path of 
peace. 
It is in the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. HILL led the Pledge of Allegiance 
as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
ROSEMARY LAWLEY 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to mark the sad 
occasion of the passing of Rosemary 
Lawley of Williamsville, New York. 
Entering into her eternal rest a few 
short months ago, Mrs. Lawley was the 
matriarch of the Lawley family of Buf-
falo and western New York and was 
loved by all those who came into her 
life. She was a champion for those who 
had none. 
Born Rosemary O’Connor in south 
Buffalo, she was a graduate of Mount 
Mercy Academy and nursing school at 
D’Youville College. Rosemary met the 
love of her life, Bill, and together, they 
raised six children who each continue 
in the footsteps of their parents, giving 
back generously to the western New 
York community. 
Rosemary Lawley was one of a kind— 
a 
graceful 
and 
thoughtful 
woman 
whose commitment to faith, family, 
and community set examples for so 
many to follow, and, most particularly, 
her grandchildren and her great-grand-
children. 
While her loss leaves an irreplaceable 
void at the top of the Lawley family, 
her legacy shines on through her fam-
ily and through her many charitable 
works for which she is best known. I 
am honored to remember her on this 
beautiful day on the floor of the United 
States House of Representatives in this 
good and generous Nation and the Cap-
itol of the United States of America. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF JOHN McAULIFFE 
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the retirement of 
John McAuliffe, a central New York 
native, visionary, and driving force be-
hind the Onondaga Lake cleanup effort. 
In 2002, John McAuliffe was named 
program director for the Honeywell 
Company’s $450 million cleanup of On-
ondaga Lake, one of the most polluted 
sites in America caused by Honeywell’s 
predecessor. 
McAuliffe 
tirelessly 
worked 
with 
Federal and State environmental regu-
lators and oversaw teams of engineers 
and technicians to clean up a lake 
laden with more than 165,000 pound of 
mercury and other toxic substances. 
Today, Onondaga Lake is the site of 
the Loop-the-Lake Trail, as well as the 
Lakeview 
Amphitheater, 
a 
popular 
music venue, and hosts thousands of 
boaters, fishers, and nature enthusiasts 
each year. It has also become a favorite 
place for bald eagles, especially in the 
winter months. The lake has experi-
enced an extraordinary revival due to 
John McAuliffe’s remarkable vision 
and unwavering commitment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2274 
May 13, 2021 
Central New York owes John a debt 
of gratitude for an enduring legacy of 
doing something that many thought 
was impossible. I wish John a happy re-
tirement. 
f 
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize Military Appreciation 
Month. 
Serving in America’s Armed Forces 
is one of the most courageous and self-
less decisions citizens of this country 
can make. It is a decision we should 
never cease to honor and celebrate. Too 
frequently, however, our Active Duty 
servicemembers and their families do 
not receive the essential care and sup-
port they need and deserve. 
Force readiness is contingent on a 
servicemember’s ability to be confident 
that their family is kept safe when 
they are called to serve. Too often we 
find that these families aren’t safe. 
They are living in homes with toxic 
mold and no recourse. Their drinking 
water has been poisoned by years of 
chemical dumps with no recourse. 
It is simply unacceptable. As a new 
member of the House Armed Services 
Committee, I will always stand up to 
ensure that those who have so bravely 
defended our freedoms have access to 
the essential resources and support 
they need to thrive. 
Military families serve too, and it is 
time we recognize this and act to show 
them the appreciation they deserve.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF IRMA H. ROBERTS 
(Mr. KUSTOFF asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the upcoming 100th 
birthday of Irma Roberts, probably the 
most famous high school librarian in 
the history of Memphis City Schools. 
Irma Roberts was the librarian at 
White Station High School from 1963 to 
1986. Aside from being the librarian, 
she was the school’s student council 
sponsor. She planned the homecoming 
and directed the annual Queen of 
Clubs. 
Without a doubt, Irma Roberts had a 
great influence on my life and on so 
many other students at White Station 
High School. She is truly an inspira-
tion to a couple of generations of stu-
dents at White Station High School. 
She was a tremendous educator. 
Dodson, DeAnn, Dabney, Bob, Bill, 
and Ryan know how terrific their 
mother and grandmother is as a per-
son. Now, so does everyone else. 
Irma Roberts, congratulations on 
your 100th birthday. 
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in the be-
ginning of this week because of the 
routine inspection by the Department 
of Transportation in Arkansas, it was 
discovered that the Hernando De Soto 
Bridge that crosses the Mississippi 
River between Memphis and Arkansas 
had a major crack in a structural 
beam. As a result, that bridge which 
carries 50,000 cars across it and much of 
America’s 
commerce 
along 
I–40 
is 
closed, and it may be closed for as 
much as months—not days or weeks, 
but months. 
Traffic is diverted to a 1949 bridge, 
the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, which is 
currently serving the need, but it is 
difficult, and it is causing traffic prob-
lems in Memphis. 
Mr. Speaker, 700 barges are stopped 
on the Mississippi River—370 going 
south and 330 going north—which can-
not go under the bridge for fear that 
the bridge could fall and not support 
its own weight and damage the barges. 
I am calling on the Department of 
Transportation to get involved, to lend 
its expertise, and to lend money and fi-
nances to get this bridge open. This is 
a national tragedy, and it shows why 
we need an infrastructure bill imme-
diately. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in celebration of National Police Week 
and to honor the brave men and women 
in blue who selflessly serve in law en-
forcement across our Nation. 
I want to extend my sincere grati-
tude to the officers back in central Ar-
kansas, throughout the country, and 
right here in the U.S. Capitol who fear-
lessly defend our families and commu-
nities. Our communities could not run 
smoothly without the service and sac-
rifice that law enforcement officers 
make for us on a daily basis. 
The best way to ensure better com-
munity-based policing is to support our 
law enforcement agencies with the 
proper training and the proper funding 
that they need. I will always support 
our law enforcement here in Wash-
ington, and I hope that our country can 
bond where all our communities are 
proud like I am to back the blue. 
Once again, I thank all of our dedi-
cated officers in this important week 
for their sacrifices and, importantly, 
their families’ sacrifice as they serve 
all of our families on a daily basis. 
f 
RELIEF PACKAGE 
(Ms. DELBENE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight a historic piece of 
the American Rescue Plan: the ex-
panded child tax credit. Prior to this 
relief package, the child tax credit left 
behind one-third of all children because 
their parents earned too little to access 
the full benefit. 
The American Rescue Plan changed 
that by making the credit fully refund-
able, increasing the credit to $3,000 per 
child per year, $3,600 for kids under the 
age of 6, and providing the credit in 
monthly payments starting this July. 
This 1-year expansion was a critical 
first step, but we must go further to re-
build our middle class. Children don’t 
grow up in just 1 year or 5 years. We 
must make this expansion permanent. 
In Washington State, this is esti-
mated to benefit 1.4 million children 
and reduce childhood poverty by 40 per-
cent. I will continue fighting to make 
this expansion permanent and provide 
all kids with a fair opportunity to suc-
ceed. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S INFLATION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, Tuesday was a media alarm. 
The biased Washington Post reported 
accidentally in The State newspaper 
that ‘‘Joe Biden’s free spending could 
ignite inflation that would outstrip 
wage gains.’’ The President’s $6 trillion 
spending spree of borrowing and taxing 
will burden the youth of America with 
debt and threaten the savings of older 
Americans with a worthless dollar. 
Already, The Post and Courier of 
Charleston reprinted how lumber costs 
in the average house have skyrocketed 
$36,000 this year, undermining home-
ownership. The Wall Street Journal re-
vealed used cars have hit a record of 
over $25,000 which denies many the 
ability to purchase a car. 
The New York Stock Exchange suf-
fered a staggering loss of nearly 500 
points as inflation was clearly being 
pushed by the outrageous spending 
schemes of President Biden destroying 
jobs. 
I appreciate the courageous leaders, 
like Ambassador Nikki Haley, who are 
standing up for America. She has sent 
me a symbol of the consequence of bor-
rowing and taxing which we see in Ven-
ezuela: the 100 Bolivar note which is 
now worth less than a dime. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

IMPROVING LIVES OF WORKING

Plan is on its way to my district to 
keep frontline public workers on the 
payroll; that $50 million is coming to 
my district to help our colleges, uni-
versities, and their students recover 
from this horrible pandemic; and that 
advance monthly child tax credit pay-
ments—a tax cut for working families 
with children—stand to benefit 126,000 
children in my district alone. 
These are more than just numbers on 
a page. They represent the promise of 
life returning to this country as part of 
the American Rescue Plan which has 
put checks back in pockets, put people 
back in jobs, put the shots in the arms, 
and put our kids back in the schools. 
This is the American Rescue Plan, 
and it is working.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF JEFF 
HENDRED 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a man from 
Iowa’s Second Congressional District 
for his countless hours of service to our 
community. 
Recently, Wilson Elementary School 
principal and Polar Xpress frozen yo-
gurt shopowner Jeff Hendred, from my 
hometown of Ottumwa, was awarded 
the 
President’s 
Volunteer 
Service 
Award by the United Way of Wapello 
County. 
The volunteer service award is given 
to honor individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to leave a positive 
impact in their community and for in-
spiring 
others 
to 
pay 
it 
forward 
through community service of their 
own. 
Jeff was instrumental in coordi-
nating the annual celebration of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., and has dedi-
cated countless hours to the Emer-
gency Youth Food Program. 
It is truly inspiring, and I am incred-
ibly thankful to have Jeff in Ottumwa. 
With over 20 years of service in 
Ottumwa’s schools, Jeff has the impor-
tant job of being a role model and 
teacher to hundreds of students, and 
his service to the Ottumwa community 
sets a great example for our next gen-
eration of community leaders. 
I could not be prouder to represent 
Jeff in Congress, his first Congress-
woman from Ottumwa, and to call him 
and his wife, Sandra, a friend. 
f 
CONNECTING 
PEOPLE 
TO 
JOBS 
THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE IN-
VESTMENTS 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of investing in 
our infrastructure with bold strokes 
and smart policy. We have a once-in-a- 
generation opportunity to provide mo-
bility for all Americans. We must har-
ness it. 
Making our economy more sustain-
able, productive, and fair means up-
grading the way people from all back-
grounds and ZIP Codes access jobs, 
goods, and services. 
As a member of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee, I am 
working with my colleagues to expand 
access to reliable and convenient buses, 
provide grants for on-demand transit 
to fill transit deserts, and build com-
plete streets that ensure pedestrian 
safety, encourage the use of bicycles 
and other micromobility with pro-
tected lanes, and improve the handling 
of stormwater. Transportation is about 
bridges, ports, and roads, yes, but it 
must foundationally be about con-
necting people to jobs and services 
across all modalities. I look forward to 
advancing these priorities in forth-
coming legislation. 
f 
STANDING WITH ISRAEL 
(Mr. JORDAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the con-
tinuing attacks on Israeli civilians by 
Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip are 
a shocking reminder that Israel’s very 
existence has been threatened through-
out its seven decades as a nation. We 
strongly condemn these attacks and 
the 
terror 
campaign 
being 
waged 
against our Israeli allies. 
As a sovereign country, Israel not 
only has the right but the responsi-
bility to protect its own citizens. No 
nation could be expected to withstand 
these assaults without acting in its 
own defense. 
Even in its military response, under 
constant threat of further attacks, 
with air raid sirens driving hundreds of 
thousands of Israelis to bomb shelters, 
Israel has shown remarkable restraint. 
Hamas has certainly not. 
Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu’s government should have 
the full support of this Congress and 
this President as it works to end the 
waves of terror coming out of Gaza. As 
the Prime Minister said in this Cham-
ber 10 years ago, ‘‘Israel is the one an-
chor of stability’’ in the Middle East. 
Mr. Speaker, we must continue to 
stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel, 
united against all threats to its peace, 
stability, and its very existence. 
f 
HONORING FALLEN OFFICERS 
FROM PUERTO RICO 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I stand with Israel. 
Today, in National Police Week, I 
rise to recognize our municipal, State, 
and Federal law enforcement officers 
in Puerto Rico and their commitment 
to public safety. 
I also rise to honor those brave offi-
cers from the island who lost their 
lives in the line of duty during the past 
year. 
From the Puerto Rico Police Bureau: 
Captain Roberto Rodriguez-Hernandez, 
Lieutenants Jose Garcia-Vazquez and 
Juan Rivera-Padua, Sergeants Miguel 
Martinez-Ortiz, 
Ricardo 
Perez-Ortiz, 
Mayra Rodriguez-Burgado, Juan Rami-
rez-Padilla, Luis Marrero-Diaz, and 
Juan Rosado-Lopez. 
From the Carolina Municipal Police 
Department: Sergeants Eliezer Her-
nandez-Cartagena and Luis Salaman- 
Conde. 
We are eternally grateful to those of-
ficers who made the ultimate sacrifice 
while protecting their communities. 
Let’s back the blue. 
f 
MARKING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, it is Na-
tional Police Week. After serving in 
law enforcement for over 30 years, I 
can think of no better story to share 
today than the story of my family’s 
more than 110 years of law enforcement 
service. 
It all started with my father, Edwin 
Nehls, who, after returning home from 
Korea as the recipient of the Distin-
guished Service Cross, began serving 
with the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office 
in the State of Wisconsin. He served for 
over two decades, starting as a traffic 
deputy and eventually working his way 
to serving as the elected sheriff, a posi-
tion he held for 8 years. 
My older brother Todd Nehls served 
in the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office for 
34 years, serving more than 10 of those 
years as the elected sheriff. 
And 
my 
identical 
twin 
brother, 
Trever Nehls, served in law enforce-
ment for over 30 years in Fort Bend 
County, Texas, starting in the early 
1990s. He just retired in March of this 
year after a successful career. 
I could not be more proud of my fa-
ther and brothers’ service.

BIDEN ECONOMIC POLICIES 
JEOPARDIZE LIVELIHOODS 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because busi-
nesses are getting hammered by the de-
structive economic policies of the 
Biden administration. 
I just returned from my district in 
Florida, 
where, 
despite 
an 
overall 
strong economy, local business owners 
are 
struggling 
to 
find 
employees. 
Whether it is our local builders’ asso-
ciation, manufacturers like Tampa Ar-
mature 
Works, 
food 
producers 
at 
RollinGreens, hospitals, or my favorite 
restaurants, this problem exists across 
every business sector.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2276 
May 13, 2021 
It defies all principles of free-market 
economics that we see ‘‘help wanted’’ 
signs in shop windows across America 
the same day the Biden administration 
posted one of the worst jobs reports in 
recent memory. 
Why is that? At a time when over 150 
million Americans have received vac-
cinations, and we are finally emerging 
from the pandemic, why is the econ-
omy going in the wrong direction at an 
accelerating rate? 
It is simple. Biden administration 
policies are incentivizing people to re-
main out of the workforce. Our govern-
ment should be encouraging people to 
work, not implementing policies that 
jeopardize the livelihoods of Ameri-
cans. 
f 
SAYING YES TO MOVING 
FORWARD TOGETHER 
(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, we are at a 
crossroads coming out of this pan-
demic. We are either going to decide, 
as a country, whether we are going to 
move forward together, or we are going 
to double down on the past and the bad 
economy. 
In the rescue package, 2.3 million 
Ohioan children will get $3,000 or $3,600 
to stabilize themselves, to pull them 
out of poverty. And the Republicans 
said no. 
We had pension reform in that. 
Forty-thousand Ohioans will now be 
made whole instead of losing half their 
pension. Republicans said no. 
We want to do infrastructure. Repub-
licans said no. 
We want money for State and local 
governments for hazard pay. Repub-
licans say no. 
Mr. Speaker, if we removed the word 
‘‘no’’ from the vocabulary of the people 
of the United States, the Republicans 
would be speechless. 
f 
RESPECTING SERVICE OF FIRST 
RESPONDERS 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge National Police 
Week. 
There have been 124 police officers 
killed in the line of duty this year, un-
fortunately, including two of my con-
stituents, Deputy Michael Magli and 
Master Patrol Officer Jesse Madsen. 
I went to the funeral services of our 
heroes, Mr. Speaker, and shared the an-
guish of their loved ones. They leave 
behind a distinguished legacy of serv-
ice and sacrifice that deserves to be 
honored. 
This week, I was proud to cosponsor 
legislation that would increase pen-
alties for crimes targeting law enforce-
ment and strengthen funding for law 
enforcement programs. 
Law enforcement has faced unrelent-
ing political attacks as part of the 
defund the police movement. This is a 
dangerous proposition that has already 
proven to leave communities less safe. 
I respect, of course, the service and 
sacrifices of our first responders, and I 
will continue to support them. 
f 
HONORING ALL MEN AND WOMEN 
IN BLUE 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, during this National Police 
Week, to honor and thank all men and 
women in blue who dutifully protect 
and serve our communities. 
Public safety is the most important 
factor in quality of life. In recent 
years, antipolice rhetoric and violence 
have increased dramatically. In 2020 
alone, 128 police officers were fallen 
and died in the line of duty, one of the 
deadliest in history for law enforce-
ment. 
Fully aware of these dangers, more 
than 800,000 brave police officers across 
America still faithfully put their lives 
on the line to protect each of us every 
day. That is 0.25 percent who protects 
all the rest. 
On Tuesday, I was honored to join po-
lice officers from Lebanon County, in 
my district, at a ceremony honoring of-
ficers who made the ultimate sacrifice. 
I thank Pier Hess Graf, the Lebanon 
County district attorney, for handling, 
running, and emceeing the event. 
I joined many Republican colleagues 
this morning on a bike rally led by 
Leader MCCARTHY to the National Law 
Enforcement Officers Memorial, where 
we honored our Nation’s fallen police 
officers. 
As the son of a police officer, Detec-
tive Stanley Meuser, I know well the 
tremendous sacrifices our police offi-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that a1l Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.R. 2547 and to include ex-
traneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of my legislation, H.R. 2547, the Com-
prehensive Debt Collection Improve-
ment Act. 
H.R. 2547 is a package of bills de-
signed to bring new protections, fair-
ness, accuracy, and transparency to 
the debt collection industry. 
Individuals and families across this 
country have long struggled with debt, 
including medical debt, student loan 
debt, and other debts. They often face 
difficult decisions regarding how to pay 
off their debts. 
During the pandemic crisis, which 
has harmed all of our communities, 
debt collectors have earned record 
profits. Their tactics are often divisive 
and predatory. Many debt collectors 
harass consumers with frequent phone 
calls, make threats, and provide mis-
leading information to consumers. The 
debt collection industry is also plagued

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

by poor recordkeeping, resulting in 
many consumers being harassed for 
debts they do not owe. 
Debt collection is among the top 
issues that the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau receives the most 
complaints about from consumers, and 
those complaints have risen since 2019. 
This bill, H.R. 2547, brings new ac-
countability to the debt collection in-
dustry and stronger protections for 
consumers from harassment and abuse, 
including by banning abusive confes-
sions of judgment that have hurt small 
businesses, prohibiting debt collectors 
from harassing and threatening serv-
icemembers, barring collection of med-
ical debts from 2 years after the debt is 
incurred, prohibiting debt collectors 
from contacting consumers by email or 
text message without a consumer’s af-
firmative consent, limiting egregious 
debt collection fees that have dis-
proportionately hurt low-income and 
minority borrowers, and protecting 
consumers during a nonjudicial fore-
closure proceeding. 
Taken together, these protections 
will help the most vulnerable con-
sumers, including servicemembers, stu-
dent borrowers, people of color, and 
those struggling under the weight of 
medical debt during this unprecedented 
pandemic. 
None of this is to say that people who 
owe lawful debts shouldn’t pay them, 
but all Americans deserve to be free 
from harassment, undue pressure tac-
tics, 
bullying, 
false 
information, 
threats, coercion, and other bad prac-
tices that debt collectors have used 
with relative impunity. 
The last time Congress made major 
updates to Federal laws on debt collec-
tion was 1978, over 40 years ago. It is 
long overdue for Congress to act to pro-
vide stronger protections from abusive 
debt collection for consumers. 
This comprehensive package includes 
a number of bills authored by several 
hardworking members of the Financial 
Services Committee, specifically bills 
sponsored 
by 
Representative 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, Representative DEAN, Rep-
resentative 
TLAIB, 
Representative 
PRESSLEY, 
Representative 
CLEAVER, 
Representative MEEKS, and Represent-
ative AUCHINCLOSS. 
I would like to thank all of them for 
their work on these bills, their con-
tributions to this legislative package, 
and their leadership on these impor-
tant reforms that will provide des-
perately needed relief and protection 
to consumers. 
I would urge all of my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 2547. 
Let’s just start off and call the bill 
what it is. It is another attempt by 
Democrats to socialize our financial 
system. 
Once again, under the guise of con-
sumer support, Democrats are trying 
to implement their long-held partisan 
priorities. That is what we have seen a 
lot of in this Congress. 
Democrats are trying to sell H.R. 2547 
to the American people as a necessary 
action to help families and small busi-
nesses hardest hit by the economic im-
pacts of COVID–19. It is not. 
The truth is, this bill is just a redo of 
several partisan bills that we had from 
last Congress, pre-COVID. If there was 
any question as to whether or not 
Democrats viewed the pandemic as a 
‘‘tremendous opportunity to restruc-
ture things to fit their vision,’’ this bill 
proves it. 
This bill is more about catering to 
progressive lobbyists and stakeholders 
who have long sought to tear down the 
pillars of our credit markets and finan-
cial system. 
First, it is clear that progressives 
want to eliminate a fundamental part 
of our free market system, the belief 
that you should be paid for services 
provided in a timely manner. The fact 
is, limiting the ability of businesses 
and individuals to be repaid for their 
services already provided will not ben-
efit anyone. This is especially true for 
small businesses that have been hard-
est hit, frankly, from the pandemic 
shutdowns. 
If enacted, this bill will also drive up 
the cost of credit for all borrowers, es-
pecially low-income borrowers, as well 
as limit their credit options. 
There are commonsense ways to up-
date and improve the process for col-
lecting payments and to modernize the 
credit reporting regimes. This includes 
identifying ways to protect consumers 
and encourage them and their service 
providers or lenders to work out repay-
ment plans. 
In fact, just last month, the entire 
House voted to support the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania, Represent-
ative DEAN’s bill to ensure that mem-
bers of our military are not threatened 
with service-related consequences as 
they work to repay debts owed. That 
makes sense. It was a bipartisan bill 
with a great result. 
But the further you dig into this bill, 
the more problematic it gets. For ex-
ample, this bill will actually make 
healthcare in this country more expen-
sive and will limit the medical services 
provided to those who need it most. I 
don’t think that is the intention, but 
that is, in fact, the impact. 
Making it more difficult for medical 
providers to seek payment for their 
services does not make them free, does 
not make the system less expensive. 
And excluding medical debt from an in-
dividual’s credit report is not a way to 
support consumers or our healthcare 
providers, who have been, frankly, on 
the front lines of the COVID pandemic. 
I have a bill that allows medical debt 
that results from nonelective services 
to be protected, and ensures that if it 
is repaid, it is eliminated from a con-
sumer credit report’s adverse actions. 
I think that bill makes sense, right? 
If people repay their medical debt, I 
think we should acknowledge that on 
credit reports. 
But if it’s elective surgery or if it is 
perhaps something medically of their 
own choosing, I think they should have 
to pay for that. And if they don’t pay 
for those services, it should be on their 
credit report. I think these things 
make sense. I think there are ways we 
can ensure we have accurate reporting. 
Accurate reporting and full repay-
ment allows the credit markets to 
work smoothly and to accurately ac-
count for risk. This, in turn, allows the 
financial system to continue to provide 
low-cost credit to those who need it 
most. 
Democrats also want to undermine 
the CFPB’s work to finalize its debt 
collection rule last fall. This rule was 
the result of more than 7 years of re-
search, analysis, data collection; and it 
clarifies the allowable uses of modern 
communication technology. I think it 
is a proper update to these long-held 
consumer protection laws that we have 
on the books. 
This bill eliminates this positive step 
forward. This bill prohibits debt collec-
tors from using 21st century methods 
of communication to reach consumers. 
That is insane. That is bad. That goes 
all against the whole movement post- 
COVID or in the midst of COVID, that 
we digitize our communication tools 
and enable people to do things more 
cheaply via technology. 
This bill includes stopping consumers 
from being contacted via email or text 
message without explicit prior consent. 
Consumers should be able to commu-
nicate about their payment options 
privately in the way they prefer. This 
bill eliminates that choice. Restricting 
options like that makes it more dif-
ficult to contact consumers. It doesn’t 
help anyone. 
Perhaps the consumer doesn’t know 
that they missed the payment, and this 
bill would say you can’t text them to 
let them know they missed their pay-
ment. That is absurd. I don’t think 
that is the bill author’s intent, but 
that is the impact in the real market. 
Just to reiterate, limiting the ability 
of individuals and businesses to seek 
repayment for services provided will 
undermine the ability to underwrite 
and thereby increase the risk to the fi-
nancial system. 
If you can’t price for risk, you are 
going to have more risk. If we have 
more risk that is not appropriately 
priced, we will get bad outcomes in the 
financial 
system. 
This 
ultimately 
makes extending credit more expensive 
for all borrowers and may push the 
lowest income borrowers out of the 
system entirely. 
That is a bad result. That is not what 
we want. Either side of the aisle, we 
don’t want that. This bill has that 
harmful impact. 
We all agree that consumers who owe 
a debt should be treated with respect 
and dignity and not be subject to abu-
sive or harassing behavior. The law al-
ready upholds this. This bill is a Big

Government, 
anti-consumer, 
anti- 
small business solution in search of a 
problem. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
bill and the harmful impacts herein. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER). 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, let 
me, first of all, thank Chairwoman 
WATERS for including my legislation, 
my Debt Collection Improvement Act, 
into the Stop Debt Collection Abuse 
Act, which would, among other things, 
extend the protections in the Fair Debt 
Collection Practices Act to debt owed 
to a Federal, State, territory, District 
of Columbia, and local government 
agency, and limit the excessive fees 
that debt collectors may charge. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices 
Act was enacted in 1978 to eliminate 
abusive debt collection practices by 
debt collectors and to ensure that 
those debt collectors who refrain from 
using abusive debt collection practices 
were not competitively disadvantaged. 
Congress has found abundant evi-
dence of the use of abusive, deceptive, 
and unfair debt collection practices by 
many debt collectors, and Congress ex-
pressly found that abusive debt collec-
tion practices contribute to social ills. 
Those findings are still true today. 
Unfortunately, when Congress en-
acted the Fair Debt Collection Prac-
tices Act in 1978, it did not apply the 
law to debt collectors hired by Federal 
Government entities. As one witness 
before the Financial Services Com-
mittee pointed out, extending the Fair 
Debt Collection Practices Act to debt 
collectors hired by government entities 
is important because collection by or 
on behalf of the government is already 
unusually coercive as a result of the 
government’s immense and unrivaled 
police power and other means of seizing 
citizens’ assets. 
This title within the bill also ensures 
that fees from debt collectors working 
on behalf of the Federal Government 
cannot be unreasonable, and requires 
the GAO to conduct a study into the 
use of third-party debt collectors by 
State and local governments. This title 
within the bill is supported by more 
than 20 civil rights organizations and 
consumer rights groups across the Na-
tion. 
The Comprehensive Debt Collection 
Improvement Act before us is a timely 
piece of legislation. America’s hard-
working families, small businesses, and 
students deserve to be treated with re-
spect, integrity, and fairness, including 
those who owe debt to the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Americans currently find themselves 
in greater debt than at any other time 
in history, including prior to the great 
financial crisis of 2008. The debt burden 
stands at approximately $14.56 trillion 
and includes all types of consumer se-
cured and unsecured loans. 
No American should have to deal 
with abusive, predatory practices from 
debt collectors, especially when those 
debt collectors have been hired by the 
United States Federal Government. 
This bill strengthens consumer pro-
tections by rectifying loopholes in ex-
isting Federal law that enables private 
companies hired by the Federal Gov-
ernment to unnecessarily harass indi-
viduals. 
If Congress is going to set up fair 
debt collection practices to hold the 
private sector accountable, the Federal 
agency collecting a debt from con-
sumers should be held to the same 
standard. 
b 1245 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON), my friend and 
colleague. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the surface-level intentions 
of those who support this bill, things 
like checking the abuse of the Federal 
Government’s power. But this com-
prehensive package would leave both 
consumers and creditors worse off than 
they are today. 
Certainly, there are elements that I 
do support, notably, language from the 
Fair Debt Collection Practices for 
Servicemembers Act. I was proud to co-
sponsor that particular bill when intro-
duced by Ms. DEAN from Pennsylvania, 
which passed the House last month. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices for 
Servicemembers Act would ensure that 
debt collectors won’t be able to threat-
en military servicemembers with a re-
duction in rank or have their security 
clearances 
revoked. 
Frankly, 
that 
keeps our military focused on fighting 
and winning our wars, instead of being 
co-opted into debt collection. 
But this is a truly partisan bill as 
packaged together, and it exemplifies 
what good work we can do when we 
work together in a bipartisan fashion, 
to see some of the components of it, 
and what can be done to undermine 
that work when it is all put together in 
the final package that we have before 
us here today. 
Once I took a look and saw the rest 
of this bill, the excitement I had for 
the components that I do support 
quickly dissipated. Taken as a whole, 
this 
overwhelmingly 
partisan 
bill 
amounts to a direct attack on creditors 
and an indirect attack on consumers. 
This bill would distort credit his-
tories by removing predictive informa-
tion from credit reports, including 
medical debt. While I recognize the im-
plications that such information has 
on credit history, we must understand 
that removing predictive information 
only increases the cost of credit. When 
uncertainty is higher, it is priced into 
the cost, for individuals as well as all 
consumers with low or moderate in-
come. 
Furthermore, this bill restricts the 
ability of debt collectors to collect on 
unpaid debt. It does this by forbidding 
debt collectors from contacting con-
sumers via simple communications, as 
my colleague, Mr. MCHENRY, was high-
lighting. While I think we can all agree 
that debt collectors should be forbid-
den from carrying out abusive prac-
tices, we should certainly not forbid 
them from using traditional commu-
nication tools that are likely to suc-
ceed in contacting the person that 
owes the debt. 
Additionally, in October of 2020, the 
CFPB issued a rule to modernize debt 
collection practices, and this rule re-
flects the technical precision needed to 
ensure that both consumers and debt 
collectors are protected. Rather than 
tying the hands of debt collectors, like 
this bill does, we should push for con-
sistency with that CFPB rule from last 
fall. 
In closing, I believe we should be 
clear on something. Consumers who 
owe a debt and businesses that are un-
able to collect the debt are both at a 
disadvantage when debt collectors are 
prohibited from contacting consumers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
am a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 
2547 and rise in its strong support. This 
important legislation contains my bill, 
the Small Business Lending Fairness 
Act, that prohibits the use of a confes-
sion of judgment in commercial loans 
at the Federal level. 
As chair of the House Small Business 
Committee, I understand better than 
most how the COVID–19 pandemic has 
restricted access to capital and forced 
the closure of many of America’s small 
businesses. 
Unfortunately, some lenders and debt 
collectors are seeking to cash in on the 
pandemic. Whether it is a taxi driver in 
New York City pursuing the American 
Dream or a small business owner try-
ing to make payroll, predatory lenders 
and collectors have been targeting 
small businesses with loans that have 
excessively high interest rates and un-
fair and abusive terms, like a confes-
sion of judgment. 
Because cash flow is so vital to a 
business’ survival, many owners feel 
they have no choice but to sign away 
their rights to save their businesses 
and provide for their employees. By 
signing a confession of judgment, bor-
rowers essentially waive the legal 
rights regarding any legal dispute that 
might arise. And if one does arise, the 
lender can unilaterally declare a de-
fault and take actions against the 
small business owner. 
Often, small business borrowers only 
find out about a judgment against 
them after the lender begins to seize 
bank accounts or other assets. 
While confessions of judgment have 
been banned at the Federal level for 
consumer loans since 1985, these pro-
tections have not been extended to 
commercial loans. Passing this legisla-
tion here today will bring us one step 
closer to finally ending this abusive 
practice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2282 
May 13, 2021 
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for including this important language 
in her bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I must say, for the 
RECORD, that I believe the bill’s spon-
sors are of sincere purpose here, but I 
am pointing out what I think are the 
deficiencies that we could have worked 
through in a bipartisan way if there 
was a goal to have a bipartisan out-
come for this bill. 
So while I oppose the bill, it is not 
for a lack of ideas on this side on how 
to improve it and actually how to come 
up with something reasonable to help 
our people and update our technology 
and laws. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
EMMER), the ranking member of the 
Task Force on Financial Technology. 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the Comprehen-
sive Debt Collection Improvement Act, 
a partisan package of bills which 
threatens to limit access to credit and 
other financial products that Ameri-
cans from all walks of life rely on. 
Simply put, this legislation under-
mines the collections process, the very 
system that ensures that Americans 
can access credit in the first place. 
Without a collections process, con-
sumers’ ability to obtain credit cards 
or other forms of credit would be re-
stricted, and, in many cases, limited to 
a cash-only basis. If adopted, this bill 
will limit Americans’ options and 
weaken our standard of living, a stand-
ard that every American deserves. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
misguided, partisan legislation and in-
stead support policies that expand fi-
nancial inclusion, strengthen our sys-
tem of credit, and support businesses 
that fuel our economy. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Com-
prehensive Debt Collection Improve-
ment Act, which includes my bill—and 
I thank the chairwoman for that—the 
Ending Debt Collection Harassment 
Act. 
Like many, my mother took pride in 
paying her bills and paying them on 
time. But after several life-disruptive 
events—the death of an immediate 
family member, a layoff, and a manda-
tory 
surgery—there 
came 
a 
point 
where she could no longer afford it. No 
matter how hard she worked, we owed 
everyone—the utility company, the 
landlord, the bank—and we were fre-
quently harassed by debt collectors. 
Our story is the story of millions of 
families. 
Due to poverty wages, a lack of af-
fordable healthcare, the absence of 
paid leave, and other policy failures 
which push working people to the mar-
gins, millions of people in America are 
forced to take on significant debt to 
survive. 
This is especially true during times 
of crisis, and debt collectors prey on 
that reality. They are making record 
profits during a pandemic, using ag-
gressive tactics to scare and to exploit 
people. 
Consumer complaints of shaming tac-
tics, of intimidation, of harassment, es-
pecially from our elders, continue to 
rise year after year. This bill provides 
the needed protection from mistreat-
ment and harassment. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this act. 
American families’ access to afford-
able loans depends on ensuring finan-
cial institutions have accurate credit 
history and can collect debts. 
The bill undermines both of those 
core requirements of our financial sys-
tem. By making it harder for lenders to 
learn about borrowers and collect these 
unpaid loans, the bill will actually end 
up reducing access to credit and in-
creasing prices. Let me repeat that. It 
is actually going to end up reducing ac-
cess to credit and is going to increase 
prices. 
In other words, the bill before us 
today will actually hurt the very peo-
ple it is intended to help. I think that 
is a really critical point here. By actu-
ally implementing this bill, what we 
are going to do is see higher prices, 
make it more difficult for individuals 
to obtain loans, and actually hurt 
those people that this bill is intended 
to help. 
I want more American families to 
have responsible access to the loans 
they need to be able to achieve their 
dreams. 
As anyone who has bought a home or 
a car or started a small business 
knows, access to affordable credit can 
be a critical lifeline. 
But, unfortunately, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, and in this 
bill in particular, they think that 
sometimes they know best. This bill, as 
a result, will actually hurt American 
families, it will hurt small businesses, 
and it will hurt the financial stability 
of our financial system. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this legislation. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
Congress passed the American Rescue 
Plan, a tremendous investment to sup-
port millions of workers without a pay-
check and behind on bills. As we begin 
work to build back a stronger economy 
post-pandemic, we must ensure that 
consumers are protected from bad faith 
debt collectors. 
The Fair Debt Collection Practices 
Act was enacted in 1977, almost 45 
years ago. Since then, much has 
changed, including the way we commu-
nicate, how we purchase goods, and the 
credit 
products 
we 
use. 
Chairman 
WATERS’ bill, the Comprehensive Debt 
Collection Improvement Act, provides 
much-needed updates to the FDCPA to 
fit the needs of consumers today, not 
in 1977. 
This legislation includes my bill, the 
Non-Judicial Foreclosure Debt Collec-
tion Clarification Act, which closes the 
gap in the FDCPA so that homeowners 
facing non-judicial foreclosure pro-
ceedings are protected under the law. 
The FDCPA sets procedures for the 
way that debt collectors interact with 
consumers to protect their rights and 
their privacy. This includes ensuring 
that debtors aren’t paying more than 
they owe, that their debt information 
won’t be shared with their boss, and 
that they will not be harassed by col-
lectors. These protections should not 
be limited to foreclosure proceedings 
that take place in a courtroom. 
The legislation we are considering 
today includes other necessary con-
sumer protection bills, like Congress-
woman DEAN’s Fair Debt Collection 
Practices 
for 
Servicemembers 
Act, 
which would prohibit debt collectors 
from threatening a servicemember’s 
rank to collect a debt, and Congress-
woman’s PRESSLEY’s bill, the Ending 
Debt Collection Harassment Act, which 
would prohibit debt collectors from 
contacting 
consumers 
electronically 
without consent. 
We cannot rebuild an economy that 
works for everyone without protecting 
consumers. Making sure borrowers are 
treated with dignity and protected 
from unwanted and unnecessary prac-
tices is an important step to ensuring 
economic fairness moving forward. I 
am proud to support the bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2547. 
First, I would like to thank and lift 
up Chairwoman WATERS for bringing 
up and authoring this important pack-
age, H.R. 2547, the Comprehensive Debt 
Collection Improvement Act, and for 
including two of my bills in this legis-
lation. We must work to ensure that 
debt collection is fair, transparent, and 
free from harassment. 
One of my two bills is in this pack-
age. It is the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices for Servicemembers Act. It 
will protect our heroes from unfair and 
aggressive debt harassment. These debt 
collection practices are manipulative 
and can interfere with soldiers’ careers, 
like contacting their superior officers 
or threatening a rank reduction. 
Unfortunately, these practices do not 
stop with the servicemember. Debt col-
lectors also target military spouses, 
unfairly burdening our military fami-
lies who have sacrificed so much.

cifically prohibit debt collectors from

conveying any threat to a servicemem-
ber, or his or her dependents, to have 
his or her rank reduced, their security 
clearance 
revoked, 
or 
prosecution 
occur under the Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Justice. 
These tactics must stop; our service-
members, men and women, make ex-
traordinary sacrifices on our behalf. I 
thank all the veterans and service-
members who work in my office, Tim, 
Dave, and Timmy, and my own two 
brothers who have fought to protect 
our country. 
I recognize and appreciate the bipar-
tisan support for this bill. 
My second bill in this package was 
written to correct an unfair practice a 
constituent brought to our office’s at-
tention. A constituent reached out for 
help getting a private student loan dis-
charged because her daughter had be-
come completely and totally perma-
nently disabled. The mother was left 
with the remaining balance of the 
daughter’s private student loans as a 
cosigner. 
The lending company said it was 
their policy to forgive the debt for the 
borrower but not for the cosigner of 
the original agreement. Further re-
search by my office staff revealed there 
was no legal operating standard for dis-
charging private student loans for co-
signers after a permanent and total 
disability. 
This is wrong. No one can anticipate 
permanent disability, and we should 
work to decrease the burden that these 
people and their families face, which is 
what the Private Loan Disability Dis-
charge Act will accomplish. 
This legislation will require private 
student loan lenders to discharge the 
loan balance for both the borrower and 
the cosigner if the borrower becomes 
totally and permanently disabled. 
This bill does not punish private 
lenders; it ensures all lenders are fol-
lowing the same rules. 
Both of these bills are about fairness 
and respect to the lender and con-
sumer, following the spirit of the en-
tire Comprehensive Debt Collection 
Improvement Act. 
This bill would protect servicemem-
bers, small and minority-owned busi-
nesses, student loan borrowers, and 
those with disabilities, medical debt, 
and more. 
This package will place consumers 
and people first. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for her leadership, and I urge all of our 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this important consumer and con-
stituent protection legislation. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, this bill is 
critically important to our families 
across the country. 
I am proud that this bill includes a 
provision that I have introduced the 
past two sessions of Congress, the Con-
sumer Protection for Medical Debt Col-
lection Act. 
Nearly 20 percent of adults have one 
or more medical debt collections listed 
on their credit reports. That means one 
in five of our neighbors across the 
country may be denied housing, trans-
portation, or other necessities because 
of a sudden health crisis or visit to the 
emergency room. That hits particu-
larly hard in communities like mine, 
where residents already face so many 
challenges with access to credit. 
Treating medical debt the same as 
other debt is just not right. It leads to 
irreparable harm to residents who sim-
ply just needed health and medical 
care. 
Medical debt is the leading cause of 
personal bankruptcy in our country, 
and the pandemic has only made the 
medical debt crisis worse; 2.5 million 
people saw medical debt enter collec-
tions since the pandemic began, total-
ing $2.2 billion in medical debt. 
H.R. 2547 will provide protections and 
safeguards 
to 
our 
neighbors 
who, 
through no fault of their own, got sick 
and could not afford medical care due 
to the broken healthcare system. 
This bill would prevent the collection 
of medical debt for 2 years from the 
date of medical billing and prohibits 
credit agencies from reporting all med-
ical collections for a year. 
Medical bills and reimbursements are 
often vague and confusing, so this gives 
our neighbors time to figure out what 
they actually do owe. 
Finally, this bill would ban medical 
debt from a medically necessary proce-
dure from ever appearing on your cred-
it report. 
No one chooses to get sick. Under-
going a medically necessary procedure 
should never haunt someone finan-
cially. It has no place on our credit re-
ports. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS for her 
leadership on this vital legislation, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as 
a practitioner, I rise. 
Having practiced law, I saw firsthand 
how predatory debt collection works. I 
know of the threats to get persons de-
moted. I know of the threats to cause 
people to lose their jobs. I know of the 
many threats to cause people to go to 
jail if they didn’t pay a debt. 
This is unlawful. It ought not hap-
pen, but it does. We know that there is 
no debtors’ prison in this country, but 
people still threaten people with going 
to jail if they don’t pay debts. 
Yes, servicemembers ought to be pro-
tected. I stand for them. But I also 
stand with the hardworking Americans 
who, through no fault of their own, will 
sometimes 
find 
themselves 
owing 
debts. 
This must pass. I support H.R. 2547. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Ms. WILLIAMS). 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of 
Chair WATERS’ Comprehensive Debt 
Collection 
Improvement 
Act 
and 
amendments that I have been able to 
make to the bill. 
Our work in Congress must focus on 
how to make life better for the most 
marginalized in our communities. This 
bill centers that goal by ensuring fair 
debt collection and consumer protec-
tion. Today, I am offering two amend-
ments to further advance that work. 
Currently, a borrower’s credit score 
isn’t negatively affected if they miss a 
Federal student loan payment during 
the pandemic. This protection was 
made possible with bipartisan support. 
It is time that we extend the same pro-
tection to private student loan bor-
rowers, and I am happy to have 
partnered with Congresswoman ALMA 
ADAMS to advance an amendment that 
does just that. 
I also authored an amendment that 
commissions a report to analyze racial 
disparities in debt collection practices 
and recommend solutions. Additional 
study in this area will help us ensure 
greater equity going forward. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments and the overall bill before 
us today. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 
2547. 
This bill is misguided. It will not im-
prove debt collection or credit report-
ing but will instead harm consumers 
and small businesses. 
This bill would make extending cred-
it more expensive for everyone, espe-
cially lower-income borrowers with 
thin or no credit files and who need it 
the most. 
This bill is yet another giveaway to 
progressives who want to eliminate the 
core foundation of our credit market 
and financial system. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
H.R. 2547, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
SUOZZI). The gentlewoman has 101⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
provides urgently needed protections 
to individuals and families from unfair 
and abusive debt collection practices. 
Consumers should not have to face 
harassment or threats from abusive 
debt collectors, especially in the midst 
of this unprecedented pandemic. It is 
long overdue for Congress to bring new 
accountability to the debt collection 
industry. 
Because of the strong protections the 
bill creates for consumers, the Com-
prehensive Debt Collection Improve-
ment Act is supported by more than 85 
consumer, civil rights, and small busi-
ness organizations, including Ameri-
cans for Financial Reform, Center for

Law Center, New York Taxi Workers

Mr. Speaker, you have heard the de-
bate and the discussion on this bill 
today. My colleagues on the opposite 
side of the aisle have tried in their 
presentation to have the people listen-
ing to this debate believe that the bill 
would hurt consumers. That is abso-
lutely not true. My friends on the op-
posite side of the aisle seem more in-
terested in protecting the debt collec-
tors. 
As I mentioned, we are still in the 
midst of a pandemic. Many of our con-
sumers have been laid off from their 
jobs. Some businesses have closed 
down. 
Americans like to pay their bills. 
They want to pay their bills. If they 
cannot pay their bills, we should not 
have debt collectors who are harassing 
them, calling the commanders of serv-
icemembers and threatening to have 
them penalized in some way, using all 
the different platforms to harass. 
One of the Members on the opposite 
side of the aisle tried to make us be-
lieve that somehow we are saying you 
can’t use any of the platforms on the 
internet. We are not saying that. We 
are saying don’t misuse them, don’t 
abuse them. We are saying that this is 
about the Members of Congress who are 
sent here to represent their constitu-
ents being able to represent them at 
one of the most important times in 
this economy. 
I would ask all Members, despite 
what you have heard from the opposite 
side of the aisle, to rise to this occa-
sion and show our consumers we care 
about them and do not want them to be 
harassed and abused. 
These predatory debt collectors must 
stop the way that they are harassing 
our consumers and work with them. 
They should be doing workouts. If you 
can’t pay $50 a month, you can have a 
workout that says you can pay $10 a 
month or $15 a month on your debt. Of 
course, the predatory debt collectors 
can do this if they wish. 
One of the things you must under-
stand is they have earned more in prof-
its during this pandemic than any 
other time in recent years, so they are 
gouging, and they are harassing need-
lessly so. 
I would ask the Members of Congress 
to please join us and vote ‘‘aye’’ on this 
very important legislation. I yield 
back the balance of my time.

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
set of amendments that will strengthen 
the protections in my bill, H.R. 2547, 
the Comprehensive Debt Collection Im-
provement Act. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
ADAMS, 
BONAMICI, 
BOWMAN, 
BUSH, 
COHEN, 
CRAIG, NEWMAN, OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, 
PAYNE, ROSS, and WILLIAMS for their 
work on their amendments to improve 
the bill and provide additional protec-
tions for consumers. 
These amendments would create a 
Consumer Bill of Rights Against Abu-
sive Debt Collection Practices, putting 
in plain language what debt collection 
protections and remedies a consumer 
has; require CFPB strategy to use their 
enforcement and other tools to combat 
abusive debt collection during the pan-
demic; study racial disparities in debt 
collection and develop solutions to ad-
dress these disparities. 
Several amendments would also help 
students by providing private student 
loan borrowers with the same credit re-
porting protections that Federal stu-
dent loan borrowers have during the 
pandemic; releasing cosigners in the 
event of the death of a private student 
loan borrower, regardless of when that 
debt occurred; studying practices and 
additional reforms to better protect 
private student loan borrowers. 
Finally, these amendments address 
new forms of communication specifi-
cally prohibiting debt collectors from 
harassing a consumer on social media, 
and studying electronic communica-
tions and developing recommendations 
to further protect consumers from har-
assment. 
Together, these amendments will 
protect our constituents from abusive 
debt collectors. So I urge Members to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
claim the time in opposition, and I am 
opposed to this en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
people are hurting. There is no doubt 
that many Americans continue to feel 
the weight of the pandemic in their 
daily lives. Yet Republicans know that 
preventing individuals and businesses 
from being paid for services rendered 
will not help those individuals and 
families who need it the most. 
This bill will not benefit consumers 
or businesses, particularly those small 
businesses that are the backbone of our 
economy. In fact, if enacted, this bill 
and the amendments will drive up the 
cost for all borrowers and will make 
credit less accessible to the borrowers 
who need it the most. Many of these 
amendments were not even considered 
during markup, and could result in un-
intended consequences and conflict 
with existing law and regulations. 
For example, this en bloc makes it 
harder to collect on payment for serv-
ices. It creates more confusion. This en 
bloc requires duplicative actions and is 
in conflict with current CFPB rules. 
This results in consumers receiving 
varying and inconsistent information. 
It also imposes specific requirements 
on the process and content of legal ac-
tions—some in direct conflict with ex-
isting laws and court procedures. 
All of these have potential con-
sequences and deserve to be debated 
through regular order, not in the 11th 
hour on the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, this en bloc continues 
the Democrats’ goal of bringing all stu-
dent loan borrowers under the Federal 
student loan portfolio, this time under 
the guise of COVID relief. In expanding 
the Federal student loan profile, this 
en bloc fails to address the underlying 
issues related to the Federal student 
loan debt crisis, which was already ex-
acerbated by the Democrats’ goal of 
nationalizing student lending in 2010. 
This en bloc fails to recognize the 
success of the private student loan 
market. Approximately 98 percent of 
student loans are repaid in the private 
market. 
This en bloc continues to ignore the 
work that the CFPB did when it final-
ized its debt collection rule last fall. 
This final rule reflects more than 7 
years of research and analysis, and 
clarifies the allowable uses of modern 
communication technology. 
This en bloc prohibits debt collectors 
from contacting consumers by email or 
text message without explicit prior 
consent from the consumer. Under this 
amendment, social media messages are 
also prohibited. This approach ignores 
the fact that the final rule allows con-
sumers to opt out of specific means of 
communications used by debt collec-
tors. 
Republicans believe that consumers 
should be able to communicate about 
their payment options privately and 
using the methods that they want to 
communicate. 
This is yet another example of Demo-
crats attempting to hamstring the 
ability to modernize the regulatory 
framework to account for modern tech-
nology and consumer preference. 
Finally, this en bloc requires the 
CFPB to produce a prescriptive report 
on the debt collection process. The 
CFPB, in consultation with the FTC, 
already issues an annual oversight re-
port on debt collection, which includes 
data on consumer complaints and en-
forcement actions. 
The point is, constraining debt col-
lection will undermine the under-
writing system and increase risk to the 
financial 
system. 
This 
ultimately 
makes extending credit more expensive 
for all borrowers and may exclude the 
lowest income borrowers entirely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2287 
May 13, 2021 
There are commonsense ways to up-
date and improve the process for debt 
collection and credit reporting. 
Republicans believe that consumers 
who owe a debt should be treated with 
respect and dignity and are not sub-
jected to abusive or harassing behav-
iors. While there are commonsense 
ways to update and improve the debt 
collection process, the law already up-
holds this notion. 
Mr. Speaker, this en bloc is another 
partisan wish list of progressive poli-
cies in search of a problem. I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Or-
egon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this en bloc amendment. 
I have done financial counseling for 
low-income clients at Legal Aid and I 
learned firsthand that people don’t 
struggle by choice. 
I was an attorney at the Federal 
Trade Commission where my work in-
volved enforcing the Fair Debt Collec-
tion Practices Act. I have seen how 
predatory debt collection tactics hurt 
our families and our communities. Con-
sumers face harassment at home and at 
work. They frequently get misinforma-
tion about debts they might not even 
legally owe. The problems around debt 
collection are pervasive. 
Data from the Urban Institute shows 
that 68 million Americans had a debt in 
collection before the pandemic, and 
most consumers sued by collection 
agencies don’t have legal representa-
tion. 
My amendment will update the law 
so consumers get advance notice of 
legal action against them and accurate 
details about what they legally owe. 
Strengthening 
protections 
for 
con-
sumers will help individuals and fami-
lies get through this economic crisis 
and beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support the en bloc 
amendment and the underlying bill. I 
thank Chairwoman WATERS and Chair-
man PERLMUTTER for their leadership. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her and the 
committee’s leadership on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise 
today in support of the Comprehensive 
Debt Collection Improvement Act, crit-
ical legislation that would enhance 
debt collection protections for con-
sumers, students, servicemembers, and 
small businesses. 
This pandemic has devastated Black 
and Brown communities, like mine in 
St. Louis. As someone who was unin-
sured during this pandemic, got sick, 
and is still struggling with those med-
ical bills, I know the hardship faced 
every day by people across this coun-
try. 
My amendment to this bill would re-
quire the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau to present a report to Con-
gress that analyzes debt collection 
practices using consumer complaint 
data. Debt collectors should not be able 
to call, email, text you to the point of 
harassment. Your medical debt should 
not be reported on your credit, espe-
cially in the wake of a global pan-
demic. 
The CFPB has an obligation to pro-
tect our seniors, protect our frontline 
workers, protect our service workers, 
and protect our families by developing 
tools to combat predatory debt collec-
tion practices. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. BOWMAN). 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of Americans 
have debt, and we punish people for it. 
But the shame should actually be on 
policies that incentivize debt and pred-
atory behavior in debt collection. The 
lack of protections in place for bor-
rowers is a reflection of those harmful 
policies. 
Debt collectors today can use vir-
tually any means available to harass 
borrowers, even in the middle of a glob-
al pandemic that has taken nearly 
600,000 American lives, increased unem-
ployment, and left millions unsure of 
how they will put food on the table. 
Debt collectors can call you, email 
you, text you, and even contact you on 
social media. My amendment will help 
rein in this endless harassment by pro-
hibiting collectors from contacting 
borrowers on social media without ex-
plicit permission. 
Mr. Speaker, while there is still more 
work to be done on this front, this an 
important place to start, and I encour-
age my colleagues to support the 
amendment. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for her important 
work on this bill and for helping with 
my amendment to be included therein. 
The amendment that I have is co-
sponsored by Representatives OCASIO- 
CORTEZ and BONAMICI. It adds a section 
to the law that says, if you have got a 
debt that is beyond the statute of limi-
tations, that debt collection companies 
can’t go after you. 
There is a statute of limitations be-
cause sometimes over a period of time, 
the facts become kind of vague in peo-
ple’s minds. So the proof isn’t strong, 
and they want to make sure that this 
could be an appropriate subject matter 
for a court case. 
Also, sometimes debts are sold and 
debt collection agencies buy them, and 
they don’t really know the facts, the 
amounts, and all of that. So if a debt is 
over the statute, this prohibits the 
debt collectors from going after some-
one. 
I think I found this about 8 years ago 
in an AARP magazine, which I read, 
and they said how awful this was. And 
I thought it was, too. It took 8 years to 
get it here because it took a Demo-
cratic team to bring it to the floor to 
look out for debtors. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate all the sup-
port we have got from my cosponsors, 
and I hope we pass the bill. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for yielding and 
for including my amendment in this en 
bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, years ago, a bright and 
talented young man from Eagan named 
Ryan Frascone took out student loans 
to enroll in classes at Metro State Uni-
versity. Ryan studied engineering. He 
was a kind, engaging, and hardworking 
young man. But, in 2013, Ryan passed 
away—one of thousands who have trag-
ically fallen victim to the opioid epi-
demic plaguing this Nation. 
b 1330 
In the midst of that tragedy, I am 
sure student loans were the last thing 
on his parents, Julie and Mark’s minds. 
But to this day, 8 years after losing 
their son Ryan, his parents must still 
write a check every month to pay for 
his student loans. 
I think we can all agree that the last 
thing that any American parent should 
have to undergo is a monthly reminder 
of such tragedy and loss in the form of 
a student loan payment. Today, we 
have an opportunity to right that 
wrong with this amendment. 
Please join me in supporting the 
Ryan Frascone Memorial Student Loan 
Relief Act. And to Mark and Julie, I 
want to say to you, on the anniversary 
of his death this week, we are going to 
make this right in this country. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, these amendments of-
fered by our colleagues make H.R. 2547 
even stronger for our constituents who 
deserve to be treated fairly. I would 
like to again thank Representatives 
ADAMS, 
BONAMICI, 
BOWMAN, 
BUSH, 
COHEN, CRAIG, NEWMAN, OCASIO-CORTEZ, 
OMAR, PAYNE, ROSS, and WILLIAMS for 
their work on these amendments to 
H.R. 2547. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these amendments, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time, and I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this en

Mr. Speaker, this en bloc will not im-
prove debt collection or credit report-
ing, but will instead harm consumers 
and small businesses. It will make ex-
tending credit more expensive for ev-
eryone, especially lower income bor-
rowers with thin or no credit files and 
who need it the most. 
The intent is clear, the Democrats 
want to eliminate the core foundation 
of our credit market and financial sys-
tem. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this en bloc, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

fies any impacts that imposing restrictions 
on debt collection will have on low- to mod-
erate-income and minority borrowers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 380, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS) and the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER) each will con-
trol 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the amendments offered by Representa-
tives LUETKEMEYER and BURGESS. Rep-
resentative BURGESS’ amendment does 
not provide any new protections for 
low-income consumers or consumers 
with no credit or poor credit history. 
Instead, this is an attempt to prevent 
my bill, H.R. 2547, from being imple-
mented at all. Under the guise of a cer-
tification 
standard, 
Mr. 
BURGESS’ 
amendment would create a legal loop-
hole for unscrupulous debt collectors 
to challenge and potentially block not 
just some, but all of the protections in-
cluded in this bill for servicemembers, 
student borrowers, borrowers with a 
medical debt, and so many more. 
This is not a serious attempt to have 
low-income borrowers, it is an attempt 
to protect debt collectors who are mak-
ing record profits during this pan-
demic. 
I do not support this poison pill 
amendment. Representative LUETKE-
MEYER’s amendment to study and delay 
misses the mark on what is needed to 
protect consumers from the harm of 
ongoing, unfair debt collection prac-
tices. 
Copious research has been shown 
that debt collection harassment and 
mistreatment 
have 
created 
undue 
stress and financial burdens on con-
sumers, especially for low-income peo-
ple, and in communities of color. 
My bill does not restrict debt collec-
tion, but rather ensures consumer pro-
tection for those who are facing harass-
ment or other abusive tactics used by 
debt collectors. 
Millions of consumers are still strug-
gling to make ends meet during this 
tragic public health pandemic. Instead 
of considering the amount of stress 
consumers feel when they get sick, 
need medical care, and face harassment 
from a debt collector, Mr. LUETKE-
MEYER’s amendment would commission 
a study and delay implementation of 
my bill by a full year. 
H.R. 2547 would already provide the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
with a sensible 6-month implementa-
tion period, during which the Bureau 
can give all stakeholders guidance on 
how to comply. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose both of these amendments, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
am not opposed to this en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, these amendments will 
ensure that we know the true con-
sequences of this bill before it is en-
acted into law. These amendments di-
rect the Treasury Department and the 
GAO to separately study the impacts 
this bill will have on low-to-moderate 
income, minority, or thin-or no-credit- 
file consumers. 
Payment for services rendered is a 
fundamental premise of our free mar-
ket system. Republicans understand 
this concept and work hard to ensure 
legislation does not cut off access to 
credit or price large swaths of Ameri-
cans out of the consumer credit mar-
ket. 
Moreover, we should not be limiting 
small businesses’ ability to collect pay-
ments at any time, but especially when 
they are already hurting from the pan-
demic-related shutdowns. 
The point is, constraining debt col-
lection will undermine the under-
writing system and increase risk to the 
financial 
system. 
This 
ultimately 
makes extending credit more expensive 
for all borrowers, and may exclude the 
lowest income borrowers entirely. 
There is bipartisan consensus that a 
consumer who owes a debt should be 
treated with respect and dignity and 
not 
be 
subjected 
to 
abusive 
or 
harassing behavior. The law already 
upholds this notion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this en bloc, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the chairwoman, the gentle-
woman from California for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a stupendous ef-
fort, and I did not want to miss the op-
portunity to speak on behalf of my 
constituents, for debt blocks you from 
living your life as a family, as a recent 
college graduate, as a veteran, and as 
an enlisted person. All of these people 
are in my congressional district. Texas 
has the highest number of military per-
sonnel. 
Have you ever had them come into 
your house, excuse me, into your of-
fice—sometimes it is like my house be-
cause I live there, almost—and tell you 
about the inability to access credit, or 
the eviction notice, or the repossessing 
of the car, and therefore, impacting on 
their credit, but more importantly, 
being threatened to lose benefits by 
outside debt collectors. 
So the legislation here, and might I 
rise to oppose the amendments that are 
en bloc at this time, but I thought it 
was important to be able to discuss the 
importance of this particular combina-
tion of legislation that goes to the very 
needs and hearts of our district by pro-
hibiting the use of confession of judg-
ment as an unfair credit practice, and 
providing the opportunity, as I said, to 
ensure that we are protecting those in-
dividuals that are military.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2289 
May 13, 2021 
According to the CFPB, in the past 
year, debt collection accounted for 27 
percent of all complaints received, 49 
percent of which were for attempts to 
collect 
a 
debt 
not 
owed. 
During 
COVID–19 
people 
suffered 
economi-
cally. 
For example, in April 2020, Kate 
Boatswain, Texas resident and grand-
mother of three, had been laid off from 
work due to the pandemic. Her savings 
account had held a $4,900 tax refund. 
But when she checked her account, it 
showed a negative balance. Ms. Boat-
swain drove to her credit union to find 
out what happened, only to be told that 
staff members were not allowed to ex-
plain. She was given a number to a 
debt collection law firm. They had 
taken her money. 
So this legislation that protects mili-
tary 
persons, 
grandmothers, 
small 
business owners, is extremely crucial, 
and I ask my colleagues to support this 
legislation, H.R. 2547. Let’s stop debt 
and let’s make sure Americans can 
thrive. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the rule 
governing debate of H.R. 2547, the ‘‘Com-
prehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act,’’ 
which is an incredibly important comprehen-
sive bill that clarifies and expands the rights of 
Americans facing all forms of debt collection, 
and also extends existing consumer protec-
tions to small businesses, prohibits debt col-
lectors from threatening service members with 
a reduction in rank or loss of security clear-
ance, restricts contact to consumers by email 
or text messages, and requires discharge of 
private student loans in the case of permanent 
disability for the borrower. 
H.R. 2547 better protects vulnerable con-
sumers by enacting a wide variety of critical 
reforms, including: 
Prohibiting the use of confessions of judg-
ment as an unfair credit practice that eliminate 
notice and the right to be heard; 
Prohibiting certain abusive collection prac-
tices directed at servicemembers, including 
threats to reduce rank or revoke security 
clearance; 
Requiring discharge of private student loans 
due to total and permanent disability; 
Prohibiting collection of medical debt for the 
first two years and credit reporting of debt 
arising from any medically necessary proce-
dures; 
Requiring debt collectors to obtain consent 
before using electronic communications and 
provide written validation notices; 
Amending the FDCPA to expand and clarify 
coverage, including extending coverage for all 
federal, state, and local debts collected by 
debt collectors; 
Adjusting statutory damages in the FDCPA 
for inflation and indexing them to index for in-
flation in the future; and 
Clarifying FDCPA coverage for non-judicial 
foreclosures. 
An estimated 77 million Americans have a 
debt that has been turned over to a private 
collection agency, and predatory debt collec-
tion affects communities and families across 
the country. 
The debts owed can be as small as a few 
dollars, and they can involve every kind of 
consumer debt, from car payments to utility 
bills to student loans to medical fees. 
Debt in collection can wreak havoc on indi-
viduals, subjecting them to harassing debt col-
lection calls and potential lawsuits. 
Annually, hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals face threats, harassment at home and the 
workplace, and abusive litigation from unscru-
pulous debt collectors. 
While all Americans are covered by laws 
barring debt collectors from overly aggressive 
or deceptive tactics, these laws are insufficient 
in many cases, and protections for Americans 
must be improved. 
Debt collectors use predatory tactics that 
undermine citizens’ rights with misleading and 
confusing information. 
Each year, millions of lawsuits are filed by 
‘‘lawsuit mills,’’ and in some cases, thousands 
of affidavits are filed in a single day that have 
inaccurate information about the debt and the 
debtors. 
Consumers are often not even given the 
chance to defend themselves because collec-
tors hire process servers that falsely certify 
documents have been delivered. 
Most consumers are not represented by an 
attorney and debt collectors overwhelmingly 
seek default judgments against them in these 
cases. 
This past year has seen a rise in aggressive 
debt collections due to the impact of COVID– 
19, according to the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau (‘‘CFPB’’). 
Despite the enactment of the FDCPA in 
1977, debt collection remains a frequent 
source of complaints to the CFPB. 
According to the CFPB, in the past year 
debt collection accounted for 27 percent of all 
complaints received, 49 percent of which were 
for attempts to collect a debt not owed. 
These trends devastate communities across 
the country as unmanageable debt and house-
hold financial crises become ubiquitous across 
the country during this pandemic, and they im-
pact Black and LatinX communities most 
harshly due to longstanding racial and ethnic 
gaps in poverty and wealth. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has been among 
the most disruptive long-term events we will 
see in our lifetimes, and it is not surprising 
that the shockwaves it sent across the planet 
were felt deeply in the consumer financial 
marketplace. 
Texans have the second-highest rate of 
debt in collections in the country and are 
uniquely vulnerable because the state’s con-
sumer protections for bank account garnish-
ments are virtually nonexistent. 
For example, in April 2020 Kate Boatswain, 
Texas resident and grandmother of three, had 
been laid off work due to the pandemic. 
Her savings account had held a $4,900 tax 
refund, but when she checked her account, it 
showed a negative balance. 
Ms. Boatswain drove to her credit union to 
find out what happened, only to be told that 
staff members were not allowed to explain 
why. 
She was given a number to a debt collec-
tion law firm, and a man at the firm tersely ex-
plained that she had owed money to Wells 
Fargo since 2006. 
The debt was now owned by a client of the 
law firm who was trying to collect, and the cli-
ent was not interested in solutions—telling Ms. 
Boatswain that, ‘‘We already have your 
money.’’ 
In a time of national crisis and economic 
hardship, Ms. Boatswain was left without 
money for her mortgage and for her family. 
As we work to bolster our national economic 
recovery, Americans must have better safe-
guards against predatory debt collection ac-
tions like this. 
This bill offers comprehensive reforms 
against predatory debt collection efforts in sev-
eral ways, and I would like to touch on two 
protections included in these reforms—those 
reforms offered for our small business owners 
and members of the military. 
Since at least 2018, an arcane legal docu-
ment called a confession of judgment has tar-
geted our hard-working small businesses and 
forced financial ruin on tens of thousands of 
contractors and small business owners. 
Before many small business owners get a 
loan, they are forced to sign a statement 
called a confession of judgment which gives 
up their right to defend themselves if the lend-
er takes them to court. 
Armed with this confession of judgment, a 
lender can, without proof, accuse borrowers of 
not paying and legally seize their assets be-
fore they know what has happened—a prac-
tice that has not surprisingly been abused by 
some lenders. 
Then, without contacting the borrower, lend-
ers can immediately withdraw the value of the 
loan, including the full interest payments, from 
their accounts. 
By requiring the borrower to accept any and 
all liabilities and damages pertaining to the 
loan, it undermines and circumvents the entire 
judicial process. 
The borrower has no legal right to dispute 
these claims or prove their compliance with 
the terms of the loan contract, making them 
virtually powerless to reclaim—what often 
ends up being—their life’s savings. 
Although Congress banned the use of con-
fessions of judgment for consumers in 1985, 
small businesses were left exposed and re-
main particularly susceptible to this unfair debt 
collection practice. 
H.R. 2547 fixes this oversight by extending 
the ban on confessions of judgment to com-
mercial loans nationally by amending the Truth 
in Lending Act and closing the loophole that 
has allowed thousands of American small 
businesses to be seized and brought down by 
dishonest lenders. 
Military members and their families face par-
ticular financial challenges requiring extra pro-
tections: in service to their country, they relo-
cate frequently, deploy overseas and are a 
prime target for scammers. 
Military members are also more vulnerable 
to debt collectors in some instances, and debt 
collectors have taken advantage of this vulner-
ability by targeting members of the Armed 
Services through calling their superior officers, 
threatening reduction in rank and even courts- 
martial. 
Nearly 40 percent of complaints filed by 
servicemembers with the CFPB concern debt 
collection—as compared to only 26 percent by 
non-servicemembers. 
Our servicemen and servicewomen make 
extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf, and 
they should not be forced to confront aggres-
sive and manipulative debt collectors who cap-
italize on the strains required of them in the 
course of their duties. 
We must address this fact and protect the 
women and men who have served our country 
and remove the unethical methods debt col-
lectors use to prey upon our servicemembers. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members to 
support this legislation, because it is critical for

SEC. 5. EXCLUSION OF PAID MEDICAL DEBT. 
Section 605(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (15 U.S.C. 1681c(a)) is amended by adding 
at the end the following: 
‘‘(9) Paid debt arising from the receipt of 
medically necessary, non-elective medical 
services, products, or devices which from the 
date of payment, antedate the report by

SEC. 6. OPT-OUT NOTICE FOR ELECTRONIC COM-
MUNICATIONS 
OR 
ATTEMPTS 
TO 
COMMUNICATE. 
Section 805 of the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692c), as amended 
by this Act, is further amended by adding at 
the end the following new subsection: 
‘‘(f) OPT-OUT NOTICE FOR ELECTRONIC COM-
MUNICATIONS
OR
ATTEMPTS
TO
COMMU-
NICATE.—A debt collector who communicates 
or attempts to communicate with a con-
sumer electronically in connection with the 
collection of a debt using a specific email ad-
dress, telephone number for text messages, 
or other electronic-medium address shall in-
clude in such communication or attempt to 
communicate a clear and conspicuous state-
ment describing a reasonable and simple 
method by which the consumer can opt out 
of further electronic communications or at-
tempts to communicate by the debt collector 
to that address or telephone number. The 
debt collector may not require, directly or 
indirectly, that the consumer, in order to 
opt out, pay any fee to the debt collector or 
provide any information other than the con-
sumer’s opt-out preferences and the email 
address, telephone number for text messages, 
or other electronic-medium address subject 
to the opt-out request.’’. 
SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
Except as otherwise provided, this Act and 
the amendments made by this Act shall take 
effect on the date that is 180 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 380, the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Missouri. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, since taking the major-
ity in the House last Congress, Demo-
crats have attempted to undermine the 
financial system through a partisan 
wish list that is focused on one thing: 
undermining the pillars of our finan-
cial system. Now with one party domi-
nating, they are jamming through a 
bill that will not only hurt the very 
borrowers they claim they are trying 
to help, but it will bring down our cred-
it markets. 
There is no doubt that individuals 
and families are hurting. There is no 
doubt that the pandemic brought on 
additional 
challenges. 
But 
under-
mining our financial system is not the 
way to help Americans. 
Our financial system needs strong 
underwriting 
practices 
to 
keep 
it 
strong and reduce risk when extending 
credit. This is what makes credit more 
available at a lower cost to more bor-
rowers. This is not to say that the sys-
tem is perfect. Republicans agree there 
are some improvements that can be 
made to the way the system operates. 
The gentleman’s amendment would 
replace the underlying bill with several 
targeted approaches to improve the 
debt collection and credit reporting 
framework. 
First, this amendment requires the 
inclusion of a clear disclosure when a 
confession of judgment, or COJ, is part 
of a business lending contract. It also 
requires lenders to obtain a written af-
fidavit containing the date and nature 
of a borrower’s default in order to exe-
cute a confession of judgment. This 
will help to ensure small businesses 
know the full terms and conditions of 
their agreement and help to crack 
down on reported misuse of COJs while 
allowing these important repayment 
tools to remain in use. 
This amendment preserves the serv-
icemember protection bill sponsored by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania. 
In fact, I would remind my colleagues 
that we just passed this bill on suspen-
sion 3 weeks ago. We should focus on 
getting this bill enacted into law rath-
er than packaging it up in a wish list of 
partisan policies. 
This amendment would allow the es-
tate of a deceased or permanently dis-
abled student loan borrower to request 
a discharge of the student loan debt. 
This change would codify the current 
practice used by private lenders to en-
sure that student loan borrowers are 
indeed protected. 
This amendment would also address 
concerns with medical debt. It would 
eliminate the inclusion of paid, medi-
cally necessary, nonelective medical 
debt in credit reports. This provision is 
a responsible way to address the chal-
lenges that many face in repaying med-
ical debt. At the same time, it does not 
make healthcare more expensive or 
services less available. 
Finally, this amendment acknowl-
edges the work of the CFPB. What my 
colleagues won’t tell you is that the 
final debt collection rule was the cul-
mination of more than 7 years of re-
search and analysis. It clarified the al-
lowable uses of modern communication 
technology. 
This amendment, unlike the under-
lying bill, is a commonsense approach 
to improve the consumer experience in 
debt collection and credit reporting. It 
will strengthen our financial system 
while increasing options and choices 
for consumers when they owe debt. 
I hope my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will recognize this ef-
fort to make improvements that will 
benefit consumers and small busi-
nesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
ranking member’s amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the substitute amendment offered by 
our committee’s ranking member, Mr. 
MCHENRY. 
Mr. MCHENRY’s partisan proposal is a 
nonstarter and not a serious attempt 
to find common ground with bipartisan 
support. The Republican substitute 
amendment does not include several 
important elements of my bill, H.R. 
2547, and fundamentally weakens many 
essential protections in the few provi-
sions he included. 
For example, Mr. MCHENRY included 
a prohibition on confessions of judg-
ment based on title I. However, he in-
cluded a harmful provision related to 
written affidavits, effectively under-
mining the prohibition on confessions 
of judgment, and severely reducing pro-
tections for small businesses struggling 
during this pandemic. 
The 
Federal 
Trade 
Commission 
banned confessions of judgment more 
than 35 years ago in 1985 for consumer 
loans. Our committee learned that 
small business owners, like taxicab 
drivers, have unwittingly waived their 
typical due process rights when it 
comes to debt collection because these 
harmful confessions of judgment terms 
were tucked into their small business 
loan. 
Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ has been 
leading the effort on this in the House, 
working in a bipartisan fashion with 
Senators BROWN and RUBIO. However, if 
we take the approach proposed by Mr. 
MCHENRY, small businesses will con-
tinue to be ripped off. 
Moreover, I would add H.R. 2547 in-
cludes several other bipartisan provi-
sions, including title II, which is based 
on a bill by Representative DEAN to 
protect servicemembers from harass-
ment and threats from debt collectors. 
The House has unanimously passed 
title II as a standalone bill twice, both 
last year and this year. 
Additionally, title VI would enhance 
protections related to Federal agency 
debts based on a bill by Representative 
CLEAVER that has been bipartisan for a 
number of years, but when we tried to 
move it on the suspension calendar last 
year, Republicans changed their mind. 
Unfortunately, at a time when con-
sumers are suffering while debt collec-
tors make record profits during the 
pandemic, the House Republican alter-
native is not a serious effort to reform 
and modernize our debt collection laws. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject the McHenry sub-
stitute amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
reject the amendment from the rank-
ing member, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. I reject it because it 
undermines the premise of the chair-
woman’s bill. The premise of the chair-
woman’s bill is not prudential under-
writing as a core premise of our econ-
omy which, of course, we need. It is not 
about payments for goods and services

which is obviously a pillar of the 
United States system of business. 
It is about fairness. It is about fair-
ness in the allocation of credit and 
fairness in the collection of debt. 
What the chairwoman has put for-
ward and what the amendment from 
the ranking member would undermine 
is a bill that recognizes that people 
should 
not 
be 
punished 
for 
cir-
cumstances outside of their control. 
They should not be precluded from ac-
cessing credit for something that hap-
pened to them that they did not wish 
upon themselves, and that they had no 
volition in doing. 
For example, this bill would ensure 
that medical debts do not prohibit peo-
ple’s access to credit. The senior Sen-
ator from my home State of Massachu-
setts famously demonstrated that med-
ical bankruptcies were plaguing the 
middle class and the working class in 
this country. Indeed, the Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau has reported 
that medical debt has a significant im-
pact on consumer credit. After Ameri-
cans 
undergo 
lifesaving 
treatment, 
they should not have to worry about 
the impact of a necessary medical pro-
cedure that they will have to stay at 
home to convalesce will have on their 
ability to then restart their life, start 
a business, or care for their family. 
H.R. 2547 seeks to give consumers 
time to fully recover until they are 
able to pay their bills. Nobody chooses 
to get sick, Mr. Speaker, and being 
sick should not show up on your credit 
report as you seek to access credit in 
the future. 
This bill is also about fairness in how 
we collect debts. There, of course, 
should be payments for goods and serv-
ices, but there does not need to be and 
there should not be harassment. 
As a former marine officer, it deeply 
concerns me that servicemembers who 
need to concentrate on the mission at 
hand might be distracted, and, indeed, 
might even be demoted for debts out-
side of their control. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment re-
places the underlying bill with tar-
geted approaches to improve the debt 
collection and credit reporting frame-
work. This amendment preserves op-
tions for consumers and ensures that 
small businesses are paid for services 
that they provide. This amendment 
will ensure our financial system re-
mains safe and sound. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 380, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 13, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on 
May 13, 2021, at 11 :31 a.m.: 
That the Senate passed S. 1585. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk.

HONORING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF ALCORN STATE UNI-
VERSITY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Alcorn 
State University on their 150th anni-
versary. 
Founded in 1871, Alcorn State Uni-
versity is the oldest historically Black 
land-grant institution in the United 
States and the second-oldest supported 
institution of higher learning in the 
State of Mississippi. 
Alcorn State University is one of the 
most important institutions to nurture 
and develop African Americans. Alcorn 
has laid the foundation for many pro-
fessionals by giving them a valued edu-
cation. Their mission is to intellectu-
ally develop young Americans, produce 
graduates to be lifelong learners, pre-
pare them to be well-rounded leaders of 
high character, while equipping them 
with the necessary skills to be success-
ful in a global marketplace. 
Alcorn’s vision is to develop diverse 
students 
into 
globally 
competitive 
leaders that will benefit communities, 
States, nations, and the world. I know 
Alcorn State University will continue 
to provide students with the tools they 
need to claim success. 
As Alcorn celebrates its 150th anni-
versary, their reservation is well-suited 
for many more successful years. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO STEVE ROSE 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to my dear friend, 
Steve Rose, who passed away on De-
cember 14, 2020. 
He lived his whole life in Knoxville, 
served our country in the U.S. Marine 
Corps, and went on to graduate from 
Fulton High School after he left the 
Corps and attend the University of 
Tennessee. 
Steve was known around town as a 
hell-raiser who never did anything 
halfway. He was an adrenaline junkie 
who enjoyed things like boxing and 
motocross racing, and he lit up Knox-
ville’s music scene playing the drums 
with local bands around town. 
Above all else, Steve had a ferocious 
love for his friends and family. He 
showed an unconditional love to Jan-
ice, his devoted of wife of 52 years, 
until the moment he passed away with 
her by his side. He was an amazing fa-
ther to his children, Amy, Michael, and 
Tracy; and he spent many years work-
ing hard to get Amy the best possible 
care for her cerebral palsy. 
Five years ago, a stroke left his body 
broken, but his strong-willed spirit 
stayed intact. He never let his condi-
tion dampen his attitude, and he kept 
on loving friends and family with the 
same vigor he always had. 
Mr. Speaker, he will be truly missed 
by those who knew him. 
JUVENILE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
REFORM 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as 
we speak about criminal justice re-
form, sometimes children and juveniles 
are missing—many in the juvenile 
criminal justice system. 
Today, in the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, we had a powerful hearing that 
spoke about the integrating of juve-
niles into a new system and to ensure 
that we move forward on preventing ju-
veniles from serving in the same facili-
ties as adults; to not in any way cede 
to a sentence of a life without parole; 
and to realize the best life for juveniles 
who may have had a detour, who may 
have been traumatized, who may have, 
because of the non-maturity of their 
brain, done something wrong. 
But there is a life after. And we 
should look for those systems that in-
tegrate that juvenile back into society. 
Intervention. And after the incarcer-
ation, to be able to bring them to a 
point where they can be contributing 
to our society. 
That is what we are going to move 
on, the House Committee on the Judi-
ciary. I encourage my colleagues to 
join us, because our juveniles are not 
our tomorrows; they are our todays. 
f 
HONORING JERRY CLARK 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor my 
uncle, Jerry Clark, who, sadly, passed 
away on May 5 at the age of 88. 
Uncle Jerry was born and raised in 
Des Moines, Iowa, and graduated from 
Johnstone High School in 1950. Soon 
after, he was drafted in the U.S. Army 
and served until 1955. Following his dis-
charge, he was a Des Moines fire-
fighter, retiring after 33 years of serv-
ice. And while working for the fire de-
partment, he also worked for Sears, 
and he retired from Sears after 30 
years. 
He will be remembered for his kind-
ness, his vibrant smile, and for the love 
of his grandchildren. 
I got a chance to see my Uncle Jerry 
back in August of 2019. And before that, 
it was back in 1999, at my mom—his 
sister—my mom, Sally’s, funeral. 
It is a sorrow loss for our family and 
everyone who had the pleasure of 
knowing him. My wife, Shannon, our 
kids and I send our thoughts and pray-
ers to my Aunt Jeannene; my cousins 
Craig, Kevin, Jonathan; his grand-
children Kaleb, Kayla, Rose, and Ster-
ling; and his sister, my Aunt Joyce. 
Uncle Jerry, may you rest in peace.

the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to declare unwavering 
and steadfast support for the State of 
Israel. 
Hamas and Islamic Jihad are single- 
handedly responsible for the escalation 
that has led to the bloodshed of Israelis 
and Palestinians. 
These terrorist organizations do not 
care about people or peace. They seek 
only to destroy the Jewish state. Israel 
has every right to defend herself. No 
nation should be subject to a barrage of 
rocket fire, like what we see on this 
easel on a civilian population. 
Without the Iron Dome air defense 
system, the loss of life would be worse 
than the nightmare before us today. 
Congress must ensure the lifesaving 
missile defense systems continue to get 
the support and funding needed to keep 
civilians safe. 
Israel has taken serious steps to de-
escalate the conflict while Hamas has 
only escalated its attacks. So it is es-
pecially 
irresponsible 
to 
demonize 
Israel’s conduct while ignoring her 
right to self-defense. 
America unequivocally stands by our 
key democratic ally, Israel. I pray for 
peace and security in the region, and I 
mourn the loss of all lives—Israeli and 
Palestinian. I urge the cessation of all 
intentional acts of violence and a re-
turn to working toward a viable two- 
state solution. Everyone deserves to 
live in peace from terrorism. 
f 
NATIONAL NURSES APPRECIATION 
WEEK 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
National Nurses Appreciation Week 
and 
to 
celebrate 
America’s 
hard-
working and professional caregivers, 
our nurses. 
National Nurses Week is celebrated 
annually from May 6 to May 12, during 
which time was the birthday of Flor-
ence Nightingale, the founder of mod-
ern nursing. 
Now, more than ever, nurses deserve 
our collective gratitude. Our country 
has faced unprecedented challenges in 
the wake of COVID–19, and nurses 
across the country selflessly stood 
ready to assist their communities and 
neighbors in need. They spend count-
less hours away from their families and 
loved ones while placing themselves on 
the front line of our national response 
to the pandemic. 
Nursing is a science and an art, re-
served for those among us who are the 
most giving, caring, and passionate 
about helping others. Nurses are there 
for major milestones in patient’s lives, 
from birth of a child to the challenges 
of an aging patient. Patients and fam-
ily members can count on their com-
passion, guidance, and care. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank each and every 
nurse for the hard work they do. Their 
contributions have not gone unrecog-
nized, especially during some our most 
trying times. 
f 
b 1700 
ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today as millions of Israeli citizens 
are reeling from a barrage of more than 
1,500 rockets fired throughout the 
country by the terrorist group Hamas 
in Gaza. 
In case there was any confusion, 
Hamas is a terrorist organization des-
ignated by the United States, dedicated 
to the destruction of Israel, in which 
Congress has and must condemn for 
killing innocent civilians and using 
women and children as human shields. 
No one here should make excuses for 
a terrorist organization. 
Who is the next target of their sym-
pathy? 
ISIS? Al-Qaida? Hezbollah? 
Even though we may not always 
agree about Israel’s policies, we should 
be very clear that nothing, nothing jus-
tifies a terrorist organization firing 
rockets at our ally. And between ter-
rorists and a democracy, we should al-
ways choose the democracy. 
Our commitment to Israel’s security 
and its right to defend itself from ter-
rorists is ironclad. I am glad President 
Biden, the Secretary of State, and the 
Secretary of Defense have stood with 
our key democratic ally, insisted that 
Hamas stop firing rockets, and engaged 
regional partners to end this crisis. 
No matter our disagreements, there 
should be no false equivalences or ex-
cuses made by anyone on behalf of a 
foreign terrorist organization. 
As we stand together with our his-
toric ally, Israel, we continue to call 
for an end to the violence and for calm 
in the region for the sake of our chil-
dren and families and for the sake of 
peace. 
f 
SOS NICARAGUA 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to call attention on the crisis in 
Nicaragua in Central America. 
SOS Nicaragua is our motto. SOS 
Nicaragua is the rallying cry of mil-
lions of Nicaraguans yearning for free-
dom, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness, just like what we have. 
Managua is closer to Miami than 
Miami is to D.C., as Ronald Reagan 
once said on national television. What 
happens in Central America has a di-
rect impact on my community in south 
Florida, home of hundreds of thousands 
of Nicaraguans. 
Since April of 2018, Daniel Ortega’s 
Sandinista regime has carried out a re-
pressive crackdown and killed over 325 
peaceful protesters, while thousands of 
Nicaraguans have fled to neighboring 
Costa Rica and to the United States, 
escaping Ortega’s reign of terror. 
This November, Nicaragua is sched-
uled to have Presidential elections, yet 
Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario 
Murillo, are actively undermining the 
electoral process and persecuting oppo-
sition candidates to outright steal the 
upcoming Presidential election. 
The Nicaraguan people have liber-
ated themselves from the shackles of 
socialist tyranny once before, and they 
can do it again. 
For that reason, the United States 
must stand with the people of Nica-
ragua in their struggle for freedom by 
demanding a free and fair election this 
November. For that reason, Congress-
man ALBIO SIRES and myself have in-
troduced my bipartisan RENACER Act, 
and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor 
this bill and stand with the people of 
Nicaragua.

ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT 
(Mrs. LURIA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, through-
out history, the Jew has never been 
safe. People have demonized, ostra-
cized, and murdered Jews for mil-
lennia. From the ashes of the Holo-
caust, the massacre of 6 million of our 
brethren, Jews return to their ances-
tral home to build an oasis in the 
desert and a democracy of their own. 
Jews persisted, even in the face of ul-
timate evil. And, today, in their right-
ful homeland, they are attacked from 
within. Some call them villains for de-
fending their home and their families; 
for not turning a cheek and a blind eye 
to terror, bombings, and missiles rain-
ing down. 
Who would turn a cheek when their 
mere right to exist is questioned? Or 
turn a blind eye when history has been 
so unkind? 
Not you and not the Israelis. 
And we as Americans, and me as an 
American and a Jew, must stand for 
what is right. We must declare that 
Israel has a right to exist; that Israel 
has the inherent right to defend itself; 
that we have a duty, as Americans, to 
stand by the side of Israel in the face of 
attacks from terrorists and suicide 
bombers and malign regimes, who, 
again, have the same goal in mind, to 
kill Jews. 
Now is the time to stand with Israel.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to thank my colleague from Flor-
ida, Mrs. CAMMACK, aka Cat, for orga-
nizing tonight’s Special Order hour to 
recognize our National Police Week.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2298 
May 13, 2021 
This morning, I had the privilege of 
joining Leader MCCARTHY and several 
of our colleagues at the National Law 
Enforcement Memorial to show our re-
spect for the fallen and our support for 
the men and women in uniform. 
Last year was one of the deadliest 
years on record for law enforcement of-
ficers. So now, more than ever, we need 
to back the blue and show our contin-
uous support for law enforcement. 
When I was a child, I can remember 
my grandfather telling me: If you ever 
get in need or get scared, go to a police 
officer. 
Law enforcement has not changed. I 
still encourage my children and my 
grandchildren to do the same. I think 
we have changed the way we view law 
enforcement. 
To all law enforcement officers in 
this country: Please know that I sup-
port you. You are making a difference 
in our community. You are helping the 
American people, and we are forever 
grateful. 
On this National Police Week, I en-
courage all Americans to honor the 
sacrifices that are made by men and 
women in uniform, and thank every po-
lice officer for the job they are doing. 
f 
ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, to-
night, because of Hamas terror rockets, 
millions of people in Israel, Gaza, and 
the West Bank, including frail seniors 
and young children, are huddled in 
fear, worried about their loved ones, 
and uncertain about what tomorrow 
will bring. 
Hamas and other terrorist groups are 
relentlessly attacking Israel, launch-
ing more than 1,500 rockets just since 
Monday, 
targeting 
Jerusalem, 
Tel 
Aviv, Be’er Sheva, and every commu-
nity in between. 
Israel is rightfully responding to 
these attacks, protecting its citizens 
and defending its borders. Civilians are 
dying, Arabs and Jews. My heart 
breaks for all innocents killed and in-
jured. It is true that more have died in 
Gaza, but Israel goes out of its way to 
minimize civilian casualties. Hamas, 
conversely, goes out of its way to tar-
get civilians in Israel, while launching 
its rockets from civilian areas in Gaza. 
Israel has overwhelming resources to 
defend herself, yet shows restraint. 
Hamas has rockets intended only for 
death and terror. Thankfully, with Iron 
Dome, Israel has the technology to pro-
tect the lives of its citizens, which, in 
turn, protects Palestinian lives as well. 
The U.S. stands with Israel, and we 
must do all we can to end Hamas’ ter-
ror attacks and swiftly restore calm to 
the region. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, the men 
and women of law enforcement live by 
a creed that sets them apart from all 
other professions. Unfortunately, that 
creed, to serve and to protect, often 
places them in harm’s way. 
While Scripture does not speak di-
rectly about law enforcement, we see 
that Christ said, ‘‘blessed are the 
peacemakers, for they shall be called 
children of God.’’ 
The peacemakers we honor today are 
not only law enforcement officers, but 
they are mothers, fathers, sons, and 
daughters. They are leaders who face 
danger on a daily basis to help trans-
form their communities to be better 
places to live and to worship and to 
raise a family. 
Their service, their love of fellow of-
ficers, their love of community, and 
the sacrifice of law enforcement must 
not be forgotten. That is why I am 
proud to join Congresswoman JULIA 
LETLOW from Louisiana to introduce 
the resolution expressing support for 
recognizing National Police Week. Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful that over 90 of 
our House colleagues have joined this 
effort. 
The men and women of law enforce-
ment will always be remembered as he-
roes. 
f 
ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT 
(Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, Hamas 
has fired 1,600 rockets into Israel. Each 
rocket is a war crime, for each was 
fired solely for the purpose of killing as 
many civilians as possible. 
President 
Biden 
has 
declared, 
unwaveringly, our support for Israel’s 
right to defend itself. We grieve every 
civilian death, Israeli and Palestinian. 
We cannot accept at face value reports 
of Palestinian deaths since they come 
from Hamas, a terrorist organization, 
recognized as such by both the U.S. and 
the EU. 
Hamas has caused many Palestinian 
deaths since one-quarter of its rockets 
aimed at Israel actually explode in 
Gaza, and because Hamas locates its 
military operations in civilian neigh-
borhoods, using human shields. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend 
Israel for its efforts to avoid civilian 
casualties while striking successfully 
at terrorists. I want to commend this 
Congress for funding Iron Dome, which 
has 
successfully 
avoided 
so 
many 
Israeli civilian deaths. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Ms. LETLOW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today during National Police Week to 
honor the 394 law enforcement officers 
whose names have been forever en-
graved into the National Law Enforce-
ment Officers Memorial here in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
I am honored to join Congressman 
MICHAEL GUEST and 90 of my Repub-
lican colleagues in introducing a reso-
lution to recognize these brave men 
and women who made the ultimate sac-
rifice. The surviving families of these 
officers are now left to walk through 
the unimaginable path of pain and loss. 
My prayers are with them every day as 
they grieve for their loved ones. 
My district and State, like so many 
of my colleagues, did not escape loss. 
Fifteen law enforcement officers from 
Louisiana were killed in the line of 
duty in 2020, including four from the 
Fifth Congressional District: 
Kejuana Artez Bates with the Vidalia 
Police Department; 
Kietrell 
Michael 
Pitts 
with 
the 
Tangipahoa Sheriff’s Office; 
Randy Michael Vallot with the Rich-
land Parish Sheriff’s Office; and 
Marshal Lee Walter, Jr., with the 
Mangham Police Department. 
These officers swore an oath to up-
hold the public trust. We remember 
them not just today or this week, but 
for years to come. We thank all law en-
forcement officers and their families 
for their sacrifice, and ask God to bless 
each and every one of you. 
The people of our country are forever 
grateful.

AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL 
(Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, moral 
clarity—that is what this moment calls 
for. Terrorists launch rockets at civil-
ians and launch rockets from schools 
and hospitals, putting kids at risk. 
They use humans as shields. 
Hamas is a terrorist organization 
sworn to wiping out the only Jewish 
state on Earth, and the House of Rep-
resentatives 
previously 
declared 
it 
shall be the policy of the United States 
to officially and publicly condemn 
Hamas for violating the international 
law of armed conflict by exploiting ci-
vilians. 
Democracies, on the other hand, act 
to limit civilian casualties and do ev-
erything they can to defend their own 
citizens. Israel is a democracy. It is the 
only Jewish state in the world, and our 
friend and ally in Israel has a right to 
defend her citizens. 
At this moment as more than 1,750 
rockets rain down on Israel, we must 
stand with our ally and stand against 
Hamas terrorism. 
Please 
don’t 
be 
fooled 
by 
false 
choices: Israel or Hamas. 
But if I am asked to choose between 
a terrorist organization and our demo-
cratic ally, I will stand with Israel

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. GARBARINO asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, this 
week is National Police Week, a time 
to express our enduring gratitude for 
the incredible bravery and sacrifice of 
American 
law 
enforcement 
officers 
across the country. I stand here today 
to honor our men and women in law en-
forcement in the well of the U.S. House 
of Representatives because we must 
never forget all they do to keep Ameri-
cans safe. 
Recently, an NYPD officer from West 
Islip in my district showed us all what 
it means to protect and serve. When 
gunfire rang out in the middle of Times 
Square, Officer Alyssa Vogel, a neigh-
borhood coordination officer, imme-
diately rushed to the aid of an injured 
4-year-old girl. Officer Vogel quickly 
applied an emergency tourniquet to the 
young girl’s leg, gathered her in her 
arms, and ran her to safety where the 
girl’s injuries were treated in a nearby 
ambulance. 
Officer Vogel is a 41⁄2-year veteran of 
the NYPD. She is a wife, a mother, 
and, as is evident by her bravery and 
quick thinking, she is a hero that Long 
Islanders can be proud to call their 
own. 
This is just one example of the ex-
traordinary acts that police officers in 
my district and across the country do 
every single day in the line of duty. 
May God bless and watch over them 
as they serve. 
f 
AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
solidarity with our staunch ally, Israel. 
For days, Israel has been under attack 
by Hamas terrorists who have fired 
more than 1,700 rockets from Gaza, tar-
geting civilians and targeting Tel Aviv 
and Jerusalem. Were it not for the Iron 
Dome missile defense system, the loss 
of life would be enormous. 
Thousands 
of 
Israelis—Jews 
and 
Arabs alike—have taken cover in bomb 
shelters. I have been in Israel when 
rockets were fired from Gaza into 
Sderot. I know the terror of running 
for cover with sirens blaring overhead, 
not knowing whether I would make it 
in time. My heart goes out to the 
Israeli people. 
Yesterday, I attended an IDF brief-
ing. Unlike Hamas, the Israeli defense 
forces target the terrorists, their rock-
et launchers, weapons stocks, and com-
mand centers—not civilians. When a 
democratic country is attacked by ter-
rorists, it has the right and indeed the 
duty to protect its people. 
We must continue to stand with 
Israel. I pray for peace and all those 
who have lost loved ones. 
f 
AMERICA’S ENERGY PIPELINES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the importance of 
pipelines to our Nation’s energy use 
and national security. It should be ob-
vious, but with Colonial Pipeline being 
out of commission this week and the 
resulting gas shortages, price spikes, 
and long lines at the gas pump, this 
highlights 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
method of transit. Pipelines offer guar-
anteed, reliable delivery and are cheap-
er and safer than any other delivery 
method. 
The extremely rare event of a pipe-
line being out of commission shows 
how much we often take them for 
granted. We have 21⁄2 million miles of 
energy-related pipeline in this country. 
If it can be completed, the Keystone 
Pipeline, the fourth phase, only 1,179 
miles, would make our energy security 
even stronger. I am hopeful that the 
events of the past week will cause the 
Biden administration and many of my 
friends across the aisle to rethink their 
hostility toward this project. 
Let’s work on protecting these sys-
tems from cyberattacks. Let’s work to 
build redundancy systems to operate 
when these attacks get through. But 
let’s also remember what the alter-
native is when dogmatic policies get in 
the way and take options off the table. 
We will continue to need these fuels for 
the foreseeable future, and I hope we 
can agree to smart courses of action to 
embrace the most efficient and safe 
manner of delivery.

HONORING U.S. CAPITOL POLICE 
AND MPD OFFICERS DURING NA-
TIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today during National Police Week 
to honor the service of the law enforce-
ment officers who protected Members 
of Congress, Capitol employees, and 
staff on January 6. 
On that day the U.S. Capitol Police 
and the Washington Metropolitan Po-
lice repelled an attack on our democ-
racy. Bear spray, American flagpoles, 
fire extinguishers, and their own riot 
shields and Tasers were used against 
them. More than 100 police officers 
were 
injured 
that 
day—their 
eyes 
gouged, their ribs cracked, and their 
spinal disks were shattered; and count-
less more are grappling with terrible 
trauma. 
In the wake of the attack, these men 
and women have faced increased pres-
sure, scrutiny, and threats. But, Mr. 
Speaker, if you walk out of this Cham-
ber, 
you 
will 
see 
them 
standing 
strong—staying committed to their 
duty, their country, and their fellow 
Americans. 
On behalf of the people of central 
Virginia, and on behalf of a grateful 
Nation, I thank the Capitol Police and 
the Washington Metropolitan Police 
for their heroism and their bravery. I 
honor the lives and the legacies of 
those we have lost: Officer Brian 
Sicknick, Officer Howard Liebengood, 
Officer Billy Evans, and Officer Jeffrey 
Smith. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, Na-
tional Police Week presents a unique 
opportunity to honor police officers na-
tionwide. In my district, we have great 
respect for law enforcement, and we 
honor those who gave their lives in the 
line of duty. 
Today, I wanted to draw attention to 
the Law Enforcement Officer Memorial 
Service being observed this weekend in 
my hometown in Henderson County. 
Ten North Carolina officers made the 
ultimate sacrifice this year in defense 
of their communities and loved ones. 
Their memory will never be forgotten. 
In my district, Deputy Sheriff Ryan 
Hendrix lost his life in a gunfight this 
year bravely protecting his community 
from harm. His family are personal 
friends of mine, and my heart goes out 
to them as we remember his bold sac-
rifice. 
Mr. Speaker, I now call for a moment 
of silence to honor the 10 North Caro-
lina officers who have lost their lives 
this year in the line of duty.

CONGRATULATING MARIA ESTHER 
ESTRADA CAMPOS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was

Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my friend, Maria 
Esther Estrada Campos, on receiving 
an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters 
from the University of Houston. 
Esther has been a trailblazer in pub-
lic education and is a public servant 
and a champion for civil rights. After 
Jefferson Davis—now Northside—High 
School, she went to the University of 
Houston. While raising four children of 
her own, Esther completed her degree 
and became one of the first bilingual 
instructors hired by the Houston Inde-
pendent School District, and later was 
a counselor and an assistant prin-
cipal—something that was almost un-
heard of back in the fifties. All of this 
was nearly unheard of, but she contin-
ued on. 
She retired early from HISD to win a 
seat on its board of trustees. In Hous-

HONORING LINDA LELIA SUSAN 
MORONEY 
(Mrs. FLETCHER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Linda Lelia 
Susan Moroney, known to all of us as 
Muffie, who died recently in her home 
at the age of 77. 
Muffie was born here in Washington, 
D.C. during World War II, but she was 
raised in and around Houston, and she 
was a Texan through and through. A 
lawyer by training and an advocate at 
heart, she fought to make our commu-
nity, our country, and our world, a bet-
ter place. 
A mother, a lay leader, and a cham-
pion, Muffie worked for equality for 
all, dignity for all, and justice for all, 
especially for women; and she did so 
while treating everyone she met with 
respect, 
including 
those 
who 
saw 
things differently. 
Her spirit will live on in her sons, 
Justin and Robert, in her grand-
children, and in the work she did, the 
groups she organized, the causes she 
championed, and the things that she 
did for all of us in Texas and for all 
Americans. 
f 
AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in light of the recent rocket attacks 
launched by Hamas against our close 
friend and ally, Israel. Those of us who 
have visited Israel many times know 
that Israelis like to say that they live 
in a tough neighborhood. It is a vola-
tile region with hostile neighbors. 
Israeli citizens and children live 
under the shadow of an everlasting 
threat of rocket attacks, suicide bomb-
ings, and looming violence. Israel is 
really the only true democracy in the 
region, and they have a right to defend 
themselves from attacks, and they 
must. These attacks over the last 
weeks are just the most recent exam-
ples. They mark the worst escalation 
of the conflict since 2014 resulting in 
the deaths of over 70 people. 
As Hamas’ incessant rocket barrages 
continue, more civilian lives are put at 
risk, including innocent Palestinians. 
They also further endanger any possi-
bility of peace. That is their goal. 
As a key ally in the region and a 
longtime friend of the United States, 
we must support Israel’s right to de-
fend itself and deescalate the violence 
and use our influence to do whatever 
we can to support our friend. 
f 
AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL 
(Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, a 63-year-old grandmother, 
Leah, was sitting in her house near Tel 
Aviv. Ido, a 5-year-old boy, was home 
with his big sister and his mom in a 
small Israeli city near Gaza. Nadine, an 
Arab-Israeli 10th grader, was driving 
with her mom and dad outside Jeru-
salem. 
What did they have in common? 
Their families are shattered and 
heartbroken. Leah, Ido, and Nadine 
were all murdered by Hamas rockets 
bombarding Israeli cities. In the last 
few 
days, 
Hamas 
terrorists 
have 
launched over 1,500 rockets—blowing 
up homes, schools, and buses. 
Thankfully, Iron Dome has stopped 
most. Still, millions of Israelis are 
forced to sleep and eat in bomb shelters 
as red alert sirens blare across the 
country. 
The violence is a cynical Hamas 
power grab using policy disputes as an 
excuse for terrorism. 
Let me make it clear: I agree with 
President Joe Biden: Israel has a right 
to defend itself when you have thou-
sands of rockets flying in your terri-
tory. 
Hamas must end its attack, and the 
United States and allies must help 
bring calm.

RECOGNIZING THE YEADON 
POLICE DEPARTMENT 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Yeadon Police 
Department, which recently started 
the first police-community garden in 
the country as part of an ongoing pro-
gram to develop positive relationships 
between police and community mem-
bers. 
The garden gives officers and resi-
dents an opportunity to meet in a co-
operative environment, to open lines of 
communication 
and 
foster 
under-
standing. 
Officers and residents work together 
in the garden throughout the growing 
season, and the food grown there is 
shared with those who work the soil, as 
well as area food banks. They hope to 
start 
six 
or 
seven 
more 
gardens 
through the community. 
The 
mayor 
of 
Yeadon, 
Rohan 
Hepkins, says that his community has 
seen a decrease in crime during the 
pandemic. He credits police outreach 
efforts, including the department’s re-
liance on community-oriented policing 
and outreach to the school district and 
younger folks so that they look at the 
police not as enemies but as allies. 
I commend Police Chief Anthony 
‘‘Chachi’’ Paparo and Mayor Hepkins 
for their efforts to improve community 
policing and to ensure that everyone in 
the community feels safe. 
f 
SUPPORTING ITA AND ITC 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, as the 
co-chairman of the Congressional Steel 
Caucus, I was honored last week to 
help facilitate a letter to the Appro-
priations Committee. This letter ex-
pressed our support for the Inter-
national Trade Administration and the 
International 
Trade 
Commission, 
which are incredibly important to the 
success of the American steel industry 
and its workforce. 
The letter encouraged the committee 
to build on its previous efforts to pro-
vide adequate resources to the ITA and 
the ITC, so they may ensure timely 
and objective responses to trade rem-
edy complaints and investigations. 
Their work is essential to upholding 
our trade laws and ensuring that all 
American workers can compete on a 
level playing field. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with the members of the committee 
and the Steel Caucus to support these 
agencies and the strength of American 
steelworkers and manufacturers.

POLICE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s 
an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and submit 
extraneous materials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate and honor the police 
officers across our country. 
As we commemorate National Police 
Week, I can’t help but think about the 
barrage of attacks that our LEOs have 
come under in recent months and 
years. 
Police officers have constantly been 
vilified by the media and those in left-
wing politics for just simply doing 
their jobs. It is a job that comes with 
significant challenges and dangers and 
is often thankless, at best.

May 13, 2021 
At this time, I would like to thank 
my colleagues here today for joining 
me for this Special Order to honor our 
heroes in blue. 
I would like to take the opportunity 
to thank our police officers all across 
this Nation for their work and sense of 
duty. They walk the beat and meet 
people at their worst moments, all 
while maintaining professionalism and 
a steadfastness to the rule of law. 
This is a job that affects not only the 
individual officer but their entire fam-
ily. Husbands, wives, sons, and daugh-
ters worry if their loved ones will re-
turn home from a shift. This fear is 
very real and very raw. 
As the wife of a first responder, I, 
too, have felt this fear and dread as my 
husband, Matt, drives to a SWAT call- 
out. 
Too often, these brave men and 
women in uniform don’t make it back 
after that shift. They pay the ultimate 
price for their bravery, and their fami-
lies are left to pick up the pieces. 
Just this year alone, we have lost too 
many brave officers in the line of duty. 
I will honor them here today by saying 
each of their names. Their memories 
and bravery will be recorded in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and etched into 
the archives of American history.

I would also be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion our K9 officers that also gave their 
lives in the line of duty: K9 Figo, K9 
Riley, K9 Luna, K9 Joker, K9 Kozmo, 
and K9 Jango. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in a mo-
ment of silence to remember these he-
roes. 
As you can see, that is a pretty 
lengthy list. I hope that, even though I 
may have mispronounced some of their 
names, their families seek comfort in 
knowing that their names will forever 
be remembered. 
Again, these are just some of the he-
roes that we have lost this year. It is 
May, and this list takes up four pages 
of paper. May we always remember 
their names and recognize their service 
in keeping law and order for our com-
munities. 
To the brave men and women who we 
just named: Rest easy. We’ve got the 
watch. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD), a good 
friend and sheriff of the great city of 
Jacksonville. 
b 1745 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
deeply appreciate Mrs. CAMMACK hav-
ing read all of those names. That is a 
promise that we make to these officers. 
I really congratulate Congresswoman 
CAMMACK and thank her so much for 
this opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, this morning, as I was 
laying a wreath at the National Law 
Enforcement 
Officers 
Memorial, 
I 
couldn’t help but remember that this 
week, National Police Week, is really 
about promises made and promises 
kept. 
These 
22,000-plus 
officers, 
whose 
names appear at the national memo-
rial, although they all died in different 
ways, they all lived for the same pur-
pose. 
They made this promise: ‘‘As a law 
enforcement officer, my fundamental 
duty is to serve mankind; to safeguard 
lives and property; to protect the inno-
cent 
against 
deception, 
the 
weak 
against oppression or intimidation, and 
the peaceful against violence or dis-
order; and to respect the constitutional 
rights of all men to liberty, equality, 
and justice.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, that is the first para-
graph of the Law Enforcement Officer’s 
Code of Ethics. That is a promise made 
by every law enforcement officer in the 
United States. That promise is kept 
every day when they put on that uni-
form and they go out to protect the 
peaceful against violence and disorder. 
Last year, in 2020, 394 of those offi-
cers gave their last full measure of de-
votion to the communities they served 
after having taken that oath. They 
kept their promise. 
During this National Police Week, we 
will keep our promise to them that we 
will never forget their names and that 
of their families. 
Mr. Speaker, every year at this time 
we pause to remember their lives; not 
just their deaths and the way they 
died, but the way they lived. 
This morning, I couldn’t help but 
think of the words of Ralph Waldo 
Emerson as I thought about these offi-
cers. He wrote: ‘‘The purpose in life is 
not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be 
honorable, to be compassionate, to 
have it make some difference that you 
have lived and lived well.’’ 
Those more than 22,000 names that 
are on those memorial walls over 
there, those men and women lived well. 
Their names will never be forgotten. Of 
the names on the wall at the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, 
113 of them are from my district. 
Just this year, we will add another 
394 names to that memorial wall. These 
officers kept their promises. Tonight, 
at the National Law Enforcement Offi-
cers Memorial, we will keep our prom-
ise and remember their names. 
God bless and keep these officers and 
their families, who are their survivors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2302 
May 13, 2021 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, former sheriff 
from Jacksonville, Mr. RUTHERFORD. 
At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. 
SCOTT FRANKLIN), a true friend to law 
enforcement, a fellow Floridian, and 
veteran. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Na-
tional Police Week when America joins 
our law enforcement community to 
honor our fallen officers. 
Sadly, our police force faces unprece-
dented attack. Last year, 394 law en-
forcement officers were killed in the 
line of duty, nearly double the amount 
from 2019. In only one year in all of 
American history, 1930, were there 
more law enforcement deaths. 
Despite these staggering losses, some 
in this body are seeking to defund the 
police, diminishing their ability to pro-
tect and defend our communities and 
themselves. 
While we must be ever vigilant to 
root out the bad apples, we cannot for-
get the overwhelming majority who 
put themselves in harm’s way every 
day and serve with honor and integrity. 
I am grateful for the efforts of the ex-
cellent law enforcement officials in my 
district. I stand with these incredible 
sheriffs and chiefs and the officers they 
lead, and I thank them for their service 
on behalf of the citizens of Florida. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
HIGGINS), my good friend, who is also a 
law enforcement officer and great pa-
triot. 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, to be a police officer, it is not 
something we do; it is someone that we 
are. I was a military police officer in 
the Army and went on to serve for 12 
years as a uniformed police officer, 12 
years as a SWAT operator, and I buried 
far too many brothers. 
There is a time in every man’s heart 
where we have to make a decision of 
what we are going to do with our life 
that day, that week, that month, with 
our families, with our career, with our 
life. 
As I reflect upon my career as a po-
lice officer prior to my congressional 
service, I think about the 81⁄2 years of 
night shift and the exchange that my 
wife and I would have every evening as 
she returned from work and I was pre-
paring to leave. She would have my lit-
tle meal prepared, a brown bag, to take 
with me. And she would say: ‘‘Be safe. 
Come home to me.’’ And I would say: 
‘‘Don’t worry about me. Worry about 
the other guy.’’ 
Every police officer has a little ex-
change like that with their loved one 
before they begin their shift, because 
we don’t know if we are coming home. 
We recognize that the life we have 
chosen to serve our fellow man is an ef-
fort somehow to become better men 
ourselves. It is an effort to serve a Lord 
that we are not quite worthy of. 
I have trained or helped train many 
officers through the years, and they 
would ask me sometimes about this 
section of the manual or that section 
of the manual, and I would always tell 
them the same: Your manual is 1,483 
pages. Seek to be a better man, do the 
right thing, and you will be worthy of 
the job and career that you have cho-
sen. Forget that, and you will not. 
We are human. We have failed and 
fallen in some way, every one of us. 
This can be said as well about the 
Members of this body. We wear a small 
pin upon our lapel that identifies us as 
Congressmen and Congresswomen. We 
are proud to serve and humbled to 
serve, and we do our best every day to 
be worthy of that service. 
This job began with an oath. Imper-
fect, though, we be; varied, though, we 
be in our ideological perspective or our 
political affiliation, we do our best 
every day. 
There are a million police officers 
across this country who don’t have a 
little lapel pin. They wear a badge like 
this. And the mourning band upon that 
badge is in memory of the brothers and 
sisters of the thin blue line who we 
have lost. 
It used to be a rare thing to find your 
mourning band and put it on your 
badge. Now, these days, you can’t get it 
off. Police officers out there know what 
I am talking about. 
So I will say, Mr. Speaker, in closing, 
that the journey that we are upon in 
this life is a chosen path that all of us 
embrace, for better or for worse. We at-
tempt to become better men and 
women, better children of God. 
Police officers are no different. I ask 
you to hear my heart, feel my spirit. 
The men and women that wear a badge 
deserve your respect, your love, and 
your support. In this special time this 
week, we memorialize forever those 
who we have lost who wear the badge. 
I thank Congresswoman CAMMACK for 
allowing me to address the House this 
day. I extend my love to the thin blue 
line. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
NEHLS), another great friend of law en-
forcement; the former sheriff of Fort 
Bend County, Texas, who knows truly 
what it is to be a man of the law. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, as a 30- 
year law enforcement veteran, I have 
seen the very best of our law enforce-
ment officers, brave men and women 
who put their lives on the line each and 
every day to protect and serve our 
communities. 
I have seen law enforcement officers 
jump into flood waters to save a pet, 
run into a fiery crash to save an uncon-
scious victim, resuscitate and save the 
life of a criminal who had just tried to 
shoot and kill them. 
I have also seen the dangers of serv-
ing in law enforcement. Hundreds of 
law enforcement officers are killed 
every year in the line of duty across 
our country. In 2021, 394 names of law 
enforcement officers killed in the line 
of duty were added to the National Law 
Enforcement Officers Memorial, right 
here in Washington, D.C., and 59 of 
those brave men and women were from 
my home State of Texas. 
How many people in this Chamber or 
watching at home can name any of the 
officers who died in the line of duty 
this year? 
I would say a very small percentage, 
if any at all. 
But how many know the name of 
George Floyd or Freddie Gray or 
Breonna Taylor? 
I would say the vast majority. 
What does that say about our media? 
What does it say about our culture? 
b 1800 
I think it is a testament to just how 
divided our country is today, a time 
where some of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle actually believe 
defunding or abolishing the police is a 
good idea. My friends, it is not rocket 
science to conclude that the society, 
our society is built on rule of law and 
it requires law enforcement. 
Rather than recognize the bravery 
and service of the over 800,000 law en-
forcement officers in this country who 
do their job honorably, the far left has 
sought to demonize and defund our law 
enforcement, based off the actions of a 
few—a few—who have failed to uphold 
their oath. 
Their hateful rhetoric has led to vio-
lence and destruction in cities across 
our country. We saw it in Seattle, Min-
neapolis, Portland. City blocks burned, 
businesses destroyed, and lives ruined 
forever. When faced with this violence 
in the streets, the far left doubled down 
on their hateful anti-law enforcement 
rhetoric and encouraged even more de-
struction. 
It may come as a surprise to many, 
but there are over 10 million—yes, 10 
million—arrests in our country every 
year. Most Americans never hear a 
word about the millions of arrests that 
happen without incident. And why is 
that? Because it doesn’t sell headlines. 
It doesn’t sell headlines, and it doesn’t 
fit the left’s narrative. 
Darian Jarrott of New Mexico, Chris 
Ward of North Carolina, James Smith 
of Iowa, and Chad Walker from the 
great State of Texas. Know their 
names? I am sure you don’t, because 
their death didn’t fit the left’s nar-
rative or sell headlines. All four of 
them were murdered in the line of duty 
for just trying to protect their commu-
nities. 
Are their years of service or sacrifice 
not worthy of remembrance or recogni-
tion? The media doesn’t seem to think 
so. But the Republican Party, we stand 
with law enforcement. We support law 
enforcement. We celebrate law enforce-
ment. We are the party of law enforce-
ment. 
That is why I am proud to stand here 
today as a 30-year law enforcement vet-
eran during National Police Week to 
say to all my brothers and sisters in 
blue, we have got your back. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Thank you to our 
sheriff from the great State of Texas. I

May 13, 2021 
appreciate your remarks and thank 
you for your service, not just to Fort 
Ben, but to the great State of Texas 
and our country. Thank you. 
At this time, I yield to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Iowa 
(Mrs. 
MILLER- 
MEEKS), my good friend who may be 
the smallest in stature in our con-
ference but has the biggest heart. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
this is National Police Week, and it is 
an excellent time to say thank you to 
the heroic men and women who put 
their lives at risk every day to keep us 
safe. 
These officers and their families have 
sacrificed so much to serve others that 
we must be doing more to keep them 
safe, well funded, and supported. 
This past year has been challenging 
for all of us, but our police officers 
have been hit especially hard. Imagine 
what we have gone through with the 
pandemic, but being a police officer 
and first responder during these dif-
ficult times. 
Many of my colleagues have called to 
reform, defund, and even abolish police 
departments. While I do believe that 
our policing system is in need of seri-
ous bipartisan and commonsense re-
forms, I will never support defunding 
or abolishing the police. Those calling 
for defunding or abolishment of the po-
lice as serious policy are flat out 
wrong. 
Our communities need police to stay 
safe. They must be fully funded, and 
they deserve our respect and gratitude. 
Defunding or abolishing the police 
would make our communities less se-
cure and more vulnerable to criminal 
activity, putting all of our families at 
risk. 
We must produce constructive ways 
to reform and improve our policing sys-
tem, not strip departments of critical 
funding for training, equipment, com-
munity 
engagement 
programs, 
and 
body cameras. 
To reform our police system, we 
should focus on real solutions, like em-
powering police chiefs to fire bad cops 
and improving police training and ac-
countability in line with best prac-
tices, similar to the reforms I proudly 
supported as a State senator in Iowa. 
Earlier today, I signed on as a co-
sponsor to the bipartisan Defund Cities 
that Defund the Police Act. Introduced 
by Representatives FITZPATRICK, GOLD-
EN, STAUBER, and LAMB, this piece of 
legislation would prevent jurisdictions 
that defund the police from receiving 
certain Federal grants, stopping spe-
cific Federal taxpayer dollars from 
bankrolling jurisdictions that inten-
tionally make their communities less 
safe. 
Under this legislation, any jurisdic-
tion that chooses to defund the police 
is choosing to defund themselves of 
Federal 
assistance. 
Municipalities 
around the country that wish to defund 
or abolish the police will only harm 
their communities. 
America does not need to defund or 
abolish the police. We need to fund and 
support law enforcement. 
It is interesting to me and ironic 
that here I am in this building as a 
U.S. Congresswoman, and my first tour 
of this building and the White House 
was my brother, who was a Secret 
Service agent in this city. 
We especially need to honor our fall-
en police officers, including Iowa State 
Patrol Officer Jim Smith, U.S. Capitol 
Police 
Officers 
Sicknick, 
Evans, 
Liebengood, Green, and Smith. We also 
need to honor the selfless sacrifice of 
Officer Goodman. 
Police officers are true public serv-
ants and protectors of our communities 
who deserve our respect and apprecia-
tion. I am proud to back the blue this 
week and every week. 
Thank 
you, 
Congresswoman 
CAMMACK, for your fierce advocacy for 
our police officers and for organizing 
tonight’s Special Order. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, during 
this National Police Week, we have 
highlighted many officers who have 
met the call of duty with courage and 
unmatched service. Two such officers I 
would like to highlight today are from 
my district in the great little tiny 
town of High Springs, Sergeant Gary 
Moore and Officer Mayuly Nodarse. 
On April 28, these two officers of the 
High Springs Police Department re-
sponded to a call about suspicious ac-
tivity. Upon arriving on scene, they ob-
served a suspect standing in the bath-
room of a house with a knife and a vic-
tim yelling for help. 
After these two officers gave mul-
tiple commands, they forced entry into 
the bathroom and found the armed sus-
pect who was uncooperative. Based on 
their training and experience, they 
were able to disarm the suspect. Every-
one on scene lived to see another day, 
thanks to the work and quick thinking 
of these officers. 
For 
their 
bravery 
and 
profes-
sionalism, they have been awarded the 
Medal of Valor. I thank these two offi-
cers for their quick thinking and deci-
sive action. They show us what proper 
training and a well-funded police force 
can do to keep our communities safe. 
As I stand here today, I know my 
husband is watching, on shift, from the 
station. So, a quick hello to my hus-
band Matt, and thank you. I also would 
like to thank my colleagues for joining 
me here today and a big thank you to 
every officer who gets up every day, 
puts on their vest, puts on their badge, 
walks out that door not knowing if 
they will make it home at the end of 
their shift. To the families, thank you 
for your service alongside our men and 
women in uniform. 
As we have listed the names here 
today of those that we have lost this 
year, rest easy, know that we have to 
watch. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
f 
THE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS 
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, today’s 
Special Order hour is not just about 
the violence that has occurred in the 
last week in Israel and Palestine. It is 
not about the activities of the last 
month, including the displacement of 
Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, 
that have been largely overlooked in 
this region. But, in many ways, it is 
about what has happened over the last 
year, the last decade, the last several 
decades that has dehumanized and vio-
lated the human rights of too many 
people in this important region. 
No one should have to face the re-
ality of missiles shot at them. Hamas 
is causing great danger to the very peo-
ple it purports to want to protect in 
Gaza by doing so, and those missile at-
tacks should be condemned. 
But that doesn’t make it a ‘‘both 
sides’’ issue. We must acknowledge and 
condemn 
the 
disproportionate 
dis-
crimination and treatment that Pal-
estinians face versus others in this re-
gion. 
No one should suffer the loss of life, 
liberty, or dignity that the Palestinian 
people 
have 
suffered 
under 
the 
Netanyahu and previous administra-
tions in Israel during the 50-year occu-
pation of the West Bank. 
When serious human rights abuses 
compound, such as the recent attacks 
on places of worship, like the Al-Aqsa 
Mosque, the forced removal of people 
from their homes, most recently in 
East Jerusalem, but ongoing in the 
West Bank for way too long, the jailing 
and military court trials for Pales-
tinian children, the dehumanization of 
the lives of the Palestinians by having 
roads and entrances that are separate 
for some people—which all too often 
looks like a former South Africa, the 
blockade and open-air prison condi-
tions for the people in Gaza, where food 
and clean water is often scarce. 
When those types of human rights 
abuses occur, we are not just putting 
the lives of Palestinians and Israelis at 
risk, but we are also putting the 
United States at greater jeopardy, and 
eventually, that could mean the lives 
of men and women from the United 
States getting involved in a greater es-
calation of violence in the region, 
which none of us want to see. 
Today, we want to talk about the 
very long-term problems that have 
been, for too long, ignored by U.S. poli-
cies in the region. Fortunately, now

are wanting to address peace in this re-
gion in a more forthright way. 
As human rights giant South African 
Desmond Tutu said, ‘‘If you are neutral 
in situations of injustice, you have 
chosen the side of the oppressor.’’ 
We must treat everyone in Israel and 
Palestine with equal respect and dig-
nity. That is the U.S. policy that we 
are speaking out for. 
I am pleased to be joined by a num-
ber of my colleagues tonight who have 
taken leadership positions in talking 
about peace in the Middle East for all 
people. 
I now yield to my colleague from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), the first Pales-
tinian American to serve in Congress. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I believe I 
am actually the second, but I am the 
only Palestinian-American Member of 
Congress now, and my mere existence 
has disrupted the status quo. This is so 
personal for me. I am a reminder to 
colleagues that Palestinians do, indeed, 
exist, that we are human, that we are 
allowed to dream. We are mothers, 
daughters, granddaughters, we are jus-
tice seekers and are unapologetic about 
our fight against oppressions of all 
forms. 
Colleagues, Palestinians aren’t going 
anywhere, no matter how much money 
you send to Israel’s apartheid govern-
ment. 
If we are to make good on our prom-
ises to support equal human rights for 
all, it is our duty to end the apartheid 
system that, for decades, has subjected 
Palestinians to inhumane treatment 
and racism. 
Reducing Palestinians to live in 
utter fear and terror of losing a child, 
being indefinitely detained or killed 
because of who they are, and the un-
equal rights and protections they have, 
under Israeli law, it must end. 
One 
of 
Israel’s 
most 
prominent 
human rights organizations, B’Tselem, 
has declared Israel an apartheid state. 
Human Rights Watch recently recog-
nized it, too. This is what Palestinians 
living under Israel’s oppression have 
been telling us for decades. 
b 1815 
I have been told by some of my col-
leagues who dispute the truth about 
segregation, racism, and violence in 
Israel toward Palestinians that I need 
to know the history. 
What they mean, unintentionally or 
not, is that Palestinians do not have 
the right to tell the truth about what 
happened to them during the founding 
of Israel. They, in effect, erase the 
truth about the ethnic cleansing of 
Palestinians in Israel that some refer 
to as the Nakba, or catastrophe. 
As Palestinians talk about our his-
tory, know that many of my Black 
neighbors and indigenous communities 
may not know what we mean by 
Nakba, but they do understand what it 
means to be killed, expelled from your 
homeland, made homeless, and stripped 
of your human rights. 
My ancestors and current family in 
Palestine deserve the world to hear 
their 
history 
without 
obstruction. 
They have a right to be able to explain 
to the world that they are still suf-
fering, still being dispossessed, still 
being killed as the world watches and 
does nothing. 
As Peter Beinart, an American of 
Jewish faith, writes: ‘‘When you tell a 
people to forget its past, you are not 
proposing peace. You are proposing ex-
tinction.’’ 
The Palestinian story is that of being 
made a refugee on the lands you called 
home. 
We cannot have an honest conversa-
tion about U.S. military support for 
the Israeli Government today without 
acknowledging that, for Palestinians, 
the catastrophe of displacement and 
dehumanization in their homeland has 
been ongoing since 1948. 
To read the statements from Presi-
dent Biden, Secretary Blinken, General 
Austin, and leaders of both parties, you 
would hardly know Palestinians ex-
isted at all. 
There has been no recognition of the 
attack on Palestinian families being 
ripped from their homes in East Jeru-
salem right now or home demolitions; 
no mention of children being detained 
or murdered; no recognition of a sus-
tained campaign of harassment and 
terror by Israeli police against wor-
shipers kneeling down and praying and 
celebrating their holiest days in one of 
their holiest places; no mention of Al- 
Aqsa being surrounded by violence, 
tear gas, and smoke while people pray. 
Can my colleagues imagine if it was 
their place of worship filled with tear 
gas? Could you pray as stun grenades 
were tossed into your holiest place? 
Above all, there has been absolutely 
no recognition of Palestinian human-
ity. If our own State Department can’t 
even bring itself to acknowledge that 
the killing of Palestinian children is 
wrong, well, I will say it for the mil-
lions of Americans who stand with me 
against the killing of innocent children 
no matter their ethnicity or faith. 
I weep for all the lives lost under the 
unbearable status quo, every single 
one, no matter their faith or their 
background. We all deserve freedom, 
liberty, peace, and justice, and it 
should never be denied because of our 
faith or ethnic background. 
No child, Palestinian or Israeli or 
whoever they are, should ever have to 
worry that death will rain from the 
sky. 
How many of my colleagues are will-
ing to say the same, to stand for Pales-
tinian human rights as they do for 
Israelis? 
There is a crushing dehumanization 
to how we talk about this terrible vio-
lence. 
The New York Post reported the Pal-
estinian death toll as Israeli casualties. 
ABC says that Israelis are ‘‘killed’’ 
while Palestinians simply ‘‘die,’’ as if 
by magic, as if they were never human 
to begin with. 
Help me understand the math. How 
many Palestinians have to die for their 
lives to matter? 
Life under apartheid strips Palestin-
ians of their human dignity. 
How would you feel if you had to go 
through dehumanizing checkpoints two 
blocks from your own home to go to 
the doctor or travel across your own 
land? How would you feel if you had to 
do it while pregnant, in the scorching 
heat, as soldiers with guns controlled 
your freedom? 
How would you feel if you lived in 
Gaza, where your power and water 
might be out for days or weeks at a 
time, where you were cut off from the 
outside world by an inhumane military 
blockade? 
Meanwhile, Palestinians’ rights to 
nonviolent resistance have been cur-
tailed and even criminalized. 
Our party leaders have spoken force-
fully against BDS, calling its pro-
ponents anti-Semitic, despite the same 
tactics being critical to ending South 
African apartheid mere decades ago. 
What we are telling Palestinians 
fighting apartheid is the same thing 
being told to my Black neighbors and 
Americans throughout America who 
are fighting against police brutality 
here: There is no form of acceptable re-
sistance to state violence. 
As long as the message from Wash-
ington is that our military’s support 
for 
Israel 
is 
unconditional, 
Netanyahu’s extremist, rightwing gov-
ernment will continue to expand settle-
ments, continue to demolish homes, 
and continue to make the prospects for 
peace impossible. 
Mr. Speaker, 330 of my own col-
leagues, Democrats and Republicans, 75 
percent of the body here, signed a let-
ter pledging that Israel shall never be 
made to comply with basic human 
rights laws that other countries that 
receive our military aid must observe. 
When I see the images and videos of 
destruction and death in Palestine, all 
I hear are the children screaming from 
pure fear and terror. 
I want to read something a mother 
named Eman in Gaza wrote 2 days ago. 
She said: ‘‘Tonight, I put the kids to 
sleep in our bedroom. So that when we 
die, we die together and no one would 
live to mourn the loss of one another.’’ 
That statement broke me a little 
more because my country’s policies 
and funding will deny this mother’s 
right to see her children live without 
fear and to grow old without painful 
trauma and violence. 
We must condition aid to Israel on 
compliance with international human 
rights and an end to apartheid. We 
must, with no hesitation, demand that 
our country recognize that the uncon-
ditional support of Israel has enabled 
the erasure of Palestinian life and the 
denial of the rights of millions of refu-
gees, and it emboldens the apartheid 
policies that Human Rights Watch has 
detailed so thoroughly in their recent 
report. 
I stand before you not only as a Con-
gresswoman for the beautiful 13 Dis-
trict Strong but also as a proud daugh-
ter of Palestinian immigrants and the

granddaughter of a loving Palestinian 
grandmother living in the occupied 
Palestine. 
You take that and combine it with 
the fact that I was raised in one of the 
most 
beautiful, 
Blackest 
cities 
in 
America, a city where movements for 
civil rights and social justice are 
birthed, the city of Detroit. 
So, I can’t stand here silent when in-
justice exists and where the truth is 
obscured. If there is one thing Detroit 
instilled in this Palestinian girl from 
Southwest, it is you always speak 
truth to power even if your voice 
shakes. 
The freedom of Palestinians is con-
nected to the fight against oppression 
all over the world. 
Lastly, to my Sity in Palestine, 
‘‘ ‘aqaf huna bsbbik.’’ I stand here be-
cause of you. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for her very personal 
words about the situation in Palestine. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
I extend my gratitude to MARIE NEW-
MAN for helping lead this important 
discussion, and I thank all the Mem-
bers who are here and showed up in sol-
idarity. 
Mr. Speaker, as someone who has ex-
perienced war firsthand, I have a deep 
understanding of the suffering that 
comes along with it. As a child, I lived 
through a violent civil war that de-
stroyed my home, ripped my family 
apart from each other, and killed many 
of my family and friends. 
I can still remember, at just 8 years 
old, hiding under the bed, hearing 
bombs go off outside my window, and 
wondering if we were going to be hit 
next. 
It is trauma I will live with for the 
rest of my life. 
So, I understand, on a deeply human 
level, the pain and the anguish families 
are feeling in Palestine and Israel at 
the moment, and the helplessness peo-
ple feel here in the United States who 
have family in the region, including 
many of my constituents. And it is for 
this reason that I abhor violence. 
Whether rocket attacks or airstrikes, 
violence does nothing to make people 
more secure. It only furthers the inter-
ests of the powerful while costing lives, 
futures, and families. 
But we must speak out truthfully 
and forcefully about the seeds of this 
conflict and about what is happening 
today. The truth is that this is not a 
conflict between two states. This is not 
a civil war. It is a conflict where one 
country, funded and supported by the 
United States Government, continues 
an illegal military occupation over an-
other group of people. 
This is not my description of it. This 
is 
the 
description 
of 
conservative 
Israeli leader Ariel Sharon, who, in 
2003, said: ‘‘To hold 3.5 million Pal-
estinians under occupation is, in my 
opinion, a very bad thing for us and for 
them.’’ 
‘‘It is occupation,’’ he said. ‘‘You 
might not like this word, but it is real-
ly an occupation.’’ 
To understand what is taking place 
at this moment, we must understand 
how it began. 
In 1948, 700,000 Palestinians were 
forcefully removed and uprooted from 
their homes in what has come to be 
known as the Nakba, or the catas-
trophe. Seventy-eight percent of their 
land was taken from them. Now, con-
sider that: 78 percent of their land was 
taken from them. 
Since then, 5.6 million Palestinians 
have been continually displaced from 
their homes in one of the largest and 
longest-lasting refugee crises in human 
history. 
For decades, the United States, the 
United Nations, and many Israelis and 
Palestinians have pushed for a Pales-
tinian state in which the Palestinians 
can enjoy the same rights afforded to 
their Israeli counterparts. But in the 
past several years, that hope has in-
creasingly slipped away. 
The Israeli Government and the far- 
right ethnonationalist leader Benjamin 
Netanyahu have legally razed Palestin-
ians’ ancestral homes, leveled entire 
neighborhoods, 
and 
violently 
sup-
pressed any resistance. 
This is all to make way for illegal 
Israeli settlement outposts designed to 
displace Palestinians from their homes 
and prevent a future Palestinian state. 
Since 1993, when the first Oslo peace 
accord was signed, illegal settlements 
have increased by nearly 400,000. And 
Netanyahu has made explicit his goal 
to annex much of the West Bank, home 
to over 3 million Palestinians. 
b 1830 
On top of that, Palestinian move-
ment, speech, and economic activity 
are severely limited. Palestinians are 
not allowed to leave the Gaza Strip ex-
cept in extreme cases. 
Medical 
shortages 
are 
rampant. 
Youth unemployment was already at 40 
percent before the pandemic hit. Peo-
ple who protest, including young chil-
dren, are routinely shot by the IDF sol-
diers—often 
killed—with 
no 
con-
sequences in Israeli courts. 
As a recent report by Human Rights 
Watch detailed, this can only be de-
scribed as an apartheid. 
All of which brings us to the current 
crisis. This week, the Israeli authori-
ties were planning more forced dis-
placement in Sheikh Jarrah, a Pales-
tinian neighborhood in East Jeru-
salem—home to Palestinian refugees 
who had already been displaced. 
On 
Thursday, 
settlers 
began 
harassing and attacking Palestinians 
who were breaking their Ramadan fast 
during a protest vigil in Sheikh Jarrah. 
The deputy mayor of Jerusalem 
joined to mock Palestinians, saying to 
one protestor: ‘‘Did they take the bul-
let out of your ass?’’ ‘‘It is a pity it 
didn’t go here,’’ pointing to his head. 
Then, on the last Friday of the holy 
month of Ramadan, Israeli military 
forces stormed al-Aqsa mosque, one of 
the holiest sites in Islam, firing stun 
grenades, teargas, and rubber bullets. 
Over 300 people were injured; 200 of 
them were hospitalized. 
What happened next is well known: 
Hamas fired rockets into Israel, which 
has taken the lives of six Israelis. And 
the 
Israeli 
military 
launched 
air 
strikes into Gaza, targeting civilian 
buildings, which have already killed 69 
people, including 16 children. 
Let me be clear: Every single death 
in this conflict is a tragedy. Every 
rocket and bomb that targets civilians 
is a war crime. 
I feel the pain of every child who is 
forced to hide under their beds because 
they fear for their life, and every par-
ent who deals with that anguish. And I 
wish we, as a nation, treated that pain 
equally; but right now we are not. 
And instead of condemning blatant 
crimes against humanity and human 
rights abuses, many Members of Con-
gress have instead fallen back on a 
blanketed statement defending Israel’s 
air strikes against civilians under the 
guise of self-defense, without even a 
mention of the children getting killed, 
much less what happened at al-Aqsa or 
in Sheikh Jarrah. 
When the 15-member United Nations 
Security Council proposed a resolution 
this week calling on the Israeli Govern-
ment to cease settlement activities, 
demolitions and evictions, and urging 
general restraint, the United States re-
portedly blocked it from happening. 
We are currently blocking the United 
Nations Security Council from calling 
on ceasefire. And to this day, we, as 
Members of Congress, have not had yet 
a hearing or a briefing on this conflict 
or gotten answers on whether our 
weaponry or money is being used to 
commit human rights abuses. 
So I must ask: When we defend the 
Israeli citizens’ right to peace and se-
curity, how can we at the same time 
ignore the 5 million Palestinians living 
under occupation? 
When we say that Israel has the right 
to self-defense, how can we ignore the 
home demolitions, settlement violence, 
and forced annexation of Palestinian 
land that is happening? 
And how can we say they, them-
selves, do not have the right to defend 
themselves? 
How can we pay lip service to a Pal-
estinian state, yet do absolutely noth-
ing to make that state a reality while 
the Israeli Government we fund tries to 
make it impossible? 
I will end with this: Today is Eid, the 
final day of Ramadan, one of the joy-
ous days in the Muslim calendar. And 
while I would rather be spending it 
with my family, I know there are fami-
lies who are mourning the death of 
their children because of this, and I 
owe it to them to speak out on their 
behalf. 
So I am here today to stand for our 
common humanity, to say that every 
child deserves a life free of violence 
and oppression. Every child deserves

advocates for their humanity, for their 
safety, and for their security. And it 
should not be controversial to say the 
same for Palestinian children. 
Eid Mubarak. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative OMAR for those words. 
As we speak, it was just announced a 
little while ago that the Israeli mili-
tary was going into Gaza. It is not 
clear if it is going after rocket attacks 
or Hamas leaders or what is happening. 
But that is happening at this very mo-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM), a senior, a very powerful Member 
of this Congress, the chair of the Sub-
committee on Defense of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, and a life-
long advocate for equality for Palestin-
ians and for Israelis. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Mr. POCAN, for his 
kind remarks and for being one of the 
organizers for tonight’s Special Order. 
Tonight, I am here to condemn vio-
lence. I am here to speak out in sup-
port of human rights, political rights, 
and peace. For days, Hamas and ex-
tremists in Gaza have been firing rock-
ets into Israel that have caused death, 
destruction, and fear among Israeli 
citizens. 
I condemn Hamas’ actions. These at-
tacks must stop. 
For 54 years, Israel has been enforc-
ing a brutal military occupation in the 
West Bank that has terrorized Pales-
tinian 
families. 
And 
I 
condemn 
Israeli’s 
occupation 
of 
Palestine. 
Israel’s occupation must end. 
What we are witnessing in Israel, 
East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West 
Bank are the bitter fruits of discrimi-
nation that has empowered Jewish ex-
tremists and Palestinian extremists. 
People seeking justice, equality, and 
peace, and opportunity are sidelined, 
silenced, and dismissed. 
We are witnessing the all too famil-
iar cycle of violence between Israel and 
Hamas. And, today, we are witnessing 
Israeli cities at war. Israeli citizens are 
attacking each other. Israeli citizens, 
who are Jewish and Palestinian, are 
fighting each other. Adding to this ha-
tred is Israel’s nation-state law and 
other structural policies of discrimina-
tion that treat Palestinians as second- 
class citizens. 
Now, I want to be clear. Israel has 
the right to have their security, and it 
must be able to defend itself against 
rockets. But Palestinians have univer-
sally recognized human rights, rights 
that are not recognized under Israeli 
military occupation. 
Palestinians 
have 
become 
people 
without a nation. Palestinians have no 
government to defend them when they 
seek justice when their children are 
abused or tortured by Israeli military 
security forces. Palestinian families 
cannot defend themselves when Israeli 
bulldozers destroy their homes and 
turn their land over to Jewish settlers. 
Israel is an ally of the United States, 
and Congress supports Israel by pro-
viding military aid. And I vote for that 
aid package. The Iron Dome missile de-
fense system that is stopping Hamas 
rockets is funded out of the Committee 
on 
Appropriations’ 
Defense 
Sub-
committee, which I chair. And I sup-
port funding for Iron Dome and it will 
be in the bill that I write this year. 
However, Congress sends $3.8 billion 
to Israel in the form of military aid to 
be unrestricted and unconditioned. No 
limits. Proponents of this unrestricted 
aid to Israel wrote to the Committee 
on Appropriations: ‘‘U.S. support of 
Israel makes the region safer and bol-
sters diplomatic efforts at achieving a 
negotiated two-state solution, result-
ing in peace and prosperity for both 
Israelis and Palestinians.’’ 
To those who support that state-
ment, here are the facts: There are no 
diplomatic efforts to achieve a two- 
state solution. The Prime Minister of 
Israel has repeatedly stated he is com-
mitted to annexing Palestinian lands. 
There is no peace for Palestinians in 
East Jerusalem or the West Bank. 
There is an Israeli military occupation 
that abuses and tortures Palestinian 
children, 
demolishes 
Palestinian 
homes, and steals Palestinian land. 
The unrestricted, unconditioned $3.8 
billion in annual U.S. military aid en-
ables—it gives a green light to Israel’s 
occupation of Palestine because there 
is no accountability and there is no 
oversight 
by 
Congress. 
This 
must 
change. Not one dollar of U.S. aid to 
Israel should go towards the military 
detention of Palestinian children, the 
annexation of Palestinian lands, or the 
destruction of Palestinian homes. 
I support everyone’s universal human 
rights, including Palestinian rights, to 
live in freedom; to live with equality, 
with security, with opportunity. I want 
peace for the people of Israel and the 
people of Palestine, and I am willing to 
do my part to work for justice. 
Rockets fired from Gaza must stop. 
The eviction of Palestinian families 
from East Jerusalem must stop. The 
burning of synagogues and Arab busi-
nesses must stop. And the rightwing 
extremists 
that 
chant 
‘‘Burn 
the 
Arabs,’’ well, that must stop, too. 
There is enough hate and there is 
enough blame to go around. And this 
conflict will not end until there is re-
sponsible leadership on both sides. 
Peace will not take root until the 
United States stands up for human 
rights and security for all people, and 
that includes human rights and secu-
rity for the Palestinian people. 
The Biden administration must work 
for peace and direct some tough love to 
the Israeli Government and to the Pal-
estinian Authority. End the violence. 
End the discrimination. End the occu-
pation. Israel deserves security, and 
Palestinians 
deserve 
self-determina-
tion and freedom. 
Tonight, no child should go to bed 
under the constant fear of violence. We 
should all want every Israeli and every 
Palestinian child to live with peace, 
opportunity, hope for the future. And 
that is what I am working to achieve 
with my colleagues. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative MCCOLLUM very much 
for those words. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 26 minutes remaining. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Ms. PRESSLEY), my colleague. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the deep trauma and 
loss of life perpetuated by systems of 
oppression here in the United States 
and globally. 
Many times I have stood at this dais 
and affirmed that our destinies are 
tied. That was clear when protestors 
took to the streets in the face of police 
murders, seeking to build a nation 
where Black lives matter. 
That was clear when our democracy 
and our lives were put at risk by vio-
lent white supremacists, who shattered 
glass and broke doors while wearing 
anti-Semitic phrases on their chests, 
carrying the Confederate flag, erecting 
a noose on the west lawn. 
That was clear when students pro-
testing to end poverty and oppression 
in the streets of Bogota were shot dead. 
That was clear when families kneel-
ing during this holy month at the third 
holiest site in Islam were met with 
teargas, rubber bullets, and hand gre-
nades. 
Our destinies are tied. As a Black 
woman in America, I am no stranger to 
police brutality and State-sanctioned 
violence. We have been criminalized for 
the very way we show up in the world. 
Last summer, when Black Lives Mat-
ter protestors took to the streets to de-
mand justice, they were met with 
force. They faced teargas, rubber bul-
lets, and a militarized police, just as 
our Palestinian brothers and sisters 
are facing in Jerusalem today. 
Palestinians are being told the same 
thing as Black folks in America: There 
is no acceptable form of resistance. 
We are bearing witness to egregious 
human rights violations. The pain, 
trauma, and terror the Palestinians are 
facing is not just the result of this 
week’s escalation, but the consequence 
of years of military occupation. 
In Sheikh Jarrah, the Israeli Govern-
ment is violently dispossessing yet an-
other neighborhood of Palestinian fam-
ilies from homes they have lived in for 
decades. 
We cannot stand idly and complicitly 
by and allow the occupation and op-
pression of the Palestinian people to 
continue. We cannot remain silent 
when our government sends $3.8 billion 
of military aid to Israel that is used to 
demolish Palestinian homes, imprison 
Palestinian children, and displace Pal-
estinian families. 
A budget is a reflection of our values. 
I am committed to ensuring that our 
government does not fund state vio-
lence in any form anywhere. 
Many say that ‘‘conditioning aid’’ is 
not a phrase that I should utter here,

but let me be clear: No matter the con-
text, American Government dollars al-
ways come with conditions. 
The questions at hand are: Should 
our taxpayer dollars create conditions 
for justice, healing, and repair? Or 
should those dollars create conditions 
for oppression and apartheid? 
b 1845 
Now, while I hold due space for the 
storied history and the unique lived ex-
periences on the ground globally, there 
is a through line here. 
And whether we are talking about 
the militarization of our communities 
or weapons of war, the question is the 
same. If our budgets are a statement of 
our values, what do we value? Whose 
lives do we value? We have seen foot-
age of Israeli and Palestinian children 
huddled fearfully while rockets blanket 
their homeland. No child should live in 
fear. No child should grow up in the 
midst of a conflict that robs them of a 
childhood. And Palestinian children do 
not have the same protections afforded 
to them. 
Without the U.S. exerting pressure 
on Israel to deescalate, the explosive 
situation in Jerusalem is igniting fur-
ther violence not just in the city, but 
beyond. It is clear there is a grave 
asymmetry of power here. Palestinians 
do not have a sovereign state and the 
protections that come with it. 
Following forceful violence against 
the Palestinians simply seeking to re-
main in their family homes, militant 
groups in Gaza have launched rockets 
at Israeli cities, resulting in seven 
deaths, including a child. In response, 
the Israeli military has launched se-
vere attacks on Gaza, killing 83 people, 
17 of whom are children. This is dev-
astating. 
The destinies of the Israeli and Pales-
tinian people are tied. Our outrage at 
the pain, violence, and oppression they 
face must be clear and unapologetic. 
Equal outrage for violence perpetrated 
against all people, and moral clarity 
when 
state-sanctioned 
violence 
is 
claiming the lives of innocent mothers, 
fathers, daughters, and sons. 
From Jerusalem to Boston, from 
Randolph to Gaza, from Colombia to 
Yemen, our destinies are tied, and ev-
eryone deserves to live from fear and to 
know peace. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for those remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask the 
rest of my colleagues if we can try to 
keep it to 3 to 4 minutes each. The 
good news is there are many people 
who are very passionate about human 
rights in the Mid-East, the problem is 
we have an hour total, and I would ap-
preciate that consideration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
know this has been a very difficult 
week for us as a global community, as 
communities that are concerned for 
human rights, all human rights in gen-
eral, and in particular, the rights of 
Palestinians and Israelis alike that 
have been impacted by the fear and vi-
olence of this week. 
Now, what I think is, you know, im-
portant is that—I will start with a 
story. As a little girl, my family comes 
from the island of Puerto Rico, and I 
grew up visiting my family on the is-
land of Vieques, communities on the is-
land of Vieques, where the United 
States bombed its own territories, its 
own communities. 
And I would go to sleep as a little 
girl to the sound of U.S. bombs deto-
nating. Practice is what it was called 
at the time. Practice. And when I saw 
those air strikes that are supported 
with U.S. funds, I could not help but 
wonder if our communities were prac-
tice for this. 
This is our business because we are 
playing a role in it. And the United 
States must acknowledge its role in 
the injustice and human rights viola-
tions of Palestinians. This is not about 
both sides. This is about an imbalance 
of power. 
When I first got here in 2019, the 
Israeli Government refused to admit 
two Members of the United States Con-
gress, RASHIDA TLAIB and ILHAN OMAR, 
into the country. They banned Mem-
bers of this very body because of who 
they were. They said it was a sign of 
weakness. 
We have to have the courage to name 
our contributions, and sometimes I 
can’t help but wonder if the reason we 
don’t do that, if we are scared to stand 
up to the incarceration of children in 
Palestine, is because maybe it will 
force us to confront the incarceration 
of children here on our border. 
If by standing up to the injustices 
there, it will prompt us to stand up to 
the injustices here. We have a responsi-
bility. And if we have historically said 
and committed to a role as an honest 
broker, then we must fulfill that role. 
That means we have to be honest with 
ourselves, with what our aid supports. 
We have to be honest and ask ourselves 
questions like why we are using our 
veto power on the U.N. Security Coun-
cil in preventing statements from 
being released about concerns for this 
violence alike. 
The President and many other fig-
ures this week stated that Israel has a 
right to self-defense, and this is a sen-
timent that is echoed across this body. 
But do Palestinians have a right to 
survive? Do we believe that? And, if so, 
we have a responsibility to that as 
well. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for those words. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Ms. BUSH). 
Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis 
and I rise in solidarity with the Pales-
tinian people and in memory of our 
brother, Bassem Masri, a Ferguson ac-
tivist who was with us on the front 
lines of our uprising for justice fol-
lowing the police murder of Michael 
Brown, Jr. 
Bassem was a St. Louis Palestinian. 
Bassem also lived in Jerusalem, Pal-
estine. Bassem was one of us. He 
showed up ready. As a Palestinian, he 
was ready to resist, to rebel, to rise up 
with us as our St. Louis community 
mourned Mike Brown, Jr.’s state-sanc-
tioned murder, and as we demanded an 
end to the militarized police occupa-
tion of our communities. 
Palestinians know what state vio-
lence, militarized policing, and occupa-
tion of their communities looks like, 
and they have lived that reality of hav-
ing to go through checkpoints while 
trying to live their lives. They know 
this reality and the reality of so much 
more. 
So when heavily militarized police 
forces showed up in Ferguson in 2014, 
Bassem and so many others of our St. 
Louis Palestinian community, our Pal-
estinian siblings showed up, too. 
I remember sitting in a circle on the 
grass near where Michael Brown, Jr., 
was murdered, and I remember them 
describing to us what to do when mili-
tarized law enforcement shot us with 
rubber bullets or when they tear-gassed 
us. I remember learning that the same 
equipment that they use to brutalize 
us is the same equipment that we can 
send to the Israel military to police 
and brutalize Palestinians. 
I remember Bassem putting his life 
on the line with us. I remember him 
live-streaming for the whole world to 
see our struggle. I remember our soli-
darity. And I remember the harass-
ment, the extortion, the brutalization 
he faced for resisting with us. 
That harassment, that extortion, 
that brutalization by heavily-armed 
militarized presence in our commu-
nity, that is what we fund when our 
government sends our tax dollars to 
the Israeli military. 
St. Louis sent me here to save lives. 
Bassem’s loved ones in his community, 
our St. Louis community, sent me here 
to save lives. That means we oppose 
our money going to fund militarized 
policing, occupation and systems of 
violent oppression and trauma. 
We are anti-war. We are anti-occupa-
tion. We are anti-apartheid. Period. 
If this body is looking for something 
productive to do with $3 million, in-
stead of funding a military that polices 
and kills Palestinians, I have some 
communities in St. Louis City and in 
St. Louis County where that money 
can go, where we desperately need in-
vestment, where we are hurting, where 
we need help. Let us prioritize funding 
there. Prioritize funding life, not de-
struction. 
So, today, we remember Bassem. We 
remember his resistance in the face of 
militarized police occupation as a St. 
Louisan and as a Palestinian. 
We lost him to a health crisis, but we 
remember his words today. Until all 
our children are safe, we will continue 
to fight for our rights in Palestine and 
in Ferguson. We stand with you in soli-
darity. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time we have remain-
ing?

May 13, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 13 minutes remaining. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), a great colleague and 
mentor of mine. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am horrified and sad-
dened by the ongoing escalation of vio-
lence in Gaza and in Israel. 
We have now seen over 1,800 rockets 
being fired indiscriminately at Israel’s 
citizens, who are now fleeing for their 
lives. Yes, I believe that Israel does 
have a right to defend herself. 
Now, 103 Palestinians and seven 
Israelis are dead, including children. It 
is so painful. The cycle of violence that 
we see over and over again. Yes, I be-
lieve Israel does have the right to de-
fend herself. But in the end, there are 
no winners. 
The United States can play a role. 
The Biden administration has dis-
patched the Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary of State, his name is Hady Amr, 
to Israel, and his job is to deal with the 
situation in Israel and Palestine. I am 
hopeful that we will see a deescalation 
and a ceasefire. But a return to status 
quo is simply not enough. 
Earlier this week, prior to the at-
tacks, I was deeply disturbed by the in-
tentional and the intended evacuation 
of Palestinian families, some of whom 
have been in their homes for decades. 
The Biden administration, through its 
National Security Advisor, Jake Sul-
livan, has also conveyed its consterna-
tion, its concern, about the evictions, 
and has called and has urged the ad-
ministration to remain heavily in-
volved, to address the root causes of 
this violence, including ongoing evic-
tions, displacement, and occupation, as 
it works to secure a ceasefire. 
The violence must end now, and we 
must work to enable dialogue that can 
lead to a just, safe, and secure future 
for both Israelis and Palestinians. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for those words. 
b 1900 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
POCAN
for 
yielding. 
To Members of the body, the occupa-
tion must end, and there must be a just 
solution for both peoples. We cannot 
keep turning a blind eye to the prac-
tices that rob people of their genera-
tional homes or detaining children. 
Israeli and Palestinian families want 
to raise their children in safety and in 
peace, and we have got to take firm, 
diplomatic 
steps 
to 
support 
those 
goals. 
While the evictions in west Jeru-
salem and the hostilities around Al 
Aqsa Mosque seem to have provoked 
the latest escalation in violence. We 
have got to take a hard look at how 
the situation has changed in recent 
years. The Biden administration must 
reverse Trump’s detrimental actions 
and take steps to ensure that U.S. aid 
to Israel cannot be used for the seizure 
or destruction of Palestinian homes. 
We have also got to continue humani-
tarian aid to Palestinian territories. 
The use of war-grade weapons and 
the killing of civilians must stop. I 
have 
always 
strongly 
supported 
a 
rights-based approach and a two-state 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict, and the current situation makes 
it more crucial than ever to pursue via-
ble pathways toward equality, self-de-
termination, and peace. 
I sincerely thank Mr. POCAN and the 
Progressive Caucus for putting this 
Special Order hour together. I hope and 
pray that the death and self-destruc-
tion will end and that we may work to-
ward a peaceful solution centered on 
the humanity and the rights of all in-
volved. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for those words. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the State of Indiana (Mr. CAR-
SON). He is extremely patient because 
he has been here nearly an hour to 
speak. 
Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the Pales-
tinian people as they face grave injus-
tices, violence, and certainly abuse. I 
join the countless people around the 
world, Mr. Speaker, who are vehe-
mently opposed to the planned, forced 
evictions of Palestinians in Sheikh 
Jarrah and saddened by the escalating 
violence that threatens Israelis and 
Palestinians alike. 
We must condemn all forms of vio-
lence and mourn the loss of both Pales-
tinian lives and Israeli lives. 
I stand here today as one of the three 
Muslims serving in Congress on Eid 
day, heartbroken to see the attacks on 
the 
worshippers 
at 
the 
Al-Aqsa 
Mosque, one of the holiest sites of 
Islam in our holiest month of the year 
by the Israeli Government. 
For 
decades, 
Israel 
has 
violated 
international law and basic human 
rights through its systematic displace-
ment of Palestinians. For too long, 
America has looked the other way as 
Israel has engaged in this horrific cam-
paign against Palestinians. 
Israel is our security partner. In fact, 
the U.S. alone gives Israel billions of 
dollars per year. But we must make 
sure that our taxpayer dollars are not 
being used to fund human rights viola-
tions. 
Enough is enough. 
America has a moral obligation to 
use our influence to protect the vic-
tims of human rights violations includ-
ing the Palestinian people. We must 
work to strengthen our work to bring 
peace to this region. This is our moral 
responsibility to do the right thing. It 
is not about Jews versus Muslims or 
Israel versus its neighbors. It is about 
right versus wrong. 
Let me be clear: Israel’s decade of 
forced displacement is wrong. That is 
why we are working hard in Congress 
to make things right. Our American 
Government 
must 
enforce 
inter-
national law and our own foundational 
principles, and our allies, like Israel, 
must be held accountable for human 
rights violations. 
Now, we are going to keep working 
hard in Congress to pass much-needed 
legislation 
that 
achieves 
account-
ability, equality, and justice for all. 
America is great and powerful—prob-
ably the greatest nation in recorded 
history. But America is complex. It is 
a complicated work in progress. For 
centuries she has engaged in and en-
abled the mistreatment of countless 
people from the slavery enshrined in 
its Constitution against Africans to 
the taking of land from Native Ameri-
cans, or the shameful support of dic-
tators beyond our shores. But today we 
face an inflection point, a reckoning of 
whether we will stand up for the values 
we claim to cherish or if we will turn a 
blind eye to repeated violations of 
human rights. 
We cannot turn our backs now. We 
must recognize that this is an inter-
national struggle and stick by the 
words of Dr. King when he said that in-
justice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere. 
I am thankful for Dr. King and for 
the long list of great Americans who 
have helped bend the arc of the moral 
universe toward justice. We stand on 
the shoulders and march in their foot-
steps as we advance their legacy and 
boldly stand up to protect the human 
rights of the Palestinian people. By 
working together, we can ensure that 
America uses her power for good in 
Palestine and around the world. 
Let’s keep up this momentum. Let’s 
help secure justice for the Palestinian 
people. Let’s work for peace. Let’s 
never give up. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his words. 
I know we are short on time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today with grave concern about 
the ongoing violence in Israel and Pal-
estine. The events of the last week and 
the deaths of so many Israeli and Pal-
estinian civilians, including many chil-
dren, are heartbreaking. My condo-
lences 
to 
their 
families 
and 
my 
thoughts are with those in Israel and 
Gaza who continue to live in fear. 
Rocket attacks by Hamas and other 
militant groups that intentionally tar-
get civilians are, of course, reprehen-
sible, and I condemn them unequivo-
cally. The escalation of violence is not 
in the interest of Israelis or Palestin-
ians, but only extremists who thrive on 
conflict. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
needs to call on the Israeli Government 
to agree to a cease-fire and put pres-
sure on Hamas to do the same. 
I have consistently supported secu-
rity assistance to Israel and voted to 
fund the Iron Dome, which is saving

lives as we speak. Yet Israel’s dis-
proportionate response to Hamas’ at-
tacks, destroying entire buildings and 
public spaces, is exacerbating this hor-
rible cycle of violence. These air 
strikes, which have already resulted in 
the deaths of civilians and at least 38 
women and children, must stop. We 
need a cease-fire now, and the United 
States must help bring one about. 
Beyond stopping the immediate vio-
lence, the United States must also urge 
Israel to support the creation of a Pal-
estinian state—the only way to end 
this cycle of violence for good. The sta-
tus quo of occupation and creeping de 
facto annexation is unjust and not sus-
tainable. The forced evictions of Pales-
tinian families in east Jerusalem are 
wrong, and it is not the first time that 
events like we saw last week in Sheikh 
Jarrah have happened. 
I will wrap up by saying that I hope 
and pray for peace. I want to thank my 
colleague, RASHIDA TLAIB. I think part 
of what has been missing in Congress is 
hearing Palestinian voices. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
f 
ECONOMICS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, to-
night, I am going to actually try to do 
something that is a little tricky, but I 
am going to first sort of explain the 
theme, and then I am going to sort of 
walk through some of the backup ma-
terial. 
We understand right now, our broth-
ers and sisters on the left have, what, 
another $41⁄2
trillion of spending— 
maybe it is 5—in the pipeline, a couple 
major multi-spending of that, let’s call 
it that $41⁄2 trillion over the next 10 
years. They claim to have about $3 tril-
lion in tax increases coming to pay for 
it. The reality—and hopefully I will be 
able to do this over the next couple of 
weeks as we try to get more details and 
work through it line by line—it also re-
quires that you hit every mark on the 
revenue raised, that all sorts of pro-
grams expire, which is really unlikely 
around here, and also certain spending 
expires. 
It is just not real. So our top-of-the- 
napkin math right now is at best over 
the 10 years it is a couple trillion dol-
lars in new revenues. 
Well, one of the sets of revenues that 
is being discussed is, well, let’s tax the 
wealthy. Okay. Except when you walk 
through the math there, let’s raise cap-
ital gains tax, let’s raise basis, let’s 
raise individuals’ income tax, and also 
then you add in let’s raise taxes on cor-
porations, fine, but we are already 
starting to see the data coming in say-
ing that just going to the 28 percent on 
the corporate tax rate is 1 million jobs 
over the next 24 months. 
Okay, so the Democratic Party wipes 
out 1 million jobs and takes, oh, I 
think it was a little less, like $119 bil-
lion or something off just the GDP 
from those 2 years, and you start to lay 
out—that is just the corporate income 
tax. Now start to do the capital gains 
which the beauty of capital gains is it 
is risk-taking. It is the type of invest-
ment that makes the working poor less 
poor. It is the type of investment that 
takes risks that makes us more pro-
ductive, because, Mr. Speaker, you all 
remember your high school economics 
class. 
What are the two ways a worker gets 
paid more? 
Inflation, which means you got paid 
for more but it didn’t get you any-
thing, or productivity. Without that 
risk capital, Mr. Speaker, you lose that 
productivity investment. 
So, if the Democrats really intend to 
spend that much money and really in-
tend to keep driving up the debt and 
deficits the way they are, then I want 
to make a modest proposal of where 
they can find some offsets. I am 
shocked 
this 
isn’t 
discussed 
more 
around here. Instead of marching in 
and saying that we are going to tax 
rich people, even though much of that 
money actually goes to create jobs, in-
vestment, economic growth, and pro-
ductivity growth for our brothers and 
sisters who are in the hardworking 
class, why don’t we stop subsidizing the 
rich? 
I am going to show a number of 
boards here today on how this govern-
ment takes some of the very, very, 
very wealthiest in this country and on 
one hand says: Pay the taxes and, oh, 
by the way, we are going to hand you 
back the cash. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to show you 
one 
board 
where 
individuals 
with 
multi, 
multi, 
multi-million 
dollar 
houses on the beach then get dramati-
cally subsidized flood insurance from 
the Federal general fund and over and 
over and over. 
If this is the path the Democrats in-
tend to go, could they consider cutting 
spending? 
Because cutting that spending would 
be much less distortionary—that is an 
actual word—-distorting the economy 
because the taxes being discussed right 
now are going to hurt the economy. 
They are going to hurt working people, 
and they are going to really hurt the 
working poor. 
So, if you need this much revenue— 
and our back-of-the-napkin math right 
now is about $1,400,000,000,000 over the 
10 years in subsidies that could be cut 
for that very top fraction of income 
earners and wealth holders in the 
United States. So there is a place to 
get your revenue without creating the 
economic distortion being discussed 
right now. 
So let’s first talk about the reality of 
where we are at as a people, as a soci-
ety, and as a country. 
How many actually right now know 
the latest numbers from CBO on how 
much trouble we are in just on Medi-
care? 
The 30-year window right now on 
Medicare is a $71 trillion shortfall just 
in Medicare. 
b 1915 
Remember, in Medicare only, it has 
the A, B, C, D. But part A, which is the 
hospital portion, is the only part we 
collect as part of your FICA tax. Ev-
erything else, ultimately, comes out of 
the general fund. 
We always talk about part B and part 
D because part C is the managed care 
portion. But if you look at the actual 
outlays of the program and then look 
at the interest costs and remove part 
A, the hospital portion, it is $71 tril-
lion, and it is just Medicare. 
I am just stunned more Members of 
Congress don’t understand this or are 
willing to tell their constituents the 
truth. That Medicare number rep-
resents 67 percent of the deficit debt 
shortfall over that 30 years. Once 
again, the Medicare shortfall is 67 per-
cent of the debt we are going to be in, 
in 30 years. 
So, we take that. Now, let’s add in 
Social Security. Social Security is in 
better shape. It functionally has only 
about a $28 trillion shortfall over the 
next 30 years because you reach in and 
you take the portion of the trust fund. 
Here is the trust fund portion. You 
see the green sliver? 
Then, the rest are what we predict as 
incoming payroll taxes. Here are the 
programs’ outlays, and then the inter-
est on the shortfall. 
Work with me. If Medicare is $71 tril-
lion, Social Security is $28 trillion, 
right there, you are at—what?—$99 tril-
lion of the debt is driven by just Social 
Security and Medicare. 
Well, the good news is—if it is that— 
the rest of the budget over that 30-year 
window is only about $3 trillion short. 
So, in a perverse way, the rest of the 
budget is out of balance by only $3 tril-
lion. It is pretty close to being in bal-
ance, in the type of numbers we are 
using here in Washington today. 
There should be just a fixation, if 
this body cared about retirement secu-
rity, cared about the future, cared 
about everyone from my 5-year-old 
daughter, who is going to be paying 
these taxes, to, hopefully, myself, who 
will be receiving some of these bene-
fits. If we actually cared, there should 
be an absolute fixation on these num-
bers. 
Instead, there is a fixation here on 
spending more money and spending 
money that we can show you is going 
to shrink the economy and unemploy a 
lot more Americans. 
I am trying to speak as an economist 
with some passion. If you look at post- 
tax reform, post-some of the regulatory 
rationalizations, and maybe with some 
good luck, if you look at 2018–2019, that 
should be the goal, to get back to what 
was happening in the economy in those 
years. Because if you take a look, after 
the tax reform, workers were receiving 
a substantially larger portion of the 
value of that tax reform. It was sub-
stantially a miracle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2310 
May 13, 2021 
But I want to show you one of my fa-
vorite slides here. If you look at the 
number of Americans in 2018, 2019, who 
were in poverty, do you realize we had 
a couple of the lowest years—actually, 
the lowest years in history of our 
brothers and sisters, our fellow Ameri-
cans, in poverty. You look at the lines 
for African Americans, Hispanics, An-
glos, this is supposed to be the goal. 
You do understand we had a couple of 
years where income inequality dra-
matically shrank, and it didn’t shrink 
because rich people were getting less 
rich. It shrank because poor people, 
particularly the working poor, were 
getting less poor, and fairly dramati-
cally less poor. 
Here is maybe a perverse reason the 
left is fixated on wanting, on one hand, 
to raise the taxes on the wealthy and, 
on the other hand, hand them a bunch 
of subsidies. Well, there is also a very 
ugly political reason. When you hand 
people subsidies, maybe they help your 
campaign, maybe they pay attention to 
you. 
But if you take a look at 2013 to 2016, 
see the orange bar here? That was the 
gain of wealth of the wealthy. The blue 
was the poorest portion of Americans. 
The income inequality gap under 
those Obama years actually grew dra-
matically. The rich did get richer. The 
poor did get poorer. 
When Republicans provided tax re-
form, when we cleaned up much of the 
regulatory system, you know what 
happened? The value of working peo-
ple’s labor went up fairly dramatically. 
Our brothers and sisters who we refer 
to often as blue collar, the working 
poor, they got substantially wealthier. 
Their 
income—their 
labor 
became 
much more valuable. 
The rich didn’t even keep close. It 
was like three times the differential. 
When someone tells you during the 
last administration, well, the rich were 
getting richer and the poorer were get-
ting poorer, they are lying to you. 
They are just not looking at the math. 
It turns out tax reform—regulatory 
reform, actually—made the poor much 
less poor. It didn’t shrink the pie. It ac-
tually made prosperity across the 
country. 
Then, we hit this damn virus. 
So, we look at the brilliance of what 
we have done in this last year, and you 
start to realize the economic violence 
we are committing on the poor. 
Actually, before we do this board, 
what are some of the things you can do 
to really crush the working poor in 
your country? Open up the borders, and 
make those who may not have finished 
high school—what they sell is their tal-
ents and their labor. They may not 
have high skill sets, and for so long, 
that skill set didn’t have enough value 
in this economy. Then, in 2018 and 2019, 
we saw the working poor get dramati-
cally less poor because their labor be-
came much more valuable. 
When you open up the border, you 
flood the marketplace with those who 
compete with them with similar skill 
sets. 
We have lots of data. A couple of 
weeks ago, I showed some charts that 
showed one of the most vicious things, 
the economic violence you can commit 
on the working poor with having an 
open border. 
What is the number two thing? It is 
what we have been hearing about the 
last couple of days. When you see this 
type of inflation on gasoline, on com-
modity foods, on being able to put a 
roof over your head, the middle class, 
it hurts. The upper classes, they make 
money because they hold lots of assets. 
They are getting richer now. 
But if are you part of that working 
poor, that blue-collar working class 
that did so well in the previous couple 
of years, they are getting their heads 
kicked in right now because we have 
pumped in so many dollars chasing so 
few goods. We are kicking the poor in 
their heads, and it is the policies com-
ing out of this place that are doing it 
to them. 
Yet, the third leg of how you make 
the poor less poor is work, that attach-
ment to the value of their labor that 
businesses, concerns, others that need 
them, that help them raise their skill 
sets, that help them build their senior-
ity. 
Yet, we have a system right now 
where, as you can see in this chart, in 
much of the country, we are paying 
people more money to stay home than 
take the employment. 
You do realize right now you may be 
a hero if you are a Member of Congress 
and you have been voting to do en-
hanced unemployment benefits. But in 
the future, when those things start to 
run out, and they have lost a year to 2 
years of skills, of seniority, of moving 
up in the organization they are em-
ployed by, you explain to them why 
their lifetime wages have been crushed. 
Some of this is also driven by the 
teachers’ unions playing games of not 
opening up. 
Do we understand the level of eco-
nomic dislocation that these policies 
are going to give us, not this year, not 
next year, but maybe for the coming 
decade? 
Let’s go back to my previous theme. 
We see that economic robustness, vital-
ity, opportunity, economic growth is 
moral. If this place truly cares and 
claims they care about workers and the 
working poor—now, we are about to do 
the next round of economic kick-in- 
the-head. We are going to call it taxing 
the wealthy, but we are also going to 
remove the very capital out of the mar-
kets that go to the investments that 
make us more productive, that make it 
so we can hire and pay people. 
You already saw the one study—I 
have it right over here on the chair— 
that says that just the corporate tax 
hike will unemploy 1 million Ameri-
cans in the first 24 months. 
Let’s walk through and see how bold 
and economically literate the left is 
around here. Here is the National 
Flood Insurance Program. It turns out 
that if you look at the chart over here, 
where much of the subsidized spending 
is coming from the general fund, it is 
for the folks who are 165 percent of the 
mean income and up. 
We were trying to work out another 
chart that showed it was some of the 
top 1, 2, 3 percent of income earners 
and wealth holders in the entire coun-
try who were actually getting the sub-
stantial portion of the subsidized flood 
insurance. 
If you need more money to keep 
spending, maybe cut some of the spend-
ing where you are subsidizing the very 
people you are threatening to tax. It is 
a really creative, simple idea: Cut some 
spending. And you can cut the spending 
on the very people who you vilify so 
much. 
Look, a couple of these are uncom-
fortable, but it is still the math. If you 
look at some of the top wealth house-
holds in the Nation, and you take a 
look at how much money will go to 
those individuals in everything from 
Social Security, Medicare, other types 
of programs—you really need to under-
stand. Does it make sense to play this 
shell game of saying Democrats are 
going to raise taxes on the rich? Okay, 
but we are going to turn around and 
hand you all these benefits and hand 
you all these subsidies through the 
other hand. It is an irrational sort of 
washing machine of the money. 
Another one I will give you is, you 
take a number of the subsidies that go 
to agriculture, and take the sliver who 
are the wealthiest holders of those ag-
ribusinesses. Guess where the substan-
tial portion of the subsidies go? 
So, on one hand, you are saying we 
are going to tax you more, but we are 
going to turn around and hand you 
back the commodity subsidies. It is an 
irrational plan, once again, devoid of 
basic math and basic economics that 
the Democrats are proposing. 
Who knows, maybe it is great poli-
tics, saying we are going to tax the 
rich. I mean, we see the polling. Many 
in the Republican base aren’t particu-
larly thrilled. We know the Democrat 
base vilifies it, even though that is 
where much of the left actually gets 
their money. But it is just bad econom-
ics. 
Do we want to step back into the 
days when, for great politics, we did 
things that truly crushed the workers, 
the working poor, in this country by 
making the economy smaller than it 
should be, slowing down economic 
growth but slowing down also those in-
vestments that make us more produc-
tive, that make it so we can pay our 
brothers and sisters more? 
My challenge to the left is: We have 
been working up the numbers now for a 
couple of weeks. Brian Riedel, of the 
Manhattan Institute, has a great arti-
cle that is about to be published walk-
ing through lots of these numbers. 
Take it for your consideration. 
Brian’s number is about $1 trillion of 
subsidies that go to the rich. Our num-
ber is about $1.4 trillion over the 10 
years that go to the rich. We have

added in flood insurance and a couple 
of 
other 
programs 
that 
we 
have 
thought about. 
But the last part of this thought ex-
periment, you are telling me it is abso-
lutely ethical that saying, on one hand, 
I want to tax these folks more. But, oh, 
by the way, here is your subsidy to buy 
your electric car. Here is your subsidy 
to buy the solar panels. Here is your 
subsidy to have a multimillion-dollar 
house in a flood zone. Here is your sub-
sidy. 
This is irrational economics. It is ir-
rational policy. And the only reason a 
political party would continue to sup-
port it is they understand it is the 
shiny objects that get used for addi-
tional political support. That is a cyn-
ical, dark thing for our friends on the 
left to continue to do. 
So that is my thought experiment for 
this evening. We are going to try to 
add some more detail on these numbers 
over the coming weeks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, teach us Your wisdom 
and discipline. Because of Your wis-
dom, may our lawmakers have insights 
that guide them on the path of truth. 
Give them a passion to do what is 
right, to love mercy, and to walk hum-
bly with You. Because of Your gift of 
discipline, may our Senators grow in 
grace and in a knowledge of You, 
supplementing their faith with gen-
erous provisions of moral excellence, 
self-control, and patient endurance. 
Lord, keep us all from deliberate sin 
so that the words of our lips and the re-
flections of our hearts will please You. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee, on which you sit, came to-
gether on a bipartisan basis to advance 
the Endless Frontier Act by a vote of 
24 to 4—24 to 4. 
We are now one step closer to passing 
a bill that will keep our country one 
step ahead in science and technology 
for decades to come. It is my intention 
for the Senate to take up the Endless 
Frontier Act next week in a package 
with legislation to strengthen our alli-
ances and partnerships; invest in the 
American semiconductor industry; en-
sure that China pays a price for its 
predatory actions; and boost advanced 
manufacturing, innovation, and crit-
ical supply chains. 
For decades, American prosperity has 
been anchored by our unmatched ca-
pacity for innovation and invention in 
science and in technology. American 
innovation propelled American indus-
try, 
and 
an 
American 
workforce 
brought those innovations to the glob-
al economy. 
But, unfortunately, Federal under-
investment in sciences has seen our 
country slip, exposing critical weak 
spots in our economy. If we don’t fix 
them, we will no longer be the No. 1 
economic leader in the world in the 
decade to come. So it is an imperative 
that we do this. This is for our future— 
our future for jobs, our future for eco-
nomic leadership, and our future for 
world leadership. 
It all boils down to science, some-
thing that was ignored, unfortunately, 
by the last administration, but, fortu-
nately, bipartisan unity in this Senate 
is bringing us back on the page that we 
need to do science. 
The Endless Frontier Act would right 
the ship by making one of the largest 
investments in American innovation in 
generations, 
allowing 
the 
United 
States to outcompete countries like 
China, create more good-paying jobs, 
and harden our economic and our na-
tional security as well because this bill 
is vital to national security as well as 
to economic security. 
I want to really applaud Chairwoman 
CANTWELL, Ranking Member WICKER, 
and my partner in the Endless Frontier 
Act Senator YOUNG, all of whom 
worked hard, long, diligently, and ef-
fectively, in a bipartisan fashion, to 
move this legislation through regular 
order. The full Senate will consider 
and, I believe, should finish this impor-
tant legislation before the end of the 
month with strong bipartisan support. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
judges and on nominees, over the past 
several months, the Senate has moved 
quickly to confirm nominees to serve 
in 
President 
Biden’s 
Cabinet 
and 
throughout his administration. The 
Senate also has a constitutional duty 
to provide advice and consent on the 
President’s judicial nominations, and 
the Senate will begin to fill judicial va-
cancies very soon. 
This morning, the Judiciary Com-
mittee is holding the first markup for 
a slate of President Biden’s judicial

S2500 
May 13, 2021 
nominations, 
including 
two 
circuit 
nominees and three district court 
nominees, who will all receive a vote in 
the committee next week. The Senate 
is now going to scale up our efforts to 
fill more than 80 vacancies in the Fed-
eral judiciary. 
It is no secret that, lacking a robust 
legislative agenda, the Republican ma-
jority, under President Trump, focused 
on 
judges, 
confirming 
around 
200. 
President Obama, in his 8 years, ap-
pointed 320. So even though, on a 4- 
year-to-4-year basis, Trump did more, 
overall, Obama had a greater effect on 
the judiciary than Trump. 
Now, President Biden has the oppor-
tunity to fill more than 80 vacancies— 
likely more. Under this Democratic 
majority, the Senate will swiftly and 
routinely take up President Biden’s ap-
pointments to the Federal bench. It 
will redress the imbalance that the 
Trump 
administration 
caused 
by 
choosing so many judges who were so 
far hard right, way out of the main-
stream not just of the American people 
but even of the Republican Party. 
Under this Democratic majority, we 
are going to swiftly and routinely take 
up President Biden’s appointments to 
the Federal bench to restore some bal-
ance. And, I must say, President 
Biden’s judicial candidates provide a 
stark contrast to the quality, to the 
caliber of President Trump’s nomina-
tions. President Biden’s nominees are 
qualified, mainstream, and actually re-
flect the diversity of the country. 
Many have spent years as public de-
fenders, an experience that is sorely 
lacking on the Federal bench. They 
also include the first Native American 
to be nominated to the Federal court, 
the second-ever Puerto Rican, and the 
second Black woman to sit on the Sec-
ond Circuit in my home State of New 
York. I am very proud of that. 
That is a far cry from what we got 
under President Trump and then-Ma-
jority Leader MCCONNELL. For 4 years, 
the Republican leader turned the Sen-
ate into a conveyor belt for inexperi-
enced lawyers, many with deeply rad-
ical views on women’s choice, voting 
rights, 
criminal 
justice, 
and 
civil 
rights. A few of them were so extreme 
on the issues of race and voting that 
Republican Senators joined with Demo-
crats to reject those nominations. 
With President Biden, we are going 
to bring balance back to the Federal 
judiciary by confirming judges who are 
beholden to the law, not some far-right 
agenda. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. 
CLARKE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other issue in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, this morning the Judiciary 
Committee will also vote on a very im-
portant nominee to the Department of 
Justice, Kristen Clarke, to serve as the 
Assistant AG for Civil Rights. 
The daughter of Jamaican immi-
grants, Ms. Clarke is an extremely well 
qualified and capable civil rights attor-
ney who will be the first Black woman 
to ever fill her position at the Justice 
Department. 
But her obvious quality did not stop 
a few of our Republican colleagues 
from trying to smear her record. The 
political right seems to relish in trying 
to score political points by connecting 
every Justice Department nominee, 
many of whom happen to be women of 
color, to hot-button partisan issues, 
whether or not they have any rel-
evance. 
In Ms. Clarke’s hearing, it reached 
the point of absurdity when she was 
grilled on an obviously satirical piece 
she published for her college news-
paper. Just like Ms. Vanita Gupta, who 
I am proud to say is now the Associate 
Attorney General, Ms. Clarke was 
treated by the minority on the Judici-
ary Committee like some hair-raising 
radical, despite her record, her quali-
fications, and her support from all 
sides. And just like Ms. Gupta, Ms. 
Clarke has been endorsed by the Na-
tion’s most powerful law enforcement 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Police 
and the Major Cities Chiefs Associa-
tion. 
Ms. Clarke is an outstanding, an out-
standing nominee, and I urge all of my 
colleagues on the Senate Judiciary to 
advance her nomination today. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized.

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
will begin this morning where I began 
on Monday, talking about National Po-
lice Week. Yesterday, I got to welcome 
members 
of 
Kentucky’s 
Fraternal 
Order of Police here to my office. I was 
glad for the chance to share my grati-
tude for their service and hear what 
was on their minds. 
Tragically, the past year’s fallen offi-
cers, whom we will be memorializing 
this week, includes one of Kentucky’s 
own. In early 2020, Detective James 
Kirk of the Stanton Police Department 
suddenly passed away from a heart at-
tack in the wake of struggling with an 
armed subject. He was only 40 years 
old. 
By all accounts, during James’s near-
ly 20 years of service, he became a 
model officer. He even served as police 
chief of a nearby department. His col-
leagues 
remembered 
his 
easygoing, 
friendly nature and his total profes-
sionalism. 
As our Nation honors this brave Ken-
tuckian, we continue to hold his wife 
Brandy, their family, and the entire 
Stanton Police Department in our 
prayers. Later today, Detective Kirk 
will join the ranks of heroes enshrined 
on the National Law Enforcement Me-
morial. 
We are also honoring our colleagues 
here in the Capitol this week, the U.S. 
Capitol Police. On Peace Officers Me-
morial Day this Saturday, we will espe-
cially 
remember 
Officers 
Evans, 
Sicknick, and Liebengood, all taken 
too soon. 
Their sacrifices are a sharp reminder: 
Standing with law enforcement isn’t 
something we can do only 1 week every 
year; we need to back the blue all year 
round. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
an entirely different matter, while 
Senators were back in our home States 
last week, the Washington Post ran 
this headline: ‘‘Chinese greenhouse gas 
emissions now larger than those of de-
veloped countries combined.’’ Let me 
say that again. ‘‘Chinese greenhouse 
gas emissions now larger than those of 
developed countries combined.’’ 
China is out-emitting the United 
States, India, and the entire European 
Union combined. They are now respon-
sible for more than one-fourth of the 
entire world’s emissions. Beijing ad-
mits they aren’t even planning for 
their emissions to start declining for 
another decade. 
It is a clear reality check: No matter 
how much self-inflicted pain the far 
left might want to impose on American 
workers and families, it would barely 
make any dent in the global calculus. 
Remember, with the United States out-
side the Paris Agreement, our emis-
sions fell on our own even as our econ-
omy grew. Meanwhile, countries inside 
the deal, like China, have kept roaring 
right on by. 
Strangely, this didn’t stop the Biden 
administration from rushing to rejoin 
the failed deal. This is just one of the 
ways in which American competitive-
ness has recently seemed to take a 
back seat. 
This White House canceled a pipeline 
project that would have increased en-
ergy security and supported thousands 
of American jobs. They froze explo-
ration 
of 
domestic 
resources 
that 
helped our Nation become a net energy 
exporter for the first time since the 
1950s. 
After we just spent 4 years beginning 
to rebuild and modernize our national 
defense, this administration indicated 
they will propose to cut defense spend-
ing after inflation—fewer resources for 
our troops, fewer tools to keep pace 
with China. They want to play year-to-

year games while our adversaries and 
competitors plan years and decades in 
advance. 
As former Defense Secretary Bob 
Gates put it in an interview this week, 
cutting spending on our military would 
be ‘‘a terrible mistake.’’ That is Presi-
dent Obama’s Defense Secretary, Bob 
Gates. 
There could not be a more dangerous 
approach for the United States—short-
changing the Pentagon and making 
America less competitive. 
The first draft of the so-called jobs 
bill that the White House put forward 
would play into the same dangerous 
dynamic. I am talking about the multi-
trillion-dollar proposal that spends less 
than 6 percent—less than 6 percent—on 
roads and bridges, the plan that Ivy 
League economists say would cost hun-
dreds of billions of dollars more than 
the White House says; push American 
workers’ wages down; and somehow 
manage to shrink our economy despite 
taxing, borrowing, and spending tril-
lions more dollars. That is not a plan 
to make America stronger and more 
competitive; it is a plan to pile up debt 
to leave us even weaker. It would be 
better news for Beijing than for our 
own citizens. 
That is the bad news. The good news 
is that the Senate can do better. This 
body has long tackled real infrastruc-
ture on a commonsense, bipartisan 
basis and ended up with bills that 
passed by big, lopsided, bipartisan 
votes. That is what we Republicans are 
prepared to do again. That is the path 
I discussed with President Biden at the 
White House just yesterday. It was a 
good meeting. That is the road that the 
practical proposal from Senator CAPITO 
and a number of my fellow Republican 
Senators would begin to take us down. 
If our Democratic friends are finally 
ready to reach across the aisle and 
work 
together 
to 
locate 
common 
ground, I am hopeful we can do a lot of 
good for the country and compete with 
China for real. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On one final mat-
ter, the attacks being directed at inno-
cent Israeli citizens are coming from 
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad. 
Both these terrorist groups receive 
support from Iran. 
The regime in Tehran is the most ac-
tive state sponsor of terrorism in the 
entire world. The regime supports Shia 
terrorists, Sunni terrorists, and secular 
terrorists. 
Many of the rockets now raining 
down on Israel cities are gifts from 
Iran, technologies of terror honed by 
Iran’s proxies in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, 
and Lebanon. 
Days ago, the U.S. Navy seized weap-
ons on a vessel that appears to have 
been dispatched from Iran bound for 
Yemen to fuel the violent Houthi ter-
rorists, in violation of the U.N. embar-
go. Just last night, the Houthis again 
fired missiles against Saudi Arabia. 
Public reporting suggests Iran’s prox-
ies, on top of assassinating Iraqi pro-
testers, are stepping up attacks on the 
U.S. and coalition presence in Iraq as 
well. Iran is emboldened by our retreat 
from Afghanistan. They are eager to 
challenge an administration that ap-
pears desperate to return to a failed 
deal. 
What former Defense Secretary Bob 
Gates said this week about weakness 
inviting challenge from China and Rus-
sia applies to Iran as well. 
The answer is not accommodation; it 
is America’s strength. But reportedly, 
this administration is considering pre-
emptive concessions—a huge rollback 
of sanctions, squandering our leverage, 
just to leap back into a failed nuclear 
deal. I sincerely hope these reports 
prove to be wrong. 
It is difficult to believe an American 
President would consider removing 
terrorism- or missile-related sanctions 
at the very moment Iranian rockets 
are raining down on Israel, Iranian- 
backed militia are attacking American 
facilities in Iraq, and Iranian missiles 
are being trained on Saudi Arabia. 
I cannot understand why the admin-
istration is considering any sanctions 
relief to induce Tehran back into the 
Obama deal in the first place. It would 
be total malpractice to squander our 
leverage just to jump back into a 
flawed deal. That kind of preemptive 
capitulation would make negotiating a 
better deal much, much more difficult. 
Iran’s own Foreign Minister has la-
mented that the terror masterminds of 
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
basically run the country. So what on 
Earth does our administration think 
the successors of Soleimani would do 
with another influx of cash? 
If the administration will stay smart, 
stay tough, and work toward a better 
deal that truly halts Iran’s nuclear and 
missile programs, as well as a strategy 
to confront Iranian terrorism, then the 
President will find support and part-
nership from the Republican side. But 
if the administration chooses policies 
that leave America weaker and the 
world more dangerous, Republicans 
will stand up for the right course.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to address 
what I believe is an urgent and funda-
mental issue of our policy in Afghani-
stan, and that is, what happens to the 
women and girls when the United 
States and NATO forces leave after 20 
years? 
Over the years, as I have talked to 
my constituents and people around the 
country, one of the things they have 
all been united on about our effort in 
Afghanistan has been the difference 
that our intervention has made for 
women and girls. 
Before we went into Afghanistan in 
2002, girls were not allowed to go to 
school, women were not allowed to 
work, and there was no freedom of 
movement for women and girls unless 
they had a male escort. They couldn’t 
listen to music. They were required to 
wear burqas anytime they went out of 
their homes. 
What we have seen has been safety 
and security for Afghan women and 
girls as the result of our intervention, 
but now all of these gains are at risk as 
we withdraw our forces. The lack of 
emphasis on the safety and security of 
Afghan women and girls in the peace 
process is what has brought us to this 
point. 
We are leaving by September, and 
there is no plan to ensure that the 
rights that were achieved for women 
and girls are actually protected, even 
though we have legislation that says 
that in conflict areas like Afghanistan, 
we have a responsibility to ensure that 
women are at the negotiating table. 
Well, as we rethink the role of the 
United States in Afghanistan, I want to 
put a face on what we are talking 
about, what it means if we don’t 
prioritize women’s rights there. 
In March of this year, the State De-
partment posthumously honored seven 
women who were given the Inter-
national Women of Courage Award. 
These are all women who were killed in 
Afghanistan in 2020. They are pictured 
here. 
They 
were 
murdered—assas-
sinated, really—for choosing to live 
their lives outside of the narrow con-
fines of what the Taliban and other ex-
tremist groups deem acceptable for 
women, and they reflect the thousands 
of other women in Afghanistan who 
have been the targets of violence. 
We have seen over the last months of 
2020 and beginning of 2021 that women 
were deliberately targeted for assas-
sination, particularly women in high- 
profile positions. These women have 
been murdered for going to school, for 
reporting 
the 
news, 
for 
delivering 
healthcare or running for public office. 
We talk about them as courageous, and 
certainly they are, but they should not 
have to be courageous to do the kinds 
of things that they were murdered for. 
It should not require courage to be a 
journalist like Malalai Maiwand, who

is right here in the lower left-hand cor-
ner. It should not require courage to 
stand up for basic human rights like 
Fatima Khalil, who is up here in the 
middle, or Freshta Kohistani, who is 
right here. Fatima was a human rights 
official. Freshta was an activist for 
women rights. Yet both of these women 
were killed by the Taliban for doing 
what they believed in, for trying to im-
prove the lives of other women. Sadly, 
that kind of courage is what is required 
of all women in Afghanistan today. 
I worry that this reality is only going 
to escalate after our departure. Indeed, 
we saw this over this past weekend 
when 85 people, most of them school-
girls, were killed in a car bomb outside 
of a girls school in Kabul. 
I saw them interviewing one young 
woman who, I think, was about 14, 
about why she thought they had been 
targeted. She said: ‘‘I guess it’s because 
we want an education.’’ This is the fu-
ture we risk if we don’t have a plan for 
how we are going to continue to sup-
port the women and girls of Afghani-
stan. 
I also want to talk about the other 
four women who are pictured here. 
Fatima Rajabi, who is in the middle, 
was a 23-year-old prison guard. She was 
on her way home from work and was on 
a civilian bus when the bus was stopped 
by the Taliban. She was kidnapped, 
tortured, and murdered, and 2 weeks 
later, her body was sent to her family. 
Then there is Freshta, who is the 
daughter of Amir Mohamed. She was a 
35-year-old prison guard who was killed 
on her way to a taxi to get to work— 
again, killed by a gunman. 
At the bottom is General Sharmila 
Frogh. General Frogh was the head of 
the gender unit in the National Direc-
torate of Security and was one of the 
longest serving female NDS officers in 
Afghanistan. 
She 
was 
assassinated 
when an IED explosion targeted her ve-
hicle in Kabul. 
Finally, I think the most horrific and 
barbarous of all of these murders was 
of Maryam Noorzad. Maryam was a 
midwife, and she was killed when the 
hospital in Kabul was attacked by the 
Taliban. She was there, helping a 
woman deliver a baby, and she refused 
to leave when they were attacked. She 
didn’t want to leave the woman she 
was helping as a midwife, so the 
Taliban not only killed her when she 
refused to leave the woman, but they 
killed the mother, and they killed the 
baby. These are the Taliban whom we 
are being asked to join at the negoti-
ating table. 
I can tell you that I don’t intend to 
support any political efforts that will 
allow the Taliban to continue to com-
mit these horrific acts of violence. The 
agreement we made with the Taliban 
has already been breached by the 
Taliban. They have refused to cut ties 
with 
al-Qaida 
and 
other 
terrorist 
groups. They continue to escalate the 
violence. 
What we are going to see over the 
next several months and what we do is 
going to impact the lives of women for 
generations to come in that country, 
which is why we must do absolutely ev-
erything in our power to support the 
women and those in Afghanistan who 
want peace and who want to see the 
country move beyond the extreme reli-
gious rhetoric of the Taliban. 
These seven women didn’t deserve to 
die, and those schoolgirls in Kabul 
didn’t deserve to die. We owe it to 
them and to the generations who will 
come after them to do everything we 
can to prevent any more Afghan 
women from meeting the same fate. 
This is not a partisan issue, and it is 
not a woman’s issue. It is a human 
rights issue, and it is a security issue 
for the future of Afghanistan because, 
if women are empowered in that coun-
try, the potential for stability is so 
much greater. So I urge the Senate to 
do everything in our power to ensure 
that women are represented at the 
table in the future of negotiations and 
that their rights are preserved in Af-
ghanistan. 
We 
must 
remember 
these 
seven 
women and the thousands of women 
like 
them 
and 
the 
schoolgirls 
in 
Kabul—the girls who should have the 
opportunity to grow up in a world with 
the freedoms that their mothers fought 
to secure. The women and girls of Af-
ghanistan are watching what we do, 
and we can’t afford to let them down. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
SHAHEEN). Without objection, it is so

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask

complete my remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, on 
Tuesday, the Senate Rules Committee 
conducted its markup of S. 1, which is 
the Senate’s version of the Democrats’ 
election bill that is designed to in-
crease the Democrats’ chances of main-
taining their currently tenuous hold on 
power. 
We are told that passing this bill is 
urgent. We were told that in the last 
Congress, too, when the Democrats 
first proposed this legislation. They 
said the same thing—that there were 
serious election problems and that we 
needed to pass this legislation to ad-
dress them. 
Then, of course, we had the 2020 elec-
tions, which the Democrats won and 
which featured record voter turnout. In 
fact, it was the largest voter turnout 
since 1900. So it became just a little 
difficult for the Democrats to argue 
that there were grave problems with 
our electoral system. Yet they still 
really, really want to pass this bill—a 
bill that contains what one respected 
legal scholar has called ‘‘some of the 
most blatantly partisan, most obvi-
ously unconstitutional, and most un-
wise provisions ever passed by a cham-
ber of Congress.’’ So they have had to 
come up with a new rationale for try-
ing to jam through this legislation. 
Now we are being warned about a new 
crisis: States, which under the Con-
stitution, historically, have had pri-
mary responsibility when it comes to 
elections, are debating election admin-
istration measures that will return our 
Nation to the Jim Crow era, and so we 
have to pass S. 1 to prevent the damage 
these States are going to do. The only 
thing, of course, is that this crisis is as 
manufactured as the last one. 
Take Georgia, the Democrats have 
made Georgia a poster child for the 
need to pass election legislation. 
‘‘Georgia’s new voting law,’’ the Sen-
ate Democratic whip asserted, ‘‘is a de-
liberate effort to suppress voters, par-
ticularly voters of color.’’ 
The President feverishly described 
the Georgia law as ‘‘Jim Crow on 
steroids.’’ 
The only problem with that argu-
ment is ‘‘the law does not put up road-
blocks to Black Americans registering 
to vote.’’ 
Those aren’t my words. Those are the 
words of The Washington Post Fact 
Checker, but the Democrats haven’t al-
lowed facts or reason to intrude when 
it comes to their characterizations of 
Georgia’s election law. 
The Democratic whip has come down 
to the floor and claimed that the Geor-
gia law makes it a crime to give water 
to voters in line. In fact, while the law 
does place restrictions on activists’ and 
candidates’ handing out water and 
other items—an obvious conflict—it ex-
plicitly permits neutral election offi-
cials to offer voters water. 
The President has repeatedly claimed 
that the law is designed to keep work-
ing Americans from voting, except it is 
not. The Washington Post, as I men-
tioned, 
gave 
the 
President 
four 
Pinocchios, a rating that the Wash-
ington Post reserves for ‘‘whoppers’’ 
for that claim by the President of the 
United States. 
In fact, as the Washington Post Fact 
Checker’s piece makes clear, there is 
reason to think that the law might ac-
tually—wait for it—expand access to 
early voting. A fairminded piece in the 
New York Times—hardly a newspaper 
that carries water for Republicans— 
concluded that the voting provisions of 
the Georgia law are ‘‘unlikely to sig-
nificantly affect turnout or Demo-
cratic chances.’’ 
Georgia’s voting laws are actually, in 
some ways, more permissive than vot-
ing 
laws 
in 
some 
Democratic-led 
States. Georgia allows more early vot-
ing than both the President and the 
Democratic leaders’ home States, Dela-
ware and New York. Unlike Georgia, 
neither Delaware nor New York offers 
any no-excuse absentee voting. I look 
forward to seeing the President and the

May 13, 2021 
Democratic leader talk about how 
their home States are promoting voter 
suppression. 
The fact of the matter is, Georgia’s 
new election law is squarely in the 
mainstream when it comes to State 
election laws. The Georgia bill would 
likely have been barely a blip in the 
news cycle if the Democrats had not 
seen an opportunity to distort this bill 
to advance their electoral agenda. Yet 
I want to talk about the actual sub-
stance of the Democrats’ bill and why 
every Member of Congress should be 
opposing it. 
We are supposed to believe that this 
is an election integrity bill. In fact, it 
is the complete opposite. This bill 
would undermine election integrity in 
this country. It would do everything 
from making our election system more 
susceptible to fraud to undermining 
voter faith in our electoral system by 
politicizing election law. 
Let me just highlight a handful of 
the bill’s worst provisions. Note that 
multiple amendments to address these 
concerns were voted down by the 
Democrats at Tuesday’s markup, which 
says a lot about the partisan nature of 
the Democrats’ aims with this bill. 
First, this bill would make the Fed-
eral Election Commission into a par-
tisan body. Let me just repeat that. 
This bill would make the Federal Elec-
tion 
Commission—the 
primary 
en-
forcer of election law in this country— 
into a partisan body. Instead of an 
independent Commission, evenly di-
vided between Democrats and Repub-
licans, which is what it is today, the 
FEC would become just a partisan arm 
of whichever President is in power. 
Tell me how that is supposed to en-
hance voter confidence in our system. 
Every single FEC ruling would be sus-
pect. No Democrat voter would trust a 
Republican FEC, and no Republican 
voter would trust a Democrat one. 
Speaking of trust, let’s talk about 
election fraud. 
The bill takes aim at State voter ID 
laws, which are commonsense meas-
ures—strongly supported by the Amer-
ican people—to ensure that voters are 
who they say they are before they vote. 
The Pew Research Center reports that 
76 percent of Americans, including 61 
percent of Democrats, support voter ID 
requirements. 
Now, I have always been at a loss to 
understand the congressional Demo-
crats’ passionate opposition to requir-
ing people to provide identification be-
fore voting. I haven’t heard the Demo-
crats spend a lot of time complaining 
about requiring people to have a photo 
ID to drive or to fly or to go on a tour 
at the White House, but, somehow, ask-
ing people to provide an ID to vote is 
beyond the pale. 
Great Britain is actually planning to 
implement a voter ID requirement to 
prevent—you 
guessed 
it—electoral 
fraud. In fact, many European coun-
tries, including France, the Nether-
lands, and Sweden, require a form of 
identification to vote. Canada requires 
a form of identification to vote. It is 
difficult to understand the Democrats’ 
fierce opposition to this commonsense 
fraud prevention measure. 
While we are on the subject of elec-
toral fraud, let’s talk about ballot har-
vesting. 
In addition to effectively eliminating 
States’ voter ID requirements, S. 1 
would also require that States allow 
ballot harvesting, the controversial 
practice 
of 
allowing 
political 
operatives to collect and submit bal-
lots. Needless to say, ballot harvesting 
opens up a lot of questions about voter 
fraud and election integrity, and that 
is to put it mildly. Yet the Democrats’ 
bill would not just permit States to 
allow it; it would require them—re-
quire them—to allow it. I could go on 
and on and on. 
S. 1 would allow the unprecedented 
regulation of political speech and issue 
advocacy. It would impose disclosure 
requirements for organizations, which 
would open up donors to retaliation 
and intimidation. It would spend tax-
payer dollars—possibly tens of millions 
of taxpayer dollars per candidate—on 
the public financing of political cam-
paigns. 
That is right. With a soaring na-
tional debt and priorities like infra-
structure to fund, the Federal Govern-
ment would end up steering hundreds 
of millions of dollars to political cam-
paigns. Perhaps the best illustration of 
that is Senator CRUZ, here in the U.S. 
Senate, who pointed out that in the 
first quarter of this year under this 
law, the Federal Government would 
have had to cut him a check for $30 
million for his campaign. 
This legislation is not about voter in-
tegrity. It is not about preventing 
voter suppression. It is about perma-
nently changing the electoral playing 
field to give Democrats a permanent 
electoral advantage. 
It is the same reason Democrats 
want to pack the Supreme Court or 
admit DC as a State. Democrats want 
to use whatever political power they 
have to secure a permanent advantage 
for Democrat candidates and Democrat 
policies. 
If Democrats were serious about pro-
tecting the integrity of our election 
system, they would be working with 
Republicans to develop bipartisan leg-
islation, not pushing a bill that is un-
likely to get a single Republican vote. 
Passing a huge Federal election re-
form measure on a partisan basis would 
completely undermine one of the main 
purposes of election reform legislation, 
which is enhancing confidence in the 
integrity of our system. 
I can assure Democrats that S. 1 
would do nothing to enhance Repub-
lican voters’ confidence in the integ-
rity of elections. I suspect there are a 
number of Democrat voters and Inde-
pendent voters who will also see this 
bill for what it is—a partisan takeover 
of our electoral system. 
We are fortunate that our electoral 
system by and large seems to be oper-
ating well. As I mentioned, see the 
record turnout of voters in the 2020 
election. It was the highest turnout 
since 1900. 
But there are certainly measures we 
can take up to further enhance election 
integrity—not S. 1, which would do 
nothing to further election integrity, 
but there are other measures we could 
take up. But in order to have any de-
gree of legitimacy, any election reform 
measures we consider should be taken 
up on a bipartisan basis, and if Demo-
crats really wanted to enhance voter 
confidence and protect the integrity of 
our system, that is what they would be

ECONOMY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor to talk about the 
economy, what is going on, on the jobs 
front, and where we go from here. 
Last week, the Department of Labor 
issued its most recent jobs report. It 
showed that we added 266,000 jobs in 
April. That was about one quarter of 
what 
was 
predicted. 
It 
was 
dis-
appointing. It shows that the job 
growth coming out of the pandemic has 
now slowed. There is a question as to 
why, since there are so many jobs out 
there. How is it that there can be so 
many jobs available, and yet we have 
such a disappointing April jobs report? 
The demand for workers is certainly 
high. 
The other thing going on out there is 
that we have creeping inflation. We 
learned this past week that the Con-
sumer Price Index rose 4.2 percent be-
tween April 2020 and April 2021. So the 
year, April to April, is the highest 12- 
month increase going back to the sum-
mer of 2008. 
There is this whole debate going on 
about whether there is inflation or not. 
Well, I would ask you to talk to your 
constituents because they will tell you 
there is inflation. There is inflation at 
the gas pump; there is inflation at the 
grocery store; there is inflation if you 
are trying to build something. There is 
inflation 
throughout 
the 
economy 
right now, and that should concern 
every American. It is because of policy 
choices, but it doesn’t have to be this 
way. 
What this argument boils down to 
with regard to jobs and with regard to 
inflation are really two very different 
approaches and philosophies of govern-
ment and how to create jobs, how to in-
crease wages, and how to help working 
families. 
The Biden administration believes 
the government needs to spend more to 
prime the pump. This is despite our 
being told by every economic analysis, 
including our own nonpartisan Con-
gressional Budget Office, that without 
any new stimulus at the beginning of 
this year, we were going to see the 
economy come back strongly. In fact, 
all of the studies showed that the rate 
of growth this year was going to be 4 
percent or more without any stimulus, 
without any new spending, and that, by

May 13, 2021 
midyear, according to the Congres-
sional Budget Office, we would be back 
to the prepandemic economy and eco-
nomic growth. Yet the Biden adminis-
tration is insisting on priming the 
pump, putting more money out there. 
The $1.9 trillion spending package was 
all about that. 
Some of us raised concerns about it 
and warned people about this. By the 
way, one of us who did this was Larry 
Summers, who was the Secretary of 
the Treasury under a Democratic ad-
ministration and who is a prominent 
economist on the other side of the 
aisle. He said this—and he was right— 
that this risked overheating an econ-
omy that was already growing and 
would result in inflation. Unfortu-
nately, the massive stimulus seems to 
have exactly done that. 
Unfortunately, now there is another 
wave of spending that is being pro-
jected. Over $4 trillion is being pro-
posed in new spending in addition to 
the $1.9 trillion, two new packages the 
President talked about in his address 
to Congress last month. It is inter-
esting because, even though inflation is 
going up and even though the jobs mar-
ket is disappointing, it seems like the 
administration isn’t changing course. 
One thing the administration is not 
changing course on is that it wants to 
continue to pay people a substantial 
amount not to work. Now, in my view, 
during the COVID–19 crisis—at the 
heat of it—we needed to do something 
to help people who had lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own, and the 
States’ unemployment systems were 
the places to do that. So we added a 
Federal supplement on top of the State 
unemployment benefit. 
In Ohio, the State pays about $360 a 
week, on average, which is about half 
of whatever your salary was or your in-
come was, and we added $300 on top of 
that. Think about that. Instead of $360, 
it is $660 per week, on average. That 
means that, for 42 percent of the people 
who are on unemployment insurance— 
this is a national figure—they are mak-
ing more on unemployment than they 
were at work. So a lot of people have 
made the logical decision and say: Why 
should I be going back to work? 
Unfortunately, when the President 
has been asked about this, he has said: 
I know there’s been a lot of discussion . . . 
that people are being paid to stay home rath-
er than going to work. Well, we don’t see 
much evidence of that. 
With all due respect, I hope the 
President will talk to some of the busi-
ness owners who I am talking to, par-
ticularly small businesses. The num-
bers tell a different story. 
According to the most recent Labor 
Department data released just this 
week, at the end of March, we had 8.1 
million job openings in America. That 
was 8.1 million jobs open. We all know 
that because we are back in our States, 
as we will be later today or tomorrow, 
and we will see the ‘‘help wanted’’ 
signs. By the way, that is the highest 
number in history. We have never had 
8 million jobs open in America. 
Based on this Labor Department 
study, the job increases were broadly 
distributed, 185,000 new job openings in 
restaurants and hospitality—as they 
are getting going, many of these res-
taurants are saying: This is great. We 
have the people coming back, but we 
can’t find workers. There are 155,000 in 
State and local education and 81,000 in 
entertainment. 
With that demand for workers and 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic 
substan-
tially 
improving, 
the 
employment 
numbers should be skyrocketing. We 
should be seeing so many people going 
back to work. This is an opportunity 
for people to go back, to get into their 
careers, and get back to the dignity 
and self-respect that comes from work 
and the fulfillment that comes from 
work, but it is not happening. If you 
ask business owners in my home State 
of Ohio and across the country, they 
will all tell you the same story: Busi-
ness is booming, but we can’t find 
workers. 
One Ohio restaurant manager said in 
an interview, ‘‘It’s crazy. Honestly, we 
are 
busier 
than 
we 
were 
before 
COVID,’’ but they can’t find staff to 
keep up with the demand. The Dayton, 
OH, area chamber of commerce did a 
study very recently, and 78 percent of 
its members said they can’t find the 
workers they need to fill the job open-
ings they have—78 percent. 
So why is this happening? I think 
there are a few reasons. 
One is that it is true that we still 
have a skills gap in our country, and 
that is something I have been working 
on, along with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle. It is the reason I au-
thored what is called the JOBS Act. It 
was to make sure that we have this 
connection—not have a skills gap but, 
instead, have the right skills being 
taught to match the work needs that 
we have. 
Honestly, with regard to those num-
bers that I just talked about with re-
gard to entertainment jobs and res-
taurant jobs and State and local edu-
cation jobs, most of those jobs do not 
require a specialized skill. So the skills 
gap needs to be addressed, particularly 
in manufacturing, where I was told 
today, by the National Association of 
Manufacturers, that there are 700,000 
manufacturing jobs open right now. 
Again, many of the jobs that are open 
do not require advanced skills. They 
just require you to show up and to be 
willing to do the work. 
It is also understandable to me that 
some people may be hesitant to go 
back to work because of COVID, but we 
now have these three effective vaccines 
that are doing the hard work to try to 
get us back to a more normal lifestyle, 
where we can get back to school and 
back to church and back to synagogue 
and back to work. Our Nation’s re-
searchers and scientists have helped us 
to get to this point, and as we saw from 
the CDC recommendation today re-
garding masks, we are turning the cor-
ner. 
I also realize, for some 
people, 
childcare is an issue—there is no ques-
tion about that—the cost of childcare. 
If you look at the numbers in terms of 
people going back to work, it is true 
that it is disproportionately women. I 
agree that this is an issue, but I will 
tell you that one of the issues we hear 
about, as you dig deeper into this, is 
that it is because, in many places, the 
kids are not back to school. So that is 
a solvable problem. It is time for our 
children to go back to school again. 
Follow the CDC. Follow the science. 
There were 54 percent of K–8 public 
schools that were offering full-time 
classroom teaching in March. The rest 
were not. 
I have to tell you that none of these 
are the main causes of the current 
problem from everything I am hearing. 
There are jobs, and there are folks 
qualified to do them. They just aren’t 
looking for work, and it is because of 
the way the government has chosen to 
pay people not to work. 
Wages are up, by the way. So, for 
those who say, ‘‘Well, employers need 
to raise wages,’’ they are up. By the 
way, that is one reason we have infla-
tion. It is because wages are going up. 
Wages going up, I think, is not a bad 
thing even though it will count for 
some of this inflation that we have, but 
the wages going up is not going to 
make the difference here. Even though 
wages have gone up on an average of 4, 
5 percent, people are still not coming 
to work the way you would expect. 
Jimmy John’s is offering hiring bo-
nuses. The McDonald’s locally, where I 
live in Cincinnati, is offering a $500 
signing bonus. Chipotle is offering free 
college tuition after 4 months on the 
job. One wholesale distributor in Ohio 
is offering a $9,000 sign-on bonus for 
certified truck drivers. 
By the way, with regard to truck 
drivers, you know about the Colonial 
Pipeline and cutting off the gas supply 
to the east coast of the United States 
and people who are concerned about 
going to the gas station and getting 
gas in many gas stations and not hav-
ing any fuel available, including in 
States all over the East and the South-
east. 
The answer that some people came 
up with—and it makes sense—is to 
have trucks actually deliver that fuel 
to those gas stations. The trucks could 
go to the places where the fuel is and 
where the pipeline would normally 
take it and move that fuel to the gas 
stations. The problem? No truck driv-
ers. They literally cannot find truck 
drivers to move this fuel from the de-
pots to the gas stations. This is a real 
problem. 
I have a constituent back home who 
contacted me yesterday. She is offering 
a $1,000 signing bonus, and she can get 
nobody to step forward. She has 60 jobs 
in Ohio, and she has 30 jobs in New 
York—a 
small 
business 
with 
only 
about 250 jobs total. She can’t find any-
body. When she talks to her people, 
they tell her: Well, as soon as the UI

ends, I will be back. As soon as the un-
employment insurance ends—the Fed-
eral supplement, the $300 supplement— 
I will be back. Businesses simply can’t 
compete in an environment where more 
than 40 percent of the workers are 
making more on the unemployment 
supplement than they would be at their 
jobs. 
It is a problem, by the way, that 
States themselves are now starting to 
deal with because they realize this is a 
huge problem for their economies, for 
their small businesses, and for their 
workforces. As of this afternoon, just 
in the last week, 15 States have said: 
Do you know what? I am not going to 
accept the $300 supplement because I 
want to get people back to work. 
It is already making a difference. 
Someone just told me from the State of 
Montana—one of our colleagues from 
there—and Montana was the first State 
to do this—that, about a week ago, a 
hotel owner told him that he was in 
desperate need of people, and when he 
would put the ‘‘help wanted’’ sign out 
and ask people to come, he could get 
one person to show up per week. This 
week, 60 people showed up. Why? Be-
cause the unemployment insurance is 
running out, and people are now look-
ing for work. So these States I think 
are going to continue to do this. I 
think it will be more than 15 by the 
time we are finished speaking here this 
afternoon. It is because the States real-
ize, well, this is a competitive advan-
tage. If New York doesn’t do it and 
Ohio does—and by the way, Ohio is one 
of the States that just made the deci-
sion to do it this afternoon. If New 
York doesn’t do it, that businessperson 
I talked about is going to do more 
manufacturing in Ohio because that is 
where she has the workforce. That will 
help Ohio relative to States that 
wouldn’t choose to move on beyond the 
$300 supplement. 
Unemployment insurance is impor-
tant, and it is still going to be there, 
but it will be the State benefit that it 
has always been. 
The other thing is the work require-
ment. 
In 
unemployment insurance, 
again, in Ohio, it is about 50 percent of 
whatever your wages are. And then 
there is a requirement that you look 
for work, and if you get an offer, you 
can’t stay on unemployment insurance. 
That has always been the tradition. 
Under COVID, States accepted waiv-
ers not to have to require people to 
look for work. About 30 States now just 
in the last few weeks have decided to 
get rid of that waiver, including Ohio. 
Why? Because again, it is not helping 
anybody. It is not helping the workers; 
it is not helping the small businesses, 
certainly; and it is really not helping 
the taxpayers who are paying tens of 
billions of dollars for these supple-
ments. 
I will say, when I debated this on the 
Senate floor, when we had an amend-
ment that actually passed during the 
COVID–19 
legislation—later, 
that 
amendment was amended, but we tried 
to end the unemployment insurance 
sooner given the economic numbers 
that were out there. 
One of the Democratic colleagues on 
the other side said that—do I think the 
Ohio workers somehow don’t have a 
work ethic, that they are lazy? That is 
not what I think at all. I don’t think 
they are lazy at all. I think they are 
logical. Common sense dictates that 
when you are offering to pay somebody 
more not to work than to work, you 
are likely to get a bad result. Again, it 
was needed when people were losing 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own. COVID–19 devastated—ravaged— 
so many sectors of our economy. 
A lot of those sectors are coming 
back and are coming back strong, but 
they need workers, and they need them 
desperately. The stakes couldn’t be 
higher. 
Let me illustrate why. If workers 
don’t go back to work, some businesses 
will actually close, and these jobs will 
go away permanently. That, to me, is a 
reality. 
Take Geordie’s Restaurant in Colum-
bus, OH. Geordie’s shut down a couple 
of weeks ago because they couldn’t find 
enough job applicants to keep the 
lights on, period. They shut down. This 
is a restaurant that made it through 
the worst of the pandemic, when our 
restaurant and hospitality industry 
was in really tough shape. But as 
owner Geordie Hull-Jones said himself, 
‘‘We 
fought 
hard 
to 
get 
through 
COVID, but COVID didn’t kill us, the 
stimulus did.’’ 
‘‘[B]ut COVID didn’t kill us, the 
stimulus did.’’ That is a quote from a 
business owner. 
That is the difference, again, between 
the philosophy that the Biden adminis-
tration seems to be taking and, frank-
ly, the reality and the philosophy that 
we are encouraging, which is let’s get 
people back to work; let’s get this 
economy moving again. 
The President is committed to spend-
ing an unprecedented amount of tax 
dollars to try and get what it takes to 
get the economy back on track. But 
spending more tax dollars isn’t a pre-
scription for what ails our economy 
today. Getting people back to work 
certainly is. If we don’t, again, busi-
nesses will close; careers cannot be 
continued. People won’t get the fulfill-
ment that they get from going to work, 
and many of these jobs will not return. 
Instead of following this path, let’s 
change course. Let’s follow common 
sense and get our country back to work 
so we can all enjoy the goods and serv-
ices we work to provide for each other. 
Let’s help our Nation’s small busi-
nesses, which are the lifeblood of so 
many in our economy. Let’s help peo-
ple currently on unemployment get 
started building lasting careers that 
they enjoy, make a living, find long- 
term stability, so they can realize their 
American dream. That is what this 
country is all about. 
So, today, I am urging the Biden ad-
ministration to take two simple steps 
to encourage people to move past the 
pandemic and to get back to work. 
First, we need to reimplement the Fed-
eral requirement that people must be 
actively searching for work if they are 
going to receive unemployment. Again, 
Ohio has made that decision, as have 
about 30 other States, but let’s make 
this the national standard that it was 
prior to the pandemic. Long-term un-
employment doesn’t benefit anyone, 
and it will ensure that people are able 
to get off unemployment insurance 
more quickly. Second, we need to draw 
down the Federal unemployment sup-
plement funded by COVID–19 that 
passed in March. It is time to look at 
ending this not on September 6, as it is 
currently slated to end, but now, while 
the economy is strong and growing and 
we are trying to get people back to 
work. As I said, it is a rational eco-
nomic decision for many people right 
now who collect an unemployment 
check that effectively pays upward of 
$15 an hour to stay at home and not 
work, but it makes no sense to keep 
the supplement in place as we are re-
opening, and the focus is on shifting to-
ward getting the economy back up and 
running. 
My own preference is that some of 
this might be used to pay people a 
bonus to go back to work. I know that 
is controversial on my side of the aisle, 
but, I tell you, I think it works. Mon-
tana is doing it, and it is working for 
them. How about 100 bucks a week? In-
stead of the $300 supplement, 100 bucks 
a week for 6 weeks as a return-to-work 
bonus? To me, that makes a lot of 
sense. That would be something I think 
we could get some bipartisan support 
for around here, and that would help 
the workers, the small businesses, and 
our economy. 
Through these two steps, we can cre-
ate the disincentive to work that was a 
byproduct of our response to an un-
precedented pandemic—we can stop 
that disincentive to work. Now that we 
are beating COVID–19, we should focus 
on getting back to normal. I urge the 
Biden administration to focus on get-
ting the economy back up and running 
and getting folks off the sidelines and 
back to work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma is recognized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
want to be able to comment on my col-
league, Senator PORTMAN, and some of 
the comments he has made about un-
employment. 
My State is not one of those States 
yet that has made the decision to be 
able to end the additional unemploy-
ment benefits that are coming from the 
Federal Government, and it is harming 
workers and it is harming jobs and it is 
harming businesses in my State. And I 
hope in the days ahead, my State will 
be one of those States to be able to 
step up and will say—and I believe my 
Governor will—to be able to step up 
and say: Let’s actually make sure we 
are benefiting families long-term.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2507 
May 13, 2021 
There is a whole group of folks who 
believe that if you only give people 
enough money, that is going to help 
them rise out of poverty. People need a 
job. People need a purpose. People need 
a plan to be able to do that. Folks 
don’t need long-term Government ben-
efits to be able to help sustain that. 
They need a way to be able to help earn 
a living to be able to pass it on to their 
family to set a job record for them and 
to set a path for their kids and 
grandkids after them. That helps peo-
ple rise—every study we have seen on 
how to help people rise out of poverty, 
graduate high school, wait till after 
marriage to have kids, and have a job 
of any type. Let’s help people rise. 
Let’s help people be employed and en-
gaged. That is a helpful thing. 
I think about some of the things that 
are happening even today. Secretary 
Mayorkas was in front of our com-
mittee today, and it was shocking to 
me to hear the Secretary of Homeland 
Security talk about how much more ef-
ficient they have become at processing 
people at the border and getting them 
into the country. 
It used to be our evaluation for how 
we were managing Border Patrol and 
Customs and Border Protection was 
how many people we were stopping at 
the border and returning to their home 
country. He, literally, over and over 
again, articulated how much faster 
they are now at processing people at 
the border and releasing them into the 
country. Even at one point when I 
challenged him and said: I understand 
people are being released into the 
country without even a notice to ap-
pear; that they are just being released 
into the country and told to go to a 
place somewhere in the country, self- 
report themselves to an ICE office and 
say: I would like to get a court order to 
be able to have a notice to appear. 
At that point, I said: How many peo-
ple have been treated that way? 
He said: I am not sure. 
Well, I have already looked up the 
record on it. It is 19,000 just in the past 
couple of months who have been 
brought across the border, released 
into the country, and told just self-re-
port yourself to whatever ICE agent 
you see somewhere in the country. 
I asked the simple question: How 
many people have already done that? 
Not only could he not answer the 
number 19,000, which we have con-
firmed, but he didn’t know how many 
people had actually turned themselves 
in and actually done it. But we con-
tinue to do this. It was all about speed 
of moving people who are crossing the 
border into the country rather than ac-
tually managing our border. And even 
something as simple as just the gaps in 
the fence, they are still, as he said to 
me, ‘‘studying’’ whether they are going 
to close the gaps in the fence. 
We have a gas pipeline that has gone 
down due to a ransomware attack. It 
reminded me, again, of how important 
gas pipelines are all over our Nation, 
and it is interesting to me that on day 
one, one of the first things that Presi-
dent Biden did was he stepped in and 
ended the Keystone Pipeline moving 
through here and is now actively work-
ing to be able to shut down all pipeline 
construction around the country. 
Can I remind Americans, especially 
Americans on the East Coast, what it 
means to lose a pipeline? 
When the President says we are not 
going to do more pipelines, that means 
we have no redundancy; that if a pipe-
line goes down, there is not an addi-
tional backup one in construction to be 
able to get there. It is better to have 
multiple pipelines in the area so that if 
one goes down, you still have other fuel 
supplies. 
What if this pipeline had actually 
been a larger scale issue even than a 
ransomware attack, as bad as that is? 
This whole fight that we are having 
about pipelines suddenly makes sense 
to a whole lot of folks on the East 
Coast who can’t get gasoline. Pipelines 
are not evil. Pipelines are moving en-
ergy across the country, and it is the 
least expensive, safest way to be able 
to move that energy across the coun-
try. 
This week, of all weeks, has been in-
teresting to have a dialogue about S. 1. 
It was a long markup in the Rules 
Committee to be able to talk about 
voting in America. 
Now, I was at the White House sev-
eral years ago when the FIRST STEP 
Act was signed. It was a remarkable 
bill dealing with criminal justice re-
form. As I was at the White House sign-
ing ceremony and the gathering of all 
these different folks that had been en-
gaged, it was interesting to me to 
stand in that room with President 
Trump and to have folks from the Her-
itage Foundation and folks from the 
ACLU in the same room shaking hands 
and smiling and saying that this is a 
good piece of legislation. In fact, it is 
the only time that I can remember sit-
ting at a signing ceremony watching 
people from two different perspectives 
saying they both support something so 
strongly. That was the FIRST STEP 
Act. 
I have now seen my second time that 
that has occurred, when both the Herit-
age Foundation and the ACLU both op-
pose S. 1 and H.R. 1. They have both 
come out in opposition to it. 
Well, that is an interesting gathering 
of folks to be able to gather together 
from both political extremes to be able 
to look at a piece of legislation—all 880 
pages of it—and to say: That is a bad 
idea. Why would they say that? 
Well, let me count the ways of why 
they would say that. 
In my State in Oklahoma, we have 
great voting engagement. Good. We 
want to make it easy to vote. We want 
to make it hard to cheat. We want as 
many people as possible to be able to 
vote and as many people as possible to 
be able to engage in the process. It is 
the nature of a Republic like ours. You 
need people to be able to be engaged. 
But we also want to be able to follow 
up on that process as well, to be able to 
make sure that if somebody is actually 
breaking the rules on that, we follow 
up. And in our State, we do. 
Recently, I followed up with our 
State leadership for voting to be able 
to find out what happened in our last 
election and what are we doing. We 
found 57 people as a State that voted 
twice in my State. All 57 of those 
names were turned over to local dis-
trict attorneys, and they will start fol-
lowing up with those individuals be-
cause that is a violation of the law to 
be able to vote twice in our State. 
Fifty-seven names is not very many, 
but it is because we continue to enforce 
the law in our State to be able to make 
sure that we have as many people vot-
ing as possible but also accountability 
for people who want to be able to cheat 
in the system. 
The interesting thing about S. 1 and 
H.R. 1 is that they make it much easier 
to cheat in the process. They set up a 
different system where you can actu-
ally have no voter ID. And it is not just 
no voter ID; it is no voter ID and same- 
day registration combined. So you can 
literally walk into a polling place that 
you are not registered for, not show an 
ID, and say ‘‘I am not registered. I 
would like to vote’’ and not show an ID 
and also vote that same day in that 
spot. There is no way to be able to 
verify, then, one way or the other if 
this person is voting twice because no 
one knows. 
In my State that has great voter ID 
laws, it would gut them, and it would 
take it away from our State, though no 
one is complaining about voter ID in 
my State. You can show an ID. You can 
show a library card. You can show a 
utility bill. You can show anything in 
my State just to be able to verify that 
is actually you because we want people 
to be able to vote, but we want to 
make sure it is that person who is ac-
tually voting. That used to be a com-
mon, accepted practice. 
Why would we want to create an en-
vironment where we would make it 
easy to be able to cheat? 
This bill, S. 1, also creates ballot har-
vesting—forces it around the entire 
country. Folks may say: I have no idea 
what that is. Well, let me set up what 
it is. Ballots are mailed to your house, 
and if you haven’t mailed it back in 
yet, you may have a knock at your 
door. They come to your door. 
And if they come to the door—it 
would be a political activist from one 
of the campaigns, and they would say: 
Hey, have you filled out your ballot 
yet? I know they got mailed out yes-
terday. Have you turned it back in yet? 
Oh, you haven’t? Grab your ballot in-
side and bring it out on the front 
porch, and I will help you fill it out 
right here on your front porch. And, I 
tell you what I will do. I will also turn 
it in for you. You won’t even have to 
mail it. I will deliver it for you. 
That is ballot harvesting. In most 
States, that is illegal. They want to 
make that legal in every single State. 
That is an invitation to fraud.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2508 
May 13, 2021 
Now, there is a difference between ‘‘I 
want to help facilitate everyone to be 
able to vote and to be able to protect 
their right to vote’’ and actually cre-
ating opportunities for fraud where ev-
eryone doubts every election. That is 
not the right way to go. I want to 
make sure that we all look at an elec-
tion at the end of it and say we can 
trust that. 
One of the ways we can trust it is 
through a Federal Election Commis-
sion that actually is bipartisan. We 
have a Federal Election Commission 
with an even number of Republicans 
and Democrats. They want to change 
that to where it is five members, not 
six, and the last member, who is the tie 
breaker, is someone selected by the 
President who would be ‘‘independent.’’ 
I am sure that is going to work out just 
fine, but that is not going to end up 
being a partisan individual. 
In my State, all the ballots are done 
ahead of time—all of them. If you do a 
mail-in ballot, those ballots are opened 
up early on. There are Republicans and 
Democrats. There are poll watchers 
who are watching it. All of the evalua-
tions for the quality of the ballots are 
all tested before election night. So that 
is all finished. So when election night 
is done, by 10:30 in the evening, all the 
ballots have been counted and election 
results are out. 
Oh, no, that won’t work. My Senate 
Democratic colleagues want to give an 
additional 10 days for ballots to con-
tinue to trickle in. So, literally, what 
we had in this last election where it 
was for days that no one even knew 
how many ballots were coming in, and 
the uncertainty that that creates in 
the process, they want to make sure 
that exists in every State, not just in a 
few States. 
Listen, I would rather have every 
State be like mine, to say that every-
one has to turn their ballot in early. It 
is not like election day is a shocking 
day that no one knew about. In fact, 
the majority of States around the 
country are like my State. 
This is not just a partisan issue. 
Vermont has the same rule that we 
have in Oklahoma. This is a straight-
forward way to protect the integrity of 
the ballot, that you can turn in the 
ballots early, and that you can evalu-
ate all of them so the ballots aren’t 
trickling in for days. 
If you love all those rules, let me 
give you one more quick one. Remem-
ber that campaign speech or that cam-
paign commercial that you really, real-
ly hate, that you are sick of it by the 
time the election comes? Well, get 
ready for a whole lot more of them be-
cause the S. 1 bill gives Federal dollars, 
6 to 1, to be able to fund more cam-
paigns and to make sure campaigns 
have even more money. 
So if someone raises $100,000, they are 
going to give—Federal tax dollars— 
$600,000 to that candidate, even a can-
didate you didn’t vote for and don’t 
like. They are going to get $600,000 for 
every $100,000. If they raise $1 million 
for their campaign, they will get $6 
million of our Federal tax dollars. 
I don’t want to pay for campaigns I 
don’t agree with. I don’t think that is 
the right way to go. And I don’t bump 
into many people in my State that get 
real excited about paying for someone 
else’s campaign whom they disagree 
with. 
I think this bill was the result of the 
2020 election. They pulled it out and 
said: That election was such a sham-
bles. We need to be able to put a bill 
out there to do that. 
But you would be incorrect. Actu-
ally, this bill is exactly what they 
pulled out in 2017, saying that Russia 
took over the election in 2016 and so we 
need a big bill to be able to fix it. And 
for 4 years they have been pushing it 
and, now, after this election, they 
pulled it out again and said: We have to 
be able to do this. 
It is the same bill. It used to be the 
bill to fight Russia. Now it is the bill 
to be able to fight whatever now. 
Listen, let each State make those de-
cisions, and when there is a challenge 
for that, take it to Federal court. That 
is why we have the court system. Allow 
those 
Federal 
courts 
to 
process 
through those challenges. 
We want every person to be able to be 
protected, to be able to vote, and if 
some State is suppressing the vote, 
take that to Federal court, and let’s 
solve that and make sure that does not 
occur. But don’t tell everyone in my 
State that Washington, DC knows bet-
ter. 
We have Republicans and Democrats 
that have worked very hard on election 
law in my State. In fact, there was just 
an expansion of additional days for 
early voting in my State. It has been a 
nonpartisan issue in my State. Let’s 
not make it a partisan issue now and 
tell everyone across the entire country 
that DC knows best. Let’s put this bill 
aside and not pass the S. 1 bill. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
BACK TO WORK BONUS ACT 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
you know, if there is one thing I have 
been hearing from my constituents 
lately it is this: We have to get people 
back to work so our economy can 
thrive and our people can make a liv-
ing. 
This isn’t a new sentiment. I have 
heard this for months as I have trav-
eled around the State. But what is new 
is the fact that we can’t find people to 
work, and that is what I am here to 
talk about today. 
Before the pandemic hit, we had the 
best economy in decades. The unem-
ployment rate in January 2020 was 3.6 
percent. Wages were up. Blue-collar 
wages were rising faster than white- 
collar wages for the first time on 
record. 
Unemployment 
for 
African 
Americans, Hispanic Americans, and 
Asian Americans was at the lowest 
rate recorded, all thanks to President 
Trump’s pro-growth policies and Re-
publicans’ tax reform law. 
There 
is 
no 
debating 
that 
the 
coronavirus pandemic hit our economy 
very, very hard. Many companies and 
businesses in Alabama, including fam-
ily-owned small businesses, have spent 
the past year hanging on by a thread as 
the pandemic held its tight grip around 
the country. 
Some States opened with a skeleton 
crew, making the decision to lay off 
workers in order just to keep oper-
ating, and some were forced to shut 
down entirely. Either way, American 
workers lost out. A few industries were 
spared, and unemployment numbers 
shot sky high. 
But a year later, as vaccines became 
widely available and we better under-
stood what we needed to do to keep 
Americans safe, many job creators 
thought: OK, this is when the tight 
grip loosens, and there is the light at 
the end of the tunnel. 
As more and more people are feeling 
safe—safe to go places they used to go 
and do things—businesses are eager to 
open and respond but, today, even as 
vaccinations go up and cases go down, 
the 
Biden 
administration 
is 
incentivizing people to sit on the side-
lines, instead of encouraging them to 
join the workforce. 
It is the opposite of what the Federal 
Government should be doing: Do the 
right thing now. And it is the opposite 
of what job creators want to do for mil-
lions of American workers. There are 
roughly 8.1 million job openings around 
our country, as we speak, but the 
Democrats would rather discourage 
folks from seizing the opportunity to 
go out and earn a living. That is ex-
actly what the current unemployment 
payments do. 
As part of their partisan stimulus 
bill, Democrats extended the $300 a 
week Federal unemployment benefit, a 
weekly payment, in addition to the 
State benefit that folks already get. 
In Alabama, people could choose to 
receive, with no strings attached, up to 
$678 per week. That comes out to $16.95 
an hour, which is even more than our 
Democrat colleagues’ job-killing $15 
minimum wage proposal just a few 
weeks ago. The result has been disas-
trous for small businesses across my 
State and throughout the country that 
are already ready to hire to meet the 
boom and demand for products and 
services. 
On the national level, here is what 
the National Federation of Independent 
Business reported: ‘‘Unfilled job open-
ings continue to mount, as April is the 
third consecutive month setting a 
record high reading of unfilled job 
openings.’’ 
On record job openings, April job 
numbers released last week weren’t 
much better. The unemployment rate 
went up by 0.1 percent. Economists 
thought we would add 1 million jobs, 
but we only added a quarter of that 
amount. 
Small business owners all across Ala-
bama have been able to reopen, and 
customers are coming back. Now they

need people to fill the jobs to keep the 
doors open. 
Across America, businesses are no 
longer competing against other busi-
nesses. Now they have to compete 
against the government—government 
versus the private sector—and the gov-
ernment is stacking the deck against 
our small businesses and manufactur-
ers. Businesses in Alabama are no ex-
ception to anybody else across the 
country. 
Case in point, Al Cason is the Presi-
dent of Bud’s Best Cookies in Hoover, 
AL. His father Bud owns the company 
and has been in the industry for 65 
years. Normally, they have four pro-
duction lines with two shifts, but be-
cause so many—so many—of their 
would-be workers are staying home, 
they can only run two lines, and they 
are cutting their production in half. We 
can’t get enough to come to work, Al 
wrote me. The government is taking 
away workers from our business, and it 
has been in business for 65 years. 
Wesley 
Averett 
from 
Enterprise 
Health & Rehabilitation Center in En-
terprise, AL, wrote that his long-term 
care facility is ‘‘unable to find the help 
[they] need’’ due to the ‘‘severe nega-
tive impacts stimulus and unemploy-
ment payments are [having] on the 
Alabama workforce.’’ 
And then there is Sandra Walker 
from Lake Haven Assisted Living in 
Luverne, AL, who said: 
Our salaries are competitive, but we can’t 
compete with stay-at-home . . . no strings 
attached hand outs. . . . Business is back 
open but we can’t survive without our work-
ers returning to work. 
These are both health companies, 
mind you, and they are the ones help-
ing some of our most vulnerable citi-
zens. 
And here is what Anita Hilliard in 
Courtland, AL, told me. The company 
she works for employs people in con-
venience stores throughout northwest 
Alabama. She wrote: ‘‘We have had to 
shut down some of our shifts’’ just be-
cause we can’t get enough people to 
work, and sometimes we have to shut 
down completely. 
But here is what really stuck with 
me in her letter. She said: ‘‘I am work-
ing and paying taxes to pay others 
more than I make myself.’’ That is sad. 
This must end or we will lose the 
America that we have grown to know 
and love. 
I couldn’t agree with Anita more. 
America was built by hard workers, 
people like Al, people like Anita, peo-
ple like Wes, Sandra, and millions 
more across the United States. But we 
will never jumpstart our economy if we 
keep going with this bad policy of 
incentivizing people to stay at home 
and sit and not work, rather than take 
employment opportunities when they 
are offered to them. 
Our businesses need workers to meet 
customers’ demands. This is truly a 
great thing after such a hard year. Our 
job creators have started to hope and 
see opportunity again. They have hung 
the ‘‘now hiring’’ signs on the door. 
They have posted the job openings. But 
we need to encourage folks to rejoin 
the workforce and to get back to work. 
Job creators are creating the oppor-
tunity. We just need folks to reach out 
and take it. 
It should be easy for us to offer en-
couragement to folks to fill open oppo-
sitions. All we have to do is kick the 
ball through the uprights this time 
around. But Democrats in DC wanted 
to go it alone. They wanted to go it 
alone a few weeks ago. And with the re-
cent stimulus bill that we passed we 
ended up with a workforce shortage 
due to the inflated unemployment ben-
efits in an economy on the cusp of re-
covery that needs available workers. 
Getting these folks back to work 
isn’t just about the now. It is about 
helping them to see the future again. It 
has been more than a year for many 
who have been out of work. Taking the 
leap to get back in sometimes is scary, 
but we have to help the people take 
that leap. If we wait, these businesses 
and jobs they are now offering right 
now may not be there in September. 
Companies and small businesses are 
going out of work and going out of 
business. 
That is why I joined my colleagues, 
Senator CRAPO and Senator RISCH, to 
sponsor the Back to Work Bonus Act. 
This bill would give back-to-work bo-
nuses to workers who are able to safely 
return to work. This would be a one- 
time payment of $1,200 for those re-
turning to full-time jobs and $600 to 
those returning to part-time jobs. Em-
ployers would verify the earnings and 
hours of those receiving the back-to- 
work bonuses. That sounds much more 
like an actual stimulus to me. 
The Back to Work Bonus Act is a 
win-win-win—good for workers, good 
for employers, and great for our soci-
ety. I am sure each of my colleagues 
has received similar pleas from small 
business owners across their State. 
The 
Biden-backed 
unemployment 
benefits are crushing their hopes of 
getting back to a prepandemic high. 
We are even seeing some States take 
matters into their own hands. Earlier 
this week, I was glad to see Alabama be 
one of the first States to announce 
plans to stop accepting enhanced Fed-
eral unemployment benefits. As of 
today, at least 16 States have an-
nounced they won’t accept the benefit 
to help employers and encourage folks 
to get back to work. This is a common-
sense move to encourage folks to take 
the many job opportunities available. 
Well, I, for one, think we should lis-
ten to the folks on Main Street. We can 
help them, and we can help millions of 
the unemployed. One way to do it is by 
passing the Back to Work Bonus Act. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
practical bill and get our country back 
to work. We need to remember: Oppor-
tunity through work is the foundation 
of our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
HONORING DEPUTY WYATT CHRISTOPHER MASER 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, every 
year, the Senate unanimously passes a 
resolution honoring each law enforce-
ment officer who died in the line of 
duty during the previous year. Their 
names are also added to the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in 
Washington, DC. Currently, this memo-
rial contains more than 21,000 names. 
This year, one more Idahoan will be 
added to this memorial. 
Wyatt Christopher Maser was born 
April 19, 1997, in Thermopolis, WY, to 
Christopher Michael Maser and Sandra 
Lorene Reid Arnold. After growing up 
in Casper, WY, Wyatt joined the U.S. 
Air Force, serving as a senior airman 
from 2015 to 2018. 
After returning to his home and 
marrying the love of his life, Paige, 
Wyatt began his career in law enforce-
ment, moving to Idaho Falls, ID, and 
joining the Bonneville County Sheriff’s 
Office and graduating from the Idaho 
Law Enforcement Academy in 2019. 
Shortly before graduating, he and 
Paige 
welcomed 
a 
beautiful 
baby 
daughter, Morgan Emily. 
He served as a sheriff’s deputy with 
Bonneville County Sheriff’s Office for 
13 months. At the graveside service 
honoring his life, his career was char-
acterized in two words: ‘‘friendship’’ 
and ‘‘service.’’ 
It takes a special person to serve in 
our Nation’s Armed Forces and an even 
better one to continue to serve one’s 
community after leaving the Air Force. 
By all accounts, Wyatt was that per-
son, befriending everyone he met. 
On May 18, 2020, while attempting to 
help a woman in mental crisis in the 
middle of Bone Road, he was struck by 
another deputy’s vehicle and was pro-
nounced dead at Eastern Idaho Medical 
Center. 
Wyatt left behind his wife, Paige; his 
young daughter, Morgan; his mother 
and stepfather, Sandy and Bill Arnold; 
his father and stepmother, Chris and 
Cheryl Maser; his siblings, Cole, Tay-
lor, Jesse, and Alexys; and grand-
parents, uncles, and pets galore. 
The Law Enforcement Officers Me-
morial preserves Wyatt’s name in 
stone. Yet Deputy Maser was so much 
more than an Air Force veteran and a 
law enforcement officer. An avid wa-
terfowl hunter, Wyatt and his fellow 
members of the Delta Waterfowl Snake 
River Chapter were building a hunting 
blind for disabled hunters to help those 
with limitations enjoy the pastime he 
loved so much. That blind is still being 
completed and will be named the 
‘‘Maser Blind’’ in his memory. 
Deputy Maser, your memory will not 
be forgotten. 
To Paige and Morgan, I am so sorry 
for your loss, and thank you for the op-
portunity to join in honoring Wyatt. 
The Book of Isaiah, chapter 6, verse 
8, states: 
And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 
‘‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’’ 
Then I said, ‘‘Here am I! Send me.’’

May 13, 2021 
If not, the bill having been read the 
third time, the question is, Shall the 
bill pass? 
The bill (S. 593), as amended, was 
passed. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
we are at a much better place at this 
moment in time for the people of the 
State of Alaska, who have been anx-
ious. 
We 
have 
all 
been 
anxious 
throughout this time of COVID, but we 
have been particularly anxious as we 
have watched our tourist sector just be 
decimated. And when I say ‘‘deci-
mated,’’ I mean in the sense that when 
you have such a significant portion of 
one economic sector, the tourist sec-
tor, come to your State by one means, 
by one mode—and for us, in the State 
of Alaska, that is cruise ship. 
We have had an extraordinarily ro-
bust tourist economy, growing over the 
years. People want to come and see the 
beauty and the splendor, and for many, 
they want to be on the comfort of a 
ship and watch the views go by, see the 
glaciers, see the whales come on up. It 
is a great place to visit. But for the 
past year, ships have not been sailing 
to Alaska. This is due to not only the 
CDC and the no-sail orders the CDC has 
imposed but also because of the limita-
tions that have been put in place by 
Canada in terms of no sailing through 
the Canadian waters. 
So there has been an effort to, as we 
try to regain our footing, rebuild a 
tourist sector, but you can’t just flip a 
switch here. You just can’t get an in-
dustry back on its feet this quickly 
without everybody pulling together, 
and this has been a struggle to get ev-
eryone pulling together. But I think we 
are at a place where there is a glimmer 
of hope for Alaska’s tourism industry. 
We were here on this floor just a cou-
ple weeks ago, Senator SULLIVAN and 
myself, talking about how significant 
cruising is as an element to Alaska’s 
economy. At the time, I shared a chart 
with colleagues that showed that in 
2019 we had 1.3 million visitors come to 
Alaska on a cruise ship, and in 2020 we 
had 48 come to Alaska on a cruise ship. 
I said at the time: That is 48 pas-
sengers, not 48,000. 
You can just guess what that did to 
our economy—the statewide unemploy-
ment rate rising from 6.2 to 11 percent; 
municipal and State revenues dropping 
significantly; 
and 
every 
day 
that 
passes, more lost revenues, more lost 
salaries, more economic distress. So 
the effort that we have made to, again, 
try to get ships back in the water, try 
to get them heading north, has been 
considerable. 
We have heard from so many in not 
only our coastal communities but, 
really, communities around the State 
about the economic impact and the hit 
they have taken. 
In the Indian Affairs Committee, we 
had a hearing just yesterday about the 
impact on Native tourism due to 
COVID, and we had the CEO of Huna 
Totem Corporation, Russell Dick, de-
scribe to the committee the profound 
‘‘disruption of our local economy, as 80 
percent of our local tax base comes 
from tourism,’’ he said. Consequently, 
‘‘leadership from the city of Hoonah, 
the community, and Icy Strait Point 
are all eager for cruise ships to re-
turn.’’ Consider that. Eighty percent of 
your local tax base comes from tour-
ism, and if you don’t have passengers 
coming in, if you don’t have visitors 
coming in, you basically have nothing. 
So we needed to address this. We need-
ed to fix this. 
We have been working aggressively, 
not only the Alaska delegation here 
working with Congressmen but work-
ing with all members of the adminis-
tration. We have the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, who is literally on 
speed dial, the Director of the CDC, 
who really doesn’t want to hear from 
us anymore because I think we have 
been so constant. We have been engag-
ing with the Secretary of Commerce. 
We have taken this to the head of the 
Canadian Government as well, with let-
ters to Prime Minister Trudeau and to 
his Cabinet, to his Parliament. So the 
effort that has been underway has been 
considerable. 
We had an opportunity on the floor a 
couple weeks ago to discuss this very 
issue. We heard concerns raised by Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL
about some con-
sumer protection provisions. We heard 
concerns from Senator LEE about the 
Passenger Vessel Services Act, the 
PVSA. We weren’t able to come to a 
resolution at the time, but I think 
what was good at that time was a com-
mitment to keep working on this. We 
kept working on this, and we are now 
to the point where we have successfully 
passed 
this 
temporary 
PVSA 
fix 
through the Senate. 
I want to state, though, that this is 
not a fix for the cruise companies, if 
you will. This is help, this is a fix, if 
you will, for the communities in 
Southeastern Alaska, the communities 
around Alaska for whom opening up 
some semblance of a cruise season this 
summer is literally going to determine 
their future—not just whether they are 
able to open this year but whether they 
are able to open at all going forward. 
To tell people that they have to hold 
on through 2022, hold on for yet an-
other 14 months—that is just not pos-
sible because it has already been 19 
months that these communities have 
been so severely and so significantly 
impacted. 
So the timing of this is key. It is 
critical. It is literally every day count-
ing, every day that matters, so that 
our communities can get the folks 
back in the little store, get your teams 
hired up to take the tourists out on the 
attractions, get us back to a place 
where again we can be more stable 
from an economic perspective and with 
regards to the benefit to Alaskans and 
the employment. 
We are ready to go back to work. We 
have been working hard on the vaccine. 
We have advertised ourselves as a 
State to be coming to if you are look-
ing for your travel adventure and do so 
in a safe place. But we have been tied— 
our hands have been tied—in our abil-
ity to get the season back up and run-
ning and in a way that is going to pro-
vide for a level of safety for all. 
We are continuing to make progress 
with CDC. I think that is an important 
part to add to because that has been an 
impediment to us. The CDC has been 
slow—torturously slow—in laying down 
their guidance, but I am optimistic 
that we are very close. Hopefully— 
hopefully—we are going to have the 
necessary certainty for cruise compa-
nies to ramp up their operations to 
again prepare to cruise to Alaska. 
With the CDC paving the way over 
there and the PVSA issue, we are very 
hopeful—very, very hopeful—that we 
will be able to advance over in the 
House, working with our colleagues 
over there, to be able to provide this 
certainty for a very short season that 
will allow Alaskans to have some glim-
mer of hope here. 
But I want to end with a comment 
and a statement that came from Mr. 
Russell Dick, again, the CEO of Huna 
Totem Corporation. Mr. Dick is indige-
nous from the Hoonah region. Hoonah 
was his community, his village that he 
grew up in. And he reminded us of the 
situation that Canada has really placed 
us in. 
The reality is, he has a community 
where they may have literally no econ-
omy this summer if you can’t get 
cruise ships in. Eighty percent of the 
employees that work at Icy Strait 
there are local and native hire. But his 
comment was that we are dealing with 
this because Congress, in his words, 
hasn’t dealt with the PVSA. And he 
says: This is not Canada’s fault; this is 
the Federal Government’s fault. And 
he says: Let me be clear. The PVSA 
right now is preventing us from hiring 
Americans in an American community 
that desperately needs those jobs. The 
U.S. Congress is responsible for this 
problem. 
I think Russell made it very, very 
clear to us that we have to address 
this. We have to address this. What we 
have done just now is we have shown 
that when Canada is going to make 
some tough decisions, we are not going 
to stand by. We are not just going to 
say ‘‘pretty please,’’ withering on the 
vine here until another country—until 
Canada—catches up with our level of 
readiness. It should be up to us to be 
able to restore our economy, and we 
will take the first steps to do just that. 
So I want to thank Senator SUL-
LIVAN, absolutely, for his leadership 
throughout all of this, but I also want 
to recognize Senator LEE, Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, Senator CANTWELL, and 
Senator WICKER and their teams for 
helping us get to this place today

May 13, 2021 
where we can be in a spot where we can 
tell Alaskans the light is coming on. 
With that, I will yield to my friend 
and colleague Senator SULLIVAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to thank Senator MURKOWSKI for 
her hard work. 
For the Alaskans who are watching, 
what just happened here is kind of 
quick but important. The U.S. Senate 
just passed our bill, the PVSA suspen-
sion act, that is going to give our tour-
ism season and the thousands of Alas-
kans in that industry and the hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of small busi-
nesses that are hanging by a thread a 
fighting chance for this summer—a 
fighting chance for the summer. That 
just passed the U.S. Senate and is 
going over to the House. 
So, again, I want to thank Senator 
MURKOWSKI for her leadership on this 
and, of course, the Senators that she 
mentioned who were very engaged: 
Senator LEE, Senator MARKEY, Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, Senator CANTWELL, Sen-
ator WICKER. 
You know, this, to me, is an example 
of the U.S. Senate working at its best— 
at its best. What was going on here and 
what we did for the last several weeks 
is we went to all of our colleagues and 
said: Look, we have a unique problem 
right now. In the Great State of Alas-
ka, we are so proud of how we have 
done in terms of getting through the 
health aspects of this pandemic, but 
our economy is getting crushed for a 
whole host of reasons I have talked 
about on the floor here many, many 
times. One of the huge areas is the 
tourism sector and the unique chal-
lenges we have with the borders being 
closed by the Canadians, which is not 
helpful; the cruise ship industry not 
being able to move; and the millions of 
passengers who were expected to come 
to Alaska on cruise ships. 
So we were going to each Senator 
and saying: Look, we know you have 
big, philosophical differences on some 
things that relate tangentially to this 
issue, but right now this issue is very 
narrow. Help us help our constituents. 
That is it. It is not going to impact any 
other State. 
And to our colleagues’ credit, all of 
them said: OK, Senator MURKOWSKI, 
Senator SULLIVAN, we will help. 
And that is a good spirit of coopera-
tion. We essentially went to them and 
said: Hey, if your State had a problem 
uniquely focused on just your citizens, 
we would help you. 
So that is what you just saw here. It 
took a little while. That is OK. Noth-
ing moves fast in the U.S. Senate, but 
that is a step forward—an important 
step forward. 
But we still have work to do, as Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI mentioned. This bill 
right now is going to be heading over 
to the House, right now, and we cer-
tainly hope, with the great leadership 
of the dean of the House, Congressman 
YOUNG, and all his relationships in the 
House, that the House is going to show 
the same cooperative spirit that we 
just witnessed here on the U.S. Senate 
floor. So we are hoping for that. That 
is the next step. 
But as Senator MURKOWSKI
men-
tioned, we are working all kinds of dif-
ferent angles—plan B, plan C, plan D. 
We need the CDC to continue its 
progress, finally—frustrating but fi-
nally. They need to continue to provide 
detailed guidance to operationalize 
their lifting of the no-sail order. 
And as Senator MURKOWSKI also men-
tioned, we are going to continue to 
work with our friends in Canada—‘‘O 
Canada.’’ 
Now, you know, in Alaska, we have 
one neighbor. We don’t have any of our 
wonderful lower 48 States as neighbors. 
We have Canada. We don’t really in-
clude Russia. Canada. So I would say 
that the Alaska delegation is probably 
the most pro-Canadian, certainly the 
most 
knowledgeable 
about 
Canada 
issues of any delegation in the U.S. 
Congress. We work to help them out on 
issues—big issues, small issues, trade 
issues, NORAD, military issues, min-
ing. We have a great relationship—the 
Alaska-Canada relationship. But, to be 
frank, we are not getting a lot of help 
right now. The border is closed—fully 
closed. We think that is pretty draco-
nian, to be honest. 
Alaskans are having a hard time even 
driving home to get through Canada. 
We put forward a number of very rea-
sonable suggestions to try to accom-
modate what we are hoping will be a 
fighting chance for our tourism season, 
for our small businesses that have been 
so decimated by this pandemic. 
To our colleagues in Canada, reason-
able compromises in the event that we 
don’t make progress here—we are mak-
ing progress here in the U.S. Congress. 
That is good, again, so that we can 
have a fighting chance for somewhat of 
a tourism season this summer. But up 
until now, all of these suggestions— 
they are really not even neighbors to 
the north; they are neighbors for us to 
the east—haven’t gotten a lot of co-
operation. So this is not the coopera-
tive spirit that has defined the Alaska- 
Canadian relationship for decades, and 
quite 
frankly, 
we 
have 
been 
dis-
appointed by it. 
So to our House colleagues—Demo-
crats and Republicans—you have just 
kind of witnessed two examples of co-
operation. What happened here on the 
Senate floor just a couple of minutes 
ago was really good cooperation. All 
100 Senators essentially had to agree to 
move this bill forward, and they just 
did. That is what just happened. That 
is good cooperation. 
We haven’t had such good coopera-
tion from our Canadian neighbors—dis-
appointing. But look, my own view is 
that we need to start making sure that 
the Alaska economy is not held hos-
tage to another country. We are going 
to start working on that. 
But until then, to our House Mem-
bers, please, if you can look at what 
just happened in the Senate, listen to 
Congressman YOUNG, whom you all 
know is a great advocate. If we can get 
this done in the next 24, 48 hours, our 
State—your fellow Americans, who are 
working hard like everybody else here 
to get out of this pandemic—will have 
a fighting chance. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Texas. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this 
week America celebrates National Po-
lice Week. It is a time for us to stop 
and pay tribute to those who died in 
the line of duty defending our commu-
nities and to thank those who continue 
to serve our communities. 
Law enforcement is a calling an-
swered by a select few. These men and 
women have chosen a difficult and 
often dangerous life dedicated to keep-
ing our communities safe, defending 
our civil liberties, and protecting our 
neighborhoods. These jobs, obviously, 
require tremendous courage and sac-
rifice, not just from the officers them-
selves but their families too, and I am 
grateful to those who selflessly serve 
our communities every day. 
Under normal circumstances, the 
events of this week bring tens of thou-
sands of uniformed officers to Wash-
ington, DC, from across the country. 
Through laying wreaths, candlelight 
vigils, and church services, they ordi-
narily gather in remembrance of their 
fallen brothers and sisters in person. In 
previous years, I have had the pleasure 
of welcoming a number of Texas offi-
cers and their families who have trav-
eled to Washington, DC, for this Na-
tional Police Week observation, but as 
in so many other ways, this year is not 
like previous ones. 
Over the last year, our country has 
faced unprecedented heartbreak and 
turmoil, which have made a career in 
law 
enforcement 
even 
more 
chal-
lenging. First came the pandemic. 
While millions of Americans hunkered 
down in their homes to slow the spread 
of the virus, law enforcement personnel 
continued to lace up their boots and go 
to work every day. 
With the spread of COVID–19 and the 
lack of proper personal protective 
equipment in the early stages of the 
pandemic, even simple interactions 
with members of the community car-
ried risks. 
At the same time, the stresses of the 
pandemic led to a surge of drug over-
dose deaths and an increase in family 
violence. And across the country, we 
saw a dramatic increase in the number 
of homicides. 
When a deadly winter storm hit 
Texas in February, police officers took 
on even more responsibility. They 
worked around the clock to help folks 
without power or water, often while 
worrying about the safety of their own 
families. 
For all the ways the last year has 
taught us to appreciate the unique role 
that law enforcement officers play in

May 13, 2021 
our communities, it has also put these 
men and women at the center of a 
tough, but necessary, national con-
versation about racial justice. 
The killing of George Floyd shone a 
spotlight on issues in our justice sys-
tem that absolutely must be rooted out 
and led to a national conversation 
about the need to do so. 
There is no question we need to take 
action to improve transparency and ac-
countability within our police forces. 
We need to strengthen the relation-
ship between police and the commu-
nities they serve. I believe everybody 
can agree on those points. 
But as a country, we need to remem-
ber that the actions of a few do not de-
fine the masses, the rest of us. The vast 
majority of police officers are honor-
able, dedicated public servants who go 
above and beyond the call of duty to 
keep us safe and are committed to im-
proving accountability and trust in po-
lice. There is a saying that nobody 
hates a bad cop worse than a good cop. 
Last summer, police officers in Dallas 
hosted a rally to show their support for 
the efforts to stop police brutality and 
racial injustice. We need to remember 
that, 
except 
for 
these 
occasional 
outliers, we are all on the same team, 
fighting for a justice system that keeps 
our communities safe and treats every 
person with dignity and respect. 
For some, this movement has led to 
radical calls to defund or even abolish 
the police—two very dangerous ideas. 
Over the last year, we have seen an in-
crease in violent crime in our country. 
Last year, major cities experienced a 
33-percent increase in homicides—33 
percent. The early data shows that 
things aren’t getting any better this 
year. In fact, in too many places, 
things are getting worse. 
This simply isn’t the time, if there 
ever were a time, to strip local police 
departments of funding; rather, it is 
time to provide them with the re-
sources and the policies they need to 
safely and justly protect our commu-
nities. I know we are having a lot of 
discussions across the aisle on the 
most effective way to do that, and I 
hope that this year, unlike last year, 
we will be able to make progress. 
A job in law enforcement, as I sug-
gested, is never easy. These men and 
women put on the uniform and leave 
their families, never knowing what the 
day ahead may entail. In the back of 
their minds, they have a question— 
whether this is the last time they will 
ever see their loved ones. Stopping a 
violent crime, helping a neighbor in 
crisis—you never know what a police 
encounter could bring. 
Four months ago, Capitol Police offi-
cers certainly didn’t anticipate what 
their jobs would require on January 6. 
This building was stormed by a violent 
mob who tried to threaten the very 
foundations of our democracy. 
That day, as we know, this building 
was filled with Members of Congress, 
our staff, journalists, and countless 
men and women whom we count on to 
keep Congress running every day. For-
tunately, that also includes the brave 
men and women of the Capitol Police 
Force. While protecting the people in-
side this building, Capitol Police offi-
cers were assaulted, threatened, and 
subjected to the violence of the mob 
for hours on end. 
In the wake of this tragedy, the Cap-
itol Police lost two of their colleagues, 
Officer Brian Sicknick and Officer 
Howard Liebengood. Last month, Cap-
itol Police Officer Billy Evans was 
killed while protecting this institution. 
I am grateful for the sacrifices law 
enforcement officers make every single 
day. This week, we honor those who 
made the ultimate sacrifice. One of the 
most 
emblematic 
remembrances 
of 
that sacrifice is the National Law En-
forcement Officers Memorial, which 
sits along the National Mall here in 
Washington, DC. It is a beautiful trib-
ute to the Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement officers who died in the 
line of duty and features marble walls 
filled with more than 21,000 names. 
Each of these names represents a hero, 
and, sadly, this year we added the 
names of 55 Texans who were killed in 
the line of duty last year. 
These officers gave their all in serv-
ice to our communities and to our 
country. Of course, there is nothing we 
can do to adequately thank these he-
roes and their families for their sac-
rifice, but we can take action to pro-
tect their brothers and sisters in blue. 
In recent years, we have seen brutal, 
inexcusable attacks on police officers 
around the country, including one in 
Dallas that completely rocked our en-
tire State. In 2016, a man killed five of-
ficers and injured nine others. It was a 
sobering reminder of the dangers these 
officers face every day and a call for us 
to take action to do more to support 
them. 
Yesterday, I reintroduced the Back 
the Blue Act to make clear our support 
for the public servants who dedicated 
their lives to protecting our commu-
nities. This legislation sends a strong 
message to more than 800,000 law en-
forcement officers in our country that 
they are supported and that violence 
against them will not be tolerated. 
The Back the Blue Act adds stiff, 
mandatory penalties, and it makes it a 
Federal crime to kill or attempt to kill 
a law enforcement officer, a Federal 
judge, or a federally funded public safe-
ty officer. It also makes it a Federal 
crime to assault a law enforcement of-
ficer. These men and women put them-
selves in harm’s way every day, and we 
must make it clear that violence 
against them will never be tolerated. 
Right now, there is a serious need to 
improve the relationships between law 
enforcement and the communities they 
serve, and this legislation will help 
there too. It will allow grant funds to 
be used for efforts to help foster more 
trust between police and the commu-
nities they protect. 
In light of the national conversation 
over the past year regarding the need 
to improve these relationships, this 
could not be more important. I hope 
my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting this legislation and show law 
enforcement across the country that 
we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 
them. 
I was also pleased this morning when 
a bill that I am leading with my col-
league Senator COONS called the Jaime 
Zapata and Victor Avila Federal Offi-
cer 
and 
Employee 
Protection 
Act 
passed out of the Judiciary Committee. 
That bill came in response to an appel-
late court decision that reversed the 
convictions of cartel members who 
murdered a Federal agent and at-
tempted to murder another one while 
those agents were fighting the cartels 
in Mexico. An appeals court held that 
the United States did not have jurisdic-
tion to try the cartel members for the 
murder and attempted murder. This 
bill closes that loophole and states un-
equivocally that we can and will try 
and convict those who murder our law 
enforcement officers, even those serv-
ing outside the United States. 
I am grateful for the law enforcement 
officers who courageously and honor-
ably serve our communities every day. 
This week, we honor them and the gen-
erations of officers who came before 
them. In particular, we pay tribute to 
those who made the ultimate sacrifice 
in service to our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Alaska. 
TRIBUTE TO JUSTIN DOLL 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday, and it is that time of the 
week I come down on the Senate floor 
and get to do one of my favorite things 
of the whole week. I get to recognize 
the special Alaskan, someone whom we 
call the Alaskan of the Week. 
But before I talk about our Alaskan 
of the Week—and my good friend from 
Texas, Senator CORNYN, just talked 
about the importance of supporting our 
police and leaders in the police forces, 
and it is National Police Week. It is 
very appropriate that the Alaskan of 
the Week this week is outgoing An-
chorage Police Chief Justin Doll. 
I am going to tell you a lot about 
Chief Doll’s great career in Alaska. I 
want to first begin by just giving a 
quick little update. I know people who 
watch the Alaskan of the Week want to 
know: Hey, what is going on in Alaska 
right now? It is such a great place, a 
special place. 
Right now, it is approaching mid-
night Sun time in most places across 
the State. I will give you one example. 
In Anchorage, the Sun officially rose at 
5:16 a.m. and will set at 10:37 p.m. That 
is a lot of daylight. Twilight actually 
starts around 4 a.m. and ends around 
midnight. 
We are getting to that midnight Sun 
time, summer solstice time. A frenzied 
energy hits the State at this time of 
year. It is all the more so because the 
State is opening up, like so many 
States across America now, after a

long year of hunkering down—late 
night walks, softball, yard work, gath-
erings. 
If you are watching and you have 
never been to Alaska, it is a great time 
to be in Alaska. I urge everyone in the 
Gallery and at home to come on up to 
Alaska. 
You may have seen some of the ac-
tion on the Senate floor a couple of 
minutes ago. It is looking more and 
more like we are going to have, hope-
fully, at least part of a cruise season. 
But we are welcoming everybody to 
come to Alaska this summer. You will 
love it. Heck, you can even get vac-
cinated if your State is not doing that 
for you, so come on up. 
We all know that what makes the 
State truly great is not the hours of 
Sun it gets or its salmon-choked 
streams and rivers or the magnificent 
wildlife—moose, bear, caribou—or the 
soaring mountains, all of which, of 
course, in Alaska we have in spades. 
Nothing makes our communities, our 
State, our country strong like the peo-
ple who live in our communities, and 
none are perhaps more important to 
community strength and cohesion than 
our brave first responders, our police 
officers who wake up every day deter-
mined to protect others. 
I know there is a movement across 
the country, and Senator CORNYN just 
talked about it—in my view, a dan-
gerous movement—and that is the call 
to defund the police. It makes zero 
sense, by the way. You want your com-
munities safe, and you are going to get 
rid of your police? It makes no sense. 
Here is the thing about police officers 
like Chief Doll and first responders. 
These jobs are not only important, in 
my view, they are sacred. Now, every 
job in America is an important job, but 
there is something special, there is 
something even sacred about the job of 
our first responders—police, firemen, 
our military—whose job it is literally 
to go lay down their lives for their fel-
low citizens if called to do that. That is 
sacred. 
I think it is important for all of us 
here in the Senate to be very clear how 
much we support our police and our 
first responders all across the Nation, 
especially during this week. That is 
why I am so honored and thrilled in 
many ways to be able to recognize our 
Alaskan of the Week this week, who is 
outgoing Anchorage Police Department 
Chief Justin Doll, who has served with 
APD for 25 years and has been the chief 
of the department since 2017. Justin 
has worked with, supported, and over-
seen more than 600 members of the 
APD, brave men and women who keep 
about 300,000 residents in the Anchor-
age area, my hometown, safe—roughly 
200 square miles. 
Let me tell you a bit about Justin, 
who also happens to be a Marine Corps 
brother of mine—a man of service, a 
man of honor, courage, and commit-
ment. Born and raised in Oregon, he 
moved with his family to Anchorage in 
1985 when he was just 12 years old. The 
country was coming out of a recession. 
Alaska was doing well. His parents saw 
opportunity, so they packed their U- 
Haul and drove up to Alcan. 
His mother ended up working in an 
orthodontist office, and his father 
worked for 22 years at the famous 
Hotel Captain Cook, one of the great 
locally owned hotels in all of Alaska. 
Justin graduated from West Anchor-
age High School, and after a few years 
in college, he joined the Marine Corps 
Forces Reserves. Now, he didn’t join 
just any Marine Corps reserve unit; he 
joined Echo Company, 4th Recon Bat-
talion—the premier cold weather recon 
unit in the U.S. Marine Corps, reserve 
or active. How do I know? Because I 
was serving in that unit with Chief 
Doll for 5 years. As a matter of fact, I 
was Justin’s platoon commander. Now, 
he laughingly describes himself as my 
Marine Corps disciplinary challenge. I 
don’t remember him as a disciplinary 
challenge; I remember him as a fine 
marine and a great NCO who did a real-
ly good job with Echo Company. 
In 1996, he was in the Reserves at 
that time, and he got a job with the 
APD. A lot of the marines in Alaska 
join our law enforcement, which is an-
other great path into service. He didn’t 
grow up wanting to be a police officer, 
but when presented with an oppor-
tunity to serve his community as he 
was serving in the Marines, he jumped 
at it, and he excelled. Throughout the 
years, he served as a patrol officer, an 
academy instructor, a motorcycle offi-
cer, a SWAT team member, a patrol 
shift commander. He was on the bomb 
squad and was a commander of the 
Homicide and Robbery/Assaults Detec-
tive Units. He did it all, and he did it 
all well. 
Here are some of the ways in which 
his colleagues and his bosses have de-
scribed him throughout his years in his 
fitness reports: ‘‘Outstanding perform-
ance’’; ‘‘proactive leadership’’; ‘‘Gives 
credit where credit is due’’; ‘‘genuine 
concern 
for 
his 
fellow 
officers’’; 
‘‘earned the respect of everybody’’; 
leadership philosophy is to help guide 
and train up leaders to rise’’; ‘‘com-
mitted to excellence.’’ Those are his re-
viewing officers’ remarks. 
His executive assistant, Gia Currier, 
talks about how, when people would 
meet Chief Doll, community mem-
bers—young kids; it didn’t matter—he 
never introduced himself as ‘‘chief.’’ He 
would just say: ‘‘Hey, I’m Justin.’’ She 
said: 
He makes me proud to work at APD, and I 
am grateful to have had the opportunity to 
work and learn from him. 
It should be noted here that, in the 
meantime, in 2000, he married fellow 
police officer Monique, and in so doing, 
like many of us—certainly, like me—he 
married up. Like Justin, Monique also 
rose through the ranks to become one 
of the APD’s top detectives. In fact, 
she was the lead in catching one of the 
most sickening serial killers in Alas-
ka’s history, Israel Keyes. We are so 
grateful for her dedication and service 
to our State and our community. 
We have a very unique community in 
Alaska, in Anchorage. We have earth-
quakes. Not too far away, we have vol-
canoes. We have 100-mile-an-hour wind-
storms. Our moose charge, and our 
bears attack sometimes. Once, when he 
was at a national training event with 
big-city police officers from across the 
country, he was talking to his fellow 
police chiefs, over beers, about bears 
and what was going on in their respec-
tive cities. He told the group how just 
the day before, a brown bear had 
charged, mauled, and tragically killed 
an Alaskan resident. 
Terry Monahan—at the time, the po-
lice chief for New York City—said: 
What? In the city? How do you deal with 
that? 
By the way, I am pretty sure Justin, 
when he was telling that story to us, 
cleaned up the language from the New 
York City police chief when he re-
counted that story. But these are the 
many things that a police chief in 
Alaska has to deal with, has to be 
ready for, and has to be able to lead on. 
Like all cities, we have had serious 
problems with crime. As a matter of 
fact, in 2017, right when Justin took 
over as the chief for the Anchorage Po-
lice Department, my hometown of An-
chorage was going through a very seri-
ous, major crime spree. Violent crime 
was way up. Homicides were breaking 
records. Property crime and vehicle 
crime were way, way up. Justin got to 
work. He focused on making sure his 
officers had the training they needed to 
do their jobs. His goal was ‘‘to set them 
up for success and let them be success-
ful.’’ His motto: ‘‘One Team, One Mis-
sion.’’ It sounds a lot like a marine: 
‘‘One Team, One Fight.’’ He put a focus 
on engaging with the community. He 
organized the beats so that the officers 
got to know the people in their areas 
and patrolled those same areas during 
the course of their time. He brought 
back walking beats in the downtown 
area. He and his officers attended com-
munity council meetings and joined 
the communities throughout the entire 
city in smaller gatherings. 
Now, as I mentioned, Anchorage is a 
big city in terms of area, but in a lot of 
ways, it is really a small town. Word 
gets around. When you get to know 
your police officer, you trust your po-
lice officer, and you begin to work with 
that person to make your community 
safer. That was Justin’s philosophy, 
and that is what started to happen. At 
its heart, community policing is not 
more complicated than that, according 
to Justin, Chief Doll. Getting to know 
one another, respecting one another, 
trusting one another—that is how com-
munities become safe. 
He also worked on forming partner-
ships with the Department of Justice, 
the Attorney General’s Office, and the 
FBI, which doesn’t always happen in 
other localities across the country. 
Again, Anchorage is a big city and a 
small town. Federal agents were also 
having their cars stolen. They had

friends whose houses were getting bro-
ken into. This crime spree became per-
sonal for everybody, and everybody 
started to work together—with Chief 
Doll in the lead to solve it. Again, word 
got around. All of it—training, empow-
ering police officers, working with the 
Feds, community engagement—started 
to work. 
We still have challenges, no doubt, in 
Anchorage, but since the time Justin 
Doll started, homicides have gone down 
almost 50 percent. The rates of prop-
erty crimes and other violent crimes 
have also come down. That is a win. 
Mostly, it is a win for the people of 
Alaska, for the people of Anchorage. So 
Justin is leaving the department a win-
ner, and he is also leaving the depart-
ment with good memories. That was 
important to him. 
There are challenges, and he recog-
nizes those. Burnout, he said, is a prob-
lem, particularly these days. He didn’t 
want to get that, and he hopes his fel-
low officers don’t get that. According 
to Justin—he said: ‘‘The world’s a lit-
tle insane right now when it comes to 
law enforcement,’’ and he sees for him-
self what that does to the morale of his 
officers. He has experienced how dis-
heartening it is to have the whole 
force, not just in Alaska but across the 
country—these are hundreds of thou-
sands of good police officers across our 
Nation who have very, very stressful 
jobs—being disparaged because of the 
horrific actions of a few. 
Across the Nation, he said: 
We have completely lost sight of the fact 
that there are so many people doing a good 
job keeping communities safe every day. 
These are people who really want to do a 
good job and take care of the people and citi-
zens around them. 
We should remember that, especially 
during this week, National Police 
Week, when we remember the sac-
rifices of so many of our frontline he-
roes. 
Justin and Monique, his wife, will be 
leaving the force permanently in June. 
The current acting chief is Kenneth 
McCoy—also a very impressive officer. 
We are all rooting for Chief McCoy. Of 
course, we are rooting for Justin and 
his future endeavors. As we are for all 
of our police officers across the coun-
try, we are thankful for Chief Doll’s 
service—fulfilling his sacred duty—for 
keeping us safe, and for keeping our 
communities whole. 
So, Justin, one more time, congratu-
lations on a great job. Congratulations 
on being our Alaskan of the Week. 
Semper Fi. 
ENERGY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
would like you to hear a quote: ‘‘You 
know, if you drive an electric car, this 
would not be affecting you, clearly.’’ 
That was from our Secretary of En-
ergy, Jennifer Granholm, yesterday, as 
she told reporters all about the cyber 
attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and 
the ensuing gas shortages and price 
spikes. 
Think about that, America. 
Of course, the media just let her go. 
They didn’t ask her if she knew that, 
just as meat doesn’t come from a gro-
cery store, energy just doesn’t come 
from a wall. It doesn’t just appear like 
magic when you plug into it. It comes 
from many sources, including from 
natural gas, including from oil. 
The media didn’t ask about natural 
gas—yes, and oil—needing pipelines. 
The media didn’t ask her if she knew 
that all energy, including alternative 
energy, requires transmission lines— 
lines that are also subject to being at-
tacked like the Colonial Pipeline. 
They didn’t ask her if she knew that 
the cost of an electric car, the average 
price, is more than $55,000. Maybe that 
is a bargain for her, but for the people 
the Biden administration is putting 
out of work in the energy sector, that 
is a huge pricetag. 
The media certainly didn’t ask the 
Secretary of Energy how this cavalier, 
condescending attitude, once again, 
about our energy sector—one of our 
country’s huge strengths that employs 
hundreds of thousands of hard-working 
Americans—is received by the average 
American who is being hurt right now. 
There are so many questions that 
were not asked, so many questions that 
aren’t being asked about the Colonial 
Pipeline issue, and so many that con-
tinue to not be answered by the admin-
istration when it comes to this specific 
situation and how this administra-
tion’s energy policies threaten to make 
this short-term disruption of our en-
ergy supplies into a long-term reality 
across the country. 
The cyber attack on the Colonial 
Pipeline is a warning for America not 
just from a cyber security standpoint 
but from a broader energy perspective 
standpoint. 
I participated yesterday in the brief-
ing of U.S. Senators by the Secretaries 
of Energy, Transportation, and Home-
land Security on this cyber attack that 
is creating disruptions in energy sup-
plies across the country, particularly 
on the east coast. Here is the advice I 
gave these members of the Biden ad-
ministration: Respectfully, I said that 
I fear that this is going to be common-
place, this kind of disruption—and not 
just from a cyber standpoint—if we 
don’t change the Biden administra-
tion’s energy policies for America. 
What was I talking about? They are 
restricting the production of American 
energy. That is one of the great com-
parative advantages of our country— 
that of producing more in oil, more 
natural gas, and more renewables than 
any other country in the world. They 
are restricting the production of oil 
and gas. 
You have senior administration offi-
cials going to Wall Street saying: Don’t 
invest in energy companies. You have 
Federal Agencies that are either kill-
ing pipelines or slow-rolling pipelines. 
None of this is good for the country. 
So here is the advice I gave them. 
Pipelines are good. We need them, as 
this Colonial Pipeline shutdown cer-
tainly demonstrates. Importing more 
oil from our adversaries like Russia is 
bad, but, by the way, that is what is 
happening with the Biden policies. So 
we need a change. 
We have plenty of oil and gas for 
Americans. We should produce it, as we 
do, with the highest environmental 
standards for the benefit of our own 
citizens and not restrict it or, this 
issue, this kind of disruption is going 
to be much more commonplace in our 
country. 
I yield the floor.

NOTICE OF A TIE VOTE UNDER 
S. RES. 27 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to print the fol-
lowing letter in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
To the Secretary of the Senate: 
PN79–2, the nomination of Kristen M. 
Clarke, of the District of Columbia, to be an 
Assistant Attorney General, having been re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary, 
the Committee, with a quorum present, has 
voted on the nomination as follows— 
(1) on the question of reporting the nomi-
nation favorably with the recommendation 
that the nomination be confirmed, 11 ayes to 
11 noes. 
In accordance with section 3, paragraph 
(l)(A) of S. Res. 27 of the 117th Congress, I 
hereby give notice that the Committee has 
not reported the nomination because of a tie 
vote, and ask that this notice be printed in 
the RECORD pursuant to the resolution. 
f 
NOMINATION OF CHIQUITA 
BROOKS-LASURE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr President, it is 
generally my policy to defer to a Presi-
dent and to allow them to choose their 
Cabinet, provided the nominees are 
qualified and will follow the law. Even 
though I may have disagreed with 
President Biden’s nominees ideologi-
cally, I have voted for many of his 
nominees. This includes Ms. Andrea 
Palm for Deputy Secretary at the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices. Unlike many Senators who voted 
against 
virtually 
all 
of 
President 
Trump’s nominees, it is my philosophy 
that a President should be able to se-
lect those whom he wants to serve in 
his administration, provided that they 
are qualified and meet the most basic 
of tests. 
President Biden has nominated Ms. 
Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to be Adminis-
trator for the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, CMS. I have met 
with the nominee and appreciate her 
commitment to our shared priorities, 
including lowering prescription drug 
costs in a bipartisan manner and main-
taining essential medical services for 
rural Americans. I also remain com-
mitted to oversight of the executive 
branch, including CMS, to uphold our 
system of checks and balances. If Ms. 
Brooks-LaSure is confirmed, I look for-
ward to working with her on these 
shared priorities and others as a senior 
member of the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. Brooks-LaSure has decades of 
health care experience, including at 
the Office of Management and Budget, 
on the House of Representative’s Ways 
and Means Committee, at the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, 
and in the private sector. Ms. Brooks- 
LaSure is qualified to serve as Admin-
istrator of CMS, and I personally do 
not have concerns about her nomina-
tion despite ideological differences. 
However, 
I 
opposed 
Ms. 
Brooks- 
LaSure’s confirmation out of the Com-
mittee on Finance at the request of 
Senator JOHN
CORNYN
of Texas. On 
April 22, 2021, the Finance Committee 
voted 14 to 14 on Ms. Brooks-LaSure’s 
nomination, with all Republican com-
mittee members opposing moving the 
nomination forward. This effort was to 
give Senator CORNYN
time to work 
with the Biden administration to ad-
dress concerns about the CMS recent 
revoking of their section 1115 Medicaid 
waiver. I have opposed advancing other 
nominees of both parties in the past as 
part of my oversight responsibilities 
since it is one of the few tools we have 
in the Senate to extract answers from 
the executive branch. The Biden ad-
ministration took an unprecedented 
action to revoke without consultation 
the State’s Medicaid waiver. By sup-
porting Senator CORNYN’s effort, I was 
hopeful the Biden administration could 
adequately address Texas’s concerns. 
To date, there has not been progress 
made; therefore, I again opposed ad-
vancing this nomination, not with an 
intent to permanently block her con-
firmation, 
but 
as 
an 
exercise 
of 
Congress’s check on the executive 
branch in hopes that it will engage 
with Senator CORNYN in good faith to 
resolve this matter that is so impor-
tant to his home State. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, it 
is a solemn honor to recognize Na-
tional Police Week. Each year, we dedi-
cate this week to express our admira-
tion and gratitude to all of the law en-
forcement officers working to keep us 
safe. We also take this time to remem-
ber those who have paid the ultimate 
sacrifice in the line of duty over the 
past year. 
Law enforcement officers face many 
challenges in their mission to protect 
and serve. I greatly admire members of 
the law enforcement community who 
remain steadfast amidst the dangers of 
their noble profession. 
To all the law enforcement officers 
across the State of Mississippi, I want 
to say to you that I am in Washington, 
DC, as your Senator to support you and 
to work to ensure you have what you 
need to do your job. You are truly our 
hometown heroes. You are the thin 
blue line keeping our families and our 
communities safe. 
The loss of any officer deeply affects 
entire communities beyond their own 
department, and the ramifications for 
their family and friends are heart-
breaking. 
This Police Week, we honor and 
mourn three heroes from Mississippi, 
officers who died in the line of duty 
last year. 
Monroe County Deputy Sheriff Dylan 
Scott Pickle, 24, died on July 26, 2020, 
while on duty after a vehicle struck 
him during a safety checkpoint oper-
ation. 
Dylan, 
a 
decorated 
veteran 
awarded three medals for his heroism 
in Syria, knew at an early age that he 
wanted to serve his community and his 
country. An Amory native and an 
Itawamba Community College grad-
uate, Deputy Pickle’s life of service 
was cut short soon after earning a pro-
motion within the sheriff’s depart-
ment. He leaves behind his mother, a 
sister, a brother, and stepsister. 
Simpson 
County 
Sheriff 
Deputy 
James Harold Blair lost his life on July 
12, 2020, after a subject he was trans-
porting fatally wounded him. This 77- 
year-old grandfather served in law en-
forcement honorably for more than 50 
years in Simpson County, Lincoln 
County, Pike County, and Louisiana. 
He even worked as a crossing guard for 
his 
grandchildren’s 
school. 
Deputy 
Sheriff Blair leaves behind a large 
grieving family, including his wife, 3 
sons, 4 daughters, 17 grandchildren, and 
48 great-grandchildren. 
Correctional Officer Marshall Lee 
‘‘Bem’’ London, Jr., 66, of the Lincoln 
County Sheriff’s Office, passed away 
May 18, 2020. A 16-year veteran of the 
sheriff’s office, Bem is among the trag-
ic number of law enforcement officers 
who succumbed to COVID–19 last year 
while serving the public. A dedicated 
family man, Deputy London is survived 
by his children and grandchildren. 
As a lasting tribute, the names of 
these three brave officers will be added 
this year to the National Law Enforce-
ment Officers Memorial in Washington, 
DC. 
In addition to these recent losses, the 
National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial will now also bear the names 
of three DeSoto County sheriff’s depu-
ties who died in the line of duty 123 
years ago. Deputy Sheriffs Henry R. 
Campbell, William C. Cooper, and Car-
ter I. Jones lost their lives on May 18, 
1898, while attempting to arrest a fa-
ther and son wanted for four murders. 
Even after more than a century, we 
still remember loss and honor their 
service. 
Then and now, our law enforcement 
offices face tremendous dangers as they 
work to ensure the public safety and 
enforce the law. Today, all officers 
must deal with unprecedented chal-
lenges, pressures, and scrutiny. Sup-
porting our law enforcement ought to 
be 
uncontroversial. 
Unfortunately, 
that is not always the case. 
As we mark National Police Week, 
let us embrace the memories of these 
fallen officers as a cause to redouble 
our commitment to supporting law en-
forcement. I assure you that I will con-
tinue to be an advocate for law enforce-
ment professionals and do my very best 
to honor the legacy of all those lost in 
the line of duty. 
To the families of Deputy Pickle, 
Deputy Blair, and Officer London, I 
know you have faced enormous loss. I 
want you to know that you are contin-
ually in our prayers.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE NEW DOCTORS 
OF THE ARKANSAS COLLEGE OF 
OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor the inaugural graduates of the 
Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medi-
cine, ARCOM, as they prepare to re-
ceive their hoods and diplomas on Sat-
urday, May 15, 2021. 
After 4 years, this class of 145 doctors 
will move on to residencies throughout 
the region and the Nation, but first, 
they will celebrate their unique role as 
leaders and standard-setters within 
what has already become a vitally im-
portant and game-changing institution 
in western Arkansas. 
ARCOM welcomed its first class of 
medical students in 2017. Four years 
later, the school celebrated its first 
Match Day with 95 percent of students 
placed into residency programs. Of 
those moving onto residences, 7 per-
cent will work in primary care and al-
most two-thirds received placements in 
Arkansas 
and 
surrounding 
States. 
Studies show us that a majority of doc-
tors stay and practice in the region 
they are educated, so I was also pleased 
to see that more than 50 percent of 
ARCOM’s 
first 
class 
of 
graduates 
matched in States that are considered 
in the bottom 10 percent for access to 
medical care. This is where they are 
needed and speaks to the mission and 
importance of ARCOM, not only to Ar-
kansas but our entire region. 
As part of the Arkansas Colleges of 
Health Education, ACHE, ARCOM is 
transforming healthcare education and 
helping prepare future doctors to prac-
tice in medically underserved regions. 
It is inspiring to think about the ef-
forts it took to make this day possible. 
The need for more medical profes-
sionals in Arkansas is great, and the 
work put in by the students commu-
nity leaders, generous donors, and true 
visionaries who saw the need should be 
applauded today. 
In addition to this inaugural class of 
osteopathic physicians, ACHE is cele-
brating its second commencement for 
graduates receiving a master of science 
in biomedicine. The campus is now also 
home to the School of Physical Ther-
apy, with its first class starting in-
struction in June 2021, and the School 
of Occupational Therapy, which ex-
pects to welcome students in January 
2022. 
I am grateful for the incredible work 
being done by administration, faculty, 
staff, and students. The campus is a 
cornerstone for new medical facilities, 
housing, and opportunities in western 
Arkansas and continues to draw new 
resources to the area. Its impact has 
been significant and stands to grow 
well into the future. 
I am also proud of these graduates. 
They have prepared for their medical 
careers during a challenging time, with 
full understanding of the importance of 
their charge and the task ahead. As 
they embark on their careers, I know 
they have seen and experienced more 
than they expected. They have chosen 
this path for a reason, and our State 
and Nation are stronger because of 
their commitment to serving others. 
Congratulations to the 2021 class of 
ARCOM and to everyone who made this 
dream possible for them and for Arkan-
sas.∑

REMEMBERING JOHN MICHAEL 
ELLIOTT 
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
wish to pay tribute to the life and ca-
reer of John Michael Elliott, who 
passed away suddenly on March 12, 
2021. It is my honor to reflect on the 
legacy John built for his family and his 
community. For me and for my family, 
John M. Elliott was a faithful friend. 
Community, heritage, and history 
were all important to John. Born in 
Girardville, Schuylkill County, PA, on 
July 8, 1941. John later graduated 
magna cum laude from St. Vincent Col-
lege, where he played varsity baseball. 
He received the American Jurispru-
dence Award from the Georgetown Uni-
versity Law Center and launched a suc-
cessful 55-year legal career. John El-
liott never forgot his Schuylkill Coun-
ty roots or Irish-American heritage. 
John was a skilled lawyer who be-
came chairman and CEO of Elliott 
Greenleaf, the law firm he founded in 
1990. To John, law was a profession as 
well as a means by which he could ad-
vance his greater purpose in life: to be 
of service to others. He was talented 
and tenacious. In 1979, he worked to 
right a past wrong and won a post-
humous pardon for Irish immigrant 
and Schuylkill resident, Jack Kehoe. 
In 2002, he won an age-discrimination 
case that resulted in the largest single- 
plaintiff jury verdict in the history of 
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Pennsylvania. John was 
generous with his legal talents and im-
parted his knowledge onto the next 
generation of lawyers as a lecturer for 
the American Law Institute, the Amer-
ican, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia 
Bar Associations, the National Insti-
tute for Trial Advocacy, and the Penn-
sylvania Bar Institute. 
Outside of his law practice and lec-
tures, John remained committed to 
service. He served as chairman of the 
Disciplinary Board of the Supreme 
Court of Pennsylvania, as a commis-
sioner of the Delaware River Port Au-
thority and as a member of the Phila-
delphia City Planning Commission and 
the Pennsylvania Environmental Qual-
ity Board. He was appointed by the 
U.S. Secretary of State to the Commis-
sion on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe’s Conferences on the Human Di-
mension in Paris and on Democratic 
Institutions in Oslo and was a Presi-
dential appointee to the White House 
Coal Advisory Commission. He was a 
steadfast supporter of St. Patrick’s 
College in Maynooth, County Kildare, 
Ireland, for more than two decades. He 
was recognized twice for his efforts in 
1995 when Cardinal Cahal B. Daly of 
Ireland dedicated the Salamanca Ar-
chives at the college in his honor and 
in 2001 when Cardinal Desmond Connell 
conferred upon him the Gold Medal of 
St. Patrick. 
John received many accolades during 
his lifetime. He was awarded an LL.D. 
by his alma mater, St. Vincent College, 
and The Legal Intelligencer’s 2015 Life-
time Achievement Award. His greatest 
achievement and source of pride was 
his family. Those fortunate enough to 
receive John’s oversized holiday card 
every year were treated to references 
to his children and their families and 
candid images of each one of his grand-
children. The passing of John M. El-
liott is a terrible loss for his wife, Ei-
leen; his brother Thomas and sister 
Margaret Mary; his children, Jack, 
Heather, Kirwan, Kyle, and Thomas; 
his 14 grandchildren; and the rest of his 
family and many friends as they mourn 
his loss. His death is also a loss for our 
Commonwealth. May he rest in peace.∑

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–13. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of New Mexico re-
questing the United States Congress to for-
ward fund the Bureau of Indian Education 
Higher Education Grant Program; to the 
Committee on Indian Affairs. 
SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL 1 
Whereas, the Bureau of Indian Affairs oper-
ates the Higher Education Grant Program as 
authorized by the Snyder Act and provides 
higher education scholarships; and 
Whereas, numerous Indian Tribes admin-
ister the Higher Education Grant Program 
through Public Law 93–638 Self-Determina-
tion contracts or through Public Law 100–472 
Self-Governance compacts; and 
Whereas, the Federal Government rou-
tinely operates under continuing resolutions, 
which results in delayed funding to the Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs; consequently, pay-
ment of college scholarships and institu-
tional disbursements are delayed; and 
Whereas, this is problematic for Indian col-
lege students who depend on these scholar-
ship payments to pay for tuition, books and 
room and board; all too often, Indian stu-
dents arrive on campus with little or no 
money; and 
Whereas, there is precedent for Forward 
Funding of Federal Indian Education Pro-
grams in that Bureau of Indian Education 
Kindergarten through Twelfth Grade schools 
and tribally controlled colleges and univer-
sities have been Forward Funded; and 
Whereas, Forward Funding is a budget au-
thority that is made available for obligation 
in the last quarter of the Fiscal Year for the 
financing of ongoing activities during the 
next Fiscal Year; and 
Whereas, Forward Funding achieves two 
outcomes: it provides funding for two years 
in advance and makes funds available on 
July 1 of each year, and it shields the Grant 
Program from government shutdowns, which 
allows Tribes to disburse grant funds ahead 
of the Academic Year: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved by the Legislature of the State of 
New Mexico, That the New Mexico Legisla-
ture request the United States Congress to 
take affirmative steps to Forward Fund the 
Higher Education Grant Program of the Bu-
reau of Indian Education; and be it further 
Resolved, that copies of this memorial be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President of 
the United States Senate, the New Mexico 
Congressional Delegation, the Tribal Leader-
ship of all twenty-three Indian Nations, 
Tribes and Pueblos in New Mexico and the 
Secretary of Indian Affairs. 
POM–14. A memorial adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Mexico urging the 
United States Congress, the President of the 
United States, and members of the New Mex-
ico Congressional Delegation to address re-
ducing 
the 
‘‘Cliff 
Effect’’ 
and 
ending 
generational poverty; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
SENATE MEMORIAL 19 
Whereas, everyone should have the oppor-
tunity to work hard and achieve family eco-
nomic security, and economic independence 
should be rewarded; and 
Whereas, however, some policies are insuf-
ficient and inadvertently keep hard-working 
parents from climbing the economic ladder, 
according to a New Mexico voices for chil-
dren report; and 
Whereas, hard-working families with fewer 
resources may need work supports to help 
them cover basic necessities, such as food, 
child care or health care, until these families 
can be financially self-sufficient; and 
Whereas, most government safety-net pro-
grams, such as child support, income assist-
ance, health coverage and food assistance, 
have a ‘‘cliff effect’’; and 
Whereas, the cliff effect occurs when a 
household loses eligibility for public assist-
ance once a family’s income surpasses the 
threshold set by the federal poverty guide-
lines; and 
Whereas, in many cases, the value of a lost 
or reduced benefit can exceed an increase in 
wages; and 
Whereas, families often find themselves 
working harder and earning more but unable 
to get ahead; and 
Whereas, the cliff effect is particularly 
devastating when it applies to child care as-
sistance, because child care is one of the 
most significant costs in a household budget; 
and 
Whereas, the cliff effect occurs when an in-
crease in income is enough to disqualify a 
family from receiving the work support ben-
efit but is not enough to cover the cost of the 
lost benefit; and 
Whereas, there are some concerns that in-
creasing income would have the unintended 
consequence of a family losing child care as-
sistance and other benefits when the family’s 
income surpasses the income eligibility ceil-
ing; and 
Whereas, the cliff effect is creating a per-
manent class of workers caught in the di-
lemma of how to pay for competing needs, 
such as food, child care, housing, medication 
and other essential goods and services while 
trying to get ahead; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New 
Mexico, that the president of the United 
States, the New Mexico congressional dele-
gation and all other members of congress be 
urged to address reducing the cliff effect and 
ending generational poverty; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That the federal government be 
urged to create policies that would reduce

POM–15. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-
kota urging the President of the United 
States and the Department of Homeland Se-
curity not to transfer illegal aliens to North 
Dakota; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3048 
Whereas, the United States is a nation 
that values law and order; and 
Whereas, a crisis exists at the southern 
border of the United States, involving an un-
known number of illegal aliens entering the 
United States without authorization; and 
Whereas, media reports have asserted 
North Dakota is being considered by United 
States Department of Homeland Security of-
ficials as a potential site for the relocation 
of illegal aliens detained at the south Texas 
border; and 
Whereas, accepting illegal aliens or assist-
ing in propagation of illegal immigration, 
amidst the SARS–CoV–2 (COVID–19) pan-
demic, may harm the health, safety, and wel-
fare of North Dakota citizens and may im-
pose an unnecessary fiscal burden on those 
citizens; and 
Whereas, in a letter to the United States 
Department of Homeland Security Secretary 
Alejandro Mayorkas dated March 23, 2021, 
Governor Doug Burgum stressed his adminis-
tration’s opposition to the transfer of de-
tained illegal aliens from the southern bor-
der to North Dakota, stating ’While our 
state willingly participates in the resettle-
ment of legal, thoroughly vetted refugees, we 
strongly oppose any efforts to alleviate the 
southern border crisis of the overwhelming 
influx of migrants by transporting them to 
northern border states such as North Da-
kota’’; and 
Whereas, Governor Burgum’s letter further 
stated, ’We urge the administration to ad-
dress this crisis at the source, fully enforce 
federal 
immigration 
laws, 
and 
reassure 
northern border states that relocation is not 
on the table’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
North Dakota, the Senate Concurring Therein: 
That the Sixty-seventh Legislative Assem-
bly joins Governor Burgum and his adminis-
tration in opposing any efforts to transfer il-
legal aliens who entered the United States 
without authorization to North Dakota; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the Sixty-seventh Legisla-
tive Assembly urges the President of the 
United States and the Department of Home-
land Security not to transfer illegal aliens to 
North Dakota; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of State for-
ward copies of this resolution to the Presi-
dent of the United States, the United States 
Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, the 
United States House of Representatives Ma-
jority and Minority Leaders, the Speaker of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
the secretary of the United States Senate, 
the clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the United States Department 
of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro 
Mayorkas, and to each member of the North 
Dakota Congressional Delegation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2521 
May 13, 2021 
POM–16. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of North Da-
kota urging the United States Congress to 
temporarily amend cargo carrying truck 
length and weight restrictions on state high-
ways and interstates that are a part of the 
National Network to allow North Dakota 
and surrounding states to conduct a road 
train pilot program and to permanently 
amend the restrictions to allow road trains 
and the national network highways and 
interstates if the pilot program is successful; 
to the Committee on Environment and Pub-
lic Works. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 3001 
Whereas, the National Network is an ap-
proved network of state highways and inter-
states in the United States for use by large 
trucks and commercial truck drivers; and 
Whereas, the National Network supports 
interstate commerce by regulating the size 
of trucks operating on the National Network 
through a federal cargo carrying length limi-
tation of approximately 100 feet depending 
on truck configuration and a federal cargo 
carrying weight limitation of approximately 
80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight; and 
Whereas, grandfathered provisions in oper-
ation in the state at the time federal regula-
tions were enacted provide trucks in North 
Dakota may be up to 110 feet in overall 
length and 105,500 pounds gross vehicle 
weight on permissible routes; and 
Whereas, trucks operating on the 129,000 
pound Limited Transportation Network may 
be up to 129,000 pounds gross vehicle weight 
on certain routes; and 
Whereas, the United States is experiencing 
a shortage of approximately 900,000 truck 
drivers with commercial driver’s licenses; 
and 
Whereas, railroad infrastructure has di-
minished by approximately 40 percent be-
tween 1920 and 2017, from 5,400 miles of track 
to 3,330 miles of track; and 
Whereas, it is becoming more difficult to 
meet increasing demands for freight and 
commodities in a timely and efficient man-
ner due, in part, to the shortage of commer-
cial truck drivers and the reduced railroad 
infrastructure; and 
Whereas, a road train is a trucking vehicle 
consisting of two or more connected trailers 
or semitrailers linked and hauled by a single 
operating prime mover or tractor unit which 
may exceed overall length and total gross ve-
hicle weight limitations, but not exceed cur-
rent statutory axle load limitations; and 
Whereas, Australia uses road trains to 
move freight in an efficient manner to meet 
demand; and 
WHEREAS, allowing road trains to exceed 
federal truck length and total gross vehicle 
weight limitations may be a viable solution 
to the efficiency and capacity issues result-
ing from the shortage of commercial truck 
drivers and reduced railroad infrastructure 
by allowing commercial truck drivers to 
haul more freight in longer and heavier 
cargo loads: Now, therefore, be it 
RESOLVED by the house of representatives of 
North Dakota, the Senate concurring therein: 
That the Sixty-seventh Legislative Assem-
bly urges the Congress of the United States 
to temporarily amend cargo carrying truck 
length and weight restrictions on state high-
ways and interstates that are a part of the 
National Network to allow North Dakota 
and surrounding states to conduct a road 
train pilot program and to permanently 
amend the restrictions to allow road trains 
on the National Network highways and 
interstates if the pilot program is successful; 
and be it further Resolved, 
That the Secretary of State forward copies 
of this resolution to the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, the 
President Pro Tempore of the United States 
Senate, and each member of the North Da-
kota Congressional Delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. COONS, Mr. LEAHY, 
Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. LUJA´ N, and 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND): 
S. 1611. A bill to amend title 10, 
United States Code, to improve the re-
sponses of the Department of Defense 
to sex-related offenses, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Armed 
Services. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to reintroduce the ‘I Am Vanessa 
Guille´n 
Act’ 
that 
addresses 
long-
standing systemic problems in the way 
that the military responds to sexual 
harassment and sexual assault. I thank 
Representative SPEIER and Representa-
tive MULLIN for reintroducing this im-
portant legislation in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 
Army Specialist Vanessa Guille´n dis-
appeared from her Fort Hood, Texas, 
Army base in April 2020. Tragically, 
last June, Fort Hood officials con-
firmed that remains found near the 
Leon River in Bell County, Texas, were 
Vanessa’s. Vanessa had told other sol-
diers at Fort Hood that she was being 
sexually harassed and confided to her 
family that the perpetrator was a fel-
low Army Soldier. A separate fellow 
Soldier 
was 
suspected 
of 
beating 
Vanessa to death with a hammer, and 
then, 
with 
his 
girlfriend, 
dis-
membering, 
burning, 
and 
burying 
Vanessa’s body about 30 miles from 
Fort Hood. This other Soldier—the sus-
pect in question—fatally shot himself 
when confronted by authorities for 
questioning off post. His girlfriend has 
been charged in federal court with con-
spiracy to tamper with evidence. 
The Army finally acknowledged that 
Vanessa did report being sexually har-
assed by a superior in her chain of com-
mand in the months leading up to her 
murder. Vanessa’s family has called for 
changes to how the military handles 
reports of sexual harassment and as-
sault and has asked for a law to allow 
a third-party investigative team to 
look into reports of sexual harassment 
within the military. They are right to 
demand better from the military—as 
should we all. 
Despite on-going efforts to root out 
the toxic culture of sexual harassment 
and sexual assault in the military, it is 
still very much alive. And that’s not 
just my opinion—the Army itself has 
confirmed that sad fact in recent 
months following their release in De-
cember 2020 of the Fort Hood Inde-
pendent Review Committee Report, 
which shockingly included as one of its 
findings that the Command Climate at 
Fort Hood has been permissive of sex-
ual harassment and sexual assault. 
How long will victims of sexual har-
assment and assault continue to be 
afraid to report their abusers? It seems 
that the military justice system is 
rather the military system without 
justice where survivors of these crimes 
cannot have confidence to know that 
their 
reports 
will 
be 
confidential, 
taken seriously, and adjudicated prop-
erly. 
We need to address this injustice 
now. An effective and strong military 
unit is one that relies on the trust be-
tween all members of that unit. Sexual 
harassment and sexual assault have no 
place in our military—they break that 
critical trust. It is a betrayal of every 
Soldier, Sailor, Airman and Marine if 
leaders do not do everything possible 
to eradicate the toxic culture which al-
lows sexual harassment and sexual as-
sault to fester and erode good order 
and discipline within the ranks. 
To ensure our military readiness, we 
need to do everything possible to help 
ensure victims and survivors of these 
heinous crimes are supported, treated 
with respect, and not traumatized 
again, and that their perpetrators are 
held accountable in a military justice 
system they can trust. These are fa-
thers and mothers, daughters and sons, 
sisters and brothers, who have volun-
teered to give the ultimate sacrifice 
when called upon. They should not 
have 
to 
fear 
their 
fellow 
servicemembers at home nor feel that 
when they raise concerns, they are not 
taken seriously. 
Therefore, I am reintroducing the ‘‘I 
Am Vanessa Guille´n Act’’. The provi-
sions in this legislation will move pros-
ecution decisions on sexual assault and 
sexual harassment cases outside of the 
chain of command to an Office of the 
Chief Prosecutor within each military 
service; create a standalone military 
offense for sexual harassment; estab-
lish trained sexual harassment inves-
tigators who are outside of the chain of 
command of the complainant and the 
accused to investigate all claims of 
sexual harassment; implement the rec-
ommendations of the Fort Hood Inde-
pendent Review Committee Report to 
strengthen the independence and effec-
tiveness of the Army’s Sexual Harass-
ment/Assault Response and Prevention 
(SHARP) Program; require both DoD 
and the Comptroller General to con-
duct separate evaluations of the mili-
tary services’ sexual assault prevention 
and response programs; and establish a 
process by which servicemembers can 
make claims for negligence against 
DoD in the case of sexual assault or 
sexual harassment. I was quite pleased 
to hear that DoD’s Sexual Assault 
Independent Review Commission re-
cently released initial recommenda-
tions to the Secretary that tracked 
closely with several of the provisions 
in this legislation: moving prosecution 
decisions on sexual assault and sexual 
harassment cases outside of the chain 
of command to an Office of the Chief 
Prosecutor within each military serv-
ice and requiring all sexual harassment 
allegations to be investigated outside 
the immediate chain of command. 
These changes will encourage sur-
vivors to come forward to report sexual 
assault and sexual harassment, more 
effectively bring justice for survivors, 
and strengthen the ability of the mili-
tary services to protect its most impor-
tant resource—the people who wear the 
uniform of the United States. 
We need to pass the ‘I am Vanessa 
Guille´n Act’ to fix a broken military 
justice system.

SENATE RESOLUTION 213—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
THE UNITED STATES-REPUBLIC 
OF 
KOREA 
RELATIONSHIP 
TO 
SAFEGUARDING 
PEACE 
SECU-
RITY AND PROSPERITY ON THE 
KOREAN 
PENINSULA, 
IN 
THE 
INDO-PACIFIC REGION AND BE-
YOND, 
AND 
WELCOMING 
THE 
VISIT OF PRESIDENT MOON JAE- 
IN TO THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RISCH, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr. ROMNEY) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 213 
Whereas the United States-Republic of 
Korea alliance is the linchpin of peace, secu-
rity, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula 
and in the Indo-Pacific region and is critical 
to close coordination to face the challenges 
posed by the Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea and address future security chal-
lenges; 
Whereas the United States-Republic of 
Korea alliance is rooted in mutual trust, 
shared values, intertwined economic inter-
ests, and generations of people-to-people ties 
through friendship, family, and community 
that, taken together, provides a foundation 
for one of the strongest, most interoperable, 
and dynamic bilateral alliances in the world; 
Whereas the United States and Korea es-
tablished diplomatic relations on May 22, 
1882, with the signing of the Treaty of Peace, 
Amity, Commerce and Navigation; 
Whereas, on October 1, 1953, the Mutual De-
fense Treaty Between the United States and 
the Republic of Korea (5 U.S.T. 2368) was 
signed in Washington with ratification ad-
vised by the Senate on January 26, 1954, and 
the shared commitment to recognize an 
armed attack on either of the Parties as dan-
gerous to the peace and security of the other 
and to ‘‘act to meet the common danger in 
accordance with [each’s] constitutional proc-
esses’’ remains in force today; 
Whereas the United States assures its iron-
clad security commitment to the Republic of 
Korea, including the United States extended 
deterrent underpinned by the full range of 
United States capabilities; 
Whereas the United States-Republic of 
Korea alliance was forged in blood, with 
1,789,000 United States soldiers, sailors, air-
men, and Marines serving in theater during 
the war, of whom 36,574 paid the ultimate 
sacrifice with their lives in defense of free-
dom in the Republic of Korea, including 7,174 
Korean Augmentation to the United States 
Army (KATUSA) soldiers, and over 7,500 
members of the United States Armed Forces 
remain classified by the Department of De-
fense as missing in action; 
Whereas casualties of the Republic of 
Korea were more than 217,000 soldiers killed, 
more than 291,000 wounded, and over 1,000,000 
civilians killed or missing; 
Whereas 2021 marks the 68th anniversary of 
the cessation of hostilities in the Korean 
War and the signing of the Armistice Agree-
ment on July 27, 1953, which remains in force 
today and that by its terms has neither for-
mally ended the Korean War nor constituted 
a permanent settlement of peace on the Ko-
rean Peninsula; 
Whereas, according to section 2 of the Ko-
rean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Re-
membrance Act (Public Law 114–230; 130 
Stat. 947), a Wall of Remembrance is cur-
rently being added to the Korean War Vet-
erans Memorial with the names of those that 
died in theater, are listed as missing, or were 
prisoners of war, and would also list the 
number of members of the KATUSA who 
were killed in action, wounded in action, 
prisoners of war, or are listed as missing in 
action; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea, in an ex-
traordinary gesture of lasting gratitude, has 
contributed to the construction of the Wall 
of Remembrance, which will serve as an eter-
nal reminder for generations to come of the 
sacrifices made by the United States and Re-
public of Korea alliance in defense of free-
dom and regional security; 
Whereas the United States-Republic of 
Korea Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meet-
ing (2+2) met on March 18, 2021, in Seoul and 
reaffirmed that ‘‘the ROK-U.S. Alliance, 
forged in blood on the battlefield 70 years 
ago, serves as the linchpin of peace, security, 
and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and 
the Indo-Pacific region’’; 
Whereas a new, six-year Special Measures 
Agreement (SMA) was initialed on the same 
day in the presence of the secretaries and 
ministers and was later signed on April 8, 
2021; 
Whereas the United States and the Repub-
lic of Korea are committed to pursuing 
closely 
coordinated 
diplomatic 
efforts 
through a shared strategy to achieve the 
complete, 
verifiable, 
and 
irreversible 
denuclearization of North Korea and estab-
lishing peace on the Korean Peninsula; 
Whereas 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony 
Blinken stated that the United States-Re-
public of Korea relationship is ‘‘rooted in 
mutual trust, in shared values, deeply inter-
twined economic interests, and, of course— 
and maybe most important—generations of 
family and community ties and having one 
another’s back in the most difficult times’’; 
Whereas Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin 
stated the United States-Republic of Korea 
alliance is ‘‘ironclad’’ and ‘‘among the 
strongest bilateral, interoperable, and dy-
namic alliances in the world’’, further stat-
ing that ‘‘the United States remains fully 
committed to the defense of the Republic of 
Korea, using the full range of U.S. capabili-
ties, including our extended deterrent’’; 
Whereas, on April 2, 2021, the United 
States-Republic of Korea-Japan Trilateral 
National Security Advisors meeting took 
place at the United States Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Maryland, and also on May 5, 
2021, a Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ meeting 
took place in London ‘‘to consult on the 
United States’ review of its North Korea pol-
icy and to discuss issues of common concern 
including Indo Pacific security’’; 
Whereas, according to the joint press 
statement, ‘‘the national security advisors 
shared their concerns about North Korea’s 
nuclear and ballistic missile programs and 
reaffirmed their commitment to address and 
resolve these issues through concerted tri-
lateral 
cooperation 
towards 
denuclearization’’ and further ‘‘agreed on the 
imperative for full implementation of rel-
evant UN Security Council resolutions by 
the 
international 
community, 
including 
North Korea, preventing proliferation, and 
cooperating to strengthen deterrence and 
maintain peace and stability on the Korean 
Peninsula’’; 
Whereas a robust and effective trilateral 
relationship between and among the United 
States, the Republic of Korea, and Japan is 
critical for joint security and interests in de-
fending freedom and democracy, upholding 
human rights, promoting peace, security, 
and the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific and 
across the globe, championing women’s em-
powerment, and combating and adapting to 
complex environmental challenges; 
Whereas Secretary Blinken said during a 
March 17, 2021, meeting with Republic of 
Korea Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong that 
‘‘the authoritarian regime in North Korea

continues to commit systematic and wide-
spread abuses against its own people. We 
must stand with people demanding their fun-
damental rights and freedoms and against 
those who repress them.’’. 
Whereas the American and Korean people 
share deeply rooted values of defending free-
dom, championing economic and social op-
portunity and inclusion, upholding human 
rights, and respecting the rule of law; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea is the 
United States’ sixth largest goods trading 
partner with $134,000,000,000 in total (two 
way) goods trade and $34,600,000,000 in total 
services trade for a combined $168,600,000,000 
during 2019 and, according to the Depart-
ment of Commerce, United States exports of 
goods and services to the Republic of Korea 
supported an estimated 358,000 United States 
jobs in 2015; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea is one of 
the United States’ top sources of Foreign Di-
rect 
Investment 
(FDI), 
which 
totaled 
$61,800,000,000 in 2019 (up 9.2 percent over the 
previous year) and supports more than 74,000 
United States jobs in key sectors including 
auto components, industrial equipment, con-
sumer electronics, software and IT services, 
renewable energy, and electronic compo-
nents that are all critical to helping protect 
the United States supply chain as well as 
foster leadership in a green technology fu-
ture; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea made sig-
nificant contributions to the global commu-
nity in combating COVID–19, including the 
manufacture and export of Reverse Tran-
scription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT– 
PCR) test kits to the United States Govern-
ment and various state governments, as well 
as the donation of 2,000,000 masks to help fill 
shortages in hospitals most impacted by 
COVID–19 and an additional 500,000 masks 
that were distributed to Korean War vet-
erans throughout the United States; 
Whereas the strength of the United States- 
Republic of Korea relationship is due in large 
part to the nearly 2,000,000 Korean Ameri-
cans that have made significant contribu-
tions to every facet of American society and 
leadership to now include four members of 
the House of Representatives, Andy Kim of 
New 
Jersey, 
Young 
Kim 
of 
California, 
Marilyn 
Strickland 
of 
Washington, 
and 
Michelle Steel of California; and 
Whereas, in May 2021, President Moon Jae- 
in will visit the United States at the invita-
tion of President Joe Biden: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) welcomes President Moon Jae-in to the 
United States;

States-Republic of Korea relationship as the 
linchpin to safeguarding peace, security, and 
prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in

strengthen, broaden, and deepen the ironclad 
United States-Republic of Korea alliance, in-

tions, and to stand together for the common 
values and shared interests that unite us; 
(5) calls for continued cooperation between 
the Governments of the United States and 
the Republic of Korea in the promotion of 
human rights; 
(6) commits to continuing and expanding

214—SUP-
PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
MAY 13, 2021, AS ‘‘NATIONAL SEN-
IOR FRAUD AWARENESS DAY’’ 
TO 
RAISE 
AWARENESS 
ABOUT 
THE 
INCREASING 
NUMBER 
OF 
FRAUDULENT SCAMS TARGETED 
AT 
SENIORS 
IN 
THE 
UNITED

PLEMENTATION OF POLICIES TO

HAPPENING, AND TO IMPROVE 
PROTECTIONS 
FROM 
THOSE 
SCAMS FOR SENIORS 
Ms. 
COLLINS 
(for 
herself, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, Mr. CASEY, Mr. SCOTT of South 
Carolina, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. SCOTT of Flor-
ida, Mr. HAWLEY, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. 
WARNOCK, and Ms. ROSEN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 214 
Whereas millions of individuals age 65 or 
older (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘sen-
iors’’) in the United States are targeted by 
scams each year, including Social Security 
impersonation scams and Internal Revenue 
Service impersonation scams, sweepstakes 
scams, romance scams, computer tech sup-
port scams, grandparent scams, debt collec-
tion scams, home improvement scams, fraud-
ulent investment schemes, pet scams, and 
identity theft; 
Whereas other types of fraud perpetrated 
against seniors include Medicare imperson-
ation fraud, health care fraud, health insur-
ance fraud, counterfeit prescription drug 
fraud, funeral and cemetery fraud, ‘‘anti- 
aging’’ product fraud, telemarketing fraud, 
and internet fraud; 
Whereas scammers are, as of the date of 
adoption of this resolution, exploiting the 
ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) 
pandemic to prey on seniors through a vari-
ety of scams, including Economic Impact 
Payment scams, vaccine scams, test kit 
scams, contact tracing scams, work-from- 
home scams, and COVID–19 vaccine survey 
scams; 
Whereas the Government Accountability 
Office has estimated that seniors lose a stag-
gering $2,900,000,000 each year to an ever- 
growing 
array 
of 
financial 
exploitation 
schemes and scams; 
Whereas, since 2013, the Fraud Hotline of 
the Special Committee on Aging of the Sen-
ate has received more than 10,000 complaints 
reporting possible scams from individuals in 
all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; 
Whereas the ease with which criminals 
contact seniors through the internet and 
telephone 
increases 
as 
more 
creative 
schemes emerge; 
Whereas, according to the Consumer Sen-
tinel Network Data Book 2020 released by 
the Federal Trade Commission, people age 60 
or older reported losing $592,000,000 to fraud 
in 2020, with a median loss for victims age 80 
or older of $1,300, nearly 4 times the median 
amount lost by those victims between the 
ages of 50 and 59; 
Whereas senior fraud is underreported by 
victims due to shame, stigma, and lack of in-
formation about where to report fraud; and 
Whereas May 13, 2021, is an appropriate day 
to establish as ‘‘National Senior Fraud 
Awareness Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 13, 2021, 
as ‘‘National Senior Fraud Awareness Day’’; 
(2) 
recognizes 
National 
Senior 
Fraud 
Awareness Day as an opportunity to raise 
awareness about the barrage of scams that 
individuals age 65 or older (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘seniors’’) in the United States 
face in person, by mail, on the phone, and 
online; 
(3) recognizes that law enforcement, con-
sumer protection groups, area agencies on 
aging, and financial institutions all play 
vital roles in— 
(A) preventing the proliferation of scams 
targeting seniors in the United States; and 
(B) educating seniors about those scams; 
(4) encourages— 
(A) the implementation of policies to pre-
vent scams targeting seniors; and 
(B) the improvement of efforts to protect 
seniors from those scams; and 
(5) honors the commitment and dedication 
of the individuals and organizations that 
work tirelessly to fight against scams tar-
geting seniors.

tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 215 
Whereas Federal, State, local, and Tribal 
police officers, sheriffs, and other law en-
forcement officers across the United States 
are charged with— 
(1) protecting and serving their commu-
nities and the public; 
(2) pursuing justice for all individuals; and 
(3) performing the duties of a law enforce-
ment officer with fidelity to the constitu-
tional and civil rights of the public the offi-
cers serve; 
Whereas law enforcement officers swear an 
oath to uphold the public trust even though, 
through the performance of the duties of a 
law enforcement officer, the officers may be-
come targets for senseless acts of violence; 
Whereas, through a pandemic and at the 
cost of their own lives, law enforcement offi-
cers have continued to bravely meet the call 
of duty to ensure the security of their neigh-
borhoods and communities; 
Whereas the resolve to service is clearly 
demonstrated by law enforcement officers 
across the United States who have tragically 
fallen ill as a result of, or passed away due to 
complications from, COVID–19 contracted in 
the line of duty; 
Whereas, in 1962, President John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy signed Public Law 87–726 (36 U.S.C. 
136) (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Joint Resolution’’), which authorizes the 
President to proclaim May 15 of every year 
as Peace Officers Memorial Day in honor of 
the Federal, State, and local officers who 
have been killed, disabled, or otherwise in-
jured in the line of duty; 
Whereas the Joint Resolution also author-
izes the President to designate the week in 
which Peace Officers Memorial Day falls as 
National Police Week; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial, dedicated on October 15, 
1991, is the national monument to honor 
those law enforcement officers who have died 
in the line of duty; 
Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day, 
2021, honors the 306 law enforcement officers,

SENATE RESOLUTION 216—RECOG-
NIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF ALCORN STATE UNIVERSITY, 
THE OLDEST PUBLIC HISTORI-
CALLY BLACK LAND-GRANT UNI-
VERSITY 
IN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Mr. WICKER (for himself and Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry: 
S. RES 216 
Whereas May 13, 2021, marks the 150th an-
niversary of Alcorn State University— 
(1) the oldest public historically Black 
land-grant university in the United States; 
and 
(2) the second-oldest State-supported uni-
versity in the State of Mississippi; 
Whereas the university now known as 
Alcorn State University was founded on May 
13, 1871, in Lorman, Mississippi, as a result of 
efforts in the State to educate the descend-
ants of formerly enslaved individuals; 
Whereas Alcorn State University derives 
its name from the sitting Governor of Mis-
sissippi at the time of its founding, James L. 
Alcorn; 
Whereas Hiram R. Revels, following his 
time in civic life as a United States Senator 
for the State of Mississippi, the first African 
American Senator in the history of the 
United States, served as the first president 
of Alcorn State University; 
Whereas Alcorn State University consist-
ently ranks among the top 25 historically 
Black colleges and universities in the United 
States by U.S. News & World Report; 
Whereas Alcorn State University— 
(1) provides a valuable education in various 
programs of study, including agriculture, 
arts, sciences, business, and education; and 
(2) offers the only nursing program avail-
able at a historically Black college and uni-
versity in the State of Mississippi; 
Whereas a residential living option on the 
campus of Alcorn State University, the 
Medgar Wiley Evers Heritage Village, pays 
tribute to Medgar Evers, the civil rights 
leader and 1952 graduate of Alcorn State Uni-
versity; 
Whereas Alcorn State University alumnus 
Steve McNair led a decorated career in the 
National Football League (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘NFL’’), which began when 
he was drafted third overall in the 1995 NFL 
draft, the highest draft selection for an of-
fensive player from a historically Black col-
lege and university in the history of the 
NFL; and 
Whereas the successes of Alcorn State Uni-
versity are tied to the dedicated leadership 
and faculty who devote their careers to pre-
paring future generations for excellence in 
academics and athletics: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 150th anniversary of 
Alcorn State University, the oldest public 
historically Black land-grant university in 
the United States; and 
(2) celebrates the invaluable contributions 
of Alcorn State University to higher edu-
cation in the United States.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 12, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, this week we 
commemorate ‘‘National Police Week’’ and 
recognize the men and women who serve and 
protect in the law enforcement community. A 
Joint Resolution of Congress established Na-
tional Police Week in 1962. That resolution 
authorized President John F. Kennedy to pro-
claim May 15 as National Peace Officers Me-
morial Day and the calendar week in which 
May 15 falls, as National Police Week. 
In that resolution nearly sixty years ago, 
Congress noted that ‘‘the police officers of 
America have worked devotedly and selflessly 
in behalf of the people of this Nation, regard-
less of the peril or hazard to themselves; and 
. . . have safeguarded the lives and property 
of their fellow Americans.’’ Those words are 
as true today as they were in 1962. 
Over the past year, our law enforcement of-
ficers have endured verbal and physical 
abuse, sometimes from their political leaders. 
Some made the ultimate sacrifice while work-
ing to keep their communities safe. They did 
this while some politicians were calling for 
their departments to be defunded, disbanded, 
or dismantled. They did this while working on 
the front lines during a global pandemic. 
We should not just stand with the Police this 
week, but every week. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the law enforcement of-
ficers in their communities and thank them for 
keeping us all safe.

HONORING AYDNN AUGUSTINE 
KING 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Aydnn Augustine 
King. Aydnn is a very special young woman 
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active 
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 74G, 
and earning the most prestigious award of 
Eagle Scout. 
Aydnn has been very active with her troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Aydnn has been involved with 
scouting, she has not only earned 37 merit 
badges, but also the respect of her family, 
peers, and community. Aydnn has also con-
tributed to her community through her Eagle 
Scout project. Aydnn cleaned out the Maryville 
Middle School Band Storage Room and in-
stalled two floor ceiling shelving units. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Aydnn Augustine King for 
her accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for her efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF ALCORN STATE UNI-
VERSITY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th 
anniversary of Alcorn State University. 
Alcorn University, now referred to as Alcorn 
State University, was founded on May 13, 
1871, in Lorman, Mississippi, resulting from 
Mississippi’s efforts to educate the descend-
ants of formerly enslaved individuals. The uni-
versity is named after James L. Alcorn, who 
was the governor of Mississippi at the time of 
its founding. 
Alcorn is celebrating its 150th year as our 
nation’s first Historically Black Land Grant Uni-
versity and the second-oldest state-supported 
institution of higher learning in Mississippi. 
Alcorn continues to provide a valuable edu-
cation in agriculture, arts, sciences, business, 
education, and offers the only nursing program 
available at a Historically Black College and 
University (HBCU) in the state of Mississippi. 
Not to mention, the institution consistently 
ranks among the top 25 HBCUs in the United 
States by U.S. News & World Report. 
During Reconstruction, Hiram Revels served 
as the first president of Alcorn. He resigned 
his seat as our nation’s first African American 
United States Senator to lead the university. 
One of the residential options on campus, the 
Medgar Wiley Evers Heritage Village, is dedi-
cated to Evers who was a prominent civil 
rights activist and 1952 alumnus of the univer-
sity. 
In addition to notable alumni, Steve McNair, 
led a decorated career in the National Football 
League and was drafted third overall during 
the 1995 National Football League draft. This 
is the highest draft selection for an offensive 
player, from an HBCU, in National Football 
League history. 
The successes of Alcorn State University 
are tied to the dedicated leadership and fac-
ulty who have devoted their careers to pre-
paring future generations for excellence in 
academics as well as athletics. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the 150th anniversary of 
Alcorn State University and the invaluable 
contributions of our country’s first Historically 
Black Land Grant University in higher learning. 
INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
MARI-
JUANA IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED 
HOUSING PARITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Marijuana in Federally Assisted 
Housing Parity Act. My bill would permit the 
use of marijuana in federally assisted housing, 
including public housing and Section 8 hous-
ing, in compliance with the marijuana laws of 
the state where the property is located. 
Individuals living in federally assisted hous-
ing should not be denied admission, or fear 
eviction, for using a legal product. Adult use 
and/or medical marijuana is currently legal in 
36 states and the District of Columbia, and 
over 90 percent of Americans support legal-
ized medical marijuana. Under current federal 
law, users of drugs that are illegal under fed-
eral law, including marijuana, are prohibited 
from being admitted into federally assisted 
housing. Moreover, federal law allows land-
lords to evict residents of federally assisted 
housing for using illegal drugs. 
The federal government has begun to 
change it approach to marijuana. In 2018, the 
Food 
and 
Drug 
Administration 
approved 
Eipdiolex, which is derived from marijuana. 
Eipdiolex is used to treat children who suffer 
from seizures. Notably, the medicine does not 
contain tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the 
psychoactive component in marijuana. For the 
last several years, Congress has prohibited 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) from using 
federal funds to prevent jurisdictions from im-
plementing their medical marijuana laws. This 
bill would similarly allow individuals to use 
marijuana in federally assisted housing in 
compliance with a state’s marijuana laws. 
HUD, like DOJ, should not be allowed to en-
force federal marijuana laws where states 
have taken action to legalize marijuana. 
Under my bill, the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) must also develop 
regulations that restrict smoking marijuana in 
federally assisted housing in the same manner 
and to the same locations as the Secretary re-
stricts smoking tobacco in federally assisted 
housing. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

MSG Emmanuel’s uniformed service cul-
minated on 30 June 2020. She served as a 
personnel specialist, and excelled as a finan-
cial analyst. She was the subject matter expert 
relied upon to prioritize and coordinate funding 
Service Member equipment and travel. Her 
work assisting units and personnel mobilizing 
for numerous deployments for the Pennsyl-
vania National Guard was instrumental. With 
her assistance, units were able to obtain fund-
ing for critical shortages required for various 
missions that supported national disasters, 
Presidential inaugurations, and the Global War 
on Terrorism. 
With great honor and thanks, I’m humbled

reer of Master Sergeant Loretta Ann Emman-
uel in the Pennsylvania National Guard. Her 
commitment, tireless efforts, and faithful serv-
ice to our great Commonwealth and Country

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
JAMES DONAHUE 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of an esteemed 
leader 
in 
Contra 
Costa 
County, 
James 
Donahue, and congratulate him on his retire-
ment. 
In 2013, James was appointed as the 29th 
president of Saint Mary’s College of California 
in Moraga with more than 20 years of experi-
ence in higher education executive leadership. 
He and I both graduated from the College of 
the Holy Cross. From there, James obtained a 
Master of Divinity from Princeton Theological 
Seminary and then earned his Ph.D. in Reli-
gious Social Ethics from the Graduate Theo-
logical Union. James has held numerous lec-
turing, professorial, and administrative posi-
tions at institutions such as Santa Clara Uni-
versity, Boston College, and Georgetown Uni-
versity where he was also the Dean of Stu-
dents and Vice President for Student Affairs. 
From 2000 to 2013, James served as presi-
dent of the Graduate Theological Union, a 
consortium of nine theological schools and af-
filiate centers in Berkeley. During this time, 
James strengthened the schools’ interreligious 
and academic programs. He also oversaw 
campaigns that increased financial support for 
students and established the Center for Is-
lamic Studies. James also worked with Saint 
Mary’s College administrators and was an ad-
visory board member of the Center for En-
gaged Religious Pluralism. In addition to his 
work in higher education, James has also 
served as an ethics consultant for the Levi 
Strauss Corporation, the Department of De-
fense, and the Catholic Health Association. 
As President of Saint Mary’s College, 
James has led with a commitment to the high-
est quality education in conjunction with a 
focus on diversity, inclusion, and religious de-
velopment. He is the first layperson to serve 
as president in the university’s 150-year his-
tory and has successfully carried on the leg-
acy of the Lasallian core principles. 
I wish James well in his retirement and 
thank him for his enduring commitment to the 
education of our students. Please join me in 
honoring James Donahue for his many con-
tributions to our community.

MAKING 
UNIVERSAL 
HEALTH 
CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS A 
REALITY 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, since its 
creation in 1965, Medicare has provided 
health insurance and access to quality health 
care for hundreds of millions of Americans 
over the age of 65. Since then Congress has 
worked to ensure that Medicare is adapting to 
meet the needs of the American people. In 
1972, Medicare benefits were extended to 
people under 65 years with long-term disabil-
ities. Hospice care was added in 1982. And, a 
prescription drug benefit was added in 2003. 
In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which 
I strongly supported, strengthened Medicare 
coverage for preventive care and reduced pa-
tient liability for prescription drug costs. 
Currently, 44 million Americans—15 percent 
of the U.S. population—are enrolled in Medi-
care. While not perfect, Medicare is without a 
doubt one of the most successful, lifesaving, 
and life improving programs ever established 
by the federal government. Throughout my ca-
reer in Congress I have fought to protect 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security be-
cause these safety net programs provide es-
sential health and economic support that is 
often the difference between a person living in 
poverty or living a quality life with dignity. 
After enduring the COVID–19 pandemic for 
the past 14 months, there can be no doubt 
that health care for the American people must 
be considered a right, not a privilege. Access 
to quality, affordable health care is essential to 
our individual well-being, our families, our 
community, and our economy. Because uni-
versal access to quality health care must be 
considered a right, last month I introduced H. 
J. Res. 44—an amendment to the U.S. Con-
stitution guaranteeing health care for all Amer-
icans. Until it is enshrined in the Constitution, 
I believe we will continue to have a health 
care system of winners and losers which will 
cause physical and economic hardship for mil-
lions of Americans. If the COVID–19 pandemic 
has taught us anything, it must be that policy-
makers need to take action to ensure no one 
is left behind, that health disparities are re-
duced, and that a preventable or treatable 
condition should never result in disability, 
death, or economic ruin. 
My commitment is to work to expand health 
care access, improve the quality of care, and 
to ensure that all Americans who need health 
care coverage can have it. I will fight to 
strengthen Medicare and Medicaid. I will work 
to expand the ACA and strengthen its provi-
sions such as protecting those with preexisting 
conditions. And, where I have direct responsi-
bility as a member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, I will work to strengthen TRICARE for 
the roughly 9.6 million enlisted men, women, 
and their families defending our freedom 
worldwide; strengthen the Indian Health Serv-
ice (IHS) which serves roughly 2.56 million 
Native Americans and Alaska Natives with 
unique, specialized health services; and, 
strengthen the Veterans Health Administration 
(VHA) for the millions of men and women who 
have served our nation and deserve the qual-
ity care they’ve been promised. 
There is so much work to be done. Still, too 
many Americans are being left behind. Too 
many people will not have access to quality, 
affordable health care. So, I have come to the 
realization that it is once again time to expand 
access within Medicare. 
I believe that now is the time to start the ar-
duous legislative process of working to provide 
universal coverage to all Americans and the 
best policy option to achieve this goal on the 
table today is the Medicare for All Act (H.R. 
1976). This legislation will provide every Amer-
ican with health coverage, while also elimi-
nating out-of-pocket costs for patients and cut-
ting the cost of prescription drugs. Additionally, 
H.R. 1976 would include vision, dental, hear-
ing, mental health, and substance abuse treat-
ment to ensure comprehensive physical and 
mental health services for all Americans. 
After many discussions over the past few 
years, I want to extend my appreciation to the 
bill’s authors for working with me to address 
the major concerns that I had with previous 
versions of this legislation. In particular, pre-
vious bills would have forced the VHA, 
TRICARE, and IHS to be disbanded and fold-
ed into the same patient population as all 
other Americans. This was unacceptable to 
me based upon long standing commitments 
and obligations that our federal government 
has made to these patient populations. 
With those concerns removed, I am proud 
to co-sponsor H.R. 1976. The goal is now 
clear, let’s work to ensure that every American 
can access guaranteed health care as a right, 
not a privilege. It is my belief that the Medi-
care for All Act is the legislative vehicle that 
can best serve the needs and desires of the 
American people for affordable, quality, and 
universal health care.

REMEMBERING SOCRATES J. 
SPACE 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Socrates J. Space, who 
passed away on Monday, April 26, 2021 at the 
age of 90. 
A child of the Great Depression, Soc was 
born on September 4, 1930, in Dover, Ohio. 
His parents, Zacharias ‘‘Jack’’ and Despina 
(Pardos) Space immigrated to America in the 
early 20th century from the magical Greek is-
land of Ikaria. While growing up in poverty, 
Soc was blessed with a loving and close-knit 
family that endured and overcame hardships 
common to immigrant families during this pe-
riod. 
He shined shoes and set up bowling pins to 
help put bread on the family’s table, starting at 
a very young age. He overcame adversity, 
eventually earning three varsity letters as a 
145–pound defensive lineman for the Dover 
Tornadoes football team and was elected by 
his classmates as Senior Class President of 
the Dover High Class of 1949. 
After graduation, Soc went to work at 
Reeves Mill, where he became a card-carrying 
member of the United Steel Workers before 
being drafted into the Marine Corps. As a Ma-
rine, Soc fought bravely for his country during 
the Korean War. Upon his return, the GI Bill 
enabled him to enlist at The Ohio State Uni-
versity, where he graduated with a degree in 
Political Science. He went on to earn his juris 
doctorate degree from Ohio State before re-
turning to Dover, embarking on a successful 
legal career in Tuscarawas County that would 
span five decades. 
In addition to his private legal practice, Soc 
served as Judge of the Tuscarawas County 
Court Southern Division and worked for many 
years as an attorney for the State of Ohio De-
partment of Transportation. He also served as 
Special Counsel to three Ohio Attorney Gen-
erals. He developed exceptional oratory skills 
that, combined with his personable nature, 
wooed juries on behalf of his many clients 
over the years. 
His rich voice and gift for public speaking 
helped him excel in Toastmasters; and served 
as a foundation for his important work in poli-
tics. He was very active in the Tuscarawas 
County Democratic Party, serving two sepa-
rate stints as County Chairman, and he pro-
vided guidance and support for countless poli-
ticians at the local, statewide, and national lev-
els. He was a proud delegate at the 1988 
Democratic Convention for the Presidential 
campaign of fellow Greek-American, Michael 
Dukakis, Soc’s crowning political achievement 
involved helping elect his son, Zack, to Con-
gress in 2006. Soc’s charming intellect and 
fierce loyalty won him the adoration of count-
less friends, clients, politicians, and even polit-
ical and legal adversaries. 
Soc was a multidimensional man of many 
talents. His artistic flair was manifested in 
beautiful pottery and sculptures, and helped 
inspire his daughter Stephanie’s devotion to 
the arts. His love for politics and knack for the 
law continue with Zack. Upon his retirement 
from the practice of law in 2008, Soc re-
mained active, particularly in politics. In 2018, 
he accompanied Zack on a statewide cam-
paign for Ohio Auditor that saw him log over 
100,000 miles, visiting counties, cities and vil-
lages across Ohio, serving a vital role in an 
exhausting political endeavor. Soc, who turned 
89 that year, never once tired from the de-
mands of that campaign despite suffering from 
a debilitating medical condition. 
He is survived by his daughter, Stephanie 
Space (Tom Johnson); his son, former Con-
gressman Zack Space; his special friend and 
caregiver, Erin Noviski; his sister and Matri-
arch of the Space family, Mary Smith; his 
grandchildren, Gina (Tyler Tompkins) and Nick 
Space, and Socrates, Alex (Kadi) and Leo 
Incarnato; and his great-granddaughters, Vio-
let Incarnato and Stella Tompkins. He is also 
survived by nieces and nephews, Denise Hol-
lister, Zack (Jean) Space, Athena 
(Ron) Hooker, Pat Johnson, Chris (Bobbi) 
Smith, and Tony (Nancy) Smith; and many 
great- and great-great-nieces and nephews. 
Also surviving are his ‘‘neighborhood son,’’ 
Dave Johns; his former daughter-in-law, Judge 
Mary Space; his former wife, Vicki Space; and 
stepchildren, Wendy Busby, Terri (Eric) Smith, 
and Shannon Croley; and step-grandchildren, 
Travis (Erika) Smith, Sam Smith, Casey (Jo-
seph) Emery, Ben and Bryan Croley; and

HONORING 
EMILY 
LANG, 
KRISTOPHER 
ROLLINS, 
LEAH 
WAUGHTAL-MAGIERA, 
AND 
JALESHA JOHNSON AS IOWANS 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Emily Lang and Kristopher Rollins, the 
cofounders of RunDSM, as well as Leah 
Waughtal-Magiera and Jalesha Johnson as 
Iowans of the Week. April is National Poetry 
Month, and Emily and Kristopher have given 
students in the Des Moines Public Schools 
system an opportunity to express and better 
themselves through poetry, spoken word, and 
open mic through their programs at RunDSM. 
RunDSM provides marginalized students ac-
cess to a culturally conscious curriculum, 
urban art forms, and opportunities for student- 
centered community activism through the dif-
ferent programs they offer such as ‘‘Movement 
515,’’ ‘‘Urban Leadership Summit,’’ and ‘‘Mi-
norities on the Move.’’ Through Emily and 
Kristopher’s leadership, they have been able 
to create a representative, culturally conscious 
climate within Des Moines Public Schools. 
When Emily and Kristopher first came to the 
Des Moines Public Schools system, they had 
no idea what their experience would evolve 
into. Ten years later they have built a coalition 
of hundreds of students who have been im-
pacted by RunDSM. The program was so in-
spiring for Leah and Jalesha they decided to 
come back and help run the program and turn 
it into what it is today. Students say that 
RunDSM has been a medium to discover and 
express their voices. 
National Poetry Month is a great opportunity 
to highlight some of the incredibly talented and 
creative minds in Iowa. Emily, Kristopher, 
Leah, Jalesha, and everyone at RunDSM truly 
inspire students to find their voices and show 
them how powerful it can be. I will continue to 
fight in Congress for programs like RunDSM 
and advocates like Emily and Kristopher who 
invest in our students and make them better 
people through poetry. It is my honor to recog-
nize them as Iowans of the Week.

IN HONOR OF RAUDE RAYCHEL 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate my constituent, Raude Rayche, 
for becoming a citizen of the United States of 
America on January 29, 2021. Raychel has 
established 
herself 
as 
a 
pillar 
of 
her 
Somersworth community, and committed her 
life to bringing together her neighbors in 
Somersworth and her Indonesian culture. It is 
with great excitement I celebrate her citizen-
ship to the country we love. 
Raychel’s dedication to the U.S. and to New 
Hampshire started long before becoming a cit-
izen of this country. As the President of the 
Somersworth, NH nonprofit Indonesian Com-
munity Connect (ICC), Raychel designed pro-
grams to educate and engage community 
members in the traditions of her culture. Her 
caring nature and desire to grow her commu-
nity has improved the lives of those living in 
the tri-city area and beyond. 
However, Raychel did not stop there. With 
the help of her many partners Raychel led the 
efforts on the Little Indonesia project. Under

the world’s first Little Indonesia—a cultural at-
traction that will expand educational and eco-
nomic opportunities, and which aims to benefit 
all in my state. New Hampshire is proud to call 
Raychel a resident, and we all benefit from 
her ingenuity and her commitment to her com-
munity. 
I want to recognize Raychel for not just say-
ing the oath of allegiance to her new country, 
but for embodying the very meaning of being 
a citizen. On behalf of my constituents in New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I wel-
come Raychel as an American Citizen and 
celebrate the work she does for the people of 
the Granite State. I thank her for her many 
contributions and continued efforts to improv-
ing the lives of all in our state.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
RENEW-
ABLE ENERGY INVESTMENT ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Renewable Energy Invest-
ment Act. Last Congress’ version of this legis-
lation passed the House in Section 90404 of 
the Moving Forward Act (H.R. 2, 116th Cong.) 
and would allow taxpayers to elect to take 
clean energy credits as a direct payment, rath-
er than a credit against tax. 
For decades, the Production and Investment 
Tax Credits (PTCs and ITCs) have together 
supported substantial expansions in the devel-
opment of clean energy across the United 
States. Despite years of temporary federal tax 
policy, the cost of wind and solar energy gen-
eration has come down significantly, leaving it 
competitive with, and in some cases cheaper 
than, fossil fuel-generated energy. However, 
the COVID–19 pandemic threatened the sec-
tor’s long-term success and continues to have 
visible impacts today. 
The COVID–19 pandemic significantly con-
stricted tax equity markets that are used to fi-
nance renewable energy construction. This 
constriction makes financing the project more 
difficult since tax equity investors may not 
have the tax equity to utilize all the available 
credits, therefore making investment less at-
tractive. With the potential for more available 
credits in the coming years, there may not be 
a robust enough investor base to take full ad-
vantage of available incentives without a direct 
payment option. 
The Renewable Energy Investment Act al-
lows taxpayers to receive a payment for re-
newable energy investments rather than a tax 
credit. Not only does this provide much-need-
ed relief for tax equity markets, it also allows 
taxpayers with little or no tax liability to accel-
erate utilization of these credits and expand 
the pool of eligible investors to additional de-
ployment of renewable energy across the 
country. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to enact this legisla-
tion as part of a comprehensive infrastructure 
and clean energy package. 
HONORING DALYLAH ALEXIS 
RYBOLT 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Dalylah Alexis 
Rybolt. Dalylah is a very special young woman 
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active 
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 74G, 
and earning the most prestigious award of 
Eagle Scout. 
Dalylah has been very active with her troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Dalylah has been involved with 
scouting, she has not only earned 36 merit 
badges, but also the respect of her family, 
peers, and community. Dalylah has also con-
tributed to her community through her Eagle 
Scout project. Dalylah cleaned up Groves 
Cemetery by clearing brush piles and dead 
trees and installed a new telescoping flagpole 
with top solar lighting. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Dalylah Alexis Rybolt for 
her accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for her efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WEEK 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, last week 
we commemorated ‘‘National Correctional Offi-
cers Week’’ and recognize the men and 
women who serve as correctional officers 
across the United States. President Ronald 
Reagan proclaimed the first week in May as 
National Correctional Officers Week thirty- 
seven years ago ‘‘in recognition of the con-
tributions of correctional officers to our Na-
tion.’’ Especially over the past year, we have 
witnessed the substantial contributions of cor-
rectional officers and all law-enforcement offi-
cers in our neighborhoods and communities. 
As we continue to face challenges of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, it is more important 
than ever to recognize the vital work that cor-
rectional officers perform on a daily basis, risk-
ing their lives in the course of carrying out 
their duties. ‘‘Stay-at-home’’ orders do not 
apply to our correctional officers. Public safety 
demands that these brave men and women 
come to work every day. Our nation’s correc-
tional officers did their best to keep them-
selves and those under their custody and care 
safe under these challenging circumstances. 
There are currently over two million people 
incarcerated in jails and prisons throughout 
the United States. Our nation faces a great 
challenge to keep both staff and inmates at 
correctional facilities safe during this pandemic 
and amid radical proposals to defunct law-en-
forcement entities. Correctional officers are an 
integral part of our criminal justice system and 
they play a key role in helping maintain public 
safety. I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the 400,000 correctional officers in 
the United States for the difficult and often 
thankless job that they do day in and day out.

REMEMBERING RHEA K. HALE 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to honor and rec-
ognize the late Rhea K. Hale, a constituent of 
mine, who devoted her career to protecting 
the environment and promoting sustainability. 
Ms. Hale’s determination enabled her to 
forge an impressive career doing what she 
loved. She worked for IBM’s Center for Envi-
ronmentally Conscious Products, the U.S. En-
vironmental Protection Agency, the American 
Forest, and Paper Association, and WestRock. 
She was a respected and well-known voice 
within the industry, as well as a recognized 
authority on issues related to public policy and 
sustainability. 
Ms. Hale had a talent for seeing possibili-
ties, and the vision and persistence to bring 
them to life. She is remembered by her friends 
and colleagues not only as a passionate and 
determined advocate for bettering our planet, 
but also as a kind, thoughtful, caring, and un-
failing friend. 
One of Ms. Hale’s friends noted that ‘‘If you 
walked into a room and Rhea was there, ev-
erything was better.’’ Although our Common-
wealth has lost a wonderful, intelligent person, 
we must reflect on her work and honor her 
legacy. Rhea will be deeply missed by her 
family, her friends, her colleagues, and all 
those whom she touched during her life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in expressing my deepest condolences to 
Ms. Hale’s family, and in honoring her life’s 
work.

HONORING DOMINIC ZURELLA 
HON. TIM RYAN

Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Dominic Zurella, of Canfield, Ohio, 
to thank him for his service to our country and 
to wish him a very happy 100th birthday. 
Mr. Zurella was a Technical Sergeant and 
radio operator during World War II in the U.S. 
Air Force. During the war, he participated in 
26 missions with the 91st Bomb Group, ‘‘The 
Ragged Irregulars,’’ and the 324th Bomb 
Squadron from November 26, 1943 to March 
26, 1944. 
Dominic will be 100 years old on May 23, 
2021 and I salute him on this tremendous 
milestone. Madam Speaker, I ask you and all 
our colleagues to please join me in wishing 
Mr. Zurella a happy birthday and thank him for 
his heroic service to our country.

RECOGNIZING 
PASTOR 
SAMONIA 
WHISONANT 
OF 
MOUNTAIN 
BE 
REMOVED OUTREACH CENTER 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to recognize Pastor Samonia Whisonant for 
achieving the rank of Apostle-Elect. Pastor 
Whisonant’s remarkable work has had an in-
credible impact on our Harrisburg community 
via her efforts with the Mountain Be Removed 
Outreach Center. 
Pastor Whisonant is the co-founder and 
leader of Harrisburg’s (formerly Washington, 
D.C. Mountain Be Removed Outreach Center, 
founded in October 1998. The Center aims to 
be the largest distribution center of food, cloth-
ing, and household supplies in Harrisburg. Al-
though Pastor Whisonant was not raised in 
the church, she was well known for her wis-
dom and sage advice—the same character 
traits that she embodies as she now leads 
God’s people through her work. 
Pastor Whisonant has taught and preached 
God’s Word for over 27 years. She’s com-
mitted to equipping and training developing 
prophets and leaders. Her foundation in min-
istry was birthed through Prison Outreach, 
serving 15 years by empowering and instruct-
ing inmates throughout Maryland. Through her 
selfless work in Maryland’s Montgomery, 
Prince George’s, and Anne Arundel Counties, 
she spread the word of God while also teach-
ing inmates valuable life skills to aid in their in-
tegration back into society. 
Pastor Whisonant has walked in the Office 
of the Prophet for ten years; her tagline: ‘‘Your 
Prophet Through the Process.’’ She’s been 
called to help the Body of Christ reach their di-
vine destiny safely and without missing the 
necessary details that form and develop them 
into becoming mature Apostolic and Prophetic 
people. 
In addition to her work with the Center, she 
is an entrepreneur, author, speaker, mentor 
and 
certified 
aromatherapist. 
Pastor 
Whisonant is the wife of Pastor Carlton 
Whisonant (co-founder M.B.R.O.C.), and the 
mother to two beautiful children, Davon 
Brooks and Elder-Elect Chante Whisonant 
(vice president, M.B.R.O.C.). Her favorite 
scripture is John 10:10, ‘‘I have come that 
they might have life, and that they might have 
it more abundantly.’’ 
I am humbled and privileged to honor Pas-
tor Whisonant as she is recognized as Apos-
tle-Elect. She sets the standard for all to fol-
low. The work of organizations like Mountain 
Be Removed Outreach Center is significant, 
and strengthens our communities and those 
around us. I commend Pastor Samonia 
Whisonant for her tireless, selfless, and faithful 
efforts, and wish her continued Godspeed on 
her journey.

TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL 
KENYON K. BELL 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to honor a superb leader, General 
Kenyon Bell. During my short time as a Mem-
ber of Congress, I have received a warm wel-
come from many people, but none warmer 
than from the great men and women of 
Sheppard Air Force Base. This summer, Gen-
eral Bell will relinquish command of the 82nd 
Training Wing and Installation Command of 
Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. While we 
are sad to see him go, we are excited for his 
future. 
General Bell was given a great opportunity 
to lead in challenging times and did so with 
the highest degree of professionalism, dignity, 
and skill. As the COVID–19 pandemic shut 
down much of our normal day-to-day lives 
across the nation, General Bell found himself 
in command of a mission that could not stop, 
or even slow down, without disastrous and 
long-term consequences for military readiness. 
With more than 5,000 students living in close 
quarters on the base, he acted decisively to 
implement policies and guidelines to ensure 
the safe continuation of both the technical and 
flying training missions at Sheppard. As a re-
sult, operational units around the world contin-
ued receiving the trained, mission-ready Air-
men required to maintain global combat capa-
bility. 
While we faced civil unrest as a country 
over the last year, General Bell led by exam-
ple and worked to build bridges of under-
standing and unity that transcend politics and 
will ultimately strengthen the United States 
military. His ability to speak boldly, frankly, 
and calmly on the highly charged subject of 
race is an example we all must follow. He also 
had a willingness and ability to listen respect-
fully and honestly to differing perspectives. 
While I faced the steep learning curve in-
volved with being a Member of Congress, 
General Bell ensured that I stayed up to date 
with the situation on the ground at Sheppard, 
truly working as a partner. I could not have 
asked for a better partner to work with as I 
began my tenure as a Congressman. 
General Bell’s list of successes is longer 
than many I have seen from a General Officer. 
While navigating a variety of unique chal-
lenges throughout his tenure, he found a way 
to accomplish countless traditional command 
matters. The successful completion of the 
Sheppard Main Gate renovation project, in all 
its complexity, marks the realization of more 
than a decade of effort. More importantly, it 
represents markedly improved security and 
force protection for the missions and people of 
Sheppard Air Force Base. I was honored to be 
there with General Bell in person for the offi-
cial ribbon-cutting ceremony in April. 
Finally, a sure testament to the quality of 
General Bell’s leadership is the fact that 
through all the challenges of 2020 and 2021, 
the 82nd Training Wing was rated as Highly 
Effective by the Air Education and Training 
Command Inspector General following the 
2021 Unit Effectiveness Inspection. 
On behalf of a grateful nation, I extend my 
congratulations to General Bell on completing 
his command tour at Sheppard Air Force 
Base. I thank the General for his exceptional 
leadership and service. I congratulate his wife, 
Lori, and his kids Amira, Kenyon, and Roman. 
I look forward to seeing General Bell continue 
to excel in his career, and I look forward to 
our future years of friendship. We are a better 
and stronger nation for his service.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN PAUL 
JACOBS 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the remarkable life story 
of an American hero, Captain Paul Jacobs 
who passed away this past December. Cap-
tain Paul Jacobs served six combat tours in 
Vietnam, though it was his last tour that for-
ever enshrined him as leading one of the U.S. 
Navy’s greatest humanitarian efforts. 
As U.S. Forces be withdrawing from South 
Vietnam in late April 1975, Captain Jacobs 
was then commanding the destroyer escort 
USS Kirk off the coast of Vietnam. To escape 
being captured by Communist North Viet-
namese forces, South Vietnam helicopters 
loaded with refugees swarmed out toward the 
U.S. fleet. After hearing rumors that any South 
Vietnamese pilot captured by the North Viet-
namese would be tortured, mutilated, and im-
prisoned, while their families would be made 
outcasts or worse, they fled desperately trying 
to escape that fate. 
Upon realizing this, Captain Jacobs offered 
his ship as a safe haven for the South Viet-
namese refugees. Helicopters began arriving 
and all hands aboard the Kirk—including Cap-
tain Jacobs—pushed unloaded helicopters 
over the side to make room for incoming ones. 
In all, 12 helicopters, packed with refugees, 
had landed on one of the Navy’s smallest war-
ships. Captain Jacobs then transformed the 
Kirk into a humanitarian aid station, providing 
food, comfort, medical care, relief from a blaz-
ing sun and hope to the men, women and chil-
dren they’d rescued. It is no exaggeration to

credit Captain Jacobs’ steadfast leadership in 
the face of such hardship for saving the lives 
of those 30,000-plus Vietnamese sailors and 
refugees. 
The United States Navy has a proud tradi-
tion of courageous, competent, indefatigable, 
and independent ship captains, who fear not 
what lies over the horizon, and who earn the 
respect and fidelity of their crews through their 
fair and steadfast leadership. Such will be 
Captain Paul Jacobs’ legacy. In California’s 
Fourth Congressional District and in Captain 
Jacob’s childhood hometown in Maine, we 
share profound grief over his passing. 
And so today, I rise to bid Captain Paul Ja-
cobs—the United States Navy’s most revered 
humanitarian—farewell. May he always have 
fair winds and following seas.

SHARING THE WASHINGTON POST 
OP-ED BY FORMER SEN. JEFF 
FLAKE 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, on Wednes-
day the Republican Conference ejected the 
Gentlelady from Wyoming from the ranks of its 
leadership because she dared to speak truth 
and refused to join in spreading falsehoods re-
garding the recent election. This is a dan-
gerous moment for our democracy, when one 
party is operating according to a set of clearly 
debunked falsehoods and punishes its Mem-
bers who prefer actual facts. To underscore 
that danger, I include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing op-ed, which was published in The 
Washington Post on Tuesday and written by 
the former Republican Senator from Arizona, 
Jeff Flake. I hope all of my colleagues—on 
both sides of the aisle—will read his words 
and consider carefully this perilous moment in 
which our country and this Congress finds 
itself. 
[From the Washington Post, May 11, 2021] 
OPINION: IN
TODAY’S
REPUBLICAN
PARTY, 
THERE IS NO GREATER OFFENSE THAN HON-
ESTY 
(By Former Sen. Jeff Flake (R–AZ)) 
‘‘The further a society drifts from the 
truth, the more it will hate those who speak 
it.’’—George Orwell 
Near the beginning of the document that 
made us free, our Declaration of Independ-
ence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident.’’ 
There you have it. From the very begin-
ning of America, our freedom has been predi-
cated on truth. For without a principled fi-
delity to truth and to shared facts, our de-
mocracy will not last. 
On Wednesday, Rep. Liz Cheney (R–Wyo.) 
will most likely lose her leadership post 
within the House Republican Conference, not 
because she has been untruthful. Rather, she 
will lose her position because she is refusing 
to play her assigned role in propagating the 
‘‘big lie’’ that the 2020 election was stolen 
from Donald Trump. Cheney is more dedi-
cated to the long-term health of our con-
stitutional system than she is to assuaging 
the former president’s shattered ego, and for 
her integrity she may well pay with her ca-
reer. 
No, this is not the plot of a movie set in an 
asylum. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your 
contemporary 
Republican 
Party, 
where 
today there is no greater offense than hon-
esty. 
It seems a good time to examine how we 
got to a place where such a large swath of 
the electorate (70 percent of Republican vot-
ers, according to polling) became willing to 
reject a truth that is so self-evident. 
This allergy to self-evident truth didn’t 
happen all at once, of course. This frog has 
been boiling for some time now. The Trump 
period in American life has been a celebra-
tion of the unwise and the untrue. From the 
ugly tolerance of the pernicious falsehood 
about President Barack Obama’s place of 
birth to the bizarre and fanatical fable about 
the size of inauguration crowds, to the intro-
duction of the term ‘‘alternative facts’’ into 
the American lexicon, the party’s steady em-
brace of dishonesty as a central premise has 
brought us to this low and dangerous place. 
I don’t know what will happen to Cheney 
politically after Wednesday. For me, I knew 
that I couldn’t support Trump’s election or 
reelection after his seminal falsehood about 
Obama’s birth certificate, to say nothing of 
the cascade of untruths, from the trivial to 
the consequential, that followed daily. I had 
hoped that, over time, my Republican con-
stituents would feel differently about the 
former president, or at least value a Repub-
lican who pushed back, and that I could 
stand for reelection in 2018 with a reasonable 
chance of surviving a Republican primary. It 
soon became apparent that Republican vot-
ers wanted someone who was all in with a 
president that I increasingly saw as a danger 
to the republic. That could not be me, so I 
spoke out instead and didn’t stand for reelec-
tion. 
When I became an unwitting dissident in 
my party by speaking in defense of self-evi-
dent truths, I assumed that more and more 
of my colleagues would follow me. I remain 
astonished that so few did. Congresswoman 
Cheney, I know how alone you must be feel-
ing. But just know that history keeps the 
score, not Kevin McCarthy or Elise Stefanik. 
In January 2018, three years before the 
Capitol insurrection, I said the following on 
the Senate floor: ‘‘Mr. President, let us be 
clear. The impulses underlying the dissemi-
nation of such untruths are not benign. They 
have the effect of eroding trust in our vital 
institutions and conditioning the public to 
no longer trust them. The destructive effect 
of this kind of behavior on our democracy 
cannot be overstated.’’ 
Three years later, it’s clear that I didn’t 
know the half of it. The destructive effect of 
the president’s behavior—and the willingness 
of Republican elected officials to indulge, ex-
cuse, defend, justify and, in many cases, just 
roll with it—has taken a devastating toll. 
It is elementary to have to say this, but we 
did not become a great nation by believing 
or espousing nonsense, or by embracing lu-
nacy. And if my party continues down this 
path, we will not be fit to govern. 
Cheney has proved her fitness, and today it 
seems that adherents to the ‘‘big lie’’ will 
cast her out. Hold your head high, congress-
woman. Those of us who believe in American 
democracy and who live in objective reality 
are grateful that you have chosen to take a 
stand for truth—self-evident truth—regard-
less of the consequences.

JOYCE E. SPRINGER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize a very special 
member of the Tarkio Community. Joyce Ellen 
Springer is turning a very independent 90 on 
Sunday. 
Joyce Davenport was born on her Mother 
Helen’s Birthday in 1931 in Fairfax, Missouri. 
She grew up in Fairfax, graduated from high 
school, married her High School Sweetheart, 
Robert Hedrick, had two sons and built a fam-
ily in Fairfax as well. When tragedy struck and 
Robert passed away, she displayed grit and 
self reliance as a true child of Northwest Mis-
souri and the Great Depression. She picked 
herself up, dusted herself off and went from 
housewife to single working mother in a time 
when that was not the norm. Whether she was 
working for the High School Principal as a 
secretary, as the receptionist for the doctor’s 
office or working at the Exchange Bank she 
always met challenges head-on and with a 
warm smile. She was blessed to find another 
great love in Bill Springer who she married in 
1972 and was married to for 43 years until his 
passing in 2015. 
It would be easy to dismiss Joyce’s life as 
common or unremarkable. That would be a 
monstrous error. It would not account for the 
history that she has lived, the character and 
strength she has passed on or love she has 
both given and received. The legacy of Joyce 
Springer is one of her children, step-children, 
grand children and great grand children. Joyce 
has a legacy that anyone should be proud to 
have and it is undeniable proof of a life well 
lived. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in wishing Joyce Ellen Springer a wonder-
ful 90th Birthday. I wish her all the peace, 
happiness and fulfillment that her heart de-
sires, now and in the years to come. I am 
proud to represent her as a citizen of Mis-
souri’s Sixth Congressional District.

CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF 
LITTLE INDONESIA 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the opening of the Little Indo-
nesia in Somersworth, New Hampshire. After 
years of diligent planning, Indonesian Commu-
nity Connect Inc. has made international his-
tory by unveiling this new cultural landmark 
and opening the first Little Indonesia in the 
United States. 
My state is home to a vibrant and wel-
coming Indonesian community seeking to con-
tribute to their home as proud Granite Staters. 
ICC has built strong ties within the community 
and created lasting connections by hosting 
cultural events and offering educational oppor-
tunities for all to attend. The opening of Little 
Indonesia aims to expand on this spirit of to-
getherness, and I am proud to see this project 
come together. As this region emerges from 
the pandemic, Little Indonesia will serve as a 
cultural and community gathering spaces for 
all to enjoy for years to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Indonesian Community Con-
nect Inc., the City of Somersworth, and the 
members of the community who have made 
the Little Indonesia project come to life. Let us 
celebrate this new hub of cultural exchange,

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
SHAHID 
AHMED’S SERVICE TO THE NEW 
DEMOCRAT COALITION 
HON. SUZAN K. DeLBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Shahid Ahmed for his many 
contributions to the New Democrat Coalition. 
This week, Shahid will be leaving the New 
Democrat Coalition after two years of service 
to become New Dem Congressman DONALD 
MCEACHIN’s Communications Director. 
The New Democrat Coalition, which I have 
the honor to Chair, is made up of 94 forward- 
thinking Democrats in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives who are committed to getting 
things done. We represent the expansion of 
the Democratic Party beyond our urban base 
into purple districts and we are key to holding 
the majority. Our focus and composition of 
members, makes our communications team 
critical to the Coalition’s success. 
Shahid joined the New Dem communica-
tions staff as the Staff & Digital Assistant in 
April 2019. Prior to joining the New Dem staff, 
Shahid was a Communications Fellow for 
Congressman JARED HUFFMAN of California 
and a Press Intern for Congressman DONALD 
MCEACHIN of Virginia. In recognition for his 
hard work and digital expertise, he was pro-
moted to Digital and Press Assistant in Janu-
ary 2020 all while pursuing his Master of Arts 
in Communication and Media Studies at The 
Johns Hopkins University. 
Originally serving under former New Demo-
crat Coalition Chair DEREK KILMER, Shahid has 
been an able communications staffer to me 
and many members of the Coalition. Over his 
tenure, the New Democrat Coalition has expo-
nentially grown its digital footprint thanks to 
Shahid’s knowledge of social media platforms, 
digital media, and effective communications. 
Most notably, Shahid created dynamic, cre-
ative content to promote the Coalition’s key 
policy and message priorities. Shahid also 
served as a key digital advisor for New Dem 
Members and their staffs working with them to 
develop compelling ways to reach their con-
stituents on issues that mattered most in their 
districts. Shahid will continue to be a valued 
mentor to communications staff in the New 
Dem family and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the members 
of the New Democrat Coalition, I thank Shahid 
and wish him best of luck. 
REMEMBERING PATRICIA ANN 
PIPINO 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Patricia Ann Pipino of Warren, 
Ohio, who passed away on Thursday, April 
15, 2021 at the age of 83. 
Patricia was born May 8, 1937, the daughter 
of Theodore and Helen Lansing Gabig. She 
graduated from St. Mary’s High School in 
Warren and attended Kent State University. 
Patricia worked at Copperweld Steel until 
her marriage to James S. ‘‘Doc’’ Pipino on 
July 11, 1959. Together they enjoyed 58 years 
of marriage and family life. 
She will be deeply missed by her sons, At-
torney James D. (Mary Jeanine), Theodore S. 
and Attorney Samuel M. (Kimberly Kirtland); 
her daughter, Mary F. ‘‘Mimi,’’ Ph.D.; grand-
children, James A. (Lynsey) Pipino, Elena 
Dean (Michael), Marisa Bell (Michael), Dana, 
Matthew, Daniel, Camille and Lorenzo Pipino 
and Cailin Jaspers; her great-grandchildren, 
Amelia and Clara Dean and Charlotte Pipino; 
her brother and sister-in-law, Dr. Theodore 
and Dr. Cheryl Smith Gabig and numerous 
nieces and nephews. 
In addition to holding her favorite jobs, 
‘‘Mom and ‘‘Nana’’ she also volunteered with 
St. Joseph’s Hospital Women’s Auxiliary, 
Trumbull Mobile Meals, Our Lady of Mt. Car-
mel, Niles Festival, OLMC Home and School 
and John F. Kennedy Moms’ Eagles football 
boosters. 
Patricia also enjoyed golf, tennis, skiing, 
reading and playing bridge. She was staunch 
supporter of the Browns, Indians and Cavs. 
Mrs. Pipino was a member of the Lake Club, 
Trumbull Country Club and Blessed Sac-
rament Parish. She was an owner of Niles 
Restaurant Business, Inc. 
I’m proud to have known Patricia for many, 
as I grew up just down the street from her and 
her family. Her son, Jimmy, was my football 
coach and early supporter. Patricia had a 
strong involvement in the church and touched 
the lives of many. My deepest condolences go 
out to Patricia’s family and friends.

GEORGE FLOYD R.I.P. POEM 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 13, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to include in the RECORD a poem from 
Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, founder and spir-
itual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah in Virginia 
Beach, and the representative of the Jewish 
Community at the City of Chesapeake’s civic 
occasions. 
GEORGE FLOYD R.I.P. 
(By Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman) 
Thank you, George Floyd, for making sure 
That 2020 will be remembered not only for 
An inflicting Coronavirus but even more so 
for a 
Virtuous revolution of the heart inspired by 
an 
Unassuming gentle spirit in a giant’s frame 
Who taught us all—white, black and brown— 
That a simple man, no celebrity, could hope-
fully 
Change the world his loving spirit charged, 
Awakening with divine grace sleepy mul-
titudes, 
Whose last breath of agonizing 9 minutes, 29 
seconds, 
We count sacred with Mr. Floyd becoming 
A household name though not born a prince 
While you wanted just to breath like fellow 
humans 
Gifted by God’s birthright at least another 
day, 
And heavenly mama would gladly wait, 
Destined in death to accomplish 
Unwittingly what you could not alive do. 
Forgotten you will never be roaming with 
angels 
Among the stars to protect dear ones left be-
hind, 
But 
your 
excruciatingly 
aching 
neck 
stomped 
By a bending knee not in homage to the 
gods, 
Is a transforming symbol now for the oppres-
sor’s 
Universal rod which together we are bent to 
break, 
As the dying battle cry, ‘‘Man, I can’t 
breathe’’ 
Will ever ring from Sea to Shining Sea. 
Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is the founder 
and spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah in 
Virginia Beach, meeting at The Church of 
the Holy Apostles. He is honorary senior 
rabbi scholar at Eastern Shore Chapel Epis-
copal Church in Virginia Beach. He rep-
resents the Jewish community at civic 
events in the City of Chesapeake.
