nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by

SMALL BUSINESSES SUSTAIN OUR 
ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong 
support of America’s small businesses. 
Nearly half of American workers are 
employed by small businesses, and 
their livelihoods are being threatened 
by new taxes and new regulations that 
are being proposed by the administra-
tion and liberals in Congress. 
In the past year already, our small 
businesses have been hamstrung by ar-
bitrary lockdown orders that have 
stunted growth and strained our recov-
ery. 
Now they are being squeezed even 
harder by supply chain issues and labor 
shortages caused by President Biden’s 
policy of paying workers to remain at 
home. 
Now the President is refusing to ad-
dress the crisis that his administration 
has caused. 
Recently, I visited Guy Chemical in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The 
supply chain issues that they face have 
delayed shipments for months. 
Problems ranging from backlogs at 
the Port of Los Angeles to a lack of 
truck drivers on our Nation’s highways 
have resulted in shortages and back-
logs that are straining businesses that 
actually hold our communities to-
gether. Small businesses are truly the 
backbone of our economy. 
Let’s be clear: This administration’s 
failed policies are threatening these 
American small businesses. 
To make matters even worse, some 
Members of this body are now threat-
ening to impose new taxes that would 
take as much as 39 percent of revenues 
away from these vital small businesses. 
This wasteful taxation directly harms 
the Americans that work for small 
businesses and rely on them for their 
daily needs and for their paychecks. 
Now is the time to put a stop to this 
tax-and-spend spree. 
Now is the time to stand up for the 
small businesses that truly sustain our 
economy. 
And now is the time to put Ameri-
cans first and not the liberal politi-
cians. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until 2

Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 4 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. FOSTER) at 2 p.m. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Receive our prayers this day, O Lord. 
Receive them and supply us in our 
need. For our prayers reflect the dis-
quiet of our lives, the need for answers, 
the need for encouragement, the need 
for relief from conflict and worry. 
Remind us that what we want can 
only be found in You. You are the 
source of all knowledge, the source of 
our strength, the source of lasting 
peace. 
By Your divine power You have given 
us everything we need to live, and all 
You ask of us is to live a Godly life, a 
life where we refrain from the vain ex-
pectation that our needs can be satis-
fied by anything or anyone but You. 
Give us the will to accept that our 
contentment is found only in You. Give 
us the understanding that Godliness, 
an attitude attuned to Your divine 
power and provision, gains us all we de-
sire. 
So may we direct our restless hearts 
to live a righteous life, that we would 
live contented in the bounty of Your 
righteousness. 
In Your strong and sufficient name 
we pray. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. LAMALFA led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Ms. Kaitlyn 
Roberts, one of his secretaries. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE 
BETTER 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on an urgent mat-
ter confronting our country. 
The American people are experi-
encing the worst series of self-inflicted 
crises in a generation. 
Inflation is at a 40-year high. Gas is 
up 42 percent. Utilities are up 20 per-
cent. 
Either President Biden doesn’t care 
or is being insulated from reality. 
We saw the worst jobs report of the 
Presidency this last month. Self-in-
duced labor shortages are plaguing 
businesses. Shelves are bare. Container 
ships are stacking up. 
We have the worst Biden-created bor-
der crisis in 30 years, yet the President 
has time to go to Delaware every week-
end but not the border? 
Hundreds of Americans are still in 
Afghanistan, 
meanwhile 
President 
Biden and Democrats are trying to ram 
through trillions in new tax hikes. 
So what is the administration work-
ing on? What are their priorities? A na-
tional gender strategy. Are you kid-
ding me? This administration cares 
more about which pronoun you use 
than countering the Chinese threat or 
the threat at our southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people de-
serve better than this. My constituents 
deserve better than this. Our Nation 
deserves better than this. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PEAK FARMS 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, once again 
this year, a local farm in North Caro-
lina’s Fifth District has been selected 
to provide the White House Christmas 
tree. 
Rusty and Beau Estes, the owners of 
Peak Farms in Ashe County, are no 
strangers to this prestigious selection 
process. 
In both 2008 and 2012, Peak Farms 
provided Fraser firs to the White 
House, and in 2018, the farm was se-
lected to deliver the Christmas tree to 
the residence of Vice President Mike 
Pence. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a terrific accom-
plishment, and it represents the best 
that North Carolina has to offer. 
Congratulations to both Rusty and 
Beau. Mr. Speaker, yet again, Rusty 
and Beau have proven that North Caro-
lina’s Fifth District is the premier pro-
vider of Christmas trees throughout 
the country. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE DEPARTURE OF 
RILEY SCOTT 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with bittersweet sentiments. 
I recognize the departure of my legis-
lative 
assistant, 
Riley 
Scott, 
of 
Petaluma, California, to an amazing, 
new adventure. 
Riley has been, in addition to her 
strong work in my office for 2 years, a 
lifetime swimmer and received a full 
ride out of high school to USC where 
she won several PAC–12 championships 
and competed at the top level in the 
NCAA’s. 
I point out this impressive record be-
cause Riley’s new opportunity will be 
competing to represent our country in 
the 2024 Paris Olympics. 
Riley will be training for the wom-
en’s pentathlon, which consists of, of 
course, swimming, horsemanship, a 
combination of running, pistol shoot-
ing, and fencing. 
Now, I told Riley that there is a lot 
of fencing around our ranch that need-
ed to be repaired, but she said that 
wasn’t the same thing. 
I told Riley early on if she ever had 
this type of opportunity post college, 
she had to go out and take that chance 
and do it, and so she is. 
It is a loss for our office and here in 
Congress, but watch as Riley goes for 
the gold as Californians are known to 
do. 
Fight on to victory, Riley Coyote. 
f 
AMERICA’S ENERGY SECURITY IS 
IN JEOPARDY 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden’s radical policies have sty-
mied America’s energy independence 
and created a crisis, unfortunately. 
The national average price for a gal-
lon of gas has climbed to its highest 
level since 2014 and is 66 percent higher 
than it was last year. 
On day one, President Biden de-
stroyed 11,000 American jobs by can-
celing the Keystone Pipeline. 
President Biden paused new domestic 
oil and gas leases, which will cost one 
million American jobs and decrease the 
GDP by $700 billion. 
Instead of allowing American compa-
nies to increase domestic production 
and hire more U.S. workers, President 
Biden 
and 
his 
administration 
has 
pleaded with OPEC and Russia to in-
crease global output to ease rising fuel 
prices. 
Democrats in Congress are pushing a 
multitrillion-dollar spending package, 
which includes a tax hike on fuel. 
These actions jeopardize our Nation’s 
energy security and will increase costs 
for all American families, unfortu-
nately.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

SOVEREIGN DEBT CONTRACT 
CAPACITY ACT 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4111) to require the Secretary of 
the Treasury to direct the United 
States Executive Director at the Inter-
national Monetary Fund to advocate 
that the Fund provide technical assist-
ance to Fund members seeking to en-
hance their capacity to evaluate the 
legal and financial terms of sovereign 
debt contracts, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5839 
October 25, 2021 
SEC. 2. SUPPORT TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
MEMBERS TO EVALUATE THE LEGAL 
AND FINANCIAL TERMS OF SOV-
EREIGN DEBT CONTRACTS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Title XVI of the Inter-
national 
Financial 
Institutions 
Act 
(22 
U.S.C. 262p–262p–13) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘SEC. 1630. SUPPORT TO ENHANCE THE CAPAC-
ITY OF FUND MEMBERS TO EVALU-
ATE THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL 
TERMS OF SOVEREIGN DEBT CON-
TRACTS. 
‘‘The Secretary of the Treasury shall in-
struct the United States Executive Director 
at the International Monetary Fund to use 
the voice and vote of the United States to 
advocate that the Fund promote inter-
national standards and best practices with 
respect to sovereign debt contracts and pro-
vide technical assistance to Fund members, 
and in particular to lower middle-income 
countries and countries eligible to receive 
assistance from the International Develop-
ment Association, seeking to enhance their 
capacity to evaluate the legal and financial 
terms of sovereign debt contracts with mul-
tilateral, bilateral, and private sector credi-
tors.’’. 
(b) REPORT
TO
THE CONGRESS.—Within 1 
year after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, and annually thereafter for the next 4 
years, the Secretary of the Treasury shall re-
port to the Committee on Financial Services 
of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Sen-
ate on— 
(1) the activities of the International Mon-
etary Fund in the then most recently com-
pleted fiscal year to provide technical assist-
ance described in section 1630 of the Inter-
national Financial Institutions Act, includ-
ing the ability of the Fund to meet the de-
mand for the assistance; and 
(2) the efficacy of efforts by the United 
States to achieve the policy goal described 
in such section and any further actions that 
should be taken, if necessary, to implement 
that goal. 
(c) SUNSET.—The amendment made by sub-
section (a) shall have no force or effect after 
the 5-year period that begins with the date of 
the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and to insert extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the 
Financial Services Subcommittee on 
National Security, International De-
velopment and Monetary Policy held a 
hearing on China’s lending practices 
and their impact on the international 
sovereign debt architecture. The hear-
ing examined China’s dominant posi-
tion as the largest official creditor in 
the world, with China’s outstanding 
claims larger than those of all other bi-
lateral creditors combined. We also ex-
amined how China lends with respect 
to the terms and conditions China im-
poses on borrowing countries through 
its sovereign debt contracts. 
Among the witnesses who testified 
were authors of a recent study that ex-
amined 100 China sovereign debt con-
tracts, which found that since 2014, 
every sovereign debt contract exam-
ined contained strict nondisclosure re-
quirements that prohibited the bor-
rower from disclosing the terms of, and 
even the existence of, the debt itself. 
Many of the contracts examined 
sought to elevate Chinese Government 
loans over other creditors by requiring 
the creation of China-controlled off-
shore collateral accounts and by ex-
plicitly prohibiting the debt from being 
included in any multilateral debt re-
structuring initiative. 
The study also found a number of 
contracts with cross-default and accel-
erated payment provisions that give 
China substantial leverage over an 
array of domestic and foreign policy 
decisions that a borrowing country 
might undertake. 
The absence of transparency not only 
prevents citizens from holding their 
governments accountable for their bor-
rowing decisions, but it also obscures a 
country’s true financial picture from 
other creditors, which can undermine 
sovereign debt rescheduling operations 
that are based on systems of trust and 
equitable burden sharing among all of 
a country’s creditors. 
For example, in Zambia, one of three 
countries that has applied for debt re-
lief under the new G20 Common Frame-
work initiative, new revelations about 
undisclosed Chinese debt nearly dou-
bled its total official amount owed 
from $3.4 billion to $6.6 billion. 
Opacity also creates greater oppor-
tunity for political capture and corrup-
tion and undermines debt risk manage-
ment and surveillance work. 
It was this context in which I intro-
duced, with Ranking Member PATRICK 
MCHENRY, H.R. 4111, the Sovereign 
Debt Contract Capacity Act, which di-
rects the Secretary of the Treasury to 
instruct the United States executive 
director at the International Monetary 
Fund to use the influence of the United 
States at the IMF to advocate that the 
Fund provide technical assistance to 
bolster the capacity of developing 
country debt managers to evaluate and 
negotiate both the financial and the 
legal terms in sovereign debt con-
tracts. 
It is important that this kind of ca-
pacity 
building 
also 
be 
available 
through multilateral channels like the 
IMF, which have a wider global reach. 
Multilateral approaches can also be 
more effective since national programs 
risk being perceived as an instrument 
of power politics and beholden to cer-
tain interest groups within a country. 
To be sure, some countries sign bad 
contracts for the wrong reasons, in-
cluding 
corruption 
and 
governance 
problems. In a country that is running 
up oppressive, hidden debt because its 
leaders are corrupt, training is not 
going to help a lot. But ensuring that 
technical assistance is available to any 
developing country that requests help 
in assessing the technical, legal com-
plexities of sovereign debt contracts 
would be an important step in reform 
of the sovereign debt crisis manage-
ment system. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4111, the Sovereign Debt Con-
tract Capacity Act, an important piece 
of legislation sponsored by our chair-
woman and cosponsored by our com-
mittee’s lead Republican. 
China has now become the world’s 
largest official creditor, but the details 
of 
its 
lending 
remain 
notoriously 
opaque. 
At a hearing in May, the Financial 
Services 
Committee 
examined 
how 
China has been using strict confiden-
tiality 
arrangements, 
cross-default 
provisions, and other tools to hide the 
details of its loans and potentially in-
fluence borrowers’ domestic and for-
eign policies. 
A recent analysis by the research 
group AidData has also shown that 42 
countries now have public debt expo-
sure to China in excess of 10 percent of 
their GDP, which is largely hidden 
from conventional reporting to the 
World Bank. 
H.R. 4111 would address this problem 
by 
supporting 
technical 
assistance 
from the International Monetary Fund 
to help developing countries better as-
sess these debt contracts. 
This legislation builds on a bipar-
tisan law authored by our colleague, 
Congressman HILL from Arkansas, that 
requires the Treasury Department to 
push for greater Chinese debt trans-
parency at the international financial 
institutions. 
Together, these two bills are a clear 
statement that our committee wants 
the Treasury Department to prioritize 
the threat of China’s hidden debt and 
give countries the necessary technical 
assistance to push back on Beijing. 
H.R. 4111 is especially timely since 
the IMF is confronting serious difficul-
ties carrying out new programs since 
China has been so slow negotiating its 
loans to IMF borrowers. 
If the International Monetary Fund 
can’t accurately assess borrowers’ li-
abilities to Beijing, it will have trouble 
providing its own financing. In other 
words, China’s opaque lending prac-
tices are not just a threat to borrowing 
countries; it puts at risk the oper-
ations of the IMF, World Bank, and 
other multilateral lenders. This is un-
acceptable. 
I commend the chairwoman for spon-
soring this legislation and hope that 
our committee can continue to work in 
such a bipartisan manner to address

China’s 
exploitation 
of 
countries 
around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4111, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman, again, for her strong 
legislation. I would urge all my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4111, the Sov-
ereign Debt Contract Capacity Act, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I want to note that H.R. 
4111 also directs the U.S. to advocate 
for the IMF to develop and promote a 
shared 
understanding 
of 
standard 
terms and sound practices with respect 
to sovereign debt contracts. 
Officials for countries that sign op-
pressive debt contracts are often told 
that the proposed terms are market 
standard where either there is no 
standard or where the standard is quite 
different from what is being proposed. 
This would be another positive reform 
of the sovereign debt architecture. 
I would like to thank Ranking Mem-
ber MCHENRY for working with me on 
this important bill. H.R. 4111 has been 
endorsed by Oxfam, Bread for the 
World, ONE, and the AFL–CIO. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4111. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

cies electronically searchable, to fur-
ther 
enable

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5847 
October 25, 2021 
The 
Financial 
Transparency 
Act 
takes a proactive approach to modern-
izing our data standards and publica-
tion protocols within the financial 
services industry. This bill requires 
that the SEC, FDIC, OCC, CFPB, Fed-
eral Reserve, NCUA, and FHFA work 
with 
the 
Treasury 
Department 
to 
adopt data standards for the informa-
tion it collects and to upgrade their re-
porting requirements so that reported 
data is stored in an open, searchable, 
and accessible manner. 
The bill also ensures that these 
standards are created in a coordinated 
manner to enable searchability across 
these agencies, helping to catch bad ac-
tors 
more 
easily 
while 
promoting 
greater transparency and trust from 
the public in our financial system. 
In this digital age, it is imperative 
that our regulators keep up with our 
rapidly changing financial markets and 
utilize technology in a way that safe-
guards our data while promoting the 
safety and soundness of our financial 
system. This bill puts the United 
States on equal footing with many 
other countries that already have 
begun using searchable data formats in 
submissions to regulators. 
This commonsense bill would also 
benefit retail investors, as they will be 
able to search through publicly avail-
able documents, rather than having to 
manually save each document in order 
to extract the information they want. 
In addition, companies that analyze 
this data will be able to more quickly 
report their findings to the public, 
helping better inform the investing 
public about the state of our capital 
markets. 
b 1715 
H.R. 2989 will also benefit regulated 
entities, like banks, credit unions, 
asset managers, and public companies, 
as they will now have clearly delin-
eated 
criteria 
and 
frameworks 
to 
upload their data, ensuring consistent 
data standards and the ability for fi-
nancial institutions to do more effi-
cient compliance tasks that must be 
performed manually today. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
Washington, DC, October 25, 2021. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM CHAIRWOMAN: This letter con-
firms our mutual understanding regarding 
H.R. 2989, the Financial Transparency Act of 
2021. Thank you for collaborating with the 
Committee on Agriculture on the matters 
within our jurisdiction. 
The Committee on Agriculture will forego 
any further consideration of this bill so that 
it may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor for consideration. However, by fore-
going consideration at this time, we do not 
waive any jurisdiction over any subject mat-
ter contained in this or similar legislation. 
We request that our Committee be consulted 
and involved as this bill moves forward so 
that we may address any remaining issues in 
our jurisdiction. The Committee on Agri-
culture also reserves the right to seek ap-
pointment of an appropriate number of con-
ferees to any House-Senate conference in-
volving this or similar legislation and ask 
that you support any such request. 
We would appreciate a response to this let-
ter confirming this understanding with re-
spect to H.R. 2989, and request that a copy of 
our letters on this matter be published in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, October 25, 2021. 
Hon. DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MISTER CHAIRMAN: I writing to ac-
knowledge your letter dated October 25, 2021, 
regarding the waiver by the Committee on 
Agriculture of any jurisdictional claims over 
the matters contained in H.R. 2989, the ‘‘Fi-
nancial Transparency Act of 2021.’’ The Com-
mittee on Financial Services confirms our 
mutual understanding that your Committee 
does not waive any jurisdiction over the sub-
ject matter contained in this or similar leg-
islation, and your Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this bill 
or similar legislation moves forward so that 
we may address any remaining issues within 
your jurisdiction. 
The Committee on Financial Services fur-
ther recognizes your interest in appointment 
of outside conferees from the Committee on 
Agriculture should this bill or similar lan-
guage be considered in a conference with the 
Senate. 
Pursuant to your request, I will ensure 
that this exchange of letters is included in 
the Congressional Record during Floor con-
sideration of the bill. I appreciate your co-
operation regarding this legislation and look 
forward to continuing to work with you as 
this measure moves through the legislative 
process. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Rep-
resentative 
MALONEY
and 
Ranking 
Member MCHENRY’s bipartisan legisla-
tion, H.R. 2989, the Financial Trans-
parency Act of 2021. 
Our securities and banking laws re-
quire financial regulatory agencies to 
collect countless pieces of data from 
regulated entities each year. Yet, there 
is no consistency in the manner in 
which they collect this data. As a re-
sult, data is often difficult to find and 
to understand. 
This commonsense legislation en-
sures 
our 
regulatory 
agencies 
are 
working together to adopt consistent 
data fields and formats for the infor-
mation they collect. 
The bill will require our banking and 
securities regulators to better organize 
data and make this information avail-
able in open-source formats. This, in 
turn, benefits investors, businesses, 
and even the Federal Government. 
Setting data standards will foster 
more transparency and increase the ef-
ficiency for everyone who generates, 
collects, and uses the information. 
This bill will make financial data 
more easily available. It will also re-
duce overhead costs and streamline 
workloads. 
I applaud Congresswoman MALONEY 
and Ranking Member MCHENRY
for 
their commitment to this issue. 
Reforming our information manage-
ment practices and establishing uni-
form data standards for regulatory re-
porting is critical to ensuring an effi-
cient and effective regulatory frame-
work. 
I urge Members to support this com-
monsense piece of legislation and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2989, the Financial 
Transparency Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), the 
sponsor of this legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of 
the Financial Services Committee for 
her leadership and support on this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 2989, the Financial 
Transparency Act of 2021, a bipartisan 
bill I introduced with Financial Serv-
ices 
Committee 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY. 
The 
Financial 
Transparency 
Act 
would require our Nation’s financial 
regulators to adopt a set of data collec-
tion and dispersion standards for the 
information they collect under current 
law, including the adoption of elec-
tronic forms to replace paper-based 
forms. 
All data would be made available in 
an open-source format that is elec-
tronically searchable, downloadable in 
bulk, and without license restrictions. 
Under the bill, Treasury is tasked 
with establishing common data stand-
ards that would allow the standardiza-
tion and sharing of data across our fi-
nancial regulators and the public at 
large. Such data standards would in-
clude a common legal entity identifier 
that would give Treasury an increased 
ability to provide effective oversight 
across our financial markets. 
The legal entity identifier is used 
throughout our financial markets and 
regulations today, and this bill would 
encourage agencies to continue moving 
in that direction. 
Each financial regulator is then 
tasked with adopting standards for the 
data reported to each agency. The reg-
ulators maintain the ability to tailor 
its regulations as needed to fit the 
unique needs of each entity and have 
the ability to scale any regulatory re-
quirements in order to reduce regu-
latory burdens on smaller entities. 
I also want to be clear that this is 
not imposing new regulatory burdens 
on market participants. This is mod-
ernizing and making more transparent 
the data that is already reported to our 
regulators and that the regulators pub-
lish today. 
The bill also contains important pro-
tections to ensure confidential business

and supervisory information remains 
protected. 
The end result of this bill will be 
more 
transparent 
and 
open 
data 
sources and data that is readily com-
parable across businesses and sectors. 
This is a win-win for regulators, for 
investors, for the public, for accuracy, 
and for industry. 
For regulators, they will more easily 
be able to analyze and search the data 
its regulated entities are reporting. 
This will improve efficiency and over-
all government operations. 
For investors, open-data publications 
will allow for easy searchability and 
comparability of companies and sec-
tors, empowering investors to act on 
up-to-date information. 
Industries will be able to automati-
cally report required information using 
software in the format required by 
their regulators. 
Mr. Speaker, the Financial Trans-
parency Act builds on past congres-
sional efforts to make data more acces-
sible, useful, and more accurate. 
This has clear benefits for our regu-
lators, investors, and market partici-
pants and would improve the ability of 
our regulators to monitor financial 
stability and therefore the safety and 
soundness of our financial markets. 
Before I close, I want to take a mo-
ment 
to 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY and his staff for their work 
and coordination on this important ef-
fort. I also want to thank Chairwoman 
WATERS and her staff for working with 
me on advancing this bill. 
This was truly a bipartisan effort, 
and we would not be here without ev-
eryone working in the same direction. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the 
Financial Transparency Act. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time 
until Mrs. WAGNER yields. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 2989, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I would again like to 
state that I support this bipartisan 
bill. The Financial Transparency Act 
of 2021 helps modernize our regulatory 
framework so that government, private 
industry, and the public all benefit. 
Now more than ever, it makes sense 
for Congress to harness technology in a 
manner that provides greater trans-
parency, 
accountability, 
and 
effi-
ciency, and this bill does exactly that. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
MALONEY
and 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY for working with my staff in 
a bipartisan manner to get this bill 
across the finish line. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 2989, the Financial Trans-
parency Act of 2021, introduced by my friend 
and colleague, Mrs. MALONEY. 
I appreciate all her hard work on this impor-
tant bill over the last six years to help make 
data more available to Americans and estab-
lish a framework to reduce regulatory compli-
ance costs. 
We can all agree that data is important. 
In the 21st century, data is critical to grow-
ing our knowledge-based economy. 
Reliable data not only drives decisions in 
the private sector, but it also drives decisions 
within the federal government. 
Yet, data is only useful if one (1) can find 
it and (2) understand it. 
Trying to access data within the federal gov-
ernment, and in particular financial services 
sector, is even more difficult. 
Data is collected, maintained, and disclosed 
by the federal government in outdated for-
mats. 
Moreover, the silos in the federal govern-
ment and within the financial services industry 
can make it more difficult for Americans to ac-
cess useful information. 
H.R. 2989, the Financial Transparency Act 
of 2021, brings the regulators and the financial 
industry into the 21st century. 
This bill will require our regulatory agencies 
to work together to establish data standards 
for regulatory reporting and to post the infor-
mation online in a publicly accessible format. 
This bill applies to information the agencies al-
ready collect under current law. 
This bill signals Congress’ intent to have the 
information be unambiguously identified in ma-
chine-readable data formats. 
Automating how data is handled will make it 
easier for oversight agencies to quickly identify 
what needs further investigation, keeping 
small issues from becoming bigger ones, and 
allowing us to use government resources 
more wisely and efficiently. 
Automating how data is handled will allow 
regulated entities to automate much of their 
reporting processes. 
It is also important to note what this bill 
does not do. 
H.R. 2989 does not support any particular 
technology. Nothing needs to be invented to 
satisfy this bill. There are a range of tech-
nologies available that have been developed 
exactly for these needs in the US and globally. 
It does not change what gets reported. That 
is, it explicitly leaves to the agencies control 
over their disclosure requirements. 
Passage of the Financial Transparency Act 
is long overdue. 
I applaud my friend, Congresswoman MALO-
NEY, for her unwavering commitment to foster 
more transparency of the data collected by our 
federal government and increase the efficiency 
for everyone who generates, collects, and 
uses the information collected by our financial 
regulators. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2989, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION 
PREVENTION ACT OF 2021 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2265) to amend the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 to postpone the 
date of payment or satisfaction upon 
redemption of certain securities in the 
case of the financial exploitation of 
specified adults, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and insert ex-
traneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2265, the Financial Exploitation Pre-
vention Act of 2021, sponsored by the 
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER). 
It is not a surprise that adults over 
the age of 65 are sometimes the targets 
for financial exploitation and have be-
come victims of financial crimes more 
than any other demographic. Just last 
week, in its annual report on elder 
fraud and abuse, the Department of 
Justice reported that in 2020 alone, sen-
iors suffered over $1 billion in financial 
losses due to fraud. 
Unlike other adults, seniors are often 
dependent on their savings to support 
them in retirement, making any fraud 
that much harder to recover from. Bro-
kers and investment managers, who 
often stand in as the stewards of the 
savings of seniors, are in a unique posi-
tion to protect elders from financial 
crimes. 
In 2018, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission released a policy letter, 
called a no-action letter, stating that 
the Commission would not take an en-
forcement action against the agents of 
an investment company, including mu-
tual funds, if the person paused a pay-
ment or redemption based on the sus-
picion of financial exploitation. This 
pause on cashing out the savings of a 
senior can provide invaluable time to 
ensure that the redemption is con-
sistent with the will of the senior. 
H.R. 2265 would codify this SEC let-
ter. It would also make two further 
changes to describe how a mutual fund 
adviser can establish the process at 
each fund to protect seniors. 
I thank Mrs. WAGNER for working 
with my staff to craft the language in 
this bill. This is a helpful piece of legis-
lation that will provide one more tool 
to market participants to protect in-
vestors and, in particular, our Nation’s 
retirees. 
I urge Members to support H.R. 2265, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
bill, H.R. 2265, the Financial Exploi-
tation Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill

October 25, 2021 
that will help us combat the financial 
exploitation of seniors and other vul-
nerable adults. 
I thank Congressman MCHENRY and 
Chairwoman WATERS
for supporting 
this important legislation. 
Financial exploitation of seniors and 
other vulnerable adults is a serious and 
growing problem. 
The number of Americans ages 65 and 
older is projected to nearly double, 
from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million by 
2060. This represents an increase from 
16 to 23 percent of the U.S. population 
being 65 years old and older. 
Right now, approximately 44 percent 
of households headed by a baby boomer 
and 30 percent of silent generation 
households own mutual funds. 
As more investors age into retire-
ment, the risk of financial exploitation 
for elderly households only increases. 
Roughly one in five senior investors 
are victimized by financial fraud, and 
those investors lose an estimated $2.9 
billion annually in reported cases and, 
unfortunately, some estimates indicate 
that only 1 in 44 cases of financial 
abuse is ever reported. 
b 1730 
My bill proposes a solution to fight 
elder abuse in the context of mutual 
funds. 
Since some mutual fund shareholder 
accounts are held directly with a mu-
tual fund and serviced by the fund’s 
transfer agent, or ‘‘direct-at-fund’’ ac-
counts as they are known, the transfer 
agent is typically responsible for open-
ing and servicing the accounts, main-
taining account records, and serving as 
the fund’s point of contact with those 
shareholders. 
Under current law, when a fund’s 
transfer agent suspects financial ex-
ploitation in a direct-at-fund account, 
it cannot lawfully delay the disburse-
ment of redemption proceeds while an 
investigation occurs. 
My legislation codifies a SEC–issued 
no-action letter from 2018 that permits 
a mutual fund and its transfer agents 
to delay the redemption period of a se-
curity if it is reasonably believed that 
a request was made by exploiting sen-
iors or other vulnerable adults. 
This will provide our potentially vul-
nerable investors with an important 
layer of investor protection to help 
make sure that they receive the hard- 
earned savings that they have built up 
over the years. 
Additionally, and importantly, my 
bill also requires the SEC to report to 
Congress on additional potential legis-
lative solutions on how to further com-
bat financial exploitation of seniors 
and vulnerable adults. 
This legislation, Mr. Speaker, is 
needed to provide certainty to protect 
our seniors, and I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support the Financial Ex-
ploitation Prevention Act. 
I am grateful to the chairwoman and 
to the ranking member and all of the 
committee that has worked on this in 
such a bipartisan fashion, Mr. Speaker, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further Democratic speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I again, 
thank the chairwoman and her team 
for making this very important piece 
of legislation that is so important to 
our seniors and to our vulnerable 
adults happen. 
Again, in 2018, the SEC put this to-
gether as something we should be 
strongly looking at as we move for-
ward. I am pleased we were able to 
bring it to the floor today in a bipar-
tisan fashion. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
my bill, H.R. 2265, the Financial Ex-
ploitation Act of 2021, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2265, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

(H.R. 5142) to award posthumously a 
Congressional Gold Medal, in com-
memoration to the servicemembers 
who perished in Afghanistan on August

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

California (Ms. WATERS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Member 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5142, a bill to posthumously award Con-
gressional Gold Medals in commemora-
tion to the servicemembers who per-
ished in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, during the 20-year war 
in Afghanistan, we lost over 2,000 brave 
men and women. More than 20,000 serv-
icemembers returned home wounded in 
action. 
I believe in my heart that every sin-
gle soldier we lost in Afghanistan was 
a tragedy. We must remember their 
sacrifice. 
In the waning days of this war, the 
Biden administration made decisions 
that 
put 
U.S. 
servicemembers 
in 
harm’s way, and, unfortunately, Mr. 
Speaker, on August 26, we lost 13 more 
servicemembers, and more than 20 were 
injured. 
Eleven marines, one Navy corpsman, 
and one soldier were killed by an ISIS- 
K bomber outside the Hamid Karzai 
International Airport on this terrible 
day in August. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent the people of 
Missouri’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict; and on August 26, my State lost 
a hero, Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz. 
This courageous young man had been 
stationed in Jordan on his first deploy-
ment when he was called into Afghani-
stan to defend the civilians fleeing the 
Taliban’s advance. He was eager to be 
one of the brave men and women on the 
front lines, making a real difference for 
the Americans and allies trapped in a 
terrifying and dangerous situation. 
Lance Corporal Schmitz was totally 
committed to his military service, and 
he felt a calling to be a United States 
marine. So much so that he had gotten 
his parents’ permission to enlist at just 
17 years old. 
Lance Corporal Schmitz was just 20 
years old when he lost his life in the 
terrorist attack at the airport in 
Kabul. 
Lance Corporal Schmitz and the 12 
other servicemembers we lost in Au-
gust went above and beyond the call of 
duty to protect those stranded in Af-
ghanistan. 
I sadly don’t believe we will truly un-
derstand why Lance Corporal Schmitz 
and his fellow soldiers died. Neverthe-
less, his family, their families, and all 
Americans deserve answers, Mr. Speak-
er. 
And I hope one day those who made 
the decisions that resulted in these 
senseless deaths will be held account-
able. 
In the meantime, I am grateful that 
their service and their sacrifice is 
being commemorated by this legisla-
tion. The bravery and valor shown by 
these servicemembers is unquestion-
able. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
supporting this bill, and I look forward 
to standing next to the family of Lance 
Corporal Schmitz as they are presented 
a Congressional Gold Medal commemo-
rating their son’s service and valor. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as we mark nearly 2 
months since the bombing that killed 
more than 116 innocent Afghanis and 
American military personnel at the 
Hamid Karzai International Airport, I 
rise in strong support of this legisla-
tion to award posthumously a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the 13 U.S. serv-
icemembers who gave their lives that 
day. 
Those 
individuals 
are 
Sergeant 
Johanny Rosario Pichardo, Sergeant 
Nicole Gee, Staff Sergeant Darin Tay-
lor Hoover, Corporal Hunter Lopez, 
Corporal 
Daegan 
Page, 
Corporal 
Humberto Sanchez, Lance Corporal 
David Espinoza, Lance Corporal Jared 
Schmitz, Lance Corporal Rylee McCol-
lum, Lance Corporal Dylan Merola, 
Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, Navy 
Corpsman Maxton Soviak, and Staff 
Sergeant Ryan C. Knauss. 
Mr. Speaker, as we recognize these 
extraordinary heroes and also under-
stand that this honor cannot come 
close to filling the void left by their 
loss, I cannot think of anyone more de-
serving of such a distinction. 
These 
brave 
servicemembers 
rep-
resent the very best of America, know-
ingly putting themselves in harm’s 
way to help evacuate thousands from 
the region, a true embodiment of the 
American spirit. 
Their legacies live on in the thou-
sands of Afghan refugees they saved, 
who now have an opportunity to live 
lives free of violence and persecution. 
And so as we remember these ex-
traordinary American heroes and rec-
ognize them with the Congressional 
Gold Medal, let us all live lives worthy 
of their sacrifice and service to our 
great Nation. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ and to join me in honoring these 
great American heroes. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN), the sponsor 
of this bill. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for yielding. 
War is an incredible teacher, a brutal 
instructor. We have learned lessons 
about triumph, sorrow, loss, and pain. 
War teaches us to appreciate the sim-
ple things we take for granted, like the 
ability to speak your mind, freely prac-
tice your religion, even seeing your 
loved ones once a day. 
It also teaches us that in war there 
are no unwounded soldiers. 
There are those who came back with 
both visible scars and invisible battle 
wounds, and there are those who did 
not come home at all. 
Today, we pause to honor the 13 
American servicemembers who lost 
their lives during the evacuation ef-
forts at the Kabul Airport in Afghani-
stan on August 26, 2021. 
These 13 fallen warriors, along with 
many others, made the ultimate sac-
rifice. Each of them knew their duty, 
and they accepted the risks. Not many 
answer the call, but they volunteered 
anyway. 
Sent to evacuate Americans and Af-
ghans that struggled to get past the 
Taliban checkpoints in Kabul and 
through the airport gates, fearing they 
would be left behind and left for dead. 
They knew the mission and valiantly 
forged ahead; helping hundreds to safe-
ty, overcoming their own fears, when a 
suicide bomb attack took their lives. 
The terrorist act took the lives of at 
least 170 Afghans, 11 marines, one Navy 
corpsman, and one Army special oper-
ations soldier, including Lance Cor-
poral David Lee Espinoza of Laredo, 
Texas; Sergeant Nicole Gee of Rose-
ville, California; Staff Sergeant Darin 
Taylor Hoover of Salt Lake City, Utah; 
Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss of Knox-
ville, 
Tennessee; 
Corporal 
Hunter 
Lopez of Indio, California; Lance Cor-
poral Rylee McCollum of Bondurant, 
Wyoming; Corporal Dylan Merola of 
Rancho Cucamonga, California; Lance 
Corporal Kareem Nikoui of Norco, Cali-
fornia; 
Corporal 
Daegan 
William- 
Tyeler Page of Omaha, Nebraska; Ser-
geant Johanny Rosario Pichardo of 
Lawrence, 
Massachusetts; 
Corporal 
Humberto Sanchez of Logansport, Indi-
ana; Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz of 
Wentzville, Missouri; Navy Corpsman 
Maxton Soviak of Berlin Heights, Ohio. 
I could not be more grateful for their 
service to our Nation. While we as a 
Nation grieve for the servicemembers 
we have lost, we often forget about the 
families who have lost even more. 
To be a Gold Star Family is an honor 
no one wishes for. We owe our sincerest 
gratitude to the families who eagerly 
awaited these 13 servicemembers’ re-
turn. These families bear the greatest 
burden of their loved one’s sacrifice, 
and we can never thank them in a way 
that will make up for their loss. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Awarding Congress’ 
highest honor is a small token of our 
appreciation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5852 
October 25, 2021 
Thank you to all of my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who joined me in 
this effort. 
b 1745 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for her leadership, and 
the ranking member, also. 
Mr. Speaker, today we honor our fall-
en servicemembers to award them with 
this Congressional Gold Medal. I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of this legisla-
tion, H.R. 5142. 
On August 26 at 9:44 a.m., an explo-
sion from a suicide terrorist bombing 
in Afghanistan killed 13 of our service-
members. One of those servicemembers 
was my constituent, Lance Corporal 
David Lee Espinoza from Rio Bravo. 
He was born in Laredo and graduated 
from the city’s Lyndon B. Johnson 
High School in 2019. His mother, Eliza-
beth Holguin, and his father, Victor 
Dominguez, and his brothers and sister, 
Angel, Victor, and Delilah, mourn his 
loss and are endlessly proud of David 
and his service. 
When we attended David’s funeral in 
Laredo, we all knew that families 
across the United States also mourned 
their loved ones. David joined the Ma-
rine Corps with the intention of pro-
tecting our Nation and demonstrating 
his selfless acts of service to his coun-
try. He embodied the American values 
of grit, dedication, service, and valor. 
May 
Lance 
Corporal 
David 
Lee 
Espinoza and our fallen servicemem-
bers forever be honored and never be 
forgotten. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining on 
my side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Missouri has 131⁄4 min-
utes remaining. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today in support of H.R. 
5142 introduced by my colleague, LISA 
MCCLAIN from Michigan. 
This bill would posthumously award 
a Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. 
servicemembers killed during the final 
week of the Afghanistan evacuation. 
On August 26, 2021, 13 American serv-
icemembers were killed in a brutal sui-
cide bombing at Hamid Karzai Inter-
national Airport, marking one of the 
deadliest days for U.S. forces in Af-
ghanistan in the past 20 years. 
These selfless and brave Americans 
were put into an impossible situation, 
but their commitment to that mission 
never wavered. 
They epitomized what it means to be 
a hero. They knew about the height-
ened threat that they faced. They knew 
the risks, but they stayed at those 
gates to keep them open, each second 
buying time for more lives to be saved. 
The chaos of those days in Kabul and 
the perilous situation our servicemem-
bers and diplomats faced cannot be 
overstated. We owe an extraordinary 
debt of gratitude for the sacrifice that 
they should have never been forced to 
have made. 
Every American should take pride in 
the heroism that Americans on the 
ground displayed in our final days in 
Afghanistan, 
but 
every 
American 
should 
also 
demand 
accountability 
from those senior officials whose deci-
sions put our servicemembers in a posi-
tion that required such heroic acts. 
Today, we honor the 13 lives lost and 
keep their families and all who loved 
them in our prayers. Theirs is the epit-
ome of selfless service, and a grateful 
Nation honors them here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Michigan for introducing this im-
portant legislation, and I urge the sup-
port of my colleagues. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I was asked by some-
body about this piece of legislation, the 
Congressional Gold Medal for the 13 
killed on August 26, and why not a gold 
medal for the thousands that have been 
killed in the war on terror, the ones 
that I wear on my wrist and the ones 
with names on the wall in the Rayburn 
Office Building and those that we see 
the markers for in Arlington National 
Cemetery. The fact is, we could give 
every one of them a thousand gold 
medals and it wouldn’t represent a 
thousandth of what we owe those who 
have given their lives in defense of this 
country. 
This gold medal isn’t about that. It is 
about what we owe to the living. 
This gold medal is a result of Amer-
ica’s leaders being weak. That is why 
we are awarding this gold medal. We 
owe our fighters strength. We owe 
them that we never be intimidated, 
that we never back up, that we never 
retreat, that we never surrender. And 
as leaders, if we can’t promise that to 
our fighters, then we owe it to them to 
never ask to lead. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. WALTZ). 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, as we as a 
nation reflect on 13 more killed in ac-
tion, 13 more Gold Star families, I 
think it is worth noting that they did 
their mission. They did their jobs. 
Their operation, their mission, was 
to secure Kabul International Airport, 
to evacuate our Embassy, to evacuate 
those who had worked with us, to evac-
uate the remaining military assets. 
And they did their job. They secured 
Kabul International Airport. But they 
went above and beyond. 
After pulling grueling, long shifts in 
the August heat in Afghanistan—and 
everybody who has served there knows 
how difficult that could be—they went 
on their own time and were working 
with grassroots veterans organizations 
who sprung up, who stepped up to do, 
frankly, what should have already been 
done and to help those who had stood 
with us and stood for that flag for 20 
years. 
They, on their own time, at great 
risk, were getting people out. They 
knew the dangers. Everybody who had 
served there knew that it was only a 
matter of time till they were going to 
be hit. They knew that it was only a 
matter of time. Yet, they did it any-
way. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this legislation for the Congressional 
Gold Medal, but we owe them answers. 
We owe their families answers. We owe 
this country answers. 
Why were they defending an airport 
in the middle of a city of 4 million peo-
ple? Why were the military assets 
pulled before—before—all of our civil-
ians and our government employees 
were out? 
Why? Why? Why? So many questions. 
So many answers. 
I can tell you, and I could tell these 
families, I tell this body, I will not 
rest, I will never forget, and we will get 
those answers that those 13 Gold Star 
families deserve. And there will be ac-
countability for why we now have 13 
more dead Americans. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representative 
WAGNER
for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Gold 
Medal, as we all know and have heard, 
is Congress’ highest medal. It is the 
least we can do for the 13 brave service-
members killed during our withdrawal 
from Afghanistan back in August. 
One of those 13, Army Staff Sergeant 
Ryan Knauss, was from Corryton, Ten-
nessee, in my congressional district. As 
a matter of fact, I live in Corryton, and 
his family, they are neighbors of mine. 
His grandfather called me shortly 
after and described the scene. We have 
all seen it in movies, but he, unfortu-
nately, had to live it. The car pulls up. 
The Army officers get out and, in fact, 
inform his family that his grandson 
had perished in Afghanistan. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard that story 
many times because my mama endured 
that very same thing when she was a 
young girl in Cheatham County, Ten-
nessee, and her brother, Roy, had died 
fighting the Nazis. So it is in my head 
pretty thick, sir. 
Of course, he was killed while helping 
complete strangers, and that is what 
he loved to do. He loved helping folks. 
When Staff Sergeant Knauss suc-
cumbed to his injuries after the attack, 
he became the final American military

casualty from the war in Afghanistan. 
We were all devastated by this loss, but 
our community is very strong. 
Mr. Speaker, on September 11, they 
held a great local tribute to this fallen 
hero at Gibbs High School, on the foot-
ball field. And on September 21, I also 
attended his funeral as he was laid to 
rest at Arlington National Cemetery. 
Today, we honor him and 12 fellow 
heroes further by passing this legisla-
tion. The true heroes in this country 
are the men and women of our Armed 
Forces. They are the ones who keep us 
free. Their patriotism and bravery have 
kept us safe every day. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WEBER), my friend and colleague, 
a classmate of mine. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, little that we can do 
here today is going to make a dif-
ference in what those families endured. 
We can only supply a small token of 
our appreciation for the greatest fight-
ing force of men and women on the 
planet. 
I want you to think with me for a 
second here. When the world has a ca-
lamity, it doesn’t matter whether it is 
a hurricane, whether it is a tsunami, 
whether it is an earthquake, whether it 
is pestilence, famine, or rebellion, in-
vasion. When the world has a calamity 
and they dial 911, who is it that an-
swers? It is the United States of Amer-
ica, isn’t it? With the greatest fighting 
force of men and women this world has 
ever known. 
When America is safe, the world is a 
safer place. To the families, the Gold 
Star families, whose family members 
gave all, we owe them a debt of grati-
tude, and not just us, but the world as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, may God bless them, 
and may they rest in peace. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 5142 to award 
posthumously a Congressional Gold 
Medal in commemoration of the serv-
icemembers who perished in Afghani-
stan on August 26, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I simply 
ask all of my colleagues, all the Mem-
bers of this House, to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, the book of Isa-
iah recounts how the prophet Isaiah began his 
service. In a time of darkness, the Lord asks, 
‘‘Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?’’ 
Isaiah’s response was to volunteer for serv-
ice: ‘‘Here am I; send me.’’ 
When their nation called them to serve, so 
said 
a 
generation 
of 
American 
servicemembers, diplomats and intelligence 
officers: ‘‘Here am I; send me.’’ 
Two months ago tomorrow, thirteen of those 
servicemembers were killed as they helped 
bring nearly 130,000 Americans, allies and Af-
ghan partners to safety. 
That action was one of profound valor, self-
lessness and sacrifice, for which the Congress 
and Country are united in grief and in grati-
tude. 
We salute and pray for: Marine Corps Staff 
Sgt. Darin T. Hoover (Salt Lake City, Utah); 
Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny [jo-HAN-nee] 
Rosario Pichardo (Lawrence, Massachusetts); 
Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee [JEE] (Sac-
ramento, California); Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter 
Lopez (Indio, California); Marine Corps Cpl. 
Daegan [day-gan] Page (Omaha, Nebraska); 
Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez (Lo-
gansport, Indiana); Marine Corps Lance Cpl. 
David L. Espinoza (Rio Bravo, Texas); Marine 
Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz (St. 
Charles, Missouri); Marine Corps Lance Cpl. 
Rylee J. McCollum (Jackson, Wyoming); Ma-
rine Corps Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola (Ran-
cho Cucamonga, California); Marine Corps 
Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui [neh-KOO-ee] 
(Norco, California); Navy Hospitalman Maxton 
W. Soviak (Berlin Heights, Ohio); and Army 
Staff 
Sgt. 
Ryan 
C. 
Knauss 
[kuh-nows] 
(Corryton, Tennessee). 
Today, we honor their heroism by awarding 
them the Congressional Gold Medal: the high-
est honor that the Congress can bestow. 
Their service brings great honor to our 
country, and their being awarded this honor 
brings luster to this award. 
As we honor the heroism of the fallen, we 
salute each member of our military, intel-
ligence and diplomatic communities who con-
ducted this evacuation—and all who have 
served or are serving our country. 
We pray for all fighting for our freedoms and 
for their families. And we pray for the people 
of Afghanistan and in the region. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, on Au-
gust 26th, 13 American families experienced 
the worst day of their lives. 
They received the knock on the door that 
every parent of a servicemember prays will 
never come. 
For those families, the conversation that fol-
lowed was the most devastating news a per-
son can receive: their child has been killed. 
One of the marines we lost that day was 
Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz from Wentzville 
in Missouri’s Third Congressional District. 
Lance Corporal Schmitz was just 20 years 
old when the military transferred him from Jor-
dan to Afghanistan during the U.S. evacuation. 
Shortly after arriving in Kabul, Jared died 
while achieving his lifelong goal of serving the 
American People in the United States Marine 
Corps. 
Because 
of 
Jared’s 
and 
his 
fellow 
servicemembers’ sacrifice, thousands of Amer-
icans were able to return home safely. 
They ensured that thousands of families did 
not get the heartbreaking news Jared’s par-
ents received early in the morning of August 
27th. 
Because our servicemembers displayed a 
bravery most of us are not capable of, count-
less kids saw their mom and dad again. 
Brothers reunited with their sisters. 
And terrified parents got to hug their chil-
dren after days of worrying that day would 
never come. 
Nothing we can say on this floor will erase 
the pain far too many military families live with 
every day. 
No amount of gratitude nor a Congressional 
Gold Medal will change the fact that the 
Schmitz family and 12 others will forever have 
an unfillable hole in their hearts. 
But what we can do with this bill is remind 
them of what they hopefully already know: 
their loved-one represents the best of us. 
They are the American heroes who allow 
300 million people to live freely in the greatest 
country in the history of the world. 
Their loss is absolutely heartbreaking, but 
their sacrifice and their lives will never be for-
gotten. 
They will be remembered as the heroes 
they are and will live in the hearts of millions 
of grateful Americans forever. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WATERS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5142, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
THE 
CONGO—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–67) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits 
to the Congress a notice stating that 
the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In ac-
cordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publi-
cation the enclosed notice stating that 
the national emergency with respect to 
the situation in or in relation to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo de-
clared in Executive Order 13413 of Octo-
ber 27, 2006, is to continue in effect be-
yond October 27, 2021. 
The situation in or in relation to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
which has been marked by widespread 
violence and atrocities that continue 
to threaten regional stability, con-
tinues to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the foreign policy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
CONGRESSMAN JAMES H. BILBRAY 
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life and remember the ac-
complishments of Congressman James 
H. Bilbray. Jim was a native son of Ne-
vada who served as a judge, a univer-
sity regent, and a State legislator be-
fore being elected to the House of Rep-
resentatives from Nevada’s First Dis-
trict where he served from 1987 to 1995. 
Congressman Bilbray was a man 
ahead of his time. He was an early en-
vironmentalist before going green was 
considered cool. His legislation to pro-
tect Red Rock Canyon preserved a spe-
cial place for future generations. His 
legacy will live on in the magnificent 
formations, 
Native 
American 
petroglyphs, and iconic wildlife and 
flora and fauna found there. 
Madam Speaker, I ask now that the 
House observe a moment of silence in 
his honor.

AMERICA PROSPERS WHEN ELECT-
ED LEADERS PROTECT AMERI-
CANS’ CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 
AND FREEDOMS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
back in 2020 when the coronavirus vac-
cines were developed under the Trump 
administration, Joe Biden and progres-
sive Democrats trashed them in the 
media. As you can see from these

quotes, they were extremely skeptical 
about the effectiveness of coronavirus 
vaccines when Donald Trump was in 
charge. 
Of course, when Biden became Presi-
dent, the vaccine suddenly became en-
tirely effective and highly encouraged. 
But Jen Psaki still maintained in July 
that mandating these vaccines is ‘‘not 
the Federal Government’s role.’’ 
But now President Biden is forcing 
millions of Americans to choose be-
tween keeping their jobs or getting the 
vaccine. My office is flooded daily with 
calls from constituents who risk losing 
their livelihoods because of this admin-
istration’s mandate. Apparently, pro-
tecting Americans’ freedoms to make 
their own healthcare decisions is too 
much to ask. 
So far Joe Biden’s Presidency has 
been defined by his out-of-touch agen-
da. A vaccine mandate is not what 
Americans want and is inconsistent 
with 
our 
national 
values, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Tennesseans value freedom from gov-
ernment tyranny. That is why we elect 
leaders like Governor Billy Lee and 
members of the Tennessee General As-
sembly, who are fighting outrageous 
vaccine mandates. 
Our country prospers when elected 
leaders protect Americans’ constitu-
tional rights and freedoms. Unfortu-
nately, this is a radical concept to 
President Joe Biden. 
f 
EVERYONE DESERVES A FRESH 
START 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
millions of Americans, a minor or dec-
ades-old criminal record can pose an 
insurmountable barrier to full employ-
ment, housing, and education. All too 
often, individuals in this situation are 
unable to get a fresh start because hav-
ing eligible records sealed or expunged 
is so burdensome or expensive. 
Bureaucratic delays and high legal 
fees perpetuate the cycle of poverty 
and make it more difficult for people 
to transition back into society success-
fully after being incarcerated. 
That is why I was proud to join Rep-
resentative DAVID TRONE and a bipar-
tisan group of our colleagues from the 
House and the Senate to introduce leg-
islation last week to help these Ameri-
cans get the second chances they de-
serve. 
The Fresh Start Act of 2021 provides 
Federal grants for States with record 
sealing or expungement procedures to 
help improve their automated record 
infrastructure. 
As we rebound from a once-in-a-cen-
tury pandemic and in the name of fair-
ness and equity, we need to eliminate 
barriers to employment and champion 
opportunities for our communities to 
recover and thrive.

(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to express my continued concern and 
opposition to the efforts from the Dem-
ocrat majority to pass another $3.5 tril-
lion worth of unnecessary spending. 
If you ask any American right now 
what the biggest challenge they face is, 
it is inflation. We have inflation today 
primarily because of the last unneces-
sary spending that was passed in this 
House, and that was the $1.9 trillion 
stimulus bill that Democrats passed on 
a partisan basis in this House. That has 
led to inflation. 
We have more inflation than we have 
had in my adult lifetime. Yet, this 
body wants to continue to pass more 
unnecessary spending that will lead to 
more inflation. Enough is enough. We 
need to move on from this bill and take 
care of the business that the American 
people deserve Congress to address.

HONORING MANNY ONTIVEROS 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a great community 
leader 
and 
a 
good 
friend, 
Manny 
Ontiveros. 
As an Anaheim native and friend, 
Manny has devoted over 30 years of his 
life to serving the community, first as 
a trustee of the North Orange County 
Community College District and then 
as a Federal probation officer for al-
most 30 years. He was also a member of 
the Anaheim Parks and Recreation 
Commission 
and 
the 
Anaheim 
Independencia board of directors. 
Today, Manny is looking to retire 
from his Federal job as a Federal pro-
bation officer. I congratulate him and 
his family. Job great done. Career 
great done. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored that 
he calls me his friend, and everybody in 
the community is honored to have 
Manny Ontiveros serving us well.

ATLANTA BRAVES ADVANCE TO 
WORLD SERIES 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the Atlanta Braves for advancing to 
the World Series for the first time 
since 1999. 
In a season plagued by injuries, what 
the Braves have accomplished is noth-
ing short of remarkable. On August 1, 
the Braves had a losing record, and 
things were looking grim. Through 
much adversity, the Braves relied on 
some unlikely stars to shine in the 
postseason 
during 
the 
month 
of 
Joctober. 
What this team has achieved is noth-
ing short of special, and we hope to 
continue shocking the world. 
After caving to the lies of the Demo-
crats, Major League Baseball moved 
the All-Star game out of Atlanta, de-
priving the community of hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Well, you may be 
able to move the All-Star game, but 
you can’t move the World Series, and 
Truist Park is going to be electric. 
In addition to the players, I would 
also like to congratulate manager 
Brian Snitker and the rest of the 
coaching staff for the tremendous job 
they did in assembling and guiding this 
team to the 2021 World Series. Go 
Braves. 
f 
OBSESSION WITH ABORTION 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, a 
lot has been said about the reconcili-
ation bill that we may or may not vote 
on. Obviously, the spending is tremen-
dously out of control and will further 
fan the flames of inflation. There are 
several provisions in there designed, 
one more time, I would argue, to re-
place fathers and the family. 
Madam Speaker, today, I will ad-
dress, one more time, the majority’s 
obsession with abortion. We have al-
ready seen this cycle, efforts made in 
the White House to get rid of the Mex-
ico City policy and have the United 
States involved in pushing abortion 
around the world, kind of a very 
strange and sad thing given how 
blessed this country has been by the 
Almighty during our tenure. 
In this bill, one more time, be it in-
cluding $10 billion in public health 
funding grants that do not include the 
Hyde amendment, or abortion coverage 
for ObamaCare and plans covering indi-
viduals up to 138 percent of the Federal 
poverty line, this is one of the most ex-
treme pro-abortion bills that I have 
seen yet, and it is another reason not 
to vote for the reconciliation bill. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
DEREK ASDOT 
(Mrs. CAMMACK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute and to honor 
the life of my dear friend, Green Cove 
Springs Police Chief Derek Asdot. 
Chief Asdot passed away last month 
after a prolonged and hard-fought bat-
tle with COVID–19. 
He started his distinguished career in 
law enforcement with Duval County 
Schools and, in 2002, joined Green Cove 
Springs Police Department. During his 
nearly 20 years of service to the Green 
Cove Springs community, he served in 
multiple capacities, including patrol-
man, narcotics task force, and, finally, 
as chief of police starting in 2017.

He leaves behind a wonderful wife 
and two children, as well as a commu-
nity full of grateful citizens, grateful 
for his decades of faithful service to 
the community and its people and 
grateful for having had a chance to 
know a man like Derek. 
I am personally saddened by this 
loss. Chief Asdot was a friend, a men-
tor, and a colleague who showed me 
what selfless public service looks like. 
He did his duty with integrity, passion, 
grit, and I am forever thankful to have 
known him. 
Rest easy, Chief. We’ve got your 6.

VOTING RIGHTS UNDER ATTACK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
NEWMAN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
TORRES) is recognized for 60 minutes as 
the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on the 
subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, where did we get this notion 
that the filibuster is more worth pre-
serving than the right to vote? That is 
surely not the lesson of American his-
tory. That is surely not what we teach 
our students in the classroom or our 
children at home. Yet, that is the lie 
that dictates what happens here in the 
Nation’s Capitol, a lie that comes at a 
heavy cost to American democracy. 
It seems that there is nothing sacred 
in American politics—not the truth, 
not the peaceful transfer of power, not 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States, and, indeed, not even the right 
to vote. 
The enforcement mechanisms of the 
Voting Rights Act have been all but 
eviscerated. 
First, there is section 5, otherwise 
known as preclearance, which enables 
the executive branch, the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Justice, 
to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Then 
there is section 2, which enables the ju-
dicial branch, the courts, to enforce 
the Voting Rights Act. Both of these 
provisions have been gutted at the 
hands of rightwing judicial activism. 
The end of the Voting Rights Act as 
we know it has been a political wind-
fall for the Republican Party, which is 
intent on holding power by any means 
necessary, 
even 
if 
it 
means 
disenfranchising Black and Brown vot-
ers. 
We are here to tell you that the Con-
gressional Black Caucus will not stand 
by idly while the voting rights of Black 
Americans come under systematic as-
sault. We will fight back because fight-
ing is what we do in the Congressional 
Black Caucus and because there were 
many before us who were bloodied and 
bludgeoned and beaten so that we can 
have the right to vote. The least we 
can do is fight back. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), 
our dynamic leader, our dynamic chair. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman TORRES for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, it is indeed my 
honor to stand in this Chamber tonight 
to speak up, to speak out about voting 
rights, 
voter 
suppression, 
fighting 
back, disenfranchised, section 4, sec-
tion 5, section 2, all of which you will 
hear about tonight. 
We are here as members of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus because we 
want to make sure that all of our col-
leagues hear our story, a story that 
they, too, should know so well, the 
story of a lady by the name of Fannie 
Lou Hamer, a civil rights activist from 
Mississippi who didn’t even know that 
she could have had the right to vote. 
Recently, her granddaughter told 
that story. As I read that and thought 
about how she dedicated her life to vot-
ing rights, fast-forward, think about 
our beloved friend, colleague, mentor, 
the late Congressman John Lewis, who 
stood on this floor at this microphone 
and told us his story, told us about 
that day when he was crossing the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge, what it felt like— 
dogs, hose, police officers, knocked 
down, and could have died. 
But the story ends with a good mes-
sage because he would have done it all 
over again. He told us, if you see some-
thing, say something. He reminded us 
that it is our role to get in good trou-
ble. 
So tonight, we want our colleagues, 
especially those on the other side of 
the aisle, to know that this is one of 
our top priorities. We want them to 
know that four times Republican Presi-
dents reauthorized the Voting Rights 
Act. We want our colleagues in the 
Senate to know this should not be 
something that we are fighting over. 
This is something that we should be 
honoring and celebrating. 
As we gather here in this sacred 
Chamber, on the floor of the people’s 
House, to discuss voting rights in 
America, to amplify Our Power, Our 
Message, we boldly announce that we 
are not going to let the clock be turned 
back. 
Let me end by saying on behalf of the 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus that this is something that we 
are asking all of our colleagues to join 
in and help us make sure that we can 
proudly say that we are reauthorizing 
the Voting Rights Act. 
Madam Speaker, I close by saying 
the CBC will do everything in our 
power to defend the right to vote. We 
are prepared to work overtime. We are 
prepared to go what I like to call old 
school: stand up and make some noise, 
march, protest, and, yes, even get ar-
rested. 
b 1945 
I remember that day clearly, fight-
ing, marching, protesting. I thought of 
Fannie Lou Hamer. I thought of John 
Lewis and so many other soldiers, pio-
neers. I stand on their shoulders. 
Tonight, I ask us, let’s stand to-
gether. 
Madam Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure, as chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus to recognize the gentle-
woman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL), 
my colleague and my friend. 
I like to call her the current day 
mother of voting rights, fighting, and 
telling her story, leading us with John 
Lewis every year since I have been in 
Congress, and before, across that Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge. 
Listening to her so scholarly debate 
the lawsuits that we have been con-
fronted with, Shelby v. Holder. 
Listening to her explain preclearance 
and why we must fight and why we 
must have hearings. Why we must get 
it right because there is so much at 
stake. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL). 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the illustrious chair-
woman of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, JOYCE BEATTY, for her leadership. 
I want to thank RICHIE TORRES for 
leading us in this Special Order hour. 
Nothing could be more profound in this 
hour than to be talking about voting 
rights. 
As we speak, our Nation is facing the 
most concerted effort to restrict the 
right to vote in a generation. Just this 
year, 400 bills have been introduced in 
State legislatures across this Nation to 
restrict the right to vote. In 19 States, 
at least 33 of these bills have become 
law, including the most egregious of 
State legislatures, Georgia, where now 
it is a crime to give a bottle of water 
to a voter as they stand in line. 
Even as our democracy comes under 
attack, we see Republicans standing 
firm in their opposition to protecting 
the right to vote, a bedrock principle 
that should never be partisan. 
Just last week, we watched as every 
Senate Republican voted to block de-
bate on the Freedom to Vote Act, a 
commonsense bill that would ensure 
that every American has access to the 
ballot box. 
What are they afraid of, I ask? What 
are they afraid of? 
Last week’s vote made clear that 
Senate Republicans are unwilling to 
even debate voting rights, let alone 
hold a fair vote. This just further dem-
onstrates that in order to protect our 
democracy and the sacred right to 
vote; we must reform the filibuster to 
create a path forward for must-pass 
pieces of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, almost 3 weeks ago 
we saw Senator LEAHY introduce S. 4, 
the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act in the Senate. But 
unless we take action on the filibuster, 
and take action now, this critical bill

will face the same fate as the Freedom 
to Vote Act. 
The way I see it, every Senator is 
now faced with a choice: it is voting 
rights or the filibuster; it is protecting 
our sacred right to vote and our democ-
racy or the filibuster; it is advancing 
the legacy of John Lewis and the foot 
soldiers or it is a filibuster. 
Now, I know which side I am on. I 
hope our Senators will choose to do 
what is right and do away with an ar-
chaic procedural rule that has been 
used for decades to block racial justice 
in this country. 
President Biden also understands the 
urgency of this critical moment. On 
Thursday, at his town hall meeting, we 
heard President Biden express support 
for reforming the filibuster to pass 
must-needed voting rights legislation. I 
am glad that President Biden under-
stands the urgency of this moment and 
the dire need for Federal oversight. 
You know, it was Federal oversight 
that brought us the Civil Rights Act of 
1965. It was Federal oversight that al-
lowed those marchers to march across 
that Edmund Pettus Bridge in my 
hometown of Selma, Alabama. You 
know 
when 
State 
legislatures 
go 
amuck, it is Federal oversight that we 
need to ensure that every American 
has access to the ballot box. 
Madam Speaker, it was foot soldiers 
like our late, great colleague and my 
mentor, John Lewis, who shed blood on 
a bridge in Selma for the equal right of 
all Americans to vote. If protecting 
that sacred right is not worth over-
coming a procedural rule, then what is? 
Madam Speaker, it takes only 51 
votes to sit a Supreme Court Justice 
and for a Supreme Court Justice to 
have life tenure on the Supreme Court. 
51 votes. Yet, it takes 60 votes to stop 
debate and to allow a fair vote in the 
United States Senate on voting rights. 
This is unacceptable. It is un-Amer-
ican. It is unjust. 
We, in the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, are saying: This is our message. 
This is our fight. Voting rights. We 
have no other choice, we must reform 
the filibuster and we must do so now. 
When I think about the shoulders on 
which we all stand, I am reminded of 
being in this House in 2015 during the 
State of the Union. I had as my special 
guest none other than Amelia Boynton 
Robinson, who at that time was 103 
years old. She was the oldest living 
foot soldier that marched across the 
Edmund 
Pettus 
Bridge 
with 
John 
Lewis and so many others. 
In 2015, the 50th anniversary of the 
Selma to Montgomery march, she was 
my special guest. As we waited in a 
small room off of this Chamber for 
Barack Obama, then-President of these 
United States, to deliver that State of 
the Union, everyone wanted to take a 
picture with Ms. Amelia Boynton Rob-
inson. 
They kneeled by her wheelchair, and 
said: Ms. Amelia, we stand on your 
shoulders. Oh, Ms. Amelia, we wouldn’t 
be here if it wasn’t for your sacrifice. 
Well, Ms. Amelia was a little tired of 
people saying that to her over and over 
again. And when Eric Holder, the then- 
Attorney General of the United States, 
came and kneeled beside her, and said: 
Oh, Ms. Amelia, I stand on your shoul-
ders. She said: Get off my shoulders, all 
of you, do your own work—is what she 
said. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to say 
that we, the members of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, are doing our own 
work. We are standing firm, we are 
standing solid, we are standing united 
in our effort to bring back the full pro-
tections of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
We must do our own work, all of us. 
It is not enough to say that we stand 
on the shoulders of giants. We know 
these giants, our foremothers and our 
forefathers, they were tacticians, they 
were strategists. They just didn’t hap-
pen upon Selma, Alabama. They just 
didn’t happen upon Birmingham and 
Memphis and Atlanta. They went look-
ing for good trouble, and good trouble 
they got in. We must do the same. We 
must take a play from their playbook. 
We must stand firm. We must stand 
united. We must stand undeterred in 
our efforts to beat down any barrier 
that stands in the way of protecting 
that sacred right to vote. It was John 
Lewis who said that the vote is the 
most sacred, the most fundamental 
right, nonviolent tool in our democ-
racy. That is the vote. The vote is fun-
damental to this democracy, and ev-
erything else we do—well, everything 
else we do will be tainted if every 
American lacks the right to vote. 
There is nothing more sacred, more 
fundamental to this democracy, than 
the right to vote. 
How can a procedural rule stand in 
the way of that right? 
Now, I can tell you that my constitu-
ents back home don’t understand the 
filibuster. They don’t understand this 
archaic procedural rule that is in the 
Senate. When I tell them that that 
stands in the way of us passing the 
John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, they say: Why? Didn’t 
we go to the polls in record numbers in 
States all across this Nation, in south-
ern States like Georgia to deliver the 
democratic majority? And they ask of 
us to protect that democracy now. 
John Lewis said that our fight is not 
a fight for 1 day, it is not a fight for 1 
year, ours is a fight of a lifetime to se-
cure that sacred right to vote. When I 
close my eyes, I can hear him. Can’t 
you hear him? John Lewis said it firm-
ly, he said it often: When you see some-
thing that is not right, that is not fair, 
that is not just, we have a moral obli-
gation to stand up and do something 
about it. 
We in the Congressional Black Cau-
cus know that our message, our fight, 
our cause, is nothing if not to defend 
the sacred right to vote. It is a right 
that is fundamental to our democracy 
and that no elected official should seek 
to undermine, to restrict any voice in 
this democracy. 
Our vote is our voice in this rep-
resentative 
democracy. 
When 
you 
squelch the voice of one American who 
has that sacred right and is unable to 
exercise it because the lines are too 
long, because their names have been 
purged from a roll, it is a fundamental 
threat to all of us, injustice anywhere 
is a threat to justice everywhere. 
We know that. We live that. Martin 
Luther King told us that, but we live it 
every day. Nothing is more funda-
mental to our rights than our democ-
racy and its foundation, its bedrock, 
the right to vote. 
When Barack Obama came into that 
small room off of this Chamber, Amelia 
Boynton Robinson cradled his face. I 
think all of us understood the import 
of that moment. Here was the first Af-
rican-American 
President 
of 
these 
United States, and here was a woman, 
at 103 years old, who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice, bludgeoned on a bridge, 
shedding blood on a bridge in my home-
town of Selma, Alabama, so that all of 
us would have the right to vote and 
that one day she would see the fruits of 
her 
labor. 
Oh, 
what 
faith 
our 
foremothers and our forefathers must 
have had. Faith. Faith that their sac-
rifices were not in vain. 
And President Obama said: Oh, Ms. 
Amelia, to say thank you doesn’t seem 
adequate. I get to give a speech as the 
President of these United States, and it 
is because of you. Without missing a 
beat, this woman, 103 years old, frail, 
said: Oh, make it a good one. That bet-
ter be a very good speech. 
b 2000 
We should make every day a good 
one; we who are the inheritors of this 
legacy, and we who are the bene-
ficiaries of this movement. Every day 
should be a good one. We should not 
lay our head on a pillow if we have not 
advanced 
the 
legacy 
of 
these 
foremothers and forefathers. Every day 
should be a good one. 
So we call on the Senate to do what 
we know is right, to do what John calls 
good trouble. Get into some good trou-
ble. Let’s change those rules. We have 
it within our power to do so. After all, 
we control the Senate, we control the 
House, and we have the White House— 
gavels given to us by ordinary people 
who believed that we will take that 
power and exercise that power on their 
behalf. 
Nothing is more fundamental than 
the right to vote. So in the name of 
John Lewis, in the name of Amelia 
Boynton, and in the name of all of 
those known and unknown foot soldiers 
who have the audacity to make this 
Nation live up to its ideals of freedom, 
justice, and equality, are those empty 
words? 
We must breathe life into those con-
stitutional principles, and we can do so 
if we have the will to do what we know 
is right. 
A filibuster or voting rights? 
Upholding 
the 
legacy 
of 
our 
foremothers and forefathers or a fili-
buster?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5859 
October 25, 2021 
Making sure that we do all that we 
can to protect this democracy or a fili-
buster? 
The choices are easy from where I 
sit. They are easy from where our con-
stituents sit. 
I ask our Senators to do what they 
know is right. If ever there is a reason 
to reform the filibuster, it is for that 
constitutionally 
protected 
right 
to 
vote. We must do so, and we must do so 
now and pass S. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Let us restore the full protections of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Let us 
pass the Freedom to Vote Act. After 
all, the first 300 pages were written by 
John Lewis. His Voter Empowerment 
Act is about access to the ballot box. It 
is about making sure that the least of 
these—the voiceless—have a voice in 
this democracy. We must restore the 
vote and the voices of the excluded. 
We can do that. Congress can do that. 
That was what the Supreme Court said 
in the Shelby v. Holder decision: Only 
Congress can come up with a modern- 
day formula to secure the right to vote 
and to get at the most egregious State 
actors. We understand that we are 
threading a thin needle, but we have 
done our job and now the Senate must 
do its. Let’s get rid of the filibuster. 
Let’s reform the filibuster at the very 
least and ensure that every American 
has a right to vote and to ensure that 
their vote is counted. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS). 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank the chairwoman for her 
leadership of the Black Caucus for this 
opportunity, and I would like to thank 
my colleague from the great State of 
New York for his leadership and what 
he has done. 
After listening to the mother, as the 
chairwoman said, I don’t think it could 
have been expressed better. She did a 
fanatic job. 
Madam Speaker, in my home State of 
Pennsylvania, Republican majorities in 
the legislature are trying to stay in 
power by restricting people’s right to 
vote. For 7 years, Governor Wolf’s veto 
has protected voting rights, so they are 
trying to amend the State constitution 
to bypass him. 
We are seeing these types of voting 
suppression plans moving forward in 
several States as well as plans to over-
ride the votes after the votes have been 
cast. 
To those who want to suppress votes 
or throw out vote counts, why are you 
so afraid of the voters? 
Let me repeat that: Why are you 
afraid of the voters? 
Fortunately, Congress can still act. 
The House has acted twice. We have 
passed the For the People Act almost 8 
months ago on March 3, and we have 
passed the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act in August. 
Now the eyes of the Nation are on the 
Senate. 
Will the Senators let the filibuster 
gut the sacred right to vote? 
Personally, I would support an end to 
the filibuster but, I don’t get to vote on 
Senate rules. 
According to the Brookings Institute 
analysis, there are 161 exceptions to 
the filibuster already. Let me repeat 
that: 161 exceptions to the filibuster. 
Everything from executive branch and 
judicial appointments to budget rec-
onciliation, to fast-track trade agree-
ments, to military base closures and 
arms sales, but not for voting rights. 
There 
are 
161 
exceptions. 
Madam 
Speaker, you heard me just describe to 
you those exceptions. 
At a bare minimum, Senators who 
support voting rights need to create ex-
ception number 162 to the filibuster—a 
voting rights exception. The right to 
vote is the foundation of our democ-
racy. The right to vote is the founda-
tion of our democracy. 
Make that exception to the fili-
buster. Save our democracy. 
It is important to understand just at 
this moment, this is a moment in his-
tory. This is a moment. I had the pleas-
ure of serving with the late John Lewis 
on the Ways and Means Committee. 
And I watched him when I was growing 
up as he walked across the bridge. I 
was 10 years old. He demonstrated to 
all of us in this country what it means 
to be the conscience; very similar to 
Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY leading 
the Congressional Black Caucus. The 
Congressional Black Caucus is the con-
science of this Congress, and we stand 
here today to add our voices to make 
sure that people understand that we 
are in this fight, we were determined in 
every way that you can think of, 
Madam Speaker, to fight for that ex-
ception on the filibuster. We want to be 
clear and concise and let people know 
that we are not accepting this. This is 
something that is unacceptable. We 
must have the right to vote. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, first, 
I would like to thank Congresswoman 
and Chairwoman JOYCE BEATTY of the 
Congressional Black Caucus for her as-
tounding leadership and really being on 
the front lines for the Congressional 
Black Caucus, and I want to thank our 
colleague, RITCHIE TORRES, for his lead-
ership tonight on the floor for our Spe-
cial Order hour for voting rights. 
I really want to thank each and 
every one of my colleagues, whether 
they be members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus or just colleagues here in 
this body who have stood and fought 
for everyone’s right to exercise their 
right to vote, to exercise what is im-
portant to them in this country to be 
fully and freely an American. I want to 
thank each and every one of them be-
cause it is for that reason—those rea-
sons—that we are here tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today, like so 
many have done before me throughout 
the years, to stand for the right of 
every American citizen in this country 
to vote. 
During the civil rights movement, I 
was the child in the stroller at the 
March on Washington. I know many 
have heard me say before that my fa-
ther was president of the NAACP chap-
ter in Illinois, and I can still picture 
him to this day presiding over meet-
ings at our kitchen table in our home. 
Our house was always filled with vol-
unteers, civil rights leaders, and work-
ers as they were working on their post-
er boards, preparations, and getting 
ready for rallies and for marches as 
they were preparing to fight for a 
brighter world. 
From the time that I could walk as a 
young child, I was always marching 
with my family. I have joked with my 
colleagues over and over again that the 
very first song I think I really truly 
learned how to sing was ‘‘We Shall 
Overcome’’ because that is what we 
were singing. That is what I remember 
in my mind. I knew the words to that 
song because I knew that they had 
depth, and I knew they were so impor-
tant to my family. Even though I was 
so young and I didn’t understand what 
we were fighting for, I knew what my 
parents were doing was vitally impor-
tant to this Nation. 
I was raised by my parents to always 
fight for others, to fight for what is 
right, to stand up, to champion, to 
fight for the least of these, and to 
stand up so that every American’s 
voice is heard and that their voice is 
counted. 
I remember all the nights that my 
mother would put my sister and me in 
the car and we would travel all around 
Illinois passing out The Voice news-
paper which at that time was the Illi-
nois civil rights newspaper. I remember 
getting stuck in the mud at night and 
being out in parts of Illinois where we 
didn’t know where we were, but my 
mother put us in the car and did what 
she believed she had to do to make sure 
that the American people and people of 
color understood the fight that was 
going on on their behalf whether they 
were taking part in it or not, but that 
they understood and that they knew 
how important it was for them to be 
able to exercise what was important to 
them as human beings and as citizens 
in the United States of America. 
The struggle for voting rights was 
championed not only by my parents 
but was embodied by our great friend 
and colleague, Representative John 
Lewis. He inspired millions of Ameri-
cans, and that is still carried on today. 
That is still so vitally necessary today. 
I live in Georgia, and Georgia has had 
a profound and rich history of all the 
American civil rights stalwarts who 
fought on the front lines for the very 
voting rights that we still talk about 
to this day and that we are still having 
to protect and champion to this day: 
Representative John Lewis, Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King, Jo-
seph Lowery, C.T. Vivian, Ralph David 
Abernathy, and, of course, Andrew 
Young. 
These are the individuals who were 
on the front lines fighting for us—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5860 
October 25, 2021 
Members of Congress African Ameri-
cans—to be in this Chamber, to be in 
this House, to be in this body, and to 
represent the values and the dreams of 
not only people of our ilk but of the 
American people. 
b 2015 
Had it not been for those individuals, 
as Representative TERRI SEWELL has 
mentioned, the foremothers, the fore-
fathers, we would not be here today. 
Free and fair elections are the bed-
rock of American democracy. That is 
what this democracy was founded 
upon. 
As John Lewis used to say: ‘‘Freedom 
is not a state; it is an act. . . . Freedom 
is the continuous action we all must 
take, and each generation must do its 
part to create an even more fair, more 
just society.’’ Together, each and every 
one of us must do our part. 
When I think about the fact that my 
father worked so hard in the civil 
rights movement, that my father was 
there in the White House with Presi-
dent Lyndon Baines Johnson for the 
signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
and when I think about the fact that I 
am here as a Member of Congress be-
cause of the work that my forefathers 
and foreparents and civil rights work-
ers and leaders and volunteers and peo-
ple who just believed, just believed in 
what the Constitution said and meant, 
believed in that by exercising the right 
to vote, the fact that now we are still 
fighting for those same rights and that 
people live in jeopardy of having those 
rights taken away is unconscionable. 
For every American who fought or 
bled or died, gave their life for people 
to have the right to vote, what is hap-
pening in this body, what is happening 
in the Senate, is unconscionable. 
We are better than this. America is 
better than this. We have been that 
beacon for the world for the sense of 
democracy, and we must continue to be 
that very thing. 
Across America, we are standing up. 
Across America, we will lead the 
fight for free and fair elections. 
Across America, we will lead the 
fight to ensure that every American 
has the right to make their voice 
heard. 
Across America, we will lead the 
fight to create a more just society. We 
must. The times demand it. 
Every one of us in this body was born 
for a time such as this, and God de-
mands that of us at this time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for yielding. 
I rise today to urge the Senate to de-
fend the American people from the on-
going assault on their sacred right to 
vote. 
People of color are disproportion-
ately impacted by the recent onslaught 
of attacks on this fundamental right 
by certain State legislatures and par-
tisan litigators. This is only the latest 
salvo from a decades-long war on vot-
ing rights, a war that has always been 
and still is fueled by racism. But al-
though people of color are the primary 
targets of these attacks, we are not the 
only casualties. 
The right to vote is the foundation of 
any democracy. Without it, the United 
States would cease to be a government 
of, by, and for the people. Those are the 
stakes. This is a life-and-death issue 
for our country itself. 
Earlier this year, I proudly voted 
with most though, unfortunately, not 
all of my colleagues to designate 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
as a Federal holiday. With this vote, 
we recognized that America cannot 
truly be a free country until every 
American is free. 
Freedom cannot be conditional on 
who you are, where you live, what you 
look like, how many hours you work, 
what language you speak, or what bus 
you ride. That is why every attack on 
voting rights cracks the foundation of 
our democracy. If we allow it to keep 
crumbling away chip by chip, soon, the 
whole structure will collapse. 
Last 
week, 
Senate 
Democrats 
brought an urgently needed voting 
rights bill to the floor, where every sin-
gle Republican voted to defeat it. Of 
course, this defeat was made possible 
by the filibuster, an undemocratic pro-
cedural weapon that has been wielded 
for a century and a half to block anti- 
lynching legislation, civil rights, and 
voting rights. 
Americans are tired of seeing their 
rights sacrificed on the altar of the fili-
buster. Every Senator faces a choice 
about what is more important to pro-
tect, an antiquated procedural rule or 
our representative democracy. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to 
prioritize our democracy and ensure 
access to the ballot box is not under-
mined by restrictive State laws. A de-
mocracy for some is not a democracy 
for all. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, how much time do I have left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 16 minutes remaining. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. I will use 
far fewer than 16 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, the lesson of history 
is State and local governments cannot 
be trusted to respect voting rights in 
the absence of Federal oversight. Fed-
eral voting rights enforcement is essen-
tial, as essential as the right to vote 
itself. And the most powerful tool for 
voting 
rights 
enforcement 
is 
preclearance. Preclearance has been so 
effective that, from 1965 to 2006, it kept 
1,200 State and local voting restrictions 
from taking effect. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Act 
would restore preclearance as the gold 
standard of voting rights enforcement, 
not only for some States but for all. 
The John Lewis Voting Rights Act 
makes real the creed of America, lib-
erty and justice for all. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
DEMOGRAPHICS IS OUR BIGGEST 
THREAT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I am going to try something for the 
next hour, and it is going to be one of 
those presentations that is always a 
little on the difficult side because we 
are going to talk about things a lot of 
this place and a lot of the country 
doesn’t want to hear, but we call it 
math. 
The first premise, I need to ask all of 
us, if I were to walk into a room of 
Democrats, people on the left, or peo-
ple on the right, and say, ‘‘What is the 
biggest threat over the next couple of 
decades that is facing your country?’’ 
you would hear all sorts of things. 
You know, a couple of years ago, 
with the Democrats, it was Russia, 
Russia. Today, it may be this and that. 
I am going to argue it is demographics. 
And you go, huh? 
We are going to do almost 38 boards 
here, walking through the national 
debt, deficit spending, spending prior-
ities, and the reality on where there 
are revenues, taxes, what we call re-
ceipts. Then you have to ask yourself, 
does the next generation, and the gen-
eration after that, and the generation 
after that, do they have the right to 
live in a country where there is some 
prosperity, or has Washington, D.C., 
decided to just destroy those who are 
heading toward retirement, those who 
are heading toward elementary school 
and their future? 
Let’s actually sort of walk through 
some of the realities of the math. And 
I am not going to even bother with 1965 
and what the mix was. 
You have to understand, in 2021, 77 
percent of all the spending in this 
place, 77 percent of all the spending, 
was what we called mandatory, for-
mula, Social Security, Medicare, for-
mulas. Only 10 percent was defense, 
and 13 percent was everything else in 
government. 
If you like to think that, well, you 
have lots of prodefense Democrats and, 
obviously, 
prodefense 
Republicans, 
then mandatory is a formula that you 
don’t even vote on here. You are elect-
ing Members of Congress to come and 
vote on 13 percent of the spending in 
this budget cycle. This is how out of 
whack it is. And we are going to walk 
through how much of this mandatory is 
demographics. 
Look, getting older is not Republican 
or Democrat, but it is math. It is going 
to happen. So let’s actually walk 
through a couple of the realities here. 
I just threw this chart together. I 
know it is impossible to read on cam-
era and those things. But the point is 
simple. Today, Social Security is 23 
percent of all the spending; national 
defense is 15; Medicare is 14. In a couple 
of years, all those change. I could even

October 25, 2021 
show you some charts that, if interest 
rates tick up even a little bit, defense 
actually starts to fall to fourth very, 
very soon. 
To give you an idea, when you actu-
ally get up in front of audiences—and 
for conservative audiences, the folklore 
a decade ago was, well, waste and 
fraud, foreign aid, and then you would 
pull out this chart and show that it is 
a fraction of a percent. 
Fine, maybe we should do something 
different in foreign aid. Yes, the spend-
ing from this year has massive fraud in 
it. But the long-term impact of those is 
nothing compared to the fact—and I 
am going to have to be honest and have 
a conversation about how we save, how 
we protect Medicare and Social Secu-
rity, because what is going on around 
this place—you get politician after pol-
itician behind these microphones and 
saying, I am going to protect Medicare, 
and I am going to protect your Social 
Security, while they are driving it into 
the ground. 
So let’s actually start to walk 
through how fast it is eroding. From 
2019 to 2031—and 2031 is what? How 
many years from now? It is function-
ally nine budget cycles from now. We 
will have doubled debt. You have to un-
derstand how fast this is eroding from 
us. 
The more current numbers, because 
this slide was done about a year or two 
ago, it is actually much worse with the 
spending during the pandemic. So let’s 
actually start to also walk through 
what we need to understand. Social Se-
curity, healthcare, entitlements, and 
interest costs drive 90 percent of the 
2008 to 2031 spending hikes. 
Let’s back that up. If you take a look 
at Social Security, Medicare, and then 
the interest attached to those, that is 
what drives the deficit. 
Remember our earlier comment: It is 
our demographics. And this place is un-
willing to actually have honest con-
versations of how we are going to pro-
tect access to those earned benefits be-
cause the numbers are so big and so 
scary. 
What do you have? What do you have 
here even today? Member after Member 
running to the microphones talking 
about how we are going to functionally 
give away more. 
But if you are under 50, we are about 
to make your future—as a matter of 
fact, it is already baked into the cake. 
Your future is really dangerous right 
now. 
b 2030 
So let’s actually walk a little bit 
more through what the slides look like. 
Rising Social Security and Medicare 
shortfalls drive nearly entire 2019 to 
2031 nonpandemic—so this is before the 
pandemic—and you start to understand 
that this is before the pandemic cal-
culations. We were heading towards 
about $2.2 trillion a year in borrowing 
before the pandemic. That is the base-
line number. 
When you actually start to really un-
derstand that—this is the general reve-
nues. And when you start to add up all 
the shortfalls, you are heading towards 
a time where functionally a 30-year 
government 
is 
living 
on 
borrowed 
money. 
So let’s actually do a little bit more. 
You have all seen this slide. Lots of 
people like to use it. You know, the na-
tional debt is set to match the World 
War II peak within a decade. Well, 
guess what? We are pretty much there. 
We have pretty much now have hit 
what they call the percentage of GDP. 
Why do we use that? Because there is 
this theory that says the size of the 
economy is what allows you to borrow 
money, and as long as you don’t borrow 
too much money where the interest 
costs start to burden the availability of 
what they call capital stock, for an 
economy to grow, the economy to have 
new investments. 
The fear is—remember, it wasn’t that 
long ago we used to talk about, well, 
when we hit 100 percent of GDP, that 
means the borrowing, the publicly bor-
rowed money will be the size of the 
economy. Guess what? We have already 
surpassed that. We have done it. 
You are going to see some boards 
here that should terrify you. 
Long-term baseline. Now, I have got 
to give credit where credit is due. Man-
hattan Institute, Brian Riedl, basically 
what he does is take the CBO numbers, 
and I think some from Joint Tax, and 
tries to make them digestible. He also 
lays out what the short-term, which is 
10-year, 20-year, and 30-year layouts 
are. You can go right now to that 
website 
and 
download 
these 
same 
charts for yourself. 
But the long-term baseline shows ab-
solutely unsustainable debt; and this 
side has gotten worse since last year 
when we printed it, because it actually 
had in 2050. So functionally in less than 
30 years, we were approaching up to 195 
percent of debt, borrowed money, the 
size of the total economy, so function-
ally twice the size of the economy. 
That number has actually now gotten 
much worse because of what we have 
done in the pandemic financing and a 
whole bunch of the other promises that 
have come in and the other spending 
that has happened during unified gov-
ernment from the left. 
So once again, trying to actually 
demonstrate, it is not falling revenues. 
We have dozens of charts—and I only 
brought a couple of them—on the slide 
deck that make it very clear, when you 
look at—and this redline is what in 
Ways and Means we would call re-
ceipts. Most people think of it as tax 
revenues. It is basically where it has 
always been. 
If you actually go back to the 1960s 
and 1970s, it was about 17.3 percent of 
GDP came in as revenues, as taxes. 
Now, we are actually heading towards 
a time where it is about 18.5 percent. 
So it is actually higher. But what is 
this line here? You see this? Okay, that 
is the pandemic. 
But then you get back to the trend 
line. Why is the trend line exploding in 
that direction with 31.8 percent more 
spending than revenues? It is demo-
graphics, healthcare costs. 
So let’s actually do another one. 
Medicare part A and Social Security 
trust funds face bankruptcy. The Medi-
care trust fund is gone in about 6 years. 
Remember, post tax cuts and reform, 
you know, when we reformed the tax 
code, because the economy was grow-
ing so fast and so many people were 
working, we actually at that time went 
from 4 years left in the part A trust 
fund of Medicare—remember, only the 
hospital portion of Medicare has a 
trust fund. Everything else comes out 
of the general fund. We actually added 
a couple of years, because there were so 
many people working and, therefore, 
paying their FICA taxes. 
But does this concern anyone that 
the Social Security trust fund is gone? 
The Medicare, the hospital portion of 
the trust fund, is gone in functionally 
5 years. Is anyone paying attention? 
Or, once again, will we try to manage 
this by crisis? But the scale of these 
numbers is just stunning, and then we 
live in this financial fantasy world in 
this place. 
Here is the slide. I have done a 
version of this slide for a decade now, 
and I have been booed in front of audi-
ences for telling them the truth. There 
is something wrong in our psyche when 
we are so used to politicians lying to us 
that we almost want them to not tell 
us the truth; it hurts too much. 
Now, I have been on this floor dozens 
and dozens and dozens of time saying 
there is a path. The future doesn’t have 
to be this dystopian, debt-laden finan-
cial collapse. There is a path. But you 
have to have a revolution in the cost of 
healthcare and economic growth. There 
is a series of things, and you have to do 
all of them together. 
The thing that terrifies me the most 
is how many times do you have anyone 
come behind these microphones and 
talk about the scale of the debt that is 
coming or solutions to it. 
The fact of the matter is, I don’t 
know if our public votes on this. God 
knows, you don’t raise money telling 
people the truth about what is going 
on. But I have a 6-year-old daughter. 
Doesn’t she deserve to live in a pros-
perous country? Because this is going 
to crush prosperity for everyone, and it 
is going to wipe out lots of people in re-
tirement. 
Once again, you have got to under-
stand, this chart, this is Congressional 
Budget Office numbers, which say in 
about 29 years, we have $112 trillion of 
borrowing, debt. This is an inflation 
adjusted number, so this is in constant 
dollars. 
You are going to notice, the entire 
30-year debt comes from Medicare and 
then Social Security. The rest of the 
budget is actually in balance. 
If this place isn’t willing to have a 
revolution in the cost of delivering 
healthcare to our brothers and sisters 
and our seniors, our future is really 
ugly.

October 25, 2021 
You have got to understand. There is 
a fraud around here. You will get peo-
ple from the left saying, well, we 
should do Medicare for all. Medicare 
for all is a financing bill. It does noth-
ing 
to 
the 
cost 
of 
healthcare. 
ObamaCare, the ACA, was a financing 
bill. It was about who got subsidized 
and who had to pay. The Republican al-
ternative was a financing bill. It was 
about who had to pay and who got sub-
sidized. None of them are doing things 
that change the cost of healthcare. 
I didn’t bring the slide here, because 
I did it just 2 weeks ago, that shows 31 
percent of Medicare spending is just di-
abetes. The single most powerful thing 
you could do to help the United States 
in its sovereign debt and to end misery 
in our minority communities and my 
Tribal communities out in Arizona is 
do an operation warp speed, go after 
type 2 diabetes. Isn’t that something 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
could 
agree upon? And guess what? It has 
amazing economic impact. 
We are working on a math problem 
right now. We actually believe solving 
diabetes could be one of the single big-
gest things you could do to income in-
equality, because you take a look at 
some of our urban minority popu-
lations that suffer from diabetes and 
some of my Tribal communities out 
west, and if you normalize, saying, 
what would happen—what would this 
population’s income and prosperity 
look like if you cured diabetes, that in-
come inequality number shrinks dra-
matically. It is not a bunch of transfer 
payments; it is solving people’s misery. 
But it is a little hard campaigning on 
something that is complicated, isn’t it? 
So this is the slide, out of everything 
I am going to show, that I actually see 
in my dreams. It really, really bothers 
me, because I don’t have really elegant 
ways to explain how dystopian this 
number is. 
Projected 2051 budget deficits are en-
tirely driven by Social Security and 
Medicare. But do you see this number 
here? It is basically saying almost 21 
percent of the entire GDP will be out-
lays for Social Security and Medicare, 
but revenues will only be 6 percent. 
This gap here is solely living on bor-
rowed money. This over here is the rest 
of the budget. Turns out that for the 
rest of the budget, revenues are out-
pacing the spending. That is all other 
government. That is defense, that is 
environment, that is everything, in-
cluding education. But this gap right 
here is what brings us to that $112 tril-
lion of borrowing in the next 29 years. 
You have got to get your head around 
this. That is assuming the CBO num-
bers, that there are no recessions, 
there are no economic slowdowns, 
there are no major terrorists attacks 
that slow down the economy, and there 
is not another pandemic. That is a 
baseline number. Do you understand 
how fragile we have made this economy 
because we are unwilling to tell the 
truth about these numbers? 
I had a political consultant once tell 
me: SCHWEIKERT, you can’t tell the 
truth about the debt and financing, be-
cause it will get you unelected. I am 
incredibly blessed. I represent North 
Maricopa County, so Scottsdale, Care-
free, Cave Creek, Paradise Valley, 
Fountain Hills. I represent a bunch of 
really smart people, and they are not 
happy when I show them this, but they 
understand it is math. 
I don’t get my head around how this 
becomes partisan, because you are 
going to see, if you take a look at the 
pieces of legislation the left drops, 
they are trying to expand the programs 
at the same time they are collapsing. I 
mean, the lunacy. 
So let’s take a look, do the same 
thing, trying to get our heads around 
this. Remember, this slide was done be-
fore the pandemic scale of borrowing, 
which we are going to be paying inter-
est on that for decades and decades and 
decades, because we never pay it off. 
Social Security faces functionally a 
$35 trillion shortfall over the next 30 
years. Now, it is 29 years. $32 trillion, if 
you include the trust fund balance. So 
functionally just Social Security has a 
$32 trillion shortfall over the next 29 
years, okay? 
Oddly enough, we could sit down 
around the table, and that $32 trillion 
shortfall on Social Security, we can 
figure that out, because being a defined 
benefit system as it is, the math, you 
have about a dozen or two dozen levers 
where you can say we are going to stop 
subsidizing really, really, really rich 
people, we are going to do this, we are 
going to do that. There are to deal with 
that. 
The one that is just brutal, math- 
wise, is this one. So Social Security is 
$32 trillion short. Medicare is $78 tril-
lion short. And this one is much more 
difficult. Yet, the solution around here 
is, well, we will just subsidize more 
people and borrow the money. 
There is a path, but you have got to 
be willing to functionally legalize tech-
nology 
and 
disrupt 
the 
cost 
of 
healthcare. 
And there are some amazingly good 
things happening. Actually, with the 
messenger RNA, there are so many dis-
eases that, if we invest in, we could ac-
tually cure misery today and reap the 
benefits in the future. And I have only 
come to the floor dozens of times try-
ing to share that math. 
So once again, let’s take a look. This 
is also something that is disharmo-
nious to what a lot of people believe. 
The typical retiring couple—and this is 
before the pandemic—will receive $3 in 
Medicare for every dollar they paid in. 
Now, Social Security, you function-
ally get really close to what you put 
into it. Social Security is a fairly 
square deal. Medicare, we have a prob-
lem. 
That typical retiring couple, 2 years 
ago, when Brian Riedl was doing this 
math, would put in about $161,000 in a 
lifetime, and they were taking out, or 
receiving benefits, of about $522,000. 
That gap right there is almost the sole 
primary driver of most of the U.S. sov-
ereign debt over the next 30 years. 
If we are willing to actually have an 
honest conversation of what do we do 
to 
keep 
our 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
healthy, to provide access and re-
sources, but do it in a modern way and 
could we bend this cost differential 
here? Because if we do that—remem-
ber, we were just talking a moment 
ago. Thirty-one percent of this is just 
diabetes in our seniors. If you took 
that on, that is the single greatest 
thing you could do to bending this 
curve and saving the economic future 
of this society. 
b 2045 
We also need to deal with a bit of the 
folklore. Now, this is folklore that 
comes from the left. You do realize the 
Tax Code has already been getting 
more progressive. You do realize the 
2017 tax reform was more progressive 
than the Tax Code before 2017. 
And look, when you actually go back 
to the 1980s, 1990s, the top 20 percent at 
that time were all paying about 60 per-
cent of all income taxes. Today, they 
are paying 70 percent. This is the top 20 
percent. 
So it is folklore. Now, it is good po-
litical folklore. It is good campaign 
folklore. We are going to make the rich 
pay their fair share. Fine, stop sub-
sidizing them. 
We have already done a demonstra-
tion here repeatedly that we come up 
with a trillion, a trillion-four over 10 
years of direct subsidies to the really, 
really, really rich. So the absurdity 
that is in the current tax plan being of-
fered by the Democrats is: Let’s do 
this. Let’s raise their taxes. Oh, by the 
way, wink, wink, nod, nod, you make 
$800,000 a year, we are going to give you 
tax credits of $118,000 if you buy what 
Democrats tell you to buy. 
Okay. Why not go further? Why not 
remove the trillion, trillion-four in di-
rect subsidies that we give to the rich 
and then put that toward balancing 
some of these—well, actually slowing 
the erosion? Because you are not going 
to balance this. 
Any politician that gets up and says 
we are going to balance the budget; we 
are going to pay off the debt and defi-
cits isn’t being forthright. Our job is 
just to stabilize it at this point because 
the numbers are so large. If you get 
someone 
that 
comes 
behind 
these 
microphones and throws out the rhet-
oric of, well, it is foreign aid, it is 
waste and fraud. Well, we are going to 
balance the budget by doing this. Buy 
them batteries for their calculator be-
cause they obviously don’t have them. 
This comes back to dealing with the 
reality. No defense cuts, taxing mil-
lionaires cannot finance current defi-
cits. The progressive wish list. The pro-
posals that the left has proposed this 
year functionally—the free college, the 
job guarantees, the Medicare for all— 
you start to add that up, and if you 
start to wipe out everything else, you 
functionally have just blown up the 
deficit by another 34 percent. The math 
just doesn’t work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5863 
October 25, 2021 
So let’s actually sort of walk through 
this. It is important. President Biden 
promised in his campaign $11 trillion of 
new spending over 10 years. $11 trillion 
in new spending. And look, they are all 
cited. They are either CBO or Com-
mittee for a Responsible Budget. But 
you start to look at it, this is just the 
campaign promises of $11 trillion of 
new spending on top of what is the $4- 
plus trillion baseline budget, plus the 
couple trillion additional we did over 
the last two years. 
Now you have, what was it, the origi-
nal scoring of the Build Back Better 
plan was, what? They claimed $31⁄2—but 
it really scored out to $5, $51⁄2 trillion. 
This is the lunacy we are at. 
And, yet, if you come and add up 
every potential tax hike the left talks 
about—you 
know, 
get 
rid 
of 
any 
changes we did in tax reform that cre-
ated the great growth—you actually 
start to take all income over $200,000 
and just take 50 percent of it. Hey, you 
make $200,000, we take 50 percent of it. 
You do all the tax hikes that are on 
the entire list of the Democrats. Over a 
decade, you functionally raise $12 tril-
lion. Okay. The deficit already pro-
jected before the pandemic was going 
to be over $13 trillion at that time. And 
that is not assuming you just blew up 
the economy, you slowed down growth. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 33 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I know this is a lot of boards, but in 
some ways you need it to try to drill 
in. We hate talking about this around 
here. I can’t tell you—I will start to do 
these presentations even with some of 
my conservative brothers and sisters, 
and they run away from me. But it is 
the math. 
The 
progressive 
programs 
over-
whelmingly benefit the rich. This is 
one of my fixations here because I 
think this is something the left and 
those of us on the right could actually 
come to an agreement on. Let’s stop 
subsidizing the rich. The things we pro-
vide to families with high incomes, and 
you 
actually 
walk 
through 
the 
amount—we actually brought a presen-
tation to the floor a couple weeks ago 
and showed a trillion, a trillion-four- 
hundred-thousand dollars that goes to 
the very top quartile. That is the lu-
nacy that is going on around here, we 
want to tax the rich, but we are going 
to turn around and hand it back to 
them. You know, if it is my fourth 
house and I happen to buy it on a 
beach, should I be getting subsidized 
flood insurance? 
The Biden budget proposals would 
add $8.8 trillion in debt over the next 
decade, and that is with the Biden tax 
hikes. How often are we talking about 
that around here? That is how CBO 
scores it. 
Even eliminating all defense spend-
ing doesn’t get you close to actually 
making a difference in the long-term 
debt. 
Think of this. This is the defense 
line. And the baseline is basically pro-
jected to sit about now for the future 
decades at about 31⁄2 to 4 percent of 
GDP. But you start taking a look and 
go out to that 2050 number, we are at 
almost 16 percent of GDP. The size of 
the economy will just be the spending 
on Social Security and Medicare. Does 
anyone sort of see a difference, hey, 4 
to 16? 
This is the reality, but yet, we will 
get people who will come behind these 
microphones, Members, and say, if we 
would cut defense, if we would do this, 
we will balance it. No, you won’t. That 
is not the math, and you know it is not 
the math. We need to stop misin-
forming—my wife would refer to it as 
lying—the public and start telling the 
truth and treat them like adults about 
what is going on. 
Remember, the problem ultimately 
isn’t Republican or Democrat. It is de-
mographics. We as a society have made 
lots of promises, and if we are going to 
keep them, we need to tell the truth 
about the math. 
It turns out the growth in the econ-
omy is crucial, even with my most op-
timistic math. When we have come 
here and said we can have a revolution 
in the cost of delivering healthcare, we 
can do all these things, the linchpin of 
it is you must have the economic 
growth. 
You actually take a look during 
when President Obama oversaw about 
half a trillion of new taxes, and we 
functionally lost $3.2 trillion of eco-
nomic expansion. If we are going to 
raise taxes, you have got to think it 
through in a way that what is the eco-
nomic growth effect at the end of the 
decade, the next decade, and the decade 
after that. Because if we don’t keep 
growing the size of this economy, that 
ratio of borrowing—because the bor-
rowing is exploding. If you aren’t grow-
ing the economy as fast, there is a 
technical economic term for it. It is 
called ‘‘We are screwed.’’ 
Even a 100 percent tax rate on small 
businesses and upper-income families 
could not come close to balancing the 
long-term budget. Take everything. 
Take all the money from upper income. 
Take all the money from small busi-
nesses, and you still don’t get close to 
balancing. 
We all know this. Why is this place 
so incapable of telling the truth? I 
mean, are we that addicted to the 
spending? Our constituents, our voters, 
our contributors, are they that ad-
dicted to us handing them checks? 
But this is the basic chart. It makes 
it very, very clear. You can’t solve the 
long-term budget even if you go out 
and confiscate 100 percent of small 
businesses’ wealth and the upper in-
come’s wealth. 
Here’s where the reality should be 
terrifying you. National debt is pro-
jected to leap from 200 percent to 328 
percent of GDP, depending on if those 
Biden proposals pass and if there are 
any interest rate changes. So you start 
taking a look at this. When you start 
to see $328 trillion of spending in 28 
years, 29 years, you get this sort of 
number, if the Biden proposals pass and 
interest rates go up by 1 percent. You 
have got to understand how fragile we 
are. 
Is there anyone around here that is a 
fan of Taleb, the guy that wrote 
‘‘Black Swan?’’ In ‘‘Antifragile’’, he 
talks about how you can see these 
things coming, do things not to make 
yourself—because there are going to be 
other economic black swans. We have 
made this country incredibly, economi-
cally fragile because these numbers are 
coming. 
Now, this one happens to come if the 
Biden administration and the Demo-
crats here get their proposals. But even 
if they don’t, you are still well over 200 
percent of debt-to-GDP as the baseline. 
The share of Federal tax revenues 
spent on interest on the national debt 
is projected to surge. Okay. 
Here’s a simple thought experiment. 
Today interest, with our incredibly low 
interest rates, is about 9 percent of 
GDP. If we get two points of an inter-
est rate hike, in 2051, 100 percent of 
GDP is just interest. 
Doesn’t this terrify anyone else? I 
can’t be alone in looking at these num-
bers and just panicked for my society, 
for my country, my daughter. 
Since 1990, nondefense discretionary 
spending has grown four times faster 
than defense. This is important be-
cause we keep seeing people come be-
hind these microphones talking about 
the skyrocketing cost of defense. Non-
discretionary is growing four times 
faster. Over the last 20 years, four 
times faster. And you saw it in the 
opening slide that basically said 70 per-
cent of all of our spending is manda-
tory today, 10 percent is defense, and 
everything else is what we really get to 
vote on. 
Coronavirus legislation—and we are 
all guilty on this; Democrats substan-
tially more guilty, but we are all 
guilty—pushed the 2020 and 2021 Fed-
eral spending past $50,000 per house-
hold. So if you are a household out 
there during this pandemic cycle, do 
you feel you got $50,000 worth of value? 
Because you are going to pay for it for 
the rest of your lives, the rest of your 
kids’ lives, the rest of your grandkids’ 
lives with lots of interest. Function-
ally, this spike you see here was $50,000 
per household. That is what we did dur-
ing the pandemic. 
And you have got to understand, we 
have had an incredible free ride the 
last couple years. The Federal Reserve 
has functionally financed our debt. And 
now we are financing our own infla-
tion. 
I am sure some of you have been to a 
grocery store, filled up your gas tank. 
Welcome to what happens when you do 
Keynesian economics. 
Here’s the reality: Do you see the lit-
tle line down here? This is China. This 
is Japan. This is the rest of the world. 
This is the Federal Reserve. The Fed-
eral Reserve is functionally about five

times more financing our debt than 
China and Japan together. We are play-
ing a shell game ourselves. We are fi-
nancing our own debt. And then you 
wonder why you have inflation. 
b 2100 
And we have all been in this body, 
and I know there is always angst when 
we get near the debt ceiling, but the 
fact of the matter is if you take a look 
at the last 40 years, almost the only 
times we have actually had any at-
tempt to bend the spending curve, bend 
the borrowing curve, bend the debt 
curve have been out of negotiations to 
raise the debt ceiling. 
Budget deals, we have had a number 
of them. Remember the Budget Control 
Act and some of the others? 
Now, the problem is, we have had 
some of these where we set base lines 
and they were actually sort of working, 
and then this place all runs away from 
them. But there is a fraud in those, and 
that was they were always tied to dis-
cretionary spending, not the manda-
tory that is functionally driving the 
debt. 
Some of my brothers and sisters on 
the left have said, well, it was tax re-
form. That is just not true. If you actu-
ally look at the contributor debt, if ev-
erything from tax reform was extended 
permanently, it is a tiny fraction, and 
that is assuming without CBO—remem-
ber CBO wasn’t giving us the value for 
all the economic growth we particu-
larly had in 2018 and 2019. But that is 
not the math. 
And the six major deficit reduction 
deals that we have had since 1983, if 
you take a look at them, almost all of 
it was under discretionary. It saved us 
some money in interest. We did raise 
some more taxes. We did a little bit in 
the early eighties under Ronald Reagan 
on mandatory Social Security, but you 
take a look at them, and they had a 
pretty darn impressive effect. Remem-
ber the surpluses in the late nineties? 
But today we have let it get away from 
us. 
And you take a look at what became 
of the $1.7 billion in promised—remem-
ber 2013 until this year there was sup-
posed to be about $1.7 trillion in func-
tional reductions in spending? Do you 
remember the Budget Control Act? Ex-
cept what happened? 
Well, time after time both Repub-
licans and Democrats came here and 
whittled it away because we wanted to 
spend more money, and we lost much 
of the value. So we did gain about a 
trillion dollars of savings over those 10 
years. It could have been double that if 
we hadn’t whittled it away. 
The last thing, and I hope our broth-
ers and sisters on the left will actually 
step up and help us on this one. The 
current number is actually substan-
tially higher than this because this 
slide now is a couple months old, but 
we think we have identified over $200 
billion in functionally missed and 
fraudulent claims and payments during 
the pandemic. You have seen some of 
the crazy stories of how much fraud 
there has been in unemployment in 
California. 
We need to tell the truth about the 
healthcare costs, Medicare driving our 
debt. But I believe in a holistic theory. 
You need to go after everything. You 
need to go after what we know is the 
fraud from the last 2 years. We also 
need to tell the truth about bending 
the curve on delivering healthcare. And 
there are ways to do it. This place just 
needs to stop being so fearful of telling 
the truth about the debt and deficits 
because if we don’t grow up and take 
this head on it is going to take our 
head off. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
THOUGHTS ON ADDRESSING 
ECONOMIC DISPARITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mr. 
HIMES) for 28 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted as chairman of the Select 
Committee on Economic Disparity to 
welcome the ranking member and the 
Republican appointees to this very im-
portant committee for this Special 
Order where I think the members of 
our committee are going to try to 
highlight some of the early and initial 
thoughts that we have on how we 
might address this issue of economic 
disparity. 
I will note that in our first hearing 
one of our witnesses called this com-
mittee ‘‘a committee of historic poten-
tial.’’ It is based on the National Eco-
nomic Committee of 1938, and that 
committee operated in a moment of 
economic crisis worse than any of us 
have seen in our lifetimes really since 
the Great Depression. 
The Great Depression showed Amer-
ica that far too many citizens of the 
richest and most powerful country in 
the world could be impoverished by un-
predictable forces beyond their control. 
It showed that free market cap-
italism was both an unparalleled en-
gine of economic growth, and if left un-
regulated, subject to manipulation, in-
different to fairness, and prone to col-
lapse as it did in the early 1930s. 
In most respects, the American econ-
omy is more stable and the safety net 
is more robust than it was 80 years ago, 
but today our economy demonstrates 
more income and wealth disparity and 
less mobility than it ever has. And, 
Madam Speaker, that is not a red prob-
lem or a blue problem. It is not a 
northern or a western or an eastern 
problem. It affects every single one of 
our communities, every single one of 
our districts. 
It is not a trivial problem. Market 
economies don’t work if they are per-
ceived as fundamentally unfair. Our 
Democratic political system rests now 
uneasily on the premise that every 
American counts equally. Economic 
mobility, the idea that hard work and 
playing by the rules allows one to 
climb the ladder has always been essen-
tial to our understanding of ourselves. 
It defines the American Dream, and 
yet, when my parents were born, more 
than 90 percent of American children 
could expect to make more money than 
their parents. Today, fewer than half 
the children will outearn their parents. 
Madam Speaker, I see this every day 
at home. Some of the towns I represent 
in 
Connecticut’s 
so-called 
‘‘Gold 
Coast’’ include some of the wealthiest 
people on the planet, but a 15-minute 
drive from their neighborhoods will 
take them into cities with horrendous 
poverty and neighborhoods where op-
portunity is scarce at best. 
Addressing that issue in a thoughtful 
way, in a bipartisan way is the remit of 
this committee. 
Having made that point, before we 
enter into a colloquy, I yield to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL), 
my friend and the ranking member of 
the Select Committee on Economic 
Disparity and Fairness in Growth to 
make any comments he wishes to 
make. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Connecticut for 
yielding. 
It is great to be joining him here on 
the House floor to share with our col-
leagues the important work that lies 
ahead for the Select Committee on 
Economic Disparity and Fairness in 
Growth. Simply put, we will be explor-
ing, questioning, and hearing potential 
ways to address economic challenges 
we are seeing across this country. We 
are, in fact, on a fact-finding mission 
as we search for policy solutions that 
create opportunity for every American. 
Leading up to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Americans saw progress. In 2019, 
the median household income grew by 
6.8 percent, the largest increase ever 
recorded. Minority communities saw 
even greater growth: Blacks Hispanics, 
Asians, and women. 
But coming out of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, something has changed, which 
is why the work of this Select Com-
mittee is so timely. Labor force par-
ticipation, both those seeking work 
and currently employed, are lows not 
seen since the Carter administration. 
Across this country there is a grow-
ing disconnect between available jobs 
and workers ready to work. The gov-
ernment should be supporting and en-
couraging work and the dignity that 
comes with it.

prices. They feel it when they fill up 
their car’s tank. They feel it at the 
grocery store. And they are scared they 
are going to feel it when they go 
Christmas shopping for their kids in a 
few weeks. 
Inflation is a tax on every American, 
but it is devastating to low-income 
Americans. 
Chairman HIMES, I look forward to 
working with you to explore what we 
can do to empower workers to prosper 
and to expand opportunities for all 
families to succeed. 
b 2110 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member. We will be engag-
ing in a colloquy, just so all the Mem-
bers know. We will be having an infor-
mal chat without having recognition 
from the Chair. 
I know that we are both anxious to 
get to our members and their affirma-
tive but early ideas on what we might 
do here, but the ranking member and I 
were in Lorain, Ohio, last week, cour-
tesy of the gentlewoman from Ohio, 
who we will hear from later. I think we 
were both struck by a couple of things. 
I came away from that visit im-
pressed by the optimism of people in a 
town that had suffered badly, associ-
ated with the closing of a steel mill. I 
came away remarkably impressed by 
the potential role for education. One of 
the best things I heard there was the 
amazing work that the community col-
lege of Lorain was doing, training peo-
ple who had both lost jobs but also 
training young people. 
I personally hope—and I know there 
is a conversation to be had about this— 
that training and education won’t start 
at the community college level but will 
start as early as possible. I would hope 
that maybe education and training 
might be one of those areas in which 
we might find bipartisan agreement. 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I think 
there is great opportunity as it relates 
to education and, in particular, work-
force development. I think not lost on 
many of us, as we look out at the dis-
connect between workers and jobs 
available, there are over 10 million jobs 
available across America, yet we con-
tinue to have a disconnect between get-
ting workers who are looking for work 
and the jobs that are available. 
We saw in Lorain, like we see in 
southeast Wisconsin, signs looking for 
workers. As we walked into the hear-
ing, I remarked that there were ‘‘Help 
Wanted’’ signs across the street, yet 
there were many people who were still 
unemployed. 
Hopefully, we can look at the work-
force development aspects of education 
in the United States to make sure that 
we are connecting workers with the 
jobs that are available. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, that is 
right, I say to my friend from Wis-
consin. I was startled by that sign as 
well. Here we are in a depressed, if op-
timistic, town, with a big, closed steel 
mill with ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs on the 
outside of that steel mill. 
Now, there are probably lots of rea-
sons for the current disconnect. Na-
tionally, I think it is in the millions of 
jobs that are going begging, even as 
some people are having a hard time 
getting those good-paying jobs. But I 
was really impressed by the fact that 
you had in a town where there were 
certainly surplus workers a steel plant 
looking for more employees. 
Mr. STEIL. Absolutely. We see this 
time and again in southeast Wisconsin. 
We see businesses that are shrinking 
hours to try to deal with and navigate 
through this challenging work environ-
ment. 
I know we will be having a hearing 
coming up on automation, and I don’t 
think it can be lost on us that many 
businesses are looking and the struggle 
to get workers back to work and the 
impact that may have on automation 
and future job growth in the United 
States. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member and look forward 
to working with him and his members. 
I know both of us feel strongly about 
making sure that the members of the 
committee have an opportunity to 
offer up their ideas, so I will begin. 
Again, the Chair won’t be yielding. I 
will just give a wave when I think 
maybe time is running low. 
Let me begin by inviting the gentle-
woman from California, who really has 
already made a dramatic contribution 
to the committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JA-
COBS). 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chair HIMES for orga-
nizing this Special Order, and I say 
thank you to the ranking member. 
I welcome our Republican colleagues 
to the committee. I know we are going 
to have some strong debates on this 
committee, and we should because eco-
nomic inequality is the central issue of 
our time. It deserves all the energy and 
attention we can give it because we are 
at a pivotal moment. 
Right now, the bottom 50 percent of 
the population holds 2 percent of the 
wealth in the United States. The top 1 
percent holds nearly a third of all 
wealth. 
I have some experience with that. 
The most consequential day of my life, 
the day that would determine whether 
or not I grew up with opportunity and 
privilege, was the day that I was born. 
That is true for so many kids in Amer-
ica. But unlike the majority of kids 
who were born in 1989, I was lucky. 
While some were born into genera-
tional poverty, I was born into a family 
of wealth. That is what I did to earn 
my wealth and my opportunity in life— 
I was born. 
For decades, our policies have bene-
fited people like me, and that has to 
change because, in addition to being 
immoral, 
economic 
inequality 
rep-
resents a long-term threat to our inter-
national competitiveness, our national 
security, and the health of our democ-
racy. 
I know my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, some of whom served 
with me on Armed Services, are think-
ing deeply about how we remain com-
petitive in the international landscape. 
But with 140 million Americans who 
live in households that are low income, 
low wealth, are one crisis away from 
economic ruin, that is more difficult. 
I represent San Diego in Congress. 
We are one of the wealthiest counties 
in the country. We have Fortune 500 
companies. We have mansions on the 
beach. Yet, more than 40 percent of our 
kids were living in families experi-
encing poverty before the pandemic. 
We have to do better. 
That is why I am so grateful to be on 
this committee and that we are taking 
the time to debate and negotiate the 
Build Back Better Act, a bill that 
would make historic investments to re-
balance our system, especially for chil-
dren. 
I know our disagreements are real, 
but I have faith that, together, we can 
work to find solutions like the earned 
income tax credit, the child tax credit, 
Head Start, all of these programs that, 
when they were passed, had wide bipar-
tisan support. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank Chair 
HIMES and our Republican colleagues. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from California. I 
take real pleasure in welcoming the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma to the 
committee and invite her to make any 
remarks she would like to make. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. It is an honor to be selected 
for the committee, and I look forward 
to working with all the members, in-
cluding Ranking Member STEIL, on this 
very important issue. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to be 
selected to serve on the Select Com-
mittee on Economic Disparity, and I 
look forward to working with all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
dive deep into the issues at hand and to 
try to find areas where we can work to-
gether to craft bipartisan solutions. 
In contrast to my friend and col-
league from California, I was born the 
daughter of an immigrant. My father 
came to the United States with no 
money in pursuit of the American 
Dream. He went to college, graduated, 
started his own business, and, today, is 
a very successful businessman. 
I look forward to discussing in this 
committee the ways that we can foster 
the American Dream with American 
citizens across this country. The mis-
sion of the select committee is cer-
tainly worthy of consideration. The 
question of why some of our fellow 
Americans are being left behind in the 
economy demands our time and atten-
tion. 
One of the most worrying economic 
statistics of the past year and a half is

October 25, 2021 
that the U.S. labor force participation 
rate is the lowest it has been since 1977, 
nearly 45 years ago. Millions of fewer 
Americans are employed or actively 
seeking work compared to just 2 years 
ago, and that has created a wide-rang-
ing challenge for American families 
and for our economy. 
‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs, as was men-
tioned earlier, have become ubiquitous 
across 
the 
Nation 
as 
stores, 
res-
taurants, manufacturers, and others 
struggle to find employees to continue 
operations. It is vital that we find the 
root causes and craft the appropriate 
solutions. 
To that end, here are a few areas I 
think the select committee should 
focus its time and its energy on. 
First, we should begin to review and 
unwind Federal policies that have 
disincentivized participation in the 
labor force, many of which were cre-
ated at the end of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Second, 
we 
should 
refocus 
and 
strengthen our Nation’s education and 
workforce development programs. It is 
clear that our Nation’s education sys-
tem leaves many Americans behind, 
saddles students with large amounts of 
debt, and often promotes pricey degree 
programs with very poor job prospects. 
I believe we need to do a better job of 
matching workforce development pro-
grams to the actual needs of employ-
ers. Aligning job training curriculum 
to meet the demands of employers who 
need skilled workers would almost 
guarantee jobs for those who complete 
a program. 
Third, we need to reform our Na-
tion’s criminal justice system and rein-
vigorate efforts to rehabilitate the 
nearly 95 percent of prisoners who will 
eventually be released from prison. 
Sadly, all too often, we hear of individ-
uals released with just the clothes on 
their back and a one-way bus ticket. 
This level of support doesn’t set up in-
dividuals for success. 
I am proud, earlier this year, the 
State of Oklahoma stood up a program 
to begin preparing inmates 9 months 
before their release with workforce 
training and assistance to obtain docu-
mentation needed to get a job, trans-
portation, and housing. Improving pro-
grams to transition the formerly incar-
cerated back to society is worth our 
consideration and can save taxpayers 
in the long run. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn’t 
note the importance of regulatory re-
lief and tax reform as key components 
to all of this. As someone who worked 
in the private sector for many years, 
including running my own firm and 
working for a family company, I can 
say with certainty that tax policy and 
government regulation have tremen-
dous impacts on the decisions of busi-
nesses to hire, expand, and make in-
vestments. 
In closing, I would again like to ex-
press my appreciation for being on the 
committee and look forward to work-
ing with my colleagues to dig deeper. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
HIMES and Ranking Member STEIL for 
organizing this Special Order this 
evening. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG). 
b 2120 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I am so 
incredibly honored to be appointed to 
the Select Committee studying eco-
nomic 
disparities 
and 
fairness 
in 
growth. I welcome my Republican col-
leagues. 
I am especially grateful to be taking 
a fresh look at how we build economic 
growth in our rural communities. The 
challenges facing rural America, while 
longstanding, have been made even 
more urgent as a result of the COVID– 
19 public health crisis. In Congress, it 
is our responsibility and our moral 
duty to respond to the unique needs of 
our rural communities. 
Right now, in small towns across my 
district a lack of reliable internet ac-
cess is preventing entrepreneurs from 
growing their small businesses. Higher 
insurance premiums and out-of-pocket 
healthcare costs are putting a strain 
on families’ bottom lines. Access to 
healthcare sometimes means driving 
an hour to the nearest hospital. We 
must enter this work with an open 
mind to examine the issues, and we 
must build a roadmap that ensures our 
rural communities are not left behind. 
To be sure, the Build Back Better 
Act has many provisions designed to 
address growth in rural America, most 
notably, the President’s Rural Partner-
ship Program, which would empower 
local communities to shore up unreli-
able electric grids, childcare, and sup-
port small businesses that power local 
communities. 
These 
long 
overdue 
investments 
won’t reverse all of the economic de-
cline we have seen in our rural commu-
nities, but it is a start to put into place 
an economic foundation that paves the 
way 
for 
consistent, 
longstanding 
growth that has eluded our rural com-
munities for decades. 
I came to Congress to deliver these 
solutions for my constituents, and now 
we have an opportunity to step back 
and examine these issues with fresh 
eyes. We cannot let this opportunity 
pass us by. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for all of his work, and I appre-
ciate the opportunity to be on this Se-
lect Committee. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota. 
Madam Speaker, I am just going to 
note to the ranking member, I have 
four members, a good, enthusiastic 
turnout, so we are going to need to be 
a little disciplined with time, about 
roughly 2 minutes each. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman and the ranking 
member, the Speaker, and the minority 
leader. It is nice to have this com-
mittee to focus on such an important 
topic and to do it in a bipartisan way. 
I am sure we will have our differences 
of opinion, but I hope we find some 
common ground. 
Frankly, one of the bills I have 
worked on for a long time is the People 
CARE Act. It would create a bipartisan 
commission for Republicans, for Demo-
crats, and it would reform all 90-plus 
means-tested 
programs. 
We 
spend 
about a trillion dollars a year, and for 
reference, we spend about $750 billion 
on defense, so far more just on poverty 
assistance. Many of those programs 
aren’t as effective as they could be. 
It wouldn’t cut any funding. It 
wouldn’t even necessarily cut any pro-
grams, but the commission could rede-
sign them to do things like end benefit 
cliffs. That is really important, be-
cause as people start to recover and as 
they start to get back into the econ-
omy and participate in the workforce— 
when they get a raise, when they get a 
promotion, sometimes when they get a 
job—they get put on a cold turkey pro-
gram, they lose their benefits and it 
creates a lot of fear, and frankly, turns 
a safety net into a snare. 
One of the things right now that is 
driving the challenges for the safety 
net is wages are going up. Now, that 
doesn’t mean inflation is a good thing, 
by any means. Inflation is really hit-
ting wage-earners really hard and re-
tirees even harder, but it is changing 
how far a housing voucher will go, for 
example, or whether somebody gets a 
raise. They might not have updated the 
benefit program from the Federal safe-
ty net to recognize that and now they 
are facing a cliff. 
We need to address the drivers of this 
inflation, and that goes to the destruc-
tion of the value of our money. The 
massive spending that we do, often in 
the name of compassion, is growing the 
wealth gap, this is fiscal and monetary 
policy. When we have big deficits, it 
grows inequality in the name of help-
ing people. 
There are so many more issues that I 
hope we get to, but it is an honor to 
serve with my colleagues and I look 
forward to hearing their ideas and 
growing from the experience. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for his gen-
erous comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE 
of Wisconsin), another one of our stal-
wart midwesterners, who was with us 
in Lorain, Ohio. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman and the 
ranking member. I am so delighted to 
have been appointed to the Select Com-
mittee. 
The Speaker, of course, said that we 
should make proposals that make our 
economy grow for everyone, empow-
ering American economic growth while 
ensuring that no one is left behind in 
the 21st century economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5867 
October 25, 2021 
It is no secret that our country is 
marred by unequal access to good pay-
ing jobs, healthcare, housing, high 
quality education, childcare, and many 
other things. I can’t dwell on all those 
things in this short period of time. 
These disparities impact the ability of 
many communities to escape poverty, 
and especially people of color. 
I do want to dwell on a couple of 
things, proposals that I think are ex-
tremely important to close the eco-
nomic gap, the wealth gap, and the 
housing gap. 
First of all, I think that all of our 
workers deserve paid family leave, a 
universal comprehensive paid family 
and medical leave program. Only about 
a third of Americans in the highest 
quintile in the country receive any 
kind of paid family leave, while 92 per-
cent of workers in the lower quintile 
have no paid family leave. 
I think that we should enhance the 
child tax credit and the earned income 
tax credits. These are things that, 
while there is a very high cost of pov-
erty, there is a big, huge outcome and 
harvest from investing in our children. 
People around the globe have noted 
that it really creates better workers, 
better educational outcomes, and bet-
ter healthcare outcomes. 
We also need to address the uncom-
pensated care that so many family 
caregivers, especially women, are pro-
viding, about a half-trillion dollars a 
year in uncompensated care, and we 
need to address that. So I think if we 
boost the CTC, the earned income tax 
credit, provide paid family leave, we 
will begin to see the beginnings around 
the edges of reducing some of the dis-
parities. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK) 
for 
her 
remarks 
this 
evening. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman HIMES and Ranking 
Member STEIL. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as a 
member of the Select Committee on 
Economic Disparity and Fairness in 
and Growth, aka, the Committee on 
the Economy. 
Over the past few minutes, we have 
heard a variety of arguments, and 
there is absolutely no doubt that every 
Member here today has a vested inter-
est in ensuring our Nation remains 
prosperous for generations to come. 
While we may disagree on solutions, 
we will work together to address eco-
nomic challenges that we see across 
this country. Economic prosperity for 
all Americans is imperative and we 
know that prior to COVID–19, Ameri-
cans saw tremendous progress. 
In 2019 alone, the median household 
income grew 6.8 percent, the largest in-
crease ever recorded in American his-
tory. With historic legislation passed 
by the House of Representatives and 
the Trump administration, we saw mi-
nority and historically underserved 
communities grow at historic rates, 
with income levels rising 7 percent for 
Hispanics and African Americans. 
Following the pandemic, however, we 
have seen labor force participation 
plummet, as the policies proposed by 
our colleagues across the aisle have 
incentivized unemployment that we 
have not seen since the Carter adminis-
tration which, for the record, was more 
than a decade before my time. 
Now, as we begin to prepare to ex-
plore what we can do to empower work-
ers for the jobs of the future and en-
courage all American families to suc-
ceed nationwide, I am particularly fo-
cused on communities like mine in 
north Central Florida, which lack 
broadband in both rural and urban 
areas, suffering from a lack of invest-
ment, which in turn affects our school-
children, 
telehealth 
opportunities, 
commerce, and so much more. 
Now, in an agriculture-heavy district 
like mine, I also want to highlight the 
high trade deficit, the need for im-
proved trade agreements, which help 
Florida producers in my home State 
who have consistently been devastated 
by lower prices from Mexico. 
During the pandemic, farmers had to 
destroy crops and dump milk because 
the demand was so low, while cheaper 
produce from other nations continued 
to be imported cutting out the market 
from our producers. Simply put, the ec-
onomics of U.S. production in agri-
culture are in peril. 
Finally, I would like to bring atten-
tion to issues that are hot in the head-
lines these days: educational freedom, 
school choice, and the rights of parents 
to have a say in their children’s edu-
cation. We all know education is a di-
rect correlation to prosperity. We 
know that America was built on equal 
opportunity, not equal outcome. 
Rather than asking what more gov-
ernment should do, we should ask 
where government can be removed and 
should be removed. Federal regulations 
cost $1.9 trillion, spent on reporting, 
compliance, and more, which could be 
better served in investing in employees 
or in workforce development or in un-
derdeveloped communities across the 
country. 
b 2130 
As we begin our work on this select 
committee, I am committed to work-
ing with my colleagues to pursue 
meaningful opportunities for all Amer-
icans, regardless of their location, re-
gardless of their background, regard-
less of their education, and regardless 
of whatever box they check. 
It is well past time that we stop see-
ing the government as the solution to 
our problems because, after all, it is 
the incredible opportunities here today 
in America that have allowed me, the 
daughter of a single mom, a young 
woman from rural America, who has 
gone from homeless to the House of 
Representatives in under a decade. It is 
time that we expand those opportuni-
ties—not restrict them. 
I thank Chairman HIMES, again, as 
well as Ranking Member STEIL
for 
their leadership. I am honored to serve 
on this select committee. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Florida. We 
may not totally agree on the role of 
government, but I am grateful to her 
for really highlighting the importance 
of education which has been the theme 
that we have heard a lot here tonight. 
Batting cleanup, our last Member to 
hear from is our hostess from Lorain, 
Ohio. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, Chair HIMES, for 
yielding, and I thank him for bringing 
the committee to Lorain, Ohio. 
Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to 
offer my strong support for pending 
new investments in our workers, our 
families, and our communities. 
As was highlighted during the hear-
ing in Lorain, our region has been bat-
tered by an economy that rewards the 
1 percent and billionaire investors at 
the expense of workers of the middle 
class. Thankfully, right now in north-
ern Ohio we are seeing the possibility 
of restoring new hope and new oppor-
tunity not just for billionaires but for 
workers. The parents and grandparents 
of nearly 150,000 children from working 
families and struggling households in 
our district are seeing their taxes cut 
through the child tax credit. 
Unlike the trillion-dollar giveaway 
aimed 
at 
the 
wealthiest 
and 
transnational 
corporations 
that 
outsource jobs to penny-wage nations, 
our hardworking families are seeing 
their tax dollars returned directly to 
them. 
Looking at how working mothers 
struggle, a recent study from the 
United Way of Greater Toledo shows 
that more than one-third workers are 
not eligible for paid maternity leave. 
In the richest nation on Earth, our 
workers should have access to paid 
family leave that is available else-
where on the globe. This is what we are 
working to deliver. 
Further, significant new investments 
in physical infrastructure will create 
living wage jobs and help level the 
playing field as America creates new 
wealth beginning right where we live 
by rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, 
and investing in renewable energies 
like hydrogen and electric vehicles to 
spur a real revival of our industrial 
heartland. 
It is time to deal in workers and 
their families by rewarding hard work, 
not just capital. It is time to deliver 
for the families in Toledo, Sandusky, 
Lorain, and Cleveland. Investments in 
our workers, families, and commu-
nities will help restore faith that hard 
work matters. It will rebuild the mid-
dle class and provide a path to fully re-
alize the American Dream. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

October 25, 2021 
PROTECTING OUR VETERANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLER) until 10 p.m. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that each Member 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, my 
distinguished colleagues and I stand 
here on behalf of America’s veterans. 
The last thing our veterans should be 
burdened with is any delay, let alone a 
prolonged wait time to access the bene-
fits and programs they have earned 
through their service. 
The National Personnel Records Cen-
ter is responsible for processing these 
records, and at this moment, there is a 
backlog of more than half a million re-
quests, some dating back to February 
of 2020. Consequently, some veterans 
have been waiting for over a year and 
a half for copies of their service records 
which are needed to access VA benefits, 
adjudicate disability claims, request 
campaign service medals, and much 
more. 
We in the United States of America 
honor the service and sacrifice of our 
veterans and Active Duty military per-
sonnel, and any delay for them is unac-
ceptable. 
That is why we introduced the 
RECORDS Act, legislation that would 
compel the National Personnel Records 
Center to take the necessary actions to 
eliminate the growing backlog of vet-
erans’ record requests. 
Dating back more than a year, there 
has been a broad, bipartisan push to de-
liver for our veterans and work toward 
addressing 
the 
National 
Personnel 
Records Center’s unacceptable backlog. 
The RECORDS Act is an opportunity 
to achieve this. 
Our veterans fought for us. We must 
always fight for them. I appreciate my 
colleagues joining me this evening to-
gether in support of this goal. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank my good friend from Pennsyl-
vania for this opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk 
about one of the fundamental roles for 
a Member of Congress, and that is to 
help our constituents navigate the Fed-
eral bureaucracy and get the docu-
ments or benefits that they need and 
they deserve. This is especially true for 
veterans, who often run into difficulty 
at the VA, even when it is not the VA’s 
fault. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
National 
Per-
sonnel Records Center is still today not 
fully open, and this is after we gave 
them money in last year’s appropria-
tions bill to safely reopen during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This has pre-
vented caseworkers in my office from 
properly assisting my constituents in a 
timely manner. 
In fact, there is a backlog that was 
just mentioned of over 500,000 requests 
from veterans and their families—over 
500,000. To fix this problem, I am proud 
to support the RECORDS Act, and I 
urge the Speaker to bring to this bill 
to the floor. 
This bill will ensure that the Na-
tional Personnel Records Center is op-
erating full time and at fully-staffed 
capacity now. American veterans de-
serve better than what they are cur-
rently getting from this administra-
tion. Let’s pass the RECORDS Act. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for joining us this 
evening and so very well put about 
making sure that we help our veterans 
and the fact that the records center 
had the resources in previous legisla-
tion. We just need to make sure that 
they get the job done. I thank the gen-
tleman for joining us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. I rise today, Madam 
Speaker, to speak in support of the 
RECORDS Act to make urgently need-
ed reforms to the National Personnel 
Records Center which has failed our 
Nation’s veterans through a critical 
time. 
I would like to share a recent story 
from my district about a 99-year-old 
marine who has been suffering from 
Alzheimer’s. Her family has been at-
tempting to obtain her DD–214 form to 
apply for her VA pension. This would 
grant her a placement in a nursing 
home equipped to handle an Alz-
heimer’s patient. However, the Na-
tional Personnel Records Center has 
put an indefinite delay on sending her 
records to her and her loved ones. 
Their justification in writing: this re-
quest does not constitute a medical 
emergency. She is 99 years old. She 
dedicated her life to serving our coun-
try as a marine and is suffering from a 
debilitating disease. As if this excuse 
was not poor enough, the center also 
demanded that the family prove that 
she has been separated for 60 years or 
more to justify pulling the records. 
Again, this is a 99-year-old marine vet-
eran. 
The National Personnel Records Cen-
ter can no longer be allowed to lean on 
the crutches of COVID. This is their ex-
cuse to justify their dereliction of 
duty. They have an obligation to fulfill 
these claims for our Nation’s veterans 
who have served our country bravely. 
If the National Personnel Records Cen-
ter does their job and still feels no 
shame in letting veterans’ care lapse 
while their needed records requests go 
unfulfilled to the tune of 500,000-plus 
nationally, hundreds within Florida’s 
Third Congressional District—constitu-
ents of mine—then it is time for us in 
Congress to intervene. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the House to 
immediately take up this legislation. 
Excuses be dammed. 
b 2140 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for those re-
marks. What an outstanding lady that 
the gentlewoman represents. 
The gentlewoman mentioned some-
thing that really makes me think of 
something when you talk about ex-
cuses. I was raised by my grandmother, 
and I can remember her telling me one 
time, my brother and I, she looked at 
us and said: Boys, people that make ex-
cuses are weak. 
It is time that we show strength, and 
we make them do their job. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), my 
good colleague and friend. 
Mr. CLYDE. I thank the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), my 
good friend and colleague, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, veterans and their 
families have made many sacrifices for 
our great Nation. Through their serv-
ice, these men and women have earned 
numerous benefits, and those benefits 
are validated by the member’s indi-
vidual service record. 
The repository for those records is 
the National Personnel Records Center. 
The center is behind in its work. With 
the pandemic, the backlog to obtain 
military records jumped from 56,000 to 
over 500,000 requests. That is a tenfold 
increase. 
That is 500,000 veterans and their 
families who are waiting on docu-
mentation that they need to apply for 
and receive benefits that they earned, 
including the GI Bill education bene-
fits, VA loans, medical benefits, dis-
ability compensation, life insurance, 
and even burial benefits for their fami-
lies. 
When these issues were first reported 
last 
year, 
the 
National 
Personnel 
Records Center stated that the pan-
demic prevented their employees from 
being able to process record requests in 
a safe environment. As such, Congress 
appropriated additional funds to ad-
dress the center’s concerns and to help 
expedite the digitization of records. 
However, the center did not grant its 
employees the proper technology to 
work from home during the pandemic 
until early 2021, nearly a year after the 
pandemic began. This choice by the 
center only compounded the worsening 
backlog. 
Also, the Archivist of the United 
States, who oversees the NPRC’s oper-
ations, noted in his latest correspond-
ence to Congress that he expects the 
center to eliminate the backlog of vet-
eran requests by the end of fiscal year 
2022. That means this time next year, a 
whole year. This is simply unaccept-
able. 
Each Member of this body has at 
least one veteran in their district im-
pacted by this backlog, probably many, 
many veterans. It is time for all of us

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5869 
October 25, 2021 
to step up to the plate to demand re-
sults. Show us that these record re-
quests are being processed in a timely 
manner. 
I commend Representative KELLER 
for spearheading this tonight to fix 
this issue. Part of that is through the 
introduction of his bill, the RECORDS 
Act. I appreciate his efforts very much, 
and I am proud to join him in this 
fight. I thank him for the invitation to 
participate. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative CLYDE for his re-
marks and recognizing that there are 
veterans across our Nation in every 
district we have the privilege to rep-
resent. 
The 
gentleman 
mentioned 
the 
records center not wanting to—worried 
about danger. Well, our veterans didn’t 
worry about danger when they went to 
protect our freedom and our way of 
life. 
I am glad to be joined by my great 
friend and colleague from Pennsyl-
vania, Representative KELLY. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, Representative KELLER and I 
indeed are very good friends and in 
complete agreement on what it is we 
are trying to do tonight. 
Madam Speaker, there are 54,511 vet-
erans in Pennsylvania’s 16th Congres-
sional District. These are men and 
women that have served in all types of 
activities in the military. 
Nearly 1 in 13 of my constituents are 
military 
veterans. 
Roughly 
520,000 
pending VA claims for disability, com-
pensation, and benefits are out there 
right now. And 191,000 of those that are 
considered to be backlogged are older 
than 3 months old, 4 months old, and 
they can’t even get the information 
that they need. 
Thirty-six percent of these cases this 
summer were considered backlogged. 
Again, over 4 months, these people are 
waiting for their records to be pulled. 
The National Personnel Records Cen-
ter is operating at 45 percent of its pre- 
pandemic capacity—45 percent—while 
almost every other business and gov-
ernment entity is operating at full ca-
pacity. 
This delay prevents veterans from 
getting the benefits they deserve for 
months or even years. A lack of digital 
records prevents staff from accessing 
those records while working remotely 
during the pandemic. 
Representative KELLER’s bill would 
require the National Personnel Records 
Center employees to return to the job 
at 100 percent of capacity and improve 
the efficiency and responsiveness of the 
operations at the center. 
This is not just a request. This is 
honoring the service of those who have 
given all to defend this country. 
They are not looking for anything 
special. They are not looking for any-
thing out of the ordinary. They are not 
looking for anybody to go beyond what 
they were hired to do. All they are ask-
ing for is for their records to be proc-
essed in the right time so they can re-
ceive their benefits. 
How can this Nation turn its back, 
and how can this group refuse to do 
this in a timely fashion and prevent 
this from happening further? 
All we are asking for is people to do 
their jobs. What an unusual concept for 
somebody to go to work every day and 
be asked to do their job, not doing it 
from home, but going on the job and 
actually doing the job for those who 
put their lives on the line for this Na-
tion. 
Incredible that it would take a bill 
from Congress for people to actually do 
the job they were hired to do and fulfill 
their responsibility to our incredible 
veterans. 
I thank Representative KELLER for 
bringing this forward, and I would urge 
this body to take a look at what we are 
doing right now and somehow come to 
an agreement that there is not—this 
shouldn’t be a request. This is a re-
sponsibility to those who have served 
us so well. 
I thank Representative KELLER for 
including me tonight and all the rest of 
my colleagues. 
Again, this is not just a request. This 
is a responsibility. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for making a very 
valid point, that the rest of America is 
going back to work and doing what 
they need to do at full capacity, work-
ing at 100 percent. To have a govern-
ment agency working at 45 percent, as 
the gentleman pointed out, for those 
who have done so much for us is unac-
ceptable. I appreciate his help with 
this. 
I also look forward to hearing what 
my great colleague and friend from 
Wisconsin has to say. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would also like to speak on behalf of 
Congressman KELLER’s bill. 
One of the things we do as Congress-
men back in our district is constituent 
work. Probably one of the areas which 
we are busiest is in the areas of helping 
our veterans. Whether it is getting bur-
ial benefits, veteran benefits, or lost 
military awards, we have to contact 
the National Personnel Records Center. 
Unfortunately, as has been men-
tioned, for over a year now, the Na-
tional Personnel Records Center has 
been operating at well under capacity. 
This is an insult to our veterans. 
Their excuse for not operating is, of 
course, the COVID. My staff has toured 
the National Personnel Records Center, 
and it is a large warehouse, very spread 
out. Unlike where most Americans 
have had to work the last 2 years, you 
are not squeezed up in a cubicle next to 
somebody else. 
Unfortunately—and this maybe is an 
indication of the overall caring of the 
Federal Government. Unfortunately, 
they have not been open at a time 
when not only our veterans have given 
so much, but a time when so many tax-
payers have been working around the 
clock. 
Every night I go home, I go by a cou-
ple of cheese factories. I can drive by 
there at 1 in the morning. They are 
packed 
with 
people. 
They 
never 
stopped working. 
Here we have a massive warehouse 
with lots of space between people, and 
we are told it is too dangerous to go to 
work. That is preposterous. It is an in-
sult to our veterans. It is an insult to 
our taxpayers. 
I urge this body to pass Congressman 
KELLER’s bill as soon as possible. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments, 
so very well put, that we have people 
for which we work that are veterans 
that go to work every day, that maybe 
aren’t veterans but taxpayers that go 
to work every day and expect our gov-
ernment to work. That is all we are 
asking for. 
People every day in America go to 
work, and they produce goods, they 
provide services. The Americans that 
have served, our veterans, and those 
that are serving deserve a government 
that is responsive to the needs that 
they have because of what they have 
earned. 
They are not asking for anything 
special. They are saying: Look, we 
have earned these benefits, and to gain 
access to them, we need you to do your 
job. 
Who would have thought it would 
have taken an act of Congress to try 
and get them to do their work. It is 
time that we make sure that the Na-
tional Personnel Records Center does 
its job for our veterans and to make 
sure that they have a plan that this 
never happens again. 
We cannot let down our veterans be-
cause of some bureaucracy, because 
somebody doesn’t want to make sure 
that it runs efficiently and effectively. 
b 2150 
It needs to be done. It needs to be 
done now. 
Madam Speaker, just let me say, we 
must first and always remember our 
veterans and Active Duty military per-
sonnel. 
Also, I would like to thank my col-
leagues for their participation this 
evening. This is an important issue. It 
is widespread, and it transcends party 
lines. 
These are veterans. They are Ameri-
cans. They are not Republicans; they 
are not Democrats. They are Ameri-
cans, and they are an outstanding 
group of Americans. 
I notice I was just joined here by a 
colleague of mine. So before I close, I 
will recognize a gentleman I have 
known for quite some time, actually a 
member of the military. When I knew 
him, he was still a member of the mili-
tary, so a veteran then, a good friend of 
mine, a great American from Pennsyl-
vania.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5870 
October 25, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, for bringing up the sub-
ject and offering me the opportunity to 
stand in support of his legislation, the 
RECORDS Act, to let you know, what 
you have probably heard, that literally 
hundreds 
of 
thousands—500,000 
to 
600,000 veterans are awaiting their care 
based on the inability of the VA to get 
to their records. 
They can’t prove that they are due 
the care, that they have earned the 
care, without the records. The VA has 
this backlog, which takes them a year, 
maybe two, where they can’t access 
their records to get the care that they 
have earned. So I commend the gen-
tleman 
for 
his 
efforts 
with 
the 
RECORDS Act. 
I have a similar bill, the WINGMAN 
Act, which allows congressional staff-
ers, given the appropriate approvals, to 
go in and help the veteran do the same 
thing, get through the backlog. 
Mr. KELLER has a response. He has a 
solution. I am working on a solution. 
Who is not working on a solution? The 
VA. It is not the people down in the 
trenches, down doing the hard work. As 
usual, it is the administration, the 
upper staff, that has failed in this en-
deavor. 
If we can do anything in the United 
States of America—of all the billions 
we spend, here and across the globe, 
anywhere, and all the different pro-
grams that we have—the least we can 
do is take care of those who have safe-
guarded our freedoms and have earned 
the care that they deserve to get. The 
only thing that stands between them 
and 
that 
care 
is 
accessing 
their 
records. They cannot right now be-
cause of this backlog. 
The good gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLER) has legislation that 
will fix that, and I urge my colleagues 
to support it. I urge everybody that is 
a veteran or a family member sup-
portive of a veteran to write, to con-
tact their Congressman, their Member 
of Congress, and urge them to support 
this legislation. 
Let’s see if we can fix the cir-
cumstances at the VA for these vet-
erans. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, Mr. PERRY, who 
said it so very well. These people 
earned their benefits. Our veterans 
earned these benefits. They protected 
our freedom and way of life. They 
didn’t question was it too dangerous to 
go do that job. They went and did it. 
They have earned benefits. 
What we need to do is we need to 
make sure that the bureaucrats that 
are running this—as he said, it is not 
the people that get the work done 
every day, but it is the managers of the 
National 
Personnel 
Records 
Center 
that need to make sure they do their 
job and put together a plan to address 
the issues, to get our veterans the nec-
essary records, in a timely fashion, 
that they need to gain access to the 
benefits they have earned. 
As I mentioned before, this is an 
issue that is not a Republican or Demo-
crat issue. It is an American issue, and 
it is about helping Americans. It is 
about helping Americans who have 
helped humanity from around the 
globe, stood up for freedom, stood on 
that wall and made sure we were safe. 
Now, it is our time to stand up for 
them and make sure they get the bene-
fits they have earned. 
We all urge the National Archives 
and Records Administration to imme-
diately take all steps to address this 
problem and prevent it from ever hap-
pening again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

S7323 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2021 
No. 187 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Everlasting Father, enable us to love 
You with all our hearts, souls, minds, 
and strength. Give us humility so we 
can see Your divine image in the people 
around us and serve You by serving 
them. Let this love expressed in service 
transform our Senators, Nation, and 
world. 
Lord, guide our lawmakers. Make 
them kind in thought, gentle in speech, 
and generous in actions. Help them to 
avoid the arena of combative words and 
seek a caring community of integrity, 
respect, and civility. 
Lord, teach them that it is better to 
give than to receive, as You lead them 
to a humility that seeks great things 
for others. 
We pray in Your precious Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate begins this week with votes 
to confirm two more highly qualified 
Biden nominees—one to serve in his ad-
ministration and another to serve on 
the Federal bench. 
First, we will vote to confirm Mr. 
Douglas Parker to serve as an Assist-
ant Secretary of Labor for OSHA. A 
veteran of the Labor Department from 
the Obama administration, Mr. Parker 
will be the first Senate-confirmed 
OSHA head since the Obama Presi-
dency. 
He has a proven track record of pro-
tecting everyday Americans in the 
workplace—more important now than 
ever before—and I look forward to his 
confirmation later today. 
The fact that the previous adminis-
tration left OSHA empty for 4 years 
shows how little they cared about 
worker safety and protecting our work-
ers, as many of them often do difficult 
jobs. 
Second, the Senate will also proceed 
to the confirmation of a truly out-
standing 
judicial 
nominee, 
Myrna 
Perez, to serve as circuit judge for the 
Second Circuit, which includes my 
home State of New York. It is a good 
day for the Second Circuit and for the 
entire Federal judiciary. 
If confirmed, Myrna Perez would be a 
remarkable, remarkable addition to 
the bench. She would be the only His-
panic jurist to sit on the Second Cir-
cuit and the first since Justice Sonia 
Sotomayor. 
And just as I was proud to support 
Justice 
Sotomayor’s 
nomination—I 
even suggested her name for the Su-
preme Court to President Obama, a 
fact I am proud of—I am also, today, 
proud to champion Myrna’s elevation 
to the bench. 
Myrna’s life was the embodiment of 
the American dream. The daughter of 
Mexican immigrants, she grew up in 
San Antonio, TX, where her father was 
an Army veteran who worked as a con-
sultant with Bexar County, while her 
mother worked in the post office. 
As Myrna herself will tell you, grow-
ing up in a family of immigrants often 
meant breaking through linguistic, 
cultural, and racial barriers. And of all 
places, perhaps nowhere else did these 
barriers leave an important imprint on 
Myrna than when her aunt took her to 
the polls on election day. It was there 
where Myrna realized how an election 
system built from Byzantine rules shut 
out countless citizens from the polit-
ical process. This experience instilled 
in Myrna a thirst for making our de-
mocracy work for all, and that has be-
come her life’s work. 
After graduating from Yale, Harvard, 
and Columbia, Myrna eventually joined 
the Brennan Center for Justice, becom-
ing the director of its Voting Rights 
and 
Elections 
Program. 
Over 
the 
course of her career, Myrna has become 
one of the Nation’s top voting rights 
and elections lawyers, playing a key 
role in making sure Americans could 
vote safely in the 2020 election. She 
also has fought unlawful purges of vot-
ing rolls, spoken out against long wait 
times at polling locations in diverse 
neighborhoods, and has played major 
roles preparing six amicus briefs before 
the Supreme Court, including one for 
the Shelby case in 2013. 
But Myrna’s qualifications are not 
limited to her experience as a voting 
rights litigator. She is also a brilliant 
attorney with experience in fair hous-
ing law, disability rights, and employ-
ment discrimination. In the words of 
one former colleague, her skills as a 
lawyer are simply ‘‘off the charts.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7324 
October 25, 2021 
The cupboards of the Federal judici-
ary have long been filled with attor-
neys who have taken the traditional 
route on their way to the bench—a big 
law firm, corporate experience, pros-
ecutorial experience. Many of those ju-
rists have done commendably on the 
bench, and I have been proud to sup-
port many of them over the years. But 
Myrna Perez represents something dif-
ferent, 
something 
wonderfully 
dif-
ferent: a sorely needed boost in both 
the personal and professional diversity 
of the Federal bench. 
Especially now, we need more elec-
tion lawyers in black robes. We need 
more Federal defenders in black robes. 
We need more immigrants and civil 
rights lawyers and diverse candidates 
assuming positions on the bench. We 
need, in other words, for our courts to 
reflect the rich mosaic that is the 
American people. With Myrna Perez’s 
nomination, I am glad we are taking a 
step closer to that goal, and I hope she 
is confirmed later today. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, in addition to Myrna Perez’s nom-
ination, I have also filed cloture on five 
additional judicial nominations, which 
we will begin working on tomorrow. It 
is my hope that we can work to process 
these nominees through the Chamber 
quickly. They are all outstanding indi-
viduals with proven records of fidelity 
to the rule of law. 
As we keep making progress on many 
pressing issues to help the American 
people, Senate Democrats will also 
continue working swiftly to fill judi-
cial vacancies with qualified, main-
stream jurists who, again, add to the 
bench’s diversity, both demographic 
and occupational. All year long, that is 
precisely what we have done. 
This year, the Senate has already 
confirmed the first Native American 
and Muslim Americans to the Federal 
bench, as well as multiple civil rights 
attorneys, 
public 
defenders, 
voting 
rights experts, and more. This is how 
we work to strengthen not only diver-
sity in our judiciary but the public’s 
trust that it truly represents all Amer-
icans. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now on Build Back 
Better, we had a productive weekend as 
we continue to close in on a final 
agreement for President Biden’s Build 
Back Better plan. 
Yesterday morning, I traveled to 
Delaware to meet with the President 
and Senator MANCHIN about our agen-
da. It was a very good meeting. I thank 
the President for his leadership, and I 
also thank my colleagues in both 
Chambers for their shared commitment 
to getting this consequential and des-
perately needed legislation across the 
finish line. 
No one ever said passing trans-
formational legislation like this would 
be easy, but we are on track to get this 
done because it is so important and it 
is what the American people need and 
what they want. The progress of last 
week illustrated that if we stick to-
gether and work toward finding that 
legislative sweet spot, then we can get 
big things done for the American peo-
ple. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the biggest tax hikes in 50 years; the 
biggest peacetime tax hikes ever re-
corded in American history—that is 
what Washington Democrats are cook-
ing up. Our Democratic colleagues and 
President Biden are behind closed 
doors, dreaming up creative new ways 
to grab literally historic amounts of 
the American people’s money. 
Remember, the same socialist spend-
ing plans that Democrats claim cost 
zero dollars somehow also need stag-
gering new tax hikes to pay for them. 
So, even with significant inflation, 
runaway gas prices, and runaway en-
ergy costs already hitting American 
families in their pocketbooks, Wash-
ington Democrats have spent months 
dreaming up new cash grabs for the 
IRS. 
Democrats have talked about mas-
sively hiking business taxes, to a level 
that would leave industries paying 
more than their competitors in com-
munist China. They have talked about 
jacking up marginal income tax rates 
in ways that would hammer small busi-
nesses and family businesses that file 
as passthroughs. They have talked 
about adding a second death tax to give 
the IRS an even bigger bite out of fam-
ily farms. They have even promised 
something that our country has never 
seen before: a new IRS surveillance 
dragnet where the IRS would get to 
track ordinary citizens’ inflows and 
outflows. Banks and credit unions 
would be forced to hand over Ameri-
cans’ private information to the IRS. 
The Democrats are so desperate to 
shake down the American people for 
money that they are proposing to es-
sentially treat everybody—everybody— 
like they are under audit. 
For months now, our Democratic col-
leagues have been toying with one 
staggering tax increase after another. 
We have seen one disappointing jobs re-
port after another, one historic infla-
tion report after another, but Demo-
crats are still convinced that the big-
gest peacetime tax hikes on record in 
American history are just what the 
doctor ordered. 
As one news report explained, ‘‘the 
scramble has opened the door to poten-
tial tax proposals [that] progressives 
could only have dreamed of’’—just 
dreamed of—‘‘just a few months ago.’’ 
The far left is officially calling the 
shots, and that is where the latest new 
craziness comes into the picture. If 
public reporting has it right, the 
Democrats are so desperate to raise 
taxes that they are now proposing to 
tax 
money 
the 
American 
people 
haven’t even made yet. Let me say 
that again. They are now proposing to 
tax 
money 
the 
American 
people 
haven’t even made yet. Yes, you heard 
me right. So much for the quaint idea 
that you had to actually make money 
first before the IRS could tax it. Now 
Democrats want to tax money you 
haven’t made yet. 
There are already capital gains taxes 
that Americans pay when they cash 
out an investment, when they sell what 
they have been holding and realize ac-
tual gains. Now Democrats want to go 
much further and tax certain citizens 
just because their holdings have gone 
up in value, regardless of whether they 
have actually sold them and made any 
money. 
Get this: In parallel with taxing peo-
ple on hypothetical gains they haven’t 
realized, they apparently also want to 
hand out tax breaks for hypothetical 
losses—losses—that people haven’t re-
alized. So they want to tax gains they 
haven’t realized and hand out tax 
breaks for losses people haven’t real-
ized. 
This harebrained scheme would have 
the IRS penalizing people who have in-
vested wisely and compensating people 
who have invested poorly, all inde-
pendent of whether they have actually 
made or lost any money. Let’s just 
think of the unintended consequences, 
like the fact that, in the event of a 
market crash or financial crisis, the 
government would be on the hook for 
massive automatic tax cuts for billion-
aires or the fact that some experts sug-
gest this new scheme would drive the 
wealthiest 
Americans 
away 
from 
stocks and bonds, push them into other 
tax shelters, and thereby reduce the 
growth in ordinary Americans’ invest-
ments that households rely on for col-
lege funds and 401(k)s. 
Or the fact that new, innovative en-
trepreneurs whose startups begin to 
grow in value could now get hit with a 
crushing tax bill long before their com-
pany is actually cash-flow positive. 
The next visionary startup founder 
could have to sell away ownership pre-
maturely just to pay Uncle Sam. 
Our Democratic colleagues have be-
come so tax hike happy that they are 
throwing spaghetti at the wall to see 
what sticks. Now they are talking 
about rewiring the entire economy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7325 
October 25, 2021 
after a couple of days’ discussions on 
the back of an envelope. It is a massive 
and untested change that has not re-
ceived any—any—meaningful study or 
scrutiny. 
Even the Democratic chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee is 
complaining: 
It hasn’t been marked up, and there’s been 
no vetting of it. 
Our Democratic colleague, the senior 
Senator from Montana, says: 
Anytime you get into stuff that’s not prov-
en in the tax code, it becomes a bit dan-
gerous. 
The senior Senator from Virginia 
says: 
My fear is that we’re going to try some in-
novative new ideas and if we don’t have time 
to develop them . . . we could mess some of 
this up. 
No kidding, Madam President. 
This is just the latest saga in this 
long parade of Democratic tax hikes. 
Nonpartisan analysts have shown that 
various aspects of the Democrats’ plans 
would shatter President Biden’s prom-
ise to leave the middle class alone. I 
guarantee you, the middle class will 
get hit. 
When Republicans had power, we 
prioritized giving Americans a big tax 
cut. We wanted families to keep more 
of their own money and make Amer-
ican businesses more competitive all 
around the world. 
Democrats want the opposite—his-
toric tax hikes. So families keep less, 
Washington gets more, and our com-
petitors, like China, can pop the cham-
pagne.

BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is 
possible—it is just possible—that the 
Republican Senator from Kentucky, 
who is the minority leader on the floor, 
has been sitting in on the revenue ne-
gotiations for the reconciliation. But it 
is possible—I don’t rule that out—it is 
possible that we didn’t know it, but he 
was actually sitting for breakfast in 
Wilmington, 
DE, 
with 
Schumer, 
Manchin, and other leaders as they 
were hammering out the revenue and 
tax portions, but I doubt it. 
I doubt that the Senator from Ken-
tucky has really been in the inner 
workings and decision process of what 
is going to be in the revenue package 
when it comes to the reconciliation 
bill. I couldn’t tell you. 
Maybe the Presiding Officer knows 
more than I do; but it is a matter of ne-
gotiation, and it is ongoing, and it has 
not been agreed to. Yet when you hear 
the Senator from Kentucky come to 
the floor, he is announcing what is 
going to be in the package as if he 
knows. I don’t think he does. 
There are a couple of things that we 
do know for sure. We know what the 
Republican vision of tax policy in 
America is because they have shown it 
to us over and over again. When Donald 
Trump was elected President, the Re-
publican Senators had a chance to do 
their reconciliation package, and they 
devoted it to changing the Tax Code. 
And to no one’s surprise, they came 
through with their time-honored ap-
proach: cut taxes on the wealthiest 
people in America and the poor and 
middle-class people will be happy as 
clams. 
Well, they did it and did it again and 
added to the deficit in the process. In 
fact, under their Republican President, 
Donald Trump, we had the largest in-
crease—36 percent—in the debt than 
under any President in history. 
So when they come talking to us 
about tax policy, they favor the rich; 
and the impact on the deficit, they 
don’t pay any attention to it when 
they have a President of their own 
party. I think we know that the facts 
speak for themselves. 
Here is what we do know as well: One 
of the provisions in the American Res-
cue Plan under President Biden really 
specifically went after helping working 
families and lower-income families. 
And it bears remembering and repeat-
ing that not a single Republican was 
willing to vote for that package in ei-
ther the Senate or the House. They all 
voted against it. 
One of the things included in it was a 
tax break for families with kids. How 
about that? A tax break for families 
with kids instead of a tax break for the 
multimillionaires 
and 
billionaires 
which were part of the Republican 
package 4 years ago. 
So it basically came down to kids 
under the age of 6, parents received 
$300 a month in a tax break; and those 
between 6 and 17—I think these figures 
are correct—received $250 a month. 
That money flowing to these families 
with children was the largest tax cut— 
it really dwarfed anything that the Re-
publicans ever did to help working 
families. And we are trying to keep it 
on the books. I am, and I think you are 
too, and all of us are. 
Do you know why? Because we have 
too darn many families struggling in 
America, and they are in poverty. 
And we talk a lot about it, and we 
say: ‘‘Isn’t it a darn shame in a great 
country like this? That you can’t af-
ford food for your children, you can’t 
afford a roof over your head, you are 
facing eviction, you can’t afford the ba-
sics to send them to school, you can’t 
afford new clothes and a new pair of 
shoes.’’ 
We say, Isn’t it a darn shame. But 
now we have done something about it 
in the American Rescue Plan without a 
single Republican vote, not one. So our 
tax policy helps lower-income families, 
particularly those with children, and if 
we can do it—I think we can—we can 
engineer that tax cut to make it per-
manent to help families. 
I just heard President Biden—he was 
in New Jersey speaking about infra-
structure and Build Back Better, the 
reconciliation plan. He said that in the 
State of New Jersey, this child tax 
credit, which we enacted without a sin-
gle Republican vote helping us, has re-
duced child poverty in that State by 36 
percent. I will bet you it has done the 
same thing in my State if it has done 
it in New Jersey. 
So we are getting practical results 
that help working families. If we have 
our way in reconciliation, we are going 
to give the largest tax cut in the his-
tory of this country to middle-income 
and working families, exactly the op-
posite of what the Senator from Ken-
tucky just said: ‘‘Oh, it’ll be the big-
gest tax increase in history.’’ 
Well, there will be a tax increase, I 
hope, for those who can afford to pay 
it, and that means the same people who 
got a benefit 4 years ago from the 
Trump Republican tax policy. 
A lady named Lydia in my home 
State of Illinois described what this 
means to her. She wrote to my office, 
and she said: ‘‘With the child tax cred-
it, I’ll be able to buy my kids their 
school supplies, clothes, things they 
need to go back to school,’’ and she 
added, ‘‘be able to buy some groceries.’’ 
Think about the last time that any 
Senator stopped and thought: I wonder 
if I will have enough money to buy gro-
ceries this week. 
Here is a mom in Illinois, with kids, 
who says that our tax policy—the one 
that was just criticized by the Senate 
Republican leader—is helping her. 
Well, if the Republicans were in 
charge, I am afraid they would take 
that money that Lydia, who wrote to 
me, is talking about buying groceries 
and put it right in Jeff Bezos’ pocket. 
Now, I have nothing against Mr. 
Bezos. He has done fabulously well. I 
have talked to him once, maybe twice, 
a long, long time ago. I am not opposed 
to people investing in business, being 
successful, and making money, but I 
don’t believe that his income should be 
somehow walled off from the Tax Code. 
I believe he ought to pay his fair share. 
And if I remember correctly—and I will 
stand corrected if I am wrong—I don’t 
believe he paid taxes last year. 
So we are looking at that and saying: 
Mr. Bezos, congratulations. Amazon is 
a big deal. It is making a lot of money, 
and all of us—most of us—are partici-
pating in it, but you ought to pay some 
taxes. If you can build rockets and

take your friends up for a little shot 
into space, shouldn’t you pay a few 
bucks in taxes? 
I don’t think it is unreasonable. 
The same thing holds true for these 
corporations. When we look at the big-
gest corporations and most profitable 
in America, too darned many of them 
pay no Federal taxes. 
What is going on here? 
We live in a country where success 
leads to wealth, and wealth leads, I 
think, to some social responsibility, 
and that includes paying your taxes. 
Under President Biden’s Build Back 
Better agenda, we want to extend the 
child tax credit, give working families 
a little breathing room, and reduce 
child poverty in America. Now, if they 
want to come up and criticize us for re-
ducing child poverty in America, so be 
it, but call it for what it is. We are put-
ting our tax policy on the side of fami-
lies with kids. 
For our Republican colleagues who 
say families like Lydia’s don’t need 
any help, they do. And we cannot walk 
away from them. 
Not a single Republican will vote for 
this reconciliation bill. We know it. 
They didn’t vote for the rescue plan. 
That is just their choice. I’m sorry to 
say that we are not going to build back 
America better unless we change some 
policy and tax policy to help working 
families makes a difference. 
I mentioned to you how the deficit 
skyrocketed during the Trump admin-
istration. Well, the Senator from Ken-
tucky comes and repeats over and over 
again: Well, they are going to do it 
again; they are going to run up the def-
icit. 
We have a plan to pay for the pro-
grams that we are talking about, and it 
means putting a new tax responsibility 
on people who are wealthy. 
The President made it clear: I don’t 
want taxes going up on anybody mak-
ing less than $400,000 a year. 
So any tax policy we have will affect 
the wealthy and corporations that 
aren’t paying their fair share. That is 
our approach. It is quite a bit different 
than the Republican approach. 
Building back better is also going to 
do something about easing long-term 
inflationary pressure and making life 
affordable for families. The things we 
will invest in, in the Build Back Better 
agenda, are spread over a number of 
years, and they will pave the way for 
an enduring economic recovery. These 
policies will help parents get back to 
work by making safe, reliable childcare 
more accessible. 
I don’t know what the final negotia-
tions will be on Build Back Better. We 
know the amount of money involved is 
going to be less than we originally 
thought. We are going to have to 
change some things, but I certainly 
hope that this idea of childcare—af-
fordable, quality, safe childcare—is 
part of the final package. 
It means so much to so many work-
ing families, particularly to moms who 
can’t get back to work unless they 
have peace of mind and have their kids 
in good hands while they are working. 
Everyone, from single mothers to our 
Nation’s economists, can tell you the 
best way to stabilize the American 
economy is by supporting working fam-
ilies. 
In fact, the report by Moody’s con-
cluded 
that 
the 
Republican 
fearmongering about inflation—and we 
hear it every day on the floor—Moody’s 
called it ‘‘overdone.’’ Moody’s is hardly 
a Democratic publication. But the fear 
of inflation is one of the reasons Re-
publicans give for not wanting to even 
talk about changing tax policy in 
America. 
This pandemic has shown us the 
cracks in our economy. This Build 
Back Better package will get us to the 
point where we can start to rebuild it 
in the right way—give families finan-
cial relief, invest in our Nation’s eco-
nomic potential. 
The President said in New Jersey— 
and I couldn’t agree with him more— 
we have never gone wrong in America 
investing in the people in this country. 
We have a lot of hard-working people. 
They do it every single day for their 
families. Those who come to this coun-
try keep up the tradition. 
But they need the tools to succeed. 
One of those tools is education. I hope 
we can find a way to expand opportuni-
ties in education for training for our 
workers into the 21st century. 
Talk about giving the store to the 
Chinese, if we don’t invest in our work-
ers and their training and education in 
the next generation to make sure that 
it is smarter than the last, then, we are 
going to lose ground to the Chinese. 
I wanted to say one last word here. I 
see the Senator from Ohio is here so I 
am going to be quick about this. 
It is easy to overlook—take a look at 
this chart. It is easy to overlook com-
puter chips, small pieces of silicon. 
They power so many products and ap-
pliances, that we use every day, that 
we don’t pay much attention. They are 
in our computers, smartphones, life-
saving medical equipment, appliances, 
microwaves, and our cars—dozens even 
in the cars that we drive. 
There 
is 
a 
global 
shortage 
of 
microchips. That is one of the reasons 
why it has slowed down production of 
new vehicles and why the market for 
used vehicles is tighter than usual, be-
cause of these little chips. And we have 
become too reliant on foreign countries 
to produce them. 
In a bill that we considered a few 
months ago, we put direct investment 
in America in building microchips. I 
think that is money well spent. I hope 
it works. I think it can. If we can pro-
vide these microchips, we don’t have to 
wait for some company in Taiwan or 
China to send us this critical element 
that is needed to build all of these 
products. 
The global shortage of computer 
chips and the higher cost to consumers 
is one example of how we failed to in-
vest in our Nation’s resilience. I have 
to say that education and investment 
in American production and workers is 
the best way to get this economy mov-
ing again. We need to have a reserve 
supply of these chips so that we can 
build the autos and provide for the as-
sembly lines and stabilize prices for ev-
erything from toasters to tractors. 
It is an important undertaking, and I 
hope my colleagues will realize that 
Build Back Better, the reconciliation 
bill, is dedicated to the same premise. 
NOMINATION OF MYRNA PEREZ 
Madam President, let me close with 
reference to a vote that we face today. 
We have another qualified nominee, 
Myrna Perez, for the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals. She is really com-
petent and experienced. She has been 
handling complex civil litigation and 
will be ready to serve on the Second 
Circuit on day one. 
She has earned degrees from Yale 
University, Harvard University, and 
Columbia Law School. After grad-
uating, she clerked for the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the District of Pennsyl-
vania and the Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals. She has dedicated her career 
to defending Americans’ right to vote 
through her work at the Brennan Cen-
ter for Justice, where she serves as the 
director of the Voting Rights and Elec-
tion section. In this capacity, she has 
led their efforts to defend the Voting 
Rights Act and to protect, as John 
Lewis said, this ‘‘precious, almost sa-
cred right.’’ 
Far too few nominees to the Federal 
bench have significant experience in 
handling civil rights and voting rights 
matters. In Ms. Perez, the Senate has 
the opportunity to confirm a com-
petent judge who will bring this experi-
ence to the bench. Importantly, she un-
derstands the difference between being 
an advocate and a judge. I have every 
confidence she will serve with dili-
gence, fairness, and impartiality. 
And she will also bring demographic 
diversity to the Second Circuit. She 
will be the first Latina to serve on that 
court 
since 
former 
Judge 
Sonia 
Sotomayor—now Justice Sotomayor. 
Ms. Perez’s nomination has received 
broad support—across the spectrum— 
from national civil rights groups, lead-
ers in law enforcement, academics, 
faith leaders, as well as Senators from 
her own State, Senators Schumer and 
Gillibrand. 
One group of police chiefs and sher-
iffs and prosecutors sent a letter extol-
ling her virtues. I ask unanimous con-
sent to have it printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Re Law Enforcement Support for Nomina-
tion of Myrna Pe´rez to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. RICHARD DURBIN, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES GRASSLEY, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, MINOR-
ITY LEADER MCCONNELL, CHAIRMAN DURBIN, 
and RANKING MEMBER GRASSLEY: As mem-
bers of law enforcement, across the political 
spectrum, we write to express our support 
for the confirmation of Myrna Pe´rez to serve 
on the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit. The undersigned include 
current and former police chiefs, sheriffs, 
and federal, state, and local chief prosecu-
tors 
from 
jurisdictions 
throughout 
the 
United States. 
Ms. Pe´rez’ distinguished legal career in-
cludes leading the Brennan Center for Jus-
tice’s Voting Rights and Election Program, 
serving as the Civil Rights Fellow at 
Relman, Dane & Colfax, and clerking for the 
Honorable Anita B. Brody of the United 
States District Court for the Eastern Dis-
trict of Pennsylvania and Honorable Julio M. 
Fuentes of the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Third Circuit. For nearly two 
decades, Ms. Pe´rez’ primary concern has 
been honoring the Constitution to ensure 
that our nation’s democracy is inclusive, 
voting rights are protected, and elections are 
administered fairly. 
As leaders in law enforcement, we are 
deeply concerned with the rule of law and 
view public safety as intrinsically linked 
with the public’s confidence and trust in our 
nation’s democracy. Ms. Pe´rez has spent her 
entire career as a civil rights attorney and 
public servant, frequently working alongside 
the law enforcement community in efforts to 
restore federal and state voting rights for ex- 
offenders disenfranchised by a felony convic-
tion. We are confident that Ms. Pe´rez will 
bring diversity of thought and experience to 
the federal bench and that her conviction for 
what is fair and just will strengthen the in-
tegrity of our nation’s judiciary. 
We respectfully urge the Senate Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to swiftly advance 
Ms. Pe´rez’s nomination and for the Senate to 
confirm this exceptional nominee without 
delay. 
Sincerely, 
Jim Bueermann, Former President, Na-
tional Police Foundation, Former Police

Mr. DURBIN. Several faith leaders 
also submitted letters, including Rev. 
Allison DeFoor, who wrote that Ms. 
Perez is ‘‘an individual of the highest 
integrity. She is thoughtful and sound 
in her judgment and committed to 
principles of justice that transcend pol-
itics. She embodies the true meaning 
of public service and would be an ex-
ceptional federal judge.’’ 
Ms. Perez’s nomination received bi-
partisan support in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
In short, she is a seasoned litigator, 
ready to take on an important job. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in sup-
porting her. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND GOVERNMENT 
SPENDING 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor again this evening 
to talk about the legislation that is be-
fore us. 
One is the bipartisan infrastructure 
legislation that passed this Chamber 
with 69 votes. It is great for America. 
It addresses real problems we have in 
upgrading our infrastructure, but it 
also deals with competitiveness. 
My colleague from Illinois just made 
a good point that we are in a global 
competition with other countries, in-
cluding China. One reason we are not 
doing as well as we should is that the 
other countries are putting a lot more 
of their money into infrastructure—be-
cause it is good for their economies— 
and we are not. 
As an example, China spends a lot 
more, as a percent of their GDP, on in-
frastructure than we do—much more. 
So bridges and roads and railways and 
ports—ports are a big problem right 
now—all of these would be improved 
and would make our economy, there-
fore, more efficient. As the economists 
say, that makes us more productive as 
a country and allows us to be able to 
compete globally. 
Right now, with these supply chain 
issues, whether it is freight on the rail 
system or whether it is our highway 
system, or whether it is our port sys-
tem or our waterway system, all of 
which need help, it would be easier for 
us to deal with this transition we are 
going through if we had better infra-
structure. 
This 
infrastructure 
bill, 
unfortu-
nately, has gotten intertwined with an-
other bill over in the House of Rep-
resentatives. So, although it passed 
here on its own merits—standing alone 
as an infrastructure bill with no new 
tax increases, no tax increases—when 
it got to the House of Representatives, 
the Speaker of the House wanted to 
combine it with another bill, which is 
what has been called around here the 
reconciliation bill, which refers to a 
process here in the U.S. Senate—a rare 
process—where, instead of having the 
normal 60 votes—a supermajority for 
legislation—under 
reconciliation, 
a 
couple of times a year, you can have 
something that only needs to get 50 
votes, assuming that you have the 
Presidency in your party because then 
the Vice President, as the President of 
the Senate, can come and break the tie 
to get to 51. So that is the reconcili-
ation process that the Democrats want 
to use for this other bill. 
What is the other bill? 
It is a huge tax-and-spend bill. 
Just as I believe infrastructure would 
be good for our country, it is actually 
counterinflationary 
based 
on 
the 
economists. 
Why? 
Because you are doing long-term in-
vestments in capital assets. That is 
good for pushing back against infla-
tion. More spending on social pro-
grams, which is what is in the rec-
onciliation bill, would add to inflation 
at a time when we already have a huge 
problem there. 
Also, the huge amount of spending 
would be unprecedented. We will talk 
about that in a minute, depending on 
how much spending is in there. 
So that is one bill, and the infra-
structure bill is separate. 
I, again, call on my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives—the leader-
ship over there—to let the infrastruc-
ture bill go, allow it to be voted on on 
its merits. Don’t tie it as a political 
hostage to this reconciliation bill, the 
tax-and-spend bill, that the Democrats 
have had a really hard time passing 
through the system. Infrastructure 
needs to stand on its own. The Amer-
ican people deserve that. It has been al-
most 3 months—almost 3 months— 
since the Senate passed it, and people 
are waiting, and they deserve the help. 
By the way, it helps in a broad range, 
not just on the roads and bridges and 
the rail and the ports and the water-
ways I talked about; it helps with resil-
ience to push back against an actual 
disaster—something all of our States 
are experiencing. 
It is something that helps with re-
gard to our energy policy—it makes us 
more competitive—and, yes, it encour-
ages us to use the resources we have 
but to do so through carbon capture. 
And it encourages us to move to more 
electric vehicles; it encourages us to be 
more competitive on that front as well. 
Infrastructure means, also, digital 
infrastructure. It actually, for the first 
time ever, provides a huge boost to 
having high-speed broadband spread all 
around the country, particularly in our 
rural areas, like in Ohio, where we 
have some areas—about a third of our 
State—that do not have access to it. 
People can’t do the appropriate tele-
health that they want to do. They cer-
tainly can’t do the telelearning they

want to do. It is difficult to even go to 
school these days and do your home-
work if you don’t have access to the 
internet. Of course, it helps us back in 
Ohio, if we have the internet, to be able 
to start businesses in these rural areas 
of Ohio. 
So this is all in the infrastructure 
bill. That is why, again, it got 69 votes 
here in the U.S. Senate. That is not 
usual around here. It is truly bipar-
tisan. President Biden says he will sign 
it. Let’s pass it. If we pass it in the 
House, it will be signed into law, and it 
will begin to help our country at a 
time when we need the help. 
We also could use a little bipartisan-
ship around here, don’t you think? 
This is one we can agree on. 
Why should it be held political hos-
tage to something that is strictly par-
tisan and controversial and, in my 
view—in my view—would be dangerous 
to our economy right now? 
Now, why do I say that? 
Well, this new spending that would 
be in the bill would be the highest level 
of spending that we have ever seen in 
the U.S. Congress. Remember, origi-
nally it was $3.5 trillion because origi-
nally it was $6 trillion, and then $3.5 
trillion. Now there is discussion—I just 
read a report this afternoon in one of 
the media sources—saying it may be as 
low as $2 trillion—$2 trillion. That is 
two thousand billion dollars in addi-
tional spending at a time of record 
deficits and debt. 
Now, people say: Well, that is a lot 
less than 3.5. 
Yes, but it would still be the largest 
bill ever passed by the U.S. Congress— 
ever. The $1.9 trillion that was passed 
in March—not that long ago—which 
was supposed to be for COVID but most 
of which is not going for COVID pur-
poses, was the largest ever. This would 
be $2 trillion—a little larger than 
that—adding up together to almost $4 
trillion of new spending. 
Again, when the $1.9 trillion was 
passed, a lot of people said, including 
me: This is a risk to our economy right 
now. We are coming out of the pan-
demic with a growing economy. Why 
overheat the economy right now? 
But we did, and it caused much of the 
inflation we are now experiencing. 
The Secretary of the Treasury under 
the Obama administration and an econ-
omist in the Clinton administration, 
Larry Summers, a Democrat, said the 
same thing, and he continues to say it 
today because he believes that all of 
this new spending is going to add to 
more overheating of the economy and 
more inflation. 
We don’t need that right now. We 
have inflation that is not transitory. 
It, unfortunately, looks like it is very 
much permanent in terms of this year 
and next year, at least. 
That is a huge problem because it is 
the lower-income and middle-income 
workers who are hurt the worst. It is a 
tax—a hidden tax. So, for the people 
who are seeing wage gains this year, 
those are being eaten up, for the most 
part, by inflation. The annual inflation 
right now, based on the last month, is 
5.4 percent. So, unless your wage rate 
is above that, you are in trouble. 
Plus, everything is just more expen-
sive. So gasoline, if you go to the 
pump, is 42 percent higher this year as 
compared to last year—42 percent. Nat-
ural gas is expected to be in about that 
range, about 40 percent higher. 
I did some research recently about 
pumpkins—you know, we are going 
into the holiday season this year—for 
Halloween. 
What does a pumpkin cost? 
Well, guess what. It costs, on aver-
age, 14.7 percent more this year as 
compared 
to 
last 
year. 
Groceries, 
clothes, your utility bills—everything 
is going up. So it is not the time to 
pump a lot more stimulus spending 
into the economy, which, again, people 
say is going to lead to higher inflation 
on everything. 
Remember, 
before 
the 
pandemic 
started, back in February of 2020, we 
had a strong economy. We had the 19th 
straight month then of wage gains of 
over 3 percent every month for 19 
months. Exactly what we wanted— 
right?—were wages going up. We had 
the lowest poverty rate in the history 
of our country since we started keeping 
track of it back in the 1950s. We had 
the lowest unemployment rate ever for 
certain groups in our economy—His-
panics, Blacks. We had the lowest un-
employment ever, overall, for the last 
50 years. So things were going pretty 
well. 
Yet, now, when we look at what is 
happening, we are not seeing these 
wage increases. In fact, on average, 
when you take inflation into account, 
they say that during the Biden years, 
during the Biden administration over 
the last several months, wages have 
gone down an average of 1.9 percent 
largely because, again, of this infla-
tion. 
The legislation also includes big tax 
increases so it is not just about more 
spending; it is also about tax increases 
to pay for the spending. In recent days, 
it has come out that some of these tax 
hikes might not be supported by all 
Democrats, so they might not be able 
to include them all. I suppose, you 
know, that would be better for the 
economy, but as the economy is com-
ing out of the pandemic and growing, 
the last thing we want to do is to raise 
taxes. Again, back in 2017, when tax re-
form occurred, it had a lot of good im-
pacts, including, again, higher wages; 
we talked about the poverty rate; we 
talked about unemployment being low. 
Another thing that it did on the glob-
al competitiveness side, on the inter-
national side, is that it actually 
changed the way our economy worked. 
Prior to that, you had a number of 
companies that literally were voting 
with their feet and leaving the United 
States of America because of the Tax 
Code. It drove all of us crazy—Demo-
crats and Republicans alike—that you 
had companies that were inverting, as 
they say, and these inversions meant a 
company that was a U.S. company one 
day became a foreign company the next 
day. 
This happened in Ohio. We had com-
panies leaving Ohio to become Irish 
companies, as an example, because 
they had a lower tax rate, and we had 
the highest corporate tax rate of any of 
the developed countries, of the coun-
tries in the OECD. 
That is a terrible thing. Of course, we 
wanted to stop that, so we put the re-
forms in place to say: We are going to 
lower our rates so our rate is competi-
tive, and we are going to change the 
way we tax internationally. 
And guess what. All of the inversions 
stopped—all of them. 
And now, unbelievably, the adminis-
tration and the Democratic leadership 
want to raise those taxes again—once 
again, to make us uncompetitive glob-
ally. And, again, you will see some 
companies say, when they look at the 
analysis from, you know, their tax ex-
perts: Why are we an American com-
pany? 
You would hope no company would 
ever do that, but they were doing it be-
fore 2017. During the Obama adminis-
tration, at the beginning of the Trump 
administration, they were leaving. So 
we don’t want that to happen again. 
In fact, we want our workers and our 
businesses to be competitive. I say 
‘‘workers’’ because, when you raise the 
business taxes, guess who takes the 
hit. Ask the CBO, the Congressional 
Budget Office, here. What CBO will tell 
you, which is a nonpartisan group here 
in the U.S. Congress, is that their anal-
ysis is that about 70 percent of the in-
crease in corporate taxes is borne by 
workers; about 70 percent of the cut in 
taxes helps workers—higher wages, 
higher benefits. The Tax Foundation 
has the same analysis. The Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation, when they look at 
this legislation before us, the 3.5 tril-
lion that was reported—that was intro-
duced—they said it will raise taxes on 
middle-income 
workers, 
well 
below 
400,000. A lot of that was because of 
this issue—because, again, the non-
partisan Joint Committee on Taxation 
up here in Congress looked at it and 
said: Well, who is going to bear the 
brunt of this? It is going to be workers. 
So workers’ wages are going to go 
down if you raise taxes on these indi-
vidual companies that are global com-
panies. 
So that is what we are facing. Now, 
again, it looks like there are going to 
be some changes in the legislation. I 
mentioned that the amount may go 
down some. I mentioned $2 trillion, 
still the largest spending bill ever. 
I, also, on the tax front, am told that 
some of the tax hikes may be taken 
out; some of them may be kept in. One 
that they are talking about keeping 
in—that the administration, in par-
ticular, seems adamant about keeping 
in—I just don’t get because it, again, 
makes our companies less competitive 
globally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7329 
October 25, 2021 
It is a complicated provision in the 
international tax code. It is called the 
global intangible low-taxed income, 
also known as GILTI. What does GILTI 
say? 
Well, when we changed our Tax Code 
back in 2017, we put in place, in effect, 
a minimum tax for our companies that 
do business overseas. 
Our competitive countries—countries 
like ours, developed countries—for the 
most part, almost all of them do not 
tax their companies for their foreign 
income. So if a company—I mentioned 
Ireland earlier—from Ireland or Ger-
many, whatever, does business over 
here, their government doesn’t tax 
them on the income they get from the 
United States. It lets the United States 
handle that. 
And we changed our Tax Code to say, 
well, we are not going to do that ei-
ther, but we are going to add a min-
imum tax no matter what, and that 
was called the GILTI tax. It was put in 
place in 2017 as part of, again, a broad 
and successful group of tax reforms 
that took bold steps to reassert our 
competitiveness, and it worked. 
They took our rate from 35 percent 
down to 21 percent, putting it at about 
the middle of the developed countries. 
Now it is actually above the middle be-
cause other countries have gone below 
us again. 
We went to what is called a terri-
torial-type system. So it all worked. 
About over 1.5 trillion was reinvested 
in America, by the way, from overseas. 
So it worked in that sense too. We 
stopped the corporate inversions. 
But this GILTI, or the minimum tax 
on foreign income, was put in place as 
a way to make sure that foreign in-
come wouldn’t be shifted to low-tax ju-
risdictions. 
Right now, this GILTI rate stands at 
13.125 percent. So it is 13 percent, 
roughly, 
for 
American 
companies. 
Again, most of our competitors don’t 
have it at all, but it is 13 percent. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen has now 
worked with countries around the 
world to say everybody ought to have a 
global minimum tax, and she has made 
progress on that. So some of these 
countries that have not had a min-
imum tax are now looking at one and 
to put one in place. The one that she 
wants for everybody is 15 percent. 
So here we are, globally telling these 
other countries in the world: You have 
to have a global minimum tax of 15 
percent. OK. So wouldn’t you think, 
then, you would want America not to 
have a tax above that amount? 
No, they want to change the GILTI 
amount from 13.125 percent to an effec-
tive rate of 17.4 percent. They started 
off at 21 percent in the original intro-
duced bill. But even 17.4 percent—why 
would you want to put American com-
panies above, again, this global average 
of 15 percent? If you are going to re-
quire companies to go to 15, why would 
you want the United States to be above 
that? But that is what is being pro-
posed—believe it or not. 
And, by the way, they are saying 
that we would go ahead and go to 17.4 
percent before any other countries in 
the world would have to do it—2 years 
before they would have to do it. Wheth-
er they do it or not is a question. 
Let’s be honest. Some countries don’t 
want to do it, and they may not do it. 
Their legislatures may not let them do 
it. 
But let’s assume that they do follow 
suit. We would be out there 2 years ear-
lier with a higher tax rate on our work-
ers. Remember who bears the brunt of 
this tax increase. Our companies would 
be noncompetitive. Our workers would 
be noncompetitive. 
So I would hope that, as my col-
leagues are looking at this—I know it 
seems easy: Let’s just tax the inter-
national companies—that they would 
look at what happened in 2017, the posi-
tive impacts of that and the negative if 
we reverse course and go back and 
raise our taxes above what other coun-
tries charge. 
By the way, to do this would mean 
nullifying tax treaties that we have 
with other countries all around the 
world because it is a different way of 
approaching it. We do not have a min-
imum tax in place now. So the tax 
treaties would have to be amended. 
That means, obviously, to me, that you 
would have to have a tax treaty change 
here in America. In other words, you 
can’t change tax treaties just on one 
side. It is bilateral. So we would have 
to change our tax treaties here. 
Treaties have to go through the U.S. 
Senate. As you probably know, they 
have to go through the U.S. Senate, 
and it is a two-thirds vote to change a 
treaty. There is a reason for that. It is 
part of our checks and balances to be 
sure that treaties, which are a very se-
rious undertaking, are something that 
you get a strong bipartisan support for. 
And yet my understanding is that the 
Secretary of the Treasury and others 
in the administration are saying that 
they are not sure that we have to get 
this GILTI change or these treaty 
changes that we have with other coun-
tries through the U.S. Senate. We just 
might do it through some other way, 
administratively or through an Execu-
tive legislative action. 
I sure hope they don’t do that. That 
would set a terrible precedent. It would 
mean that this whole constitutionally 
based rule we have with regard to trea-
ties would be very difficult to uphold in 
the future for anything. 
Let me be clear. This is bad for work-
ers as well as bad for companies. The 
National Association of Manufacturers 
just did a recent study, and they found 
that hiking the GILTI rate in a way we 
just talked about could cost up to 1 
million U.S. jobs. 
Again, CBO here in the Capitol, the 
Tax Foundation, the Joint Committee 
on Taxation—all of them believe this 
would saddle our workers with lower 
wages and lost jobs by making our 
businesses less competitive globally. 
I am also concerned that the admin-
istration is talking about imposing a 
burdensome new information reporting 
requirement that would require far 
more information from taxpayers than 
is needed to enforce our tax laws. That 
represents an unprecedented invasion 
of taxpayer privacy. 
You have probably heard about this 
because it is getting more and more at-
tention—the so-called $600 limit. Now, 
this would mean that the IRS would re-
ceive a report from you every year for 
any expenditure. Think about an ex-
pense or a payment going in or out of 
your checking account of $600 or more. 
Recently, again, based on a report I 
saw today, the administration and 
Democratic leadership here on Capitol 
Hill are talking about changing that 
$600 to $10,000. So it would be a higher 
threshold. Now, that higher threshold 
is something that most Americans 
would reach pretty quickly. 
Think about it. Ten thousand dollars 
a year in total expenditures. Eight 
hundred thirty dollars per month is 
what that is. 
So think about that: Do you spend 
830 bucks a month on groceries, gas, 
clothes, essentials? If you do, then be 
prepared for the IRS to be able to look 
through your tax records in ways they 
never have before. 
Don’t get me wrong. I believe enforc-
ing our tax laws is important, and I am 
actually one of the Republicans—there 
may not be many of us—who believes 
that the IRS should have more re-
sources for things like improving their 
computer system because it is so anti-
quated. 
I spent 2 years of my life studying 
this. Several years ago I came up with 
some reforms out of a commission. We 
improved it. It needs to be improved 
again. 
The computer systems they have, 
both the software and the hardware, 
and, frankly, their ability to use them, 
is way outdated, and it is not good for 
taxpayers. It is bad for small business, 
and it is bad for individuals because 
the right hand often doesn’t know what 
the left hand is doing. So I am for that. 
I am for better taxpayer service and 
providing more funding for that. 
But I am not for providing tons more 
data to the IRS that has nothing to do 
with income that is unprecedented that 
their systems cannot handle. There is 
no way that they would be able to han-
dle these millions and millions of new 
data that they would be getting from 
all of us—hundreds of millions of ac-
counts from financial institutions; e- 
payment 
apps, 
like 
Venmo; 
and 
cryptocurrency 
exchanges, 
like 
Coinbase, are going to be subjected to 
more paperwork and confusion if this 
happens. 
If you have one of the 403 million ac-
tive PayPal accounts, watch out. Your 
personal account information may be 
sent to the IRS. And, boy, that is going 
to result in some confusion at some 
point. 
Again, if you are one of the vast ma-
jority of Americans who spend more 
than 830 bucks a month on anything,

then you are going to have to report 
that. 
So there are some people who are 
pretty smart about this, who have 
looked at it and said: This doesn’t 
make sense. 
One of them is Steven Rosenthal. He 
is at the left-leaning Tax Policy Cen-
ter. He stated that this would ‘‘bury 
the agency in a sea of unproductive in-
formation.’’ 
That is how I feel about it. Again, I 
would like to have the IRS be better in 
terms of what they could do with tech-
nology and be able to handle their job 
better to be able to ensure that every 
taxpayer gets a fair shake, because 
sometimes, right now, again, the left 
hand doesn’t know what the right hand 
is doing because their computer system 
is so antiquated—software, hardware, 
everything. But as he said, they can’t 
handle the data they have. 
Mark Everson, who is a former IRS 
Commissioner, wrote a really inter-
esting op-ed that I read yesterday. He 
wrote that this proposal would ‘‘prove 
all but impossible for the IRS to handle 
and engulf the service in a damaging 
political firestorm.’’ That is from Mark 
Everson. 
By the way, Mark Everson wants to 
give the IRS more money to improve 
their computer systems. He thinks 
there is not enough enforcement with 
regard to partnerships right now, as an 
example, or he thinks taxpayer service 
should be improved. So he is not some-
one who says we should starve the IRS, 
but he is saying: Don’t do this. Don’t 
do this, add this new information re-
porting that is not information about 
income and that the IRS is not going 
to be able to handle, and it is an intru-
sion into our lives that is unnecessary. 
That is in the legislation. 
So, again, I have come down to the 
floor here every week since the origi-
nal introduction of this tax-and-spend 
legislation we have talked about today. 
This is the sixth straight week that I 
have come to the floor. When we are in 
session, every week, I am going to 
come—continue to come—as long as 
this bill is out there, because I want 
the American people and my colleagues 
to know what is in this legislation and 
why it would be so damaging to our 
country right now. 
And, again, I distinguish the infra-
structure bill—good for the economy, 
the right thing to do to counter infla-
tion; something every President in 
modern times has tried to do, by the 
way, for good reason. Let it stand on 
its own. It should be voted on, on its 
own merits. Don’t entangle it with this 
tax-and-spend legislation that is reck-
less, at a time of rising inflation and 
higher debts and deficits, at a time 
when our economy is finally getting on 
its feet. Let’s not add job-killing tax 
hikes. Let’s not add this massive new 
spending. 
It is in our national interest to move 
forward with regard to the infrastruc-
ture bill, and it is in our national in-
terest to stop the reckless tax-and- 
spend legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Ala-
bama. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, after being in Washington, DC, 
for 10 months, I have seen this town 
jump from one issue to another. Sadly, 
many of the issues we face are self-in-
flicted—illegal 
immigrants 
on 
the 
southern border, Americans who re-
main trapped in Afghanistan, and 
rampant inflation, just to name three. 
But we face a more serious threat in 
this Nation, an issue larger than left or 
right, a threat that goes beyond con-
servative and liberal—China. 
China seeks to shackle the United 
States economically, technologically, 
and militarily. The Communist leaders 
of China are employing every instru-
ment of national power to diminish our 
standing and influence in the world. 
Last 
month, 
President 
Biden 
told 
world leaders during his maiden U.N. 
General Assembly speech that the 
United States ‘‘is not seeking a cold 
war.’’ Well, the United States may not 
be seeking out a new Cold War, but 
China is, so we shouldn’t give them the 
shovel to bury us. 
When asked this week if China’s 
hypersonic missile testing over the 
summer was a surprise to U.S. officials, 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki 
joked that the Biden administration 
‘‘welcomes stiff competition.’’ Busi-
nesses that are struggling under unfair 
competition from China didn’t laugh at 
the Press Secretary’s joke. 
Intelligence 
analysts 
who 
watch 
week after week as China hacks its 
way to technological superiority know 
the competition is cheating. 
Military leaders who stand the watch 
for us worry that the United States 
public may be asleep at the wheel to 
this enormous threat. 
In 2001, then-Senator Biden said: 
The United States welcomes the emer-
gence of a prosperous integrated China on 
the global stage because we expect this is 
going to be a China that plays by the rules. 
President Biden, China is not playing 
by the rules. 
The 
Director 
of 
National 
Intel-
ligence, Avril Haines, said the fol-
lowing in her Annual Threat Assess-
ment: 
The Chinese Communist Party . . . will 
continue . . . to . . . undercut . . . the 
United States, drive wedges between Wash-
ington and its allies and partners, and foster 
. . . international norms that favor the au-
thoritarian Chinese system. 
The four-star admiral in charge of 
our nuclear overwatch, ADM Charles 
Richard, warned the country that Chi-
na’s growth and strategic nuclear capa-
bility was ‘‘breathtaking.’’ 
To those paying attention, we know 
that China seeks to play a very dan-
gerous game—a game they intend to 
win and a game they will win unless we 
stand united as a nation and work to-
gether to face this growing threat. 
So let’s take a look at the most re-
cent breathtaking development. China 
recently 
conducted 
their 
ninth 
hypersonic missile test since 2014— 
their ninth. 
By the way, 2014 was when then- 
President Obama was forced to start 
investing in missile defense after he 
ended or slowed funding for several 
programs early in his first term. 
What was important about China’s 
most recent test, however, is that it 
showed off China’s advanced space ca-
pabilities. 
Hypersonic 
missiles 
are 
weapons that fly at more than five 
times the speed of sound, 3,800 miles 
per hour. They don’t follow a fixed tra-
jectory; their path is flexible and ma-
neuverable. This is what makes them 
so hard to defend against. 
A recent congressional report on 
hypersonic weapons revealed that the 
United States will not have a defensive 
capability against hypersonic weapons 
until the mid-2020s at the earliest. 
Unlike our government, which, by 
the way, is wasting money on civilian 
climate corps and bailing out poorly 
run liberal blue States, China spends 
its resources on deadliness—a new and 
larger navy, a modernized nuclear arse-
nal, advanced space assets, and artifi-
cial intelligence. Yes, China is moving 
ahead and investing in killing ma-
chines. 
Developing hypersonics is costly. The 
Pentagon noted as much recently, 
which is ironic given how little this ad-
ministration has showed it cares about 
throwing trillions of dollars around on 
other programs not related to national 
security. China continues to outspend 
us on national security. In just the last 
10 years, China’s defense spending has 
increased by $200 billion, while we, the 
United States of America, have de-
creased by $400 billion. 
That brings me to a very important 
point. Senator SCHUMER needs to bring 
up the National Defense Authorization 
Act for a vote here on the Senate floor. 
Every year since 1960, we have passed 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, better known as the NDAA. The 
NDAA is one of few bills that the House 
and Senate, Democrats and Repub-
licans, work together on. That is be-
cause our military deserves it, and our 
national security depends on it. 
One of the most important items we 
agreed on this year in the NDAA was 
that our military needs more support. 
Earlier this year, President Biden 
sent Congress a laughable military 
budget. In a stunning referendum on 
the President’s disappointing and dan-
gerous military budget, Democrats and 
Republicans on the Armed Services 
Committee came together to increase 
our military budget by $25 billion. 
You know, we cannot ask our mili-
tary to do more with less. We cannot 
expect our military to defend new 
threats from our adversaries like China 
without the resources required to do 
the job. Republicans understand this. 
We 
have 
continuously 
fought 
to 
prioritize national security. Democrats 
on the Armed Services Committee also 
understand this. So I would like to ask

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

October 25, 2021 
a simple question: What are we waiting 
for? 
The best way to thank our men and 
women in uniform for their service is 
to pass this bill. The best way to en-
sure our armed services have resources 
they 
need 
to 
defend 
our 
country 
against China is to pass this bill, espe-
cially in light of the news we have seen 
recently about China’s hypersonic mis-
sile testing. 
Earlier this year, as the Senate 
Armed Services Committee crafted the 
NDAA, I fought to prioritize robust 
funding authorization for high-energy 
lasers and hypersonic missile develop-
ment. This investment accelerates the 
country’s timeline to a fully capable 
hypersonic missile while at the same 
time assisting our missile defense ca-
pabilities with tracking hypersonic, 
ballistic, and cruise missiles. This is an 
offensive and defensive approach. 
China is actively trying to outpace 
us, and keeping pace is not enough. To 
do that, we need to have sustained, 
strategic investment in our military. 
That is what the NDAA provides and 
why we need a vote on the Senate 
floor. So what does it say about Leader 
SCHUMER’s priorities that passing our 
military authorization is at the bottom 
of his list? 
But investment in their military is 
not the only means by which China is 
seeking to get ahead. We have seen in-
creased efforts by China to infiltrate 
our economy—we have seen this—to 
undermine our free market values, and 
to steal our international property. 
In a recent survey, a greater number 
of Americans said that China is more 
powerful economically than the United 
States. This is a reversal from 2 years 
ago when most Americans said the 
United States had the economic upper 
hand. 
When it comes to taking over the 
economic upper hand, China has no 
rules, and Chinese companies definitely 
do not play by ours. Our country has 
already 
seen 
Chinese 
companies, 
backed by the Chinese Communist 
Party, attempt to invest in and even 
take over companies. This grave na-
tional security threat will only grow if 
we allow China to invest in our critical 
industries. 
Our government has a process to in-
vestigate offers made by foreign com-
panies and governments that want to 
acquire or invest in America. This 
process is designed to protect our na-
tional security. It is handled by a gov-
ernment entity called the Committee 
on Foreign Investment in the United 
States, better known as CFIUS. But if 
there is a loophole, communist China 
will try to slip through it. 
Our goal as Members of Congress 
should be to strengthen this vetting 
process. One way to do that is to add a 
permanent agricultural perspective to 
this committee, which is not on there 
as we speak. The COVID pandemic 
showed us just how important it is to 
have strong supply chains, especially 
when it comes to our food supply. 
Every American is supported by a safe 
and secure food supply. It is critical to 
our country’s prosperity. 
Not everyone thinks about food secu-
rity in relation to national security, 
but they are linked. Global corpora-
tions have already become more in-
volved with our domestic food supply 
and agricultural businesses. Recent 
data shows that 192,000 acres of farm-
land or forest in the United States of 
America are linked to Chinese owner-
ship, including land used for farming, 
ranching, and forestry—192,000 acres 
here within our borders. That is why 
we need more transparency. 
Our food supply must remain secure 
from foreign governments like China 
that have no business being in the 
American economy and actively trying 
to harm our country. That is why I in-
troduced a bill called the Foreign Ad-
versary Risk Management, or FARM, 
Act, to put more protections in place 
for America’s agriculture industry. My 
bill will ensure that our agriculture in-
dustry has a permanent seat at the 
table of CFIUS, which reviews agri-
culture-related 
investments. 
As 
we 
speak, we do not have representation 
from the agriculture community. By 
adding agriculture supply chains as a 
covered transaction that CFIUS has to 
review, we can make sure food supply 
chains remain strong and free of dam-
aging foreign government interference. 
Like China’s communist leaders, left-
ists in this country believe that when 
it comes to the economy, bureaucrats 
know best. They think raising the cor-
porate rate to be higher than com-
munist China’s will strengthen our 
economy. Nonsense. That is like stand-
ing in a bucket and trying to lift your-
self by the handle. The far-left cheers 
for mandates, hyperregulation, and 
massive taxes. They sneer at your free-
doms and are triggered by the Amer-
ican flag and our constitutional rights. 
Their way is not the way to combat 
China; it is the way to become China. 
We all know China wants to overtake 
the United States as a superpower. But 
what makes the United States a super-
power is not just our economic and 
military might; we are a superpower 
for what our military is fighting to de-
fend and to protect: our freedoms and 
our values and the American spirit of 
innovation and ingenuity, of hard work 
and grit. These values pose a direct 
threat to communist China. They are 
why China wants to surpass our coun-
try as the world’s No. 1 superpower. 
We need leadership that protects our 
national security and our economic se-
curity. It is the only way to combat 
the aggression that the Biden adminis-
tration’s weakness has invited. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in 
the coming days, thousands of politi-
cians from 200 different companies will 
convene in Glasgow, Scotland, for the 
U.N. climate summit. They will step 
off their private planes and into meet-
ings about the need to reduce global 
emissions, and I am not sure many of 
them will see the irony of their ac-
tions. These leaders will try to paint 
fossil fuels as the world’s greatest 
enemy. They will make lofty and, yes, 
unrealistic commitments to eventually 
transition to clean energy sources. At 
the same time, they will completely ig-
nore the realities of the current energy 
landscape. 
Around the world, energy shortages 
are having a costly impact on working 
families. Here at home, Americans are 
experiencing sticker shock at the gas 
pump. Gas prices, after all, have gone 
up by more than 55 percent from just 1 
year ago. If you are driving a pickup 
truck, you will spend almost $32 more 
to fill up your tank today than you did 
last October. 
In States like California, the prob-
lems are even worse. Last week, the 
price of a gallon of regular gas in one 
town hit $7.59 a gallon, and premium 
was nearly $8.50 a gallon. It is hard to 
imagine how somebody operating on a 
fixed income or working a minimum- 
wage job would cover those sorts of ex-
penses, especially since it is lower in-
come Americans who typically have to 
travel farther because of the high cost 
of living and housing in our major 
urban areas. So low gas prices are the 
only thing that will allow them to get 
by. 
But gas prices are not the only grow-
ing energy expense in family budgets. 
As we head into winter, heating bills 
are expected to soar. Households could 
pay up to 54 percent more than they 
did last winter. It will cost more to 
heat your home, more for your family 
to visit for the holidays, more to put 
holiday meals on the table, and more 
to buy gifts for under the Christmas 
tree. This holiday season is shaping up 
to be a pricey one. 
Costs at home are growing by the 
day, and our friends across the Atlan-
tic aren’t faring any better. Europe, in 
fact, is in the midst of an unprece-
dented energy crisis. A supply shortage 
has caused prices to skyrocket. For ex-
ample, since the start of the year, nat-
ural gas prices are up almost 600 per-
cent. The situation is so dire that util-
ity companies have switched from nat-
ural gas, which is the cleanest burning 
fossil fuel, to coal and fuel oil. 
This global energy crisis serves as 
the backdrop for this summit in Glas-
gow, where the world leaders will dis-
cuss plans to further reduce the use of 
fossil fuels. They are not saying what 
they would do as an alternative; they 
just want to kill the goose that laid 
the golden egg when it comes to low 
cost, cleaner burning energy like nat-
ural gas. Now, making promises to 
curb emissions sounds pretty good if 
you could, in fact, do it. It sounds good 
until you realize this is what you get: 
unreliable and unaffordable energy. 
In Europe’s case, there is also a very 
dangerous power dynamic at play. The 
supply of energy to the continent could

be increased, but the guy controlling 
the 
spigot—his 
name 
is 
Vladimir 
Putin. One of Russia’s top priorities is 
Nord Stream 2, a pipeline to carry 
more gas directly from Russia to Eu-
rope. This project, of course, has been 
years in the making and has faced con-
siderable opposition around the world, 
especially among our colleagues on 
this side of the aisle. 
President Biden has already handed 
Moscow a massive victory by stepping 
aside and refusing to impose sanctions 
on the company building Nord Stream 
2. Now Putin is withholding des-
perately needed gas from Europe until 
the pipeline is approved. Yes, he is 
using energy as a weapon against those 
who are totally dependent on Russia 
for that energy. 
This is a problem with the global ef-
forts to quickly move—too quickly— 
before we are ready, away from fossil 
fuels. Phrases like ‘‘energy transition’’ 
appeal to some activists but fail to de-
liver results in the real world in real 
time. Renewables are great, but they 
don’t come close to generating enough 
reliable energy to power our world be-
cause the wind doesn’t always blow, 
and the Sun doesn’t always shine. 
We can’t just sit in the dark until 
Mother Nature lets us turn the lights 
back on. We need a base supply of reli-
able energy, and as much as some of 
our colleagues hate to admit it, nat-
ural gas is our best current option. If 
the United States and our allies scale 
back production to pursue arbitrary 
emission benchmarks, they will leave 
the world turning to countries like 
Russia, Iran, and Venezuela for their 
energy. Today, we are experiencing 
how costly that reliance is, and in 
years 
past, 
we 
acknowledged 
how 
downright dangerous it is. In January 
2009, Russia effectively turned the gas 
off to Ukraine for almost 3 weeks, and 
at least 10 countries in Europe were af-
fected. 
By transitioning solely to renewables 
before the output matches the demand, 
we are placing ourselves in a very, very 
vulnerable position, and the same is 
true for our allies. President Putin has 
demonstrated as much. 
Unfortunately, I don’t expect those 
kinds of real-world concerns to domi-
nate the conversations at this summit 
in Glasgow, and President Biden cer-
tainly won’t be advocating for Amer-
ica’s energy independence—to the con-
trary. We were only a few hours into 
the Biden administration when they 
launched the first attack on American- 
produced energy. Within hours of tak-
ing the oath of office, President Biden 
canceled the permit for the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. For some strange reason, 
he is OK with Nord Stream 2 from Rus-
sia to Europe, but he is not OK with 
the Keystone XL Pipeline here in 
America. I don’t get it. 
There is no question that the biggest 
losers from this decision were the en-
ergy workers whose jobs evaporated 
and the communities that stood to ben-
efit from the tax revenue. The biggest 
winners, unfortunately, from President 
Biden’s decision include countries like 
Russia and Saudi Arabia, who now hold 
too much power on the global energy 
market. We will see how that is play-
ing out. 
That same day, the Biden adminis-
tration halted all new leasing permits 
on Federal lands and waters. Rather 
than responsibly harvest our greatest 
natural resources and share those re-
sources with the rest of the world, the 
administration sent more business to 
our adversaries and to OPEC producers. 
President Biden piled on with an-
other attack on our energy producers 
by rejoining the Paris climate accord— 
an agreement that no one seems to fol-
low. Yes, they will pay lipservice to it, 
but they actually don’t do anything 
about it. A report published last week 
found that countries around the world 
aren’t sticking to the lofty commit-
ments that they made. The world’s 
major economies are not on track to 
meet the climate goals set in the Paris 
accord. In fact, according to this re-
port, by 2030, these countries are ex-
pected to produce more than double the 
amount of fossil fuels required to meet 
the goals of the Paris climate accord. 
Then there is the fact that China, 
which plays by nobody’s rules except 
their own, which also happens to be the 
world’s leading polluter, is completely 
AWOL from any of these efforts. Not 
only is China ignoring global efforts to 
curb emissions, the country is in the 
process of building hundreds of new 
coal-powered powerplants. Last year, 
China built three times as many new 
coal powerplants as any other country 
in the world combined—three times all 
the other countries in the world com-
bined. 
Rather than pull out of the agree-
ment that is weakening our global en-
ergy security, President Biden is mak-
ing even bigger promises—promises 
that he cannot keep. He nearly doubled 
the emissions reduction goals set by 
President Obama in 2015. President 
Obama pledged to reduce emissions by 
26 to 28 percent by 2025, and we are no-
where close to meeting that goal. But 
President Biden has doubled down and 
vowed to cut emissions by 50 to 52 per-
cent by 2030—a complete fantasy. He 
hasn’t explained how he would accom-
plish meeting that goal, nor, if he 
tried, would he be able to explain it be-
cause it is simply infeasible. 
To be clear, I am a strong supporter 
of efforts to reduce emissions. There 
are more ways than one to skin the 
cat. Texas has been a leader, in fact, in 
efforts to develop cleaner and more di-
verse sources of energy. We are truly 
an ‘‘all of the above’’ State. We 
produce more electricity from wind 
turbines than any other State in the 
Nation. New solar farms are being built 
all across our State, and private com-
panies are making incredible invest-
ments in carbon capture and other 
emission-reducing technologies. I am 
proud of this work and a staunch sup-
porter of efforts to preserve our great-
est natural resources for future genera-
tions. But what we are seeing from the 
administration isn’t a thoughtful effort 
to reduce emissions; it is virtue sig-
naling. 
When the President addressed a joint 
session of Congress earlier this year, he 
spoke about the challenges to reduce 
carbon emissions. He said: If we do it 
perfectly, it is not going to matter. 
How he expects to do it perfectly, he 
did not say, nor could he. But if that is 
what he is thinking, why drive up en-
ergy costs to the point that Americans 
can’t afford to turn the heat on in win-
ter? Why would he give Putin the 
power to regulate Europe’s only source 
of energy—natural gas? Why curb do-
mestic energy production and let China 
run wild? These actions may earn votes 
in support from some corners, but they 
will inflict serious pain on the Amer-
ican people, as well as our allies around 
the world. 
As an armada of Biden administra-
tion officials pack their bags for Glas-
gow, I want to remind them that there 
is far more at stake than just the 
President’s credibility on this score. It 
is our future economy. It is our ability 
to provide good, well-paying jobs to 
hardworking American families, and it 
is our ability as Americans to export 
energy, which allows some of our 
friends and allies around the world not 
to depend solely on the tender mercies 
of Vladimir Putin. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
it has been a while since congressional 
Democrats 
have 
used 
the 
words 
‘‘defund the police.’’ That was a very 
popular phrase in 2021, but after the 
last election, Democrats learned how 
truly toxic those words were with ordi-
nary Americans. Now they dare not say 
the words ‘‘defund the police,’’ but 
make no mistake about it, liberals are 
still trying to defund the police. 
A recent nominee for a high-level 
post at the Department of Justice said 
that she wasn’t in favor of defunding 
the police, but she talked about it— 
‘‘overspending on criminal justice sys-
tem infrastructure and policing.’’ That 
was just a fancier way of saying ‘‘cut 
police budgets.’’ 
Fortunately, the voters are standing 
up to these people, and I want to give 
just two examples. 
First, voters in Minneapolis will go 
to the polls November 2 and decide 
whether to replace the city’s police de-
partment with a department called the 
Department of Public Safety. This sup-
posed Department of Public Safety 
would take a ‘‘comprehensive public

health approach’’ in trying to keep the 
city safe. Under this idea, police offi-
cers could be employed if necessary. 
Well, the American voters have news 
for the people who got this initiative 
on the ballot in Minneapolis: Police of-
ficers are absolutely necessary in Min-
neapolis, and they are necessary in 
every other community as well. 
Another example. In Austin, TX, vot-
ers will have a chance to restore fund-
ing for their police force—funding that 
the city council slashed a great deal 
last year. 
The murder rate in Austin is higher 
than it has ever been. So far, 71 people 
have been killed in Austin, passing the 
previous record of 59 murders set all 
the way back in 1984. And with 71 mur-
ders, we still have 2 months left in this 
year, if you want to compare it to all 
the murders that took place in 1984, a 
previous high. 
Some Austin voters have had enough 
of this sort of thinking, and they are 
trying to restore some common sense 
there in Austin. Under the Proposition 
A ballot initiative, the city would have 
to maintain at least 2 police officers 
for every 1,000 residents, which is more 
than they have at the present time. 
But not everybody likes that, and 
liberal 
dark 
money 
groups 
have 
pumped a half million dollars into de-
feating this Proposition A because they 
want to keep defunded police still 
defunded. 
Those same groups recently sub-
sidized the campaigns of hard-left dis-
trict attorneys all throughout the 
country. That includes the San Fran-
cisco district attorney, who has let 
drug and property crimes skyrocket. 
San Francisco is now getting ham-
mered with out-of-control drug use, 
and shoplifting there happens to be a 
way of life. 
That isn’t CHUCK GRASSLEY saying 
that; that is anybody watching tele-
vision who sees pictures of people just 
going into stores and just picking up 
whatever they want. In one city, if it is 
under $950, you won’t be prosecuted. So 
it is a license to shoplift. 
I hope Austin, TX, voters will make 
sure that their city doesn’t go the 
same way. I would like to think they 
would want to be safe from criminals 
and the drugs that criminals push. 
Liberal politicians are no longer say-
ing it out loud, ‘‘defund the police.’’ 
But make no mistake about it, many of 
them still want to defund police. 
If Minneapolis and Austin let their 
police forces wither away on the vine, 
voters all across the Nation and all 
across the political spectrum will send 
a very clear message to the hard left in 
the next election. So voters everywhere 
should 
stand 
up 
and 
say 
no 
to 
defunding the police. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SOCIAL MEDIA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, last week, a Tennessee director of 
schools named Russell sent me an 
email about a problem he is having 
with some of his students. The so- 
called 
devious 
lick 
TikTok 
trend 
caught on in his district, and it is more 
than just a viral gag. The idea behind 
this devious lick TikTok trend is to de-
stroy school property and document it 
on TikTok so that all the world can 
see—the more violent, the better. 
Here is how Russell described what is 
going on in his schools: 
In Cleveland City Schools, we have seen 
fire extinguishers stolen, mirrors removed 
from walls, a toilet was removed from its 
foundation, and multiple other acts of van-
dalism. I know of stories from other school 
districts, where even more serious types of 
vandalism and theft have taken place. 
He went on to tell me that this trend 
has caused thousands of dollars in dam-
age, and that he has had to resort to 
threatening suspensions, court cita-
tions and other actions to deter stu-
dents from demolishing school prop-
erty—all from a TikTok video trend. 
I want to state for the record that 
this is absolutely insane. This is not 
normal teenage behavior. It is criminal 
activity, and these kids are posting it 
online thinking that they are building 
social media clout. 
TikTok banned the trending hashtag, 
but last night, it took a member of my 
staff about 10 seconds to unearth posts 
featuring 
students 
trashing 
their 
school bathrooms. 
Russell is at a loss as to how to get 
his students to stop body slamming 
doors off their hinges, and so are thou-
sands of parents all across Tennessee 
who are wondering how it is even pos-
sible that a tech company is getting 
away with encouraging criminal behav-
ior in its underage users. 
They want more than just an apology 
and a tweak to an algorithm. They are 
looking for accountability, and I am 
happy to say that we at the Senate 
Commerce Committee are working to 
get that accountability from these Big 
Tech companies. 
The issue of Big Tech’s toxic influ-
ence on children and teens is finally 
getting some much-needed bipartisan 
attention from the Senate. Earlier this 
month, I hosted a hearing in the Com-
merce Committee’s Consumer Protec-
tion 
Subcommittee 
with 
Chairman 
BLUMENTHAL, 
where 
we 
examined 
Facebook’s role in promoting content 
to teenagers that drove young users 
into spirals of despair, eating disorders, 
self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. 
Now, our ideas about what Congress 
should do to force accountability into 
the equation might differ a bit, but 
maybe for the first time ever, the rela-
tionship 
between 
Republicans 
and 
Democratic tech watchdogs in this 
Chamber is far less contentious than 
the relationship between Big Tech and 
Members of Congress. And, Madam 
President, that is something worth 
noting. 
If we keep this up, Silicon Valley, as 
they currently operate, is in for some 
big changes because, as much as I ap-
preciate our role as lawmakers, I also 
believe in the importance of our ability 
to compel transparency from officials 
and companies that refuse to offer it up 
voluntarily. Sunlight is often a better 
disinfectant than legislation. 
Fortunately, at least some players in 
tech are reading the writing on the 
wall. Tomorrow, representatives from 
YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok will 
testify before the Consumer Protection 
Subcommittee regarding safety proto-
cols they have inserted between under-
age users and the seediest corners of 
the internet. Yes, I did say ‘‘underage 
users.’’ 
I want to thank them in advance for 
agreeing to appear because we are not 
going to take it easy on them. They 
should not expect a comfortable day. 
We have evidence that these platforms 
have endangered children and teens 
while collecting—yes, collecting—their 
personal 
data 
and 
leveraging 
it 
through the advertising side of their 
businesses. The danger is real. 
As we were preparing for the hearing, 
my staff hopped on YouTube and 
searched for ‘‘how to slit your wrists,’’ 
and the videos YouTube spit out—well, 
let’s just say that any questions about 
how to do such a thing were answered 
in full, unfortunately. 
Earlier this year, a 9-year-old boy in 
Memphis died trying to participate in a 
TikTok ‘‘strangulation challenge’’ that 
had gone viral. 
And we know for a fact that child 
predators use Snapchat to troll for vic-
tims. This spring, law enforcement ar-
rested a 48-year-old man for statutory 
rape after they caught him with a 16- 
year-old girl. 
Where did he meet her? 
On Snapchat. 
We also have serious questions about 
data collection and disclosure policies 
and whether or not the market re-
search 
tactics 
that 
are 
used 
by 
YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok are as 
invasive and dangerous as the ones 
that we now know Facebook uses. 
As the saying goes, if the service is 
free, you are the product. And if we let 
them, tech companies will continue 
grooming our kids into accepting sta-
tus as commodities and being their 
product, regardless of who it hurts. 
Big Tech’s relationship with children 
is a problem, but we also need adult 
tech enthusiasts to care about their 
own entanglements with these compa-
nies. We need everyone to care about 
how their own ‘‘virtual you’’ is har-
vested and sold to the highest bidder. 
Many adult users believe that, be-
cause they have lived so much of their 
lives online, these things don’t matter 
anymore. But, yes, indeed, it does mat-
ter, and I will give you just one exam-
ple of why. 
For a long time now, we have raised 
serious concerns about the connection

between TikTok and the Chinese Com-
munist Party. We suspect, with very 
good reason, that ByteDance, which is 
TikTok’s parent company, handed over 
biometrics and other sensitive user 
data to the Chinese Communist Party. 
This app has been Beijing’s very best 
detective, a fact most users aren’t 
aware of and don’t want to give a sec-
ond thought to. 
Parents are completely unaware that 
TikTok is owned by ByteDance and 
that they are in cahoots with the Chi-
nese Communist Party. Parents are un-
aware that the biometrics and other 
sensitive data of their precious chil-
dren is now in the hands of the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
Madam President, we just cannot af-
ford to continue this. This one app on 
its own is a master class on artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, and fa-
cial recognition technology, and our 
most dangerous competitor is using it 
to corner the market on the world’s 
most valuable commodity: the virtual 
you. 
It is all part of Beijing’s grand strat-
egy to gain control over strategically 
important sectors of the global econ-
omy. Yes, indeed, they intend to be 
globally dominant by the time we get 
to the midpoint of the century; and, 
yes, indeed, they are an adversary. 
We see them carrying out more of 
this agenda via the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative programs. And they are doing it 
online by training us to consume con-
tent that is so twisted that it drives 
young users to violence and to self-de-
structive behavior. 
Interconnectivity has benefits and 
consequences, and, Madam President, 
it is an urgent need to take action 
against the consequences. We know 
from previous investigations that dig-
ital content is a weapon. It can damage 
self-esteem, destroy relationships, and 
tip the balance of global power in the 
wrong direction. 
I hear from Tennesseans like Russell 
regularly. They will say: We saw this 
coming a mile away. We have watched 
this become a snowball rolling toward 
us. 
They are appreciative that Congress 
has finally caught up to them—parents 
and teachers who are watching what is 
happening on social media—and they 
are ready for us to pull all those Big 
Tech skeletons out of the closet and 
put them on display. 
I will say this: These teachers and 
parents are not people who are anti-in-
novation. They don’t want to get in the 
way of private companies offering ex-
citing new products. They appreciate 
interconnectivity, and they appreciate 
technology. But what they won’t do is 
tolerate 
these 
companies—tolerate 
them trolling the data of our children, 
selling it as a product, and then turn-
ing around and weaponizing the con-
tent against us, the American people. 
Big Tech needs to understand that we 
are not going to hold back, and it 
would be in their best interest to work 
with us on the issues of online privacy, 
children’s online privacy, data secu-
rity, and make the virtual space a safe 
space. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
I yield the floor.

f 
NICARAGUA 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it has 
now been more than 4 months since 
Daniel Ortega’s police arrested and 
subsequently disappeared political op-
position leaders Felix Maradiaga and 
Juan Sebastian Chamorro in Nica-
ragua. On June 8, police stopped 
Maradiaga’s vehicle, forcibly removed 
him, and took him away. Later that 
day, over 40 police officers forced their 
way into Chamorro’s home and ar-
rested him as well. For nearly 3 
months, they were held in undisclosed 
locations, without access to their law-
yers, doctors, or families and without 
being charged with any crime. They 
were reportedly kept in solitary con-
finement, subjected to frequent inter-
rogations, deprived of sleep, and they 
have each lost 20 to 25 pounds. 
In August, they were indicted for op-
erating an international conspiracy to 
funnel foreign resources ‘‘to provide 
logistical support and create favorable 
conditions to harm the supreme inter-
ests of the nation.’’ These charges, 
which are blatantly political, were 
brought before an unnamed judge in a 
secret hearing in which their lawyers 
were not permitted to be present. This 
is what is called ‘‘justice’’ in Nicaragua 
today. Nothing more than a sham proc-
ess intended to silence Daniel Ortega’s 
political opposition, and it is yet an-
other example of the flagrant repres-
sion and abuses of human rights that 
have become a trademark of his gov-
ernment. 
This summer alone, more than 30 
other opposition leaders were subjected 
to similar abuses, and the government 
is reportedly currently unlawfully de-
taining more than 150 political pris-
oners, including former Ambassador to 
the United States Arturo Cruz who is 
known to many of us. He was kept in 
solitary 
confinement 
for 
approxi-
mately 80 days, has reportedly lost 40 
pounds, and is even denied access to 
reading material so he has almost no 
way of learning about current events 
outside the prison walls. 
There is only one explanation for 
such blatant injustices and cruelty in-
flicted on individuals who have done 
nothing that would remotely amount 
to a crime under international law or 
in most countries of the world, and 
that is that Daniel Ortega is afraid. He 
knows that if he allows a free and fair 
election, he and his wife Rosario 
Murillo, the Vice President, would al-
most certainly lose.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7337 
October 25, 2021 
The sad reality is that it did not have 
to be this way. Ortega could have cho-
sen a different path, and won the sup-
port of the Nicaraguan people by trust-
ing them and treating them with re-
spect, and allowing those with different 
views to speak freely. Instead, he chose 
repression and has held onto power 
through force and by blaming everyone 
but himself for Nicaragua’s chronic 
under-development. On November 7, 
with the opposition silenced and hidden 
away, he and his wife will likely be vic-
torious in another sham election, a 
farce that will fool nobody. 
I join those in condemning the re-
pressive tactics of the Ortega govern-
ment and in calling for the immediate 
and unconditional release of Felix 
Maradiaga, Juan Sebastian Chamorro, 
Arturo Cruz, and the many other polit-
ical prisoners falsely accused or im-
prisoned without charge. I urge the 
Nicaraguan Government to end the re-
pression of dissidents, the shootings of 
peaceful protestors, and the crackdown 
on press freedom and voting rights. 
It is no secret that the United States 
and Nicaragua have had a difficult his-
tory. The United States was the pri-
mary benefactor of the dictatorial 
Somoza family, which ruled the coun-
try for more than four decades, enrich-
ing themselves and their cronies, and 
brutalizing their opponents. Daniel Or-
tega had the opportunity to be dif-
ferent, but to many Nicaraguans and 
international observers, he and his wife 
are even worse. 
The Biden administration has al-
ready responded to this summer’s ar-
rests by imposing sanctions on four 
members of the Ortega government and 
has denied access to visas for 169 Nica-
raguans in response to the political 
crackdown. The U.S. actions encour-
aged the EU and Canada to also impose 
targeted 
sanctions 
on 
Nicaraguans 
complicit 
in 
politically 
motivated 
crimes. 
I commend the Biden administration, 
the EU, and the Canadian Governments 
for standing up for the rule of law and 
the rights of the people of Nicaragua. I 
urge the White House to investigate 
the assets and holdings of the Nica-
raguan armed forces in the U.S. and to 
consider appropriate actions to hold its 
leadership accountable for their role in 
the gross violations of human rights in 
that country. I encourage President 
Biden to use every diplomatic tool and 
every form of targeted sanctions to ob-
tain the release of Daniel Ortega’s pris-
oners and to create the conditions for a 
genuinely free, fair, and transparent 
election in Nicaragua.

TRIBUTE TO JOSH BAKER 
Mr. OSSOFF. Madam President, I 
rise to commend Josh Baker, a British 
national, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, 
for his vital and lifesaving contribu-
tions to the allied evacuation of Af-
ghanistan. 
Mr. Baker, of course, is internation-
ally acclaimed for his courageous and 
award-winning 
work 
documenting 
armed conflict and war crimes world-
wide. His sacrifices in the production of 
vital, world-class journalism included 
the sacrifice of his own body, when his 
spine was fractured by a vehicle-borne 
improvised explosive device detonated 
by a suicide bomber in Iraq while 
Baker was on assignment for PBS. 
Mr. Baker’s achievements include the 
production of landmark reports expos-
ing ISIS war crimes against Yazidi 
women and girls, investigations of 
international terrorism, and vital re-
porting on refugee crises. His work has 
documented for the historical record 
and for the education of the global pub-
lic the brutality and indignity imposed 
on innocent human beings by armed 
conflict. 
When, on August 15, 2021, the Afghan 
capital of Kabul fell to Taliban forces, 
hundreds of thousands of foreign na-
tionals and Afghan allies were trapped 
in harm’s way. Mr. Baker sprung into 
action. In August and September of 
this year, Mr. Baker remotely coordi-
nated and supported multiple life-
saving extractions of vulnerable civil-
ians from Afghanistan. 
He applied his deep experience of 
complex operations in hostile environ-
ments and the trust built over years of 
communication 
with 
journalists, 
sources, and contributors in the mili-
tary, intelligence, and political do-
mains, in civil society and at humani-
tarian agencies, to remotely coordi-
nate and support multiple lifesaving 
extractions 
of 
vulnerable 
civilians 
from Afghanistan. 
Mr. Baker’s contributions to these 
historic evacuation efforts included the 
coordination of a lifesaving mission to 
rescue Afghan orphans and the coordi-
nation of logistics necessary for the 
safe evacuation of hundreds of Afghan 
women and girls. 
And so let the U.S. Senate commend 
Josh Baker for his vital and lifesaving 
contributions to the allied evacuation 
of Afghanistan.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RUDOLFO ANAYA 
∑ Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, 
Rudolfo Anaya’s writing captured the 
beauty of New Mexico’s landscapes and 
the strength and resilience of our peo-
ple. It is a testament to the power of 
his literary work that so many New 
Mexicans recognize themselves and 
their families in the characters of his 
award-winning novels. Known to many 
as the godfather of Chicano literature, 
Mr. Anaya taught all of us to cherish 
the rich traditions, cultural heritage, 
and deep-rooted communities in our 
State. 
Mr. Anaya was born and raised in 
Pastura and Santa Rosa, small commu-
nities in Guadalupe County. His child-
hood 
experiences 
on 
the 
desert 
flatlands of the Lllano Estacado later 
inspired much of his best work. After 
his family moved to the historic 
Barelas neighborhood of Albuquerque, 
Mr. Anaya attended Albuquerque High 
School and the University of New Mex-
ico. Through many decades as a life-
time educator, Mr. Anaya taught and 
mentored 
students 
in 
Albuquerque 
Public Schools and at the University of 
New Mexico. 
In 1972, Mr. Anaya published his com-
ing-of-age novel, ‘‘Bless Me, Ultima,’’ 
about a young boy’s search for spiritu-
ality and his sense of place. The novel 
broke new ground by centering the 
unique experiences, complex cultural 
identities, and deep-rootedness of His-
panic and Chicano New Mexicans. 
‘‘Bless Me, Ultima’’ has stirred the 
hearts of countless readers over the 
years and inspired adaptations for the-
ater, a feature film, and an opera. On a 
personal note, reading ‘‘Bless Me, Ul-
tima,’’ was also an important part of 
the experiences and events that led my 
wife, Julie, and I to settle and raise our 
family in New Mexico. 
Over the course of his prolific lit-
erary career, Mr. Anaya wrote a wide 
range of novels, stories, nonfiction es-
says, and poetry that captured the 
spirit and culture of New Mexico. In 
2002, he was awarded the National 
Medal for the Arts by President George 
W. Bush and the National Endowment 
for the Arts. He was awarded the Na-
tional Humanities Medal by President 
Barack Obama and the National En-
dowment for the Humanities in 2016. 
Rudolfo Anaya leaves behind a legacy 
that will never be forgotten. As we re-
member 
his 
incredible 
life, 
my 
thoughts are with his family, the 
countless people he mentored and 
taught, and everyone who experienced 
the power of reading his work. I am 
certain I join so many others in our 
State in honoring and lifting up the 
life of this quintessential New Mexi-
can.∑

350TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
SUFFIELD, CONNECTICUT 
∑ Mr. MURPHPY. Madam President, I 
rise today to commemorate the 350th 
anniversary of the town of Suffield, CT. 
The celebration of this historic mile-
stone, actually achieved last year in 
the height of the pandemic, is just as 
deserved as it is overdue. 
How lucky Connecticut is to have 
won Suffield away from neighboring 
Massachusetts in 1749. With roots dat-
ing back to the 1600s, Suffield’s early 
days were defined by the bounty of its 
fertile farmland along the western 
banks of the Connecticut River. Soon, 
beautiful Colonial and Victorian-era 
homes were built along the town’s now 
iconic Main Street. Industry and com-
merce began to flourish, and by the 
1900s, Suffield was a model Connecticut 
town, able to marry together agrarian 
humility and forward-looking moder-
nity into one common identity. 
Today, Suffield still boasts bucolic 
farms, breathtaking views from the 
Metacomet Ridge, and historic archi-
tecture. But a thriving small business

community, a top-rate school system, 
and active civic groups are showing the 
way to the future. 
For three and a half centuries, 
Suffield has been a foundational part of 
the rich history of the Connecticut 
River Valley. The town has come a 
long way since its inception and con-
tinues to evolve with the times, while 
maintaining its idyllic, small-town 
charm. Congratulations again to the 
entire town of Suffield on this impres-

resent a town with such a storied past 
and an equally bright future.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13413 OF OCTOBER 27, 2006, WITH 
RESPECT TO THE SITUATION IN 
OR IN RELATION TO THE DEMO-
CRATIC 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
THE 
CONGO—PM 14 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
situation in or in relation to the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo declared 
in Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 
2006, is to continue in effect beyond Oc-
tober 27, 2021. 
The situation in or in relation to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
which has been marked by widespread 
violence and atrocities that continue 
to threaten regional stability, con-
tinues to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the foreign policy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13413 with respect 
to the situation in or in relation to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7340 
October 25, 2021 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. SMITH): 
S. 3061. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to eliminate 
the 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient 
psychiatric hospital services under the 
Medicare Program; to the Committee 
on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today with my colleague, Senator TINA 
SMITH, to introduce the Medicare Men-
tal Health Inpatient Equity Act, legis-
lation that eliminates Medicare’s arbi-
trary 190-day lifetime cap on inpatient 
services in psychiatric hospitals. Given 
the steps that Congress has already 
taken to establish parity and improve 
coverage of mental health services, 
this change is long overdue, particu-
larly as the COVID–19 pandemic has 
worsened the already alarming trends 
in the mental health of some Ameri-
cans. 
Notably, an estimated 13.1 million 
adults aged 18 or older in the United 
States are living with serious mental 
illness, representing 5.2 percent of all 
adults 
nationwide. 
These 
illnesses, 
such as schizophrenia and bipolar dis-
order, are chronic conditions that re-
quire ongoing treatment and care over 
a lifetime. When left untreated, they 
can be some of the most debilitating 
and 
destructive 
illnesses 
afflicting 
Americans. 
Unfortunately, our current mental 
health system is fragmented, and these 
individuals all too often lack access to 
the care that they need. That is why I 
have worked to improve mental health 
services across the lifespan and break 
down barriers to treatment. The legis-
lation I am introducing today elimi-
nates another barrier in Medicare, the 
190-day lifetime cap on inpatient serv-
ices in psychiatric hospitals. 
Most Medicare beneficiaries treated 
in inpatient psychiatric facilities qual-
ify because of a disability. As such, 
this current restriction disproportion-
ately impacts non-elderly Medicare 
beneficiaries—mainly those living with 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who 
may be diagnosed at a younger age and 
stay on Medicare longer as a result. 
Sadly, it is young adults aged 18 to 25 
years who currently have the highest 
prevalence of serious mental illness of 
any age group. 
Furthermore, no other Medicare in-
patient service has these types of arbi-
trary caps, which is why elimination of 
Medicare’s lifetime cap was a rec-
ommendation of the 2016 White House 
Mental Health and Substance Use Dis-
order Parity Task Force. While I recog-
nize that this cap was originally in-
tended to limit the Federal Govern-
ment’s role in paying for long-term 
custodial support of the mentally ill, 
keeping a cap on inpatient days at psy-
chiatric hospitals—particularly for pa-
tients who have been living with seri-
ous mental illness from a young age— 
undermines patient treatment options 
and can lead to disruptive transitions 
of care. 
During their life, people with serious 
mental illnesses may need repeated 
psychiatric inpatient hospital stays to 
manage their condition and regain 
quality of life in their community of 
choice. The 190-day lifetime limit can 
hurt people by arbitrarily ending cov-
erage and can disrupt care from a pro-
vider who is most familiar with the pa-
tient. Moreover, when individuals with 
mental illness cannot receive care in 
the right setting, they often end up in 
hospital emergency rooms, in jails, or 
on the streets—leading to worse long- 
term outcomes for the individual, more 
pain and suffering for family members, 
and a greater cost to the taxpayer. 
Outside a psychiatric inpatient hos-
pital, 
it 
is 
difficult 
for 
many 
healthcare facilities to meet the treat-
ment needs of those suffering with se-
vere mental illness. Many general hos-
pitals lack psychiatric care capacity, 
and there are countless examples of 
psychiatric boarding in emergency de-
partments. Skilled nursing facilities 
may also not be best suited to provide 
the 
complex 
and 
specialized 
psy-
chiatric care these beneficiaries need. 
Finally, too many patients find them-
selves receiving care in prisons, or not 
at all, if they are on the streets or are 
on long waitlists for care. As one local 
sheriff in Aroostook County recently 
told me, ‘‘Law enforcement is not 
equipped to handle individuals with 
mental health challenges and yet we 
are faced with that reality every day.’’ 
Similarly, a behavioral health provider 
in Presque Isle, ME, said, ‘‘Imposing a 
limit may appear to reduce cost; how-
ever, the true cost-and toll-on commu-
nity resources is far greater than any 
savings incurred by Medicare.’’ 
On top of all of these existing chal-
lenges, it is clear the COVID–19 pan-
demic has increased stress and isola-
tion, disrupted care services, and dra-
matically changed everyday life and 
even living environments for many 
Americans. With research pointing to 
greater psychological distress during 
the pandemic for people with mental 
illnesses, already a particularly vulner-
able population, I fear we will be trying 
to make up for lost strides in behav-
ioral health care for years to come. 
Now more than ever, we must work on 
commonsense reforms that provide par-
ity between behavioral and physical 
health care, as well as strive to in-
crease access to support and improve 
care coordination. 
As the American Hospital Associa-
tion, which endorses this bill, said, ‘‘As 
we work to further integrate physical 
and behavioral health to better address 
the nation’s behavioral health needs, 
one major obstacle to parity remains 
in the Medicare program—the 190-day 
lifetime limit on coverage for certain 
inpatient psychiatric treatment. With 
the nation’s population aging and an 
increasing number of seniors and peo-
ple with disabilities seeking inpatient 
care to address their behavioral health 
needs, now is the time to repeal this 
discriminatory policy and ensure that 
Medicare beneficiaries can receive nec-
essary inpatient psychiatric care.’’ 
The pandemic may have had a disas-
trous effect on the mental health of the 
Nation, but it has also led to more visi-
bility and the understanding that indi-
viduals with serious mental illness, 
their families, and the communities in 
which they live do not have access to 
the care and resources they need. I 
hope we can use what we have learned 
throughout the pandemic as an oppor-
tunity to reduce stigma and make 
overdue reforms like removing the 190– 
day lifetime cap on inpatient services 
in psychiatric hospitals. 
Our legislation, the Medicare Mental 
Health Inpatient Equity Act, is sup-
ported by a wide range of organiza-
tions, including the American Hospital 
Association and the Mental Health Li-
aison Group, a coalition of 57 national 
organizations representing consumers, 
family members, and mental health 
and addiction providers. This includes 
support from the National Association 
of Behavioral Healthcare, the Amer-
ican 
Psychiatric 
Association, 
the 
American Psychological Association, 
the National Alliance on Mental Ill-
ness, and Mental Health America. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important critical legislation to bring 
greater mental health parity to the 
Medicare Program and give those suf-
fering with serious mental illness ac-
cess to the care they so desperately 
need. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the material be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, October 20, 2021. 
Hon. SUSAN M. COLLINS, 
Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. TINA SMITH, 
Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SENATOR
COLLINS
AND
SENATOR 
SMITH: On behalf of our nearly 5,000 member 
hospitals, health systems and other health 
care organizations, our clinician partners— 
including more than 270,000 affiliated physi-
cians, 2 million nurses and other caregivers— 
and the 43,000 health care leaders who belong 
to our professional membership groups, the 
American Hospital Association (AHA) is 
pleased to support your legislation, the 
Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Equity 
Act. 
On the front lines of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, America’s hospitals and health sys-
tems witness firsthand its far-reaching ef-
fects on behavioral health. The stress from 
unemployment or underemployment, isola-
tion due to quarantine or COVID–19 restric-
tions, and grief over loved ones lost to the 
pandemic are possible to manifest in in-
creases in already high rates of deaths from 
suicides and substance use disorder. Beyond 
COVID–19, we know that as a country to 
prioritize resources that support the behav-
ioral health needs of the country. These in-
vestments will not only help to stymie the 
wave of unmet demand for behavioral health 
services that has been exacerbated by the 
COVID–19 pandemic, but also improve Amer-
ica’s overall health.

October 25, 2021 
As we work to further integrate physical 
and behavioral health to better address the 
nation’s behavioral health needs, one major 
obstacle to parity remains in the Medicare 
program—the 190-day lifetime limit on cov-
erage for certain inpatient psychiatric treat-
ment. With the nation’s population aging 
and an increasing number of seniors and peo-
ple with disabilities seeking inpatient care 
to address their behavioral health needs, now 
is the time to repeal this discriminatory pol-
icy and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries 
can receive necessary inpatient psychiatric 
care. 
We are grateful for your leadership on this 
issue and stand ready to work with you to 
enact this important legislation. 
Sincerely, 
STACEY HUGHES, 
Executive Vice President. 
MENTAL HEALTH LIAISON GROUP, 
Washington, DC, October 18, 2021. 
Hon. SUSAN COLLINS, 
Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. TINA SMITH, 
Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATORS COLLINS
AND SMITH: The 
Mental Health Liaison Group (MHLG)—a co-
alition 
of 
national 
organizations 
rep-
resenting consumers, family members, men-
tal health and addiction providers, advocates 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
committed 
to 
strengthening Americans’ access to mental 
health and addiction care—is writing to ex-
press our strong support for the Medicare 
Mental Health Inpatient Equity Act. This 
critical legislation eliminates the discrimi-
nation against mental illnesses that con-
tinues to exist in the Medicare program as 
Medicare beneficiaries are limited to 190 
days of inpatient psychiatric hospital care 
during their lifetime. This lifetime limit 
does not apply to psychiatric units in gen-
eral hospitals and there is no such lifetime 
limit for any other Medicare specialty inpa-
tient hospital service. 
Through passage of landmark legislation, 
the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Men-
tal Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act 
of 2008, Congress put coverage for mental 
health and substance use disorders on par 
with other medical disorders. Also, that 
year, Congress enacted legislation to equal-
ize the Medicare outpatient coinsurance for 
mental and physical health. Despite this 
progress, discrimination against Medicare 
patients with mental health disorders who 
require ongoing psychiatric treatment and 
hospitalizations, when in crisis, continues to 
exist. 
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commis-
sion reported that most Medicare bene-
ficiaries treated in inpatient psychiatric fa-
cilities qualify for Medicare because of dis-
ability, hence they tend to be younger and 
poorer that the typical Medicare beneficiary. 
These Medicare beneficiaries live with seri-
ous mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia 
and bipolar disorder) and who are living with 
these disorders from a relatively young age. 
These illnesses are chronic and will require 
ongoing treatment and care over their life-
times, including hospitalization when in cri-
sis. 
The elimination of the 190-day limit will 
equalize Medicare mental health coverage 
with private health insurance coverage, in-
crease access for the most seriously ill, im-
prove continuity of care and create a more 
cost-effective Medicare program. 
The MHLG applauds your bipartisan lead-
ership and looks forward to working with 
you and your staff to enact this important 
legislation.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
CONCURRENT 
RESOLU-
TION 16—COMMEMORATING THE 
30TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
OPER-
ATION PROVIDE COMFORT 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for himself and 
Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. CON. RES. 16 
Whereas, after the uprising against Sad-
dam Hussein in March 1991, Hussein turned 
tanks and helicopter gunships on the de-
fenseless citizens of Iraqi Kurdistan; 
Whereas, overwhelmed by the superior fire-
power of the Hussein regime, and having al-
ready experienced the genocidal death of ap-
proximately 200,000 Iraqi Kurds, the wanton 
destruction of approximately 4,500 Iraqi 
Kurdish villages, and deadly chemical bom-
bardment, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi 
Kurdish men, women, and children fled to 
the northern and eastern borders of Iraq, 
fearing that the regime would use poison gas 
against them, as during the Anfal campaign 
and in Halabja only 3 years before; 
Whereas, at one point in the early days of 
the 1991 refugee crisis, the daily death toll of 
fleeing Iraqi Kurds exceeded 1,000, with vic-
tims having no time to gather any posses-
sions or winter protective gear and thus suc-
cumbing to exposure, malnutrition, and dis-
ease; 
Whereas the United States, in response to 
the unfolding human catastrophe, led what 
became the largest humanitarian operation 
of its kind ever, Operation Provide Comfort, 
delivering humanitarian relief and enforcing 
a no-fly zone; 
Whereas Operation Provide Comfort saved 
the lives of countless thousands of Iraqi 
Kurds from near certain death on the freez-
ing and rugged border mountains of Iraqi 
Kurdistan; 
Whereas, to this day, Iraqi Kurds credit 
United States-led Operation Provide Com-
fort, particularly the no-fly zone that pro-
tected the Iraqi Kurdish people until 2003, for 
helping support security and stability in 
Iraqi Kurdistan; 
Whereas Iraqi Kurdistan has long served as 
a safe haven for people fleeing conflict and 
religious and political persecution; and 
Whereas the Kurdistan Regional Govern-
ment and the Kurdish Peshmerga remain 
steadfast partners of the United States in 
the fight against extremism and terrorism: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) commemorates the 30th anniversary of 
Operation Provide Comfort; 
(2) recognizes and honors the heroic sol-
diers, diplomats, political leaders, and coali-
tion partners of the United States who im-
plemented Operation Provide Comfort; 
(3) recognizes and honors the bravery of 
the nearly 2,000,000 Iraqi Kurdish women, 
children, and men who struggled to survive 
starvation and exposure, welcomed the aid 
that came, and embraced the opportunity for 
a new life; 
(4) encourages Iraqi Kurdish leaders to con-
tinue to uphold the values of democracy, 
human rights, and freedom that have made 
Iraqi Kurdistan an oasis in a troubled region; 
and 
(5) reaffirms— 
(A) the strong partnership between the 
United States and the Iraqi Kurds, which ex-
ists in complementarity with the United 
States’ strong partnership with the Govern-
ment of Iraq; and 
(B) the enduring respect and support of 
Congress for Iraqi Kurdish friends of the 
United States who courageously stand with 
the United States in shared opposition to ex-
tremism and terrorism.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
WILLIAM OTIS FITCH 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. William 
Otis Fitch who passed away on September 
22, 2021. My thoughts and deepest condo-
lences are with his family, friends, and loved 
ones. 
Mr. Fitch was born on August 1, 1933. He 
was raised in Holly Springs, Mississippi and 
graduated from Holly Springs High School in 
1951. Bill was an avid outdoorsman and en-
joyed hunting and riding horses. After grad-
uating high school, he enlisted with the U.S. 
Navy and joined the flight team. With this 
team he made lifelong friendships and consid-
ered it an honor to serve his country. 
After his Naval service, Bill began his career 
in consumer finance and lending. He joined 
City Finance Corporation in Memphis as the 
Vice President. In 1974 Bill and his wife, 
Clydean, opened their own consumer lending 
company, First National Loans. He expanded 
the company throughout Tennessee. He sold 
the company and opened a new chain of con-
sumer finance companies, Fidelity Loan Com-
pany. Over the course of his career he served 
as President and board member of the Mis-
sissippi Consumer Finance Association and 
Memphis Consumer Credit. He was a lifetime 
member of the Shriners. 
Preceding him in death are his wife, 
Clydean; mother, Lurline; father, Theodore; 
and brothers Robert, James, and Jerry. Left to 
cherish his memory are his wife, Aleita; 
daughters Lynn and Lisa; six loving grand-
children, and three great-grandsons. 
I am grateful for Mr. Fitch’s service and join 
countless others in mourning his loss.

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the cost esti-

Office for H.R. 3263, the DHS Medical Coun-
termeasures Act. The cost estimate was not 
available at the time of the Committee report

Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost

H.R. 3263 would require the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a 
medical countermeasures program, led by 
the Chief Medical Officer, to facilitate the 
agency’s preparedness for a chemical, bio-
logical, radiological, or similar attack, dis-
ease outbreak, or pandemic. The act would 
require DHS to maintain a stockpile of coun-
termeasures 
(including 
antibiotics, 
antivirals, and treatment for radiation expo-
sure), ensure deployment of these resources, 
and provide training to its employees. H.R. 
3263 also would require the Chief Medical Of-
ficer to establish a countermeasures working 
group, develop an integrated logistics plan 
within 120 days, and report to the Congress 
on implementation of the program within six 
months. 
DHS currently maintains a medical coun-
termeasures stockpile. Using information 
provided by the agency, CBO estimates DHS 
would need three new employees to mod-
ernize the program and meet the training, 
oversight, and reporting requirements in 
H.R. 3263. Furthermore, the agency would re-
quire about $500,000 per year to replace and 
modernize materials in the stockpile. On 
that basis, CBO estimates DHS would spend 
$5 million over the 2022–2026 period to imple-
ment the legislation; such spending would be 
subject to the availability of appropriated 
funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Lindsay Wylie. The estimate was reviewed 
by Leo Lex, Deputy Director of Budget Anal-
ysis.

Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and remember 
Dwight Orville Boyd, a son of Louisiana, who 
transitioned to his eternal heavenly rest late 
night on Saturday, October 16, 2021. 
He was at peace in his final moments be-
side his loving family. 
He was 65 years old. 
As the oldest of five sons, Dwight’s family 
was always at the center of his world. 
His brothers, including Glynn Boyd, one of 
my dearest friends, looked up to their older 
brother and recounted many stories from his 
life. 
He shared how Dwight was the first to get 
a part-time job at Winn-Dixie, and that even as 
a young man, Dwight always made sure to 
give all his siblings gifts during the holidays. 
Friends remember him graciously blessing 
them through his angelic voice when singing 
at church, in weddings, or at the 50-yard line 
during a high school football game. 
He loved the New Orleans Saints, cele-
brating Christmas with family, music, and poli-
tics. 
He made life]ong friends that described him 
as being the pillar of the community. Dwight 
still held childhood friends from Hahnville High 
School, where he was known as ‘‘Mr. 
Hahnville High School.’’ 
He studied journalism at LSU, and through-
out his life was never afraid to speak his mind, 
but always respected the views of others. 
He shined a light on everyone he encoun-
tered. 
My thoughts are with Dwight’s mother Mrs. 
Beverly H. Boyd, his loving family, friends, and 
neighbors as they reel with this loss. 
Rest easy, and may God bless his memory.

CELEBRATING TEXAS SOUTHMOST 
COLLEGE’S 95TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Texas Southmost College (TSC) as 
they celebrate their 95th anniversary, making 
it the oldest institution of higher learning in the 
Rio Grande Valley. 
Texas Southmost College is the first accred-
ited community college in the State of Texas. 
Originally named The Junior College of the 
Rio Grande Valley, TSC was established on 
August 9, 1926, with 84 students attending the 
first classes held on September 21, 1926. In 
1931 it was renamed Brownsville Junior Col-
lege, before its final renaming to Texas 
Southmost College in 1949. After a 20-year 
partnership 
with 
University 
of 
Texas 
at 
Brownsville, TSC’s Board of Trustees voted to 
re-establish the college as an independent in-
stitution in 2011 and it was operating inde-
pendently by 2013. The campus, spanning 
over 48 acres, is located in Brownsville, Texas 
on the historic site of Fort Brown, the first 
United States military post in the state. 
TSC was selected as a ‘‘Bright Spot’’ by the 
White House Initiative on Educational Excel-
lence for Hispanics in 2015 for its efforts to 
bridge the achievement gap and expand ac-
cess to quality higher education. In addition to 
offering high-quality programs that lead to ca-
reers that are in demand, TSC is the most af-
fordable institution of higher learning in the Rio 
Grande Valley, thanks to TSC’s Board of 
Trustees decision in 2013 to reduce tuition by 
40 percent. TSC currently offers two-year aca-
demic credential progression in over 50 pro-
grams of study for students pursuing bach-
elor’s degrees, and career and technical edu-
cation leading to industry certifications and as-
sociate degrees. They also offer dual-credit 
academic, career, and technical courses at no 
cost to students, saving families in the Lower 
Grande Valley $28 million in tuition and re-
lated fees since 2017. 
In 2018, TSC earned the designation of 
fastest-growing community college in the state 
of Texas, and their graduation rate now out-
paces the Texas state average by more than 
three percent. The Board of Trustees, along 
with TSC President Jesus Roberto Rodriguez, 
Ph.D., continue to set goals to ensure the 
long-term viability of the institution with a focus 
on fostering student success, leading regional 
workforce development, enriching student ex-
periences, enhancing community connections, 
and investing in each other. 
Texas Southmost College prides itself on 
fostering a welcoming environment and a 
sense of belonging for all. Madam Speaker, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
TSC on 95 years of invaluable service to the 
Lower Rio Grande Valley. Through education, 
community outreach and the promotion of indi-
vidual success, Texas Southmost College con-
tinues to strengthen the state of Texas’ pros-
perity and talent.

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF WKDK RADIO 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
WKDK Radio and celebrate the success of 
James Coggins and his son Jimmie Coggins. 
WKDK opened its doors on October 26, 
1946. Three years later, James received an 
offer to manage the station. James bought 
WKDK in 1951, and the radio station has been 
a Coggins family-owned business ever since. 
James, also known as ‘‘Mr. C,’’ believed 
radio was supposed to serve the community, 
and that’s exactly what WKDK has been doing 
for the last 75 years. WKDK covers local, 
state, and national events each day and has 
kept the public informed on major events, 
such as the assassination of President John 
F. Kennedy, the tornado of 1984, the 9/11 at-
tacks, and the eclipse of 2017. The station 
also serves as a source of connection and en-
tertainment and reports on important commu-
nity initiatives, such as local election news, 
Coffee Hour, weather updates, and the an-
nouncement of anniversaries and birthdays. 
After the passing of Mr. C, his son Jimmie 
took over management and ownership of the 
radio station. In addition to continuing his fa-
ther’s success at WKDK, Jimmie has also kept 
his civic-minded and community-centered spirit 
alive. Each year, Jimmie takes time out of his 
schedule to train and mentor students inter-
ested in journalism and radio broadcasting. 
As testament to the station’s accomplish-
ments, WKDK has received numerous honors 
and recognitions, including the March of 
Dimes Award, the South Carolina National 
Guard Certificate of Appreciation, the Rotarian 
Radio Appreciation Award, the Red Cross Ap-
preciation Award, and an award from the 
Newberry County Board of Education for Out-
standing Contributions to Newbery County 
Public Schools. The success of WKDK would 
not be possible without the outstanding leader-
ship of James and Jimmie, who are also re-
cipients of numerous individual accolades. 
Both James and Jimmie have been honored 
by the Newberry Touchdown Club and have 
been recognized as the Rotarian of the Year 
for multiple years. In 2010, James was also 
awarded the Order of the Palmetto, the state 
of South Carolina’s highest civilian honor pre-
sented in recognition of a lifetime of extraor-
dinary achievement, service, and contributions 
on a national or statewide scale. 
On behalf of the 5th district of South Caro-
lina, I thank WKDK for serving as the voice of 
Newberry County for the last 75 years. I con-
gratulate them on their outstanding success, 
and I look forward to hearing about their future 
accomplishments.

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Carolyn 
Clayton who passed away Saturday, Sep-
tember 11 at the Baptist Memorial Hospital in 
New Albany. I join her family, friends, and 
loved ones in mourning her loss. 
Carolyn was born on February 14, 1941 to 
Marlin and Maggie Curtis Evans. She worked 
at the Lee County Chancery Clerk’s Office. 
She found joy in attending yard sales, gar-
dening, and spending time with family. 
Carolyn was the founder of the nonprofit or-
ganization, Survival Incorporated. The organi-
zation works to advocate for the victims of vio-
lent crimes across the state of Mississippi. 
She was awarded Victims Advocate of the 
Year. 
Carolyn was married for 58 years to her 
husband, Joe, who passed away two months 
prior. Left to cherish her memory are her sons, 
Brad and Rob; grandchildren, Nikki, Kattie, 
Jack and Carson. 
I am grateful for Mrs. Clayton’s lifetime of 
service to the state of Mississippi.

SUPPORT OF THE U.S. FLAG 
MARITIME FLEET 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, today I want 
to highlight the importance of the U.S. flag 
maritime fleet to our economic and national 
security. While only two percent of our coun-
try’s imports and exports move on U.S. ships, 
the U.S. shipping industry supports, over 
650,000 U.S. jobs, has over $150 billion in an-
nual U.S. economic impact, and plays a crit-
ical role in supporting our military’s ability to 
project power and meet wartime requirements. 
Shipping is the most energy efficient way to 
move cargo, and we heavily rely on the U.S. 
flag fleet for trade security, diplomatic and 
maritime strength, and our readiness to de-
fend and support American interests overseas. 
The U.S. has only 84 international deep sea 
trading vessels, but the rest of the world has 
over 50,000. China alone has nearly 7,000. 
The United States needs a robust U.S. flag 
maritime industry and a trained and qualified 
mariner workforce to support our surge sealift 
capabilities in responding to crises and military 
operations around the world when called 
upon. Further, the U.S. flag fleet routinely re-
sponds to disasters and emergencies, moves 
critical government and military cargo around 
the world, and carries American farm products 
in support of U.S. international development 
programs to help developing countries in 
need. 
The shipping industry is facing unprece-
dented challenges today, but one thing we 
know all too well is that a strong commercial 
maritime capability enhances our national se-
curity. The Maritime Security Program which 
has broad bipartisan support in Congress is 
the single most important program to assist 
U.S. flag ships in foreign trade and helps en-
sure that we retain this important military ca-
pacity. 
While the U.S. is the largest trading nation 
in the world based on exports and imports of 
goods and services, without strong sustained 
support, the U.S. flag fleet faces difficult chal-
lenges which have significant potential to neg-
atively impact America’s national security. I 
want to thank the U.S. flag fleet and the U.S. 
merchant mariners who work every day to 
support our military and our Nation.

HONORING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF 
GERALD 
E. 
TALBOT, 
MAINE’S 
FIRST BLACK LEGISLATOR 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor my constituent, Gerald E. Talbot, 
who is celebrating his 90th birthday this year 
and who I wish to recognize for his instru-
mental role in advancing civil and human 
rights in Maine and across the nation. 
After serving in the U.S. Army, Gerry Tal-
bot’s activism was sparked when he partici-
pated in voter registration drives and was 
among only a handful of Mainers at the his-
toric 1963 March on Washington, after which 
he became the founding president of the Port-
land, Maine, chapter of the NAACP. In that 
role, he helped pass the Maine Fair Housing 
Bill and the Maine Human Rights Act. As the 
state’s first African American legislator, Gerry 
fought for a state holiday honoring Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr; and championed issues not tra-
ditionally addressed at the time, ranging from 
gun control and protections for migrant work-
ers to fair housing and tribal sovereignty. In 
1977, he sponsored Maine’s first gay rights 
legislation. 
Throughout his life, Gerry Talbot has 
worked to educate people about the Black ex-
perience. As an avid collector of books, post-
ers, photographs, and other artifacts, as well 
as personal papers and records, he has 
helped document Black history in Maine and 
throughout the country. In 2006, he co-au-
thored Maine’s Visible Black History: The First 
Chronicle of its People. A sought-after speak-
er, Gerry generously shared access to his his-
torical memorabilia wherever he went, and in 
order to inform generations to come, he do-
nated it to the African American Collection of 
the Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity 
at the University of Southern Maine. 
In Maine, public service and a commitment 
to others is the backbone of our communities, 
and Gerry Talbot is a shining example of 
these important values and commitments. 
Schools and parks have been named in his 
honor, and honorary degrees have been 
awarded. Today I am privileged to recognize 
his (or Gerald E. Talbot’s) contributions to my 
state by entering his story into the official 
record of our great nation.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
MATTHEW WADE BUTE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Staff Ser-
geant Matthew Bute, a veteran and member of 
the Mississippi Rifles—the 155th Infantry Regi-
ment in the Mississippi National Guard. He 
passed away September 10, 2021 in his home 
in Gulfport, Mississippi. I join his family, 
friends, and loved ones in mourning his loss. 
Matthew grew up in DeKalb, Illinois and 
graduated from Long Beach High School in 
Mississippi. He was an outstanding student 
and athlete—a defensive outside linebacker 
on the football team. In his civilian life, Matt 
worked for Inland Dredging and was known for 
his hard work. In the Mississippi National 
Guard, he was a dedicated leader and a self-
less Soldier. He was a devoted friend and 
model of Army leadership. 
SSG Matthew Bute served as a Dismounted 
Infantry Squad Leader in 2nd Platoon, Com-
pany B, 1st Battalion, 155th Infantry Regiment, 
155th Armored Brigade Combat Team, Mis-
sissippi Army National Guard. He was respon-
sible for training a squad of infantry Soldiers. 
His military career began in 2012 and he has 
served in the Mississippi Guard for 9 years. 
He was promoted to the rank of Staff Ser-
geant in May of this year. He deployed under 
the command of my current Legislative Direc-
tor, Major Rodney Hall Jr., in support of Oper-
ation Spartan Shield and served in Kuwait and 
Iraq. Most recently, SSG Bute volunteered to 
protect our Nation’s Capital during Operation 
Civil Unrest in Washington, D.C. 
Left to cherish his memory are his older 
brother Brad and his nieces, Brooklyn and 
Rainee. He is preceded in death by his moth-
er, Jennifer Holmes, and younger brother, Na-
than Thumm. 
SSG Matthew Bute was a brave Soldier, a 
remarkable leader, and an outstanding friend 
to many. I am grateful for his service to our 
state and nation.

PROVIDING 
URGENT 
MATERNAL 
PROTECTIONS 
FOR 
NURSING 
MOTHERS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 22, 2021 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Providing Ur-
gent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers 
Act—known as the PUMP Act. 
All too often, the workplace is not an equal 
place for women as they face unequal pay for 
equal work and other forms of gender-based 
discrimination. Mothers face even greater bar-
riers. 
Mothers who choose to breastfeed should 
not be forced to choose between returning to 
work and breastfeeding. And they certainly 
should never have to pump in a place that is 
not safe, private, or comfortable. 
The PUMP Act takes the long-overdue step 
of ensuring that every employee who chooses 
to breastfeed will have the time and a des-
ignated, private space to pump without pen-
alty. 
Nine million American workers will be cov-
ered by these new protections, ending unfair, 
discriminatory practices and allowing more 
mothers and infants to receive the scientifically 
proven health and nutritional benefits of 
breastfeeding. 
I want to thank Chairwoman MALONEY for 
her leadership on this important, bipartisan bill 
to support working mothers, and her historic 
leadership on supporting working women and 
families. 
I am proud to support this vital legislation, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to support it 
as well.

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mr. Andrew Carter who recently celebrated his 
100th birthday. He is a member of the great-
est generation, and I am very proud to have 
men like Mr. Carter representing the state of

Mr. Carter is a native of Tippah county. He 
joined the U.S. Navy on May 17, 1944. He 
loves to tell stories of his time aboard the SS 
Felipe De Nerve, a French liner used to trans-
port troops and supplies during heavy fighting. 
He survived and returned home to Mississippi. 
In December of 1946, Mr. Carter married 
Naomi Street. The couple had six children to-
gether. 
Mr. Carter currently resides in Ripley. He 
enjoys trips to the local coffee shop to spend 
time with his friends, mowing the lawn, and

HONORING KAY VANAGS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, October 25, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Kay Vanags as Iowan of the week. Kay 
has provided valuable services to constituents 
in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District for over 
20 years through her work as LifeLong Links 
Director at Aging Resources of Central Iowa. 
The organization provides services to individ-
uals in Dallas, Madison, Warren, and Polk 
counties in our district, as well as Boone, 
Story, Jasper, and Marion counties in Iowa. 
Kay’s work has had a widespread impact on 
Iowa’s senior community and their family care-
takers. 
Kay has a background in teaching, but she 
was led to a career in social service following 
her experience as a caretaker for in-laws who 
had memory and physical issues requiring at-
tentive care. Her experience motivated her to 
advocate for family caregivers and the elderly 
who are experiencing similar situations. 
Kay’s service to family caregivers ensures 
that they have the information and resources 
they need to properly care for their loved 
ones. She advises and connects folks with 
housing, transportation, and health insurance 
issues—which are often difficult areas for peo-
ple to navigate on their own without the institu-
tional knowledge Kay can share. Kay also pro-
vides counseling, as the change in roles and 
relationships between a caregiver and their 
loved ones often provides a unique challenge 
for families to navigate. Based on her own ex-
perience as well as additional training, Kay 
also provides education to caregivers about 
care strategies—particularly to those care-
givers who have loved ones with memory 
issues—and those who struggle with the 
stresses of work/life balance. 
Kay enjoys advocating for folks as they 
navigate some of the most difficult and per-
sonal situations and having the opportunity to 
share information and guidance for those in 
need. Aging Resources of Central Iowa re-
ceives approximately 1,000 calls per month, 
and about half of those are from family care-
givers. Kay continues to engage with commu-
nity health provider groups, which build rela-
tionships and important partnerships that ben-
efit the entire community. Particularly through-
out the COVID pandemic, as calls increased, 
Kay and her team successfully shifted their 
operations so they could continue to provide 
direct assistance to those in need. It is impor-
tant to highlight Kay and the team at Aging 
Resources of Central Iowa for their continued 
service to our district and the people of Iowa. 
I am proud to honor Kay Vanags as Iowan 
of the Week.
