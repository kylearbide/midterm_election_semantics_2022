Senate 
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our hope for the years 
to come, we come to You with a tan-
gled mass of motives, seeking, through 
prayer, to make sense of life. 
Guide our lawmakers as they seek to 
unravel the good from the bad, the 
sweet from the bitter, and the harmony 
from the discord. Teach them how to 
seek and find You during this chal-
lenging season of our national life. 
Lord, give them calm strength and 
patient wisdom to do what is best for 
our Nation and world. Vanquish the 
darkness through the power of Your ce-
lestial brightness. Turn Your face to-
ward us, and show us Your glory. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO RAJA CHARI 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
speak about Iowans who are well noted 
for things wherever they live in Iowa, 
but I am particularly proud to speak 
about a person from Cedar Falls, IA, a 
town I know well because I have lived 
my entire 87 years on a farm 8 miles 
from Cedar Falls. 
This week, NASA announced that 
Raja Chari from Cedar Falls, IA, has 
been selected for a team of astronauts 
that will go to the Moon as part of the 
Artemis mission. 
The Artemis mission will land astro-
nauts on the Moon in the year 2024, 
with the goal of establishing a long- 
term presence. Raja Chari will be a 
part of this effort that will ensure 
America’s continued leadership and 
preeminence in space. 
I congratulate Raja on his accom-
plishments and wish him and all the 
astronauts who are part of this mission 
great success. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate needs to pass a stopgap funding 
measure today to prevent a lapse while 
the bipartisan, bicameral efforts close 
in on a full-year funding bill, and we 
need to advance what will be the 60th 
annual Defense authorization bill. 
This year’s NDAA will cement the 
historic steps that Congress and the 
Trump administration have taken over 
the past 4 years to rebuild and reequip 
a 21st century fighting force. It directs 
investments in technologies to main-
tain our strategic edge. It makes crit-
ical supply chains more secure and the 
Pentagon more accountable. And in the 
face of threats ranging from adver-
saries to this pandemic, it expands ef-
forts to keep our men and women in 
uniform safe. 
I 
remain 
hopeful 
that 
essential 
progress on these items will continue. 
We ought to pass a full-year funding 
measure, and I hope our committees in 
the Senate and the House can complete 
their work and deliver legislation next 
week. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
that said, we know the American peo-
ple’s eyes are trained on the Capitol for 
another reason as well. Struggling fam-
ilies, exhausted health workers, and 
anxious small business owners are 
waiting—waiting—for the Senate to do 
what I have tried to accomplish over 
and over for months: Pass a signifi-
cant, targeted COVID-relief bill built 
on all the areas where bipartisan con-
sensus already exists. 
We know what that common ground 
looks like: a new second round of the 
Paycheck Protection Program so hard- 
hit small businesses can keep paying 
their people, the necessary investments 
in distribution to get lifesaving vac-
cines out to our people, and an exten-
sion of some unemployment programs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7434 
December 11, 2020 
that will otherwise expire in just a 
matter of days. 
Republicans have been crystal clear 
about 
the 
sort 
of 
urgent 
and 
unobjectionable relief we are ready to 
deliver. I even offered to temporarily 
set aside one of our side’s major re-
quests, 
commonsense 
legal 
protec-
tions—by the way, 6,500 lawsuits have 
already been filed—to set aside com-
monsense legal protections to aid the 
reopening if Democrats drop their own 
controversial 
outstanding 
demands. 
But day after day, the Democratic 
leader finds new reasons not to com-
promise, new ways to avoid taking yes 
for an answer. 
In what universe should emergency 
aid for small businesses be contin-
gent—contingent—on massive bailouts 
for State governments with no linkage 
to actual needs? Democrats are acting 
like it is more important to supply the 
Governor of California with a special 
slush fund than to help restaurant 
workers in California keep their jobs. 
Oh, and, by the way, these demands for 
State and local government giveaways 
are blocking urgent aid for struggling 
families at a time when many States’ 
tax revenues have largely gone up—up. 
In November, California admitted 
their tax revenue for this fiscal year 
was running about 19 percent ahead of 
what they had predicted. The Governor 
said earlier this week that he foresees 
a tax windfall—windfall—not a horrible 
budget crunch, but a windfall of nearly 
$16 billion. 
State lawmakers are preparing to 
argue over where to put all this unex-
pected tax money. According to the 
L.A. Times, they are considering top-
ping up the State’s cash reserves. They 
aren’t just getting by; they are putting 
more money away. 
Here is another headline from a few 
days back—a State the occupant of the 
Chair is familiar with—‘‘Massachusetts 
tax revenue[s] eclipsed total for last 
November despite COVID-driven reces-
sion.’’ This is another State where rev-
enues are actually up over last year. 
Whatever future problems Democrats 
may think they see around the corner, 
it is preposterous to claim that these 
blue States that are bragging about 
their tax windfalls must receive an-
other Federal handout right this in-
stant, before working families can get 
a penny more. 
Small businesses need saving right 
now. Unemployed people need relief ex-
tended right now. Vaccine distribution 
networks need funding right now. None 
of that should be held hostage over 
intergovernmental bailouts for States 
that are currently raking in revenue 
faster than they can spend it. 
Yet the Speaker and the Democratic 
leader have persuaded their entire con-
ference that nothing should pass unless 
the Governors of California and New 
York get to cut the line and jump in 
front of millions of Americans who are 
trying to figure out how to pay their 
bills each and every month. 
Then there is Democrats’ apparently 
strong opposition to enacting any kind 
of legal protections to aid the reopen-
ing. Targeted, temporary liability re-
forms are a common feature of na-
tional emergencies or strange events, 
such as the Y2K mess and September 
11. This is not some new concoction; it 
is what Congress has done in the past. 
But this time, Democrats say the 
trial lawyers’ interests must come 
first. They are threatening to kill any 
compromise whatsoever unless Con-
gress leaves small businesses, univer-
sities, and healthcare workers as sit-
ting ducks—sitting ducks—for frivo-
lous lawsuits. 
My colleagues across the aisle want 
to present this stance as some bold cru-
sade against evil corporations? Well, 
for one thing, it is the big corporations 
who can afford the massive legal de-
partments. Lawsuits are not exactly 
alien from the perspective of the For-
tune 100. 
No, it is small business advocates 
who have been pleading with Congress 
to pass legal protection since last May. 
It has been college presidents and high-
er education experts who have sounded 
this alarm the whole time. About 7 in 
10 small business owners said a second 
pandemic of lawsuits was a major con-
cern. University administrators told us 
liability is ‘‘a national problem requir-
ing a national solution’’ that could 
produce ‘‘a chilling effect’’ on Amer-
ican education if not addressed. But 
Democrats are threatening to walk 
away altogether if Republicans try to 
give these institutions what they need. 
So look, a legislator’s true position 
lies in what they do, not what they 
say. What Republicans have done since 
July is make one attempt after an-
other to generate a consensus package 
that can actually be signed into law. 
What Senate Democrats have done is 
recite an endless—endless—chain of 
changing stories about why nothing 
that anyone proposes is any good. If 
my friends actually oppose PPP fund-
ing, vaccine distribution money, or ex-
tending some expiring unemployment 
aid, let’s hear why. But if they do not 
oppose these things, let’s get them out 
the door. 
I have proposed setting aside both li-
ability protections and State and local 
bailouts and making law where we can 
agree. Democrats have thus far de-
clined, but at the same time, they are 
blocking an agreement on these issues. 
So unless something changes, they will 
get to explain to a restaurant owner 
that Democrats didn’t let her get a sec-
ond PPP loan to save her business be-
cause her Governor needed a special 
slush fund or explain to a laid-off work-
er that his relief program may expire 
completely because Democrats didn’t 
feel it was urgent or explain to an older 
couple, who have hunkered down and 
survived this long year, that their vac-
cines will arrive later than necessary 
because Democrats wouldn’t let us 
fund distribution. 
If my Democratic friends don’t want 
to explain these inexplicable things, 
then they need to let us act now.

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PAUL). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my 
understanding that the minority leader 
was going to be here, but we are get-
ting very close to the time we actually 
cast our vote at 10:30—just 20 more 
minutes. In the event that the minor-
ity leader comes, I will dispense with 
my remarks and defer to him. 
It is my honor to present the 60th an-
nual National Defense Authorization 
Act. For 59 straight years—you can’t 
say this about any other piece of legis-
lation, all year or anytime, except the 
Defense authorization bill—we have 
passed this bill. We have passed this 
bill every year for 59 years, and this 
will be 60 years, and I anticipate that 
we will pass it now. 
There 
isn’t 
much 
that 
happens 
around the Capitol that has a track 
record like that. Maybe I am biased, 
and maybe in some people’s minds I am 
wrong, but I think this is the most im-
portant bill of the year. I really believe 
that. I have believed that since 1987, 
and this is something that we have to 
do. 
There is an old document nobody 
reads anymore called the Constitution. 
In there it tells us what we need to be 
doing, and that is exactly what we are 
going to be doing today: providing for 
our defense. 
So it is simple what this bill does. It 
makes our country more secure. It sup-
ports our troops who defend it. 
Right now this couldn’t be more im-
portant. As President Trump’s national 
defense strategy tells us, we are up 
against the most serious threats we 
have seen maybe forever. This is com-
ing from China and Russia, these coun-
tries who stand against everything 
America stands for. 
It bothers me that we went through 
the last 5 years of the Obama adminis-
tration—that would have been from 
2010 through 2015—where he criticized 
the military. We didn’t have to have 
the military, he felt. 
At this time, I would suspend with 
my remarks. 
Mr. SCHUMER. You keep going for 2 
minutes. I will let you know. 
Mr. INHOFE. Let me know, and I will 
be glad to suspend. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. 
Mr. INHOFE. Anyway, during that 
time, during the Obama administra-
tion, during those 5 years, he reduced 
the funding for the military by 25 per-
cent. Now, this has not happened, in 
my memory. It hasn’t happened since 
World War II that we have gone 
through a 5-year period of doing that. 
And the tragedy is that during that 
same time, China was increasing theirs 
by 83 percent. Stop and think about 
that—83 
percent—when 
you 
realize 
that we were reducing our expenditures 
by 25 percent while they are increasing 
theirs by 83 percent. Now, that is seri-
ous enough, and that is something that 
is very much a concern to many of us. 
So we know that they were increas-
ing, we were decreasing, and, as a re-
sult, things happened. There are some 
things that they did—hypersonics, for 
example. That is one of the most re-
cent exercises that is out there. They 
are actually, today, as we speak—they 
are ahead of us. Both China and Russia 
are ahead of the United States of 
America in hypersonics and that type 
of technology that is out there. 
This President came along—and I 
know there is a lot of controversy 
about this bill. I know that the Presi-
dent wanted to have something in 
there that was having to do with lan-
guage that had nothing to do with the 
military. I agree wholeheartedly with 
him, but you can’t. You have got to 
have a defense authorization bill. Our 
kids in the field demand it. 
With the NDAA, we are imple-
menting the policies and programs to 
make sure that this doesn’t happen, to 
ensure that America is able to prevent 
and, if necessary, win wars of today 
and tomorrow. 
At this point, I would like to defer to 
the minority leader, and I do ask unan-
imous consent that at the conclusion 
of his remarks that I be recognized to 
make my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
want to thank the Senator from Okla-
homa for, as usual, his courtesy, which 
I very much appreciate. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
CARES Act passed the Senate on 
March 27, 2020. It was a rare moment in 
bipartisanship—a legislative triumph 
that saved our country from disaster in 
the very early days of the pandemic. As 
you know, I sat and negotiated a great 
deal of that with Secretary of State 
Mnuchin. And we all agreed it did a lot 
of good—a lot of good. But, unfortu-
nately, for the past 259 days, as the 
virus continued to spread—when we did 
the CARES Act, we thought, well, 
maybe COVID will be over by the sum-
mer. Everyone thought that, but obvi-
ously it wasn’t. And so the virus has 
continued to spread. Thousands of 
small businesses have closed their 
doors for good. Tens of millions of 
Americans lost their jobs and liveli-
hoods. As American families waited in 
21st century bread lines, cars snaking 
for miles down American highways; as 
tens of millions of Americans fell be-
hind on the rent and the mortgage and 
face eviction; as 15 million Americans 
got sick; and as 292,001 Americans died, 
the Senate Republican majority, led by 
the majority leader, made sure the 
Senate could not do anything of sig-
nificance to help the American people. 
May, June, July, August—pause; we 
don’t need to do anything, said the 
leader. Let’s wait and see what hap-
pens. Democrats didn’t say that. The 
leader did. Waited and waited and wait-
ed. Now it is December, and we still, 
because of the leader’s intransigence, 
have nothing of significance to help the 
American people during the worst eco-
nomic crisis in 75 years and the great-
est public health crisis in a century. 
Why? Why can’t we get together? 
Why can’t there be the bipartisanship 
that Americans search for and yearn 
for? At a time of such great crisis, 
there is one reason why America’s two 
major parties have not gotten together 
during the time of acute national 
emergency, and that is because the Re-
publican leader has demanded a par-
tisan poison pill—a sweeping corporate 
liability shield—be included in any leg-
islation. Otherwise, he won’t let it 
pass. 
It sounds like an exaggeration, but 
that is what the leader has said. ‘‘We’re 
not negotiating over liability protec-
tion,’’ the leader said, on July 28. 
I’ll be responsible for putting the final 
agreement on the floor. And as I said, it will 
have liability protection in it. We’re not ne-
gotiating with the Democrats over that. 
That is the fact. That is the history. 
There is not equality here. 
Finally, yesterday, as the bipartisan 
group of Senators and House Members 
were closing in on a final agreement, 
what happened? Yesterday, the Repub-
lican leader’s team told the other con-
gressional leaders that the bipartisan 
group would be unable to satisfy Sen-
ate 
Republicans. 
Why? 
Because 
it 
might not grant the exact sweeping li-
ability protections for corporations 
that Leader MCCONNELL has demanded. 
It is an unconscionable position. No re-
lief for the American people unless cor-
porations receive blanket immunity 
from lawsuits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7436 
December 11, 2020 
That particular poison pill that has 
foiled bipartisan agreement for more 
than 8 months is the nub of the prob-
lem. If we could just get past that, if 
the Republican leader would only back 
off maximalist demands on corporate 
immunity, we could get something 
done. I mean it. We could actually get 
something done. 
Now, I know the Republican leader 
will say: Wait a minute, Democrats 
have partisan demands of their own, 
like providing assistance to save State 
and local services. But to equate State 
and local aid—money for policemen 
and firefighters, busdrivers, sanitation 
workers—to complete corporate immu-
nity is a false equivalence. We know 
the two policies are not equivalent. 
First of all, there is broad bipartisan 
support for State and local aid. It is 
not a Democratic demand. Many Re-
publicans support it too. There are bi-
partisan bills on the floor of the Senate 
demanding $500 billion in aid for the 
States. There are Governors—Demo-
crats and Republicans—sending letters 
to all of us saying we need money; we 
need help. But the leader’s corporate 
immunity provision doesn’t have the 
support of a Democrat. Not a single 
person voted for it. It is expressly par-
tisan. There is not equivalence. 
I know the media likes to say, on the 
one hand, on the other. There is not 
equivalence here. One is helping people 
who desperately need help. The other is 
a partisan demand that has been 
around for a long time that simply 
does not get bipartisan support. 
State and local aid is a solution to a 
real and urgent problem. Corporate im-
munity from lawsuits is not. They are 
not equivalent. State and local budgets 
are deeply in the red. Since the begin-
ning of the pandemic, State and mu-
nicipalities have laid off 1.3 million 
public employees—firefighters, police, 
first responders, teachers. We are talk-
ing about jobs—jobs—in red States as 
well as blue States. 
The leader likes to cite one statistic 
about tax revenue in one blue State to 
argue that no State—no State deserves 
Federal aid, not Wyoming or Alaska, 
North Dakota, that have each seen 
sharp declines in tax revenue; not Flor-
ida or Nevada or Louisiana, that de-
pend on tourism and face revenue de-
clines of 10 percent or more. 
State and local aid is a real and ur-
gent problem. It is not abstract. It is 
people, and it is workers. PPP that 
helps small businesses—one of its main 
rationales, an important one, some-
thing I agree with—prevents workers 
who work for small businesses from 
being laid off. What is the difference 
between a worker being laid off by a 
small business because they don’t have 
funding or a worker being laid off from 
a State and local government because 
they don’t have funding? There is no 
difference. There is no difference. 
The leader’s corporate immunity pro-
vision, on the other hand, is a solution, 
ideological, in search of a problem. Al-
most a year into this pandemic—15 
million 
Americans 
infected, 
290,000 
lives lost to COVID–19—there have 
been only 23 personal injury suits from 
exposure to the coronavirus—23 in the 
entire country, over the entire year. 
And that is why Senate Republicans 
can’t reach a bipartisan agreement to 
help the unemployed, feed the hungry, 
fund a vaccine, or support our schools? 
Corporations that want protection 
from a few dozen lawsuits is equivalent 
to millions of workers from State and 
local governments being laid off? Give 
me a break. Again, there are a few 
States that don’t need the help, but 
many more States do—many more. 
This is mind-boggling. The Repub-
lican leadership is blocking a solution 
for the entire country until they get a 
favor for corporations who don’t even 
need it. The American people, all of us, 
are sick of this ridiculous gamesman-
ship by the majority leader. 
We need to come together. We need 
to get something done. The American 
people deserve an outcome. It is not 
going to happen if the Republican ma-
jority insists on getting 100 percent of 
its partisan demands. 
I yield the floor. 
I, once again, thank the Senator 
from Oklahoma for his courtesy.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of 
all, I did want to get some final com-
ments. I mentioned a minute ago and, 
of course, it is the right of the lead-
ers—Democratic and Republican lead-
ers—to have the first time. It is fine 
with me, but I just want to make one 
comment about it. 
The minority leader was talking 
about what is going on right now and 
who would be favored and all that. I 
think one of the things we don’t talk 
about, we should talk about. You 
know, I know the media doesn’t like 
our President, and a lot of things he 
has done he didn’t get credit for it. 
One of the major things—and this is 
all going to come out—unfortunately, 
this didn’t come out before the elec-
tion, but it should have because there 
is—what do they call that? Warp speed? 
Is that right? Yes, this Operation Warp 
Speed. This was back in June. The 
President came out with this. General 
Perna was put in charge of it. 
I wasn’t prepared to talk about this, 
but I think it is important right now 
that we do because I want to follow up 
with what the minority leader talked 
about because everyone is concerned 
about it. They are all concerned about 
the coronavirus and those things. This 
has never happened in this country be-
fore. But it has happened. It had noth-
ing to do with this administration. 
They did a great job. And to dem-
onstrate what a great job they did, 
they had the Operation Warp Speed— 
this was back in June of this year—and 
they put General Perna in charge of it. 
I chair the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. They wanted us to have a 
hearing on this. I was so excited. No 
one could have sat through that hear-
ing last June without coming to the 
conclusion that this thing is going to 
be behind us. We are winning this 
thing. And you come to the conclusion 
that we are going to have the virus 
under control. We are going to have 
this system. We all know that is hap-
pening today, right now, as we are 
speaking. We have several companies— 
five companies—who have come so 
close, and they are now distributing 
the necessary equipment so that people 
become immune to this thing. That is 
happening right now. 
It happens that even though this was 
last June—it was last June that we had 
the hearing in my committee. Every-
thing that they predicted, that General 
Perna predicted at that time, is hap-
pening. They said by December we 
would have it. Well, here it is, Decem-
ber, and we have got it. And then we 
said it is going to take about 3 months 
to be able to make the distribution 
around the country. And that time is 
coming up. It is getting close to that 
time, and that is going to happen. I 
mean, we are looking right now at 
April as the time that we have got this 
thing defeated. And right now, this ad-
ministration—I want to give them 
credit for this. They have got this dis-
tribution system set up so it is going 
to be going around the country, and 
this thing is going to come to an end. 
I have to tell you that the President 
is responsible for putting this in place, 
and it is, right now, on schedule. 
I don’t want to take a lot of time. I 
see that Senator REED has come in. 
Senator JACK
REED
is the ranking 
member on the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. Let me just tell you, I 
can’t think of anyone I would rather 
have as a partner in putting together 
the Defense authorization 
bill—the 
most important bill of all year—than 
Senator JACK REED. He has been there 
by my side, with me, working together. 
We had a Big 4 meeting. We always 
end up with a Big 4 meeting. To tell 
you what that is, that is the ranking 
Democrat and Republican in the House, 
the Democrat and Republican in the 
Senate; and the four of us get together 
and decide what are we going do, what 
is this going to look like. And then we 
pass it. We passed this bill. It is a good 
bill. It is one that we have the oppor-
tunity to vote on today, the most im-
portant bill of the year. And if voting 
against it, you have to stop and think 
about those kids who are out there in 
harm’s way and the threats that they 
are facing on a regular basis. This is a 
problem. This is a serious thing that is 
out there. I can’t imagine wanting to 
have to face these people in the field, 
in harm’s way, and say: Well, we didn’t 
pass the Defense authorization bill. 
We are going to pass it. These kids 
are going to get the right treatment 
that they need. They are going to get 
the resources they need. I did mention 
just a few minutes ago about the pre-
vious administration. I don’t want peo-
ple to misunderstand what I am saying.

I am not saying this critically of the 
Obama administration. I am saying he 
didn’t have the same priorities that 
many of us have. His top priority was 
not defending America, in spite of what 
the Constitution tells us what should 
be the top priority. And so we went 
through that time with—as I men-
tioned, between the years of 2010 and 
2015, 5 years, reduced the funding for 
the military by 25 percent. At the same 
time, China was increasing their fund-
ing for their military by 83 percent. 
This is what we looked at, and that is 
what our President was faced with. And 
that is why—I don’t know who is ill-ad-
vising the President to be concerned 
about an issue that has nothing to do 
with the military. And I know that the 
President has been the strongest—I 
don’t know if there has ever been a 
President who has been a stronger sup-
porter of our military and our kids in 
harm’s way than President Trump. I 
am just looking at this now, and I am 
thinking, we are now 1 minute away 
from passing a bill that is the most sig-
nificant bill. 
At this time, I ask if the minority 
would like to make any comments at 
all because I will tell you right now, I 
mentioned the names of all the people 
who worked on this bill for the last 
year, and side by side have been Sen-
ator JACK REED and I in the leadership 
of this bill. 
It is going to be a reality. 
I want to thank you and give you an 
opportunity to get a last word in here 
because we are going to vote on this in

brief if I am recognized, Mr. President.

2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, col-
leagues, we are in the middle of a 
whole bunch of really important de-
bates right now about the National De-
fense Authorization Act, trying to 
avoid a shutdown by the end of the day, 
and, of course, trying to find a path 
forward to authorize funding to con-
tinue to combat this pandemic. 
But it is worth noting today that an 
effort to overturn the 2020 election con-
tinues and, in many ways, is picking up 
steam, and we need to talk about the 
consequences for the Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7438 
December 11, 2020 
Democracies 
are 
really 
fragile 
things. Ours only continues because we 
make choices so that it can remain. 
Our government really isn’t a piece of 
paper upon which the Constitution is 
written. Our government—where vot-
ers, citizens, not kings or monarchs or 
oligarchs, decide who governs—is made 
possible by a series of decisions that we 
make every single day to put the rule 
of law ahead of our own political power 
or the position of our political party. 
That is the history of America—our de-
cision that democracy comes first, not 
the perpetuation of our own political 
power. 
Right now, the most serious attempt 
to overthrow our democracy in the his-
tory of this country is underway. Those 
who are pushing to make Donald 
Trump President for a second term, no 
matter the outcome of the election, are 
engaged in a treachery against their 
Nation. 
You cannot, at the same time, love 
America and hate democracy. But as 
we speak, a whole lot of flag-waving 
Republicans are nakedly trying to in-
validate millions of legal votes because 
that is the only way they can make 
Donald Trump President again. 
It is the only way they can make 
Donald Trump President again because 
he didn’t win. Our democracy, the citi-
zens of this country, chose Joe Biden 
to be President of the United States. 
He won the popular vote in a landslide, 
and he won the electoral college by a 
substantial margin. 
But now, Republicans have decided— 
not all Republicans—but far too many 
have decided that if democracy can’t 
keep Trump in power, then democracy 
ceases to have any real purpose be-
cause, to Republicans who are sup-
porting these continued efforts to in-
validate the election, their loyalty is 
to Donald Trump, not to the Nation or 
our system of government. Their No. 1 
goal is to keep Trump in power, and if 
that means throwing out the election 
and turning America into something 
other than a democracy in which the 
voters get to choose their leaders, then 
so be it. 
Here is the latest. This lawsuit is 
supported by 106 House Republicans. 
That is more than half of the Repub-
licans who serve in the House of Rep-
resentatives. It is supported, appar-
ently, by many Senate Republicans as 
well. This lawsuit is an attempt to 
overthrow democracy. 
Now, you can laugh at it; you can 
scoff at it; you can suggest that it has 
no chance to prevail if it reaches the 
nine Supreme Court Justices. But let’s 
be clear about what it argues, and let’s 
be clear about the consequences for so 
many elected officials at the highest 
level of American Government sup-
porting this lawsuit. 
What it argues is that the votes in 
four 
States—Pennsylvania, 
Georgia, 
Wisconsin, and Michigan—should be 
thrown out because Trump didn’t win. 
It asks for the State legislatures, con-
trolled by Republicans, to appoint elec-
tors instead. Now, there are a bunch of 
vague, unsourced claims about voter 
fraud in this lawsuit, but there is not a 
shred of evidence for these claims. All 
of the individual lawsuits trying to al-
lege voter fraud, trying to create con-
tests about how laws were modified re-
garding voting in these States, have all 
lost. 
Importantly, the lawsuit doesn’t ask 
for another canvass or another count; 
it just asks for the votes in these 
States to be disregarded and for Repub-
lican politicians in these States to 
make the choice instead. 
Already in Pennsylvania, the State 
legislature’s Republican leadership has 
expressed support for appointing elec-
tors who would choose Donald Trump. 
Let me say that again. This lawsuit 
says that in Pennsylvania, the State 
legislature should choose the electors, 
not the people. And in Pennsylvania, 
the leadership of the Republican Party 
in the legislature has expressed support 
for appointing electors who will choose 
Donald Trump instead of Joe Biden de-
spite the fact that Joe Biden won the 
State of Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes— 
80,000 votes. This isn’t 500 votes, like 
Florida in 2000—80,000 votes. 
The request of this lawsuit is clear: 
Throw out the votes in these four 
States that Joe Biden won and just 
give the election to Donald Trump in-
stead. 
Some of my Republican Senate col-
leagues sent out pretty mealy-mouthed 
statements 
supporting 
the 
general 
right to count every legal vote and to 
contest illegal votes, but that is not 
what this lawsuit is about. It just asks 
for the whole vote to be thrown out. It 
asks for every vote in these States to 
be disregarded. 
Other 
Republicans 
who 
haven’t 
signed on to this suit suggest that it 
won’t succeed in the Supreme Court; it 
is a sideshow, so why really care? Well, 
we have to care. The majority of Re-
publican Members of Congress believe 
that Donald Trump should be named 
President again despite the fact that 
he lost and lost by a lot. It wasn’t close 
in the popular vote or in the electoral 
college. We should care because this at-
tempt to overthrow democracy won’t 
be successful this time—Joe Biden is 
going to be President—but it plainly 
shows us the direction that the Repub-
lican Party is heading, and they con-
trol governments in a lot of really im-
portant States and jurisdictions. 
The majority of Republicans in the 
House of Representatives apparently 
believe that if a Democrat wins an 
election, it is illegitimate by defini-
tion. There is no evidence of fraud or 
stolen votes or vote-rigging in the 2020 
election. You can be mad about the 
fact that States allow for mail-in vot-
ing; but Republican and Democratic 
States allow for it. You can be angry 
that the majority of those votes this 
year were cast in favor of Joe Biden in 
many of these States, but in previous 
years, the majority of mail-in votes 
had been favoring Republicans. 
But no matter the lack of evidence 
about voter fraud, Republicans, includ-
ing the President, have just come to 
the conclusion that Democrats must 
have cheated because Democrats are 
evil, and lots of people show up to Don-
ald Trump rallies. You know, there is 
just no way that all of these people 
could have voted for Joe Biden because 
FOX News and Newsmax and RT—they 
tell us that Trump is just so popular. 
This mindset won’t win out this 
time. Joe Biden is going to be Presi-
dent. But what about next time? What 
if the next Presidential election is clos-
er? What if 2024 comes down to just one 
State? It is a lot easier to steal one 
State. What if these radical anti-Demo-
crats get control of more secretary of 
state offices or election boards and 
there is a close race for Governor in 
2022 or the U.S. Senate, and these same 
people who support the Texas lawsuit 
decide again that there is no way a 
Democrat could have won our State, 
and so by definition it has to be fraudu-
lent, despite the lack of evidence, so 
let’s just throw out the result and 
choose a Republican? 
I know this kind of sounds far-
fetched, but this is exactly what this 
lawsuit is asking for. It is asking for 
the vote to be thrown out in four 
States and Donald Trump to be named 
President regardless of the fact that he 
lost, with no evidence of any voter 
fraud or illegal behavior. 
There is a majority of the U.S. House 
of Representatives Republican caucus 
who supports this, so it stands to rea-
son that this won’t all of a sudden stop 
being their position 2 years from now 
and 4 years from now. If that happens 
and the voters’ will is thrown out—not 
just in a Presidential election but in a 
Governor’s race or a U.S. Senate race 
or a congressional race—then our coun-
try will no longer be a democracy. If 
that happens, the American experi-
ment will be done. It will be over. 
That is why this moment is so fright-
ening, no matter the fact that it is not 
going to be successful in an attempt to 
keep Donald Trump barricaded in the 
White House. That is why more Repub-
licans than just a handful in this coun-
try need to be standing up to this law-
suit and this claim that the vote 
should be thrown out, because you 
have a majority of Republicans in this 
country who believe that Joe Biden 
won the election fraudulently when 
there is no evidence that that hap-
pened. That belief, as it festers and it 
grows—this idea that if Democrats win, 
it has to be because of fraud—it does 
eventually lead to the voters’ will 
being overturned, and that will be the 
end of American democracy. 
Don’t just assume that this system is 
going to be around for another 240 
years. It is a miracle that we have held 
this together thus far. It is just a series 
of choices that we make. The Constitu-
tion itself is not strong enough, is not 
durable enough without all of us mak-
ing a decision that even if we lose an 
election, even if that means that tem-
porarily our political power is lessened,

that we accept the result because what 
matters most in this country is what 
the voters choose, not how it affects 
us. 
It is not enough to just punt here and 
say ‘‘Ah, the President has a right to 
go to court; let’s just see what hap-
pens’’ because when the overthrow of 
democracy is beginning and you are 
sitting on the sidelines, you are a col-
laborator. And there are way too many 
high-profile Republicans who march 
around the world giving speeches about 
the importance of protecting democ-
racy who are awfully silent when the 
attempted overthrow is happening in 
their own country. Nobody can stay si-
lent right now. 
There are a lot of other important 
things happening in the Senate today. 
I am engaged in those as well. It is 
true, this effort to overthrow the 2020 
election is not going to bear fruit, and 
so it is tempting to just work on the 
other things and to ignore this lawsuit 
and these attempts because this time, 
it won’t be successful. But all of this 
effort, supported by so many main-
stream Republicans, is setting a prece-
dent and is creating conditions that 
could easily overthrow the next elec-
tion. If the Republican Party just al-
lows for this assault on the 2020 elec-
tion to continue, no matter whether it 
ultimately is successful, then by 2022 
or 2024, I am telling you, it might be 
too late to save our democracy. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since 
last fall, right after the new year, our 
country, like the rest of the planet, be-
came embroiled in a pandemic, sending 
fear, shock, illness, and fatalities. As 
we tried to respond, we were forced to 
make hard decisions—I am talking 
about a collective ‘‘we’’—in terms of 
economic activity, children going to 
school, businesses staying open. 
And many businesses simply could 
not, and many of the workers who 
worked at those locations simply were 
out of luck. You can imagine the anx-
iety and the fear of many Americans 
who, through no fault of their own, 
found themselves fearful of the virus 
and the consequences associated with 
it, fearful for the possibility that their 
loved ones—let’s say, a parent or 
grandparent who is especially vulner-
able because of their age or somebody 
because of their underlying chronic 
health conditions—were more likely to 
be a fatality, to lose their life, if they 
were infected with the virus. 
This is something we haven’t experi-
enced perhaps in the last 100 years, 
since the great flu pandemic at the 
turn of the last century. 
Congress 
responded 
the 
best 
we 
could. We knew we had to act quickly, 
and we knew we had to act in a big 
way. I am proud of the fact that, in the 
face of this pandemic, Congress came 
together, setting aside partisan agen-
das, and we passed four pieces of legis-
lation to address, first of all, the public 
health crisis but, secondly, the eco-
nomic fallout associated with mitiga-
tion efforts. In other words, we did 
what Americans always do in a time of 
crisis: We pulled together. 
I am proud of what we were able to 
accomplish. But at the end of March of 
this year, when we passed the last 
CARES Act legislation, we didn’t have 
any idea how long this was going to 
last. We had no idea that we would be 
here now in December of 2020 and still 
grappling with how to contain this 
virus and dealing with the economic 
fallout associated with it. 
Thank goodness we made a priority 
of providing resources to our medical 
scientists and the pharmaceutical in-
dustry that have now come up with 
therapies and treatments which are 
saving more lives. Fewer people who 
get the virus are actually dying, 
thanks 
to 
the 
expertise 
of 
our 
healthcare providers and the thera-
peutics that they are able to admin-
ister—saving many, many lives. 
But the golden bullet in all of this is 
the vaccine. I am hopeful that we in 
America—that the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration will promptly, and I ex-
pect they will, approve the use of some 
of the vaccines that have been devel-
oped, once it is determined they are 
safe and effective. 
So I think this is like the cavalry ar-
riving, and the cavalry is nearby and 
will soon be here. Then we will 
prioritize the people in the country 
who will get the vaccine, as we should. 
I think the folks who have been on the 
frontlines, 
the 
so-called 
essential 
workers—I tend to think of all work as 
being 
essential, 
but 
certainly 
the 
healthcare providers, the people who 
had to show up. They couldn’t hunker 
down at home. They had to show up for 
work because we needed them to do 
that in order to protect the rest of us. 
But then we ought to go through the 
elderly, people with underlying health 
diseases, schoolteachers, and others to 
help us get our children back to school. 
The list goes on and on. 
But what I am not proud of is the em-
barrassing insensitivity of our Demo-
cratic colleagues, starting with the 
Senator from New York, the Demo-
cratic leader, when it comes to people’s 
fear about the consequences associated 
with the pandemic that relate to the li-
ability that may ultimately be im-
posed upon them because they didn’t 
guess it right the first time. 
I am talking about lawsuits by peo-
ple who will sue, claiming—I am sure 
many with some merit—that they have 
suffered as a result of this virus and at-
tempt to pin the responsibility on some 
business, some school, some church, 
some synagogue, some mosque, any-
where where they might have gotten 
the virus. Anybody with a liability in-
surance policy, I am sure, will be fair 
game by the trial lawyers. 
And I am not here to disparage mem-
bers of the legal profession. I happen to 
be one. But I do know that we ought to 
be focused on what is the greatest good 
for 
the 
greatest 
number, 
and 
we 
shouldn’t let the tail wag the dog when 
it comes to providing commonsense li-
ability 
protection, 
which 
is 
what 
brings me to the floor this afternoon. 
I heard the Senator from New York 
give a fevered speech about what he 
called corporate immunity, as if our 
desire to provide some predictability 
and some fairness in the context of 
civil liability was somehow a desire to 
protect 
nameless, 
faceless 
corpora-
tions. That is wrong, and that is why I 
came to the floor—to say it is wrong 
and to explain why it is wrong. 
The minority leader tries to frame 
this as a green light for big, bad busi-
nesses to ignore public health guide-
lines and to put every person who 
walks through their door in danger of 
contracting COVID–19. That is a false 
narrative. That is not true. 
For starters, what we have proposed 
is not blanket immunity. No one wants 
to give—let’s say somebody is running 
a meatpacking plant and one of the 
workers shows up and says: Boss, I 
don’t feel very good today; I think I 
may have something. And he says: You 
shut up; go to work. And they end up 
having the virus and infect all their 
peers and fellow employees. 
That is reckless and intentional mis-
conduct, and we do not limit lawsuits 
based on reckless and intentional mis-
conduct at all. So this is not a ‘‘get out 
of jail free’’ card or whatever you want 
to call it. This will not protect the peo-
ple who recklessly put other people in 
danger of this virus. 
In cases of gross negligence or willful 
misconduct, where the applicable pub-
lic health guidance is not followed, the 
person who suffered a harm has every 
right to sue and be made whole, and no 
one—no one—wants to change that. 
But what we do need to acknowledge 
is that we are all living through what 
I hope is a once-in-a-lifetime catas-
trophe for everybody involved, so I 
don’t think we should be creating an 
opportunity for people who want to 
profit off of this pandemic to do so, 
particularly when a handful of people 
will presumably benefit from what the 
Democratic leader is proposing—no li-
ability shield—and hundreds of mil-
lions of Americans will benefit from it. 
These are unprecedented times, to be 
sure, much like we owe the American 
people more support, and that is part 
of what is being blocked by the de-
mands of the Democratic leader to 
eliminate any sort of liability shield. 
We need to put some safeguards in 
place to ensure that those who are op-
erating in good faith and following all 
the relevant public health guidelines 
cannot be sued out of existence. Imag-
ine if you are a small business, hanging 
on by a thread. Somehow you have ap-
plied for your PPP loan, your paycheck 
protection loan, and you have been 
able to hang on to your business and

December 11, 2020 
keep your employees on the payroll— 
somehow, some way. 
Well, if you face the prospect of lim-
itless liability, opportunistic litigation 
is going to cost you a lot of money and 
all of your energy just to defend, even 
if the claim is meritless. You might 
think 
twice—probably 
more 
than 
twice—about whether you want to stay 
in business, whether you want to keep 
those jobs, whether you want to con-
tribute to our economy. 
We need those people. We need those 
businesses and those jobs. And I am not 
talking about the trial lawyers. They 
will be fine. They are not disadvan-
taged by having to hunker down, won-
dering where the next paycheck will 
come from. They will be fine. 
But there are a lot of people who are 
hurting, and it causes me great distress 
to see us—at least some of us—obliv-
ious to the pain, the anguish, and the 
desperation of so many Americans. 
The number of suicides is up dra-
matically. The number of reports of 
child sexual abuse is down because kids 
aren’t going to school where their 
teachers, hopefully, will be trained to 
help identify those people. 
People 
are 
self-medicating 
with 
drugs and alcohol. People are suffering 
mental health crises. And some folks 
here in Congress act like, that doesn’t 
affect me; it is not my problem. It is 
shocking to me that there are some 
who seem to have that approach. 
The minority leader knows the facts. 
When he talks about corporate immu-
nity, he wants to frame it in the most 
negative 
light 
possible, 
which, 
of 
course, is why he said that. 
What we are proposing will help peo-
ple. It will help medical workers, doc-
tors, nurses, aides at hospitals—those 
who have been on the frontlines trying 
to save lives. They didn’t have any 
choice but to show up. They didn’t ask 
‘‘Well, are your liability insurance pre-
miums paid up at the hospital?’’ or 
‘‘Maybe I need to up my limits because 
I know I am going to get sued after 
this.’’ They didn’t ask those kinds of 
questions; they went and did the job we 
wanted them to do, and God bless them 
for it. 
What we are proposing will help a lot 
more people, a lot more organizations. 
And by that, I mean not just busi-
nesses; it will help nonprofits, and it 
will help restaurants that have tried to 
follow the guidelines and opened at 
limited capacity, as they have gotten 
guidance from the local and State and 
national officials. This will help every-
body. 
First, it will help, as I said, our 
healthcare heroes, the brave men and 
women who have led in this battle for 
months. They have made tremendous 
physical and mental sacrifices to save 
lives, but without some liability pro-
tection from Congress, they could soon 
find themselves staring down the bar-
rel of a wave of medical malpractice 
lawsuits. 
I hope the minority leader will see 
why this can’t happen. New York State 
did. His State acted to provide medical 
liability 
protection 
for 
healthcare 
workers in his State. We need to make 
sure that the kinds of things that his 
State did for healthcare workers in 
New York are expanded to include oth-
ers around the country. We need to en-
sure 
that 
our 
healthcare 
workers 
aren’t taken to the cleaners for doing 
everything in their power in good faith 
to respond to the crisis. 
Again, the protections his State has 
provided set a willful misconduct or 
gross 
negligence 
standard 
for 
coronavirus medical liability suits to 
ensure that only legitimate cases are 
brought against healthcare workers in 
New York. If that is good enough for 
New Yorkers, for his constituents, why 
deny the same protection to my con-
stituents or the Presiding Officer’s con-
stituents or everybody else who is on 
the frontlines of fighting this battle 
during these unprecedented times? 
I know the minority leader got a let-
ter this summer from a long list of na-
tional medical associations, which rep-
resent 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
healthcare workers, calling for these 
very same types of protections. That 
letter detailed the challenges these 
workers were up against and, you can 
imagine, scarce personal protective 
equipment. 
It would be the easiest thing in the 
world to blame those healthcare work-
ers for not adequately providing per-
sonal protective equipment and some-
how contributing to the spread of the 
disease when we know that due to Chi-
na’s actions—hoarding a lot of the PPE 
that they themselves manufactured— 
when they didn’t tell the rest of the 
world that the virus was running ramp-
ant in China, they were hoarding that 
PPE, making it less available to local 
hospitals and doctors for the benefit of 
their patients. 
So it would be easy to see, now look-
ing back with the benefit of hindsight, 
that somebody said: Well, you knew or 
should have known you didn’t have 
adequate PPE to take care of your pa-
tients. As my dad always liked to say— 
he said: Hindsight is 20/20. 
That is just one example. These 
groups who wrote to the Democratic 
leader said that these physicians and 
other healthcare professionals are now 
facing the threat of years of costly liti-
gation due to the extraordinary cir-
cumstances. And these are the same in-
stitutions, the doctors and the hos-
pitals, that we have sent hundreds of 
billions of dollars to, and now we want 
to throw them to the wolves? We can’t 
allow our healthcare heroes to wake up 
in this pandemic only to find them-
selves facing a legal nightmare. 
But as I have said, it is not just 
healthcare workers who need our help. 
The list of organizations and institu-
tions that rely on this legislation is a 
long one. There are, for example, our 
public schools, our colleges, our univer-
sities, which have tried to adapt in try-
ing circumstances and are trying to 
allow our K–12 students and our young 
people who attend our colleges and uni-
versities an opportunity to continue 
their education safely, to the best of 
their ability. 
A number of national groups rep-
resenting education leaders, including 
superintendents, school boards, and 
other leaders, sent a letter to Senator 
SCHUMER and other congressional lead-
ers about the urgent need for these pro-
tections. They said: ‘‘We believe any 
protections should be limited in scope 
and preserve recourse for those harmed 
by truly bad actors who engage in egre-
gious misconduct.’’ And I agree with 
that. That is exactly the type of pro-
tection we have proposed. 
I am looking at a letter—it is dated 
May 28, 2020—from the American Coun-
cil on Education which I think does a 
pretty good job of summing of what I 
just described, the challenges that our 
educators and our students and our ad-
ministrators are facing trying to get 
back to some semblance of normalcy, 
because we all understand the impor-
tance of providing our next generation 
of leaders with a good education. 
In this letter from ACE, the Amer-
ican Council on Education, Ted Mitch-
ell, its president, writes: 
Unfortunately, all colleges and univer-
sities, two- and four-year, public and private 
nonprofit, are facing unprecedented chal-
lenges as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The impact on the operations and revenues 
of many institutions has been catastrophic, 
for some even existential, which has had a 
terrible ripple effect in communities large 
and small. The pandemic is also causing 
massive disruption to students and families. 
Many are grappling with sudden changes to 
their financial circumstances. 
In the wake of prior crises, Congress came 
together to pass timely and targeted liabil-
ity protections with strong bipartisan sup-
port because lawmakers understood the 
acute economic threat of lawsuits at mo-
ments of maximum economic vulnerability. 
While Congress has acted to provide some 
limited COVID-related liability protections 
for volunteer healthcare providers and some 
manufacturers of PPE in the CARES Act, 
much more needs to be done. While some 
governors and state legislatures have en-
acted COVID–19 liability limitations, this is 
a national problem requiring a national solu-
tion. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
letter following my remarks. 
The president and executive director 
of the American Dental Association 
wrote a letter thanking the Judiciary 
Committee for reviewing liability pro-
tections and asking Congress to pass 
these reforms. Similar to the other 
comments that have been made by 
other organizations, they said: ‘‘While 
safeguarding their patients, their staff, 
and themselves from the spread of 
COVID–19, dental practices must also 
safeguard their businesses from bad- 
faith actors pursuing frivolous finan-
cial gain for coronavirus injuries.’’ 
We have heard from a long list of 
groups, and it is not the Fortune 500, 
like the Democratic leader has pro-
posed. This isn’t corporate protection. 
This is common sense. This is what we 
have done before—in connection with

Y2K, in connection with 9/11, in connec-
tion with providing some limited li-
ability protection to pharmaceutical 
companies that we depend upon to 
produce vaccines that will save lives. 
Those are all examples where Congress 
has come together with a national re-
sponse to a national crisis. 
We have heard concerns from every-
thing from the U.S. Youth Soccer wor-
ried about their volunteers being sued, 
the American Heart Association wor-
ried about their fundraisers, churches 
worried about their ability to serve 
their communities with this cloud 
hanging over their heads. So who is 
acting in bad faith here? Not the 
schools. Not the charities. Not the 
healthcare providers who are calling 
for the limited protections this legisla-
tion would provide. No, it is the trial 
bar. It is the trial lawyers who are try-
ing to use this pandemic to make 
money. 
I am not here, again, to disparage 
members of the legal profession. I am 
just saying, who are we here going to 
bat for? Are we going to bat for a small 
group of wealthy lawyers, or are we 
going to bat for 330 million Americans? 
That is the choice, it seems to me. And 
the Democratic leader is carrying 
water for that wealthy elite minority, 
the members of the trial bar, by 
mischaracterizing 
this 
effort 
and 
blocking relief for his own constitu-
ents. 
Again, Governor Cuomo apparently 
was able to do this by some form of ex-
ecutive action, was able to provide 
some liability protections for medical 
malpractice lawsuits in New York. I 
wonder if the Democratic leader would 
come to the floor and call that cor-
porate protection. No. It made sense. 
Good for Governor Cuomo, and shame 
on us if we don’t do something similar. 
I want to close on another ironic 
statement by the Democratic leader 
this morning. He said: The American 
people deserve an outcome. I agree 
with that. But he said: It is not going 
to happen if the Republican majority 
insists on getting 100 percent of its par-
tisan demands. 
Well, we are not insisting on 100 per-
cent, but how about the 80 percent we 
can agree on? That just makes sense to 
me. They are the ones who are killing 
the COVID–19 relief bill by their insist-
ence that no liability protections be in-
cluded in this bill. It is the Wild Wild 
West, and they want to keep it just 
like that. 
The Democratic leader has been the 
one who has held up negotiations over 
the last several months. By my count, 
our Democratic leaders have blocked 
at least three, maybe four pieces of 
COVID–19 relief. That was at a time 
when they could have worked with us 
to make the bills better and to provide 
timely relief to our constituents, but 
no—they refused to accept anything 
short of a partisan, multitrillion-dollar 
bill that passed the House earlier this 
year, that NANCY PELOSI knew would 
never have a prayer of passing because 
it included such unrelated matters as 
tax cuts for millionaires and billion-
aires in places like New York and Cali-
fornia and included diversity studies on 
the marijuana industry. What in the 
heck does that have to do with COVID– 
19? They claimed that anything less 
than that $3-trillion white elephant 
was unworkable, so they gave our ef-
forts the Heisman and allowed the dis-
tress from the pandemic to go on for 
months and months and months while 
they blocked every attempt to deliver 
relief to the American people. 
Liability protections—commonsense 
liability protections for a limited pe-
riod of time, which are not designed to 
take over State tort law on a perma-
nent basis—we can agree on what the 
timeframe should be, but liability pro-
tections will allow our most important 
and vulnerable institutions and people 
to recover from this crisis, and I be-
lieve the Democratic leader would be 
wise to acknowledge that and work 
with us and get a result. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION, 
May 28, 2020. 
Re COVID–19 Limited Liability Protections. 
Representative NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Representative KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Senator CHUCK SCHUMER, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER 
MCCARTHY, LEADER MCCONNELL, AND MINOR-
ITY LEADER SCHUMER: On behalf of the Amer-
ican Council on Education and the under-
signed higher education associations, I am 
writing today to urge you to quickly enact 
temporary and targeted liability protections 
related to the COVID–19 pandemic. While 
these crucial protections are likely nec-
essary for many sectors of the American 
economy, this letter focuses on the need to 
safeguard higher education institutions and 
systems, 
affiliated 
nonprofits, 
and 
healthcare providers and facilities from ex-
cessive and speculative lawsuits arising out 
of the pandemic. 
Encouraging, enabling, and supporting the 
safe reopening of college and university cam-
puses for in-person learning is essential to 
educating our nation’s future workforce, pre-
serving employment for millions, and help-
ing restart America’s economy. As colleges 
and universities contemplate whether and 
how to safely reopen this fall, their over-
riding concern is keeping students, faculty, 
staff, and local communities safe. These de-
cisions are not premised on making a trade- 
off between safety and the economy. Nor are 
institutions of higher education seeking a 
free pass to avoid responsibility, much less 
immunize themselves for their own or oth-
ers’ bad acts. 
But as colleges and universities assess how 
quickly and completely campuses can re-
sume full operations, they are facing enor-
mous uncertainty about COV1D–19-related 
standards of care and corresponding fears of 
huge transactional costs associated with de-
fending against COVID–19 spread lawsuits, 
even when they have done everything within 
their power to keep students, employees, and 
visitors safe. To blunt the chilling effect this 
will have on otherwise reasonable decision- 
making leading to our nation’s campuses re-
suming operations in a safe and sensible 
manner, we ask that Congress quickly enact 
temporary COVID–19-related liability protec-
tions for higher education institutions and 
systems, affiliated entities, as well as their 
faculty, staff and volunteers. These protec-
tions should be conditioned on following ap-
plicable public health standards, and they 
should preserve recourse for those harmed by 
truly bad actors who engage in egregious 
misconduct. 
Colleges and universities, including their 
health care facilities and research enter-
prises, are engaged in every sector of critical 
infrastructure necessary to support Amer-
ican communities. In addition to educating 
and training our country’s future workforce, 
they provide health services, cultural re-
sources, spectator sports venues, and rec-
reational amenities to their communities. 
Our medical schools, teaching hospitals, and 
research labs are working around the clock 
to find the best treatments and vaccines for 
COV1D–19. Moreover, our higher education 
institutions maintain full service utilities, 
telecommunications, and computing net-
works; they provide housing and food serv-
ices; and they operate transportation net-
works, hotels, retail shops, daycares, gyms, 
and museums. To support this broad array of 
activities, they directly employ tens of thou-
sands of skilled workers in various trades, 
from electricians and linemen to plumbers 
and HVAC technicians; from landscapers and 
painters to carpenters and fabricators. 
Unfortunately, all colleges and univer-
sities, two- and four-year, public and private 
nonprofit, are facing unprecedented chal-
lenges as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The impact on the operations and revenues 
of many institutions has been catastrophic, 
for some even existential, which has had a 
terrible ripple effect in communities large 
and small. The pandemic is also causing 
massive disruption to students and their 
families. Many are grappling with sudden 
changes to their financial circumstances. 
In the wake of prior crises, Congress came 
together to pass timely and targeted liabil-
ity protections with strong bipartisan sup-
port because lawmakers understood the 
acute economic threat of lawsuits at mo-
ments of maximum economic vulnerability. 
While Congress has acted to provide some 
limited COVID–19-related liability protec-
tions for volunteer healthcare providers and 
some manufacturers of PPE in the CARES 
Act, much more must be done. While some 
governors and state legislatures have en-
acted COVID–19 liability limitations, this is 
a national problem requiring a national solu-
tion. 
Higher education’s need for temporary and 
targeted liability protections and relief is 
clear. Now is the time for Congress to act. 
Sincerely, 
TED MITCHELL, 
President.

H.R. 6395 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate has before it today the result of a 
compromise. The conference report 
that will result in the adoption of the 
National Defense Authorization Act— 
NDAA—for fiscal year 2021 is neither 
the bill the Senate approved, nor the 
one the House passed. I am pleased 
that this conference report cures many 
of the problems that led to my vote to 
oppose the Senate bill. Specifically, 
the conference report is void of the au-
thority for funds to support testing of 
a new nuclear device, which was in-
cluded in the Senate bill. This sends an 
important message to the world about 
Congress’s support for U.S. leadership 
in armed control. 
Further, the conference report ad-
vances the progress we have made with 
regard to Vietnam. This NDAA sends a 
clear message that Congress believes in 
the importance of cooperation with 
Vietnam, both to advance our shared 
security interests and to address some 
of the worst consequences of that war. 
The conference report will extend the 
authorization for the Department of 
Defense to help decontaminate the 
Bien Hoa Airbase from the lingering 
poison of dioxin, and it includes new 
authorization to help the Government 
of Vietnam locate and identify some of 
its hundreds of thousands of MIAs, as 
they have helped us locate our own 
MIAs over so many years. 
The bill will also help the veterans of 
that war who were exposed to dioxin. 
The expansion of presumption of expo-
sure included in this bill will mean 
that Americans suffering from a num-
ber of linked ailments can spend their 
time seeking treatment, rather than 
jumping 
through 
bureaucratic 
and 
legal hoops. For many veterans ex-
posed to airborne toxic substances 
through burn pits, this bill also in-
cludes a number of provisions to make 
it easier to identify their exposure and 
for them to make connections needed 
while seeking medical care. It con-
tinues the march towards rectifying 
the Department of Defense’s PFOS/ 
PFOA usage. While there is much to be 
done in both these areas, this is a posi-
tive step forward. 
This bill is imperfect, but of par-
ticular concern to me is the addition in 
conference, without proper vetting or 
evaluation, of several provisions that 
undermine the Freedom of Information 
Act, our Nation’s premier transparency 
law. Many of these provisions were in 
neither the Senate nor the House bill. 
For a number of years, I have worked 
in a bipartisan manner with other 
members of the Judiciary Committee 
to consult with the Senate Armed 
Services Committee to provide the 
feedback and expertise in FOIA mat-
ters, as it relates to proposals within 
the NDAA. That inclusive process, 
where committees of jurisdiction are 
consulted on their areas of expertise, 
has ensured that the NDAA does not 
become a vehicle for unwise or harmful 
policies. 
This time, however, a number of pro-
visions needlessly piercing holes in 
FOIA were inserted during conference 
negotiations without any consultation 
with 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
Unsurprisingly, a process that took 
place behind closed doors resulted in 
policies undermining the American 
people’s ability to know what their 
government is doing. Unfortunately, 
this is slowly becoming a routine prac-
tice, and it must not happen again. I 
want to put everyone on notice: I will 
insist that the Judiciary Committee 
and those of us who worked for many 
years on these matters are consulted 
on provisions that fall within the pur-
view of our committee before they are 
included in the NDAA. That consulta-
tion process has produced good out-
comes for the American people for 
years. Let’s not change it now. 
With these concerns in mind, on bal-
ance, this is a defense authorization 
bill that I will support. It advances our 
efforts to reconcile with our history 
and address the naming of our military 
bases after Confederate generals, some-
thing 
over 
which 
the 
President 
inexplicably threatened to veto the 
bill. It rejects the President’s demands 
to repeal section 230 of the Commu-
nications Decency Act, something that 
advances his personal war, but which 
demands 
careful 
consideration 
and 
should not be used as hostage bait. 
This conference report authorizes 
over $740 billion in spending. The de-
fense of our Nation and our inter-
national role in providing security and 
promoting stability demand significant 
investments. I hope, however, that in 
future years, Congress will thought-
fully consider the skewed balance of 
our defense investments against other 
critical domestic needs. These are dif-
ficult questions, but ones that demand 
debate and honest review.

FURTHER 
CONTINUING 
APPRO-
PRIATIONS ACT, 2021, AND OTHER 
EXTENSIONS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 8900. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 8900) making further con-
tinuing appropriations for fiscal year 2021, 
and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is 
no great secret that the American peo-
ple understand how far removed the 
U.S. Congress and both political par-
ties are from their needs. They do polls 
out there, depending on the month, and 
Congress gets a 10-percent approval 
rating, and, on a good day, maybe a 20- 
percent approval rating. 
People understand that, to a shame-
ful degree, what Congress does is worry 
about the needs of wealthy campaign 
contributors—both political parties— 
and turns their backs on the needs of 
working people. 
A few months ago, in Burlington, VT, 
not far from where I live, they shut 
down the road so that people could line 
up in their cars to get emergency food 
distributed by the Vermont National 
Guard—hundreds and hundreds of peo-
ple in Burlington and all over the State 
of Vermont. And, by the way, Vermont 
probably is in better shape than most 
States in this country. We have more 
hunger in America today than at any 
time in the modern history of this 
country. This pandemic has been a dis-
aster not only from a public health per-
spective but from an economic perspec-
tive, and economists tell us that work-
ing families today are in worse shape 
right now than at any time since the 
Great Depression. 
And it is not just the children in 
America—the 
richest 
country 
on 
Earth—who are going hungry. You 
have millions and millions of families 
who are scared to death that they are 
going to be evicted from their homes 
and join the half a million people in 
America who are already homeless. 
We have half of our population work-
ing day to day, living paycheck to pay-
check, trying to survive. This Congress 
must address the economic emergency 
facing the American people. We cannot 
go back to our families during the 
Christmas holidays while tens of mil-
lions of families are suffering. They are 
looking toward us and their govern-
ment—their 
government—to 
provide 
the emergency assistance that they 
need. 
Yesterday, Senator HAWLEY and I in-
troduced a very simple amendment— 
not a radical idea. In fact, we are way, 
way 
behind 
what 
other 
countries 
around the world are doing to protect 
their workers. All that we want to do is 
to once again provide the same benefits 
that were provided in the CARES bill 
that 
unanimously—unanimously, 
Democrats, 
Republicans—President 
Trump signed it, supported it. We all 
came together in March to say that 
every working-class adult in this coun-
try would get $1,200 and their kids 
would get $500. 
So if you have a husband and wife 
and two kids, that is 3,400 bucks. 
Maybe they can use that money to pay 
a couple of months’ rent, buy some 
food, go to the doctor. We are looking 
at a horrible pandemic now. You have 
90 million people who are uninsured or 
underinsured. That is all we are ask-
ing—to do what we unanimously did in 
March, to make sure that our unem-
ployed workers get the benefits they 
need to make sure that working fami-
lies get that $1,200 check per person. 
Now, I have been here for a while. I 
am not one of the Members of the Sen-
ate who shuts down, does this and does 
that, and keeps people here for weeks. 
I don’t do that. But this I want to say 
right now: I am prepared to withdraw 
my objection at this moment, but I 
will not be prepared to withdraw an ob-
jection next week. We will deal with 
the financial crisis facing tens of mil-
lions of Americans. And if I have any-
thing to say about it—and I guess I 
do—we are not going to go home for 
the Christmas holidays unless we make 
sure that we provide for the millions of 
families in this country who are suf-
fering. 
With that, I would yield to Senator 
HAWLEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, this is a very 
simple thing that we are talking about, 
and I can boil it down real easily. 
If the Senate of the United States 
can find hundreds of billions of dollars 
to give to big government and big busi-
ness, surely it can find some relief for 
working families and working individ-
uals. And I would just submit to you 
that it is working families and working 
people who should be first in line for 
COVID relief, not last. 
That is why the amendment that 
Senator SANDERS and I have proposed 
is so common sense—$1,200 for individ-
uals, $2,400 for families, $500 for every 
child—and as Senator SANDERS rightly 
said, every Member of this body has 
voted yes, in favor of this relief before. 
What is more, I can’t figure who ex-
actly is opposed to it. The President of 
the United States has said that he is in 
favor of direct assistance. I thank the 
majority leader for his own support of 
direct assistance. The Speaker of the 
House says she is in favor of direct as-
sistance. And that is why there is no 
reason why this body should leave next 
week before we vote on and approve di-
rect assistance to working families. 
Now, let me just say one other thing. 
Let me tell you about a phone call I 
had with a friend of mine at home 
when this Congress approved direct as-
sistance back in March. He texted me, 
and then he called me and he said: I am 
seeing this news about relief that we 
are going to maybe get a check. Is that 
real? 
I said: Yeah, that is real. 
He said: Well, I don’t know. I am wor-
ried about taking it. I mean, what if we 
spend the money? I mean, we could use 
the money, but what if we spend it, and 
I can’t pay it back? You know, it 
comes back and now I have got to pay 
it back? 
I said: You don’t have to pay it back. 
It is relief, because you need it, be-
cause you are working. This is a guy 
who works in concrete. That is his 
business. 
And he said: Are you serious, now? 
You are serious that we can keep this 
money? I can use this for my family. 
I said: That is exactly what it is for. 
And his comment to me was—his 
words were: Man, this is a godsend. 
There are families like that not just 
all over Missouri, not just all over 
Vermont, but all over this Nation, and 
they are in need today like they were 
in need in March. It is incumbent upon 
this body to act, and we should not 
leave until we do that. 
So having reserved the right to ob-
ject, today, I do not object. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I with-
draw my objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill was ordered to a third read-
ing and was read the third time.

f 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join 
my colleagues in thanking Senator PAT 
ROBERTS of Kansas for his service to 
his State and our Nation. 
Years ago, PAT ROBERTS and I served 
together on the House Agriculture 
Committee. We now serve together on 
the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
From our earliest days working to-
gether in House until today, PAT ROB-
ERTS has been a consistent champion of 
Kansans and of farmers and people in 
small towns and rural communities 
across America. 
Through his leadership, Senator ROB-
ERTS has shepherded eight bipartisan 
farm bills into law. Farmers say that 
farm bills give them the certainty that 
they can count on. Farmers could rely 
on PAT ROBERTS for that certainty too. 
PAT ROBERTS not only has worked to 
address the day-to-day challenges of 
agriculture, he also worked to prepare 
American farmers and ranchers for the 
future. From the creation of the Foun-
dation for Food and Agriculture Re-
search in the 2014 farm bill to pro-
tecting agriculture from disease by 
modernizing and building the National 
Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Kan-
sas, Senator ROBERTS knew the value 
in investing in research. Most recently, 
he joined me in the America Grows Act 
to increase Federal investments in 
basic USDA research across the board. 
There is no doubt that Senator ROB-
ERTS’ legacy will reap benefits for 
years. But his commitment to rural 
communities didn’t stop with farmers. 
In April 2018, I met with Illinois EMS 
advocates. We talked about how rural 
EMS are on the frontlines in delivering 
quality emergency response, service 
coordination, and patient care. They 
spoke about how they were responding 
to the opioid epidemic and treating the 
emergency needs of an aging popu-
lation. I became convinced that Con-
gress needed to find a way to support 
rural EMS agencies with Federal fund-
ing so they could better serve their 
communities, but I needed a partner 
for it. The solution was obvious. I 
found Senator ROBERTS in the Senate 
gym and pitched him on the bill. 
Within a few weeks, we introduced 
the Supporting and Improving Rural 
EMS Needs, or SIREN, Act. Senator 
DEBBIE STABENOW joined as a partner 
to the bill, and we started working 
hard to pass it. The SIREN Act was in-
cluded in the 2018 farm bill. And this 
past summer, the first grant award 
went to Illinois when our healthcare 
providers needed it most for this pan-
demic. 
For four decades, Senator ROBERTS 
has been a significant part of Federal 
agriculture policy. He is the only law-
maker to have chaired both the House 
and Senate Agriculture Committees. 
Farm bills don’t happen without bipar-
tisanship, and PAT’s legacy of biparti-
sanship is something we should honor 
in the future. 
It has been an honor and privilege, 
working with him. I will miss his bi-
partisan spirit and his dry wit. I wish 
him, his wife Franki, and their family 
happiness in his next chapter. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAMME RECIPIENT OF THE 
2020 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week’s Nobel Peace Prize celebration 
in Oslo, Norway, is honoring the United 
Nations World Food Programme for its 
efforts to combat hunger, for its con-
tributions to bettering conditions for 
peace in conflict-affected areas and for 
acting as a driving force in efforts to 
prevent the use of hunger as a weapon 
of war and conflict. 
I am proud to add my voice in con-
gratulating this deeply important or-
ganization and the thousands of its he-
roic and courageous staff on this well- 
deserved honor. 
In 1961, President Eisenhower called 
on the United Nations to address hun-
ger, leading to the creation of the 
World Food Programme. Since then, 
the World Food Programme has pro-
vided lifesaving help in some of the 
world’s most difficult places and condi-
tions. 
The United States remains a strong 
partner of the World Food Programme 
and one of its biggest funders. During 
my time in the Senate, I joined several 
of my colleagues such as the late Sen-
ator Dick Lugar and Senator BOB 
CASEY in strong bipartisan support for 
the organization and related efforts to 
combat hunger at omeand abroad. 
Today, the World Food Programme is 
the world’s largest humanitarian orga-
nization and the leading global agency 
delivering food assistance in emer-
gencies and working with communities 
to improve nutrition and build resil-
ience. It provides more than 15 billion 
meals to 100 million people in more 
than 80 countries each year. Through 
war zones, floods, famines, and earth-
quakes, the World Food Programme is 
on the ground for those most in need, a 
ray of hope in the lives of the most vul-
nerable. It has truly earned recognition 
as ‘‘the world’s first responder,’’ as 
noted 
by 
U.N. 
Secretary 
General 
Anto´nio Guterres. 
Like all first responders, it did not 
hesitate to answer the call when the 
COVID–19 pandemic hit earlier this 
year. The COVID–19 pandemic has dis-
rupted every sector of life all over the 
world, adding another level of hardship 
on those in the midst of conflict and 
poverty and potentially doubling the 
number of people facing acute hunger 
to 270 million. But since the start of 
this emergency, the World Food Pro-
gramme has continued providing relief 
to children and families in the mount-
ing crisis. 
While the need for food relief has 
drastically increased during the pan-
demic, hunger has long been used a tac-
tic in conflicts around the world. Food 
supply chains are disrupted or humani-
tarian aid is restricted, essentially 
starving innocent civilians caught in 
the crossfire. In turn, starvation leads 
to more conflict over scare resources. 
The link between food insecurity and 
conflict is clear: one fuels the other. 
And it is also clear that helping popu-
lations with emergency relief and long- 
term sustainability prevents millions 
of people from experiencing the horrors 
of starvation as a tactic of war and 
conflicts from erupting out of the des-
peration of hunger. Not only is it a 
moral responsibility to aid the world’s 
most vulnerable, but it is in the best 
interest of the international commu-
nity for a more secure world. 
The World Food Programme is one of 
the best examples of the good that 
comes from global cooperation. From 
our American farmers working along-
side farmers all over the world, to the 
staff on the ground, it takes many to 
help feed the world’s poor. No country 
alone would be able to reach every 
comer of the globe, especially in the 
most entrenched of conflicts such as 
Yemen, Syria, and South Sudan. It is 
critical that the United States con-
tinues to support the World Food Pro-
gramme, and I will continue to work to 
ensure that Congress provides the 
funds to do so. 
While the global COVID pandemic is 
a setback in feeding the world, I am 
confident that the World Food Pro-
gramme will help lead the way to alle-
viating the suffering. I again congratu-
late the World Food Programme and 
all of its staff for their courageous ef-
forts.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH T. MCELVEEN 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, today I would like to take a 
moment to recognize and honor Mayor 
Joseph T. McElveen of Sumter, SC. 
Mayor McElveen served in the U.S. Air 
Force after graduating from the Cita-
del in 1968 and from the University of 
South Carolina Law School in 1971. 
Mayor McElveen has served on the 
city council, as a member of the S.C. 
House of Representatives for Sumter 
County, and now is retiring after serv-
ing as mayor of Sumter. He has dedi-
cated over 20 years of his life to serving 
the great people of Sumter and has 
seen prosperity and growth come to 
Sumter County firsthand. 
I want to thank Mayor McElveen for 
his service and for emulating in his life 
what it means to be a public servant.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING DONALD LEE 
CLARK 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a great man and Mon-
tanan. 
Donald Lee Clark was a soldier, hus-
band, father, professor, author, and 
mentor who loved, lived, and learned 
for all of his 90 years. 
He tested positive for COVID–19 on 
November 28, 2020, and died 7 days 
later. At a time when it is easy to be a 
cynic, Clark was unusually optimistic, 
surrounding himself with family and 
friends who admired and loved him. 
Throughout his accomplished life in 
the Air Force, where he served our Na-
tion as a colonel, Clark never lost sight 
of making time to enjoy the world or 
people around him. He earned a 3rd de-
gree black belt in Judo from the 
Kodokan Judo College while stationed 
in Japan. He learned to scuba dive as 
an attache in the Soviet Union in 
hopes of diving in the world’s deepest 
lake. He taught himself to ride a uni-
cycle just for the fun of it and took up 
skiing in his 40s while living in New 
Hampshire as a research fellow at the 
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy 
at Tufts University. He skied the Alps 
while serving as an action officer as-
signed to the joint staff in the Office of 
International Negotiations. 
He was born in Dallas, TX, to Victor 
and Sheppard Clark. Don is survived by 
his wife of 65 years Patricia Conway 
Clark, their two sons Brian and his 
wife Marie of Kalispell, Darren and his 
wife Myrna of Rancho Santa Mar-
garita, CA, and three grandsons Kellin 
Clark and his wife Lauren Fox of Wash-
ington, DC, and Ryan Clark and Kevin 
Clark of California. He was preceded in 
death by his older sister Delores. 
Don and his sister were raised in Dal-
las by their single mother Sheppard. 
He attended Southern Methodist Uni-
versity on theology and ROTC scholar-
ships and graduated with a degree in 
sociology. He later earned his masters 
in political science from George Wash-
ington University while in the Air 
Force. 
He met and later married the love of 
his life Patricia Conway in 1955 at Per-
kins Chapel on the campus of Southern 
Methodist University. After graduating 
from SMU, Clark began his military 
service career, which included assign-
ments around the U.S. and the world. 
During his military career, he served 
in the Strategic Air Command as a B29 
navigator, Air Training Command, Se-
curity Service, and Intelligence. Most 
of his 23–year military career was fo-
cused on intelligence. He was a Soviet 
specialist for numerous U.S. delega-
tions including the Strategic Arms 
Limitation Talks, Law of the Seas, and 
Mutual and Balanced Force Reduc-
tions. 
He retired from the Air Force as a 
colonel in 1974 and moved his family 
from DC to Bozeman to ski at Bridger 
Bowl and become the assistant to the 
president at Montana State University. 
Six years later, he became the director 
of international education where he 
also taught courses in political science. 
He later started MSU’s International 
Education programs while teaching 
classes in international affairs. While 
at MSU, he wrote a weekly newspaper 
column for several Montana dailies, ex-
cerpts from which were sometimes 
broadcast over Voice of America. His 
writings also appeared in ‘‘Skiing’’ 
magazine, the Air University Review, 
the ‘‘Alternative,’’ and Defense Anal-
ysis. 
After 20 years of teaching at MSU, 
Clark retired again and moved with Pa-
tricia to Flathead Lake just outside of 
Bigfork, MT. In his retirement, Clark 
started writing fiction and published 
several novels intertwining his passion 
for politics, world affairs and the 
human condition. In his 70s, Clark also 
volunteered his time to numerous com-
munity groups. Clark joined CASA— 
Court Appointed Special Advocates— 
and became a key volunteer working 
with families and children in need. He 
served on the State advisory board for 
CASA and on the United Way and Red 
Cross advisory boards in Montana. 
Don was never a victim in life or in 
death, but his loss is his final teaching 
moment. Even as his mind was fading 
with Alzheimers, he maintained his 
positive attitude. He never failed to 
tell his family how proud he was, how 
much he loved them, and what a won-
derful life he had lived. Don will be 
missed.∑
