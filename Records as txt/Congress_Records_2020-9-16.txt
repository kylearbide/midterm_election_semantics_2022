IN MEMORY OF DARYL ANN 
PENNINGTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
profound sadness that I share the news 
that a great friend and public servant 
has passed away. 
Daryl Ann Pennington was a dear 
friend, trusted member of my staff, and 
a tireless advocate for Maryland’s 
Fifth District. 
For the past 12 years, Daryl served as 
a caseworker in my office in Greenbelt, 
Maryland, 
serving 
Prince 
George’s 
County, Calvert County, and Anne 
Arundel 
County. 
Earlier, 
she 
had 
worked for former Maryland State Sen-
ator Ulysses Currie. 
Mr. Speaker, she knew the Fifth Dis-
trict and its communities better than 
almost anyone, and she cared deeply 
about the people who called, emailed, 
and wrote to us asking for assistance 
with Federal agencies and help access-
ing government services. In particular, 
Daryl was a fierce advocate for our dis-
trict seniors, but she was also a mentor 
to countless young people, including 
interns who came to our district office 
and learned lessons from Daryl, not 
only about serving our constituents 
but how to approach life through perse-
verance, faith, and positive thinking. 
Daryl drew heavily on her personal 
faith as a member of the Evangel Ca-
thedral in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, 
for more than a quarter of a century, 
and as a partner with Dr. Corinthia 
Ridgely Boone of the International 
Christian Host Coalition organizing the 
National Capital Region’s Day of Pray-
er for many, many years. 
Mr. Speaker, she believed strongly 
that prayer was a powerful tool, not 
only to connect with her creator, but 
to connect with others here on Earth, 
to communicate her love for others, 
and to spread peace and joy to those 
around her, which she surely did. Her 
sense of humor, her wit, her warmth 
will be sorely missed not only by her 
colleagues in my office, but by all who 
knew her. 
I and all of us who worked so closely 
with Daryl will miss her very, very 
much. Daryl had so many spiritual 
daughters and the many young women 
who looked up to her over the years as 
a mentor and friend, but her pride and 
joy were her five children: Laura, 
Christie, Toi, Peter, and Lenny, as well 
as her grandchildren to whom, of 
course, she was devoted. 
A native of Rochester, New York, 
Daryl made her final journey home in 
July when she was diagnosed with mul-
tiple myeloma and departed Maryland 
to seek treatment closer to family at 
the University of Rochester Medical 
Center. We had all hoped to welcome 
her back soon, but sadly, Daryl’s condi-
tion worsened quickly last week, and 
she passed away on Saturday morning 
with her family by her side. 
Mr. Speaker, Daryl was a true friend 
and partner in service to the people of 
Maryland’s Fifth District. She will 
long be remembered by those she 
helped and by those of us who worked 
closely with her. 
Her passing is a great loss to my con-
stituents, our office, to this House, and 
to our country. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in offering her family the 
condolences of the whole House and the 
thanks of a Nation grateful for patri-
otic Americans like Daryl Ann Pen-
nington who serve their country and 
communities so dutifully and so well. 
Mr. Speaker, now Daryl rests in 
peace with God, whom she served so 
faithfully throughout her life.

MEMORIALIZING REVEREND BILLY 
GRAHAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to announce that 
a familiar figure within North Caro-
lina’s history will soon be featured 
here in the United States Capitol. 
On July 22, I came to the floor and 
spoke about how the first Republican 
majority in the North Carolina legisla-
ture in over 40 years voted in 2015 to re-
place the current statue of Charles 
Aycock in the Capitol with a statue of 
Billy Graham. A week later, on July 29, 
a committee within the North Caro-
lina’s General Assembly unanimously 
approved a model of Reverend Gra-
ham’s 
statue 
and 
commissioned 
a 
sculptor to create a life-sized model.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4432 
September 16, 2020 
The level of expediency in this proc-
ess is a true testament to how Rev-
erend Graham was revered not only in 
North Carolina, but also across the 
world. Recently, President Trump has 
expressed his support for a statue of 
Reverend Graham to be commissioned, 
and he even suggested that Reverend 
Graham would be memorialized in a 
new statuary park known as the ‘‘Na-
tional Garden of American Heroes.’’ 
Reverend Graham came from humble 
beginnings in Charlotte, North Caro-
lina, where he was raised on a dairy 
farm in the early 1920s. 
During his lifetime, he counseled for-
eign dignitaries, numerous Presidents, 
members of the Royal family, and 
many other significant public figures. 
However, his work was not solely 
consigned to the upper echelons of gov-
ernment or politics. His life’s work was 
dedicated to the millions of people 
around the world who sought Jesus 
Christ as their one true Lord and sav-
ior. 
He once described being a Christian 
as, ‘‘more than just an instantaneous 
conversion. It is a daily process where-
by you grow to be more and more like 
Christ.’’ 
In 2018, Reverend Graham passed 
away at the age of 99, and to say that 
he left an indelible mark on society 
would 
be 
an 
understatement. 
For 
years, I have advocated for Reverend 
Graham to have a place within the hal-
lowed Halls of the Capitol, and I am so 
pleased that the millions of people who 
visit the Capitol every year will soon 
be able to view his statue.

IN HONOR OF SARAH M. 
STEVENSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
morning to speak in honor of the first 
Black woman to serve on the Char-
lotte-Mecklenburg School Board. 
One of the cofounders and conveners 
of the Tuesday Morning Breakfast 
Forum, not only a queen of the Queen 
City, but one of the crown jewels, Miss 
Sarah Stevenson. 
Sarah Belle Mingo was born in Heath 
Springs, South Carolina, in 1925, the 
first of 14 children. 
Her life quickly led her to Charlotte 
where, like many African-American 
women of her time, she worked as a 
housekeeper and did domestic work so 
that she and her family could achieve a 
brighter future. 
In Charlotte, she successfully inte-
grated the school district’s parent- 
teacher associations, and as an activist 
and mother of four, helped lay the 
foundation for one of the most inte-
grated school districts in the Nation. 
You could have found her across the 
street from us on October 12, 1970, when 
she attended oral arguments at the Su-
preme Court for the Swann v. Char-
lotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education 
case. 
In 1980, she won election to the board 
of education, which she served for 8 
years. 
Equity in education was always at 
the forefront of what she did, because 
even though the courts declared sepa-
rate but equal was unequal, too many 
schools in Charlotte were still both 
separate and unequal. 
What she did made a difference. In 
1984, halfway through Miss Sarah’s ten-
ure on the school board, President Ron-
ald Reagan made a campaign stop in 
Charlotte at the height of his popu-
larity. President Reagan had a line in 
his stump speech that won thunderous 
applause in cities across the country, 
and in Charlotte, he repeated it, saying 
that school busing was a failed social 
experiment that nobody wants. 
The crowd went silent. There was, at 
best, scattered applause. That is be-
cause in Charlotte, activists like Sarah 
Stevenson worked hard so that Black 
and White parents could come together 
in 
support 
of 
Charlotte’s 
‘‘finest 
achievement’’—school integration. 
She lost reelection to the school 
board in 1988 because she continued to 
value equity and integration even as 
the political winds changed. Her values 
were more important to her than win-
ning votes. And that is an example 
that we can all learn from. 
While on the school board, she co-
founded the Tuesday Morning Break-
fast Forum, a group she continues to 
convene to this day. The Forum can 
best be described as the pulse of the 
community in Charlotte. The Forum 
has met on most Tuesdays for the past 
40 years and is a required stop for can-
didates for public office in Charlotte 
and those running statewide. 
For these and many other achieve-
ments, it goes without saying that 
Sarah Stevenson has earned numerous 
awards and commendations over the 
course of her life. I was honored to be 
with her in 2007 as the Charlotte-Meck-
lenburg Housing Partnership opened 
the 130-unit Stevenson Apartments in 
her honor. 
But perhaps the greatest honor she 
continues to bestow on us, the entire 
Charlotte community, is her wisdom. 
Not only her wisdom, but the wisdom 
of the Forum and its 40 years of guest 
speakers and attendees. 
As is said in a Fourfold Franciscan 
blessing that often starts the Forum: 
May God bless us with discomfort at easy 
answers, half-truths, and superficial rela-
tionships, so that we may live deep within 
our hearts. 
May God bless us with anger at injustice, 
oppression, and exploitation of people, so 
that we may work for justice, freedom, and 
peace. 
May God bless us with tears to shed for 
those who suffer from pain, rejection, starva-
tion, and war so that we may reach our 
hands to them to comfort them and turn 
their path pain into joy. 
May God bless us with enough foolishness 
to believe that we can make a difference in 
this world, so that we can do what others 
claim cannot be done. 
I thank Miss Sarah, for working for 
justice, freedom, and peace, and for 
blessing so many people with enough 
foolishness to believe that we can 
make the impossible possible.

CONSERVATISM DURING COVID 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to set the record straight. 
The American people are wondering 
what Congress is doing to help folks 
who are still struggling from the ef-
fects of COVID–19 on their health and 
on all of our economy. They see no 
movement in negotiations, and I have 
had folks back home ask me, What are 
you all doing up there? Well, sadly, the 
answer is, Not much, really. 
Some in this Chamber claim that it 
is us, the Republicans, who have no so-
lutions on COVID. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. Let me just 
speak for myself. I have introduced 
more than a dozen bills with my col-
leagues. Some of these bills are bipar-
tisan, and they apply time-tested con-
servative principles to help people im-
pacted and hurt by COVID–19. 
These 
are 
bills 
that 
expand 
healthcare access. They support work-
ers. They incentivize telework. They 
assure safe public housing. They sim-
plify PPP loans. Mr. Speaker, they 
stop stimulus payments to dead people, 
of all things. They explore temperature 
checks at airports. They establish 
flexible funding for States and local-
ities; a bill that holds China account-
able, and helps incentivize a safe re-
opening of our country, and much, 
much more. Each and every one of 
these bills has been denied a vote in 
this House. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand the poli-
tics of being less than 50 days away 
from an election. And I get the polit-
ical calculation that has been made. 
The Speaker started this year—right 
there—by ripping up the President’s 
State of the Union. And she seems in-
tent on ending it by smearing Repub-
licans as enemies of the State and 
blocking any meaningful bills to help 
hardworking Americans. 
But the American people deserve to 
know that my Republican colleagues 
and I, we stand ready to govern and 
ready to pass commonsense conserv-
ative policies that will help them make 
it through this pandemic.

WILDFIRES RAVAGE WEST COAST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PETERS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address the wildfires cur-
rently ravaging the West Coast of the 
United States. 
More than 85 major fires, spanning 
from Washington State to Southern 
California are burning, as I speak. 
Thirty-five people have died, only 
ashes remain in hundreds of commu-
nities, tens of thousands have fled their

homes and many individuals are still 
missing. Some survivors compare the 
site of the flames to the gates of hell. 
This year alone, California has seen 
over 2,600 more fires and a nearly 2,000 
percent increase in the acres burned 
compared to this time last year. That 
is according to the California Depart-
ment of Forestry and Fire Protection, 
or Cal-Fire. 
The frequency and intensity are no 
accident. We used to refer to early fall 
as ‘‘wildfire season’’ but the threat of 
these fires is now present throughout 
the year. 
In San Diego and in other areas of 
Southern California, dry and arid con-
ditions, paired with high temperatures, 
can make for a deadly combination. 
The Valley fire in eastern San Diego 
County, which is now 87 percent con-
tained, burned almost 18,000 acres of 
land and prompted the closure of the 
Cleveland National Forest. 
b 0915 
That fire started 10 days ago, but 
smoke and haze across the county are 
barely now beginning to clear. The air 
quality continues to pose a risk for 
sensitive groups. This fire is only the 
latest in a long history of destructive 
fires in San Diego County. 
I call on my fellow Members of Con-
gress to accept and recognize this 
truth: Our actions don’t exist in a vac-
uum. The consequences of our actions 
lead to rising temperatures and more 
extreme natural events, including hur-
ricanes, droughts, and flooding. 
It is not a matter of belief. Yearly 
patterns show us how these changes 
aren’t natural. They are man-made. 
They are climate change. 
We owe it to every single firefighter 
and first responder to act on this issue 
now. Every day, they risk their lives in 
the blistering heat, not knowing if 
they will make it back home. We are 
beyond grateful for their bravery and 
their unwavering dedication to public 
safety. 
These conditions leading to the dev-
astation on the West Coast are pre-
ventable, but the only way forward is 
through bipartisan partnerships to ad-
dress 
the 
key 
drivers 
of 
climate 
change. Saving lives, infrastructure, 
and our lands from the effects of severe 
weather require concrete and swift ac-
tion on the climate crisis now. 
RECOGNIZING ALICE JOHNSON ON HER 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the birthday of an extraor-
dinary constituent and American hero. 
She is a World War II veteran, a U.S. 
Army Corps nurse, a Purple Heart re-
cipient, a proud American patriot, an 
activity community member, and a 
birthday card enthusiast. 
She is the remarkable Alice Johnson 
of Rancho Bernardo, California. I com-
mend her service to our country, love 
of adventure, dedication to the well- 
being of others, and fun-loving spirit as 
she reaches this momentous milestone 
of 100 years. 
Alice Johnson was born on Sep-
tember 12, 1920, in Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts. She completed her nursing 
education in 1941. 
After Pearl Harbor, she enlisted in 
the U.S. Army Nurse Corps. Her unit 
arrived in Okinawa, Japan, on Easter 
Sunday in 1945, where she helped estab-
lish a field hospital ahead of the U.S. 
invasion of Japan. 
A few months later, eight Japanese 
Kamikaze planes descended upon the 
island, and U.S. troops attempted to 
shoot them down. Alice was injured in 
the crossfire and evacuated to Hawaii 
for surgery. She was awarded a Purple 
Heart after her service overseas. 
Later in life, Alice served as a flight 
attendant for United Airlines, back 
when flight attendants were required 
to be nurses. 
Always interested in nursing and 
travel, she accepted a nursing position 
at a hospital in Aruba. There, she met 
and married John Johnson, and to-
gether, they had four children. 
Alice moved back to the U.S. and 
continued her nursing career at a pri-
vate cancer practice, at a burn hos-
pital, and as a public health nurse for 
vision and hearing tests in schools. 
After her retirement, Alice settled in 
Rancho Bernardo, California, near her 
family, and remains active, attending 
Hope United Methodist Church, square 
dancing with friends, and playing mah-
jong at the Poway Senior Center. 
Her daughter, Elaine, and son-in-law, 
Bill, reached out to me to share her life 
stories worthy of celebration as she be-
comes a centenarian. 
I am overjoyed to wish Alice Johnson 
the very happiest 100th birthday. On 
behalf of the constituents of Califor-
nia’s 52nd District, we honor her self-
less service in World War II, her dedi-
cated career as a nurse, and the joy she 
continuously brings to all who know 
her. 
I wish a happy 100th birthday to 
Alice. She is a treasure to us all.

HONORING 
DOLORES 
GRESHAM 
FOR HER REMARKABLE SERVICE 
TO WEST TENNESSEE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor a ter-
rific Tennessee leader, State Senator 
Dolores Gresham, who will be retiring 
from public service this year. 
My friend, Senator Dolores Gresham, 
has been a strong leader in west Ten-
nessee for many years, and I have great 
respect for her strong career of service 
and her tireless leadership in edu-
cation. Dolores Gresham has been high-
ly influential in the political, social, 
and civic life in west Tennessee. 
Before she entered public service as 
an elected official, Senator Gresham 
proudly served our country as a mem-
ber of the United States Marine Corps 
and retired at the rank of lieutenant 
colonel. 
A champion for education in Ten-
nessee, Dolores Gresham presided over 
and led the Tennessee State Education 
Committee during a time of great im-
provement in academic achievement in 
the history of the Volunteer State. 
Senator Gresham has proved to ev-
eryone that citizens can make a dif-
ference by being involved in commu-
nity service and by leading by example. 
Roberta and I wish her and her hus-
band, Will, the best in their retire-
ment. We appreciate her friendship, 
and we greatly appreciate her public 
service to the Volunteer State. 
HONORING ANDY HOLT FOR HIS STRONG SERVICE 
TO WEST TENNESSEE 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
friend and Tennessee State Representa-
tive Andy Holt. Andy is retiring this 
year from the Tennessee State legisla-
ture. 
Representative Andy Holt has been a 
leader and an outspoken voice in the 
Tennessee State House since his first 
term began in 2011. 
Representative Holt’s work on the 
Agriculture 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee, his involvement with the 
Tennessee Farm Bureau—and I can’t 
forget his famous Hogfest—were all 
critical in bringing national attention 
to west Tennessee’s agricultural com-
munity. 
Andy has served as a member of the 
Finance, 
Ways 
and 
Means 
Sub-
committee, which is a vital committee 
that helps craft the Tennessee State 
budget. 
Andy Holt has also been a strong 
voice in the Tennessee State Capitol 
and has never shied away from speak-
ing and living out his values. 
He was part of numerous monu-
mental pieces of legislation, such as 
the enhanced concealed carry permit 
and the heartbeat bill, and helped suc-
cessfully repeal a portion of the Ten-
nessee professional privilege tax. 
No matter the politics of an issue, 
Andy Holt always stood up for what he 
believed in and always put his west 
Tennessee family values first. 
I am honored to call Andy Holt a 
friend of mine. He truly understands 
and cares about the needs of Ten-
nesseans, and he will be sorely missed 
in the Tennessee State legislature. 
Roberta and I wish Andy, his wife, 
Ellie, and his entire family well as he 
leaves the stage of public service. I 
thank Andy for his faithful service to 
west Tennessee, to Tennessee State 
government, and to the State of Ten-
nessee. 
HONORING MRS. SUZETTE MINK’S PUBLIC 
SERVICE TO WEST TENNESSEE 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Su-
zette Mink, from Millington, Ten-
nessee, for her strong service to Shelby 
County government as she is set to re-
tire in a few weeks. 
Suzette’s service to Memphis and 
Shelby County started in 1985 when she 
began working for the Shelby County 
Trustee’s 
Office.

sessions court clerk, the general ses-
sions criminal court judges’ office, and 
then the general sessions civil court 
judges’ office, where she will retire 
after 17 years of faithful service to 
these judges. 
In 2019, Shelby County Mayor Lee 
Harris

the 
Shelby County Shining Star Award. 
This award is given to someone who 
has shown exemplary dedication to 
their job within Shelby County govern-
ment, and this award was much de-
served. 
I know I speak on behalf of all of 
Memphis and Shelby County, and the 
judges, when I thank Suzette for her 
service to our community. When I 
think of true public servants, we talk 
about people like Suzette. 
I wish her and her husband, Derrick,

HONORING VETERANS COMMUNITY 
LIVING CENTER AT FITZSIMONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the staff and residents of 
the Veterans Community Living Cen-
ter in Aurora, Colorado. This Colorado 
veterans home has cared for veterans, 
veteran spouses, and Gold Star parents 
for over 18 years. 
The staff at Fitzsimons has acted he-
roically during this pandemic, risking 
exposure, facing fears, and continuing 
to show up for their residents and co-
workers. Since March, 26 employees 
have tested positive, and most have re-
turned to work. 
This dedicated team has pioneered 
new ways of connecting veterans to 
their communities, including drive-by 
vintage car shows and coordinating 
phone calls and Skype visits with fam-
ily and friends. 
We do mourn the loss of 25 veterans 
who lost their lives to the virus and 
celebrate the lifetime of selfless service 
all veterans who live at Fitzsimons 
have made. 
It is with pride that I recognize the 
staff and residents at the Veterans 
Community 
Living 
Center 
at 
Fitzsimons. 
RECOGNIZING SALUD FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS’ 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Salud Family Health 
Centers on its 50th anniversary. 
Salud was founded in 1970 to serve 
the migrant and seasonal farmworker 
population living and working in and 
around Fort Lupton, Colorado. Today, 
Salud operates 13 clinics and a mobile 
unit in 10 predominantly rural commu-
nities throughout northern and south-
eastern Colorado, serving over 82,000 
patients annually. 
Salud has grown to provide medical, 
dental, 
behavioral 
health, 
women’s 
care, pediatric care, and on-site phar-
macy services. Prior to COVID, Salud 
also operated 11 school-based sites to 
better serve the needs of the commu-
nity. 
Salud’s mobile unit travels mostly 
rural areas during the evenings to pro-
vide quality healthcare to seasonal and 
migrant workers. In its 50 years, Salud 
has served 2 million patients. 
I am proud to have Salud Family 
Health Centers serving the people of 
the Sixth Congressional District. 
APPLAUDING AURORA MOBILE FOOD PANTRY 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as we observe Hunger Action Month 
throughout September to applaud the 
work of the Aurora Mobile Food Pan-
try. 
While the food pantry is a crucial 
support system to our community at 
the best of times, it has been a lifeline 
to those experiencing hunger during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This summer, Aurora Mobile Food 
Pantry and its community partners, 
along with over 750 volunteers, pro-
vided more than 475,000 meals to our 
community. In addition to providing 
healthy food, more than 30,000 commu-
nity members who visited the mobile 
food pantry received 37,000 pounds of 
pet food, 2,800 books for children, 5,400 
water bottles, and $47,000 worth of dia-
pers and baby wipes. 
All told, the Aurora Mobile Food 
Pantry has provided more than $1 mil-
lion in food to our community during 
COVID–19. It serves as a reminder of 
what can happen when Coloradans 
come together to support one another 
in times of need. 
RECOGNIZING HEROISM OF MANJIT SINGH 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Manjit Singh. 
Manjit Singh immigrated to my dis-
trict from India in 2018 in search of the 
American Dream. On Wednesday, Au-
gust 5, Manjit died a hero. 
After his first day of truck driving 
school, Manjit was with his family and 
friends at Reedley Beach near his new 
home in California. He saw three chil-
dren caught in the current of the Kings 
River and selflessly rushed in to help 
them. 
Manjit did not know how to swim, 
but he knew bravery. Witnesses say he 
helped pull one of the three children to 
safety and endeavored to assist an-
other. 
While all of them have recovered, an 
8-year-old girl named Samantha would 
later lose her life. I grieve for her and 
her family. 
I stand amazed by Manjit’s sacrifice, 
and I am grateful to his community for 
recognizing 
the 
heroism 
he 
dem-
onstrated that day. I am inspired by 
the humanity and compassion that 
link all of us together.

DELAYED DIAGNOSIS DUE TO 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, during the coronavirus pan-
demic, American doctors, nurses, tech-
nicians, and first responders have cared 
for patients day in and day out. On the 
front lines, medical teams have worked 
tirelessly to care for the coronavirus 
patients 
under 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances. 
Across the country, we formed a 
united front against an invisible enemy 
as medical professions of all stripes 
pitched in to help, from volunteering 
their time to donating valuable per-
sonal protective equipment to the 
emergency rooms, the hospitals, and 
the organizations that needed it the 
most. 
As Americans were asked to stay at 
home, teams quickly transitioned to 
telemedicine to provide vital care to 
vulnerable populations. They took the 
initiative and developed creative solu-
tions to ensure that patients could re-
ceive the care that they so much need. 
During this crisis, America’s medical 
community has stepped up during and 
throughout to provide care and save 
lives. They truly, too, are heroes. 
Now, the work continues. We must 
acknowledge a secondary healthcare 
crisis that is occurring in our Nation. 
Beginning in March, many hospitals, 
under the direction of national, State, 
and local authorities, postponed elec-
tive procedures with the goal of slow-
ing the spread of the virus and saving 
the precious PPE and supplies for those 
who needed it the most. 
Americans, following stay-at-home 
orders, 
delayed 
important 
medical 
care, and subsequently, too many have 
suffered negative healthcare outcomes 
that could have been prevented. 
Earlier this spring, I wrote a letter to 
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, urg-
ing him and his administration to 
prioritize the comprehensive health 
needs of all Pennsylvanians during this 
crisis. 
In my experience alone, I have heard 
tragic stories from colleagues whose 
patients have died from cardiac emer-
gencies, from drug overdoses, and from 
other negative outcomes that could 
have been prevented. 
Six months into this crisis, we are 
facing an imminent need to restore 
America’s full access to care, including 
preventive screenings. 
My good friend and colleague, Dr. 
Bruce 
Waldholtz, 
is 
a 
gastro-
enterologist and also a longtime volun-
teer leader of the American Cancer So-
ciety. Dr. Waldholtz, as a cancer sur-
vivor himself, understands firsthand 
that a doctor, a patient, needs prevent-
ative healthcare. 
As he told me this week: ‘‘Due to the 
COVID restrictions, all nonemergency 
colonoscopies were canceled for several 
months. Literally, hundreds of patients 
in our practice had their colonoscopies 
canceled. This delay, compounded na-
tionally, will result in less screening 
and an increase in colon cancer cases 
right now and in years ahead.’’ 
Colonoscopies and other preventative 
screenings save lives. Elective proce-
dures are not unnecessary, and in

many cases, they find disease early be-
fore they can become metastatic and 
cancerous and spread. 
Today, many doctors are playing 
catch-up as they seek to safely provide 
care to their patients. As I said, the 
work continues. 
I urge Americans: Talk to your doc-
tors 
and 
schedule 
the 
lifesaving 
screenings that can definitely make a 
difference in your healthcare. 
As 
we 
continue 
to 
combat 
the 
coronavirus crisis and its many rami-
fications, I thank our medical teams 
for their unwavering dedication to 
American patients. Despite the obsta-
cles we face, together, we can improve 
Americans’ 
access 
to 
the 
quality 
healthcare and, together, we can save 
lives.

RECOGNIZING TOM SEAVER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to one of the greatest 
baseball players to ever play the game, 
‘‘Tom Terrific’’ Seaver, a member of 
the Miracle Memorable Mets cham-
pionship season in 1969 that won the 
World Series. He passed away peace-
fully earlier this month. 
A native of my hometown, Fresno, 
California, that has had a lot of terrific 
baseball players, no one ever played 
the game any better than Tom Terrific. 
He was a graduate of Fresno High and 
Fresno City College. During that time, 
he became a first-round draft pick in 
1966. But in between that time, he 
served in the United States Marine 
Corps. 
Of the many seasons that he played 
in baseball, he had 12 All-Star appear-
ances, won multiple Cy Young Awards, 
and was voted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame when he first became available 
on a near-unanimous decision—a gifted 
and once-in-a-lifetime player. 
As I said, he served honorably in the 
Marine Corps. 
Last year, he retired from public life 
after being diagnosed with dementia. 
His passing has been a terrible loss for 
the community of Fresno and all base-
ball fans across the country. 
Please join me in celebrating the life 
and career of one good person, Tom 
Seaver. 
DEVASTATING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
today to draw attention to the dev-
astating wildfires burning in the West, 
throughout Washington, Oregon, and 
California, and other Western States, 
and, more precisely, this fire, the 
Creek fire, that is burning near my dis-
trict in the central Sierra Nevada. 
Let me first salute the incredible 
men and women, the firefighters, the 
first responders, all of those volunteers 
who are doing their best, over 14,000 of 
them throughout California, and many 
more throughout Western States. They 
are putting their lives on the line try-
ing to protect us and trying to protect 
our forests. 
Last Friday, I toured the devastation 
firsthand and spent 6 hours in the 
southern perimeter of the Creek fire in 
the Shaver and Huntington Lake areas. 
I witnessed the devastating damage 
that has been done, not only in this 
picture that is illustrated here, but the 
many homes that have been lost, as 
you 
see 
here, 
1400-degree 
tornado 
firestorms that literally melted homes, 
such as this one here, and many, many 
other structures. 
This summer alone, clearly, has indi-
cated that the numbers of fires that we 
see, 
not 
only 
in 
California, 
but 
throughout the West, are growing both 
in quantity and the scope of the devas-
tation. This summer alone, with record 
heat and extreme conditions made 
worse by climate change, California 
has experienced 6 of the largest 20 
wildfires in its history—and, sadly, 
most of those wildfires are still burn-
ing. 
In the foothills in the high Sierra Ne-
vada outside my home in Fresno, Cali-
fornia, the Creek fire continues to 
grow, and we only have, as of today, 
about 15 percent containment. But that 
is similar not only in California but Or-
egon and Washington and other States, 
and it is making the air quality some-
thing that you have to see to under-
stand and believe. When I left Monday, 
the air index was 304. 
So, what must we do? 
We must learn the lessons from these 
devastating fires, these wildfires. And I 
think, first of all, it requires much bet-
ter forest management. We have tried 
to make changes within the U.S. For-
est Service, but much more needs to be 
done in terms of resources to better 
manage our forest. 
We also must do better land manage-
ment planning. We have hundreds and 
thousands of people in the last 30 years 
living where they didn’t live before, 
and it requires better land use plan-
ning. 
And, finally, we must address the 
issues of climate change. When we have 
extended draught periods and dry con-
ditions, the beetle bark and other fac-
tors play into a situation which, in 
California, from Lassen down to Lake 
Isabella, we have over 100 million dead 
trees, and that creates the fuel that 
adds to the problem. 
These are among the lessons that we 
must learn to better manage our for-
ests for future generations to come. 
f 
TREES ARE TRULY AMAZING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the trees, the 
forest they call home, and all Ameri-
cans who live near there. 
In the words of the poet Joyce Kil-
mer: 
I think that I shall never see 
A poem as lovely as a tree. 
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed 
Against the Earth’s sweet flowing breast. 
A tree that looks at God all day 
And lifts her leaf-filled arms to pray. 
A tree that may in summer wear 
A nest of robins in her hair. 
Upon whose bosom snow has lain, 
Who’s intimately lived with rain. 
Poems are made by folks like me, 
But only God can make a tree. 
Mr. Speaker, trees are truly amazing. 
Through the remarkable process of 
photosynthesis, trees take in carbon 
dioxide. They store the carbon in the 
wood, and they release the oxygen back 
for us to breathe. Trees provide us with 
clean air. 
But just as important as clean air, 
trees provide us with clean water. 
Their roots hold the soil together, and 
as water percolates through, they clean 
the water. 
Forests also provide wildlife habitat. 
They provide us places for outdoor 
recreation. 
Trees 
provide 
amazing 
green building products, like mass tim-
ber. Trees provide packaging for ship-
ping. And let us not forget where toilet 
paper comes from. 
No wonder trees are so admired, as 
they should be. However, our beloved 
trees and forests in the West have a dif-
ferent image today, one not of gran-
deur and amazing beauty, but one of 
fuel in an apocalyptic inferno that is 
killing people, destroying homes and 
property, and leaving barren land-
scapes below and choking smoke above. 
Mr. Speaker, unlike the mythical 
Ents of middle-earth in the ‘‘Lord of 
the Rings,’’ our trees cannot speak for 
themselves. I don’t claim to be Dr. 
Seuss’ Lorax, but if trees could talk, I 
believe they would be crying out: Hey, 
humans, stop loving us to death. Hey, 
humans, we need some relief, and you 
are supposed to be taking care of us. 
Hey, Congress, you are killing us, and 
if we die, you die. Please work together 
and apply your husbandry skills to give 
us a chance. When trees win, humans 
win. 
Mr. Speaker, even as the climate 
changes and fire threats increase in the 
West, there is hope if we will just do 
the right thing. That right thing is for-
est management, and it looks different 
on different sites. 
Here is an example of how it looks in 
my home State of Arkansas. This is 
the Felsenthal National Wildlife Man-
agement 
area. 
You 
can 
see 
an 
unmanaged forest, the control site. 
You see the thick underbrush, the 
midstory and the understory that is 
too thick. You see the simple manage-
ment practices of thinning out the un-
derstory, doing controlled burns, and 
at the bottom you see what a beautiful, 
healthy forest looks like. 
Here is an example of how it looks in 
California. This is an aerial shot from 
the devastating Camp fire near Para-
dise. This red hatched area, that is 
where the fire burned. This dark red 
line, that is where the fire was stopped. 
You can see this little band right 
here. That was actually a firebreak

that was put in place by a private for-
estry company to stop the spread of 
fire onto their land because public 
lands are so mismanaged. 
Here is what that firebreak looked 
like. It was a thinned area where the 
fire came in from this direction. It 
went down to the ground, and firemen 
were actually able to put it out and 
save the forest on the other side. 
That is what sound forest manage-
ment looks like. This is not clear-cut-
ting. It is commonsense, science-based 
management that works. 
Mr. Speaker, now is the time to act— 
not after the election, not the next 
Congress, but now. In the Trillion 
Trees Act, we have outlined policies to 
implement the most basic forest man-
agement practices to the four most 
critical areas: 
The wildland urban interface where 
fire can start, but where breaks can be 
created and we can thin; 
Energy transportation corridors. We 
know fires can start from electric arcs; 
Transportation 
corridors, 
where 
trains and cars can create sparks and 
where more humans are near the for-
est; 
And last but not least, in critical wa-
tersheds where the damage is felt long 
after the fires are out. 
For the sake of our forests, our envi-
ronment, and all Americans, I urge 
Congress to act. Pass the Trillion Trees 
Act, and let’s be the good stewards that 
the trees deserve.

STAND UP FOR SCIENTIFIC 
INTEGRITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JOHNSON) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
we woke up this morning to another 
1,000 souls lost to coronavirus and the 
Western States are ablaze. Our most 
powerful weapon for combating these 
threats is rigorous, unbiased science. 
And yet this administration continues 
to suppress and misrepresent the work 
of our Federal scientists. 
HHS officials appear to be tampering 
with public health bulletins to suit 
their political narrative. EPA is mis-
representing its own analysts’ work to 
absolve polluters. And just yesterday, 
the President claimed that science 
doesn’t know about the impacts of cli-
mate change. 
If science doesn’t know, who does? 
This cannot go on. My committee has 
been fighting back. Among other ini-
tiatives, we have passed the Scientific 
Integrity Act to make sure that Fed-
eral science is not distorted by politics 
or special interests, no matter who is 
in the White House. 
As we work to make this bill a law, 
I commend all of our Federal scientists 
who remain objective, exacting, and 
transparent in their research: Don’t 
quit. Continue to stand up to scientific 
integrity. Your country needs you. We 
all do.

HONORING HEALTHCARE HEROES 
AND FRONTLINE WORKERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor our valiant 
frontline workers and healthcare he-
roes who have taken care of their 
neighbors and saved countless lives 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. This 
includes nurses, doctors, pharmacists, 
grocery store workers, truck drivers, 
and anyone who has risen to the occa-
sion to help others during these un-
precedented times. 
In particular, Jane Spence, Larisa 
Barnes, Bobbie Sumner, Amanda King, 
and Lynn Reynolds have exemplified 
remarkable selflessness and courage as 
they work to save lives in the South-
east Georgia Health System. 
Throughout my time in Georgia’s 
First Congressional District, I have 
visited and met countless heroes serv-
ing at Saint Joseph’s Candler Hospital, 
Liberty 
Regional 
Medical 
Center, 
Clinch Memorial Hospital, Memorial 
Health Center in Savannah, Wayne Me-
morial Center, and Winn Army Medical 
Hospital. This has allowed me to gain 
insight into the daily sacrifices they 
make and their commitment to serving 
their communities. 
Doctors and nurses who serve at our 
Veterans Affairs Health Systems are 
deserving of recognition for their out-
standing work, as well. 
In addition to our healthcare heroes, 
I also want to honor leaders and local 
businesses in our communities. 
Individuals like Tom and Rita Boland 
converted their Island Drapes and Up-
holstery business to manufacture thou-
sands of face masks a week. 
I was also encouraged to see the local 
nonprofits in Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District rise up to address the 
many challenges from the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Specifically, the Computers for a 
Cause movement was formed thanks to 
the beautiful work of United Way of 
Coastal Georgia, Keep Golden Isles 
Beautiful, Communities in Schools, 
and Coastal Outreach partnering with 
Coastal Computer Consulting to gather 
and donate computers for children who 
don’t have access to one. 
This allowed countless children to 
continue their education when schools 
were closed. These folks were working 
day in and day out risking their own 
health and safety and spending time 
away from their families and friends to 
serve us. 
I want to express my deep gratitude 
for the work that they do to make 
America great, and I am honored to 
call them my friends and neighbors. 
HONORING PRESTON G. EXLEY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Mr. Preston Exley of Spring-
field, Georgia, who passed away at the 
age of 81 on September 10. 
Mr. Exley was a selfless leader in 
every area of his life who was loved by 
many. 
Mr. Exley worked for the Savannah 
Sugar Refinery for 40 years and retired 
in 1997. 
Preston loved the Lord, and his life 
was a testament to that. Preston was 
an active member of Holy Trinity Lu-
theran Church and served in a variety 
of roles, including Sunday school su-
perintendent, president of the Men’s 
Group, and a member of the Church 
Council. 
Preston was committed to serving 
his country through his service with 
the Georgia Army National Guard for 
23 years, and he retired as a captain. 
Preston was also dedicated to im-
proving education in his community 
during 
his 
time 
serving 
on 
the 
Effingham County School Board from 
1980 until 1994, and he later went on to 
serve as Effingham County Chief Mag-
istrate Judge for 12 years. 
Included in his long list of pursuits, 
Preston was a farmer for many years in 
his home place in Clyo. 
Impressively, Preston was past presi-
dent of the Effingham County Young 
Farmers, a member of the County 
Board of Directors, and served as the 
Springfield Chapter President. 
Preston was also a loyal family man, 
who prioritized his family above all 
else. 
I am thankful for the selfless life 
Preston lived, and I know his legacy 
will continue in Springfield for years 
to come. My thoughts and prayers go 
out to his family, friends, and all who 
knew him during these challenging 
times.

RESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following communication: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
OFFICE OF THE PARLIAMENTARIAN, 
Washington, DC, September 11, 2020. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I am writing to in-
form you of my retirement as Parliamen-
tarian of the House, effective September 30, 
2020. It has been a great honor to serve the 
House for more than 25 years. I am especially 
grateful for the privilege of working with a 
professional and inspiring team of col-
leagues. 
In addition to the daily counsel provided in 
the chamber of this august body, our office’s 
role in assisting the invaluable work of the 
House Democracy Partnership is a source of 
particular pride. The contributions of the 
HDP to legislative strengthening and demo-
cratic reform have made a lasting impact 
across the globe. The support provided by 
successive Speakers and the tireless work of 
Representative Price and the other members 
of the HDP are manifested in the remarkable 
strides witnessed in the now 21 partner coun-
tries. 
I have been humbled to be part of the of-
fice’s tradition of nonpartisan education and 
scholarship about the procedures and history 
of this House—the body closest to the people 
in our Federal government. From complying 
with the statutory requirement to publish 
the parliamentary precedents to hours spent 
in the Hall of the House with Members, stu-
dents, and visitors, the office has been stead-
fast in our commitment to transparency in 
the ‘‘People’s House.’’ This commitment is 
the bedrock of our democratic tradition. 
Finally, I thank my wife and family for 
their love and support during my tenure. 
Sincerely yours, 
THOMAS J. WICKHAM, Jr.

HONORING JAMES BUTLER III 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
SLOTKIN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to remember James Butler 
III of East Lansing, Michigan. 
Lovingly known as the Godfather of 
Lansing, Mr. Butler lived a life of serv-
ice that began when he was born into a 
Navy family in 1943. 
His achievements speak for them-
selves. He was called to serve in the 
Army, finishing top of his class as a 
noncommissioned 
officer 
at 
Fort 
Benning. He served in Vietnam, earn-
ing two Purple Hearts and four Bronze 
Stars for heroism in combat. 
However, if you really want to know 
who James Butler was, listen to the 
words he promised while serving: ‘‘If I 
make it back, I will give back.’’ 
Well, he made it back, and he spent 
the next 30 years working at IBM, mov-
ing to Michigan and breaking barriers 
as the first Black man to hold an exec-
utive-level position at the company. 
Even in retirement, Mr. Butler an-
swered the call to serve, working under 
former Governor Granholm as the di-
rector of the Michigan Broadband De-
velopment Authority. 
In short, Mr. Butler lived a life of 
giving back. For his work, he was rec-
ognized by too many organizations to 
list at this time. 
But for those who knew him best, 
Rishan, his wife of 52 years, his three 
kids and seven grandkids, he was a 
good and kind man, and he will be 
dearly missed by all.

CONDEMN LAWLESSNESS AND 
STAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
cannot believe that this week, under 
the leadership of my colleagues on the 
Democrat side, under Speaker PELOSI, 
we are actually going to vote on a reso-
lution condemning people for using the 
place of origin to distinguish this novel 
virus. We are going to use our time and 
the formal declaration of this great 
body to do that instead of condemning 
the lawlessness and the violence that is 
ravaging our once-great American cit-
ies. 
I think that is unacceptable by all 
standards. I think we have plenty of 
opportunity to stand with our law en-
forcement officers who risk their lives, 
the law-abiding citizens who are having 
their rights trampled, and say no more. 
I have the David Dorn Act and the 
Patrick Underwood Act. Both men 
died, being murdered in cold blood by 
these violent protesters. This would in-
crease penalties and accountability for 
the folks who consider even thinking 
about doing that in the future. 
We also have a resolution to condemn 
this lawlessness. I hope my colleagues 
can join me on that.

MARKING ADDICTION AND 
RECOVERY MONTH 
(Mr. TRONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, one in 
seven people will experience addiction 
in their lifetime. 
Last year, over 70,000 people died 
from a drug overdose. Over the last 3 
years, it is over 200,000 people. 
Addiction is a national crisis for 
which we will not find a vaccine. 
Last week, I spoke with patients in 
recovery across western Maryland. The 
reality of COVID–19 is making recovery 
much harder. 
Today, we are coming together in 
Congress as Team America for a day of 
action we are calling Congress Goes 
Purple. 
Together, we are wearing purple to 
show our support for those in recovery. 
Together, we are raising awareness to 
combat the stigma around addiction. 
And together, we will do everything we 
can to support those in recovery. 
Madam Speaker, to those in recov-
ery, never be afraid to speak up and 
ask for help.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
PROS-
TATE 
CANCER 
AWARENESS 
MONTH 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize September as 
National Prostate Cancer Awareness 
Month. 
This year, an estimated 191,930 men 
in our Nation will be diagnosed with 
prostate cancer. 
As a survivor of this disease, I know 
firsthand the challenges families face 
when they decide which testing, treat-
ments, and coverage options are right 
for them. 
That is why I proudly support legis-
lation like the Preexisting Protections 
Act to ensure those with preexisting 
conditions have access to affordable 
care. 
Prostate cancer is the most common 
cancer among American men, but the 
good news is that as innovation and 
technology continue to evolve, fewer 
men are dying after the diagnosis.

BEING BETTER STEWARDS OF 
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, 
natural 
disasters 
ripping 
through the Nation today are urgent 
reminders that we must be better stew-
ards of the natural environment, in-
cluding the Great Lakes. 
Yet, recent actions of the Trump ad-
ministration’s Environmental Protec-
tion Agency do just the opposite. 
In August, the EPA issued a rule al-
lowing the release of toxic metals, like 
arsenic and mercury, into lakes, rivers, 
and streams near power plants that use 
them. 
This is the wrong strategy and is bad 
for America and bad for Americans. 
For decades, communities across west-
ern New York have been working to-
gether to bring back waterways, like 
the Buffalo River, that were once de-
clared ecologically dead due to toxic 
industrial pollution. 
Successful efforts like the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative solidified 
the Federal role to improve water qual-
ity in the Great Lakes, restore aquatic 
habitat, and provide new recreational 
opportunities for all. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose 
the EPA’s destructive policies, and I 
urge my colleagues to recommit them-
selves to prioritizing long-term sus-
tainability of the natural environment.

HONORING EDWARD M. 
BARTHOLOMEW, JR. 
(Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Edward M. Bar-
tholomew, Jr., for his life of service to 
the city of Glens Falls, Warren County, 
and the entire north country region. 
Ed served in many important roles 
over the course of his over-40-year ca-
reer. He was elected mayor of the city 
of Glens Falls at the age of 28. He set 
to work revitalizing the community, 
making the civic center a success, 
building a modern baseball park, im-
proving critical infrastructure, and es-
tablishing the Greater Glens Falls 
Transit System. 
He cemented his reputation as some-
one who can grasp all aspects of a chal-
lenge and accomplish his objectives de-
spite daunting obstacles. 
In 2010, after spending time in the 
State senate, Ed returned to lead the 
Economic Development Corporation of 
Warren County, where he had been 
working 
tirelessly 
throughout 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Ed Bartholomew was an extraor-
dinary leader for the Warren County 
community and beyond. He was an ab-
solute joy and privilege to work with, 
and he will be sorely missed. 
I am honored to recognize his leader-
ship in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on 
behalf of New York’s 21st Congres-
sional District. Our prayers go out to 
his friends and family during this dif-
ficult time.

CELEBRATING PHILADELPHIA GAY 
NEWS 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate one of the long-
est running weekly newspapers in 
Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Gay 
News, which has been dedicated to lift-
ing the voices of the LGBTQ commu-
nity since 1976. 
PGN was founded by a pioneer for the 
LGBTQ community, Mark Segal, and 
has provided reliable and accessible 
news ever since. 
PGN has been at the heart of the 
fight for equality, diving into the chal-
lenges facing LGBTQ people and lifting 
up their vices. 
At the height of the HIV/AIDS epi-
demic, PGN was vital to ensuring peo-
ple had the information and resources 
they needed to make informed deci-
sions about their safety, health, and 
well-being. 
Today, PGN is the largest East Coast 
LGBTQ newspaper, with over 25,000 
weekly readers. In a recent interview, 
Mr. Segal said that this journey was 
not without struggle. ‘‘At times, we 
had to fight to keep the doors open,’’ 
but PGN pressed on. 
In March, PGN was awarded a histor-
ical marker to honor the remarkable 
impact this paper has had. Just last 
week, PGN was awarded the best over-
all nondaily newspaper by the Society 
of Professional Journalists. 
We are grateful for the leadership of 
Philadelphia Gay News and its founder, 
Mark Segal. 
To the entire PGN family, congratu-
lations, and keep making good trouble.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
FARIS VIRANI 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, in his 9 
years with us, Faris Virani used his 
short life to paint a masterpiece. 
At 6 years old, he was told he had 
Ewing sarcoma, a deadly, aggressive 
form of childhood cancer. He never 
complained or asked, ‘‘Why me?’’ He 
was thankful to God for the gift of life. 
When his family and friends felt 
down, he picked them up with his 
trademark line, ‘‘Let’s go with the 
flow.’’ Faris and his mom, Asha, going 
with the flow. 
He knew his short life was going to 
make this world better, and that life 
became the force behind his Ewing Sar-
coma Center at Texas Children’s Hos-
pital that bears his name. 
He was frustrated that every Sep-
tember Childhood Cancer Awareness 
Month and its gold color were largely 
forgotten by the American people. He 
said: ‘‘Mom, when I grow up, I will let 
there be gold.’’ 
Faris, we hear you and, in unison, we 
say, ‘‘Let there be gold.’’ 
In closing, Madam Speaker, I will 
say, in memory of Faris, please, let 
there be gold. Celebrate this young 
man’s life. 
God bless Faris Virani.

Normandia Maldonado, an icon in Do-
minican culture, and my bill, H.R. 3870, 
which renames the post office located

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
CARLTON HASELRIG 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the memory of an amazing Johnstown, 
Cambria 
County 
native, 
Carlton 
Haselrig. 
An incredibly accomplished athlete, 
Carlton excelled in both wrestling and 
football. In high school, he was an 
undefeated wrestler and State cham-
pion. 
At the University of Pittsburgh- 
Johnstown, Haselrig became the most 
decorated wrestler in NCAA history, 
with a total of six NCAA national 
championships. 
In 1989, Haselrig was drafted by the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, despite never hav-
ing played in a college football game. 
Haselrig returned home to coach 
football 
and 
wrestling 
at 
Greater 
Johnstown, his high school. He dedi-
cated his time to the youth in his com-
munity, openly talking about his past 
struggles with addiction and mentoring 
hundreds. 
His wife said: ‘‘He never wanted to be 
the star that he became. He just want-
ed to be Carlton Haselrig from Johns-
town—a family man, a husband, and a 
dad.’’ 
Sadly, Haselrig passed away this 
summer. Even in death, Haselrig con-
tinues to give back, having donated his 
brain 
for 
chronic 
traumatic 
encephalopathy research. 
May God bless Carlton and his fam-
ily.

SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement 
Act. This legislation will restore the 
right of students and parents to ad-
dress 
racial 
inequities 
in 
public 
schools. 
This legislation comes over 66 years 
after the Supreme Court ruled in 1954, 
in the Brown v. Board of Education 
case, that in the field of education, the 
doctrine of separate but equal has no 
place. Separate educational facilities 
are inherently unequal. 
This comes just 4 years after the 
General Accountability Office found 
that 
racial 
segregation 
in 
public 
schools is now as bad it was in the 1960s 
and getting worse. 
For almost 40 years, the courts inter-
preted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
title VI, as granting students and par-
ents the right to bring discrimination 
claims against public schools and any 
other entities receiving Federal funds 
for discriminatory policies and prac-
tices. 
Victims of federally funded discrimi-
nation could use title VI to challenge 
both discriminatory policies and prac-
tices that were created with the intent 
to discriminate and policies and prac-
tices that, while neutral on their face, 
had the effect of discrimination on the 
basis of race, color, or national origin. 
To be clear, the mere presence of the 
policy’s disproportionate impact does 
not alone constitute a violation of title 
VI, but allowing communities to use 
disparate impact analysis equipped 
them with an important tool to combat 
systemic inequities for decades. 
Unfortunately, in its 2001 decision in 
the case of Alexander v. Sandoval, the 
Supreme Court stripped private citi-
zens, including students and parents, of 
their right to bring disparate impact 
claims against schools and other feder-
ally funded programs. While this ruling 
did not invalidate the use of disparate 
impact analysis to prove discrimina-
tion, it reserved that power to pursue 
such claims to the Federal Government 
through administrative enforcement of

September 16, 2020 
title VI. In other words, this long-
standing protection against discrimi-
nation in federally funded programs, 
including education, can now only be 
enforced if the administration in power 
so chooses. 
The effect of this ruling on anti-
discrimination enforcement has been 
particularly acute in education. Since 
2001, we have seen an increase in racial 
isolation in public schools and a de-
crease in resource equity. As a result, 
African-American and Hispanic chil-
dren disproportionately attend schools 
that are both majority minority and 
underresourced. 
Whether this trend has been inten-
tional or not is immaterial, but we do 
know that discrimination in 2020 is not 
the same as it was in 1964. Discrimina-
tion increasingly comes in the form of 
coded terminology, structural inequal-
ity, and implicit bias rather than ex-
plicit bigotry. So students and parents 
must be empowered to hold schools ac-
countable for policies and practices 
that deny students access to quality 
education based on their race, color, or 
national origin whether or not they 
can prove the discriminatory policies 
were intentionally imposed. 
Understandably, parents and stu-
dents have been expressing confusion 
and frustration because they can no 
longer use the Civil Rights Act to chal-
lenge discriminatory policies and prac-
tices in their schools. 
b 1030 
By ceding this right to the Federal 
Government, the Supreme Court ma-
jority in Sandoval opened the door to 
civil rights enforcement becoming a 
political issue instead of a right. While 
the Office of Civil Rights, the OCR, at 
the Department of Education is staffed 
with career attorneys, it is led by a po-
litical appointee. This department has 
repeatedly shown its reluctance to en-
force and defend the civil rights of all 
students. 
Our core civil rights protections 
should not be up for a vote every 4 
years. To that end, the Equity and In-
clusion Enforcement Act would restore 
the private right of action of students 
and parents to bring a title VI dis-
crimination claim based on disparate 
impact and hold schools accountable 
for providing equal access to quality 
education for all students. 
The legislation also requires school 
districts and institutions of higher 
learning to appoint a title VI monitor 
to ensure that at least one employee is 
responsible for ensuring compliance 
with the law. This includes, at a min-
imum, investigating complaints of dis-
crimination based on race, color, or na-
tional origin. This provision in the bill 
is modeled after title IX officers in 
school settings. The legislation’s aim is 
for title VI monitors to foster a culture 
of compliance, similar to what we now 
have under title IX. 
Finally, the bill creates an assistant 
secretary in the Department of Edu-
cation to coordinate and promote title 
VI compliance. History has shown that 
we cannot support historically dis-
advantaged students or close persistent 
achievement gaps without robust civil 
rights enforcement. This is particu-
larly true as public schools become 
more segregated, more segregated than 
they were in the 1960s and as the 
COVID–19 pandemic exacerbates in-
equitable access to quality education 
for underserved students. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
restore and strengthen critical civil 
rights protections by passing the Eq-
uity and Inclusion Enforcement Act. 
Nearly seven decades after the Su-
preme Court’s landmark decision in 
Brown v. Board of Education which 
struck down school segregation, this 
bill would bring us one step closer to 
delivering on its promise of equity in 
education. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 2574, the Equity and In-
clusion Enforcement Act. 
My Republican and Democrat col-
leagues agree that separate is not and 
never was equal; racism is wrong; seg-
regation is wrong. I am going to repeat 
that. My Republican and Democrat col-
leagues agree that separation is not 
and never was equal; racism is wrong; 
segregation is wrong. Although this 
body has taken measures to ensure rac-
ism and segregation are not to be toler-
ated, its lingering effects still persist. 
We continue to strive toward a future 
where all students, regardless of race 
or color, have the chance to succeed. 
While there is more work to be done, 
the bill before us takes the wrong ap-
proach. This bill seeks to create a pri-
vate right of action for disparate im-
pact claims under section 602 of title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title 
VI protects federally funded programs 
and entities from discriminating on the 
basis of race, color, or national origin. 
While the Democrats will falsely 
characterize this bill as restoring a 
right—and, indeed, my colleague has 
just done that—in reality this bill radi-
cally alters civil rights law without 
giving any consideration to its poten-
tial ramifications. 
The 
leftist 
Center 
for 
American 
Progress called title VI and disparate 
income impact claims the ‘‘sleeping 
giant of civil rights laws’’ that are a 
‘‘potentially powerful tool’’ to advance 
liberal goals through activist litiga-
tion. 
While title VI is most used in the 
context of education, the law itself is 
not confined to that issue. Title VI ap-
plies to any program or entity that re-
ceives Federal funding, which would in-
clude education, policing, employment, 
and healthcare, the list goes on and on. 
This is more than an education bill. 
Despite its far-reaching implications, 
Democrats deprived the committee of 
primary jurisdiction any opportunity 
to debate or consider this bill. That is 
a really important point to consider, 
Madam Speaker. 
As the Republican leader of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, the con-
sequences of this legislation within the 
education community are very clear. 
The creation of a private right of ac-
tion would lead to additional burdens 
on already taxed State and local agen-
cies, especially school systems who 
would 
have 
to 
defend 
themselves 
against tenuous allegations advanced 
by parents and activists. Through such 
lawsuits, these activists could require 
State and local governments to adopt a 
myriad of policies that Congress and 
State and local lawmakers never au-
thorized or intended and cost those en-
tities a lot of money paid to trial law-
yers. 
H.R. 2574 also creates a new special 
assistant for equity and inclusion at 
the Department of Education. Rather 
than create multiple siloed positions 
competing for resources and attention, 
committee Republicans believe an inte-
grated approach to the Education De-
partment’s equity and inclusion efforts 
would lead to better results. 
Republicans and Democrats largely 
agree on the importance of equality 
and integrated schools. Unfortunately, 
instead of working toward a bipartisan 
solution, H.R. 2574 is the result of 
Democrats’ choosing a partisan path. 
The question is whether in the long 
run these ideas will have helped or hurt 
the ongoing effort to achieve greater 
equality for children. H.R. 2574 fails on 
this front. Committee Republicans be-
lieve no effort to erase the evil legacy 
of segregation and discrimination can 
be complete without eliminating the 
State’s ability to trap students in low- 
performing schools. 
Instead of debating this bill, we 
should look at bipartisan solutions 
that help expand educational freedom 
for all families. We know that school 
choice gives parents and families the 
opportunity to break the cycle of pov-
erty and enroll their child in an insti-
tution that challenges them, develops 
their skills and intellect, and encour-
ages them to reach higher. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

The gentlewoman is exactly right. 
This 
will 
have 
ramifications 
that 
school districts will have to defend 
longstanding policies where they have 
a clear, provable disparate impact 
against minority children but the par-
ents can’t prove that it was imposed 
with discriminatory intent, and this 
administration 
won’t 
do 
anything 
about it until they are just stuck. 
Yes, if this bill passes, the parents 
will be able to come forth and say that 
the Black children are stuck in woe-
fully inadequate schools while the 
White children are not. Yes, they 
should have to defend themselves if

you can prove it. They ought to have 
their day in court. They can prove that 
the policy is having a disparate impact 
on their children, and according to the 
Sandoval decision they have to wait for 
this Department of Education to do 
something about it. 
On school choice, the recent studies 
have shown that when you don’t very 
carefully regulate it, you can actually 
have more school segregation in school 
choice than you have now. 
The 
question 
on 
achievement 
is 
mixed. There are some studies a few 
years ago that said on average school 
choice produced results that were aver-
age. More recent studies have shown 
that on average school choice produces 
achievement numbers that are worse 
than average. So that is not a road we 
should be going down. We should make 
sure that people, if they prove dis-
crimination, have their day in court. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, our colleagues say 
that this administration is doing noth-
ing to help minority students. One of 
the biggest things that we could do to 
help minority students is to give them 
a choice about where to go to school. 
We talked about this yesterday, and we 
are talking about it again today. Mi-
nority 
students 
thrive 
in 
charter 
schools. Recent test scores show these 
students doing much better. 
Our colleagues are saying that choice 
creates segregation. I don’t believe 
that, Madam Speaker. Choice creates 
the opportunity for success, and we 
know that. The research shows that 
over and over again. We can look at 
New York City and the results that 
Success Academy is getting for the stu-
dents there. They are primarily minor-
ity students—but it is because minor-
ity parents are choosing to send their 
children 
there—and 
they 
are 
suc-
ceeding. They are graduating at a very 
high rate; they are going to college at 
a very high rate. So giving choice to 
children of all races and all economic 
groups results in better achievement. 
That cannot be denied. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the question of seg-
regation of school choice is not what 
the Democrats are saying; it is what 
the studies have shown, that there is 
more likely to be segregation when you 
give people the choice. That is why 
freedom of choice was thrown out by 
the Supreme Court as an answer to 
Brown v. Board of Education many 
years ago. 
You have Whites choosing the White 
schools, Blacks choosing the White 
schools, social isolation taking place, 
and nature taking its course. That is 
why you need the right to integrate the 
schools, and you can’t do it with school 
choice. 
Madam Speaker, I think the question 
is clear. We have a lot of schools where 
the distribution of resources is done 
clearly along racial lines, and because 
you can’t prove that it is with dis-
criminatory intent, you can’t do any-
thing about it. So that is why you need 
the bill, and I would hope that we 
would pass the bill to let those who can 
prove that they are being discrimi-
nated against have their day in court. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I have before me 
some very, very excellent results in 
terms of freedom of choice programs, 
and I would like to share those with 
the body. 
The largest private school choice pro-
gram in America got more solid evi-
dence of its effectiveness Monday. The 
lower-income, mostly minority stu-
dents using the Florida tax credit 
scholarship to attend private schools 
are up to 43 percent more likely to en-
roll in 4-year colleges than White stu-
dents in public schools and up to 20 
percent more likely to earn bachelor’s 
degrees according to a new study re-
leased Monday by the Urban Institute. 
I don’t think the Urban Institute is a 
conservative group. 
The outcomes are even stronger for 
students who use the scholarship 4 or 
more years. Those students are up to 99 
percent more likely to attend a 4-year 
college than their public-school peers 
and up to 45 percent more likely to 
earn bachelor’s degrees. The new find-
ings build on a 2017 study that was the 
first of its kind, but also more limited. 
The previous study found scholarship 
students were more likely to enroll in 
college and earn associate’s degrees, 
but not significantly more likely to 
earn 4-year degrees. However, the 2017 
study included only data from public 
colleges in Florida, and the researchers 
cautioned that as a result our results 
may understate the true impact of FTC 
participation on college enrollment 
and degree attainment. 
Madam Speaker, this is solid evi-
dence that having programs like the 
Florida Student Scholarship Program 
is working for minority and low-in-
come students. And I find it incredible 
that our colleagues continually come 
out on the side of teacher unions, trial 
lawyers, and others who want to see 
gains for themselves but no gains for 
the children they should be serving. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, let me thank Chairman SCOTT 
for his tremendous leadership in put-
ting forth this legislation. But also, 
just for his staying very vigilant as it 
relates to the issues of Black and 
Brown students in our country, and the 
power that we need to push back 
against systemic racism and really 
what it is, is creeping school segrega-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in total sup-
port of H.R. 2574, the Equity and Inclu-
sion Enforcement Act. 
Just a little bit of history of myself. 
I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, 
and schools were segregated when I 
started school. My family fought with 
the NAACP, and I believe El Paso was 
the first city in Texas to desegregate 
public schools. 
Fast forward, my mother, Mildred 
Parish Massey, she was one of the first 
12 students to integrate into the Uni-
versity of Texas at El Paso. I know 
from personal experience the struggles 
and the fights that all of us mounted 
just so we could have access to public 
education. 
And now, fast forward to 2020, seg-
regation in our Nation’s schools is 
growing. 
We have turned the clock back im-
measurably. It can no longer be ig-
nored. Over the last three decades, Af-
rican-American students have increas-
ingly found themselves in intensely 
segregated schools, and we knew un-
raveling segregation in schools was 
going to be a long struggle. This seg-
regation, though, is a product of a 
number of factors, including housing 
segregation, economic inequality, all 
tied to structural racism in our coun-
try. 
But while structural racism pervades 
so many elements of our society, it is 
really especially appalling in edu-
cation, because we know that inte-
grated schools help reduce racial preju-
dice and tension over the years. 
Public education is supposed to be 
the 
great 
leveler 
in 
our 
society. 
Schools are supposed to be the pathway 
where hard work and knowledge pro-
vide new pathways of opportunity. In-
stead, this growing segregation fuels 
the perpetual worsening systemic ra-
cial and ethnic wealth gap that exists 
in our Nation. It robs students of their 
future, and it makes a mockery, really, 
of the values of opportunity and the 
hard work that we hold dear. 
And what I think many of us weren’t 
prepared for was the idea that we were 
going to have to fight tooth and nail 
now, which was a battle we fought in 
the 1950s and 1960s. We are fighting 
those battles again to make our own 
Federal Department of Education take 
this issue seriously. My God. 
Madam Speaker, for three-and-a-half 
years, from my seat on the Committee 
on Appropriations, I have asked Sec-
retary DeVos over and over and over 
again to take this issue seriously. But 
after years of dissembling and delay 
from the Secretary, I have begun to 
question her commitment to ensuring 
the rights of equal education for kids 
in America—that includes Black and 
Brown kids. And I asked her, does she 
really care about the civil rights of 
these young people?

September 16, 2020 
And it is really the refusal by Sec-
retary DeVos to acknowledge the clear 
evidence 
of 
increasing 
segregation. 
This is part of the reason why this bill 
is so important, and we need to act 
today. 
The Equity and Inclusion Enforce-
ment Act is one piece of the puzzle to 
start pushing back on segregation in 
schools. It allows parents of children 
most adversely affected by this grow-
ing racial and ethnic segregation to 
pursue legal action against a local ju-
risdiction to fix the problem. 
Without a private right of action, 
students of color face countless forms 
of irreparable damage without any 
remedy that they can use to seek jus-
tice. 
The bill would further provide that 
education programs that receive Fed-
eral financial assistance must des-
ignate at least one compliance coordi-
nator to focus on reducing segregation 
and investigate complaints. 
And so if we truly want to turn the 
corner, turn the corner on the legacy of 
school segregation and unequal oppor-
tunity, we have a responsibility to put 
power back into the hands of parents 
and students to fight injustice and 
claim their right to a quality public 
education. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will vote for H.R. 2574, and I 
thank the chairman for bringing forth 
this very important bill. I am so sorry 
that we have to do this once again. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I stated in my opening 
comments, Republicans do not believe 
in segregation. Segregation was not 
good for this country. But segregation 
was settled, we believe, despite what 
has been said by our colleagues, by 
Brown v. Board of Education. 
I find it very interesting that this 
bill is about a private right of action 
and, yet, it has become the discussion 
about segregation and about, again, 
Secretary DeVos and what she has or 
has not done. My knowledge of the Sec-
retary is that she has worked all her 
life to expand opportunities for low-in-
come and minority students. That is 
what giving choice to those students 
and those parents is all about—expand-
ing opportunities for them to choose 
where to go to school. And we even 
know that when we expand opportuni-
ties and we have school choice, that 
even the public schools get better. 
I just read statistics about what is 
happening in Florida, the largest place 
for school choice and for scholarships 
for low income and minority students 
to choose where they want to go to 
school. It shows what a great gift that 
has been to them, and how poorly, un-
fortunately, the students in the public 
schools are doing. 
Consigning students to public schools 
and not giving them a choice is not a 
good thing. It is totally unfair. But 
this bill is about a private right of ac-
tion, which the Supreme Court has said 
does not exist in this legislation—the 
legislation that already exists. 
What it is is a gift to trial lawyers. 
And the implication is, from what we 
are hearing, is to go back to unequal 
opportunity. That is not what we want 
for low-income and minority children, 
or any children in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats have 
made a habit of letting bipartisan solu-
tions fall by the wayside in lieu of par-
tisan politics in an attempt to help 
those who help them. The Equity and 
Inclusion Enforcement Act is no excep-
tion. Republicans and Democrats agree 
on the importance of equality and inte-
grated schools. I am going to repeat 
that again. Republicans and Democrats 
agree on the importance of equality 
and integrated schools. Unfortunately, 
instead of working toward a bipartisan 
solution, H.R. 2574 is the result of 
Democrats choosing a partisan path. 
The creation of a private right of ac-
tion could lead to additional burdens 
on school systems who would have to 
defend themselves against tenuous al-
legations advanced by activist lawyers 
and does nothing to eliminate the 
State’s ability to track students in 
low-performing schools. 
This bill is designed to score political 
points rather than build on a history of 
bipartisan and bicameral solutions to 
racial inequality and discrimination. 
For these reasons, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on H.R. 2574, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
TORRES of California). The gentleman 
from Virginia has 161⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say a few 
words about what the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights found, since the rank-
ing member mentioned the Secretary 
of Education, Betsy DeVos, by name. 
It found that the Secretary of Edu-
cation, Betsy DeVos, has rescinded 
critical guidance to protect students’ 
civil rights, narrow the scope, and re-
duced the number of investigations 
conducted, and decreased the budget 
and staffing capacity of the Office of 
Civil Rights at the department. 
The Commission’s report indicated 
that OCR issued 38 guidance documents 
to improve program understanding of 
and compliance with civil rights stat-
utes under the Obama administration. 
By comparison, the OCR under the 
Trump administration has issued few 
guidance documents and has instead 
rescinded critical guidance documents. 
Specifically, in 2018 Secretary DeVos 
rescinded guidance documents in sup-
port of the constitutionally protected 
use of race in admission or assignments 
to improve diversity and higher edu-
cation and K–12. 
Also, in 2018, Secretary DeVos re-
scinded 2014 school discipline guidance 
packages, which provided local edu-
cational agencies with technical assist-
ance through reform, discipline poli-
cies, and practices that, although ra-
cially neutral, disproportionately im-
pacted students of color in violation of 
title IV. And it goes on and on to talk 
about what has been going on in this 
administration. 
Madam Speaker, the ranking mem-
ber talked about school segregation 
yesterday. We had the opportunity to 
do something to help those localities 
that wanted to voluntarily desegregate 
their schools. And it was a bipartisan 
result—21 Republicans joined Demo-
crats in providing resources to local-
ities that wanted technical assistance 
in how to voluntarily desegregate their 
schools. 
That can be complicated, because in 
the Supreme Court case involving two 
localities, Louisville, Kentucky, and 
Seattle, Washington, voluntary school 
desegregation initiatives were found 
unconstitutional. The Court said you 
can do it, but in this case, you didn’t 
do it right. So technical assistance, 
legal advice, is necessary to make sure 
that you can have an effective policy 
that can withstand constitutional chal-
lenge. 
Regrettably, 160 Republicans voted 
‘‘no’’ to give those resources to those 
localities that want to voluntarily de-
segregate their schools. 
I mentioned the research on school 
choice. This is a very simple bill. It 
just gives the right of those who can 
prove discriminatory impact on their 
school systems—they can prove it, it 
just gives them the right to come to 
court to prove that they have been dis-
criminated against to vindicate their 
rights. 
It is a very simple bill, and I hope 
that the House will pass it so their 
civil rights will be protected. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in support of H.R. 2574, the Equity 
and Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2019. This 
bill will take a meaningful step forward to en-
sure that programs receiving federal funding 
are upholding a high standard of equality and 
inclusion—similar to that which our country 
strives for. 
In 2001, the Supreme Court, in its ruling in 
Alexander v. Sandoval, stated that only the 
Department 
of 
Education 
can 
challenge 
schools and other programs over discrimina-
tory practices. In the majority opinion written 
by Justice Antonin Scalia, supported by the 
court’s conservative bloc, he claimed that stu-
dents and parents did not own the right to 
challenge schools and other programs on their 
practices and policies. Let me repeat that—the 
Supreme Court ruled that instead of allowing 
those directly and adversely affected by dis-
criminatory practices and policies to initiate 
legal proceedings, the responsibility would be

September 16, 2020 
placed on government bureaucrats. Now, at a 
time when the Department of Education lacks 
competent leadership, it is more important 
than ever before to reverse the Supreme 
Court’s decision. 
H.R. 2574 rectifies the Court’s ruling and 
would allow students and parents to hold fed-
erally funded programs, like schools, account-
able for any discriminatory practices and poli-
cies that impact people of color through a pri-
vate right to action within the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964. It also creates an Assistant for Equity 
and Inclusion position in the Department of 
Education, tasked with guiding and advising 
the agency as to the best practices and poli-
cies for students in every classroom across 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation and ask for 
its immediate in consideration in the Senate. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary and Homeland 
Committees, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
2574, the ‘‘Equity and Inclusion Enforcement 
Act of 2019,’’ which restores the power of stu-
dents and parents to challenge discriminatory 
policies and practices in schools and other 
federally funded programs. 
In 2001, the Supreme Court decided in 
Alexander v. Sandoval to overturn four dec-
ades of statutory protections against discrimi-
nation by stripping victims of discrimination of 
the right to bring disparate impact claims 
under Title VI. 
However, this bill ensures that victims of 
discrimination no longer have to rely on the 
Department of Education to take legal action 
in order to challenge discriminatory practices 
in their schools. 
Instead, individuals will once again have the 
ability to address instances of racial inequities 
themselves. 
The Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act 
further protects students by making positive 
and substantive changes to Title VI, which 
prohibits discrimination based on race, color, 
or national origin in programs or activities that 
receive federal financial assistance. 
For example, the bill creates Title VI mon-
itors to ensure that every school district and 
institution of higher education has at least one 
employee who is specifically responsible for 
investigating any complaints of discrimination 
based on race, color, or national origin. 
It also establishes an Assistant Secretary in 
the Department of Education to coordinate 
and promote Title VI enforcement in edu-
cation. 
In 1954, the Supreme Court’s landmark de-
cision in Brown v. Board of Education struck 
down the ‘‘separate but equal’’ premise that 
had allowed segregation in our public-school 
system. 
It has been 66 years since that monumental 
ruling, yet we still have not been able to fulfill 
the promise of equity in education for our chil-
dren. 
Over the past few months, the United States 
has experienced seismic shifts in social con-
sciousness regarding racial inequities that 
have permeated every aspect of American so-
ciety. 
As the names of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile, and so 
many others, become synonymous with to-
day’s civil rights movement, I believe this bill 
marks a step forward in the fight for equal 
rights. 
We cannot achieve true racial equality with-
out addressing the systematic discrimination in 
our education system. 
For example, in December of 2018, Andrew 
Johnson, a Black high school wrestler, in New 
Jersey was forced to make an impossible 
choice when a referee told him to either cut 
his dreadlocks or forfeit the wrestling match. 
Although Johnson wore a hair covering for 
the match, as dictated by wrestling guidelines, 
the referee rejected the covering and gave the 
student 90 seconds to cut off his dreadlocks. 
In 2016, a Black teenager was escorted out 
of his high school graduation ceremony in 
Sacramento, California by three deputies after 
refusing to remove his kente cloth, a tradi-
tional Ghanaian silk and cotton fabric that 
symbolizes national cultural identity. 
Earlier this year, the Barbers Hill Inde-
pendent School District in Texas refused to 
change its grooming policy that led to the sus-
pension of two Black students. 
Despite public backlash against the policy, 
which forbids male students from keeping their 
hair at ‘‘a length below the top of a t-shirt col-
lar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear 
lobes’’, the school board voted unanimously to 
keep the policy in place. 
These instances of continued discrimination 
against minority students in our public-school 
system create a learning environment that is 
far from equal. 
It is imperative to recognize that the exist-
ence of these Eurocentric policies in our edu-
cational system have a disparate effect on 
Black students, who are either forced to sup-
press their cultural heritage and Black identity 
or forfeit their right to equal educational and 
extracurricular opportunities. 
While on the surface, such policies do not 
seem directed at specific races or ethnicities, 
in practice, they often discriminate against a 
Black person or person of color based on 
characteristics associated with them. 
It is also well known that Black students are 
more often over-disciplined at school than 
their white counterparts. 
Between 2015 and 2016, Black children ac-
counted for 15 percent of all students, yet they 
made up 31 percent of referrals to law en-
forcement and school-based arrests, perpet-
uating the school-to-prison pipeline. 
In Texas, black students in the Houston 
Independent School District (HISD) were four 
times more likely to receive a law enforcement 
referral, which includes citations, tickets, court 
referrals, and school-related arrests, than their 
white peers. 
According to the Texas Education Agency, 
HISD is also known for its stark disparities be-
tween black and white students in school dis-
cipline, with black students being seven times 
more likely to get an out-of-school suspension. 
These instances create a culture of inequal-
ity and reinforce barriers to education for stu-
dents of color. 
Without a private right of action to challenge 
these patterns and policies, students of color 
face countless forms of irreparable harm, in-
cluding missing countless hours of instruction, 
educational opportunities, and relationship de-
velopment that promotes pro-social growth 
and positive life outcomes. 
Madam Speaker, by creating measures that 
give agency to individuals to identify, chal-
lenge, and change discriminatory practices in 
their own communities, we are creating an en-
vironment where all kids, regardless of race, 
color, or national origin, are given an equal 
chance to learn and excel. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to recognize the opportunity we have 
here today to rectify some of the inequities in 
our schools and, more importantly, positively 
change the educational experience for stu-
dents of color across the country.

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina (during

unanimous consent to dispense with

There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of her motion. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as you have heard throughout 
this debate, Republicans agree that dis-
crimination and segregation are repug-
nant and immoral. 
Unfortunately, this bill does nothing 
to address these problems. Instead, 
Democrats are trying to sneak in a 
radical partisan rewrite of civil rights 
law under the guise of an education 
bill. However, before the House takes 
action on this legislation, we have one 
final opportunity to address one par-
ticular flaw in this bill. 
On September 11, 2019, President 
Trump issued an executive order estab-
lishing the policy of the executive 
branch 
to 
consider 
discrimination 
against Jews to be illegal discrimina-
tion under title VI when such discrimi-
nation is based on an individual’s race, 
color, or national origin.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4444 
September 16, 2020 
If this House is going to radically re-
write title VI, as this bill does, we 
should use this opportunity to show 
commitment to combating anti-Semi-
tism. 
With 
anti-Semitism 
on 
the 
rise 
around the world, the need for this 
amendment is clear. In fact, here in the 
United States, we have seen horrific 
acts of violence against our Jewish 
friends over the last few years. 
In October 2018, 11 congregants lost 
their lives at a synagogue in Pitts-
burgh, the worst killing of Jews in 
American history. In December of last 
year, a gunman targeted a Jewish ko-
sher deli, leaving six dead. 
This motion does one simple thing. 
The underlying bill requires recipients 
of funding from the Department of 
Education to designate title VI compli-
ance coordinators. My motion inserts 
language into this provision directing 
such compliance coordinators to con-
sider anti-Semitism to be illegal dis-
crimination on the basis of race, color, 
or national origin under title VI. 
Madam Speaker, we have an oppor-
tunity with this amendment to achieve 
an important goal. We can ensure that 
recipients of Federal education funding 
are doing all they can to protect mem-
bers of our communities from horrific 
anti-Semitism. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, anti-Semitism is religious 
discrimination. As the motion reflects, 
religion is not covered by title VI. It 
covers discrimination based on race, 
color, or national origin. It doesn’t 
cover religion. 
While we are picking just one reli-
gious kind of discrimination, anti-Sem-
itism, what about the other religions? 
Wouldn’t they deserve attention, too? 
This is just a political attempt to in-
sert religion into title VI. That is con-
troversial. Might get support for that, 
but that is not part of this bill. 
This motion just diverts attention 
from the core provision of the bill, and 
that is to open the courts so that those 
who can prove discrimination can have 
their day in court if their proof is 
based on disparate impact. 
Now, let’s not divert attention away 
from that core idea that people who 
have been discriminated against ought 
to be able to get into court. Let’s let 
them have their day in court. Defeat 
this motion and pass the bill. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and the nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

ENSURING CHILDREN AND CHILD 
CARE WORKERS ARE SAFE ACT 
OF 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7909) to facilitate access to 
child care services safely and securely 
during the COVID–19 pandemic, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7909 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring 
Children and Child Care Workers Are Safe 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Child care is an essential service that 
supports children’s early development and 
allows parents to work. 
(2) At least 1 out of 2 child care providers 
closed at some point during the COVID-19 
pandemic, and 2 out of 5 face the possibility 
of permanent closure. 
(3) The lack of access to child care services 
can prevent parents from returning to work 
and can prevent children from accessing crit-
ical services, including meals. 
(4) Ensuring the safe re-opening and oper-
ation of child care service settings during pe-
riods of community transmission of COVID- 
19 will require child care providers to adopt 
new measures and practices in order to re-
duce the likelihood of COVID-19 trans-
mission. 
(5) Such measures and practices must en-
sure the safety of children as well as child 
care workers, who may be at high risk of in-
fection. 
(6) Ensuring that working families have ac-
cess to safe child care service options is crit-
ical to supporting young children’s develop-
ment and to returning the economy back to 
its pre-pandemic levels. 
SEC. 3. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE SAFE 
PROVISION OF CHILD CARE SERV-
ICES. 
(a) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STATES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Health

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7909, the Ensuring Children 
and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act. 
Access to high-quality, affordable 
childcare has always been fundamental 
to the well-being of families and chil-
dren, so it is not surprising that 
childcare has emerged as one of the 
most urgent issues facing families and 
communities during this pandemic. 
I have spoken with parents who are 
struggling with how you balance kids 
at home with work at home. I have 
heard from business owners, economic 
development leaders, and local elected 
officials who are worried about the 
workforce 
and 
the 
economy, 
and 
childcare has always been an impor-
tant part of all of these conversations 
because it is a key factor in reopening 
our communities safely. 
Many, and in some places most, 
childcare providers across the country 
were closed during the early months of 
the pandemic. But now, they are re-
opening and working hard to restore 
confidence and provide a safe place for 
the children in their care. 
Unfortunately, providers have told us 
that they have received little direct 
guidance about how to modify their 
practices for COVID–19 to keep chil-
dren, families, and workers safe and 
that the guidance they have received 
keeps changing and is oftentimes unre-
alistic. This makes it difficult for pro-
viders to rebuild and to serve the num-
ber 
of 
children 
they 
need 
to 
sustainably run their business and sur-
vive the pandemic. 
It is worth noting that even before 
the pandemic, this industry operated 
on razor-thin margins and faced major 
difficulties. 
According to a recent report from the 
American Institutes for Research and 
Early Edge California, of the 278 Cali-
fornia childcare providers surveyed, 52 
percent reported that it was too dif-
ficult to understand or follow new re-
quirements during COVID–19, and 79 
percent reported a significant need for 
guidance on how to implement new 
COVID–19 health and safety protocols. 
This important bipartisan bill before 
us today, introduced by my colleagues 
Representative FINKENAUER and Rep-
resentative GUTHRIE, will help meet 
this need by requiring the Department 
of Health and Human Services, in con-
sultation with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, to issue edu-
cational materials and guidance on 
how to provide childcare services safe-
ly during the pandemic. 
Critically, this bill authorizes fund-
ing that will enable States to provide 
direct outreach, technical assistance, 
and support to childcare providers. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, before I begin, I was 
talking to my friend from Oregon ear-
lier—and also, I know, your home 
State—and our thoughts and prayers 
are with everybody on the West Coast. 
I know some of us have friends on the 
Gulf Coast. We have citizens of our 
country, Madam Speaker, that are 
going through some tough times, and 
our thoughts and prayers are with 
them. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7909, the Ensuring Children and 
Child Care Workers Are Safe Act. It is 
a bipartisan piece of legislation that I 
introduced with my colleague, Rep-
resentative FINKENAUER
from Iowa, 
which will provide childcare providers 
resources and information on how to 
safely operate during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Without childcare options, parents 
can’t return to work, which is a key 
component to our Nation’s economic 
recovery. Additionally, childcare bene-
fits and a child’s health and develop-
ment are critical to building a strong 
foundation for future success. 
Childcare providers, however, are 
currently grappling with safely reopen-
ing and staying open. A recent article 
in U.S. News and World Report noted 
tens of thousands of childcare pro-
viders shuttered across the U.S., 4,500 
in the Washington, D.C., area alone. 
In my home State of Kentucky, 
thanks to the CARES Act, many of our 
childcare centers have been fortunate 
to reopen. However, one-third of the 
State’s 
2,200 
licensed 
or 
certified 
childcare 
centers 
still 
haven’t 
re-
opened. 
In order to reopen for families, 
childcare providers must follow certain 
guidelines and modify their normal 
routines in order to create a safe envi-
ronment for children. Now more than 
ever, childcare providers need assist-
ance interpreting and implementing 
CDC and State guidelines designed to 
keep children safe. 
My bill, along with Representative 
FINKENAUER, H.R. 7909, requires the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices to work with States to provide 
technical assistance for childcare pro-
viders as they reopen across the coun-
try. 
In a recent study on technical assist-
ance, the Government Accountability 
Office found that the current COVID–19 
pandemic underscores the importance 
of Federal agencies providing technical 
assistance to grantees to ensure the 
continuity of operations of grant pro-
grams and the effective use of funding. 
b 1115 
While it is common for Congress to 
require technical assistance, it is crit-
ical that we tailor these directives 
carefully to ensure grantees are receiv-
ing necessary and timely support. We 
in Congress hear the concerns of 
childcare providers and are sending the 
assistance they desperately need. 
Additionally, this bill authorizes $5 
million for 1 year for HHS to issue 
grants to States so they can provide 
guidance and technical support to 
childcare providers, and it requires 
HHS to provide recommendations to 
Congress on how to ensure there is an 
adequate supply of safe childcare dur-
ing COVID–19. It is critical, and not 
only to children and childcare pro-
viders, but also to families who need 
access to childcare while they return 
to work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on H.R. 7909 so that we can help put 
our country on the path forward. I ap-
preciate working with my colleague 
from Iowa, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague, Mr. 
GUTHRIE, for his kind remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield as much 
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Ms. FINKENAUER), 
the author of this important bipartisan 
legislation. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of my legisla-
tion, aptly called the Ensuring Chil-
dren and Child Care Workers Are Safe 
Act. I introduced this commonsense bi-
partisan 
bill 
to 
help 
ensure 
our 
childcare providers have the informa-
tion and resources they need to provide 
a safe environment both for the kids 
they serve and also their caregivers 
they employ amid the ongoing COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
You see, parent and childcare pro-
viders were having a tough time even

September 16, 2020 
before this pandemic hit our country. 
In my district, for example, parents 
can’t find enough people to provide 
quality and affordable childcare, and 
there is an overwhelming demand and 
just not enough care available. This is 
an industry struggling with a shrink-
ing workforce, low wages, and razor- 
thin margins. 
And for myself personally, growing 
up in Iowa, I went to college in Iowa; 
and I saw, after college and even after 
high school, a lot of my friends move 
away and go to States where they 
could make more money and pay off 
their student loan debt. 
Right now they are in their thirties, 
around my age, getting married, want-
ing to have kids, wanting to move back 
home, and one of the barriers to doing 
it is access to childcare. 
So, again, this has been an issue that 
we have dealt with for a long time, be-
fore this pandemic even hit. But now, 
on top of everything, we are asking our 
childcare providers to keep our kids 
safe during this pandemic. In my State, 
cases continue to rise, but many folks 
have no choice but to return to work. 
Right now, I am worried that we are 
headed in the wrong direction. Roughly 
60 percent of childcare providers have 
actually closed their doors because of 
the pandemic, and there is a chance 
that up to half of those closures will 
actually be permanent. 
Earlier this year, we passed legisla-
tion to create a $50 billion childcare 
stabilization fund, which passed with 
bipartisan support. This will help ad-
dress some of the intense financial 
pressure facing our providers right 
now, but the problem is still more com-
plicated. We must give the providers 
the guidance and also the support that 
they need to protect the health and 
safety of our children, families, and 
frontline workers. 
That is where the Ensuring Children 
and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act 
comes in. We want to make sure 
childcare providers are equipped to 
keep kids safe and prevent the spread 
of COVID–19. We are going to do that 
by ensuring there is practical safety 
guidance and technical assistance from 
the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
We also want to make sure that this 
guidance actually reaches childcare 
providers and that providers get the 
help they need in implementing best 
practices. That is why our bill would 
also create grants so States can reach 
out to providers and provide the tech-
nical support they need to succeed. 
This bill recognizes the unprece-
dented demands being put on our 
childcare providers. We simply cannot 
expect them to do this alone when they 
are already up against so much. 
When it comes to addressing the 
childcare crisis which existed, again, 
well before COVID–19 hit our country, I 
am happy to say that I have found 
many partners on both sides of the 
aisle who are willing to tackle this 
issue for hardworking families. 
Thank you to the great group of bi-
partisan colleagues who are joining me 
in tackling this problem and who 
worked with me to craft this bill. This 
includes 
my 
colead, 
Congressman 
BRETT GUTHRIE of Kentucky. 
There is an understanding here that 
if parents don’t have access to quality 
and affordable childcare, then they will 
start passing up economic opportuni-
ties. Sometimes it is turning down a 
promotion or, in other cases, that 
means leaving the workforce alto-
gether. We see this far too often, espe-
cially in rural districts like mine. 
It is clear that the childcare industry 
is critical to recovering from this pan-
demic and the economic situation it 
created. Providing help and technical 
assistance now will take a burden off 
our providers amid the many chal-
lenges, again, that they face during the 
pandemic. 
This bipartisan bill before you today 
is common sense, and it is something 
that folks across the country are ask-
ing for. So I urge you to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the Ensuring Children and Child Care 
Workers Are Safe Act. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), a member 
of the committee and a good friend. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
America’s childcare providers and the 
essential services they provide to our 
Nation’s families. 
As millions of families have learned 
during 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
childcare is a critical component of our 
national economy. In addition to the 
significant benefits that childcare pro-
vides for children’s social and emo-
tional development, access to reliable 
childcare continues to play a vital role 
in America’s economic recovery. 
As parents return to work, they need 
to be sure that their children will be 
looked after and kept safe. The Ensur-
ing Children and Child Care Workers 
Are Safe Act of 2020, H.R. 7909, would 
make these assurances to families by 
equipping childcare providers with the 
resources they need to perform their 
jobs safely and effectively. 
This legislation would provide fund-
ing for States to implement technical 
support and training programs to as-
sist childcare providers in meeting 
safety guidelines and acquiring per-
sonal protective equipment. 
Childcare providers have supported 
millions of American families, pro-
viding an essential service during good 
times and bad. I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 7909. 
Ms. 
BONAMICI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
may I please inquire how much time 
remains on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Oregon has 13 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I really thank the gentlewoman for her 
leadership on these issues. Thank you 
so very much for allowing me this 
time. As well, to the chairman of the 
committee, ranking member, and to 
Ms. FINKENAUER
and the gentleman 
from Kentucky, let me thank them for 
their leadership, and I thank the gen-
tlewoman for the time. 
Madam Speaker, let me indicate how 
important this legislation is. Twelve 
Utah childcare students were infected 
with COVID–19. They infected another 
12; one of them was a parent who had 
to go to a hospital. 
The Ensuring Children and Child 
Care Workers Are Safe Act of 2020 is 
vital and long overdue. This bill re-
quires the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services to provide edu-
cational materials and technical as-
sistance to States related to the safe 
provision of childcare services during 
COVID–19. 
With this bill, childcare facilities not 
only receive information on COVID–19 
prevention, but also professional devel-
opment for providers on health and 
safety, as well as guidance on the ac-
quisition and use of personal protective 
equipment. 
We heard this a lot in my district: No 
PPE. 
It also instructs HHS to recommend 
additional steps to Congress about en-
suring the safe provision and adequate 
supply of childcare during COVID–19, 
including whether and how to expand 
the supply of childcare to meet de-
mand. There is a demand. It is crucial. 
In addition, according to The Wash-
ington Post, before the coronavirus 
pandemic, approximately one-third of 
all children under age 5 attended a paid 
care 
facility, 
daycare 
center, 
pre-
school, or prekindergarten. In 2019, 
there were 15 million-plus children liv-
ing with a single mother and approxi-
mately 3 million children living with a 
single father. 
This is crucial because, as things 
open up, children and schools are all 
going to be intermingling, and these 
childcare workers are vital to what we 
do and how we provide for these hard-
working parents and to protect these 
children. 
And now we know. It has been dis-
abused that at any point children are 
not infectious. That is no longer a fact. 
It is not a fact. It is not true. They are 
infectious 
and 
they 
can 
transmit 
COVID–19. 
Let me take a moment to speak 
quickly to H.R. 2574, the Equity and In-
clusion Enforcement Act of 2019. 
That bill passed, but it restores the 
power of students and parents to chal-
lenge discriminatory policies and prac-
tices in schools and other federally 
funded programs. We know what hap-
pened to this young man who wanted 
to wrestle. What a humiliating situa-
tion when, on the wrestling floor, in 
the competition, a coach had to cut his 
hair off. 
I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 
7909. 
I also rise to support H.R. 3659,

Coronavirus Relief Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues and ask my colleagues to sup-
port the legislation. 
Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor and 
Founding Chair of the Congressional Chil-
dren’s Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
7909, the ‘‘Ensuring Child and Child Care 
Workers Are Safe Act of 2020,’’ which re-
quires the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) to provide educational 
materials and technical assistance to states 
related to the safe provision of child care serv-
ices during COVID–19. Despite their vital role 
during the pandemic, child care providers 
have received insufficient actionable guidance 
on how to prevent the spread of COVID–19 
while providing high-quality care. 
With this bill, child care facilities not only re-
ceive information on COVID–19 prevention but 
also professional development for providers on 
health and safety as well as guidance on the 
acquisition and use of personal protective 
equipment. It also instructs HHS to rec-
ommend additional steps to Congress about 
ensuring the safe provision and adequate sup-
ply of childcare during COVID–19, including 
whether and how to expand the supply of child 
care to meet demand. 
As an increasing number of states open up 
and more individuals return to work, parents 
are relying on child care facilities once again, 
making the need for proper guidance to pre-
vent the spread of COVID–19 at child care 
services more essential than ever. As of this 
morning, the United States has over 6,606,859 
cases of coronavirus and over 195,961 related 
deaths. Adequate and updated information is 
key to getting control over this disease, and 
we must ensure that this guidance is easily 
and readily accessible to all. 
It is no secret that the child care sector pro-
vides an immense public value to our society 
and our economy. According to the Wash-
ington Post, before the coronavirus pandemic, 
approximately one-third of all children under 
age 5 attended a paid care facility, day-care 
center, preschool or prekindergarten. 
Child care plays a crucial role in the lives of 
working parents, especially in single parent 
households. In 2019, there were about 15.76 
million children living with a single mother and 
approximately 3.23 million children living with 
a single father in the United States. We must 
never forget that child care is often a lifeline 
to single, working parents that allows them to 
balance both their parenting and professional 
responsibilities. 
I am proud to be a leader on this critical 
piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues 
from both parties to join me in voting to pass 
H.R. 7909. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, in these challenging 
times, childcare providers, especially 
those who run small operations, are at 
risk of shutting their doors. The call 
for Congress to act is loud and clear. 
With the additional health and safety 
requirements providers are expected to 
navigate, it is important to help them 
implement these requirements so the 
children in their care remain safe and 
free from harm. H.R. 7909 will ensure 
that childcare providers receive guid-
ance and assistance to safely operate 
so that parents can return to work and 
our economy can continue to recover. I 
think most of the people, when I am 
back home, are just looking to return 
to normal, and this moves that for-
ward. 
For these reasons, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7909, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I wish to once again 
thank Representatives FINKENAUER and 
GUTHRIE for their leadership in crafting 
this urgently needed bipartisan bill and 
all of my colleagues who have spoken 
in support of the Ensuring Children 
and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act. 
This is such an important issue. 
Today’s 
children 
are 
tomorrow’s 
leaders. This bill will help make sure 
that childcare providers who are en-
trusted with the health, safety, and de-
velopment of our Nation’s very future 
have the support they need to succeed. 
I also want to note, as my colleague 
from Iowa noted, that the consider-
ation of this bill comes after the House 
passage of the Child Care is Essential 
Act, which will provide $50 billion in 
direct grant funding to help childcare 
providers cover operating expenses, 
purchase PPE and cleaning supplies, 
pay providers through the pandemic 
and beyond, and, importantly, give 
struggling parents relief from high-cost 
copayments and tuition. 
This is a good investment in our chil-
dren, our families, our economy, and 
our future. I continue to urge Senator 
MCCONNELL and the full Senate to take 
up the Child Care is Essential Act, as 
well as this excellent bipartisan bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the legislation be-
fore us today, H.R. 7909, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7909, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution

ther proceedings on this motion are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Over 75 percent of preschool-age chil-
dren attend some form of early care 
and education before reaching kinder-
garten. For this reason, it is impera-
tive that we ensure we are providing 
our children with the best educators 
that will give them the best education 
possible. 
The 2014 reauthorization of the Child 
Care and Development Block Grant—or 
as we will say today, the CCDBG Act— 
made changes to the original 1990 bill, 
including adding background checks to 
ensure that childcare centers receiving 
funds through the CCDBG are employ-
ing quality professionals. 
However, in the 6 years since the re-
authorization, barriers to background 
check information have hindered the 
hiring process for quality childcare 
providers. 
So as of right now, there is no uni-
form process to share this information 
across States. Each State has its own 
set of laws and policies, making it 
harder for childcare providers to gather 
the necessary information for the em-
ployees that they are hiring. 
S. 2683, the Child Care Protection Im-
provement Act of 2020, would create an 
interagency task force that will iden-
tify the obstacles in the background 
check process and recommend best 
practices to overcoming them. 
When children attend safe, high-qual-
ity, early care and education programs, 
they develop the skills that help them 
succeed in school and in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of S. 2683, the Child 
Care Protection Improvement Act of 
2020, the same bill offered by my col-
leagues Representatives MCBATH, KEL-
LER, TAYLOR, FINKENAUER, and AXNE. 
In 2014, Congress passed the Child 
Care Development and Block Grant Re-
authorization Act with broad bipar-
tisan support and it required that 
States conduct specified comprehen-
sive criminal background checks for all 
childcare staff members. 
As part of this crucial requirement, 
interstate checks must be completed in 
any State where the prospective em-
ployee lived over the last 5 years. How-
ever, given the variation of individual 
State laws and practices, interstate 
background checks have proven dif-
ficult for many States to complete. 
With only three States able to fully 
implement the Child Care and Develop-
ment Block Grant background checks 
as of March 1st, 2020, it is time for Con-
gress to determine the root causes of 
the roadblocks to interstate back-
ground checks. 
The Child Care Protection Improve-
ment Act does just that by establishing 
a task force at HHS. The task force in-
cludes the FBI and respective CCDBG 
Federal agencies, as well as those who 
are operating State background check 
systems in order to determine the 
issues with the current systems. 
By establishing a task force, Con-
gress can take action to improve the 
operability and preserve the resources 
of the grantees who are already bur-
dened by the red tape in the interstate 
background check system. 
Approximately 1.3 million children 
receive a childcare subsidy from the 
Child Care and Development Fund 
every month. Their parents deserve the 
peace of mind that their children’s 
caretakers have gone through com-
prehensive background checks. 
While good-faith efforts toward com-
pliance have been shown and incre-
mental improvement has been dem-
onstrated, more can be done to expedi-
ently implement these crucial safety 
measures for our children. The task 
force established in this bill is a prom-
ising step to achieving criminal back-
ground check implementation in every 
State. 
I thank my colleagues for working 
across the aisle in crafting this legisla-
tion. I thank Chairman SCOTT of the 
Education and Labor Committee and 
Republican leader FOXX
for helping 
bring this bill to the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. MURPHY), my friend and an impor-
tant member of our committee. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2683, the Child Care Protection 
Improvement Act. 
As a father of three and a member of 
the Education and Labor Committee, 
the issue this legislation seeks to im-
prove is near and dear to me. 
After reauthorizing the Child Care 
and Development Block Grant in 2014, 
which passed with broad bipartisan 
support, Congress added a requirement 
for States to implement background 
checks for any childcare employee put 
in charge of supervising children. 
Childcare is an essential service as 
well as a source of employment for 
many Americans, so safety and care 
are of the utmost concern. Parents 
want to know that their children are in 
a good, honest, and safe environment. 
However, since this reauthorization, 
implementation has been very prob-
lematic. Many States have experienced 
a great amount of difficulties actually 
performing robust background checks. 
In fact, as of March 1, 2020, only three 
States have been able to fully imple-
ment the required background checks. 
If passed, this bill will establish a 
task force at the Department of Health 
and Human Services to monitor back-
ground 
checks 
and 
to 
make 
rec-
ommendations for improving imple-
mentation at childcare businesses. 
Keeping children safe from harm is a 
parent’s number one concern when 
they leave them in someone else’s care. 
Parents will be more assured when 
they know their caretaker and all of

its employees have histories absent of 
criminal activity, sexual abuse, or any 
other forms of neglect. 
We are facing so many challenges in 
this Nation at this time, but regard-
less, we can never stop working to 
make our children safe. 
I thank my colleague, Senator BURR 
from North Carolina, for leading this 
initiative in the upper Chamber. I 
thank my colleagues in the House for 
doing the same. I look forward to its 
passage here in the House. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), who has 
been an architect of this piece of legis-
lation. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of S. 2683, the Child 
Care Protection Improvement Act, leg-
islation that is essential to the safety 
of millions of American children. 
I am a proud original cosponsor of 
H.R. 3986, which is almost an identical 
companion bill in the House. 
Childcare services play an integral 
role in our society. Families across the 
Nation 
entrust 
childcare 
providers 
with the well-being of their children on 
a daily basis. Every parent deserves the 
peace of mind of knowing that their 
childcare providers are passionate, car-
ing, and above all, qualified. 
While this is the case with a great 
many providers, it is imperative for 
States to be able to effectively conduct 
background checks, especially across 
State lines. 
Faults in our criminal background 
check system can leave our children 
vulnerable to bad actors. No child 
should ever be placed in the care of an 
unqualified or dangerous person. 
S. 2683 will help States address chal-
lenges in implementing background 
checks required under current law, en-
suring our children receive the safest 
and highest quality of care possible. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the childcare indus-
try is critical to the well-being of 
American families, and each family 
across our Nation deserves to know 
that those who are caring for their 
children have gone through thorough 
and necessary criminal background 
checks. 
The Child Care Protection Improve-
ment Act helps protect children and 
gives parents peace of mind when it 
comes to sending their children to a 
childcare facility. 
This legislation is a perfect example 
of what Congress can accomplish when 
bipartisanship and meaningful collabo-
ration take priority over politics. 
I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote on S. 2683. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 
2683. We must do everything that we 
can to ensure the safety of our chil-
dren. Families deserve to know that 
their kids are being cared for by quali-
fied providers. 
Before we close out, I thank my col-
leagues, Representatives VAN TAYLOR, 
CINDY AXNE, FRED KELLER, and ABBY 
FINKENAUER for working with me to in-
troduce the House companion for this 
bipartisan legislation. 
It is so great that we were able to 
work together to keep our children 
safe, set them up for educational suc-
cess, and ensure our qualified childcare 
providers have access to the opportuni-
ties they have worked so hard for. 
I also thank the Education and Labor 
Committee staff for their hard work of 
helping us advance this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
MCBATH) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2683, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3659) to establish an Anti- 
Bullying Roundtable to study bullying 
in elementary and secondary schools in 
the United States, and for other pur-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I

bers may have 5 legislative days within

on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
b 1145 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
I was proud to co-introduce this im-
portant legislation with my colleague, 
Congressman MAX ROSE, and I would 
like to start by thanking him for his 
work and leadership on this bill and on 
behalf of Danny and his family. 
In 
2016, 
13-year-old 
Daniel 
Fitzpatrick took his life as a direct re-
sult of bullying at school. 
To honor Danny and to help save 
countless other young lives, his family 
committed to advocacy and established 
the Danny’s Angel Network Nurturing 
Youth, DANNY, foundation to raise 
awareness and end bullying in schools. 
One out of every five kids in this 
country 
experiences 
bullying. 
The 
problem has grown and moved from be-
yond the playground to the internet as 
students spend more and more time on-
line. 
Bullying contributes to emotional 
and mental health problems for chil-
dren across this country and, in far too 
many cases, has driven kids to suicide. 
In fact, a recently released CDC report 
stated that suicide of youth ages 10 to 
24 has increased by nearly 60 percent in 
the last 10 years. 
This is an issue that deserves our 
consideration, deserves research, and 
deserves action. We simply must do 
more to prevent bullying and its dev-
astating consequences. 
Danny’s Law would establish an 
antibullying roundtable, a commission 
tasked with studying bullying in ele-
mentary and secondary schools and 
producing a report with best practices 
to address it. 
While we cannot bring back those we 
have lost to bullying and suicide, this 
commission will give schools and edu-
cators the tools to end bullying—some-
thing I hear from my constituents far 
too often, from my schools, from my 
educators—and it will ensure that 
every student can grow and learn in a 
safe and welcoming environment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3659, 
Danny’s Law, bipartisan legislation 
that would establish an antibullying 
roundtable to examine bullying in ele-
mentary and secondary schools in the 
United States. 
One-third of the world’s youth are 
bullied. This is a saddening statistic. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, students who 
are bullied are more likely to experi-
ence low self-esteem and isolation, per-
form poorly in school, have fewer 
friends, have a negative view of aca-
demics, and experience physical symp-
toms and mental health issues. 
We all agree that no child should be 
bullied in any school, and as elected 
representatives, we are in a position to 
coordinate on our efforts to support 
our schools in preventing such mis-
treatments. 
The legislation before us today is 
named in honor of Daniel Fitzpatrick, 
a 13-year-old boy who tragically died 
by suicide in August 2016 after being 
bullied by his peers. 
Before taking his own life, Daniel 
wrote a note to his family detailing the 
struggles he faced with bullying and 
the lack of response by his teachers. 
This is heartbreaking, and it is unac-
ceptable. 
Unfortunately, 
devastating 
stories 
like Daniel’s are becoming far too com-
mon throughout our country and have 
lasting impacts on American families 
and our communities. 
Today, we are here to act. 
Under Danny’s Law, Members of Con-
gress and the Secretary of Education 
will appoint 15 individuals representing 
a variety of community members with 
insight into bullying and its effects on 
children. These parents, school leaders, 
teachers, school security, and psy-
chologists will serve on an antibullying 
roundtable to consult with State and 
local educational agencies regarding 
the growing issue of bullying and to 
discuss prevention measures to reduce 
its increasing toll on our Nation’s 
youth. 
By addressing the mistreatment and 
harassment of school-age children, we 
can help create a safe learning environ-
ment for students. They are our future. 
We have a vested interest in giving 
families, schools, and communities the 
tools they need to shape young Ameri-
cans to be successful leaders. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
taking action to combat bullying in 
our Nation’s elementary and secondary 
schools, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
H.R. 3659 for children like Danny and 
millions of others who face bullying 
every single day. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ROSE), the author of 
this bill. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank, of course, the chair-
man of this committee and my wonder-
ful colleague from Michigan for her 
friendship and her extraordinary lead-
ership. 
I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of H.R. 3659, otherwise 
known as Danny’s Law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4451 
September 16, 2020 
This bill will establish a roundtable 
of experts and stakeholders to study 
and report on the problem of bullying 
in our schools. 
This isn’t a new problem, but it is 
one that is increasingly more prevalent 
and increasingly more complex. Kids 
today don’t just face bullying at 
school. They bring it home with them 
as well, home on their phones, home on 
their computers. It is all over social 
media. 
Addressing this problem will require 
a head-on commitment nationwide to 
end bullying, one that involves not just 
lawmakers as ourselves, but every sin-
gle person in this Nation, private sec-
tor, public sector, everyone. 
I hope this bill will be a first step to-
ward instilling emotional literacy in 
our young people so that they can see 
the common humanity amongst each 
other and grow to be empathetic 
adults. 
I sincerely hope that we can model 
that behavior as well for them. In 
times like this, when our country is 
growing ever more divided, we need to 
be teaching our children not the art of 
division but how to accept one another, 
respect each other, work with each 
other. 
Danny Fitzpatrick was one of those 
people. He was a boy who loved to love. 
He accepted each person as they are 
and always found in them a shared hu-
manity. 
Society, our society, allowed a beau-
tiful young boy like Danny to be 
bullied so horribly that he took his 
own life at 13 years old. 
This should not happen in America. 
This cannot happen in America, not to 
any family. But his mother, Danny’s 
mother, took her pain and she made it 
her mission to ensure that no other 
family experiences this agony. 
We cannot get Danny back. We can-
not erase his family’s pain. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New York. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, we cannot get Danny back. 
We cannot erase his family’s pain. But 
what we can do right here is give 
Danny’s life meaning and protect all of 
America’s children, our children, by 
passing this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I once again want to 
thank the staff, Chairman SCOTT, and 
Ranking Member FOXX
for bringing 
this overdue bill to the floor. I urge my 
colleagues, on behalf of America’s chil-
dren, to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of H.R. 3659, Danny’s 
Law, and I thank my friends and col-
leagues, MAX
ROSE
and HALEY
STE-
VENS, for introducing this important 
bill. 
Across our communities, a national 
epidemic of suicide has devastated far 
too many families. One of the most 
heartbreaking aspects of this crisis 
concerns the loss of children to suicide, 
often a result of pervasive, over-
whelming bullying by their peers. 
Danny’s Law was named for Daniel 
Fitzpatrick, a 13-year-old boy whose 
experiences with bullying led him to 
take his own life. 
By directing the President to estab-
lish an antibullying roundtable to 
make recommendations pertaining to 
bullying in elementary and secondary 
schools, this legislation would make 
ending bullying a national priority. 
People of all ages, including children, 
suffer from the effects of unmet mental 
health needs, with consequences that 
can be dire. In taking the issue of sui-
cide among children out of the shad-
ows, we can begin to overcome the stig-
ma around mental health challenges, 
which remain far too prevalent in our 
society. 
In addition to the sometimes extreme 
consequences of pervasive bullying, 
students who are bullied by their class-
mates are not able to fully pursue their 
education or receive equal access to 
the academic and social opportunities 
their schools provide. Preventing and 
ending bullying will remove this major 
barrier. 
Together, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, let us pass this bill in re-
membrance of Daniel Fitzpatrick and 
in support of his family. 
To every young person in our com-
munities who may feel judged or alone, 
you will never be alone. You are free to 
be who you are. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for her lead-
ership, and I thank the outstanding co-
sponsors of this legislation, my friend 
Mr. ROSE and my colleague from New 
Jersey, for coming together around a 
concept that I have had the disappoint-
ment and sadness to work on for most 
of my tenure in the United States Con-
gress, and that is bullying. 
I am so saddened that we have to 
name bills after young people, precious 
young people, who have taken their 
lives. 
Bullying—breaking 
news—destroys 
our children. It not only destroys the 
person that is bullied—many times, un-
beknownst to their friends or their 
family so that someone could provide 
them comfort and reaffirm their dig-
nity and their worth because that is 
what bullying does, it says that you 
are not worth anything—but it also de-
stroys the bully. 
So, I am excited about a commission, 
a roundtable established by the Presi-
dent to study bullying in elementary 
and secondary schools in the United 
States. Their report will make rec-
ommendations for combating bullying 
and educating school officials in recog-
nizing it. 
I know how hard school officials 
work. I talk to my superintendents and 
teachers all the time. But they miss 
these things, and that means the child 
suffers alone. 
This bill is named after Daniel 
Fitzpatrick, a 13-year-old boy who died 
on August 11, 2016. He was a loving and 
generous kid who embodied kindness 
and empathy to all. 
He was also the victim of relentless 
physical, mental, verbal, and emo-
tional bullying. No child should have 
to go through that. 
I have worked on this for a very long 
period of time. In 2019, I was able to 
pass H.R. 494, the Tiffany Joslyn Juve-
nile Accountability Block Grant Reau-
thorization and Bullying Prevention 
and Intervention Act. 
I think these bills need to be passed 
immediately by the United States Sen-
ate and, really, go to the President of 
the United States. 
A child is bullied every 7 seconds. Ap-
proximately 11 percent of students sim-
ply do not go to school at least 1 day 
during the school year because they 
feel unsafe. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DELBENE). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for her kind-
ness. 
In the last year alone, an estimated 
160,000 students across the country 
skipped school because they feared 
being bullied. 
I started out by saying, and let me 
specifically note, in 2018, 7.1 percent of 
LGBTQ students were verbally bullied 
because of their sexual orientation. 
Twenty-eight or 30 percent of those 
students were physically bullied. 
Let me just say this. This is an excel-
lent bill. It brings us all together. It 
announces our attempt to respond to 
Danny’s mother, to attack an epidemic 
of bullying in our schools. 
We don’t know where it starts. We 
don’t know where these children come 
from. But we have to help them be-
cause bullying destroys the lives of the 
bully and of the one bullied. 
Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor and senior 
member of the Judiciary and Homeland Com-
mittees, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3659, 
‘‘Danny’s Law,’’ which requires the President 
to establish an Anti-Bullying Roundtable to 
study bullying in elementary and secondary 
schools in the United States. 
The 13-member roundtable will consist of 
relevant stakeholders, including but not limited 
to teachers, parents of schoolchildren, and 
guidance counselors, who will submit a report 
to Congress on best practices concerning bul-
lying upon 270 days of convening. 
This report will provide recommendations for 
combating bullying, educating school officials 
on how to recognize bullying, as well as help-
ing parents to address the early warning signs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4452 
September 16, 2020 
of bullying with their children, so that we can 
take a well-informed step forward in the fight 
against childhood bullying. 
This bill is named after Daniel Fitzpatrick, a 
13-year-old boy who died by suicide on Au-
gust 11, 2016. 
Danny was a loving and generous kid who 
embodied kindness and empathy to all. 
He was also the victim of relentless phys-
ical, mental, verbal, and emotional bullying at 
school. 
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have 
been an active advocate for anti-bullying initia-
tives. 
In January 2019, I was able to achieve 
broad bipartisan support for my bill, H.R. 494, 
the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability 
Block Grant Reauthorization and Bullying Pre-
vention and Intervention Act, which was later 
passed in the House. 
Although some people may dismiss bullying 
as a normal part of growing up, bullying can 
be detrimental to a child’s education and have 
lifelong consequences. 
It is an epidemic that plagues our country 
and too often claims the lives of our youth. 
In Houston, Texas, a child is bullied every 
seven seconds and approximately 11 percent 
of students do not go to school at least one 
day during the school year because they feel 
unsafe. 
On a national level, 90 percent of students 
between the fourth and eighth grades report 
being victims of some type of bullying. 
In the last year alone, an estimated 160,000 
students across the country skipped school 
because they fear being bullied by their peers, 
and many more attended school in a state of 
anxiety and depression, affecting their ability 
to effectively learn. 
Students who are chronically absent be-
tween grades 8 and 12 are over seven times 
more likely to drop out before graduation and 
long-term consequences include poverty as 
well as diminished mental and physical health. 
Furthermore, students who identify or are 
perceived as LGBTQ are often at an in-
creased risk of being bullied. 
In 2018, 70.1 percent of LGBTQ students 
were verbally bullied because of their sexual 
orientation while 28.9 percent of LGBTQ stu-
dents were physically bullied. 
Youth with disabilities and those who are 
socially isolated are also considered as vulner-
able populations when it comes to being tar-
gets for bullying. 
Cyber bullying adds an additional layer of 
complexity when trying to build a safe environ-
ment for all youth. 
In today’s world, our children are exposed to 
technology at a much younger age, which 
raises the likelihood of them being subjected 
to cyberbullying. 
Over 80 percent of teens use a cell phone 
regularly, making it the most popular form of 
technology and a common medium for cyber 
bullying. 
According to the i-SAFE foundation, over 50 
percent of adolescents and teens have been 
bullied online. 
Yet, well over half of young people do not 
tell their parents when they are being bullied 
online. 
By passing Danny’s Law today, we are tak-
ing a tremendous, nonpartisan step towards 
eliminating childhood bullying and promoting 
more inclusive and tolerant environments for 
the next generation. 
I am proud to be a leader on this important 
legislation that will undoubtably improve the 
educational experiences of the next genera-
tion, and I ask all members from both parties 
to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3659. 
b 1200 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Today, we are here for one reason, 
and that is to take action to ensure 
that children like Danny never feel as 
if they have nowhere to turn. No child 
should be subject to cruel treatment 
from his or her peers under any cir-
cumstances, especially in the class-
room. H.R. 3659, Danny’s Law, is a uni-
fied effort to combat bullying and to 
ensure 
students 
have 
a 
safe 
and 
healthy environment to learn and to 
grow. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for taking a 
stand against bullying for our Nation’s 
children. I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on H.R. 3659 so we can move this bill 
swiftly through the legislative process 
and to President Trump’s desk for sig-
nature. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I urge my colleagues today to sup-
port H.R. 3659. 
Once again, I want to thank and com-
mend my colleague, Congressman MAX 
ROSE, for his incredible leadership. He 
has taken tragedy and turned it into 
action. 
Our colleagues are absolutely right 
that this deserves the full attention of 
our government, and it is why we are 
taking this to the highest level of our 
government, to combat bullying. 
This bill honors the life of Danny 
Fitzpatrick, and it recognizes what so 
many families are working to prevent, 
what so many families and commu-
nities across this country never want 
to see happen. It will help end bullying. 
It will protect students across this 
country, and I look forward to seeing 
this bill become law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3659, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise to speak in support of passing 
the 21st Century Community Learning 
Centers Coronavirus Relief Act of 2020, 
which I recently introduced. 
This pandemic and economic crisis 
have disrupted every aspect of life in 
our society. As a result of the pan-
demic, many school districts will pro-
vide academic instruction through re-
mote or hybrid learning models this 
school year. Estimates suggest that 
this fall, nearly 24 million workers 
with children between the ages of 6 and 
14 will have no at-home childcare op-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4453 
September 16, 2020 
For parents struggling to care for 
their children while maintaining their 
professional responsibilities or trying 
to return to the workforce, this time 
has been an unprecedented challenge. 
Those of us who have the honor of rep-
resenting our communities in Congress 
must act. My commonsense, bipartisan 
legislation offers a path forward. 
My bill expresses a sense of Congress 
that the flexibility provided to States 
through the Department of Education’s 
recent waiver for 21st Century Commu-
nity Learning Centers, the only feder-
ally funded initiative dedicated to sup-
porting after-school, before-school, and 
summer learning programs, allows sub-
grantees to provide virtual program-
ming and school-aged childcare during 
the workday to help meet the need of 
students 
and 
families 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
These learning centers, which typi-
cally operate out of Boys & Girls Clubs, 
YMCAs, schools, and other community 
centers, have existing trusted partner-
ships with the school districts that 
they serve. The flexibility expressed in 
my legislation will help school dis-
tricts leverage these partnerships to 
create options for families and to cul-
tivate environments in which K–12 stu-
dents could receive additional aca-
demic support, school-aged children 
could receive safe care during the 
workday, schoolday, and working par-
ents would be able to return to and 
stay in the workforce. 
Over the last several months, I have 
heard from dozens of parents across my 
community who are concerned about 
how they are going to tackle this 
school year, how they will find afford-
able childcare, how they make sure 
their children don’t fall behind aca-
demically, and how they will stay in 
the workforce. I am proud that my leg-
islation supports flexible, affordable, 
school-aged childcare options to create 
safe, structured learning environments 
for students to thrive and to enable 
parents to get back to work. 
Right now, families need options and 
flexibility. Without it, our students, 
our workers, and our economy will all 
pay the price. Putting forward solu-
tions to these issues is a national pri-
ority, not just for the sake of children 
and families across our communities, 
but also for businesses trying to retain 
employees or hire new workers. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join me in passing this leg-
islation with a resounding, bipartisan 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 
8162, the 21st Century Community 
Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief 
Act, bipartisan legislation that ex-
presses Congress’ support for actions 
the Department of Education is taking 
to expand access to in-person care and 
academic support for students during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The 2020–2021 school year looks very 
different for parents, teachers, and stu-
dents. Schools are operating on vary-
ing schedules of in-person, remote, and 
hybrid instruction to ensure that stu-
dents remain safe while not falling be-
hind academically. 
Most students will be saddled with 
the challenges of beginning a new year 
of school while making up for lost 
learning caused by the disruptions 
from COVID–19. 
Working parents of school-aged chil-
dren face unique challenges during the 
pandemic. Finding childcare when in- 
person instruction is not offered has 
become a burdensome task for many 
families, especially low-income fami-
lies. 
If these hardworking families aren’t 
able to return to work, our Nation’s 
economic recovery will be severely im-
peded. Today, we are here to address 
this growing problem by passing the bi-
partisan 
21st 
Century 
Community 
Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief 
Act. 
The 21st Century Community Learn-
ing Center, CCLC, program, is a feder-
ally funded after-school program. The 
grantees are locally operated, often by 
school districts and community-based 
organizations, and primarily serve stu-
dents attending schools with high con-
centrations of low-income families. 
Students at 21st CCLCs participate in 
academic and enrichment programs, 
receive support services such as tutor-
ing and mentoring, and their families 
are encouraged to actively participate 
in their children’s studies. 
Since after-school program staff have 
established relationships with students 
and have experience providing sup-
portive services, they are uniquely 
qualified to assist students during the 
2020–2021 school year. 
Under current law, 21st CCLCs must 
operate during ‘‘non-school hours,’’ 
such as before and after school or dur-
ing summer breaks. The Department of 
Education announced plans to address 
this by offering waivers to States to 
allow 21st CCLCs to expand their hours 
of operation during the 2020–2021 school 
year. 
The legislation under consideration 
today expresses Congress’ support for 
the Department of Education to grant 
flexibility for 21st CCLCs to operate 
outside of this year’s constraint for the 
upcoming school year. 
With these new flexibilities, 21st 
CCLCs will be able to provide program-
ming during regular school hours and 
offer in-person care to students who 
cannot be in school throughout the 
regular day. Further, 21st CCLCs will 
be able to serve students in person or 
virtually in order to better accommo-
date the various needs of the families 
during the year. 
I thank Representative WILD
for 
leading this important legislation, and 
I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on H.R. 
8162. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. LEE). 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, on behalf of the people of Nevada’s 
Third Congressional District, I rise 
today in support of the 21st Century 
Community 
Learning 
Centers 
Coronavirus Relief Act. 
We are now over 3 weeks into the 
school year in my district, and it is 
clear that we need to do so much more 
to support our students, parents, and 
schools. 
Whether it is at-home or in-person 
learning, the pandemic is throwing 
challenges at our kids that make learn-
ing more difficult and, in some cases, 
nearly impossible. This isn’t just a 
struggle for students, but also for par-
ents who are also juggling work while 
supervising remote learning for their 
kids. 
We can’t just ask parents to make 
the best of a bad situation. It should be 
on Congress to help our working fami-
lies. Whether in a school building or in 
a living room, we need to create a sup-
portive, engaging environment for our 
students, while giving parents the 
flexibility to still work and provide for 
their families—and that is what this 
bill does. 
It will provide additional academic 
support for K–12 students by offering 
access to safe, supervised learning dur-
ing the day to take some weight off the 
shoulders of working parents. This will 
be done by bringing together schools, 
community organizations, nonprofits, 
local government, and after-school pro-
viders to expand access to academic re-
sources and create flexibility for fami-
lies. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the 
21st 
Century 
Community 
Learning 
Centers Coronavirus Relief Act to give 
our students and parents the flexibility 
and the resources they need to make 
this school year count. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 8162, the 
21st 
Century 
Community 
Learning 
Centers Coronavirus Relief Act. 
As the coronavirus pandemic con-
tinues, schools throughout Rhode Is-
land and all across America have been 
forced to close their doors, some for 
the rest of the year. 
b 1215 
This trend means that high-quality 
after-school and summer programs will 
be even more necessary to provide 
young people with a safe, enriching 
place to learn and grow. We have an ob-
ligation to ensure that these programs 
have the resources and flexibility need-
ed to meet the needs of America’s chil-
dren. 
Currently, more than 2 million chil-
dren and families rely on NITA

H4454 
September 16, 2020 
LOWEY 21st Century Community Learn-
ing Centers for after-school and sum-
mer 
learning 
programming. 
With 
schools across the country closing, 
many students are unable to obtain 
services provided by out-of-school pro-
grams, including academic assistance, 
a safe place to be when their parents 
are working, and access to a hot meal 
or healthy snack. 
We know after-school programming 
provides one of the most effective ways 
to keep children safe in the late after-
noon and early evening hours and 
keeps them on the right path to com-
pleting school. These programs help 
students develop essential life skills 
such as problem-solving, critical think-
ing, and healthy living. 
Additional flexibility for 21st Cen-
tury Community Learning Centers will 
help improve access to these critical 
programs and will make sure that 
after-school programming is available 
to students and families to keep chil-
dren safe and engaged and to strength-
en families and communities through-
out the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
the bill, and I thank the gentlewoman 
for yielding me the time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, working parents 
across the country are currently grap-
pling with the challenge of finding af-
fordable childcare as COVID–19-related 
school closures force many students to 
stay home. Parents are eager to return 
to work, but without reliable, afford-
able childcare options, students, work-
ers, and the economy will be impacted 
significantly. 
H.R. 8162, the bipartisan 21st Century 
Community 
Learning 
Centers 
Coronavirus Relief Act, supports the 
Department of Education’s efforts to 
extend a commonsense solution that 
will help parents return to the work-
force by increasing access to safe, sup-
portive environments for students. By 
giving 21st CCLCs greater flexibility to 
provide normal programming during 
school hours and in-person care to stu-
dents during the regular school day, 
parents can return to work with peace 
of mind, knowing that their children 
are in good hands and not falling be-
hind academically. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I thank Rep-
resentative WILD for introducing this 
legislation. I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on H.R. 8162, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague across the aisle, Mr. VAN 
DREW, for supporting this very impor-
tant piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support H.R. 8162. It is legislation that 
will provide vital support for students, 
for parents, for employers, for schools, 
and for our economy as we all grapple 
with the effects of this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in support of H.R. 8162, the ‘‘21st 
Century 
Community 
Learning 
Centers 
Coronavirus Relief Act’’. 
H.R. 8162, expands the allowable uses for 
subgrants provided under the 21st Century 
Community Learning Centers Program for the 
2020–2021 school year. 
Specifically, the bill allows eligible entities 
that are awarded program subgrants for com-
munity learning centers to use these sub-
grants to: (1) carry out activities that advance 
student academic achievement and support 
student success, regardless of whether such 
activities are conducted in person, virtually, 
during school hours, or when school is in ses-
sion; and (2) provide in-person care during the 
regular school day and when full-time in-per-
son instruction is not available to students. 
(Currently, the program only supports aca-
demic enrichment opportunities for children 
during non-school hours or periods when 
school is not in session.) 
Because of the ongoing COVID–19 threat to 
health, the spring of 2020, saw the forced clo-
sure of all K–12 and post-secondary education 
institutions in the Nation. 
There is an urgent need to meet the edu-
cation crisis the Nation is facing with an ade-
quate response. 
Data from the National Center for Education 
Statistics shows that one out of every four 
households in Texas does not have access to 
broadband internet, and some 8 million homes 
do not have a computer or a smartphone. 
Because of this bill, Community Learning 
Centers will provide academic enrichment op-
portunities during school and non-school hours 
for children, particularly students who attend 
high-poverty and low-performing schools. 
The program helps students meet state and 
local student standards in core academic sub-
jects, such as reading and math; offers stu-
dents a broad array of enrichment activities 
that can complement their regular academic 
programs; and offers literacy and other edu-
cational services to the families of participating 
children. 
Technological difficulty is just one of the 
reasons students could become disengaged 
from the virtual learning environment. 
Learning Centers are needed because de-
spite being one of the most developed coun-
tries in the world, the United States has one 
of the highest rates of childhood poverty glob-
ally. 
Preliminary data on the Huston Independent 
School District (HISD) from the Texas Edu-
cation Agency shows 23.4 percent of students 
lost contact or stopped engaging with learning 
during the Spring. 
This is more than twice statewide average, 
the total statewide for unengaged students is 
nearly 500,000. 
One key factor is poverty, children born or 
raised in poverty face a number of disadvan-
tages, most evidently in education. 
Poverty reduces a child’s readiness for 
school because it leads to poor physical 
health and motor skills, diminishes a child’s 
ability to concentrate and remember informa-
tion, and reduces attentiveness, curiosity and 
motivation. 
Children in poverty are also finding the chal-
lenge of keeping up with school work more dif-
ficult due to COVID–19. 
One of the most severe effects of poverty in 
the United States is that poor children enter 
school with this readiness gap, and it grows 
as they get older. 
Children feel alienated from society; suffer 
insecurities because of their socioeconomic 
status; fear the consequences of their poverty; 
endure feelings of powerlessness; and are 
angry at society’s inability to aid in their strug-
gles. 
Children from lower-income families are 
more likely than students from wealthier back-
grounds to have lower test scores, and they 
are at higher risk of dropping out of school. 
Students with low income backgrounds who 
complete high school are less likely to attend 
college than students from higher-income fam-
ilies. 
For some children, the effects of poverty on 
education present unique challenges in break-
ing the cycle of generational poverty and re-
duce their chances of leading rewarding, pro-
ductive lives. 
In addition to these challenges’ children liv-
ing in poverty often do not have access to 
necessary computer technology, broadband 
internet connection to participate in remote 
learning, or the nutritional support that pro-
vides adequate food, which is essential to 
learning. 
We know that this crisis created by COVID– 
19 was difficult for the Nation’s approximately 
56.6 million students, 3.5 million full- and part- 
time public school teachers, and parents. 
This bill is necessary as the beginning of 
the fall school year continues to pose chal-
lenges to educating the nation’s children. 
To meet the challenges created by COVID– 
19, the HISD school board passed a budget 
amendment earlier this month to spend $31 
million on devices for students. By the end of 
the year, the district says it plans to have dis-
tributed nearly 125,000 devices and hotspots 
to students. 
The statute being amended only allows 
learning centers and related grants to be fund-
ed when schools are in session. 
At a time when learning centers are more 
important to education because COVID–19 is 
impacting schools’ functioning as the primary 
source of full time learning we need to act to 
support this education resource. 
Children are depending on Congress to 
make education possible during COVID–19. 
There are: 50.8 million students in public 
schools, and 5.8 million students in private 
schools. 
Among the 50.8 million students enrolled in 
elementary and secondary public schools: 1.4 
million were in prekindergarten; 3.7 million 
were in kindergarten; 35.5 million attended el-
ementary through middle school (K and 8th 
grade); and 15.3 million attended high school 
(9 through 12th grade). 
Through 2028, enrollment is projected to in-
crease to 51.4 million. 
In 2018, 3.3 million students graduated from 
high school, marking nearly a 1 percent in-
crease from 2017; 3.7 million were expected 
to graduate in 2020; 3.3 million from public 
high schools; and 0.4 million from private 
schools. 
The average per-student expenditure in 
public schools is $13,440. 
In 2019, there are approximately 16,800 
school districts in the United States. 
13 percent of all public school students 
were served by the Individuals with Disabilities 
Act for the 2015–2016 school year. 
Between 2000 and 2016, total public school 
enrollment increased for 32 states.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) and the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on S. 881, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am very excited 
we are here today to pass S. 881, the 
PROSWIFT Act, a bill that I have been 
working on for almost 5 years. 
Space weather is the electromagnetic 
activity that comes from the Sun, and 
it can have significant societal, eco-
nomic, national security, and health 
implications both here on Earth and in 
space. 
About 5 years ago, Dr. Dan Baker 
from the University of Colorado Boul-
der testified in front of the Science, 
Space, 
and 
Technology 
Committee 
about the dangers of space weather 
events on the electric grid. At that 
hearing, he said that had an observed 
July 2012 space weather event actually 
hit Earth, we would ‘‘still be picking 
up the pieces.’’ 
That testimony stuck with me, and 
when Senators GARY PETERS and CORY 
GARDNER introduced the first version 
of this bill a few months later, I was 
eager to start working on the House 
companion. 
Over the last 4 years, the House and 
the Senate have been working toward 
the shared goal of passing this legisla-
tion into law, but we have had a few 
differences we have had to work out. I 
am glad we finally worked through 
those differences and can send this bill 
to the President’s desk today. 
In 2015, the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy pulled together the 
best and brightest from within the var-
ious agencies working on space weath-
er to produce the National Space 
Weather Strategy and Action Plan. 
These documents helped renew our 
focus on the critical research and oper-
ational needs to improve our space 
weather enterprise, and OSTP updated 
the strategy and action plan in 2019. 
The PROSWIFT Act builds upon this 
work by providing the structures need-
ed for the continued advancement of 
heliophysics research, collection of 
new data and observations, and im-
provements to our modeling and fore-
casting. 
This bill also, for the first time, 
clearly delineates the roles and respon-
sibilities of the key Federal agencies 
involved in space weather, including 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration, the 
National Science Foundation, the De-
partment of Defense, the Federal Avia-
tion Administration, and the United 
States Geological Survey, as well as 
the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy. 
Importantly, our legislation brings in 
new voices from the academic commu-
nity, commercial space weather sector, 
and space weather forecast end-users. 
These communities will participate in 
the space weather advisory group cre-
ated in the bill as well as on a new gov-
ernment-academia-commercial round-
table we create to be facilitated by the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and Medicine. 
Finally, the bill also sets up formal 
research-to-operations and operations- 
to-research mechanisms to help break 
down barriers between the research 
community and operational forecasters 
by encouraging sharing of information 
and requirements to improve the pipe-
line of new observations, technologies, 
models, and forecasts. 
This bill will improve our under-
standing of space weather and better 
prepare us for its impacts on the elec-
tric power grid, communications net-
works, satellite operations, and air-
lines. It will also help NASA under-
stand the radiation environment for 
our astronauts on the International 
Space Station, on their way back to 
the Moon, and, most importantly, on 
their journey to Mars by 2033. 
We have been working on this bill for 
a long time now, and I want to thank 
the gentleman from Alabama, Rep-
resentative MO BROOKS, for his help 
pushing for this bipartisan legislation. 
I also want to thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON and her staff for their support 
over the years, getting us to where we 
are today, and Ranking Member FRANK 
LUCAS for his support of the bill. I also 
want to thank my friend, Senator 
GARY PETERS from Michigan, who hap-
pens to be in the House Chamber today, 
for all the work he and his staff have 
put into this effort over the years. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 881, the Promoting Research and Ob-
servations of Space Weather to Im-
prove the Forecasting of Tomorrow 
Act, commonly referred to as the 
PROSWIFT Act. 
Fluctuations in solar magnetic activ-
ity create variations in the environ-
ment between Earth and the Sun that 
can affect technologies in space and 
here on Earth. This phenomenon is 
what we refer to as space weather. 
For the most part, space weather has 
a minimal effect here, but increased 
solar activity and severe events can 
create widespread problems and even 
disrupt our electric grid. Satellites 
that have less protection from Earth’s 
magnetic field are especially vulner-
able. 
Significant space weather events are 
not a new phenomenon, and we have 
evidence dating back more than 150 
years of severe space weather events 
affecting human activity. However, the 
impact of these events is much greater 
now that we rely on satellites and re-
mote sensing for everything from cell 
phone communication to energy pro-
duction to GPS navigation. 
For example, farmers in Oklahoma 
have been at the forefront of utilizing 
precision agriculture to help ensure the 
most effective use of our resources 
when planting crops, a technology de-
pendent on GPS. 
Space weather is also a national se-
curity issue. Our military has a variety 
of assets in orbit around the Earth, 
which could potentially be harmed by 
electromagnetic 
interference. 
They 
rely on satellites built by NASA and 
operated by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric 
Administration, 
or 
NOAA, for timely and accurate infor-
mation about potential space weather 
events. 
It is not only technology that is 
threatened by space weather events. 
There are the astronauts who currently 
work on the International Space Sta-
tion more than 200 miles above the 
Earth’s surface and will one day serve 
on missions to the Moon and Mars. 
While we have developed techniques 
and technology to reduce the threats 
posed by increased radiation exposure 
due to a severe solar event, we have 
more work to do to mitigate these haz-
ards to our astronauts as we venture 
beyond low-Earth orbit. 
In short, severe space weather can 
have significant effects on each and

every one of us. That is why timely and 
accurate information from agencies 
like NASA and NOAA is so important. 
These agencies play an important role 
in better monitoring and forecasting 
space weather. 
The bill before us today represents a 
good faith effort by the House and Sen-
ate to provide a framework that will 
provide for better coordination across 
the Federal Government. This is espe-
cially timely given that we are about 
to enter a period of increased solar ac-
tivity, which will create more space 
weather events. 
I am pleased this legislation includes 
an amendment I introduced during the 
markup of this legislation. My amend-
ment creates a pilot program that will 
ensure that emerging private-sector 
companies will have a seat at the table 
and will be able to provide monitoring 
and forecast data, which the Federal 
Government can purchase and utilize 
in their space weather forecasts. 
I thank the sponsors of this legisla-
tion for their work on this important 
topic. I ask my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time, Madam Speaker. 
b 1230 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN), 
my friend, the chair of the Sub-
committee on Space and Aeronautics. 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. PERL-
MUTTER for yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, I begin by saying, I 
rise in strong support of S. 881, the Pro-
moting Research and Observations of 
Space Weather to Improve the Fore-
casting 
of 
Tomorrow, 
or 
the 
PROSWIFT Act, and recognize my col-
league, Mr. PERLMUTTER, for all of his 
efforts on this, as well as my fellow 
Oklahoman and ranking member of the 
committee, Mr. LUCAS, and particu-
larly, too, recognize Senator PETERS 
for all of his work on this important 
issue, which I think can often go 
underrecognized and unappreciated. 
I was proud to cosponsor the House 
version of the PROSWIFT Act, H.R. 
5260, with Mr. PERLMUTTER and many 
others, which passed out of the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology, and I would like to, again, rec-
ognize the leadership on this bipartisan 
and 
bicameral 
bill, 
including 
Mr. 
BROOKS and others for the committee’s 
work to advance an understanding of 
and the importance of predictive capa-
bilities of space weather. 
The PROSWIFT Act is really the cul-
mination of years of work and reflects 
input from hearings, including joint 
hearings, the Subcommittee on Envi-
ronment and the Subcommittee on 
Space and Aeronautics, which I chair. 
Though, it can feel remote, space 
weather can have a significant impact 
on us right here on Earth, as you have 
heard. Space weather, such as solar 
flares, solar wind and geomagnetic 
storms of energized, charged particles 
can affect everything from our electric 
power grids, to satellites, to aviation 
operations, human spaceflight oper-
ations, and much more. 
In short, severe space weather events 
pose significant risks to our infrastruc-
ture, and in turn, our economy and our 
national security. This is an important 
time and an important thing to take 
action on. 
Madam Speaker, space weather fore-
casting is years, if not decades, behind 
the maturity of terrestrial forecasting, 
and that is why S. 881, the PROSWIFT 
Act, is critical. 
Without 
improvements 
in 
space 
weather forecasts and prediction, we 
run the risk of potential disruptions to 
our 
critical 
infrastructure. 
The 
PROSWIFT Act establishes U.S. policy 
to help prepare and protect us against 
the social and economic impacts of 
space weather phenomena by sup-
porting 
actions 
to 
improve 
space 
weather forecasts and predictions. 
This act makes clear the importance 
of federal agency contributions, and 
their effective coordination, including 
NASA. To carry out research on the 
Sun and its effects on near-Earth envi-
ronments, NASA operates research sat-
ellites whose measurements are also 
essential to NOAA’s operational space 
weather forecasts. 
The PROSWIFT Act moves us for-
ward from relying, in part, on these re-
search assets, some of which have been 
operating for over two decades, to de-
veloping a strategic and coordinated 
approach to sustaining a baseline of 
space weather operations and better 
predicting space weather events. 
It is also important to enabling our 
future goals of space, including explo-
ration goals to send humans to the 
Moon and to Mars, as laid out in H.R. 
5666, the bipartisan NASA Authoriza-
tion Act of 2020. Improvements in space 
weather forecasts will help keep our as-
tronauts safe from harmful space radi-
ation, which can be elevated during 
solar storms. 
In addition, H.R. 5666 complements S. 
881, the PROSWIFT Act, by directing 
the NASA administrator to establish a 
space weather research and applica-
tions program. 
Madam Speaker, the Senate passed S. 
881 on July 27, 2020, and now the House 
must act to make sure this important 
legislation becomes law. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BROOKS). 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I support the Promoting Re-
search 
and 
Observations 
of 
Space 
Weather to Improve the Forecasting of 
Tomorrow Act, called the PROSWIFT 
Act. 
I thank Congressman PERLMUTTER 
for his leadership on this important 
issue and for working with me in the 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology to advance the Senate bill, 
which is identical to the House version 
we have worked so long and hard on. 
The PROSWIFT Act advances Amer-
ica’s understanding of potentially se-
vere weather events and damaging con-
sequences. 
Space weather is a collection of phys-
ical processes beginning at the Sun 
with solar winds and ultimately affect-
ing human activities on Earth and in 
space. Humanity needs a better under-
standing of these solar winds and their 
interaction with Earth’s atmosphere. 
The PROSWIFT Act is a step towards 
that better understanding. 
In Alabama’s Marshall Space Flight 
Center, scientists and engineers are at 
the forefront of space weather re-
search. Under the PROSWIFT Act, 
their enhanced research will advance 
our understanding of and ability to 
forecast space weather. 
The PROSWIFT Act recognizes that 
space weather not only impacts us on 
Earth, it can and will impact us in deep 
space exploration. 
For 
example, 
before 
we 
launch 
NASA’s 
Artemis 
man-to-Moon-mis-
sions that pave the way to Mars mis-
sions, it is best that we should better 
understand how space weather phe-
nomena impacts life in space, sat-
ellites, and other space instrumenta-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, it is critical that we 
properly forecast space weather and 
prepare for and protect astronauts 
from the dangers of solar radiation. 
Madam Speaker, I, again, thank my 
colleague, Mr. PERLMUTTER, for his 
leadership on space weather and his 
partnership on the PROSWIFT Act. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote for 
Senate Bill 881 and send it to President 
Trump to sign. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my friend from Alabama for 
being a good partner and really work-
ing with me and with the Senate to re-
fine and get this thing into an excel-
lent product. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the following letters of support 
we received for the PROSWIFT Act: a 
letter from the University of Colorado 
at Boulder; a letter from the Univer-
sity Corporation for Atmospheric Re-
search; a letter from the American 
Commercial Space Weather Associa-
tion; a letter from the American Astro-
nomical Society; a letter from the 
American Geophysical Union; a letter

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4460 
September 16, 2020 
Throughout the Space Age, we have discov-
ered and accumulated a vast knowledge on 
the governing physical processes of the var-
ious regions of both deep space as well as the 
space surrounding near-Earth. This knowl-
edge has provided an opportunity to expand 
our reach into the solar system and beyond, 
as well as increase our Earth observation ca-
pabilities. Over time, the increased utiliza-
tion of satellites continues to have a broad 
reach across our society, including within 
the security, public safety and commercial 
realms. The data we acquire from these sat-
ellites is vital in order to protect our na-
tional security and economic interests, and 
interruptions stemming from increased solar 
activity could prove detrimental in carrying 
out these important functions. 
As a result, the call to increase our space 
weather forecasting and mitigation capabili-
ties was amplified by the National Acad-
emies Decadal Survey in Solar and Space 
Physics in 2012, and again through the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy’s Space 
Weather Action Plan that was released in 
October 2015. Through these calls, it has be-
come a national imperative to streamline 
the mechanisms designed to help develop and 
maintain a forecasting system that not only 
help to predict space weather events, but to 
respond to them. We believe the PROSWIFT 
Act will provide a collaborative framework 
for the federal government and its agencies 
to work together alongside academic, inter-
national and commercial space communities 
to advance this critical undertaking. 
An important component of space weather 
research and monitoring is collaboration and 
cooperation among its many stakeholders. 
The legislation’s call for the development of 
a 
Space 
Weather 
Government-Academic- 
Commercial Roundtable in addition to a 
Space Weather Advisory Group will foster 
collaboration among academic, commercial 
and space weather end users designed to pro-
vide the federal interagency working group 
with guidance from key constituent groups. 
In addition, the renewed expansion of basic 
and multidisciplinary research as well as the 
federal partnership with the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 
to ‘‘implement missions that meet the 
science objectives identified in solar and 
space physics decadal surveys’’ is a great 
step forward toward increasing our nation’s 
future forecasting and responsive capabili-
ties. Finally, the strong focus on research 
and operational capacity within this legisla-
tion underscores the important role aca-
demic institutions will continue to play in 
addressing the needs of federal agencies. 
Here at LASP (and I, daresay, across all of 
CU-Boulder), we take great pride in our ex-
pertise in research to operations and oper-
ations to research (R2O/O2R) capabilities, 
and we stand ready to assist in the coopera-
tive model outlined in the H.R. 5260 to ad-
vance our national space weather forecast 
and response capabilities. 
Again, we applaud this legislation and its 
aim to streamline federal efforts working in 
conjunction with academic and commercial 
space partners in order to better understand 
and predict space weather activities and 
their impacts on our national interests. 
Thank you for your outstanding support and 
leadership, and please continue to think of 
us as a resource and partner going forward.

Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PERLMUTTER: As a re-
search organization committed to better un-
derstanding the earth system, including the 
critical role of the sun in geospace sciences, 
the University Corporation for Atmospheric 
Research (UCAR) would like to thank you 
for proposing H.R. 5260—Promoting Research 
and Observations of Space Weather to Im-
prove the Forecasting of Tomorrow Act—and 
voice our strong support for PROSWIFT. 
H.R. 5260 will enhance the integration of ex-
isting national efforts to understand, pre-
dict, prepare for, and mitigate space weather 
and will strengthen economic and national 
security as a result. 
Scientists are just beginning to understand 
the interactions between our sun and the 
Earth. Given the growing national impor-
tance and reliance on technology, it is crit-
ical that we expand our scientific under-
standing of the interactions between the sun 
and Earth so that we may improve fore-
casting and mitigate the effects of space 
weather events. Coupled with the National 
Space Weather Strategy and National Space 
Weather Action Plan, this legislation sets 
national priorities to increase and improve 
space weather observations, science, and 
forecasting abilities. 
H.R. 5260 lays out a clear road map for the 
space weather enterprise which consists of 
the public, private and academic sectors, and 
in so doing will enable better research to op-
erations transitions that will benefit all 
communities that rely on technology both 
on the ground and in space that can be af-
fected by these sun-driven events. The cre-
ation of the Space Weather Advisory Group 
is to be lauded as an excellent first step as it 
will establish the necessary linkages be-
tween government, academia and the private 
sector in an organized way that is currently 
done in an ad hoc fashion. This new approach 
will allow Congress to be kept up to date on 
the latest advances in science that are trans-
lated into operations and will help to iden-
tify the highest priority areas that are in 
need of resources in both the research and 
operational realms. 
Most of our understanding of space weath-
er is based on experience and knowledge 
gained over the last 30 years, though the his-
torical record indicates space weather events 
of much greater severity have occurred with-
in the last 150 years. Impacting airlines, 
GPS, and electric utilities, space weather 
events in recent history resulted in economic 
consequences in the tens of millions of dol-
lars. Estimates for damage resulting from a 
repeat of the worst known event of the last 
150 years range from $1–2 trillion in the first 
year alone. Scientists do not know the likeli-
hood of such an event recurring, or even 
whether such an event is the worst-case sce-
nario. Thus, predictability of such events 
needs to be the driver for all research in the 
space weather domain. As part of the need to 
organize the research optimally to meet this 
threat, and in line with input from your re-
cent hearing, UCAR encourages the com-
mittee to establish the Geosciences Direc-
torate within the National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) to be the lead within NSF for all 
space weather research activities. 
Additionally, we commend H.R. 5260 for its 
emphasis on ‘‘Sustaining Ground-Based Ob-
servational Capability’’ and we believe it is 
imperative to draw the distinction between 
astronomy and space weather research in 
this regards. Ground-based observations are 
less costly and are the appropriate way to 
prove an observational capability and ensure 
risk reduction for instruments that may 
later be flown in space. Current ground-based 
telescopes used in astronomy are inadequate 
for space weather research so this section is 
vital to ensure a robust ‘‘ground to space’’ 
strategy. 
H.R. 5260 would provide clear roles and re-
sponsibilities to the various federal agencies 
responsible for understanding, predicting, 
and forecasting space weather, including the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (NASA), the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA), the Na-
tional Science Foundation (NSF), and the 
Department of Defense (DOD). As these are 
all agencies with which we work regularly, 
this clarity would enable us to pursue re-
search that will have the best impact on so-
ciety’s ability to predict and respond to 
space weather events. 
Again, thank you for your tireless work 
supporting the science community in Colo-
rado and across the United States. We appre-
ciate your efforts on this bill and many 
other endeavors. 
Best regards, 
DR. ANTONIO J. BUSALACCHI, 
President, University Corporation 
for Atmospheric Research. 
AMERICAN COMMERCIAL SPACE 
WEATHER ASSOCIATION, 
December 6, 2019. 
JEFF O’NEIL, 
Legislative Director, Office of Congressman Ed 
Perlmutter (C0–07), Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. O’NEIL: On behalf of the Amer-
ican Commercial Space Weather Association 
(ACSWA), we are writing to express our 
strong support for H.R. 5260, Promoting Re-
search and Observations of Space Weather to 
Improve 
the 
Forecasting 
of 
Tomorrow 
(PROSWIFT) Act. The current version of the 
bill highlights the growing importance of 
space weather across a broad range of tech-
nology areas. We are pleased to see ref-
erences to the expanding role of the commer-
cial sector in addressing gaps in fundamental 
knowledge, providing the means to develop 
and improve observational resources, ena-
bling the research to operations and oper-
ations to research enterprise, and mitigating 
the 
impacts 
of 
space 
weather 
threats. 
ACSWA stands ready to aid federal agencies 
in undertaking this critically important en-
terprise. 
The studies and survey mandated by the 
bill will be extremely helpful to the space 
weather community as it mobilizes to ad-
dress the high priority science and tech-
nology objectives that continue to drive 
space weather activities in federal labora-
tories, academic institutions, and the pri-
vate sector. ACSWA member companies 
strive to continue agency and academia 
close partnerships that have been established 
and strengthened through the years. We 
fully anticipate that the five members of the 
PROSWIFT Advisory Committee from the 
commercial sector will ensure that ACSWA 
expertise, assets, and resources will be fully 
integrated in the space weather strategies 
emerging from the PROSWIFT-mandated ac-
tions. 
ACSWA fully supports the observational 
priorities outlined in the PROSWIFT bill. 
More specifically, ACSWA feels it is impor-
tant to continue L1 observations with a fol-
low-on mission while simultaneously work-
ing aggressively toward developing an L5

platform. The combination of solar observa-
tions from L1 and L5 orbits provide an un-
precedented view of the disturbances from 
which most space weather effects at Earth 
originate. Additionally, the rapidly improv-
ing capabilities in monitoring the ionosphere 
using radio occultation techniques will ad-
dress a long-standing challenge in miti-
gating space weather effects on navigation 
and communication systems. The data sets 
generated by these observations will offer 
many opportunities for commercial sector 
companies to develop tailored products for 
government and industry customers. 
We note that the PROSWlFT bill provides 
some latitude to federal agencies in how the 
commercial sector will be involved in space 
weather research and operations. ACSWA 
hopes that the language in the bill provides 
sufficient encouragement for agencies to 
overcome long-standing barriers that inhibit 
full cooperation and involvement with the 
commercial sector, not all of which are 
based on fiscal constraints. Again, the com-
mercial sector members of the PROSWIFT 
Advisory Committee will have an important 
role to play in identifying strategies for tak-
ing full advantage of the private sector in 
meeting space weather goals. The pilot pro-
gram removed from the earlier version of 
this bill would have effectively demonstrated 
the merits of such strategies. ACSWA looks 
forward to seeing such pilot programs imple-
mented by federal agencies as they strive to 
meet space weather research and operational 
goals. 
While we don’t want to-jeopardize the pas-
sage of the bill, there are additional small 
changes we believe could be added to the bill 
to ensure that all available technologies and 
processes are applied to reduce space weath-
er hazards: 
Page 7, lines 23–24 (Section 60601(d)(3)): 
change ‘‘Each Federal agency participating 
in the space weather . . .’’ to ‘‘All Federal 
agencies participating in the space weather 
. . . .’’ 
p. 18., line 19 in section 60603(d)(2)): ‘‘. . . 
airflow 
imagers, 
spectrometers, 
interferometers, airborne radiation instru-
mentation, and . . . .’’ 
ACSWA agrees with the Agency changes of 
Page 21–22; 23–5: ‘‘. . . transition National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Na-
tional Science Foundation, United States 
Geological Survey, and other relevant Fed-
eral agencies space weather research find-
ings, models, and capabilities, as appro-
priate, to the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration and the Department 
of Defense’’ to: ‘‘transition space weather re-
search findings, models, and capabilities, as 
appropriate, from the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration, National Science 
Foundation, United States Geological Sur-
vey, other relevant Federal agencies, the 
academic community, and the commercial 
space weather sector to the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration and the De-
partment of Defense’’ 
ACSWA agrees with the Agency changes of 
Page 22, 9–15: ‘‘. . . communicate National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES PERLMUTTER
AND 
BROOKS: On behalf of the over 8,500 members 
of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) 
and its Solar Physics Division (SPD), we 
write to express our strong support for the 
Promoting Research and Observations of 
Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting 
of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Bill and to thank 
you for your leadership on this vitally im-
portant topic. The legislation that you have 
introduced in the House is comprehensive in 
its scope, addressing key aspects of space 
weather and its significance for national se-
curity, communications, and human and 
robotic space operations in low Earth orbit 
and interplanetary space. 
In particular, we endorse the following 
components of the bill, all of which are es-
sential to further our understanding of the 
causes and effects of space weather, as well 
as to advance our ability to reliably forecast 
space weather events: 
the recognition of the wide impact of space 
weather and the concomitant call for strong 
cooperation between stakeholder agencies 
such as NOAA, NSF, NASA, FAA, and the 
Departments of Defense and the Interior 
through the establishment of an interagency 
working group through the National Science 
and Technology Council on space weather, 
with accountability to Congress through the 
submission of pertinent reports; 
the call for the formation of a space weath-
er advisory group with broad representation 
across the academic, commercial, and non- 
governmental end-user communities to iden-
tify new technologies to aid in under-
standing and forecasting space weather; 
the implementation of an integrated strat-
egy that identifies the observation capabili-
ties necessary for near-real-time solar and 
coronal mass ejection imaging and that must 
be sustained beyond the lifetime of current 
ground-based and space-based assets in order 
to maintain capability; 
the development of space weather instru-
mentation and competitive, peer-reviewed 
proposals for conducting research, including 
interdisciplinary research, in subjects that 
further the understanding of solar physics, 
space physics, and space weather and its im-
pacts; and 
increased 
engagement 
and 
cooperation 
with the international, academic, and com-
mercial space weather communities on the 
observational infrastructure and scientific 
research necessary to advance the fore-
casting of and preparation and protection 
from space weather phenomena. 
Thank you for your attention to this time-
ly and important issue. The membership of 
the SPD, which includes the nation’s fore-
most experts in many of the areas addressed 
in this legislation, stands ready to assist in 
any way it can. If there is anything we can 
do, please do not hesitate to contact us. 
Sincerely, 
MEGAN DONAHUE,

DEAR
CONGRESSMEN
PERLMUTTER
AND 
BROOKS: On behalf of the American Geo-
physical Union (AGU) and its 60,000 mem-
bers, I am writing to endorse H.R. 5260, The 
Promoting Research and Observations of 
Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting 
of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act, and to thank 
you for crafting this important legislation. 
Space weather has the potential to inflict 
trillions of dollars of damage on our econ-
omy, weaken our national security, and alter 
our way of life. The National Research Coun-
cil estimates that a severe space weather 
event has the potential to inflict $1–2 trillion 
dollars of economic and societal damage in 
the first year alone and impact more than 
130 million people. To recover from such an 
event could take from 4–10 years. Moreover, 
space weather fluctuations are not limited to 
rare catastrophic events but regularly im-
pact our society and economy. It’s estimated 
that the average economic impact of mod-
erate geomagnetic events on the electric 
power grid in the U.S. is $7 to $10 billion per 
year. Additionally, advancing our under-
standing of the Sun is essential for the 
United States to realize its space exploration 
ambitions. 
Given the economic and opportunity costs 
associated with space weather, we support 
the bill’s approach of creating a national, co-
ordinated plan to advance our understanding 
of the relationship between the Sun and 
Earth and to ensure the development of new 
technologies and forecasting capabilities to 
mitigate the threat posed by space weather. 
We appreciate the bill’s recognition that a 
partnership between industry, academia, and 
federal agencies is needed to further our un-
derstanding and capacity to address the im-
pacts of space weather. As a community 
dedicated to advancing the understanding of 
Earth and space science, we applaud the 
bill’s intent to further scientifically in-
formed action towards disaster preparation, 
mitigation, response, and recovery. 
AGU looks forward to working with you as 
this legislation advances. 
With best wishes, 
CHRISTINE W. MCENTEE, 
CEO/Executive Director, 
American Geophysical Union.

OFFICE OF RESEARCH, 
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
January 7, 2020. 
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE PERLMUTTER: On be-
half of the University of Michigan Office of 
Research, I write to thank you for intro-
ducing the Promoting Research and Observa-
tions of Space Weather to Improve the Fore-
casting of Tomorrow (PROSWIFT) Act (H.R. 
5260). 
As this legislation notes, severe space 
weather events ‘‘could have significant soci-
etal, economic, national security, and health 
impacts.’’ This bipartisan legislation is es-
sential to helping us predict and mitigate 
such events that could drastically disrupt 
our economy and national security. 
We are pleased this legislation outlines 
clear roles and responsibilities for the rel-
evant federal agencies that are involved with 
improving our understanding, prediction and 
forecasting of space weather events. Impor-
tantly, PROSWIFT recognizes the necessity 
of engagement and cooperation with the aca-
demic community, among other sectors, by 
establishing 
a 
Space 
Weather 
Advisory 
Group whose membership will be equally 
comprised of a diverse stakeholder group in-
cluding the academic community. Addition-
ally, this bill creates a Space Weather Gov-
ernment-Academic-Commercial Roundtable 
to facilitate advances in space weather pre-
diction and forecasting, among other items, 
which is necessary to efficiently advance our 
understanding of space weather. 
The University of Michigan is focused on 
helping to improve the characterization, pre-
diction, and mitigation of space weather 
events. Researchers on our campus study the 
effects of large solar eruptions and coronal 
mass ejections, and develop high-perform-
ance computational models to describe and 
predict hazardous conditions. If any of our 
experts on campus can ever be a resource, 
please do not hesitate to reach out. 
Once again, thank you for your leadership 
on this legislation. We appreciate your con-
tinued commitment to improving efforts to 
predict and mitigate space weather events 
and we hope the full House of Representa-
tives will approve this legislation expedi-
tiously. 
Sincerely,

ington, DC. 
Hon. FRANK LUCAS, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR JOHNSON AND RANKING MEMBER 
LUCAS: We are writing on behalf of the Uni-
versity of New Hampshire (UNH) to voice our 
strong support for the PROSWIFT Act (H.R. 
5260). UNH urges swift approval of this bipar-
tisan legislation critical to ensuring that the 
United States is equipped to predict, miti-
gate, and respond to the hazards that space 
weather poses to our national security and 
economic wellbeing. 
Federal support for research and tech-
nology development is essential to improv-
ing the Nation’s space weather readiness. 
Current space weather monitoring capabili-
ties rely on an observational infrastructure 
that is incapable of providing the lead time 
required to undertake proper space weather 
mitigation measures. We applaud the Com-
mittee’s recognition of the importance of 
fundamental research into the physical proc-
esses behind space weather. Such research 
will enable more sophisticated prediction ca-
pabilities and equip decision-makers with 
the information and tools necessary to avert 
crippling damage to our satellites, electric 
power grid, and other sensitive assets that 
underpin our economy and national security 
apparatus. 
UNH is especially supportive of Sections 
60603 and 60604. The former would strengthen 
support for critical ground-based and space- 
based space weather observational platforms 
while the latter would identify specific roles 
and responsibilities for research, develop-
ment, and R20/02R activities at relevant 
agencies such as NASA, NSF, and NOAA. 
Particularly important to UNH and many of 
its peer institutions is the legislation’s com-
mitment to advancing the consensus-based 
priorities identified by the scientific commu-
nity and articulated in the National Acad-
emies Solar and Space Physics Decadal Sur-
vey. 
We thank you for putting forward this im-
portant piece of legislation, and we hope 
that UNH can serve as a resource for you as 
you continue working to address the press-
ing issue of space weather.

DEAR MR. PERLMUTTER: I write to express 
support for H.R. 5260, the Promoting Re-
search and Observations of Space Weather to 
Improve 
the 
Forecasting 
of 
Tomorrow 
(PROSWIFT) Act, and appreciation for your 
leadership on this legislation that aims to 
improve efforts for predicting and mitigating 
space weather events. 
By delineating clear roles and responsibil-
ities to federal agencies that study and pre-
dict space weather, the legislation will im-
prove resources and make critical measure-
ment data available for the research commu-
nity to model the frequency and severity of 
space weather events. This information will 
be helpful for monitoring space weather 
events, particularly coronal mass ejections 
and geomagnetic disturbances that can cause 
interruptions to the power grid and in sat-
ellites, affecting critical infrastructure that 
is dependent on communications technology 
and electricity. 
With an increase in focus and attention to 
space weather activities provided by this leg-
islation, researchers with expertise in data 
assimilation and big data analysis at Penn 
State and around the nation can conduct 
risk analysis and plan for responses to space 
weather events before they occur. Penn 
State researchers and educators in meteor-
ology, geoinformatics, energy business and 
engineering, as well as social science, look 
forward to the data opportunities made 
available through this legislation. 
If I or any of our experts in the College of 
Earth and Mineral Sciences can be of assist-
ance to you, please feel free to contact my 
federal relations colleagues. 
Sincerely, 
LEE R. KUMP, 
John Leone Dean. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I also include in the RECORD an op-ed 
from The Hill dated September 10, 2020, 
by Dr. Antonio Busalacchi, who sup-
ports this bill. 
[From the Hill, Sept. 10, 2020] 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO FINALIZE SPA WEATHER 
BILL AS SOLAR STORMS POSE HEIGHTENED 
THREAT 
(By Antonio J. Busalacchi) 
The COVID–19 pandemic has left us more 
dependent than ever on advanced informa-
tion and communication technologies, with 
many businesses and schools relying on a 
range of remote services. In this environ-
ment, 
building 
resilience 
to 
potential 
threats that can disrupt society’s essential 
daily activities is critical. 
For this reason, it is heartening to see 
Congress advancing legislation to better pro-
tect the nation from solar storms that spew 
millions of tons of charged matter toward 
Earth. Such space weather events can distort 
GPS signals, scramble satellite operations, 
and disable communications and power sys-
tems, with serious consequences for our 
economy and armed services—a particularly 
major concern as the Pentagon prepares for 
future space-based conflicts. 
Significant space weather events occur 
every decade or so with far-reaching and de-
structive consequences. A powerful solar 
storm in 1989 cut off power to millions of Ca-
nadians, and major storms in 2003 affected 
more than half of Earth-orbiting spacecraft. 
Just three years ago, solar flares caused 
radio blackouts for hours during critical 
emergency response efforts to approaching 
hurricanes in the Caribbean and nearby re-
gions. 
A solar superstorm poses even greater 
risks. The so-called Carrington Event in 1859, 
which ignited fires in telegraph offices, 
would have catastrophic impacts on today’s 
society, potentially resulting in widespread 
damage to power grids, communication net-
works, and other technologies that would 
take weeks, months, or even years to repair. 
Even before COVID–19 led to an increased re-
liance on e-based technologies, the National 
Academy of Sciences estimated that such an 
event could result in as much as $2 trillion in 
damages—or more than 10 times the costs of 
Hurricane Katrina. 
Despite a growing array of advanced sat-
ellites that monitor the sun, forecasters can-
not accurately predict when a major storm 
will erupt from the sun and begin its one- to 
four-day journey toward Earth. Observations 
provide only limited information about 
where the storm will hit and its potential for 
damage until it is within about a half-hour 
of Earth. This does not leave satellite opera-
tors and utility managers with sufficient no-
tice to fully shield vulnerable electronics 
and power down critical hardware. 
To improve its forecasting capability, the 
nation needs to invest in a new generation of 
space- and ground-based instruments that 
can provide continual measurements of mag-
netic fields throughout the solar atmos-
phere. These measurements would alert us to 
conditions that are conducive for storms and 
help us determine whether an incoming 
storm will penetrate our atmosphere and 
target certain regions on Earth, or harm-
lessly glance off. 
Scientists are also working toward more 
advanced computer models of the sun. One of 
their primary goals is to stimulate the build-
up of energy in twisted magnetic fields with-
in the solar atmosphere, enabling forecasters 
to predict when the fields will erupt and 
spew tons of charged particles toward Earth. 
Fortunately, Congress is starting to take 
action on this important issue. The Senate 
last month unanimously passed legislation 
to improve scientific understanding and fore-
casting of space weather. The Promoting Re-
search and Observations of Space Weather to

Tomorrow 
(PROSWIFT) Act would break down barriers 
between the nation’s researchers and fore-
casters, coordinate the efforts of key federal 
agencies, and establish an integrated strat-
egy across the federal government to address 
space weather research and observational 
needs. 
This legislation, appropriately, has strong 
bipartisan support. Sens. Gary Peters (D– 
Mich.) and Cory Gardner (R–Colo.) co-spon-
sored the Senate bill. In the House of Rep-
resentatives, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D–Colo.) is 
working with eight co-sponsors on both sides 
of the aisle to advance the measure. 
With just months remaining on the cal-
endar of the current Congress, the House 
must provide the final passage of this impor-
tant legislation. 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBLE 
FUNDING TO STATES TO DEPLOY 
Our 
solar 
forecasting 
capabilities 
at 
present are comparable to terrestrial weath-
er prediction before the Second World War 
when communities had little warning of in-
coming storms. Since then, government 
agencies, private companies, and university 
researchers have collaborated on landmark 
advances in weather prediction, which have 
saved countless lives, fostered economic 
growth, and supported military operations. 
We have now arrived at a pivotal moment 
in forecasting solar storms. At a time when 
society is more dependent than ever on ad-
vanced e-based technologies, the PROSWIFT 
Act lays out a clear road map for bringing 
together expertise in government, the pri-
vate sector, and academia to forecast these 
damaging events. If Congress and the admin-
istration successfully enact the legislation, 
this predictive capability will provide a crit-
ical safeguard for America’s economic com-
petitiveness and national security, and for 
the business and school technologies that we 
have all come to rely upon. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
just reading quickly from the op-ed as 
to why we are doing this: 
‘‘Significant space weather events 
occur every decade or so with far- 
reaching and destructive consequences. 
A powerful solar storm in 1989 cut off 
power to millions of Canadians, and 
major storms in 2003 affected more 
than half of the Earth-orbiting space-
craft. Just 3 years ago, solar flares 
caused radio blackouts for hours dur-
ing critical emergency response efforts 
to approaching hurricanes in the Carib-
bean and nearby regions. 
‘‘A 
solar 
superstorm 
poses 
even 
greater risks. The so-called Carrington 
Event in 1859, which ignited fires in 
telegraph offices, would have cata-
strophic impacts on today’s society, 
potentially resulting in widespread 
damage to power grids, communication 
networks, and other technologies.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I, again, would like 
to thank the sponsors of this legisla-
tion for their hard work on this impor-
tant topic. 
I encourage all my colleagues to sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
supporting this legislation and for both 
sides of the Capitol. We have been 
working on it for a long time. There 
has been a lot of serious interest in 
this piece of legislation because of the 
potential for damage that a space 
weather event can have. 
As I said before, we have worked to-
gether on the Committee on Science, 
Space and Technology and the Senate 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation to advance this bill for 
almost 5 years. 
Each iteration of the bill brought 
new perspectives and new ideas, and we 
worked across two administrations. We 
put all that work together into the bill 
before us today, and I, again, thank the 
Members and staff who helped make 
this possible. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this space 
weather bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of S. 881 ‘‘The Pro-
moting Research and Observations of Space 
Weather to Improve the Forecasting of Tomor-
row, or PROSWIFT, Act.’’ 
Space weather is something the American 
public may not yet have an awareness of, but 
it has the potential to impact society across 
the world—every single day. 
Geomagnetic storms or solar flares can 
cause disturbances in both space and the 
near-Earth environment. 
These effects can reach the Earth’s surface 
and pose significant risks to humans operating 
in space, some aircraft flights, space commu-
nications, GPS-based services, the electric 
grid, pipelines, and other space-based and 
ground-based infrastructure. 
In short, space weather events can have 
major societal, national security, economic, 
and health impacts. 
That is why I was an original co-sponsor of 
Mr. 
PERLMUTTER’s 
H.R. 
5260, 
‘‘The 
PROSWIFT Act,’’ which is the basis of the text 
of the Senate-passed space weather bill we 
are voting on today. H.R. 5260 was widely 
supported by the space weather community, 
including academia, industry, and not-for-profit 
entities. 
I want to commend my colleague on the 
House Science Committee, Mr. PERLMUTTER, 
for tirelessly pushing to make this legislation a 
reality for over five years. 
He and his dedicated staff worked closely 
with my Committee staff, with the staff of the 
Committee’s Ranking Member, as well as staff 
of our colleagues in the Senate, to bring this 
legislation to the floor today. 
Unlike previous attempts to move this legis-
lation, I am proud that the bill being voted on 
today came out of regular order in the House 
Science Committee. 
This bill took into consideration feedback 
from major stakeholders in the space weather 
community and was strengthened during our 
markup process to include a commercial 
space weather pilot program. It was further 
strengthened following negotiations with our 
colleagues in the Senate. 
I am pleased that this bill represents both 
bicameral and bipartisan agreement on this 
important issue. 
I have supported the overall agenda to ad-
vance the space weather enterprise and en-
sure capabilities for space weather observa-
tion and forecasting for many years and Con-
gresses before this. I am looking forward to fi-
nally passing this legislation today, and have 
it enacted after years of hard work. 
Being able to better understand and predict 
space weather events is vitally important to 
protecting our society, our economy, and our 
critical national infrastructure. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan and good 
governance bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
PERLMUTTER) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 881. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

RURAL STEM EDUCATION ACT 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4979) to direct 
the Director of the National Science 
Foundation to support STEM edu-
cation and workforce development re-
search focused on rural areas, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4979 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rural STEM 
Education Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The supply of STEM workers is not 
keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs 
of the public and private sector, resulting in 
a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills 
shortage. 
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the United States will need one mil-
lion additional STEM professionals than it is 
on track to produce in the coming decade. 
(3) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
wages, more opportunities for advancement, 
and a higher degree of job security than non- 
STEM jobs. 
(4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United 
States who live in rural settings are signifi-
cantly under-represented in STEM. 
(5) According to the National Center for 
Education Statistics, nine million students 
in the United States—nearly 20 percent of 
the total K–12 population—attend rural 
schools, and for reasons ranging from teach-
er quality to shortages of resources, these 
students often have fewer opportunities for 
high-quality STEM learning than their peers 
in the Nation’s urban and suburban schools. 
(6) Rural areas represent one of the most 
promising, yet underutilized, opportunities 
for STEM education to impact workforce de-
velopment and regional innovation, includ-
ing agriculture. 
(7) The study of agriculture, food, and nat-
ural resources involves biology, engineering, 
physics, chemistry, math, geology, computer 
science, and other scientific fields. 
(8) Employment in computer and informa-
tion technology occupations is projected to 
grow 11 percent from 2019 to 2029. To help 
meet this demand, it is important rural stu-
dents have the opportunity to acquire com-
puting skills through exposure to computer

(9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the 
United States use high-speed broadband to 
work, learn, access healthcare, and operate 
their businesses, while 19,000,000 individuals 
in the United States still lack access to 
high-speed broadband. Rural areas are hard-
est hit, with over 26 percent of individuals in 
rural areas in the United States lacking ac-
cess to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 
percent of individuals in urban areas in the 
United States. 
SEC. 3. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RURAL

(a) PREPARING RURAL STEM EDUCATORS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Director shall provide 
grants on a merit-reviewed, competitive 
basis to institutions of higher education or 
nonprofit organizations (or a consortium 
thereof) for research and development to ad-
vance innovative approaches to support and 
sustain high-quality STEM teaching in rural

Texas (Ms. JOHNSON) and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 4979, the bill now under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4979, the Rural STEM Edu-
cation Act. 
I thank Ranking Member LUCAS and 
Representative MCADAMS
for intro-
ducing this important bill, which I am 
proud to cosponsor. 
The COVID–19 crisis has revealed and 
exacerbated the many harmful inequi-
ties that persist in our society. Rural 
communities have not been spared. 
Broadband access and the so-called 
digital divide have long been a barrier 
to high quality STEM education for 
students in rural areas. STEM teachers 
in rural communities are stretched 
thin, often teaching multiple STEM 
subjects at multiple grade levels. While 
dedicated 
and 
hardworking, 
these 
teachers have limited resources and 
support, including training that is up- 
to-date and optimized for schools in a 
rural setting. 
Rural school districts also have lim-
ited access to library equipment to pro-
vide students with hands-on experi-
ences and a glimpse of what it is like 
to actually do science. 
The sudden transition to remote edu-
cation across the Nation that has oc-
curred due to the pandemic has ampli-
fied these challenges for rural commu-
nities. 
School districts are getting creative. 
Some are setting up internet hotspots 
in the parking lot. Some students can 
download 
assignments 
and 
submit 
homework. Others are sending out 
paper packets for students without re-
liable transportation. While these stop-
gap measures are helpful, they are not 
enough. 
And students are falling behind. If we 
had invested in improving remote 
teaching and mentoring and improving 
broadband access before the pandemic 
hit, rural communities would have 
been better prepared to weather this 
crisis. 
The Rural STEM Education Act pro-
vides for research and development to 
improve 
access 
to 
evidence-based 
STEM education opportunities in rural 
schools and provide teachers with the 
support and tools they need to teach 
more effectively. 
I am particularly excited about the 
NIST rural connectivity prize competi-
tion and the Broadband Research and 
Development Working Group, which 
would advance research and technology 
development to expand broadband ac-
cess across the country. 
The bill also provides for a much- 
needed assessment of Federal invest-
ments 
in 
rural 
STEM 
education 
through the National Academies of 
Science and the Government Account-
ability Office. 
This bill is a critical step forward to 
ensuring that more students have ac-
cess to a high-quality STEM education 
and that we are equipped with the 
STEM workforce we need to face future 
challenges like this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member of the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology, Mr. LUCAS, for 
introducing this bill, and also for work-
ing collaboratively with me and the 
staff to ensure it was a bipartisan ef-
fort. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1245 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4979, the Rural STEM Edu-
cation Act. I am pleased to be leading 
this important bipartisan bill and 
would like to thank Congressman 
MCADAMS, Congressman BAIRD, Con-
gresswoman JOHNSON, and the other 43 
Members of Congress who cosponsored 
this bill for their support. 
Now more than ever, America’s pros-
perity and security depend on an effec-
tive, inclusive science, technology, en-
gineering, math, and computer science 
workforce, or STEM. 
Nationally, 80 percent of the fastest 
growing occupations depend upon mas-
tery of STEM skills. The number of 
STEM jobs is growing three times fast-
er than non-STEM jobs. Over the next 
decade, the STEM shortage is antici-
pated to reach 1 million positions, ac-
cording to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics. 
To succeed in this job market, our 
students need to be equipped with solid 
skills in science and engineering. 
Meeting this demand starts in the 
classroom. With STEM education be-
coming so fundamental to success in 
any industry, finding ways to improve 
the quality of STEM learning every-
where is of critical importance. 
Over 9 million students in the United 
States, nearly 20 percent of the K–12 
population, attend rural schools. In 
Oklahoma, that number is even higher. 
One-third of our students attend rural 
schools. 
These students face a number of bar-
riers to accessing high-quality STEM 
learning, 
including 
a 
shortage 
of 
trained science and math teachers, sin-
gle teachers teaching multiple grade 
levels, a lack of access to advanced 
STEM courses, and few local university 
and industry partners. 
Since the start of the coronavirus 
pandemic, we have seen even further 
proof that rural students are at a dis-
advantage, given the unreliability or 
nonexistent broadband access many 
must deal with while currently dis-
tance learning. 
The Rural STEM Education Act sup-
ports research and development activi-
ties to improve our understanding of 
the challenges rural communities are 
facing in providing and sustaining 
quality STEM education programs and 
take steps to address them. 
H.R. 4979 helps develop best practices 
for accessing and using computer-based 
and online STEM education courses. It 
will help schools combine online STEM 
education with hands-on training and 
apprenticeships, to give students both 
theoretical 
and 
practical 
under-
standing of science and math skills. 
This bill will also take steps to ad-
dress one of the great key obstacles to 
rural 
STEM 
education: 
reduced 
connectivity and, in particular, the 
lack of broadband access. Of the 21 mil-
lion Americans who lack access to 
broadband, the majority live in rural 
areas. With the increase in online 
learning, 
we 
need 
to 
prioritize 
connectivity for all students. 
This bill directs the National Insti-
tutes of Standards and Technology to 
establish a prize competition to stimu-
late innovations in technologies to de-
ploy broadband connectivity to under-
served rural communities. 
It also establishes a working group to 
set key research priorities for improv-
ing broadband access so rural commu-
nities can enjoy the same connected-
ness as the rest of the country. 
This bill includes a number of provi-
sions to help provide rural educators 
with the tools they need to be success-
ful, both in the classroom and online. 
It supports opportunities for rural 
educators to refresh and enhance their 
own STEM knowledge, such as training 
in computer science and research op-
portunities at Federal laboratories and 
universities. These experiences provide 
rural 
educators 
with 
high-quality 
STEM skills and practices they can 
take back to their classrooms and pass 
on to their students. 
Lastly, the major focus of the bill is 
broadening the participation of rural

students in STEM. One way we can do 
this is by emphasizing place-based 
learning, which gives students direct 
access to the STEM knowledge in their 
communities and local environments. 
Place-based learning connects stu-
dents to the science that is right out-
side their doors, whether it is studying 
animal science with FFA, learning 
about local ecosystems out on the prai-
ries or in forests, or developing the 
technological skills required to operate 
increasingly complex and computerized 
farm equipment. 
That direct experience engages stu-
dents and helps them understand that 
STEM skills matter to everyone, not 
just scientists in white lab coats. 
Taken together, the measures in this 
bill will dramatically improve rural 
STEM education. I believe rural areas 
represent one of the greatest yet most 
underutilized opportunities for tal-
ented students to enhance the United 
States’ future STEM workforce. 
I am pleased this bill has gained the 
endorsement of the STEM Education 
Coalition, the Afterschool Alliance, 
Battelle 
and 
STEM-X, 
National 
Science Teaching Association, Amer-
ican Chemical Society, American Geo-
physical Union, Microsoft, Girl Scouts 
of the USA, National FFA Organiza-
tion, and Association of Public and 
Land-grant Universities. 
I again would like to thank Chair-
woman 
JOHNSON, 
Representative 
MCADAMS, Representative BAIRD, and 
their staff for working with me on this 
bill. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ to better STEM edu-
cation for America’s rural students, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MCADAMS). 
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my bipartisan bill 
with Representative LUCAS, the Rural 
STEM Education Act. 
More than 9 million students nation-
wide attend a rural school. And in my 
home State of Utah, 15 percent of our 
students live in rural communities. 
Unfortunately, there are many bar-
riers to receiving quality STEM edu-
cation for rural community students. 
There is a shortage of math and science 
teachers and a high rate of teacher 
turnover. Plus, access to high-speed 
and reliable internet is more limited in 
these areas. 
Today, as we live through this pan-
demic, we know how important reliable 
internet is for kids and teachers. This 
bill would provide effective online 
teaching tools that educators can use 
in our rural areas. 
It will also increase teacher recruit-
ment and improve internet access. It 
will task several government agencies 
to work together to advance research 
and provide teachers with what they 
need to effectively teach STEM to 
more students in rural communities. 
When bright young minds have the 
opportunity to explore science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math, you 
never know where their intelligence 
and their curiosity might lead them or 
what new discoveries we will be able to 
trace back to the education they re-
ceived starting in their hometown. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation, and I thank my 
friend from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) for 
championing this. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Indi-
ana (Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 4979, the Rural 
STEM Education Act. I am proud to be 
an original cosponsor of this legisla-
tion. 
As one of only two Members of Con-
gress with a Ph.D. in science, I under-
stand 
the 
importance 
of 
teaching 
science, 
technology, 
engineering, 
mathematics, and computer science at 
an early age. 
Quality STEM education is essential 
to train the next generation of Amer-
ican minds. Fostering children’s nat-
ural curiosity is critical to expanding 
their interest in STEM. 
More than 9 million students in the 
United States attend rural schools, so 
investing in rural areas represents one 
of the most significant opportunities 
for STEM education. 
H.R. 4979 will support research and 
development to identify the barriers 
rural students face in accessing high- 
quality STEM education, and it will 
develop innovative solutions to im-
prove rural students’ participation and 
advancement in the STEM fields. 
In a time when our rural students are 
facing more barriers than ever before 
because of COVID, this bill can play an 
important role in helping these stu-
dents remain in the STEM pipeline. 
With the shift to online learning in 
recent months, it is more important 
than ever that we invest in the best 
practices and the scalability of online 
STEM education courses for our rural 
communities. 
In addition to examining opportuni-
ties for online education, this legisla-
tion also promotes the importance of 
place-based 
learning. 
Place-based 
learning is a tremendous tool to broad-
en participation by rural students in 
STEM. 
It uses local heritage, geography, and 
opportunities to study STEM. By con-
necting them with the science that is 
right outside their front door, rural 
students will have hands-on learning 
opportunities, even while the courses 
remain online. 
I would be remiss if I did not mention 
one of the greatest barriers our rural 
students face, which is broadband ac-
cess. Over 20 million Americans lack 
access to broadband, and the majority 
live in these rural areas. This bill 
prioritizes connectivity for all students 
and supports technologies to deploy 
broadband to these underserved rural 
areas. 
We must also recognize the key role 
educators play, especially rural teach-
ers who teach multiple grade levels 
within a STEM discipline. H.R. 4979 
provides rural STEM educators with 
resources and experiences that they 
can bring back to the classroom and 
use with their students. 
I would like to thank Ranking Mem-
ber LUCAS for his leadership on this 
bill. By improving access to STEM op-
portunities in rural schools, the Rural 
STEM Education Act will ensure that 
communities in less populated areas 
are not overlooked and that the intel-
lectual power of our next generation 
continues to grow. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I might consume. 
In closing, I again want to thank 
Chairwoman JOHNSON, Representative 
MCADAMS, Representative BAIRD, and 
their staff for working with me on this 
bill. 
I am grateful to my colleagues for 
helping me move this forward in a bi-
partisan way. I want rural students to 
have every opportunity to compete and 
contribute STEM skills both to their 
communities and to the national work-
force. 
The Rural STEM Education Act gives 
teachers better tools to teach science 
and math, leverages local resources to 
engage students in key subjects, and 
addresses the lack of broadband access 
in rural communities. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I would like to take a moment again 
to thank the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. LUCAS) for working with the 
members of this committee on this leg-
islation and thank Mr. MCADAMS and 
Dr. BAIRD. 
It is my hope that we can pass this 
bill out of the House today and, hope-
fully, work with our colleagues in the 
Senate to get this bipartisan bill, as 
well as many others, of course, we have 
sent over there passed into law. 
This bill is needed more now than it 
was when we started out, so I would 
hope that the Senate will see the need 
to pass this bill as soon as possible. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JOHNSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4979, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL) and the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
4990, the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in support of H.R. 4990, the Elec-
tion Technology Research Act. This bi-
partisan legislation, which I was proud 
to introduce alongside my friend Rep-
resentative 
GONZALEZ, 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, and Ranking Member LUCAS, 
is a practical, commonsense bill that 
would yield important results for the 
security of our elections. 
Madam Speaker, 48 days from today, 
Americans will exercise one of their 
most important duties in a democratic 
society and vote. Amidst a global pan-
demic, targeted attacks on our democ-
racy by our adversaries, and political 
unrest, Americans deserve to know 
that our elections are secure. 
Last summer, the Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee held a 
hearing with voting technology and 
election administration experts to dis-
cuss U.S. election system technologies 
and research recommendations made in 
the 2018 National Academies report, Se-
curing the Vote: Protecting American 
Democracy. This report and the input 
we received during that hearing made 
it clear that targeted research designed 
to protect our voting systems is not 
only wise but necessary. 
The COVID–19 global pandemic has 
put stress on our healthcare system, 
caused nearly 200,000 deaths in the 
United States, devastated our econ-
omy, and underscored racial inequities 
in our society. But Americans are resil-
ient. They will mail in their ballots or 
go to their polling stations to cast 
their vote. Why? Because they care 
deeply about our country and our de-
mocracy. In return, one of our jobs in 
government is to ensure the American 
people have confidence in the integrity 
of our election process. 
Nearly 20 years ago, Congress en-
acted the Help America Vote Act. 
HAVA provided funding for States to 
purchase new voting equipment and 
created the Election Assistance Com-
mission. It also included provisions to 
advance 
research, 
technology, 
and 
standards development for voting sys-
tems. 
There are more than 10,000 voting ju-
risdictions across the United States. 
HAVA mandated that the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology 
work with the EAC to develop vol-
untary voting systems guidelines for 
voting machines. 
Today, all U.S. States and territories 
look to those guidelines to make deci-
sions to about technology procurement 
and securing their elections. My legis-
lation modernizes the 20-year-old pro-
visions in HAVA to reflect the state of 
today’s technology and the nature of 
today’s election security challenges. 
The most important new areas of re-
search and standards development this 
bill supports are online voter registra-
tion systems and electronic poll books. 
Forty States now offer online voter 
registration, and many States also use 
e-poll books on election day for quick 
access to voter information. 
The Election Technology Research 
Act also creates centers of excellence 
at NIST and the National Science 
Foundation to further study a range of 
important election technology chal-
lenges, including cybersecurity, pri-
vacy, reliability, and interoperability. 
We must strive to ensure the highest 
standards are in place for all tech-
nologies used in the election process. 
And while the overwhelming majority 
of election experts agree that the tech-
nology is not yet ready for secure vot-
ing over the internet, this bill does 
support continued research on internet 
voting. 
In addition to the security and integ-
rity of voting equipment, voting acces-
sibility is also important. Keeping se-
curity at the forefront, we should make 
it as easy as possible for all voters to 
cast their ballots. H.R. 4990 supports 
research at NSF to study ways to im-
prove the voter interface with different 
voting technologies, including accessi-
bility, ballot design, and ballot-mark-
ing devices. 
Beyond the ballot box, this bill sup-
ports education and training of stu-
dents and design of curricula focused 
on organizational management and in-
formational technology needs of the 
election community. 
Finally, H.R. 4990 directs NIST to 
provide technical assistance to States 
for their election needs, including risk 
assessments and risk-limiting audits. 
This is a bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. 
The 
Members 
of 
the 
House 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee worked to put together a bipar-
tisan bill that represents our values 
and our commitment to protecting our 
democracy. It recognizes the simple 
fact that technology advances quickly. 
So, when it comes to something as fun-
damental as ensuring the security and 
the sanctity of our elections, it is in-
cumbent upon Congress to pass legisla-
tion to make sure our election tech-
nology is modern, secure, and state of 
the art. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely thank 
Representative GONZALEZ, Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, and Ranking Member LUCAS 
for joining me as cosponsors on this 
bill, as well as my other colleagues on 
the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee and in the House for adding 
their names to this legislation. 
I urge all Members to support the 
Election Technology Research Act, and 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues to see it enacted in 
law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4470 
September 16, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, 
Washington, DC, February 10, 2020. 
Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology, 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN JOHNSON: I am writing 
to you regarding H.R. 4990, the ‘‘Election 
Technology Research Act of 2019.’’ This 
measure, introduced on November 8, 2019, 
was referred to your committee as well as 
the Committee on House Administration. 
The Committee on House Administration 
agrees to waive further consideration of H.R. 
4990. The Committee does so with the under-
standing that by waiving further consider-
ation of this bill it does not waive any future 
jurisdictional claims over similar measures. 
In addition, the Committee reserves its right 
to seek conferees on any provisions within 
its jurisdiction which are considered in a 
House-Senate conference and requests your 
support if such a request is made. 
I would appreciate the inclusion of this let-
ter and a copy of your response in the Con-
gressional Record during consideration of 
H.R. 4990 on the House floor. 
Sincerely, 
ZOE LOFGREN, 
Chairperson. 
HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES, COM-
MITTEE
ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND 
TECHNOLOGY, 
Washington, DC, February 10, 2020. 
Chairperson ZOE LOFGREN, 
Committee on House Administration, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRPERSON LOFGREN: I am writing 
to you concerning H.R. 4990, the ‘‘Election 
Technology Research Act of 2019,’’ which was 
referred to the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, and in addition to the Com-
mittee on House Administration on Novem-
ber 8, 2019. 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this bill. I recognize that the 
bill contains provisions that fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Committee on House Ad-
ministration. I appreciate that your Com-
mittee will waive further consideration of 
H.R. 4990 and that this action is not a waiver 
of future jurisdictional claims by the Com-
mittee on House Administration over this 
subject matter. 
I will make sure to include our exchange of 
letters in the legislative report for H.R. 4990 
and in the Congressional Record. Thank you 
for your cooperation on this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4990, the Election Technology Re-
search Act of 2020. I am proud to join 
Representatives SHERRILL
and GON-
ZALEZ and Chairwoman JOHNSON as an 
original cosponsor of this bill. 
The security and integrity of elec-
tions is fundamental to American de-
mocracy and should not be a partisan 
issue. To that end, this bipartisan bill 
takes necessary and appropriate steps 
to update research activities at the Na-
tional Science Foundation and the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology to promote the security and the 
modernization of U.S. voting systems. 
The bill also establishes an election 
systems center of excellence at NIST 
to foster collaborations between NIST, 
universities, and State and local elec-
tion officials to address election secu-
rity challenges. 
The U.S. Constitution vests the re-
sponsibility of administering elections 
with State and local governments, and 
we in Congress should respect the 
boundaries of this well-established sys-
tem of federalism. 
However, the Federal Government 
has an important role to play in pro-
viding 
guidance 
and 
assistance 
to 
States on election systems. The Fed-
eral Government can and should work 
closely with States and local govern-
ment officials to deal with foreign and 
domestic cyber threats. 
This bill provides the research tools 
to do just that, and it does so without 
imposing costly or burdensome man-
dates on States. Instead, this bill 
leverages an established system to pro-
vide voluntary guidelines to State and 
local election officials to use as they 
see fit. 
I appreciate Chairwoman JOHNSON 
and her staff for working with us to 
produce a good, bipartisan bill. I urge 
my colleagues to support it, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON). 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4990, 
the Election Technology Research Act 
of 2020. I am proud to join my col-
leagues, Representatives SHERRILL and 
GONZALEZ, in introducing this bipar-
tisan bill. 
Just a few weeks from now, Ameri-
cans will begin casting their ballots in 
the 2020 election. They will also do so 
in the midst of a global pandemic and 
a divided country. The stakes could not 
be higher. We face many threats to our 
democratic institutions, including to 
our most sacred right and responsi-
bility as citizens: our vote. 
Unfortunately, the greatest threats 
today are the spread of misinformation 
and the active disenfranchisement of 
American citizens. Those are human 
vulnerabilities that are amplified by 
technology. However, we must not lose 
sight of the vulnerabilities inherent to 
the technologies that we use to cast 
and count our votes. 
As it has across all aspects of our 
lives and society, technology has be-
come an integral part of the election 
process. The use of technology in elec-
tions has changed significantly since 
the enactment of Help America Vote 
nearly 20 years ago. 
H.R. 4990 authorizes research and 
standards development activities at 
the National Science Foundation and 
the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology to help modernize and 
secure our election systems and ensure 
that they are accessible to all. 
The legislation also includes a small 
amendment to HAVA to ensure that 
the standards and guidelines developed 
to help States secure their election 
systems cover all of the election tech-
nologies in use today. 
This legislation represents just a 
tiny piece of what is needed in terms of 
policy, leadership, and funding to en-
sure free, fair, transparent, and secure 
elections, but it is an important piece, 
if not in time for this election, then for 
all future elections. 
I want to again thank my colleagues, 
Representatives SHERRILL
and GON-
ZALEZ, for their hard work and our col-
leagues on the House Administration 
Committee for their support in getting 
this bill to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this good, bipartisan 
legislation. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. GONZALEZ). 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, election security is an issue 
essential to our democracy, and I am 
glad to see the House taking up legisla-
tion today to address it in a bipartisan 
manner. 
My 
colleague, 
Representative 
SHERRILL, and I have been working to-
gether on this issue since being sworn 
in, and I am glad to join her, as well as 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON
and 
Ranking 
Member LUCAS, in supporting H.R. 4990, 
the Election Technology Research Act. 
This legislation would modernize and 
secure U.S. voting systems by author-
izing NIST and the National Science 
Foundation to conduct research on 
ways to improve and secure voting sys-
tems. Importantly, any standards rec-
ommended by NIST under this act are 
voluntary, and adoption of the stand-
ards remain in the purview of the Elec-
tion Assistance Commission. 
H.R. 4990 also provides grant funding 
to establish a center of excellence in 
election systems to promote the re-
search and modernization of election 
practices. A stated purpose of this cen-
ter will be to foster collaboration be-
tween universities, nonprofits, private 
organizations, and State and local elec-
tion officials. Encouraging communica-
tion and collaboration between these 
groups is vital to make sure the voices 
of States and local election officials 
are heard. 
The Election Research Technology 
Act also amends the Help America 
Vote Act to update the definition of 
voting systems to match modern tech-
nology encompassing electronic poll 
books and voter registration databases. 
There is bipartisan consensus that an 
update of the definition is necessary to 
reflect the modern election technology 
used by States today. 
With new threats facing our electoral 
systems, it is imperative that we con-
tinue to update our election laws and 
improve our election security by pass-
ing bipartisan election security legisla-
tion. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair-
woman 
JOHNSON, 
Ranking 
Member 
LUCAS, and the Science, Space, and 
Technology staff for their hard work 
on this legislation, and also Ohio Sec-
retary of State Frank LaRose’s office 
for their input throughout the process.

H4471 
September 16, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
my friend, Ranking Member DAVIS, for 
his dedicated work on election issues. I 
look forward to continuing working 
with him to ensure the administration 
of our elections are safe and secure. 
The Election Technology Research 
Act will update Federal laws to reflect 
today’s technology, encourage basic re-
search and innovation on the State and 
local level to secure our election sys-
tems, and streamline collaboration be-
tween private and public stakeholders. 
This bill is a simple, bipartisan piece 
of legislation that will take a step for-
ward in improving our election secu-
rity. I urge my colleagues to vote in 
support of H.R. 4990. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER). 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my friend from New Jersey. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4990, which I am proud to 
cosponsor. This is a bipartisan bill in-
troduced by my Science, Space, and 
Technology 
Committee 
colleagues, 
Representatives 
SHERRILL
and 
AN-
THONY GONZALEZ. 
Technology in elections is necessary 
to provide convenience, speed, accu-
racy, and accessibility. However, our 
country needs to modernize this tech-
nology from time to time to ensure se-
curity, privacy, reliability, and trans-
parency. 
For the past 20 years, the Help Amer-
ica Vote Act of 2002 was instrumental 
in the development of voluntary voting 
system guidelines and the advance-
ment of voting technologies to improve 
the security and integrity of our elec-
tions. Unfortunately, the law has not 
kept pace with the rapid advances in 
technology. 
b 1315 
H.R. 4990 authorizes activities and 
makes investments at the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology 
and the National Science Foundation 
to support research to help secure and 
modernize our election systems. This 
legislation also supports critical stand-
ards development work carried out by 
NIST in collaboration with the Elec-
tion Assistance Commission to improve 
the cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, 
and interoperability of voting systems 
technologies. 
Voting is one of our most cherished 
rights as Americans, and without sacri-
ficing security, we must make it as 
easy as possible for all voters to cast 
their ballots this year and every year. 
I thank my colleagues, Representa-
tive MIKIE SHERRILL and Representa-
tive GONZALEZ, for their bipartisan 
leadership on this bill. 
H.R. 4990 will help improve the secu-
rity of our elections, and I urge all my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. DAVIS), a fellow ranking 
member on a full committee and al-
ways an insightful individual. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend from Oklahoma for yielding and 
for the glowing recommendation there. 
I think I could have gotten a better one 
from Mr. PERLMUTTER over there. It is 
great to be here. It is great to be 
among friends and great to see biparti-
sanship. 
This is an example of what the House 
of Representatives should do on a reg-
ular basis, have fun, joke around, like 
Ranking Member LUCAS and I do on 
regular occasions. This is what we 
should do on a wide variety of other 
pieces of legislation, including what we 
want to do before the end of this 
month, how we want to fill the holes in 
the stimulus bill that we passed back 
months and months ago in a very bi-
partisan way. 
I have to raise some concerns about 
this piece of legislation because the 
House Administration Committee got 
this bill sent to the committee last No-
vember and, unfortunately, as has been 
the norm in this Congress and on this 
committee, we didn’t hold one mean-
ingful hearing or markup on this bill. 
The Chair waived our jurisdiction in 
February, and now 7 months later this 
bill is on the House floor without ever 
being discussed by the committee with 
jurisdiction 
over 
Federal 
election 
issues. 
H.R. 4990 allocates over $100 million 
over the next 5 years to the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology 
in order to conduct election system re-
search and distribute grants to higher- 
education institutions and nonprofits. 
Funding expanded research at NIST, 
a nonregulatory agency of the Depart-
ment of Commerce, would allow the 
agency to circumvent policy priorities 
set by the U.S. Election Assistance 
Commission, 
a 
politically 
balanced 
agency. 
This is especially concerning when 
we know there have already been calls 
for more transparency when it comes 
to the work that NIST does on behalf 
of the EAC. Currently, EAC commis-
sioners are not regularly updated on 
the projects that they task NIST with. 
There is no timeline for completion 
and no reporting structure. H.R. 4990 
further empowers NIST without pro-
portional accountability to the EAC. 
I have addressed this issue previously 
in my bill H.R. 5707, the Protect Amer-
ican Voters Act, PAVA, by calling elec-
tion-related work of NIST to be more 
accessible and visible by directing 
them to issue a report to Congress 
every 
year 
containing 
the 
status, 
timeline, and estimated completion of 
activities that they are tasked with 
under HAVA. 
Additionally, H.R. 4990 would expand 
the voting system definition to include 
nonvoting technology in the already 
overwhelmed voluntary voting system 
guidelines process. 
We have been waiting for updated 
HAVA guidelines, or VVSG 2.0, for over 
a decade now. So while I absolutely be-
lieve guidelines for nonvoting equip-
ment, such as e-poll books are needed, 
adding more to the VVSG process like-
ly isn’t going to get this done. 
My bill, PAVA, addresses this by by-
passing the costly and time-consuming 
VVSG process and calls for the EAC to 
establish a separate process for testing 
and certifying guidelines for nonvoting 
election equipment. 
The bottom line, H.R. 4990 does not 
update HAVA, and allocates over $100 
million to the discretion of NIST, rath-
er than investing in the bipartisan 
independent government agency cre-
ated by Congress. And that agency is 
well-versed in elections. The EAC pro-
vides guidance, not mandates. Keeping 
power at the EAC preserves States’ pri-
mary and constitutional role in admin-
istering Federal elections. 
This House should work in a real, bi-
partisan fashion to create the election 
reform that the American people de-
serve. I am willing and ready whenever 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
would like to do this. 
I am happy we see bipartisanship 
today as this bill works its way 
through the process after it passes 
today. I certainly hope that the spon-
sors and my colleagues can work with 
us to address some of the concerns that 
I raise today. 
I thank, again, Ranking Member 
LUCAS. I will give him a glowing rec-
ommendation, too, of nothing. 
And I thank the sponsors of this bill, 
Ms. SHERRILL and Mr. GONZALES, for 
your work in this field. I would like to 
work with you to address some of these 
concerns as we move it to the Senate. 
Thank you for your time today. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN). 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. I thank my col-
leagues 
Congresswoman 
SHERRILL, 
Ranking Member LUCAS, Chairwoman 
JOHNSON, and Congressman GONZALES 
for all of their work on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of H.R. 4990, the Election Tech-
nology Research Act, a strong bipar-
tisan bill that I am proud to support 
and also proud to cosponsor. 
Madam Speaker, in less than 2 
months, Americans will head to the 
polls and exercise their fundamental 
right as Americans to vote and to have 
a voice in their government. Our elec-
tions are foundational to our democ-
racy, and Americans deserve to know 
that their vote is secure. 
The Help America Vote Act, which 
became law nearly two decades ago, in-
cluded a much-needed investment in 
election technologies, security sys-
tems, electronic poll books, and others 
supported by HAVA are in common use 
today. 
But as we all know, technology ad-
vances quickly, and it is critical that 
our election technology advances with 
it. Given the varied and widespread 
election technologies in use across our 
country, it is vitally important that we

examine the risks, find opportunities 
for modernization, and pursue secure 
updates to protect the sanctity and se-
curity of our elections. 
We must make investments in re-
search to improve cybersecurity of our 
voting systems. Cyber warfare is an 
ever-escalating program, and our right 
to vote is foundational and must be 
protected. 
This bipartisan bill will initiate im-
portant research into the security of 
election technology, enabling us to 
take the necessary steps for every 
American to trust that their vote is 
counted. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad to support 
this bill and urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. LUCAS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank Chairwoman JOHNSON, Chair-
woman SHERRILL, and Representative 
ANTHONY
GONZALEZ
for working to-
gether in a bipartisan manner to 
produce measured legislation that will 
help secure and modernize America’s 
voting systems. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, 
this is a practical, bipartisan piece of 
legislation that will work to secure our 
elections. 
The administration committee dis-
charged this bill in February, and I 
hope I can count on robust support 
from my colleagues there. 
When the House passed the Help 
America Vote Act nearly 20 years ago, 
we recognized that our election sys-
tems need protection. That is why that 
landmark legislation included the pro-
visions I already mentioned to advance 
research, technology, and standards de-
velopment for voting systems. 
We are in a new technological land-
scape today, and our voting systems 
need to be updated accordingly, and 
this is the first step in that direction. 
NIST already has a team of experts 
working with the Election Assistance 
Commission on standards for voting 
technology, and they are absolutely 
qualified to pursue this research. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues today. Thank you to Rep-
resentative GONZALEZ for his work on 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
voice my strong support for H.R. 4990, the 
Election Technology Research Act, of which I 
am a proud cosponsor. 
My return to Congress in 2019 was prompt-
ed in part by my membership in Issue One’s 
ReFormers Caucus, a nonpartisan group of 
more than 200 former Members of Congress, 
governors, ambassadors and cabinet mem-
bers. This committed Caucus, whose slogan is 
‘‘fix democracy first’’, is focused on a range of 
reforms essential to returning government to 
the people. 
Central to these reforms are much higher 
and broader participation in our elections and 
enhanced faith in the validity of our election 
results. Election security is in turn the critical 
foundation of participation and faith. It should 
be and largely is a universal goal, especially 
given continuing, emerging and expanding 
threats to our election systems. 
This bipartisan measure would help ensure 
that our elections are secured by the most ad-
vanced and best voting technology. It author-
izes federal research to establish and maintain 
the highest standards possible, and estab-
lishes a Center of Excellence in Election Sys-
tems to regularly and thoroughly test the secu-
rity and accessibility of voting systems and 
certify voting system technology. 
This measure passed our House Committee 
on Science, Space, and Technology with 
unanimous support because the Committee 
recognized the critical need for federal re-
sources and leadership on this issue. It also 
was endorsed by my Blue Dog Coalition be-
cause it advances our own commitment to na-
tional security and accessible democracy. 
I thank Congresswoman SHERRILL for her 
leadership on this important issue, and urge 
full House passage. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 4990. 
Voting is the bedrock of our representative 
democracy. The integrity of our election infra-
structure is essential to free and fair elections. 
Votes are cast and counted using a variety of 
systems, from hand-marked paper ballots to 
direct-recording electronic machines. There is 
a whole host of other technology that also 
supports the process, including electronic 
pollbooks, voter registration databases, and 
other components of comprehensive systems. 
I support H.R. 4990, the Election Tech-
nology Research Act of 2019, because it in-
vests in science to bolster the resilience of 
election technology, and commend its spon-
sor, Representative SHERRILL, for authoring 
the bill. This legislation is in keeping with other 
bills this House has passed in the 116th Con-
gress to protect our democratic institutions, in-
cluding H.R. 1 (the For the People Act), H.R. 
2722 (the SAFE Act), and H.R. 4617 (the 
SHIELD Act). 
Russia attacked our democracy in 2016. 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation 
confirmed that Russian GRU officers ‘‘targeted 
individuals and entities involved in the admin-
istration of the elections. Victims included U.S. 
state and local entities, such as state boards 
of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and 
county governments, as well as individuals 
who worked for those entities. The GRU also 
targeted private technology firms responsible 
for manufacturing and administering election- 
related software and hardware, such as voter 
registration software and electronic polling sta-
tions.’’ 
In July 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency (CISA) published an 
election infrastructure risk assessment. It 
found that ‘‘compromises to the integrity of 
state-level voter registration systems, the 
preparation of election data (e.g., ballot pro-
gramming), vote aggregation systems, and 
election websites present particular risk to the 
ability of jurisdictions to conduct elections.’’ 
Our elections remain under threat from for-
eign adversaries. In August 2020, the Director 
of the United States Counterintelligence and 
Security Center said that foreign states may 
use the 2020 elections to ‘‘seek to com-
promise our election infrastructure for a range 
of possible purposes, such as interfering with 
the voting process, stealing sensitive data, or 
calling into question the validity of the election 
results.’’ 
H.R. 4990 is commonsense, bipartisan leg-
islation that responds to these ongoing 
threats. It authorizes new research and stand-
ards for election infrastructure security. It di-
rects the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) and the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) to carry out research that 
will increase the understanding of cyber and 
other threats to voting systems. It will lead to 
the development of technology, processes, 
and policies for more secure and accessible 
elections. This includes the cybersecurity of 
different components of voting systems, end- 
to-end verifiable systems, voter privacy and 
data protection, election auditing, interoper-
ability of system technologies, and ballot track-
ing. 
Importantly, the bill also amends the Help 
America Vote Act to expand the definition of 
voting systems to include electronic pollbooks, 
voter registration databases, systems for car-
rying out post-election auditing, and related 
technology. This will lead to improved guid-
ance to election administrators for these sys-
tems by the Election Assistance Commission 
and its partners, which include NIST. 
I am pleased to support H.R. 4990 and urge 
its passage.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, on Sep-

cast my vote for two bills on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. I would like the 
record to reflect that I would have voted in 
favor of H.R. 7909, the Ensuring Children and 
Child Care Workers Are Safe Act, legislation 
that I have cosponsored. Additionally, I would 
have voted against the motion to recommit 
and in favor of final passage for H.R. 2574, 
the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 16, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on 
September 16, 2020, at 2:19 p.m.: 
That the Senate agreed to without amend-
ment H. Con. Res. 92. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk.

SAVE OUR HOMES—SAVE OUR 
PLANET 
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, over 
this August break, my family and I left 
our house, not because it was vacation 
season but because it was wildfire sea-
son, and we were some of the thousands 
of people that were evacuated from our 
homes. Now, thanks to the amazing 
work of firefighters and first respond-
ers, we had a house to come home to, 
but as we know, many others were not 
as lucky. 
You see, the American West, includ-
ing my district on the Central Coast of 
California, is experiencing destructive 
wildfires where we are not just victims 
of these conflagrations, but we are also 
witnesses to the climate crisis. 
Our climate is hotter. Our country-
sides are drier, and our communities 
are more vulnerable to this type of dev-
astation. We can’t ignore it. We can’t 
deny it, but we can pass the Climate 
Action Rebate plan to reduce our car-
bon output. We can pass the bipartisan 
Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety 
Act, and we can pass the bipartisan 
REPLANT Act. 
This is not a binary choice. We can 
do both. If we don’t act, our fire sea-
sons will turn into fire years. But if we 
do act with commonsense legislation in 
Congress, we will save not just our 
homes, we will save this planet. 
f 
MAINLAND REGIONAL HS 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize the special edu-
cation staff at Mainland Regional High 
School in Linwood in South Jersey. 
After being given approval by the 
State and the health department, stu-
dents went back to school this summer 
after being gone since March 13 because 
of coronavirus. The students received 
instruction in English, math, social- 
emotional skills, and physical edu-
cation and health. 
The education and instruction that 
these students received was much- 
needed and was greatly appreciated by 
the students and the educators alike. 
Students were able to receive face-to- 
face instruction, which for some stu-
dents is the key to their success. 
Thank you to the educators, assist-
ants, and administrators for being so 
engaged and involved in the success of 
our students. It is appreciated. It is 
very much appreciated. You are appre-
ciated. You are very much appreciated. 
Thank you for all that you do and 
what you continue to do for our com-
munity. May God bless you and God 
bless all those students.

HONORING ARMY COMBAT 
VETERAN KARI PADILLA 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor Army combat veteran and medic 
Sergeant Kari Padilla. 
Sergeant Padilla honorably served 
our Nation from 2005 to 2013 with tours

in Iraq and Germany and helped estab-
lish a vital aviation field hospital sup-
porting Middle East and Afghanistan 
deployments. 
Though no longer in uniform, she 
continues to serve, having been the 
community outreach coordinator for 
the Post 9/11 Veterans Corps the past 4 
years. In this capacity, she increased 
Veterans Corps participation by 35 per-
cent annually and their social media 
following by 4,000 percent. It is this 
level of dedication and excellence that 
exemplifies her concern for other serv-
icemembers. 
More 
recently, 
Ms. 
Padilla 
was 
named president of the 9/11 Veterans 
Corps, a well-deserved recognition. I 
know she will do an amazing job in this 
capacity and build upon her past suc-
cesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot thank her 
enough for her service, passion, and 
dedication. She continues to make the 
15th District in our country a better 
place to live, work, and play. 
Kari, you represent the best our Na-
tion has to offer and, today, I salute 
you for your many sacrifices. 
f 
EMERGENCY WILDFIRES AND 
PUBLIC SAFETY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, 4 of the 
10 largest wildfires in California his-
tory are currently burning as we 
speak—3 of which are in my district. 
For decades, our national forests 
have been mismanaged, turning them 
into tinderboxes that can ignite in an 
instant should lightning strike. As a 
result, there are more dead trees in the 
State of California than there are peo-
ple. 
This is a serious problem with seri-
ous consequences. If there is a time for 
this body to pass a comprehensive for-
estry package, it is now. 
Today, the Senate Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee will con-
sider the Emergency Wildfire and Pub-
lic Safety Act. This bipartisan bill, led 
by my colleague, JIMMY PANETTA, and I 
in the House, and Senator FEINSTEIN 
and DAINES in the Senate, take great 
steps to proactively manage our forests 
and minimize wildfire risk in the West. 
Mr. Speaker, over three million acres 
in California have burned this year as a 
result of disastrous wildfires. We have 
150 million dead trees in California. It 
is critical that the House considers the 
Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety 
Act immediately. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ISLAM AS ONE OF 
THE GREAT RELIGIONS OF THE 
WORLD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCADAMS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as 
the grandson of a Methodist preacher, 
and I would also add, whose wife—my 
grandmother—was a missionary, I am 
proud to rise today to present H. Res. 
1090, recognizing Islam as one of the 
great religions of the world. 
I am proud to acknowledge that this 
resolution was introduced on August 
21, 2020, with three original cosponsors: 
The honorable RASHIDA TLAIB, the hon-
orable ILHAN OMAR, and my friend who 
is with me today, the honorable ANDRE´ 
CARSON. 
I will say much more about the reso-
lution, but I do want to at this time ac-
knowledge my friend who’s present 
from the Seventh Congressional Dis-
trict of Indiana. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
CARSON), 
a 
wordsmith par excellence. 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Dr. GREEN, Congressman 
GREEN, Chairman GREEN, Judge GREEN, 
Pastor 
GREEN, 
public 
servant 
AL 
GREEN. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my colleagues’ resolution recog-
nizing Islam as one of the great reli-
gions of the world. 
I commend my friend, Representative 
GREEN, for honoring Islam. This action 
helps to honor the millions of Muslims 
of many different backgrounds who 
proudly call America home. 
Mr. Speaker, as one of three Muslims 
currently serving in Congress, it is my 
great privilege to speak here today in 
the people’s House about a special 
faith. Though we are a minority in this 
country, we have participated fully in 
the story of our Nation since its ear-
liest 
days. 
Even 
before 
America’s 
founding and our Declaration of Inde-
pendence, this brilliant declaration en-
shrined freedom of faith and religion 
for all of us. 
Today, there are Muslims in all parts 
of the country who are business own-
ers, who are teachers, construction 
workers, engineers, lawyers, judges, 
elected officials. 
The first Muslim in Congress, my 
friend, comes to mind—Keith Ellison. 
We now have sisters ILHAN OMAR and 
RASHIDA TLAIB, and the list goes on, 
statewide and locally. 
b 1615 
Throughout this COVID–19 pandemic, 
Mr. Speaker, you would be hard- 
pressed to find a hospital in this great 
Nation without a Muslim healthcare 
worker on the front lines serving fellow 
Americans, not just in urban centers, 
but in suburbia, in rural parts of our 
country. 
As more and more Muslims call 
America home, Mr. Speaker, we will 
continue working tirelessly, guided by 
our faith, to ensure our great country 
lives up to the principles of equality, 
compassion, and opportunity for all. 
Our faith keeps us motivated every day 
to advance these great goals. 
Around the world, billions of Mus-
lims are also engaged in this struggle, 
also using their faith as a guide. We 
have seen what has happened with 
Uighur Muslims. We are seeing the dis-
pute in Kashmir. We are seeing conflict 
dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian 
question. And, sadly, we still see Mus-
lims who endure hurtful stereotypes 
and discrimination on this journey. 
But our faith teaches us to be bold, 
to be brave, and to always choose love 
over hate. We will not be deterred, Mr. 
Speaker. 
I am a proud Muslim. I am a proud 
American. I am honored to be a mem-
ber of a very diverse and growing glob-
al community, and I am thankful to 
live in a country that enshrines the 
right to practice this faith. 
We wouldn’t have the foundation for 
American Muslims in this country, Mr. 
Speaker, were it not for the contribu-
tion 
of 
African-American 
Muslims. 
Scholars say 30, 40, maybe even 50 per-
cent of the slaves who were brought 
here from West Africa were Muslim. 
We see Muslims as first responders. I 
was one of them. We see Muslims who 
were a part of responding to the call to 
fight against terrorism in the post-9/11 
reality, oftentimes thwarting potential 
attacks that you will never hear about 
in the news. Muslims are on the front 
lines in our law enforcement commu-
nity and in our intelligence services. 
Muslims have been critical in this 
country with establishing Islam and 
promoting self-respect, self-determina-
tion, creating your own enterprises and 
businesses. We hear terms now like 
‘‘stay woke.’’ I submit to you, Mr. 
Speaker, that that terminology came 
from the contributions and the founda-
tions laid by African-American Mus-
lims. 
It began as a kernel in the inception 
of this country, and it started to blos-
som in the early 1920s and 1930s, during 
the Great Depression. During those 
times, you had variations of Islam that 
was not Arabized. Because if it was an 
Arab presenting Islam, it wouldn’t 
have 
been 
attractive. 
It 
certainly 
wouldn’t have been attractive to me. 
But the Islam that was presented was 
created in a way to fight against the 
poison and toxicity of white suprem-
acy. Now, you have a beautiful religion 
with an interfaith coalition with Chris-
tian brothers and sisters, Jewish broth-
ers and sisters, Sikhs, Hindus, atheists, 
Buddhists, all coming together to 
make America a better place. 
Now, some people are comfortable 
with talking about Islam, and in their 
critiques of Islam, they overlook the 
hypocrisy of their own faith. You can-
not really call yourself a lover of God 
and show hate for others of a different 
faith. You cannot call yourself an 
elected official and a representative of 
the people if you are only committed 
to serving and representing one seg-
ment of the population. You certainly 
can’t call yourself a true public servant 
without recognizing the contributions 
that have been made by this wonderful 
community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4477 
September 16, 2020 
I salute Representative GREEN for his 
bold leadership, for his visionary lead-
ership, as a proud Christian man in the 
tradition of Jesus Christ, knowing that 
in my Father’s house, there are many 
mansions. 
To stand up and recognize the won-
derful religion of Islam, I commend 
him, I thank him, because we are 
America. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his very kind 
words. He is more than generous. I also 
thank him for his service in Congress. 
He and I started out together on the 
Financial Services Committee. He has 
since moved on to the Intelligence 
Committee and is doing an outstanding 
job serving his country as an American 
Muslim. 
Mr. Speaker, I indicated that I am 
the grandson of a Methodist preacher, 
but I am also a very proud Baptist. My 
grandfather would not hold it against 
me. 
Religion is something that each per-
son has to make decisions about for 
himself or herself. It is not something 
that we impose on people. This is a free 
country, a country wherein you have 
the right to be whatever you choose to 
be, within the spirit of what the law al-
lows. 
This is the case with religion. You 
can be whatever you choose to be, be 
associated with whichever religion you 
choose to, within the spirit of what the 
law allows. 
I want to just say a few words about 
why I have brought this resolution. I 
have lived in this country all of my 
life. I love my country. It means some-
thing to me. I respect the words ‘‘lib-
erty and justice for all’’ in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. I respect the concept in 
the Gettysburg Address: ‘‘government 
of the people, by the people, for the 
people.’’ 
It means something to me to know 
that a person who came from what I 
consider humble beginnings has had 
the opportunity to stand in the well of 
the House of Representatives. So, I 
love my country. 
But it doesn’t mean that I overlook 
some of the things that have happened 
to me along life’s way that were not so 
pleasant. 
I had persons who called themselves 
Christians to burn a cross in my yard. 
I don’t consider them Christians. They 
called themselves Christians. 
I have had persons who called them-
selves Christians to say some very ugly 
things to me and do some very ugly 
things to me. 
But let me tell you what it did not do 
to me. Those persons who wore the 
hoods, who came to my yard, burned 
the cross, it did not cause me to con-
clude 
that 
Christianity 
was 
rep-
resented in what they did. The people 
who said ugly things and did ugly 
things to me in the name of Christi-
anity, they did not cause me to con-
clude that that is what Christianity is 
all about. 
I am mentioning this because, quite 
candidly, I want other people to under-
stand that Islam is a peaceful religion, 
that there are people who abuse others 
in the name of religion, but that 
doesn’t mean that the religion is about 
the abuse that is being perpetrated. 
I am honored today to present this 
resolution, and I rise in solidarity with 
my Muslim brothers and sisters around 
the world. I do so because I have seen 
them in action. 
In Houston, Texas, we have storms. 
When these storms have come through 
our city—Hurricane Harvey being one 
example—the Muslim community was 
right there to do all that was necessary 
to help others. 
One of the greatest callings that you 
have in any religion is to help some-
body. They have adhered to the call for 
justice. They have been there to march 
in protest for freedom and justice for 
other people. 
This community has been there with 
aid and comfort for people who have 
been left homeless. They have been 
there with aid and comfort for people 
who have suffered harm by way of their 
physical well-being. 
Muslim doctors have helped people, 
and I have seen the evidence of it. 
There is a clinic in Houston, the Ibn 
Sina Clinic, and they have been assist-
ing people with the COVID virus. Free 
tests are being administered. 
This community has been helpful in 
my city. Persons from the community 
have served in public office, on city 
council. We have persons who are serv-
ing as precinct judges. 
The community is there and a part of 
the greater Houston community. Hous-
ton is a very diverse city. The Muslim 
community enhances the diversity of 
the city of Houston. 
This religion is a complete system of 
strong moral convictions that pro-
motes peace, equality, and social jus-
tice. Islam is the second largest and 
fastest growing religion in the world. 
America is home to one of the most 
diverse Muslim populations. It has 
within it almost every ethnicity, coun-
try, and school of thought. There are 
approximately 3.45 million Muslims of 
all ages living in the United States of 
America. This is as of 2016; this is the 
last information available to me. 
In an overwhelming measure, Mus-
lims make a significant, positive, and 
growing contribution to our Nation. 
We have successful Muslims in all 
areas of our national life. Names that 
come to mind, for a good many Ameri-
cans, would include Kareem Abdul- 
Jabbar, would include one who was 
known as Cassius Clay but became Mu-
hammad Ali. There are Muslims in all 
areas of life, including business, sport, 
media, culture, medicine, law, and poli-
tics. 
Although American Muslims make 
up approximately 1 percent of the U.S. 
population, most Americans can name 
some of these prominent Muslims that 
I have called to your attention. 
Another is Malcolm X. Many persons 
don’t revere Malcolm X, but I am proud 
to say that the United States of Amer-
ica has had Malcolm X on a postage 
stamp. Of course, his name moved from 
X to Shabazz. 
The Nation has honored many Amer-
ican Muslims for their service and sac-
rifice, including Salman Hamdani. Mr. 
Hamdani was there for 9/11. He made 
sacrifices on 9/11 as a first responder. 
Many American Muslims are also 
civically engaged, working with their 
neighbors to better their communities. 
They are members of the Rotary Club, 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Yes, 
Muslims served in the military of the 
United States of America. 
They are members of school boards, 
and they volunteer in our commu-
nities. They actively engage in chari-
table giving. And I say this with some 
understanding of it, as I have seen it in 
action. I have seen the Muslim commu-
nity not only give their in-kind serv-
ices but their American dollars to wor-
thy causes. 
In short, American Muslims and the 
organizations they create are a part of 
the fiber and fabric of the great coun-
try that I love. 
Today, during this pandemic, many 
Muslims work on the front lines, as 
was said by my dear brother, ANDRE´ 
CARSON, Congressman CARSON. They 
work on the front lines. They work as 
essential workers. They put their lives 
on the line to help others through the 
pain of the pandemic. 
I believe that we must acknowledge 
and appreciate that Muslims further 
the diversity and success of our great 
country. 
b 1630 
To this end, I trust that persons will 
join me in demonstrating solidarity 
with and support for Muslim members 
of the community throughout the 
world by recognizing Islam as one of 
the great religions of the world. 
I hold in my hand the actual resolu-
tion that has been filed. I will not go 
through the whereases, but I do want 
to go to the be it resolved: ‘‘ . . . be it 
resolved . . . to demonstrate solidarity 
and support for members of the com-
munity of Islam in the United States 
and throughout the world, the House of 
Representatives recognizes the Islamic 
faith as one of the great religions of 
the world.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the 
time, but I also want to thank the 
House leadership for the time. I do so 
because there was a time in the history 
of this country when a person who was 
born into poverty, who had to suffer 
the slings and arrows of invidious dis-
crimination, would not be allowed to 
stand in the House of Representatives 
and present a resolution honoring 
Islam. We have come a long way. 
I would like to acknowledge the fact 
that we have come a long way, because 
too many proclaim the notion that 
nothing has changed. The mere fact 
that I am standing here bringing this 
resolution means that things have 
changed. Many may not agree, but 
things have changed to the extent that

I have got the freedom to speak my 
mind with this resolution on the floor 
of the House of Representatives. 
So I thank all of the leadership for 
acknowledging the change and allow-
ing the resolution to be presented. 
With this said, I kindly and respect-
fully yield back the balance of my 
time.

RECOGNIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
materials on the topic of my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. 
WAGNER). 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for very graciously al-
lowing me to speak and for yielding to 
me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory 
of 
Police 
Officer 
Tamarris 
L. 
Bohannon, who gave his life and serv-
ice to his city on August 30 of 2020. His 
untimely and tragic killing is a pro-
found loss to the people of St. Louis. 
Mr. Speaker, according to the St. 
Louis Metropolitan Police Department, 
there have been nine—nine—St. Louis 
police officers shot since June 1 of 2020. 
We grieve Officer Bohannon’s sacrifice, 
and we honor him for his sense of duty, 
his dedication, his generosity, and his 
heroism. 
Known as ‘‘T’’ by his family and 
‘‘Bo’’ by his squad, Officer Bohannon 
was a loyal St. Louisan and a hard 
worker who inspired admiration for his 
diligent service. With his wife, Alexis, 
he lived and raised his three wonderful 
children—Tamara, Ayden, and Tylor— 
in the city that he protected as a police 
officer of the St. Louis Metropolitan 
Police Department. He was a veteran of 
the force, serving with distinction for 
more than 3 years. 
Officer Bohannon’s heroic actions to 
keep the citizens of St. Louis safe are 
the truest example of selfless service. I 
extend my deepest condolences to his 
fellow officers, his many friends, his 
loving wife and parents, and the rest of 
his family. We cannot repay him for his 
sacrifice, but we will always remember 
his love for our city and the people who 
live there. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I will begin 
by recognizing the heroic men and 
women who serve in the L.A. County 
Sheriff’s Department as well. 
This week, our country witnessed a 
cowardly evil attack on two L.A. Coun-
ty deputies. As the two county deputies 
were sitting inside of their parked car 
in Compton, California, a thug ap-
proached their vehicle and shot them 
point-blank. We are grateful that both 
of them are expected to survive. We re-
gret that ambush, totally without jus-
tification, and we need to bring them 
to justice. 
I am reminded of what the British 
moralist C. S. Lewis described in his 
book, ‘‘The Abolition of Man,’’ where 
he said of shallow and heartless people 
as being ‘‘men without chests.’’ 
Perhaps, now, we are seeing that 
from the vicious criminals who are at-
tempting to single out and overthrow 
our cities and, specifically, attack our 
police force. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Arizona. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support our 
First Amendment. I want to support 
the ability of people to assemble peace-
ably, but I also want to address the 
mobs that we have seen in our streets 
and, fundamentally, to defend our po-
lice. 
What is it that the mob wants? It is 
hard to answer. There is a disparate set 
of views. Some have called them anar-
chists. They don’t really have anarchy 
in mind; they just don’t agree on which 
leftwing ideology they want to support. 
But they also are obeying their leaders. 
They are doing what their leaders have 
sent them to do. 
One of our House colleagues, in June 
of 2018, said: ‘‘You get out and you cre-
ate a crowd. And you push back on 
them, and you tell them they are not 
welcome anymore, anywhere.’’ 
Isn’t that exactly what the mob is 
doing? Little old ladies trying to have 
a meal on a sidewalk here in our Na-
tion’s Capital have people shouting at 
them—mob intimidation. 
And it gets much worse, as my col-
league, Mrs. WAGNER, just highlighted. 
Nine police officers shot just in St. 
Louis alone. We all saw the horrific at-
tacks in Los Angeles over the week-
end—unprovoked, unjustified, unjusti-
fiable, indefensible, yet people defend 
them and are reluctant to condemn 
them. This is what the mob is doing. 
This is not the First Amendment. 
This is not the right of the people to 
assemble peaceably. And our law en-
forcement protect that right. They de-
fend freedom. They protect and defend 
our communities. They do it heroically 
with bravery every day and, so often, 
thanklessly. 
We are right to give them thanks. 
They put their lives in harm’s way. 
And they call out their colleagues 
when they can when they break the 
trust of their departments. 
We do need to reform some laws. We 
do need to hold some individuals ac-
countable, but the idea that we can lay 
at the feet of all police these charges 
that are made is abhorrent. 
So we need to defend our police. We 
need to defend our First Amendment 
freedoms to assemble peaceably, and 
we need to reject the cries of the mobs. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Arizona. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, a husband 
and wife awoke to see, through their 
bedroom window, a brazen burglar 
breaking into their car. The dad re-
trieved a gun and tried to protect his 
family. He knew that the console of the 
car being burglarized contained an-
other gun, and he saw the burglar re-
trieve it. They exchanged fire, and the 
confrontation had become more than 
even that prepared father could handle. 
So it became the responsibility of Ryan 
Hendrix. 
The 8-year veteran of the Henderson 
County Sheriff’s Department arrived 
with two other deputies at 2:54 a.m. 
last Thursday. They spotted the sus-
pect, and at first he appeared to com-
ply with commands, and then suddenly 
raised a weapon and fired. 
The first shot struck Deputy Hendrix 
in the face before his fellow officers re-
turned fire and shot the gunman dead. 
Investigation revealed that the gun-
man was a career criminal, wanted by 
South Carolina Probation, with arrests 
in four States. 
Ryan Philip Hendrix, 35, Marine 
Corps vet, was declared brain dead the 
next day. Ryan’s 6-year-old son and 9- 
year-old daughter will live with only 
fragmentary memories of their father. 
Ryan’s fiancee will not have that Octo-
ber wedding that they planned. 
This murder is not an isolated story. 
Two hundred law enforcement officers 
have died in the line of duty in 2020, up 
90 percent. 
Nothing I say can ennoble the sac-
rifices of those lost nor of the many 
others injured. Those sacrifices, that 
service, speak for themselves. 
But I can speak to a fast-growing 
cancer in our civic spirit, an activism 
that exploits the wound to our national 
psyche born of racial injustice in our 
history, an activism that draws explic-
itly on Marxism and attacks core foun-
dations of our society, including, and 
perhaps foremost, the consensus of sup-
port for law enforcement, a consensus 
that abides in every nation capable of 
surviving. It manifests itself in riots, 
looting, arson, destruction, shootings, 
and killings. 
I can contend against it along with 
you. I have introduced into Congress 
the No Riots Act to criminalize inju-
ries not only for Federal but, also, 
State and local law enforcement offi-
cers and to extend the death penalty 
for killing an officer in the course of 
interstate rioting. 
But we cannot return to law enforce-
ment officers the protection they de-
serve if leadership of our country is di-
vided on the institution of police—in-
deed, if the people are divided. All

must back the blue. If we do not, then 
God have mercy on us, because the 
criminals and thugs like the one who 
took Ryan Hendrix’s life assuredly will 
not spare yours or those of your loved 
ones. 
This country is exceptional, the rec-
ognition that every human is special 
and has fundamental rights. Our Na-
tion is a story of refining those rights 
in practice so that everyone gets a fair 
shake, that everyone’s life is protected 
and respected. 
But elemental to that, what we can-
not do without are those who defend us 
from chaos and keep order, those whose 
service, whose sacrifice most Ameri-
cans understand and honor. 
Most Americans know that Ryan 
Hendrix is a hero and so are all who 
serve in blue. Most Americans know 
that the they are highest caliber 
among us and that they deserve our re-
spect and support. 
I back the blue. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, in the sweltering heat 
of Arizona deserts, we have multiple 
jurisdictions of police officers who 
come to the rescue, not just armed 
with guns, but they will save those who 
are fighting through the desert, fight-
ing through the heat, whether they are 
here in this country illegally or not. 
Whether they are with the Customs 
and Border Patrol, whether they are 
with ICE, whether they are with the 
county sheriff’s department or our 
local municipal police departments, 
they provide first aid assistance and 
lifesaving assistance, and I pay homage 
to them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
b 1645 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
There is no more important element 
of our society that the Founders guar-
anteed us than safety and security. I 
rise today in strong support of our Na-
tion’s law enforcement officers and 
join my colleagues in strongly con-
demning the recent attacks on those 
who serve and protect our commu-
nities. 
Peaceful protests have been hijacked 
by malevolent radical organizations 
like Antifa, while national political 
and media-driven narratives have fur-
ther incited violence against the very 
people who patrol our streets, stop vio-
lent criminals, and keep our commu-
nities safe. That is what the blue does. 
It is imperative law enforcement 
have the means necessary to inves-
tigate who and which organizations are 
funding, organizing, and inciting these 
riots occurring in our country. 
As Members of Congress, it is our 
sworn duty to defend our Nation from 
enemies both foreign and domestic. 
While we must always protect the right 
to peacefully protest, it is imperative 
that 
people 
or 
entities 
funneling 
money to cause disruption and damage 
in peaceful communities are held ac-
countable for their actions. 
Michigan’s First District proudly 
stands with our law enforcement com-
munity, and we honor the good work 
that so many brave men and women do 
every day, keeping strong that thin 
blue line which defends against chaos 
and anarchy threatening our society. 
I fervently urge the Department of 
Justice and the FBI to take all avail-
able further action to ensure that the 
rioters, and especially those funneling 
money to them, are held accountable 
to the maximum extent allowable by 
the law. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. He is a great 
chairman, but also a great friend. I 
thank him, also, for organizing this 
Special Order. 
Over the past several months we have 
witnessed lawless anarchists take to 
the streets and destroy historic monu-
ments, vandalize and burn small busi-
nesses, physically assault a U.S. Sen-
ator and his wife, harass regular Amer-
icans who are simply enjoying an out-
door dinner, and so on. The fact that 
this activity goes on and is tolerated 
by Democrat-run cities is outrageous 
and an insult to every law-abiding cit-
izen of this land. 
We need to double the Federal pen-
alties for those who riot and loot. We 
need to strip Federal funding from cit-
ies that refuse to confront this lawless-
ness in their communities. And we 
need to put those dithering local offi-
cials on the hook legally for the car-
nage that they allow to happen. 
There are people here in Washington 
who stand for law and order and are 
trying to regain control of our streets, 
starting with our President. Violence 
like this has no place in America. We 
have to get back to resolving our issues 
through debate and democracy, not 
through looting and lawlessness. 
If officials in Democrat-run cities 
won’t stand up for all of their citizens, 
then under the leadership of President 
Trump, Republicans will. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
YOHO). 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, a country as ours, a 
constitutional republic, requires a citi-
zenry that is well-educated and are re-
sponsible. 
I questioned a colleague of mine from 
New York about her policies calling for 
defunding of the police. The city of 
New York cut funding to the city po-
lice department by $1.5 billion, but my 
colleague from New York said that is 
not sufficient, we need 100 percent 
defunding of the police, while at the 
same time advocating for people to 
shoplift if you are hungry. 
My question is: Do you suppose that 
is okay for the shop owner? Do you 
suppose it is okay for our children 
watching those police? Who does the 
shop owner call and how do the police 
respond with those kinds of ideas out 
there? Do you call Antifa? I don’t 
know. I wouldn’t. 
A civil society needs rule of law. We 
need policemen who uphold those laws 
and are willing to serve to protect the 
citizens. Our lawmakers need to pre-
serve the rule of law, not weaken it. 
The dangerous policies of the left 
espouse no police, free this, free that, 
free healthcare, it is not your fault. 
This does not lead to the utopia they 
promise. 
In reality, this leads to the Hugo 
Chavez/Nicholas Maduro’s Venezuela, 
and that is a short period of time. Peo-
ple don’t think it can happen here, but 
we need our policemen. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman’s comments and his ef-
forts and service in Congress as he pre-
pares to retire soon. I thank the gen-
tleman, Mr. YOHO. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY), who on 
the other end of the spectrum is fairly 
new to Congress. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arizona for yield-
ing some time to me here this after-
noon. 
First, we are setting up a picture 
here on the easel to the right of me. 
And what you see there are not the 
wildfires in California. What you see is 
a picture from my district in western 
Wisconsin of Minneapolis at the end of 
May as the city was burning. 
Organized 
anarchist 
groups 
like 
Antifa have been engaging in system-
atic criminal activity including as-
saults, widespread property damage 
and destruction, repeated looting, and 
attacks on law enforcement and others. 
They have turned parts of Kenosha, 
Madison, and Milwaukee in my State, 
as well as neighborhoods just over the 
border in Minnesota, into post-apoca-
lyptic hellscapes. 
And if I can take just a minute. 
Growing up in western Wisconsin, I 
will never forget, it was always a treat 
to go into the Twin Cities of Saint 
Paul and Minneapolis. And in the Mid-
west, Minneapolis and Saint Paul were 
always known as the best of the big 
cities to live in. They can no longer say 
that after what has happened here in 
2020. 
These are not mostly peaceful pro-
tests, and Antifa is not a myth. These 
are orchestrated assaults on civil soci-
ety and the American way of life de-
signed to spread terror and chaos, to 
destroy businesses, and to shake the 
very foundations of our country. 
First, it was Minneapolis and At-
lanta, then Portland and Seattle, then 
Milwaukee, Madison and even Kenosha. 
Tomorrow it could be your community. 
So let’s talk about those cities here 
in Wisconsin. 
Madison: In June, a violent mob van-
dalized the State capitol and other 
State buildings, shattering windows, 
hurling Molotov cocktails and destroy-
ing historic monuments. In fact, it was

September 16, 2020 
very fortunate that the Molotov cock-
tail that went into the county building 
just off from the State capitol did not 
lead to a loss of life. 
They attacked a statue of Hans 
Christian Heg, a statue that I was just 
walking past a few months ago as a 
State legislator in Wisconsin. He was a 
Civil War veteran, immigrant, aboli-
tionist who fell at Chickamauga fight-
ing to end slavery and preserve the 
Union. Yes, they tore it down. His 
nearly 100-year-old sculpture was de-
capitated and thrown into a lake by ri-
oters. 
The mob also tore down the statue of 
Lady Forward, a monument that is em-
blematic of Wisconsin being the first 
State to ratify the women’s suffrage 
movement. The original Lady Forward 
statue was first placed in front of the 
Wisconsin State Capitol in 1895. 
And for my friends on the other side 
of the aisle, whether you are a Repub-
lican or Democrat, if you don’t think 
they are going to come for you at some 
point, go ask my former colleague 
Democrat State Senator Tim Car-
penter, who was beaten by rioters dur-
ing that unrest and needed surgery to 
recover. He told the media, ‘‘I don’t 
know what happened . . . all I did was 
stop and take a picture . . . and the 
next thing I’m getting five-six punches, 
getting kicked in the head.’’ That is a 
Democratic State senator. 
Roving bands of thugs looking to in-
timidate residents torched and looted 
State Street. The State Street riots 
proceeded when they tore down the 
statues around the beautiful State cap-
itol in Madison, Wisconsin. 
But let’s talk about Bernell Tram-
mell. In July, Mr. Trammell, an activ-
ist known for carrying handmade signs 
supporting 
President 
Trump, 
was 
gunned down in broad daylight in Mil-
waukee. To date, no arrests have been 
made. 
Mr. Trammell is an African Amer-
ican. And, in fact, I am quite sure he 
supported an African American former 
state senator that I used to work with. 
There is growing public concern that 
the violence and lawlessness that has 
plagued Milwaukee for months has ren-
dered local officials either unwilling or 
unable to thoroughly investigate his 
murder and bring those responsible for 
his death to justice. And that includes 
the top law enforcement official in 
Wisconsin. We are hearing nothing 
from him in regard to Bernell Tram-
mell. 
The failure of local officials to appre-
hend any suspects a month after this 
brutal crime was committed sets a dan-
gerous precedent, one that could en-
courage more politically motivated 
killings and undermine the civil rights 
protections afforded to all Americans. 
I have asked Attorney General Barr 
and the U.S. Attorney to initiate a 
civil rights investigation into his kill-
ing as they did into the shooting of 
Jacob Blake. 
Kenosha: During the Kenosha riots, 
at least 56 businesses were severely 
damaged or destroyed racking up a $50 
million price tag. Thank you, Presi-
dent Trump, for coming to Kenosha 
and offering your assistance. 
The destruction has left business 
owners 
devastated 
and 
wondering 
whether they will have the money to 
rebuild and stay in the neighborhood. 
The Uptown neighborhood, home to a 
majority of minority-owned businesses, 
was among those hardest hit. One news 
report described the plight of one local 
business owner: 
Inside La Estrella Supermarket, owner 
Abel Alejo surveyed the water and smoke 
damage his shop suffered. Carpeting in a 
hallway was spongy with water as he sur-
veyed packages of spoiling food that needed 
clearing out last week. A few pinatas still 
hung overhead from an intact part of the 
otherwise broken ceiling in the closed store. 
Wauwatosa: According to police, a 
mob targeted the home of a Wauwatosa 
policeman, vandalizing his home, phys-
ically assaulting him, then firing a 
shotgun through his back door. 
A Democrat state representative par-
ticipated in the unrest and actually ac-
cused the officer, who lives in the home 
with his girlfriend and two children, of 
aggressively provoking the confronta-
tion by ‘‘choosing to come out of his 
home.’’ 
So I think about my district. I was 
talking to the mayor a short week 
after I was sworn in on May 19, when 
the riots were happening in Min-
neapolis, and he was wondering, along 
with lots of other citizens in St. Croix 
and Polk Counties on the western edge 
of Wisconsin, are the riots of Min-
neapolis going to come to our commu-
nity? We can only hope that that does 
not happen here as we close out 2020. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, when I re-
flect on the incident of the weekend 
when the two L.A. County deputies 
were shot and they had to tend to each 
other and apply first aid to each other, 
and they were rushed to the hospital, 
the rigid cruelty of the mob that gath-
ered at the hospital trying to block an 
ambulance from accessing the emer-
gency room, accompanied with hateful 
shouts and taunts, as evidence of the 
loss of goodness in our society. 
The feckless leaders of some States 
and cities that have not only permitted 
the destruction of property, but the 
wasting of lives and livelihoods are 
without heart, as well. In many cases 
they have not only stood by watching 
the wreckage, they have fomented the 
rioting, looting, the murder, and may-
hem. 
b 1700 
One of the enemies of a free society is 
one who will appease people who are in-
tent on destroying the rights of indi-
viduals within that society, those who 
permit and encourage by inaction 
criminal conduct. 
We saw this when the Portland 
mayor, Ted Wheeler, was driven from 
his own home because the mob had 
turned on him. He is not alone. 
Winston Churchill once noted that an 
appeaser is someone who feeds others 
to the alligators with the hopes that he 
will be eaten last. That is what is being 
lived out in some American cities be-
fore our eyes today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CLOUD), my friend. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, who would 
have 
thought—who 
would 
have 
thought—that today we would be here 
discussing this topic. 
When I ran for office, when I stood in 
this room for the first time and took 
the oath of office to protect and defend 
the Constitution, I expected that we 
would have many discussions on this 
floor with deeply held opposing views 
on the many issues facing our Nation. 
I did not expect that one of those 
issues would be whether this, the law-
making body of our Nation, expects the 
laws to be followed, or whether or not 
we support the brave men and women 
tasked with enforcing that law. 
Policing is a noble and necessary pro-
fession of any civil society, a profes-
sion which, by and large, is full of dedi-
cated, courageous citizens who have 
chosen to serve their community, often 
putting aside higher-paying professions 
to work in one of the most difficult, 
challenging 
jobs, 
daily 
prioritizing 
public safety over their own. 
It is these families for whom the 
greatest sound one hears is the sound 
of Velcro at the end of each shift as 
their loved one removes their body 
armor and takes up their other most 
important duty of being a mom, dad, 
brother, or sister. For too many of our 
law enforcement officers’ families, be-
cause of the violence against police, 
they are now denied the joy of that mo-
ment. 
Each day, we see images of organized 
armed riots embracing lawlessness, de-
stroying property, sowing hate, and in-
stilling fear, all in order to advance a 
political agenda. 
The barrage of destruction and vio-
lence in major American cities is al-
most nonstop. The rioters across the 
Nation have cost over $1 billion in 
damages and claimed numerous lives. 
In one of the latest acts of horrific 
violence, two Los Angeles County sher-
iff’s deputies were shot and critically 
injured as they sat in their patrol car 
at a metro rail station Saturday 
evening. Protesters gathered outside 
the hospital where the deputies were 
receiving treatment, some chanting: 
‘‘Death to police. Kill the police.’’ This 
is shameful and cannot be tolerated. 
It is notable that this mass chaos is 
occurring in cities with leftist leaders 
who have been tragically slow at con-
demning the violence. 
This lack of leadership, we might 
add, whether by intentional design or 
perhaps by good but misguided inten-
tions, has kept entire segments of our 
population in failing schools, in crime- 
ridden communities, and in genera-
tional cycles of poverty and depend-
ency. 
We owe it to the American people to 
protect their homes, families, and busi-
nesses from any mob that seeks to tear 
down our society.

September 16, 2020 
We owe it to our hardworking police 
officers, who dedicate their lives to up-
holding the law, to give them respect 
and provide them with the resources, 
training, and support they need to do 
their jobs safely and effectively. 
This is why I stand with the Amer-
ican people, with our law enforcement, 
and will oppose any attempt to, in a 
matter of fact or even in simply imag-
ining, defund the police. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for being here tonight. I ap-
preciate his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE), my friend. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman BIGGS
for organizing this 
evening. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of our men and women in law enforce-
ment and to call for the restoration of 
the rule of law in this country. 
Over the past several months, we 
have heard politicians, pundits, and 
riot participants vilifying our Nation’s 
law enforcement officers, brave men 
and women who have sworn an oath to 
protect and serve their communities. 
We must remember that words have 
consequences, especially when those 
words are uttered by Members in this 
Chamber. 
The overwhelming majority of police 
officers are good people. These men and 
women do the right job for the right 
reasons, and the people of Virginia’s 
Sixth District strongly support these 
brave men and women. We have seen 
Back the Blue rallies spring up across 
the Commonwealth. 
Following the ambush of two sheriff’s 
deputies in L.A. County this past week-
end, I was moved to speak today to 
urge my colleagues to recommit them-
selves to honoring those in blue. 
According to the Officer Down Memo-
rial Page, 193 members of law enforce-
ment have been killed this year in the 
line of duty, nearly 40 of whom were as 
a result of a gunshot wound. 
These brave souls were moms, dads, 
brothers, sisters, husbands, and wives, 
each with a story, and each laid down 
their life for their fellow citizens. 
Their deaths bring no more holidays, 
no more anniversaries, no more birth-
days, simply no more days. 
Regardless of race, gender, or creed, 
police officers are there in times of cri-
sis. They very literally answer the call 
and run toward the sounds of danger 
while others run from them. 
Too many have given their last full 
measure in the line of duty, only to 
have their memory disgraced with calls 
to defund and dismantle our police de-
partments, which by doing so would de-
stroy the peace in which Americans are 
blessed to live. 
Some in this Chamber have been ac-
tually pushing an antipolice agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, I am tired of folks play-
ing politics with people’s lives. Over 
the past few months, we have seen too 
much death, too much destruction, and 
too much division. We must restore the 
rule of law in this country, and we 
must get our country back on track. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS), my friend. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague and friend from the great 
State of Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) for orga-
nizing this Special Order so we can 
focus on the civil unrest that has en-
veloped our Nation in recent months. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of 
my colleagues who have already shared 
their thoughts on how we can stop the 
unrest and restore law and order. 
Too many Americans are home to-
night worried about what will happen 
if a violent mob descends on their com-
munity or on their small business. 
That is why I join my friends here to-
night and rise up to voice my concerns 
about 
leftwing 
activists 
running 
through our streets rioting, looting, 
and destroying people’s livelihoods. 
But what concerns me the most is 
that we are not holding them account-
able for their actions. That is why I 
have written a bill that would strip a 
rioter caught and convicted of looting, 
vandalism, or violence of coronavirus 
unemployment benefits. 
While we all support the right to pro-
test peacefully, I know I speak for my 
colleagues and my constituents when I 
say it is time to put a stop to the de-
struction of American cities and leav-
ing the taxpayers and small business 
owners as the ones who are holding the 
bag. 
My bill is called the Support Peace-
ful Protest Act. Not only would it hold 
those rioting and looting accountable 
by preventing them from receiving en-
hanced unemployment benefits, but it 
would also force those arrested and 
convicted to pay the costs of policing 
these spectacles. 
It is time to force these rioters to 
face the financial costs of their ac-
tions. They need to feel the con-
sequences of their actions. 
I offer this piece of legislation as 
part of a solution to stop the rioting 
and restore law and order across our 
Nation. The civil unrest is dangerous, 
and it must come to an end. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my 
friend and colleague, Mr. BIGGS, for let-
ting me share about my bill. I hope 
that all of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle will consider adding their 
names to it. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. BIGGS, once 
again, for holding this important Spe-
cial Order hour on what is on the top of 
the minds of so many of the American 
people. 
Thank you. God bless. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) 
for his words and also for his work on 
the legislation that I think will be very 
important. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR), my friend 
and my seatmate from Arizona. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman BIGGS for yielding to me. 
In 1928, U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Louis Brandeis said: ‘‘In a government 
of laws, the existence of the govern-
ment will be imperiled if it fails to ob-
serve the law scrupulously. . . . If the 
government becomes a lawbreaker, it 
breeds contempt for law; it invites 
every man to become a law unto him-
self; it invites anarchy. . . . Crime is 
contagious.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, let’s just look at the 
lawlessness perpetrated by our own 
government that the American people 
have had to endure and for which, re-
grettably, I have had a front-row seat 
for in my career here in Congress: Fast 
and Furious; the IRS attacks on con-
servatives; Benghazi, where four Amer-
icans died; Hillary Clinton’s email 
scandal; the attacks on the press of 
James Rosen, James Risen, and Sharyl 
Attkisson; the unmasking of American 
citizens; 
Russia-gate; 
Ukraine-gate; 
and now, Obama-gate. 
Who has paid the time for the crime? 
What we are witnessing today in 
many of America’s Democratic-run cit-
ies are the repercussions of years of 
lawlessness and amnesty in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Recently, I had a woman leave me a 
voice mail saying she ‘‘thinks it is to-
tally okay for her to come with her 
gun and shoot me in the head.’’ Only a 
couple days later, two L.A. County 
sheriffs were shot in the head. 
Do you know what happened as those 
deputies were fighting for their lives? 
The mob was blocking the entrance to 
the emergency room, chanting: ‘‘We 
hope they die. We hope they die.’’ 
That is how little regard the mob has 
for the rule of law and their fellow man 
in their disavowment of the greatest 
country in the world, the United States 
of America. 
President Trump is right: We must 
restore law and order. We must defend 
our police, not just by fully funding 
them but by increasing the criminal 
penalties for assaulting officers, bring-
ing violent groups like Antifa and BLM 
to justice, and applying existing Fed-
eral laws like RICO statutes to combat 
the patterned commission of violent 
crime. 
Ronald Reagan wisely said: ‘‘We 
must reject the idea that every time a 
law is broken, society is guilty rather 
than the lawbreaker. It is time to re-
store the American precept that each 
individual is accountable’’ for his or 
her actions. 
I strongly support law enforcement. I 
firmly disavow the groups and individ-
uals funding, enabling, and partaking 
in mob violence. And I call on my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to the men and 
women in blue and brown: Thank you. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend and colleague from Ari-
zona, Representative GOSAR, for his 
comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE), my friend. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman BIGGS for yielding. 
Look, we have all seen the out-of- 
control left hijacking our cities across

the Nation, and we know where the 
bottom line ends. It is organizations 
like Antifa, where they are targeting 
police officers, burning down buildings, 
destroying private property, besieging 
Federal buildings, attacking innocent 
civilians. We have seen what happened 
with the police in L.A. and the chants 
that took place there. 
But all this type of behavior does not 
happen in a vacuum. It doesn’t happen 
in a vacuum. 
In fact, we are seeing all of this 
fueled by reckless rhetoric, much of it 
coming 
from 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues, where they say things like: All 
cops are evil, all cops are bad, and cries 
to defund the police. 
The result we are watching? Record 
numbers of police murdered and killed 
across the country, record numbers in-
jured. 
Yet, the left is still calling to defund 
the police. Rather than condemn this 
lunacy that is happening in our coun-
try, the majority continues to appease, 
continues to fuel this horrible behav-
ior. 
In fact, the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee won’t even admit that 
Antifa violence exists. He calls it a 
myth. It is unthinkable. 
Where is the leadership of the Demo-
cratic Party? Where is the Speaker of 
the House, for that matter? She has 
consistently downplayed this crisis 
that is happening in our streets. 
It is time that we have leadership 
here. It is time that we address the 
issues. The Speaker, frankly, should be 
ashamed of the absolute failure to ad-
dress this horrific behavior that is hap-
pening and the unrest that is hap-
pening in our country. 
In fact, when the Senate passed seri-
ous legislation, the Speaker went out 
to say that the Senate is trying to 
commit murder. My question is, how 
many murders have occurred on the 
streets of America since she made that 
statement? 
Rather than work with us, the Demo-
crats and the Speaker call us and the 
President domestic enemies and en-
emies of the state, and that is just to-
tally unacceptable. 
It is time that we restore law and 
order in this country, and it begins by 
restoring it right here in this Chamber. 
b 1715 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. NORMAN), my good friend. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
every American to look at this picture 
of what, sadly, has become ‘‘the new 
normal’’ in many cities across our 
great Nation. The one common thread 
for all of these cities is that they are 
run by liberal Democrats who tolerate 
these criminal activities: buildings de-
liberately being set on fire, department 
stores being looted of merchandise, po-
lice cars, as you see here, being bashed 
and torched, and our brave law enforce-
ment officers being executed in broad 
daylight. 
Imagine, if you are an owner of these 
businesses who invested a lifetime of 
savings, waking up to their places of 
work being destroyed through no fault 
of their own. 
Here is my question: Why have 
Democrats remained silent on con-
demning these acts of violence? 
Is it any coincidence that there is 
not one Democrat standing with us to-
night? Where are they? They are not 
here. 
I would submit that this is a preview 
of coming attractions to cities and 
towns all across our great country if 
this lawlessness is allowed to continue. 
Now is the time to support law en-
forcement, not defund law enforce-
ment. 
Now is the time to enforce our laws 
and put those criminals behind bars if 
they destroy private property. 
Now is the time to get back to we, 
the people, not we, the criminals, not 
we, the government, not we, the politi-
cian. 
In closing, you do not build up Amer-
ica by tearing down America. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), 
who will be speaking as fast as a Texan 
can speak.

I have two questions, Mr. Speaker: 
Where is the NBA? Where are those 
names? Where are the names I just 
read of the 43 police officers who have 
died in the line of duty this year? I 
want to know that. I want to know 
where those names are. 
My second question is: Where is the 
Speaker? Where is the Speaker of the 
House? Where is this body? Why aren’t 
we on the floor voting on a resolution 
honoring these fallen 43? Why aren’t we 
standing up for law and order? Why 
aren’t we standing up for security in 
our streets? Why are we instead turn-
ing over this country to mob rule? 
These names matter too, Mr. Speak-
er. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOH-
MERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, an arti-
cle from the Federalist by Joy Pullman 
today points out: ‘‘Contrary to cor-
porate media narratives, up to 95 per-
cent of this summer’s riots are linked 
to Black Lives Matter activism, ac-
cording to data collected by the Armed 
Conflict Location and Event Data 
Project. . . . Of the 633 coded as riots, 
88 percent are recorded as involving 
Black Lives Matter activists.’’ 
So all of these corporations that are 
donating money, it is very clear: They 
are helping a Marxist organization 
whose ultimate goal will be to relieve 
these corporations of all of their pri-
vate property. 
Way to go. 
Early estimates from insurance agen-
cies apparently say they have set a 
record in destruction for what the 
media—the alt-left media or main-
stream, whichever you prefer—say is 
just mainly peaceful uprisings. It is as-
tounding what has been occurring. 
This article from The Daily Signal 
points out, from yesterday, that if you 
go to the website for Black Futures 
Lab, a venture of Black Lives Matter 
founder Alicia Garza, and click on do-
nate, ‘‘it will ask you to send your 
money to an obscure organization, the 
Chinese Progressive Association, ex-
plaining that ‘Black Futures Lab is a 
fiscally sponsored project of the Chi-
nese Progressive Association.’ ’’ 
So there you go. You are not only 
helping destroy America and eliminate 
private property that you own, you are 
also helping the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
Congratulations for all of those. You 
are not making Black lives matter; you 
are helping the Chinese Communist 
Party.

PERRY).

the gentleman from Arizona for yield-
ing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4483 
September 16, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I am still sickened by 
the sight that I saw, that all of us saw: 
two officers who showed up to work, an 
assassination attempt, attempted exe-
cution, just for sitting in their car, for 
honoring their pledge to preserve and 
protect the safety of the citizens they 
serve. 
For the past month, law enforcement 
officers have endured attacks, have 
been shot at, bottles thrown at, fire-
works, glass bottles, powerful lasers at-
tempted to blind them. 
This year, as my friend from Texas 
said, 43 law enforcement officers have 
been killed, nearly twice the rate of 
last year. 
And what is coming from the other 
side of the Chamber here? You got it. 
Silence. 
When elected leaders refuse to stand 
with our law enforcement officers and 
continue to bend to the whims of vio-
lent mobs, we lose our civilization. We 
lose our civil society. 
Now, you think, when you watch TV 
maybe you see it on the news, it is hap-
pening far away, thousands of miles 
away across our country. But right in 
Pennsylvania where I live, south cen-
tral Pennsylvania, just on Monday, un-
fortunately, violent riots came to the 
streets on the heels of the death of Ri-
cardo Munoz, a mentally ill 27-year-old 
who was captured on a police officer’s 
body camera charging at the officer 
with a knife in his hand. 
Now, the death of Ricardo Munoz is a 
tragedy, no doubt, and my prayers are 
with Mr. Munoz’s family. However, an 
adult man wielding a large carving 
knife over his head while charging at 
police—by the way, having a record of 
doing this in the past, stabbing peo-
ple—is a clear mortal threat, and the 
officers are well within their rights to 
protect themselves. 
Let me be very clear. Every person in 
the United States of America has the 
right to peacefully protest. Your con-
stitutional right to protest, however, 
does not include violent riots, setting 
fires to things, looting, and harming 
and killing other people. 
Now, this is an account from that 
protest which wasn’t a protest: 
The mob marched from the scene of the 
shooting on Laurel Street to the police sta-
tion, chucking glass bottles, rocks, bricks, 
gallon jugs filled with liquid, and plastic 
road barricades at the police. A county vehi-
cle parked in front of the station was dam-
aged. 
Numerous buildings and vehicles were 
damaged, fires were set—all without regard 
for the owners and individuals who could 
have been physically harmed by the riotous 
actions. 
Mr. Speaker, anyone in this Cham-
ber, any leader in our community who 
does not stand up for civil society, for 
our police officers who take an oath to 
protect their citizens, is supporting a 
dangerous and deadly violent mob, and 
it absolutely must end. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I include 
the following items in the RECORD: 
A letter dated September 10, 2020, to 
the Honorable William P. Barr, Attor-
ney General; a newspaper article dated 
September 15, 2020; another one, dated 
August 26, 2020; another piece which is 
undated, which I will get the date for; 
and then another series of articles as 
well. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, September 10, 2020. 
Hon. WILLIAM P. BARR, 
Attorney General, 
U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC. 
DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: We write 
to share our deep concerns regarding the on-
going violence that has gripped American 
cities and threatened the rule of law across 
our nation. ANTIFA and other left-wing an-
archist groups have unleashed a barrage of 
totalitarian attacks on our country in recent 
months, including accosting a sitting U.S. 
Senator, hijacking peaceful rallies, orga-
nizing armed riots, destroying property, 
burning buildings, stealing livelihoods, and 
spreading hate. 
It is clear that these individuals are well- 
funded and supported by a national network 
of left-wing activists committed to perpe-
trating violence and furthering anarchy in 
our streets. As such, we urge you to imme-
diately open an investigation to identify and 
prosecute all individuals and groups respon-
sible for funding and organizing these terror-
istic acts that are wreaking havoc on our na-
tion. 
As you know, 18 U.S. § 2101 makes it a fed-
eral crime punishable by up to five years in 
prison to incite a riot; organize, promote, en-
courage, participate in, or carry on a riot; 
commit any act of violence in furtherance of 
a riot; or aid or abet any person in inciting 
or participating in a riot. Tragically, we are 
seeing the letter and spirit of the law being 
desecrated on a daily basis, as ANTIFA and 
other organized groups of anarchists con-
tinue to infiltrate peaceful protests and 
launch violent attacks against American 
citizens. Tragically, these activities recently 
turned deadly in Portland, Oregon, as Mi-
chael Forest Reinoehl, who described himself 
as ‘‘100% ANTIFA’’ shot and killed a sup-
porter of President Trump. 
Additionally, the riots in Portland and 
other major American cities have revealed a 
targeted effort to destabilize our way of life, 
including 
deliberately 
targeting 
federal 
buildings and law enforcement in an effort to 
undermine the rule of law. The prolonged na-
ture and organization of these violent at-
tacks, including the rioters’ use of military 
grade helmets, gas masks, protective vests, 
and illegal fireworks, clearly displays the 
high level of coordination and outside fund-
ing supporting these anarchist groups. It is 
readily apparent that these individuals were 
outfitted for war and were clearly part of a 
planned effort to infiltrate peaceful protests, 
provoke violence, and further subvert our 
system of government. 
Unfortunately, these are not isolated inci-
dents. Well-organized factions of ANTIFA 
and other anarchist groups have taken ad-
vantage of peaceful protests to sow division, 
threaten free speech, and enflame tensions 
throughout the nation for more than 90 days. 
The violence occurring in our cities cannot 
continue. The DOJ must take action to stop 
these dangerous attacks. As such, we urge 
you to fully investigate the groups respon-
sible for these attacks on our republic and 
prosecute all individuals who are violating 
federal law by participating in, inciting, or-
ganizing, or funding these destructive riots. 
Thank you in advance for your consideration 
of this urgent request and your prompt ac-
tion to protect our nation. 
Sincerely, 
KEN BUCK, 
ANDY BIGGS, 
BRIAN BABIN, D.D.S., 
TED BUDD,

LA COUNTY SHERIFF SAYS PROTESTERS CALL-
ING FOR AMBUSHED DEPUTIES’ DEATH IS ‘AL-
MOST WORTHY OF ISIS’ 
(By Joshua Nelson) 
Protesters showing up at the hospital 
treating two deputies who were shot in an 
ambush and calling for their death is ‘‘some-
thing almost worthy of ISIS,’’ said Los An-
geles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva on 
Tuesday. 
‘‘It’s just a new low for the hatred that I 
don’t think anyone in this nation has ever 
seen before,’’ Villanueva told ‘‘America’s 
Newsroom.’’ 
‘‘We just don’t expect it on our own shores 
and we have been here fighting to save peo-
ple’s lives across the county—it doesn’t mat-
ter who you are and it is not something we 
are going to expect or tolerate,’’ Villanueva 
said. 
Villanueva on Monday challenged NBA 
star LeBron James to match and double the 
reward money, which is currently up to 
$200,000, that is being offered for information 
on the gunman who ambushed and shot two 
deputies over the weekend. 
‘‘This challenge is to LeBron James. I 
want you to match that and double that re-
ward,’’ Villanueva said. ‘‘I know you care 
about law enforcement. You expressed a very 
interesting statement about your perspec-
tive on race relations and on officer-involved 
shootings and the impact that it has on the 
African American community.’’ 
‘‘And I appreciated that,’’ he continued. 
‘‘But likewise, we need to appreciate that re-
spect for life goes across all professions.’’ 
The Los Angeles Lakers star has been one 
of the most vocal professional athletes to 
speak on social issues and to condemn police 
misconduct. After Jacob Blake was shot 
multiple times by officers in Wisconsin last 
month, James said Black people in America 
are ‘‘terrified’’ of police misconduct. 
‘‘I know people get tired of hearing me say 
it, but we are scared as Black people in 
America,’’ James said following the Lakers’ 
Game 4 win over the Portland Trail Blazers 
last month. ‘‘Black men, Black women, 
Black kids, we are terrified.’’ 
Villanueva on Tuesday said he had yet to 
hear from LeBron regarding his challenge, 
but that the NBA star needs ‘‘to take some 
ownership of exactly what he said in terms 
of propagating the idea that people are being 
hunted’’ due to the color of their skin. 
‘‘I think that is just flat out not the case. 
I think we need to hold those accountable for 
breaking the law, be it law enforcement 
when we are crossing the line, but, then we 
have to acknowledge the bigger problem of 
violence overall and this ambush, cowardly 
ambush, of the two deputies just doing their 
own job, doing their business there in Comp-
ton, really illustrates that. That is that the 
problem we need to address,’’ he said.

BLM BRINGS ECONOMIC STRESS
TO COMMU-
NITIES IT CLAIMS TO REPRESENT: PASTOR 
(By Bishop Aubrey Shines) 
Early in August a news story jumped out 
to me and not in a good way my friends. I am 
still thinking about it. 
As Fox Business reported on August 5, a 
trucking company will no longer deliver to 
cities that are defunding police. The co-

owner of JKC Trucking, Mike Kucharski, 
told Fox he was concerned for the safety of 
his drivers and their cargo going to cities 
where police have had their budgets slashed. 
As an African American and a minister, I 
knew something like this would happen 
sooner or later. 
My colleagues and I founded Conservative 
Clergy of Color because we were afraid some-
thing like this would happen if Black Lives 
Matter was the only voice in the room. 
We wanted to give a voice to African 
Americans who believe in real change, not 
leftist platitudes and want their country to 
be better. 
My father was able to watch this country 
become a better place from the segregation 
he knew growing up but now I fear the 
progress he witnessed is being turned on its 
head. We’ve now seen the first domino fall in 
the rollback of that progress. 
It’s sad we’ve come to this, but it’s the 
truth. Black Lives Matter has crippled the 
police across dozens of cities, and we’re now 
seeing the economic impact. 
These, friends, are the first tangible re-
sults from Black Lives Matter’s mad, anti- 
police crusade. These are the first far-reach-
ing consequences beyond the violence in cit-
ies this summer that has gone so long it’s be-
ginning to feel lethargic. These are the con-
sequences that BLM’s leadership probably 
are fully aware of, but that the young mis-
guided social justice warriors that make up 
their ranks haven’t stopped to think about. 
When you do stop and think about it, why 
should the owner put his drivers in danger? 
Why would he risk the danger in cities where 
police have been hamstrung and rioters have 
free reign of the streets? 
When young children like poor Secoriea 
Turner in Atlanta are getting gunned down 
in the streets, I wouldn’t want my employees 
going to those cities either. 
It’s sad we’ve come to this, but it’s the 
truth. Black Lives Matter has crippled the 
police across dozens of cities, and we’re now 
seeing the economic impact. 
Cities that normally receive commerce by 
way of trucking companies and shipping out-
lets are now going to lose a vital source of 
income. Depending on the size of the city, 
the effect could range from negligible to dev-
astating. 
Either way, it’s a problem none of these 
communities should have faced. But because 
city leaders and governments either were 
bullied into defunding their police or just 
felt like being politically correct, grocery 
stores and retail outlets are going to have to 
find other ways to supply their products. 
Now you might be thinking, ‘‘I see your 
point Bishop, but won’t another trucking 
company just step up and fill the void?’’ 
Ideally, you’d be right, but I would pose the 
counter-question of how long it will take be-
fore other companies follow JKC’s lead if the 
riots aren’t brought to heel soon. 
For that matter, how long will it be before 
other 
industries 
start 
making 
similar 
choices? How long will it be before the re-
sults BLM’s leftist ideology impedes dif-
ferent businesses from providing income to 
communities? 
What 
if 
a 
company 
like 
Staples 
or 
Walmart decides to build new facilities in 
Portland but then pulls out at the last sec-
ond because rioters there are still out of con-
trol? And it’s not just mega-retailers; I 
haven’t even touched on small businesses 
and entrepreneurs. If I were a young, bright 
individual looking to start my own company, 
I certainly wouldn’t want to do it in a place 
with kneecapped police and no guarantee of 
stability. 
The worst part of this debacle is that mi-
nority communities, the very people BLM 
claims to represent, will suffer the most. 
A weaker police force means less business 
in a community and that’s less jobs to go 
around including for minorities. 
Minorities in low-income neighborhoods 
need the work, not just bloated government 
welfare programs. These are minorities who 
could work in shipping warehouses, malls, 
stores, or startups are worse off if none of 
those industries decide to do business in 
their communities. 
BLM’s ‘‘justice’’ has already gotten black 
children killed on the streets. Its crusade to 
replace police authority with an anarchist 
mob has made it less safe in low-income 
neighborhoods than before George Floyd’s 
tragic death. But now we’re finally seeing 
the long-term consequences; the purging of 
business opportunities that will only drive 
minorities further away from prosperity and 
into the loving arms of government depend-
ency.

LA SHERIFF ALEX VILLANUEVA CHALLENGES 
LEBRON JAMES TO MATCH REWARD MONEY 
FOR GUNMAN WHO AMBUSHED TWO DEPUTIES 
IN COMPTON 
(By Louis Casiano) 
Los 
Angeles 
County 
Sheriff 
Alex 
Villanueva on Monday challenged NBA star 
LeBron James to match and double the re-
ward money being offered for information on 
the gunman who ambushed and shot two dep-
uties over the weekend. 
Speaking with KABC Radio on the John 
Phillips Show, Villanueva said the reward 
money reached $175,000—a combination of do-
nations of $100,000 from the county and 
$75,000 from two private individuals. 
‘‘This challenge is to LeBron James. I 
want you to match that and double that re-
ward,’’ Villanueva said. ‘‘I know you care 
about law enforcement. You expressed a very 
interesting statement about your perspec-
tive on race relations and on officer-involved 
shootings and the impact that it has on the

multiple times by officers in Wisconsin last 
month, James said Black people in America 
are ‘‘terrified’’ of police misconduct. 
‘‘I know people get tired of hearing me say 
it, but we are scared as Black people in 
America,’’ James said following the Lakers’ 
Game 4 win over the Portland Trail Blazers

Black kids, we are terrified.’’ 
He earlier tweeted his frustrations about 
police shootings. 
‘‘And y’all wonder why we say what we say 
about the Police!! Someone please tell me 
WTF is this???!!! Exactly another black man 
being targeted,’’ James wrote. ‘‘This s--- [sic] 
is so wrong and so sad!! Feel so sorry for 
him, his family and OUR PEOPLE!! We want 
JUSTICE.’’ 
It was not clear if James was aware of 
Villanueva’s challenge. Messages to the 
LeBron James Foundation were not imme-
diately returned. 
‘‘Let’s see what he does,’’ the sheriff said. 
‘‘I’ll be very curious to see what his response 
is, if any.’’

ST. LOUIS BLM PROTESTERS FROM MCCLOS-
KEY
CONFRONTATION
CITED
FOR
TRES-
PASSING 
(By Louis Casiano) 
Nine Black Lives Matter protesters who 
were confronted by an armed St. Louis cou-
ple on their lawn have been issued citations 
for trespassing, officials told Fox News. 
The June 28 encounter between the dem-
onstrators, and Mark and Patricia McClos-
key made headlines as the country was 
gripped by nationwide protests over police 
brutality. The couple—both personal injury 
lawyers—were seen on video and in photos 
pointing a handgun and a rifle as demonstra-
tors moved through their neighborhood. 
No shots were fired. 
Calls and emails to the St. Louis Metro-
politan Police Department from Fox News 
were not returned. 
The office of City Counselor Julian Bush 
told Fox News in an email that the citations 
were mailed to the nine people but that Bush 
has ‘‘not yet determined whether to file 
charges.’’ 
The protesters could face up to $500 in fines 
and up to 90 days in jail. However, Bush told 
NPR it was rare for anyone to receive such 
penalties for a municipal ordinance viola-
tion. 
Last week, Black Lives Matter activist 
Ohun Ashe tweeted that she received a sum-
mons. 
‘‘I was just sent a summons to appear in 
court for ‘‘trespassing on private property’’ 
on Portland P1 aka the street Patricia and 
Mark McCloskey live on,’’ the post read. ‘‘I 
had a gun waved in my face by them but 
trespassing is what matters?’’ 
Video footage captured the confrontation 
as 300 demonstrators marched in the street, 
claiming they were headed toward the home 
of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. The 
McCloskeys aimed their weapons at the 
marchers and have since been charged with 
felony unlawful use of a weapon. 
Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, 
has said he will almost certainly pardon the 
McCloskeys if they are convicted. 
The incident landed the couple an appear-
ance during the first night of the Republican 
National Convention last month, where they 
asserted their Second Amendment right to 
defend themselves. 
‘‘The radicals are not content just march-
ing in the streets,’’ Mark McCloskey said 
during a virtual speech. ‘‘They want to walk 
the halls of Congress. They want power. This 
is Joe Biden’s party. These are the people 
who will be in charge.’’

CONFESSIONS OF A NEW GUN OWNER 
(By William McGurn) 
On Monday it became official: The police 
issued me a gun permit. 
Never did I imagine I’d be here. Not be-
cause I was anti-gun. My dad was a career 
FBI agent, so my siblings and I grew up with 
guns. 
At the same time, my father was never 
particularly interested in guns. To no avail, 
we would beg him to go t o shoots to show off 
his skills. More frequently he would remind 
us that many who keep guns in the house are 
more likely to shoot a friend or family mem-
ber than a would-be robber or rapist. His 
proudest boast about his own career was that 
not once did he have to shoot anybody. 
This may help explain why we all grew up 
supporting the Second Amendment in prin-
ciple while not much interested in the prac-
tice. What changed? Certainly the rioters 
played a key part. But far more shocking 
than the rioters themselves has been the as-
sociated spectacle of police and political au-
thorities across America standing down in 
the face of night after night of criminal be-
havior directed at the lives and livelihoods 
of innocent, law-abiding citizens. 
Even in suburbia, many are no longer con-
fident our authorities would or could keep us

safe. In a small suburb such as mine, what 
would happen if even 100 or 200 people bent 
on violence were to arrive at once? Could our 
small police force really handle it? Or would 
we be left to fend for ourselves like Mark and 
Pat McCloskey in St. Louis, who defended 
their home and were then treated as if they 
were criminals? 
A few years back, I asked a former col-
league whom I knew to be pro-Second 
Amendment philosophically if he owned a 
gun. He answered no, and then asked if I had 
one. I said I wouldn’t know what to write 
down as my reason for wanting one. 
He told me, ‘‘Write down, ‘Because I don’t 
trust the government.’ ’’ 
That might have worked for the Founding 
Fathers. But in today’s New Jersey—a state 
ranked by the Giffords Law Center’s annual 
Gun Law Scorecard as the nation’s most re-
strictive 
after 
California—the 
response 
might be 40 squad cars on the front lawn by 
morning. I say this only half in jest: Do 
other Americans buying guns for the first 
time find it as grating as I do to learn that 
we need government permission to exercise a 
constitutional right? 
Equally illuminating has been learning 
about guns and those who own them. Over 
four decades in the news business, I have 
often written about the National Rifle Asso-
ciation, usually about some proposed new 
gun law. Most recently the NRA has been in 
the headlines over a lawsuit filed by New 
York’s attorney general in which she accuses 
top leaders of decades-long corruption and 
misspending. 
But our family’s decision to buy a gun has 
introduced us to the side of the NRA more 
Americans see: the education side. The NRA 
has courses, online and in person, for almost 
everything. The NRA instructor my wife and 
I engaged, Billy De Almedia, was firm, pro-
fessional and patient. 
It’s not just the instruction that im-
presses. It’s the sheer Americanness of a pri-
vate organization established to support a 
constitutional right in all its manifesta-
tions, from defending the Second Amend-
ment legally and philosophically to instill-
ing in newbies such as myself the respect for 
guns necessary to keep and use them safely. 
Not to mention a taste of the satisfaction 
that comes from mastering a new discipline. 
Surely if the government were to assume 
the functions the NRA provides, the experi-
ence would be akin to going to your local De-
partment of Motor Vehicles. In America, by 
contrast, the ethos emphasizes private ini-
tiative and responsibility. In our new inter-
actions with gun owners, gun instructors and 
owners of gun ranges, my wife and I have 
found them unfailingly eager to help and to 
answer even the dumbest questions. 
This year a record five million law-abiding 
Americans, like us, have become new gun 
owners. Many don’t fit the stereotype: Afri-
can-Americans account for the largest per-
centage jump in gun ownership, while women 
are 40% of first-time buyers. These new buy-
ers join an even larger demographic: the 43% 
of American households that already have a 
gun. 
The record gun sales for 2020 may have im-
plications for swing states in November as 
well. In Pennsylvania alone, the National 
Shooting Sports Foundation reckons there 
are 276,648 first-time gun owners this year. 
To put this in perspective, in 2016 Donald 
Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes. 
Now, I appreciate how unlikely it is that I 
will ever reach for a gun to defend my home 
or myself. But after watching the mayhem 
that’s taken over so many city streets I won-
der, probably with plenty of my fellow first- 
time gun buyers, what alternative I’d have if 
ever I had to make that terrible 911 call—and 
it went unanswered?

REP. JERRY NADLER SAYS ANTIFA VIOLENCE IN 
PORTLAND A ‘‘MYTH’’ 
(By Jessica Chasmar) 
Rep. Jerrold Nadler declared Sunday it’s a 
‘‘myth’’ that Antifa provocateurs are behind 
the ongoing violent protests in Portland, Or-
egon. 
In a now-viral video posted on Twitter, 
writer-producer Austen Fletcher caught up 
with the House Judiciary Judiciary Com-
mittee chairman on his way to his vehicle. 
‘‘I ran into Jerry Nadler in DC and asked 
him to disavow the Antifa violence/rioting in 
Portland. His response? ‘THAT’S A MYTH,’ ’’ 
Mr. Fletcher said in a tweet along with the 
video. 
‘‘It is true,’’ Mr. Fletcher tells Mr. Nadler 
in the video. ‘‘There’s violence across the 
whole country. Do you disavow the violence 
from Antifa that’s happening in Portland 
right now? There’s riots—’’ 
‘‘That’s a myth that’s being spread only in 
Washington, D.C.,’’ Mr. Nadler responded. 
‘‘About Antifa in Portland?’’ Mr. Fletcher 
asked. 
‘‘Yes,’’ Mr. Nadler replied before a staffer 
nudged him to get into the vehicle. 
‘‘Sir, there’s videos everywhere online,’’ 
Mr. Fletcher continued. ‘‘There’s fires and 
riots, they’re throwing fireworks at federal 
officers. DHS is there. Look online. It gets 
crazy, Mr. Nadler.’’ 
The New York Democrat was slammed for 
his response, which came as Portland en-
tered its 60th day of riots since the death of 
George Floyd. 
Portland is the home of Rose City Antifa, 
the oldest known so-called anti-fascist group 
in the country.

DHS LEAKED EMAIL CONFIRMS ANTIFA IS AN 
ORGANIZED GROUP 
(By Ian Miles Cheong) 
An internal email from the Department of 
Homeland Security leaked to CBS Catherine 
Herridge late Monday detailing that the vio-
lence in Portland was not ‘‘opportunistic,’’ 
but rather ‘‘organized’’—confirming long- 
suspected details about the Antifa move-
ment. 
The email explains that Antifa is organized 
and runs contrary to reports in the main-
stream media that Antifa was not respon-
sible for anti-police violence, but an im-
promptu movement spurred on by anti-fas-
cist sentiments held by most of the Amer-
ican public. 
A recent article in the Washington Post by 
Mark Bray, author of Antifa: Anti-Fascist 
Handbook, attempted to dispel ‘‘myths’’ 
about Antifa, claims that the group is not an 
organization, but rather a ‘‘tradition of mili-
tant 
antifascism.’’ 
The 
article 
disputed 
claims that Antifa ‘‘masterminds violence at 
Black Lives Matter protests.’’ 
In printed email documents attained by 
Herridge, the DHS’ Acting Under Secretary 
for Intelligence & Analysis Brian Murphy 
wrote to his colleagues on July 25 detailing 
his findings of Antifa in Portland. 
Murphy urged for an immediate change of 
definitions for the violent activity in Port-
land following a review of the individuals ar-
rested by federal authorities, as well as in-
telligence surrounding their affiliations and 
activities. 
‘‘The individuals are violently attacking 
the 
Federal 
facilities 
based 
on 
these 
ideologies,’’ he said in regards to Antifa, 
which he classed as VAAI or ‘‘VIOLENT 
ANTIFA ANARCHISTS INSPIRED.’’ 
‘‘We can’t say any longer that this violent 
situation is opportunistic,’’ wrote Murphy. 
‘‘Additionally, we have overwhelmingly in-
telligence regarding the ideologies driving 
individuals towards violence and why the vi-
olence has continued.’’ 
‘‘A core set of Threat actors are organized, 
show up night after night, share common 
TTPs and drawing on like minded individ-
uals to their cause.’’ 
TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques and 
Procedures. 
‘‘I recognize we may not be able to at-
tribute every individual as VAAI however we 
need to look at the totality of the intel-
ligence both current and previous and recog-
nize the motivation for the violence and why 
people have shown up to commit violence for 
about 60 days. And why the individuals are 
using social media to encourage the VAAI on 
the ground to carry out acts of violence.’’ 
The nightly riots in Portland numbered at 
sixty days when the email was composed. Ri-
oting has shifted from Portland to other cit-
ies with some of the same actors, including 
Washington DC, Seattle, and Kenosha—vio-
lence of which was spurred largely by pro- 
Antifa advocates on social media platforms 
like Facebook, Twitch, and Twitter. 
‘‘Threat actors who are motivated by An-
archist or ANTIFA (or a combination of 
both) ideologies to carry out acts of violence 
against State, Local, and Federal authorities 
and infrastructure they believe represent au-
thority or represent political and social 
ideas they reject,’’ Murphy concluded. 
Phrases like ‘‘Every city, every town. Burn 
the precincts to the ground’’ are a common 
refrain at Black Lives Matter rallies, and 
have been chanted during arson attacks on 
the Portland Police Bureau, the Mark O. 
Hatfield federal courthouse in Portland, and 
other facilities where Antifa and Black Lives 
Matter militants were present. 
The intelligence provided by the DHS vali-
dates claims by conservative voices who 
have long identified Antifa as an organized 
movement, and flies in the face of claims 
that the group was not intent on committing 
violence or conducting an insurgency against 
the United States government.

MILWAUKEE TRUMP SUPPORTER ARRESTED FOR 
BRANDISHING A GUN AT BLACK LIVES MAT-
TER MOB THAT WAS SURROUNDING HIS HOME 
(VIDEO) 
(By Cassandra Fairbanks) 
A Milwaukee man has reportedly been ar-
rested after pulling a gun on a mob of Black 
Lives Matter supporters who were sur-
rounding his home for several hours. It is 
currently unclear who the man is or why the 
mob was at his house, but he did have a 
‘‘Trump Train’’ flag hanging outside. 
Members of the mob claimed on social 
media that their actions were justified be-
cause he is a ‘‘racist’’ and had a confederate 
flag. The flag was not seen in the videos, but 
an American and Trump flag were hanging 
prominently on the front of his home. 
In livestream footage of the incident, the 
mob is clearly seen stepping on to the man’s 
property. 
‘‘They went specifically to his house to 
protest him for ‘being a racist.’ The home-
owner was arrested, and the crowd remains 
outside. They seem to have gone on his prop-
erty. WTF Milwaukee?’’ Kitty Shackleford, a 
Twitter user that archives riot footage, 
tweeted along with videos. 
After the mob was outside his home for 
more than two hours, police arrived. As they 
entered the man’s property, the rioters 
cheered for police and called for the man’s 
arrest, yelling about how he had a weapon. 
When the man was taken outside, seem-
ingly in cuffs, the crowd went wild. 
The militant leftists were threatening the 
man saying that he was going to have big 
problems if he dared to step outside.

As they threatened him, shined lights into 
his home, and pranced all over his property, 
he pointed a shotgun out the window. 
The person who called for the ‘‘protest’’ 
livestreamed the mob outside the man’s 
home for several hours. 
It does not appear that any members of the 
mob have been arrested. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, as we have 
recognized here today with our speak-
ers the importance of law enforcement 
to maintaining our rights and the safe-
ty of our neighborhoods and commu-
nities, I am reminded that it was just 
a little over a month ago, late July 
2020, when the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee in the House of Rep-
resentatives said about antifa, as the 
city of Portland was being burned by 
antifa, he said it is a myth. It is a 
myth. 
And then what has happened is an in-
ternal email from the Department of 
Homeland Security revealed Monday 
that the violence in Portland was not 
opportunistic but, rather, organized by 
the antifa organization. 
We have got to see that our Attorney 
General—I urge him, I urge the FBI to 
investigate and the Attorney General 
to take every action that the law al-
lows, whether it is civil RICO or pros-
ecution of these individuals, because, if 
you want to bring our society back 
into order, you take people who are 
violent, rioting, looting, causing may-
hem and murder, you arrest them. You 
charge them, you prosecute them, and 
you convict them. 
We know there are law enforcement 
who do a great job, but right now, in 
many places around this country, it 
will take a law enforcement officer 5 or 
10 minutes or longer to get to a home 
or a business that is under attack by a 
criminal. When that happens, if they 
are under attack, these individuals 
need to have the right, as they do 
under the Second Amendment, to pro-
tect themselves. That right must be 
protected and maintained. 
So I am kind of surprised—I am going 
to give you a fact here. In Pennsyl-
vania alone, this year, you have had an 
increase in new gun owners by more 
than a quarter of a million. More than 
a quarter of a million people in Penn-
sylvania own guns today who didn’t 
own them at the beginning of the year. 
Why? Because of what is going on in 
our streets, whether it is in Pennsyl-
vania, Oregon, or wherever else it may 
be. 
A mob circles a home in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin; an individual holds up a 
shotgun inside as this mob surrounds 
his home. What does the mob do, the 
antifa folks? They call the police to 
have this man arrested for having a 
gun on the ready to protect himself 
from that very mob. That is back-
wards. 
b 1730 
Mr. Speaker, we thank the police. 
The purpose of the police is to protect 
the weak and the rights of all. 
When our leaders in places like Port-
land, Minneapolis, you name it, casti-
gate the police or celebrities castigate 
the police, what they are really saying 
is: We are content with mob rule. That 
can’t be the case. 
We have heard this tonight from my 
colleagues who have said this so well. 
We support the police, and we support 
the thin blue line that protects our 
rights. This rioting and this mayhem 
must end tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Nebraska 
(Mr. BACON). 
RECOGNIZING DEAN C. MATHISEN’S SERVICE TO 
OUR NATION AND NEBRASKA’S SECOND DISTRICT 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
very respected friend from Wisconsin 
today for yielding. We had our 5- 
minute speeches cut short, so I appre-
ciate the opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recog-
nize Dean C. Mathisen for 20 years of 
service to our Nation and Nebraska’s 
Second District. Dean is retiring from 
Federal service at the end of the 116th 
Congress in January 2021. 
Dean is a former U.S. Army officer 
and a combat veteran. He served as a 
field artillery officer on Active Duty in 
the U.S. Army during the Cold War, on 
its front lines in West Germany. He 
was next assigned as a military police 
officer who deployed to the desert dur-
ing the first Gulf war. Dean also com-
manded a transportation company in 
the U.S. Army Reserves. 
In Nebraska’s Second District, Dean 
served over 12 years as a senior con-
stituent liaison for the Honorable Lee 
Terry from 2002 to January 2015. Dur-
ing this tenure, he was instrumental in 
identifying 
the 
need 
and 
commu-
nicating with the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs about bringing a national 
veterans cemetery to the district. Dean 
was a key element in finding the re-
sources to enable the first homeless 
veterans housing project in Omaha to 
be completed as well. 
Dean then crossed the Missouri River 
in Iowa in 2016 and continued his Fed-
eral service in the office of the Honor-
able JONI ERNST. Here, he continued to 
use his personal experience to aid him 
in understanding the needs of our mili-
tary 
servicemembers 
and 
veterans 
while solving constituent issues. 
In 2017, Dean became a member of my 
original Omaha district office team as 
a senior constituent liaison. During 
this time, he saw the need for and co-
ordinated the efforts to establish a 
Federal veterans court for the State of 
Nebraska. In the summer, Dean was 
promoted to deputy district director. 
In his free time, Dean is active in 
local animal rescue and animal-as-
sisted therapy. He is known in our of-
fice to be an avid horseman, hunter, 
and shooter. He is a member of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars and The 
American Legion and is known as a 
great Dane. 
I want to offer Dean my sincere ap-
preciation for his years of dedicated 
service to our great Nation and to Ne-
braska’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict. His retirement is well earned. He 
should take great pride in his accom-
plishments in both his military and 
civil service careers for the citizens of 
the United States of America and the 
constituents of the Second District of 
Nebraska. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Dean all the best 
in his future endeavors. 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH: HONORING KATHY 
AND GREG GONZALEZ 
Mr. BACON. I rise today, Mr. Speak-
er, to commemorate two wonderful 
people during Hispanic Heritage Month 
by honoring a husband and wife pair of 
wonderful police officers from my dis-
trict in Omaha. They have given life-
time contributions to law enforcement 
and have engaged in community efforts 
for our hometown. 
Gregory Michael Gonzalez and Kath-
erine Lynn Belcastro-Gonzalez were 
born in South Omaha in the early sev-
enties to immigrant families. 
One of six siblings, Greg grew up in a 
military environment as his father was 
stationed at Offutt Air Force Base. 
Kathy’s mother fled from Lithuania 
to Nebraska after her grandfather was 
taken as a prisoner of war. Kathy and 
her siblings were then raised in the 
basement of a Lithuanian parish in 
South Omaha. 
Kathy and Greg were high school 
sweethearts at Omaha South High and 
went on to become married first-gen-
eration college graduates. Greg ob-
tained an athletic scholarship at the 
University of Nebraska at Omaha, and 
Kathy attended the University of Ne-
braska 
at 
Lincoln 
while 
simulta-
neously working three jobs. She grad-
uated in 1993 and joined the Omaha Po-
lice Department the following year. 
Greg began his career in law enforce-
ment in 1993 as the only Mexican 
American in the Douglas County Sher-
iff’s Office. 
As assistant chief of the Omaha Po-
lice Department, Greg now helps over-
see the hiring of officers and works to 
reflect 
the 
diverse 
community 
it 
serves, including Spanish-speaking of-
ficers. Additionally, Greg is an adjunct 
police academy instructor and in-
structs criminal justice courses at his 
alma mater. 
As captain of Omaha’s southeast pre-
cinct, Kathy oversees one of the most 
culturally diverse areas in Omaha. In 
addition, her precinct also manages 
large-scale events and cultural celebra-
tions, including the NCAA College 
World Series, events at TD Ameritrade 
Park, and Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo 
and Aquarium.

Athletics are another passion Kathy 
and Greg share, and they believe com-
petitiveness and teamwork are inter-
personal 
skills 
that 
transfer 
from 
sports to the rest of life. 
The couple was instrumental in ex-
panding the already successful police- 
led sports program for at-risk and dis-
advantaged youth in Omaha called the 
Police Athletics for Community En-
gagement, or PACE. This program is 
led by police officers and volunteers 
and was founded in 2005 by Detective 
Tony Espejo, a 30-year member of the 
Omaha Police Department and veteran 
of the United States Marine Corps. 
Currently, retired OPD Captain Rich 
Gonzalez serves as PACE’s executive 
director. 
This September, Greg and Kathy cel-
ebrate their 21st wedding anniversary 
joined by their three children, Izabella, 
Greg Jr., and Alex. Overall, Kathy and 
Greg believe they would not be where 
they are today without the support of 
parents and extended family. 
With an extended list of combined ac-
colades and awards locally and nation-
ally, Greg and Kathy Gonzalez exem-
plify the American Dream and the 
quintessential rise to success from 
hardworking immigrant families. 
Mr. Speaker, we salute Greg and 
Kathy. May the future reward them 
with health and prosperity to continue 
to serve and protect our communities. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
tonight to address several issues. 
The first issue that has been in the 
paper lately is vitamin D. I have spo-
ken before this Chamber several times 
in the past on the importance of taking 
vitamin D. Over 40 percent of American 
adults do not have an adequate amount 
of vitamin D in their system. 
Several institutions of higher learn-
ing have done research and strongly 
suggest that vitamin D is a way to re-
duce the number of people who get 
COVID as well as greatly reduce the ef-
fects of COVID on those people who un-
fortunately get it. This has been found 
by MIT, by Northwestern in Evanston, 
and by Trinity College in Iowa. 
It has been my disappointment to 
this point that the appropriate govern-
ment agencies that have no problem 
sending out press releases and adver-
tisements on COVID have not ad-
dressed vitamin D. 
I was, therefore, elated to find out 
that, late last week, Dr. Fauci came 
out and supported the evidence behind 
vitamin D’s benefits. Even more than 
that, Dr. Fauci said that he has been 
taking vitamin D himself, which is 
very good. This is a change. 
Traditionally, many people out there 
said that you should even stay inside, 
and one way to get vitamin D is to be 
out in the Sun. So, the idea that we 
need more vitamin D is the opposite of 
what some of the experts or at least 
what some politicians have told us. 
Vitamin D, of course, is good not 
only to prevent COVID but to prevent 
other sorts of infections and res-
piratory problems as well. 
Now that Dr. Fauci has come out and 
told us that getting more vitamin D is 
a good idea, and particularly now that 
Dr. Fauci has admitted that he himself 
has been taking vitamin D, I strongly 
encourage the CDC and all other appro-
priate government agencies to pub-
licize the benefits of vitamin D. 
We have to do something other than 
just wait for a vaccine, which may or 
may not happen. And we all know, 
when it does happen, many people will 
not take that vaccine. 
I strongly encourage Dr. Fauci to fol-
low up on his statements with approv-
ing TV commercials talking about vi-
tamin D and the fact that he takes vi-
tamin D in his future interviews. 
Harvard estimates that 1 billion indi-
viduals worldwide may be vitamin D 
deficient, and of course, the rest of the 
world looks to the United States for 
leadership. So, the benefits would not 
only accrue to American citizens but 
to citizens around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I remind you to take vi-
tamin D, particularly if you have any 
friends or relatives who may be vita-
min D deficient or have special prob-
lems. I would talk to your doctor and 
anybody who is going in for a regular 
check-up. I would ask for a vitamin D 
test as well because there are ways to 
reduce the number of people getting 
COVID and to reduce the number of fa-
talities other than just hanging around 
and waiting for a vaccine. 
Mr. Speaker, the next topic I would 
like to address tonight is also a med-
ical topic that has been something I 
would have liked to address since I got 
here. I came across some information 
with regard to biosimilars, and that is 
people who need insulin. 
I consider myself an advocate for the 
Juvenile Diabetes Association, and I 
am aware of many different people who 
have diabetes. Depending upon the type 
of insurance you have, Mr. Speaker, if 
you have diabetes, you may be spend-
ing $100 a month on insulin. I have run 
into people who are spending $800 or 
$1,000 a month for insulin. 
Can you imagine if you have a child 
and you have to go out of pocket for 
another $1,000 a month just to keep 
your child alive? 
I ran into the fact that people are 
working on substitutes for insulin 
called biosimilars. I am introducing 
H.R. 8190, the Biosimilar Insulin Access 
Act, which will increase competition in 
the 
insulin 
market 
by 
making 
biosimilars available. Biosimilars are 
to insulin what generics are to normal 
prescription drugs. 
It would be tremendous if we could 
get more of these to the market. Right 
now, for whatever reason, it takes far 
too long to get these products to mar-
ket. Sometimes, they aren’t available 
at all. Because they are not available, 
people continue to have to overpay to 
keep themselves or their loved ones 
alive. 
Interchangeable biosimilar products 
are able to be automatically dispensed 
at the pharmacy counter for their 
brand-name 
reference 
product 
or 
brand-named insulin. We want to gen-
erate the same type of cost savings for 
insulin that we have already done in 
the past for generic drugs. 
I realize it is late in the session, but 
things can move fast. We all know that 
bills pass around here relatively soon 
after they are introduced. 
When I think of the people who are 
having to pay $1,000 a month or maybe 
just $500 or $600 a month for themselves 
or their children, I hope people in this 
building and the relevant committees 
and relevant leadership find a way to 
get this bill to the floor. 
I will be available to explain the im-
portance of this bill. I am ready to ex-
plain the importance of this bill to any 
of the Members. I will be on the floor 
the next couple of days talking about 
it. I hope to get a good cosponsorship 
list, but I do hope that the relevant 
committees immediately take up this 
bill and get it to the floor so that we 
can save as much money as possible for 
the people who are stuck with this dis-
ease. 
The final point I am going to bring 
up tonight is concerning border secu-
rity. It is an issue that, because of the 
COVID, has been pushed to the back-
ground. But pushed to the background 
or not, it remains to be important for 
this country. 
No country can continue to exist if 
they have open borders and unlimited 
and unvetted people continue to come 
here. 
Now, there are people who come here 
whom we do not expect to come here, 
who are caught or who come in contact 
with the border security, and there are 
other people who sneak across the bor-
der. They are never contacted by bor-
der security because, quite frankly, we 
have a shortage of agents, though they 
are caught on cameras. 
A year ago in May, right now about 
15 months ago, 16 months ago, about 
90,000 people came into contact with 
the Border Patrol and were allowed in 
this country—people who were not 
coming here through the normal immi-
gration channels. Since that time—it is 
something that has been underpub-
licized, and quite frankly, it ought to 
be more publicized by President Trump 
himself because he is not afraid to pub-
licize his successes—we have dropped 
from 90,000 people to under 2,000 people 
coming into contact with our Border 
Patrol and let in the country. 
This has been done by three things, 
all underpublicized. 
One, President Trump, in part by 
talking about tariffs—I believe, maybe 
not—has gotten the Mexican Govern-
ment to agree to hold people on the 
Mexican side of the border instead of 
having people who are asking for asy-
lum come to the United States and be 
released into the American interior 
where we never see them again.

We all know that some of these peo-
ple are probably drug-running. We

September 16, 2020 
know that some of these people are 
breaking the law. And we know that 
some of these people are going to wind 
up on some sort of public assistance. 
So we salute President Trump for 
reaching an agreement and holding 
people south of the border. 
The next thing President Trump has 
done is he has contacted the countries 
in Central America, Guatemala, El Sal-
vador, and Honduras and made sure 
they are holding more people of not 
only their own nations, but people fur-
ther south in their countries rather 
than allowing them into Mexico. 
Now, the United States does provide 
foreign aid to these countries, and I 
think it is important that we maintain 
good relations with these countries. 
But I think it has been under-pub-
licized that President Trump, through 
negotiations with these countries, is 
further decreasing the number of peo-
ple who are coming into this country 
who we do not necessarily want to have 
come into this country. 
And the final situation, is now people 
coming into this country, who may 
have COVID, are immediately turned 
around and told to go back home. 
So you combine these three things, 
and you go from about 90,000 people 
coming into contact with the border 
patrol and being allowed in here to—I 
am told—under 1,000. It is almost too 
good to believe. But that is what hap-
pens when you have a man of action, a 
person who is committed to holding 
people south of the border. 
This is particularly true because in 
the future, we have people talking 
about giving people coming across the 
border free healthcare. We already 
know—unless you are blind—that peo-
ple are taking advantage of public ben-
efits who are coming here illegally. 
So I think at a time when there is so 
much bad news out of government, we 
ought to pay attention to exactly what 
happened when we went over 90,000 to 
certainly under 2,000—and maybe under 
1,000 people—allowed in the country. I 
will point out that this does not in-
clude people who do not come in con-
tact with the border patrol. And in the 
year that is wrapping up, we estimate 
that about 10,000 people have come in 
here without contact with the border 
patrol. We know this because we have 
cameras taking pictures of people 
sneaking across the border. We do not 
have enough border control to turn 
these people around. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank 
the border patrol for the number of 
pounds of cocaine, methamphetamines, 
and fentanyl which they have turned 
around at the border in the most re-
cent year. That is certainly a degree of 
success. I know fentanyl, in particular, 
has been the newest lately, and I wish 
Congress would pay much closer atten-
tion to the people who are dying of 
fentanyl overdoses this year as the 
number of people who are dying of 
other unfortunate incidents. 
In any event, those are three things I 
want the American public to pay atten-
tion to. I, again, emphasize the impor-
tance of taking vitamin D. 
I emphasize the importance of get-
ting biosimilars to the market so that 
we can save money for the poor people 
who have to take insulin. 
And I salute the border patrol and 
the administration for all they have 
done in greatly decreasing the number 
of people who are coming into this 
country illegally. 
Now, of course, in the Chamber 
today, we have many different people. 
And I am prepared to ask to adjourn, 
but if the people in the front of the 
room would rather hear a little bit 
more about fenofibrates, I would be 
happy to talk about fenofibrates. 
Do 
you 
want 
to 
hear 
about 
fenofibrates? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman yield back? 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield the remainder of my time and ask 
for adjournment.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2020 
No. 160 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord, ride into our hearts 
today and fill us with Your power. 
Lord, give us such strength that we 
will face life’s difficulties with faith, 
hope, and love. May our lawmakers so 
embrace these spiritual attributes that 
Your Name will be glorified throughout 
our Nation and world. 
As our Senators dedicate their lives 
to obey Your precepts, direct them to 
Your desired destination. Lord, give 
them a faith that will not shrink when 
at times they cannot see clearly the 
road ahead. Help them to place their 
total trust in You. 
We pray in Your holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BELARUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
imagine the people of the United 
States have been able to follow the 
demonstrations in Belarus in opposi-
tion to the President declaring victory 
there. Since Aleksandr Lukashenko 
came to power in Belarus in 1994, he 
has consolidated power, and, in the 
process, suppressed democratic opposi-
tion. 
So the fact that the Belarus August 
Presidential election was a sham, as we 
all know, and he was once again de-
clared to be the winner by a highly im-
plausible margin, should not surprise 
anyone. 
However, 
this 
time, 
the 
Belarusian people have had enough. 
This time, brutal crackdowns by secu-
rity forces have not crushed grassroots 
demands for democracy. 
The quest for liberty is embedded in 
the DNA of the American Republic, so 
the Americans naturally watch with 
interest as the people of Belarus con-
tinue 
to 
demand 
their 
God-given 
rights. The American people stand with 
the people of Belarus. 
I also appreciate very much the 
strong stance taken by European gov-
ernments supporting the Belarusian 
people as the American people have. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Republican 
Senators, 
like 
working 
families all across the country had 
hoped—hoped—the Senate would be 
spending this week completing more 
bipartisan pandemic relief. 
We proposed another package with 
hundreds of billions of dollars to make 
schools safer for our kids, to help 
American workers keep or regain their 
jobs, and to invest more in testing 
treatments and finding and distrib-
uting a vaccine. But alas, Democrats 
filibustered it all, apparently intent 
that working families cannot receive 
any more relief until election day. 
Across the Capitol, Speaker PELOSI’s 
excuses and Goldilocks games are even 
wearing thin on our fellow Democrats. 
A few weeks ago, more than 100 House 
Democrats 
publicly—publicly—asked 
Speaker PELOSI to stop blocking action 
on any coronavirus legislation besides 
her multitrillion-dollar, far-left wish 
list. She ignored them. She completely 
ignored them. 
Yesterday, a number of House Demo-
crats tried again. They released a new 
proposal they had written to some Re-
publicans and pleaded with the Speaker 
to allow a vote on it. Again, she shot 
down any notion whatsoever of com-
promise. Now, bear in mind, the Speak-
er had explained she will block any 
compromise 
for 
kids, 
jobs, 
and 
healthcare 
because—because—passing 
anything short of multiple trillions of 
dollars would make her look like ‘‘a 
cheap date’’—a cheap date. 
The money that K–12 schools need, 
that unemployed workers need, and 
that we need for the race toward vac-
cines, Speaker PELOSI is blocking all of 
it because, apparently, to the San 
Francisco far left, anything short of 
multiple trillions of dollars would 
make her ‘‘a cheap date.’’ So, appar-
ently, for the sake of the Speaker’s 
personal ego, working families con-
tinue to suffer with no bipartisan help 
from Congress. 
f 
FILIBUSTERS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, since Democrats are stonewalling 
pandemic relief, the Senate is using 
our time to confirm more well-quali-
fied judicial nominees to lifetime posi-
tions on the Federal bench. Renewing 
the Federal judiciary has been a major 
success over the last 4 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5618 
September 16, 2020 
Since January 2017, President Trump 
has nominated, and this Republican 
Senate has confirmed, 211 article III 
judges, including 53 circuit judges. 
That is the second most appellate con-
firmations of any President in Amer-
ican history at this point in their term. 
This isn’t a partisan victory. The 
President has sent us impressive, quali-
fied men and women who understand 
the radical notion that the job of judge 
is to actually follow the law—follow 
the law. It is a victory for our Con-
stitution itself, but, believe me, this 
progress has not come easy. 
Throughout the last 4 years, our Sen-
ate Democratic colleagues have visited 
a historic degree of obstruction upon 
this President and his efforts to stand 
up the administration that the Amer-
ican people actually elected. 
Senate Democrats have forced us to 
break more filibusters on nominations 
since 2017—now listen to this—than had 
occurred cumulatively in all of Senate 
history—all of Senate history—before 
President Trump was sworn in. I am 
going to say that again. 
Senate Democrats have forced us to 
break more filibusters on nominations 
since 2017 than had occurred cumula-
tively in all of Senate history before 
President Trump was sworn in. They 
have attempted to filibuster more 
nominations in the last 3 years than 
the sum total of all prior Senates— 
from 1789 through 2016 added together. 
What was once a rare roadblock for 
the most controversial people has now 
become a daily norm. Before 2017, be-
fore this Senate Democratic minority 
got to work, only 5 percent of all nomi-
nations to district courts and circuit 
courts had been subjected to filibus-
ters. I will say it again. 
Before 2017, before this Senate Demo-
cratic minority got to work, only 5 per-
cent of all nominations to district 
courts and circuit courts had been sub-
jected to filibusters. Under President 
Trump, the number has been 80 per-
cent—80 percent. Our Democratic col-
leagues even obstruct nominees they 
don’t even oppose. We have taken more 
than 100 cloture votes on district 
judges, even though district court 
nominees from any State with a Demo-
cratic Senator could not have even got-
ten out of committee without Demo-
cratic support. 
So, to summarize, here is what we 
are doing this week. We are breaking 
Democratic filibusters on nominations 
because Democrats are filibustering 
coronavirus relief. And let us not for-
get the cherry on top. Because self- 
awareness apparently no longer exists, 
our Democratic colleagues have chosen 
this very moment to argue that they 
shouldn’t have to play by any of these 
rules if they ever get power them-
selves. 
President Obama calls the filibuster 
‘‘a relic of Jim Crow,’’ even as Senate 
Democrats use it over and over and 
over again. Democrats filibustered po-
lice reform and filibustered pandemic 
relief for working families. Some years 
back, the Democratic leader told the 
newspaper: ‘‘I am the leader of the fili-
buster movement [and] I am proud of 
it.’’ That was the Democratic leader. 
But now—now—they are saying that 
if they ever get power, they intend to 
tear up the rule book to force radi-
calism on our country. They want to 
break the rules to pass the kinds of 
radical, far-left policies that former 
Vice President Biden has rushed— 
rushed—to embrace, from abortion to 
socialism, to cracking down on the 
Second Amendment. 
And that is not all. It is not just 
about bad policies. They want to go 
even deeper and hot-wire—hot-wire— 
our democracy itself. The far left is 
salivating over the prospect of killing 
the filibuster in order to pack the Su-
preme Court, pack the Senate with new 
States, and tilt the playing field per-
manently so they can never lose power 
again. 
This is not some rightwing con-
spiracy theory. These are the signals 
they are sending publicly right now. 
This is what the left is saying out 
there. Maybe this hard-left hypocrisy 
plays well in a few big coastal cities. 
Maybe the angry crowds that are pull-
ing down statues of our Founding Fa-
thers want Senators who will pull down 
government institutions as well. Most 
Americans see things differently. 
f 
E-CIGARETTES 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on another matter entirely, a few 
days ago, the country got something 
that has been in too short supply in 
2020: some really great news—specifi-
cally, great news on the subject of pub-
lic health. 
According to the 2020 National Youth 
Tobacco Survey, administered by the 
FDA and the CDC, the number of 
American youth using e-cigarettes has 
dropped by 1.8 million since just last 
year—1.8 million in 1 year. That 
means, of course, that 1.8 million fewer 
young Americans are using e-cigarettes 
and vaping devices than 1 year ago. 
This victory for young Americans’ 
health is no accident. The experts say 
a number of factors are at play, but 
one major contributing factor unfolded 
right here in the Senate a little under 
a year ago. 
Last December, the President signed 
the Tobacco-Free Youth Act into law. 
It was a bill I wrote and introduced to 
stem the tide of what was a rapidly 
growing health crisis among our Na-
tion’s young people. The bipartisan bill 
I wrote with my good friend TIM KAINE 
from Virginia and with the help of 
other colleagues, including Senator 
TODD YOUNG, raised the minimum age 
to purchase tobacco products, includ-
ing e-cigarettes and vaping devices, 
from 18 to 21. 
This is based on clear-cut science. 
Public health experts tell us the harm-
ful effects of nicotine are most potent 
on bodies and brains that are still de-
veloping. Nearly 9 out of 10 adult 
smokers started by the age of 18. So we 
knew it was time to take action. 
I am proud to have led the legislation 
that took another leap forward in get-
ting nicotine addiction away from our 
Nation’s youth, and by the looks of 
these data, it has not taken long for 
our legislation to begin to pay major 
dividends. 
Nearly 2 million fewer teens in Ken-
tucky, Virginia, Indiana, and across 
the country are having their future put 
in jeopardy by these products. That is 
a win, and it has happened largely be-
cause the Senate stepped up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5619 
September 16, 2020 
head to the polls to cast their ballots 
in an election that, by necessity, will 
be conducted in a much different fash-
ion than in nearly any election in our 
Nation’s history. Because of COVID–19, 
there will likely be a historic increase 
in mail-in ballots. 
Mail-in voting is a process that is 
well established in our country. Sev-
eral States have conducted elections 
this way for years without any issue at 
all. Because of COVID–19, there may 
also be some delays in determining the 
results of the election while every bal-
lot is counted. This, too, has happened 
before, but there is no doubt that this 
election will be unique, and it means 
that leaders from both sides of the 
aisle should be joining together now to 
ensure the integrity of the election and 
the public’s confidence in the result. 
Sadly, there are some who are sys-
tematically undermining public con-
fidence in the voting process and irre-
sponsibly fanning suspicions and con-
spiracy theories about the legitimacy 
of election results. At the top of the 
list here is, unfortunately, once again, 
the President of the United States, who 
has exploited and capitalized on fears 
about holding an election in the middle 
of COVID–19 to attack mail-in voting 
and to advance comically false claims 
of widespread voter fraud. The Presi-
dent has done both of those. He has at-
tacked mail-in voting and made these 
false claims of fraud. 
We are talking about the integrity of 
our 
elections 
here. 
This 
is 
the 
wellspring of our democracy. It is fun-
damental for our country, something 
that American soldiers have fought and 
died for—and the President trifles with 
it, and, of course, our Senate Repub-
lican colleagues go along. 
So, today, we are doing two things in 
this regard because we have a responsi-
bility to do everything we can to see 
that this election does not mark the 
beginning of a new age when our elec-
tion results are doubted, conspiracy 
theories flourish, and our grand democ-
racy is tarnished around the world. If 
we allow this kind of malicious tam-
pering with the wellspring of our de-
mocracy in terms of people’s trust in 
it, it is the beginning of the end. 
Donald Trump doesn’t care. We know 
he only cares about himself. The Sen-
ate Republicans don’t say a peep. We 
know they are afraid of Donald Trump. 
Even when they disagree with him, 
they remain quiet, and too often they 
agree with him. 
We cannot allow our people to lose 
faith in elections, and we must do ev-
erything to ensure that they are con-
ducted in a fair way that the American 
people will accept, despite COVID and 
all the problems it creates. 
So, this morning, Senator SANDERS 
and I have written a letter to the Re-
publican leader asking him to work 
with us to establish a special bipar-
tisan committee with equal representa-
tion from both parties to guarantee the 
integrity of our election process. 
The committee should focus on three 
issues: one, confirm the security of and 
confidence in our mail-in systems, our 
vote-by-mail systems; two, measures to 
ensure that every vote is counted; and 
three, discuss and prepare for possible 
postelection scenarios. 
The function of the committee would 
be to hold hearings about what is being 
done around the country to make cer-
tain that our public institutions are 
prepared to conduct a smooth and reli-
able election, free from voter suppres-
sion and intimidation, that every vote 
will be counted and there will be con-
fidence in the outcome. 
Senator SANDERS and I and many in 
our caucus—including Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, whom I will mention in a 
minute—feel very, very strongly that 
we have to do something, and this bi-
partisan committee can ensure the 
American people that the Senate is on 
top of this. 
We hope the Republican leader will 
accept our request. We hope he will not 
run away from his responsibility to en-
sure there are fair elections. We hope 
that he will not go along with Donald 
Trump’s dangerous rhetoric about the 
fairness of our elections. 
Later today, the Senator from Min-
nesota and ranking member of the 
Rules Committee, Senator KLOBUCHAR, 
and I will be speaking with a bipartisan 
group of secretaries of state. We will be 
getting a briefing on the state of our 
election preparedness around the coun-
try. I expect they will reiterate their 
call for another major priority being 
blocked by Senate Republicans: elec-
tion assistance funding. 
I am hopeful we can still find agree-
ment on a bipartisan basis to help our 
States with critical funding to prepare 
for this historic election. This issue is 
above partisan politics. It is the es-
sence of our democracy. It is disgrace-
ful that Republicans are playing games 
with this—perhaps for electoral advan-
tage, perhaps for fear of President 
Trump—but we will not let it happen. 
We, as a caucus, repeat to the Amer-
ican people: The best way to prevent an 
election from being manipulated or 
stolen is to vote. The more people who 
vote and the earlier they vote, when 
they can vote early, the better off our 
democracy will be. 
RUSSIA 
Madam President, now, on Russian 
disinformation, another matter, the 
chairman of the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs continues to further his probe 
into the family of the former Vice 
President and plans to release a report 
next week that appears designed to in-
fluence the upcoming Presidential elec-
tion. 
While the rest of the country has 
been focused on fighting the global 
pandemic, for the last few months, the 
chairman and Republicans of the com-
mittee have wasted taxpayer resources 
to run a hit job on President Trump’s 
political rival. Even worse, it seems 
that several lines of investigation have 
echoed materials pushed by the Krem-
lin. 
In fact, some of the allegations that 
the Homeland Security chairman pur-
sues are the same ones propagated by 
Andriy Derkach, a known Russian 
agent who was recently sanctioned by 
President Trump’s own Department of 
the Treasury for interfering in our 
election. So here President Trump’s 
Department of the Treasury sanctions 
Derkach, and the chairman of the com-
mittee repeats the same kind of dis-
credited 
allegations 
that 
Derkach 
propagates. It is outrageous. It is a dis-
grace. 
The hearings and subpoenas that 
have come out of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee are also a disgrace by 
any standard. The more we learn about 
Russian agents like Mr. Derkach, the 
more it looks like the Kremlin is try-
ing to launder anti-American informa-
tion through the U.S. Senate, and be-
cause Moscow prefers to support Don-
ald Trump, as it did in the last elec-
tion, it seems that some of this 
disinformation finds a sympathetic au-
dience among Republican Senators. 
So today, alongside Senators WYDEN, 
PETERS, REED, and FEINSTEIN, I will be 
introducing a resolution calling for a 
cessation of any Senate investigation 
or activity that allows Congress to act 
as a conduit for Russian information. 
There should not be a single aspect of 
this Chamber that, wittingly or unwit-
tingly, furthers the propaganda ma-
chine of Vladimir Putin’s intelligence 
services. 
I will have more to say on this mat-
ter later, but for one of the most im-
portant committees to be echoing a 
Kremlin-backed conspiracy theory is 
beyond the pale. As we are about to 
hold a national election, it must stop 
immediately. 
VENEZUELA 
Madam 
President, 
finally, 
later 
today my friends Senators DURBIN, 
MENENDEZ, and VAN HOLLEN will come 
to the floor to try again to secure tem-
porary 
protected 
status 
for 
Ven-
ezuelans seeking refuge here in the 
United 
States. 
There 
are 
roughly 
200,000 eligible Venezuelans in the 
United States who are now at risk of 
being sent back to a failed and dan-
gerous nation, rife with political re-
pression and human suffering—a nation 
that, under Maduro’s regime, con-
stitutes the single biggest humani-
tarian crisis in our hemisphere today. 
Despite having all the authority that 
he needs to solve this problem on his 
own, President Trump will not grant 
temporary protected status, and his 
enablers in the Senate have repeatedly 
blocked passage of House legislation 
that would provide it. So we are going 
to try once again to get this passed. 
Democrats stand with the people of 
Venezuela. Later today, my Republican 
colleagues will need to decide if they 
want to restore the moral leadership of 
the United States and support the pro-
tection of Venezuelans fleeing violence 
and despair or leave them all in limbo, 
facing deportation to a humanitarian 
disaster.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5620 
September 16, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL DEBT 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in the 
beginning of September, the Congres-
sional Budget Office issued its latest 
budget outlook. The news wasn’t good. 
CBO announced that next year our 
country’s debt is projected to exceed 
the amount of our gross domestic prod-
uct. In other words, the size of our debt 
will be greater than the size of our 
economy. That is a very bad position 
to be in. 
Countries with that kind of debt-to- 
GDP ratio face time-sensitive decisions 
if they want to avert an all-out eco-
nomic crisis. Greece is just one recent 
example. We all know the kind of eco-
nomic devastation and accompanying 
turmoil that Greece has experienced in 
recent years. 
Now, as the United States, we can 
probably hang on a little longer than 
most other countries before entering a 
full-blown debt crisis. It is helpful that 
our economy was surging before being 
waylaid 
by 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
coronavirus, but even we can’t hang on 
forever. Sooner or later, if we don’t ad-
dress the size of our soaring debt, we 
are going to have a problem—a lot of 
problems, in fact. 
That is not something most of my 
colleagues across the aisle want to 
hear. They would like to spend as much 
as they want, whenever they want, on 
whatever new government program 
that they have come up with, and they 
imply that Republicans are miserly for 
not wanting to join them. 
Republicans, Democrats imply or 
sometimes say, just don’t care about 
the ordinary Americans who would 
supposedly benefit from Democrats’ 
spending. In fact, the opposite is true. 
In the face of the pandemic, Repub-
licans have been willing to spend huge 
sums to help our fellow Americans 
weather this crisis, and Republicans 
are worried about our spending and our 
debt precisely because we care deeply 
about ordinary Americans. We know 
what the consequences of unchecked 
debt and spending can be, and we want 
to protect Americans from those con-
sequences. 
To start with, the larger our debt 
grows, the more interest we are likely 
to have to pay—and we are already 
paying a lot. Right now, we are paying 
roughly $484 billion a year in interest 
on our debt. That is a substantial 
chunk of our yearly budget, and that is 
money that could otherwise be going to 
other priorities. 
And the problem has only snow-
balled. By 2029, the yearly interest on 
our debt is projected to reach $807 bil-
lion, according to one estimate. Now, 
that is going to eat up a lot—a lot—of 
money that could otherwise be spent 
on important investments: healthcare, 
veterans, infrastructure, defense, sen-
iors, education. We would have a lot 
more money to devote to those prior-
ities if we weren’t paying hundreds of 
billions in interest each year on our 
debt. 
Then there are the economic con-
sequences of a huge debt: The economy 
will 
struggle. 
Unemployment 
will 
grow. Businesses will create fewer jobs, 
if they create jobs at all. Wages and 
benefits will likely stagnate. The stock 
market will struggle. 
We have had to borrow a lot of 
money 
this 
year 
to 
meet 
the 
coronavirus crisis, and there is no 
doubt it is money we needed to borrow. 
That happens sometimes during a cri-
sis. But we need to be very aware of the 
fact that we have driven up our deficit 
by $3.3 trillion just this fiscal year, fur-
ther increasing our Nation’s debt, and 
we need to be very careful about any 
additional borrowing and ensure we are 
borrowing only what is absolutely nec-
essary. 
Republicans have caught a lot of flak 
from Democrats for not being willing 
to use the coronavirus as an excuse for 
unchecked government spending, in-
cluding 
for 
noncoronavirus-related 
measures, but we have made a priority 
of scrutinizing additional spending be-
cause we don’t want to get our country 
out of one economic crisis only to 
plunge it into another. Unfortunately, 
that is a lesson that is lost on many of 
my Democratic colleagues. 
We think the debt is bad now, and it 
is, but it is nothing like what our debt 
will look like if Democrats take Con-
gress and the White House in November 
and start putting some of their bigger 
spending plans into effect—plans like 
Medicare for All, which would cost, as 
a conservative estimate, $32 trillion 
over 10 years; or the Green New Deal, 
Democrats’ $93 trillion boondoggle. 
That is right, Madam President; you 
didn’t mishear that. The Green New 
Deal is estimated to cost over $93 tril-
lion over 10 years. To put that in per-
spective, the size of the entire Federal 
budget in 2019 was $4.4 trillion, or sub-
stantially less than the cost of 1 year 
of the Green New Deal. 
Now, you might think a pie-in-the- 
sky fantasy like the Green New Deal 
would have been abandoned by Demo-
crats by now, but you would be wrong. 
More than a year after its introduc-
tion, it is apparently still going strong. 
Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about 
Democrats’ threat to eliminate the leg-
islative filibuster in the Senate, and 
that is the Senate rule that helps en-
sure that bills that come before the 
Senate require bipartisan cooperation. 
Shortly before I spoke, the Senator 
from Massachusetts, who introduced 
the Green New Deal resolution in the 
Senate, appeared on National Public 
Radio, where he was asked whether he 
thought there were any parts of the 
Green New Deal that could attract bi-
partisan support. The Senator’s re-
sponse: The whole thing needs to be en-
acted—and if Republicans don’t allow 
that to happen, Democrats should 
change the Senate rules to eliminate 
the legislative filibuster. 
Apparently, Democrats aren’t willing 
to even moderate their proposal. If the 
Senator from Massachusetts has his 
way, Democrats will shove the entire 
$93 trillion down the throats of the 
American people. I guess the American 
people will just have to survive the re-
sulting debt crisis. 
When you ask about the pricetag for 
Democrats’ socialist fantasies, Demo-
crats will make noise about somehow 
paying for it. We will tax the rich, they 
say. The rich, they say, aren’t paying 
their fair share. The problem, of 
course, is that increasing taxes on the 
rich isn’t going to pay for these pro-
posals. 
You could tax not only the rich but a 
good portion of middle class at rates 
nearly 100 percent and not come up 
anywhere close to getting $93 trillion 
that would be necessary to pay for the 
Green New Deal. 
There is, in fact, no way to pay for 
these proposals. They will be financed 
by enormous additions to our national 
debt, and ordinary Americans will suf-
fer the consequences: a shrinking econ-
omy, fewer jobs, lost jobs, lower wages, 
lack of opportunity, and much more. 
I hope we will take action on our 
debt before it is too late. One thing we 
have to consider is how to shore up and 
protect Social Security and Medicare, 
which are currently the main drivers of 
our national debt. Thanks to an aging 
Baby Boomer population, these pro-
grams are under a great deal of strain. 
My colleague from Utah, Senator 
ROMNEY, recently introduced legisla-
tion, called the TRUST Act, to begin to 
address these endangered trust funds 
and to start to rein in our national 
debt. Bipartisan legislation like this 
would be a good start to preventing our 
country from facing an economic crisis 
in the coming decades. 
The Republican Senators sponsoring 
the legislation were joined by a handful 
of Democrats, which gives me hope 
that perhaps not all of my Democratic 
colleagues are determined to explode 
our national debt with their socialist 
fantasies. 
Unfortunately, 
too 
many 
Demo-
crats—including the Democrats’ Vice 
Presidential candidate—are open to 
bankrupting Americans with the Green 
New Deal and other plans. I hope they 
will not have the chance to implement 
their legislation because our economy 
and the American people might never 
recover from the consequences. 
I yield floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.

leagues think that the Presiding Offi-
cer is going to lose her race and a num-

S5621 
September 16, 2020 
lose their races and because it looks 
like there is going to be a Democratic 
President and a Democratic Senate and 
Democratic House, all of a sudden my 
far-right 
colleagues 
are 
concerned 
about the national deficit and the na-
tional debt. 
In President Trump’s second year in 
office, Congress passed a bill that pro-
vided about $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Be-
tween 70 and 80 percent of the tax cuts 
went to the richest 1 percent of the 
people in this country. It pushed the 
national debt into a whole new strato-
sphere. It took money we were going to 
use to build infrastructure—highways, 
bridges, water and sewer systems—and 
just ignored that plan. And now all of 
a sudden my colleagues are interested 
in the national debt—not when the Re-
publicans are in control; they want to 
give more and more and more tax cuts. 
But when Democrats are in control, 
Democrats want to invest in infra-
structure; Democrats want to save this 
economy right now, including pro-
viding $600 a week for unemployed 
workers—680,000 of them in my State, 
close to 400,000 of them in the Presiding 
Officer’s State—Democrats want to in-
vest in infrastructure and job training 
and protecting Medicare and Social Se-
curity. 
But 
now 
that 
Republicans 
think they are going to lose, it is all 
about the national debt and doing 
nothing to help workers right now. 
I want to talk today specifically 
about workers and how this President 
and all the President’s enablers—and 
they are enablers. My Republican col-
leagues don’t even speak up when the 
President so dishonors our fallen sol-
diers. They don’t speak up when the 
President has clearly lied, his own 
words, about the coronavirus—lied to 
the American people after he was 
taped, in his own words, by a former re-
porter and absolutely failed to speak 
up about workers. 
Every day we live with the horrific 
consequences of leadership failures in 
this country. So many Americans have 
lost jobs; they have lost small busi-
nesses; they have lost their sense of se-
curity; and they have lost much of 
their faith in their own government; 
and in nearly 200,000 American fami-
lies, they have lost a loved one. All be-
cause 
President 
Trump 
and 
his 
enablers here—all because President 
Trump has failed to get this pandemic 
under control, he has failed to protect 
American workers. 
A few weeks ago, I was talking to a 
woman in Cincinnati. I was actually 
home; it was a remote call. She is a 
grocery store worker. She said: You 
know, they call me essential, but I 
don’t feel essential. I feel expendable 
because they pay me so little, and they 
do so little to keep me safe at work. 
President Trump’s administration, 
get this, has gotten 8,000—8,000, 8–0-0– 
0—complaints about unsafe workplaces 
since the start of this pandemic. We 
know how many busdrivers have died. 
We know how many grocery store 
workers have died. We know how many 
meatpacking plant workers have died. 
We know how many hospital workers 
have died—not just nurses and doctors, 
and we grieve for them and their fami-
lies and applaud and are so grateful for 
their service—but it is orderlies who 
have died also, and the people who 
change the bed sheets and change the 
linens in the hospitals have died. 
The President has gotten 8,000 com-
plaints about unsafe workplaces. This 
summer, we had President Trump’s 
corporate lawyer, Secretary of Labor 
Scalia, before the Finance Committee. 
When I say ‘‘corporate lawyer,’’ I mean 
corporate lawyer. He represents the 
President in the Department of Labor. 
As a corporate lawyer, when there is a 
fork in the road, do I support workers 
or do I support corporate interests? 
Every single time he goes with cor-
porate interests. 
It is not a surprise because the Sec-
retary of Labor used to be a corporate 
lawyer who made millions and millions 
of dollars representing corporations 
against workers. That is the kind of 
person the President picked—if that 
doesn’t tell you a whole lot about 
President Trump’s betrayal of workers. 
He appointed the Secretary of Labor, 
somebody who always has represented 
corporations, making millions of dol-
lars against workers. So what is he 
going to do as Secretary of Labor? He 
is going to do what the President 
wants him to do. He is going to support 
corporate interests against workers. 
I asked Secretary Scalia in the Fi-
nance Committee, out of the thousands 
of workers who have come to you for 
help, how many in-person inspections 
have you done? Thousands of workers 
have come to him for help. How many 
inspections of workplaces have they 
done? Zero—zero in Atlanta; zero in 
Savannah; zero in Griffin, GA; zero in 
Covington, GA; zero in Mansfield, GA; 
zero in Stone Mountain, GA; zero in 
Ohio. 
I don’t know the Presiding Officer 
very well, but she took an oath to rep-
resent her State, as I took an oath to 
represent my State. And one of the 
things we do is fight—should fight for 
everyday people, for workers. 
This Secretary of Labor had done 
zero—zero inspections after 6 months 
of Americans reporting to work in a 
pandemic, and there were over 8,000 
complaints—8,000 
complaints 
from 
workers saying that my workplace is 
not safe. 
There is a pandemic. Zero inspec-
tions. Do you know what? Not one Re-
publican member of the Finance Com-
mittee—not one Republican Senator on 
the Finance Committee—spoke up and 
pushed Secretary Scalia to do inspec-
tions or to look out for workers. Why? 
Because it would have made the Presi-
dent of the United States unhappy if a 
Republican Senator had questioned 
what the President of the United 
States does. 
They don’t question him when he in-
sults our soldiers who have died. They 
don’t question him when he lies to the 
American public about the pandemic. 
They don’t question him when he fails 
his leadership role to protect workers. 
Zero 
inspections—6 
months, 
8,000 
complaints. Zero inspections to make 
sure corporations are giving workers 
the protective equipment and the other 
safety protocols they need. 
I demanded that Secretary Scalia, at 
this hearing, follow up and tell us 
about any inspections they conducted 
and what the results of those inspec-
tions were. He said he couldn’t get that 
information. He is the Secretary of 
Labor; I am not. 
Guess how many fines they have 
issued. Five—five fines. As far as we 
know, President Trump’s administra-
tion has only issued 5 fines out of more 
than 8,000 workers complaining that 
their employers are failing to protect 
them. 
Last week—a notable week for the 
Trump administration—they did some-
thing about workers, but listen to what 
they 
did. 
They 
fined 
Smithfield. 
Smithfield 
is 
a 
multibillion-dollar 
company owned by the Chinese Com-
munist Party. They fined Smithfield 
$13,000, after 1,300 workers got sick at 
just 1 plant in South Dakota, and 4 
people died. 
Let’s do the math: $13,000 fine, 1,300 
workers got sick. That is $10 a worker. 
They 
fined 
this 
multibillion-dollar 
company, owned by the Chinese Com-
munist Party in the United States, in 
South Dakota—they fined this com-
pany $10 per infected worker, a multi-
billion-dollar corporation. 
The idea that $10 a worker will stop 
these guys from continuing to abuse 
their workers is absurd. Do you know 
what? Every other corporate leader 
around the country heard: Oh, my 
gosh. President Trump is on our side. 
He is on our side every single time. 
President Trump is on our side when it 
comes to a complaint from a worker, so 
we don’t have to worry about making 
our workers safe because we know the 
President of the United States might 
fine us $10 per every sick worker. 
One-third of the workers at this 
plant got sick—one-third of the work-
ers. They were not putting all the 
money they make—the billions of dol-
lars that they pull out of South Da-
kota, this company, and send those 
dollars, probably electronically, I guess 
not by boat, to the Communist Party 
in China. All those dollars they take 
out of that plant, and they can’t put 
any of those dollars to invest in pro-
tecting workers to make their compa-
nies successful. 
President Trump could crack down 
on these corporations. He is not going 
to do that. He comes from corporate 
America. He inherited billions of dol-
lars. He has had a lot of personal bank-
ruptcies. Forget about that. He is on 
their side. Politics, government—it is 
about whose side you are on. Are you 
on the President’s side every single 
time, no matter what he does? Are you 
on corporations’ side every single time, 
no matter what they do? No matter

how many workers get sick, no matter 
how many workers they kill, it is on 
their watch—no matter how many 
workers they kill, you are going to be 
on the corporation’s side every single 
time? And the answer in Trump’s 
America is yes. 
Instead, he could mobilize workers. 
He could mobilize American manufac-
turers to get every American worker 
the masks and protective equipment 
they need. He could issue an OSHA 
temporary standard that would provide 
clear, 
enforceable 
requirements 
for 
keeping workers safe. 
He could stand up for workers. He 
campaigned on it. He could actually 
stand up for workers. But he will not. 
It is always the same story with this 
corporate President, always the same 
story. He wants to protect the big 
guys—workers’ health and workers’ 
safety be dammed. 
He campaigned in 2016, in my State— 
he surprised people how much he won 
by in my State. He campaigned by 
promising he would look out for work-
ers. He went all over Ohio; he went all 
over the industrial Midwest—the Great 
Lake States areas—telling workers he 
would take care of them and would 
fight for them. 
Now we know how much these work-
ers’ health and how much these work-
ers’ lives mean to this President— 
about $10 each. He has betrayed these 
workers over and over. His corporate 
tax cuts—Senator THUNE was talking 
about Democrats and taxes and the def-
icit in an easy-to-understand way. He 
betrayed these workers over and over. 
Corporate tax cuts: 70 percent of the 
benefits went to the richest 1 percent. 
He took away 100,000 Ohio workers’ 
overtime pay. He took away overtime 
pay from workers in Savannah, in La-
Grange, in Newton County, and Jasper 
County, GA. He took overtime pay 
away from my constituents in Cleve-
land and Mansfield and Shelby and 
Chillicothe. 
He stacks the courts with corporate 
lawyers. Those lawyers—now judges— 
will always decide for corporate inter-
ests against workers’ interests. 
He launched a boycott against Good-
year, a unionized tire-making plant 
headquartered in Akron—one of the 
greatest companies in our State and 
one of the most renowned, iconic com-
panies—because 
somebody 
made 
a 
statement about one of his ‘‘Make 
America Great’’ hats. He launched a 
boycott costing who knows how many 
jobs in that company. 
He has betrayed workers by his fail-
ure to fight for autoworkers and their 
jobs. 
He 
promised 
workers 
in 
Lordstown, OH: Don’t sell your homes. 
This plant may close, but don’t sell 
your homes. We are going to bring 
back these jobs. 
Then he did nothing when we asked 
him to help, and they shut down, cost-
ing 3,000 jobs. 
Most 
recently, 
he 
and 
Senator 
MCCONNELL and all their minions who 
follow Senator MCCONNELL’s lead took 
away $600 a week in unemployment 
benefits. What are those workers to do? 
What are those workers to do in Geor-
gia? What are those workers to do in 
Ohio? What are those workers to do in 
Illinois and Delaware when their $600 a 
week just disappears? 
I know there are a lot of wealthy peo-
ple on both sides of the aisle. There are 
a lot of very wealthy people here. 
There are millionaire Members of the 
Senate. When I hear millionaire Sen-
ators and billionaire people in the ad-
ministration say that $600 a week is 
just too much money—we can’t give 
these unemployed workers that much 
money. That $600 a week is too much 
money. They are going to get lazy. 
They are not going to work. 
When I hear millionaire Members of 
the Senate say such things, it sickens 
me. That $600 a week is the reason that 
millions of Americans didn’t fall into 
poverty during this terrible, terrible 
recession. But lo and behold, the ad-
ministration is happy and the Repub-
lican Senators are happy because the 
stock market has recovered. I know a 
lot of you in this institution have a lot 
of money in the stock market. I won’t 
even get into the conflicts of interest 
when you own this stock and you vote 
this away. Forget about that. You have 
a lot of money in the stock market, so 
I know you are really happy. I know 
the Presiding Officer and Republican 
Members of the Senate are really 
happy that the stock market recovered 
in the spring. So then Donald Trump 
doesn’t even have to pretend to care 
about getting this pandemic under con-
trol. 
Corporations are doing fine. Never 
mind the workers who are getting sick. 
Never mind the essential workers. The 
essential workers are the busdrivers, 
food service people, custodians, secu-
rity people, people who work in grocery 
stores and drug stores. 
The 
essential 
workers—who 
are 
mostly women, disproportionately peo-
ple of color, who mostly are barely ade-
quately paid—the essential workers 
face something most of us don’t: They 
work all day exposed to the public. 
They wear masks. They are safe—most 
of them. They do things safely. They 
work all day, and then they go home 
always anxious. 
Madam President, imagine feeling 
every day when you go home that you 
might have contracted coronavirus and 
you might pass it on to your family. 
Imagine the anxiety these generally 
low-paid workers face every day when 
they go home. We don’t think about 
them around here because corporations 
are doing fine and the stock market 
has recovered. The workers go home 
every night worried they will affect 
their families. Most of them won’t; 
they will get along just fine. 
American workers are tired of this. 
They are sick of this. They are tired of 
the empty promises. They are tired of 
the betrayals. They are tired of feeling 
like no one in this government, in this 
Senate, in this White House is on their 
side. 
If all of you would—could actually 
lead when the President doesn’t, we 
could pass a bill issuing an OSHA—Oc-
cupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration—temporary 
standard, 
pro-
tecting people. We could issue a tem-
porary standard to protect people on 
the job. We could pass pandemic pay. 
That is what the House of Representa-
tives down the hall did. 
When the House of Representatives 
passed their bill and they took that bill 
down the hall and put it in Senator 
MCCONNELL’s office there, I guess that 
bill got lost. One of the things that bill 
did have was pandemic premium pay. If 
you are one of those workers—I know 
this amount of money doesn’t mean 
much to the Presiding Officer or most 
of my Senate colleagues, but they 
would get up to $10,000 pandemic pay 
because they expose themselves in the 
workplaces—essential workers—to this 
illness. It would actually pay these es-
sential 
workers 
for 
putting 
their 
health and their lives on the line to 
serve us. 
It is time for us to step up. If you 
love this country, it is time we fought 
for the people who make it work. It is 
time we fought for the people who 
make this country work. Instead of al-
ways siding with U.S. corporations and 
with the wealthiest people in this soci-
ety, it is time we decide in this body to 
actually fight for workers. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise today in support of four highly- 
qualified California nominees to the 
U.S. District Court: John Holcomb, 
Mark 
Scarsi, 
and 
Judge 
Stanley 
Blumenfeld to the Central District of 
California, and Todd Robinson to the 
Southern District of California. (These 
four nominees know the districts where 
they will serve if confirmed, and I be-
lieve they have demonstrated in their 
legal careers the skills needed to serve 
as fair and impartial judges. All four of 
these nominees received Well Qualified 
ratings from the American Bar Asso-
ciation, and all have significant legal 
experience in California. 
John Holcomb, who has been nomi-
nated to the Central District of Cali-
fornia, is currently a partner at the 
law firm Greenberg Gross. Mr. Holcomb 
has spent more than 25 years in private 
practice, focusing on intellectual prop-
erty issues. He also served as a com-
missioned officer in the U.S. Navy. I 
understand that if confirmed, Mr. Hol-
comb will be sitting in the Riverside 
Courthouse, which is badly in need of 
judges. 
Mark Scarsi, nominated to the Cen-
tral District of California, is currently 
managing partner of the Los Angeles 
office of the law firm Milbank, Tweed. 
Mr. Scarsi joined that firm in 2007 after 
spending more than a decade with 
other California-based law firms, in-
cluding 
O’Melveny 
& 
Myers 
and 
Christie, Parker, & Hale. Mr. Scarsi 
specializes in patent cases, with a focus 
on intellectual property. He has tried 
some 28 cases to verdict, judgment, or

final decision, including 20 cases in 
which he served as lead counsel. 
Judge Stanley Blumenfeld, nomi-
nated to the Central District of Cali-
fornia, currently serves on the Supe-
rior Court for Los Angeles County, 
where he has presided over some 200 
trials since his appointment to the 
bench in 2006. Prior to that, Judge 
Blumenfeld spent nearly two decades 
as a practicing attorney, including 7 
years as an Assistant U.S. attorney for 
the Central District of California. 
Todd Robinson, nominated to the 
Southern District of California, is cur-
rently a Federal prosecutor in that dis-
trict, where he has served since 1997. 
Mr. Robinson has significant experi-
ence litigating in Federal courts, in-
cluding in the Southern District of 
California. He has tried more than 40 
felony cases to verdict, including 35 as 
sole or lead counsel. 
In closing, Mr. President, these four 
nominees are highly qualified, they 
have extensive practical experience, 
and they are ready to hit the ground 
running. It is my hope and expectation 
that these nominees will receive broad 
bipartisan support. I will be voting in 
favor of these nominees, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum.

SOCIAL SECURITY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we 
have recently seen yet another manu-
factured crisis by the Democrats for 
the benefit of the upcoming election. 
This is in regard to scaring the people 
about some notion that only Repub-
licans would think about taking away 
Social Security and Medicare. It is not 
true that any Member of this Congress 
will do that, but it always comes up as 
TV advertising against the Repub-
licans; you are going to scare old peo-
ple into thinking Social Security is 
going to be gone if you vote Repub-
lican. 
So this is another election season. If 
there are not any real issues regarding 
Social Security, the Democrats make 
one up, and they do it, of course, to 
scare the people into believing that 
some people want to destroy the pro-
gram, not realizing that it is such a 
part of the social fabric of the Amer-
ican population that nobody would 
think of doing it. 
We saw it in the last Presidential 
election when Secretary Clinton didn’t 
have a basis to attack then-Candidate 
Trump on Social Security because 
Trump campaigned on the basis that he 
wasn’t going to cut Social Security, 
but that didn’t stop them from making 
things up. With their lacking any real 
ammunition, Clinton’s allies here in 
the U.S. Senate decided to manufac-
ture a crisis. 
Now, why does something that hap-
pened in 2016 come up now? It is an ex-
ample that this is an ongoing situa-
tion, and it is happening in 2020. 
Back in 2016, three prominent Demo-
cratic 
Senators 
conjured 
up 
false 
claims about a nominee for the posi-
tion of public trustee of the Social Se-
curity and Medicare trust funds. That 
nominee happened to be a Republican 
who was nominated—can you imagine 
this?—by a Democratic President. He 
was already on there as having been 
nominated for another term. 
The false claims published in the 
Huffington Post were that this nomi-
nee, promoted by President Obama, 
was a Koch brothers-funded individual 
because he worked at an educational 
institution that received grants from 
the Koch Foundation. I don’t know 
whether they even made an attempt to 
connect this individual to the Koch 
funds, but it is irrelevant at this point. 
The Democrats claimed that this single 
individual somehow duped all of the 
other trustees, including all of the 
other Obama administration officials, 
into buying off on assumptions that 
would lead to an overstatement of the 
financial crisis facing Social Security. 
According to the three Democratic 
Senators, this was so bad that the 
Chief Actuary of Social Security felt 
compelled to write special notes to 
trustee reports and identify how shock-
ing the assumptions were. Of course, 
that would have meant that one single 
public trustee who happened to be a 
Republican duped outstanding Demo-
crats who were also trustees: Treasury 
Secretary Jack Lew, HHS Secretary 
Sylvia Burwell, Labor Secretary Thom-
as Perez, and then the additional 
Democratic public trustee. If you had 
bought into the Democrats’ allegations 
at the time, it would have meant that 
all of those Obama officials had been 
duped and had been too inept to see 
what had been going on and that only 
the Chief Actuary could have seen the 
light. 
Well, the chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Finance at that time in-
vestigated 
those 
allegations 
and 
showed that they were flatout lies. 
Even the Washington Post identified 
the lies in an op-ed titled: ‘‘The show-
down Democrats don’t need to have.’’ 
The Post concluded that the ultimate 
victims of what they called ‘‘petty 
politicization’’ would be ‘‘the perceived 
nonpartisanship and objectivity of key 
government reports—that is, the very 
values Senate Democrats claim to be 
upholding.’’ 
The Democrats used their misin-
formation campaign to run a smear job 
on a very qualified and well-respected 
nominee. They also used it to run ads 
against anyone who voted in favor of 
that nominee, including ads against me 
in my most recent reelection. 
Unfortunately, even though Social 
Security’s Chief Actuary was clearly 
implicated in the Democratic lies, he 
remained 
silent 
as 
then-Chairman 
Hatch and even the Washington Post 
identified how ridiculous and false the 
Democrats’ claims were. 
The Chief Actuary’s position, appar-
ently, is that, even if his office is being 
implicated as supporting clearly false 
and very public claims during an elec-
tion season, he will just sit quietly and 
let them go by rather than admit to or 
apologize for being used once it is 
pointed out to him that he is being 
used. 
All of that was 4 years ago. It is 2020 
now, and it is all happening again. Here 
we are in another Presidential election 
season, and, of course, like clockwork, 
we are getting another round of misin-
formation from the Democratic can-
didate and his supporters in the Sen-
ate. The Washington Post Fact Check-
er labels the current scheme in a head-
line that reads: ‘‘Biden campaign at-
tacks a Trump Social Security ‘plan’ 
that does not exist.’’ 
Now, that was a Washington Post ar-
ticle. Not often does the Washington 
Post talk about things that might de-
fend Republican positions against the 
Democrats. 
This time around, the misinforma-
tion stems from a letter written to So-
cial Security’s Chief Actuary by four 
Democratic Senators, including the 
minority leader, the ranking member 
of the Committee on Finance, and Sen-
ator SANDERS, who has been counseling 
former Vice President Biden. 
In a letter, these Democrat Senators 
asked the Chief Actuary to analyze hy-
pothetical 
legislation—now, 
those 
words ‘‘hypothetical legislation’’ have 
to be emphasized—what they say, even 
they wouldn’t support eliminating pay-
roll taxes. Of course, those Senators 
could easily find the information that 
they were seeking by looking at the 
latest Social Security trustees’ report. 
Instead, for purely political reasons, 
they wanted to draw in the Chief Actu-
ary once again. 
The same Actuary of 4 years ago is 
being used here once again, and the 
Chief Actuary at Social Security seems 
to gladly have played along and writ-
ten a response. He wrote that his office 
was not aware that anyone had pro-
posed 
the 
hypothetical 
legislation.

Nonetheless, he identified that, with-
out payroll tax revenue and no replace-
ment from the general fund, the trust 
funds would run out of money pretty 
quickly. 
Of course, this is obvious to anyone 
who has even slight knowledge of these 
programs, but information was not the 
aim of the Democratic Senators’ letter. 
Instead, it was to put forward a silly 
hypothetical case that doesn’t cor-
respond to anything that anyone has or 
is proposing. Of course, they attributed 
it to the President of the United 
States. 
I know you all now see the purpose of 
this replay—because it is an election 
year. They used the Chief Actuary’s re-
sponse to claim that authoritative 
sources have shown that President 
Trump has a plan to essentially defund 
Social Security, and in due course they 
engaged in the cottage industry of 
groups which exist here in Washington, 
DC, that regularly scare seniors and 
the disabled, especially before an elec-
tion, about some sort of backdoor plan 
or Trojan horse plan to destroy Social 
Security, and the Democratic Senators 
used the Chief Actuary’s response to 
feed the Biden campaign with a false 
talking point about Social Security. 
So you see the motives of these Sen-
ators in their using the Chief Actuary 
as their tool. You see it pretty clearly. 
The Biden campaign has run ads, stat-
ing, among other mistruths, ‘‘If Trump 
gets his way, Social Security benefits 
will run out in just 3 years from now.’’ 
Let’s go back to the Washington 
Post. Even the Post’s Fact Checker 
gave those ads four Pinocchios, mean-
ing that they contained a whopper of a 
lie. The Fact Checker also concluded: 
‘‘To make a long story short, Demo-
crats ginned up a letter from the chief 
actuary to describe a plan that does 
not currently exist.’’ 
In a followup letter that Ranking 
Member KEVIN
BRADY
of the House 
Ways and Means Committee and I 
wrote to Social Security’s Chief Actu-
ary, we expressed our concerns about 
the Democrats having, once again, used 
his office for political purposes, and, 
once again, it refers back to the 2016 
era that I have already talked about. 
From his response, we learned a few 
things. 
First, we got confirmation that no 
one has a plan to defund Social Secu-
rity, including the President of the 
United States. That confirms that the 
Democrats’ letter was just pretty silly, 
but not oddly, pure politics. 
Second, we got confirmation that the 
Democratic Senators, during the 2016 
election, published lies in the Huff-
ington Post article, invoking the Chief 
Actuary in an effort to smear a trustee 
nominee. 
Third, we learned that Social Secu-
rity’s Chief Actuary feels compelled to 
respond to any hypothetical posed to 
him by any Senator, independent of 
how silly or blatantly political it 
would be. 
Of 
course 
the 
Chief 
Actuary 
shouldn’t be so compelled. With that 
latter lesson, it would be easy for a Re-
publican Senator to ask the Chief Ac-
tuary to analyze hypotheticals cor-
responding to the allegations made by 
Senator SANDERS, one of the authors of 
the 
letter, 
concerning 
the 
‘‘hypo-
thetical legislation’’ about Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s history on Social Secu-
rity. 
Senator SANDERS, during the pri-
mary, has run political ads character-
izing Biden’s record on Social Security, 
saying that Biden’s claim that he has 
always protected Social Security are 
‘‘patently false.’’ 
It wouldn’t be hard to send a hypo-
thetical in for analysis by the Social 
Security Chief Actuary to get an an-
swer to reinforce Senator SANDERS’ 
views that former Vice President Biden 
has not acted to protect Social Secu-
rity. 
It wouldn’t be hard to send a letter to 
the Chief Actuary asking about how 
Senator SANDERS’ plans to reform So-
cial Security—which Senator HARRIS 
has cosponsored—would harm the mid-
dle class by raising payroll taxes, with 
no corresponding benefits for people 
with incomes below Biden’s $400,000 
threshold for defining who is rich and 
who is not. 
It certainly wouldn’t be hard to con-
struct politically charged hypothetical 
legislation and ask the Chief Actuary 
about it in order to make political 
points and use the Actuary’s position 
for political purposes. 
It happens that the Chief Actuary 
doesn’t exist for the purpose of polit-
ical interference. 
In my view, though, none of those 
would be a proper use of Social Secu-
rity taxpayer resources, in the same 
way that the Democrats are wasting 
resources using the Chief Actuary for 
political 
purposes. 
So 
Democrats 
should stop wasting Social Security’s 
resources trying to construct false and 
misleading political points to use in 
elections to feed their political base 
and dark money groups who then use 
the points in social media and attack 
ads against Republicans. But that is 
how 
they 
wasted 
the 
taxpayers’ 
money—by writing the letter and eat-
ing up the time of the Chief Actuary 
for nothing other than pure partisan 
politics. 
They should also stop politicizing So-
cial Security’s actuaries and the Social 
Security trustee’s position in their 
transparent attempt to mislead the 
public and try to score political points 
about Social Security. 
The American public should—espe-
cially during even years, in the runup 
to elections—turn a deaf ear to scare 
tactics that Democrats continue to use 
on Social Security beneficiaries. But 
when senior citizens who aren’t sophis-
ticated in the operation of the Federal 
Government or the uses of politics to 
scare people—they might believe this 
stuff. So you are doing a disservice to 
a lot of people who shouldn’t have to 
worry about where their next meal is 
coming from. 
As well, I think journalists should be 
more responsible when reporting on 
these political shenanigans, although I 
will note that even the most recent 
ploy was at least called out by fact 
checkers and given four Pinocchios. 
Rather than acting like demagogues 
on Social Security, we should do what 
we can to improve these programs. So-
cial Security trustees across adminis-
trations have continually and consist-
ently recommended addressing the pro-
jected trust fund shortfalls since pro-
tected benefits will continue to out-
pace revenues. 
Some sort of reform is inevitable, but 
outside of broad reform, there are 
many 
programmatic 
improvements 
that can help make the programs work 
better for beneficiaries and today’s 
workers. 
While not as encompassing as broad 
reforms, there are plenty of areas that 
we and Social Security Commissioner 
Saul continue to monitor and work to 
reduce backlogs and improve services. 
Just recently, for example, the Sen-
ate passed by unanimous consent a bill 
that we entitled ‘‘Improving Social Se-
curity’s Service to Victims of Identity 
Theft Act.’’ That was sponsored by this 
Senator and Senator SINEMA. This bi-
partisan effort will help people who fall 
victim to identity theft by providing 
improved services from Social Security 
with a single point of contact. 
In my view, more bipartisan work to 
improve the programs is the way we 
should go. Partisan attacks to scare 
beneficiaries into believing that people 
are out to destroy people’s retirement 
and disability benefits do nothing to 
help working, disabled, and retired 
Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from New Hamp-
shire. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to urge that we 
come together and resume negotiations 
on a comprehensive, bipartisan COVID 
relief package—the kind of package 
that this country has been calling for. 
Today, nearly 200,000 Americans, in-
cluding 436 Granite Staters, have died 
from COVID–19, and we still have as 
many as 40,000 new cases each day in 
this country—enough people to fill a 
baseball stadium each day. As a result, 
our economy continues to struggle, 
with nearly 30 million Americans still 
out of work and more than 1 million 
filing new applications for unemploy-
ment each week. Many Americans have 
been forced to raid their retirement 
savings just to pay rent and put food 
on the table—and that is for those peo-
ple who actually have retirement sav-
ings. Sadly, too many people do not. 
The President’s recent Executive or-
ders have many State unemployment 
officers tied up in knots. Those orders 
affect Social Security and Medicare, 
and they provide no new help for the 
nearly 13 million households who could 
be at risk of eviction in the coming 
months.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5626 
September 16, 2020 
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration and Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL have refused to recognize that too 
many Americans are still suffering and 
still need help. 
It has been 4 months since the House 
of Representatives passed the Heroes 
Act—a bill to provide assistance to 
Americans who are in need. Instead of 
negotiating a bipartisan bill, as we did 
with the CARES Act back in March, 
Leader MCCONNELL has released par-
tisan legislation—written in secret— 
that is woefully inadequate and ignores 
many of the problems I am hearing 
about from Granite Staters. 
Not surprisingly, the bill that was 
put on the floor last week—the so- 
called skinny bill because it didn’t pro-
vide the kind of help so many people 
need—that bill failed. I opposed that 
skinny bill because I didn’t believe it 
came close to addressing the public 
health and economic issues that our 
country is facing. It provided no fund-
ing for hospitals or healthcare pro-
viders on the frontlines, and the nurs-
ing home and hospital staff I talk to in 
New Hampshire tell me that more fi-
nancial support is needed to stem the 
financial losses from this pandemic. 
New Hampshire hospitals have al-
ready experienced more than $550 mil-
lion in lost revenue statewide, and they 
don’t see an end this year. Losses of 
that magnitude are unsustainable, and 
the skinny bill that we voted on last 
week would not have addressed those 
losses. 
That proposal provided no support 
for State and local governments that 
are facing severe budgetary shortfalls. 
The State of New Hampshire expects to 
experience a budget shortfall of nearly 
$540 million, over half a billion dollars. 
That is about a 20-percent drop in 
State revenues. 
In the city of Manchester, which is 
our largest city, they expect to spend 
$11 million between this year and next 
related to COVID–19 expenses—money 
they hadn’t budgeted for. They had 
hoped that some of those expenses 
would get reimbursed by FEMA, but 
under the recent order from the admin-
istration, FEMA is being told to no 
longer reimburse those expenses. 
So what I am hearing from mayors 
and municipal leaders in New Hamp-
shire is that they are soon going to 
have to face some very difficult choices 
about whether they are going to have 
to cut essential services like trash col-
lection and water and sewer and wheth-
er they are going to have to lay off 
teachers and firefighters and police of-
ficers. 
The bill we voted on last week, that 
skinny bill, provided no financial help 
for families struggling to pay the bills 
and put food on the table. There was no 
help in there to feed kids, nothing to 
address broadband needs—the needs 
that we have seen in New Hampshire 
for telehealth and for remote learning. 
We have significant parts of our State 
and significant communities where we 
have students who don’t have access to 
technology to do remote learning. 
There wasn’t nearly enough to help 
with testing and contact tracing and 
no real assistance for the Postal Serv-
ice even as it faces bankruptcy. 
Funding for schools in that skinny 
bill? That was tied to whether the stu-
dents are going in person or learning 
remotely. Well, in New Hampshire, we 
believe those kinds of decisions should 
not be made in Washington; they 
should be made by States and local 
school districts. If local school dis-
tricts don’t feel they can bring kids 
back safely, then they shouldn’t be 
forced to do that just to get the help 
they need to ensure that kids can go to 
school safely. 
I think the American public wants 
results. They want a bipartisan, com-
prehensive bill so we can address the 
needs of Granite Staters and the people 
of this country. That is what I am 
fighting for, and I believe it is past 
time for people to come to the negoti-
ating table so we can get that done. 
What we have seen during this pan-
demic is unemployment levels that we 
have not had in this country since the 
Great Depression. We need to provide 
additional unemployment benefits for 
people who need those dollars so that 
they can continue to pay their rent, 
their mortgages, put food on the table, 
and pay their bills. We need to make 
sure this emergency relief continues to 
be available to Granite Staters. 
Small businesses need a second round 
of PPP loans, which would prioritize 
those smallest businesses and those in-
dustries that have been hardest hit by 
this pandemic, industries like tourism 
and the hospitality sector. 
We need to provide support to our 
live venues. I recently visited the Bank 
of New Hampshire Stage in Concord, 
our capital. I heard firsthand how their 
business has been affected by the pan-
demic and the ripple effect that has on 
all live entertainment venues, on the 
performers who depend on those venues 
to be able to support themselves and 
the other members who are part of 
their performances. 
We need to make sure that childcare 
centers are supported. I was visiting a 
small business, a restaurant that has 
two locations in New Hampshire—one 
in Portsmouth and one in Epping. The 
business is called Popovers. It is very 
popular. What I heard from them is 
that the PPP loans had made a huge 
difference. They were able to keep 
some of their employees on. But as 
they are looking to the fall, they are 
worried about whether those employees 
are going to be able to come back full 
time because they don’t have access to 
childcare and they are not sure wheth-
er schools are going to be remotely or 
in person. We need to provide help so 
that those businesses can get their em-
ployees back to work and people can 
continue to support their families. 
We need a comprehensive bill that 
provides emergency housing relief and 
food assistance to Granite Staters. 
We should support our counties and 
towns that are experiencing historic 
drops in revenues and that desperately 
need help to continue providing the 
most 
basic 
services—schools, 
fire-
fighters, police, trash collection, water 
and sewer, and wastewater treatment— 
because those have been dramatically 
affected by the loss in revenue. 
Of course, we urgently need assist-
ance for our nursing homes and for our 
long-term care facilities, which in New 
Hampshire account for more than 80 
percent of the COVID–19 deaths, the 
highest percentage in the country. 
We need an answer from the adminis-
tration as to why they are not dis-
bursing the funds that Congress di-
rected. For instance, the CARES Act 
provided up to $200 million for nursing 
home infection control efforts. To date, 
only $17 million of that has been sent 
out to those long-term care facilities 
that need it. 
On top of that, HHS has only spent 
about half of the $16 billion that Con-
gress provided for the acquisition of 
personal 
protective 
equipment 
and 
other medical supplies. Nursing facili-
ties and providers across the care sys-
tem in New Hampshire desperately 
need this help, and they need it now. 
We had a hearing this morning in the 
HHS 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee, 
and I had a chance to ask some of the 
officials from HHS about why they 
have not distributed these funds. And, 
of course, the answer they gave me was 
this: Well, we don’t know. That is not 
part of our responsibility. 
Well, that is part of everybody’s re-
sponsibility—to ensure that funds that 
Congress has provided get distributed 
in a way that Congress has said they 
should be distributed, because we have 
people across this country who need 
that help and they need it now. 
We need a comprehensive bill to help 
treatment and recovery centers for 
those who are still struggling with sub-
stance use disorders, because we have 
seen this crisis worsen during the pan-
demic. We had been seeing deaths go 
down from overdoses in New Hamp-
shire, and since the pandemic, we are 
beginning to see those numbers go up 
again. 
This isn’t a problem that is unique to 
New Hampshire. I heard Senator CAP-
ITO in the hearing earlier this morning 
talking about the challenges that West 
Virginia is facing. It has become more 
critical than ever that Congress pro-
vide substantial funding for substance- 
use disorder treatment and prevention. 
We need real support for the post of-
fice, which was lacking from that skin-
ny bill last week. The Postal Service is 
the only Federal agency mentioned in 
the Constitution, and every commu-
nity in New Hampshire and the United 
States relies on its essential services, 
especially those States that have rural 
communities. A lot of rural commu-
nities in New Hampshire don’t have ac-
cess to the internet. They depend on 
the post office for communications 
going in and out and the packages that 
go in and out. What I am hearing from 
Granite Staters is that there are Post-
al Service delays that are affecting

their ability to pay their bills and to 
receive medications, and that small 
businesses are not able to complete 
their transactions. Congress has a re-
sponsibility to enact legislation that 
will restore timely delivery and fully 
fund the Postal Service. 
Finally, we need to ensure that the 
Census Bureau has the time necessary 
to execute a complete and accurate 
2020 count. You know, it has been in-
teresting to me to see the efforts of 
this administration to try and politi-
cize the census, because this is no red 
State or blue State problem. The 
States with the lowest percentage of 
households that have been counted dur-
ing the census are Alabama, Montana, 
Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, and 
South Carolina. They are mostly in the 
South, but not all. We must give the 
Census Bureau time to make a com-
plete and accurate count by including a 
statutory delay for the apportionment 
and redistricting count that is part of 
any package before we go home. This is 
something that the Census Bureau 
asked us for last spring, and it is some-
thing that we should make sure they 
receive, even though under political 
pressure they changed their request. 
Bipartisanship on these priorities is 
possible. We were able to negotiate the 
CARES Act legislation that passed the 
Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. We did it 
before. We can do this again because 
that is how government is supposed to 
work. We are supposed to come to-
gether and negotiate and deliver for 
the American people. 
Probably the most often heard re-
mark that I hear in New Hampshire is 
this: Why can’t you just all work to-
gether to address the needs of this 
country? 
That is what we should be doing 
around everything, and it is what we 
should be doing around responding to 
this coronavirus. 
We should not recess until we can get 
a bill to the President’s desk. We were 
sent here to do a job. We have an obli-
gation to get it done. The foot dragging 
has 
gone 
on 
for 
far 
too 
long. 
Brinksmanship 
should 
end 
because 
time is running out on the needs of the 
American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
morning the Republican majority of 
the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee authorized 
another smattering of subpoenas in 
what seems to be an ongoing effort to 
disparage a former Vice President and 
his family. 
While the rest of the country is busy 
fighting COVID–19, this is what the 
Homeland 
Security 
Committee 
has 
been up to—using the powers of the 
Senate to, in effect, conduct opposition 
research for President Trump’s cam-
paign. 
The Republican chairman has said he 
plans to release a report about it next 
week—merely a month before election 
day. There is a dark similarity here to 
the Republican effort in the House in 
the previous election to discredit the 
Democratic 
Presidential 
candidate 
with 
the 
Select 
Committee 
on 
Benghazi. 
You may remember the now-minor-
ity leader of the House Republican cau-
cus bragging that the Republicans cre-
ated the committee to bring down Hil-
lary’s poll numbers. You know what 
they say about a political gaffe: It is 
when politicians tell the truth. 
Well, it seems like the Republican 
chairman of the Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee 
has made the same gaffe that Minority 
Leader MCCARTHY made in 2016. In a 
little-noticed interview with a Wis-
consin radio station last month, Sen-
ator JOHNSON said that his probe would 
‘‘help Donald Trump win reelection,’’ 
and yet somehow the current activities 
of the Republican majority in the 
Homeland 
Security 
committee 
are 
even worse than what the House Re-
publicans did in 2016, because in the 
rush to find scraps of information for 
these investigations, Senate Repub-
licans may have collected and propa-
gated disinformation that came from 
Putin’s intelligence agents. 
Some of the allegations that the 
Homeland Security chairman is now 
pursuing are the same ones pushed by 
Andriy Derkach, a known Russian 
agent who was sanctioned by President 
Trump’s own Treasury Department for 
interfering in our elections. 
Powerful 
Senate 
Republicans 
are 
echoing the same claims that the Rus-
sians are pushing, the same nonsense 
that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 
elections and not just Putin. 
We have all become so inured to 
scandal during this scandalous admin-
istration, but the fact that a powerful 
Senate committee may have fallen vic-
tim to misinformation from Moscow is 
appalling. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would 
the Democratic leader yield? 
Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
chair will remind Senators that Rule 
XIX provides that ‘‘No Senator in de-
bate shall, directly or indirectly, by 
any form of words impute to another 
Senator or to other Senators any con-
duct or motive unworthy or unbecom-
ing a Senator.’’ 
Mr. SCHUMER. I am aware of it. Ev-
erything I have stated here is factual— 
everything, every single thing. 
So, this afternoon, my colleagues and 
I have drafted a simple resolution that 
calls for the cessation of any Senate in-
vestigation or activity that allows the 
U.S. Congress to act as a conduit for 
Russian disinformation. 
I cannot fathom how any Member of 
this Chamber could justify blocking 
such a resolution. There must not be a 
single aspect of this Chamber that 
wittingly or unwittingly furthers the 
propaganda machine of Vladimir Putin. 
Now, I know what my friend from 
Wisconsin might say. He will deny re-
ceiving information from the par-
ticular Russian agent that I have men-
tioned, Mr. Derkach, but Chairman 
JOHNSON has never provided a full ac-
counting 
of 
all 
the 
Russian- 
and 
Ukrainian-linked individuals he sought 
information from. One of the chair-
man’s subpoenas, for example, targeted 
a Ukrainian national who is an asso-
ciate of Mr. Derkach. 
So anticipating his objection to this 
resolution, I would simply ask the 
chairman to provide a full accounting 
of whom he sought information from, 
so we can know who they are, what 
their motives are, and, therefore, the 
Senate can see if they are trying to 
interfere with our elections. 
The chairman should have no issue 
furthering a complete accounting of his 
contacts with Russian and Ukrainian 
sources. The American people ought to 
know whether the U.S. Senate has been 
sullied by potentially receiving infor-
mation 
from 
discredited 
Russian 
agents. The American people should ex-
pect the Senate to pass this resolution 
today. 
What were our Founding Fathers 
most worried about? One of the top 
things—top things—was interference 
by foreign powers in our elections. 
Back then, their concerns were about 
bribery or treason or a foreign actor 
who 
infiltrated 
our 
government. 
Today, in our information age, the 
methods of foreign interference are dif-
ferent, but the risks are the same. 
Our chief adversaries—Russia, China, 
Iran, North Korea—have found that 
disinformation and misinformation are 
a weak point in open societies like 
ours. That makes it incumbent on us— 
all of us—here in the Congress to be 
careful about the information we re-
ceive and repeat. 
In the zeal for partisan advantage, we 
hope the Republican majority on the 
Homeland Security Committee has not 
become a sympathetic audience and a 
potential entrance point to foreign in-
fluence campaigns, wittingly or unwit-
tingly. What a disastrous and disgrace-
ful state of affairs. The Senate should 
pass this resolution today. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Oregon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of this resolution offered by 
the Democratic leader. We are calling 
for an end to a horribly flawed congres-
sional 
investigation. 
The 
foreign 
threats to our democracy—attempts to 
poison it with disinformation and to 
sow distrust—are an established mat-
ter of fact. 
It is especially troubling because for 
periods over the last year, two Senate 
committees have conducted an inves-
tigation 
involving 
Ukraine, 
former 
Vice President Biden, and his son Hun-
ter: the Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs Committee, led by 
our colleague from Wisconsin, Chair-
man JOHNSON; and our colleague from 
Iowa, Chairman GRASSLEY, of the Fi-
nance Committee, in which I am the

ranking Democrat. My staff has joined 
in interviews and received documents 
pertinent to the investigation. 
Given my Finance Committee role 
and my position on the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, I am unable to dis-
cuss classified information or details of 
an ongoing inquiry. However, I can dis-
cuss public information about the 
spread of Russian propaganda and the 
pathway it is following from Russian 
agents, through the U.S. Senate, to the 
American people. 
The Russian Government is again 
interfering in our election. This has 
been confirmed by our intelligence 
community. Its interference campaign 
includes disinformation about Vice 
President Biden and the work he was 
doing to fight corruption in Ukraine. 
To spread this disinformation, Russia 
enlists the help of characters like 
Andriy 
Derkach 
and 
Andriy 
Telizhenko. Derkach has been identi-
fied by American counterintelligence 
as an active agent for Russian intel-
ligence. This agent, instead of being 
treated as a foreign enemy, has met 
personally with the President’s lawyer, 
Rudy Giuliani, to further his task of 
undermining elections in America. I 
am not sure, colleagues, what you 
should call an American who aids a 
Russian agent, but counselor to the 
President is certainly not it. 
In August, the Director of the Na-
tional Counterintelligence and Secu-
rity Center issued a threat assessment 
on foreign threats to our election. It 
identified Derkach as a Kremlin-linked 
actor involved with attempting to 
denigrate former Vice President Biden. 
On September 3, Senator SCHUMER 
and I wrote a letter, along with several 
of our Democratic colleagues, urging 
the Treasury Department to issue 
sanctions against Derkach. It did so 
the following week, describing his role 
in what it called ‘‘a covert influence 
campaign centered on cultivating false 
and unsubstantiated narratives con-
cerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 
2020 Presidential Election.’’ 
Telizhenko is yet another Giuliani 
associate who, according to press ac-
counts, American counterintelligence 
has identified as a conduit for Russian 
attacks on our elections. He has also 
been a star witness in the Johnson- 
Grassley investigation. 
Derkach and Telizhenko have re-
leased what appears to be heavily edit-
ed portions of phone calls Vice Presi-
dent Biden held with Ukrainian offi-
cials in the course of his anti-corrup-
tion work. Some were released on the 
very same day. Telizhenko is promising 
further releases. Telizhenko also told 
the Washington Post that he forwarded 
more than 100 emails to staff on Sen-
ator JOHNSON’s committee and an-
swered their questions. 
Our colleague from South Carolina, 
Senator GRAHAM, was involved in the 
earliest stages of the Johnson-Grassley 
inquiry in 2019, but in February of 2020, 
Chairman GRAHAM said: ‘‘I called the 
attorney general this morning and 
RICHARD BURR, [then, of course] chair-
man of the Intel Committee, and they 
told me take very cautiously anything 
coming out of the Ukraine against any-
body.’’ 
The disinformation that these two 
have spread—Derkach and Telizhenko 
have spread—the disinformation these 
two have spread, largely a collection of 
unproven allegations and wild con-
spiracy theories, has obviously made it 
into many media outlets in the coun-
try all too willing to spread the prod-
ucts of Russian intelligence. It has 
been circulated by the President’s own 
legal team. 
From there, that disinformation be-
came the basis of much of the work of 
the Johnson-Grassley inquiry. I am 
going to have more to say on the de-
tails of that investigation in the days 
ahead, but for now, I will say this: 
Chairman 
JOHNSON
has 
repeatedly 
claimed in the media that he has un-
covered new and damaging information 
about Vice President Biden’s activity 
in Ukraine. This is simply not true. 
Nothing I have seen—not one bit of evi-
dence—could lead to the conclusion 
that Vice President Biden did anything 
wrong in Ukraine. What I have seen is 
a monthlong investigation that still 
has 
no 
legitimate 
basis, 
burning 
through an incredible amount of man-
power and taxpayer-funded resources. 
Neither of these committees, by the 
way, under the rules of the Senate, 
have any jurisdiction over our diplo-
matic ties with Ukraine. It has no leg-
islative purpose. 
This investigation, as I have pointed 
out on a number of occasions, also is 
happening under a clear double stand-
ard that has favored Republicans in the 
Senate and stonewalled oversight by 
Democrats. In my view, that is a sign 
that 
the 
flimsy 
accusations 
made 
against the Vice President can’t stand 
up to real scrutiny. 
The real nature of this inquiry has 
been clear all along. It began as a 
counterprogramming during the im-
peachment trial, and the urgency be-
hind the investigation really almost 
seemed to die out when the trial ended. 
It only returned—and again, these are 
facts. All of these are facts. It only re-
turned when the Vice President estab-
lished 
himself 
as 
the 
Democratic 
frontrunner. The day after the Biden 
victory in the South Carolina primary, 
Chairman JOHNSON sent a letter to the 
committee announcing his intention to 
kick-start the investigation with a 
subpoena. 
So now what I am going to do is out-
line what Senator JOHNSON said in his 
own words, because I think that is also 
very important as Senators consider 
this resolution. These are Senator 
JOHNSON’s words specifically. 
My colleague said in March: ‘‘[I]f I 
were a Democrat primary voter, I’d 
want these questions satisfactorily an-
swered before I cast my final vote.’’ 
The chairman said in August: ‘‘I 
would think it would certainly help 
Donald Trump win reelection and cer-
tainly be pretty good, I would say, evi-
dence about not voting for Vice Presi-
dent Biden.’’ 
He said in September: ‘‘Stay tuned. 
In about a week we’re going to learn a 
whole lot more of Vice President 
Biden’s unfitness for office.’’ 
Furthermore, the chairman, in my 
view, looking again at the public 
record, cannot credibly take issue with 
the work the Vice President was doing 
because he supported it publicly at the 
time. 
In June 2014, at a Foreign Relations 
Committee hearing on Ukraine, Chair-
man JOHNSON stated: ‘‘If we have to tie 
aid or help to make sure that anti-cor-
ruption laws are passed, I think we 
should do it.’’ 
In 2016, Chairman JOHNSON wrote a 
letter with a bipartisan group of mem-
bers of the Senate Ukraine Caucus to 
former 
Ukrainian 
President 
Petro 
Poroshenko. The letter reads: 
Succeeding in these reforms will show Rus-
sian President Putin that an independent, 
transparent and democratic Ukraine can and 
will succeed. It also offers a stark alter-
native to the authoritarianism and oligar-
chic cronyism prevalent in Russia. As such, 
we respectfully ask that you address the se-
rious concerns raised— 
And we are talking here about the 
Minister of Economic Development and 
Trade. 
We similarly urge you to press ahead with 
urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General’s 
Office and Judiciary. 
So these are the words, colleagues, 
the words of the chairman of the com-
mittee. That is why Senator SCHUMER 
and I believe this investigation, the 
Johnson-Grassley 
investigation, 
is 
baseless. We have brought forward a 
resolution that we believe is important 
to defending our democracy. It comes 
down to a question of what we want 
campaigns and elections to be all 
about. 
In my view—and I have always said 
this—right at the core of my being, I 
want elections about our best ideas. 
That is why I serve on the Finance 
Committee, to try to come up with the 
best ideas in healthcare, taxes, trade, 
and the like. Elections ought to be 
about our best ideas and having real 
debates and not attacking the other 
side with farfetched foreign misin-
formation, especially at a time when 
the American people are dealing with 
the crushing weight of one crisis 
stacked on another. 
There are 200,000 Americans who have 
died of COVID–19. I couldn’t disagree 
more with the President’s handling of 
the coronavirus pandemic. We have 
seen so much economic hurt. I cham-
pioned on the floor and, for a while, we 
had bipartisan support for basically 
bringing unemployment into the rel-
evant century and getting an extra $600 
per week to people and covering gig

workers and all kinds of other people. 
Yet, still, the economy has collapsed, 
and millions are out of work. My Or-
egon neighbors—a number of them— 
have seen their communities reduced 
to ashes. Thousands and thousands of 
homes and businesses have been lost. 
There has been a national outcry 
against racism and violence against 
Black Americans. 
Our elections are supposed to be 
about those kinds of issues, and in all 
of them, what I have tried to do is de-
vote my public service to bringing peo-
ple together and getting parties to find 
common ground on the best ideas of 
how to make changes in these areas. 
Now, that sure seems to me to be what 
the Senate should be all about rather 
than 
baseless 
attacks 
and 
foreign 
disinformation. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
resolution that Senator SCHUMER and I 
have championed. It is long past time 
for this badly flawed investigation by 
our colleagues to end. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of a 
resolution opposing efforts to launder 
Russian disinformation through the 
Congress, which is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object. 
I want to first point out—I want to 
thank the previous Presiding Officer 
for pointing out the fact that if this is 
not a violation of rule XIX, it is com-
ing pretty darn close. 
What you just witnessed here is this: 
We have witnessed Democrats doing 
what Democrats do so well, accusing 
the other side of doing exactly what 
they do—only 10 times or 100 times 
worse. 
Earlier today, I chaired a business 
meeting of the Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee, pre-
cipitated, created, made necessary by 
the fact that the ranking member of 
my committee presented an absurd, ri-
diculous interpretation of our rules. 
Based on the subpoena authority I re-
ceived earlier on June 4, the ranking 
member said, in order to actually 
schedule a subpoena or schedule a 
meeting—a deposition—I could come 
back for another vote. 
During my opening statement of that 
business meeting, having just described 
that level of meddling—which, by the 
way, the ranking member also provided 
that ridiculous interpretation to our 
witness, the witness, Jonathan Winer, 
an individual, by the way, who decided 
not to cooperate with the Department 
of Justice inspector general in his re-
port on the FISA abuse. He decided not 
to show up for his deposition that had 
been previously scheduled. Having just 
explained that in my opening state-
ment, I would like to read the next 
part, which describes the duplicity and 
the hypocrisy of the Democrats. 
I said: The most recent example of 
this hypocrisy was a letter and classi-
fied addendum created by senior Demo-
cratic leaders that accused Senator 
GRASSLEY and me— 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Chair will remind Senators that rule 
XIX provides that ‘‘[N]o Senator in de-
bate shall, directly or indirectly, by 
any form of words impute to another 
Senator or to other Senators any con-
duct or motive unworthy or unbecom-
ing a Senator.’’ 
Mr. 
JOHNSON. 
I 
appreciate 
the 
warning. I don’t think I did that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is recognized. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Let me continue. 
The most recent example is a letter 
and classified addendum created by 
senior Democratic leaders that accused 
Senator GRASSLEY and me of relying on 
foreign disinformation. This ‘‘intel-
ligence product,’’ which was full of 
false allegations, was produced, classi-
fied, and then leaked to the press more 
than a week before Senator GRASSLEY 
or I were given access to it. Many in 
the media dutifully reported this hot 
tip. Democrats then used those media 
reports to repeat, distort, and embel-
lish the false charges. This coordinated 
smear—and that is what you have to 
call it. It is a coordinated smear which 
continues today on the floor of the 
Senate—culminated in an August 7 
opinion piece in the Washington Post 
submitted 
by 
Senator 
RICHARD 
BLUMENTHAL. 
But John Ratcliffe, the Director of 
National Intelligence, wrote: 
I can confirm the IC did not create the 
classified addendum to the 13 July letter, nor 
did we authorize its [release]. 
The foreign information we were 
falsely accused of receiving—we have a 
misprint here. 
The foreign information we were 
falsely accused of receiving utilized— 
purportedly comes from a Ukrainian 
named Andriy Derkach, who has since 
been sanctioned by the Treasury De-
partment. Although neither Senator 
GRASSLEY nor I ever sought, received, 
or used any information from Mr. 
Derkach, the media has continued to 
report otherwise for weeks, despite our 
repeated and unequivocal denials. 
But it is true that a chart produced 
by Mr. Derkach is now part of our in-
vestigatory record, not because of me 
or Senator GRASSLEY but because Sen-
ator PETERS’ staff introduced it into 
the record. 
So as was the case in the 2016 elec-
tion, the only foreign disinformation 
being used to interfere in this inves-
tigation has been introduced by Demo-
crats against Republicans and not by 
Republicans. 
Given all the concerns expressed by 
Democrats over foreign disinformation, 
it is notable that we have not heard 
the same concern over disclosure of the 
Steele 
dossier 
containing 
Russian 
disinformation. We are aware of this 
fact because, during the course of this 
investigation, my chief counsel uncov-
ered it buried in four classified foot-
notes to the Department of Justice in-
spector general FISA report. We also 
know the FBI was aware of this as 
early as 2016. Think about that. The 
FBI knew that Russian disinformation 
was contained in the Steele dossier as 
early as August of 2016. Yet they con-
tinued the investigation, and that in-
vestigation spilled over into a special 
counsel and disrupted America’s Gov-
ernment and politics for years. 
We also note that the Steele dossier 
was bought and paid for by the DNC 
and 
Clinton 
campaign. 
Apparently, 
Democrats are willing to look the 
other way when they pay for or use 
disinformation against Republicans. 
That is what I read in my opening 
statement at our business meeting ear-
lier today. 
As I look at this resolution, the last 
‘‘whereas’’ talks about a congressional 
investigation that alleges the same dis-
credited claims by Derkach. I don’t 
know who Derkach is. As I said earlier, 
Senator GRASSLEY and I have repeat-
edly, unequivocally, denied we did not 
solicit; we did not accept; we did not 
receive 
any 
information 
from 
Mr. 
Derkach whatsoever. Yet Democrats 
persist in pushing this false allegation. 
As a matter of fact, I am not sure our 
committee has alleged anything yet. 
About the only thing that I have al-
leged is the glaring and obvious con-
flict of interest. 
I have to step back here. I just have 
to give a little history about Ukraine. 
In February of 2014, Ukrainians, coura-
geous Ukrainians—basically two fac-
tions: one that wanted to integrate 
closer to the West and the younger 
Ukrainians who wanted to rid them-
selves of the corruption of the Soviet 
legacy—joined together in massive pro-
test on the Maidan. Approximately, 
February 20, 21, over 80 Ukrainians 
were slaughtered by snipers protesting 
to rid Ukraine of corruption and in-
crease their ties to the West. 
Less than 2 months later—and I have 
asked my colleagues: Is there any 
disinformation here? Is this anything 
from Russian sources? Two months 
later, here are the series of events that 
occurred. 
On April 16, 2014, Vice President 
Biden met with his son’s business part-
ner, Devon Archer, at the White House. 
That is kind of a big deal—anybody 
meeting with the Vice President at the 
White House. Hunter Biden’s business 
partner got to do that. 
Five days later, Vice President Biden 
visited Ukraine. The media described 
him as the public face of the adminis-
tration’s handling of Ukraine. The next 
day, April 22, Archer joined the board 
of Burisma. 
Again, Burisma is this company that 
is owned by what George Kent from the 
State Department called an ‘‘odious 
oligarch,’’ Mykola Zlochevsky. It is 
hard to say Ukrainian names.

September 16, 2020 
Six days later, after Archer joined 
the board, British officials seized $23 
million from the London bank ac-
counts of Burisma’s owner, Mykola 
Zlochevsky. Fifteen days later, on May 
13, Hunter Biden joined the board of 
Burisma. And over the course of the 
next, approximately, 4 to 5 years, Hun-
ter and his firms were paid more than 
$3 million for his and Archer’s board 
participation. 
Again, 
Ukraine 
had 
just 
gone 
through a revolution. Their leadership 
was desperate for U.S. support. We all 
have to believe that Mr. Zlochevsky, 
an odious oligarch, would have made 
those Ukrainian officials well aware of 
the fact that the son of the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, the public 
face of the administration’s handling of 
Ukraine, was sitting on his board. 
So what kind of signal did that send 
to Ukrainians who were trying to stand 
up and were being pressured by U.S. of-
ficials to rid their country of corrup-
tion? It basically said: If you want U.S. 
support, don’t touch Burisma. 
The fact is, when all was said and 
done, Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky 
were never held to account. The inves-
tigation, the prosecution of him was 
ceased. It never occurred. 
In terms of Russian disinformation, 
these false charges, these wild claims 
against me and Senator GRASSLEY—I 
was way ahead of the curve when it 
came to Russian disinformation. Back 
in 2015, as chairman of the European 
Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, I held three 
hearings focusing on what Russia does 
to destabilize the politics in coun-
tries—an attempted coup in Monte-
negro and other places in Eastern Eu-
rope. So I am well aware of what Rus-
sia is doing—well aware. I don’t con-
done it. I condemn it. I am not having 
any part of pushing it. 
But I have to say, for all the croco-
dile tears the Democrats shed in terms 
of Russian disinformation, the effects 
on our politics, I would argue that the 
Russian disinformation that has been 
perpetrated on our politics and the ef-
fect it has on the election pales in com-
parison to the false allegations, for ex-
ample, that Russia colluded with the 
Trump campaign. It was promoted by 
Democrats for years, culminating in a 
special counsel and finally an impeach-
ment. But how Democrats have used 
and how the media has promoted and 
carried the water for Democrats all 
this time has had a far greater effect, 
by orders of magnitude, in terms of de-
stabilization and affecting the politics 
and affecting the elections. That is ba-
sically the truth. 
I would just ask my colleagues and I 
would ask the American public to take 
a look at what has really been hap-
pening here. The false allegations, the 
basic playbook the Democrats engage 
in, time and again, create a false nar-
rative, create a false intelligence prod-
uct, accuse the other side of things 
that you are doing tenfold. That is 
what is happening here. 
I, personally, am tired of it. As a re-
sult, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
very disappointed that my colleague 
has objected. 
I just want to make a brief response 
reflecting on my role as a senior mem-
ber of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence. Again, as I indicated ear-
lier, I can’t get into anything classified 
or sources and methods, but before we 
leave this subject, I just want to re-
mind the Senate that the Russian 
disinformation campaign is going on 
now. It is not some abstract issue. The 
Russian disinformation campaign is 
going on now. 
The Russians have attempted to re-
write the history of the 2016 campaign. 
It is the conclusion of the intelligence 
community—this is not Democrats; it 
is not Republicans; it is the intel-
ligence community—that they are try-
ing to interfere again, this time in the 
2020 election, including with these at-
tacks on Vice President Biden, and 
they are saying this now. And active 
Russian agents, like Mr. Derkach, ap-
parently are having press conferences. 
I heard a report that he may have had 
one today. 
So Members of the Senate—again, 
this is a matter of public record—have 
been presented with specific warnings 
about these Kremlin-backed conspir-
acies and lies again and again, includ-
ing in classified settings. As I wrap this 
up, I would only ask that Members of 
this great institution reflect on that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, a 
quick response because in my other 
paper here, I did not have the full 
quote from John Ratcliffe. I would like 
to read it now. 
This is referring to the intelligence 
product that senior Democratic leaders 
created, leaked to the press, accusing 
Senator GRASSLEY and I, falsely, of re-
ceiving 
information 
from 
Andriy 
Derkach. 
John Ratcliffe, Director of National 
Intelligence, wrote: 
I can confirm the IC did not create the 
classified addendum to the 13 July letter, nor 
did we authorize its creation. The IC was not 
consulted prior to its creation and subse-
quent release to the entire membership of 
the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Then, referring to that addendum, he 
said it ‘‘by no means reflects the full 
and complete analysis of the IC.’’ 
I would ask unanimous consent to 
enter into the RECORD an article that 
was published today by John Solomon 
talking about the extensive—exten-
sive—contacts 
by 
members 
of 
the 
Obama administration in terms of the 
NSC and the State Department and the 
Ambassador with Andriy Telizhenko. It 
is right here. 
We have a nice picture of House 
Member ELLIOT ENGEL as well. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEMOCRATS HAD EXTENSIVE CONTACT WITH 
UKRAINIAN THEY NOW USE FOR ‘RED SCARE’ 
ATTACK ON GOP 
(By John Solomon) 
September 16, 2020—2:30pm 
For months, Democrats on Capitol Hill 
have waged a whisper campaign to disparage 
the reputation of a former Ukrainian govern-
ment official named Andrii Telizhenko, who 
has emerged as a fact witness for Repub-
licans investigating the controversial busi-
ness deals of Joe Biden’s son Hunter. 
Led by Sens. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.) and Gary 
Peters (D–Mich.), the Democrats have tried 
to 
suggest—without 
evidence—that 
Telizhenko is connected to Ukrainian Par-
liamentary member Andrii Derkach, identi-
fied by U.S. intelligence as leading Russian 
disinformation efforts targeting Joe Biden in 
the 2020 election and sanctioned by the 
Trump Treasury Department. 
Their campaign will break into the open 
Wednesday on the Senate floor when Demo-
crats try to force a vote on a resolution 
criticizing Senate Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron John-
son (R–Wisc.) suggesting the probe he and 
Senate 
Finance 
Committee 
chairman 
Charles Grassley (R–Iowa) are leading into 
the Bidens’ Ukraine dealings is part of 
Derkach’s election meddling. Their argu-
ment is thin, relying on the fact that 
Telizhenko has talked publicly about some 
of the same issues as Derkach. Their resolu-
tion is likely to fail in the GOP-controlled 
Senate. 
But the Democrats’ character-assassina-
tion campaign suffers a much bigger prob-
lem: Long before he assisted the GOP Senate 
investigation, Telizhenko was a trusted mid- 
level Ukrainian government contact for the 
Obama-Biden administration, according to 
scores of U.S. government emails and memos 
obtained by Just the News. 
The memos show Telizhenko routinely ar-
ranged sensitive meetings for senior State 
Department officials at the U.S. embassy in 
Kiev, met with senior Democrats on Capitol 
Hill, including current House Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D–N.Y.), 
and facilitated contacts with Ukrainians for 
the National Security Council and the U.S. 
Justice Department in Washington dating to 
2013. He also was cleared for meetings inside 
the Obama White House, Secret Service 
entry logs show. 
His contacts included such senior State of-
ficials as William Taylor and Geoffrey Pyatt, 
two ambassadors, the memos show. 
In another words, the man the Democrats 
are now using for a ‘‘red scare’’ attack on the 
GOP senators was actually their own party’s 
Ukrainian contact, vetted and cleared by the 
State Department to meet with senior offi-
cials like ambassadors and DOJ prosecutors 
on sensitive foreign matters. 
Telizhenko also was hired by the Demo-
cratic-leaning firm known as Blue Star 
Strategies to help Burisma Holdings—the 
Ukrainian gas firm that hired Hunter Biden 
as a board member in 2014—lobby the State 
Department and Ukrainian prosecutors to 
drop corruption allegations against the com-
pany in 2016, the memos show. 
Telizhenko, in fact, was so trusted and fa-
miliar with Obama administration officials 
that he was on a first-name basis, trading 
smiley face emoticons and arranging coffee 
and beer outings in Washington with such 
contacts as Obama-era National Security 
Council staffer Elisabeth Zentos, the memos 
show.

‘‘Hi Andrii! I’m doing ok. Yes, definitely 
got some rest over the weekend. How about 
you?’’ 
Zentos 
wrote 
April 
4, 
2016 
to 
Telizhenko from her official White House 
email account. ‘‘Survive the visit ok? Also, 
should we still plan for coffee this week? 
Maybe Wednesday or Friday? Hope all is 
well! Liz.’’ 
A month earlier, a planned beer outing 
with Zentos got changed. ‘‘Would you be up 
for doing coffee instead of beer though? I’m 
realizing that if I drink beer at 3 p.m., I will 
probably fall asleep while attempting to 
work afterward,’’ Zentos wrote. 
Zentos and Telizhenko also discussed the 
sensitive case of Burisma and its founder, 
Mykola Zlochevsky, in a July 2016 email ex-
change with the subject line ‘‘Re: Z,’’ the 
shorthand Telizhenko used to refer to the 
Burisma founder. Their email exchange did 
not mention Hunter Biden’s role in the com-
pany but showed the Obama White House 
had interest in the business dealings of Hun-
ter Biden’s boss. 
‘‘Hi Liz, Yes, It would be great to meet, to-
morrow whatever works best for you 12:30pm 
or 6pm—I am ready,’’ Telizhenko wrote the 
NSC staffer, adding a smiley face. Zentos 
eventually replied when he suggested a res-
taurant: ‘‘Ooh, that would be wonderful— 
thanks so much!’’ 
Attached to Telizhenko’s email was an org

point to Zlochevsky’s business empire. 
The memos show Zentos first befriended 
Telizhenko when she worked at the U.S. em-
bassy as far back as 2014. 
The memos show that officials at the 
Obama Justice Department, the NSC, and 
the State Department enlisted Telizhenko 
for similarly sensitive diplomatic matters 
dating to 2013 including: 
Arranging for senior members of the 
Ukraine Prosecutor General’s Office to trav-
el to Washington in January 2016 to meet 
with NSC, State, DOJ and FBI officials to 
discuss ongoing corruption cases. At the 
time, the Ukraine prosecutors had an esca-
lating corruption probe of Burisma, where 
Hunter Biden served on the board. Within 
weeks of the Washington meeting, Vice 
President Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine’s 
president Petro Poroshenko to fire the lead 
prosecutor, Viktor Shakin. 
Securing a meeting in February 2015 at the 
U.S. embassy in Kiev with a deputy Ukrain-
ian prosecutor whom U.S. officials wanted to 
confront about a bribe allegedly paid by 
Burisma. 
Facilitating a draft statement in Novem-
ber 2013 from members of the Ukrainian par-
liament to President Obama denouncing 
then-Ukrainian 
President 
Viktor 
Yanukovych, whom the Obama administra-
tion would help oust from power a few weeks 
later. 
‘‘We, people of Ukraine, appeal to you with 
request to support Ukrainian people in their 
standing for freedom, justice and democ-
racy,’’ the November 2013 draft statement 
from Telizhenko to the U.S. embassy in Kiev 
read. ‘‘The President of Ukraine Viktor 
Yanukovych proved that he is not the guar-
antor of constitutional rights and freedoms 
of citizens, freedom of choice and right for 
free expression.’’ 
The draft statement was fielded by a mili-
tary attache at the U.S. embassy who urged 
Telizhenko to get it to the embassy’s polit-
ical section for consideration. ‘‘The ambas-
sador has not shared with me what the posi-
tion of the US government would be on such 
a statement, other than his message yester-
day morning,’’ the attache wrote. ‘‘. . . I’m 
sure once you pass this statement to Ambas-
sador Pyatt’s political section, they will 
render a timely response.’’ 
Photos taken by U.S. and Ukrainian gov-
ernment photographers show Telizhenko fa-
cilitated meetings between 2014 and 2016 with 
key lawmakers in Washington, including 
Democrat Reps. Engel and Marcy Kaptur and 
then-GOP Sen. Bob Corker, as well as other 
U.S. agencies. 
And the emails show U.S. embassy officials 
in Kiev routinely sought advice and insights 
from Telizhenko about happenings inside the 
Ukrainian government. ‘‘Andriy, we have 
heard that there may be a briefing today. Do 
you know the specifics?’’ embassy political 
officer Stephen Page asked in a January 2014 
email. 
Such contacts are normal in the diplomacy 
and national security business of the United 
States. But they take on significance now 
because they have been missing from the 
Democrats’ attacks on Telizhenko and the 
GOP senators who have interviewed him in 
their probe of the Bidens. The question now 
is: If Telizhenko is so bad as Democrats 
claim, why did the Obama administration 
and Democrats so frequently engage him? 
Sen. Wyden’s recent statement ignored 
that issue. ‘‘While Democrats are pushing for 
more aggressive action against Russian as-
sets interfering in our elections, Republicans 
are using their conspiracy theories to ad-
vance bogus investigations,’’ he said. 
U.S. intelligence officials tell Just the 
News that while they remain vigilant in 
fighting Russian interference in the 2020 
election, they have no direct evidence 
Telizhenko is, like Derkach, connected to 
the Kremlin. However, they have extensive 
evidence he was welcomed by the U.S. gov-
ernment during the Obama years and that he 
assisted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s probe 
of legal matters in Ukraine, including find-
ing political dirt last year on the Bidens. 
The officials also noted there is open 
source intelligence that Telizhenko actually 
engaged in a rivalry in the Ukrainian press 
with Derkach and derided the Ukrainian par-
liamentary member as a Russian operative 
just a few months ago. The open source in-
formation 
includes 
a 
BuzzFeed 
article 
quoting Telizhenko and social media posts, 
the officials said. 
Ukraine is a country with much corruption 
and many mysterious characters. But one 
thing is clear: U.S. government memos cor-
roborate Andrii Telizhenko was trusted by 
the Obama administration for many years 
before congressional Democrats turned on 
him. 
Mr. JOHNSON. The same person they 
are saying is just this dangerous Rus-
sian agent, they were using extensively 
throughout the Obama administration 
to set up contacts. He actually had the 
ability to go to meetings in the White 
House, and he attended those. This is 
the person whom now they are saying, 
because we spoke to him and got a lit-
tle bit of information from him, we are 
dealing in Russian disinformation. 
If they had that level of concern, why 
did Democratic lobbying firm Blue 
Star Strategies employ him for over a 
year, and why did Democrats deal with 
him so frequently during the Obama 
administration? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
CRIME 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, as we all 
know and as any American who has 
watched the news over the summer 
knows, there has been a terrible in-
crease in crime in America’s cities. As-
saults, shootings, murders have been 
higher this year, and my home State 
has not been safe from this trend. In 
fact, in St. Louis, MO, there were 55 
murders in the month of July. That 
compares to 22 murders a year earlier 
in July, which we thought were way 
too many then. In Kansas City, MO, 
homicides in the first 6 months of this 
year were about 40 percent higher than 
they were last year. 
One of the Kansas City victims was a 
4-year-old 
boy 
named 
LeGend 
Taliferro. He was murdered in the early 
hours of July 29 while he was asleep— 
a 4-year-old boy murdered while he was 
asleep—by a random shooting, violence 
going on outside his home. So early in 
July, the Justice Department launched 
an effort in Kansas City that has be-
come a national effort, which they 
called Operation LeGend, named for 
little LeGend Taliferro. Under Oper-
ation LeGend, Federal law enforcement 
officers are working alongside local po-
lice to solve crimes, to make arrests, 
to track down fugitives, and to prepare 
cases for trial so criminals can be held 
accountable. The key phrase there is 
‘‘alongside.’’ 
Federal 
agents 
aren’t 
going in and taking over the police de-
partment; they are going in to add as-
sistance to the police department. 
On that topic, there was no imme-
diate raid of trafficking centers or drug 
gangs or anything like that. I, frankly, 
thought the Justice Department was 
wrong in not announcing earlier to 
Federal officials and local officials 
what they were going to do and when 
they were going to do it, but I think we 
worked with them to see that that isn’t 
going to continue to be the case. In 
fact, in early August, they made a 
similar determination to go into St. 
Louis. 
One of the advantages of having Fed-
eral officers work with the local police 
in these cases is, one, they bring a 
whole lot more intensity to the mo-
ment. With the extra help, suddenly 
something 
becomes 
possible 
that 
wasn’t possible before. Also, many of 
the people arrested can face Federal 
charges as well as other sentences. 
Certainly in our State—in Kansas 
City and Missouri both—the two dif-
ferent U.S. attorney’s offices have done 
a great job working with local officials 
before this but are even better able to 
look at what Federal charges might be 
faced to take some of that load off the 
local prosecutor and also look for an-
other way to get these people off the 
street. 
By September 1, in Kansas City, the 
operation had led to the arrest of 355 
people suspected of serious crimes in 
Kansas City. More than 100 of those 355 
people have been charged in Federal 
court. In St. Louis, where I said before 
that the government decided to bring 
Operation LeGend—the Justice Depart-
ment made that decision in early Au-
gust, and by September 1, there were 
already 359 arrests, and 128 of those 
people arrested were looking at Fed-
eral charges as well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5632 
September 16, 2020 
In addition to St. Louis and Kansas 
City, the Department of Justice has 
launched Operation LeGend in seven 
other cities. This is not a Federal over-
reach. It is not the Federal Govern-
ment, again, taking over local law en-
forcement. It is not the first step to-
ward martial law. It is not a crack-
down on peaceful protests. What it is, 
is a cooperative effort with cities that 
have been suffering from increases in 
violent crime. 
Under this operation, officers have 
arrested, nationwide, more than 2,000 
people, including 163 people for murder, 
and one of the people arrested was the 
alleged killer of 4-year-old LeGend 
Taliferro. 
The rise of violence in cities this 
year—and particularly the cities I am 
talking about that have benefited, I 
think, from Operation LeGend—has 
been incredibly rapid and unbearably 
destructive, not to mention totally un-
acceptable. It has taken a toll on lives 
unlived, families torn apart, commu-
nities 
terrorized, 
people 
wondering 
what is going to happen when they or 
their children walk out the front door 
or play in the backyard or, like little 
LeGend, are sound asleep in their beds. 
Nothing we do can fully heal the 
damage, certainly, that these victims 
of violent crime and their families 
have suffered, but we can get the jus-
tice that both the victim and people 
who care about them deserve. 
We may have a lot of disagreements 
in the Congress, but I hope we can 
agree that violent criminals belong be-
hind bars. I hope we can all agree that 
all parents deserve a safe neighborhood 
where they can raise their children. I 
hope we can all agree that the police do 
a difficult and dangerous job, and they 
deserve all the support and apprecia-
tion we can give them. 
Not long ago, LeGend Taliferro’s 
mother spoke about her son and the 
pain of losing him. She said: ‘‘He was a 
ball of joy, and I want his legacy to 
live on and I want us to continue to 
fight against violence and get justice 
for my son and others.’’ That is the end 
of that mother’s quote, but it is not the 
end of a life that mother will now live 
without her son or the life he didn’t get 
to live. And there are too many lives 
that didn’t get to be lived, too many 
lives lost through needless violence. 
Operation LeGend gives local law en-
forcement the valuable support they 
need to get violent criminals off the 
street. Again, it was named for an in-
nocent 4-year-old boy. It could have 
been named for any of the thousands of 
other victims of violent criminals in 
dozens of other cities this year. It 
could have been named for St. Louis 
Police Officer Tamarris Bohannon, who 
was killed in the line of duty last 
month. It could have been named for 
the two officers in California who had a 
sneak attack as they were sitting and 
trying to secure the local transpor-
tation center just in the last couple of 
days. It is a tragedy that it had to be 
named for anyone. 
While some people have sought to 
defund the police and to disparage the 
police, Operation LeGend is successful 
because it supports the police. These 
are some of the hardest jobs in Amer-
ica, second only to the families of peo-
ple who care deeply about their loved 
ones who have decided to serve in that 
job to protect us all. 
American communities are safer be-
cause of Operation LeGend. They will 
be safer as we continue to work toward 
greater and more effective community 
policing. They will be safer when peo-
ple who are violent criminals are no 
longer walking around to perpetuate 
further violence. 
I salute the Justice Department for 
their efforts and the local departments 
that have reached out and taken ad-
vantage of the moment to get some-
thing done that they were not able to 
get done by themselves. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
when I was growing up, I was raised to 
believe in the American dream. My 
mom taught me that we were blessed 
because God and our Founders created 
the greatest country ever, where any-
thing was possible. We weren’t allowed 
to complain. Debt, Big Government, so-
cialism, and communism were bad. Col-
lege was for a better paying job. 
Church on Sundays was absolutely not 
optional. 
While I didn’t always appreciate my 
tough-love, 
my-way-or-the-highway 
mom growing up, I now thank God 
every day for my mom and this coun-
try. She gave me the opportunity to 
experience every lesson this country 
had to offer before I was 20. 
Sadly, the values that I grew up with 
are becoming a way of the past, but I 
believe these values, these virtues, can 
and should be part of our country’s fu-
ture. The left has worked hard over the 
last 50 years to discredit the values of 
the America I was raised with and the 
values of the America I want my 
grandkids to grow up with. 
In recent weeks, we have seen the 
Democrats try hard to paint our Presi-
dent and the entire Republican Party 
as ‘‘darkness,’’ but let me tell you 
what darkness would actually look like 
in America. 
What if our country turned the keys 
over to the far left and turned away 
from capitalism in favor of socialism? 
The data is already in on that. The re-
sult would be the same as it has been 
throughout history: Socialism would 
destroy our economy and cause wide-
spread poverty and oppression. Dark-
ness. 
What if our country just gave up on 
the battle to protect innocent human 
life and agreed with the political party 
that proudly embraces the killing of 
the unborn at any time, for any rea-
son? Darkness. 
What if we decide to change our First 
Amendment, editing out our freedom of 
speech and freedom of religion, forcing 
Christians and Jews to retreat from 
the public square and silencing any 
who dare to speak up? Darkness. 
What if America did what every au-
thoritarian government in history has 
done and must eventually do—disarm 
the American people? Darkness. 
What if we defunded our police forces 
across the country, even just partially? 
What would happen to public safety? 
How would life in our cities be af-
fected? Turn on your TV for the an-
swer. Darkness. 
What if we allowed people to throw 
homemade bombs at police and burn 
down police stations and then pre-
tended that these violent demonstra-
tions are peaceful? Darkness. 
What if we enacted the Green New 
Deal? Literal darkness. 
What if we let China—a Communist 
country that systematically imprisons 
and murders its own citizens—take ad-
vantage of American workers and put 
them out of work? Darkness. 
What if we teach our kids that Amer-
ica is a bad country with an evil his-
tory that must be erased and that 
America is fundamentally a morally 
bankrupt country? Darkness. 
Republicans are fighting for issues 
that the American public care about. 
People want good jobs, a good edu-
cation for their kids, and they want to 
live in safe communities. Republicans 
are working to defend our law enforce-
ment, invest in our military, secure 
the border, and stop illegal immigra-
tion. Republicans are standing up to 
dictators in Latin America and to 
Communist China, after the Democrats 
have appeased them for decades. 
Here is the fundamental difference 
between Democrats and Republicans: 
Democrats want to control your life; 
Republicans want to give you a life. 
Republicans want to give every Amer-
ican the opportunity to live their 
version of the American dream. Gov-
ernments don’t do that. Politicians 
don’t do that. 
The American people are dreamers, 
and if we get government out of their 
way, the innovation, determination, 
and entrepreneurial spirit of the Amer-
ican people and American business will 
shine bright. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the dangerous path 
that national Democrats are spiraling 
on down and to caution our country-
men not to follow them. Radicals on 
the far left have hijacked an otherwise 
righteous cause and are in command of 
a once proud political party that traces 
its heritage back to Jefferson and 
Madison. 
The violence the radicals have un-
leashed threatens lives. The cancel cul-
ture they imposed curtails liberty. And 
their misguided means of creating eco-
nomic equality endangers the pursuit 
of happiness. 
Joe Biden, NANCY PELOSI, and their 
hand-picked Democratic candidates are

empowering the radical wing of today’s 
national Democratic Party—the same 
people responsible for the chaos now on 
full display across our country. The na-
tional leaders of the Democratic Party 
offer them sanctuary. 
They make excuses for radicals’ de-
structive behavior, the way an embar-
rassed parent does for a mischievous 
child. To them, the riots that are oc-
curring from Minneapolis to Indianap-
olis are only peaceful protests. Prom-
ises to defund police departments are 
just ways of reimaging police—what-
ever that means. It is the same sleight 
of hand that turns government-run 
healthcare into Medicare for all who 
want it. 
Most Democrats will not publicly 
embrace the socialist policies the mob 
howls for because they know the Amer-
ican people will not buy it. But once in 
power, they will be all too happy to im-
plement these radical policies, and 
that means a mainstream national 
Democratic agenda that will abolish 
and defund police departments; take 
away on-the-job insurance; pack the 
Supreme Court of the United States; 
raise taxes; give Washington, DC, and 
Puerto Rico the same number of U.S. 
Senators that the State of Indiana has; 
eliminate the legislative filibuster and, 
therefore, the right of the minority 
within this institution; and spend tril-
lions of dollars of new government pro-
grams that Americans don’t need or 
want. 
They are allies—the destroyers and 
these national Democrats I reference— 
only they can’t be straight with the 
American people about their alliance, 
and their leaders just can’t seem to 
summon the simple moral clarity that 
says racism is evil and so is using it to 
justify violence and vandalism. 
Blessedly, in my State, local Demo-
cratic 
elected 
officials 
have 
had 
enough. In fact, in recent weeks, sev-
eral Hoosier public servants have left 
their party and they have become Re-
publicans. To clearly understand the 
choice before us, we need only listen to 
their explanations why. 
This is Brian Snedecor, mayor of Ho-
bart, who just switched from a Demo-
crat to a Republican. He says: 
I must be true to my God, my family, my-
self and those that have supported and be-
lieved in me . . . I want Hobart to be a place 
for business to come and the American 
Dream to be achieved. 
And then we have Dave Wedding, 
Vanderburgh County sheriff, who also 
just became a Republican. Sheriff Wed-
ding says: 
I’m tired of seeing fires set in our streets. 
I’m tired of people defying God, our church, 
our police, our government and everything 
we stand for. 
I happen to believe that every reg-
ular American feels the same way, and 
they will look to us to protect the 
American Dream and put out the 
fires—literal and figurative—in our 
streets. 
The choice that each of us must 
make in the coming weeks is pretty 
darned clear: law and order or anarchy; 
an economy that is growing or employ-
ers and workers which are grounded; 
citizens who are free and flourishing or 
subjects dependent on government. 
What the radicals don’t understand is 
that though we were born by revolu-
tion, the history of America is one of 
steady progress—a determined march 
together for the common good and to-
wards an ever better union. We have to 
lead that march. 
When far-left Democrats offer dan-
gerous ideas and unfulfillable promises, 
Republicans will counter with innova-
tive thinking and results-driven poli-
cies. We will create ways to help every 
American access affordable healthcare, 
afford a college education, advance 
their careers, raise a family, and buy a 
home that they can call their own. 
Republicans will play a part in the 
reinvigoration of economically dis-
advantaged 
areas, 
both 
rural 
and 
urban. Ours is an America where every-
one lives free of fear and is able to 
speak their mind, and where citizens, 
no matter their color or their ZIP 
Code, can climb as high and fly as far 
as their ambition and ability allows. 
Their way leads to a dead end, ours 
to an endless frontier. They tear down. 
We will build. The path forward is 
clear. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank my colleagues for joining 
me on the floor today. It is clear that 
America is facing two separate, very 
different paths. 
Last Thursday, the Democrats in this 
Chamber blocked much needed assist-
ance to families and small businesses 
struggling to make ends meet amidst 
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and 
they did it for one reason only—poli-
tics. Our friends across the aisle didn’t 
want to provide $15 billion in childcare, 
more than $250 billion of additional 
Paycheck Protection Program loans 
for small businesses, $105 billion for 
schools, and $20 billion for farmers. 
While this aid is vital to my fellow 
Iowans, it would have helped families 
and communities all across the Nation, 
in red and blue States. There is no de-
nying that the damage being caused by 
this pandemic is real. Businesses are 
being shut down, schools are being 
closed, and lives are being lost. Yet 
this toll is apparently not enough for 
the other side to set politics aside, 
even momentarily, to come together 
and help our fellow citizens with their 
daily struggles. 
This senseless obstruction is leaving 
Iowa families to fend for themselves 
when they most need a helping hand. 
In so many ways, this represents the 
distinct difference between the two po-
litical parties at this very moment. 
While Senate Republicans are leading 
efforts to get America back up and run-
ning and guarantee opportunities for 
everyone, Democrats are embracing ob-
struction and anarchy. 
Following the murder of George 
Floyd by Minneapolis police, my friend 
Senator TIM SCOTT of South Carolina 
introduced legislation to tackle police 
reform in a meaningful way. The bill 
he proposed would have enacted long 
overdue policies, such as finally mak-
ing lynching a Federal crime, ending 
the use of police choke holds, expand-
ing the use of body cameras by law en-
forcement, and increasing other forms 
of transparency and accountability. 
Yet despite the impassioned pleas of 
Americans across the country demand-
ing justice for George Floyd and other 
African-Americans who have died in 
police custody, Democrats blocked the 
Senate from even debating Senator 
SCOTT’s thoughtful police reform bill 
this past summer. 
Shouldn’t we all be able to agree, re-
gardless of our party affiliation, that 
Congress needs to take action to guar-
antee that no American should fear 
walking on the streets, especially in 
their own neighborhood? That guar-
antee should include people of color 
and peaceful protesters, as well as our 
law enforcement officers doing their 
jobs. 
As a consequence of the Democrats’ 
obstruction, the streets in some of 
America’s great cities have descended 
into a state of chaos and lawlessness, 
immersed in violence and vandalism, 
arson and murder. 
When taxpayers turn to their elected 
leaders—whether for assistance to pro-
vide for their families during a pan-
demic, for protection from unfair polic-
ing practices, or for simple safety when 
walking down the street—the Demo-
crats have responded with silence and 
inaction. 
Even when I attempted to call up a 
bill 
to 
reauthorize 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act—a bill that is very 
personal to me and that also had bipar-
tisan support—the Democrats objected 
to that bill as well. And the same was 
true for my commonsense bill, Sarah’s 
Law, which would hold illegal immi-
grants who harm or murder an Amer-
ican citizen accountable. 
It is no wonder that folks across this 
country are so frustrated with Wash-
ington and fed up with politicians. 
Folks, just one friendly reminder: Our 
country’s direction will soon be decided 
by her people. America must now 
choose between two paths to take into 
the future, and that choice could not 
be starker. 
At a time when we need leadership 
and reassurance, the Democrats are in-
stead offering obstruction, lockdowns, 
and anarchy. Our friends across the 
aisle are actually promising—folks, 
they are promising—to increase taxes 
on hardworking Americans and even 
promising to defund the police. That is 
right, folks. You get to pay more taxes 
in exchange for less safety and secu-
rity. That doesn’t sound like a good 
deal to me. 
Speaking of bad bargains, you can ex-
pect the Democrats to pass their Green 
New Deal if they are given the chance.

S5634 
September 16, 2020 
This radical environmental plan would 
destroy our very way of life in Iowa. 
The roadmap offered by Republicans 
is much brighter, to say the least: re-
opening America safely; real reforms 
to end excessive use of force by police 
without putting the safety of everyone 
at risk by defunding the police; build-
ing upon the successful pro-growth 
policies that created the greatest econ-
omy and historically low unemploy-
ment rates for every demographic; and 
bringing the jobs that were exported 
under 
the 
previous 
administration 
back to America and ending our de-
pendency on foreign nations like Red 
China. 
Folks, with our country and the 
world facing one of the greatest health 
and economic emergencies in history, 
we simply cannot risk our recovery on 
the radical designs of the Democrats. 
Let’s pursue the path towards a re-
newed United States of America that 
guarantees safety and greater opportu-
nities for every citizen to pursue the 
American dream.

quest in a moment, but I would like to 
preface it by saying what it is about so 
that as we explain it after the unani-
mous consent request is objected to, it 
will be clearer. 
In the nation of Venezuela, there ex-
ists today an incredible political situa-
tion. I have been there to see it. There 
is a dictator in charge, and life on the 
street is deadly—so deadly that mil-
lions of Venezuelans are fleeing the 
country as fast as possible. 
There is a limitation on food and 
medicine. There is so much suffering 
and starvation and deprivation that 
these people have given up everything, 
and they are just leaving. The United 
States knows that this is under the 
leader, Maduro. It reached a point 
where it is physically dangerous—so 
much so that we have a warning to 
American travelers not to go to Ven-
ezuela, to stay away because it is too 
dangerous. 
Yet thousands of Venezuelans now in 
the United States are facing the threat 
of being forced return to this deadly, 
dangerous situation. The same State 
Department that warns Americans not 
to travel to Venezuela is now trying to 
force those Venezuelans who are here 
as students and others to go back to 
this deadly situation. 
Senator MENENDEZ and I and others 
think it just makes sense for us to give 
these people a shelter until it is safe 
for them to return to their home. That 
is what this request is about. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Judiciary Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 549 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time 
passed and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. THUNE. Reserving the right to 
object. On behalf of my colleague Sen-
ator LEE, who cannot be here to object 
on his own because he is chairing an 
Energy subcommittee hearing, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know 
the Senator from South Dakota is 
making the objection on behalf of Sen-
ator LEE, and I have been called to do 
the same thing from time to time. I 
won’t assign any political blame to 
him, but I will say this is a serious 
mistake and deadly mistake for these 
Venezuelans. 
This is an issue which in many parts 
of America is red hot. Those of Ven-
ezuelan ancestry or those who are here 
in a temporary status cannot under-
stand what just happened. They want 
to stay here safely. They don’t want to 
be forced to return to this nation that 
is such a dangerous place under this 
dictator. 
A number of times in the last year, 
Senator MENENDEZ, who is on the floor 
with me here, has joined with me on 
behalf of the Venezuelan people. Presi-
dent Trump boasts that he supports 
these people. 
The idea is simple: While the country 
remains a dictatorial nightmare, grant 
Venezuelans in the United States tem-
porary protected status or TPS. It is 
the kind of commonsense move a self- 
confident nation and one that really 
cares about humanity would do to dem-
onstrate real leadership and accept. 
TPS is a temporary immigration sta-
tus provided to foreign nationals if re-
turning to their country poses a seri-
ous threat to their safety for any vari-
ety of reasons—natural disaster, envi-
ronmental disaster, extraordinary con-
ditions, armed conflicts. Certainly by 
every objective measure, the situation 
in Venezuela today is deadly and dan-
gerous. It is not a permanent immigra-
tion status we are seeking for these 
Venezuelans, just a measure of Amer-
ican decency and solidarity with those 
who might be in the United States 
when a calamity occurs in their home 
country. Prior administrations of both 
political parties have granted it for 
people from countries facing these cir-
cumstances. 
The situation in Venezuela is dire. 
Currently, the United States is work-
ing with regional partners to foster an 
end to the disastrous dictatorship 
clinging to power in Venezuela. 
I was there before the sham 2018 elec-
tion. What I saw was heartbreaking— 
people starving and fainting at work 
from malnutrition; hospitals without 
power or basic medicines. I visited a 
Catholic children’s hospital in Caracas. 
They told me they didn’t have the ba-
sics to treat these children. Antibiotics 
and cancer drugs were unavailable. 
Millions were fleeing this country 
and still are, as refugees into neigh-
boring countries. There is brutal polit-
ical repression. If you disagree with 
Maduro publicly, be prepared to go to 
prison. There is staggering government 
corruption and dismantling of the gov-
ernment’s democracy. Now, the tragic 
impacts of coronavirus have made the 
situation worse as well. 
I supported this administration’s ef-
forts to work with other nations to 
support the interim Presidency of Juan 
Guaido. I had a chance to speak with 
President Guaido on the phone yester-
day. I am deeply moved by his courage 
and concern for the Venezuelan people 
amid the suffering. Think about what 
he is up against. Here is a man who at 
any moment could face imprisonment 
or worse. 
It is remarkable that more than 2 
years after an internationally discred-
ited Presidential election, Venezuelan 
dictator Nicolas Maduro is now plan-
ning another illegitimate election in-
stead of finally holding a fair, credible 
Presidential contest. 
I asked President Guaido: Are there 
going to be any international observers 
of this international election coming 
up this December? 
Oh, yes. 
I said: Who? 
He said: The Russians. 
I said: What a coincidence. They are 
observing our election too. 
Venezuela has tragically fallen from 
President Trump’s attention. One sim-
ple step he could take is grant TPS to 
Venezuelans here in the United States. 
He repeatedly refuses. There are travel 
warnings to Americans telling people 
not to go close to Venezuela, but for 
the Venezuelans here on visa or TPS 
status: You have to go home. The 
President has refused, I suspect, be-
cause the depth of his anti-immigrant 
cruelty really has no limits. 
Despite the chest-thumping to audi-
ences in Florida about taking on Ven-
ezuelan dictators, President Trump 
has, in fact, turned his back on the 
Venezuelans in the United States who 
truly need his protection. Nobody 
should be surprised, as former National 
Security Advisor John Bolton wrote in 
his book, that the President praised 
Maduro as ‘‘smart’’ and ‘‘tough’’ and 
waffled on any kind of coherent policy 
in the region and told Bolton not to get 
too deeply involved. President Trump 
can’t have it both ways. 
I have met many Venezuelans in my 
home State of Illinois. I can tell you 
that they are desperately 
worried 
about being forced to return to the 
chaos, violence, and hopelessness of the 
current Venezuela. 
The Trump administration’s travel 
advisory says it all: 
Do not travel due to COVID–19, crime, civil 
unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnap-
ping, arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. 
citizens . . . . Violent crime, such as homi-
cide, 
armed 
robbery, 
kidnapping, 
and 
carjacking, is common. 
Yet the Republicans come to the 
floor and object to our efforts to pro-
tect the Venezuelans who are doing

their best to avoid what I just read as 
a warning to American travelers. 
Just today, U.N. investigators re-
leased 
findings 
saying 
that 
under 
Maduro, Venezuela has ‘‘committed 
egregious violations’’ amounting to 
crimes against humanity. How can this 
President and the State Department 
possibly force people to return to Ven-
ezuela under these conditions? And 
now, with Maduro detaining returning 
refugees and calling them ‘‘bioterror-
ists,’’ the idea of going back is even 
more dangerous. 
Since the White House wouldn’t act 
more than a year ago, the House, under 
Democratic control, passed a bipar-
tisan bill granting TPS to Venezuelans 
by a margin of 272 to 158. Senator 
MENENDEZ, Senator RUBIO, and I intro-
duced a similar Senate bill, but the 
majority leader, MITCH
MCCONNELL, 
still refuses to bring up any bill that 
just 
might 
not 
please 
President 
Trump—even ones that supposedly he 
is publicly supporting. 
Senator MENENDEZ and I have tried 
to call up the House bill for passage, 
only to face objections, just as we did 
today, from Senate Republicans who 
refuse to stand up to this President’s 
failure on this and so many other for-
eign policies. 
When we brought this up last July, 
Senate Republicans objected because 
they said they wanted to debate it in 
the Judiciary Committee. Well, 12 
months passed with plenty of opportu-
nities. Our Venezuelan TPS bill was re-
ferred to the committee in February of 
2019. Yet there has been no action, no 
hearing, no markup. The Immigration 
Subcommittee is not overloaded with 
work. Under Chairman CORNYN, we 
have had exactly one subcommittee 
meeting in the past 11⁄2 years. It hasn’t 
held a single hearing this year, and the 
Senate Judiciary Committee hasn’t 
considered a single immigration bill. 
This administration could grant TPS 
without congressional action, but it re-
fuses. Senate Republicans could pass 
the bipartisan House bill to grant Ven-
ezuelans TPS, but they refuse as well. 
Let it be clear that the real failure to 
help Venezuelans in the United States 
rests on their shoulders—the President 
and the Republican majority in the 
Senate. 
The Venezuelan policy, like so many 
others with this administration and 
the Senate, is only there to serve 
President Trump and no one else. 
I made my offer in the hope that we 
could bring this matter to the floor. I 
am sorry it met an objection. I thank 
my colleagues for joining me on this 
effort. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there may be 
portions where I may say a few words 
in Spanish, and I will provide a trans-
lation for the clerk. 
I ask unanimous consent to be able 
to do that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we 
are here today once again to join Sen-
ator DURBIN, who has been on the floor 
with me or I with him I don’t know 
how many times now as it relates to 
this issue. We are here to urge the Sen-
ate to immediately approve legislation 
that would designate Venezuelans for 
temporary protected status. 
There are some 200,000 Venezuelans 
who are currently living in the United 
States. They are unable to return home 
safely, and they would benefit from 
TPS. 
We should be doing the right thing. 
We should be upholding American val-
ues and offering them protection, but 
once again, our Republican colleagues 
have blocked our efforts. 
We know what is at stake. Venezuela 
continues to experience the worst hu-
manitarian crisis in our hemisphere. 
Its people continue to suffer food and 
medicine shortages, levels of criminal 
violence akin to a conflict zone, and 
grave human rights abuses under the 
Maduro regime. As if that were not 
enough, Venezuelans face the alarming 
spread of COVID–19 with a public 
health system in ruins. 
For 7 years, Maduro’s devastating 
abuses of the Venezuelan people have 
left them with little choice but to stay 
and suffer or flee and have a chance at 
survival—flee the political persecution, 
flee the oppression. 
In 
Maduro’s 
Venezuela, 
families 
struggle to feed themselves and chil-
dren tragically die of treatable dis-
eases. More than half of all Venezuelan 
doctors have fled the country, and 40 
percent of hospitals lack electricity 
and 70 percent lack regular access to 
water. Senate Republicans want to 
leave the Venezuelans who are in the 
United States at risk of deportation 
back to Maduro’s nightmare rather 
than 
take 
action. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Maduro regime is using the spread of 
COVID–19 to further tighten its con-
trol. 
Last month, Human Rights Watch re-
ported 
that 
dozens 
of 
journalists, 
healthcare workers, human rights law-
yers, and political opponents have been 
detained or prosecuted for merely criti-
cizing or questioning the regime’s offi-
cial statistics on the pandemic. 
Take the case of Ivan Virguez, a 65- 
year-old human rights attorney who 
had expressed concern on Facebook 
about ‘‘quarantine centers’’ that had 
been set up by the regime. In response, 
police officers handcuffed him to a 
metal tube in a prison yard, under the 
Sun for 2 hours, and left him without 
access to a bathroom for over a day, 
causing him to become sick with blad-
der pain. Ivan remains under house ar-
rest and without access to his criminal 
file and no due process. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
As Senator DURBIN said, ‘‘just today, 
the United Nations released a report 
finding that Maduro’s yearslong cam-
paign of extrajudicial killings and tor-
ture amounts to crimes against hu-
manity.’’ Yet President Trump and 
Senate Republicans refuse to provide 
humanitarian 
protection 
to 
Ven-
ezuelans in the United States. 
The extraordinary conditions in Ven-
ezuela have forced more than 5 million 
Venezuelans to flee their country in 
search of protection. Last year, I trav-
eled to Cucuta, which is the border city 
between Colombia and Venezuela, and I 
saw for myself the thousands of refu-
gees and migrants who cross every day. 
I will never forget their stories—stories 
of heartbreak and suffering from peo-
ple leaving everything they have ever 
known 
behind—their 
homes, 
their 
loved ones—in an attempt to survive. 
We 
have 
applauded 
Venezuela’s 
neighbors, including Colombia, Ecua-
dor, Peru, and Brazil, for welcoming 
Venezuelan refugees and migrants de-
spite their having far fewer resources 
than the United States. Yet the Trump 
administration has failed to ensure 
that America lives up to its history as 
a beacon of freedom and hope around 
the world. 
Many Venezuelans in the United 
States today who would be eligible for 
TPS are stuck in immigration deten-
tion. The Trump administration and 
the Republican-led Senate have failed 
to grant them TPS, which leaves them 
facing uncertainty and the fear of de-
portation. Many others who have come 
from Venezuela to seek political asy-
lum have been turned back and de-
ported—back to countries like Mexico 
and with all of the risks that those bor-
der cities present. They have not even 
been given a chance to make their po-
litical asylum claims. 
So make no mistake: The Trump ad-
ministration has all of the authority it 
needs to designate Venezuela imme-
diately—it doesn’t need this legisla-
tion—but the President has chosen not 
to. That is why we introduced legisla-
tion that would grant TPS to our Ven-
ezuelan brothers and sisters. The House 
has already passed a similar bill. 
Now, I have had other issues here in 
the Senate for which I have had to do 
this before, and I will do it again. I am 
not going to relent in our effort to 
grant Venezuelans the protections they 
deserve. Every time my Republican 
colleagues have wanted to stop our Na-
tion from ultimately making progress, 
we have had to shame them into sub-
mission, and this is no different. I am 
not going to stop until the United 
States truly stands in solidarity with 
the Venezuelan people. 
If you don’t want to give them TPS, 
let them make their claims for polit-
ical asylum, but then you take them 
and turn them away before they can 
make cases for political asylum when 
we know—God—that there is a good 
case for political asylum coming out of 
Venezuela. 
Then we have had colleagues in the 
past, one being Senator SCOTT, of Flor-
ida, who came and objected to our TPS 
proposal for Venezuelans. He suggested

September 16, 2020 
that we have to change all of TPS be-
cause, in fact, it had become more than 
a temporary protected status. 
Well, guess what. The Ninth Circuit 
Court actually made a decision which I 
disagree with, but we call attention to 
the action that comes on the heels of a 
disappointing Ninth Circuit decision 
issued on Monday that says that the 
Trump administration’s cruel efforts to 
strip protections of over 300,000 current 
TPS holders is permissible. So there 
goes the argument that, oh, well, TPS 
is permanent. No. The President could 
have granted it, and he can end it when 
he feels the conditions in Venezuela no 
longer should give the opportunity for 
Venezuelans to continue to have tem-
porary protected status. So that argu-
ment is out of the way. 
As for debating this in the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, well, you have 
had over a year to debate it since we 
started this. You are in the majority. 
You control the committee, and you 
control the subcommittee. You could 
have had the debates. We don’t come to 
the floor lightly to seek unanimous 
consent. We do it after having waited a 
considerable time for the debates to 
have taken place—the debates you said 
you wanted—but they haven’t come. 
There are people living, working, and 
raising families legally in the United 
States who have Venezuelan back-
grounds. Yet the President is doing ev-
erything he can to line them up for de-
portation. Of those at risk, 130,000 es-
sential workers are among them, who 
have sacrificed their health during this 
pandemic to ensure that all Americans 
have access to healthcare, food, and 
basic necessities. 
The administration’s efforts are also 
endangering over 273,000 U.S. citizen 
children who call a TPS holder ‘‘Mom’’ 
or ‘‘Dad.’’ That is right. In the midst of 
a deadly pandemic, this administration 
wants to deport the parents of hun-
dreds of thousands of American chil-
dren or force these families to relocate 
their children to unstable, wholly unfa-
miliar countries. 
This callous disregard for TPS hold-
ers and the greater immigrant commu-
nity has to stop. We shouldn’t wait for 
the Ninth Circuit’s decision to be ap-
pealed. We have to create a permanent 
solution for TPS holders who have be-
come integral to our communities and 
deserve a pathway. The Senate should 
not only take up TPS but pass the 
American Dream and Promise Act, 
H.R. 6, which passed the House with bi-
partisan support more than a year ago. 
What are we waiting for? 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Venezuelans deserve TPS right now. 
We cannot wait. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to join my colleagues Sen-
ator MENENDEZ and Senator DURBIN in 
urging the U.S. Senate to do the right 
thing and grant protected status to 
Venezuelans in this country. At this 
moment, I thank them for their contin-
ued leadership on this issue and for 
making sure we have immigration poli-
cies that live up to what this country 
has always stood for. 
As my colleagues have pointed out, 
Venezuela is suffering a dire humani-
tarian crisis under the dictatorship of 
Nicolas Maduro. Its economy has col-
lapsed, and its medical system is in 
free fall. They are governing through a 
reign of terror. 
Even before COVID–19 struck, Ven-
ezuelans were facing shortages of food, 
of water, of gasoline, and other life-
saving items. The pandemic has taken 
a very bad situation and made it much 
worse—in fact, desperate. An estimated 
two-thirds of physicians in Venezuela 
lack access to basic sanitary equip-
ment, like gloves, masks, soap, or gog-
gles, and only 25 percent of the doctors 
have reliable running water in their 
hospitals and clinics. 
On top of this desperate economic 
situation, you have the political tyr-
anny and terror that has been imposed 
by the Maduro regime. In fact, as my 
colleagues pointed out just this morn-
ing, U.N. investigators found that Ven-
ezuelan 
security 
forces 
and 
allied 
groups 
have 
committed 
systemic 
human 
rights 
violations, 
including 
killings and torture, amounting to 
crimes against humanity. Reasonable 
grounds exist to believe that President 
Maduro and his Interior and Defense 
Ministers ordered or contributed to 
these crimes against humanity, which 
are documented in the U.N. report. The 
U.N. factfinding mission has said that 
other national jurisdictions and the 
International Criminal Court should 
consider prosecutions. So you have a 
desperate situation. 
President Trump claims to support 
the people of Venezuela who are facing 
this tyranny and this desperation. In 
fact, as Senator DURBIN said, he has on 
numerous occasions said he was sympa-
thetic and that he wanted to help. 
Here is what he said last year: ‘‘To 
the Venezuelans trapped in this night-
mare, please know that all of America 
is behind you.’’ 
That is what President Trump said. 
Yet he has refused to use his authority 
to take action to grant Venezuelans 
here in the United States that tem-
porary protected status. He wants to 
send them back to what he describes as 
a nightmare—a nightmare that is get-
ting worse by the day as documented 
by the U.N. report. He wants to send 
them back to a place where the U.N. 
has just implicated the government in 
crimes against humanity. 
Because the President refuses to do 
what he says—refuses to actually take 
action to help—the House has passed 
legislation to grant Venezuelans TPS. 
My colleagues Senator MENENDEZ and 
Senator DURBIN have introduced that 
legislation here in the Senate, and I am 
proud to cosponsor it. Yet, as we are 
saying here today, the fastest thing to 
do is to just take up the House bill and 
pass it. So it is incredibly disturbing 
that our Republican colleagues would 
get up and block a vote on that action 
on the very day when the government 
in question, the Government of Ven-
ezuela, has been found to have com-
mitted crimes against humanity. 
The majority in this Senate says: 
Well, don’t worry about that. If you are 
here in the United States, we are going 
to insist that you go back home. We 
are going to insist that you put your-
self and your family back this danger. 
That is what our Senate Republican 
colleagues are saying by blocking the 
vote on this House TPS measure. They 
are forcing innocent people to go home 
to what the President himself de-
scribed as a nightmare. 
As my colleagues have said and as we 
know, this is part of an inhumane, 
anti-immigration agenda from this ad-
ministration—from the Muslim ban, to 
ending DACA, to the termination of 
TPS for many other populations. This 
President has separated families and 
instilled fear in our communities. 
Senator MENENDEZ
referenced the 
Ninth Circuit Court’s decision from 
earlier this week, the decision of its 
upholding, on a 2-to-1 vote, the Presi-
dent’s decision to rescind TPS protec-
tions for over 400,000 individuals who 
are here, working in our communities, 
living here legally with their families. 
Many of them have been here for over 
20 years. As he said, 130,000 of them are 
on our frontlines as essential workers. 
More than 10,000 of them are medical 
professionals who put themselves at 
risk to help others throughout our 
communities and our country. These 
are individuals who are our neighbors 
and small business men and women, 
and they are contributing to our com-
munities and to our country. The 
President has said he wants to deport 
them—400,000 people—despite this hour 
of peril both here and even more so in 
the countries to which they would be 
required to return. 
That is why we have to pass the SE-
CURE Act—to provide stability and se-
curity to those who are on TPS. That 
is why we have to pass the American 
Dream and Promise Act that the House 
passed last year. 
That is why we need to grant TPS to 
Venezuela, so, as my colleagues say, 
this country can do what Presidents 
from both political parties have done 
in the past and Members of the House 
and Senate from both political parties 
have done in the past, which is to live 
up to the idea that we are a place of 
refuge for those who are facing polit-
ical persecution at home. 
I don’t know how you can more clear-
ly define ‘‘political persecution’’ on 
this day than a finding by the United 
Nations that the Government of Ven-
ezuela is committing crimes against 
humanity, against the people of Ven-
ezuela. Yet, that is the day that, once 
again, we saw our Republican col-
leagues block this legislation that 
would allow our country to live up to 
our tradition of doing the right thing.

As Senator MENENDEZ said, I look

HEALTHCARE HEROES 
Mr. 
BOOZMAN. 
Mr. 
President, 
healthcare workers have long been re-
garded as some of our Nation’s most 
critical and courageous servants. Dur-
ing this time of challenges and uncer-
tainty, this has never been more accu-
rate. 
Each day, our healthcare profes-
sionals make tireless sacrifices to pro-
tect and serve our country, even when 
it means risking their own lives to 
take care of others. People like Jen-
nifer Campbell, a registered nurse from 
White River Health System, are a great 
example. She is recognized as the in- 
house expert for all COVID–19 testing. 
She has taken ownership of the com-
munity drive-up testing and worked 
with 
the 
Arkansas 
Department 
of 
Health to organize community testing. 
In Malvern, Vickie Robbins, a reg-
istered nurse at Baptist Health-Hot 
Spring County, has volunteered to 
work extra hours, offered to operate 
drive-through screening, and volun-
teered to treat COVID–19 patients. 
Also, Lora Turknett, a registered nurse 
at Baptist Health-Conway, has been de-
pendable and flexible with the hours 
she works to support the needs of dif-
ferent shifts. She provides compas-
sionate care with a positive attitude. 
During visits to medical facilities 
across Arkansas during the in-State 
work period, I was honored to person-
ally thank frontline workers like them 
and so many others for the critical 
care they are providing. The work of 
these frontline workers and their col-
leagues has become much more dif-
ficult. We are grateful for all they do 
and represent. 
Congress overwhelmingly supported 
the men and women of the medical 
community who are treating COVID–19 
patients and are working to find a cure 
to address the public health crisis with 
the passage of the CARES Act. This 
critical relief was a necessary lifeline 
for hospitals to continue providing 
services to meet the demands of the 
communities and helping our doctors, 
nurses, and other medical professionals 
stay safe while providing care and 
treatment for patients. 
There is more that we can do to sup-
port healthcare and ensure that pa-
tients get reliable care. Listening to 
the needs of hospitals is incredibly im-
portant in many efforts to assist these 
vital facilities, protect the jobs they 
create, and empower their ability to 
serve communities and patients all 
across Arkansas. Insight from the 
healthcare community is a valuable re-
source that helps shape the policies 
that directly impact their mission. 
Along with continuing to provide 
critical resources like PPE, here are 
three things Arkansas healthcare pro-
fessionals recommend we can do to im-
prove services. First of all, we can ex-
pand broadband so more patients can 
take advantage of telehealth; make ex-
panded telehealth services to Medicare 
permanent; and, finally, provide cer-
tainty for the 340B drug discount pro-
gram. 
Telehealth has become vital to pro-
viding effective care for patients dur-
ing this public health emergency. Ac-
cess to medical providers without leav-
ing home offers convenience and safety 
against potential exposure to COVID– 
19. Having the option for virtual doc-
tors’ visits can be a challenge, particu-
larly for rural areas, where broadband 
connectivity is limited. 
This emergency has amplified the 
need for this connection, but, too 
often, providers in rural communities 
are unable to meet the increased de-
mand for telehealth services. So my 
colleagues and I have introduced legis-
lation to help healthcare providers ex-
pand telehealth benefits and improve 
access to broadband. 
The Healthcare Broadband Expansion 
During COVID–19 Act would bolster 
funding for providers in rural areas to 
increase connectivity. This bill would 
help more patients get the care they 
need. 
We have a unique opportunity to see 
how the modifications and updates we 
made to health programs during this 
health emergency can be beneficial in 
the long term. 
The CARES Act provided the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
with the authority to waive telehealth 
requirements for Medicare during this 
emergency. 
Providers 
and 
patients 
have adapted expanded telehealth op-
portunities. 
We 
can 
continue 
to 
strengthen this access by making these 
services permanent. 
Earlier this summer, I joined a bipar-
tisan group of Senators to urge our Na-
tion’s top health agencies to make the 
permanent changes to telehealth re-
quirements for Medicare that Congress 
authorized in the CARES Act. 
Last month, President Trump issued 
an 
Executive 
order 
to 
improve 
healthcare in rural America by expand-
ing telehealth resources and services. 
The President’s action included a pro-
posal to parts of Medicare’s telehealth 
coverage. This is a step in the right di-
rection. I look forward to working with 
the administration to implement a rule 
that will enhance the delivery of 
healthcare to Medicare patients. 
When Arkansas hospital administra-
tors shared their concerns over future 
eligibility in the 340B program, I signed 
on to support Senator THUNE’s bill to 
provide certainty to current partici-
pants. As hospitals paused elective pro-
cedures and as admissions decreased 
for Medicare and Medicaid patients, ad-
ministrators’ concerns that their hos-
pitals would no longer be eligible for 
the 340B program increased. These are 
among the key metrics used to deter-
mine acceptance into the program. The 
340B drug discount program has pro-
vided flexibility to Arkansas hospitals 
to help lower drug prices. Extending 
eligibility so they can care for low-in-
come patients is critical. 
These are three measures we can 
take to help patients continue to get 
quality, reliable care. We must remem-
ber that, like our valued healthcare 
workers, we play an important role in 
fighting the virus. By following the 
guidance and recommendations laid 
out by our public health officials, we 
can help our medical heroes and make 
a positive impact to prevent the spread 
of COVID–19. 
I yield the floor.

DACA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has 
been exactly 90 days since the Supreme 
Court rejected President Trump’s ef-
fort to end deportation protection for 
Dreamers. Dreamers, of course, are 
young immigrants who came to the 
United States as children, toddlers, or 
infants and who grew up in this coun-
try believing they were part of Amer-
ica, only to learn when they were old 
enough to be told, as teenagers, that 
they were undocumented through no 
fault of their own. 
In an opinion by Chief Justice John 
Roberts, the Supreme Court held that 
the President’s attempt to rescind the 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, 
known as DACA, was ‘‘arbitrary and 
capricious.’’ 
It was 10 years ago that I joined with 
then-Republican Senator Dick Lugar, 
of Indiana, on a bipartisan basis, to 
call on President Obama to use his 
legal authority to protect Dreamers 
from deportation. President Obama 
heard our call. He responded by cre-
ating the DACA Program. DACA pro-
vides temporary protection to Dream-
ers from deportation on a 2-year basis, 
which is renewable if they register 
with the government, pay a fee, and 
pass criminal and national security 
background checks. More than 800,000 
Dreamers came forward to sign up for 
DACA. 
DACA unleashed their full potential, 
and they could see there might be a fu-
ture. They began to contribute to our 
country as soldiers, teachers, and small 
business owners. More than 200,000 
DACA recipients are essential critical 
infrastructure workers. That is not my 
choice of words. It is the definition of 
President 
Trump’s 
Department 
of 
Homeland Security. More than 200,000 
DACA recipients are essential critical 
infrastructure workers. Among these

September 16, 2020 
essential workers, 41,700 DACA recipi-
ents are in healthcare. They are doc-
tors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, 
and respiratory therapists. 
Despite this incredible story of these 
innocent children coming to the United 
States while not having legal status in 
this country but having fear of depor-
tation and still being determined to be 
part of America’s future, as well as the 
fact that they would serve our country 
as essential workers and healthcare 
workers, on September 5, 2017, Presi-
dent Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds 
of thousands of Dreamers faced losing 
their work permits and being deported 
to countries they may not even remem-
ber. 
The Federal court stepped in and or-
dered the Trump administration to 
continue DACA for Dreamers who had 
already received this protection. How-
ever, Dreamers who had not already re-
ceived DACA were blocked from apply-
ing from this protection for nearly 3 
years while the case languished in 
court. 
The 
Center 
for 
American 
Progress estimates that approximately 
300,000 Dreamers had been unable to 
apply for the program because the case 
was in court. 
On June 19, the day after the Su-
preme 
Court 
rejected 
President 
Trump’s repeal of DACA, I led a letter 
from 43 Democratic Senators to the 
President. We called on the President 
to follow the law, to immediately com-
ply with the Supreme Court’s decision 
and reopen DACA for those who were 
eligible to apply. It has been 3 months 
now. We haven’t received any response 
from President Trump, and the Trump 
administration 
refuses 
to 
reopen 
DACA. 
In July, a Federal judge issued an 
order for the Trump administration to 
begin receiving new applications for 
DACA. Instead, Acting—and let me un-
derline 
‘‘Acting’’—Department 
of 
Homeland Security Secretary Chad 
Wolf has issued a memo saying that 
the DHS will ‘‘reject all initial re-
quests for DACA.’’ 
Let’s be clear. The Supreme Court of 
the United States rejected President 
Trump’s repeal of DACA. That means 
DACA returns to its original status, 
and the Trump administration, under 
Court order, must reopen the program, 
and it must do it now. Instead, Mr. 
Wolf is saying the DHS will turn away 
300,000 applicants who are Dreamers 
who are eligible for DACA but who 
have not had a chance to apply. 
It is important to note that the non-
partisan Government Accountability 
Office has concluded that Acting Sec-
retary Wolf is illegally serving. This 
calls into serious question any legal 
authority he claims in issuing a memo 
to refuse to reopen DACA. 
This administration, which is telling 
America it is dedicated to law and 
order, is in open defiance of the Su-
preme Court. The stakes are high both 
for the rule of law and, just as impor-
tantly, for the lives of Dreamers. To ig-
nore this is to ignore a legitimate 
order of the highest Court in the land. 
Republicans and Democrats in Con-
gress should come together to compel 
this President to follow the law and 
immediately comply with the Supreme 
Court’s mandate. 
On June 4 of last year, the House of 
Representatives passed H.R. 6, the 
American Dream and Promise Act. 
This legislation would give Dreamers a 
path to citizenship—my goal for years. 
It passed on a strong bipartisan vote. It 
has been pending in the Senate, sitting 
on the desk of Republican leader MITCH 
MCCONNELL, for more than 12 months. 
After the Supreme Court decision, I 
sent a letter, signed by all 47 Demo-
crats, calling on Senator MCCONNELL 
to immediately give us a vote on the 
Dream and Promise Act. It has been 3 
months. Still no reply. 
The Dream and Promise Act would 
also provide a path to citizenship for 
400,000 immigrants who have been liv-
ing in the United States on temporary 
protected status. More than 90 percent 
of them are originally from El Sal-
vador, Honduras, and Haiti. Most of 
them have lived in the United States 
for over 20 years. 
As with DACA, TPS recipients must 
register with the government, pay a 
fee, and clear criminal and national se-
curity background checks. Like DACA 
recipients, TPS recipients are making 
important contributions to America. 
More than 130,000 TPS holders are es-
sential critical infrastructure workers, 
and 11,600 are healthcare workers. 
My friend, the Senator from Arkan-
sas, just came to the floor and lauded 
our healthcare heroes across America 
in the midst of this pandemic. I have 
given that same speech. I think we all 
have, and we mean it. Yet did you ever 
stop and think how many of those 
healthcare workers are the DACA re-
cipients, Dreamers, TPS holders—the 
so-called immigrants—whom we want 
to reject and remove from this coun-
try? We praise them on one hand, and 
we tell them to get the heck out of the 
United States on the other. How can 
that be consistent? 
Two years ago, I negotiated bipar-
tisan legislation with a path to citizen-
ship for DACA and TPS recipients. 
President Trump profanely dismissed 
our bill in an Oval Office meeting that 
has now become infamous. Instead, the 
President is trying to rescind TPS pro-
tections and deport hundreds of thou-
sands of immigrants from our country. 
A Federal judge concluded that the 
President broke the law and blocked 
his effort to end TPS. Earlier this 
week, in a divided decision, two Repub-
lican-appointed judges ruled the other 
way and lifted the injunctions. This de-
cision makes it even more important 
that the Senate immediately consider 
the Dream and Promise Act. 
Over the years since I introduced the 
DREAM Act, I decided the only way to 
tell the story of this bill was to tell the 
story of the Dreamers. I have come to 
the floor 125 times to tell the stories. 
Today will be the 126th. I want to tell 
you the story of these two people. I 
will start with Esmeralda Tovar-Mora. 
In this photo, she is with her husband, 
whom I will talk about more in just a 
moment. 
Esmerelda is the 126th Dreamer’s 
story I have told in the Senate, and it 
is a good one. She came to the United 
States from Mexico at the age of 2, so 
she obviously had no voice in that deci-
sion. She grew up in Hutchinson, KS. 
She sent me a letter, and here is 
what she said about growing up: 
Growing up in the United States has been 
the only thing that I’ve known. Pledging al-
legiance to the American flag and singing 
the national anthem on a daily basis made 
me believe that I was truly American. 
She was a good student—no, she was 
excellent. In high school, she was a 
member of the National Honor Society 
and president of the Key Club. She 
sang in her church choir and played on 
the tennis team. She graduated magna 
cum laude. 
Esmerelda’s experiences in the Key 
Club visiting nursing homes convinced 
her she wanted a career in healthcare. 
Thanks to DACA—thanks to DACA— 
Esmerelda was able to work as a wait-
ress to support herself through college. 
She is now a case manager at a mental 
health center and a medication aide in 
an Alzheimer’s ward in Hutchinson, 
KS. 
She is married to Michael Mora, seen 
in this picture. Specialist Mora serves 
in the Kansas National Guard and re-
cently returned from a 9-month tour in 
the Middle East—National Guardsman, 
9 months in the Middle East—serving a 
country that will not recognize his wife 
as a citizen. 
Let me introduce you to someone 
else. This is special. This beautiful lit-
tle girl is Esmerelda and Michael’s 
daughter Rose. She just turned 4. 
Esmerelda is on the frontlines of the 
coronavirus pandemic, and here is what 
she said: 
We’ve been on lockdown since March 30. 
Since family members can’t visit, my pa-
tients are scared and lonely. Many have 
started asking me to call them Grandma or 
Grandpa, a little crumb of comfort at a time 
when the world around them is going crazy. 
I’m happy to be their adopted grand-
daughter. It eases the pain of scrubbing my 
hands until they’re raw and the anxiety that 
I could infect my beautiful family. It also 
makes me happy to know that I am appre-
ciated here in Hutchinson, because right now 
I’ve got an added stress: The U.S. govern-
ment wants to deport me. 
I want to thank Esmerelda for her 
service. She is truly a health hero—an 
immigrant health hero. She is a DACA 
health hero. She is putting herself and 
her family at risk every day to protect 
others—Americans—loving members of 
families, and it may be their last day 
on Earth. She should not also have to 
worry about whether she is going to be 
deported and her family torn apart. 
Isn’t it enough that her husband is 
serving our country to prove how much 
this family loves America? 
Would we be stronger as a country if 
we tell Esmerelda Tovar-Mora to leave

or if she becomes an American citizen 
and 
continues 
to 
work 
on 
the 
frontlines of the COVID–19 pandemic? I 
don’t think the answer is even hard. I 
think it is clear. 
Esmerelda and hundreds of thousands 
of other Dreamers and TPS holders are 
counting on those of us in the Senate 
to solve this crisis that President 
Trump created. 
I am sorry that Senate Republicans 
are ignoring President Trump’s defi-
ance of the Supreme Court and refusing 
to bring the Dream and Promise Act to 
the floor. 
As long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will 
be coming to this floor to fight for 
Esmerelda Tovar-Mora and all immi-
grants. It would be an American trag-
edy to deport this brave and talented 
healthcare worker in the midst of this 
pandemic. 
We 
must 
ensure 
that 
Esmerelda and hundreds of others of 
our essential workforce are not forced 
to stop working when we need them 
more than ever, and we must give them 
a chance—just a chance—to earn their 
way to citizenship. 
Mr. President, it has been my honor 
to represent Esmerelda and the hun-
dreds of thousands of Dreamers over 
the 
years. 
They 
have 
never 
dis-
appointed me—never. 
Many times we brought to the floor 
of the Senate the Dream Act, bills con-
taining the Dream Act. We have man-
aged to pass them a few times but 
never at the same time as the House, 
so they have never become law. So for 
decades—literally for decades—these 
young people have waited for their 
chance. They have done everything 
they can possibly do to prove they love 
this country. What will it take to con-
vince my colleagues? What will it take 
to convince them that losing this beau-
tiful young woman, with this pretty 
little girl, Rose, and telling this man, 
who served our country in the Kansas 
National Guard in a 9-month tour of 
duty in the Middle East—what will it 
take to convince my Senate colleagues 
that these are worthy people to become 
American citizens? 
Some of us just lucked out; we were 
born here. There was never a moment 
where we made a decision; we were 
Americans from the start. But for oth-
ers, they have had to prove their way 
into this country. Hasn’t this wonder-
ful young woman proved her way into 
America? Hasn’t she told us why she 
should be given the right to become—a 
great honor—a citizen of the United 
States of America? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 697 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the brave men and women of our law 
enforcement are facing an onslaught of 
violence, harassment, and abuse. They 
deserve better. These selfless individ-
uals are true heroes who put their lives 
on the line every day to protect our 
communities. 
Right now, as Hurricane Sally moves 
across Florida’s panhandle and Ala-
bama, causing massive flooding and 
storm surge, law enforcement officials 
are working tirelessly to keep people 
safe. They are going out in these ex-
tremely dangerous conditions to rescue 
those in need. 
We can never truly repay them for 
their 
service 
and 
their 
sacrifice. 
Throughout my 8 years as Governor, 
we lost 51 members of law enforcement 
in the line of duty, and you wouldn’t 
believe the bravery of these individuals 
and the strength of the families and 
communities who support them. 
As Governor and now Senator, sup-
porting and investing in our law en-
forcement has always been a top pri-
ority. Because of our efforts, Florida 
has a 49-year low in our crime rate. 
Americans are moving to Florida in 
droves, not just for low taxes and great 
weather but because we have safe com-
munities, and that is thanks to our 
hard-working law enforcement. That is 
why it is so disturbing to see the har-
assment, the insults, and the abuse 
from the liberal mob. 
I remember what it was like for 
American soldiers coming back from 
Vietnam. Whether you agreed or dis-
agreed with that war, the abuse and in-
sults directed at our military men and 
women were disgusting and disgraceful. 
We are seeing the same thing today di-
rected at our men and women in blue. 
It is just as disgraceful. 
The radical left wants to defund the 
police—the most dangerous policy idea 
of my lifetime. Think about that for a 
minute. If you defund the police, who 
do you call when your house gets bro-
ken into? Who is going to patrol the 
streets to prevent drug trafficking and 
violence? Who is going to investigate 
murders and rapes and assaults and 
robberies? Who is going to protect our 
schools? We only have to turn on our 
TVs for the answer. 
Over the past several months, rioters 
and thugs, filled with hate inspired by 
this goal of defunding the police, have 
turned their words into violent action 
in cities across this great country— 
throwing homemade bombs at officers 
and setting fire to police stations. 
We have watched Democratic mayors 
and Governors turn their backs on law- 
and-order and try to pretend that these 
violent demonstrations are somehow 
peaceful, and their partners in the 
media have helped. 
This past weekend, we saw another 
horrific act of senseless violence as two 
sheriff’s deputies in Los Angeles were 
ambushed by a deranged gunman. In 
the evening, rioters surrounded the 
hospital where the deputies were fight-
ing for their lives and chanted ‘‘We 
hope they die.’’ We hope they die? We 
should all be denouncing this heinous 
act—all of us—and praying for the 
speedy and full recovery of the depu-
ties. We should all be denouncing the 
cruel, heartless, and frankly pathetic 
disregard for human life that was 
clearly evident from these protesters. 
This anti-police mentality is raging 
in American cities and threatening the 
future of America as we know it. Our 
law enforcement officers dedicate their 
lives to protecting our communities, 
and we can’t let these acts of violence 
continue. 
We can all agree that reforms need to 
be made. That is why it is so unbeliev-
able that my Democratic colleagues 
refuse to even debate the police reform 
bill led by Senator SCOTT of South 
Carolina. Instead of actually doing 
something and having a chance at pro-
viding healing to our Nation, Senate 
Democrats turned their backs on our 
law enforcement. 
But we can’t let the radical left use 
the crimes of a few bad actors to de-
monize good, hard-working police offi-
cers—officers 
like 
Sergeant 
Adrian 
Rodriguez and Sergeant James Henry 
of the Lakeland Police Department. 
They began the department’s Neighbor-
hood Program over 6 years ago and 
lead two outstanding teams of officers 
who do everything from reading at the 
local kindergarten classes to assisting 
a SWAT team with the service of high- 
risk drug warrants. No matter the as-
signment, their teams work nonstop to 
build community pride in the citizens’ 
police department. 
Officer Jimmie Bizzle of the Tampa 
International Airport Police Depart-
ment is dedicated to bettering his com-
munity and supporting individuals who 
experience homelessness. He trains his 
colleagues on how to connect homeless 
individuals with the resources and 
services they need. 
Corporal Margo Fergusson of the 
Tampa Police Department spent years 
of her career defending and protecting 
children by investigating crimes in the 
department’s Sex Crimes and Child 
Abuse Unit, working tirelessly to hold 
offenders accountable. During the pan-
demic, she has been working with her 
fellow officers and local schools to dis-
bursing food to families who might 
need a helping hand. 
Detective Michelle Mahoney of the 
Clearwater Police Department is part 
of the department’s Refuse to Lose 
Program, which engages the faith- 
based community with youth offenders 
to help them succeed and stay on a 
good path, offering services like tutor-
ing, employment, and mental health 
help. She is known for her empathy, 
understanding, and compassion for her 
community. 
Instead of attacking and defunding 
the police and starving these hard- 
working men and women of the re-
sources they need to do their job, we 
need to do the opposite. We need to 
fund the police. We need to recognize 
and support the individuals who have 
worked so hard to make our Nation the 
safe America we know and love. We

September 16, 2020 
need to reject dangerous proposals that 
threaten our communities and strip 
the safety we hold dear. It is time to 
stand up and say ‘‘enough.’’ 
Defunding the police is un-American 
and the antithesis of the values that 
make America great. Police officers 
across the country risk their lives 
every day to keep people safe, and they 
deserve our appreciation. They uphold 
their oath to serve and protect. 
Today, I am introducing a Senate 
resolution to condemn the widespread 
violence, the hatred and vilification of 
law enforcement, and express our un-
wavering support for the brave men 
and women in uniform who protect us. 
I am proud to have Senator DAINES 
here today and thank him for his un-
wavering commitment to law enforce-
ment and for joining us today. We ask 
that all of our colleagues join us in 
support. 
To the sheriffs, police chiefs, sheriff’s 
deputies, police officers, highway pa-
trol, State troopers, Federal marshals, 
and many other law enforcement offi-
cials who serve in Florida and across 
the country, thank you. It is time that 
you get the respect you deserve, and I 
won’t accept anything less. 
Mr. President, at this time I would 
like to yield to my colleague from 
Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Florida for 
yielding his time. He is not only the 
Senator from Florida; he is also a 
former Governor. 
Mr. President, I am here today to 
talk about the brave men and women 
of law enforcement in Montana and 
across this Nation. These men and 
women, many who are my friends, are 
the best of the best. Montana heroes 
literally put their lives on the line 
every day to protect our families—our 
moms, our dads, our kids. They don’t 
do it for the pay or the accolades; they 
do it to serve their communities, to 
keep us safe. 
The men and women wearing that 
badge accept that every time they 
leave home to go to their shift and give 
their loved ones a kiss goodbye, they 
may never come back home. That is 
courage. 
My home county sheriff—Gallatin 
County, MT—Sheriff Brian Gootkin— 
just a little over 1 week ago, we had a 
huge, massive wildfire that struck the 
Bridgers just north and east of Boze-
man. It has been my hometown for 56 
years. There were huge plumes of 
smoke, a great big fire—11,000 acres. 
They rushed into the fire and evacu-
ated the residents there. Twenty-eight 
homes were destroyed, and not a single 
person lost their life. I can tell you 
why—because of the actions of the Gal-
latin sheriff’s department, firefighters, 
and other agencies. 
This courage is something we should 
celebrate every day. This is something 
we should defend every day, including 
right here on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. But, sadly, some people have other 
ideas. 
The way that members of our law en-
forcement are being treated right now 
around this country is atrocious. It is 
disturbing. Just this past weekend, two 
members of L.A.’s law enforcement, a 
man and a woman, were ambushed 
while sitting in their car—shot point- 
blank. Many of you have seen the hor-
rifying videos. 
If that weren’t sickening enough, 
there were violent protesters storming 
the hospital that they were being 
treated at and chanting ‘‘Let them 
die.’’ There are no words to describe 
the outrage of what is happening here. 
This anti-police rhetoric is beyond dan-
gerous, and those who support it should 
be ashamed of themselves. They should 
be publicly condemned by every Sen-
ator, every Representative, and every 
Governor across this great country. 
In fact, just this year, 37 officers 
have been killed. By the way, that is 
more than a 20-percent increase over 
the same time last year. Being a police 
officer in this country is more dan-
gerous than ever before. I am having 
private conversations with members of 
law enforcement, our peace officers, 
men and women who will quietly tell 
you that it is difficult to continue to 
serve in this environment where they 
are not getting the support of their 
elected officials. I will tell you they 
are getting the support of their com-
munities in many cases, though. But 
where is the outrage being expressed by 
those who are elected to serve, and how 
are these heroes repaid? 
Cities and towns across our country, 
including Montana’s very own city, 
Missoula, are talking about reducing 
their budgets and proposing abolish-
ment in some areas—abolishment of 
police departments. That talk is crazy. 
We have some of this crazy talk in 
Montana, where some of our commu-
nities were looking to take school re-
source officers out of our schools. They 
were looking to slash budgets. Thank-
fully—thankfully—the community rose 
up, and they pushed back and, in most 
cases, stopped it. That is happening 
right in Montana in some commu-
nities. 
The Senators standing before you 
today will not accept it. We should not 
be defunding the police. We should be 
defending them. 
To my Democratic colleagues who 
support defunding these American he-
roes and these Montana heroes, you 
should be ashamed. I will always back 
the blue. 
I yield back to my colleague Senator 
SCOTT. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
first, I want to thank my colleague 
from Montana for his unwavering sup-
port for law enforcement. It is hard to 
believe that in a State like Montana, 
which is so supportive of law enforce-
ment, there would be any city that 
would be thinking about reducing their 
police budget. It shouldn’t be hap-
pening around the country. 
I am honored to stand here today to 
support our brave law enforcement and 
say enough is enough. We are not going 
to tolerate violence, attacks, and vili-
fication of our law enforcement. I am 
proud to introduce the Back the Blue 
resolution today. I am asking all of my 
colleagues to join me in support. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the consideration of S. Res. 697, sub-
mitted earlier today. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to; that the preamble be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, thank 
you very much for the recognition. Re-
serving the right to object, as a former 
New Mexico attorney general and as-
sistant U.S. attorney, I have worked 
closely with law enforcement for many 
years. I have worked hard to prosecute 
violent crimes in my career, including 
crimes where law enforcement officers 
were the victims. I have been privi-
leged to work with law enforcement in 
New Mexico, and we are all thankful 
for the tremendous work of the Capitol 
Police here in our Nation’s Capital. 
The Senate is united in our respect 
for law enforcement. Just 5 months 
ago, in May, the Senate passed a num-
ber of bills and a bipartisan resolution 
during National Police Week in support 
of those who serve our communities in 
the face of risk. 
We all agree that deadly violence tar-
geting law enforcement is appalling, 
and we all have expressed gratitude for 
the brave men and women who serve in 
law enforcement. The recent shooting 
of two law sheriff’s deputies in Cali-
fornia was heinous. Our prayers go out 
to the officers and their families, and 
the perpetrator must be brought to jus-
tice. 
Like many of us here on both sides of 
the aisle, I am also dedicated to em-
bracing a moment before our Nation 
where we confront the very real issues 
of systemic racial injustice. We have 
policy disagreements on how to do 
that, but I hope that we can all agree 
the Senate should be a place for com-
ing together and making progress to 
respond to this moment in our country, 
not fanning the flames of division and 
anger. 
The initial draft of this resolution 
has some vague but divisive language 
that I do not think belongs in a Senate 
resolution, and a number of other 
Members agree. Our side is asking for 
some reasonable changes in good faith. 
To reflect the public safety and trust 
between law enforcement and commu-
nities is fundamental to the security 
and prosperity of our Nation. I hope 
that the Senator from Florida and his 
colleagues are willing to accept those 
changes, which I will offer in response 
to his request. Then the Senate can

speak with a united voice and set a 
good example for our Nation at a time 
like this. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of my resolution at the desk; fur-
ther, that the resolution be agreed to; 
that the preamble be agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I appre-
ciate my colleague’s interest in ex-
pressing support for the brave men and 
women of law enforcement. That is ex-
actly what my resolution does. Why, 
then, would my colleague object to my 
resolution and propose his own to ac-
complish the same thing? 
At first, his resolution appears to re-
semble my own. I note, however, that 
my resolution condemns not only the 
cowardly attacks of this past week on 
the Los Angeles County sheriff’s depu-
ties but also condemns the rhetoric and 
policies that have incited this recent 
spike in targeted violence against law 
enforcement. My colleague’s resolution 
makes no such condemnation. 
My resolution calls out the radical 
politicians, reckless media figures, and 
organized protest movements that have 
sought to vilify law enforcement offi-
cers as a whole and incite, encourage, 
or celebrate widespread criminal activ-
ity and violence against law enforce-
ment officers. My colleague’s resolu-
tion is silent about this. 
My resolution calls out the radical 
politicians for pursuing a dangerous 
campaign to defund the police and 
starving law enforcement agencies of 
much needed resources to combat the 
crime wave sweeping through our com-
munities. My colleague’s resolution 
makes no such condemnation. 
We have to be honest about what is 
happening here and across our great 
country. We have rioters chanting ‘‘Let 
them die’’ outside a hospital caring for 
two police officers who were violently 
attacked. ‘‘Let them die’’? 
Americans have the right to peace-
fully protest, and I support that right. 
But that is not what we are talking 
about here. We are talking about acts 
of violence against law enforcement, 
families, 
and 
businesses. 
My 
col-
league’s proposal takes out all ref-
erences to this bad behavior. 
Expressing support for law enforce-
ment without condemning the people 
and groups who are perpetrating, insti-
gating, and celebrating the violent acts 
committed against law enforcement of-
ficers is not enough. We can’t be afraid 
to condemn violence against law en-
forcement and the defund police move-
ment. I have no such fear. 
Those radical politicians, reckless 
media figures, and organized protest 
movements deserve to be condemned 
for inciting, committing, and cele-
brating acts of violence against law en-
forcement. I stand firmly behind my 
resolution and behind our Nation’s law 
enforcement. 
If my colleague would be willing to 
work with me, we may be able to find 
common ground to ensure any resolu-
tion includes language that firmly de-
nounces the violence and the causes of 
that violence in our communities, but 
my colleague’s resolution does not go 
far enough, so I therefore respectfully 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. UDALL. Yes, there is. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. UDALL. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
50-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE VINCENNES 
UNIVERSITY JASPER CAMPUS 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise this 
evening to recognize the 50-year anni-
versary of Vincennes University Jasper 
Campus. 
Vincennes University was founded in 
1801 as part of the Northwest Territory 
back then that would later become the 
State of Indiana. For over 200 years, 
Vincennes University has been a pre-
mier institution of higher learning for 
those seeking knowledge in manufac-
turing, logistics, aviation, and other 
important fields of study. 
In 1970, when I was a mere junior in 
high school, this university expanded 
and established a new campus in my 
hometown. 
With open enrollment and concen-
trating on jobs with fields where there 
were employee shortages, Vincennes 
University Jasper Campus is providing 
opportunities for all Hoosiers to add 
new skills to their resume that will ul-
timately lead to good-paying jobs, 
mostly right there in Indiana. 
Notably, with their partnership with 
Purdue University, this campus pro-
vides low-income students or those in 
need of remedial coursework with a 
stepping stone to one of the Nation’s 
top engineering schools. 
I have to admit, VU Jasper Campus 
holds a special place in my heart. At 
the company I founded in the early 
eighties, we use this as an excellent 
source of recruiting people into our 
own company who generally come 
there fully skilled, ready to go, and 
generally end up sticking with the job, 
which is great. 
As a Jasper native, I have seen first-
hand what an asset this campus has 
been to our community and the eco-
nomic benefit it has added to Dubois 
and surrounding counties. 
We are lucky to have VU in Jasper, 
and I am happy to be here on the floor 
of the U.S. Senate to celebrate with 
them on their golden anniversary. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss this 
unprecedented obstruction that Amer-
ican families are facing from the 
Democrats. In a time when Congress 
really should be working toward bipar-
tisan solutions on coronavirus, Demo-
crats keep obstructing—over and over 
and over again. 
It does seem to be their singular 
focus. It seems to me that they are 
going to continue to obstruct all the 
way until November 3, election day, 
putting politics first and American 
families last. 
The obstruction has reached levels 
that has even made Members of their 
own 
caucus 
‘‘uncomfortable,’’ 
‘‘alarmed,’’ 
and 
‘‘frustrated.’’ 
Now, 
those are not my words; they are the 
words of Democrats sitting in Con-
gress, in the United States, in this very 
building. Democrats are telling their 
leaders that the leaders are failing 
them by failing to compromise and 
work together toward solutions that 
would benefit the American people. 
So the bad news for American fami-
lies is that, last week, Democrats in 
this body, in the U.S. Senate, blocked, 
obstructed a targeted coronavirus aid 
package with policies, amazingly, that 
the Democrats had at one time sup-
ported. But they came here to the floor 
of the Senate and voted, in lockstep, 
no—no to children, no to jobs, no to 
paychecks, no to fighting the disease. 
They actually blocked relief that 
would, one, have gotten kids back to 
school so kids wouldn’t fall further be-
hind from the school they have already 
missed, and it would have let parents 
get back to work. They voted no. They 
blocked people getting back to work 
safely. They blocked paycheck protec-
tion money so that paychecks could 
continue to go and businesses—small 
businesses—could remain open. 
They blocked money for vaccines and 
treatment, for testing, so we could put 
the disease in the rearview mirror. 
Now, the good news is that the ma-
jority of the Senate did support the 
legislation to help children and their 
parents and workers and the small 
businesses and the medical personnel 
fighting against the disease. But all 
those votes came from the Republican 
side of the aisle. Republicans are 
united. The Republican bill received 52 
‘‘yes’’ votes. All 52 were Republican. 
Not one single Democrat voted yes, 
even though the majority of that body 
had backed the relief efforts. 
When you talked to them, they said, 
oh, yes, they are for this and this and 
this, but they voted on the U.S. Senate 
floor to block it. It is interesting. They 
even blocked allowing the Senate to 
discuss these issues. All we did was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5643 
September 16, 2020 
come to the floor and say: We have 
some proposals. Let’s discuss them. If 
you don’t like them, offer amendments. 
We can discuss those, debate those. 
They even blocked a motion to move 
to get that bill to the floor of the Sen-
ate—step 1 of legislating. They said no. 
So they may say they want to help the 
American people, but that is not what 
happened on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
The New York Times had a headline 
that said: ‘‘Hopes Dim for More Stim-
ulus as Democrats Block Narrow GOP 
Plan.’’ Well, they are right; it is a nar-
row plan because it is targeted. It is 
targeted to kids and schools, to work-
ers, jobs, and the disease. 
It doesn’t include all of the extra-
neous things that NANCY PELOSI and 
the House put in: money for environ-
mental justice; money for the National 
Endowment; money for this, that, and 
the next thing; money for—you name 
it—direct paychecks to illegal immi-
grants. That is just the tip of the ice-
berg when you take a look at their en-
tire list. To me, it was NANCY PELOSI 
living on ‘‘Fantasy Island.’’ 
POLITICO said of the vote: ‘‘Senate 
Democrats block Republican COVID re-
lief 
proposal’’—Senate 
Democrats 
block—once again, blocking the things 
that the American families all across 
this country are asking when they look 
to Congress for help and relief. 
USA TODAY had the headline: ‘‘Sen-
ate 
Democrats 
block 
$300 
billion 
coronavirus stimulus package, leaving 
little hope for relief before Novem-
ber’’—$300 billion. That is a huge 
amount of money that could do so 
much to help our schools, to help our 
students, to help small businesses, to 
help our workers, and to help fight the 
disease. 
Unfortunately, this has been the 
record that we have seen coming from 
the Democrats ever since the pandemic 
began. While the virus was raging in 
March, Democrats delayed help for 
Americans by blocking the CARES 
Act. 
The New York Times headline at 
that time, on March 22, said: ‘‘Emer-
gency Economic Rescue Plan in Limbo 
as Democrats Block Action.’’ So they 
were blocking it back in March, and 
they were blocking it last Thursday. 
In April, as small businesses were 
forcibly shut down by the government, 
they were fighting to, one day, reopen 
their doors—that is all they wanted to 
do, get back to business; they wanted 
to keep employees on the payroll— 
Democrats, once again, blocked fund-
ing for the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
This is a wonderful program, Mr. 
President. Thirteen thousand of these 
loans were taken in the State of Wyo-
ming by small businesses. I am sure, in 
your home State of South Dakota, 
similar small businesses took advan-
tage of this opportunity. Our average 
loan was about $78,000. These are small 
businesses that just needed help mak-
ing the payroll, keeping people work-
ing, keeping people on the payroll, 
looking forward to the days that they 
could return to business as usual. 
What was the NPR, National Public 
Radio, point on this on April 9? It was 
this: ‘‘Senate Democrats Block GOP 
Efforts to Boost Small Business Aid’’— 
Senate Democrats blocking aid for 
small businesses all across the country. 
Then, in August, as unemployment 
insurance was set to expire, Repub-
licans asked for consent on this floor 
to extend the program. Democrats 
came to this very floor and, once again, 
objected. 
So, today, with an opportunity to fin-
ish the fight against coronavirus, the 
Democrats have a full roadblock in 
place against any further relief. The 
cold, hard truth that we face is that 
they have delayed aid, and they have 
divided this country all year long. 
I would go so far as to say this has 
hurt the country; it has hurt families; 
it has hurt our students; it has hurt 
our schools; it has hurt our healthcare 
providers; and it has certainly hurt 
people trying to recover from the dis-
ease. 
Remember that the year started with 
the Democrats’ completely partisan 
impeachment farce. We sat here, day 
after day, listening as the Democrats 
brought forth charge after charge 
against the President. That is how we 
started the year, and now we are end-
ing with their blocking of coronavirus 
relief. 
Let me assure the country, Repub-
licans will not let you down. Repub-
licans will continue working to put the 
virus in the rearview mirror and de-
liver what we are seeing right now, and 
it is the great American comeback. It 
is people getting back to work—over 10 
million Americans back to work over 
the last 4 months. It is an unemploy-
ment rate down below 9 percent. It was 
over 9 percent for 4 months. 
It is businesses reopening, kids going 
back to school, a vaccine on the way— 
great, optimistic ideas and thoughts 
regarding the vaccine. I met with the 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices earlier today. I am very encour-
aged and optimistic about a vaccine 
being available to many at the end of 
the year. 
So there is a lot to be optimistic 
about as the country comes back from 
the coronavirus because this is the 
great American comeback. 
I yield the floor. 
(Mr. BARRASSO assumed the Chair.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor this evening to talk 
about what Congress needs to do right 
now to help the American people with 
regard to this coronavirus pandemic. 
We are not out of the woods yet. People 
are still struggling, with the economy 
being weak, and we still have a real 
healthcare crisis to deal with. 
Since this crisis began, Congress has 
come together as Republicans and 
Democrats both here in the Senate and 
over in the House, working with the 
White House, to pass five coronavirus 
bills—five. Legislation addressed both 
the healthcare crisis and the economic 
free-fall that were caused by the virus 
and also by the government-imposed 
shutdowns. The biggest of these bills 
was the one you hear most about; that 
is, the roughly $2 trillion in the CARES 
Act that was passed by a vote in this 
Chamber of 96 to 0—totally bipartisan. 
Unfortunately, since May, when the 
last of these bipartisan bills was en-
acted, partisanship has prevailed over 
policy, and Washington has been para-
lyzed, unable to repeat the coming to-
gether for the public good. 
Democrats in this Chamber have con-
sistently insisted that the only way 
forward is a bill called the Heroes Act. 
This is a $3.5 trillion piece of legisla-
tion that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives 4 months ago along par-
tisan lines. 
By the way, $3.5 trillion would be the 
most expensive legislation ever to be 
enacted. 
When this bill passed the House 4 
months ago, POLITICO and others in 
the media accurately called it a mes-
saging bill that had no chance of be-
coming law. 
It is disappointing that Democrats 
have continued to push this ‘‘my way 
or the highway’’ approach because this 
bill is a nonstarter for a lot of reasons, 
including the price tag and the fact 
that it includes non-COVID-related 
provisions. To name one example, it re-
peals the State and local tax deduction 
cap. That is a $135 billion Tax Code 
change, and most of the benefit is 
going to go to the top 1 percent of wage 
earners. What does it have to do with 
COVID–19? 
Now is not the time to give tax 
breaks 
to 
the 
wealthy, 
to 
make 
changes to our immigration policy, or 
impose unprecedented mandates on 
State election procedures that are nor-
mally in the province of the States, not 
us—all of which are part of the Heroes 
Act. Instead, this should be a time 
where we focus on what the American 
people need right now and help them to 
handle this healthcare and economic 
challenge they are facing, but that 
hasn’t happened. 
Last week I spoke on this floor about 
all the things in the targeted bill that 
was voted on last Thursday in this 
Chamber, where there is bipartisan-
ship, where Democrats and Republican 
actually agree. 
I talked about the need to extend the 
PPP 
program—Paycheck 
Protection 
Program—which is helping small busi-
nesses keep their doors open, but it ex-
pired on August 8. A lot of small busi-
nesses are saying to me back home in 
Ohio: I am barely holding on. When is 
this coming? I need an extension to 
this program. 
Yet we can’t seem to get our act to-
gether here even though it is totally 
nonpartisan, as far as I can tell. 
The bill we voted on last Thursday 
also has more funding for something

desperately needed in my home State 
of Ohio and other States around the 
country, which is more money for test-
ing. It also has more money, by the 
way, for developing a vaccine more 
quickly and effectively and for getting 
these anti-viral therapies up and going. 
All of this is stuff we should be able to 
agree on, right? No, we haven’t been 
able to. 
Another thing that was in that bill 
last Thursday was providing funding 
for the schools so they can reopen—K– 
12 but also for our colleges and univer-
sities. These schools are starting to re-
open, and they need the help badly. Ac-
tually, it had enough funding in there 
that it was slightly more than the 
funding that was in the Heroes Act, the 
Democrats’ proposal, for the same pur-
pose—$105 billion. Why couldn’t we get 
together? 
What else did it have? It had some-
thing very important for a lot of people 
who lost their jobs through no fault of 
their own. It had an extension of the 
current Federal supplement for unem-
ployment insurance in the States. It 
had a $300-per-week, Federal-taxpayer- 
paid additional supplement on top of 
the roughly $350 that States already 
provide on average for unemployment. 
Yet that was rejected. 
We couldn’t even have a good vote to 
proceed on the bill, to have a debate on 
the bill so we could have an honest de-
bate and say, oh, $300 is too much, or it 
is not enough, or maybe the PPP pro-
gram needs to be slightly changed this 
way or that way, or maybe there is less 
money for schools needed or more 
money for schools. 
We couldn’t even get on the bill be-
cause you need 60 votes to do that, and 
we only had 52, which is a majority of 
this Chamber, but it is not the 60-vote 
supermajority. Fifty-two Republicans 
supported it. Unfortunately, no Demo-
crats were able to support it. I don’t 
get that because all we were saying 
was, let’s get on this bill and have a de-
bate, and if later on in the process you 
don’t like where we ended up, there is 
another 60-vote margin, and you can 
filibuster it again. 
We couldn’t even get on the bill to 
have a debate. To me, that is really sad 
because the American people weren’t 
given the opportunity to get some help, 
but also they weren’t given the oppor-
tunity to see what the differences are 
and have this out in the open. 
That is legislation that 52 Repub-
licans supported. We are ready to go. 
Let’s have the discussion. Let’s have 
the debate. 
The Federal funds to help the unem-
ployed get by was a particular concern 
of mine, and I want to focus on that to-
night. That unemployment benefit is a 
classic example of where Senate Demo-
crats have blocked what I think is a 
reasonable compromise—I will explain 
why I think that—and instead have de-
cided to provide nothing. Nothing. 
What we should do instead is we 
should embrace a compromise together 
for these families who continue to 
struggle to make ends meet because 
some people can’t go back to work still 
because their movie theater or their 
bowling alley or their motor coach 
company can’t hire them. Either they 
are shut down or they simply can’t hire 
them back. There are people who are 
unemployed who still need our help. 
Early on in this pandemic, both Re-
publicans and Democrats recognized 
this. We recognized the need to bolster 
the State-run unemployment insurance 
programs to help offset the massive job 
losses we saw in March and April. That 
is why the CARES Act we talked about 
earlier—this bipartisan bill—contained 
an unprecedented $600-per-week addi-
tional Federal supplement on top of 
the State supplement for 4 months. 
By the way, the State benefit in Ohio 
on average is $360. The $600 was on top 
of $360, coming up to $960 per week. We 
did that for a period of 4 months. That 
provided an important income source 
for a lot of people. It made a huge dif-
ference in the lives of a lot of people 
who early on couldn’t work because the 
government was actually closing down 
businesses, saying: You can’t open. 
Some say that was too much. We will 
talk about why they say that. But it 
was a big help, and it was appropriate 
in a sense at the time to do something 
that big because the government itself 
was saying: You are going to lose your 
job through no fault of your own. We 
the government are saying you have to 
shut down, so we are going to provide 
you an unemployment benefit. 
It was also used for other things—to 
pay rent, to pay that car payment, to 
just get by. 
As the year has gone on, we have 
made progress now on slowing the 
spread of the coronavirus, adding test-
ing, adding more personal protective 
gear, and so on. Many parts of our 
economy have been able to reopen in a 
safe and sustainable manner. And that 
is good. Without the help we provided 
in the legislation—the five bills we 
passed—we wouldn’t be so far along. 
They helped. They helped keep the 
doors open at a lot of small businesses. 
They helped provide the money for our 
healthcare system, for testing. 
With 
that 
reopening 
around 
the 
country, hiring picked back up, and 
now we have far fewer people on unem-
ployment than we did at the beginning 
of this pandemic. So there are fewer 
people who need unemployment insur-
ance. Unemployment is at about 8.4 
percent. That is what it was last 
month. That is down from over 15 per-
cent in the spring. Now, 8.4 percent is 
still too high, particularly compared to 
the record lows we saw just before this 
pandemic. It is more than twice what 
it was then. But it is undoubtedly a 
step in the right direction. Unemploy-
ment claims are either holding steady 
or dropping now in most States. That 
is good. 
With this positive progress we were 
seeing, I think it was fair for Congress 
to want to take another look at the 
original unemployment insurance sup-
plement, which expired at the end of 
July, and see whether there was a new 
supplement that we could continue to 
help those in need while better reflect-
ing this improved economy and the 
need for workers rather than a situa-
tion where the government was actu-
ally imposing shutdowns of much of 
our economy. 
That is where things broke down. At 
the end of July, the $600 supplement 
ended. Everybody knew it was going to 
end then. But Republicans and Demo-
crats couldn’t agree on how to best 
structure an additional UI supplement. 
By the way, having differences isn’t 
unusual around here. We have debates 
all the time. That debate was a big 
part of the negotiations in July and 
August. What is disappointing to me 
and to many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle and to so many people 
we represent is that instead of taking 
us up on our offer that we offered—to 
extend the $600 per week to be able the 
negotiate 
something, 
for 
2 
weeks, 
which would have put a lot of pressure 
on the negotiations—think about it— 
the Democrats said no. I don’t know 
why they said no, but Democrats would 
not even allow us to extend the $600 to 
put pressure on negotiations. Delib-
erately, they allowed these benefits to 
expire. It went from a $600 benefit on 
top of the State benefit to zero Federal 
benefit. 
Let me repeat that. Rather than 
work to agree on a weeklong extension 
of a lifeline for so many people to buy 
time to work something out, Demo-
crats instead chose to let these benefits 
expire and allowed millions of Ameri-
cans to go without benefits. 
When we hit this impasse on the UI 
issue 
that 
Congress 
just 
couldn’t 
break, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
stepped in, and President Trump quick-
ly signed an Executive order on August 
8—so a week after the benefit expired— 
which authorized FEMA, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, to 
begin distributing an emergency lost 
wage assistance unemployment check. 
So the government stepped in at the 
executive branch and said: You guys in 
Congress can’t figure this out. The $600 
has gone to zero, so you just have the 
State benefit now, and you have a lot 
of people still unemployed through no 
fault of their own. It is tough to get by 
on 360 bucks a week. 
So President Trump and his adminis-
tration stepped in and said: We will 
provide it temporarily—temporarily, 
because that is all the money they had 
through what is called the Wage As-
sistance Program. Under this program, 
$44 billion from the Disaster Relief 
Fund was made available to States to 
use as a supplement to their unemploy-
ment insurance programs—still leaving 
$25 billion, by the way, in that fund for 
natural disasters. 
I spoke to Labor Secretary Scalia on 
Friday. I asked him: Is there any 
money left in that fund? 
Remember, this was done on August 
8, and they had a limited amount of 
money.

He said: No, ROB. Actually, it was a 
temporary program, meant to be a 
bridge so Congress would get its act to-
gether between August 8 and now. 
So basically, in a month and a week, 
surely Congress would do something 
here, but we haven’t. Now, that money 
has run out. Now, people who were get-
ting the $600 benefit, down to zero, and 
then back up to $300, which most are 
getting in a lump sum because it takes 
a while to process this money—that 
$300 is now ending. No more $300-per- 
week Federal supplement. 
By the way, almost every State and 
territory except for two has applied for 
and received some of this funding from 
the Feds. Ohio was able to receive 
enough funding to cover 6 weeks of lost 
benefits, so basically from August 1 
until now. Ohio got $1.4 billion from 
the fund. It is sending out its unem-
ployment insurance benefits this week. 
Next week it ends because they have 
run out of money. They have used the 
Federal money. 
The $300 supplement has now ended. 
It is surely time for us to act. It would 
be timely this week and next week to 
now do something to provide for a sup-
plement for people who lost their job 
through no fault of their own. 
We could have solved this last Thurs-
day with the targeted relief bill that 
came to the floor for a vote that I 
talked about. The timing was perfect. 
We could have done that because part 
of the negotiations that we had among 
ourselves, Republicans, over this and 
with some Democrats, I suppose, was, 
what is the right level? What we came 
up with was $300. That was part of the 
bill that got 52 votes last Thursday but 
needed the 60 votes, and Democrats 
blocked it. Even though it got the ma-
jority of the Senate, it didn’t get the 
supermajority of 60 that it needed. 
Again, we couldn’t even get on the leg-
islation to talk about it. That $600 sup-
plement in this bill was changed to 
$300, which was consistent with where 
the administration has been over the 
last 5 or 6 weeks. That helps the vast 
majority of unemployed individuals 
make ends meet without driving our 
deficit even higher. 
The $600-a-week supplement was not 
sustainable over time, in part, because 
people were actually making more 
money on unemployment insurance 
than they were with their jobs. You 
were being paid more not to work than 
to work at $600 on top of the State ben-
efit. In fact, under that supplement of 
$600, the median wage earner in Amer-
ica received 134 percent more of his or 
her previous wages, making it harder, 
therefore, to jump back into the work-
place and get our economy moving 
again. 
By the way, I heard this all over 
Ohio, and I know every single one of 
my colleagues has. They heard it from 
businesses, particularly small busi-
nesses but also larger businesses. The 
Ford Motor Company told me they had 
a 25-percent absenteeism rate when I 
visited them over the August break be-
cause people weren’t coming back to 
work because of the benefit that they 
had been getting of $600. So it was felt 
in small businesses, yes, but also 
midsize and larger businesses and also 
a lot of nonprofits. 
I heard it from hospitals. I heard it 
from people who provide addiction 
services, recovery services, treatment 
programs. Nonprofits are having a hard 
time getting people to come back be-
cause, again, the $600 on top of the 
State benefit average of the, say, $350— 
$950 a week was more than they were 
able to pay them. People were making 
more on unemployment insurance than 
they were at work. This was as the 
economy was starting to pick up. We 
needed jobs. 
We said: How about $300? Why did we 
pick $300? Well, again, $600 is so gen-
erous that it is paying people more. By 
the way, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, a nonpartisan group here in Con-
gress, analyzes these things. They ana-
lyzed it and said, if you continue the 
$600 until next year, which is what the 
Democratic proposal is in their legisla-
tion, the Heroes Act—if you continue 
the $600 until next year, that would re-
sult in 8 out of 10 people on unemploy-
ment insurance getting paid more on 
unemployment insurance than they 
would at work, 80 percent. That is from 
the CBO. 
What is the right number instead of 
having 80 percent paid more by not 
working? Well, I think $300 is about the 
right number. Some could say that is 
too high, too, but the $300 on top of the 
State benefit was what was rejected 
last Thursday by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle. 
By the way, when 80 percent of peo-
ple are making more money by not 
working, it hurts everybody. It hurts 
these businesses. Small businesses and 
these nonprofits are not able to get 
people to come to work. Look at the 
‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs you may see in 
your own community. It hurts the 
economy when you don’t have this 
workforce and you don’t have these 
jobs coming back. 
It also hurts the workers. I think all 
of us should want to reconnect people 
to work. That is where people get their 
healthcare. If they have it, they are 
likely to get it at work. That is where 
about 80 percent of us get it. It is where 
people get their retirement, if they 
have it. We want more people to have 
that, but a 401(K) is going to be 
through work. This is where people get 
the training they need to keep up with 
what is happening with their job. It is 
where people connect with other peo-
ple. It is where people get self-respect 
and self-esteem by working. We should 
be encouraging work. 
Again, I think somewhere there is a 
number there where you are helping 
people who need the funds to be able to 
get by because they are unemployed 
through no fault of their own, yet you 
are not offering such a high benefit 
that it is more advantageous not to 
work. 
The $300-a-week amount offered last 
Thursday is generous compared to reg-
ular unemployment insurance. In Ohio, 
with the supplement, you go from $360 
a week State benefit to $660 per week. 
It is a big change. It makes a big dif-
ference in people’s lives. It would cover 
90 percent of the lost wages for the me-
dian worker nationwide. The $300 per 
week covers 90 percent of the lost 
wages, helping particularly low- and 
middle-income wage earners get by 
without creating, again, this $600 dis-
incentive to work. 
Even if $300 wasn’t the perfect solu-
tion, it was certainly a starting point. 
It was a policy point that could have 
been debated and amended on the floor 
had we gone to the legislation. Again, 
we were blocked even to go to the bill 
to talk about it. Democrats blocked us 
from debating it, and so people got 
nothing. They don’t get the $300, 
which, again, 90 percent of lost wages 
for the median-wage worker would 
have been replaced by that. But they 
get zero. All people are left with is the 
State benefit now. 
Again, unfortunately, in this place, 
politics was put ahead of the interest 
of struggling families who need extra 
help. It is stunning to me that this is 
the 
point 
we 
have 
reached 
in 
Congress’s 
work 
to 
address 
this 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Early on, there were so many bipar-
tisan victories we achieved because Re-
publicans and Democrats alike said: 
This is a crisis. We have to address this 
not as our party might want to do but 
as Americans—recognizing the severity 
of the challenge we were facing. It was 
encouraging to see us come together to 
craft the CARES Act, which passed 96 
to 0 and made a big difference. 
I had hoped we would be able to rec-
ognize from that victory the impor-
tance of hashing out our disagreements 
and coming up with a solution, finding 
common ground to be able to help 
those we represent. Unfortunately, the 
opposite has happened. Politics seem to 
have taken over. On the other side of 
the aisle, the Speaker of the House and 
others may think this is good politics 
for them not to move forward with 
something. 
Maybe 
they 
are 
right. 
Maybe it is good politics somehow, but 
it is not what is best for the American 
people. 
By 
opposing 
a 
reasonable 
com-
promise on unemployment insurance, 
as an example, what this Congress is 
doing is leaving the American people 
high and dry at the exact time that 
funding for these benefits has run out. 
Again, the short-term bridge that the 
administration provided, $300 a week, 
is running out. It doesn’t need to hap-
pen. Let’s come to the negotiating 
table this week and next week. We are 
going to be here next week. We are sup-
posed to vote on a continuing resolu-
tion, the funding program. We will be 
here. We know what the differences 
are. We know what the similarities are. 
We know how to put together a pack-
age. We know what it has to be and

SCHUMER and Senator WYDEN violated 
the Senate rules by attempting to offer 
a 
resolution 
disparaging 
oversight 
work being done by me and Senator 
JOHNSON. My colleague, Ranking Mem-
ber WYDEN, said that the investigation 
Senator JOHNSON and I are engaged in 
is advancing a Russian disinformation 
campaign. To be clear, that investiga-
tion is focused on potential conflicts of 
interest and other wrongdoing regard-
ing the time Vice President Biden was 
lead on the Obama administration’s 
Ukraine policy. At that same time, his 
son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of 
a corrupt Ukrainian gas firm called 
Burisma. This investigation is a good- 
government investigation to better un-
derstand the effect these potential con-
flicts had on policy execution. This in-
vestigation is based on Federal Govern-
ment records from the Obama adminis-
tration and records from a Democratic 
lobby shop, Blue Star Strategies. If 
those 
records 
are 
Russian 
disinformation, then that says more 
about the Obama administration than 
the purpose of this investigation. 
I have also addressed the claim that 
this investigation is somehow con-
nected to Andriy Derkach. I have said 
publicly on many occasions that I have 
never received information or material 
fom him. I have never solicited infor-
mation from him. The same is true for 
my staff. In fact, the only two times 
that I am aware of that my staff have 
come in contact with his information 
are, No. 1, when the Democrats intro-
duced his records into a transcribed 
interview, and No. 2, when Minority 
Leader SCHUMER, Speaker PELOSI, Sen-
ator 
WARNER, 
and 
Representative 
SCHIFF used it in their July 13, 2020, 
letter. 
They also attempted to link Andriy 
Telizhenko to Andriy Derkach, appar-
ently to cast him as a nefarious foreign 
agent, but they neglected to mention 
his many connections to the Obama- 
Biden administration, including White 
House 
meetings 
and 
outings 
with 
White House staff. They also omitted 
his work for Blue Star Strategies, 
which was working on behalf of the 
corrupt Ukrainian firm that hired Hun-
ter Biden while his father was the face 
of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Demo-
cratic connections to Mr. Telizhenko 
are many and well documented. If they 
are so concerned that he is a conduit 
for disinformation, why did they work 
with him for so long? 
Maybe the Democrats should take a 
pause and realize that they are the 
only 
ones 
pushing 
Russian 
disinformation. Let’s not forget about 
the Steele Dossier. Thanks to now-de-
classified information, we know the 
dossier 
was 
filled 
with 
Russian 
disinformation. The Democrats bought- 
and-paid-for crown jewel ironically was 
an example of the very disinformation 
and collusion that it falsely accused 
the Trump campaign of. The Demo-
crats pushed it for years. Now that it is 
a failed document, they have tried to 
run the same baseless smear tactic on 
this investigation. The facts simply 
aren’t on their side. If my colleagues 
on the other side are as concerned 
about foreign disinformation as they 
claim to be, they would stop relying on 
it to falsely attack us. Let’s stop play-
ing these games and get back to busi-
ness for the American people.

CONGRATULATING 
LOYOLA 
UNI-
VERSITY CHICAGO ON 150 YEARS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
year, Loyola University Chicago cele-
brates the 150th anniversary of its 
founding, which occurred on September 
5, 1870. Loyola Chicago is a world-class 
institution with a storied history as a 
Roman Catholic Jesuit university, a 
strong track record of academic excel-
lence, and the proud home of the Loy-
ola Ramblers. 
Loyola 
University 
Chicago 
was 
founded under the name of St. Ignatius 
College by Arnold Damen, S.J., to 
serve Chicago’s Catholic immigrants. 
In 1909, the school was granted a new 
charter by the State of Illinois and re-
named ‘‘Loyola University Chicago’’. 
That same year, the newly-named Loy-
ola Chicago granted its first profes-
sional graduate degrees and organized 
its first football, basketball, and indoor 
baseball teams. Today, Loyola Chicago 
is the only Jesuit Catholic university 
in Illinois. 
Throughout its history, Loyola Chi-
cago has upheld its Jesuit values— 
being an institution of rigorous liberal 
arts education and academic excel-
lence, while also being a place of inclu-
sion and acceptance for marginalized 
communities, including immigrants. 
Loyola Chicago’s Stritch School of 
Medicine led the country as the first 
medical school to accept DACA recipi-
ents, many of whom have committed to 
working in a medically-underserved 
community in Illinois after graduation. 
In addition, under its previous presi-
dent, Father Michael Garanzini, Loy-
ola Chicago created Arrupe College. 
Arrupe is a 2-year degree program that 
brings Loyola Chicago’s academic qual-
ity together with a focus on afford-
ability and care for the whole person. 
Arrupe’s 
low-cost 
and 
wrap-around 
services—including 
meals, 
chilcare, 
and transportation—bring a high-qual-
ity Loyola Chicago education to low- 
income and students of color in the 
Chicagoland area who otherwise may 
not have a chance to succeed in col-
lege. 
Loyola Chicago’s focus on service is 
part of the fabric of the institution and 
its community. Loyola Chicago sup-
ports more than 300 community part-
ner organizations in Chicago and the 
Chicagoland suburbs through student, 
staff, and faculty service and volunteer 
work. Loyola Chicago’s impact can be 
found 
almost 
anywhere 
in 
the 
Chicagoland area. 
Illinois has been served well and en-
riched by the many contributions of 
Loyola University Chicago. I look for-
ward to the school’s many contribu-
tions in the years ahead and several 
more successful runs at the NCAA bas-
ketball tournament being led by their 
team chaplain, the now world famous 
Jean Dolores Schmidt, known to all as 
simply Sister Jean. 
I thank Loyola for its many con-
tributions to our State and country. It 
is my distinct honor to congratulate 
President 
Jo 
Anne 
Rooney—the 
school’s first female president—and the 
entire Loyola community of staff, fac-
ulty, students, and alumni on your 
150th anniversary.

TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER 
EDWARD H. MURRAY 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the service of Com-
mander Edward H. Murray of the U.S. 
Navy on the occasion of his retirement 
after 20 years of Active Duty. I would 
like to briefly share with my col-
leagues some of the highlights of his 
fine career. 
For the past 20 years, Commander 
Murray excelled in leading Navy Sail-
ors as an E–2C naval flight officer. He 
served sea tours with VAW–116, deploy-
ing on the USS Constellation and USS 
Abraham Lincoln in support of coalition 
forces in Iraq and operations in the 
Western Pacific. He also deployed to 
the Western Pacific with VTC–12 on-
board the USS Bonhomme Richard, pro-
viding airspace and diplomatic coordi-
nation. Ashore, Commander Murray’s 
assignments included a special selec-
tion as aide-de-camp to the four-star 
commander of the U.S. Naval Forces in 
Naples, Italy, during operations in 
Kosovo and Libya. He also served my 
colleague, Senator TIM KAINE of Vir-
ginia, as a legislative fellow and then 
continued his service in the Navy Of-
fice of Legislative Affairs as deputy di-
rector of the Senate Liaison Office. 
I have gotten to know Commander 
Murray over the past 2 years through 
his assignment to the Navy’s Appro-
priations Matters Office. As a rep-
resentative of the Chief of Naval Oper-
ations and Secretary of the Navy, he 
provided valuable support to Members 
of the Senate and House Appropria-
tions Committees regarding the Navy’s 
budgetary needs. His efforts to provide 
timely and transparent information to 
the committees contributed to the en-
actment of the Defense Appropriations 
Acts for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Com-
mander Murray also provided superior 
support to me and many of my col-
leagues as we traveled across Europe 
and Asia conducting oversight of crit-
ical national security assets abroad. 
As Commander Murray departs the 
Pentagon, I want to take this oppor-
tunity to congratulate him on his re-
tirement; to thank him, his wife Aman-
da, and his family for their years of 
service; and to wish him the very best 
going forward.

REMEMBERING FIREMAN 2ND 
CLASS ALBERT RENNER 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, today, 
as he is buried in the North Dakota 
Veterans Cemetery just outside of his 
hometown of Mandan, ND, I honor the 
life and patriotism of Navy Fireman 
2nd Class Albert Renner. Like so many 
young men of this ‘‘greatest genera-
tion,’’ he answered the call to defend 
his country during World War II. On 
December 7, 1941, at the age of 24, he 
made the ultimate sacrifice along with 
2,402 other soldiers and sailors during 
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. 
He was serving on the USS West Vir-
ginia, which sank after being hit by at 
least seven torpedoes and two bombs. 
Last year, aided by a positive DNA 
sent by his surviving siblings several 
decades ago, Albert Renner’s remains 
were finally positively identified. On 
Tuesday, his body arrived at the Min-
neapolis airport. A full military escort 
motorcade carrying his casket traveled 
the 400 miles home to Mandan. Many 
citizens, including veterans and fire 
and police men and women, stopped 
along the highway to solemnly pay 
their respects as the motorcade passed 
by. 
Attending today’s funeral service and 
burial are members of his family who 
have traveled from across the Nation 
to pay their respects to this beloved 
member of their family. Even though 
many of them never met him, together 
they are mourning the lost blessings of 
Albert not being a part of their family 
for the past 79 years. 
Albert could have had a rewarding 
life on the family farm or in some 
other profession. He could have had a 
wife and family and home of his own. 
His burial service today is a poignant 
reminder of how the sacrifice of heroes 
defending our Nation have an impact 
far into the future on those who knew 
and loved them—and those who never 
will. 
Navy 
Fireman 
2nd 
Class 
Albert 
Renner died so Americans could live in 
peace and prosperity. He is now back in 
his home State, lying in eternal rest 
with other North Dakota heroes. I 
thank the many patriots who are com-
mitted to identifying the remains of all 
unknown American service members 
and bringing them home. 
To the family of Navy Fireman 2nd 
Class Albert Renner, I join citizens 
across our State and Nation in sending 
our sincere condolences. It is heroes 
like Albert who have kept our commu-
nities, State, Nation, and world safe. 
His life made a difference in the lives 
of all of us. We are forever grateful.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
ZOEY’S CONGENITAL CATARACT 
AWARENESS DAY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, a special 
little girl named Zoey is celebrating 
her first birthday on September 28, 
2020. In recognition of this day, Spen-
cer County Judge Executive John Riley 
is declaring it as Zoey’s Congenital 
Cataract Awareness Day. It is the hope 
of her parents that every primary care 
clinician in Spencer County, the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky, and beyond, is 
aware of this rare cause of blindness 
that can be surgically treated when di-
agnosed early enough. As an ophthal-
mologist, I have had the privilege of 
participating in these surgeries and 
know how life-changing early interven-
tion can be. Fortunately for Zoey, after 
three surgeries, she has a very prom-
ising prognosis. I am honored to help 
make Zoey’s birthday wish come true 
by sharing her story and thereby rais-
ing awareness for the early detection 
and treatment of congenital cata-
racts.∑

Trinity attracts tourists and locals 
alike and has developed a reputation 
for its quality food, service, and views 
of Lake Pend Oreille. In addition to 
serving quality southern cuisine, the 
restaurant also provides dozens of local 
jobs and enhances the cultural richness 
of Northern Idaho through their day- 
to-day service and steady participation 
in community events. 
In recent months, Trinity at City 
Beach has done their part to reduce the 
spread of COVID–19, offering carryout 
and dine-in eating to the Sandpoint 
community while safely maintaining 
CDC social distancing and face cov-
ering guidelines. Additionally, Dick 
and his team have raised money and 
collected food to be donated to non-
profit organizations and healthcare 
centers in the Sandpoint area to help 
ease the burden on frontline workers. 
Congratulations to Justin Dick and 
all of the employees of Trinity at City 
Beach on being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for Sep-
tember 2020. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–234. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey expressing op-
position to the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development’s proposed changes to 
the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing 
Rule adopted in 2015; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 76 
Whereas, In 2015, the United States Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development 
(‘‘HUD’’) adopted an Affirmatively Fur-
thering Fair Housing (‘‘AFFH’’) rule that es-
tablished a new framework for HUD funding 
recipients to meet their longstanding legal 
obligation under the federal Fair Housing 
Act to reduce barriers to fair housing and 
equal opportunity; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule was promulgated 
in response to the recommendations of the 
United States Government Accountability 
Office and affected stakeholders centered on 
the need for HUD to bolster its fair housing 
planning obligations by providing greater 
clarity and support to HUD funding recipi-
ents and facilitating local decision-making 
on fair housing priorities and goals; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule achieves these 
ends by providing clearer standards for meet-
ing fair housing obligations, greater trans-
parency, increased access to data concerning 
fair housing conditions and access to oppor-
tunity, and new mapping and customizable 
assessment tools, as well as by encouraging 
collaboration between jurisdictions and com-
munity input and participation; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule ultimately serves 
to help HUD funding recipients take mean-
ingful actions to overcome historic patterns 
of segregation, promote fair housing choice, 
and foster inclusive communities that are 
free from discrimination; and 
Whereas, On August 9, 2018, HUD issued an 
advance notice of a proposed rulemaking 
that would undo much of the AFFH rule for 
the stated reasons that the rule impeded the 
development and rehabilitation of affordable 
housing and provided inadequate autonomy 
to HUD funding recipients; and 
Whereas, The AFFH rule has not been in 
effect long enough to adequately assess its 
effect on the development and rehabilitation 
of affordable housing, the rule does not in 
fact dictate how communities should meet 
their fair housing obligations, and the rule 
has produced concrete improvements in fair 
housing, such as the commitment of Chester 
County, Pennsylvania to reduce the number 
of Section 8 recipients living in high-poverty 
census tracts by five percentage points; and 
Whereas, It is altogether fitting, proper, 
and in the public interest, for this House to 
express opposition to HUD’s proposed rule-
making that would upend the AFFH rule and 
exacerbate housing inequities in both this 
State and across the United States; now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This House expresses its opposition to 
and disapproval of the United States Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development’s 
proposed rulemaking revising its Affirma-
tively Furthering Fair Housing rule adopted 
in 2015. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States, the United States Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, and each mem-
ber of Congress elected from this State. 
POM–235. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey 
urging the United States Congress and the 
President of the United States to eliminate 
funding disparities among land-grant insti-
tutions of higher education; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions. 
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 125 
Whereas, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs) have been providing a 
crucial means for the educational and eco-
nomic advancement of African-Americans 
for more than a century; and 
Whereas, By serving the African-American 
community, HBCUs serve all Americans by 
preparing gifted young men and women to 
achieve their dreams and succeed in their 
life goals; and 
Whereas, Today, there are more than 100 
HBCUs in the United States, all of which em-
body many of our most deeply cherished val-
ues such as equality, diversity, opportunity, 
and hard work; and 
Whereas, HBCUs have their roots in the 
federal Morrill Act of 1862, which required 
that each state have at least one land-grant 
institution. Historically, most of these insti-
tutions have been predominantly white. 
Since African-Americans were barred from 
many of these land-grant institutions, a sec-
ond Morrill Act was adopted in 1890 requiring 
states to show that race was not a factor in 
the admission criteria of land-grant institu-
tions or else they would lose federal funding; 
and 
Whereas, Instead of unifying the institu-
tions, some states opted to create separate 
land-grant colleges for African-Americans, 
which allowed those states to keep seg-
regated colleges and at the same time not 
lose federal funding; and 
Whereas, 1890 land-grant institutions—HBC 
Us—have largely received less funding per 
student when compared to their 1862 land- 
grant counterparts, in some instances receiv-
ing only half the funding given to other in-
stitutions; and 
Whereas, It should be a public policy goal 
of the federal government to enact laws 
aimed at eliminating the existing funding in-
equity between HBCUs and 1862 land-grant 
institutions; and 
Whereas, By increasing funding to HBCUs, 
the federal government would be providing 
vital support to these institutions as they 
continue their endeavor to improve the qual-
ity of life of African-Americans by providing 
them with high quality education; and 
Whereas, It is important, therefore, that 
Congress and the President of the United 
States enact legislation which eliminates 
the existing funding inequities between 
HBCUs and 1862 land-grant institutions in 
order to have equal education opportunity 
through equal funding for all land-grant in-
stitutions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the General Assembly of the State 
of New Jersey: 
1. The General Assembly of the State of 
New Jersey respectfully urges Congress and 
the President of the United States to enact 
legislation aimed at eliminating the existing 
funding inequity between Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities, which are the 1890 
land-grant institutions of higher education, 
and the 1862 land-grant institutions of higher 
education. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the 
President and Vice-President of the United 
States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and 
Minority Leader of the United States House 
of Representatives, and to every member of 
New Jersey’s Congressional delegation. 
POM–236. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
United States Congress to explore further 
avenues of relief for businesses affected by 
the COVID–19 pandemic; to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 130 
Whereas, The COVID–19 Pandemic has dra-
matically affected Michigan and the United 
States. The first cases in Michigan were re-
ported on March 10, 2020, and since these ini-
tial reports more than 56,000 cases have been 
confirmed and more than 5,000 Michiganders 
have 
lost 
their 
lives 
to 
the 
novel 
coronavirus. Nationally, there have been 
more than 1.7 million cases and 100,000 
deaths; and 
Whereas, Mitigating the spread of the virus 
has required extraordinary public health

September 16, 2020 
measures. Governor Gretchen Whitmer has 
issued executive orders prohibiting large 
gatherings, closing all primary and sec-
ondary schools, and requiring the temporary 
closure of all nonessential businesses. At the 
federal level, the White House Coronavirus 
Task Force’s guidelines recommended the 
closure of places where people gather, in-
cluding businesses, where there is evidence 
of community transmission. While some in-
dustries and regions of the state have begun 
to partially reopen, it is unclear how long 
mitigation measures will be necessary before 
normal operations can resume; and 
Whereas, These measures have greatly im-
pacted the livelihoods of business owners 
across the state and our nation. With the 
forced closures, small business owners have 
been forced to lay off workers and forgo in-
come for months, while still needing to 
make payments for utilities, mortgages and 
rent, and other expenses. According to a sur-
vey by the Small Business Administration of 
Michigan, one in seven, or about 14 percent, 
of small businesses are not confident that 
they will survive the Pandemic. Nationally, 
a survey found that 7.5 million small busi-
nesses are at risk of shutting down; and 
Whereas, Federal and state governments 
have a responsibility to assist small busi-
nesses since government mitigation meas-
ures, while for the greater good, contributed 
significantly to the current economic crisis. 
The economic uncertainty and devastation 
caused by the COVID–19 Pandemic and the 
related mitigation policies are not the fault 
of small business owners. It would be unjust 
to fail to help them and to allow them to 
bear an unfair share of the burden of address-
ing this crisis; and 
Whereas, The failure of these businesses 
could have wide ranging negative effects for 
Michigan and the United States. Since the 
beginning of the crisis, more than 40 million 
Americans have filed for unemployment, in-
cluding more than 1.7 million in Michigan. If 
small businesses are unable to reopen, many 
of these claimants may not be able to return 
to work, magnifying the already devastating 
economic impact of COVID–19; and 
Whereas, The small business relief already 
enacted by Congress is not sufficient to miti-
gate these effects. As part of the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) 
Act, Congress created the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program (PPP) to provide loans to 
small businesses. Even though additional 
money was subsequently appropriated to the 
program, the PPP has been unable to prove 
relief to millions of small businesses that 
have been affected by the crisis: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we memori-
alize the Congress of the United States to ex-
plore further avenues of relief for businesses 
affected by the COVlD–19 Pandemic; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–237. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
and the President of the United States to im-
mediately send humanitarian aid to Lebanon 
in response to the Beirut port explosion; to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 303 
Whereas, On August 4, 2020, a cache of the 
chemical 
substance 
ammonium 
nitrate 
which was being stored in a warehouse on 
the Pon of Beirut in Lebanon caught fire, re-
sulting in an explosion that killed more than 
150 people and wounded over 5,000 others. Ac-
cording to experts, the blast registered on 
seismographs at 3.3, and the blast was the 
third most powerful explosion in history 
after Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan dur-
ing World War II; and 
Whereas, In addition to the tragic loss of 
life, the explosion has largely destroyed the 
port and its infrastructure, which was re-
sponsible for 60 percent of Lebanon’s imports 
and was one of the largest and busiest ports 
on the eastern Mediterranean Sea. As a re-
sult of the explosion, most of the city’s grain 
reserves and food imports were destroyed, 
which is likely to cause widespread food in-
security for years to come. In addition, the 
city of Beirut is suffering billions in dam-
ages, with the explosion shattering glass as 
far as 15 miles from the scene. In response to 
the widespread devastation from the blast, a 
two-week state of emergency has been de-
clared; and 
Whereas, The people of Lebanon were al-
ready suffering from daily power outages, a 
lack of safe drinking water, food and fuel 
shortages, and limited public health care be-
fore the explosion. The COVID–19 Pandemic 
exacerbated these issues, resulting in Leb-
anon’s worst economic crisis since the 1975– 
1990 Civil War. Now with the devastation 
from the explosion, it has become nearly im-
possible for the Lebanese people to obtain 
basic human rights without humanitarian 
aid; and 
Whereas, Rescue efforts have been ham-
pered by the lack of electricity, and medical 
professionals are stitching the wounded in 
the streets under their cellphone lights. Pub-
lic Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Leb-
anon’s health sector is short of beds and 
Jacked the equipment necessary lo treat the 
injured and care for patients in critical con-
dition. 
Meanwhile, 
many 
buildings 
and 
homes have been reduced to an uninhabit-
able mess of glass, leaving as many as 300.000 
people homeless. Furthermore, the toxic 
gases released from the explosion. combined 
with the impact of COVID–19 and the thick 
Mediterranean summer air, have created a 
deeply oppressive atmosphere where the peo-
ple of Beirut cannot breathe; and 
Whereas, Lebanon’s Prime Minister Hassan 
Diab and his government have stepped down 
after citing mass corruption that contrib-
uted to the disaster. Before the resignation,

DAINES, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
ROUNDS, Mr. CORNYN, Ms. MCSALLY, 
and Mr. PORTMAN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 697 
Whereas the cowardly attack on 2 Los An-
geles County Sheriff’s Department deputies 
on September 12, 2020, is the latest example 
of an alarming trend of targeted violence to-
ward Federal, State, and local law enforce-
ment officers; 
Whereas, as of September 11, 2020, the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation reported that 37 
law enforcement officers have been feloni-
ously killed in the United States in 2020, rep-
resenting a more than 20 percent increase in 
law enforcement homicides compared to the 
same period last year; 
Whereas more than 800,000 sworn law en-
forcement officers in the United States per-
form innumerable daily acts of bravery and 
service for their communities that often go 
entirely unreported; 
Whereas radical politicians, reckless media 
figures, and organized protest movements 
bent on sowing civil unrest have sought to 
vilify and denigrate the courageous men and 
women of our law enforcement agencies, 
while inciting, encouraging, or celebrating 
widespread criminal activity and violence 
against law enforcement officers; 
Whereas crime rates, including rates of 
violent crime, have dramatically risen in 
several cities across the United States as 
radical politicians pursue a dangerous cam-
paign to ‘‘defund the police’’, starving law 
enforcement agencies of much-needed re-
sources to combat the growing threat to 
their communities; 
Whereas maintaining law and order is fun-
damental to the safety, security, and pros-
perity of our communities; and 
Whereas now is the time to ‘‘Back the 
Blue’’, and express our full-throated support 
for the selfless work of our courageous law 
enforcement officers who protect all law- 
abiding citizens against the threats posed by 
criminals and violent domestic groups inter-
ested in sowing chaos and destruction: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses gratitude to the brave men 
and women of our Federal, State, and local 
law enforcement agencies who selflessly 
serve their communities; 
(2) stands united to ‘‘Back the Blue’’ and 
support the law enforcement agencies and of-
ficers that stand on the front lines every day 
to maintain law and order so that our com-
munities can prosper; 
(3) condemns the perpetrators, instigators, 
and celebrators of violence against law en-
forcement officers; and 
(4) calls for the people of the United States 
to— 
(A) denounce the recent cowardly attack 
on the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment deputies; 
(B) assist in the identification and appre-
hension of the criminal who perpetrated the 
cowardly attack; and 
(C) pray for the speedy and full recovery of 
the deputies.

CORD 
IN-
JURY AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Ms. 
BALDWIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 698 
Whereas approximately 294,000 individuals 
in the United States live with spinal cord in-
juries, which cost society billions of dollars 
in health care costs and lost wages; 
Whereas there are approximately 17,810 
new spinal cord injuries in the United States 
each year; 
Whereas more than 42,000 individuals with 
spinal cord injuries are veterans; 
Whereas motor vehicle accidents are the 
leading cause of spinal cord injuries; 
Whereas nearly half of all spinal cord inju-
ries to individuals 30 years of age or younger 
occur as a result of motor vehicle accidents; 
Whereas the average remaining years of 
life for individuals living with spinal cord in-
juries has not improved significantly since 
the 1980s; 
Whereas there is an urgent need to develop 
new neuroprotection, pharmacological, and 
regeneration treatments to reduce, prevent, 
and reverse paralysis; and 
Whereas increased education and invest-
ment in research are key factors in improv-
ing outcomes for individuals living with spi-
nal cord injuries, enhancing the quality of 
life of individuals with spinal cord injuries, 
and ultimately curing paralysis: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month; 
(3) continues to support research to find 
better treatments, therapies, and a cure for 
spinal cord injuries; 
(4) supports clinical trials for new thera-
pies that offer promise and hope to individ-
uals living with paralysis; and 
(5) commends the dedication of national, 
regional, and local organizations, research-
ers, doctors, volunteers, and people across 
the United States who are working to im-
prove the quality of life of individuals living 
with spinal cord injuries and their families.

for every citizen of the United States and are 
honored in public schools across the United 
States on Constitution Day, which is Sep-
tember 17 of each year; 
Whereas the rule of law, the social com-
pact, 
democracy, 
liberty, 
equality, 
and 
unalienable human rights are the essential 
values upon which the United States flour-
ishes; 
Whereas diversity is one of the greatest 
strengths of the United States, and the 
motto inscribed on the Great Seal of the 
United States, ‘‘E pluribus unum’’, Latin for 
‘‘out of many, one’’, symbolizes that individ-
uals in the United States from all walks of 
life are unified by shared values;

George Washington, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 
Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, Harriet Tub-

Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions 
signed in Seneca Falls, New York, the Get-
tysburg Address, the Emancipation Procla-
mation, and the ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech de-
livered by Martin Luther King, Jr., express 
sentiments that have advanced liberty in the 
United States; and 
Whereas the Bennington flag (commonly 
known as the ‘‘’76 flag’’), the Betsy Ross flag, 
the current flag of the United States, the 
flag of the women’s suffrage movement, the 
Union flag (commonly known as the ‘‘Fort 
Sumter flag’’), the Gadsden flag, and the 
flags of the States are physical symbols of 
the history of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. RUBIO, and Mr. 
KAINE) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 700 
Whereas estuary regions cover only 13 per-
cent of the land area in the continental 
United States but contain nearly 43 percent 
of the population, 40 percent of the jobs, and 
nearly 50 percent of the economic output of 
the United States; 
Whereas the oceans, estuaries, and Great 
Lakes of the United States continue to fuel 
economic growth across the United States, 
which is evidenced by the fact that, by 2016— 
(1) employment levels in economic sectors 
relating to oceans and estuaries had in-
creased by 14.5 percent from employment 
levels in those sectors in 2007, before the 
Great Recession; and 
(2) the average employment level of the en-
tire economy of the United States had in-
creased by 4.8 percent from that employment 
level in 2007, before the Great Recession; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2016, economic 
sectors relating to estuaries, oceans, and 
Great Lakes in the United States— 
(1) created 85,000 new jobs; 
(2) employed 3,300,000 individuals; and 
(3) contributed $124,000,000,000 to the gross 
domestic product; 
Whereas, by 2018, the ocean economy sup-
ported 2,300,000 jobs in the United States, and 
the compensation paid to employees in such 
sector was $161,900,000,000; 
Whereas the commercial and recreational 
fishing industries support more than 1,740,000 
jobs in the United States; 
Whereas, in 2017— 
(1) commercial and recreational saltwater 
fishing in the United States generated more 
than $244,000,000,000 in sales and contributed 
$110,700,000,000 to the gross domestic product 
of the United States; 
(2) angler trip expenditures totaled nearly 
$10,500,000,000; and

across the United States, and contributed 
$41,500,000,000 to the gross domestic product 
of the United States; 
Whereas estuaries provide vital habitats 
for— 
(1) countless species of fish and wildlife, in-
cluding more than 68 percent of the commer-
cial fish catch in the United States by value 
and 80 percent of the recreational fish catch 
in the United States by weight; and 
(2) many species that are listed as threat-
ened or endangered species; 
Whereas estuaries provide critical eco-
system services that protect human health 
and public safety, including water filtration, 
flood control, shoreline stabilization, erosion 
prevention, and the protection of coastal 
communities during hurricanes, storms, and 
other extreme weather events; 
Whereas, by the 1980s, the United States 
had already lost more than 50 percent of the 
wetlands that existed in the original 13 colo-
nies; 
Whereas some bays in the United States 
that were once filled with fish and oysters 
have become dead zones filled with excess 
nutrients, chemical waste, and marine de-
bris; 
Whereas harmful algal blooms are hurting 
fish, wildlife, and human health and are 
causing serious ecological and economic 
harm to some estuaries; 
Whereas changes in sea levels can affect 
estuarine water quality and estuarine habi-
tats; 
Whereas section 320 of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1330) (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Clean Water Act’’) au-
thorizes the development of comprehensive 
conservation and management plans to en-
sure that the designated uses of estuaries are 
protected and to restore and maintain— 
(1) the chemical, physical, and biological 
integrity of estuaries; 
(2) water quality; 
(3) a balanced indigenous population of 
shellfish, fish, and wildlife; and 
(4) recreational activities in estuaries; 
Whereas the Coastal Zone Management 
Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) provides 
that the policy of the United States is to 
preserve, protect, develop, and, if possible, 
restore or enhance the resources of the 
coastal zone of the United States, including 
estuaries, for current and future generations; 
Whereas 29 coastal and Great Lakes States 
and territories of the United States operate 
or contain a National Estuary Program or a 
National Estuarine Research Reserve; 
Whereas scientific study leads to a better 
understanding of the benefits of estuaries to 
human and ecological communities; 
Whereas the Federal Government, State, 
local, and Tribal governments, national and 
community organizations, and individuals 
work together to effectively manage the es-
tuaries of the United States; 
Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore 
natural infrastructure in local communities 
in a cost-effective manner, helping to create 
jobs and reestablish the natural functions of 
estuaries that yield countless benefits; and 
Whereas the week of September 19 through 
September 26, 2020, is recognized as ‘‘Na-
tional Estuaries Week’’ to increase aware-
ness among all people of the United States, 
including Federal Government and State, 
local, and Tribal government officials, about 
the importance of healthy estuaries and the 
need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 19 
through September 26, 2020, as ‘‘National Es-
tuaries Week’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-

dermine the health of estuaries; 
(5) applauds the work of national and com-
munity organizations and public partners 
that 
promote 
public 
awareness, 
under-
standing, protection, and restoration of estu-
aries; 
(6) supports the scientific study, preserva-

WILDFIRES 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, the West 
is on fire. At this very moment, his-
toric wildfires are raging across our 
Western 
States. 
Communities 
have 
been devastated. Homes have been de-
stroyed. Businesses have been turned 
to rubble. In the wake of these disas-
ters, many families have been left with 
absolutely nothing. 
Nevadans are no strangers to seeing 
wildfires wreak havoc in our State. 
Just this year, Nevada has seen over 
650 fires. Yet what is happening now is 
something different. These are some of 
the largest fires the West has ever 
seen. Already, in 2020, over 4.7 million 
acres of land have been burned across

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5677 
September 16, 2020 
our Nation, and we have already seen 
billions of dollars in economic losses 
and damage. 
Despite what you might hear from 
our President, these disasters are not 
blue State issues. That kind of partisan 
sentiment is just unconscionable. We 
must take a nonpartisan approach to 
saving lives and protecting property 
from fires that know no partisan affili-
ation. It doesn’t matter that these fires 
are in the State of California or in the 
State of Oregon or in the State of 
Washington or in the State of Idaho. 
These disasters are happening in our 
United States. These fires are impact-
ing our communities, and in this time 
of crisis, we have a responsibility to 
really help one another—to help our 
communities and to help our friends 
and our neighbors. 
People have died in these disasters, 
and some people are still missing. Over 
30,000 courageous men and women are 
risking their lives to fight these fires 
and to save those families and save 
those properties. I am really proud to 
say that Nevada’s firefighters have 
been deployed to assist in combating 
many of these disasters. I am so proud 
of them. 
As a result of these fires, the air 
quality in some of our communities is 
so poor and so unhealthy that it is ex-
ceeding 20-year records. This toxic haze 
has already impacted air quality in my 
own State of Nevada, and it is not just 
in Western States. This harmful smoke 
is spreading. It has been measured as 
far away as the east coast—in places 
like New York City and right here in 
Washington, DC. These fires put our 
collective health—all of ours—in jeop-
ardy, especially now, during the pan-
demic. 
As I have said before, these fires im-
pact every single one of us. Do you 
know why? It is because this is an envi-
ronmental issue; this is an economic 
issue; this is a public health issue; and 
it is absolutely a climate issue. 
The science speaks for itself. Climate 
change and increased temperatures di-
rectly correlate to the growing inten-
sity of these wildfires, and the longer 
we fail to address climate change, the 
more costly and more dangerous and 
deadly the impact is going to be for our 
friends, our neighbors, our States, and 
our communities. 
September is wildfire preparedness 
month, and make no mistake: We need 
to get a handle on these disasters. We 
need to provide resources to our local 
communities, to our firefighters, and 
to our land management agencies im-
mediately. This is why I cosponsored 
my colleague Senator HARRIS’ Wildfire 
Defense Act, which is legislation that 
would provide FEMA resources so that 
our local communities can develop 
wildfire defense plans and allow all of 
us to respond more effectively. 
We also need to address climate 
change, and we need to be proactive 
and practical, which is why, earlier 
this year, I cosponsored Senator CAR-
PER’s climate change resolution. This 
resolution 
recognizes 
that 
climate 
change is real, that human activity is 
the primary cause, and that Congress 
must take immediate action to address 
one of the most pressing issues of our 
time. 
We need to act. Lives are on the line, 
and we need to act now. Nevada, the 
West, and Americans across the coun-
try are counting on all of us. So we 
need to get to work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
WILDFIRES 
Mr. 
MERKLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
apocalypse, fire, fueled by wind coming 
over the top of the Cascade Mountains, 
turning into a blowtorch that races 
down the western slopes of those moun-
tains, incinerating the towns in its 
path—that is what is happening in my 
home State of Oregon. 
Imagine suddenly waking up at 4:30 
in the morning to a house filled with 
smoke. You realize you have to clear 
the area before the situation gets a lot 
worse. You and your partner race to 
pack up some essentials, load them and 
your pets into the car in your garage, 
and then you can’t get the garage door 
open because there is no power. The 
power lines have been taken down by 
the winds and by the power poles being 
burned and falling over. So you open 
the garage door by hand, and just as 
you are about to lift it, you look out a 
little window, and you see an inferno 
engulfing your neighbor’s home. So 
you make a desperate dash in the other 
direction and out the backdoor—the 
fire at your heels. You race toward the 
river at the bottom of the hill, hop-
ing—praying—there will be some kind 
of safety. 
It is a terrifying scenario, but it is 
not out of some movie. For Larry Trip-
oli and Fran Howe, of Gates, OR, it was 
a reality just a few nights ago when 
the Beachie Creek fire roared through 
Santiam Canyon, incinerating homes, 
businesses, and entire neighborhoods. 
They got to the river, and they waded 
knee deep in the water as the trees 
burned around them on both banks. 
Fran recalled: ‘‘I thought we were 
going to die.’’ 
Fortunately, help arrived late that 
night, just before 12 midnight. The fire-
fighters and emergency workers risked 
their lives and safety to come and res-
cue those who were fleeing the fire. 
Many folks worked to help their neigh-
bors get noticed even as the fire was 
descending on the town. 
At this moment, all across Oregon, 
people are facing similarly terrifying 
experiences as historic wildfires have 
burned more than a million acres— 
more than twice those burned in a nor-
mal year. They burned in a small pe-
riod of time—most of them over this 
past week. There are 10 citizens who 
have lost their lives, and dozens are 
missing. We are afraid there will be 
more bad news to come. 
It is hard to imagine. I mean, I have 
seen the results of a fire near John Day 
that came down a valley, and there 
were widely spaced homes in the forest 
on both sides of the river, and I have 
seen that those homes were burned. 
But I have never seen anything like 
this—neighborhood after neighborhood, 
the commercial district, the apartment 
complexes, the mobile home housing 
parks, 
completely 
scorched—every 
building you can see. 
When I toured this last Friday, the 
only thing I could compare it to were 
pictures I had seen of Hiroshima after 
the bomb; cities in Europe that had 
been firebombed, like Dresden—mas-
sive devastation, incinerating every-
thing. 
This is what has just happened in my 
home State. In one town of Phoenix, 
OR—this is a picture from Phoenix. 
The mayor estimated that perhaps 
1,000 residences had been burned be-
tween the mobile homes, the manufac-
tured homes, the apartment complexes, 
and the standalone houses—several 
thousand people with nothing to return 
to. 
You know, I met with folks last Fri-
day and Saturday as Senator WYDEN 
and I started in the north part of the 
State and went all the way down south. 
I traveled 600 miles by car. I was driv-
ing. I never got out of the smoke. I re-
member fires where we passed 20 miles 
through the smoke, 30 miles through 
the smoke. I drove over 600 miles. I was 
never out of that smoke. 
Parts of the State glowed like the 
aftereffects of a bomb. This is our 
State capital with that orange, fire-in-
fused sky behind it in Salem, OR, the 
result of the Santiam fire that comes 
down toward the city of Salem. 
That smoke doesn’t just hover and 
stay in one place. As the wind starts to 
blow, it spreads across the country. So 
here we are. This is the September 15 
fire chart. These purple areas—an 
index of over 500 parts per million—in-
credibly unhealthy to breathe, and you 
can see the State of Oregon covered, on 
through Idaho and Montana, right on 
across the country—California. 
Everyone is dealing with the smoke. 
I just got off a Zoom call just a little 
while ago, and the first three people 
who spoke were talking about how un-
comfortable they were because of their 
asthma or breathing conditions af-
fected by the smoke. The air quality in 
Portland has ranked as the worst 
among the world’s major cities for the 
last 5 days in a row, and in smaller 
towns across the State, it has been far 
worse. 
People saw all kinds of dramatic, 
powerful scenes of the approaching 
fires, the approaching bank of clouds. 
It was a week ago Monday that I de-
cided to drive up to the Columbia 
Gorge. I didn’t get 20 miles from my 
house, and I saw this wall of smoke. So 
I got off the freeway and took the old 
scenic highway up to Crown Point—a 
lookout point high in the cliffs where 
you can see way to the east and way to

September 16, 2020 
the west—just to see that. What is 
going on with this massive cloud? You 
could see how dramatic the approach-
ing smoke cloud was from these fires. 
As we think about these devastating 
fires, we have to think about them in 
terms of the individuals who have been 
so dramatically affected. Some have 
been injured by the fires; some have 
been killed by the fires. 
So as Senator WYDEN and I proceeded 
from the northern border to the south-
ern border to visit fire refugees in dif-
ferent centers that have been set up 
and to visit some coordinated care 
briefings and then to visit two towns— 
Phoenix and Talent—that had been in-
cinerated, the most powerful moment 
was sitting down at a table with indi-
viduals along the way. 
I took away this collective impres-
sion: individuals who had escaped and 
were just thinking, my goodness, how 
fortunate I am that I got out with my 
life; individuals who had escaped, but 
they didn’t know the fate of their fam-
ily members who may not have es-
caped. One father lost the grandmother 
in the family and his son, who died in 
a car with the family dog in the son’s 
lap, and as he was going to search for 
his wife, he met a woman on the road. 
He said, ‘‘I am searching for my wife,’’ 
and she responded, ‘‘I am your wife.’’ 
Because she was so affected by the 
smoke and burned by the fire, he didn’t 
recognize her. 
I met folks who realized that they 
had escaped but also recognized that 
every 
single 
thing—a 
lifetime 
of 
records, photos, film, financial records, 
family heirlooms—all of it, everything, 
gone. 
So the issues become even more com-
plicated. Think about the children who 
were just starting school when these 
Labor Day fires descended. They lost 
their laptops; they lost their tablets 
after being coached on how to attend 
school electronically. The family has 
lost, perhaps, their funds, and now they 
are driving 40, 60 miles to family or to 
a friend’s house. How do they sign up 
for school? How do they deal with the 
stress that is on them from what has 
happened and the remaining stress of 
the impact on the family and those 
they are still searching for? 
And food—road closures stop the 
movement of food from getting to 
them, getting to stores and restaurants 
and communities. There are food short-
ages because they can’t be resupplied. 
Whether 
it 
is 
Breitenbush 
Hot 
Springs, one of our State’s most be-
loved resorts, losing half of its build-
ings or Simple Machine Winery in Tal-
ent burning to the ground—this is an 
adjacent city, Phoenix and Talent. One 
woman told me: I not only lost every-
thing, I lost my job because the busi-
ness I work at has burned to the 
ground as well. This is on top of the 
pandemic, and this is on top of the eco-
nomic implosion. 
Many of the residences that burned 
were those that served lower income 
citizens—the mobile home parks, the 
manufactured housing parks where the 
houses are closer together and the fire-
proofing of the walls is less than re-
quired in stick-built houses. Apart-
ment complexes—I saw this whole field 
where you could see steel girders going 
up two stories and crossbeams at the 
top of the steel and then steel stairs 
and nothing else. They were almost 
like a sculpture standing in the middle 
of the field, and there was one after an-
other, after another in the heart of 
these apartment complexes. The apart-
ments were completely gone. 
I also heard on this trip such appre-
ciation for our local leaders and our 
first responders—the firefighters, the 
EMTs, the National Guard unit doing 
an incredible job of helping to rescue 
them, an incredible job of doing point 
defense or a lot more residences would 
have burned. They were risking their 
lives trying to get people out before 
that blowtorch of a fire descended on a 
town. They were building fire lines and 
clearing dead brush and trees from 
around houses, dropping water. 
I saw orange splotches as I toured 
these two towns from when the retard-
ant had been dropped. But then, as the 
smoke compiled, the planes couldn’t 
fly—not to drop water, not to drop fire 
retardant. 
These families are going to need ev-
erything we can possibly do to help 
them out. They are devastated and re-
building their lives. Getting their feet 
on the ground is going to be really 
hard. 
Friends will help, and family will 
help, and local government will help. 
But we, too, at the Federal level need 
to be there to help and make sure these 
FEMA programs are expeditiously con-
ducted to assist the individuals with 
the individual assistance and then to 
assist the communities with the re-
building—rebuilding of these towns. 
Local revenues? Those are gone. Prop-
erty taxes? Those are gone. Revenues 
from the local businesses, the fees they 
pay? Those are gone. We are going to 
have to provide a lot of support. 
I applaud the White House for quick-
ly approving Governor Brown’s request 
for an emergency declaration. Our 
whole legislative delegation was call-
ing and requesting and saying: Pay at-
tention to this; we need it quickly. And 
we got it. We got it quickly. That 
emergency declaration is really about 
food and shelter assistance. 
Then we said that we really need the 
major disaster declaration, and we got 
that within about a day of its being 
submitted—again, prompt action by 
the White House. 
Then we applied for a health emer-
gency declaration, and we got that this 
morning—again, expeditiously. 
Those are doors where you have to 
unlock the door to the resources, and 
those declarations are the keys that 
open that door. But now we need the 
supplies to come through that door to 
really start this long process of support 
for individuals and for our commu-
nities. 
One of the things we encountered was 
the valuable help of our Oregon State 
National Guard. Three years ago I 
worked to start funding a training pro-
gram for the National Guard so they 
could help fight these fires, and our Or-
egon portion of this was the training of 
375 National Guard members put into 
three 125-member teams. It was great 
that they were trained and ready to go, 
but we ran into a problem, and that 
problem was we didn’t have enough 
crew chiefs. The crew chiefs come from 
outside to conduct the team’s work, 
and you need five or six crew chiefs for 
every team, for every group of 125. The 
crew chiefs are all tied up all around 
the country. 
Then the Governor said: We need not 
only those 375; we need two more 
teams—another 250. The initial re-
sponse was, no, the funds aren’t avail-
able. But I checked and found out there 
were funds left, and they were approved 
quite quickly—again, a thank-you to 
the executive branch for approving 
them at that point. 
We still needed crew chiefs, and I just 
got word a short period ago that there 
are chew chiefs now en route to Or-
egon. We have found some from around 
the country to go and enable those Or-
egon National Guard members to be 
able to be deployed. So that is another 
step forward. 
We can’t stop there. We have to look 
beyond the immediate crisis. We have 
to help the families rebuild the homes. 
We have to help the local businesses re-
cover, rebuild. 
We have to think about not just the 
fire damage but the smoke damage. I 
have 
introduced 
the 
Smoke-Ready 
Communities Act that would enable 
communities to prepare safe zones 
where you have filtered air in key 
buildings so those who have lung condi-
tions and are affected by the smoke 
have somewhere safe to get to, to be 
able to breathe. 
I think it is a pretty logical thing for 
us to do and a small-dollar investment 
in partnership with communities to 
create some highly filtered space of air 
for people with lung challenges. 
I have written the Wildfire Smoke 
Emergency Declaration Act because in 
the past we thought only of the direct 
fire impact, but now we are seeing all 
this smoke that is having such a major 
impact. In the last major smoke epi-
sode, we saw our outdoor activities like 
the Shakespeare Festival close down. 
We 
saw 
furniture 
salesmen 
who 
couldn’t sell the furniture because of 
smoke damage. We had a massive im-
pact on our wine industry with smoke- 
tainted grapes. By the way, even 
though the buyers of those grapes 
turned them down, it turned out they 
were pretty good grapes, and the com-
munity came together and created an 
Oregon wine, a unity wine, and it was 
great wine and people loved it. So 
those grapes found a home and found a 
product. They came together to solve a 
problem. We had trouble with our ha-
zelnuts with the smoke.

So a declaration act and the Smoke- 
Ready Communities Act but also ac-
tion to help field workers. Think about 
the 
field 
workers—the 
agriculture 
workers working right now harvesting, 
and they are in that smoke—500 parts 
per million small particles damaging 
their lungs. We need to be set up to 
help the agricultural community. They 
are truly frontline workers whose 
health shouldn’t be compromised in 
that manner. 
And we need to make our forests 
more resistant to fires. Now, I know 
President Trump has said that is the 
whole key, and why can’t Oregon and 
California get their act together. Well, 
let me point out that the majority of 
the forest we are talking about, those 
are Federal forests. It is Federal forest. 
It is Federal management that is so 
missing. 
What I proposed in the Wildfire-Re-
silient Communities Act is that we 
spend $1 billion. It should be $1 billion 
dollars a year thinning these over-
grown second-growth forests. What do 
you get out of that? You get jobs; you 
get saw logs for our mills, and you get 
a forest that is much more resistant to 
fire. 
It isn’t just the thinning. Then it is 
what they call the mowing to reduce 
the shrubs that have built up, and then 
it is the prescribed burn that goes back 
2 or 3 years later. This is to avoid the 
pattern of the fire in the past we had 
which was to burn the shrubbery on the 
floor which grows back quickly and 
prevents that over-dense forest. So we 
should do that. We should pass the 
Wildfire-Resilient Communities Act, 
put the funding in, and create perma-
nent 
authorization 
for 
our 
collaboratives. 
What is a collaborative? To those 
outside the forest world, that probably 
isn’t a familiar term. It is where you 
bring the environmental community 
and the timber community together, 
and they develop what they call a pre-
scription for thinning the forest and 
mowing it and doing a prescribed burn. 
By working together and having a 
plan, they stay out of the courts be-
cause court paralysis has been a major 
obstacle. So let’s take that collabo-
rative model. Let’s build on the success 
of the collaborative and stewardship 
agreements, which are very similar, 
but it takes resources and here has 
been the challenge. 
Every time we seek the resources to 
do more on the front end to make the 
forest more fire-resilient, it is blocked 
by individuals who say: Hey, let’s go 
back to the 1950s clearcuts. My friends, 
that doesn’t work. When you clearcut 
and replant, you now create a new for-
est where the trees are too close to-
gether and they are all the same height 
and they are absolutely primed once 
again for fire. The thinning, the pre-
scribed burns, the mowing, this has a 
big impact. 
I went to a forest outside of Sisters, 
OR, where these measures have been 
used, and there was a fire that had 
been bearing down on Sisters, OR. And 
when it met the section of the forest 
that had been thinned, it stopped be-
cause the fuel wasn’t there to propa-
gate itself forward, and because of the 
thinning, the fire crews could get 
through the forest to the frontline of 
the fire. So it worked very effectively 
that way. 
Now there are situations of high 
winds when the forest fire becomes a 
blow torch. Nothing is going to stop it. 
But often fires move at a modest pace, 
and that is where the thinning and 
mowing and prescribed burns can make 
a real difference. So I am hoping we 
can have partnership in that approach. 
Some have said: Well, isn’t it the en-
vironmental laws that prevent us from 
undertaking this effort? And the an-
swer is no. We have 2.3 million acres in 
Oregon that have gone through the en-
vironmental process. We could do the 
thinning, mowing, prescribed burns to-
morrow if we had the funds to do it. 
So jobs, fire resilience, better timber 
stands, better ecosystem, saw logs to 
the mill. That is all the win, win, win, 
win products of this approach. 
Colleagues, I know many of you have 
come to me and said: What can we do? 
Well, there are really two things. Help 
us do forest management in the col-
laborative style, in the stewardship 
style—in the thinning, prescribed burn, 
mowing style. Help us do that, and also 
let’s recognize that this situation in 
Oregon and California and many, many 
other States isn’t simply a freak occur-
rence of the winds. It is a situation 
where the forest is drier than it has 
ever been before. Drier than a kiln- 
dried 2 by 4. If you have gone to the 
hardware store to get kiln-dried 2 by 
4s, they have been baked to have all 
the moisture baked out of them. There 
is less moisture in the forest during 
these periods of drought and heat then 
there is in that kiln-dried 2 by 4. They 
are ready to burn at a second’s notice. 
So this is the result of the changing 
dynamic of climate. The forest season 
has gotten much longer. It is no longer 
a June through August affair; it is a 
March through October affair. In Cali-
fornia, it is a year-round calendar af-
fair now. If you track this decade over 
decade, each one is worse. There is a 
longer fire season with more intensive 
fires and more acres burned. So that is 
a more difficult project. 
Our Earth is wrapped by the com-
mons of our air, and that air holds now 
a lot more carbon dioxide and a lot 
more methane and traps a lot more 
heat, and it is affecting everything. In 
Oregon, it isn’t just the fires. It is also 
our snowpack. Our snowpack, decade 
after decade, is smaller and smaller. 
Why? Because it is warmer and warm-
er. 
How does that affect things? Well, do 
you like to fish? If you like to fish, you 
know that a warmer, smaller stream is 
bad for the salmon returning; it is bad 
for the trout. And if you are a farmer, 
you 
know 
that 
smaller 
snowpack 
means less irrigation water and less 
water to recharge the groundwater 
that you use when you don’t have 
enough irrigation water, when you 
have to pump it out of the ground. So 
we have big impacts not just with the 
timber community with the forest 
burning but also on our ag community 
and our fishing community. The three 
pillars of our rural economy are all 
being substantially affected. 
Offshore, it is a warmer Pacific 
Ocean, and it is a more acidic Pacific 
Ocean—30 percent more acidic than be-
fore we started burning fossil fuels. 
And people say: What is the connec-
tion? Well, those waves take the car-
bon dioxide in the air and convert it to 
carbonic acid. There is a 30-percent in-
crease in acidity that is affecting our 
shellfish reproduction. Worry about 
that—that shellfish are having a hard 
time reproducing. 
So this isn’t an urban issue versus a 
rural issue. This is not a red issue 
versus a blue issue. This is the econ-
omy, the pillars of America, in farm-
ing, fishing, and forests being pro-
foundly affected. 
So let’s work together to take this 
on. Yes, improve our forest manage-
ment. We have altered the forests dra-
matically with our replantings that 
grow up at the same height and are too 
close together, but we can make those 
same second-growth forests far more 
resilient, jobs, and saw logs at the 
same time. 
Let’s work together to improve the 
health of the forest, especially around 
our urban areas, our small towns. 
To my colleagues who say this is a 
moment when we are seeing not just 
the fires, we are seeing other impacts 
around the Nation; we are seeing the 
intense storms in the Midwest; and we 
are seeing the tropical storms and hur-
ricanes hitting the gulf and never-be-
fore-seen storm surges on the East 
Coast—so we are all in this together. 
Let’s work together to assist the fami-
lies so powerfully affected. Let’s work 
together to rebuild the communities. 
Let’s work together to fund forest 
management in a way it has to be fund-
ed as a counterpart to the strategy of 
forest replanting that we have under-
taken. 
Let’s work together to take on the 
warming planet because it affects ev-
erything and not just in Oregon and 
not just in the United States but across 
our planet. It is our responsibility. 
Let’s get it done. 
Thank you.

brating her 60th birthday on October 9, 2020.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF BILLIE FRANCES POLK 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Billie Frances Polk, a lifelong 
native of Woodville, Texas who passed away 
recently at the age of ninety. Mrs. Polk was a 
retired Director of the Woodville Housing Au-
thority. 
Billie was born on December 24, 1929 to 
Oscar and Lilla Chambless Fortenberry in 
Woodville, Texas. She spent her life growing 
up and working in Tyler County. Billie was the 
recipient of the James E. Wheat Award which 
recognizes truly exceptional leaders. She un-
selfishly gave of her time and talents to the 
Tyler County Dogwood Festival, a festival that 
celebrates the traditions and beauty of East 
Texas. 
Mrs. Polk was a loving wife, mother, grand-
mother and great grandmother. She frequently 
reminded her loved ones of what her father 
often said, ‘‘All we have is what we give 
away.’’ She lived her life in this way, continu-
ously giving to others, without any strings at-
tached. 
Billie is remembered by her friends and fam-
ily as a great example of Southern grace and 
hospitality. Whether it was enjoying her family 
or gathering with her friends for bridge, she 
wanted to recognize others. Her delight came 
from opening her home to friends and strang-
ers alike. 
In facing life’s obstacles, Mrs. Polk would 
remind others, ‘‘All we need in times like these 
is just a closer walk with Thee.’’ Billie gave of 
all she had, and because of that she was very 
rich. Indeed, she had a closer ‘‘walk with 
Thee.’’ 
Billie was preceded in death by her parents, 
Oscar and Lilla Fortenberry; husband, Alford 
Lee Polk; sister, Bobbie Jean Swinney; and 
brother, Lloyd C. Fortenberry. 
Mrs. Polk is survived by her daughters, 
Cindy Green and husband, Greg of Woodville, 
Jennifer Balbuena and husband, Arturo of 
Houston and Nancy McNally and husband, 
Billy of Woodville; brother, Cecil Fortenberry 
and wife, Margie of Woodville; sister, Jayne 
Best and husband, Bertis of Woodville; grand-
children, Jill Nichols and husband Reece, Josh 
McClure and wife Christa, Jinger Fowler and 
husband Kris, Holly Douglas and husband 
Josh, Melissa Howe and husband Matt, Will 
McNally and wife Kelli and Cheryl Marshall 
and husband Derek and 16 great grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Mrs. 
Billie Polk, for her many years of faithful serv-
ice to her community. My thoughts and pray-
ers remain with her family and friends during 
this difficult time.

HONORING FRED IMLER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Fred Imler of 
Imler’s Poultry, who recently was awarded the 
Agricultural Community Excellence Award by 
the Farm-City Committee of the Blair County 
Chamber of Commerce. 
The Imler family has been active in 
southcentral Pennsylvania’s agricultural com-
munity for over a century, and six generations 
of Imlers have taken part in building the fam-
ily’s business. The Imler family has been a 
leader in our community since at least 1903, 
when Fred’s great-great uncle operated a gen-
eral store in Bedford County. In 1918, the 
business moved from Bedford County to Al-
toona. In 1951, Fred became a partner in the 
business and, following years of hard work, he 
became the full owner in 1977. Since then, 
Fred has worked tirelessly to provide quality 
products and excellent customer service. 
As a leader in our region’s agriculture indus-
try, Fred consistently gives back to our com-
munity. Fred and his son frequently attend 
auctions at county fairs throughout the region, 
and they have made it a priority to buy ani-
mals to help local students obtain higher edu-
cation. 
Today, I join the Blair County Chamber of 
Commerce in recognizing Fred Imler’s service 
to the agriculture community, and congratulate 
my friend on this well-deserved honor. As 
Fred Imler and his family continue to serve 
Pennsylvanians, I wish them every continued 
success.

REMEMBERING MR. ED BEARSS 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
remembrance of Mr. Ed Bearss, former chief 
historian for the National Parks Service from 
1981 to 1994, author, and WWII veteran. Mr. 
Bearss just celebrated his 98th birthday. 
Mr. Bearss served in the U.S. Marine Corps 
during the invasion of Guadalcanal and the 
Russell Islands. He received the Purple Heart 
after being badly wounded by gunfire at ‘‘Sui-
cide Creek,’’ Cape Gloucester. 
Blessed with an impeccable memory, Mr. 
Bearss returned home to finish his education 
and became a regional historian for the Na-
tional Parks Service in 1955. During his tenure 
as Chief Historian of the National Parks Serv-
ice, Mr. Bearss helped craft national parks pol-
icy for 14 years. 
After retiring Mr. Bearss continued to advo-
cate for historic preservation through tours and 
lectures. He was an anchor for historic pro-
gramming with the Smithsonian Institute and 
National Geographic Society. 
Please join me in a moment of silence to 
honor and thank Mr. Bearss for the many 
years of service to his country both at home 
and abroad.

ceremony at the White House where the two 
Arab nations signed an agreement to nor-
malize relations and make peace with Israel. 
Make no mistake, this is a historical 
achievement and I want to congratulate all 
parties, especially President Trump, on this 
major accomplishment to bring peace to the 
region. 
To put it lightly, Israel is in a bad neighbor-
hood with many state and non-state actors 
who wish nothing more than to bring death 
and destruction to Israel. 
However, we know that violence is not the 
answer and we will only bring peace to the re-
gion through careful and deliberate negotia-
tions. Yesterday is an example of that diplo-
macy and a step in the right direction. 
Israel is and always has been our strongest 
ally in the middle east. The United States 
must always continue to support Israel by pro-
viding necessary resources for their protection, 
as well as diplomatic support to achieve a 
lasting peace. 
I am proud of the efforts made here and will 
continue to do everything in my power to sup-
port our ally Israel and bring peace to the Mid-
dle East.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LOUIS P. 
ESCOBAR 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and passing of a gentle 
caring soul. As August turned to September, 
Louis Escobar entered eternal life. 
Louis was a role model to many young peo-
ple and a mentor to many in the LGBTQ com-
munity. The first Latino elected to Toledo City 
Council, he served three years as Council 
President. 
Louis’ servant’s heart led him to involvement 
in a wide array of Toledo Area community or-
ganizations including Northwest State Commu-
nity College, the AIDS Resource Center, The 
Fair Housing Center, Toledo Sister Cities, To-
ledo/Lucas County Homelessness Board, the 
Latino Arts Council, the Latino/Hispanic Alli-
ance of Greater Toledo, Stonewall Democrats, 
St. Paul’s Community Center, the Area Office 
on Aging and many others. Always, his life 
was helping others to rise. 
Louis was born to Nancy and Peter 
Escobar. He graduated from Central Catholic 
High School in Toledo, then went on to earn 
his bachelor’s degree from St. Mary’s College, 
a Master of Divinity from SS Cyril and 
Methodius Seminary, and a Master of Arts de-
gree from the University of Detroit. A loving 
and deeply spiritual seminarian, he was or-
dained to the priesthood in 1976 and served 
St. Joseph Tiffin, St. Agnes Toledo, and St. 
Joseph Maumee parishes. He taught at Cen-
tral Catholic and Tiffin Calvert high schools. 
Later, Louis worked as a counselor and proba-
tion officer, for the HIV/AIDS Task Force, in 
community mental health through the Zepf 
Center, Latino empowerment with Adelante, 
serving the most vulnerable while at La Po-
sada, and at Owens Corning and the Univer-
sity of Toledo. 
We offer his companion, his mother and 
brothers, nieces and nephews and many dear 
friends our compassion and sympathy. As 
they mourn Louis’ loss, may they find comfort 
and strength in his memories and his teach-
ings. 
Louis Escobar was a kind, gentle, intelligent, 
brave and pioneering soul who endured deep 
illness for a very long time with such dignity 
and bearing. His struggles as a gay man in 
the Catholic Church where he desired to be-
come a priest, and as a rising Latino leader 
were prophetic and huge. He never yielded as 
a standard bearer for truth and social justice. 
His election and steady, honorable service on 
City Council rising as its president became 
part of America’s transformative social and po-
litical change toward human rights and liberty 
and equality for all. Louis Escobar lived the 
change he knew in his heart was essential for 
humankind to advance the reality of the 
human condition. His lifelong partner Kelly 
cared for him throughout his long illness and 
set the standard for love and fealty to family. 
Our community mourns his loss and ex-
presses its deep gratitude for his courage, 
love, service, and sacrifice. 
A U.S. flag is being flown over the U.S. 
Capitol in honor of his life.

Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Moorestown 8U baseball team, 
who on August 26, 2020, became the eight- 
year-old Southern New Jersey Baseball State 
Champions. 
Led by Coach Andy Berman and Assistant 
Coaches Geoff Degener, Dustin Jerdan, and 
Ron Obermeier, the Moorestown 8U baseball 
team displayed incredible perseverance all 
season amidst a global pandemic. Their 
countless hours of practice, dedication to safe-
ty, and commitment to their teammates led 
them to win Moorestown 8U Baseball Team’s 
first State Championship while staying safe 
and healthy. Throughout the entire season 
they dominated their opposition, losing only 
one game and making it to the State Final, 
which they won 9 to 2.

HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
honor 
the 
service 
of 
Lenny 
Krawcheck to the city of Charleston in his time 
as the chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
In his more than four decades on the board, 
Lenny played a critical role in shaping 
Charleston into the destination it is today, a 
consummate tourist attraction that has never 
lost its charm or sense of self. 
Lenny became chairman of the board in 
1979 at the request of Mayor Joe Riley. Dur-
ing his tenure he helped revitalize the city, 
while staying true to Charleston’s unique his-
tory and culture. Lenny quickly developed a 
reputation as a knowledgeable and fair arbiter. 
Even if folks disagreed with the final decision 
made by the Board of Zoning Appeals, they 
respected Lenny’s integrity and commitment to 
do right by the city. 
As he leaves public service to focus on his 
personal life, the city of Charleston owes 
Lenny Krawcheck an enormous debt of grati-
tude.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

her generous efforts to beautify Altoona,

Ms. Cassarly has been a seamstress serv-

refurbish, Christmas wreaths that the City of 
Altoona uses to decorate the downtown area

bished the area surrounding a memorial

IN HONOR OF MAYWOOD BATAAN 
DAY 
AND 
NATIONAL 
POW/MIA 
RECOGNITION DAY 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to tell my colleagues dur-
ing this week that ends with National POW/ 
MIA Recognition Day about my district’s 78- 
year old Maywood Bataan Memorial Day tradi-
tion. This service honors the men from the vil-
lage of Maywood, Illinois who became pris-
oners of war after fighting from December 7, 
1941 to April 9, 1942 against invading Imperial 
Japanese forces in the Philippines. 
The men of Maywood were members of 
Company B of the federated Illinois National 
Guard 33rd Tank Company, 33rd Infantry Divi-
sion based at the town’s Armory. On Novem-
ber 25, 1940, they became part of the 192nd 
Tank Battalion of the U.S. Army. In October 
1941, 89 men from Company ‘‘B’’ left the 
United States for the Philippine Islands. They 
arrived in the Philippine Islands on November 
20, 1941—Thanksgiving Day. On December 8, 
the war started and the Japanese attacked. 
These Illinois tankers fought valiantly on the 
Bataan Peninsula with little food, medicine, 
fuel, or ammunition. Relief from the United 
States never came. Malaria, scurvy, and dys-
entery reached epidemic proportions. On April 
9, 1942, Bataan was surrendered. The fol-
lowing day, some 85,000 American and Fili-
pino soldiers, as Japanese captives, all be-
came victims of the greatest atrocity of the Pa-
cific War: the Bataan Death March. A seem-
ingly endless line of sick and starving men 
began their 85 mile trip up from the tip of Ba-
taan to Camp O’Donnell in central Luzon. 
More than 12,000 died en route. 
Survivors of the March endured three and a 
half years of death camps, brutal labor, and 
untold abuse. Many were taken to Japan 
aboard hell ships to be slave laborers for Jap-
anese companies. Of the more than 10,000 
Americans taken prisoner on Bataan, between 
6,000 and 7,000 died. Of the 89 men of Com-
pany ‘‘B’’ who left the U.S. in 1941, only 43 
would return from the war. 
This is the first year that the Memorial, 
which was scheduled for September 13, has 
had to be postponed. I ask my fellow rep-
resentatives to join me in commending the 
hard work and dedication of Maywood Bataan 
Day Organization President Col. Richard A. 
McMahon, Jr. and his Board of Directors. And 
on this Friday, September 18, National POW/ 
MlA Recognition Day may we all pause to re-
member the men and women of Bataan who 
gave so much in the fight against tyranny.

REMEMBERING THOMAS JAMES

HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Thomas James Loney, of 
Youngstown, Ohio who died on September 10, 
2020 at the age of 83. 
Tom was born July 28, 1937, in Youngs-
town, the son of Emmett and Ann Haney 
Loney. He was a 1955 graduate of Wilson 
High School and was a member of the Pipe-
fitters Union Local 396 for over 62 years. He 
had worked for various local contractors and 
was employed by the Youngstown Board of 
Education as a pipefitter for over 13 years. He 
was a member of St. Charles Church. 
Mr. Loney enjoyed following Notre Dame 
football, the New York Yankees and playing 
golf, but most importantly, spending time with 
his family and being the center of attention. 
Tom was married to the former Margaret 
Ann Murphy, whom he married July 18, 1959, 
until her death Jan. 16, 2019. 
Mr. Loney is survived by his five children, 
Mike Loney of Boardman, Teresa Loney (Mark 
Biroschak) of Boardman, Katie Loney of 
Austintown, Thomas (Colleen) Loney of North 
Lima and Marty (Lisa) Loney of Boardman; 
one sister, Mary Clayton; nine grandchildren, 
Joseph (Jessica) Irwin, Alex (Matt) Roth, Mat-
thew Loney, Ryan Loney, Colin Loney, Kevin 
Darby, Maggie Loney, Abbey Loney and Erinn 
Loney; and four great-grandchildren, Hank and 
Nora Irwin, and Owen and Eli Roth. Tom had 
31 nieces and nephews, who all thought they 
were his favorite. 
He was preceded in death by his parents; 
his wife, Peggy; his brothers, Jack and Jerry 
Loney; and his sister, Ann Clifford. 
I am very honored to be friends with Mr. 
Loney’s son, Marty, who exemplifies the work 
ethic that Tom instilled in each of his children 
and grandchildren. My deepest condolences 
go out to Tom’s family and to all whose lives 
he touched.

HONORING THE SERVICE AND 
WORK OF BILL JACKSON 
HON. KURT SCHRADER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 16, 2020 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of Bill Jackson, a proud veteran 
of the U.S. Marine Corps, lifetime member of 
the African American community in Portland, 
Oregon, and an exemplary hard worker at 
Pepsi for the past 50 years. 
After Bill ended his service as a Marine in 
1970, he took jobs at both Pepsi and Fred 
Meyer. For the next 30 years, Bill diligently 
worked two full time shifts, carrying out his 
tasks at Pepsi during the night before waking 
up to report for duty at Fred Meyer during the 
day. Bill’s work ethic became so legendary 
and he had become such a beloved member 
of the Pepsi family, that he received a rare 
and distinct honor. At his 40th work anniver-
sary, Pepsi released a run of 12 oz. cans, 
about 3,500 cases, with his picture proudly 
displayed on each can. His legacy further be-
came enshrined when Pepsi named a street 
on its property in Portland, Bill Jackson Way. 
Bill has that special ability to connect with 
people and inspire them. During his time at 
Pepsi Bill mentored many new hires and skill-
fully engaged his colleagues in meaningful 
conversations around race. He also leads 
those conversations in the Portland community 
and generously shares his time mentoring un-
derprivileged African American teens. 
There is a tireless nature to Bill. It was only 
five years ago that he stopped working two full 
time jobs; security at Portland Public Schools 
and night loader at Pepsi. As Bill enters his 
well-deserved retirement, I am proud to recog-
nize him for his service to our country, and for

healthy workforce in Pennsylvania’s construc-
tion industry. It also gives back to the commu-
nity with generous charitable support. Under 
Ms. Hunyady’s leadership, I am confident that 
the Builders Association will continue to be a 
force for good in our region. 
Prior to her selection as president, Ms. 
Hunyady had been an active participant in the 
Blair-Bedford Builders Association for seven 
years, including four years as a board member 
and two years as vice president. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Hunyady has 
been a strong and dedicated member of our 
community, and I am grateful for her hard 
work 
to 
serve 
our 
neighbors 
across 
southcentral Pennsylvania. 
Anne Hunyady has demonstrated a clear 
record of hard work and community service, 
and I wish her every continued success as 
she serves as president of the Blair-Bedford 
Builders Association.
