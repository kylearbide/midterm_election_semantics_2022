PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God our provider, after a week of 
long 
hours 
and 
tense 
discussions, 
countless debates and deliberations, 
tears shed and tempers raised, we pray 
Your peace over this House and across 
this Nation. 
Mountains have been shaken, hills 
have been unearthed, individuals and 
ideals have been aggrieved, the co-
operation and camaraderie have been 
tossed by tempests. 
And yet, You assure us that Your un-
failing love for us will not be shaken. 
You will not forsake Your promise to 
restore vigor to the tired and worn out, 
and endurance to the exhausted. 
Give strength to the faint-hearted. 
Increase the fortitude of the weary. 
We wait upon You to renew our ener-
gies. 
Uphold as on eagle’s wings these law-
makers as they return to their dis-
tricts, and we pray they receive Your 
gift of respite. 
May they take the time to rededicate 
their service to You, that in serving 
the ideas of democracy they shall run 
and not be weary, they shall walk and 
not faint. 
In Your eternal name we pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following communication from the 
Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIONS, 
Washington, DC, July 28, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Mr. Keith Ingram, Elections 
Director, Texas Office of the Secretary of 
State, indicating that, according to the pre-
liminary results of the Special Election held 
July 27, 2021, the Honorable Jake Ellzey was 
elected Representative to Congress for the 
Sixth Congressional District, State of Texas. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk. 
THE STATE OF TEXAS, 
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE, 
July 28, 2021. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you 
that the unofficial results of the Special 
Election held on Tuesday, July 27, 2021, for 
Representative in Congress from the 6th 
Congressional District of Texas, show that 
Jake Ellzey received 20,837 or 53.27% of the 
total number of votes cast for that office. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Jake Ellzey was elected as Rep-
resentative in Congress from the 6th Con-
gressional District of Texas. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief at 
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by all counties involved and 
certified by the Governor of Texas, an offi-
cial Certificate of Election will be prepared 
for transmittal as required by law. 
Sincerely, 
KEITH INGRAM, 
Director of Elections. 
f 
SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
JAKE ELLZEY, OF TEXAS, AS A 
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
the gentleman from Texas, the Honor-
able JAKE ELLZEY, be permitted to take 
the oath of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
his election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentlewoman from 
Texas? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will the Representa-
tive-elect and the Members of the 
Texas delegation present themselves in 
the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise his

the House and took the oath of office, 
as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same; that you take 
this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 117th Con-
gress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4300 
July 30, 2021 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
JAKE ELLZEY TO THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JOHNSON) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, as dean of the Texas delega-
tion, it is my honor to welcome to the 
U.S. House of Representatives Con-
gressman JAKE ELLZEY, who will rep-
resent Texas’ Sixth Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Now, I know that he has only been a 
Congressman for a few seconds, but I 
am sure that he is already behind on 
his schedule, so I will be very brief. 
Madam Speaker, our beliefs may dif-
fer, and our votes may contrast, but I 
do not doubt for a moment that we 
share the same commitment to public 
service and the same sentiment that 
what we need is consensus builders, 
people willing to work together, re-
gardless of party, for the good of their 
constituents. Given that our two dis-
tricts are next to each other, I look 
forward to having a strong working re-
lationship with Congressman ELLZEY, 
like I had with his two predecessors, 
Congressman Joe Barton and the late 
Congressman Ron Wright. 
Again, on behalf of the Texas delega-
tion, welcome to the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ELLZEY). 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, first 
of all, I thank my Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ; my family—my beautiful 
wife, Shelby, my incredible daughter, 
McCall; and my incredible son, Jack; 
my parents in Texas and California; 
and papa looking down on me from 
Heaven. 
I thank my family in the Sixth Dis-
trict of Texas. I will serve you with 
quiet professionalism. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
read 
for 
you 
Philippians 4:8–9. 
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is 
true, whatever is honorable, whatever is 
just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, 
whatever is commendable—if there is any 
moral excellence and if there is anything 
praiseworthy—dwell on these things. Do 
what you have learned and received and 
heard from me, and seen in me, and the God 
of peace will be with you. 
I believe America is exceptional. I 
love my country. It is an honor to 
serve. I would appreciate the prayers of 
all of those in here as I learn my job. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
leave you with a moment of silence for 
your colleague, our friend, and my 
predecessor, Ron Wright, and his fam-
ily. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. In light of the ad-
ministration of the oath of office to the 
gentleman from Texas, the whole num-
ber of the House is 432. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE). The Chair will entertain up to 
five requests for 1-minute speeches on 
each side of the aisle. 
f 
HONORING FATHER JOE CARROLL 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, we 
rise today—my colleague, Congressman 
PETERS, and myself—in honor of Fa-
ther Joe Carroll, our San Diego’s Moth-
er Teresa. 
Father Joe was born in the Bronx, 
New York, on April 12, 1941, and had 
seven brothers and sisters. He moved to 
California in his twenties, where he 
completed his studies at the University 
of San Diego and was ordained as a 
priest in 1974. He was assigned to St. 
Rita Catholic Church with a concur-
rent assignment to work with St. Vin-
cent de Paul, a Catholic organization 
known for helping the poor, especially 
the poorest of the poor. 
From 1982 to 2011, Father Joe led St. 
Vincent de Paul, growing the organiza-
tion to 500 employees and a budget of 
$40 million. In 2015, the organization 
was renamed ‘‘Father Joe’s Village’’ in 
his honor. 
On July 10, 2021, just a few months 
after his 80th birthday, Father Joe 
passed. Father Joe Carroll was a heroic 
man who helped his community with 
the entirety of his heart and soul. He 
helped the poor, the hungry, and espe-
cially the homeless, and he had a gift 
for bringing all people together in his 
mission to serve. 
Father Joe was loved by many and 
influenced so many of us. His accom-
plishments and contributions to the 
community were profound. 
He will be sorely missed. Many of us 
expect that one day he will be named a 
saint in the Catholic Church. 
f 
BIDEN’S INFLATION 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to take one second to congratu-
late JAKE ELLZEY on his election to 
Congress. 
It brought two people back together. 
MIKE GARCIA and JAKE actually served 
our Nation earlier, before he served in 
this body. He flew F–18s off an aircraft 
carrier into Iraq. They were brothers, 
and now they are back together again, 
serving their Nation and putting it 
forth. 
It might be a little ironic that they 
both came in in a special election. 
They both were turning points on those 
elections and, I would say, underdogs 
in those elections. But it shows they 
both graduated from the Naval Acad-
emy, served their Nation, and continue 
to serve again. This is a good day in 
this House. 
Madam Speaker, 1 week ago, Presi-
dent Biden said inflation was tem-
porary. He went on to say that spend-
ing trillions more would ‘‘reduce infla-
tion, reduce inflation, reduce infla-
tion.’’ I think he is the only one who 
believes that. 
I say to the President, with all due 
respect, we need to wake up. Inflation 
has risen every single month since he 
took office, and last month was the 
largest increase in 13 years. 
Now, let’s be very clear. Inflation is a 
tax on every single American. Every-
one who is buying groceries knows it. 
Everyone who is filling up their car 
knows it. Everyone who is booking a 
summer flight knows it. 
Yet, President Biden told a townhall 
in Ohio last week: ‘‘I don’t know any-
body . . . who is worried about infla-
tion.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the only people I 
could imagine who are not worried 
about inflation make $5 million in a 
couple of months trading stock options 
or sell paintings for half a million dol-
lars. 
Why doesn’t the President of the 
United States know what is going on? 
This is what Americans hate about 
Washington. They turn on their TV and 
hear the President telling them their 
concerns aren’t real. 
Enough is enough. People are fed up 
with the ignorance and arrogance and 
hypocrisy. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden 
needs to get a clue about inflation be-
fore it is too late. And it is not just Re-
publicans who have been warning the 
Democrats if they pass the bill it would 
bring inflation, and here it is. It was 
Democrats who served in the Obama 
administration and Clinton adminis-
tration, who warned them if they spend 
more trillions, inflation will come. And 
it has come every single month. And 
what is their answer for the future? 
More trillions. They will probably even 
try to call us back in August to make 
sure inflation grows a little more. 
And, if that is not enough, just yes-
terday, we missed every indication and 
every prediction for growth in Amer-
ica. Americans can’t take this much 
longer. November can’t come sooner. 
Inflation is a tax on every single 
American. But for those who don’t 
know it, spend a little time with the 
real America and you will realize it.

9/11 NATIONAL MEMORIAL TRAIL 
ROUTE 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, my 
community in southeastern Pennsyl-
vania was deeply impacted by the ter-
rorist attack of September 11, 2001. 
Members of our community were 
among the flight crews and passengers

H4301 
July 30, 2021 
on the hijacked planes, others worked 
at the World Trade Center or Pentagon 
that day and were killed or had to flee 
for their lives. Airplanes headed to 
Philadelphia were diverted to Canada, 
and the high-rise offices were evacu-
ated with bomb threats. Located be-
tween 
New 
York, 
D.C., 
and 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania, our area 
keenly felt like the geographic center 
of the three airplane attacks. 
I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 2278, 
which authorizes the National Park 
Service to designate the September 11 
National Memorial Trail route linking 
the Memorial and Museum in New 
York to the Pentagon Memorial in Ar-
lington, Virginia, and the Flight 93 Na-
tional Memorial in Somerset County. 
The 9/11 Memorial Trail will allow us 
all not to just engage with the tragedy 
of that terrorist attack, but also to 
heal from it. 
In Pennsylvania’s Fifth District, the 
Memorial Trail will link parts of the 
Schuylkill River Trail, Kingsessing, 
the John Heinz National Wildlife Ref-
uge, and move on through Delaware 
County. 
This bill passed the House with great 
bipartisan support, and I urge the Sen-
ate to take it up before the 20th anni-
versary of September 11. 
f 
EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, 
following 
months 
of 
dis-
appointing jobs reports, rising infla-
tion, and irresponsible messaging on 
how to combat the COVID–19 virus, the 
American people know that Democrat 
policies are to blame for the rising in-
flation that our Nation is facing. 
Today, Americans are making less 
money than they were 1 year ago. With 
annualized real wages down nearly 4 
percent, it is families, not politicians 
that are feeling the effects of President 
Biden’s failed economic policies. Infla-
tion, very simply, is taxation, and it 
has increased every month since Presi-
dent Biden has taken office. 
While Democrats in Congress mocked 
concerns about rising inflation, we saw 
the effects that this crisis is having at 
the gas station and at the grocery 
store. Now, as experts warn that the ef-
fects of inflation may last longer than 
anticipated, President Biden has sug-
gested flooding our economy with even 
more wasteful spending. Urging $100 
bribes for individuals to get vaccinated 
and spending billions of dollars for so-
cial programs will not fix our broken 
economy. 
The American people know that this 
is a failure, and they know that Demo-
crat policy is to blame. 
f 
RECOGNIZING RONNIE SMITH 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize the important 
work being done all across North Caro-
lina to reduce food insecurity. 
I commend the outgoing president of 
the North Carolina Association of 
County Commissioners, Ronnie Smith, 
for his leadership on this effort. Ronnie 
is also chair of the Martin County 
Board of Commissioners, a constituent, 
and a good friend. 
Under Ronnie’s leadership, the asso-
ciation’s Resilience Task Force was 
formed to develop local strategies to 
promote food system resilience. The 
task force recently released a report to 
help counties deepen relationships with 
the local food banks, improve efforts to 
transport food to homes, and strength-
en local food sources to reduce food in-
security. 
To date, nearly a quarter of North 
Carolina’s counties have passed resolu-
tions to support the initiative. This 
year, 42 million people nationwide will 
experience food insecurity. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud President 
Ronnie Smith’s leadership. I applaud 
him for his leadership and commend 
him and the members of the Resilience 
Task Force for their hard work in com-
bating food insecurity in North Caro-
lina. Thank you, Commissioner Ronnie 
Smith. 
f 
REJECT TYRANNY 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
you are not God. Your will does not 
bend the forests or shake the moun-
tains. And let me assure you, your will 
does not bow the knee of millions of 
my countrymen who refuse to heed 
your calloused command. 
To threaten arrest on others for their 
own personal medical decisions is noth-
ing short of a medical apartheid, and I 
will not let it stand. For if I am to cow-
ardly bend a knee here, like those on 
the left wish, then what is to stop you 
all from taking your tyranny to the 
rest of this country that I love? 
How dare anyone in this institution 
attempt to dictate to the patriots of 
my staff how they may live their lives. 
For one to think that because they 
have the title ‘‘honorable’’ attached to 
their name means that they may dic-
tate what others may say and think re-
pulses me. 
What makes this Nation special is 
that in this free land the people are the 
royalty. So arrest us if you will, but I 
will not cower and I will not bend. 
Madam Speaker, you have come to 
take away our liberties but, Madam 
Speaker, in this country you are out-
numbered. 
f 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 4390 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, I 
hereby remove my name as cosponsor 
of the bill, H.R. 4390. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s request is accepted. 
f 
PROTECTING VOTING RIGHTS FOR 
SENIORS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to call attention to an 
urgent problem threatening Texas sen-
iors’ availability to vote. 
One in every three States in our 
country have passed voting restriction 
laws this year. This is alarming. 
New voting restrictions can threaten 
seniors, like my constituent, Earlene 
Sullivan, who turned 102 years old re-
cently. Earlene is a beloved member of 
our community and served our county 
as a presiding judge. She oversaw elec-
tions and has voted all her life. 
Today, Earlene votes by mail with 
the help of her daughter, Catherine. 
But the GOP’s false claims on ballot 
harvesting have already caused a rift 
in her family. 
Proposed 
voting 
restrictions 
in 
Texas, such as stricter driver’s license 
and Social Security verification re-
quirements, could threaten Earlene’s 
and millions of seniors’ ability to vote 
by mail. 
Madam Speaker, this is unaccept-
able. Congress must pass voting rights 
for all Americans by passing H.R. 1 and 
H.R. 4. 
f 
DO NOT FORGET THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
we head into the 6-or 7-week break, it 
is important that Americans and Con-
gress not forget the number one crisis 
facing this Nation, and that is the 
takeover of our southern border by 
Mexican drug gangs. 
Right now, the drug gangs, because 
we are kind of tardy at guarding the 
border, escort people into Mexico, es-
cort people through buses and trains to 
the Rio Grande River, put wristbands 
on these people so they know which 
gang they are associated with and 
which type of tour they bought, and 
have them carry drugs across the Rio 
Grande. 
If our Border Patrol tries to stop peo-
ple crossing the river, they throw little 
children in the Rio Grande so our Bor-
der Patrol has to go there. They even-
tually turn these people over to Border 
Patrol on the southern border, where 
they are turned over to nongovern-
mental organizations that put them in 
hotels. These hotels are not secure, so 
even if you have COVID, you are let 
out into the country. 
They hold relatives hostage in Cen-
tral America and Mexico so that the 
people who come here have to pay 
money to get their entry into this 
country, from $3,000 to $20,000.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MACI 
REED 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Maci 
Reed, the 4-year-old girl from Pima, 
Arizona, who was swept away by flood 
waters and tragically passed away this 
month. 
Words cannot express the heartbreak 
and devastation of losing a child, and 
Maci’s loss is one that will be felt 
throughout her community. I wish the 
Reed family strength and peace during 
this immensely difficult time. 
In the wake of this tragedy, I am 
heartened to see an outpouring of love 
and support from countless in the com-
munity. I encourage every Arizonan to 
continue to show kindness to their 
neighbors. 
I also urge everyone to prioritize 
safety above all else during the mon-
soon season. My wife and I are keeping 
Maci’s family, loved ones, and the en-
tire Pima community in our prayers as 
they mourn her passing.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
ROCK 
AND ROLL HALL OF FAMER AND 
ZZ TOP MEMBER, DUSTY HILL 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Rock and 
Roll Hall of Famer and ZZ Top mem-
ber, Dusty Hill. 
Dusty was born and raised in Dallas, 
Texas, and began playing bass at the 
age of 13. Embarrassment on stage was 
a great motivator for Dusty, and he 
soon mastered the bass. From 1966 to 
1968, Dusty played with his brother, 
Rocky 
Hill, 
and 
future 
ZZ 
Top 
bandmate, Frank Beard, in the Dallas- 
based band, American Blues. 
In 1970, wanting to focus more on 
rock and roll and less on blues, Dusty 
moved to Houston and joined ZZ Top 
with Frank Beard and Billy Gibbons. 
The trio performed their first concert 
together just outside of my district at 
the Knights of Columbus in Beaumont, 
Texas, on February 10, 1970. 
The trio would stay together for the 
next 50 years, releasing numerous hits 
and entertaining tens of millions of 
fans across the world. 
I know Dusty is missed greatly. And, 
Frank, I know you are watching. I 
spoke to Debbie this morning. But 
Dusty will live on together as a staple 
of Texas and in rock and roll history.

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-

Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Washington, DC, July 30, 2021.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

thorize funds for Federal-aid highways, high-
way safety programs, and transit programs, 
and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The

Mr. PADILLA. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
REMEMBERING CARL LEVIN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has 
been a week. I spoke earlier about the 
loss of my good friend Senator Mike 
Enzi, as many other Senators have, out 
of respect, from both sides of the aisle. 
Yesterday, another good friend, Sen-
ator Carl Levin, left us. And, again, 
there will be respect shown, I am sure, 
by both Republicans and Democrats be-
cause he was of the school that worked 
with both. 
I had the privilege of being here 
throughout his decades of service, and 
he epitomized what the Senate should 
be. He was a person of complete integ-
rity; a person who knew the issues, 
whatever they were, that he was going 
to be discussing and working on. He 
knew them as well as anybody else. 
But everybody knew, Republican or 
Democrat, that they could take his 
word for anything. 
And I couldn’t help but think last 
night, if more Senators had listened to 
him at the time of the major Iraq war, 
supposedly because Saddam Hussein 
had 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
which of course he did not; when we 
had been told by many in the adminis-
tration they had evidence of weapons 
of mass destruction in Iraq, when they 
did not; and because he actually took 
the time to read the intelligence—he 
was one of three Senators, another one 
being the vice chairman of the Intel-
ligence 
Committee, 
a 
conservative 
Democrat from Florida—they would 
come to us and tell us specifically what 
parts of the intelligence we should 
read, as did a third Senator. 
Those who actually took the time to 
read it, as, of course, Senator Levin 
did, voted against the war. They knew 
there were no weapons of mass destruc-
tion. They knew that this would ulti-
mately put America at risk. And, un-
fortunately, by having to transfer 
forces from Afghanistan that were clos-
ing in on the Saudi Arabian Osama bin 
Laden and his followers, the people 
who had organized 9/11 and the strike 
against us, he was able to escape and 
stayed loose for years, until captured 
during the Obama administration. 
But Carl Levin I remember saying: 
Please, do your due diligence. 
He and Vice Chairman Bob Graham 
and a third Senator kept saying: Read 
the intelligence. 
Those who did voted no. 
But I could give hundreds of other 
times when we would gather around 
Carl Levin, Republicans and Democrats 
alike, and say: What do you think of 
this issue? What did you study? 
And we would get it, chapter and 
verse. It was always accurate. 
He was what I considered a Senator’s 
Senator. He was the type of Senator I 
hoped to be able to serve with when I 
first came to the U.S. Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5198 
July 30, 2021 
I remember sitting in the Gallery up 
there as a young law student at 
Georgetown 
Law 
School. 
Between 
classes or exams, I would come here 
just to watch the U.S. Senate, and I 
would see so many giants in both par-
ties speaking, and I thought how won-
derful it would be to serve in such a 
body. When Carl Levin was here, that 
was the example—his brother in the 
House of Representatives; he in the 
Senate. 
And I remember Carl, with his sense 
of humor, speaking of his mother, 
whom I also got to meet, when she was 
asked by the press: What do you think 
about one son in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and the other in the U.S. 
Senate? Does that make you proud? 
And she said: Well, if it is what 
makes them happy, I think that is 
good. 
And Carl would just say that with his 
own self-deprecating sense of humor. 
I hope Senators will look at his life 
and realize, whichever party you be-
longed to, this is a person you could 
follow. When he did lead the Armed 
Services Committee, he listened to ev-
erybody in this body, from the right to 
the left, and studiously considered 
their concerns. 
I would not interrupt the Senate 
here, but I mentioned him because this 
is what a Senator should be, as I said 
earlier with Senator Mike Enzi. Losing 
two people I admired, two close friends, 
two people who worked to make the 
Senate better—let us all pause and try 
and do the same. 
I appreciate Senators coming to-
gether yesterday in the legislation that 
Senator SHELBY and I put forward to 
help 
our 
Afghan 
translators 
who 
worked with us, to bring them to safe-
ty, and to help our Capitol Police and 
those who work around the Capitol to 
be able to recover from January 6. And 
it gave me hope that they came to-
gether by a 98-to-0 vote and passed that 
legislation. 
Let’s take a break, and let’s think of 
Carl Levin. Let’s try and do more of 
that. 
I think of my days as a young stu-
dent looking down on this body, and I 
look at it now as the dean of the Sen-
ate. I have seen the good and the bad. 
I prefer the good. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
for the second time this week, sadly, 
the Senate has lost a greatly admired 
former colleague. Last night, Carl 
Levin—Michigan’s longest-serving Sen-
ator, a Harvard-educated civil rights 
attorney, 
and 
former 
taxidriver— 
passed away after a battle with cancer. 
Over the years, many have been 
called model Senators, but few have 
earned the title like Carl. He was no 
frills, hyperfocused on policy and re-
sults, and fearless in taking on en-
trenched powers. 
When the Pentagon was profligate, 
you could be sure that Carl Levin was 
there. When large financial institu-
tions fleeced consumers, you could be 
sure Carl Levin was there. And when-
ever and wherever the interests of as-
sembly line employees, the shift work-
ers, or the servicemembers were at 
stake, you could be sure Carl Levin was 
there. 
He was Mr. Integrity. Like a true son 
of the ‘‘Motor City,’’ he punched the 
clock at an auto assembly plant as a 
young man. Decades later, he proudly 
carried his 1953 union membership card 
in his wallet, a silent reminder of 
where he came from and who he fought 
for. 
He was certainly not a Senator out of 
central casting. As the tributes came 
pouring in from all corners of the coun-
try, the word most often you would see 
associated with Carl is ‘‘disheveled’’— 
the rumpled suit, the stark-white hair, 
the glasses perched precariously at the 
end of his nose. 
Well, he may have been disheveled in 
his appearance, but there was noth-
ing—nothing—disheveled 
about 
his 
mind and principles. 
It reminds me of one story. In 2006— 
I try to teach some of my caucus mem-
bers some certain Yiddish words, and 
one of them is ‘‘schlumpy.’’ It means 
disheveled, not dressed to the best. 
So when Harry Reid heard that BER-
NIE SANDERS was coming to the Senate, 
he got up at our caucus lunch one day, 
and he said: Well, we will finally find 
somebody here in the caucus more 
schlumpy than SCHUMER: BERNIE SAND-
ERS. 
Carl Levin said: I object to that; I am 
the most schlumpy. 
He had a great sense of humor. He 
was a fine man. His intellect was 
fierce, a sharpened blade designed to 
cut to the core of an issue, or some-
times cut through the unimpressive an-
swers of a witness in front of his com-
mittee. To modify a well-known ex-
pression, one of the most dangerous 
places in Washington was the witness 
chair across from Chairman Levin. 
And while he was not a veteran him-
self, the Armed Forces of the United 
States could not count on a better 
friend than Carl Levin. For more than 
three decades, the not-so-invisible hand 
of Senator Levin shaped America’s de-
fense policy. There were large and 
weighty issues: matters of war and 
peace, terrorism and national security, 
billion-dollar budget decisions. 
But there was also the Michigan Ko-
rean war veteran, denied a veterans’ 
loan because his military records were 
destroyed in a fire. It would have been 
enough for Carl to set his office to the 
task, find the lost records, and ship 
them off in a manila envelope. Instead, 
Carl went to visit with him in person 
and deliver four service medals. 
He was an example that inspired and 
one to aspire to. Because of who he was 
and what he accomplished, the Senate, 
the State of Michigan, these entire 
United States, and our globe, our 
world, are much better off thanks to 
Mr. Carl Levin. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. President, on another matter en-
tirely, later today, we will vote on the 
nomination of Ur Mendoza Jaddou, of 
California, to be Director of the U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
This is a Department in desperate need 
of capable leadership after four chaotic 
years under the Trump administration. 
The daughter of Mexican and Iraqi 
immigrants, Ms. Jaddou would be the 
first woman to ever lead the USCIS, 
and I am confident she has the skills, 
expertise, and experience to do the job 
well. 
In a short time, the Senate will also 
take a procedural vote to move forward 
with a bipartisan infrastructure bill. I 
expect the vote will receive the same 
significant margin of support today as 
it did on Wednesday. 
Once Senators agree to proceed to de-
bate on the bill, it is my intention to 
offer the text of the bipartisan agree-
ment as a substitute amendment, mak-
ing it the base of the bill on the floor. 
The Senate remains on track to 
reach our goal of passing both a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill and a budget 
resolution, with reconciliation instruc-
tions, before the start of the August re-
cess. It is an ambitious deadline, abso-
lutely, but the hard work put in by 
Senators and staff means that we are 
on the right track to get it done. 
Given the bipartisan nature of the 
bill, the Senate should be able to proc-
ess this legislation rather quickly. We 
may need the weekend. We may vote 
on several amendments. But with the 
cooperation of our Republican col-
leagues, I believe we can finish the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill in a matter 
of days. 
While our job is not nearly complete, 
I do want to take a moment this morn-
ing to recognize the sweat that our 
Members and staff have already put in. 
Senators from the bipartisan group 
have worked long hours for many 
weeks to first reach, and then finalize, 
this agreement. 
I want to thank Senators SINEMA and 
PORTMAN for taking the lead, to the en-
tire G–22 group—as it is called—as well 
as the White House for helping pull all 
of this together. 
There has been significant work be-
hind the scenes. In order to prepare the 
legislative text, staff members from 
our committees, the group of bipar-
tisan Senators, and the legislative 
counsel have worked not just long 
hours but endured sleepless nights to 
finish writing the bill. 
And the work I am talking about—a 
massive down payment toward rebuild-
ing our Nation’s infrastructure—will

REMEMBERING CARL LEVIN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
has been a sad week in the U.S. Senate. 
First, we lost Senator Mike Enzi of 
Wyoming and last night brought news 
of the passing of Senator Carl Levin of 
Michigan. 
Carl was an extraordinary Senator 
and an extraordinary person. I remem-
ber after I had been in the Senate a few 
years, my friends back home said: Well, 
who are the real stars of the U.S. Sen-
ate? 
There were many who were as obvi-
ous as could be, Ted Kennedy, for ex-
ample. I said: There are two you prob-
ably don’t know much about that I 
would turn to time and again if I had 
to make an important decision, either 
policy or politics, that I know I would 
get a thoughtful, intelligent response. 
One was PAUL SARBANES of Maryland, 
and the other was Carl Levin of Michi-
gan. Those two, more than many of the 
colleagues I served with, really rep-
resented the best of the U.S. Senate. 
Carl Levin was brilliant, nothing 
short of brilliant, and he was my 
friend. Many times we sat together and 
talked. I reflected on the way he ap-
proached legislation. Many of us think 
about the big-picture items and leave 
the details to staff—not Carl. Some-
body would bring an amendment to the 
floor. Carl would say: I would like to 
get a copy of that. That, in itself, is 
unusual. We usually trust our staff to 
look at copies of amendments. 
Then he would say, as he read the 
amendment: Can I take this home to-
night and read it and tell you what I 
think about it in the morning? You 
knew that wasn’t a pose; that was a 
fact. Carl took his job that seriously. 
He served in the Senate, representing 
his beloved State of Michigan, for 36 
years. When he retired in 2014, he left a 
legacy in the Senate, certainly, of im-
portant and good legislation but, more 
importantly, of the image of a real 
Senator. He left a powerful example of 
what we can achieve in life and in poli-
tics when we choose integrity over ide-
ology and common good over con-
frontation. His keen intellect, his hon-
esty and fairmindedness, decency and 
unfailing civility earned him the re-
spect of Senators on both sides of the 
aisle. 
The list of laws that he can claim to 
have authored is long and historic. 
If you knew his background, you un-
derstood where this man came from 
and what made him what he was in the 
Senate. 
First and foremost, he was a son of 
Detroit, MI. He showed up in Wash-
ington in 1979. He was driving a 1974 
American-made Dodge Dart with a hole 
in the floorboard. He was still driving 
that car 10 years later. That is how de-
voted he was to the U.S. auto industry, 
its workers, and unions. 
He wasn’t flashy. I don’t think he 
owned a shirt of any other color than 
white. And when we would go on the in-
formal weekends with our families, he 
would be wearing a white shirt, which 
he rolled the cuffs up on to merely let 
his hair down and be informal. He was 
just that humble a man. 
But when General Motors and Chrys-
ler faced potential collapse in 2008, he 
knew what he had to do. He pressed 
Congress and the new President to sup-
port those companies with billions of 
dollars in loans, and thank God he did. 
He saved jobs and saved companies 
that are still major players in the in-
dustry. By the time he retired 6 years 
later, the loans to those companies had 
been paid off, and the companies were 
earning record profits. 
His work on the Armed Services 
Committee is known to all. For 36 
years, he served on that committee. He 
was the champion of America’s mili-
tary and military families and veterans 
and one of Congress’s most respected 
voices on national security and the 
military issues. He voted for the repeal 
of don’t ask, don’t tell when it was far 
from a popular thing to do anywhere, 
and he voted against the war in Iraq. I 
felt honored to be joining him in that 
vote. He and I were 2 of only 23 Sen-
ators who voted no on that, sadly, mis-
guided war, and I will tell you for sure, 
before I made a final decision, I sat 
down in that seat right—I can see it 
from here, right next to Carl Levin— 
and we talked about what it meant. It 
was amazing. I was making that deci-
sion before an election, just a few 
weeks, but he was making that deci-
sion as chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. It was a brave 
vote, and history has shown that he 
was right. 
A Jewish publication in Detroit once 
wrote that Carl Levin and his brother— 
my pal—former Congressman Sandy 
Levin, both deserved what they called 
‘‘honorable menschen awards,’’ with 
the accent on ‘‘mensch,’’ for their his-
toric service to America. I couldn’t 
agree more. 
Loretta and I extend our deepest con-
dolences to Sandy and the entire Levin 
family, especially to Carl’s beloved 
wife Barbara, their children and grand-
children. 
And to their cousin Dan Levin, my 
pal in Chicago, IL, I know how proud 
the Levin family was of their name and 
reputation. It was well earned in what-
ever they chose to do—law, politics, 
business. Carl Levin was a great man 
and a good friend. I will truly miss 
him. 
IMMIGRATION 
Madam President, last night, we had 
an opportunity. We sat down with the 
President of the United States for more 
than an hour. We were discussing with 
him and with Vice President HARRIS 
our Nation’s need for immigration re-
form. 
The Presiding Officer was there, Sen-
ator MENENDEZ, Senator LUJA´ N, SEN-
ATOR
PADILLA, along with our col-
leagues in the House. We got to speak 
to the President in a very informal set-
ting. 
I want to thank President Biden for 
taking the time to meet with us. He 
could have taken the whole day on a 
victory lap in the Senate after passing 
the historic infrastructure plan or at 
least starting the debate on it 2 nights 
ago. But instead President Biden said: 
I want to meet with you. He gave us his 
undivided attention for more than an 
hour. That is because President Biden 
understands that we cannot wait any 
longer to fix America’s broken immi-
gration system. 
It has been 35 years—35 years—since 
we passed any meaningful immigration 
bill. We passed it here. It was known at 
the time as the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, 
and it was sent to President Ronald 
Reagan, who signed it. Critics of what 
was signed called it amnesty, but it 
was a sincere and bipartisan effort to 
deal with a broken immigration sys-
tem. We have since learned that the 
immigration system is broken again in 
many significant ways. This effort that 
we are discussing now has been decades 
in the making. 
Back when we passed that original 
immigration reform under President 
Reagan, our adversary in the world was 
the Soviet Union. ‘‘Top Gun’’ was the 
most popular movie in America. Under 
the last administration, our broken im-
migration system absolutely collapsed. 
Former 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
zero-tolerance policy at the southern 
border was not only inhumane, it was 
ineffective. It made our Nation weaker 
and less safe. 
The hatred that many people in the 
Trump administration had for immi-
grants was palpable. I can go through 
the list of names, but I don’t want to 
give them any satisfaction to hear 
their names on the floor of the Senate. 
But what they think of people who 
were not lucky enough to be born in 
America is just sad, in many ways, dis-
gusting. 
Some of my Republican colleagues 
have tried to blame President Biden, 
who has been in office for 6 months, 
with the failure of our immigration 
system, but the reality is Donald 
Trump was the one who provoked the 
crisis at our border.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5200 
July 30, 2021 
Do you remember the speeches when 
he talked about all the rapists and 
murderers who were coming in, want-
ing to live in the United States? Do 
you remember what he did to our Mus-
lim friends and their families when he 
cut off immigration from their coun-
tries? 
His 
administration 
implemented 
policies that blocked nearly all claims 
by asylum seekers. They also pre-
vented members of law enforcement 
from exercising prosecutorial discre-
tion, which made it harder for ICE and 
DHS to apprehend true criminals. 
Former President Trump’s hate-based 
policies created a massive bottleneck 
at our border and a giant backlog of 
cases that our courts are still working 
through. 
President Biden understands that 
closing our doors to families and chil-
dren fleeing violence is not only cruel 
and inhumane, it is not good policy. 
And it is contrary to the values of this 
country. The stories are legendary 
about when the United States closed 
its borders in World War II under a 
Democratic President, Franklin Roo-
sevelt, turning away people who were 
escaping the Nazis in Europe, sending 
them back to their deaths in the Holo-
caust. 
We learned a bitter lesson during 
that war that that is not what the 
United States is all about. And we have 
tried to make it up ever since, trying 
to lead the world when it came to refu-
gees embraced in America. And those 
refugees have proven over and over 
again that they are positive influences 
on this Nation. 
The Biden administration is bringing 
order to immigration enforcement, and 
it will take some time, but it is on its 
way. Since President Biden took office, 
roughly 7 in 10 individuals apprehended 
at our border have been denied entry 
into the country—7 out of 10. You 
wouldn’t know that from the speeches 
given on the other side. Of course, 
there should be exceptions to the pol-
icy, humanitarian exceptions. Our Na-
tion has a moral obligation, a moral re-
sponsibility, to provide refuge to fami-
lies and unaccompanied children flee-
ing gang violence, natural disasters, 
paramilitary violence, and other crises. 
This is at the heart of our values as 
a nation, and under President Biden’s 
leadership, our Nation is no longer 
tearing babies away from mothers’ 
arms. 
I just read a story in the newspaper 
yesterday about efforts that are being 
made in Guatemala and other coun-
tries, going deep into the forests and 
jungles to try to find families whose 
children were taken away from them 
by the policies of the previous adminis-
tration. The lengths we are going to, to 
try to reunite them, were totally un-
necessary if they had just kept records 
of the families and children, but they 
tore these kids away from their moth-
ers and had no plan at all to reunite 
them. 
President Biden also recognizes that 
just fixing the mess of Donald Trump is 
not enough. We need to provide a path 
to citizenship for Dreamers and others 
who make our economy better every 
day and who help over the years to add 
to its growth. The vast majority of 
Americans agree with this—Democrats, 
Republicans, and Independents. Tens of 
thousands of Dreamers have been sav-
ing American lives during this pan-
demic as nurses and doctors and first 
responders. Tens of thousands more 
help the economy grow every day as 
teachers, engineers, business owners, 
entrepreneurs, essential workers. They 
even have volunteered for our military. 
They respect our country so much, 
though so many in the Senate do not 
respect them. 
The Dreamers need to be provided a 
path to citizenship as well as the farm-
workers who are toiling in sweltering 
heat right now, right now at this mo-
ment, in this terrible heat that we are 
witnessing across the country. They 
are out in the fields, picking the crops 
that will be on our tables today, to-
morrow, and beyond. 
We had a recent hearing on farm-
workers in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. One of the Republican Senators 
said: Here we are talking about mass 
amnesty, giving these people an auto-
matic path to citizenship. 
Automatic? Read the bill that passed 
the House of Representatives. Do you 
know what it takes to be eligible for 
citizenship as a farmworker under that 
bill? Nineteen years of back-breaking 
work in the fields. Automatic? Nine-
teen years of slaving away at jobs that 
Americans don’t sign up for—ever—and 
a possibility at the end of 19 years that 
they can be citizens. They should be 
given that chance. Every day, these 
workers head out to the fields and do 
back-breaking labor, sometimes for 14 
hours straight, just to put food on our 
tables. Giving these people a chance to 
become citizens is the right thing to 
do. 
It will help our economy. Reforms of 
our immigration system could add $150 
billion to spending power in our econ-
omy every year and, over the next 10 
years, boost our Nation’s GDP by $1.5 
trillion. That is enough money to pay 
off every student loan in America just 
by doing the right thing for immi-
grants in our country. 
Providing these essential workers a 
path to citizenship puts more money in 
the pockets of every American. It will 
create 400,000 new jobs, increase each 
American’s annual wage by $600. These 
people, when they are given some clear 
picture of what their future will be, 
can plan it, can start making decisions 
that in the long haul will make them 
better and our Nation stronger. That is 
what it means to bring these immi-
grants into the sunlight and to give 
them a chance to be part of America. 
By nearly every measure, a path to 
citizenship is an investment in our Na-
tion’s future. Last night, President Joe 
Biden agreed. It can’t wait any longer. 
There is going to be a bill soon called 
reconciliation. 
In 2005, Senate Republicans used the 
budget reconciliation process to dra-
matically increase the number of green 
cards available to immigrants. During 
the 
Trump 
administration, 
Repub-
licans used the budget reconciliation 
process to enact a $1.9 trillion tax cut 
for wealthy donors and corporate fat 
cats, and they tried to use it to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act. So there is 
ample precedent for passing important 
legislation through budget reconcili-
ation. 
I have tried for many years to pass a 
citizenship program through regular 
order. Senate Republicans have ob-
structed bipartisan immigration re-
form time and again, filibustering the 
DREAM Act five times. In 20 years, I 
have brought the DREAM Act to the 
floor five times and been stopped by 
the filibuster. They repeatedly blocked 
bipartisan comprehensive immigration 
reform, passing the Gang of 8 bill but 
never returning to it. 
This year, I am convinced bipartisan 
immigration 
negotiations 
are 
not 
going to lead us to where we need to 
be. Republicans made unreasonable de-
mands in that process to limit the path 
to citizenship to a number that was 
dreamed up by President Trump as 
fair—650,000 current DACA recipients. 
Sounds like a lot. However, that ap-
proach would exclude Dreamers who 
have been blocked from the program 
for years by President Trump. Repub-
licans also wanted to attach partisan 
provisions to block innocent asylum 
seekers and to cut legal family immi-
gration. 
For all of these reasons, I believe the 
only viable option, at this time, for 
passing a path to citizenship is through 
reconciliation. The overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans support this path-
way for Dreamers, many of whom have 
risked their lives to save Americans 
during the pandemic. This is a critical 
component of our economic recovery 
and rebuilding our communities. It 
cannot wait any longer.

NATIONAL WHISTLEBLOWER APPRECIATION DAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, each 
year on July 30, we take time to cele-
brate whistleblowers and the very hard 
role that whistleblowers play in keep-
ing our government transparent and 
accountable. 
But the task of supporting whistle-
blowers doesn’t start and stop on July 
30; it is a year-round job. And here in 
this Congress, it is something that we 
have been working on for decades. 
When I first came to Washington in 
the 1970s, most of the whistleblower 
laws we take for granted today didn’t 
even exist then. 
I like to tell people, anyone who 
dared to blow the whistle back at that 
time was about as welcome as a skunk 
at a picnic. 
People in government would often re-
taliate by trying to run the whistle-
blower off and make them out to be the 
problem instead of the problem the 
whistleblower was trying to present. 
I still hear about that kind of retalia-
tion going on this very day in far too 
many cases. But, today, we have better 
whistleblower protections in place than 
we did years ago, and whistleblowers 
have important advocates in their cor-
ner to support them. 
The Nation owes a special thanks for 
many of the key whistleblower protec-
tions that we have in place this very 
day to my former colleague and good 
friend, Senator Carl Levin, who died 
yesterday at the age of 87. 
Carl was the original sponsor of the 
Whistleblower Protection Act back in 
1989, and a cosponsor of the Whistle-
blower Protection Enhancement Act of 
2012. 
I was proud to have worked with Carl 
on those foundational pieces of whistle-
blower legislation. I know that if Carl

July 30, 2021 
were still here in the Senate this very 
day, he would be continuing to lead on 
whistleblower issues. 
Carl understood that whistleblower 
protections are not just important to 
Members of Congress and a small net-
work of interest groups in Washington, 
DC; they are important for the entire 
Nation because whistleblowers play a 
critical role in our government. They 
call attention to the problems of waste, 
fraud, abuse, and inefficiency. 
And if you have the sort of trans-
parency that comes because whistle-
blowers are ready to stand up for what 
is right, that transparency brings ac-
countability to our government, and 
you can’t have a democratic govern-
ment that is not accountable. 
These whistleblowers help those of us 
in Congress to identify problems in the 
government 
so 
we 
can 
fix 
them 
through oversight and, if necessary, 
passing legislation. 
And so whistleblowers help keep gov-
ernment transparent and accountable 
to the people, and they help us find 
ways of saving taxpayers’ dollars. 
As much as Carl accomplished during 
his Senate career helping whistle-
blowers, and as much as we have ac-
complished together over the years, 
there is still more that needs to be 
done to ensure that whistleblowers re-
main protected. 
One important resource for whistle-
blowers is the Merit Systems Protec-
tion Board, where whistleblowers can 
go if they face retaliation for blowing 
the whistle. 
And let me tell you, too many whis-
tleblowers face retaliation for doing 
just what is right. We ought to see 
them as partisans for good govern-
ment. 
Now, this Merit Systems Protection 
Board has been without a quorum for 
more than 2 years, and it has developed 
a significant backlog of cases. I am not 
sure what is keeping President Biden 
from sending us nominations for that 
board. I certainly believe he needs to 
do that without delay. 
There is also still work to do to make 
whistleblower protections stronger and 
more robust. I am working on several 
pieces of whistleblower legislation in 
this Congress. One of my bills will 
strengthen incentives and protections 
for whistleblowers who report potential 
money laundering. 
And I also have legislation to further 
strengthen the False Claims Act and 
an act entitled Program Fraud Civil 
Remedies by giving Agencies more re-
sources to directly take on people who 
defraud the government. 
In addition, I am working on legisla-
tion that will establish stronger whis-
tleblower protections for our FBI em-
ployees. Wherever there are still gaps 
in our existing laws, I am working to 
fill those gaps. 
This year, on Whistleblower Appre-
ciation Day, the Senate Whistleblower 
Protection Caucus welcomes two new 
Members: Senators COLLINS and HAS-
SAN. 
As chair of the caucus, I am pleased 
to welcome my colleagues. I look for-
ward to working with these new col-
leagues and our caucus co-chair, Sen-
ator WYDEN of Oregon, as we continue 
our joint effort to make sure the whis-
tleblower laws and protections we have 
in place next year and the year after 
are even stronger than the ones that 
we have in place today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is 2 
o’clock on a Friday afternoon, and it 
looks like we are going to grind 
through this bipartisan infrastructure 
bill this weekend, as Senator SCHUMER 
has ordained, but we have now had a 
couple of votes—actually, three votes 
now—to proceed to a bill that hasn’t 
even been written yet in totality, and 
indeed the reason we were delayed this 
morning was because some of the text 
that was written did not comport with 
the agreement between the negotiating 
parties. 
I have said this from the beginning; 
that Senator SCHUMER should not rush 
a bill to the floor before it is ready. It 
is simply not a good practice. And we 
are talking about more than $1 trillion 
in spending that will affect every man, 
woman, and child in America. It is 
more important to get things right 
than to get it done fast. 
For weeks now, the bipartisan group 
of Senators who have been negotiating 
this bipartisan infrastructure package 
have been engaged in intense negotia-
tions with the White House to find 
common ground. Over the last several 
days, in particular, colleagues have 
logged countless hours to nail down 
specific provisions and how it would be 
paid for. 
I want to commend all of them for 
their efforts on both sides of the aisle. 
It has been a long road, but we still 
have a long road ahead, and I appre-
ciate both sides working in good faith 
to try to reach an agreement. 
Like all my colleagues, I am eager to 
see the text in the bill to understand 
the specifics and how it impacts my 
State, what is included and what is not 
included. To gain my support, this leg-
islation must accomplish two things: 
First, it must send sufficient resources 
to Texas to build and maintain our 
vast 
network 
of 
infrastructure 
projects. We are the fastest growing 
State in the Nation, with 29 million 
people, and we need to make sure our 
infrastructure is up to the need. We 
have the largest network of roadways 
of any State in the country, with more 
than 680,000 lane miles. We are also 
home to more than 55,000 bridges, far 
more than any other State. 
We have water ports along the gulf 
coast, as the Presiding Officer knows, 
having lived in Houston, and ports of 
entry along the border with Mexico and 
Canada, all of which are critical to our 
economy, as well as airports, levees, 
waterways, and countless other infra-
structure projects that are vital to our 
communities across the State. 
The pandemic has also highlighted 
the importance of broadband, including 
the need to expand access in unserved 
parts of the State. It is figured that we 
have about a third of our State without 
adequate access to broadband, and, of 
course, that became critical when our 
children were studying remotely from 
home or when people attempted to see 
their 
doctor 
using 
telehealth. 
Broadband has gone from a conven-
ience to a necessity. 
It is going to take a little while to 
comb through the specifics of this mas-
sive bill—I think at last count it was 
2,600 pages long—to see if it meets my 
two criteria. But that is my priority 
No. 1. 
But my second criterion is this bill 
must include a real plan to pay for 
these infrastructure investments in a 
responsible way. We have had to spend 
a lot of money in the last 18 months. A 
lot of this money was borrowed money 
because we were engaged in an emer-
gency, a pandemic. But now our debt to 
gross domestic product is really rough-
ly to what it was after World War II, 
and I agree that most of that was nec-
essary, at least the bipartisan bills 
that we passed. I think there were a 
total of five last year. 
But now is not an emergency when it 
comes to infrastructure. Now, this is 
the bread and butter of legislating, and 
we have got to come up with a respon-
sible way to pay for the money that we 
intend to spend. 
The current draft of the bill, I think, 
is lacking in adequate pay-fors. Sen-
ator PORTMAN, the Senator from Ohio, 
said that the Congressional Budget Of-
fice would not give the writers of the 
bill credit for some of the money that 
is in fact real, some of the repurposed 
money from COVID–19 that was not 
used for Federal bonuses to State un-
employment, which was, at one point, 
rejected by the Governors because peo-
ple were being paid more money not to 
work than to work. So there wasn’t a 
pot of money to offset some of the 
spending. 
But I think there are additional pay- 
fors that have been overlooked. So I 
am in the process of drafting amend-
ments to this bill, including new pay- 
fors, and I hope these amendments will 
come to a vote on the Senate floor. 
I support the efforts of our colleagues 
on a bipartisan basis to negotiate the 
current package. I think they have 
done us a great favor. But the fact of 
the matter is, the rest of us, the 80 of 
us who did not participate in those ne-
gotiations, have a right and a duty to 
participate in writing this legislation 
too. So it would be a terrible mistake 
for the majority leader to refuse to

S5203 
July 30, 2021 
allow Members on both sides to offer 
amendments which could pass and 
could improve the underlying bill. 
It goes without saying that this bill 
did not go through regular order, which 
is nothing more than saying it didn’t 
go through the normal committee 
process. But the benefit of going 
through the normal committee process 
is that both majority and minority 
Members get a chance to participate in 
writing a bill in the committee even 
before it comes to the floor. 
So now that we have a bill that was 
negotiated and which, I suppose, at 
some point we will see in the light of 
day, but one that was negotiated by 
only a small fraction of Senators, it is 
even more critical that we have an 
open amendment process. 
As I said earlier, a transportation in-
frastructure bill ordinarily would go 
through an arduous process, through, I 
think, at least three standing commit-
tees—through the Banking Committee, 
through the Commerce Committee, and 
through the Environment and Public 
Works Committee. But that did not 
happen here. 
The bipartisan group of Senators did 
find common ground among them-
selves, and now it is time for the full 
Senate to have the opportunity to offer 
changes that will improve this legisla-
tion and allow all Senators a chance to 
participate in shaping them. 
Our friend, Senator PORTMAN, the 
Senator from Ohio, said the bipartisan 
group is committed to having a fair 
process that allows both sides an op-
portunity to amend the bill. Senator 
MCCONNELL has also called for a ro-
bust, bipartisan floor process. So I 
would encourage Senator SCHUMER, the 
floor leader, to accept amendments 
from Members of both sides of the aisle 
to strengthen the legislation and en-
sure that it meets the needs of our con-
stituents. 
There is no question that the roads 
and bridges across the country are in 
need of repair. Every year, the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers evalu-
ates the state of our infrastructure and 
issues a report card to let us know how 
we are doing. 
Well, America is barely passing with 
a C-minus. Texas is faring slightly bet-
ter than the rest of the class, with a C. 
But it is time, as you can tell, for us to 
invest in our roads and bridges and the 
ports and waterways that fuel our 
economy and the broadband that keeps 
us connected. 
I have been disappointed that Sen-
ator SCHUMER has seen fit to try to 
force us to vote on a bill that does not 
yet exist in its entirety, but I hope we 
can now pump the brakes a little bit 
and take the time and care to evaluate 
the benefits and the costs of this legis-
lation, and I hope that there will be an 
amendment process available to both 
sides of the aisle to ensure that our in-
frastructure 
investments 
are 
made 
fairly and they are paid for respon-
sibly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PETERS). The clerk will call the roll.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING CARL LEVIN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
am sorry to begin my remarks today 
with a third Senate eulogy for this 
week alone. 
Last evening, we received word that 
our former colleague from Michigan, 
Senator Carl Levin, passed away at the 
age of 87. Carl’s fellow Michiganders 
elected and reelected him six times. He 
was the longest serving Senator from 
Michigan ever. His home State liked 
what they had in this passionate activ-
ist turned attorney, turned public serv-
ant. His dutiful, diligent, and detail- 
oriented approach led Senator Levin to 
build expertise and win respect across a 
huge range of issues. 
The pinnacle of our colleague’s ca-
reer was his years atop the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. I certainly 
did not always reach the same conclu-
sions that Carl did, but his independ-
ence, his genuine humble curiosity, and 
his affection for the men and women 
who wear the uniform were impossible 
to dispute. 
He was earnest. He was solid, forth-
right, and devoted to the defense of our 
Nation in ways that he thought best. 
I especially admired Carl’s coura-
geous, consistent defense of the Senate 
filibuster and the unique structures 
that define this institution. He never 
let short-term political facts cloud his 
long-term judgment in that crucial 
area. 
I know all of our condolences go out 
to Barbara and the entire Levin family 
today and to all Senators, staff, and 
friends who will miss our colleague. 
THE ECONOMY 
Now, Mr. President, on a completely 
different matter, we learned yesterday 
that last quarter, our GDP finally re-
gained its prepandemic level. It has 
taken about a year of economic growth 
just to recover back to where we start-
ed. 
Obviously, we are still far below 
where our pre-COVID trajectory would 
have had us today. Before this 100-year 
pandemic, 
Republican 
policies 
had 
helped build the best economic mo-
ment for American workers in recent 
memory. Unemployment was at re-
markable lows. Wages were on the rise. 
Pay was growing faster for workers to-
ward the bottom of the income scale— 
actually faster than those at the top. 
That was then. This is now. For the 
last several months, a different philos-
ophy has guided our recovery. Our 
Democratic friends believe in bor-
rowing, spending, and taxing at diz-
zying rates. They want to engineer 
some kind of socialist recovery from 
the top down. So how is it going? Well, 
that GDP report that came out yester-
day was actually a substantial miss. 
Our economy grew almost 25 percent 
slower than the experts had predicted— 
another economic disappointment. 
Now, remember, this new administra-
tion and this Democratic Congress 
were set up for success unlike any 
other transition we had seen in our 
lifetimes. They inherited not one, not 
two, but three safe and effective vac-
cines that were spreading around the 
country. They inherited an economy 
that was raring to come back, thanks 
to five bipartisan rescue packages we 
passed last year. 
But instead of helping the American 
people get back to normal, Democrats 
decided they wanted to build back 
bloated—build 
back 
bloated. 
They 
jammed through a massive $2 trillion 
so-called COVID package that only 
spent about 1 percent on vaccinations 
and less than 10 percent on public 
health. The rest went to a litany—a lit-
eral 
litany—of 
inflationary 
liberal 
spending. 
Now American families are paying 
the price: slower hiring than expected, 
slower growth than expected, a weaker 
comeback than expected. Their policies 
are sticking it to the middle-class fam-
ilies through higher prices at the gro-
cery store, at the gas pump, at the 
hardware store, at the car dealership, 
in the housing market, and practically 
everywhere else that matters to fami-
lies. 
Employers large and small, down to 
Main Street shops and construction 
sites, are struggling to hire and turn-
ing down work because Democrats de-
cided taxpayers should keep directly 
paying people to stay home. Our coun-
try is flooded with safe, effective, and 
free vaccines for anyone who wants 
one, but Democrats are still making 
small businesses bid against a special 
government handout that rewards, be-
lieve it or not, not working. 
Our bipartisan work last year left 
our country primed and ready for a 
comeback summer, but it is becoming 
clearer and clearer that Democrats in 
the Capitol and down Pennsylvania Av-
enue pursued economic policies that 
have fumbled the handoff. 
Now, in the days ahead, Democrats 
want to steamroll ahead with yet an-
other reckless tax-and-spending spree: 
more unhinged borrowing, printing, 
and spending; more welfare spending 
with no—listen to this—no work re-
quirements; everything from amnesty 
to big chunks of the Green New Deal 
and historic tax hikes poured on top 
for good measure. This kind of reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree would make 
their last failed package look like a 
walk in the park, and the pain that 
families are already feeling would just 
be beginning.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5204 
July 30, 2021 
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. CHIPMAN 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, the President has made an inex-
plicable choice in nominating David 
Chipman to head the Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
This nominee has a long track record 
of open hostility to law-abiding Ameri-
cans’ Second Amendment rights. He is 
a loud, proud, would-be gun-grabber 
who has made it a personal mission to 
erode the Bill of Rights for the citizens 
of this country. 
This is an especially awful time to be 
taking aim at Americans’ right to keep 
and bear arms. Remember, as the polit-
ical left has sought to vilify and defund 
the police across our country, homi-
cides have, of course, surged. Last 
year’s spike in the national murder 
rate was the steepest since, believe it 
or not, 1960. 
So, as Democrats have made political 
war on the police, many citizens have 
started to think about self-protection. 
We have seen members of racial minor-
ity groups joining the parade of first- 
time gun owners in record numbers. 
But then Democrats don’t like that ei-
ther. 
Apparently, 
the 
left 
neither 
wants strong police forces, nor do they 
want Americans equipped for self-de-
fense. 
This nominee is unsuited enough for 
this job on policy merits, but somehow 
all this is just the tip of the iceberg of 
the concerns. 
Mr. Chipman also comes with a dis-
tressing workplace reputation. Current 
and former ATF agents, once his col-
leagues, have described him as an ‘‘ac-
tivist’’ and a ‘‘bully.’’ Those are direct 
quotes. By one account, his policy 
views are ‘‘extreme’’ and his demeanor 
unsettling. I understand that just this 
week, even graver concerns have sur-
faced. According to one report, mul-
tiple ATF sources say there exists an 
internal complaint over racially insen-
sitive comments allegedly made by the 
nominee in the workplace. 
I don’t expect that a Democratic 
President would pick somebody to run 
the ATF who will have our side of the 
aisle popping corks, but this is another 
level altogether. 
Anyone who supports the Bill of 
Rights should oppose this nomination. 
There is no way this nominee is the 
best the Biden administration can do. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I rarely 
come to the floor to directly respond to 
speeches given by my colleagues. I nor-
mally like to use the Chamber to make 
my own arguments on their merits 
rather 
than 
to 
make 
arguments 
against specific colleagues. 
But yesterday I listened to a speech 
by Senator CRUZ of Texas, and it was 
one of the most dangerous speeches 
that I have ever heard given on the 
Senate floor, and it deserves a re-
sponse. 
Now, I understand that Republicans 
don’t want to talk about the economy. 
They don’t want to talk about the fact 
that we have had more jobs added to 
the economy in the first 5 months of 
President Biden’s term than any other 
first-term President. I know they don’t 
want to talk about the rapid expansion 
of the economy that is happening. 
I understand Republicans don’t want 
to talk about what we are debating on 
the Senate floor right now, which is 
the biggest bipartisan investment in 
infrastructure in the history of the 
country. 
And I also understand that the Sen-
ator from Texas doesn’t like the new 
guidance announced this week by the 
CDC. And he is not alone. From what I 
can tell, a lot of Republicans here are 
upset, as are a lot of nonpolitical 
Americans. Nobody likes to wear a 
mask. Nobody likes that the new rec-
ommendation is that some Americans 
need to wear them. Again, I don’t like 
wearing a mask. I hate it. My kids hate 
the masks more. 
But here is what the CDC said. The 
CDC’s scientists have been carefully 
following this dramatic increase in 
cases that we have seen all across the 
country as the Delta variant spreads, 
even through vaccinated people. First, 
we can’t ignore this, the fact that 
there has been this huge increase in 
cases. The national 7-day average is 
triple what it was from a month ago. 
We are averaging 40,000 new cases a 
day. 
This is a big problem, and it is over-
whelming parts of our healthcare sys-
tem. Now, I wish this weren’t the case, 
but it requires us to think about ad-
justing policy. 
Second, the CDC is looking at this 
new evidence that indicates that even 
fully vaccinated individuals who be-
come infected with the Delta variant 
can carry the virus and transmit it to 
others, even if they don’t get sick. 
Now, this latest development is impor-
tant because it allows the Delta vari-
ant, the more contagious variant, to 
spread faster. Early information from 
the CDC shows that the Delta variant 
is as contagious as the chickenpox, 
more contagious than earlier strains of 
COVID. 
And, remember, not every American 
today is vaccinated. For instance, my 
youngest son is 9 years old. He can’t 
get vaccinated. If the evidence suggests 
that I can transmit the virus to him, 
even if my vaccine prevents me from 
getting really sick, then that matters. 
Finally, with so many Americans 
still unvaccinated, the virus still has 
plenty of bodies in which to mutate. 
Right now, the good news is that we 
have got three authorized COVID–19 
vaccines 
that 
are 
pretty 
effective 
against severe illness. But the worry is 
that eventually the vaccine is going to 
mutate into a version of itself that is 
resistant to the current vaccines. And 
with so many Americans choosing to 
stay unvaccinated and evidence sug-
gesting that vaccinated people who are 
infected with the Delta variant can 
transmit 
it 
to 
people 
who 
are 
unvaccinated, the CDC has concluded 
that, right now, we need to take addi-
tional steps to cut down on the path-
ways that the virus has to spread and 
keep mutating before it is too late, and 
we have a virus that our vaccines don’t 
work against at all. 
Now, what does the new guidance 
say? It recommends that fully vac-
cinated people wear a mask in public 
indoor settings, in places in the coun-
try where there are a lot of cases. And 
since most young kids aren’t vac-
cinated, the CDC is also recommending 
that, when school opens, teachers and 
kids should wear masks. 
That is the argument that the CDC is 
making. That is the evidence upon 
which they have issued their new guid-
ance. And it is perfectly legitimate to 
contest the CDC’s decision or the rea-
sons that they gave for making the de-
cision. It is OK for anybody in this 
body to disagree with the conclusions 
that they reach. 
But that is not what Senator CRUZ 
did yesterday. He didn’t come to the 
floor and argue against the merits of 
the CDC’s argument. No. In fact, not 
once during the speech—and I watched 
the whole speech—did he ever reference 
the actual reasons for the CDC’s new 
guidance, not once. 
In fact, he claimed that the CDC of-
fered no explanation. At one point, 
after mischaracterizing the CDC’s an-
nouncement, he asked rhetorically why 
the CDC changed the guidance. ‘‘Who 
knows?’’ he said. Anyone who listened 
to that speech or, frankly, many other 
speeches that are being given by Re-
publicans all across Capitol Hill this 
week would logically come to the con-
clusion that the CDC had offered not a 
single explanation for the new guid-
ance. 
Then, after creating the impression 
that the CDC didn’t have any reasons 
for the new recommendation, the Sen-
ator from Texas announced that he had 
discovered the reason. He said that the 
real reason the CDC changed their 
guidance was because the CDC is ‘‘an 
arm of the Democratic National Com-
mittee’’ and that Democrats in Con-
gress are ‘‘faithful little foot soldiers’’ 
of the CDC. 
He offered no explanation as to why 
it would benefit Democrats politically 
or the DNC or the CDC to recommend 
mask wearing. He just simply claimed 
that the CDC was a political puppet of 
the DNC and the guidance was politi-
cally motivated. 
The closest he came to a more de-
tailed explanation of this claim was 
when he talked about the school guid-
ance. There the Senator from Texas 
claimed, without any evidence, that 
the only reason the CDC made this de-
cision was because it was demanded by

‘‘union bosses’’ and that the ‘‘CDC said 
‘Ma’am, yes, ma’am, we will issue the 
order demanded by the union bosses.’ ’’ 
That is all made up. And the Senator 
from Texas isn’t the only Republican 
saying things like this. There are doz-
ens of national Republicans making 
these same wild, unfounded allega-
tions. 
The political agenda at the CDC that 
Republicans allege is a fiction. It is 
constructed out of thin air. And it is, 
frankly, an insult to the thousands of 
dedicated, nonpolitical public health 
professionals at the CDC who just go to 
work every day trying to keep Ameri-
cans safe. 
These aren’t politicians. These are 
epidemiologists and scientists and doc-
tors who have worked their entire lives 
trying to keep this country safe. I am 
not saying they get it right every time. 
I have criticized many of the decisions 
made by the CDC during the pandemic. 
It is OK to criticize their decisions, but 
to claim that they are all corrupt, they 
are 
these 
politically 
controlled 
‘‘hacks,’’ that is an outrage. 
And rhetoric like that is going to get 
people killed because we are still in the 
middle of the epidemic, and what anti- 
CDC Republicans are doing through 
these attacks on our public health 
agencies is to intentionally undermine 
people’s faith in the Nation’s pre-
eminent 
public 
health 
institutions 
right at the moment where we need 
people to believe in them. 
I am not saying they should be im-
mune from criticism, but criticism 
should be based on the science. Contest 
the new evidence the CDC says that re-
quires people to wear masks again, but 
saying that the scientists are delib-
erately ignoring the science to effec-
tuate some top-secret political agen-
da—give me a break. 
And, by the way, what political in-
terest is served by recommending that 
people wear masks indoors again? Peo-
ple hate masks. There is only political 
downside to suggesting that people 
start wearing them again. It just belies 
plain old common sense to say that 
politics is behind the new guidance. 
If the CDC was worried about poli-
tics, they certainly wouldn’t be recom-
mending anybody wear masks again. 
And, by the way, that is all the CDC is 
doing: They are giving guidance. Over 
and over, Republicans refer to this new 
guidance as an ‘‘order’’ or, as the Sen-
ator from Texas said repeatedly, an 
‘‘edict.’’ They know that is not true. 
They know that is not true. 
But Republicans want to scare you 
into believing that the Federal Govern-
ment has more power than it does. The 
CDC doesn’t require people to do any-
thing; they issue recommendations. 
But that doesn’t suit this narrative 
about socialist, statist Democrats se-
cretly pulling the strings of their 
marionettes at the CDC. 
It is ridiculous. It is ridiculous. 
Don’t come to the Senate floor and 
make things up. Don’t destroy people’s 
reputations and careers with wild, un-
substantiated allegations about polit-
ical motivations. The CDC doesn’t get 
it right 100 percent of the time, but 
they don’t have some secret political 
agenda. But the more people believe 
that they do, the less likely it is that 
people will follow their recommenda-
tions the 90, 95 percent of the time that 
they do get it right, and that will guar-
antee that this virus never disappears. 
I understand there is an element of 
the Republican Party that just wants 
to destroy all government institutions 
and is seeking to discredit any effort 
by any public agency to do good in this 
country. In normal times, I would 
argue that that is dangerous, but in the 
middle of a pandemic it is deadly. And 
Republicans of conscience should come 
to this floor and start telling the truth. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
after weeks like this, I find it hard to 
explain to Floridians back home how 
Congress is actually working on behalf 
of their families. 
I think it is safe to say that every 
Member of the Senate believes we 
should be investing in infrastructure. 
For me, it is pretty simple. I believe we 
should invest in real infrastructure: 
roads, bridges, airports, and seaports. 
As Governor of Florida, I did just 
that. Over my 8 years as Governor, 
Florida invested $85 billion in real in-
frastructure across our State, and we 
did it while cutting taxes and fees 100 
times and paying off a third of our 
State debt. In other words, we paid for 
these big investments in infrastructure 
by growing our economy and sup-
porting job creation. That is what is 
important to Floridians, and I am im-
mensely proud of our accomplishments. 
So I support doing the exact same 
thing at the Federal level. But what we 
are doing here just doesn’t make any 
sense. Nowhere in the world does busi-
ness happen like it does here in the 
U.S. Congress. 
We started this week with ongoing 
negotiations about a big infrastructure 
deal. Of course, outside of the small 
group involved in these negotiations, 
no one here had any clue what was ac-
tually being debated. We had no text; 
we had no real information on how 
much was being spent; and we cer-
tainly had no idea how this was all sup-
posed to be paid for. 
Then, on Wednesday, we got the big 
news: A deal had been reached. Well, 
that might be great, but we still had no 
real details. We still don’t have the 
text of the bill. 
Now the majority leader expects us 
to start voting on amendments, and 
maybe even this whole package, this 
weekend. This is insanity. Nowhere in 
the world would this be the process. We 
are expected to make a decision on 
spending $1.2 trillion of American tax-
payer dollars, and no one in the U.S. 
Senate has had the chance to even read 
the bill. 
Typically, the Congressional Budget 
Office would score a bill like this be-
fore the Senate considers it. That score 
gives us important information about 
the true cost and financial impact of 
the legislation on the Federal Govern-
ment and the American people. Of 
course, that is not the case with this 
bill. The CBO hasn’t had the chance to 
review it at all. 
Do you think any company would 
sign off on a massive expense without 
all the details? Would a family make a 
huge purchase without knowing ex-
actly what it is for? Of course not. But 
that is how things work here in Con-
gress, and that is not right. 
This is exactly why I ran for the U.S. 
Senate, to make Washington work for 
Florida families and stop this madness 
of reckless spending and backroom 
deals that don’t deliver and aren’t paid 
for. 
Speaking of pay-fors, well, they just 
don’t exist in this bill. This is how 
backward and awful Washington is. 
People up here think they can just 
make big, empty promises and sell it to 
the American people. They think fami-
lies will just buy whatever they are 
selling, no questions asked. 
Nope. It is time for some account-
ability. My friend from Indiana, Sen-
ator BRAUN, recently did a great job of 
laying out the claims and facts of the 
so-called pay-fors in this bill, so I am 
going to borrow from him a bit to show 
what is really going on here. Here are 
just a few of the most ridiculous exam-
ples. 
First, half of this bill is supposedly 
paid for with $550 billion from the high-
way trust fund. That fund is $100 bil-
lion in the red. The money isn’t there. 
So that is not real. 
The bill also proposes using billions 
of repurposed COVID relief funding. I 
am all for repurposing this money, but 
we borrowed it to begin with, so this is 
robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is not 
like it is free money. 
They also want to use $49 billion in 
savings for delaying a Medicare Part D 
rebate rule and another $9 million paid 
for another year of mandatory seques-
ter. Why would we cut Medicare to pay 
for roads? 
The 4.6 million seniors in Florida de-
serve better. Any savings in the Medi-
care Program should stay in the Medi-
care Program. Let’s all remember, the 
Medicare trust fund is actually heading 
toward bankruptcy. 
And, of course, there are a handful of 
other fee increases thrown in there 
with lofty and unrealistic revenue esti-
mates that they will claim will get us 
fully paying for this $1.2 trillion pack-
age. 
What they won’t say is that these 
fees will almost certainly increase the 
costs of everyday goods and make it 
more expensive to get a mortgage and 
afford a home. 
There is no shame in Washington; 
just greed. Everyone wants so badly to 
say that they have given you some-
thing, but they always forget to men-
tion the cost and that you actually

have to pay for it. The cost is impor-
tant. 
I have said it a million times, and I 
will say it again: Reckless government 
spending causes higher inflation. It is a 
proven fact. And we are seeing the con-
sequences of reckless spending across 
America right now. 
Eighty-seven 
percent—eighty-seven 
percent—of 
Americans 
are 
worried 
about inflation. Low- and fixed-income 
families are having to cut back on pur-
chases because of rising costs. I am 
hearing it from families across Florida 
who are worried. 
A father of three in Jacksonville is 
temporarily helping take care of two 
other kids because their father is out 
of work. He has started working a sec-
ond job driving Uber just to pay for 
groceries that are rapidly increasing in 
price. Now his Uber job is becoming 
less and less profitable because of the 
rising price of gas. Gas is up over 50 
percent in 1 year. 
A mother of four in Wauchula said 
that she used to be able to go to the 
grocery store and spend a certain 
amount for an entire month’s gro-
ceries. Now she can’t. Two hundred dol-
lars in meat is no longer enough to feed 
her family of five. She has been forced 
to choose between gas to get to work 
and groceries for her family and is 
picking up extra jobs just to make ends 
meet. 
I can relate to this. I grew up in a 
poor family. My mom would take in 
ironing for extra money. She would 
give either my older brother or me the 
exact change to go to the grocery 
store, but she said: You have to check 
the price of everything because things 
are going up in price, and if we don’t 
have enough money, you cannot buy it. 
A restaurant owner in Tampa told 
me that the cost of meat has gone up 
from $9 a pound to $18. Gas prices and 
food prices, coupled with the struggle 
to find workers, have been very hard on 
his business. 
Another family in Kissimmee told 
me how hard it is to keep food on the 
table because everything is so expen-
sive. They are having trouble keeping 
their car because of the cost of mainte-
nance and gas, but if he doesn’t have a 
car, he wouldn’t have a way to get to 
work to take care of his family. 
The price of gas affects nearly every-
one. Right now, average gas prices are 
up nearly a dollar since last year. For 
a family who fills up their gas tank 
once a week, if they drive a car, that 
means Joe Biden raised their expenses 
$600 a year. If they drive a truck, Joe 
Biden raised their expenses by $1,000 a 
year. 
So next time you hear a big promise, 
remember these stories. These are real 
people bearing the real cost of the 
Democrats’ reckless spending in Wash-
ington. 
Biden and the Democrats say they 
care about people, but they have done 
absolutely nothing to help families 
struggle to keep up with inflation. 
Their plan is to spend more money, not 
less. 
We have nearly $30 trillion in debt, 
and there are no plans to slow down. 
And that is exactly what we are seeing 
in this bill. We can’t forget that this is 
just the start. CHUCK SCHUMER said it 
on the floor yesterday. This is just part 
one and leads to Biden’s and the Demo-
crats’ $5.5 trillion tax-and-spending 
spree on their liberal priorities. These 
two bills are together. They are welded 
together. There is no separating them. 
Right now, the message that Presi-
dent Biden and Democrats here in 
Washington are sending to the Amer-
ican people is clear: They don’t care 
about inflation. They don’t care that 
their reckless spending is causing 
prices to skyrocket. If that is the cost 
of getting their liberal wish list, so be 
it. They aren’t focused on inflation or 
spending, just on more government de-
pendency and control. 
Just look at what is happening this 
week with new COVID mask and vac-
cine mandates. I had COVID, and I got 
the vaccine. I think people should get 
vaccinated. But that is not what this is 
about. It is not about taking a meas-
ured 
approach 
and 
following 
the 
science and telling exactly how they 
came to the conclusion. It is about cre-
ating fear and chaos to grab power and 
control you. 
I am here to say that enough is 
enough. It is time to wake up to re-
ality. It is time for every fiscally re-
sponsible Member of the Senate to join 
me to say we don’t accept the status 
quo. We won’t watch in silence while 
the futures of our children and our 
grandchildren are mortgaged and this 
Nation is driven deeper in debt with 
reckless and wasteful spending. We 
won’t stand by while inflation wreaks 
havoc on our families and businesses. 
We can get spending under control, but 
we have to start accepting responsi-
bility, and the time to do that is now. 
This isn’t political. It is good govern-
ment, and it is common sense. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
NOMINATION OF UR MENDOZA JADDOU 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for al-
most 20 years, U.S. Citizenship and Im-
migration Services, known as USCIS, 
has been charged with defending Amer-
ica’s status as the land of opportunity. 
The Agency has nearly 20,000 employ-
ees. They operate in 220 offices around 
the world, where they provide assist-
ance to immigrants seeking a new life 
in America and help protect America 
from any foreign threats. 
But after 4 years of neglect and mis-
management under the Trump admin-
istration, USCIS is in dire need of lead-
ership. Today, the Senate has an oppor-
tunity to provide that Agency with 
that 
leadership 
by 
confirming 
Ur 
Jaddou as USCIS Director. Ms. Jaddou 
may be the most qualified person ever 
to be nominated for this job. She has 
nearly 20 years of experience in immi-
gration law, policy, and administra-
tion. She is the daughter of immi-
grants from Mexico and Iraq. She per-
sonally understands the importance of 
ensuring our Nation’s immigration sys-
tem is both accessible and safe. And if 
confirmed, Ms. Jaddou would make his-
tory as the very first woman to lead 
USCIS. 
Let me tell you a little bit about her 
background. Ms. Jaddou began her ca-
reer working on immigration policy 
and oversight for 9 years in the House 
of Representatives. She worked for my 
friend and former colleague ZOE LOF-
GREN of California, who is the authori-
tative voice on immigration in the 
House of Representatives. 
Following that role, Ms. Jaddou 
served as a senior official in the State 
Department and then as Chief Counsel 
at USCIS. As the Agency’s highest 
ranking legal officer, Ms. Jaddou not 
only sharpened her mastery of immi-
gration law, she also gained valuable 
experience navigating USCIS’s admin-
istrative complexities and operations. 
As Chief Counsel at this Agency, she 
managed more than 220 attorneys who 
support the work of tens of thousands 
of USCIS employees who are located in 
offices around the world. 
Ms. Jaddou’s extensive background is 
exactly what we need at this moment. 
As I mentioned, the Trump adminis-
tration led a deliberate effort to under-
mine this Agency’s work. You remem-
ber—anything relating to immigration, 
the Trump administration tried to cre-
ate a problem. For instance, when the 
former President took office, USCIS 
had approximately $800 million in cash 
reserves. Not bad. Four years later, 
those cash reserves had been virtually 
depleted, putting thousands of Federal 
employees at the Agency at risk of 
being furloughed in the middle of a 
pandemic. 
These 
Federal 
employees 
deserve 
leadership that advocates for their in-
terests and supports their work. Ms. 
Jaddou is that person. In fact, the 
union 
that 
represents 
over 
13,000 
USCIS employees published a letter in 
support of her nomination, writing: 
‘‘Ms. Jaddou is well-acquainted with 
the significant financial and oper-
ational challenges facing the Agency.’’ 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent 
a letter in support of her nomination 
as well. They wrote: ‘‘Ms. Jaddou’s 
knowledge and experience would be in-
dispensable in providing the critical 
leadership needed to stabilize the agen-
cy.’’ 
Leaders inside government and out-
side government recognize that Ms. 
Jaddou is the legal expert our Nation 
needs to take the reins of this vital 
Agency. 
Given the urgent need for Senate- 
confirmed leadership to address the 
critical issues they face, as well as Ms. 
Jaddou’s eminent qualifications for 
that position, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting her nomination. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5207 
July 30, 2021 
There is something called the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan that President Joe 
Biden brought before Congress. The 
American Rescue Plan was his first of-
fering. We had done things before in 
light of the pandemic. I remember 
them well. It was March of 2020. We had 
the American CARES Act. 
The American CARES Act—there 
was virtually unanimous, bipartisan 
support for a policy that was written 
by President Trump as well as Mem-
bers of Congress. We stood together, 
and I am glad we did, because we were 
going into a pandemic, the likes of 
which America has not seen for 100 
years. It was a dramatic investment in 
people, in resources, and in businesses 
to keep America safe through that pan-
demic, and it worked. 
At the end of the year of 2020, we had 
another bill—this bill was about $900 
billion—to once again help deal with 
unemployment compensation, loans for 
businesses, help for families, ways to 
help schools reopen. We voted again 
unanimously—virtually unanimously— 
on a bipartisan basis. 
So in the Trump administration, 
when it came to coming together as a 
nation, Democrats stood with Repub-
licans. Democrats even stood with a 
Republican President for the good of 
the Nation. I was proud of what we did. 
I can’t imagine what America would 
have been like without it. 
Then came the election. All bets were 
off. Everything changed. After the elec-
tion and the Big Lie, where President 
Trump raced around the country—still 
does—claiming that he truly won the 
election and having no proof or evi-
dence to that fact, we noticed a souring 
of this bipartisanship when it came to 
dealing with the pandemic. 
Then came the American Rescue 
Plan by President Biden, the new 
President, 
who 
wanted 
to 
address 
issues that still were troubling Amer-
ica in light of the pandemic. What hap-
pened then when we called the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan? Where was the bipar-
tisanship that we had seen during the 
Trump years? Completely gone. Not 
one single Republican Senator, includ-
ing the Senator from Florida, was will-
ing to stand up and vote for Joe 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan; not one 
Member of the Republican Party in the 
House of Representatives. 
So what was it that was in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan that was so objec-
tionable that not a single Republican 
would vote for it? Well, there were 
some ideas that turned out to be vital. 
One of them was to put enough 
money into the Biden administration 
so that these lifesaving vaccines could 
be 
distributed 
around 
the 
United 
States of America and people could fi-
nally get a shot in the arm and save 
their lives by it. That was one of the 
things the Republicans weren’t willing 
to vote for, but it wasn’t the only one. 
We proceeded to give loans to busi-
nesses again so that they could open up 
and rehire their employees. Not a sin-
gle Republican would vote to support 
that. We have $1,400 being sent to each 
and every family in America—a prom-
ise made by President Trump, kept by 
President Biden—and not a single Re-
publican would vote to support that as 
well. 
When you go through the list of 
things that we did in the American 
Rescue Plan, they were valuable. 
One of them was a tax cut for fami-
lies, families with children—a tax cut 
which started just a couple of weeks 
ago. Tax cuts used to be the war cry of 
the Republican Party, but when it 
came to tax cuts for children, not a 
single Republican Senator would vote 
for it—not one. And now they come and 
they argue: This Joe Biden’s plan just 
isn’t working. 
Well, I will tell you what is working. 
We have about 50 or 60 percent of 
Americans vaccinated with at least one 
shot at this point. I hope we have more 
so we can put this pandemic behind us. 
We have done it because we had a plan 
to distribute this vaccine across Amer-
ica and still do. That was something 
America needed, and not a single Re-
publican Senator would vote for it—not 
one. 
I can’t understand their thinking on 
this. They have lots of criticism about 
President Biden, but when it came to 
the parts of his program that really 
made a difference when America need-
ed it, not a single one of them would 
join us. 
Wouldn’t it be good to get back to bi-
partisanship, such as the bill that we 
are going to be debating on the floor, 
the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
bill, 
which the Senator from Florida does 
not support, he said? 
This notion of bipartisanship appears 
to be very troubling and difficult for 
many of my Republican colleagues, but 
we have a chance here because 16 Re-
publicans, the night before last, cast a 
vote in favor of moving forward to real-
ly have an opportunity to do some-
thing significant for this country and 
its economy. 
An investment in infrastructure is an 
investment in the future of this coun-
try. I hope that the Republicans will 
join us to see this completed in the 
next few days so we can move on to 
other considerations of elements that 
might be good in this recovery. But we 
need their help. 
To have Republican Senators come to 
the floor, refuse to vote for the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, and criticize even 
this bipartisan effort, is a suggestion 
that they didn’t get the message: 
America is looking for us to cooperate, 
to come together to solve problems, 
not just to create political headlines. 
We will have a chance, and I hope we 
do soon, to vote for this bill. I think it 
is an important bill that is going to re-
vitalize this country and keep the 
economy on the move. 
VOTE ON JADDOU NOMINATION 
Before I yield the floor, I ask unani-
mous consent that all remaining time 
be yielded back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Jaddou nomi-
nation? 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from California (Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN), the Senator from Maine (Mr. 
KING), and the Senator from Vermont 
(Mr. SANDERS) are necessarily absent.

S5208 
July 30, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). On this vote the yeas are 47, the 
nays are 34. 
The nomination is confirmed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the motion to re-
consider is considered made and laid 
upon the table, and the President will 
be immediately notified of the Senate’s 
actions. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
REMEMBERING CARL LEVIN 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I stand here with colleagues— 
my partner, Senator PETERS, and, of 
course, Senator REED and other col-
leagues—to pay tribute to an incredible 
leader and my dear friend who dedi-
cated his life to serving the people of 
his beloved State of Michigan and this 
Nation—Senator Carl Levin. 
Senator Carl Levin was many things: 
a crusader for truth and justice, in the 
real sense of the word; a man of strong 
convictions; a mentor to so many of us. 
He was a Senator’s Senator and a 
tireless 
advocate 
every 
day—every 
day—for the people of Michigan. 
He was also my friend, and it was 
truly an honor of a lifetime for me to 
represent 
Michigan 
alongside 
Carl 
Levin for 14 years of his 36 years that 
he served in the Senate. 
Thirty-six years is a long time, but 
Senator Levin remained effective and 
at the same time humble right up until 
the final day he served. That is because 
integrity never goes out of style and 
Senator Carl Levin never wavered in 
his dedication to do what was right— 
what was right for the people of Michi-
gan and our country. 
Perhaps 
he 
will 
be 
remembered 
most—although there are so many 
things—for his incredible leadership on 
the Armed Services Committee. Patri-
otism was a lot more than a flag pin or 
a pledge to Carl Levin. He understood 
more than anybody what it takes to 
defend our Nation. Perhaps no one has 
done more to ensure that our men and 
women in uniform are battle ready 
with the supplies and technology that 
they need and the fair pay and benefits 
they have earned. 
In fact, Senator Levin worked so 
hard on behalf of our military that he 
received 
a 
Department 
of 
Defense 
Medal for Distinguished Public Serv-
ice. There is a suite of offices at the 
Pentagon named after him, and there 
is a naval destroyer currently being 
built in Maine that will probably bear 
his name: the USS Carl M. Levin. It was 
so inspiring to be with him during the 
naming ceremony in Detroit back in 
2016. 
It is fitting that he should be hon-
ored in this way because Carl Levin al-
ways believed that our government 
could be a force for good. This belief 
was passed down to him from his par-
ents, who saw firsthand how the New 
Deal rescued families from desperate 
poverty. 
A young Carl Levin admired Harry S. 
Truman, especially Senator Truman, 
who drove cross-country investigating 
defense contractors who were commit-
ting fraud and wasting billions of dol-
lars. I think Truman himself would 
have been incredibly impressed with 
Carl’s leadership of the Senate Perma-
nent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
A former civil rights attorney, Carl 
Levin relished the chance to cross-ex-
amine those he suspected of ripping off 
taxpayers and the public. His com-
mittee room was never a literal trial 
by fire, but he certainly turned up the 
heat on unscrupulous executives, spe-
cial interests, or anybody who tried to 
get rich at the expense of everyday 
Americans. 
Those 
executives 
were 
sweating because they knew that Sen-
ator Levin had done his homework. He 
would dig so deep that he knew more 
about what they were going to say 
than they would. 
Carl Levin could topple a tycoon 
with nothing more than a stack of sub-
poenaed documents. And we saw him 
do it. In 2007, he shined a light on abu-
sive practices by credit card compa-
nies, leading to laws that required 
more transparency. Even today, your 
credit card statement contains more 
disclosures 
and 
more 
information, 
thanks to Senator Carl Levin. 
His fellow Michiganders got to see a 
kinder, gentler side of Carl as well, and 
I know we did as colleagues. And I will 
never forget how his eyes sparkled 
when he smiled, with his glasses down 
on the end of his nose. 
His heart was always in Detroit, 
where he was born and raised and lived 
his entire life. Meanwhile, his soul was 
nourished by the tranquility he found 
in beautiful northern Michigan in the 
Upper 
Peninsula, 
especially 
Isle 
Royale. 
Carl helped Detroit make one of the 
most spectacular comebacks in Amer-
ican history, and everywhere you look, 
you can see evidence of his hard work. 
The Levin Center at Wayne State Law 
teaches future attorneys and business 
leaders and lawmakers and public serv-
ants how legislative oversight can be a 
tool for change and a force for good. He 
led the way on getting Federal funding 
for Detroit’s beautiful International 
RiverWalk, which, today, features 3 
miles of parks, nature areas, and 
breathtaking waterfront views. 
In the midst of the Great Recession, 
we worked together closely to rescue 
our American auto industry, which for 
years had been battered by the forces 
of globalization. Carl Levin understood 
that manufacturing is the backbone of 
our State’s economy and that our 
country needs to make things in order 
to have them. 
As a member of the Small Business 
Committee, Carl also understood the 
importance of small business. In fact, 
in getting dressed today, I was looking 
at what I could wear that would sym-
bolize Detroit, and I picked out a neck-
lace that reminds me of what moti-
vated Carl in Detroit with small busi-
nesses. 
Amy Peterson is a Detroit entre-
preneur 
who 
wanted 
to 
empower 
women who have employment barriers, 
and Senator PETERS and I have both 
visited her shop. So, in 2013, she cre-
ated Rebel Nell jewelry out of graffiti 
that had fallen off of walls on the sides 
of buildings. Today, she is incredibly 
successful, and she is empowering and 
employing women throughout the De-
troit area. 
Carl loved efforts like that. He cham-
pioned small businesses, folks who 
wanted to—one after the other, have an 
idea and get it going. 
Carl also understood that our land-
scape, our soil, our water are part of 
our Michigan way of life. That is why 
he pushed for years to have land at 
Sleeping Bear Dunes protected as wil-
derness—our beautiful dunes. 
Senator Levin fought for the Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary at Thunder 
Bay in Alpena and for the creation of 
the Keweenaw National Historic Park. 
It was an honor partnering with him in 
every single fight to protect our Great 
Lakes. 
I can stand here for hours listing 
Senator Carl Levin’s accomplishments, 
but they still only are a small testa-
ment to his character, his compassion, 
his humor, his strength of conviction. 
President Truman once said: 
Make no little plans. [Make no little 
plans.] Make the biggest one you can think 
of and spend the rest of your life carrying it 
out. 
Senator Carl Levin lived those words 
every day. He wanted to make our 
State and our country the best it can 
be, and he spent his life doing every-
thing he could to make that happen. 
I wish his beloved wife and life part-
ner Barbara; his brother and best 
friend Sandy; his nephew and our col-
league ANDY
LEVIN; his wonderful 
daughters Kate, Laura, and Erica; his 
grandchildren; and all of the family my 
deepest condolences and profound grat-
itude for your willingness to share this 
great man with all of us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the memory of a true 
lion of the U.S. Senate, Michigan Sen-
ator Carl Levin. Yesterday, he passed 
away at the age of 87, surrounded by 
his loving family. 
Carl was well known as a fierce advo-
cate for Michigan and a force of nature 
in the Senate, but the most important 
thing to him was his family. He cher-
ished his role as a brother, husband, fa-
ther, uncle, and grandfather. And I 
know his family and his loved ones are 
all reeling from this enormous loss. I 
along with folks all across the State of 
Michigan are praying for them during 
this very difficult time. 
Over his 36 years of service to the 
Senate, the most ever for a Michigan 
Senator, Carl made an immeasurable 
impact. He served as the chairman of 
not just one, but two extremely power-
ful committees. He was simultaneously 
a zealous progressive voice in the Sen-
ate and one of its most bipartisan

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5209 
July 30, 2021 
Members, able to forge strong relation-
ships with his Republican colleagues 
and find pragmatic compromise to get 
results. 
I remember when Carl was first elect-
ed to the U.S. Senate, making a very 
impressive leap from the Detroit City 
Council to a statewide office. I was in 
college at the time, and over the years, 
I closely followed his service and his 
career in politics. He was someone who 
I looked up to and came to know as 
both a role model and as a mentor. 
He was always gracious with his time 
and his wisdom, and I cherish the con-
versations that we had over the years, 
from my time years ago serving in the 
Michigan State Senate to my time in 
the U.S. House of Representatives. 
When Carl announced he would be re-
tiring in 2014, I sought out his guidance 
and his blessing to run to fill his seat. 
As the campaign progressed, he gave 
me his endorsement and his full- 
throated support. I was both honored 
and humbled. 
When I was sworn into my first term 
in the Senate, Carl presented me with 
an old map of Michigan and a hand-
written note. It hangs in my front of-
fice to this day, and every time that I 
walk through the door, I am reminded 
of Carl, of his service, and his integ-
rity. 
Carl was a unique figure on Capitol 
Hill. 
He 
had 
no 
interest 
in 
the 
trappings of power. He saw service as 
its own reward. And he could certainly 
be a little disheveled in his appearance. 
He was very frugal. He wore inexpen-
sive suits, and his loving wife Barbara 
would routinely sew up the holes in his 
pockets so he could get just a few more 
years out of his suits. Legend has it he 
once noticed a mustard stain on his 
shirt and he painted over it with Wite- 
Out so he could get back to work. His 
glasses 
were 
always 
precariously 
perched on the end of his nose, and he 
would fix you with a piercing gaze over 
those rims. Despite his small stature, 
he was also an incredibly intimidating 
figure, largely due to that gaze, his in-
tellect, and his incredible work ethic. 
Nowhere were those traits more ap-
parent than in his role leading the Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions, also known as PSI. When Carl 
held the gavel, getting a letter or a 
phone call from his investigative staff 
struck fear into some of the most pow-
erful and most corrupt figures in Amer-
ica. In fact, folks in Washington would 
quip that under Carl’s leadership, the 
letters ‘‘PSI’’ had a completely dif-
ferent meaning for people: They stood 
for ‘‘pretty scary investigations.’’ 
Carl used his chairmanship to stand 
up 
for 
everyday 
folks—the 
Michiganders 
and 
Americans—who 
were working hard every day to pay 
their bills and play by the rules. He 
was furious when there were people 
who took advantage of hard-working 
Americans, and there were companies 
who were making millions and even 
billions of dollars cheating on their 
taxes and hurting average taxpayers. 
Over the course of his tenure as 
chair, he took on the corrupt, the 
wrongdoers, and the bullies who no one 
wanted to stand up to, including major 
banks, the mob, and even ruthless dic-
tators. 
He brought a studious focus to his 
work, reviewing thousands, and some-
times even tens of thousands, of pages 
of documents so that he would know 
every single detail in that investiga-
tion. His investigative staff recounted 
that when he was preparing for a flight 
to Hong Kong, he asked for a binder 
full of documents related to the latest 
investigation to review on the plane. 
His staff put together 1,500 pages of 
documents for him to read on that 
flight. When he landed in Hong Kong, 
he called and asked his staff to send 
the next batch. He had already made 
his way through those 1,500 pages, and 
he wanted to see more. 
In every investigation he was tough 
but scrupulously fair. He was dis-
ciplined and laser-focused on address-
ing injustices. And he was dedicated to 
seeing a fight through to the end, even 
if it took years. 
Over the years, he tackled money 
laundering, abusive offshore tax shel-
ters, and executives and bankers who 
cooked the books, dodged taxes, and 
cost workers their savings, their pen-
sions, and healthcare. One of his great-
est legacies at PSI was his work to 
hold bad actors in the Federal sector 
accountable for their abuses. 
In fact, after seeing unfair charges on 
his own credit card and hearing similar 
stories 
from 
his 
constituents, 
he 
launched an investigation into preda-
tory credit practices, including charg-
ing interest on debt that was already 
paid, hiking interest rates even when 
bills were paid on time, and manipu-
lating charges to try to secure addi-
tional fees. 
After a series of tough oversight 
hearings and a legislative process that 
spanned years, Carl’s work became a 
central part of the Credit CARD Act of 
2009, which prohibited abuse of credit 
card practices and helped more than 
100 million Americans. He even cast his 
11,000th vote during the process of get-
ting that bill passed. 
Whether he was taking on Enron or 
Goldman Sachs or exposing the corrup-
tion 
of 
Chilean 
dictator 
Augusto 
Pinochet, Carl was focused on holding 
the bad guys accountable and pro-
tecting the American people from their 
misconduct. 
And despite serving at a time when 
Congress was growing increasingly par-
tisan, he managed to bridge the divide. 
His staunchest conservative colleagues 
knew that if Carl gave them his word, 
they could count on it 100 percent. 
Whether he was working with Senator 
Coburn or Senator COLLINS, Carl was 
able to cooperatively work with his Re-
publican colleagues, setting an iconic 
example for how to conduct bipartisan 
oversight that my own committee staff 
today still strives to follow. 
Carl carried that same partisan prin-
ciple to his role as chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee, a role that 
he served in for 18 years. Whether he 
was working alongside the late Senator 
John Warner or the late Senator John 
McCain, Carl found bipartisan, com-
monsense ways to support our Nation’s 
servicemembers and combat waste and 
fraud within the Department of De-
fense, and he worked tirelessly to 
strengthen national security and to 
keep our Nation safe. 
Even though Carl took on such high 
profile, nationally important roles, he 
never forgot his roots and the lessons 
he learned about listening to your com-
munity during his time as a Detroit 
city councilman. He was a powerful ad-
vocate for all of Michigan, but espe-
cially for his hometown of Detroit. 
I distinctly remember his determina-
tion as our Michigan congressional del-
egation fought to rescue Michigan’s 
auto industry when it was on the brink 
of total collapse. As our senior Senator 
at the time, Carl led our delegation 
with quiet but steady resolve. At a 
time when so much was on the line for 
Michigan, Carl helped fight for General 
Motors 
and 
Chrysler, 
which 
was 
headquartered in my district, and to 
save the jobs of Michigan autoworkers 
and everyone who depended on them. 
Carl was a champion for Michigan’s 
auto industry and a true believer in the 
Motor City’s ability to lead in vehicle 
innovation. He was such a believer in 
the future of Detroit’s auto industry 
that he even bought one of Chevrolet’s 
first electric vehicles, the Chevy Volt. 
As a former taxi driver in his youth, 
Carl loved driving himself around, even 
if his erratic and aggressive driving 
style startled and sometimes scared his 
staff. And although Carl was ready to 
put his own money behind the future of 
Detroit, Capitol Hill wasn’t quite so 
ready for electric vehicles. Without 
readily accessible charging stations on 
the Hill, Carl actually ran an extension 
cord out of his window of his Russell 
Office Building to recharge his car’s 
battery. 
He also fought relentlessly to build 
public transportation in Detroit. He 
had a vision of light rail that would 
transport people through downtown 
Detroit, and when he believed in some-
thing, he wouldn’t take no for an an-
swer, even when the administration of 
his own party rejected requests to fund 
the Detroit rail project. 
I recall vividly a meeting between 
Carl, the Detroit representatives, and 
then-Transportation 
Secretary 
LaHood, and in classic Carl Levin 
style, he peered over the rims of his 
glasses, held a fistful of papers, and 
shook them at the Secretary’s direc-
tion as he railed about how we had an-
gels in Detroit who were willing to in-
vest in this project, but we need the 
public sector to support it to get across 
the finish line. 
His arguments were persuasive, and, 
today, you can ride the QLINE down 
Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit 
because Carl Levin was so determined 
to make it a reality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5210 
July 30, 2021 
President Barack Obama captured 
Carl’s legacy perfectly when he said, 
upon Carl’s retirement, that ‘‘if you’ve 
ever worn the uniform, worked a shift 
on an assembly line or sacrificed to 
make ends meet, then you had a voice 
and a vote in Sen. Carl Levin.’’ 
But perhaps Carl’s greatest legacy is 
the example he set for all of us. Carl’s 
colleagues, his staff, and his constitu-
ents all agree that one of his most pow-
erful traits was his integrity. He had 
strong values and a moral compass 
that always pointed north. Even years 
after he retired, as I traveled around 
Michigan, folks still tell me how much 
they respected Carl. They knew that 
even if they didn’t agree with him, he 
was thoughtful and he was considerate. 
And they would tell me that while they 
may not always agree with Carl’s 
votes, they respected his decision mak-
ing, and they trusted what he was 
doing and thought was best for Michi-
gan and the country. 
Those same principles inspired such 
strong loyalty in his staff that he be-
came known for having staff members 
who worked for him for decades. Carl’s 
fearlessness, thoughtfulness, and inde-
pendence marked the epitome of what 
it means to be a public servant. He fol-
lowed his conscience, and he always 
fought to do what was best for his 
home State and for his country. 
Carl’s principled leadership, his dedi-
cation for finding common ground, his 
relentless pursuit of the truth, and his 
constant focus on ensuring that our 
country works for every American 
should serve as a model for all of us. 
I am forever grateful to Carl for his 
leadership, his mentorship, and for his 
example. I will always remember the 
advice he gave me on election night, 
after I was declared the winner. He 
pulled me aside and said: Just remem-
ber, Gary, in the Senate there will be 
people who will try to pull you in all 
sorts of directions, but never forget 
where you came from, never forget who 
you are, and always work to bring peo-
ple together, despite the partisanship 
and polarization around you. 
We live in tough times, but he re-
minded me that people back home in 
Michigan are expecting me to get 
things done and deliver results. It is 
advice that guides me every day. 
Carl truly represented the best of 
public service. He did his homework 
and knew the issues inside and out. He 
focused on doing what was right for 
Michigan and for our country. He never 
had an alternative agenda. He didn’t 
chase front-page headlines or the cam-
eras. He had no desire to be a political 
celebrity. He just wanted to get things 
done. 
Carl’s light in this world will be sore-
ly missed, but the best thing we can do 
to honor his memory is to live by the 
same principles, integrity, and kind-
ness that drove his leadership and pub-
lic service for five decades. Carl loved 
doing his job, and he did it with bound-
less energy. Whether it was greeting 
his constituents on the street or taking 
on some of the toughest issues in 
Washington, everyone was always try-
ing to keep up with Carl. 
If we could all bring just a fraction of 
his dedication, his integrity, and his 
intellect to our own worlds, Wash-
ington would surely be a much better 
place. May his memory be a blessing. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Rhode Is-
land. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, first 
let me thank Senator STABENOW and 
Senator PETERS
for bringing us to-
gether to recognize an extraordinary 
gentleman, an extraordinary friend, 
and, for me, an extraordinary mentor, 
Senator Carl Levin. 
I want to begin by offering my deep-
est sympathies to Carl’s family, his 
wife Barbara, their wonderful daugh-
ters and grandchildren, his brother 
Sandy, and his nephew Congressman 
ANDY
LEVIN. Those who knew him 
knew that Carl was, above all else, a 
loving father, a devoted husband, and a 
profoundly compassionate man. Today, 
we mourn with the entire Levin family. 
I would like to take just a few min-
utes to reflect on his remarkable life 
and legacy. Carl served 36 years in the 
U.S. Senate and made every single day 
count. He was a gentleman and a 
statesman, a true champion for Michi-
gan, for working families, for justice, 
and especially for the men and women 
of the U.S. military. Throughout his 
long and wide-ranging career, he car-
ried with him a constant, enduring 
commitment to service. 
From his earliest days growing up in 
Detroit, Carl understood what service 
meant. He worked his way up as an 
auto factory worker and taxi driver to 
get to law school and then to the 
Michigan Civil Rights Commission, 
where he dedicated his early career to 
service as a public defender. From 
there, he committed himself even fur-
ther to the people of Detroit, serving 8 
years on the city council and fighting 
constantly to advance the civil rights 
of his constituents. 
His 31⁄2 decades in the Senate truly 
defined his commitment to service, and 
his accomplishments are monumental. 
While Carl is particularly associated 
with national defense, as the chairman 
of the Armed Services Committee, he 
was one of the most productive, effec-
tive congressional investigators and 
legislators of his era—or any era. 
Wielding his gavel on the Senate Per-
manent Subcommittee on Investiga-
tions with great clout and distinction, 
he was relentless in going after waste, 
fraud, abuse, and corruption whenever 
and wherever he saw it. 
He didn’t shy from tough issues. He 
worked tirelessly to expose major cor-
porate tax avoidance and evasion, 
knowing that it was unfair for working 
men and women to pay their share 
while corporations found loopholes to 
pay nothing. 
Carl changed the very way our gov-
ernment worked, using his legislative 
powers, his backbone, and his brain to 
take on the most powerful institutions 
in America on behalf of not just the lit-
tle guy but a healthier republic. 
Serving alongside Carl Levin on the 
Armed Services Committee was one of 
the greatest privileges of my life. We 
liked to joke that we were friends and 
we traveled together so much because I 
made Carl feel tall and he made me feel 
like the most elegant dresser in the 
United States of America. 
I was always intrigued during our 11 
trips overseas together—mostly to bat-
tlegrounds—when I would try to pack 
light, my experience in the military 
having suggested that. Carl would show 
up with a little bag—just a little black 
bag. And I would think, ‘‘How could he 
get through these 5, 6, 7 days of trips 
with just that?’’ Then I discovered the 
answer. We would have a meeting with 
a Prime Minister, for example, and he 
would have his coat and his tie and his 
white shirt on and his slacks. And then 
he would get ready to go to the field. 
He would just take his coat off or undo 
his tie, roll up his sleeves, and head out 
to the field. Then we would come back 
to have another meeting, and he would 
put his tie back on. It was the Carl 
Levin method. And as much as I tried 
to emulate it, I could not. 
He was one of the most incredibly 
genuine 
and 
kind 
individuals 
you 
would ever meet. 
When he took on his duties on the 
Armed Services Committee, he under-
stood that national security is not a 
partisan issue, and he maintained a 
spirit of bipartisanship that continues 
to motivate all of us. 
He also understood that national se-
curity requires more than just defense. 
So he was an active supporter of diplo-
macy and international organizations. 
Throughout his life, Senator Levin 
was a steadying force in turbulent 
times in global affairs. He was a 
staunch advocate for NATO, recog-
nizing that our national power is en-
hanced by strong alliances with other 
democracies. He also lent crucial sup-
port to the START Treaty between the 
United States and Russia, limiting and 
reducing the number of nuclear weap-
ons on this planet. And he later sup-
ported the Nunn-Lugar legislation that 
removed 
many 
unsecured 
nuclear 
weapons after the collapse of the So-
viet Union. 
But, most profoundly, Carl always 
recognized that the dedication and sac-
rifice of our servicemembers is funda-
mental to our military security. I feel 
that in every critical decision he made, 
he viewed it through the eyes of those 
young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and 
marines on the ground—what would his 
decisions mean to them? That is why 
he traveled to countless outposts and 
ships to see for himself the needs of our 
men and women in uniform and to 
thank our troops personally for their 
service. And I was privileged to travel 
with him many, many times and to 
witness his concern for those who 
served.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5211 
July 30, 2021 
At this moment, my mind is awash 
with memories and images; for exam-
ple, in 1997, standing with Carl before a 
crowd of 50,000 pro-democratic Serbians 
in Belgrade, calling for a democracy to 
replace the dictator, Milosevic. It was 
a moving moment. In 2003, visiting our 
troops in Iraq—one of the first codels 
to enter Iraq—to find out for ourselves 
what was happening; what the troops 
needed; what we could do to protect 
them and give them the tools to do 
their job; and in 2009, crowded to-
gether, sitting on the floor on carpets 
with Afghan leaders in a small village, 
trying to determine a path forward. 
Carl always led by example and with 
decency and integrity. 
Later this summer, it will be the 
honor of my life to speak at the com-
missioning of the U.S. Navy’s newest 
warship, the USS Carl M. Levin. It is a 
great and formidable ship, bearing the 
name of a great and formidable man. I 
wish more than anything that Carl 
could be there to witness the tremen-
dous honor for his namesake ship’s 
commissioning. But Carl always did 
prefer to avoid the spotlight and the 
fanfare, and, I think, perhaps he will be 
smiling even wider as he looks from 
above at the christening of that ship. 
Carl’s life was defined by service, and 
we should all be grateful to be part of 
the legacy that he created in this very 
Chamber. His loss is immeasurable, but 
I am grateful for his lifetime of con-
tributions to the people of Michigan 
and the people of our Nation. 
We can best honor Senator Levin by 
carrying out his ideals and example in 
what we do here and what we do for the 
Nation, and, particularly, what we do 
for the brave young men and women 
who serve this Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to add my voice to my col-
leagues in remembering and paying our 
respects to our dear friend and former 
colleague Senator Carl Levin, whom we 
sadly lost last night. 
My colleagues have been sharing 
their stories and their experiences of 
this incredible human being, this amaz-
ing Senator, and I want to share one of 
my own, a story of how he made an im-
pact on my life and my approach to 
being a Senator. 
It was back in 2009, when we had an 
enormous collapse of our economic sys-
tem. I came here as a freshman Sen-
ator, and we were working to say what 
happened and how can we prevent this 
from happening again. A lot of what 
happened was enormously leveraged 
bets made in the Wall Street casino. A 
staff member of mine kept saying, you 
have got to read this essay by Chair-
man Volcker about how we take and 
shut down this Wall Street casino and 
how it puts our entire economy at risk 
and will do so again in the future again 
if we don’t act. 
After two or three times that my 
team member had approached me on 
this, I put out an email to all of the 
Senators and said: Here is the chal-
lenge that is presented, and here is 
what we need to do to protect the fu-
ture economy. Would anyone join me 
in 
undertaking 
to 
establish 
this 
Volcker rule to shut down the Wall 
Street casino? 
The next day, I came to the floor of 
the Senate, and Carl Levin comes up to 
me. And he says: About your email 
from yesterday, about your email, I 
want to join you in that project. 
He knew a lot about this issue, and 
he had staff members who knew a lot 
about this issue. Then he went on to 
say: And you may think because you 
are new and I have been here for a 
while that I am going to sweep in and 
take this over. He said: But I want to 
tell you, I am not going to do that. I 
don’t want to do that. I want to work 
in full partnership with you, together. 
And that is what it became, this full 
partnership: our team members work-
ing closely together, Carl and I work-
ing closely together, no one leading, if 
you will, or, to put it differently, lead-
ing together. And it had many, many 
chapters in this effort. 
It was not an easy path to say the big 
banks needed to change how they oper-
ate. But what struck me in how he con-
ducted himself was he expressed not 
egoism but altruism. He didn’t focus on 
what he should do to advance himself 
politically; he wanted to know what we 
can do to serve the best interests of 
this Nation, not grandstanding but 
problem-solving to make the United 
States of America work better for ev-
eryone. And so we proceeded. 
During the debate on Dodd-Frank, we 
had an opportunity to put forward an 
amendment to establish the Volcker 
rule. Colleagues across the aisle were 
none too happy about that, and it shut 
down the Senate for a full day. So Carl 
and I kept working during that day to 
say: No, this should be debated. This 
should be voted on. But eventually, our 
second-degree amendment died when 
the first-degree amendment was taken 
down. But our team members had 
worked through the night to make it a 
germane amendment so it would have 
survived had that not taken place. 
So then we went, in partnership, over 
to speak with Mr. Frank, Congressman 
Frank on the House side. And Con-
gressman Frank joined in the battle. 
And we kept pushing, and eventually, 
in conference, the Volcker rule was 
brought to life. 
And then we started partnering and 
trying to prevent the rulemaking from 
tearing it down. And Carl would call 
me up and say: Here is what is hap-
pening. What are we going to do? And 
we would write a letter and we would 
call the regulators and we would rally 
our fellow Senators. He just kept at it. 
Like a dog with a bone, he was not 
going to let go. He was tenacious, say-
ing: This matters. Every piece of it 
matters. We are going to get this done. 
So when we think about the fact that 
that Wall Street casino no longer 
threatens the American economy be-
cause it no longer operates as it did, 
well, we have Senator Carl Levin to 
thank for that. 
There is so much more he did here. 
Colleagues have been speaking to other 
chapters of his work, but this was the 
chapter I was involved in. I think it 
said so much about who he was. His 
policy expertise, his humble approach 
to the fight, his willingness to take on 
powerful actors, that is truly what it is 
to be a public servant. 
I wish Carl were here so we could 
have him hear these stories from us di-
rectly. I am thinking now about his 
colleagues representing Michigan who 
have followed in his footsteps. They are 
here: DEBBIE STABENOW, GARY PETERS. 
I know they are inspired by the exam-
ple he set. 
A couple of years ago, I had a chance 
to debate in Michigan and called up 
Carl so we could get together for din-
ner, together with his wife Barbara. 
And, boy, he was just interested in 
every aspect of what we were doing 
here and how we were, hopefully, mak-
ing the Senate work better. 
And just not so long ago, he wrote an 
op-ed about how to make the Senate 
work better by enabling the minority 
to slow things down, to have leverage 
but keep this body from being para-
lyzed. So he continued to think and to 
engage right up to his final days. 
So, Barbara, we are thinking about 
you. We are holding you and your fam-
ily in the light, and we are doing so 
with such appreciation of the life and 
work of Carl Levin. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I, of course, join my colleagues in their 
fond words for Carl Levin. 
He was a mentor to me, like so many. 
And I am looking forward to speaking 
about him as well as my good friend 
Senator Enzi, whom we also tragically 
lost this past week, in the coming 
days. 
But, today, I am focused on another 
topic, and that is the Olympics. 
TRIBUTE TO SUNISA LEE 
Madam President, I rise today to 
congratulate and honor Minnesota’s 
own Sunisa Lee, who won the gold 
medal in the women’s all-around gym-
nastics event at the 2020 Olympics in 
Tokyo. 
I got up, like many Minnesotans, at 5 
in the morning to watch this live, and 
it was a sight to behold. 
Suni hails from St. Paul. The young-
est member of the U.S. women’s gym-
nastics team at just 18, she has been 
competing on the national and inter-
national stages since 2015. She is now 
officially the best women’s gymnast in 
the world. 
Suni Lee’s journey is a remarkable 
one. She faced incredible challenges to 
compete on the world’s stage, including 
training through the coronavirus pan-
demic, breaking her foot, and sadly ex-
periencing tragedies within her family

July 30, 2021 
when she lost two relatives to COVID 
and when a 2019 accident left her father 
paralyzed. 
On Thursday, July 29, 2021, she led 
the American team’s quest for gold in 
the women’s all-around gymnastics 
event after the legendary Simone Biles 
withdrew. But Simone Biles stayed and 
was there for her teammate and was 
there in the stands. But with the pres-
sure of the world upon her, Suni Lee, 
who never thought she would be lead-
ing that team, who never thought that 
this honor would be hers, gave the per-
formance of her life. 
Suni’s difficult and daring uneven 
bars routine sealed her victory. The 
routine set a 6.8 difficulty mark and 
earned a score of 15.3, tied for the high-
est score by any gymnast in the com-
petition. She defended the American 
title in the women’s all-around gym-
nastics event, marking the fifth con-
secutive Olympic win for an American. 
She also contributed to the U.S. 
women’s 
gymnastics 
team’s 
silver 
medal performance in the team com-
petition. She is a teamplayer and a role 
model for young men and women 
around the Nation. 
Suni’s entire family contributed to 
her success. And for many of us who 
watched, we saw them all in that room, 
cheering her on. 
Her family, back in time, fled terror 
and violence in their native country of 
Laos to create a better life for their 
children. Her father John Lee built 
Suni a wooden balance beam in their 
backyard when she was a child because 
they could not afford to buy one. 
As she said after her championship 
performance, ‘‘We both worked for this. 
[My father] sacrificed everything to 
put me in gymnastics.’’ 
Suni Lee represented the best of 
America on the world stage. 
Minnesota, as my colleague TINA 
SMITH
will share with you soon, is 
home to more than 81,000 Hmong Amer-
icans, the largest urban concentration 
in the United States. Suni’s family, 
like many, arrived in America in the 
aftermath of the Vietnam war seeking 
a better life. 
Suni is the first Hmong American to 
make the U.S. Olympic team and the 
first to win an Olympic Gold Medal. 
She is the first Asian American to win 
the women’s all-around gymnastics 
competition. Her accomplishments rep-
resent the resiliency of her community 
and are an inspiration to Hmong Amer-
icans and all of us. They also represent 
her own personal resilience to be able 
to shine in that moment with such 
grace under pressure. Truly, she has 
captured the hearts of Minnesotans and 
people around the world. 
Suni Lee’s win is a remarkable 
achievement. I am pleased to take this 
opportunity to congratulate her; her 
coach, Jess Graba; her parents, John 
Lee and Yeev Thoj; and her entire ex-
tended family. I wish her continued 
success throughout her gymnastics ca-
reer and beyond, and we can’t wait to 
welcome her home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I am 
just delighted to be here today on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate with my col-
league Senator KLOBUCHAR to offer my 
heartfelt congratulations to Sunisa 
Lee of St. Paul, MN, who won Olympic 
Gold in the individual all-around event 
in women’s gymnastics in Tokyo this 
week. 
Suni gave a historic performance 
while under immense personal pressure 
and under the difficult circumstances 
that have defined the 2021 Olympic 
Games. But she stepped up, and she 
gave an astounding performance to 
bring home gold, continuing the Amer-
ican tradition of excellence in women’s 
gymnastics. Her routine on the uneven 
bars, as Senator KLOBUCHAR said, one 
of the most difficult ever attempted in 
women’s gymnastics, was just stun-
ning. 
On her way to Olympic Gold, Suni 
faced 
really 
tremendous 
obstacles. 
After beginning her gymnastics train-
ing at age 6, Suni showed incredible 
dedication, focus, and drive to reach 
the elite levels of her sport despite in-
juries and personal challenges. 
In 2019, her father was paralyzed in 
an accident but continued supporting 
his daughter’s gymnastics career. And 
while continuing her training during 
the coronavirus pandemic, Suni suf-
fered a broken foot, an Achilles tendon 
injury, and the tragic loss of her aunt 
and uncle to coronavirus. 
While pandemic precautions meant 
there were no spectators to cheer her 
on in Tokyo, Suni’s family, friends, 
community members, and gymnastics 
fans all over the country got together 
to cheer her on from afar with watch 
parties held in her honor. The videos of 
these gatherings show the incredible 
shared joy and pride in her incredible 
accomplishment, and I am sure that 
she could feel all that love and support 
as she competed in Tokyo. 
Not only is Suni the youngest mem-
ber of the U.S. women’s Olympic gym-
nastics team, but she is also the first 
Hmong American on the U.S. Olympic 
team and now is the first Asian Amer-
ican to be the Olympic women’s all- 
around champion. 
Her leadership and sportsmanship are 
an inspiration, and Minnesota is so 
proud to call her one of our own. In 
fact, Minnesota’s Governor, Tim Walz, 
and St. Paul’s mayor, Melvin Carter, 
have announced that today, Friday, 
July 30, 2021, is ‘‘Sunisa Lee Day.’’ It is 
too bad that Ms. KLOBUCHAR and I can’t 
be there to help them celebrate in St. 
Paul. 
I also wanted to take this oppor-
tunity to congratulate those who con-
tributed to Suni’s victory: her parents, 
John Lee and Yeev Thoj, and her 
coach, Jess Graba. After Suni won her 
gold, she reminded us all that no one 
achieves success alone as she said, 
‘‘This is my family’s medal, my medal. 
My coach’s medal.’’ 
Madam President, in this moment, I 
also would like to take an opportunity 
to acknowledge the awe-inspiring lead-
ership of Simone Biles. Her choice to 
withdraw from the all-around event in 
order to protect her health and safety 
was courageous and is an important re-
minder that mental health is an essen-
tial part of our overall well-being. 
In addition to being the greatest of 
all time, Simone’s powerful advocacy 
and her unwavering support for Suni 
and the rest of her team show that she 
is also a great team player and an ac-
tivist. 
Every Olympic medal represents un-
told hours of hard work and struggle 
and resilience, and Suni Lee’s all- 
around gold is no exception. 
So congratulations to Suni. We are 
all so proud of you. Thank you for your 
courage, your dedication, and your in-
spiration to all of us everywhere in this 
country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, with 
the Presiding Officer’s help, and the 
help of 48 others—48 others in this 
body, we provided back in March an 
amendment; and then in final passage, 
we provided the biggest tax cut—the 
largest tax cut for working families 
ever. 
It is called the Child Tax Credit. It 
has been several years in the making. 
We didn’t make so much progress the 
last 4 years, but an election and a new 
President, coupled with a new U.S. 
Senate, has made all the difference in 
the world. 
In my State, 2.4 million children are 
eligible. And 2.1 million of those—I will 
get to that in a moment; we haven’t 
reached everybody yet. But 2.1 million 
saw last week in the mail—in their 
mailbox or direct deposits in their 
bank accounts—2.1 million children 
were the beneficiary of $250 or $300 last 
week. 
So every month—July 15, coming up 
August 15, September 15, October 15, 
children from zero to 5, their parents 
will get $300 each of those months. If 
their children are 6 to 17, those fami-
lies will get $250 per child. Almost 
every child—92 percent of children in 
Ohio, roughly the same; 9 out of 10 in 
the State of Wisconsin, the Presiding 
Officer’s State, will be getting—their 
families will be getting checks in the 
mail—these checks in the mail. 
In sort of a macro big way, we know 
this does a number of things. First of 
all, it drops the poverty rate among 
America’s children by almost 50 per-
cent. Imagine that. One bill we do 
drops the poverty rate among children 
in this country by 50 percent, some-
thing government has never been able 
to do. And because of this Child Tax 
Credit, the largest tax cut for working 
families in American history, it will 
make a huge difference. 
In another macro sort of way, the 
people of Wisconsin and Ohio and other

States will benefit because we are in-
jecting this kind of money. In Ohio last 
week, $550 million was sent to the 
State from the Federal Government to 
these children, to these families. And 
for most of these families—the wealthi-
est people don’t get this—it is 90 per-
cent; 9 out of 10 families do, but they 
have children. 
This money goes directly into these 
communities. They are going to be 
spending this money at the local gro-
cery store, the local hardware store, to 
fix their car so they don’t miss work, 
and maybe take their kid once in a 
while to a restaurant. So the money is 
not going to be put in a Swiss bank ac-
count. It will be spent in local commu-
nities, making a difference. That is 
sort of the big picture. 
The joy of working on this bill and 
starting—I started working on this in 
2013, joined by MICHAEL BENNET and 
Senator BOOKER, and then, since he 
came, Senator WARNOCK and Senator 
BALDWIN and Senator OSSOFF have been 
helpful and Senator WYDEN, the chair 
of the Finance Committee. The joy of 
this is to see how this affects indi-
vidual families’ lives. 
So a couple of weeks ago, before the 
checks were sent out, I did a series of 
roundtables in Defiance, in Findlay, in 
Ryan, in Cleveland, in Dayton, in To-
ledo, in—where else?—in Youngstown, 
and in Cincinnati, and I just asked 
families: What are you going to do with 
this money? Many families didn’t know 
it was even coming; the word wasn’t 
out yet. I just heard some interesting 
comments. But then after the checks 
were sent out, I also heard stories, and 
here is what this means to families: 
One mother said: You know, for the 
first time, I can now send my son to 
camp for a week, to a summer camp— 
for the first time in her life. 
A father said: You know, I am now 
going to be able to buy for my daugh-
ter—she loves fastpitch softball. She is 
really good. I am going to be able to 
buy her the equipment to do that. 
A number of families said: We are 
now in a position where we can actu-
ally, 
without 
scrounging—so 
many 
American families can barely afford 
their rent. Twenty-five percent of 
American families pay half their in-
come in rent. Think about that. One 
out of four renters pays half their in-
come in rent. One thing goes wrong in 
their lives—their car breaks down— 
they can end up being evicted. 
So what this $300 per child or $250 per 
child—for a lot of families, it just re-
lieved the anxiety of the difficulty of 
putting together the money they need 
to pay their rent, because the last 
week of a month for many families is 
different from the first three because, 
the last week, they start making cuts 
and not spending as much money on 
food, all the things they have got to do 
to pay their rent. Look, this is going to 
alleviate—it is going to lift that bur-
den off so many families. 
Other families who are a little more 
affluent but still, you know, hanging 
on to being middle class are now able, 
they told me, to put $100 aside every 
month. Because of this child tax credit, 
because of the largest tax cut for work-
ing families ever, they are going to be 
able to put aside $100 a month for their 
child to go to Ohio State or to Denison 
or to Cleveland State or to Sinclair 
Community College in Ohio. 
So all the kinds of things—and you 
know, Madam President, I know you 
have, in Wisconsin, have thought about 
this. The best thing about this is, you 
know, it is not Senator BALDWIN or 
Senator SCHUMER or Senator MCCON-
NELL
or President Biden—it is not 
them saying to a family: OK. Here is 
some money. Here is where you are 
going to spend it. We are going to help 
you with this. We are going to help 
you. It is trusting these families. This 
$250 a month or $300 a month these 
families get, they get this money, and 
they decide what is best for their fam-
ily. 
It is still, frankly, Madam President, 
inexplicable to me that everybody on 
this side of the aisle voted no, every 
single one of them. They had two 
chances. They voted no on an amend-
ment on the bill, and then they voted 
no on the bill to give the largest tax 
cut for working families ever. 
We all know around here—it is no se-
cret—that this side of the aisle likes 
tax cuts; they just like them for rich 
people. But they always argue: You 
know, if we cut taxes on the rich, it 
will trickle down; it will help every-
body. Well, there is kind of no evidence 
for that, but they keep doing it because 
they know that it plays really well 
with their rich contributors. 
But this is what tax cuts are really 
about. The child tax credit puts money 
in people’s pockets, it gives them the 
choice on how to spend those dollars on 
behalf of their families, and it helps 
the community because there is more 
money in the community. We know 
that, and we know that the best kind of 
infrastructure, the best way to build 
infrastructure in this country is to 
build a foundation for families. 
I am for this bill that we are consid-
ering now: water, sewer, highways, 
bridges. I want to do that, but I want 
to build a foundation for families, too, 
not just the physical—a better highway 
system, a better water and sewer sys-
tem—but I want to give families 
broadband. I want to give families a 
little bit of money like this does. I 
want to build and help families with 
housing because then that foundation— 
these families can launch their chil-
dren into a more prosperous future, 
and that is, to me, what this is all 
about. That is why the child tax credit 
is the most important thing I have ever 
worked on in my career, and I think it 
is one of the most important things 
Congress has done in a quarter cen-
tury. 
I yield the floor.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I close the Senate, I want to in-
form the Senators where we are today. 
First, I want to thank all of the Sen-
ators who voted to proceed today. The 
bipartisan group is still finalizing the 
text of their agreement, which will be 
the substitute amendment, with a non-
partisan legislative counsel. 
Once they are finished—this is a big 
job—the text will be reviewed, and then 
I will immediately offer the text of the 
bipartisan infrastructure agreement as 
the substitute amendment, making it 
the base bill, as I have promised. As 
soon as the bipartisan group finalizes 
the text of the substitute amendment 
and it becomes the base bill, we can 
start voting on amendments and make 
further progress on the bill over this 
weekend. 
The Senate will resume session to-
morrow at 11 a.m. 
This is a really important bill, and I 
know all the parties want to make sure 
it is done right.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session and 
be in a morning of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each.

objection, it is so ordered.

AFGHAN SPECIAL IMMIGRANT 
VISAS 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, 
nearly 20 years ago, the United States 
invaded Afghanistan to prevent that 
country from being exploited as a plat-
form for terrorism and extremism. In 
doing so, the U.S. worked side-by-side 
with international and Afghan forces 
to remove the Taliban from power, fa-
cilitate democratic elections, build 
democratic institutions, and promote 
human rights throughout Afghanistan. 
Because of these efforts and the com-
mitment and dedication of the Afghan 
people, the Afghanistan of 2021 is far 
different than the Afghanistan of 2001. 
And now that Afghanistan has made 
this progress, we must work with our 
Afghan partners to do everything in 
our power to preserve these gains and 
leave a stable country behind us. It is 
both a moral obligation and a national 
security priority that we do so. 
As U.S. troops withdraw from Af-
ghanistan, the safety and security of 
our Afghan allies who put their lives 
on the line to help our servicemembers 
and diplomats must be a top priority. 
This is about fulfilling a sacred prom-
ise that we made to those who served 
the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan. It 
is a service that many Afghans have al-
ready paid for with their lives. Like 
U.S. personnel, our Afghan partners

died on the battlefield alongside Amer-
icans. But unlike our own servicemem-
bers, when the Afghans went home, 
they were not safe from danger. 
Earlier this year, National Public 
Radio shared the story of ‘‘Moham-
mad’’ and his family. ‘‘Mohammad’’ is 
not his name, but a pseudonym used 
because of the threats made upon him 
and his family by the Taliban. Moham-
mad was an interpreter who served his 
country and the U.S.-led mission in Af-
ghanistan. 
For 
this, 
the 
Taliban 
threatened him and his family. They 
labeled him a traitor and forced him to 
seek safety in the United States 
through the Afghan Special Immigrant 
Visa program. Mohammad was mur-
dered by the Taliban in January, short-
ly after his visa to the U.S. was ap-
proved—10 years after he applied. Last 
month, his family finally arrived in the 
United States—to safety—but they did 
so without Mohammad. His wife and 
six children are here without their fa-
ther, who gave his life in service to his 
country and the U.S. mission. 
Unfortunately, Mohammad’s story is 
not unique. The Taliban has made their 
intentions clear. They call in the dead 
of the night and leave notes affixed to 
houses: ‘‘We know who you are and will 
kill you.’’ 
The Taliban’s brutality against vul-
nerable populations like our Afghan al-
lies has increased over the last several 
months, but as the U.S. withdrawal 
nears completion, conditions on the 
ground have become all the more dan-
gerous. If the United States does not 
act quickly to uphold its promise to 
these Afghans, our opportunity to get 
our partners to safety will pass us by. 
U.S. action must start with bolstering 
the program that was supposed to pro-
tect Mohammad, the Afghan Special 
Immigrant Visa—SIV—program, and 
include a secure and efficient evacu-
ation of our partners by the Biden ad-
ministration. 
There has long been bipartisan sup-
port for the Afghan SIV program in 
Congress, which I originally cham-
pioned with the late Senator John 
McCain. John personally understood 
the need to fulfill our moral obliga-
tions to our partners and the strategic 
value in taking care of our allies. His 
example of bipartisan leadership con-
tinues today, and it has served the SIV 
program well: There is bipartisan, bi-
cameral determination to take action. 
That is why Senators ERNST, DURBIN, 
WICKER, and I introduced the Afghan 
Allies Protection Act of 2021 and why I 
am pleased that Congress has taken de-
cisive action to pass this language with 
the supplemental budget appropria-
tions bill. President Biden signed the 
bill into law today. These actions pro-
vide additional visas and make ur-
gently needed process fixes to the pro-
gram, which maintains broad bipar-
tisan support across the political spec-
trum. This is necessary to help the 
U.S. fulfill its obligation to our Afghan 
partners, not only because it is the 
right thing to do, but also because of 
what it means for U.S. credibility in 
future engagements. We must send a 
strong message to our current and fu-
ture allies: If you stand by our side on 
the battlefield, we will have your back. 
However, these improvements to the 
process are just the first step in ensur-
ing our Afghan allies do not suffer for 
their service. The Biden administration 
must now take immediate steps to im-
plement this legislation and provide 
for the safety of Afghan SIV appli-
cants. Congress has demonstrated that 
there is bipartisan support for imme-
diate action to protect and support our 
Afghan SIV applicants and friends. Our 
allies around the world are watching. 
There is no easy answer on Afghani-
stan. But one thing is clear: We cannot 
leave our Afghan allies behind. With 
this legislation now law, we must con-
centrate all U.S. efforts on supporting 
and protecting those who worked with 
the U.S. Government, as well as those 
whose work is diametrically opposed to 
the views of the Taliban, such as wom-
en’s equality advocates. To not do so is 
to make a grave moral and security 
mistake. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with the administration and my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle in 
support of our friends in Afghanistan.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Thailand—Javelin Missiles 
The Government of Thailand has requested 
to buy three hundred (300) Javelin FGM–148 
Missiles; and fifty (50) Javelin Command 
Launch Units (CLU). Also included are En-
hanced Producibility Basic Skills Trainers; 
missile simulation rounds; Security Assist-
ance Management Directorate (SAMD) Tech-
nical Assistance; Tactical Aviation and 
Ground Munitions (TAGM) Project Office 
Technical Assistance; contractor lifecycle 
support; spares manuals; batteries/chargers; 
gunner training; ammunition officer train-
ing; OCONUS Modified Level 2 Maintenance 
Training; System Inspection and Check Out 
(SICO); 
and 
other 
related 
elements 
of 
logistical and program support. The total es-
timated cost is $83.5 million. 
This proposed sale will contribute to the 
foreign policy and national security objec-
tives of the United States by improving the 
security of a Major Non-NATO Ally in 
Southeast Asia. The Javelin Weapon System 
will replace the obsolete 106mm Recoilless 
Rifles that the Royal Thai Army (RTA) ac-
quired as part of the Military Assistance 
Program (MAP) from the Vietnam era. This 
proposed sale will allow the RTA to mod-
ernize their light anti-tank capability and 
maintain its current force posture, as well as 
enhance interoperability with the U.S. dur-
ing operations and training exercises. Thai-
land is a strategic partner committed to con-
tributing to regional security. 
The proposed sale will improve Thailand’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by improving Thailand’s long-term 
defense capacity to defend its sovereignty 
and territorial integrity. Thailand will have 
no difficulty absorbing this equipment into 
its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.

Orlando, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona. Off-
sets have not been included. Any offset 
agreements will be defined in negotiations 
between the purchaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–53 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, 
man 
portable, 
shoulder- 
launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system 
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. 
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms 
including 
vehicles, 
aircraft 
and 
watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds 
and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 
meters. The system is highly lethal against 
tanks and other systems with conventional 
and reactive armors. The system possesses a 
secondary capability against bunkers. 
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use 
of fire-and-forget technology, which allows 
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate 
or take cover. Additional special features are 
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an 
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch, 
and soft launch from enclosures or covered 
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also 
has a minimum smoke motor, thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield. 
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components, 
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit 
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable 
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates 
an integrated day-night sight that provides a 
target engagement capability in adverse 
weather and countermeasure environments. 
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone 
mode for battlefield surveillance and target 
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-
ond generation Forward Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial loading 
and subsequent updating of software, all on- 
board missile software is uploaded via the 
CLU after mating and prior to launch. 
4. The missile is autonomously guided to 
the target using an imaging infrared seeker 
and adaptive correlation tracking algo-
rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover 
or reload and engage another target after fir-
ing a missile. The missile has an advanced 
tandem warhead and can be used in either 
the top attack or direct fire modes (for tar-
get undercover). An onboard flight computer 
guides the missile to the selected target. 
5. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
6. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware or software elements, the informa-
tion could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
7. A determination has been made that 
Thailand can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
8. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Thailand.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Israel—CH–53K Heavy Lift Helicopters with 
Support 
The Government of Israel has requested to 
buy up to eighteen (18) CH–53K Heavy Lift 
Helicopters; up to sixty (60) T408–GE–400 En-
gines (54 installed, 6 spares); and up to thir-
ty-six (36) Embedded Global Positioning Sys-
tem/Inertial Navigation Systems (EGI) with 
Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module

GAU–21 
.50 
caliber 
Machine 
Guns; Mission Planning System; facilities 
study, design and construction; spare and re-
pair parts; support and test equipment; pub-
lications and technical documentation; air-
crew and maintenance training; U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor engineering, technical, 
and logistics support services; and other re-
lated elements of logistics and program sup-
port. The total estimated cost is $3.4 billion. 
The United States is committed to the se-
curity of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. na-
tional interests to assist Israel to develop 
and maintain a strong and ready self-defense 
capability. This proposed sale is consistent 
with those objectives. 
The proposed sale will improve the Israeli 
Air Force’s capability to transport armored 
vehicles, personnel, and equipment to sup-
port distributed operations deep inland from 
a sea-based center of operations. Israel will 
use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to 
regional threats and to strengthen its home-
land defense. Israel will have no difficulty 
absorbing this equipment into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractors will be Lockheed 
Martin Global, Inc., Shelton, Connecticut; 
and General Electric Company, Lynn, Massa-
chusetts. There are no known offset agree-
ments proposed in connection with this po-
tential sale. Any offset agreements will be 
defined in negotiations between the pur-
chaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require multiple trips by U.S. Government 
and contractor representatives to participate 
in program and technical reviews. It will 
also require approximately four (4) con-
tractor support representatives to reside in 
country for a period of three (3) years to sup-
port this program. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

carries several sensors and data links to en-
hance its ability to operate in hostile envi-
ronments and in coordination with group 
forces. The aircraft is night vision compat-
ible. The sensitive technologies include: 
a. Communications security devices con-
tain sensitive encryption algorithms and 
keying material. The purchasing country has 
previously 
been 
released 
and 
utilizes 
COMSEC devices in accordance with set pro-
cedures and without issue. 
b. Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) (KIV– 
78) contains embedded security devices con-
taining sensitive encryption algorithms and 
keying material. The purchasing country 
will utilize COMSEC devices in accordance 
with set procedures. 
c. GPS PPS/SAASM/MGUE/ADAP—Global 
Positioning System (GPS) Precise Posi-
tioning Service (PPS) provides space-based 
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) 
signals that have reliable location and time 
information in all weather, at all times, and 
anywhere on or near the earth when and 
where there is an unobstructed line of sight 
to four or more GPS satellites. The Selective 
Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 
and 
Modernized 
GPS 
User 
Equipment 
(MGUE) are used as military embedded GPS 
receivers (EGRs) to provide for decryption 
and use of the GPS PPS by the Embedded 
GPS/Inertial Navigation System (EGI). In 
addition, the Advanced Digital Antenna Pro-
duction (ADAP) GPS anti-jam protection 
system provides electronic protection from 
enemy countermeasures to disrupt and jam 
GPS signals. The combination of the EGI 
and the ADAP provide for robust posi-
tioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capa-
bility. 
2. All the mission data, including sensitive 
parameters, is loaded from an off board sta-
tion before each flight and does not stay 
with the aircraft after electrical power has 
been removed. Sensitive technologies are 
protected as defined in the program protec-
tion and anti-tamper plans. 
3. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware or software elements, the informa-
tion could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
5. A determination has been made that 
Israel can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
6. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Israel.

SKILLED
NURSING
FACILI-
TIES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, the Secretary shall certify a skilled

in a time and manner specified by the Sec-
retary and meets the following require-
ments: 
‘‘(i) The facility has on-site diagnostic 
equipment necessary for a qualified group 
practice to furnish items and services under 
the Program and real-time audio and visual

‘‘(ii) The facility has at least one indi-
vidual who meets the qualifications de-
scribed in subsection (b)(4) or a physician 
present 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to 
work with the qualified group practice, in 
accordance with section 483.35(a) of title 42, 
Code of Federal Regulations (or any suc-
cessor regulation). Such individual may be a 
member of the staff of the qualified skilled 
nursing facility or of the qualified group 
practice. 
‘‘(iii) The facility ensures that residents of 
such facility, upon entering such facility, are 
allowed to specify in an advanced care direc-
tive or otherwise documented in the individ-
ual’s records whether the resident wishes to 
receive items and services furnished at the 
facility under the Program in a case where 
communication with the resident is not pos-
sible.

to be furnished such items and services 
under the Program at such facility have the 
opportunity, at their request, to instead be

‘‘(v) The facility is not part of the Special 
Focus Facility program of the Centers for

facility may, at the discretion of the Sec-
retary, be a candidate for selection under 
such program). 
‘‘(B) REQUIRED PROVISION OF SERVICES AND 
ACTIVITIES.—Nothing in this paragraph shall 
affect the application of requirements under 
section 1819(b)(4), relating to provision of 
services and activities, to a facility. 
‘‘(2) QUALIFIED GROUP PRACTICES.—For pur-
poses of this section, the Secretary shall cer-
tify a group practice as a qualified group 
practice for a period of 3 years if the group 
practice submits an application in a time 
and manner specified by the Secretary and 
meets the following requirements: 
‘‘(A) The group practice offers to furnish 
all minimum required items and services 
identified under subsection (b)(3) under the 
Program. 
‘‘(B) The group practice submits a notifica-
tion to the Secretary annually specifying 
which (if any) additional items and services 
identified under subsection (b)(3) for a year 
the group practice will offer to furnish for 
such year under the Program. 
‘‘(C) The group practice ensures that only 
individuals who meet the qualifications es-
tablished under subsection (b)(4) or a physi-
cian who is part of such group practice may 
furnish such minimum required items and 
services and such additional items and serv-
ices. 
‘‘(D) The group practice, as provided by the 
agreement between the facility and the 
group practice or under the supervision of 
the medical director of the facility, ensures 
that, in the case where such minimum re-
quired items and services or such additional 
items and services are furnished by such an 
individual, such individual furnishes such 
minimum required items and services or ad-
ditional items and services under the super-
vision, either in-person or through the use of 
telehealth (not including store-and-forward 
technologies), of— 
‘‘(i) a physician— 
‘‘(I) who is board certified or board eligible

tified by a nationally recognized specialty 
board of certification or equivalent certifi-
cation board in basic life support; or 
‘‘(iii) a physician assistant who has been 
certified by a nationally recognized specialty 
board of certification or equivalent certifi-
cation board in basic life support. 
‘‘(E) With respect to any year in which the 
qualified group practice would participate in 
the Program, the Chief Actuary for the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services deter-
mines that such participation during such 
year will not result in total estimated ex-
penditures under this title for such year 
being greater than total estimated expendi-
tures under such title for such year without 
such participation. 
‘‘(d) PAYMENTS
AND TREATMENT
OF SAV-
INGS.— 
‘‘(1) PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For 2022 and each subse-
quent year, payments shall continue to be 
made to qualified group practices and quali-
fied skilled nursing facilities participating in 
the Program under the original Medicare 
fee-for-service program under parts A and B 
in the same manner as they would otherwise 
be made except that such group practices 
and skilled nursing facilities are eligible to 
receive payment for shared savings under 
paragraph (2) if they meet the requirement 
under subparagraph (B)(i). 
‘‘(B) SAVINGS
REQUIREMENT
AND
BENCH-
MARK.— 
‘‘(i) DETERMINING SAVINGS.—In each year of 
the Program, a qualified group practice (and 
any qualified skilled nursing facility partici-
pating in the Program that has an agree-
ment with the group practice for the fur-
nishing of items and services identified 
under subsection (b)(3) to residents of the fa-
cility) shall be eligible to receive payment 
for shared savings under paragraph (2) only if 
the estimated average per capita Medicare 
expenditures for Medicare fee-for-service 
beneficiaries for parts A and B services fur-
nished under the Program by the group prac-
tice (and any such facility), adjusted for ben-
eficiary characteristics, is at least the per-
cent specified by the Secretary below the ap-
plicable benchmark under clause (ii). The 
Secretary shall determine the appropriate 
percent described in the preceding sentence 
to account for normal variation in expendi-
tures under this title, based upon the num-
ber of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 
participating in the Program. 
‘‘(ii) ESTABLISH AND UPDATE BENCHMARK.— 
For each qualified group practice (and any 
qualified skilled nursing facility partici-
pating in the Program that has an agree-
ment with the group practice for the fur-
nishing of items and services identified 
under subsection (b)(3) to residents of the fa-
cility) the Secretary shall estimate a single 
benchmark for each year that is applicable 
to both the group practice (and any such fa-
cility) using the most recent available 3 
years of per-beneficiary expenditures for 
parts A and B services for Medicare fee-for- 
service beneficiaries for items and services 
furnished by such group practice or skilled 
nursing facility under the Program. Such 
benchmark shall be adjusted for beneficiary 
characteristics and such other factors as the 
Secretary 
determines 
appropriate. 
Such 
benchmark shall be reset at the start of each 
year. 
‘‘(2) PAYMENTS FOR SHARED SAVINGS.—If a 
qualified group practice (and any qualified 
skilled nursing facility participating in the 
Program that has an agreement with the 
group practice for the furnishing of items 
and services identified under subsection 
(b)(3) to residents of the facility) meets the 
requirements under paragraph (1), the Sec-
retary shall— 
‘‘(A) pay to such qualified group practice 
an amount equal to 37.5 percent of the dif-
ference between such estimated average per 
capita Medicare expenditures in a year, ad-
justed for beneficiary characteristics, for 
items and services furnished under the Pro-
gram by the group practice (and any such fa-
cility) and such benchmark for the qualified 
group practice (and any such facility); and 
‘‘(B) in the case of each such facility— 
‘‘(i) if the qualified skilled nursing facility 
has at least a three-star rating under the 
Five Star Quality Rating System (or a suc-
cessor system), pay to the facility an 
amount that bears the same ratio to 12.5 per-
cent of the estimated amount of such dif-
ference as the amount of expenditures under 
the Program for such items and services fur-
nished with respect to individuals at such fa-
cility by such qualified group practice dur-
ing such year bears to the total amount of

items and services furnished with respect to 
all individuals by such qualified group prac-
tice during such year; and 
‘‘(ii) in the case of a qualified skilled nurs-
ing facility that is not described in clause 
(i), retain in the Federal Hospital Insurance 
Trust Fund under section 1817 the amount 
that the facility would have been paid pursu-
ant to clause (i) if the facility were described 
in such clause until such time as the facility 
has at least a three-star rating under the 
Five Star Quality Rating System (or a suc-
cessor system), at which point the Secretary 
shall pay such amount to the facility. 
‘‘(3) ADVANCED ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MOD-
ELS.—Paragraph (2) shall not apply to items 
and services furnished to an individual enti-
tled to benefits under part A and enrolled 
under Part B for whom shared savings would 
otherwise be attributed through an advanced 
alternative payment model as authorized 
under section 1115A or section 1899. 
‘‘(e) EVALUATION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—With respect to a quali-
fied group practice and a qualified skilled 
nursing facility, not later than 6 months 
after such group practice begins furnishing 
items and services under the Program (or, in 
the case of a qualified skilled nursing facil-
ity, not less than 6 months after a qualified 
group practice first furnishes such items and 
services at such facility), and not less than 
once every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary 
shall evaluate such qualified group practice 
and such qualified facility using information 
received under paragraph (2) on such criteria 
as determined appropriate by the Secretary. 
‘‘(2) REPORTING OF PERFORMANCE AND QUAL-
ITY IMPROVEMENTS.—In a time and manner 
specified by the Secretary, a qualified group 
practice and a qualified skilled nursing facil-
ity shall submit to the Secretary a report 
containing the following information with 
respect to items and services furnished under 
the Program during a reporting period (as 
specified by the Secretary): 
‘‘(A) The items and services most fre-
quently furnished under the Program in such 
period. 
‘‘(B) The number of individuals with re-
spect to whom such group practice furnished 
such items and services in such period (or, in 
the case of a qualified skilled nursing facil-
ity, the number of individuals with respect 
to whom such a group practice furnished 
such items and services at such facility in 
such period). 
‘‘(C) The number of hospitalizations pre-
vented under the Program in such period. 
‘‘(D) The number of such individuals who 
were admitted to a hospital or treated in the 
emergency department of a hospital within 
24 hours of being furnished such items and 
services. 
‘‘(E) Other information determined appro-
priate by the Secretary. 
‘‘(3) LOSS OF QUALIFIED CERTIFICATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 3 months 
after a determination described in this sen-
tence is made, the Secretary may revoke the 
certification of a qualified skilled nursing fa-
cility or a qualified group practice made 
under subsection (c) if— 
‘‘(i) the Chief Actuary of the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services determines 
that the participation of such skilled nursing 
facility or such group practice in the Pro-
gram during a year resulted in total expendi-
tures under this title for such period being 
greater than total expenditures under such 
title would have been during such period 
without such participation; or 
‘‘(ii) a facility is selected for the Special 
Focus Facility program or, if the facility is 
a candidate for the Special Focus Facility 
program, the Secretary determines that the 
participation of such facility in the Program 
should be terminated. 
‘‘(B) EXCLUSION FROM CERTIFICATION.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case that the Sec-
retary revokes the certification of a quali-
fied skilled nursing facility or a qualified 
group practice under subparagraph (A), such 
skilled nursing facility or such group prac-
tice shall be ineligible for certification as a 
qualified skilled nursing facility or a quali-
fied group practice (as applicable) under sub-
section (c) for the applicable period (as de-
fined under clause (ii)). 
‘‘(ii) APPLICABLE PERIOD DEFINED.—In this 
subparagraph, the term ‘applicable period’ 
means— 
‘‘(I) if the revocation of a facility or group 
practice under subparagraph (A) is due to the 
application of clause (i) of such subpara-
graph, a 1-year period beginning on the date 
of such revocation; and 
‘‘(II) in the revocation of a facility under 
subparagraph (A) is due to the application of 
clause (ii) of such subparagraph, the period 
beginning on the date of such revocation and 
ending on the date on which the facility 
graduates from the Special Focus Facility 
program (or, in the case of a facility that is 
a candidate for such program, the date on 
which the facility is no longer such a can-
didate, as determined by the Secretary). 
‘‘(f) 
DETERMINATION
OF
BUDGET
NEU-
TRALITY; TERMINATION OF PROGRAM.— 
‘‘(1) DETERMINATION.—Not later than July 
1, 2027, the Chief Actuary of the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services shall deter-
mine whether the Program has resulted in 
an increase in total expenditures under this 
title with respect to the period beginning on 
January 1, 2022, and ending on December 31, 
2026, compared to what such expenditures 
would have been during such period had the 
Program not been in operation. 
‘‘(2) TERMINATION.—If the Chief Actuary 
makes a determination under paragraph (1) 
that the Program has resulted in an increase 
in total expenditures under this title, the

Mr. OSSOFF (for himself and Mr. 
WARNOCK) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 332 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘CDC’’), based in Atlanta, Georgia, 
was established by the United States Gov-
ernment on July 1, 1946, initially to prevent 
the spread of malaria in the United States, 
and soon became the premier public health 
agency of the United States; 
Whereas because medical epidemiologists 
were scarce in the United States prior to the 
establishment of the CDC, disease surveil-
lance became the cornerstone of the mission 
of service of the CDC to the States; 
Whereas, since 1946, the scientists, disease 
detectives, career civil servants, and support 
staff of the CDC have worked every day to 
combat diseases like malaria, yellow fever, 
smallpox, polio, influenza, and Ebola; 
Whereas the Epidemic Intelligence Service 
of the CDC has trained disease detectives at 
home and abroad, producing some of the top 
epidemiologists in the world; 
Whereas the CDC has played a vital role in 
implementing high-profile and innovative 
programs, including the President’s Malaria 
Initiative, the President’s Emergency Plan 
for AIDS Relief, and the Global Health Secu-
rity Agenda, helping save millions of human 
lives; 
Whereas the staff of the CDC were instru-
mental in global efforts to effectively eradi-
cate smallpox in 1980 and are currently 
working to eliminate polio worldwide; 
Whereas the CDC has spent decades build-
ing public health infrastructure and capacity 
around the world to detect, respond to, and 
contain outbreaks of deadly diseases like 
Zika and Ebola; 
Whereas the CDC assisted with disaster re-
lief in Haiti, partnering with the Haitian 
public health ministry to respond to the 
cholera outbreak after the devastating 2010 
earthquake; 
Whereas the CDC has an established record 
of working to improve access to cancer 
screenings and treatment, prevent child mal-
nutrition, protect workers, reduce develop-
mental disabilities and birth defects, prevent 
injuries, and protect the public from dan-
gerous environmental exposures; 
Whereas the National Asthma Control Pro-
gram of the CDC funds programs for States, 
schools, and nongovernmental organizations 
to help train professionals and educate peo-
ple living with asthma and their families; 
Whereas the CDC has worked to end the 
opioid overdose crisis by funding efforts to 
improve data collection about opioid use and 
implement evidence-based strategies to save 
lives; 
Whereas a core principle of public health is 
that every person should be able to reach his 
or her full health potential, and the CDC 
seeks to remove barriers to health linked to 
race or ethnicity, education, income, loca-
tion, or other social factors, including vital 
work to improve health equity; 
Whereas the CDC employs more than 23,000 
employees around the world, supporting the 
agency’s 24/7 mission of saving lives and pro-
tecting people from health threats; 
Whereas political leaders of the United 
States should support and empower the pub-
lic health experts at the CDC and other lead-
ing national health agencies to guide with 
science during public health crises; and 
Whereas the strength and efficacy of the 
public health system of the United States 
and the response of the United States to the 
COVID–19 pandemic depends upon the leader-
ship, expertise, and professionalism of the 
CDC staff who continue working tirelessly to 
fight COVID–19 and provide science-based 
guidance to protect families and save lives in 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(referred to in this resolution as the ‘‘CDC’’);

(2) declares its deep gratitude on behalf of 
the people of the United States to the sci-
entists, disease detectives, career civil serv-
ants, and support staff at the CDC for their 
dedication to fighting diseases and working 
every day to combat the COVID–19 pan-

(3) urges Federal agencies, State and local

to study and incorporate the evidence-based 
public health guidance and recommendations 
provided by the CDC; 
(4) expresses its confidence in the scientific 
method, evidence-based policymaking, and 
the medical and public health professions,

assembly, and association that continue to 
this day under the Communist rule of Rau´ l 
Castro and his successor, Miguel Dı´az-Canel;

(3) the Communist Party of Cuba has al-
ways viewed that commitment to democracy 
and freedom as a threat to the existence of 
the Communist Party of Cuba; 
(4) on July 22, 2012, a violent car crash, 
widely believed to have been carried out by 
the Castro regime, took the lives of Oswaldo 
Paya´ and Harold Cepero, another dissident; 
(5) the official investigation into the crash 
has been demonstrated to be compromised, 
and the Castro regime has offered no plau-
sible evidence of the innocence of the Castro 
regime 
in 
the 
crash, 
leaving 
the 
cir-
cumstances of the death of Oswaldo Paya´ un-
known; 
(6) opposition by Oswaldo Paya´
to the 
Communist Party of Cuba began at a young 
age, when he refused to become a member of 
the Young Communist League as a primary 
school student, and continued through high 
school, when he publicly criticized the inva-
sion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union; 
(7) the Communist Party of Cuba re-
sponded to the opposition by Oswaldo Paya´ 
to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the So-
viet Union by sending Oswaldo Paya´
to a 
labor camp for 3 years; 
(8) Oswaldo Paya´ forewent a chance to es-
cape Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, decid-
ing instead to continue the fight for democ-
racy in Cuba, saying, ‘‘This is what I am sup-
posed to be, this is what I have to do.’’; 
(9) by creating the Varela Project in 1998, 
Oswaldo Paya´
demonstrated his staunch 
commitment to peacefully advocating for 
freedom of speech and freedom of assembly 
for his fellow Cubans; 
(10) in recognition of his determination for 
political reforms through peaceful protests, 
Oswaldo Paya´
was awarded the Sakharov 
Prize for Freedom of Thought by the Euro-
pean Parliament in 2002 and the W. Averell 
Harriman Democracy Award from the Na-
tional 
Democratic 
Institute 
for 
Inter-
national Affairs in 2003 and was nominated 
for the Nobel Peace Prize by former Czech 
President Va´clav Havel in 2005; 
(11) on April 11, 2018, the Senate unani-
mously passed S. Res. 224, recognizing the 
sixth anniversary of the death of Oswaldo 
Paya´
Sardin˜ as, commemorating his legacy 
and commitment to democratic values and 
principles, and calling on the Cuban govern-
ment to allow an impartial, third-party in-
vestigation into the circumstances sur-
rounding his death; and 
(12) renaming the street in front of the Em-
bassy of Cuba in the District of Columbia 
after Oswaldo Paya´ serves as an expression 
of solidarity between the people of the 
United States and the people of the Cuba, 
who are engaged in a long, nonviolent strug-
gle for fundamental human rights. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF OSWALDO PAYA´ WAY. 
(a) DESIGNATION OF WAY.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The area between the 
intersections of 16th Street, Northwest and

IN RECOGNITION OF COREY WELCH 
ON 
HIS 
INDUCTION 
INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS HALL 
OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete and North-
eastern Pennsylvania native Corey Welch. 
Corey will be inducted into the Luzerne Coun-
ty Sports Hall of Fame in 2021 for his distinct 
athletic achievements in the sports of swim-
ming and water polo. He and his fellow induct-
ees will be honored at a reception on August 
8, 2021. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania 
through 
their 
outstanding 
achievements and contributions in athletic en-
deavors. 
Corey started competitively swimming when 
he was five years old. Five more years later, 
he won his first age group PA State Cham-
pionship for the Wilkes-Barre YMCA in the 50 
meter backstroke. Corey continued to succeed 
in the pool, winning the 100 IM as well as the 
50 backstroke, setting a state and national 
record. He was ranked as the number one 14- 
year-old in the country in the 200 IM and the 
100 backstroke. 
Corey also began playing water polo, and in 
1996, he was selected to attend the USA 
Water Polo Youth Development Camp at the 
USA Olympic Training Center. Corey had a 
very successful high school athletic career at 
Wyoming Valley West, and, as a freshman on 
the water polo team, he was voted the best 
freshman player in the state. He went on to be 
All-State the following three years and All- 
American in his junior and senior seasons. He 
helped lead the team to four consecutive divi-
sion championships. On the swim team, Corey 
was undefeated in his individual events at the 
AAA district championships, and he helped the 
team win the PIAA District 2 and Wyoming 
Valley Conference Team titles during each of 
his four years. 
After graduating from Wyoming Valley West, 
Corey continued his swimming career on a Di-
vision I scholarship at the University of Florida. 
He qualified for the USA Swimming National 
Championships each of his four years as a 
Gator, and, in 2004, he qualified for his first 
Olympic Trials in the 200 LCM breaststroke. 
Corey qualified for finals in several Nationals, 
as well as the 2004 US Open where he won 
the title as part of the 400 medley relay along 
with the overall team title. For his efforts, he 
was named to the Gators’ All Time Top Ten 
list in the 100 breast, 200 breast, 200 medley 
relay, and 400 medley relay. In 2005, he won 
the SEC Championship with a conference and 
team record, and he earned Division I NCAA 
All-American status when the team finished 
fifth at the NCAA Championships. His impres-
sive times also earned him a spot at the 2008 
Olympic Team Trials. 
After graduation, Corey pursued his doc-
torate in physical therapy at Drexel University. 
While in Philadelphia, he began coaching a 
USA Masters swim team, and he continued to 
compete himself in several Masters meets. In 
2010, he was the USMS National Champion in 
both the 100 and 200 LCM. In early summer 
2012, Corey swam a lifetime best in the 100 
LCM breaststroke to earn a spot at the 2012 
Olympic Team Trials. 
It is an honor to recognize Corey on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

IN RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT 
MIKE CASSIDY 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the life and service of Ser-
geant Michael Cassidy, a 27-year veteran of 
the New Bedford Police Department. 
Sergeant Cassidy grew up in New Bedford 
and attended Old Colony Regional Vocational 
Technical High School. After graduation, he 
began his life of service by enlisting in the U.S 
Marine Corps, serving in Operation Desert 
Storm. 
Sergeant Cassidy returned to New Bedford 
and joined the City’s Police Department in 
1994. He was honored with numerous com-
mendations throughout his decades of service, 
including the New Bedford Life Saving Award 
in 2006. He was honored again with the award 
in 2018 when he helped revive and save the 
life of a cashier who collapsed while Sgt. Cas-
sidy was off-duty and grocery shopping. This 
is just one example of Sergeant Cassidy going 
beyond his everyday responsibilities for his 
community. 
Sergeant Cassidy was a dedicated family 
man and Boston sports fan. Besides being a 
firearms and CPR instructor, he also taught 
Kenpo Karate for years and was a 5th degree 
black belt. 
Sergeant Cassidy left his family and com-
munity too soon when he passed away on 
April 28, 2021 at the age of 52. He led a life 
of service to his country and to New Bedford 
and set an example of what true heroism 
looks like. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
life of Sergeant Michael Cassidy. I ask that my 
colleagues join me in recognizing his lifetime 
of service to our country and the people of 
Massachusetts.

THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
LEADINGTON 
FREE WILL BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Leadington Free Will Bap-
tist Church of Leadington. Missouri, organized 
100 years ago, under an old oak tree. It was 
in December of 1921 that J.L. Yancy and T.J. 
Mann organized the church. In 1923, church 
members voted to buy a little house in front of 
Woodlawn Cemetery where they worshiped 
until the present sanctuary was built in 1965. 
From a founding congregation of 11, the 
church has grown to 89 members today. Ruby 
Lawson is the oldest of the current worshipers 
who has attended the church all her life. 
Wayne Patton is Associate Pastor. Every Sun-
day, they gather at 9:45 a.m. for Sunday 
School and 10:45 a.m. for worship. 
Though the church’s records from 1929 until 
1946 have been lost. it is clear this house or 
worship has stood the test of time. It marks its 
centennial of service standing tall as a monu-
ment to its members’ enduring faith and com-
mitment to their community. 
I am proud to represent this dedicated body 
of believers as they mark the 100th anniver-
sary or Leadington Free Will Baptist Church 
on August 22, 2021, and to recognize them 
today before the United States House of Rep-
resentatives.

IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. TERESA 
‘TERRY’ RYNARD ON HER RE-
TIREMENT 
AS 
KANSAS 
CITY’S 
PARKS 
AND 
RECREATION 
DE-
PARTMENT DIRECTOR 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the achievements of 
Teresa ‘Terry’ Rynard, the Director of Kansas 
City’s Parks and Recreation Department, a 
woman who has dedicated her life to decades 
of service to the parks and people in Kansas 
City. Mrs. Rynard is retiring after accom-
plishing a milestone achievement in becoming 
the first woman to serve as Kansas City’s 
Parks and Recreation Director in the depart-
ment’s 129- year history. Her legacy of deter-
mination and selfless leadership will continue 
to inspire the lives of many beyond her term. 
Since the start of her career at the Parks 
and Recreation Department, Mrs. Rynard 
began paving the way for women to work in 
the field when at the young age of 16, she 
trimmed weeds and mowed fields of Kansas 
City’s parks despite protests from her male co-
workers. With perseverance, she climbed the 
ranks of the Department while she furthered 
her educational journey, earning a Bachelor of 
Arts and Education in 1986. In her 33 years 
with the Kansas City’s Parks and Recreation 
Department, Mrs. Rynard has served as 
equipment operator, area superintendent, as-
sistant park superintendent, deputy director, 
and finally Director of Parks and Recreation. 
Mrs. Rynard’s career stands as a shining ex-
ample of grit and being an outstanding com-
munity leader. 
Her contributions to the city can be seen ev-
eryday as one walks through its streets and 
parks. Not only did she succeed in efforts to 
make Kansas City safer, cleaner, and beau-
tiful, but she helped cultivate an equitable en-
vironment for all to enjoy. Mrs. Rynard fo-
cused on areas that had been neglected for 
years and created the Quality of Life Invest-
ment District, overseeing numerous park 
projects across the underserved parts of the 
city. She also oversaw the installation of Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Boulevard signs after years 
of debate, and the transition of Kansas City 
Museum management to the Kansas City Mu-
seum Foundation. In addition, Mrs. Rynard 
was elected to the American Academy for 
Park and Recreation Administration, an im-
mensely prestigious honor earned through her 
selflessness and leadership. These and count-
less other successes testify of what an invalu-
able member of our community she has been. 
Mrs. Rynard’s work for our city extends be-
yond the workplace and into her family. Her 
children have recounted times where, as a 
family, they would help their mother by picking 
up trash to clean shelters at parks when the 
Department was shorthanded. This proves her 
devotion to better the community and serve 
those around her, promising continued con-
tributions for our city even after her retirement. 
Terry will leave a legacy of kindness and 
diligence that will continue to live on in Kansas 
City and its Parks and Recreation Department 
forever. Her service has touched the lives of 
all who live in Kansas City and benefit from 
her works daily. The leadership she’s provided 
the Department has created a foundation to 
which to build upon as we continue our efforts 
in promoting equity, inclusion while developing 
our community. Terry’s deep care and love for 
our City will continue to be felt in every park, 
avenue, and public space in Kansas City.

RECOGNIZING AND HONORING 
JOSEPH SIVEWRIGHT 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the incredible 
work and service of Joseph Sivewright. At the 
end of 2021, he will officially retire as the 
Chairman of Nestle´ Purina PetCare after over 
30 years of outstanding leadership. 
Since joining Nestle´
Purina in 1985, Mr. 
Sivewright has held various positions through-
out the company as he proved himself to be 
a treasured employee. Prior to his role as 
Chairman, he was appointed as the com-
pany’s President & Chief Operating Officer 
and was then named President and Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer. 
Under Mr. Sivewright’s leadership, Nestle´ 
Purina has grown through numerous product 
innovations and the company has been recog-
nized as one of the ‘‘best places to work’’ by 
several St. Louis and national organizations. 
I want to personally thank Joe for his many 
years of friendship, as well as his desire to en-
sure Nestle´ Purina is a strong community part-
ner. His distinguished career and tremendous 
leadership are celebrated by our St. Louis 
community. I personally appreciate the impact 
his work ethic and constant drive to improve 
the lives of those around had on his employ-
ees. As a former Purina employee myself 
when I was just out of college, I know how im-
portant it is to have a smart and driven leader 
at the helm to set the tone for the rest of us 
and help us achieve even greater heights. 
Joe had a tremendous impact not only on 
all of those with whom he worked throughout 
his many years at Purina, but also on those 
he worked with outside of work as a dedicated 
member of our St. Louis community. We all 
appreciate everything he has done so far, and 
look forward to seeing what else he will ac-
complish in the coming years.

SENATOR CARL M. LEVIN 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, 
throughout my adult life, wherever I went in 
Michigan, from Copper Harbor to Monroe, I 
would run into people who would say. ‘I don’t 
always agree with Senator Levin, but I support 
him anyway because he is so genuine. he 
tells it straight and he follows through.’ 
Carl Levin personified integrity and the no-
tion of putting the public good above self-inter-
est. As he walked about the Capitol in a rum-
pled suit, almost always with a plain white 
shirt and pedestrian tie, carrying bulging files 
with the occasional paper flying away, Carl 
was the very picture of sober purpose and 
rectitude. In truth, he wasn’t unfun. In fact, he 
often pierced tense situations with self-depre-
cating humor, and he privately shared incisive 
observations about others with staff and col-
leagues. 
But Carl was all about the work, and the 
great honor the people of Michigan had be-
stowed upon him with their votes and their 
trust. He did not seek to divine their views to 
be popular, but rather to study the issues and 
advance the people’s interest to the best of 
his ability. Uncle Carl met with more presi-
dents, kings, queens and other important peo-
ple than all but a few of us ever will. But he 
treated them all the same as he did a Detroit 
autoworker or a beet farmer in Michigan’s 
Thumb—with a full measure of dignity but no 
airs, ever ready to puncture self-importance, 
posturing, mendacity and avarice. 
He was so well-prepared for every meeting, 
hearing, and conference that he challenged 
conventional boundaries between Senator and 
staff. He was one of the most challenging 
Senators to work for and one of the most re-
warding. Challenging, because you had better 
know your business in detail, since he surely 
did. Rewarding, because he had authentic re-
lationships with staff, treated them with deep 
respect, and was loyal to them. 
Uncle Carl was above all a family man. No 
matter the pressing business he faced as a 
Senator, he always centered Aunt Barbara, 
my cousins Kate, Laura and Erica and their 
families, devoted time to them and so obvi-
ously cherished them. And the way he loved 
and treated his family radiated out and served 
as a model for how he treated colleagues, 
staff, constituents, soldiers and the world. 
From my earliest memory to this moment, 
perhaps above all, he has defined with my 
dad how close two brothers, two siblings, two 
people can be. In the end, these two Jewish 
boys from Detroit, these grandsons of immi-
grants each served 36 years in Congress, 32 
of them together, becoming by far the longest 
co-serving siblings in the 232-year history of 
this place. As heartbroken as we are in this 
moment, I feel so grateful to have experienced 
this love and legacy.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE OFFICE OF NAVAL 
RESEARCH 
HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, today it is 
an honor for me to pay tribute to the Office of 
Naval Research and its contributions to our 
Sea Services, the Nation, and the pursuit of 
scientific and technological discovery on the 
occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary. 
The Office of Naval Research was estab-
lished by act of Congress on August 1, 1946, 
in the aftermath of World War II to ‘‘plan, fos-
ter, and encourage scientific research in rec-
ognition of its paramount importance as re-
lated to the maintenance of future naval 
power, and the preservation of national secu-
rity.’’ A product of wartime necessities that 
brought together government and military 
planners, academia, and industry to help 
make science and technology an essential tool

for victory, the Office of Naval Research grew 
into a vital organization dedicated to the en-
during warfighting requirements of the Navy 
and Marine Corps and the peacetime needs of 
the nation. The Office of Naval Research 
prioritizes building a close and essential rela-
tionship between the public good and the 
progress of science and technology. For sev-
enty-five years this agency has maintained 
that relationship through war and peace. Much 
of our infrastructure for the public support of 
science and technology. from the National 
Science Foundation to DARPA to the Air 
Force Office of Scientific Research and Army 
Research Office, was built in the years after 
the war using the model pioneered by the Of-
fice of Naval Research. 
In its early decades, the Office of Naval Re-
search supported research in the burgeoning 
fields of computing and directed energy, lead-
ing to the development of one of the first dig-
ital computers, Project Whirlwind, as well as 
the creation of the maser and laser. Its 
projects took scientists to the upper atmos-
phere in some of the highest recorded balloon 
ascents and brought human beings to the very 
bottom or the ocean in the Challenger Deep. 
Office of Naval Research-supported engineers 
and scientists created the first autonomous 
robot, as well as the first autonomous under-
sea vehicle. The Office of Naval Research, 
Arctic Research Laboratory helped several 
generations of scientists understand polar en-
vironments better. Its support led to the devel-
opment of atomic clocks; the key invention 
that made precision satellite navigation pos-
sible. Finally, and perhaps most of all, long- 
term support from the Office of Naval Re-
search led to the postwar blossoming of the 
ocean sciences, leading to countless discov-
eries in acoustics, wave prediction, meteor-
ology, marine mammal research, and climate 
studies. The invention of virtually every impor-
tant sensor and undersea vehicle that made 
these discoveries possible owes a debt to the 
stewardship of the Office of Naval Research. 
From aircraft to ships to weapons systems, 
nearly every platform in use by the Navy and 
Marine Corps today relies in some way on 
technology originally developed or enhanced 
by the Office of Naval Research’s sponsor-
ship. Medical advances such as QuikClot save 
the lives of Marines and Sailors. Portable en-
ergy technologies provide power to forces, ve-
hicles, and sensors. Laser weapon systems 
defend ships at sea. Materials developed 
through Office of Naval Research efforts pro-
tect the hulls of ships from marine organisms 
as well as the blast effects of weapons, and 
allow jet engines to work hotter, longer, and 
more efficiently than ever before. Today, Of-
fice of Naval Research programs are advanc-
ing the fields of artificial intelligence, auton-
omy, networking, directed energy, warfighter 
performance, maritime awareness, and next- 
generation power for the Navy and Marine 
Corps of the future. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
achievements of the Office of Naval Research, 
and I am certain the Members of the House 
will join me in recognizing the seventy-five 
years of scientific excellence this distinguished 
organization has provided—and seventy-five 
more that it will provide—to our Sailors and 
Marines and to the American people. 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF DEVOYD 
JENNINGS 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of Mr. Devoyd 
‘‘Dee’’ Jennings, the longtime President and 
CEO of the Fort Worth Metropolitan Black 
Chamber of Commerce. After a distinguished 
41-year long career within the organization, 
Mr. Jennings passed away on July 24, 2021 at 
the age of 73. 
After graduating from Texas Wesleyan Uni-
versity in 1971 with a degree in marketing, Mr. 
Jennings had a 27-year career at TXU as a 
Community Affairs Specialist and was the first 
African-American lobbyist employed by Texas 
Electric. Since its establishment, he worked for 
over four decades in various positions within 
the Fort Worth Metropolitan Black Chamber of 
Commerce. His commitment to ensure the or-
ganization’s mission ‘‘to make Fort Worth a 
better place to work and raise a family’’ truly 
serves as a model of civic leadership. 
Mr. Jennings’ professional and philanthropic 
efforts merited numerous awards from the Fort 
Worth community, including two commemora-
tive City of Fort Worth ‘‘Devoyd Jennings’’ 
days in 1992 and 2005. The Fort Worth Busi-
ness Press awarded him the Deal Maker 
award in 1998, recognized his contributions as 
a ‘‘Who’s Who in Economic Development’’ in 
1999, and, most recently, honored him with its 
‘‘Minority Leaders in Business Award’’ in 2017. 
Mr. Jennings worked tirelessly to provide 
new educational and economic opportunities 
for the citizens of Fort Worth. Amongst his en-
deavors, he helped established two stand-
alone organizations, the William Mann Com-
munity Development Corporation and South-
east Fort Worth Inc., which continue to en-
courage growth and development in minority 
neighborhoods in Fort Worth. In addition, he 
was instrumental in the reconstruction and re-
opening of his beloved high school alma 
mater, I.M. Terrell, as a STEM & Performing 
Arts Center. 
I join the community of Fort Worth in hon-
oring Mr. Jennings’ life and legacy and extend 
my sincere condolences to his friends and 
family. Devoyd ‘‘Dee’’ Jennings led a life of 
outstanding civic virtue and service and his 
dedicated efforts to improve Fort Worth as a 
place to live and work will continue to posi-
tively benefit his hometown for years to come.

today to remember Red Lake Nation Police 
Officer Ryan Andrew Bialke, who was killed in 
the line of duty on Tuesday, July 27. His death 
is an unbelievable tragedy—one that is felt by 
the community, state, and region. 
Officer Bialke always wanted to help others. 
After graduating from Rasmussen College, he 
moved to Bemidji and joined the Red Lake 
Nation Police Department, where he served 
the community for the past six years. He was 
an SOR officer, a breacher for the Emergency 
Response Team, and in charge of the Search 
and Rescue Dive Team. He was dedicated to 
the community in which he worked, often 
spending time with Red Lake’s children and 
families—always willing to go the extra mile. 
He is survived by his wife, Hester, his chil-
dren, his mother and brothers, and many other 
family members and friends. He is lovingly re-
membered as a kind, outgoing person who 
loved hockey, fishing, hunting, road trips, 
country music, and spending time with his 
family, friends, and other loved ones. He will 
be sorely missed. 
I am eternally grateful for Officer Bialke’s 
sacrifice, and the sacrifices the men and 
women of law enforcement make every day as 
they put their lives on the line to keep us safe.

HONORING DUSTY HILL AND ZZ 
TOP 
HON. TROY E. NEHLS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of rock and roll hall of famer and 
ZZ Top member Dusty Hill. Dusty was born 
and raised in Dallas, Texas and began playing 
bass at the age of 13. He didn’t take the con-
ventional route of bass players who usually 
start as guitarists and transition, instead he 
was a vocalist and picked up a bass one day 
and started playing. 
Embarrassment on stage was a ‘‘great 
motivator’’ for Dusty and he soon mastered 
the bass. From 1966 to 1968, Dusty played 
with fellow future ZZ Top bandmate Frank 
Beard in the Dallas based band American 
Blues. 
In 1970, wanting to focus more on rock and 
roll and less on blues, Dusty moved to Hous-
ton and joined ZZ Top with Frank Beard and 
Billy Gibbons. The trio performed their first 
concert together just outside of my district at 
the Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont, 
Texas on February 10, 1970. 
The trio of Frank Beard, Billy Gibbons, and 
Dusty Hill would stay together for the next 50 
years. The group produced their first charting 
single Francine in 1972 and again found suc-
cess in 1973 with the release of a top 10 Bill-
board 200 album Tres Hombres. In 1975, 
Dusty sang lead on one of the band’s most 
popular hits ‘‘Tush’’, before releasing their next

album Tejas in 1976. Over the next two years, 
ZZ Top continued to tour and perform before 
Dusty took a two year hiatus to work at the 
DFW airport saying ‘‘I did not want other peo-
ple to think I thought I was full of myself, but 
the main thing is I didn’t want to start feeling 
full of myself. So, I did it to ground myself.’’— 
a mindset many members in this very Cham-
ber could benefit from. 
During this 2-year downtime is when Dusty 
and his band mate Billy Gibbons grew their 
trademark long beards. When Dusty, Billy, and 
Frank remerged together in 1979, the band 
found success with their album Deguello, 
which went platinum and had another one of 
their hits ‘‘Cheap Sunglasses’’. 
But it wasn’t until 1983 that ZZ Top really hit 
it big with their album Eliminator which intro-
duced us to classic rock hits ‘‘Gimme All Your 
Lovin’’ and ‘‘Sharp Dressed Man’’ which re-
main staples on classic rock radio to this day. 
Over the next three decades, the band 
stuck together touring all across Texas and 
the world, entertaining tens of millions of fans. 
They continued to find success playing to-
gether until Dusty’s passing just three days 
ago. 
I know Dusty is missed greatly, but his 
music and personality will live on forever as a 
staple of Texas and Rock and Roll history.

HON. TOM REED

Division, Mr. Gleason was awarded the Com-
bat Infantryman’s Badge; the Bronze Star; and 
the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm. He 
was honorably discharged with the rank of 
Sergeant in September 1969 after a tour in 
Vietnam. 
As a lifelong resident of Yates County, Earle 
Gleason has dedicated a lifetime of commit-
ment and service to his country and to his 
community, particularly in service to local vet-
erans. His efforts benefiting veterans began 
with his career with the Yates County Vet-
erans’ Service Agency as Service Officer in 
July 1994. He later became Director of the 
Agency in September of 1994 and retired in 
December 2014 with twenty years of service. 
For more than two decades as Director, 
Earle was respected as a tireless advocate for 
his county’s more than two thousand veterans. 
He was also recognized by the community at 
large through his dedication to community 
service within the Johnson Costello American 
Legion Post 355, and as a Milo Town Council-
man for twenty-four years. He is currently 
serving as a Yates County Legislator. 
While Earle gives so much of himself in 
many areas of our community, we also greatly 
appreciate his efforts as part of our Academy 
Selection Committee. He has recently re-
signed from this work, but we would like to 
thank him for his time and dedication to the 
committee, especially in his role as Chairman. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me in 
recognizing the efforts and service of P. Earle 
Gleason, Vietnam Veteran, Yates County Vet-
erans’ Service Agency Director, and devoted 
Chairman of the 23rd Congressional District’s 
Academy Selection Committee.

PRAYER FOR HAITI BY PASTOR 
NEYLON SAMUEL 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to present a prayer for Haiti on be-
half of Pastor Neylon Samuel at World Har-
vest Seventh Day Adventist Church in the 
Ninth Congressional District of Texas. Pastor 
Samuel presented this prayer at a candlelight 
vigil held on Sunday, July 18, 2021 in remem-
brance of Haitian President Jovenel Moise. 
Gracious God, Creator of heaven and earth, 
God of all goodness and love, we bring before 
you today, our brothers and sisters of Haiti. 
As we lift this nation before you, we recog-
nize that it is you, O God, who made her peo-
ple in your very image and place within 
them a hunger and thirst for righteousness 
and liberty. 
They led the Americas in the struggle 
against slavery, and though they were the 
first to win lasting freedom, their struggle 
has never ceased. As you heard the cry of 
your suffering people in Egypt, today, we 
pray that you will hear the cry of your peo-
ple in Haiti calling out for justice. 
You—the God—who sees, frees, and re-
deems people, we ask that you raise up your 
people in Haiti from the ash heap of despair 
and give them strong hearts and strong 
hands. Lift their minds and their spirits and 
help them to bear this new burden. 
As details about the assassination of presi-
dent Jovenel Moise continue to unravel, we 
keep the Moise family and the nation of 
Haiti before you. Grant them your wisdom, 
strength, and hope in the face of all that is 
happening in their beautiful homeland. And 
because you are both a God of mercy and a 
God of justice. We ask that you exercise your 
judgment on these horrific acts that have 
taken place. Heinous acts such as these can 
shake the strongest of us to our core and 
make us fearful. But we ask that you will be 
with those who are hurting and afraid. 
We pray that this nation, which is so often 
noted as the poorest country in the Western 
Hemisphere. This nation that is today, 
marked by political instability, corruption, 
civil unrest, crime, and extreme poverty, 
will once again be known as the ‘‘Pearl of 
the Antilles’’. We pray for the removal of 
systemic evils holding back this nation. We 
Pray for schools, trying to educate children 
amid violence. We pray for light to shine in 
corrupt areas in the country. Pray for godly 
leaders in government and business. 
God, we ask that you bring healing and 
prosperity to Haiti. Protect her from those 
who would abuse her. We pray that her may 
sorrow cease and her joy abound. Let her 
generosity be known in all the lands, and her 
glad songs of freedom be heard to the ends of 
the earth. Bless her children of that they 
may know a better world and a brighter fu-
ture. 
As for us, O God, we who are far away from 
the chaos and the confusion, from the sob-
bing and moans, but who yet hold the people 
of Haiti close in our hearts. Imbue us with 
the strength of Simon of Cyrene, that we 
may carry the cross of the Haitian people. 
Show us how to bear their burdens and light-
en their yoke with our prayers, our aid, our 
resources. In our own country, teach us to do 
justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with 
you, O God, that we may stand before you 
unashamed and with integrity, as we walk 
hand in hand with our brothers and sisters of 
Haiti. We ask this in the name of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker.

HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING

E859 
July 30, 2021 
IN RECOGNITION OF DR. REX AR-
CHER ON HIS RETIREMENT AS 
KANSAS 
CITY’S 
HEALTH 
DE-
PARTMENT DIRECTOR 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep sense of gratitude that I rise today to 
celebrate Dr. Rex Archer, an individual that 
went above and beyond to serve our commu-
nity. His work in public health began more 
than two decades ago, where he has served 
as the Kansas City Health Director. His com-
mitment and contributions to better the region 
are unparalleled, shaping Kansas City’s Health 
Department into a department that we can all 
be proud to have in Missouri’s Fifth District. 
Before serving Kansas Citians, Mr. Archer 
studied at the University of Kansas where he 
completed his medical degree then his mas-
ter’s in public health at the University of Michi-
gan. His experience allowed him to hold local 
and state health positions in Maryland and 
was even a primary advocate for protection 
policies for nonsmokers from tobacco smoke. 
The skills and knowledge he earned, prepared 
and made him a more than qualified to lead 
the Health Department in Kansas City. 
Under Dr. Archer’s guidance, Kansas City, 
Missouri’s Health Department became one of 
the first in the country to be nationally accred-
ited, demonstrating its continuous efforts to 
fulfill its mission of providing quality health 
care options and resources to Kansas Citians. 
The department was recognized by the Na-
tional Association of County and City Health 
Officials and received the ‘‘Local Health De-
partment of the Year Award in Health Equity,’’ 
in addition to the ‘‘Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation Culture of Health’’ prize. 
Dr. Archer dedication to improve public 
health can be traced to the agency’s emer-
gency response to HIV in response to the 
havoc it had on our local minority commu-
nities, the swine flu epidemic, and most re-
cently, his leadership throughout the COVID– 
19 pandemic. He led the fight in combating 
the spread of COVID–19 with compassion and 
expertise, even delaying his retirement for 
eight months to continue to support the city 
and protect its members through an unprece-
dented tragedy. A champion of inclusivity and 
equity, Dr. Archer continuously advocated to 
bring more resources to the region when Kan-
sas City, Missouri, was not receiving sufficient 
COVID–19 
vaccines. 
Once 
received, 
he 
pushed vaccination efforts to reach our under-
served communities. His leadership and dedi-
cation serve as an example of how to unify 
different sectors of the community such as 
elected officials, experts, and media for the 
greater good of the people we serve. 
Looking beyond his extraordinary work in 
emergency health crises, Dr. Archer and his 
team have prioritized delivering equitable 
healthcare services and resources on, ex-
panding the range of services at the Kansas 
City Health Department. Along those new ini-
tiatives are the Healthy Homes program that 
provides sanitary homes for all, efforts to en-
sure families have access to healthy and qual-
ity meals and establishing mental health serv-
ices to help combat violent crime. 
As a result of his successful career in Kan-
sas City, he has held the position of president 
for the National Association of County and 
City Health Officials and served on the Public 
Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) of Direc-
tors, amongst other national public health 
committees. While he may often be behind the 
scenes, his work in public health can be felt 
and seen widely throughout many lives within 
our community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing Dr. Rex Archer for the 
tremendous accomplishments throughout his 
career and his tireless efforts in providing Kan-
sas City with equitable healthcare for all. His 
contributions to our community have made 
him a valued member of Missouri’s Fifth Dis-
trict and I speak on the behalf of the entire 
district when I say thank you Dr. Rex Archer. 
While he embraces this next chapter, I wish 
Dr. Archer many rewarding years in retirement 
and honor his dedication to public health.

TEXAS 
DELEGATION 
WELCOMES 
NEWEST MEMBER OF CONGRESS, 
JAKE ELLZEY 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise along 
with my colleagues, Congresswoman EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON, the Dean of the Texas Del-
egation, Congresswoman KAY GRANGER, the 
co-Dean of the Texas Republican delegation, 
and other members from Texas—the greatest 
delegation—for the swearing in of our newest 
Member of Congress, JAKE ELLZEY. 
JAKE is a native Texan from Amarillo who 
left Texas to attend the United States Naval 
Academy. 
He was commissioned in the Navy upon 
graduation and then earned the coveted gold 
wings as a Naval aviator. 
JAKE served in the Navy for the next 20 
years with honor, distinction, and valor. 
He served in numerous deployments and in 
6 combat tours—five in the skies over Iraq 
and Afghanistan and a tour in ground combat 
in the mountains of Afghanistan, where he di-
rected critical and timely air support for mem-
bers of Seal Team Six engaged in combat 
there. 
He has been decorated with two Bronze 
stars for his service in combat. 
After retiring from the Navy, JAKE returned 
to Texas but remained committed to public 
service. 
He was appointed by Governor Perry as a 
Commissioner on the Texas Veterans Com-
mission for six years and was then elected to 
the Texas House of Representatives. 
JAKE also returned to the skies as a com-
mercial airline pilot flying out of Dallas/Forth 
Worth and raising his son and daughter with 
his wife Shelby in Ellis County, Texas. 
Texans have a great deal of respect and 
admiration for those who volunteer to go in 
harm’s way in service to their country. 
JAKE is the sixth military veteran Texas vot-
ers have sent to Congress just this year. 
He brings a wealth of experience in national 
security, military affairs, veterans affairs, busi-
ness, and aviation with him to Congress. 
This day, no doubt, marks the beginning of 
yet another rewarding chapter in a distin-
guished career of service. 
On behalf of the Texas delegation, I’m 
thrilled to welcome JAKE ELLZEY, his wife 
Shelby, and his son and daughter to the 
United States Congress.

HONORING VERNON RAY HANCOCK 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Vernon Ray Hancock, who died on 
June 19, 2021, at the age of 94. Mr. Hancock 
served nearly 30 years as the Math Depart-
ment Chair at Emory & Henry College and 
made a remarkable impact on the students 
and the university. 
Mr. Hancock was born on July 10, 1926, in 
Baltimore, Maryland to Wheeler Hancock & 
Rebecca Helm Hancock. In 1943, Mr. Han-
cock enlisted in the United States Army. After 
graduating high school, the Army sent him to 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute for engineering 
classes. Following WWII, he went on to work 
as a clerk typist in France and was later hon-
orably discharged in December 1946 with the 
rank of Tech 4. Mr. Hancock received his 
graduate degree in math at Johns Hopkins 
University and his doctorate at Tulane Univer-
sity. Years later, Mr. Hancock returned to the 
Commonwealth and settled in to make Virginia 
his life-long home. 
Mr. Hancock married Ruth Eileen Farnham 
in 1950, and the two of them were inseparable 
as they volunteered together in their commu-
nity. Throughout his life, both Mr. and Mrs. 
Hancock were active members of the United 
Methodist Church. From his appointment at 
Emory & Henry in 1963 until after his retire-
ment in 1991, Mr. Hancock remained an ac-
tive member of the academic and service 
community. He saw his life mission was to 
serve those around him and he found great 
joy in this selfless service to his community. 
Together with his wife, they served with the 
Boy Scouts of America, chartered the Pi Omi-
cron chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega Service 
Fraternity at Emory (of which I was Member), 
and they were also heavily involved in the 
Washington County Republican Party. I per-
sonally knew Mr. Hancock when he was my 
Faculty Advisor to the Emory & Henry College 
Republicans and through his decades of work 
with the Republican Party. 
Mr. Hancock is survived by his 2 sons; Dale 
and his wife Nancy, Clark and his wife 
Frances; his granddaughter, Bethany; and nu-
merous nieces and nephews. I offer them my 
condolences on their loss.

his own life—an act for which he was awarded 
the Navy Cross. 
A motor vehicle operator for Third Battalion, 
Twenty-Fifth Marines, Lance Corporal Corbin 
was part of a convoy responding to a report of 
a platoon under fire near Haditha on May 7, 
2005. As they approached the scene, a van 
loaded with explosives charged toward them, 
detonating between two of the convoy’s vehi-
cles. A brutal firefight ensued, during which 
many were injured and four—three Marines 
and a Navy corpsman—were killed. Most of 
the convoy’s vehicles were disabled in this ini-
tial attack. 
Lance Corporal Corbin immediately posi-
tioned his seven-ton truck between the enemy 
and the wounded Marines. After reporting the 
situation to the battalion, he immediately took 
charge at the scene, directing return fire. 
Under this covering fire, and disregarding the 
continued onslaught of the enemy, he re-
trieved his wounded patrol leader, placing him 
over his shoulder and bringing him back to the 
truck—all while firing at the enemy with his 
free hand. 
He made five total trips through the kill zone 
to recover his dead and wounded comrades, 
shielding them from the enemy while returning 
them to the convoy. Despite the severe dam-
age to his truck, which by this time had three 
flat tires, Lance Corporal Corbin drove it away 
from the scene and to an aid station five miles 
away. Because of his quick-thinking and he-
roic actions, no Marine was lost after the initial 
attack. 
Lance Corporal Corbin is now Huron County 
Sheriff Corbin, re-elected to a second term 
last year. He credits the Marine Corps for 
helping him enhance the leadership skills that 
are so essential to his job, encouraging every-
one in his command to be at their personal 
and professional best when interacting with 
the public. 
Madam Speaker, we are grateful that peo-
ple like Todd Corbin stand up and volunteer to 
serve this great Nation. He risked his life to 
save others under the most difficult conditions. 
For this, each and every one of us owes him 
a great debt of gratitude. I thank Sheriff Corbin 
for his many sacrifices on our behalf and wish 
him every success in the future.

REMEMBERING THE LEGACY OF 
DEVOYD ‘‘DEE’’ JENNINGS 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor the legacy of Devoyd 
‘‘Dee’’ Jennings—a hardworking and dedi-
cated member of our Fort Worth community. 
Dee dedicated his life to ensuring the suc-
cess, strength and mobility of the Black com-
munity in Fort Worth. Dee was born in 1947 
in Fort Worth. After graduating from I.M Terrell 
High School in 1966, he attended Tarrant 
County College and continued his education at 
Texas Wesleyan University where he grad-
uated with a marketing degree in 1971. 
He began his nearly 30 years of service for 
North Texas with TXU as a Community Affairs 
Specialist, and served as the first Black lob-
byist for Texas Electric. Dee used his own ex-
periences to help others. He quickly became 
an influential mentor to minorities pursuing ca-
reers in business as he served on numerous 
boards including the Texas Association of 
Business, the North Texas Commission, the 
Texas Association of African American Cham-
bers and as a chairman of the NTTA’s Busi-
ness Diversity Advisory Committee. 
The pinnacle of Dee’s career came when he 
began his most recent position as president 
and CEO of the Fort Worth Black Chamber of 
Commerce. He left a powerful legacy by using 
this position to fight for economic opportunity 
for the Black community in Fort Worth. 
Dee also assisted with the creation of two 
stand-alone organizations that directly serve to 
benefit minority development—the William 
Mann Community Development Corp and 
Southeast Fort Worth Inc. Because of his work 
with local government bodies, he was able to 
establish minority and women-owned business 
enterprise goals. 
His long and appreciated service to the 
community of Fort Worth has been honored as 
he was a proud receiver of the Minority Lead-
ers in Business Award in 2017 and was recog-
nized with a proclamation for Devoyd Jennings 
Day. 
Devoyd ‘‘Dee’’ Jennings—a public servant, 
successful businessman, and strong leader— 
will be deeply missed by our Fort Worth com-
munity.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
KERN 
COUNTY 
FIRE 
DEPART-
MENT CHIEF DAVID WITT 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize David Witt on his retire-
ment as the Chief of the Kern County Fire De-
partment (KCFD). 
David graduated with an associate’s degree 
from Bakersfield College and a bachelor’s de-
gree in Range Resource Science from Hum-
boldt State University, giving him a unique skill 
set for tackling the diverse terrain that the 
Kem County Fire Department covers. His in-
terest in firefighting and emergency response 
were rooted well before his time in Kem Coun-
ty, as he had served with both the United 
States Forest Service and the California De-
partment of Forestry and Fire Protection be-
fore being hired at KCFD. 
David served in a variety of roles at Kem 
County Fire Department, including managing 
its air program, operations, and logistics. In 
June 2019, the Kem County Board of Super-
visors recognized his leadership and hard 
work on behalf of our community by unani-
mously selecting David to become Fire Chief. 
As KCFD Fire Chief, David successfully led 
a department of nearly 500 uniformed staff 
and oversaw emergency responses over a 
two-year period that included historic wildfire 
seasons, massive earthquakes, and a global 
pandemic. He was not only responsible for the 
safety of his personnel and the people of Kern 
County, but he was also responsible for over-
seeing the finances and operations of the de-
partment’s $150 million budget. In that role, he 
excelled. KCFD was $10 million in the red 
when David took over the top department 
spot. Yet as a fiscally responsible, no-non-
sense Chief, David turned the Department’s fi-
nances around and KCFD is now operating in 
the black. 
Even before becoming Fire Chief, David 
was well-known for his hard work and con-
tributions throughout our community. In 2010, 
he was recognized by the American Legion, 
earning a certificate of commendation. In 
2013, he received the Kern River Valley Ex-
change Club’s Firefighter of the Year Award. 
In 2017, he was recognized by KCFD with a 
letter of commendation, a testament to his 
work ethic and savvy that set him apart. David 
also serves on the Board of Directors for Kern 
County and Eastern Sierra Chapter of the 
American Red Cross, where he lends his ex-
pertise to the organization. He also previously 
served as a Board Director and as Treasurer 
for the Southern California Association of For-
esters and Fire Wardens. 
David knows the needs of the people he 
protects, and when that includes nine different 
cities, 41 different distinct communities, and 
8,163 square miles, that becomes an incred-
ible challenge. David may be taking a step 
back from his role as Fire Chief of the Kern 
County Fire Department, but I am confident 
that his tenure will be remembered across our 
community through his mentorship of fire-
fighters and his leadership during times of 
emergency response and disaster recovery. 
On behalf of California’s 23rd Congressional 
District, I want to thank David for his service 
to our community, and want to also thank his 
wife Pegeen and their children Andrew and 
Courtland for supporting him during his many 
years of public service to our community. I 
wish David and his family well as he settles 
into a much-deserved retirement.

IN HONOR OF NATIONAL WHISTLE-
BLOWER APPRECIATION DAY 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to salute whistleblowers and to mark a 
day of appreciation for their critical contribution 
to American justice and to the safety and se-
curity of us all. Whistleblowers, among other 
things, keep companies that do business with 
the federal government honest and account-
able. Working from confidential tips and in-
sights provided by whistleblowers in qui tam 
cases, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) 
recovers billions of dollars annually under the 
False Claims Act. Over a recent four-year pe-
riod, the government recovered $11.4 billion in 
fraud prosecutions and distributed more than 
$1.54 billion in whistleblower reward pay-
ments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

July 30, 2021 
For example, last year, a major toxicology 
laboratory was required to pay the government 
$12 million in a False Claims Act qui tam case 
when it was found to have paid unlawful kick-
backs to a marketer and health care provider 
in exchange for referrals for urine drug tests. 
The whistleblower-inspired investigation also 
led to a criminal indictment of individuals in-
volved in the scheme and the establishment of 
a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with 
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ice’s Office of Inspector General, which re-
quired the company to retain an Independent 
Review Organization to monitor its arrange-
ments with individuals and other entities and 
to routinely report to the Office of Inspector 
General. 
Those who blow the whistle on federal con-
tractors are typically awarded 15 to 30 percent 
of the funds recovered by DOJ. One whistle 
blower collected $4 million in a False Claims 
Act qui ram case on behalf of the government 
against two contractors that knowingly failed to 
comply with federal and state prevailing wage 
laws. The contractors agreed to correct their 
compensation practices, and their employees 
were paid back wages. 
In these cases, whistleblowers brought the 
fraud to light, companies were held account-
able, taxpayer funds were recovered, future 
misconduct was averted, and workers were 
made whole. 
I want to thank my constituent Renee 
Brooker, partner at Tycko & Zavareei LLP and 
former Civil Frauds Assistant Director at DOJ 
for sharing her expertise on whistleblower law 
with my office. 
Today, on National Whistleblower Apprecia-
tion Day, I ask my colleagues to recognize 
whistleblowers and to encourage more individ-
uals to become whistleblowers.

HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the career of newly retired Special 
Agent Scott D. Payne, who spent 28 years in 
law enforcement keeping our communities and 
our country safe. 
Special Agent Payne started his law en-
forcement career in Greenville, South Caro-
lina. He served in the Greenville County Sher-
iffs office for five years, working as a Uniform 
Patrol Officer and a Vice and Narcotics Inves-
tigator. 
In 1998, he joined the FBI and became the 
primary undercover agent in many long-term 
undercover operations. He risked his safety to 
investigate violent motorcycle gangs, public 
corruption, murder for hire, drug trafficking or-
ganizations, and domestic terrorist groups with 
international ties. He was also an FBI SWAT 
Team Operator for over 7 years, diving head- 
first into dangerous situations to bring down 
violent criminals. 
Special Agent Payne would go on to be-
come an instructor in firearms, tactics, and un-
dercover work. Thousands of law enforcement 
officers across the country were trained under 
his leadership. He was also the Principal Tac-
tical Instructor, Principle Defensive Tactics In-
structor, and Lead Active Shooter Instructor 
for FBI Knoxville. 
Special Agent Payne spent his career keep-
ing folks safe, stopping criminals, and pre-
paring the next generation of law enforcement 
officers for duty. I thank Special Agent Payne 
for his service. I wish him the best of luck in 
his retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CALIFORNIA DE-
PARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS’ HOME LOAN PROGRAM 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and celebrate the 100th Anniver-
sary of the California Department of Veterans 
Affairs’ Home Loan Program. For a century, 
this loan assistance program has helped vet-
erans and their families realize the American 
dream of homeownership after returning from 
their service to our country. 
The Farm and Home Loan Program was 
created on May 30, 1921, to thank California 
veterans for their service and sacrifice in 
World War I. This program identified home-
ownership as a foundational step towards 
transitioning to civilian life, establishing credit, 
and building a strong financial future for vet-
erans and their families. Over the course of 
the last hundred years, the Home Loan Pro-
gram has aided veterans throughout times of 
war and economic crisis, including the Great 
Depression, the Great Recession, and most 
recently, the COVID–19 pandemic. 
During its existence, the program has dis-
tributed more than $8.5 billion in loans to over 
425,000 veterans and expanded to serve a 
growing 
and 
diverse 
veteran 
population. 
Today, the Home Loan Program is renowned 
for some of the lowest foreclosure rates in the 
country, personalized service, and a com-
prehensive homeowners insurance plan; and 
continues to deliver exceptional customer 
service to veterans who would otherwise not 
qualify for a loan. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that my home 
state has been a pioneer in assisting veterans 
to secure housing and I congratulate the Cali-
fornia Department of Veterans Affairs on their 
exceptional work throughout the decades. The 
Home Loan Program has been a lifeline to 
thousands of veterans over the past 100 
years, and I know that it will continue to help 
veterans achieve homeownership for the next 
100 to come.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, had I been

COMMEMORATING THE 56TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
MEDICARE 
AND 
MEDICAID 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate the 56th Anniversary of the 
passage of Medicaid and Medicare, two of the 
most beneficial and consequential government 
programs ever launched. 
On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into 
law as part of the Social Security Act and in 
the process made good on the commitments 
made by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, 
Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and John 
Kennedy to provide health security to Ameri-
cans in their old age. 
Medicare is a promise kept to those who 
have contributed a lifetime to our nation could 
enjoy their golden years with peace of mind 
and the security of reliable, affordable, and 
high quality healthcare. 
Likewise, Medicaid created a crucial part-
nership between the government and the peo-
ple to provide a basic health care safety net 
for the most vulnerable Americans: children of 
adults with low incomes, persons with disabil-
ities, and the poor. 
Madam Speaker, 56 years later, the legacy 
of these programs have I proven how effective 
and critical government action can be to the 
life and wellbeing of our nation’s most vulner-
able. 
In 1965, almost half of all Americans aged 
65 and older had no health coverage, living in 
fear that the colossal healthcare costs would 
drive them and their families into poverty. 
Today, because of Medicare, over 98 per-
cent of seniors have health insurance, which 
has led to a five-year increase in life expect-
ancy for those over 65. 
Today, 55 million Americans rely on Medi-
care for health care, ranging from preventive 
services, hospital visits, lab tests, to critical 
medical supplies, and prescription drugs. 
It is difficult for some to imagine what 1965 
was really like, when today affordable, acces-
sible and available health insurance is a reality 
for so many people living with disabilities. 
Before Medicaid was enacted children from 
poor families, pregnant I women, and low-in-
come working Americans were not able to af-
ford even the most basic medical care they 
needed to remain healthy and productive. 
When the legislation was first passed, many 
claimed that Medicaid would not live up to its 
promise; but today, because of expansion of 
Medicaid through passage of the Affordable 
Care Act the program provides comprehensive 
coverage for over 70 million children, pregnant 
women, low-income adults, and people living 
with disabilities. 
Madam Speaker, it cannot be seriously dis-
puted that Medicare and Medicaid have 
changed our country and made it better. 
In my home state of Texas and in commu-
nities across the country, both programs have 
significantly changed the lives and improved 
health outcomes of many Americans over the 
past century and represent the best of Amer-
ican values. 
Unfortunately, Texas has the highest per-
centage of uninsured in the nation, and Texas’

refusal to participate in the Medicaid expan-
sion created by the Affordable Care act puts 
the poor residents in my state in Jeopardy. 
So the 56th anniversary of Medicaid is bit-
tersweet for Texans because while we cele-
brate a program that has saved lives, helped 
people 
live 
longer, 
expanded 
care 
to 
marginalized communities, and reduced dis-
parities in access to healthcare, thousands of 
low income Texans still do not have the peace 
of mind that comes with access to affordable, 
quality health care enjoyed by low-income 
residents of states that have expanded their 
Medicaid program with funds made possible 
by the Affordable Care Act. 
In the 18th Congressional District of Texas 
there are 195,400 persons with Medicaid and 
74,704 with medical care provided by Medi-
care. 
Madam Speaker, my constituents favor the 
Affordable Care Act because they understand 
the insecurity and feeling of helplessness of 
being uninsured or underinsured. 
Like Medicare and Medicaid, the Affordable 
Care Act, or ‘‘Obamacare,’’ was vehemently 
opposed and derided by its adversaries, who 
said it was too costly, would not work, was un-
necessary, or would change the character of 
America for the worse. 
Like the critics of Social Security, Medicare, 
and the G.I. Bill, all of whom are silent now, 
they are wrong. 
The Affordable Care Act has been an un-
qualified success. 
This historic legislation has extended afford-
able health coverage to tens of millions of 
Americans and has helped to bring peace of 
mind to many of those for whom relief seemed 
far out of reach. 
The Affordable Care Act was driven by a 
simple premise: that citizens of the most pros-
perous nation on earth should not be forced to 
choose between their health and their financial 
security. 
Since the passage of the ACA in 2010, the 
number of uninsured , Americans has fallen by 
nearly one-third, or roughly 16 million people. 
These Americans come from all walks of 
life. 
They are women, who can no longer be de-
nied coverage or be forced to pay exorbitant 
amounts for coverage simply because of their 
sex. 
They are nine million seniors and persons 
with disabilities, who have saved an average 
of $1,600 on expensive and lifesaving pre-
scription medication. 
And they are this country’s most at risk citi-
zens; people who are working hard and strug-
gling make ends meet while living in near-pov-
erty, and who have been covered by Medicaid 
expansion in 32 states and the District of Co-
lumbia. 
These benefits have been felt across the 
country, especially in my home state of Texas: 
1. 10. 7 million individuals with pre-existing 
conditions such as asthma, cancer, or diabe-
tes—including up to 1,632,000 children—no 
longer have to worry about being denied cov-
erage or charged higher prices because of 
their health status or history; 
2. 4.9 million uninsured Texans have new 
health insurance options through Medicaid or 
private health plans in the ACA Marketplace; 
and 
3. 5.2 million persons on private insurance 
have gained coverage for at least one free 
preventive health care service such as a 
mammogram, birth control, or an immunization 
in 2011 and 2012. 
In addition to the tangible healthcare bene-
fits for millions of families, the ACA has had 
powerful effects on the financial state of our 
nation. 
Since the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act, we have extended the solvency of the 
Medicare Trust fund by more than a decade 
and helped save taxpayers $116 billion 
through new Medicare efficiencies. 
The Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices has estimated that hospitals saved more 
than $5.7 billion in costs that would have nor-
mally gone unpaid by patients without insur-
ance. 
Contrary to the claims of the ACA’s critics, 
private insurance companies have leaped at 
the opportunity to compete for business 
among the newly insured, and the healthcare 
industry has boomed. 
Through all of these successes, however, 
House Republicans remained obsessed with 
destroying this law, and unraveling the secu-
rity it provides to millions of Americans. 
Medicare and Medicaid also continue to 
drive innovation and set the standard for cov-
erage, quality, and innovation in American 
healthcare. 
Madam Speaker, Medicare and Medicaid 
continue to play crucial roles in providing equi-
table and affordable healthcare, leading inno-
vation in payment and delivery reform, car-
rying out outreach to the most vulnerable com-
munities, and reshaping the delivery of care 
for the future. 
Because of these programs, more Ameri-
cans have access to affordable, equitable 
health care today than at any point in our his-
tory. 
And I am committed to making sure that 
number will continue to grow. 
On this 56th anniversary of Medicare and 
Medicaid, we should remember that a healthy 
America is a prosperous America. 
And as we look ahead to the next half cen-
tury, we can celebrate that what was put in 
place in 1965 has given us the foundation for 
a healthy and prosperous future for all Ameri-
cans.

OF 
ASHLEE 
WARD ON HER INDUCTION INTO 
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS

HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

It is an honor to recognize Ashlee on her in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May her story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today

A native of Norristown, Pennsylvania, Bill 
was widely known throughout his adopted 
home of Cape Cod as a leader in the hospi-
tality industry. He was equally known for his

willingness to step up to support countless 
charitable causes in the community. 
Moving to Cape Cod in 1988, Bill operated 
a number of establishments throughout the re-
gion over the years including: The Flying 
Bridge, the Coonamesset Inn, The Red Horse 
Inn, Tugboats, the Popponesset Inn, the Pic-
nic Box, and Clancy’s, among others. Owning 
and operating restaurants came naturally to 
Bill after serving in the 1980’s as President 
and CEO of the Seilers/Sodexo Corporation, 
overseeing 15,000 employees working in facili-
ties across the nation. 
A gifted executive, prior to his time in the 
hospitality industry, Bill spent two years as the 
President & Publisher of Tribune Publishing 
Company and also served as the as a director 
at the Tufts New England Medical Center. Re-
alizing a need to further his education in order 
to start his own business, Bill enrolled at 
Northeastern University where he received his 
M.B.A. and, most importantly, where he met 
his partner in life Linda Raub Zammer. 
Bill was firmly committed to helping his com-
munity. Whether he and Linda were advo-
cating for his industry as a past President of 
the Massachusetts Restaurant Association, 
fighting for educational opportunities for Cape 
Cod students, supporting our veterans and ac-
tive servicemembers, leading the Cape Sym-
phony and Conservatory as a Director or help-
ing foster children, their generosity of time and 
spirit was endless. They were recognized time 
after time for this, including as the Philan-
thropists of the Year from the Philanthropy 
Partners of the Cape and Islands. Bill also 
served on many boards, including with Cape 
Cod Healthcare Foundation, the Cape Cod 
Chamber of Commerce, and the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institute, among others. Most 
recently, during the COVID–19 pandemic, in 
addition to supporting his long-time employees 
who were out-of-work, Bill stepped up to help 
lead the Falmouth Cares Business Round-
table, which worked to support other busi-
nesses impacted by the pandemic. 
Bill Zammer never stopped moving, and the 
reminders of his investment in the greater 
Cape community will live on as a testament to 
his work. Among his greatest legacies will be 
the professional lives he changed in the hospi-
tality industry. His employees were his second 
family and many advanced their careers 
through the Linda and William Zammer Hospi-
tality Institute at Cape Cod Community Col-
lege. 
His greatest love, though, was always his 
family: his wife, Linda, his children Robert, 
Peter, and Joanne, his eight grandchildren, his 
mother, Wanda, and his three siblings. Madam 
Speaker, Bill Zammer’s ‘‘life well lived’’ has 
positively touched thousands of lives on Cape 
Cod through his professional abilities and 
good works and I am proud to have been his 
friend.

HON. GLENN THOMPSON 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam

unable to cast my vote on July 29, 2021. Had

IN RECOGNITION OF JEWELL 
COLBERT’S RETIREMENT 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor today to recognize the exceptional, life-
long public service career of Mr. Jewell 
Colbert. As an agent of the Social Security 
Administration, his service to our community, 
our country, and the federal government is in-
valuable. A dedicated public servant such as 
himself is more than deserving of praise. 
Mr. Colbert began his career in 1986 with 
the Social Security Administration, working as 
a Claims Representative in St. Joseph, Mis-
souri. He would then ascend the agency’s 
ranks, becoming Operations Supervisor, Dis-
trict Manager, Project Manager, and most re-
cently, Regional Communications Director. Mr. 
Colbert remained committed to educating and 
empowering 
the 
community 
around 
him 
through social security programs and undoubt-
edly impacted countless individuals. The last 
decade of his career as Regional Communica-
tions Director was especially significant. He 
continued his dedicated loyalty as a civil serv-
ant to the public and organization he served, 
demonstrating steadfast leadership throughout 
his senior positions. His devotion to people, 
public service, and inspiring leadership were 
hallmarks of his career. 
During Mr. Colbert’s time at the Social Se-
curity Administration, the agency played a sig-
nificant role in improving the lives of thou-
sands. In the 1990s, the SSA was established 
as an independent agency and immediately 
began working on behalf of the American peo-
ple. During this time, the SSA defined itself by 
expanding Disability and Supplemental Secu-
rity Income programs and aiding the public in 
personal financial planning. In the 2000s, the 
SSA created the ‘‘Final Rule’’ doctrine, which 
set a standard for quick determination of ben-
efits for disabled individuals. It also estab-
lished certain rights these individuals would 
have, such as a federal review of state ruling. 
These advances were incredibly beneficial, es-
pecially to those who could not work and rely 
on Social Security benefits to pay for neces-
sities. The progress made by the Social Secu-
rity Administration during Mr. Colbert’s career 
had a lasting impact still in place today. 
The selfless spirit of service displayed by 
Mr. Colbert throughout his career is a shining 
example of the lessons taught to us in scrip-
ture. Acts 20:35 reads, ‘‘Remember the words 
of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is 
more blessed to give than to receive.’ ’’ Mr. 
Colbert exemplified this statement through his 
hard work and dedication to his community. 
His leadership and service provided aid to 
those who most needed it and was integral in 
making Social Security programs inclusive and 
accessible to the public. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Jewell Colbert’s lifetime of public service. His 
immense impact will continue through the mul-
titude of lives he improved. On behalf of Mis-
souri’s Fifth District, I wish Mr. Colbert great 
joy and relaxation in retirement. 
HONORING MAPLE LEAF FARMS 
CEO 
AND 
CHAIRMAN 
OF 
THE 
BOARD TERRY TUCKER ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Terry Tucker, who retired this 
summer after decades at the helm of Maple 
Leaf Farms in Leesburg, Indiana. Under his 
leadership, this family-owned business has be-
come a top duck producer in North America, 
as well as a major center of economic growth 
and job creation in our community. 
A lifelong Hoosier, Terry has firsthand expe-
rience with the many tasks required to run a 
busy duck farm. His history with Maple Leaf 
Farms began as a part-time job in high school 
when his tasks ranged from cleaning out duck 
barns to loading ducks for transport to proc-
essing plants. 
While he was in college at Purdue Univer-
sity, Terry married Sandra Wentzel, the 
daughter of Maple Leaf Farms founder Donald 
Wentzel. After graduating with a degree in ag-
riculture economics, Terry returned to the farm 
full time in 1963 and quickly demonstrated 
leadership and business acumen. He was 
named treasurer in 1966 and, after Donald’s 
death, was promoted to executive vice presi-
dent in 1968. As Maple Leaf Farms grew in 
both capacity and numbers, Terry’s respon-
sibilities continued to increase. In 1974, he 
was named chief executive officer, president, 
and chairman of the board of Maple Leaf 
Farms. 
For more than 30 years, Terry strategically 
led Maple Leaf Farms and invested in its 
growth. Under his leadership, the Tucker Fam-
ily expanded and modernized the farm’s oper-
ations, including acquiring the United States’ 
largest duck producer, C&D Foods of Wis-
consin, constructing new biosecure facilities, 
and doubling the capacity of its Indiana duck 
processing plant. 
In 2001, Terry stepped down as president of 
the company and turned this responsibility 
over to his sons, Scott and John, who serve 
as co-presidents for the company. Since then, 
he has remained incredibly active in Maple 
Leaf Farms as CEO and chairman of the 
board of directors, helping to lead this Indiana 
company into the 21st century. 
In addition to his work at Maple Leaf Farms, 
Terry also has volunteered his time and exper-
tise to invest in our region and the industry, 
serving on many boards, including Lakeland 
Financial Corporation, Indiana Chamber of 
Commerce, Purdue Research Foundation, Lib-
erty Mutual, Federal Reserve Bank of Chi-
cago, Indiana State Poultry Association, Poul-
try & Egg Institute of America, and the Indiana 
Institute of Agriculture, Food & Nutrition. In 
recognition of his accomplishments, Terry has 
been honored with many awards, including an 
Honorary Doctorate of Agriculture from Purdue 
University in 1995. 
Terry and his wife, Sandra, have invested 
decades of hard work to our region, building a 
successful business and feeding American 
families. They are incredible leaders in our 
community and have made remarkable con-
tributions to this vital industry. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of 2nd District 
Hoosiers, I want to thank Terry Tucker for his

IN RECOGNITION OF BRYCE 
BONEAU 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the achievements of Bryce 
Boneau, a phenomenal North Texas student 
and athlete. Mr. Boneau, a 2021 graduate of 
Keller High School, was presented with the 
prestigious Gatorade National Player of the 
Year Award. With this achievement, he joins a 
select list of elite athletes across the nation, 
including Lebron James, MLS Cup Champion 
Alecko Eskandarian and former U.S. National 
team star Claudio Renya. 
Through his competitive spirit and drive, Mr. 
Boneau led the Keller High School Boys Soc-
cer Team to a remarkable 17–3 season while 
contributing 18 goals and 19 assists in only 20 
games. Under his leadership, the KHS Indians 
reached the Class 6A Region I Semifinals. Mr. 
Boneau suffered an ACL injury prior to the 
match, and his team unfortunately lost to Allen 
High School. 
In addition, Bryce Boneau has been recog-
nized for his stellar academic ability and com-
munity contributions. He graduated from Keller 
High School with a 4.0 GPA and actively vol-
unteered in St. Barnabas Anglican Church’s 
youth ministry and outreach to provide refur-
bished sports equipment for underserved 
youths. 
Mr. Boneau’s athletic talents have earned 
him a spot on the roster at Notre Dame’s Var-
sity Soccer program where he will enter, and 
no doubt impress, as a freshman in fall 2021.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
MR. 
THEODORE 
BROWN CELEBRATING HIS 95TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a veteran and patriarch 
of a large, extended family who has been 
blessed with a long life and a deep faith. 
Theodore Roosevelt Brown, Sr. turns 95 on 
August 12, 2021, and I join with his family and 
friends in celebrating this significant milestone. 
Theodore Brown was born in Noel, Virginia, 
to the late Floyd and Nannie Brown. His moth-
er was known for her famous rolls and his fa-
ther dedicated much of his life to working at 
DuPont and as a minister. His sister Mary was 
born on his second birthday and the two grew 
up as close as twins. 
Early on, Theodore learned the value of 
hard work and education. As a child, he 
walked more than a mile to attend Hanover 
Public School. One of his proudest moments 
was earning second-place in the county’s 
spelling bee. While still in school, Theodore’s 
family moved to Richmond, where he attended 
Armstrong High School and participated in the 
R.O.T.C. and the school band. 
In his senior year, Theodore enlisted in the 
U.S. Army as the country was embroiled in 
World War II. He received his basic training at 
Fort Lee, Virginia and technical training at Fort 
Dix, New Jersey. He would later be deployed 
to Oakland Army Base in California and as-
signed to the U.S. Army Signal Corp. During 
his deployments, he installed telephone cables 
in the South Pacific, traveling across the world 
to Leyte, Guam, Manila, and Spain, before re-
turning to the United States and receiving an 
honorable discharge on December 22, 1946. 
Theodore spent another three years in the 
Army Reserves. 
Like so many in his generation, Theodore 
faced discrimination when he returned home. 
He applied for work at Virginia Power Electric 
Company but was rejected due to his race. 
Subsequently, he took a seasonal job with 
Phillip Morris Inc. He then spent 20 years as 
a cabinet installer with the Custom Kitchen 
Company. Seeking better pay and benefits, 
Theodore switched careers and became a 
paint mechanic for Richmond Public Schools, 
from which he retired after twenty years of 
service. Soon after he retired, Theodore em-
barked on a new journey as an entrepreneur, 
opening a very successful janitorial and main-
tenance business that he ran for sixteen 
years. 
Faith is a pillar of Theodore’s long life. 
Since being baptized at ten years old, he has 
been active in the church. A talented singer, 
he sang with the Notes of Harmony Quartet 
Group for thirty years. During his time in Rich-
mond, Virginia, Theodore was a member of 
Asbury United Methodist Church, where he 
served as President of the United Methodist 
Men organization, the Chair of the Board of 
Trustees, and a Class Leader. 
In 2016, he and his wife moved to South 
Carolina and joined St. John United Methodist 
Church, where he holds the distinction as fa-
ther of the church. Not only does he sing in 
the church choir; he is also a member of the 
Florence District United Methodist Choir, 
which travels to many churches and nursing 
homes to perform. 
Theodore is the father of nine, and the step-
father of four. He is happily married to his sec-
ond wife, Albertine, and enjoys spending time 
with his extended family. In addition to singing, 
his hobbies include fishing, playing horse-
shoes, card games, reading, and traveling. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my col-
leagues join me in celebrating the ninety-fifth 
birthday of Theodore Roosevelt Brown, Sr. 
Those who know him best describe him as a 
strong, honest, compassionate, and depend-
able man with a great sense of humor and an 
abundance of love for others. May he continue 
to be a blessing to all that are fortunate to 
know and love him. 
HONORING KARISSA SCHWEIZER 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Karissa Schweizer, Cross 
Country Runner and Tokyo Olympian, as our 
Iowan of the Week. 
Schweizer has been excited about the 
Olympics since she was a high school runner 
at 
Dowling 
Catholic 
High 
School. 
The 
Urbandale native had the opportunity to see 
Jenny Simpson, an Iowan and Olympic gold 
medalist, run her victory lap at Drake Univer-
sity’s blue oval. 
Schweizer spent much of her high school 
running career in the shadows of other high 
school athletes. Although Schweizer was tal-
ented, the attention was on the best-known 
runners in Dowling Catholic history, Katie, and 
Betsy Flood. She was only noticed by colleges 
she had reached out to, not by athletic recruit-
ers who were interested in her. 
During a fateful Subway stop, Schweizer 
and her father ran into Coach Brett Halter and 
his Missouri Tigers team. Schweizer’s father, 
Mike, introduced himself to Coach Halter and 
encouraged him to watch his daughter run. 
The Missouri staff watched Schweizer run that 
day and then encouraged her to visit the Uni-
versity of Missouri in Columbia. 
Schweizer quickly became a track star for 
Missouri’s program. During her freshman year, 
she was honored as an SEC Freshman of the 
Year and set records for indoor track for the 
program. She continued to run faster and set 
even more records throughout her college ca-
reer. She won two national titles during her 
time at Missouri and became the first woman 
from Missouri’s program to qualify for the 
Olympics since 1996. Schweizer is the most 
decorated athlete in the school’s history. 
After Schweizers collegiate running career, 
she ran professionally for Bowerman Track 
Club in Portland, Oregon. She set a new 
American record in the indoor 3,000 meter by 
over seven seconds. 
Karissa Schweizer will make her Olympic 
debut in Tokyo on Friday, July 30. She quali-
fied for the 5,000 meter and 10,000 meter 
runs. Karissa’s Iowa roots, come across in the 
way she carries herself, trains, and represents 
our great country and it is my honor to name 
Karissa Schweizer as our Iowan of the Week. 
We are so proud of Karissa. We’ll be cheering 
her on back home.

Cloud Green. During his youth, his father re-
ceived a job as a structural steel engineer that 
brought his family to Virginia. Mr. Green briefly 
attended Roanoke College and V12 Officer 
Candidate School at Hampden Sydney before 
becoming a Quartermaster 3rd Class in the 
United States Navy. He was honorably dis-
charged in 1946. After returning to Salem, Mr. 
Green began working at H.R. Johnson Hard-
ware and stayed for 53 years of service. He 
eventually became an owner and a partner. 
Mr. Green was an active leader in his com-
munity through various forms of service. He 
served as a civil defense coordinator for the 
Town of Salem, a member of the Salem Lions 
Club, an assistant scoutmaster with the Boy 
Scouts, and a Sunday School teacher at the 
First United Methodist Church. He also served 
as Vice Mayor of the City of Salem for 20 
years and chaired the Council Audit Com-
mittee. 
Mr. Green is survived by his wife of 31 
years, Anne Marie Green; his five children, 
Michele Green and her husband Robert Walk-
er, Adrian Green and his wife Kelsey Johnson, 
Emily Green, Michael Green, and Mark Green; 
and two grandchildren, Michael Green, Jr. and 
Angus Green. I offer my condolences on their 
loss.

CANDLELIGHT VIGIL REMARKS BY 
HOUSTON 
HAITIANS 
UNITED 
PRESIDENT SHIRLEY LANEAUT 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. GREEN. of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to include in the RECORD remarks 
by Houston Haitians United President Shirley 
Laneaut presented at a candlelight vigil held 
on Sunday, July 18, 2021 in the Ninth Con-
gressional District of Texas in remembrance of 
Haitian President Jovenel Moise. 
My name is Shirley Laneaut and I am cur-
rently the President of Houston Haitians 
United. First, I would like to thank God for 
orchestrating this momentous event. 
I am a proud first-generation Haitian 
American. Like many of you, my parents 
came to this country with dreams of a better 
life for themselves and their families. Rather 
than posing a threat to our democracy, im-
migrants living in America reinforce and en-
rich the values that make America the coun-
try it is. 
I am so glad to see so many faces who have 
chosen to stand in solidarity with Haiti and 
the Haitian people. Houston Haitians United 
is an organization started for and by the peo-
ple of this community. We welcome all (in-
cluding Haitians themselves and friends of 
Haiti), who are wanting to support our mis-
sion and vision. We aim to work in solidarity 
to uplift our community, promote the cul-
ture and help to prepare Haiti’s future, both 
here and abroad. 
The purpose of this event is to honor our 
Haitian community who are grieving the 
conditions of our country, the horrific death 
of President Jovenel Moise, and lastly, to re-
member our family and friends living in 
Haiti. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. MARSHALL C. 
GRIGSBY CELEBRATING HIS 75TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a longtime friend and 
educator, Dr. Marshall C. Grigsby, who will 
celebrate his 75th birthday on August 18, 
2021. A man, who in his teens wondered if he 
would reach his 25th birthday because of his 
active involvement in civil rights direct action 
during the early 1960s, finally reached an 
unimagined milestone 50 years hence. 
I first met Marshall when he became Presi-
dent of Benedict College in Columbia, SC in 
1985 while I was serving as the head of the 
South Carolina Human Affairs Commission. 
We quickly forged a great working relationship 
and a valued friendship that continues to this 
day. 
Dr. Grigsby has had a phenomenal career 
distinguishing himself as a college professor, 
administrator, and as an advisor to Congress, 
Presidents of the United States and various 
private sector and non-profit educational enti-
ties on educational equity and inclusion. But, 
he did not blaze these trails overnight. He 
began this journey after graduating from More-
house College in 1968 and matriculating at the 
University of Chicago, where he completed the 
Master of Theology and Doctor of Ministry de-
grees in 1972. While in Divinity School, Dr. 
Grigsby served as the Executive Director of 
the Black Legislative Clearing House, an edu-
cational and research organization based in 
Chicago and tasked with serving the Nation’s 
Black state legislators. Some of the elected of-
ficials associated with the Clearing House in-
cluded Harold Washington and Coleman 
Young who would later become the mayors of 
Chicago and Detroit, respectively; Hannah At-
kins who later became Secretary of State for 
Oklahoma; and Mervyn Dymally and George 
Brown who would become the first Black Lieu-
tenant Governors of California and Colorado, 
respectively. 
In 1973, Dr. Grigsby was the youngest and 
first African American appointed to the profes-
sional staff of the Association of Theological 
Schools in the United States and Canada. In 
that position, he was responsible for working 
with 196 member institutions in developing 
programs that more adequately addressed the 
concerns and interests of their minority stu-
dents. 
Dr. Grigsby was invited to join the faculty 
and administration of the Howard University 
Divinity School in 1975, where he served for 
10 years. He taught courses in the content 
area of church, society and fundraising in a 
church context. During his tenure, he reorga-
nized the academic calendar that resulted in a 
significant increase in the school’s enrollment. 
In 1985, at the age of 38, Dr. Grigsby was 
elected the 12th President of Benedict College 
in Columbia, South Carolina. During his eight- 
year tenure, programs were initiated which 
helped the institution achieve national recogni-
tion. He established the first undergraduate 
environmental health science program in the 
Southeast and established the first college 
wide honors program. In 1991, Benedict was 
one of five small liberal arts colleges selected 
nationwide as a recipient of the Knight Foun-
dation Presidential Leadership Award. The 
Award was designed to recognize creative and 
innovative presidential leadership at small lib-
eral arts colleges throughout America. 
During his tenure at Benedict, Dr. Grigsby 
served as chair of the South Carolina Tuition 
Grants Program, the Board of the South Caro-
lina Student Loan Corporation, the South 
Carolina Educational Television Endowment 
Board and the South Carolina Humanities 
Council. He was instrumental in having the 
South Carolina Humanities Council housed on 
the Benedict College campus. 
In 1994, Dr. Grigsby joined the staff of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce of 
the U.S. House of Representatives as the 
Senior Legislative Associate for Higher Edu-
cation. In that position, he provided oversight, 
advice and counsel to Members on issues in-
volving distance learning, vocational rehabilita-
tion, affirmative action, and the Corporation for 
National and Community Service and Federal 
Impact Aid. Furthermore, he served as the 
lead Democratic staff member on the reau-
thorization of the Higher Education Act 
amendments of 1998 that included strength-
ening Title III and IV as well as creating Title 
V (aid to Hispanic Serving Institutions), and 
the GEAR-UP Program. 
After serving eight years on Capitol Hill, Dr. 
Grigsby left in 2001 to establish Grigsby and 
Associates, LLC, an educational, legislative 
and policy development consulting firm spe-
cializing in educational policy issues, strategic 
planning and the Federal legislative and regu-
latory processes. 
Dr. Grigsby has served as a senior consult-
ant with the Council for Opportunity in Edu-
cation, the umbrella organization for the na-
tion’s federal TRIO programs, and as a senior 
scholar with the Claiborne Pell Institute for the 
Study of Opportunity in Education. In addition, 
he drafted the 2001–2003 Annual Report of 
the President’s Board of Advisors on Histori-
cally Black Colleges and Universities pursuant 
to Executive Order 13256. The report, ‘‘The 
Mission Continues’’, outlines federal support 
for Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities. 
Madam Speaker, I invite you and my col-
leagues to join me in commending this distin-
guished theologian, educator, and academi-
cian. As he celebrates this milestone birthday, 
please join me in extending to him a hearty 
and heartfelt 75th year and our very best 
wishes in all of his future endeavors.

HONORING FAMILY-FRIENDLY 
WORKPLACES ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 30, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as our nation 
strives to build back better, we must make 
sure that women—especially moms—are not 
left out of any recovery efforts. Since the pan-
demic, two million women—including one mil-
lion moms—left the workforce. 
We know that women—especially women of 
color—always fought an uphill battle against 
gender norms and racial and gender pay eq-
uity—and like so many other issues, the pan-
demic only exacerbated these existing injus-
tices and inequalities. The pandemic also laid

bare that the status quo is no longer accept-
able; we need transformational structural 
changes to ensure women are protected 
against any future economic calamities. 
After all, women’s economic security and 
their families’ financial stability are inextricably 
linked. That is why I introduced this week, the 
Honoring Family-Friendly Workplaces Act—to 
promote a healthier work-life balance for hard-
working families across the country, We must 
do more to promote positive work environ-
ments so that working parents are able to re-
turn to the labor force as soon as possible. 
My bill would direct the Department of Labor 
to establish a national certification program 
that recognizes exemplary family-friendly busi-
ness 
policies. 
It 
would 
recognize 
and 
incentivize employers who commit to helping 
employees balance their family obligations and 
work responsibilities. 
The certification program is intended to be 
similar to the EPA’s ENERGY STAR program 
that helps consumers identify energy efficient 
products, and would evaluate businesses on a 
number of policies, including: 
Paid sick days for workers; 
Child care subsidies; 
Lactation support; 
Reasonable accommodations for pregnant 
workers; 
Assistance paying for or referring workers to 
fertility adoption services; 
Paid family leave of at least 12 weeks per 
year; and 
Flexible hours—or remote work policies— 
once parents return to work after a birth, 
adoption, or foster care placement. 
Madam Speaker, nobody should have to 
choose between their work or their family; no-
body should have to choose between receiv-
ing a paycheck or caring for their family. 
By redesigning and investing in the work-
place to be family-friendly, we are ultimately 
strengthening the wellbeing of children and 
families, businesses, and the economy. I urge 
all my colleagues in supporting this common-
sense initiative to improve the lives of working 
families across America.
