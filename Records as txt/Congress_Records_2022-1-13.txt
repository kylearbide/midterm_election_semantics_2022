PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy and omnipotent God, we stand 
before You, vulnerable to Your power 
at work within and around us. Like 
precious metal, we are being forged, 
tested like silver, formed by Your cre-
ative hands. 
In these moments, may we trust that 
You are refining us, restoring us, and 
shaping us that we would best reflect 
Your image in all we do. 
We also stand before this Nation, ex-
posed to a multitude of opinions and a 
host of challenges, bearing the respon-
sibilities that have been placed in our 
care. 
Many voices attempt to drown out 
Your own divine word that has called 
us to hold fast to our faith in Your per-
fect righteousness. 
In these moments, may we stand firm 
in our obedience to You, to Your claim 
on our lives. 
May the trials in our lives and the 
testing of our faith produce steadfast-
ness in our walk with You. 
In Your abiding name we pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

f 
CELEBRATING KOREAN-AMERICAN 
DAY 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate Korean-Amer-
ican Day, which marks the arrival of 
the first group of Korean immigrants 
to the United States in 1903. 
I am proud to represent tens of thou-
sands of Korean Americans in Geor-
gia’s Seventh District. These individ-
uals are critical members of our com-
munity. From small business owners to 
healthcare workers, they continue to 
support us throughout the pandemic. 
I would like to take this time to ac-
knowledge Korean-American leaders in 
my district. Representative Sam Park 
is the grandson of refugees from the 
Korean war who became the first Asian 
American and openly gay person elect-
ed to the Georgia State House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Michelle Kang serves as president of 
the Korean-American Public Action 
Committee and is a tireless leader in 
the community. It is an honor to work 
with each of you. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we have been challenged with 
an increase in the number of anti- 
Asian hate crimes. This Korean-Amer-
ican Day, I am particularly grateful to 
all of those working to address and end 
anti-Asian hate in Georgia and across 
the country. I look forward to con-
tinuing this work in Congress. 
f 
EACH VOTE IS IMPORTANT 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on an 
issue that is important for every Amer-
ican. I know the importance of each 
vote and understand the difference one 
vote or six can make. Our country was 
founded on the right to vote in fair and 
free elections and faith in the election 
systems that conduct those elections. 
Since Iowa implemented new voting 
laws in 2017, our elections have seen 
record turnout and participation. 
Right now, the majority is pushing a 
Federal takeover of elections, over-
riding laws in States like Iowa. 
The proposed legislation would limit 
voter ID laws, which are supported by 
the overwhelming majority of Ameri-
cans. It would also allow politicians to 
use taxpayer dollars to run political 
ads; meaning your money could go to 
candidates and issues you do not sup-
port. 
Finally, it would implement a ‘‘one- 
size-fits-all’’ set of regulations instead

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

January 13, 2022 
of allowing individual States to estab-
lish laws that work for them as pro-
vided in our Constitution. 
Voters in each congressional district 
across the country are best informed to 
choose their congressional representa-
tion. They do not need interference 
from Washington, D.C. 
We should be working to pass bipar-
tisan and commonsense voting laws, 
not pushing a partisan agenda and 
playing political games. Let’s make 
sure that everyone can vote and that 
every vote counts. 
f 
IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to call attention to an 
urgent problem facing my district. 
Each and every one of these dots rep-
resents children with elevated toxic 
levels of lead in their blood. The red 
dots represent the higher levels, the 
yellow dots, obviously, the lower lev-
els. You could almost draw my district 
if you follow the red dots. 
The fact is, Madam Speaker, that 
many of these kids are being poisoned 
by lead in their homes and, yes, even in 
their schools. This is a problem that 
disproportionately affects Latinos in 
our community. 
We need action to replace these lead 
pipes and ensure our kids have clean, 
safe water, no matter where they live. 
That is why I am proud of our work in 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act. This law will bring $2.9 billion to 
replace lead pipes in Texas schools. 
While we have more work to do, our 
work in this Chamber is a critical first 
step to improving our infrastructure 
and protecting our children. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CLARENCE MORGAN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Clarence Morgan the longtime coun-
ty recreation director for Effingham 
County. 
Clarence started with the department 
in 1980 and worked until he was pro-
moted to director in 2001. His passion 
for health and wellness, including pro-
moting an active lifestyle for commu-
nity members, culminated in his devel-
opment 
of 
the 
Effingham 
County 
Recreation Department. 
With limited resources and hard 
work, Clarence managed to grow the 
program into one of the top programs 
in the State. In 2020, the brand new, 
state-of-the-art gym was opened and 
named in his honor. 
Known by all for his integrity and 
great strength of character, Clarence 
dedicated his life to ensuring a bright-
er, healthier future for Effingham 
County residents. The department that 
he re-ignited is a testament to his life’s 
work. Our State and our community 
will forever remember the life and leg-
acy of Clarence Morgan. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family and his friends as we mourn the 
loss of this great Georgian. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MARTA MACIAS BROWN 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
remember 
Marta 
Macias 
Brown, a longtime public servant, com-
munity leader, and beloved constituent 
of mine. 
I had the privilege of knowing Marta 
way before I took office and started 
representing a portion of Marta’s late 
husband’s district, the former Con-
gressman George E. Brown, Jr., whose 
portrait hangs as a former chairman in 
the Science Committee room. 
Marta dedicated her career to advo-
cating 
for 
social 
justice, 
women’s 
rights, and high-quality education for 
students. She used her voice to elimi-
nate barriers and create spaces for 
marginalized groups. 
She was a proud Latina. She co- 
founded one of the first Spanish publi-
cations in the Inland Empire called El 
Chicano, to share important news with 
our community. 
Marta spent her life uplifting and 
empowering others, and anyone who 
knew her or knew of her could easily 
speak to the love that she had for her 
community and the commitment she 
embodied for equality. 
To the Macias Brown family and all 
those who knew, loved, and respected 
her, I offer my deepest condolences. 
Marta’s legacy will always be cher-
ished. 
f 
HONORING 77 KENTUCKIANS WHO 
LOST THEIR LIVES TO HORRIFIC 
TORNADOES IN DECEMBER 2021 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the 77 Kentuckians 
who lost their lives to the horrific tor-
nadoes that devastated our Common-
wealth this December. May we con-
tinue to lift up all of those who were 
affected by these storms and support 
the rebuilding of homes, businesses, 
and livelihoods. 
We lost 17 Kentuckians in my dis-
trict, all in my home county of Warren 
County. We must ensure their memo-
ries are never forgotten, and I ask that 
Americans keep these families and 
these names in their prayers: Alisa 
Besic, 
Alma 
Besic, 
Elma 
Besic, 
Samantha Besic, Selmir Besic, Nariah 
Brown, Nolynn Brown, Nyles Brown, 
Nyssa Brown, Rachel Brown, Steven 
Brown, Terry Jayne, Say Meh, Cory 
Scott, Victoria Smith, Mae White, and 
Robert Williams, Jr. 
May they rest in peace. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF SENATOR HARRY REID 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor a great son of Nevada, 
Senator Harry Mason Reid. 
Senator Reid was raised in a home 
with dirt floors in Searchlight, Nevada. 
And even as he rose to the highest lev-
els of power, including this Chamber, 
he never forgot his small-town roots. 
In the Senate, he fought for all of us. 
He championed the DREAM Act and 
brought young Dreamers to Capitol 
Hill. He fought against Yucca Moun-
tain. And because of his work to pass 
the Affordable Care Act, 31 million 
Americans have healthcare today. 
Most people don’t know this, but 
long before he was a Senator, he paid 
his way through law school by serving 
with the U.S. Capitol Police. He pro-
tected this Capitol, and he defended 
our democracy. 
Senator Reid, thank you for your 
lifetime of service. May you rest in 
peace. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WAYNE 
CALVIN SMITH 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, I 
was raised with one brother. But I 
truly felt like I had dozens and dozens 
of siblings. You see, my cousins and I 
grew up a little differently than most 
families. We had a patriarch of our 
family who made sure that multiple 
times a year we all got together for a 
big hoorah. Fourth of July, kids’ week, 
Christmas, many of my favorite memo-
ries in my entire life stem from the 
times we all gathered at the mountain 
house. Wayne Smith, my great uncle, 
taught us, the way to be truly wealthy 
was to have a strong family. 
Pappaw passed away on January 10. 
He was about to celebrate 63 years of 
marriage. He was able to touch people’s 
souls with the way he talked. He would 
skip classes in high school so that he 
could work, yet still managed to be one 
of the wisest men I have ever known. 
He taught all of his grandsons how to 
drive a stick shift in a pickup truck he 
had since 1993. He made a bet with his 
son to quit smoking and held up his 
end of the bargain for 43 years. 
He was the original grill master in 
our family. He drank his coffee black 
or didn’t drink it at all. 
I am very proud to say that he got to 
see the Braves win the World Series 
last season.

Pappaw, we all love you so much. 
Thank you for imparting so much wis-

ing sure we all grew up with endless 
cousins who are truly brothers and sis-
ters now. 
Go Braves, and rest in peace, Wayne

HONORING THE WORK OF ALFRED 
H. KURLAND 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the work of Al 
Kurland, who has dedicated nearly 
three decades to supporting youth and 
families throughout the 13th Congres-
sional District. 
From his early efforts and grassroots 
engagement in Washington Heights, 
Al’s work has inspired countless youth 
advocates, social justice activists, and 
civic mentors across the city of New 
York. 
Al has long championed ensuring 
marginalized youth have a voice and 
are empowered to thrive, and I am 
proud to recognize his contributions 
today. 
His latest essay, ‘‘The Soul of Adoles-
cence Aligns with the Heart of Democ-
racy,’’ follows his journey of discov-
ering his life’s purpose and his under-
standing of adolescent potential and 
wisdom. 
His candor and vulnerability have led 
to countless young people finding their 
full potential through community in-
volvement, strengthening our commu-
nity. 
Al Kurland has significantly contrib-
uted to our community. For that, we 
are thankful. 
I commend him for his unwavering 
dedication to all who call our city 
home and applaud his tireless efforts to 
make our community stronger for the 
next generation of civic leaders.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE GRAND OPEN-
ING OF GILLEY’S 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, on March 29, 1971, in Pasadena, 
Texas, Mickey Gilley opened a honky-
tonk bearing his name and changed the 
world 
of 
country 
music 
forever. 
Gilley’s reputation grew so much that 
Hollywood took notice with the hit 
movie ‘‘Urban Cowboy,’’ filmed in and 
around the Pasadena location. Man, 
was it a hit. 
Inspired by the real-life romance of a 
pair of the club’s patrons, ‘‘Urban Cow-
boy’’ put Gilley’s on the map, revived 
music careers, and launched others. It 
introduced two-stepping to a whole 
new audience and created a lifestyle 
which has been adopted by millions. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
40 
years 
later, 
America’s love of Wrangler jeans, cow-
boy boots, and pickup trucks under-
scores that lasting cultural legacy. 
Although 
the 
club 
is 
no 
more, 
Gilley’s is certainly not forgotten. Its 
memory lives on decades later through 
music and film, of course, but even, 
more importantly, through the lives 
and loves of those who frequented 
Gilley’s. And you always knew when 
someone had been to Gilley’s because 
they had the bumper sticker to prove 
it. 
Thank you to Mickey Gilley for in-
troducing our way of life to the world. 
Thank you to the Galveston Chamber 
of Commerce—at 177 years young, 
Texas’ oldest chamber of commerce— 
for honoring the 50th anniversary of 
our great southeast Texas true country 
club and Mr. Mickey Gilley.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL 
AUTHORITY. 
Congress finds that the Constitution of the 
United States grants explicit and broad author-
ity to protect the right to vote, to regulate elec-
tions for Federal office, to prevent and remedy 
discrimination in voting, and to defend the Na-
tion’s democratic process. Congress enacts the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act pursuant to 
this broad authority, including but not limited 
to the following: 
(1) Congress finds that it has broad authority 
to regulate the time, place, and manner of con-
gressional elections under the Elections Clause 
of the Constitution, article I, section 4, clause 1. 
The Supreme Court has affirmed that the ‘‘sub-
stantive scope’’ of the Elections Clause is 
‘‘broad’’; that ‘‘Times, Places, and Manner’’ are 
‘‘comprehensive words which embrace authority 
to provide for a complete code for congressional 
elections’’; and ‘‘[t]he power of Congress over 
the Times, Places and Manner of congressional 
elections is paramount, and may be exercised at 
any time, and to any extent which it deems ex-
pedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no far-
ther, the regulations effected supersede those of 
the State which are inconsistent therewith’’. Ar-
izona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 
U.S. 1, 8–9 (2013) (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted). Indeed, ‘‘Congress has ple-
nary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole 
subject’’ of congressional elections, Ex parte 
Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 371, 388 (1879), and 
this power ‘‘may be exercised as and when Con-
gress sees fit’’, and ‘‘so far as it extends and 
conflicts with the regulations of the State, nec-
essarily supersedes them’’. Id. at 384. Among 
other things, Congress finds that the Elections 
Clause was intended to ‘‘vindicate the people’s 
right to equality of representation in the 
House’’. Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 16 
(1964), and to address partisan gerrymandering, 
Rucho v. Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019). 
(2) Congress also finds that it has both the au-
thority and responsibility, as the legislative 
body for the United States, to fulfill the promise 
of article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, 
which states: ‘‘The United States shall guar-
antee to every State in this Union a Republican 
Form of Government[.]’’. Congress finds that its 
authority and responsibility to enforce the 
Guarantee Clause is clear given that Federal 
courts have not enforced this clause because 
they understood that its enforcement is com-
mitted to Congress by the Constitution. 
(3)(A) Congress also finds that it has broad 
authority pursuant to section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment to legislate to enforce the 
provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, in-
cluding its protections of the right to vote and 
the democratic process. 
(B) Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment 
protects the fundamental right to vote, which is 
‘‘of the most fundamental significance under 
our constitutional structure’’. Ill. Bd. of Elec-
tion v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 
(1979); see United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 
(1941) (‘‘Obviously included within the right to 
choose, secured by the Constitution, is the right 
of qualified voters within a State to cast their 
ballots and have them counted . . .’’). As the Su-
preme Court has repeatedly affirmed, the right 
to vote is ‘‘preservative of all rights’’, Yick Wo 
v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). Section 2 of 
the Fourteenth Amendment also protects the 
right to vote, granting Congress additional au-
thority to reduce a State’s representation in 
Congress when the right to vote is abridged or 
denied. 
(C) As a result, Congress finds that it has the 
authority pursuant to section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment to protect the right to vote. 
Congress also finds that States and localities 
have eroded access to the right to vote through 
restrictions on the right to vote including exces-
sively onerous voter identification requirements, 
burdensome voter registration procedures, voter 
purges, limited and unequal access to voting by 
mail, polling place closures, unequal distribu-
tion of election resources, and other impedi-
ments. 
(D) Congress also finds that ‘‘the right of suf-
frage can be denied by a debasement or dilution 
of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effec-
tively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise 
of the franchise’’. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 
533, 555 (1964). Congress finds that the right of 
suffrage has been so diluted and debased by 
means of gerrymandering of districts. Congress 
finds that it has authority pursuant to section 
5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to remedy this 
debasement. 
(4)(A) Congress also finds that it has author-
ity to legislate to eliminate racial discrimination 
in voting and the democratic process pursuant 
to both section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, 
which grants equal protection of the laws, and 
section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which ex-
plicitly bars denial or abridgment of the right to 
vote on account of race, color, or previous con-
dition of servitude. 
(B) Congress finds that racial discrimination 
in access to voting and the political process per-
sists. Voting restrictions, redistricting, and other 
electoral practices and processes continue to dis-
proportionately impact communities of color in 
the United States and do so as a result of both 
intentional racial discrimination, structural rac-
ism, and the ongoing structural socioeconomic 
effects of historical racial discrimination. 
(C) Recent elections and studies have shown 
that minority communities wait longer in lines 
to vote, are more likely to have their mail ballots 
rejected, continue to face intimidation at the 
polls, are more likely to be disenfranchised by 
voter purges, and are disproportionately bur-
dened by excessively onerous voter identification 
and other voter restrictions. Research shows 
that communities of color are more likely to face 
nearly every barrier to voting than their white 
counterparts. 
(D) Congress finds that racial disparities in 
disenfranchisement due to past felony convic-
tions is particularly stark. In 2020, according to 
the Sentencing Project, an estimated 5,200,000 
Americans could not vote due to a felony con-
viction. One in 16 African Americans of voting 
age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.7 times greater 
than that of non-African Americans. In seven 
States—Alabama, 
Florida, 
Kentucky, 
Mis-
sissippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming— 
more than one in seven African Americans is 
disenfranchised, twice the national average for 
African Americans. Congress finds that felony 
disenfranchisement was one of the tools of in-
tentional racial discrimination during the Jim 
Crow era. Congress further finds that current 
racial disparities in felony disenfranchisement 
are linked to this history of voter suppression, 
structural racism in the criminal justice system, 
and ongoing effects of historical discrimination. 
(5)(A) Congress finds that it further has the 
power to protect the right to vote from denial or 
abridgment on account of sex, age, or ability to 
pay a poll tax or other tax pursuant to the 
Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth 
Amendments. 
(B) Congress finds that electoral practices in-
cluding voting rights restoration conditions for 
people with convictions and other restrictions to 
the franchise burden voters on account of their 
ability to pay. 
(C) Congress further finds that electoral prac-
tices including voting restrictions related to col-
lege campuses, age restrictions on mail voting, 
and similar practices burden the right to vote on 
account of age. 
SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—For any action brought for 
declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge, 
whether facially or as-applied, the constitu-
tionality or lawfulness of any provision of this 
Act or any amendment made by this Act or any 
rule or regulation promulgated under this Act, 
the following rules shall apply: 
(1) The action shall be filed in the United 
States District Court for the District of Colum-
bia and an appeal from the decision of the dis-
trict court may be taken to the Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit. These 
courts, and the Supreme Court of the United 
States on a writ of certiorari (if such writ is 
issued), shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear 
such actions. 
(2) The party filing the action shall concur-
rently deliver a copy the complaint to the Clerk 
of the House of Representatives and the Sec-
retary of the Senate. 
(3) It shall be the duty of the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia and 
the Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-
bia Circuit to advance on the docket and to ex-
pedite to the greatest possible extent the disposi-
tion of the action and appeal. 
(b) CLARIFYING SCOPE OF JURISDICTION.—If an 
action at the time of its commencement is not 
subject to subsection (a), but an amendment, 
counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense, 
or any other pleading or motion is filed chal-
lenging, whether facially or as-applied, the con-
stitutionality or lawfulness of this Act or any 
amendment made by this Act or any rule or reg-
ulation promulgated under this Act, the district 
court shall transfer the action to the District 
Court for the District of Columbia, and the ac-
tion shall thereafter be conducted pursuant to 
subsection (a). 
(c) INTERVENTION
BY
MEMBERS
OF
CON-
GRESS.—In any action described in subsection 
(a), any Member of the House of Representatives 
(including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner 
to the Congress) or Senate shall have the right 
to intervene either in support of or opposition to 
the position of a party to the case regarding the 
constitutionality of the provision. To avoid du-
plication of efforts and reduce the burdens 
placed on the parties to the action, the court in 
any such action may make such orders as it 
considers necessary, including orders to require 
interveners taking similar positions to file joint 
papers or to be represented by a single attorney 
at oral argument. 
SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. 
If any provision of this Act or any amendment 
made by this Act, or the application of any such 
provision or amendment to any person or cir-

ed by inserting after section 5 the following new 
section: 
‘‘SEC. 5A. AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION BY STATE 
MOTOR VEHICLE AUTHORITY. 
‘‘(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section—

‘‘(3) AUTOMATIC
REGISTRATION.—The term 
‘automatic registration’ means a system that 
registers an individual to vote and updates ex-
isting registrations, in elections for Federal of-
fice in a State, if eligible, by electronically 
transferring the information necessary for reg-
istration from the applicable agency to election 
officials of the State so that, unless the indi-
vidual affirmatively declines to be registered or 
to update any voter registration, the individual 
will be registered to vote in such elections. 
‘‘(4) ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL.—The term ‘eligible 
individual’ means, with respect to an election 
for Federal office, an individual who is other-
wise qualified to vote in that election. 
‘‘(5) REGISTER TO VOTE.—The term ‘register to 
vote’ includes updating an individual’s existing 
voter registration. 
‘‘(b) ESTABLISHMENT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The chief State election of-
ficial of each State shall establish and operate a 
system of automatic registration for the registra-
tion of eligible individuals to vote for elections 
for Federal office in the State, in accordance 
with the provisions of this section. 
‘‘(2) REGISTRATION OF VOTERS BASED ON NEW 
AGENCY RECORDS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The chief State election of-
ficial shall— 
‘‘(i) subject to subparagraph (B), ensure that 
each eligible individual who completes an appli-
cable transaction and does not decline to reg-
ister to vote is registered to vote— 
‘‘(I) in the next upcoming election for Federal 
office (and subsequent elections for Federal of-
fice), if an applicable agency transmits informa-
tion under subsection (c)(1)(E) with respect to 
the individual not later than the applicable 
date; and 
‘‘(II) in subsequent elections for Federal of-
fice, if an applicable agency transmits such in-
formation with respect to such individual after 
the applicable date; and 
‘‘(ii) not later than 60 days after the receipt of 
such information with respect to an individual, 
send written notice to the individual, in addi-
tion to other means of notice established by this 
part, of the individual’s voter registration sta-
tus. 
‘‘(B) APPLICABLE DATE.—For purposes of this 
subsection, the term ‘‘applicable date’’ means,

‘‘(i) the date that is 28 days before the date of 
the election; or 
‘‘(ii) the last day of the period provided by 
State law for registration with respect to such 
election. 
‘‘(C) CLARIFICATION.—Nothing in this sub-
section shall prevent the chief State election of-
ficial from registering an eligible individual to 
vote for the next upcoming election for Federal 
office in the State even if an applicable agency 
transmits information under subsection (c)(1)(E) 
with respect to the individual after the applica-
ble date. 
‘‘(3) TREATMENT
OF
INDIVIDUALS
UNDER
18 
YEARS OF AGE.—A State may not refuse to treat

poses of this section on the grounds that the in-
dividual is less than 18 years of age at the time 
an applicable agency receives information with 
respect to the individual, so long as the indi-
vidual is at least 16 years of age at such time. 
Nothing in the previous sentence may be con-
strued to require a State to permit an individual 
who is under 18 years of age at the time of an 
election for Federal office to vote in the election. 
‘‘(c) APPLICABLE AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES.—

tion for service or assistance or enrollment), the 
applicable agency shall inform each such indi-
vidual who is a citizen of the United States of

vidual does not meet all those qualifications. 
‘‘(iii) In the case of a State in which affili-
ation or enrollment with a political party is re-
quired in order to participate in an election to 
select the party’s candidate in an election for 
Federal office, the requirement that the indi-
vidual must affiliate or enroll with a political 
party in order to participate in such an election. 
‘‘(iv) Voter registration is voluntary, and nei-
ther registering nor declining to register to vote 
will in any way affect the availability of serv-
ices or benefits, nor be used for other purposes. 
‘‘(B) INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PRO-
FICIENCY.—In the case where the individual is a 
member of a group that constitutes 3 percent or 
more of the overall population within the State 
served by the applicable agency as measured by

paragraph (A). 
‘‘(D) OPPORTUNITY TO DECLINE REGISTRATION 
REQUIRED.—Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, each applicable agency shall ensure 
that each applicable transaction described in

to vote. In the case where the individual is a 
member of a group that constitutes 3 percent or 
more of the overall population within the State 
served by the applicable agency as measured by 
the United States Census and are limited 
English proficient, such opportunity shall be 
given in a language understood by the indi-
vidual. 
‘‘(E) INFORMATION
TRANSMITTAL.—Not later 
than 10 days after an applicable transaction 
with an eligible individual, if the individual did 
not decline to be registered to vote, the applica-
ble agency shall electronically transmit to the 
appropriate State election official the following 
information with respect to the individual: 
‘‘(i) The individual’s given name(s) and sur-

‘‘(ii) The individual’s date of birth. 
‘‘(iii) The individual’s residential address. 
‘‘(iv) Information showing that the individual 
is a citizen of the United States. 
‘‘(v) The date on which information per-
taining to that individual was collected or last

‘‘(vii) In the case of a State in which affili-
ation or enrollment with a political party is re-
quired in order to participate in an election to

PARTICIPATION IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS.—In the 
case of a State in which affiliation or enroll-
ment with a political party is required in order 
to participate in an election to select the party’s 
candidate in an election for Federal office, if

on any of the following grounds: 
(1) The individual notified an election office 
of the individual’s automatic registration to 
vote.

Registration Act of 1993) of any individual or 
the fact that an individual declined the oppor-
tunity to register to vote or did not make an af-
firmation of citizenship (including through 
automatic registration) may not be used as evi-
dence against that individual in any State or 
Federal law enforcement proceeding or any civil 
adjudication concerning immigration status or 
naturalization, and an individual’s lack of 
knowledge or willfulness of such registration 
may be demonstrated by the individual’s testi-
mony alone. 
(c) PROTECTION
OF
ELECTION
INTEGRITY.— 
Nothing in subsections (a) or (b) may be con-
strued to prohibit or restrict any action under 
color of law against an individual who— 
(1) knowingly and willfully makes a false 
statement to effectuate or perpetuate automatic 
voter registration by any individual; or 
(2) casts a ballot knowingly and willfully in 
violation of State law or the laws of the United

is ineligible under State law to vote in an elec-
tion, or to deem a record to be a duplicate or 
outdated; 
(B) ensure that the standards developed pur-
suant to this paragraph are uniform and non-
discriminatory and are applied in a uniform and 
nondiscriminatory manner; 
(C) not later than 45 days after the deadline

Subtitle H—Democracy Restoration 
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy 
Restoration Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to 
vote reintegrates individuals with criminal con-
victions into free society, helping to enhance 
public safety. 
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution 
grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over 
Federal elections, an authority which has re-
peatedly been upheld by the United States Su-
preme Court. 
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
and equal protection require an equal oppor-
tunity for citizens of the United States to vote in 
Federal elections. The right to vote may not be 
abridged or denied by the United States or by 
any State on account of race, color, gender, or 
previous condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 
15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments to the 
Constitution empower Congress to enact meas-
ures to protect the right to vote in Federal elec-
tions. The 8th Amendment to the Constitution 
provides for no excessive bail to be required, nor 
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual 
punishments inflicted. 
(4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in 
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead 
to unfairness in Federal elections— 
(A) the lack of a uniform standard for voting 
in Federal elections leads to an unfair disparity 
and unequal participation in Federal elections 
based solely on where a person lives; 
(B) laws governing the restoration of voting 
rights after a criminal conviction vary through-
out the country and persons in some States can 
easily regain their voting rights while in other 
States persons effectively lose their right to vote 
permanently; and 
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. 
(5) State disenfranchisement laws vary wide-
ly. Two States (Maine and Vermont) and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not disenfran-
chise individuals with criminal convictions at 
all. In 2020, the District of Columbia re-enfran-
chised its citizens who are under the supervision 
of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Twenty-eight 
states disenfranchise certain individuals on fel-
ony probation or parole. In 11 States, a convic-
tion for certain offenses can result in lifetime 
disenfranchisement. 
(6) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
(7) In 2020, an estimated 5,200,000 citizens of 
the United States, or about 1 in 44 adults in the 
United States, could not vote as a result of a fel-
ony conviction. Of the 5,200,000 citizens barred 
from voting then, only 24 percent were in pris-
on. 
By 
contrast, 
75 
percent 
of 
persons 
disenfranchised then resided in their commu-
nities while on probation or parole or after hav-
ing completed their sentences. Approximately 
2,200,000 citizens who had completed their sen-
tences were disenfranchised due to restrictive 
State laws. As of November 2018, the lifetime 
ban for persons with certain felony convictions 
was eliminated through a Florida ballot initia-
tive. As a result, as many as 1,400,000 people are 
now eligible to have their voting rights restored. 
In 4 States—Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and 
Tennessee—more than 7 percent of the total 
population is disenfranchised. 
(8) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be re-
gained in theory, but in practice this possibility 
is often granted in a non-uniform and poten-
tially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised 
individuals sometimes must either obtain a par-
don or an order from the Governor or an action 
by the parole or pardon board, depending on the 
offense and State. Individuals convicted of a 
Federal offense often have additional barriers to 
regaining voting rights. 
(9) Many felony disenfranchisement laws 
today derive directly from post-Civil War efforts 
to stifle the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend-
ments. Between 1865 and 1880, at least 14 
states—Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, 
Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Ne-
braska, New York, North Carolina, South Caro-
lina, Tennessee, and Texas—enacted or ex-
panded their felony disenfranchisement laws. 
One of the primary goals of these laws was to 
prevent African Americans from voting. Of the 
states that enacted or expanded their felony dis-
enfranchisement laws during this post-Civil War 
period, at least 11 continue to preclude persons 
on felony probation or parole from voting. 
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. In 
recent years, African Americans have been im-
prisoned at over 5 times the rate of Whites. More 
than 6 percent of the voting-age African-Amer-
ican population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, 
are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. 
In 9 States—Alabama (16 percent), Arizona (13 
percent), Florida (15 percent), Kentucky (15 per-
cent), Mississippi (16 percent), South Dakota (14 
percent), Tennessee (21 percent), Virginia (16 
percent), and Wyoming (36 percent)—more than 
1 in 8 African Americans are unable to vote be-
cause of a felony conviction, twice the national 
average for African Americans. 
(11) Latino citizens are also disproportionately 
disenfranchised based upon their dispropor-
tionate representation in the criminal justice 
system. In recent years, Latinos have been im-
prisoned at 2.5 times the rate of Whites. More 
than 2 percent of the voting-age Latino popu-
lation, or 560,000 Latinos, are disenfranchised 
due to a felony conviction. In 34 states Latinos 
are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the 
general population. In 11 states 4 percent or 
more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due 
to a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Ari-
zona, 7 percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 
percent; Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; 
Minnesota, 4 percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Ne-
braska, 6 percent; Tennessee, 11 percent; Wyo-
ming, 4 percent), twice the national average for 
Latinos. 
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
convicted of a criminal offense and who are liv-
ing and working in the community serves no 
compelling State interest and hinders their reha-
bilitation and reintegration into society. 
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
press electoral participation among eligible vot-
ers by discouraging voting among family and 
community members of disenfranchised persons. 
Future electoral participation by the children of 
disenfranchised parents may be impacted as 
well. Models of successful re-entry for persons 
convicted of a crime emphasize the importance 
of community ties, feeling vested and integrated, 
and prosocial attitudes. Individuals with crimi-
nal convictions who succeed in avoiding recidi-
vism are typically more likely to see themselves 
as law-abiding members of the community. Res-
toration of voting rights builds those qualities 
and facilitates reintegration into the commu-
nity. That is why allowing citizens with crimi-
nal convictions who are living in a community 
to vote is correlated with a lower likelihood of 
recidivism. Restoration of voting rights thus re-
duces violence and protects public safety. 
(14) The United States is one of the only West-
ern democracies that permits the permanent de-
nial of voting rights for individuals with felony 
convictions. 
(15) The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on 
cruel and unusual punishments ‘‘guarantees in-
dividuals the right not to be subjected to exces-
sive sanctions.’’ (Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 
551, 560 (2005)). That right stems from the basic 
precept of justice ‘‘that punishment for crime 
should be graduated and proportioned to [the]

offense.’’ Id. (quoting Weems v. United States, 
217 U.S. 349, 367 (1910)). As the Supreme Court 
has long recognized, ‘‘[t]he concept of propor-
tionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.’’ 
(Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 59 (2010)). 
Many State disenfranchisement laws are grossly 
disproportional to the offenses that lead to dis-
enfranchisement and thus violate the bar on 
cruel and unusual punishments. For example, a 
number of states mandate lifetime disenfran-
chisement for a single felony conviction or just 
two felony convictions, even where the convic-
tions were for non-violent offenses. In numerous 
other States, disenfranchisement can last years 
or even decades while individuals remain on 
probation or parole, often only because a person 
cannot pay their legal financial obligations. 
These kinds of extreme voting bans run afoul of 
the Eighth Amendment. 
(16) The Twenty-Fourth Amendment provides 
that the right to vote ‘‘shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or any State by 
reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other 
tax.’’. Section 2 of the Twenty-Fourth Amend-
ment gives Congress the power to enforce this 
article by appropriate legislation. Court fines 
and fees that individuals must pay to have their 
voting rights restored constitute an ‘‘other tax’’ 
for purposes of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. 
At least five States explicitly require the pay-
ment of fines and fees before individuals with 
felony convictions can have their voting rights 
restored. More than 20 other states effectively 
tie the right to vote to the payment of fines and 
fees, by requiring that individuals complete 
their probation or parole before their rights are 
restored. In these States, the non-payment of 
fines and fees is a basis on which probation or 
parole can be extended. Moreover, these states 
sometimes do not record the basis on which an 
individual’s probation or parole was extended, 
making it impossible to determine from the 
State’s records whether non-payment of fines 
and fees is the reason that an individual re-
mains on probation or parole. For these reasons, 
the only way to ensure that States do not deny 
the right to vote based solely on non-payment of 
fines and fees is to prevent States from condi-
tioning voting rights on the completion of pro-
bation or parole. 
SEC. 1703. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. 
The right of an individual who is a citizen of 
the United States to vote in any election for 
Federal office shall not be denied or abridged

tion or facility at the time of the election.

gible under State law to vote in the election un-
less— 
‘‘(i) the official determines that the signature 
on such statement matches the signature of such 
individual on the official list of registered voters 
in the State or other official record or document 
used by the State to verify the signatures of vot-
ers; or 
‘‘(ii) not later than 10 days after casting the 
provisional ballot, the individual presents an 
applicable identifying document, either in per-
son or by electronic methods, to the official and 
the official confirms the individual is the person 
identified on the applicable identifying docu-
ment.

CREPANCY
IN
SIGNATURES.—If an individual 
casts a provisional ballot under this paragraph 
and the appropriate State or local election offi-
cial determines that a discrepancy exists be-
tween the signature on such ballot and the sig-
nature of such individual on the official list of 
registered voters in the State or other official 
record or document used by the State to verify 
the signatures of voters, such election official, 
prior to making a final determination as to the 
validity of such ballot, shall— 
‘‘(I) as soon as practical, but no later than the 
next business day after such determination is 
made, make a good faith effort to notify the in-
dividual by mail, telephone, and (if available) 
text message and electronic mail that— 
‘‘(aa) a discrepancy exists between the signa-
ture on such ballot and the signature of the in-
dividual on the official list of registered voters 
in the State or other official record or document 
used by the State to verify the signatures of vot-
ers; and

following the State’s deadline for receiving mail- 
in ballots or absentee ballots, the individual pro-
vides the official with information to cure such 
discrepancy, either in person, by telephone, or 
by electronic methods. 
‘‘(ii) NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO CURE OTHER 
DEFECTS.—If an individual casts a provisional 
ballot under this paragraph with a defect 
which, if left uncured, would cause the ballot to 
not be counted, the appropriate State or local 
election official, prior to making a final deter-
mination as to the validity of the ballot, shall— 
‘‘(I) as soon as practical, but no later than the 
next business day after such determination is 
made, make a good faith effort to notify the in-
dividual by mail, telephone, and (if available)

defect prior to the expiration of the third day 
following the State’s deadline for receiving mail- 
in ballots or absentee ballots, such ballot will 
not be counted; and

line for receiving mail-in ballots or absentee bal-
lots, the individual cures the defect.

‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Nothing in paragraph 
(2)(C) or this paragraph shall be construed to 
prevent a State from permitting an individual

applicable requirements with respect to voting in 
the election).

VERSION OF STATEMENT BY COMMISSION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall de-
velop pre-printed versions of the statements de-
scribed in paragraphs (2)(B)(i) and (3)(A) which 
include appropriate blank spaces for the provi-
sion of names and signatures.

igible voters by reason of the death of the reg-

lishing the notice in a newspaper of wide cir-
culation and posting the notice on the websites 
of the appropriate election officials) that list 
maintenance is taking place and that reg-
istrants should check their registration status to 
ensure no errors or mistakes have been made. 
The State shall ensure that the public notice

TITLE III—PREVENTING ELECTION 
SUBVERSION 
Subtitle A—Restrictions on Removal of 
Election Administrators 
SEC. 3001. RESTRICTIONS ON REMOVAL OF LOCAL 
ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS IN AD-
MINISTRATION OF ELECTIONS FOR 
FEDERAL OFFICE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) Congress has explicit and broad authority 
to regulate the time, place, and manner of Fed-
eral elections under the Elections Clause under 
article I, section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution, 
including by establishing standards for the fair, 
impartial, and uniform administration of Fed-
eral elections by State and local officials. 
(2) The Elections Clause was understood from 
the framing of the Constitution to contain 
‘‘words of great latitude,’’ granting Congress 
broad power over Federal elections and a ple-
nary right to preempt State regulation in this 
area. As made clear at the Constitutional Con-
vention and the State ratification debates that 
followed, this grant of congressional authority 
was meant to ‘‘insure free and fair elections,’’ 
promote the uniform administration of Federal 
elections, and ‘‘preserve and restore to the peo-
ple their equal and sacred rights of election.’’. 
(3) In the founding debates on the Elections 
Clause, many delegates also argued that a broad 
grant of authority to Congress over Federal 
elections was necessary to check any ‘‘abuses 
that might be made of the discretionary power’’ 
to regulate the time, place, and manner of elec-
tions granted the States, including attempts at 
partisan entrenchment, malapportionment, and 
the exclusion of political minorities. As the Su-
preme Court has recognized, the Elections 
Clause empowers Congress to ‘‘protect the elec-
tions on which its existence depends,’’ Ex parte 
Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 658 (1884), and ‘‘protect 
the citizen in the exercise of rights conferred by 
the Constitution of the United States essential 
to the healthy organization of the government 
itself,’’ id. at 666. 
(4) The Elections Clause grants Congress ‘‘ple-
nary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole 
subject’’ of Federal elections, Ex parte Siebold, 
100 U.S. 371, 388 (1879), allowing Congress to im-
plement ‘‘a complete code for congressional elec-
tions.’’ Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932). 
The Elections Clause, unlike, for example, the 
Commerce Clause, has been found to grant Con-
gress the authority to compel States to alter 
their regulations as to Federal elections, id. at 
id. at 366–67, even if these alterations would im-
pose additional costs on the States to execute or 
enforce. Association of Community Organiza-
tions for Reform Now v. Miller, 129 F.3d 833 (6th 
Cir. 1997). 
(5) The phrase ‘‘manner of holding elections’’ 
in the Elections Clause has been interpreted by 
the Supreme Court to authorize Congress to reg-
ulate all aspects of the Federal election process, 
including ‘‘notices, registration, supervision of 
voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud 
and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties 
of inspectors and canvassers, and the making 
and publication of election returns.’’ Smiley v. 
Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932). 
(6) The Supreme Court has recognized the 
broad ‘‘substantive scope’’ of the Elections 
Clause and upheld Federal laws promulgated 
thereunder regulating redistricting, voter reg-
istration, campaign finance, primary elections, 
recounts, party affiliation rules, and balloting. 
(7) The authority of Congress under the Elec-
tions Clause also entails the power to ensure en-
forcement of its laws regulating Federal elec-
tions. ‘‘[I]f Congress has the power to make reg-
ulations, it must have the power to enforce 
them.’’ Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 387 (1879). 
The Supreme Court has noted that there can be 
no question that Congress may impose addi-
tional penalties for offenses committed by State 
officers in connection with Federal elections 
even if they differ from the penalties prescribed 
by State law for the same acts. Id. at 387–88. 
(8) The fair and impartial administration of 
Federal elections by State and local officials is 
central to ‘‘the successful working of this gov-
ernment,’’ Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 666 
(1884), and to ‘‘protect the act of voting . . . and 
the election itself from corruption or fraud,’’ id. 
at 661–62. 
(9) The Elections Clause thus grants Congress 
the authority to ensure that the administration 
of Federal elections is free of political bias or 
discrimination and that election officials are in-
sulated from political influence or other forms of 
coercion in discharging their duties in connec-
tion with Federal elections. 
(10) In some States, oversight of local election 
administrators has been allocated to State Elec-
tion Boards, or special commissions formed by 
those boards, that are appointed by the pre-
vailing political party in a State, as opposed to 
nonpartisan or elected office holders. 
(11) In certain newly enacted State policies, 
these appointed statewide election administra-
tors have been granted wide latitude to suspend 
or remove local election administrators in cases 
where the statewide election administrators 
identify whatever the State deems to be a viola-
tion. There is no requirement that there be a 
finding of intent by the local election adminis-
trator to commit the violation. 
(12) Local election administrators across the 
country can be suspended or removed according 
to different standards, potentially exposing 
them to different political pressures or biases 
that could result in uneven administration of 
Federal elections. 
(13) The Elections Clause grants Congress the 
ultimate authority to ensure that oversight of 
State and local election administrators is fair 
and impartial in order to ensure equitable and 
uniform administration of Federal elections. 
(b) RESTRICTION.— 
(1) STANDARD FOR REMOVAL OF A LOCAL ELEC-
TION ADMINISTRATOR.—A statewide election ad-
ministrator may only suspend, remove, or relieve 
the duties of a local election administrator in 
the State with respect to the administration of 
an election for Federal office for inefficiency, 
neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. 
(2) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Any local election adminis-
trator suspended, removed, or otherwise relieved 
of duties in violation of paragraph (1) with re-
spect to the administration of an election for 
Federal office or against whom any proceeding 
for suspension, removal, or relief from duty in 
violation of paragraph (1) with respect to the 
administration of an election for Federal office 
may be pending, may bring an action in an ap-
propriate district court of the United States for 
declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to 
the violation. Any such action shall name as the

Subtitle D—Protection of Election Records & 
Election Infrastructure 
SEC. 3301. STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR FED-
ERAL ELECTION RECORDS. 
(a) FINDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.— 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Congress has explicit and broad authority 
to regulate the time, place, and manner of Fed-
eral elections under the Elections Clause under 
article I, section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution, 
including by establishing standards for the fair, 
impartial, and uniform administration of Fed-
eral elections by State and local officials. 
(2) The Elections Clause grants Congress ‘‘ple-
nary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole 
subject’’ of Federal elections, Ex parte Siebold, 
100 U.S. 371, 388 (1879), allowing Congress to im-
plement ‘‘a complete code for congressional elec-
tions.’’ Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932). 
(3) The fair and impartial administration of 
Federal elections by State and local officials is 
central to ‘‘the successful working of this gov-
ernment’’, Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 666 
(1884), and to ‘‘protect the act of voting . . . and 
the election itself from corruption or fraud’’, id. 
at 661–62. 
(4) The Elections Clause thus grants Congress 
the authority to strengthen the protections for 
Federal election records. 
(5) Congress has intervened in the electoral 
process to protect the health and legitimacy of 
federal elections, including for example, Con-
gress’ enactment of the Help America Vote Act 
of 2002 as a response to several issues that oc-
curred during the 2000 Presidential election. See

This part may be cited as the ‘‘Right to Vote 
Act’’. 
SEC. 3402. UNDUE BURDENS ON THE ABILITY TO 
VOTE IN ELECTIONS FOR FEDERAL 
OFFICE PROHIBITED. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Every citizen of legal voting 
age shall have the right to vote and have one’s 
vote counted in elections for Federal office free 
from any burden on the time, place, or manner 
of voting, as set forth in subsections (b) and (c). 
(b) RETROGRESSION.—A government may not 
diminish the ability to vote or to have one’s vote 
counted in an election for Federal office unless 
the law, rule, standard, practice, procedure, or 
other governmental action causing the diminish-
ment is the least restrictive means of signifi-
cantly furthering an important, particularized 
government interest. 
(c) SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—A government may not sub-
stantially impair the ability of an individual to 
vote or to have one’s vote counted in an election 
for Federal office unless the law, rule, standard, 
practice, procedure, or other governmental ac-
tion causing the impairment significantly fur-
thers an important, particularized governmental 
interest. 
(2) SUBSTANTIAL
IMPAIRMENT.—For purposes 
of this section, a substantial impairment is a 
non-trivial impairment that makes it more dif-
ficult to vote or to have one’s vote counted than 
if the law, rule, standard, practice, procedure, 
or other governmental action had not been 
adopted or implemented. An impairment may be 
substantial even if the voter or other similarly 
situated voters are able to vote or to have one’s 
vote counted notwithstanding the impairment. 
SEC. 3403. JUDICIAL REVIEW. 
(a) CIVIL ACTION.—An action challenging a 
violation of this part may be brought by any ag-
grieved person or the Attorney General in the

to obtain all appropriate relief, whether declara-
tory or injunctive, or facial or as-applied. Proc-
ess may be served in any district where a de-
fendant resides, does business, or may be found.

H113 
January 13, 2022 
(b) STANDARDS TO BE APPLIED.—A courts ad-
judicating an action brought under this part 
shall apply the following standards: 
(1) RETROGRESSION.— 
(A) A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case 
of retrogression by demonstrating by a prepon-
derance of the evidence that a rule, standard, 
practice, procedure, or other governmental ac-
tion diminishes the ability, or otherwise makes it 
more difficult, to vote, or have one’s vote count-
ed. 
(B) If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case 
as described in subparagraph (A), the govern-
ment shall be provided an opportunity to dem-
onstrate by clear and convincing evidence that 
the diminishment is necessary to significantly 
further an important, particularized govern-
mental interest. 
(C) If the government meets its burden under 
subparagraph (B), the challenged rule, stand-
ard, practice, procedure, or other governmental 
action shall nonetheless be deemed invalid if the 
plaintiff demonstrates by a preponderance of 
the evidence that the government could adopt or 
implement a less-restrictive means of furthering 
the particularized important governmental in-
terest. 
(2) SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT.— 
(A) A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case 
of substantial impairment by demonstrating by a 
preponderance of the evidence that a rule, 
standard, practice, procedure, or other govern-
mental action is a non-trivial impairment of the 
ability to vote or to have one’s vote counted. 
(B) If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case 
as described in subparagraph (A), the govern-
ment shall be provided an opportunity to dem-
onstrate by clear and convincing evidence that 
the impairment significantly furthers an impor-
tant, particularized governmental interest. 
(c) DUTY TO EXPEDITE.—It shall be the duty 
of the court to advance on the docket and to ex-
pedite to the greatest reasonable extent the dis-
position of the action and appeal under this sec-
tion. 
(d) ATTORNEY’S FEES.—Section 722(b) of the 
Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988(b)) is amend-
ed— 
(1) by striking ‘‘or section 40302’’ and insert-
ing ‘‘section 40302’’; and 
(2) by striking ‘‘, the court’’ and inserting ‘‘, 
or section 3402(a) of the Freedom to Vote Act, 
the court’’.

PAIRMENT.—Subsection (c) of section 3402 shall 
apply to any law, rule, standard, practice, pro-
cedure, or other governmental action in effect

curring on or after January 1, 2022. 
PART 2—CLARIFYING JURISDICTION OVER 
ELECTION DISPUTES 
SEC. 3411. FINDINGS. 
In addition to providing for the statutory 
rights described in sections part 1, including ju-
dicial review under section 3403, Congress makes 
the following findings regarding enforcement of 
constitutional provisions protecting the right to 
vote: 
(1) It is a priority of Congress to ensure that 
pending and future disputes arising under the 
Fifteenth Amendment or any other constitu-
tional provisions protecting the right to vote 
may be heard in federal court. 
(2) The Fifth Circuit has misconstrued section 
1344 of title 28, United States Code, to deprive 
Federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction in 
certain classes of cases that implicate voters’ 
constitutional rights, see, e.g., Keyes v. Gunn, 
890 F.3d 232 (5th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. 
Ct. 434 (2018); Johnson v. Stevenson, 170 F.2d 
108 (5th Cir. 1948). 
(3) Section 1344 of such title is also super-
fluous in light of other broad grants of Federal 
jurisdiction. See, e.g., section 1331, section 
1343(a)(3), and section 1343(a)(4) of title 28, 
United States Code. 
(4) Congress therefore finds that a repeal of 
section 1344 is appropriate and that such repeal 
will ensure that Federal courts nationwide are 
empowered to enforce voters’ constitutional 
rights in federal elections and state legislative 
elections. 
SEC. 3412. CLARIFYING AUTHORITY OF UNITED 
STATES DISTRICT COURTS TO HEAR 
CASES. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Section 1344 of title 28, 
United States Code, is repealed. 
(b) CONTINUING AUTHORITY
OF COURTS
TO 
HEAR CASES UNDER OTHER EXISTING AUTHOR-
ITY.—Nothing in this part may be construed to 
affect the authority of district courts of the 
United States to exercise jurisdiction pursuant 
to existing provisions of law, including sections 
1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1343(a)(4) of title 28, United 
States Code, in any cases arising under the Con-
stitution, laws, or treaties of the United States 
concerning the administration, conduct, or re-
sults of an election for Federal office or state 
legislative office. 
(c) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of sec-
tions for chapter 85 of title 28, United States 
Code, is amended by striking the item relating to 
section 1344. 
SEC. 3413. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This part and the amendments made by this 
part shall apply to actions brought on or after 
the date of the enactment of this Act and to ac-
tions brought before the date of enactment of 
this Act which are pending as of such date.

‘‘(a) REQUIREMENTS FOR CHALLENGES BY PER-
SONS OTHER THAN ELECTION OFFICIALS.— 
‘‘(1) REQUIREMENTS
FOR
CHALLENGES.—No 
person, other than a State or local election offi-
cial, shall submit a formal challenge to an indi-
vidual’s eligibility to register to vote in an elec-
tion for Federal office or to vote in an election 
for Federal office unless that challenge is sup-
ported by personal knowledge with respect to 
each 
individual 
challenged 
regarding 
the 
grounds for ineligibility which is— 
‘‘(A) documented in writing; and 
‘‘(B) subject to an oath or attestation under 
penalty of perjury that the challenger has a 
good faith factual basis to believe that the indi-
vidual who is the subject of the challenge is in-
eligible to register to vote or vote in that elec-
tion, except a challenge which is based on the 
race, ethnicity, or national origin of the indi-
vidual who is the subject of the challenge may 
not be considered to have a good faith factual 
basis for purposes of this paragraph. 
‘‘(2) PROHIBITION ON CHALLENGES ON OR NEAR 
DATE
OF
ELECTION.—No person, other than a 
State or local election official, shall be per-
mitted— 
‘‘(A) to challenge an individual’s eligibility to 
vote in an election for Federal office on the date 
of the election on grounds that could have been 
made in advance of such date, or 
‘‘(B) to challenge an individual’s eligibility to 
register to vote in an election for Federal office 
or to vote in an election for Federal office less 
than 10 days before the election unless the indi-
vidual registered to vote less than 20 days before 
the election. 
‘‘(b) BUFFER RULE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A person who is serving as 
a poll observer with respect to an election for 
Federal office may not come within 8 feet of— 
‘‘(A) a voter or ballot at a polling location 
during any period of voting (including any pe-
riod of early voting) in such election; or 
‘‘(B) a ballot at any time during which the 
processing, scanning, tabulating, canvassing, or 
certifying voting results is occurring. 
‘‘(2) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
paragraph (1) may be construed to limit the 
ability of a State or local election official to re-
quire poll observers to maintain a distance 
greater than 8 feet. 
‘‘(c) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—This section shall 
apply with respect to elections for Federal office 
occurring on and after January 1, 2022.’’. 
(b) CONFORMING
AMENDMENT
RELATING
TO 
VOLUNTARY
GUIDANCE.—Section 321(b)(4) of 
such Act (52 U.S.C. 21101(b)), as added and re-
designated by section 1101(b) and as amended by 
sections 1102, 1103, 1104, and 1303, is amended

(c) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of con-
tents of such Act is amended by inserting after 
the item relating to section 303 the following:

Subtitle H—Preventing Restrictions on Food 
and Beverages 
SEC. 3701. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited 
as the ‘‘Voters’ Access to Water Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) States have a legitimate interest in prohib-
iting electioneering at or near polling places, 
and each State has some form of restriction on 
political activities near polling places when vot-
ing is taking place. 
(2) In recent elections, voters have waited in 
unacceptably long lines to cast their ballot. 
During the 2018 midterm election, more than 
3,000,000 voters were made to wait longer than 
the acceptable threshold for wait times set by 
the Presidential Commission on Election Admin-
istration, 
including 
many 
well-documented 
cases where voters were made to wait for several 
hours. A disproportionate number of those who 
had to wait long periods were Black or Latino 
voters, who were more likely than White voters 
to wait in the longest lines on Election Day. 
(3) Allowing volunteers to donate food and 
water to all people waiting in line at a polling 
place, regardless of the voters’ political pref-
erence and without engaging in electioneering 
activities or partisan advocacy, helps ensure 
Americans who face long lines at their polling 
place can still exercise their Constitutional right 
to vote, without risk of dehydration, inadequate 
food, discomfort, and risks to health. 
SEC. 3702. PROHIBITING RESTRICTIONS ON DO-
NATIONS OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES 
AT POLLING STATIONS. 
(a) REQUIREMENT.—Subtitle A of title III of 
the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 
21081 et seq.), as amended by section 1031(a), 
section 1044(a), section 1101(a), section 1102(a), 
section 1103(a), section 1104(a), section 1201(a), 
section 1301(a), section 1302(a), section 1303(b), 
section 
1305(a), 
section 
1606(a)(1), 
section 
1607(a), and section 1624(a) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating sections 318 and 319 as 
sections 319 and 320, respectively; and 
(2) by inserting after section 317 the following

FINDINGS 
RELATING 
TO 
ILLICIT 
MONEY UNDERMINING OUR DEMOC-
RACY. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt govern-
ment officials frequently abuse anonymously 
held Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), also 
known as ‘‘shell companies,’’ to hide, move, and 
launder the dirty money derived from illicit ac-
tivities such as trafficking, bribery, exploitation, 
and embezzlement. Ownership and control of 
the finances that run through shell companies 
are obscured to regulators and law enforcement 
because little information is required and col-
lected when establishing these entities. 
(2) The public release of the ‘‘Panama Pa-
pers’’ in 2016 and the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ in 2017 
revealed that these shell companies often pur-
chase and sell United States real estate. United 
States anti-money laundering laws do not apply 
to cash transactions involving real estate effec-
tively concealing the beneficiaries and trans-
actions from regulators and law enforcement. 
(3) Since the Supreme Court’s decisions in 
Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 
558 U.S. 310 (2010), millions of dollars have 
flowed into super PACs through LLCs whose 
funders are anonymous or intentionally ob-
scured. Criminal investigations have uncovered 
LLCs that were used to hide illegal campaign 
contributions from foreign criminal fugitives, to 
advance 
international 
influence-buying 
schemes, and to conceal contributions from do-
nors who were already under investigation for 
bribery and racketeering. Voters have no way to 
know the true sources of the money being routed 
through these LLCs to influence elections, in-
cluding whether any of the funds come from for-
eign or other illicit sources. 
(4) Congress should curb the use of anony-
mous shell companies for illicit purposes by re-
quiring United States companies to disclose their 
beneficial owners, strengthening anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws. 
(5) Congress should examine the money laun-
dering and terrorist financing risks in the real 
estate market, including the role of anonymous 
parties, and review legislation to address any 
vulnerabilities identified in this sector. 
(6) Congress should examine the methods by 
which corruption flourishes and the means to 
detect and deter the financial misconduct that 
fuels this driver of global instability. Congress 
should monitor government efforts to enforce 
United States anticorruption laws and regula-
tions.

‘‘(A) VOTER-VERIFIABLE PAPER BALLOTS.— 
‘‘(i) The voting system shall require the use of 
an individual, durable, voter-verifiable paper 
ballot of the voter’s vote selections that shall be 
marked by the voter and presented to the voter 
for verification before the voter’s ballot is pre-
served in accordance with subparagraph (B), 
and which shall be counted by hand or other 
counting device or read by a ballot tabulation 
device. For purposes of this subclause, the term 
‘individual, durable, voter-verifiable paper bal-
lot’ means a paper ballot marked by the voter by 
hand or a paper ballot marked through the use 
of a nontabulating ballot marking device or sys-
tem, so long as the voter shall have the option 
at every in-person voting location to mark by 
hand a printed ballot that includes all relevant 
contests and candidates. 
‘‘(ii) The voting system shall provide the voter 
with an opportunity to correct any error on the 
paper 
ballot 
before 
the 
permanent 
voter- 
verifiable paper ballot is preserved in accord-
ance with subparagraph (B). 
‘‘(iii) The voting system shall not preserve the 
voter-verifiable paper ballots in any manner 
that makes it possible, at any time after the bal-
lot has been cast, to associate a voter with the 
record of the voter’s vote selections. 
‘‘(iv) The voting system shall prevent, through 
mechanical means or through independently 
verified protections, the modification or addition 
of vote selections on a printed or marked ballot 
at any time after the voter has been provided an 
opportunity to correct errors on the ballot pur-
suant to clause (ii). 
‘‘(B) PRESERVATION
AS
OFFICIAL
RECORD.— 
The individual, durable, voter-verifiable paper 
ballot used in accordance with subparagraph 
(A) shall constitute the official ballot and shall 
be preserved and used as the official ballot for 
purposes of any recount or audit conducted 
with respect to any election for Federal office in 
which the voting system is used. 
‘‘(C) MANUAL
COUNTING
REQUIREMENTS
FOR 
RECOUNTS AND AUDITS.— 
‘‘(i) Each paper ballot used pursuant to sub-
paragraph (A) shall be suitable for a manual 
audit, and such ballots, or at least those ballots 
the machine could not count, shall be counted 
by hand in any recount or audit conducted with 
respect to any election for Federal office. 
‘‘(ii) In the event of any inconsistencies or 
irregularities between any electronic vote tallies 
and the vote tallies determined by counting by 
hand the individual, durable, voter-verifiable 
paper ballots used pursuant to subparagraph 
(A), the individual, durable, voter-verifiable 
paper ballots shall be the true and correct 
record of the votes cast. 
‘‘(D) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that as innovation occurs in the elec-
tion infrastructure sector, Congress should en-
sure that this Act and other Federal require-
ments for voting systems are updated to keep 
pace with best practices and recommendations 
for security and accessibility.’’. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT CLARIFYING AP-
PLICABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE ACCES-
SIBILITY.—Section 301(a)(4) of such Act (52 
U.S.C. 21081(a)(4)) is amended by inserting ‘‘(in-
cluding the paper ballots required to be used 
under paragraph (2))’’ after ‘‘voting system’’. 
(c) OTHER CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—Sec-
tion 301(a)(1) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(1)) 
is amended— 
(1) 
in 
subparagraph 
(A)(i), 
by 
striking 
‘‘counted’’ and inserting ‘‘counted, in accord-
ance with paragraphs (2) and (3)’’; 
(2) in subparagraph (A)(ii), by striking 
‘‘counted’’ and inserting ‘‘counted, in accord-
ance with paragraphs (2) and (3)’’;

ance with paragraphs (2) and (3)’’.

ABILITIES.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The voting system shall— 
‘‘(i) be accessible for individuals with disabil-
ities, including nonvisual accessibility for the 
blind and visually impaired, in a manner that 
provides the same opportunity for access and 
participation (including privacy and independ-
ence) as for other voters; 
‘‘(ii)(I) ensure that individuals with disabil-
ities and others are given an equivalent oppor-
tunity to vote, including with privacy and inde-
pendence, in a manner that produces a voter- 
verifiable paper ballot; and 
‘‘(II) satisfy the requirement of clause (i) 
through the use at in-person polling locations of 
a sufficient number (not less than one) of voting 
systems equipped to serve individuals with and 
without disabilities, including nonvisual and 
enhanced visual accessibility for the blind and 
visually impaired, and nonmanual and en-
hanced manual accessibility for the mobility 
and dexterity impaired; and 
‘‘(iii) if purchased with funds made available 
under title II on or after January 1, 2007, meet 
the voting system standards for disability access 
(as outlined in this paragraph). 
‘‘(B) MEANS
OF
MEETING
REQUIREMENTS.—A 
voting system may meet the requirements of sub-
paragraph (A)(i) and paragraph (2) by— 
‘‘(i) allowing the voter to privately and inde-
pendently verify the permanent paper ballot 
through the presentation, in accessible form, of 
the printed or marked vote selections from the 
same printed or marked information that would 
be used for any vote tabulation or auditing; 
‘‘(ii) allowing the voter to privately and inde-
pendently verify and cast the permanent paper 
ballot without requiring the voter to manually 
handle the paper ballot; 
‘‘(iii) marking ballots that are identical in 
size, ink, and paper stock to those ballots that 
would either be marked by hand or be marked 
by a ballot marking device made generally avail-
able to voters; or 
‘‘(iv) combining ballots produced by any ballot 
marking devices reserved for individuals with 
disabilities with ballots that have either been 
marked by voters by hand or marked by ballot 
marking devices made generally available to vot-
ers, in a way that prevents identification of the 
ballots that were cast using any ballot marking 
device that was reserved for individuals with 
disabilities. 
‘‘(C) SUFFICIENT
NUMBER.—For purposes of 
subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), the sufficient number 
of voting systems for any in-person polling loca-
tion shall be determined based on guidance from 
the Attorney General, in consultation with the 
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Com-
pliance 
Board 
established 
under 
section 
502(a)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 792(a)(1)) (commonly referred to as the 
United States Access Board) and the Commis-
sion.’’. 
(b) SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT OF STUDY, TEST-
ING, AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESSIBLE VOTING 
OPTIONS.— 
(1) STUDY AND REPORTING.—Subtitle C of title 
II of such Act (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.) is amend-
ed— 
(A) by redesignating section 247 as section 248; 
and 
(B) by inserting after section 247 the following 
new section: 
‘‘SEC. 248. STUDY AND REPORT ON ACCESSIBLE 
VOTING OPTIONS. 
‘‘(a) GRANTS
TO STUDY
AND REPORT.—The 
Commission, in coordination with the Access 
Board and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, shall make grants to not fewer

velop—

to enhance the accessibility of voting and 
verification for individuals with disabilities; or

ceive a grant under this part if it submits to the 
Commission (at such time and in such form as 
the Commission may require) an application 
containing— 
‘‘(1) a certification that the entity shall com-
plete the activities carried out with the grant 
not later than January 1, 2024; and 
‘‘(2) such other information and certifications 
as the Commission may require. 
‘‘(c) AVAILABILITY

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.— 
‘‘(A) For purposes of subsection (a)(4), if a

cast within the county, the appropriate election 
official of the jurisdiction in which the indi-
vidual is registered or otherwise eligible to vote 
shall count each vote on such ballot for each 
election in which the individual who cast such 
ballot is eligible to vote. 
‘‘(B) In addition to the requirements under 
subsection (a), for each State or political sub-
division that provides voters provisional ballots, 
challenge ballots, or affidavit ballots under the 
State’s applicable law governing the voting 
processes for those voters whose eligibility to 
vote is determined to be uncertain by election of-

sional ballot, the information or documents the 
voter needs to prove eligibility, the location at 
which the voter must appear to submit these ma-
terials or alternative methods, including email 
or facsimile, that the voter may use to submit 
these materials, and the deadline for submitting 
these materials;

mentation on eligibility. 
‘‘(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
subsection shall prohibit a State or jurisdiction 
from counting a provisional ballot which is cast 
in a different county within the State than the 
county in which the voter is registered or other-
wise eligible to vote. 
‘‘(f) DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR STATES

‘‘(B) SIGNATURE
VERIFICATION
REQUIREMENT 
DESCRIBED.—In this subsection, a ‘signature

verify the signatures of voters. 
‘‘(2) DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO CURE DIS-
CREPANCY IN SIGNATURES.—If an individual sub-

by the State to verify the signatures of voters, 
such election official, prior to making a final de-
termination as to the validity of such ballot, 
shall—

next business day after such determination is 
made, make a good faith effort to notify the in-
dividual by mail, telephone, and (if available) 
text message and electronic mail that— 
‘‘(I) a discrepancy exists between the signa-
ture on such ballot and the signature of the in-
dividual on the official list of registered voters 
in the State or other official record or document 
used by the State to verify the signatures of vot-
ers; and 
‘‘(II) if such discrepancy is not cured prior to 
the expiration of the third day following the 
State’s deadline for receiving mail-in ballots or 
absentee ballots, such ballot will not be counted 
; and 
‘‘(ii) cure such discrepancy and count the bal-
lot if, prior to the expiration of the third day 
following the State’s deadline for receiving mail- 
in ballots or absentee ballots, the individual pro-
vides the official with information to cure such 
discrepancy, either in person, by telephone, or 
by electronic methods. 
‘‘(B) NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY TO CURE MISS-
ING SIGNATURE OR OTHER DEFECT.—If an indi-
vidual submits a provisional ballot without a 
signature or submits a provisional ballot with 
another defect which, if left uncured, would 
cause the ballot to not be counted, the appro-
priate State or local election official, prior to 
making a final determination as to the validity 
of the ballot, shall— 
‘‘(i) as soon as practical, but no later than the 
next business day after such determination is 
made, make a good faith effort to notify the in-
dividual by mail, telephone, and (if available) 
text message and electronic mail that—

has some other defect; and 
‘‘(II) if the individual does not provide the 
missing signature or cure the other defect prior 
to the expiration of the third day following the 
State’s deadline for receiving mail-in ballots or 
absentee ballots, such ballot will not be counted; 
and 
‘‘(ii) count the ballot if, prior to the expiration 
of the third day following the State’s deadline 
for receiving mail-in ballots or absentee ballots, 
the individual provides the official with the 
missing signature on a form proscribed by the 
State or cures the other defect. 
‘‘(C) OTHER REQUIREMENTS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—An election official may not 
make a determination that a discrepancy exists 
between the signature on a provisional ballot 
and the signature of the individual on the offi-

State to verify the signatures of voters unless—

termination;

DIVISION C—CIVIC PARTICIPATION AND 
EMPOWERMENT 
TITLE V—NONPARTISAN REDISTRICTING 
REFORM 
SEC. 5001. FINDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL AU-
THORITY. 
Congress finds that it has the authority to es-
tablish the terms and conditions States must fol-
low in carrying out congressional redistricting 
after an apportionment of Members of the House 
of Representatives because— 
(1) the authority granted to Congress under 
article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the 
United States gives Congress the power to enact 
laws governing the time, place, and manner of 
elections for Members of the House of Represent-
atives; 
(2) the authority granted to Congress under 
section 5 of the 14th amendment to the Constitu-
tion gives Congress the power to enact laws to 
enforce section 2 of such amendment, which re-
quires Representatives to be apportioned among 
the several States according to their number; 
(3) the authority granted to Congress under 
section 5 of the 14th amendment to the Constitu-
tion gives Congress the power to enact laws to 
enforce section 1 of such amendment, including 
protections against excessive partisan gerry-
mandering that Federal courts have not en-
forced because they understand such enforce-
ment to be committed to Congress by the Con-
stitution; 
(4) of the authority granted to Congress to en-
force article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, 
and the guarantee of a Republican Form of 
Government to every State, which Federal 
courts have not enforced because they under-
stand such enforcement to be committed to Con-
gress by the Constitution; 
(5) requiring States to use uniform redis-
tricting criteria is an appropriate and important 
exercise of such authority; and 
(6) partisan gerrymandering dilutes citizens’ 
votes because partisan gerrymandering injures 
voters and political parties by infringing on 
their First Amendment right to associate freely 
and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal 
protection of the laws. 
SEC. 5002. BAN ON MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING. 
A State that has been redistricted in accord-
ance with this title may not be redistricted 
again until after the next apportionment of Rep-
resentatives under section 22(a) of the Act enti-
tled ‘‘An Act to provide for the fifteenth and 
subsequent decennial censuses and to provide 
for an apportionment of Representatives in Con-
gress’’, approved June 18, 1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a), un-
less a court requires the State to conduct such 
subsequent redistricting to comply with the Con-
stitution of the United States, the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), the terms or 
conditions of this title, or applicable State law.

plan enacted following the notice of apportion-
ment transmitted to the President on April 26, 
2021, or any subsequent notice of apportion-
ment, if such plan is not in compliance with this 
section, without regard to whether or not the 
plan was enacted by the State before, on, or 
after the effective date of this title. 
(b) RANKED
CRITERIA.—Under the redis-
tricting plan of a State, there shall be estab-
lished 
single-member 
congressional 
districts 
using the following criteria as set forth in the 
following order of priority: 
(1) Districts shall comply with the United 
States Constitution, including the requirement 
that they substantially equalize total popu-
lation, without regard to age, citizenship status, 
or immigration status. 
(2) Districts shall comply with the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), in-
cluding by creating any districts where, if based 
upon the totality of the circumstances, 2 or more 
politically cohesive groups protected by such Act 
are able to elect representatives of choice in coa-
lition with one another, and all applicable Fed-
eral laws. 
(3)(A) Districts shall be drawn, to the extent 
that the totality of the circumstances warrant, 
to ensure the practical ability of a group pro-
tected under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to participate in the polit-
ical process and to nominate candidates and to 
elect representatives of choice is not diluted or 
diminished, regardless of whether or not such 
protected group constitutes a majority of a dis-
trict’s population, voting age population, or cit-
izen voting age population. 
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the as-
sessment of whether a protected group has the 
practical ability to nominate candidates and to 
elect representatives of choice shall require the 
consideration of the following factors: 
(i) Whether the group is politically cohesive. 
(ii) Whether there is racially polarized voting 
in the relevant geographic region. 
(iii) If there is racially polarized voting in the 
relevant geographic region, whether the pre-
ferred candidates of the group nevertheless re-
ceive a sufficient amount of consistent crossover 
support from other voters such that the group is 
a functional majority with the ability to both 
nominate candidates and elect representatives of 
choice. 
(4)(A) Districts shall be drawn to respect com-
munities of interest and neighborhoods to the 
extent practicable after compliance with the re-
quirements of paragraphs (1) through (3). A 
community of interest is defined as an area for 
which the record before the entity responsible 
for developing and adopting the redistricting 
plan demonstrates the existence of broadly 
shared interests and representational needs, in-
cluding shared interests and representational 
needs rooted in common ethnic, racial, eco-
nomic, Indian, social, cultural, geographic, or 
historic identities, or arising from similar socio-
economic conditions. The term communities of 
interest may, if the record warrants, include po-
litical subdivisions such as counties, municipali-
ties, Indian lands, or school districts, but shall 
not include common relationships with political 
parties or political candidates. 
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), in con-
sidering the needs of multiple, overlapping com-
munities of interest, the entity responsible for 
developing and adopting the redistricting plan 
shall give greater weight to those communities of 
interest whose representational needs would 
most benefit from the community’s inclusion in 
a single congressional district. 
(c) NO FAVORING OR DISFAVORING OF POLIT-
ICAL PARTIES.— 
(1) PROHIBITION.—A State may not use a re-
districting plan to conduct an election if the 
plan’s congressional districts, when considered 
cumulatively on a statewide basis, have been 
drawn with the intent or have the effect of ma-
terially favoring or disfavoring any political 
party. 
(2) DETERMINATION
OF
EFFECT.—The deter-
mination of whether a redistricting plan has the 
effect of materially favoring or disfavoring a po-
litical party shall be based on an evaluation of 
the totality of circumstances which, at a min-
imum, shall involve consideration of each of the 
following factors: 
(A) Computer modeling based on relevant 
statewide general elections for Federal office 
held over the 8 years preceding the adoption of 
the redistricting plan setting forth the probable 
electoral outcomes for the plan under a range of 
reasonably foreseeable conditions. 
(B) An analysis of whether the redistricting 
plan is statistically likely to result in partisan 
advantage or disadvantage on a statewide basis, 
the degree of any such advantage or disadvan-
tage, and whether such advantage or disadvan-
tage is likely to be present under a range of rea-
sonably foreseeable electoral conditions. 
(C) A comparison of the modeled electoral out-
comes for the redistricting plan to the modeled 
electoral outcomes for alternative plans that de-
monstrably comply with the requirements of 
paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (b) in 
order to determine whether reasonable alter-
natives exist that would result in materially 
lower levels of partisan advantage or disadvan-
tage on a statewide basis. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, alternative plans considered may 
include both actual plans proposed during the 
redistricting process and other plans prepared 
for purposes of comparison. 
(D) Any other relevant information, including 
how broad support for the redistricting plan was 
among members of the entity responsible for de-
veloping and adopting the plan and whether the 
processes leading to the development and adop-
tion of the plan were transparent and equally 
open to all members of the entity and to the 
public. 
(3) REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.— 
(A) TRIGGER.—In any civil action brought 
under section 5006 in which a party asserts a 
claim that a State has enacted a redistricting 
plan which is in violation of this subsection, a 
party may file a motion not later than 30 days 
after the enactment of the plan (or, in the case 
of a plan enacted before the effective date of 
this Act, not later than 30 days after the effec-
tive date of this Act) requesting that the court 
determine whether a presumption of such a vio-
lation exists. If such a motion is timely filed, the 
court shall hold a hearing not later than 15 
days after the date the motion is filed to assess 
whether a presumption of such a violation ex-
ists. 
(B) ASSESSMENT.—To conduct the assessment 
required under subparagraph (A), the court 
shall do the following: 
(i) Determine the number of congressional dis-
tricts under the plan that would have been car-
ried by each political party’s candidates for the 
office of President and the office of Senator in 
the 2 most recent general elections for the office 
of President and the 2 most recent general elec-
tions for the office of Senator (other than spe-
cial general elections) immediately preceding the 
enactment of the plan, except that if a State 
conducts a primary election for the office of 
Senator which is open to candidates of all polit-
ical parties, the primary election shall be used 
instead of the general election and the number 
of districts carried by a party’s candidates for 
the office of Senator shall be determined on the 
basis of the combined vote share of all can-
didates in the election who are affiliated with 
such party. 
(ii) Determine, for each of the 4 elections as-
sessed under clause (i), whether the number of 
districts that would have been carried by any 
party’s candidate as determined under clause (i) 
results in partisan advantage or disadvantage 
in excess of the applicable threshold described in 
subparagraph (C). The degree of partisan ad-
vantage or disadvantage shall be determined by 
one or more standard quantitative measures of 
partisan fairness that— 
(I) use a party’s share of the statewide vote to 
calculate a corresponding benchmark share of 
seats; and 
(II) measure the amount by which the share of 
seats the party’s candidates would have won in 
the election involved exceeds that benchmark 
share of seats. 
(C) APPLICABLE THRESHOLD DESCRIBED.—The 
applicable threshold described in this subpara-
graph is, with respect to a State and a number 
of seats, the greater of— 
(i) an amount equal to 7 percent of the num-
ber of congressional districts in the State; or 
(ii) one congressional district. 
(D) DESCRIPTION OF QUANTITATIVE MEASURES; 
PROHIBITING
ROUNDING.—In carrying out this 
subsection— 
(i) the standard quantitative measures of par-
tisan fairness used by the court may include the 
simplified efficiency gap but may not include 
strict proportionality; and 
(ii) the court may not round any number. 
(E) PRESUMPTION
OF
VIOLATION.—A plan is 
presumed to violate paragraph (1) if, on the 
basis of at least one standard quantitative meas-
ure of partisan fairness, it exceeds the applica-
ble threshold described in subparagraph (C) 
with respect to 2 or more of the 4 elections as-
sessed under subparagraph (B). 
(F) STAY OF USE OF PLAN.—Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this title, in any action 
under this paragraph, the following rules shall 
apply: 
(i) Upon filing of a motion under subpara-
graph (A), a State’s use of the plan which is the 
subject of the motion shall be automatically 
stayed pending resolution of such motion. 
(ii) If after considering the motion, the court 
rules that the plan is presumed under subpara-
graph (B) to violate paragraph (1), a State may 
not use such plan until and unless the court 
which is carrying out the determination of the 
effect of the plan under paragraph (2) deter-
mines that, notwithstanding the presumptive 
violation, the plan does not violate paragraph 
(1). 
(G) NO EFFECT ON OTHER ASSESSMENTS.—The 
absence of a presumption of a violation with re-
spect to a redistricting plan as determined under 
this paragraph shall not affect the determina-
tion of the effect or intent of the plan under this 
section. 
(4) DETERMINATION OF INTENT.—A court may 
rely on all available evidence when determining 
whether a redistricting plan was drawn with the 
intent to materially favor or disfavor a political 
party, including evidence of the partisan effects 
of a plan, the degree of support the plan re-
ceived from members of the entity responsible for 
developing and adopting the plan, and whether 
the processes leading to development and adop-
tion of the plan were transparent and equally 
open to all members of the entity and to the 
public. 
(5) NO
VIOLATION
BASED
ON
CERTAIN
CRI-
TERIA.—No redistricting plan shall be found to 
be in violation of paragraph (1) because of the 
proper application of the criteria set forth in 
paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (b), un-
less one or more alternative plans could have 
complied with such paragraphs without having 
the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring a 
political party. 
(d) FACTORS
PROHIBITED
FROM
CONSIDER-
ATION.—In developing the redistricting plan for 
the State, the State may not take into consider-
ation any of the following factors, except as 
necessary to comply with the criteria described 
in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b), 
to achieve partisan fairness and comply with 
subsection (b), and to enable the redistricting 
plan to be measured against the external metrics 
described in section 5004(c): 
(1) The residence of any Member of the House 
of Representatives or candidate. 
(2) The political party affiliation or voting 
history of the population of a district. 
(e) ADDITIONAL CRITERIA.—A State may not 
rely upon criteria, districting principles, or

ing the vote the State has released a written 
evaluation that measures each such plan 
against external metrics which cover the criteria 
set forth in section 5003(b), including the impact 
of the plan on the ability of members of a class 
of citizens protected by the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to elect candidates

quirements of this title not later than 45 days 
after the effective date of this title. 
(b) DEVELOPMENT OF PLAN BY COURT IN CASE 
OF MISSED DEADLINE.—If a State has not en-
acted a final congressional redistricting plan by 
the applicable deadline under subsection (a), or 
it appears reasonably likely that a State will 
fail to enact a final congressional redistricting 
plan by such deadline— 
(1) any citizen of the State may file an action 
in the United States district court for the appli-
cable venue asking the district court to assume 
jurisdiction; 
(2) the United States district court for the ap-
plicable venue, acting through a 3-judge court

a final redistricting plan for the State prior to 
the expiration of the applicable deadline set 
forth in subsection (a). 
(d) 
PROCEDURES
FOR
DEVELOPMENT
OF 
PLAN.— 
(1) CRITERIA.—In developing a redistricting 
plan for a State under this section, the court 
shall adhere to the same terms and conditions 
that applied (or that would have applied, as the 
case may be) to the development of a plan by 
the State under section 5003. 
(2) ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND RECORDS.— 
The court shall have access to any information, 
data, software, or other records and material 
that was used (or that would have been used, as 
the case may be) by the State in carrying out its 
duties under this title. 
(3) HEARING; PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.—In de-
veloping a redistricting plan for a State, the 
court shall— 
(A) hold one or more evidentiary hearings at 
which interested members of the public may ap-
pear and be heard and present testimony, in-
cluding expert testimony, in accordance with 
the rules of the court; and 
(B) consider other submissions and comments 
by the public, including proposals for redis-
tricting plans to cover the entire State or any 
portion of the State. 
(4) USE OF SPECIAL MASTER.—To assist in the 
development and publication of a redistricting 
plan for a State under this section, the court 
may appoint a special master to make rec-
ommendations to the court on possible plans for 
the State. 
(e) PUBLICATION OF PLAN.— 
(1) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF INITIAL PLAN.— 
Upon completing the development of one or more 
initial redistricting plans, the court shall make 
the plans available to the public at no cost, and 
shall also make available the underlying data 
used to develop the plans and a written evalua-
tion of the plans against external metrics (as de-
scribed in section 5004(c)). 
(2) PUBLICATION OF FINAL PLAN.—At any time 
after the expiration of the 14-day period which 
begins on the date the court makes the plans 
available to the public under paragraph (1), and 
taking into consideration any submissions and 
comments by the public which are received dur-
ing such period, the court shall develop and 
publish the final redistricting plan for the State. 
(f) USE OF INTERIM PLAN.—In the event that 
the court is not able to develop and publish a 
final redistricting plan for the State with suffi-
cient time for an upcoming election to proceed, 
the court may develop and publish an interim 
redistricting plan which shall serve as the redis-
tricting plan for the State until the court devel-
ops and publishes a final plan in accordance 
with this section. Nothing in this subsection 
may be construed to limit or otherwise affect the 
authority or discretion of the court to develop 
and publish the final redistricting plan, includ-
ing the discretion to make any changes the 
court deems necessary to an interim redistricting 
plan. 
(g) APPEALS.—Review on appeal of any final 
or interim plan adopted by the court in accord-
ance with this section shall be governed by the 
appellate process in section 5006. 
(h) STAY OF STATE PROCEEDINGS.—The filing 
of an action under this section shall act as a 
stay of any proceedings in State court with re-
spect to the State’s congressional redistricting 
plan unless otherwise ordered by the court. 
SEC. 5006. CIVIL ENFORCEMENT.

stitution or Federal law, including this title, 
with respect to the State’s congressional redis-
tricting, may bring a civil action in the United 
States district court for the applicable venue for 
such relief as may be appropriate to remedy the 
failure. 
(B) SPECIAL RULE FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO 
PARTISAN
ADVANTAGE.—For purposes of sub-
paragraph (A), a person who is aggrieved by the 
failure of a State to meet the requirements of 
section 5003(c) may include—

alleges was drawn in a manner that contributes 
to a violation of such section. 
(C) NO AWARDING OF DAMAGES TO PREVAILING 
PARTY.—Except for an award of attorney’s fees 
under subsection (d), a court in a civil action 
under this section shall not award the pre-
vailing party any monetary damages, compen-
satory, punitive, or otherwise. 
(3) DELIVERY

shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and de-
termine claims asserting that a congressional re-
districting plan violates the requirements of the 
Constitution or Federal law, including this title. 
The applicable venue for such an action shall be 
the United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia or for the judicial district in which 
the capital of the State is located, as selected by 
the person bringing the action. In a civil action 
that includes a claim that a redistricting plan is

States judicial district where a defendant re-
sides, is found, or has an agent, or in the United 
States judicial district in which the capital of 
the State is located. 
(5) USE
OF
3-JUDGE

heard by a 3-judge court convened pursuant to 
section 2284 of title 28, United States Code. 
(6) REVIEW OF FINAL DECISION.—A final deci-
sion in an action brought under this section 
shall be reviewable on appeal by the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit, which shall hear the matter sit-
ting en banc. There shall be no right of appeal 
in such proceedings to any other court of ap-
peals. Such appeal shall be taken by the filing 
of a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry 
of the final decision. A final decision by the 
Court of Appeals may be reviewed by the Su-
preme Court of the United States by writ of cer-
tiorari. 
(b) EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION.—In any ac-
tion brought under this section, it shall be the 
duty of the district court, the United States 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United 
States (if it chooses to hear the action) to ad-
vance on the docket and to expedite to the 
greatest possible extent the disposition of the ac-
tion and appeal. 
(c) REMEDIES.— 
(1) ADOPTION OF REPLACEMENT PLAN.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—If the district court in an 
action under this section finds that the congres-
sional redistricting plan of a State violates, in 
whole or in part, the requirements of this title— 
(i) the court shall adopt a replacement con-
gressional redistricting plan for the State in ac-
cordance with the process set forth in section 
5005; or 
(ii) if circumstances warrant and no delay to 
an upcoming regularly scheduled election for 
the House of Representatives in the State would 
result, the district court, in its discretion, may 
allow a State to develop and propose a remedial 
congressional redistricting plan for review by 
the court to determine whether the plan is in 
compliance with this title, except that— 
(I) the State may not develop and propose a 
remedial plan under this clause if the court de-
termines that the congressional redistricting 
plan of the State was enacted with discrimina-
tory intent in violation of the Constitution or 
section 5003(b); and 
(II) nothing in this clause may be construed to 
permit a State to use such a remedial plan 
which has not been approved by the court. 
(B) PROHIBITING USE OF PLANS IN VIOLATION 
OF REQUIREMENTS.—No court shall order a State 
to use a congressional redistricting plan which 
violates, in whole or in part, the requirements of 
this title, or to conduct an election under terms 
and conditions which violate, in whole or in 
part, the requirements of this title. 
(C) SPECIAL RULE IN CASE FINAL ADJUDICATION 
NOT EXPECTED WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF ELECTION.— 
(i) DUTY OF COURT.—If final adjudication of 
an action under this section is not reasonably 
expected to be completed at least 3 months prior 
to the next regularly scheduled primary election 
for the House of Representatives in the State, 
the district court shall— 
(I) develop, adopt, and order the use of an in-
terim congressional redistricting plan in accord-
ance with section 5005(f) to address any claims 
under this title for which a party seeking relief 
has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of 
success; or 
(II) order adjustments to the timing of primary 
elections for the House of Representatives and 
other related deadlines, as needed, to allow suf-
ficient opportunity for adjudication of the mat-
ter and adoption of a remedial or replacement 
plan for use in the next regularly scheduled 
general elections for the House of Representa-
tives. 
(ii) PROHIBITING FAILURE TO ACT ON GROUNDS 
OF PENDENCY OF ELECTION.—The court may not 
refuse to take any action described in clause (i) 
on the grounds of the pendency of the next elec-
tion held in the State or the potential for dis-
ruption, confusion, or additional burdens with 
respect to the administration of the election in 
the State. 
(2) 
NO
STAY
PENDING
APPEAL.—Notwith-
standing the appeal of an order finding that a 
congressional redistricting plan of a State vio-
lates, in whole or in part, the requirements of 
this title, no stay shall issue which shall bar the 
development or adoption of a replacement or re-
medial plan under this subsection, as may be di-
rected by the district court, pending such ap-
peal. If such a replacement or remedial plan has 
been adopted, no appellate court may stay or 
otherwise enjoin the use of such plan during the 
pendency of an appeal, except upon an order 
holding, based on the record, that adoption of 
such plan was an abuse of discretion. 
(3) SPECIAL
AUTHORITY
OF
COURT
OF
AP-
PEALS.— 
(A) ORDERING
OF
NEW
REMEDIAL
PLAN.—If, 
upon consideration of an appeal under this 
title, the Court of Appeals determines that a 
plan does not comply with the requirements of 
this title, it shall direct that the District Court 
promptly develop a new remedial plan with as-
sistance of a special master for consideration by 
the Court of Appeals. 
(B) FAILURE
OF
DISTRICT
COURT
TO
TAKE 
TIMELY
ACTION.—If, at any point during the 
pendency of an action under this section, the 
District Court fails to take action necessary to 
permit resolution of the case prior to the next 
regularly scheduled election for the House of 
Representatives in the State or fails to grant the 
relief described in paragraph (1)(C), any party 
may seek a writ of mandamus from the Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
The Court of Appeals shall have jurisdiction 
over the motion for a writ of mandamus and 
shall establish an expedited briefing and hear-
ing schedule for resolution of the motion. If the 
Court of Appeals determines that a writ should 
be granted, the Court of Appeals shall take any 
action necessary, including developing a con-
gressional redistricting plan with assistance of a 
special master to ensure that a remedial plan is 
adopted in time for use in the next regularly 
scheduled election for the House of Representa-
tives in the State. 
(4) EFFECT OF ENACTMENT OF REPLACEMENT 
PLAN.—A State’s enactment of a redistricting 
plan which replaces a plan which is the subject 
of an action under this section shall not be con-
strued to limit or otherwise affect the authority 
of the court to adjudicate or grant relief with re-
spect to any claims or issues not addressed by 
the replacement plan, including claims that the 
plan which is the subject of the action was en-
acted, in whole or in part, with discriminatory 
intent, or claims to consider whether relief 
should be granted under section 3(c) of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10302(c)) based 
on the plan which is the subject of the action.

costs. 
(e) RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.— 
(1) RIGHTS
AND
REMEDIES
ADDITIONAL
TO 
OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.—The rights and 
remedies established by this section are in addi-
tion to all other rights and remedies provided by 
law, and neither the rights and remedies estab-
lished by this section nor any other provision of 
this title shall supersede, restrict, or limit the 
application of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10301 et seq.). 
(2) VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965.—Nothing in 
this title authorizes or requires conduct that is 
prohibited by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10301 et seq.). 
(f) LEGISLATIVE PRIVILEGE.—No person, legis-
lature, or State may claim legislative privilege 
under either State or Federal law in a civil ac-
tion brought under this section or in any other 
legal challenge, under either State or Federal 
law, to a redistricting plan enacted under this 
title.

an intervenor, by filing, in the district court for 
an applicable venue under this section, a notice 
of removal signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure containing a 
short and plain statement of the grounds for re-
moval. Consent of parties shall not be required 
for removal. 
(2) CLAIMS NOT WITHIN THE ORIGINAL OR SUP-
PLEMENTAL JURISDICTION.—If a civil action re-
moved in accordance with paragraph (1) con-
tains claims not within the original or supple-
mental jurisdiction of the district court, the dis-
trict court shall sever all such claims and re-
mand them to the State court from which the 
action was removed. 
SEC. 5007. NO EFFECT ON ELECTIONS FOR STATE 
AND LOCAL OFFICE. 
Nothing in this title or in any amendment 
made by this title may be construed to affect the 
manner in which a State carries out elections 
for State or local office, including the process by 
which a State establishes the districts used in 
such elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H125 
January 13, 2022 
SEC. 5008. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—This title and the amend-
ments made by this title shall apply on the date 
of enactment of this title. 
(b) APPLICATION
TO CONGRESSIONAL REDIS-
TRICTING PLANS RESULTING FROM 2020 DECEN-
NIAL CENSUS.—Notwithstanding subsection (a), 
this title and the amendments made by this title, 
other than section 5004, shall apply with respect 
to each congressional redistricting plan enacted 
pursuant to the notice of apportionment trans-
mitted to the President on April 26, 2021, with-
out regard to whether or not a State enacted 
such a plan prior to the date of the enactment 
of this Act. 
TITLE VI—CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
TRANSPARENCY 
Subtitle A—DISCLOSE Act 
SEC. 6001. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy 
Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending 
in Elections Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘DISCLOSE Act 
of 2021’’. 
SEC. 6002. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Campaign finance disclosure is a narrowly 
tailored and minimally restrictive means to ad-
vance substantial government interests, includ-
ing fostering an informed electorate capable of 
engaging in self-government and holding their 
elected officials accountable, detecting and de-
terring quid pro quo corruption, and identifying 
information necessary to enforce other cam-
paign finance laws, including campaign con-
tribution limits and the prohibition on foreign 
money in U.S. campaigns. To further these sub-
stantial interests, campaign finance disclosure 
must be timely and complete, and must disclose 
the true and original source of money given, 
transferred, and spent to influence Federal elec-
tions. Current law does not meet this objective 
because corporations and other entities that the 
Supreme Court has permitted to spend money to 
influence Federal elections are subject to few if 
any transparency requirements. 
(2) As the Supreme Court recognized in its per 
curiam opinion in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 
(1976), ‘‘disclosure requirements certainly in 
most applications appear to be the least restric-
tive means of curbing the evils of campaign ig-
norance and corruption that Congress found to 
exist.’’ Buckley, 424 U.S. at 68. In Citizens 
United v. FEC, the Court reiterated that ‘‘dis-
closure is a less restrictive alternative to more 
comprehensive regulations of speech.’’ 558 U.S. 
310, 369 (2010). 
(3) No subsequent decision has called these 
holdings into question, including the Court’s de-
cision in Americans for Prosperity Foundation 
v. Bonta, 141 S. Ct. 2373 (2021). That case did 
not involve campaign finance disclosure, and 
the Court did not overturn its longstanding rec-
ognition of the substantial interests furthered by 
such disclosure. 
(4) Campaign finance disclosure is also essen-
tial to enforce the Federal Election Campaign 
Act’s prohibition on contributions by and solici-
tations of foreign nationals. See section 319 of 
the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 
U.S.C. 30121). 
(5) Congress should close loopholes allowing 
spending by foreign nationals in domestic elec-
tions. For example, in 2021, the Federal Election 
Commission, the independent Federal agency 
charged with protecting the integrity of the Fed-
eral campaign finance process, found reason to 
believe and conciliated a matter where an expe-
rienced political consultant knowingly and will-
fully violated Federal law by soliciting a con-
tribution from a foreign national by offering to 
transmit a $2,000,000 contribution to a super 
PAC through his company and two 501(c)(4) or-
ganizations, to conceal the origin of the funds. 
This scheme was only unveiled after appearing 
in a The Telegraph UK article and video cap-
turing the solicitation. See Conciliation Agree-
ment, MURs 7165 & 7196 (Great America PAC, et 
al.), date June 28, 2021; Factual and Legal 
Analysis, MURs 7165 & 7196 (Jesse Benton), 
dated Mar. 2, 2021.

‘‘(3) SPECIAL

TRANSFERS 
AMONG AFFILIATES.— 
‘‘(A) SPECIAL RULE.—A transfer of an amount 
by one covered organization to another covered 
organization which is treated as a transfer be-
tween affiliates under subparagraph (C) shall be 
considered a covered transfer by the covered or-
ganization which transfers the amount only if

year by such covered organization to that same 
covered organization is equal to or greater than 
$50,000. 
‘‘(B) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF CERTAIN 
PAYMENTS
AMONG
AFFILIATES.—In determining 
the amount of a transfer between affiliates for 
purposes of subparagraph (A), to the extent that 
the transfer consists of funds attributable to 
dues, fees, or assessments which are paid by in-
dividuals on a regular, periodic basis in accord-
ance with a per-individual calculation which is

other organization; 
‘‘(ii) the governing board of the organization 
includes persons who are specifically designated 
representatives of the other organization or are 
members of the governing board, officers, or

quirement’’. 
(c) REGULATIONS.—Not later than 6 months 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Federal Election Commission shall promulgate 
regulations relating the application of the ex-
emption under section 324(a)(3)(C) of the Fed-
eral Election Campaign Act of 1971 (as added by 
paragraph (1)). Such regulations— 
(1) shall require that the legal burden of es-
tablishing eligibility for such exemption is upon 
the organization required to make the report re-
quired under section 324(a)(1) of such Act (as 
added by paragraph (1)), and 
(2) shall be consistent with the principles ap-
plied in Citizens United v. Federal Election 
Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). 
SEC. 6012. REPORTING OF FEDERAL JUDICIAL 
NOMINATION DISBURSEMENTS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) A fair and impartial judiciary is critical 
for our democracy and crucial to maintain the 
faith of the people of the United States in the 
justice system. As the Supreme Court held in 
Caperton v. Massey, ‘‘there is a serious risk of 
actual bias—based on objective and reasonable 
perceptions—when a person with a personal 
stake in a particular case had a significant and 
disproportionate influence in placing the judge 
on the case.’’ ( Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal 
Co., 556 U.S. 868, 884 (2009)). 
(2) Public trust in government is at a historic 
low. According to polling, most Americans be-
lieve that corporations have too much power 
and influence in politics and the courts. 
(3) The prevalence and pervasiveness of dark 
money drives public concern about corruption in 
politics and the courts. Dark money is funding 
for organizations and political activities that 
cannot be traced to actual donors. It is made

possible by loopholes in our tax laws and regu-
lations, weak oversight by the Internal Revenue 
Service, and donor-friendly court decisions. 
(4) Under current law, ‘‘social welfare’’ orga-
nizations and business leagues can use funds to 
influence elections so long as political activity is 
not their ‘‘primary’’ activity. Super PACs can 
accept and spend unlimited contributions from 
any non-foreign source. These groups can spend 
tens of millions of dollars on political activities. 
Such dark money groups spent an estimated 
$1,050,000,000 in the 2020 election cycle. 
(5) Dark money is used to shape judicial deci-
sion-making. This can take many forms, akin to 
agency capture: influencing judicial selection by 
controlling who gets nominated and funding 
candidate advertisements; creating public rela-
tions campaigns aimed at mobilizing the judici-
ary around particular issues; and drafting law 
review articles, amicus briefs, and other prod-
ucts which tell judges how to decide a given 
case and provide ready-made arguments for 
willing judges to adopt. 
(6) Over the past decade, nonprofit organiza-
tions that do not disclose their donors have 
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to influ-
ence the nomination and confirmation process 
for Federal judges. One organization alone has 
spent nearly $40,000,000 on advertisements sup-
porting or opposing Supreme Court nominees 
since 2016. 
(7) Anonymous money spent on judicial nomi-
nations is not subject to any disclosure require-
ments. Federal election laws only regulate con-
tributions and expenditures relating to electoral 
politics; thus, expenditures, contributions, and 
advocacy efforts for Federal judgeships are not 
covered under the Federal Election Campaign 
Act of 1971. Without more disclosure, the public 
has no way of knowing whether the people 
spending money supporting or opposing judicial 
nominations have business before the courts. 
(8) Congress and the American people have a 
compelling interest in knowing who is funding 
these campaigns to select and confirm judges to 
lifetime appointments on the Federal bench. 
(b) REPORTING.—Section 324 of the Federal 
Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30126), 
as amended by section 6011, is amended by re-
designating subsection (g) as subsection (h) and

communications— 
‘‘(i) the dollar amounts in paragraphs (1) and 
(2) of subsection (a) shall be applied separately

campaign-related disbursements; 
‘‘(ii) the election reporting cycle shall be the 
calendar year in which the disbursement for the 
Federal judicial nomination communication is

ed as references to a nominee for a Federal 
judge or justice;

(a)(2)(C) shall be treated as a reference to the 
nomination of such nominee.

didate. 
‘‘(C) INTENT NOT REQUIRED.—A disbursement 
for an item described in subparagraph (A) shall 
be treated as a disbursement for a Federal judi-
cial nomination communication regardless of the 
intent of the person making the disbursement.’’. 
SEC. 6013. COORDINATION WITH FINCEN.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H129 
January 13, 2022 
Subtitle B—Honest Ads 
SEC. 6101. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Honest Ads 
Act’’. 
SEC. 6102. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this subtitle is to enhance the 
integrity of American democracy and national 
security by improving disclosure requirements 
for online political advertisements in order to 
uphold the Supreme Court’s well-established 
standard that the electorate bears the right to be 
fully informed. 
SEC. 6103. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform 
Act of 2002 (Public Law 107–155) became law, es-
tablishing disclosure requirements for political 
advertisements distributed from a television or 
radio broadcast station or provider of cable or 
satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court 
upheld regulations on electioneering commu-
nications established under the Act, noting that 
such requirements ‘‘provide the electorate with 
information and insure that the voters are fully 
informed about the person or group who is 
speaking.’’ The Court reaffirmed this conclusion 
in 2010 by an 8–1 vote. 
(2) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Elec-
tion Commission, the independent Federal agen-
cy charged with protecting the integrity of the 
Federal campaign finance process, noted that 18 
percent of all Americans cited the internet as 
their leading source of news about the 2004 
Presidential election. By contrast, Gallup and 
the Knight Foundation found in 2020 that the 
majority of Americans, 58 percent, got most of 
their news about elections online. 
(3) According to a study from Borrell Associ-
ates, in 2016, $1,415,000,000 was spent on online 
advertising, more than quadruple the amount in 
2012. 
(4) Effective and complete transparency for 
voters must include information about the true 
and original source of money given, transferred, 
and spent on political advertisements made on-
line. 
(5) Requiring the disclosure of this informa-
tion is a necessary and narrowly tailored means 
to inform the voting public of who is behind dig-
ital advertising disseminated to influence their 
votes and to enable the Federal Election Com-
mission and the Department of Justice to detect 
and prosecute illegal foreign spending on local, 
State, and Federal elections and other campaign 
finance violations. 
(6) Paid advertising on large online platforms 
is different from advertising placed on other 
common media in terms of the comparatively low 
cost of reaching large numbers of people, the 
availability of sophisticated microtargeting, and 
the ease with which online advertisers, particu-
larly those located outside the United States, 
can evade disclosure requirements. Requiring 
large online platforms to maintain public files of 
information about the online political ads they 
disseminate is the best and least restrictive 
means to ensure the voting public has complete 
information about who is trying to influence 
their votes and to aid enforcement of other laws, 
including the prohibition on foreign money in 
domestic campaigns. 
(7) The reach of a few large internet plat-
forms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or 
cable provider—has greatly facilitated the scope 
and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns. 
For instance, the largest platform has over 
210,000,000 American users—over 160,000,000 of 
them on a daily basis. By contrast, the largest 
cable television provider has 22,430,000 sub-
scribers, while the largest satellite television 
provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And the 
most-watched television broadcast in United 
States history had 118,000,000 viewers. 
(8) The public nature of broadcast television, 
radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity 
for any political advertisement. These commu-
nications are accessible to the press, fact-check-
ers, and political opponents. This creates strong 
disincentives for a candidate to disseminate ma-
terially false, inflammatory, or contradictory 
messages to the public. Social media platforms, 
in contrast, can target portions of the electorate 
with direct, ephemeral advertisements often on 
the basis of private information the platform has 
on individuals, enabling political advertisements 
that are contradictory, racially or socially in-
flammatory, or materially false. 
(9) According to comscore, 2 companies own 8 
of the 10 most popular smart phone applications 
as of June 2017, including the most popular so-
cial media and email services which deliver in-
formation and news to users without requiring 
proactivity by the user. Those same 2 companies 
accounted for 99 percent of revenue growth from 
digital advertising in 2016, including 77 percent 
of gross spending. 79 percent of online Ameri-
cans—representing 68 percent of all Americans— 
use the single largest social network, while 66 
percent of these users are most likely to get their 
news from that site. 
(10) Large social media platforms are the only 
entities in possession of certain key data related 
to paid online ads, including the exact audience 
targeted by those ads and their number of im-
pressions. Such information, which cannot be 
reliably disclosed by the purchasers of ads, is 
extremely useful for informing the electorate, 
guarding against corruption, and aiding in the 
enforcement of existing campaign finance regu-
lations. 
(11) Paid advertisements on social media plat-
forms have served as critical tools for foreign 
online influence campaigns—even those that 
rely on large amounts of unpaid content—be-
cause such ads allow foreign actors to test the 
effectiveness of different messages, expose their 
messages to audiences who have not sought out 
such content, and recruit audiences for future 
campaigns and posts. 
(12) In testimony before the Senate Select 
Committee 
on 
Intelligence 
titled, 
‘‘Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active 
Measures and Influence Campaigns’’, multiple 
expert 
witnesses 
testified 
that 
while 
the 
disinformation tactics of foreign adversaries 
have not necessarily changed, social media serv-
ices now provide ‘‘platform[s] practically pur-
pose-built for active measures[.]’’ Similarly, as 
Gen. Keith B. Alexander (RET.), the former Di-
rector of the National Security Agency, testified, 
during the Cold War ‘‘if the Soviet Union 
sought to manipulate information flow, it would 
have to do so principally through its own propa-
ganda outlets or through active measures that 
would generate specific news: planting of leaf-
lets, inciting of violence, creation of other false 
materials and narratives. But the news itself 
was hard to manipulate because it would have 
required actual control of the organs of media, 
which took long-term efforts to penetrate. 
Today, however, because the clear majority of 
the 
information 
on 
social 
media 
sites 
is 
uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of 
information sources and other sites that can re-
inforce information, there is an increasing like-
lihood that the information available to average 
consumers may be inaccurate (whether inten-
tionally or otherwise) and may be more easily 
manipulable than in prior eras.’’. 
(13) On November 24, 2016, The Washington 
Post reported findings from 2 teams of inde-
pendent researchers that concluded Russians 
‘‘exploited American-made technology platforms 
to attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vul-
nerable moment *** as part of a broadly effec-
tive strategy of sowing distrust in U.S. democ-
racy and its leaders.’’. 
(14) On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Di-
rector of National Intelligence published a re-
port titled ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and In-
tentions in Recent U.S. Elections’’, noting that 
‘‘Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an 
influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US 
presidential election * * *’’. Moscow’s influence 
campaign followed a Russian messaging strat-
egy that blends covert intelligence operation— 
such as cyber activity—with overt efforts by 
Russian 
Government 
agencies, 
state-funded 
media, third-party intermediaries, and paid so-
cial media users or ‘‘trolls’’. 
(15) On September 6, 2017, the nation’s largest 
social media platform disclosed that between 
June 2015 and May 2017, Russian entities pur-
chased $100,000 in political advertisements, pub-
lishing roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake ac-
counts associated with the Internet Research 
Agency, a pro-Kremlin organization. According 
to the company, the ads purchased focused ‘‘on 
amplifying divisive social and political messages 
***’’. 
(16) Findings from a 2017 study on the manip-
ulation of public opinion through social media 
conducted by the Computational Propaganda 
Research Project at the Oxford Internet Insti-
tute found that the Kremlin is using pro-Rus-
sian bots to manipulate public discourse to a 
highly targeted audience. With a sample of 
nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers found that 
in the 2016 election’s 3 decisive States, propa-
ganda constituted 40 percent of the sampled 
election-related tweets that went to Pennsylva-
nians, 34 percent to Michigan voters, and 30 
percent to those in Wisconsin. In other swing 
States, the figure reached 42 percent in Mis-
souri, 41 percent in Florida, 40 percent in North 
Carolina, 38 percent in Colorado, and 35 percent 
in Ohio. 
(17) 2018 reporting by the Washington Post es-
timated that paid Russian ads received more 
than 37,000,000 impressions in 2016 and 2017. 
(18) A 2019 Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence’s Report on Russian Active Meas-
ures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 
U.S. Election Volume 2: Russia’s Use of Social 
Media with Additional Views, the Committee 
recommended ‘‘that Congress examine legislative 
approaches to ensuring Americans know the 
sources of online political advertisements. The 
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 requires 
political advertisements on television, radio and 
satellite to disclose the sponsor of the advertise-
ment. The same requirements should apply on-
line. This will also help to ensure that the IRA 
or any similarly situated actors cannot use paid 
advertisements for purposes of foreign inter-
ference.’’. 
(19) A 2020 study by researchers at New York 
University found undisclosed political advertise-
ment purchases on a large social media platform 
by a Chinese state media company in violation 
of that platform’s supposed prohibitions on for-
eign spending on ads of social, national, or elec-
toral importance. 
(20) The same study also found that ‘‘there 
are persistent issues with advertisers failing to 
disclose political ads’’ and that in one social 
media platform’s political ad archive, 68,879 
pages (54.6 percent of pages with political ads 
included in the archive) never provided a disclo-
sure. Overall, there were 357,099 ads run on that 
platforms without a disclosure, accounting for 
at least $37,000,000 in spending on political ads. 
(21) A 2020 report by the bipartisan and bi-
cameral U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission 
found that ‘‘Although foreign nationals are 
banned from contributing to U.S. political cam-
paigns, they are still allowed to purchase U.S. 
political advertisements online, making the 
internet a fertile environment for conducting a 
malign influence campaign to undermine Amer-
ican elections.’’ The Commission concluded that 
Russian interference in the 2016 election was 
and still is possible, ‘‘because the FECA, which 
establishes rules for transparency in television, 
radio, and print media political advertising, has 
not been amended to extend the same political 
advertising requirements to internet platforms,’’ 
and that ‘‘[a]pplying these standards across all 
media of communication would, among other 
things, increase transparency of funding for po-
litical advertisements, which would in turn 
strengthen regulators’ ability to reduce improper 
foreign influence in our elections.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H130 
January 13, 2022 
(22) On March 16, 2021, the Office of the Di-
rector of National Intelligence released the de-
classified Intelligence Community assessment of 
foreign threats to the 2020 U.S. Federal elec-
tions. The declassified report found: ‘‘Through-
out the election cycle, Russia’s online influence 
actors sought to affect U.S. public perceptions of 
the candidates, as well as advance Moscow’s 
longstanding goals of undermining confidence 
in US election processes and increasing socio-
political divisions among the American people.’’ 
The report also determined that Iran sought to 
influence the election by ‘‘creating and ampli-
fying social media content that criticized [can-
didates].’’ 
(23) According to a Wall Street Journal report 
in April 2021, voluntary ad libraries operated by 
major platforms rely on foreign governments to 
self-report political ad purchases. These ad- 
buys, including those diminishing major human 
rights violations like the Uighur genocide, are 
under-reported by foreign government pur-
chasers, with no substantial oversight or reper-
cussions from the platforms. 
(24) Multiple reports have indicated that on-
line ads have become a key vector for strategic 
influence by the People’s Republic of China. An 
April 2021 Wall Street Journal report noted that 
the Chinese government and Chinese state- 
owned enterprises are major purchasers of ads 
on the U.S.’s largest social media platform, in-
cluding to advance Chinese propaganda. 
(25) 
Large 
online 
platforms 
have 
made 
changes to their policies intended to make it 
harder for foreign actors to purchase political 
ads. However, these private actions have not 
been taken by all platforms, have not been reli-
ably enforced, and are subject to immediate 
change at the discretion of the platforms. 
(26) The Federal Election Commission has 
failed to take action to address online political 
advertisements and current regulations on polit-
ical advertisements do not provide sufficient 
transparency to uphold the public’s right to be 
fully informed about political advertisements 
made online. 
SEC. 6104. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the dramatic increase in digital political 
advertisements, and the growing centrality of 
online platforms in the lives of Americans, re-
quires the Congress and the Federal Election 
Commission to take meaningful action to ensure 
that laws and regulations provide the account-
ability and transparency that is fundamental to 
our democracy; 
(2) free and fair elections require both trans-
parency and accountability which give the pub-
lic a right to know the true sources of funding 
for political advertisements, be they foreign or 
domestic, in order to make informed political 
choices and hold elected officials accountable; 
and 
(3) transparency of funding for political ad-
vertisements is essential to enforce other cam-
paign finance laws, including the prohibition on 
campaign spending by foreign nationals.

sition on a legislative or policy matter (includ-
ing urging the candidate or committee to adopt

who makes a payment for a covered communica-
tion, as defined in subsection (e), is a coordi-
nated spender under paragraph (2) with respect 
to the candidate as described in paragraph (2), 
the payment for the covered communication is 
made in cooperation, consultation, or concert

‘‘(2) COORDINATED
SPENDER
DEFINED.—For 
purposes of this subsection, the term ‘coordi-
nated spender’ means, with respect to a can-
didate or an authorized committee of a can-
didate, a person (other than a political com-
mittee of a political party) for which any of the 
following applies: 
‘‘(A) During the 4-year period ending on the 
date on which the person makes the payment, 
the person was directly or indirectly formed or 
established by or at the request or suggestion of, 
or with the encouragement of, the candidate 
(including an individual who later becomes a 
candidate) or committee or agents of the can-
didate or committee, including with the ap-
proval of the candidate or committee or agents 
of the candidate or committee. 
‘‘(B) The candidate or committee or any agent 
of the candidate or committee solicits funds, ap-
pears at a fundraising event, or engages in 
other fundraising activity on the person’s behalf 
during the election cycle involved, including by 
providing the person with names of potential 
donors or other lists to be used by the person in 
engaging in fundraising activity, regardless of 
whether the person pays fair market value for 
the names or lists provided. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, the term ‘election cycle’ means, 
with respect to an election for Federal office, 
the period beginning on the day after the date 
of the most recent general election for that office 
(or, if the general election resulted in a runoff 
election, the date of the runoff election) and 
ending on the date of the next general election 
for that office (or, if the general election re-
sulted in a runoff election, the date of the run-
off election). 
‘‘(C) The person is established, directed, or 
managed by the candidate or committee or by 
any person who, during the 4-year period end-
ing on the date on which the person makes the 
payment, has been employed or retained as a 
political, campaign media, or fundraising ad-
viser or consultant for the candidate or com-
mittee or for any other entity directly or indi-
rectly controlled by the candidate or committee, 
or has held a formal position with the candidate 
or committee (including a position as an em-
ployee of the office of the candidate at any time 
the candidate held any Federal, State, or local 
public office during the 4-year period).

services of any person who, during the 2-year 
period ending on the date on which the person 
makes the payment, has provided or is providing 
professional services relating to the campaign to 
the candidate or committee, unless the person 
providing the professional services used a fire-
wall or similar procedure in accordance with 
subsection (d). For purposes of this subpara-
graph, the term ‘professional services’ includes 
any services in support of the candidate’s or 
committee’s campaign activities, including ad-
vertising, message, strategy, policy, polling, al-
location of resources, fundraising, and cam-
paign operations, but does not include account-
ing or legal services. 
‘‘(E) The person is established, directed, or 
managed by a member of the immediate family 
of the candidate, or the person or any officer or 
agent of the person has had more than inci-
dental discussions about the candidate’s cam-
paign with a member of the immediate family of 
the candidate. For purposes of this subpara-
graph, the term ‘immediate family’ has the 
meaning given such term in section 9004(e) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

to a candidate who is clearly identified in the 
communication or an authorized committee of 
the candidate, the candidate’s opponent or an 
authorized committee of the candidate’s oppo-
nent, or a committee of a political party.

other 
discussions 
where 
nonpublic

election for Federal office or political committees 
are discussed. 
‘‘(E) The policy must prohibit each owner of 
an organization, and each executive, manager,

multaneously overseeing the work of employees 
and consultants who are subject to the firewall 
or procedure. 
‘‘(F) The policy must place restrictions on in-
ternal and external communications, including 
by establishing separate emailing lists, for em-
ployees, consultants, and clients who are sub-
ject to the firewall or procedure and those who

‘‘(G) The policy must require the person to es-
tablish separate files, including electronic file 
folders—

who are subject to the firewall or procedure and

consultants, and clients who are not subject to 
the firewall or procedure; and

ees, consultants, and clients who are subject to

the applicable requirements and obligations of 
this Act and the policy for all employees, con-
sultants, and clients.

lished and used a firewall or similar procedure 
which meets the requirements of paragraph (2) 
shall be determined to have made a payment in 
cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at 
the request or suggestion of, a candidate or com-
mittee in accordance with this section if specific 
information indicates that, notwithstanding the 
establishment and use of the firewall or similar 
procedure, information about the candidate’s or 
committee’s campaign plans, projects, activities, 
or needs that is material to the creation, produc-
tion, or distribution of the covered communica-
tion was used or conveyed to the person paying 
for the communication.

whether or not there is reason to believe that a 
person has committed, or is about to commit, a 
violation of this Act or chapter 95 or chapter 96 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and as to 
whether or not the Commission should either 
initiate an investigation of the matter or that 
the complaint should be dismissed. The general 
counsel shall promptly provide notification to 
the Commission of such determination and the 
reasons therefore, together with any written re-
sponse submitted under paragraph (1) by the 
person alleged to have committed the violation. 
Upon the expiration of the 30-day period which

mination shall take effect, unless during such 
30-day period the Commission, by vote of a ma-

plaint should be dismissed is overruled as pro-
vided under the previous sentence, the general

the case and replying to the brief of the general 
counsel. The general counsel shall promptly 
submit such brief to the Commission upon re-
ceipt.

submits a brief under subparagraph (B), upon 
the expiration of the 30-day period which begins

tion shall take effect, unless during such 30-day 
period the Commission, by vote of a majority of

at the time, overrules the general counsel’s de-
termination. If the determination by the general 
counsel that there is probable cause to believe

chapter 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
or if the determination by the general counsel 
that there is not probable cause that a person 
has committed or is about to commit such a vio-

ing at the end the following new subsection: 
‘‘(d) RESTRICTIONS
ON PERMITTED USES

for election for the office of Representative in,

part shall take effect on such date without re-
gard to whether the Commission has promul-
gated the regulations required under the pre-
vious sentence by such date. 
Subtitle C—Personal Use Services as 
Authorized Campaign Expenditures 
SEC. 8201. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited 
as the ‘‘Help America Run Act’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to 
entry before they can consider running for of-
fice to serve their communities. 
(2) Current law states that campaign funds 
cannot be spent on everyday expenses that 
would exist whether or not a candidate were 
running for office, like childcare and food. 
While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is 
to privilege the independently wealthy who 
want to run, because given the demands of run-
ning for office, candidates who must work to 
pay for childcare or to afford health insurance 
are effectively being left out of the process, even 
if they have sufficient support to mount a viable 
campaign. 
(3) Thus current practice favors those prospec-
tive candidates who do not need to rely on a 
regular paycheck to make ends meet. The con-
sequence is that everyday Americans who have 
firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable 
childcare, a safety net, or great public schools 
are less likely to get a seat at the table. This 
governance by the few is antithetical to the 
democratic experiment, but most importantly, 
when lawmakers do not share the concerns of 
everyday Americans, their policies reflect that. 
(4) These circumstances have contributed to a 
Congress that does not always reflect everyday 
Americans. The New York Times reported in 
2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives 
cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biog-
raphies. A 2015 survey by the Center for Respon-
sive Politics showed that the median net worth 
of lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013, or 
18 times the wealth of the typical American 
household. 
(5) These circumstances have also contributed 
to a governing body that does not reflect the na-
tion it serves. For instance, women are 51 per-
cent of the American population. Yet even with 
a record number of women serving in the One 
Hundred Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research 
Center notes that more than three out of four 
Members of this Congress are male. The Center 
for American Women And Politics found that 
one third of women legislators surveyed had 
been actively discouraged from running for of-
fice, often by political professionals. This type 
of discouragement, combined with the prohibi-
tions on using campaign funds for domestic 
needs like childcare, burdens that still fall dis-
proportionately on American women, particu-
larly disadvantages working mothers. These 
barriers may explain why only 10 women in his-
tory have given birth while serving in Congress, 
in spite of the prevalence of working parents in 
other professions. Yet working mothers and fa-
thers are best positioned to create policy that re-
flects the lived experience of most Americans. 
(6) Working mothers, those caring for their el-
derly parents, and young professionals who rely 
on their jobs for health insurance should have 
the freedom to run to serve the people of the 
United States. Their networks and net worth 
are simply not the best indicators of their 
strength as prospective public servants. In fact, 
helping ordinary Americans to run may create 
better policy for all Americans. 
(c) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this subtitle 
to ensure that all Americans who are otherwise 
qualified to serve this Nation are able to run for 
office, regardless of their economic status. By 
expanding permissible uses of campaign funds 
and providing modest assurance that testing a 
run for office will not cost one’s livelihood, the 
Help America Run Act will facilitate the can-
didacy of representatives who more accurately 
reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of 
everyday Americans.

CARE AND OTHER PERSONAL USE 
SERVICES 
AS 
AUTHORIZED 
CAM-
PAIGN EXPENDITURE. 
(a) PERSONAL USE SERVICES AS AUTHORIZED 
CAMPAIGN

Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 
U.S.C. 30114), as amended by section 8113, is

pation of the candidate in campaign-connected 
activities. 
‘‘(2) LIMITATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) LIMIT ON TOTAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS.— 
The total amount of payments made by an au-
thorized committee of a candidate for personal 
use services described in paragraph (3) may not

law, rule, or regulation on the amount of pay-
ments which may be made by the committee for 
the salary of the candidate (without regard to 
whether or not the committee makes payments 
to the candidate for that purpose). 
‘‘(B) CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN AMOUNT 
OF SALARY PAID TO CANDIDATE.—To the extent 
that an authorized committee of a candidate 
makes payments for the salary of the candidate, 
any limit on the amount of such payments 
which is applicable under any law, rule, or reg-
ulation shall be reduced by the amount of any 
payments made to or on behalf of the candidate 
for personal use services described in paragraph 
(3), other than personal use services described in 
subparagraph (D) of such paragraph. 
‘‘(C) EXCLUSION OF CANDIDATES WHO ARE OF-
FICEHOLDERS.—Paragraph (1) does not apply 
with respect to an authorized committee of a 
candidate who is a holder of Federal office.

‘‘(D) Health insurance premiums.’’. 
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made 
by this section shall take effect on the date of 
the enactment of this Act and shall take effect 
without regard to whether or not the Federal

tions to carry out such amendments.

30116(a)(2)(A)) is amended by striking ‘‘exceed 
$5,000’’ and inserting ‘‘exceed $5,000 or, in the

open to participation by members of a class of 
citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its 
members have less opportunity than other mem-
bers of the electorate to participate in the polit-
ical process and to elect representatives of their 
choice. The extent to which members of a pro-
tected class have been elected to office in the 
State or political subdivision is one circumstance 
which may be considered: Provided, That noth-
ing in this section establishes a right to have 
members of a protected class elected in numbers 
equal to their proportion in the population. The 
legal standard articulated in Thornburg v. 
Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), governs claims under 
this subsection. For purposes of this subsection 
a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) 
may include a cohesive coalition of members of 
different racial or language minority groups.’’. 
(c) VOTE DENIAL OR ABRIDGEMENT.—Section 2 
of such Act (52 U.S.C. 10301), as amended by 
subsections (a) and (b), is further amended by 
adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(c)(1) A violation of subsection (a) for vote 
denial or abridgment is established if the chal-
lenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure imposes a discriminatory 
burden on members of a class of citizens pro-
tected by subsection (a), meaning that— 
‘‘(A) members of the protected class face dis-
proportionate costs or burdens in complying 
with the qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure, considering the totality 
of the circumstances; and 
‘‘(B) such disproportionate costs or burdens 
are, at least in part, caused by or linked to so-
cial and historical conditions that have pro-
duced 
or 
currently 
produce 
discrimination 
against members of the protected class. 
‘‘(2) 
The 
challenged 
qualification, 
pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure need 
only be a but-for cause of the discriminatory 
burden or perpetuate a pre-existing discrimina-
tory burden. 
‘‘(3)(A) The totality of the circumstances for 
consideration relative to a violation of sub-
section (a) for vote denial or abridgment shall 
include the following factors, which, individ-
ually and collectively, show how a voting quali-
fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure can function to amplify the effects of 
past or present racial discrimination: 
‘‘(i) The history of official voting-related dis-
crimination in the State or political subdivision. 
‘‘(ii) The extent to which voting in the elec-
tions of the State or political subdivision is ra-
cially polarized. 
‘‘(iii) The extent to which members of the pro-
tected class bear the effects of discrimination in 
areas such as education, employment, and 
health, which hinder the ability of those mem-
bers to participate effectively in the political 
process. 
‘‘(iv) The use of overt or subtle racial appeals 
either in political campaigns or surrounding the 
adoption or maintenance of the challenged 
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, 
or procedure. 
‘‘(v) The extent to which members of the pro-
tected class have been elected to public office in 
the jurisdiction, except that the fact that the 
protected class is too small to elect candidates of 
its choice shall not defeat a claim of vote denial 
or abridgment under this section. 
‘‘(vi) Whether there is a significant lack of re-
sponsiveness on the part of elected officials to 
the particularized needs of members of the pro-
tected class. 
‘‘(vii) Whether the policy underlying the State 
or political subdivision’s use of the challenged 
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, 
or procedure has a tenuous connection to that 
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, 
or procedure. In making a determination under 
this clause, a court shall consider whether the 
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, 
or procedure in question was designed to ad-
vance and materially advances a valid and sub-
stantiated State interest. 
‘‘(B) A particular combination or number of 
factors under subparagraph (A) shall not be re-
quired to establish a violation of subsection (a) 
for vote denial or abridgment. Additionally, a 
litigant can show a variety of factors to estab-
lish a violation of subsection (a), and is not lim-
ited to those factors listed under subparagraph 
(A). 
‘‘(C) In evaluating the totality of the cir-
cumstances for consideration relative to a viola-
tion of subsection (a) for vote denial or abridg-
ment, the following factors shall not weigh 
against a finding of a violation: 
‘‘(i) The total number or share of members of 
a protected class on whom a challenged quali-
fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure does not impose a material burden. 
‘‘(ii) The degree to which the challenged qual-
ification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or 
procedure has a long pedigree or was in wide-
spread use at some earlier date. 
‘‘(iii) The use of an identical or similar quali-
fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-
cedure in other States or political subdivisions. 
‘‘(iv) The availability of other forms of voting 
unimpacted by the challenged qualification, 
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure to 
all members of the electorate, including members 
of the protected class, unless the State or polit-
ical subdivision is simultaneously expanding 
those other qualifications, prerequisites, stand-
ards, practices, or procedures to eliminate any 
disproportionate burden imposed by the chal-
lenged qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure. 
‘‘(v) A prophylactic impact on potential crimi-
nal activity by individual voters, if such crimes 
have not occurred in the State or political sub-
division in substantial numbers. 
‘‘(vi) Mere invocation of interests in voter con-
fidence or prevention of fraud.’’. 
(d) INTENDED VOTE DILUTION OR VOTE DENIAL 
OR ABRIDGMENT.—Section 2 of such Act (52 
U.S.C. 10301), as amended by subsections (a), 
(b), and (c) is further amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(d)(1) A violation of subsection (a) is also es-
tablished if a challenged qualification, pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure is in-
tended, at least in part, to dilute the voting 
strength of a protected class or to deny or 
abridge the right of any citizen of the United 
States to vote on account of race, color, or in 
contravention of the guarantees set forth in sec-
tion 4(f)(2). 
‘‘(2) Discrimination on account of race or 
color, or in contravention of the guarantees set 
forth in section 4(f)(2), need only be one purpose 
of a qualification, prerequisite, standard, prac-
tice, or procedure in order to establish a viola-
tion of subsection (a), as described in this sub-
section. A qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
practice, or procedure intended to dilute the vot-
ing strength of a protected class or to make it 
more difficult for members of a protected class to 
cast a ballot that will be counted constitutes a 
violation of subsection (a), as described in this 
subsection, even if an additional purpose of the 
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, 
or procedure is to benefit a particular political 
party or group. 
‘‘(3) Recent context, including actions by offi-
cial decisionmakers in prior years or in other 
contexts preceding the decision responsible for 
the 
challenged 
qualification, 
prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure, and including 
actions by predecessor government actors or in-
dividual members of a decisionmaking body, 
may be relevant to making a determination 
about a violation of subsection (a), as described 
under this subsection. 
‘‘(4) A claim that a violation of subsection (a) 
has occurred, as described under this sub-
section, shall require proof of a discriminatory 
impact but shall not require proof of violation of 
subsection (b) or (c).’’. 
SEC. 9002. RETROGRESSION. 
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), as amended by section 9001 
of this Act, is further amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(e) A violation of subsection (a) is estab-
lished when a State or political subdivision en-
acts or seeks to administer any qualification or 
prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or 
procedure with respect to voting in any election 
that has the purpose of or will have the effect 
of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the 
United States on account of race or color, or in 
contravention of the guarantees set forth in sec-
tion 4(f)(2), to participate in the electoral proc-
ess or elect their preferred candidates of choice. 
This subsection applies to any action taken on 
or after January 1, 2021, by a State or political 
subdivision to enact or seek to administer any 
such qualification or prerequisite to voting or 
standard, practice or procedure. 
‘‘(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-
section (e), final decisions of the United States 
District Court of the District of Columbia on ap-
plications or petitions by States or political sub-
divisions for preclearance under section 5 of any 
changes in voting prerequisites, standards, prac-
tices, or procedures, supersede the provisions of 
subsection (e).’’. 
SEC. 9003. VIOLATIONS TRIGGERING AUTHORITY 
OF COURT TO RETAIN JURISDIC-
TION. 
(a) TYPES OF VIOLATIONS.—Section 3(c) of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10302(c)) is 
amended by striking ‘‘violations of the four-
teenth or fifteenth amendment’’ and inserting 
‘‘violations of the 14th or 15th Amendment, vio-
lations of this Act, or violations of any Federal 
law that prohibits discrimination in voting on 
the basis of race, color, or membership in a lan-
guage minority group,’’. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 3(a) of 
such Act (52 U.S.C. 10302(a)) is amended by 
striking ‘‘violations of the fourteenth or fif-
teenth amendment’’ and inserting ‘‘violations of 
the 14th or 15th Amendment, violations of this 
Act, or violations of any Federal law that pro-
hibits discrimination in voting on the basis of 
race, color, or membership in a language minor-
ity group,’’. 
SEC. 9004. CRITERIA FOR COVERAGE OF STATES 
AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS. 
(a) DETERMINATION OF STATES AND POLITICAL 
SUBDIVISIONS SUBJECT TO SECTION 4(a).— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 4(b) of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10303(b)) is amend-
ed to read as follows: 
‘‘(b) DETERMINATION OF STATES AND POLIT-
ICAL SUBDIVISIONS SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) EXISTENCE OF VOTING RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
DURING PREVIOUS 25 YEARS.— 
‘‘(A) STATEWIDE APPLICATION.—Subsection (a) 
applies with respect to a State and all political 
subdivisions within the State during a calendar 
year if— 
‘‘(i) fifteen or more voting rights violations oc-
curred in the State during the previous 25 cal-
endar years; or 
‘‘(ii) ten or more voting rights violations oc-
curred in the State during the previous 25 cal-
endar years, at least one of which was com-
mitted by the State itself (as opposed to a polit-
ical subdivision within the State). 
‘‘(B) APPLICATION TO SPECIFIC POLITICAL SUB-
DIVISIONS.—Subsection (a) applies with respect 
to a political subdivision as a separate unit dur-
ing a calendar year if three or more voting 
rights violations occurred in the subdivision 
during the previous 25 calendar years. 
‘‘(2) PERIOD OF APPLICATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in sub-
paragraph (B), if, pursuant to paragraph (1), 
subsection (a) applies with respect to a State or

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H146 
January 13, 2022 
‘‘(i) STATES.—If a State obtains a declaratory 
judgment under subsection (a), and the judg-
ment remains in effect, subsection (a) shall no 
longer apply to such State and all political sub-
divisions in the State pursuant to paragraph 
(1)(A) unless, after the issuance of the declara-
tory judgment, paragraph (1)(A) applies to the 
State solely on the basis of voting rights viola-
tions occurring after the issuance of the declar-
atory judgment, or paragraph (1)(B) applies to 
the political subdivision solely on the basis of 
voting rights violations occurring after the 
issuance of the declaratory judgment. 
‘‘(ii) POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS.—If a political 
subdivision obtains a declaratory judgment 
under subsection (a), and the judgment remains 
in effect, subsection (a) shall no longer apply to 
such political subdivision pursuant to para-
graph (1), including pursuant to paragraph 
(1)(A) (relating to the statewide application of 
subsection (a)), unless, after the issuance of the 
declaratory judgment, paragraph (1)(B) applies 
to the political subdivision solely on the basis of 
voting rights violations occurring after the 
issuance of the declaratory judgment. 
‘‘(3) DETERMINATION OF VOTING RIGHTS VIOLA-
TION.—For purposes of paragraph (1), a voting 
rights violation occurred in a State or political 
subdivision if any of the following applies: 
‘‘(A) JUDICIAL RELIEF; VIOLATION OF THE 14TH 
OR 15TH AMENDMENT.—Any final judgment (that 
has not been reversed on appeal) occurred, in 
which the plaintiff prevailed and in which any 
court of the United States determined that a de-
nial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of 
the United States to vote on account of race, 
color, or membership in a language minority 
group occurred, that a voting qualification or 
prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or 
procedure with respect to voting created an 
undue burden on the right to vote in connection 
with a claim that the law unduly burdened vot-
ers of a particular race, color, or language mi-
nority group, or that race was the predominant 
factor motivating the decision to place a signifi-
cant number of voters within or outside of a 
particular district, unless narrowly tailored in 
service of a compelling interest or in response to 
an objection interposed by the Department of 
Justice, in violation of the 14th or 15th Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United States, 
anywhere within the State or subdivision. 
‘‘(B) JUDICIAL
RELIEF; VIOLATIONS
OF
THIS 
ACT.—Any final judgment (that has not been re-
versed on appeal) occurred in which the plain-
tiff prevailed and in which any court of the 
United States determined that a voting quali-
fication or prerequisite to voting or standard, 
practice, or procedure with respect to voting was 
imposed or applied or would have been imposed 
or applied anywhere within the State or sub-
division in a manner that resulted or would 
have resulted in a denial or abridgement of the 
right of any citizen of the United States to vote 
on account of race, color, or membership in a 
language minority group, in violation of sub-
section (e) or (f) or section 2, 201, or 203, or any 
final judgment (that has not been reversed on 
appeal) occurred in which a court of the United 
States found a State or political subdivision 
failed to comply with section 5(a): Provided, 
That if the voting qualifications or prerequisites 
to voting or standards, practices, or procedures 
that the court finds required compliance with 
section 5(a) subsequently go into effect (without 
alteration or amendment) in accordance with 
the procedures in section 5(a), then such finding 
shall not count as a violation. 
‘‘(C) FINAL JUDGMENT; DENIAL OF DECLARA-
TORY JUDGMENT.—In a final judgment (that has 
not been reversed on appeal), any court of the 
United States has denied the request of the 
State or subdivision for a declaratory judgment 
under section 3(c) or section 5, and thereby pre-
vented a voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting or standard, practice, or procedure with 
respect to voting from being enforced anywhere 
within the State or subdivision. 
‘‘(D) OBJECTION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.— 
The Attorney General has interposed an objec-
tion under section 3(c) or section 5, and thereby 
prevented a voting qualification or prerequisite 
to voting or standard, practice, or procedure 
with respect to voting from being enforced any-
where within the State or subdivision. A viola-
tion under this subparagraph has not occurred 
where an objection has been withdrawn by the 
Attorney General, unless the withdrawal was in 
response to a change in the law or practice that 
served as the basis of the objection. A violation 
under this subparagraph has not occurred 
where the objection is based solely on a State or 
political subdivision’s failure to comply with a 
procedural process that would not otherwise 
count as an independent violation of this Act. 
‘‘(E) CONSENT DECREE, SETTLEMENT, OR OTHER 
AGREEMENT.— 
‘‘(i) AGREEMENT.—A consent decree, settle-
ment, or other agreement was adopted or en-
tered by a court of the United States that con-
tains an admission of liability by the defend-
ants, which resulted in the alteration or aban-
donment of a voting practice anywhere in the 
territory of such State or subdivision that was 
challenged on the ground that the practice de-
nied or abridged the right of any citizen of the 
United States to vote on account of race, color, 
or membership in a language minority group in 
violation of subsection (e) or (f) or section 2, 201, 
or 203, or the 14th or 15th Amendment. 
‘‘(ii) INDEPENDENT VIOLATIONS.—A voluntary 
extension or continuation of a consent decree, 
settlement, or agreement described in clause (i) 
shall not count as an independent violation 
under this subparagraph. Any other extension 
or modification of such a consent decree, settle-
ment, or agreement, if the consent decree, settle-
ment, or agreement has been in place for ten 
years or longer, shall count as an independent 
violation under this subparagraph. If a court of 
the United States finds that a consent decree, 
settlement, or agreement described in clause (i) 
itself denied or abridged the right of any citizen 
of the United States to vote on account of race, 
color, or membership in a language minority 
group, violated subsection (e) or (f) or section 2, 
201, or 203, or created an undue burden on the 
right to vote in connection with a claim that the 
consent decree, settlement, or other agreement 
unduly burdened voters of a particular race, 
color, or language minority group, that finding 
shall count as an independent violation under 
this subparagraph. 
‘‘(F) MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS.—Each instance in 
which a voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting or standard, practice, or procedure with 
respect to voting, including each redistricting 
plan, is found to be a violation by a court of the 
United States pursuant to subparagraph (A) or 
(B), or prevented from being enforced pursuant 
to subparagraph (C) or (D), or altered or aban-
doned pursuant to subparagraph (E) shall count 
as an independent violation under this para-
graph. Within a redistricting plan, each viola-
tion under this paragraph found to violate the 
rights of any group of voters within an indi-
vidual district based on race, color, or language 
minority group shall count as an independent 
violation under this paragraph. 
‘‘(4) TIMING OF DETERMINATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) DETERMINATIONS OF VOTING RIGHTS VIO-
LATIONS.—As early as practicable during each 
calendar year, the Attorney General shall make 
the determinations required by this subsection, 
including updating the list of voting rights vio-
lations occurring in each State and political 
subdivision for the previous calendar year. 
‘‘(B) EFFECTIVE
UPON
PUBLICATION
IN
FED-
ERAL
REGISTER.—A determination or certifi-
cation of the Attorney General under this sec-
tion or under section 8 or 13 shall be effective 
upon publication in the Federal Register.’’. 
(2) CONFORMING
AMENDMENTS.—Section 4(a) 
of such Act (52 U.S.C. 10303(a)) is amended— 
(A) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence of 
the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by 
striking ‘‘any State with respect to which’’ and 
all that follows through ‘‘unless’’ and inserting 
‘‘any State to which this subsection applies dur-
ing a calendar year pursuant to determinations 
made under subsection (b), or in any political 
subdivision of such State (as such subdivision 
existed on the date such determinations were 
made with respect to such State), though such 
determinations were not made with respect to 
such subdivision as a separate unit, or in any 
political subdivision with respect to which this 
subsection applies during a calendar year pur-
suant to determinations made with respect to 
such subdivision as a separate unit under sub-
section (b), unless’’; 
(B) in paragraph (1), in the matter preceding 
subparagraph (A), by striking the second sen-
tence; 
(C) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ‘‘(in the 
case of a State or subdivision seeking a declara-
tory judgment under the second sentence of this 
subsection)’’; 
(D) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking ‘‘(in the 
case of a State or subdivision seeking a declara-
tory judgment under the second sentence of this 
subsection)’’; 
(E) in paragraph (3), by striking ‘‘(in the case 
of a State or subdivision seeking a declaratory 
judgment under the second sentence of this sub-
section)’’; 
(F) in paragraph (5), by striking ‘‘(in the case 
of a State or subdivision which sought a declar-
atory judgment under the second sentence of 
this subsection)’’; 
(G) by striking paragraphs (7) and (8); and 
(H) by redesignating paragraph (9) as para-
graph (7). 
(b) CLARIFICATION
OF TREATMENT
OF MEM-
BERS OF LANGUAGE MINORITY GROUPS.—Section 
4(a)(1) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 10303(a)(1)), as 
amended by subsection (a), is further amended, 
in the first sentence, by striking ‘‘race or color,’’ 
and inserting ‘‘race or color, or in contravention 
of the guarantees of subsection (f)(2),’’. 
(c) FACILITATING BAILOUT.—Section 4(a) of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
10303(a)), as amended by subsection (a), is fur-
ther amended— 
(1) by striking paragraph (1)(C); 
(2) by inserting at the beginning of paragraph 
(7), as redesignated by subsection (a)(2)(H), the 
following: ‘‘Any plaintiff seeking a declaratory 
judgment under this subsection on the grounds 
that the plaintiff meets the requirements of 
paragraph (1) may request that the Attorney 
General consent to entry of judgment.’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(8) If a political subdivision is subject to the 
application of this subsection, due to the appli-
cability of subsection (b)(1)(A), the political sub-
division may seek a declaratory judgment under 
this section if the subdivision demonstrates that 
the subdivision meets the criteria established by 
the subparagraphs of paragraph (1), for the 10 
years preceding the date on which subsection 
(a) applied to the political subdivision under 
subsection (b)(1)(A). 
‘‘(9) If a political subdivision was not subject 
to the application of this subsection by reason of 
a declaratory judgment entered prior to the date 
of enactment of the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021, and is not, 
subsequent to that date of enactment, subject to 
the application of this subsection under sub-
section (b)(1)(B), then that political subdivision 
shall not be subject to the requirements of this 
subsection.’’.

voting in a State or political subdivision, the fol-
lowing shall be covered practices subject to the

group in the jurisdiction and that represents 15 
percent or more of the State or political subdivi-
sion’s voting-age population experiences a popu-
lation increase of at least 20 percent of its vot-
ing-age population, over the preceding decade 
(as calculated by the Bureau of the Census 
under the most recent decennial census), in the 
jurisdiction. 
‘‘(4) CHANGES IN DOCUMENTATION OR QUALI-
FICATIONS
TO

‘‘(5) CHANGES TO MULTILINGUAL VOTING MATE-
RIALS.—Any change that reduces multilingual

LIST
MAINTENANCE
PROCESS.—Any 
change to the maintenance process for voter reg-

from the list of active voters registered to vote in 
elections for Federal, State, or local office, or 
that incorporates new sources of information in 
determining a voter’s eligibility to vote in elec-
tions for Federal, State, or local office, if such 
a change would have a statistically significant 
disparate impact, concerning the removal from

guage minority groups that constitute greater 
than 5 percent of the voting-age population— 
‘‘(A) in the case of a political subdivision im-
posing such change if—

cept that the requirements under subsections (a) 
and (c) shall apply only with respect to each 
such political subdivision individually. 
‘‘(c) PRECLEARANCE.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.— 
‘‘(A) ACTION .—Whenever a State or political 
subdivision with respect to which the require-
ments set forth in subsection (a) are in effect 
shall enact, adopt, or seek to implement any 
covered practice described under subsection (b), 
such State or subdivision may institute an ac-
tion in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment 
that such covered practice neither has the pur-
pose nor will have the effect of denying or 
abridging the right to vote on account of race, 
color, or membership in a language minority 
group, and unless and until the court enters 
such judgment such covered practice shall not 
be implemented. 
‘‘(B) SUBMISSION TO ATTORNEY GENERAL.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subpara-
graph (A), such covered practice may be imple-
mented without such proceeding if the covered 
practice has been submitted by the chief legal 
officer or other appropriate official of such 
State or subdivision to the Attorney General and 
the Attorney General has not interposed an ob-
jection within 60 days after such submission, or 
upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expe-
dited approval within 60 days after such submis-
sion, the Attorney General has affirmatively in-
dicated that such objection will not be made. An 
exigency, including a natural disaster, inclem-

quiring a changed qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure within 30 days

stitute good cause requiring the Attorney Gen-
eral to expedite consideration of the submission. 
To the extent feasible, expedited consideration 
shall consider the views of individuals affected 
by the changed qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure. 
‘‘(ii) EFFECT OF INDICATION.—Neither an af-
firmative indication by the Attorney General 
that no objection will be made, nor the Attorney 
General’s failure to object, nor a declaratory 
judgment entered under this subsection shall 
bar a subsequent action to enjoin implementa-
tion of such covered practice. In the event the 
Attorney General affirmatively indicates that no 
objection will be made within the 60-day period 
following receipt of a submission, the Attorney 
General may reserve the right to reexamine the 
submission if additional information comes to 
the Attorney General’s attention during the re-
mainder of the 60-day period which would oth-
erwise require objection in accordance with this 
subsection. 
‘‘(C) COURT.—Any action under this sub-
section shall be heard and determined by a court 
of three judges in accordance with the provi-
sions of section 2284 of title 28, United States 
Code, and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme 
Court.

section (b) that has the purpose of or will have 
the effect of diminishing the ability of any citi-
zens of the United States on account of race, 
color, or membership in a language minority 
group, to elect their preferred candidates of 
choice denies or abridges the right to vote with-
in the meaning of paragraph (1). 
‘‘(3) PURPOSE DEFINED.—The term ‘purpose’ in 
paragraphs (1) and (2) shall include any dis-
criminatory purpose. 
‘‘(4) PURPOSE OF PARAGRAPH (2).—The purpose 
of paragraph (2) is to protect the ability of such 
citizens to elect their preferred candidates of 
choice. 
‘‘(d) ENFORCEMENT.—The Attorney General or 
any aggrieved citizen may file an action in a 
district court of the United States to compel any 
State or political subdivision to satisfy the obli-
gations set forth in this section. Such an action 
shall be heard and determined by a court of 
three judges under section 2284 of title 28, 
United States Code. In any such action, the 
court shall provide as a remedy that implemen-
tation of any voting qualification or prerequisite 
to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure 
with respect to voting, that is the subject of the 
action under this subsection be enjoined unless 
the court determines that— 
‘‘(1) the voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with 
respect to voting, is not a covered practice de-
scribed in subsection (b); or 
‘‘(2) the State or political subdivision has com-

TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS.

ical subdivision makes any change in any quali-
fication or prerequisite to voting or standard, 
practice, or procedure with respect to voting in 
any election for Federal office that will result in 
the qualification or prerequisite, standard, prac-
tice, or procedure being different from that 
which was in effect as of 180 days before the

or political subdivision shall provide reasonable 
public notice in such State or political subdivi-
sion and on the website of the State or political 
subdivision, of a concise description of the 
change, including the difference between the 
changed qualification or prerequisite, standard,

tice described in this paragraph, in such State

ical subdivision shall provide the public notice 
required under paragraph (1) not later than 48

volved is made.

sible format that States and political subdivi-
sions shall use to provide public notice of infor-
mation under this section.

OF RIGHT TO VOTE.—The 
right to vote of any person shall not be denied 
or abridged because the person failed to comply 
with any change made by a State or political 
subdivision to a voting qualification, pre-
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure if the 
State or political subdivision involved did not 
meet the applicable requirements of this section 
with respect to the change. 
‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section— 
‘‘(1) the term ‘demographic group’ means each

amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(d) Whenever there are reasonable grounds

would (1) deny any citizen the right to register, 
to cast a ballot, or to have that ballot counted 
properly and included in the appropriate totals 
of votes cast in violation of the 14th, 15th, 19th, 
24th, or 26th Amendments to the Constitution of

(b) of section 11, or (3) violate any other provi-
sion of this Act or any other Federal voting 
rights law that prohibits discrimination on the 
basis of race, color, or membership in a lan-
guage minority group, an aggrieved person or 
(in the name of the United States) the Attorney 
General may institute an action for preventive 
relief, including an application for a temporary

other appropriate order. Nothing in this sub-
section shall be construed to create a cause of 
action for civil enforcement of criminal provi-
sions of this or any other Act.’’.

sonable grounds to believe that a State or polit-
ical subdivision has engaged or is about to en-
gage in any act or practice prohibited by a pro-
vision of this title, an aggrieved person or (in 
the name of the United States) the Attorney 
General may institute an action in a district

such other order as may be appropriate.’’.

Amendment to the Constitution of the United

SEC. 9009. PREVENTIVE RELIEF. 
Section 12(d) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
(52 U.S.C. 10308(d)), as amended by section 108, 
is further amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(2)(A) In considering any motion for prelimi-
nary relief in any action for preventive relief de-
scribed in this subsection, the court shall grant 
the relief if the court determines that the com-
plainant has raised a serious question as to 
whether the challenged voting qualification or 
prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or 
procedure violates any of the provisions listed in 
section 111(a)(1) of the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act and, on balance, the 
hardship imposed on the defendant by the grant 
of the relief will be less than the hardship which 
would be imposed on the plaintiff if the relief 
were not granted. 
‘‘(B) In making its determination under this 
paragraph with respect to a change in any vot-
ing qualification, prerequisite to voting, or 
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to 
voting, the court shall consider all relevant fac-
tors and give due weight to the following fac-
tors, if they are present: 
‘‘(i) Whether the qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure in effect prior 
to the change was adopted as a remedy for a 
Federal court judgment, consent decree, or ad-
mission regarding— 
‘‘(I) discrimination on the basis of race or 
color in violation of the 14th or 15th Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States; 
‘‘(II) a violation of the 19th, 24th, or 26th 
Amendments to the Constitution of the United 
States; 
‘‘(III) a violation of this Act; or 
‘‘(IV) voting discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or membership in a language minor-
ity group in violation of any other Federal or 
State law. 
‘‘(ii) Whether the qualification, prerequisite, 
standard, practice, or procedure in effect prior 
to the change served as a ground for the dis-
missal or settlement of a claim alleging— 
‘‘(I) discrimination on the basis of race or 
color in violation of the 14th or 15th Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States; 
‘‘(II) a violation of the 19th, 24th, or 26th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States; 
‘‘(III) a violation of this Act; or 
‘‘(IV) voting discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or membership in a language minor-
ity group in violation of any other Federal or 
State law. 
‘‘(iii) Whether the change was adopted fewer 
than 180 days before the date of the election 
with respect to which the change is to take or 
takes effect. 
‘‘(iv) Whether the defendant has failed to pro-
vide timely or complete notice of the adoption of 
the change as required by applicable Federal or 
State law. 
‘‘(3) A jurisdiction’s inability to enforce its 
voting or election laws, regulations, policies, or 
redistricting plans, standing alone, shall not be 
deemed to constitute irreparable harm to the 
public interest or to the interests of a defendant 
in an action arising under the Constitution or 
any Federal law that prohibits discrimination 
on the basis of race, color, or membership in a 
language minority group in the voting process, 
for the purposes of determining whether a stay 
of a court’s order or an interlocutory appeal 
under section 1253 of title 28, United States 
Code, is warranted.’’. 
SEC. 9010. BILINGUAL ELECTION REQUIREMENTS. 
Section 203(b)(1) of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 (52 U.S.C. 10503(b)(1)) is amended by strik-
ing ‘‘2032’’ and inserting ‘‘2037’’. 
SEC. 9011. RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS OF VOTING 
RIGHTS LAWS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.— 
(1) RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS OF VOTING RIGHTS 
LAWS.—In this section, the term ‘‘prohibited act 
or practice’’ means— 
(A) any act or practice— 
(i) that creates an undue burden on the fun-
damental right to vote in violation of the 14th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States or violates the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States; or 
(ii) that is prohibited by the 15th, 19th, 24th, 
or 26th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, section 2004 of the Revised Stat-
utes (52 U.S.C. 10101), the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), the National Voter 
Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.), 
the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee 
Voting Act (52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq.), the Help 
America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 20901 et 
seq.), the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly 
and Handicapped Act (52 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.), 
or section 2003 of the Revised Statutes (52 U.S.C. 
10102); and 
(B) any act or practice in violation of any 
Federal law that prohibits discrimination with 
respect to voting, including the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.). 
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to diminish the au-
thority or scope of authority of any person to 
bring an action under any Federal law. 
(3) ATTORNEY’S
FEES.—Section 722(b) of the 
Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended 
by inserting ‘‘a provision described in section 
111(a)(1) of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act of 2021,’’ after ‘‘title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964,’’. 
(b) GROUNDS FOR EQUITABLE RELIEF.—In any 
action for equitable relief pursuant to a law list-
ed under subsection (a), proximity of the action 
to an election shall not be a valid reason to 
deny such relief, or stay the operation of or va-
cate the issuance of such relief, unless the party 
opposing the issuance or continued operation of 
relief meets the burden of proving by clear and 
convincing evidence that the issuance of the re-
lief would be so close in time to the election as 
to cause irreparable harm to the public interest 
or that compliance with such relief would im-
pose serious burdens on the party opposing re-
lief. 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—In considering whether to 
grant, deny, stay, or vacate any order of equi-
table relief, the court shall give substantial 
weight to the public’s interest in expanding ac-
cess to the right to vote. A State’s generalized 
interest in enforcing its enacted laws shall not 
be a relevant consideration in determining 
whether equitable relief is warranted. 
(2) PRESUMPTIVE SAFE HARBOR.—Where equi-
table relief is sought either within 30 days of the 
adoption or reasonable public notice of the chal-
lenged policy or practice, or more than 60 days 
before the date of an election to which the relief 
being sought will apply, proximity to the elec-
tion will be presumed not to constitute a harm 
to the public interest or a burden on the party 
opposing relief. 
(c) GROUNDS FOR STAY OR VACATUR IN FED-
ERAL CLAIMS INVOLVING VOTING RIGHTS.— 
(1) PROSPECTIVE EFFECT.—In reviewing an ap-
plication for a stay or vacatur of equitable relief

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H150 
January 13, 2022 
granted pursuant to a law listed in subsection 
(a), a court shall give substantial weight to the 
reliance interests of citizens who acted pursuant 
to such order under review. In fashioning a stay 
or vacatur, a reviewing court shall not order re-
lief that has the effect of denying or abridging 
the right to vote of any citizen who has acted in 
reliance on the order. 
(2) 
WRITTEN
EXPLANATION.—No 
stay 
or 
vacatur under this subsection shall issue unless 
the reviewing court makes specific findings that 
the public interest, including the public’s inter-
est in expanding access to the ballot, will be 
harmed by the continuing operation of the equi-
table relief or that compliance with such relief 
will impose serious burdens on the party seeking 
such a stay or vacatur such that those burdens 
substantially outweigh the benefits to the public 
interest. In reviewing an application for a stay 
or vacatur of equitable relief, findings of fact 
made in issuing the order under review shall not 
be set aside unless clearly erroneous. 
SEC. 9012. PROTECTION OF TABULATED VOTES. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
10307) is amended— 
(1) in section 11— 
(A) by amending subsection (a) to read as fol-
lows: 
‘‘(a) No person acting under color of law 
shall— 
‘‘(1) fail or refuse to permit any person to vote 
who is entitled to vote under Federal law or is 
otherwise qualified to vote; 
‘‘(2) willfully fail or refuse to tabulate, count, 
and report such person’s vote; or 
‘‘(3) willfully fail or refuse to certify the ag-
gregate tabulations of such persons’ votes or 
certify the election of the candidates receiving 
sufficient such votes to be elected to office.’’; 
and 
(B) in subsection (b), by inserting ‘‘subsection 
(a) or’’ after ‘‘duties under’’; and 
(2) in section 12— 
(A) in subsection (b)— 
(i) by striking ‘‘a year following an election in 
a political subdivision in which an observer has 
been assigned’’ and inserting ‘‘22 months fol-
lowing an election for Federal office’’; and 
(ii) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable 
grounds to believe that any person has engaged 
in or is about to engage in an act in violation 
of this subsection, the Attorney General may in-
stitute (in the name of the United States) a civil 
action in Federal district court seeking appro-
priate relief.’’; 
(B) in subsection (c), by inserting ‘‘or solicits 
a violation of’’ after ‘‘conspires to violate’’; and 
(C) in subsection (e), by striking the first and 
second sentences and inserting the following: 
‘‘If, after the closing of the polls in an election 
for Federal office, persons allege that notwith-
standing (1) their registration by an appropriate 
election official and (2) their eligibility to vote 
in the political subdivision, their ballots have 
not been counted in such election, and if upon 
prompt receipt of notifications of these allega-
tions, the Attorney General finds such allega-
tions to be well founded, the Attorney General 
may forthwith file with the district court an ap-
plication for an order providing for the counting 
and certification of the ballots of such persons 
and requiring the inclusion of their votes in the 
total vote for all applicable offices before the re-
sults of such election shall be deemed final and 
any force or effect given thereto.’’. 
SEC. 9013. ENFORCEMENT OF VOTING RIGHTS BY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
Section 12 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10308), as amended by this Act, is further 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(g) VOTING RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT BY ATTOR-
NEY GENERAL.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In order to fulfill the Attor-
ney General’s responsibility to enforce this Act 
and other Federal laws that protect the right to 
vote, the Attorney General (or upon designation 
by the Attorney General, the Assistant Attorney 
General for Civil Rights) is authorized, before 
commencing a civil action, to issue a demand for 
inspection and information in writing to any 
State or political subdivision, or other govern-
mental representative or agent, with respect to 
any relevant documentary material that the At-
torney General has reason to believe is within 
their possession, custody, or control. A demand 
by the Attorney General under this subsection 
may require— 
‘‘(A) the production of such documentary ma-
terial for inspection and copying; 
‘‘(B) answers in writing to written questions 
with respect to such documentary material; or 
‘‘(C) both the production described under sub-
paragraph (A) and the answers described under 
subparagraph (B).

MAND.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Any demand issued under 
paragraph (1), shall include a sworn certificate 
to identify the voting qualification or pre-
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or pro-
cedure with respect to voting, or other voting re-
lated matter or issue, whose lawfulness the At-
torney General is investigating and to identify 
the Federal law that protects the right to vote 
under which the investigation is being con-
ducted. The demand shall be reasonably cal-
culated to lead to the discovery of documentary 
material and information relevant to such inves-
tigation. Documentary material includes any 
material upon which relevant information is re-
corded, and includes written or printed mate-
rials, photographs, tapes, or materials upon 
which information is electronically or magneti-
cally recorded. Such demands shall be aimed at 
the Attorney General having the ability to in-
spect and obtain copies of relevant materials (as 
well as obtain information) related to voting 
and are not aimed at the Attorney General tak-
ing possession of original records, particularly 
those that are required to be retained by State 
and local election officials under Federal or 
State law. 
‘‘(B) NO REQUIREMENT FOR PRODUCTION.—Any 
demand issued under paragraph (1) may not re-
quire the production of any documentary mate-
rial or the submission of any answers in writing 
to written questions if such material or answers 
would be protected from disclosure under the 
standards applicable to discovery requests under 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in an ac-
tion in which the Attorney General or the 
United States is a party. 
‘‘(C) DOCUMENTARY
MATERIAL.—If the de-
mand issued under paragraph (1) requires the 
production of documentary material, it shall— 
‘‘(i) identify the class of documentary material 
to be produced with such definiteness and cer-
tainty as to permit such material to be fairly 
identified; and 
‘‘(ii) prescribe a return date for production of 
the documentary material at least 20 days after 
issuance of the demand to give the State or po-
litical subdivision, or other governmental rep-
resentative or agent, a reasonable period of time 
for assembling the documentary material and 
making it available for inspection and copying. 
‘‘(D) ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS.—If the 
demand issued under paragraph (1) requires an-
swers in writing to written questions, it shall— 
‘‘(i) set forth with specificity the written ques-
tion to be answered; and 
‘‘(ii) prescribe a date at least 20 days after the 
issuance of the demand for submitting answers 
in writing to the written questions. 
‘‘(E) SERVICE.—A demand issued under para-
graph (1) may be served by a United States mar-
shal or a deputy marshal, or by certified mail, at 
any place within the territorial jurisdiction of 
any court of the United States. 
‘‘(3) RESPONSES TO AN ATTORNEY GENERAL DE-
MAND.—A State or political subdivision, or other 
governmental representative or agent, shall, 
with respect to any documentary material or 
any answer in writing produced under this sub-
section, provide a sworn certificate, in such 
form as the demand issued under paragraph (1) 
designates, by a person having knowledge of the 
facts and circumstances relating to such produc-
tion or written answer, authorized to act on be-
half of the State or political subdivision, or 
other governmental representative or agent, 
upon which the demand was served. The certifi-
cate— 
‘‘(A) shall state that— 
‘‘(i) all of the documentary material required 
by the demand and in the possession, custody, 
or control of the State or political subdivision, 
or other governmental representative or agent, 
has been produced; 
‘‘(ii) with respect to every answer in writing 
to a written question, all information required 
by the question and in the possession, custody, 
control, or knowledge of the State or political 
subdivision, or other governmental representa-
tive or agent, has been submitted; or 
‘‘(iii) the requirements described in both 
clause (i) and clause (ii) have been met; or 
‘‘(B) provide the basis for any objection to 
producing the documentary material or answer-
ing the written question. 
To the extent that any information is not fur-
nished, the information shall be identified and 
reasons set forth with particularity regarding 
the reasons why the information was not fur-
nished. 
‘‘(4) JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.— 
‘‘(A) PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT.—Whenever 
any State or political subdivision, or other gov-
ernmental representative or agent, fails to com-
ply with demand issued by the Attorney General 
under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may 
file, in a district court of the United States in 
which the State or political subdivision, or other 
governmental representative or agent, is located, 
a petition for a judicial order enforcing the At-
torney General demand issued under paragraph 
(1). 
‘‘(B) PETITION TO MODIFY.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Any State or political sub-
division, or other governmental representative or 
agent, that is served with a demand issued by 
the Attorney General under paragraph (1) may 
file in the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia a petition for an order of 
the court to modify or set aside the demand of 
the Attorney General. 
‘‘(ii) PETITION
TO
MODIFY.—Any petition to 
modify or set aside a demand of the Attorney 
General issued under paragraph (1) must be 
filed within 20 days after the date of service of 
the Attorney General’s demand or at any time 
before the return date specified in the Attorney 
General’s demand, whichever date is earlier. 
‘‘(iii) CONTENTS
OF
PETITION.—The petition 
shall specify each ground upon which the peti-
tioner relies in seeking relief under clause (i), 
and may be based upon any failure of the Attor-
ney General’s demand to comply with the provi-
sions of this section or upon any constitutional 
or other legal right or privilege of the State or 
political subdivision, or other governmental rep-
resentative or agent. During the pendency of 
the petition in the court, the court may stay, as 
it deems proper, the running of the time allowed 
for compliance with the Attorney General’s de-
mand, in whole or in part, except that the State 
or political subdivision, or other governmental 
representative or agent, filing the petition shall 
comply with any portions of the Attorney Gen-
eral’s demand not sought to be modified or set 
aside.’’.

SEC. 9202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Constitution explicitly and implicitly 
grants Congress broad general powers to legis-
late on issues relating to Indian Tribes, powers 
consistently described as plenary and exclusive. 
These powers arise from the grant of authority 
in the Indian Commerce Clause and through 
legislative matters arising under the Treaty 
Clause. 
(2) The Federal Government is responsible for 
upholding the obligations to which the Federal 
Government has agreed through treaties, legisla-
tion, and executive orders, referred to as the 
Federal trust responsibility toward Indian 
Tribes and their members.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H152 
January 13, 2022 
(3) The Supreme Court has repeatedly relied 
on the nature of this ‘‘government to govern-
ment’’ relationship between the United States 
and sovereign Indian Tribes for congressional 
authority to enact ‘‘legislation that singles out 
Indians for particular and special treatment’’. 
Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 554–555 (1974). 
(4) Legislation removing barriers to Native 
American voting is vital for the fulfillment of 
Congress’ ‘‘unique obligation’’ toward Indians, 
particularly ensuring that Native American vot-
ers are fully included as ‘‘qualified members of 
the modern body politic’’. Board of County 
Comm’rs v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705, 715 (1943). 
(5) Under the Elections Clause of article I, 
section 4 of the Constitution, Congress has addi-
tional power to regulate any election conducted 
to select Members of Congress. Taken together, 
the Indian Commerce Clause and the Election 
Clause give Congress broad authority to enact 
legislation to safeguard the voting rights of Na-
tive American voters. 
(6) Despite Congress’ decision to grant Native 
Americans Federal citizenship, and with it the 
protections of the Fifteenth Amendment, with 
passage of the Act of June 2, 1924 (Chapter 233; 
43 Stat. 253) (commonly known as the ‘‘Indian 
Citizenship Act of 1924’’), States continued to 
deploy distinct methods for disenfranchising In-
dians by enacting statutes to exclude from voter 
rolls Indians living on Indian lands, requiring 
that Indians first terminate their relationship 
with their Indian Tribe, restricting the right to 
vote on account of a Tribal member’s ‘‘guard-
ianship’’ status, and imposing literacy tests. 
(7) Barriers to voter access for Native Ameri-
cans persist today, and such barriers range from 
obstructing voter access to vote dilution and in-
tentional malapportionment of electoral dis-
tricts. 
(8) The Native American Voting Rights Coali-
tion’s nine field hearings in Indian Country and 
four-State survey of voter discrimination re-
vealed a number of additional obstacles that Na-
tive Americans must overcome in some States, 
including— 
(A) a lack of accessible registration and poll-
ing sites, either due to conditions such as geog-
raphy, lack of paved roads, the absence of reli-
able and affordable broadband connectivity, 
and restrictions on the time, place, and manner 
that eligible people can register and vote, in-
cluding unequal opportunities for absentee, 
early, mail-in, and in-person voting; 
(B) nontraditional or nonexistent addresses 
for residents on Indian reservations, lack of res-
idential mail delivery and pick up, reliance on 
distant post offices with abbreviated operating 
hours for mail services, insufficient housing 
units, overcrowded homes, and high incidence of 
housing insecurity and homelessness, lack of ac-
cess to vehicles, and disproportionate poverty 
which make voter registration, acquisition and 
dropping off of mail-in ballots, receipt of voting 
information and materials, and securing re-
quired identification difficult, if not impossible; 
(C) inadequate language assistance for Tribal 
members, including lack of outreach and pub-
licity, the failure to provide complete, accurate, 
and uniform translations of all voting materials 
in the relevant Native language, and an insuffi-
cient number of trained bilingual poll workers; 
and 
(D) voter identification laws that discriminate 
against Native Americans. 
(9) The Department of Justice and courts also 
recognized that some jurisdictions have been un-
responsive to reasonable requests from federally 
recognized Indian Tribes for more accessible 
voter registration sites and in-person voting lo-
cations. 
(10) According to the National Congress of 
American Indians, there is a wide gap between 
the voter registration and turnout rates of eligi-
ble American Indians and Alaska Natives and 
the voter registration and turnout rates of non- 
Hispanic White and other racial and ethnic 
groups. 
(11) Despite these obstacles, the Native Amer-
ican vote continues to play a significant role in 
Federal, State, and local elections. 
(12) In Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and 
South Dakota, Native Americans, American In-
dians, and Alaska Natives comprise approxi-
mately 10 percent or more of the voting popu-
lation. 
(13) The Native American vote also holds great 
potential, with over 1,000,000 voters who are eli-
gible to vote, but are not registered to vote. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this title 
are— 
(1) to fulfill the Federal Government’s trust

tunity to cure any defect in an absentee ballot

voter, or appearing on or pertaining to the ma-
terials provided for the purpose of returning the 
absentee ballot, if State law would otherwise re-

sistant signature, where such signature is man-
dated by State law.

not permit absentee or mail-in balloting for all 
eligible voters in the State or political subdivi-
sion, that State or political subdivision shall 
nonetheless provide for absentee or mail-in bal-
loting for voters who reside on Indian lands 
consistent with this section if the State, political 
subdivision, or any court applying this section

SEC. 9207. PROCEDURES FOR REMOVAL OF POLL-
ING PLACES AND VOTER REGISTRA-
TION SITES ON INDIAN LANDS. 
(a) ACTIONS REQUIRING TRIBAL ADMINISTRA-
TIVE REVIEW.—No State or political subdivision 
may carry out any of the following activities in 
an election for Federal office unless the require-
ments of subsection (b) have been met:

the existing location of the polling place or voter 
registration site. 
(3) Moving or consolidating a polling place on 
the Indian lands of an Indian Tribe to a loca-
tion across a river, lake, mountain, or other nat-
ural boundary such that it increases travel time 
for a voter, regardless of distance. 
(4) Eliminating in-person voting on the Indian 
lands of an Indian Tribe by designating an In-
dian reservation as a permanent absentee voting 
location, unless the Indian Tribe requests such 
a designation and has not later requested that 
the designation as a permanent absentee voting 
location be reversed. 
(5) Removing an early voting location or oth-
erwise diminishing early voting opportunities on 
Indian lands. 
(6) Removing a ballot drop box or otherwise 
diminishing ballot drop boxes on Indian lands.

bia for a declaratory judgment, and a declara-
tory judgment is issued based upon affirmative 
evidence provided by the State or political sub-
division, that conclusively establishes that the 
specified activity described in subsection (a) pro-
posed by the State or political subdivision nei-
ther has the purpose nor will have the effect of 
denying or abridging the right to vote on ac-
count of race or color, membership in an Indian

group; or 
(C) the chief legal officer or other appropriate

the specified activity described in subsection (a) 
to the Attorney General and the Attorney Gen-
eral affirmatively approves the specified activ-
ity. 
(2) NO LIMITATION ON FUTURE ACTIONS.— 
(A) NO BAR TO SUBSEQUENT ACTION.—Neither 
an affirmative indication by the Attorney Gen-
eral that no objection will be made, nor the At-
torney General’s failure to object, nor a declara-
tory judgment entered under this section, nor a 
written consent issued under paragraph (1)(A)

(a) TRIBAL IDENTIFICATION.—If a State or po-
litical subdivision requires an individual to 
present identification for the purposes of voting 
or registering to vote in an election for Federal 
office, an identification card issued by a feder-
ally recognized Indian Tribe, the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs, the Indian Health Service, or any 
other Tribal or Federal agency issuing identi-
fication cards to eligible Indian voters shall be 
treated as a valid form of identification for such 
purposes. 
(b) ONLINE REGISTRATION.—If a State or polit-
ical subdivision requires an identification card 
for an individual to register to vote online or to 
vote online, that State or political subdivision 
shall annually consult with an Indian Tribe to

orally or in writing that the member does not 
possess more than one form of identification.

OTHER PERSON TO RETURN BALLOT.

extended family member, such as a cousin, 
grandchild, or relation through marriage), care-
giver, tribal assistance provider, or household 
member to return a sealed ballot of a voter that 
resides on Indian lands to a post office on In-
dian lands, a ballot drop box location in a State 
or political subdivision that provides ballot drop 
boxes, a tribally designated building under sec-
tion 9206(e)(2), or an election office, so long as 
the person designated to return the ballot or 
ballots on behalf of another voter does not re-
ceive any form of compensation based on the 
number of ballots that the person has returned 
and no individual, group, or organization pro-
vides compensation on this basis; 
(2) may not put any limit on how many voted 
and sealed absentee ballots any designated per-
son can return to the post office, ballot drop box 
location, tribally designated building, or elec-
tion office under paragraph (1); and

absentee ballot applications, or absentee ballots 
to ballot drop box locations in a State or polit-
ical subdivision that provides ballot drop boxes

ing notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or 
other materials or information relating to the 
electoral process, including ballots, it shall pro-
vide them in the language of the applicable mi-
nority group as well as in the English language. 
‘‘(2) EXCEPTIONS.— 
‘‘(A) In the case of a minority group that is 
not American Indian or Alaska Native and the 
language of that minority group is oral or un-
written, the State or political subdivision shall 
only be required to furnish, in the covered lan-
guage, oral instructions, assistance, translation 
of voting materials, or other information relat-
ing to registration and voting. 
‘‘(B) In the case of a minority group that is 
American Indian or Alaska Native, the State or 
political subdivision shall only be required to 
furnish in the covered language oral instruc-
tions, assistance, or other information relating 
to registration and voting, including all voting 
materials, if the Indian Tribe of that minority 
group has certified that the language of the ap-
plicable American Indian or Alaska Native lan-
guage is presently unwritten or the Indian Tribe 
does not want written translations in the minor-
ity language. 
‘‘(3) WRITTEN
TRANSLATIONS
FOR
ELECTION 
WORKERS.—Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the 
State or political division may be required to 
provide written translations of voting materials, 
with the consent of any applicable Indian Tribe, 
to election workers to ensure that the trans-
lations from English to the language of a minor-
ity group are complete, accurate, and uni-
form.’’. 
SEC. 9211. FEDERAL OBSERVERS TO PROTECT 
TRIBAL VOTING RIGHTS.

likely to occur;’’. 
(b) PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REPORTS.—The At-
torney General shall make publicly available the

ally identifiable information relating to a voter 
or the substance of the voter’s ballot shall not be 
made public. 
SEC. 9212. TRIBAL JURISDICTION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Tribal law enforcement have 
the right to exercise their inherent authority to 
detain and or remove any non-Indian, not af-
filiated with the State, its political subdivision,

for intimidating, harassing, or otherwise imped-
ing the ability of people to vote or of the State 
and its political subdivisions to conduct an elec-
tion. 
(b) CIVIL ACTION BY ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR 
RELIEF.—Whenever any person has engaged or

SEC. 9217. SEVERABILITY; RELATIONSHIP TO 
OTHER LAWS; TRIBAL SOVEREIGN 
IMMUNITY. 
(a) SEVERABILITY.—If any provision of this 
title, or the application of such a provision to 
any person, entity, or circumstance, is held to be 
invalid, the remaining provisions of this title 
and the application of all provisions of this title

States with respect to Indian people. 
SEC. 9218. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There are authorized to be appropriated such 
sums as may be necessary to carry out this title. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 868, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided by and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on House Admin-
istration, or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD) and the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
into the RECORD on the House amend-
ment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 
5746. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5746, the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act. As President 
Biden made clear in his speech in At-
lanta on Tuesday, the time to act to 
protect the right to vote and the very 
essence of our democracy is now. The 
bill we are considering today meets the 
gravity of this moment. 
H.R. 5746, Mr. Speaker, combines two 
pieces of legislation vital to ensuring 
every American has free, equitable, and 
secure access to the ballot: The Free-
dom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, the 
latter of which critically also includes 
the Native American Voting Rights 
Act. 
Together, Mr. Speaker, these bills 
will combat the wave of voter suppres-
sion laws we saw enacted in States 
across the country following the Su-
preme Court’s decision in Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder, a decision that under-
mined the essential preclearance pro-
tections of the Voting Rights Act, 
which accelerated at an alarming rate 
following 
the 
unprecedented 
voter 
turnout in the 2020 elections. 
Rather than responding to increased 
voter participation with welcoming 
arms and provoter policies, States have 
instead been enacting laws that roll 
back access and aim to erect road-
blocks to the ballot box. 
Despite a 2020 election that election 
security experts said was the most se-
cure in American history, according to 
the Brennan Center For Justice, 19 
States have enacted 34 restrictive vot-
ing laws in the last 12 months. 
The time, Mr. Speaker, to act is now. 
Voter suppression and discrimination 
are alive and well. It is our duty and 
firmly within our constitutional pow-
ers as a Congress to protect the rights 
of the voter and ensure equal access to 
the franchise. 
This bill, Mr. Speaker, does just that. 
It sets nationwide standards for access 
to early voting; promotes voter reg-
istration through automatic voter reg-
istration, same-day voter registration, 
and online voter registration; gives 
every voter access to no-excuse absen-
tee voting; protects the security of our 
election infrastructure and our pre-
cious election workers; addresses the 
rising threat of election subversion; 
puts 
an 
end 
to 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering; curbs the torrent of dark 
money flooding our politics; and, yes, 
it restores the critical protections of 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act and protects 
the right to vote for Native American 
voters. 
We must set an example as a democ-
racy and encourage, rather than sup-
press, voter participation in our elec-
toral process. 
This legislation is critical to pro-
tecting our democracy. I encourage all 
of my colleagues, Democrat and Repub-
lican, to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill, which was 
originally 
about 
NASA 
and 
went 
through the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee, has seen more than 
700 pages of election law tacked onto it 
just late last night. If it were to be-
come law, it would give up to $7.2 mil-
lion of public funding to the campaigns 
of each one of my colleagues, all of us. 
This is not about voting rights. This is 
about power and control. 
Mr. Speaker, $7.2 million is more 
money than most Americans can even 
dream of having. Yet, here we are con-
sidering another Democrat bill that 
takes public funding and, instead of 
giving it to the American people, puts 
it in the campaign coffers of Members 
of Congress. Members who vote for this 
bill are voting to line their own cam-
paign coffers, all while falsely telling 
the American people that we have a 
voting rights crisis in this country and 
that we must pass this bill because the 
era of Jim Crow 2.0 is upon us. 
It is the definition of corruption. 
Thankfully, 
the 
American 
people 
don’t seem to be buying the Demo-
crats’ rhetoric. According to polling, 
more Americans, including Independ-
ents, believe voting laws are too lax 
and insecure than those who believe 
voting laws are too restrictive. 
No matter how many times the 
President and other Democrats get up 
in front of the American people and try 
to manufacture a voting rights crisis in 
this country by using rhetoric like Jim 
Crow 2.0 or now comparing Republicans 
to 
Democrat-elected 
segregationist 
Bull Connor, as President Biden sug-
gested this week in Georgia, there is 
still no evidence of widespread voter 
suppression. 
In our hearings in the House Admin-
istration Committee over the last 3 
years, no one has ever produced a sin-
gle voter who was eligible to vote but 
wasn’t able to. In fact, 2020 saw the 
highest voter turnout in 120 years, and, 
according to Pew, 94 percent of Ameri-
cans say it is easy to vote. 
Misrepresenting and, in some cases, 
flat-out lying about the laws States 
have passed to increase voter con-
fidence in our elections is also part of 
the Democrats’ playbook to manufac-
ture a voting rights crisis. In fact, 
President 
Biden 
has 
earned 
four 
Pinocchios for his false claims about 
Georgia’s voting laws. The laws these 
States are passing to bolster voter con-
fidence make it easier to vote than 
ever before while protecting the integ-
rity of our elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H157 
January 13, 2022 
Georgia’s new ‘‘voter suppression 
law’’ has more days of early, in-person 
voting than New York, and Texas’ 
‘‘voter suppression law’’ ends pandemic 
exceptions like universal drive-thru 
voting and 24-hour voting. Neither ex-
isted in Texas before 2020. Neither 
widely exists even in blue States. I 
think most of us can agree that noth-
ing good can come from 24-hour, drive- 
thru voting. 
The bill we are considering today is 
not about increasing voting rights for 
the American people, and this is not a 
compromise. This bill still contains the 
worst provisions of H.R. 1. 
It still publicly funds Members’ cam-
paigns; nationalizes and centralizes our 
election system; makes Merrick Gar-
land the election czar; puts unelected 
bureaucrats in charge of States’ voting 
laws, instead of the American people; 
destroys the First Amendment; weak-
ens States’ ability to maintain accu-
rate voter rolls; prevents States from 
implementing strict voter ID laws, de-
spite the majority of Americans sup-
porting voter ID laws; and the list goes 
on and on. 
As terrible as those provisions are, 
nothing screams this bill isn’t for the 
American people more than the fact 
that it gives every one of us, every 
Member of Congress and their own 
campaigns, up to $7.2 million in public 
funding. The old saying is: Follow the 
money. I think that is incredibly rel-
evant here. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the chair-
man of the House Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, we are 
here today defending our democracy 
for one reason and one reason alone. It 
is because the radical right has decided 
that the only way they can consist-
ently win elections is to engage in mas-
sive voter suppression. The right to 
vote is sacred. The right to vote is spe-
cial. The right to vote is sacrosanct 
and central to the integrity of our de-
mocracy. 
There are people who died, lost their 
lives, and shed blood to make sure that 
Black people and everyone in America 
could vote. 
We are not going backward. We are 
only going to go forward. You had bet-
ter back up off of us. 
We will pass the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. We will 
pass JOE MANCHIN’s Freedom to Vote 
Act. We will get it to Joe Biden’s desk, 
and we will end the era of voter sup-
pression in America once and for all. 
b 0930 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, defending democracy $7.2 mil-
lion at a time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL), 
a member of the House Administration 
Committee. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, it may be a 
new year, but the Democrats are up to 
the same tricks, providing text of this 
legislation last night for a vote in the 
morning. 
They want to gut key voter integrity 
provisions, and they want to bust the 
Senate’s filibuster in the process to do 
it. 
But I think it is important the Amer-
ican people understand some of the key 
and most egregious provisions in this 
bill. Let me just highlight the top four. 
This bill guts voter ID laws. And the 
irony shouldn’t be lost that these are 
the same Democrats that want you to 
show an ID and a vaccine card to be 
able to have dinner in cities like Wash-
ington, D.C., or New York. 
This bill puts Federal dollars into 
politicians’ reelection campaigns. I 
have heard a lot of complaints about 
elections in my time. I have never had 
one person tell me our elections don’t 
have enough money. 
This bill restricts States’ ability to 
maintain their voter rolls, voter rolls 
that are essential so we know who is 
eligible to vote. 
And this bill mandates that ballots 
can be counted 7 days after the end of 
the election, delaying the final results. 
Delaying the final results does not in-
still confidence in our elections. 
Instead, by working to remove key 
voter integrity provisions in our elec-
tions, Americans will have less con-
fidence in our elections. My priority is 
to make it easy to vote and hard to 
cheat. This bill fails that test, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK), our 
Assistant Speaker. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, the January 6 insurrection 
may have been quelled, but the assault 
on our democracy is alive. 
Across 19 States, Republican legisla-
tures have enacted 33 voter suppression 
laws. Here in Congress, we have wit-
nessed unanimous Republican obstruc-
tion against commonsense, prodemoc-
racy voter protections: early voting, 
vote by mail, election day as a Federal 
holiday. 
When did protecting the right to vote 
become partisan? When it became 
about the powerful and not the people. 
We can’t sit on the sidelines while 
the most precious, sacred tool in our 
democracy is eroded. The question be-
fore us is simple and yet profound: Are 
you for the continuation of our democ-
racy or are you not? 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS), 
my good friend and the ranking mem-
ber on the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to this Federal take-
over of elections. 
I am disappointed that the under-
lying bill has been gutted, a bill that 
was crafted in a bipartisan, practical 
way to address the surplus resources at 
NASA to generate resources for the 
agency. 
I would say this to my friends in the 
majority: I have served in the minority 
and the majority several times back 
and forth. I ask you, why are you try-
ing so hard to make me a chairman 
again? 
We pass a bill today to allow another 
body to pontificate. They will not be 
able to pass anything. You will inflame 
your base because you can’t do any-
thing. You will inflame my base be-
cause you are trying to make dramatic 
changes. Why are you trying to make 
it so easy for me to be a chairman 
again? 
I guess I should thank you, and I 
would, except for things like this 
missed opportunity to reauthorize this 
important 
piece 
of 
legislation 
for 
NASA. 
When 
we 
have 
committees 
like 
Science, Space, and Technology that 
work together, that work in a produc-
tive way, that can persuade the major-
ity of this body to pass their legisla-
tion, we should allow the legislative 
process to work. 
Thank you, my friends. I look for-
ward to the next session. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Ms. 
WILLIAMS), 
my 
friend. 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to share the 
words of my constituent, Yolanda 
Renee King, that I received this morn-
ing: 
‘‘I am 13 years old and the only 
grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., and Coretta Scott King. When I 
was just 5 years old, in 2013, the Su-
preme Court undid the Voting Rights 
Act that my grandparents and so many 
in their generation fought and died for. 
‘‘When I was 12, in 2021, the Supreme 
Court further weakened the law until 
there was almost nothing left. 
‘‘States like my home State of Geor-
gia were ready and waiting. They im-
mediately passed laws that make it 
harder for people to vote, make it im-
possible to protect elections, and even 
criminalize the act of passing out food 
and water to people who wait in long 
lines. 
‘‘That means I and my peers have 
fewer rights today than we had the day 
we were born. I can only imagine what 
my grandparents would say about that. 
We must pass Federal voting rights 
legislation now to ensure democracy 
for all Americans. We cannot wait.’’ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, how much time is remaining 
on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 23 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from North 
Carolina has 24 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
TENNEY), the founder of the Election 
Integrity Caucus and my good friend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H158 
January 13, 2022 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
Groundhog Day again on the House 
floor. Yet again, our Democratic col-
leagues continue to gaslight the Amer-
ican people by claiming that despite 
record turnout in recent elections, Re-
publicans are scheming to steal the sa-
cred right to vote from our fellow citi-
zens. 
What is their solution to the prob-
lem, which they assure you is very 
real? It just so happens to be a partisan 
Federal takeover of elections that em-
powers unelected bureaucrats in Wash-
ington to oversee local elections and 
overturn 
popular 
voting 
protection 
laws. That is not democracy; that is a 
violation of our Constitution. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act, which was deceitfully added to a 
NASA leasing authorities bill in the 
dead of night, is a transparent attempt 
to diminish the voting power of law- 
abiding American citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are right about 
one thing. Democracy and the principle 
of ‘‘one citizen, one vote’’ are indeed 
being threatened. The Democrats are, 
in fact, cynically championing this ef-
fort in spite of the fact that the Demo-
cratic voters in New York State, a 
highly blue Democratic State, rejected 
the very provisions in the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act by a substantial 
margin in a referendum vote just this 
past election. 
With every attempt to allow nonciti-
zens to vote and with each push to ban 
commonsense 
voter 
identification 
laws, Democrats in Congress and in 
places like New York City attack and 
erode election integrity. 
By the way, Article I, Section 4 of 
the U.S. Constitution clearly states 
and protects the rights of our States to 
determine voting laws and practices. 
However, the legislation before us 
today would force upon the Nation a 
laundry list of damaging Federal poli-
cies, creating chaos and insecurity in 
our elections, making it easier to 
cheat, and overriding basic election in-
tegrity measures. 
This assault must be stopped. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
misguided legislation. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), the 
second vice chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus. 
Mrs. 
LAWRENCE. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today I stand on the shoulders of my 
grandmother and my grandfather, who 
migrated to the North from the South, 
who took me every election day, 
dressed up, and educated me every step 
of the way to understand the power of 
the right to vote. She was denied the 
right to vote. 
It is heartbreaking that this bill that 
has been passed time and time again is 
now a political ploy. We now know that 
the freedoms and the rights of Ameri-
cans are based and bred from voting 
rights. I stand here today in support of 
passing this bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the 
Committee on House Administration 
Republicans’ ‘‘Elections Clause’’ re-
port. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION, 
Washington, DC, August 12, 2021. 
Rep. RODNEY DAVIS, Ranking Member 
REPORT—THE
ELECTIONS
CLAUSE: STATES’ 
PRIMARY CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OVER 
ELECTIONS 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Republicans believe that every eligible 
voter who wants to vote must be able to do 
so, and all lawful votes must be counted ac-
cording to state law. Through an examina-
tion of history, precedent, the Framers’ 
words, debates concerning ratification, the 
Supreme Court, and the Constitution itself, 
this document explains the constitutional di-
vision of power envisioned by the Framers 
between the States and the federal govern-
ment with respect to election administra-
tion. Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution 
explains that the States have the primary 
authority over election administration, the 
‘‘times, places, and manner of holding elec-
tions’’. Conversely, the Constitution grants 
the Congress a purely secondary role to alter 
or create election laws only in the extreme 
cases of invasion, legislative neglect, or ob-
stinate refusal to pass election laws. As do 
other aspects of our federal system, this divi-
sion of sovereignty continues to serve to pro-
tect one of Americans’ most precious free-
doms, the right to vote. 
The Constitution reserves to the States 
the primary authority to set election legisla-
tion and administer elections—the ‘‘times, 
places, and manner of holding of elections’’ 
and Congress’ power in this space is purely 
second to the States’ power. Congress’ power 
is to be employed only in the direst of cir-
cumstances. Despite Democrats’ insistence 
that Congress’ power over elections is unfet-
tered and permits Congress to enact sweep-
ing legislation like H.R. 1, it is simply not 
true. History, precedent, the Framers’ words, 
debates concerning ratification, the Supreme 
Court, and the Constitution itself make this 
exceedingly clear. 
The Framing Generation grappled with the 
failure of the Articles of Confederation, 
which provided for only a weak national gov-
ernment incapable of preserving the Union. 
Under the Articles, the States had exclusive 
authority over federal elections held within 
their territory. but, given the difficulties the 
national government had experienced with 
State cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode 
Island to send delegates to the Confederation 
Congress); the Federalists, including Alex-
ander Hamilton, were concerned with the 
possibility that the States, in an effort to de-
stroy the federal government, simply might 
not hold elections or that an emergency, 
such as an invasion or insurrection, might 
prevent the operation of a State’s govern-
ment, leaving the Congress without Members 
and the federal government unable to re-
spond. Indeed, as counsel for the Democrat 
Members of our Committee so keenly ob-
served: 
For the Founders, particularly during the 
Federal Constitutional Convention, the pri-
mary concern was informing the discussions 
of federal elections in Article I was the risk 
of uncooperative states. For example, Alex-
ander Hamilton noted that by providing 
states the authority to run congressional 
elections, 
under 
Article 
I, 
Section 
4, 
‘‘risk[ed] ‘leaving the existence of the Union 
entirely at their mercy.’ ’’ Following the 
failings of the Articles of Confederation, the 
Founders looked for processes that would in-
sulate Congress from recalcitrant states. In-
deed, ‘‘[t]he dominant purpose of the Elec-
tions Clause, the historical record bears out, 
was to empower Congress to override state 
election rules, not to restrict the way States 
enact legislation[,]’’ and that ‘‘the Clause 
‘was the Framers’ insurance against the pos-
sibility that a State would refuse to provide 
for the election of representatives to the 
Federal Congress.’ ’’. 
Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a lead-
ing Federalist and proponent of our Con-
stitution, understood the Elections Clause as 
serving only as a sort of emergency fail-safe, 
not as a cudgel used to nationalize our elec-
tions process. Writing as Publius to the peo-
ple of New York, Hamilton further expounds 
on the correct understanding of the Elec-
tions Clause: ‘‘T[he] natural order of the sub-
ject leads us to consider, in this place, that 
provision of the Constitution which author-
izes the national legislature to regulate, in 
the last resort, the election of its own mem-
bers.’’ 
When questioned at the States’ constitu-
tional ratifying conventions with respect to 
this provision, the Federalists confirmed this 
understanding of a constitutionally limited, 
secondary congressional power under Article 
1, Section 4: 
Maryland: 
Convention delegate James McHenry added 
that the risk to the federal government 
[without a fail-safe provision] might not 
arise from state malice: An insurrection or 
rebellion might prevent a state legislature 
from administering an election. 
North Carolina: 
An occasion may arise when the exercise of 
this ultimate power of Congress may be nec-
essary . . . a state should be involved in war, 
and its legislature could not assemble, (as 
was the case of South Carolina and occasion-
ally of some other states, during the [Revo-
lutionary] war). 
Pennsylvania: 
Sir, let it be remembered that this power 
can only operate in a case of necessity, after 
the factious or listless disposition of a par-
ticular state has rendered an interference es-
sential to the salvation of the general gov-
ernment. 
John Jay made similar claims in New 
York. And, as constitutional scholar Robert 
Natelson, notes in his invaluable article, The 
Original Scope of the Congressional Power to 
Regulate Elections, Alexander Contee Han-
son, a member of Congress whose pamphlet 
supporting the Constitution proved popular, 
stated flatly that Congress would exercise its 
times, places, and manner authority only in 
cases of invasion, legislative neglect or ob-
stinate refusal to pass election laws [pro-
viding for the election of Members of Con-
gress], or if a state crafted its election laws 
with a ‘sinister purpose’ or to injure the gen-
eral government.’’ 
Cementing his point, Hanson goes further 
to decree, ‘‘The exercise of this power must 
at all times be so very invidious, that con-
gress will not venture upon it without some 
very cogent and substantial reason.’’ In 
Floor debate during the 117th Congress con-
cerning H.R. 1, the Democrats’ intended na-
tionalization of elections, Ranking Member 
Davis argued, as he has many other times, 
that: 
According to Article 1, Section 4 of the 
Constitution, States have the primary role 
in establishing ‘‘[t]he Times, Places and 
Manner of holding Elections for Senators 
and Representatives.’’ Under the Constitu-
tion, Congress has a purely secondary role in 
this space and must restrain itself from act-
ing improperly and unconstitutionally. Fed-
eral election legislation should never be the

first step and must never impose burden-
some, unfunded federal mandates on state 
and local elections officials. When Congress 
does speak, it must devote its efforts only to 
resolving highly significant and substantial 
deficiencies. State legislatures are the pri-
mary venues to correct most issues. 
In fact, had the Democrats’ view of the 
Elections Clause been accepted at the time 
of the Constitution’s drafting—that is, that 
it offers Congress unfettered power over fed-
eral elections—it is likely that the Constitu-
tion would not have been ratified or that an 
amendment to this language would have 
been required. Indeed, at least seven of the 
original 13 states—over half and enough to 
prevent the Constitution from being rati-
fied—expressd specific concerns with the lan-
guage of the Elections Clause. However, 
‘‘[l]eading Federalists . . . assured them, . . . 
that, even without amendment, the [Elec-
tions] Clause should be construed as limited 
to emergencies.’’ 
Three states, New York, North Carolina, 
and Rhode Island, specifically made their 
ratification 
contingent 
on 
this 
under-
standing being made express: 
New York: 
Under these impressions and declaring that 
the rights aforesaid cannot be abridged or 
violated, and the Explanations aforesaid are 
consistent with the said Constitution, And in 
confidence that the Amendments which have 
been proposed to the said Constitution will 
receive early and mature Consideration: We 
the said Delegates, in the Name and in [sic] 
the behalf of the People of the State of New 
York Do by these presents Assent to and 
Ratify the said Constitution. In full Con-
fidence . . . that the Congress will not make 
or alter any Regulation in this State re-
specting the times places and manner of 
holding Elections for Senators or Represent-
atives unless the Legislature of this State 
shall neglect or refuse to make laws or regu-
lations for the purpose, or from any cir-
cumstance be incapable of making the same, 
and that in those cases such power will only 
be exercised until the Legislature of this 
State 
shall 
make 
provision 
in 
the 
Premises[.] 
North Carolina: 
That Congress shall not alter, modify, or 
interfere in the times, places, or manner of 
holding elections for senators and represent-
atives, or either of them, except when the 
legislature of any state shall neglect, refuse 
or be disabled by invasion or rebellion, to 
prescribe the same. 
Rhode Island: 
Under these impressions, and declaring, 
that the rights aforesaid cannot be abridged 
or violated, and that the explanations afore-
said, are consistent with the said constitu-
tion, and in confidence that the amendments 
hereafter mentioned, will receive an early 
and mature consideration, and conformably 
to the fifth article of said constitution, 
speedily become a part thereof; We the said 
delegates, in the name, and in [sic] the be-
half of the People, of the State of Rhode-Is-
land and Providence-Plantations, do by these 
Presents, assent to, and ratify the said Con-
stitution. In full confidence . . . That the 
Congress will not make or alter any regula-
tion in this State, respecting the times, 
places and manner of holding elections for 
senators and representatives, unless the leg-
islature of this state shall neglect, or refuse 
to make laws or regulations for the purpose, 
or from any circumstance be incapable of 
making the same; and that [i]n those cases, 
such power will only be exercised, until the 
legislature of this State shall make provi-
sion in the Premises[.] 
This clearly demonstrates that the Fram-
ers designed and the ratifying States under-
stood the Elections Clause to serve solely as 
a protective backstop to ensure the preserva-
tion of the Federal Government, not as a 
font of limitless power for Congress to wrest 
control of federal elections from the States. 
This understanding was also reinforced by 
debate during the first Congress that con-
vened under the Constitution. ‘‘During the 
first session of the First Congress . . . Rep-
resentative Aedanus Burke unsuccessfully 
proposed a constitutional amendment to 
limit the Times, Places and Manner Clause 
to emergencies. But those on both sides of 
the Burke amendment debate already under-
stood the Elections Clause to limit Federal 
elections power to emergencies. 
For example, the recorded description of 
opponent Representative Goodhue’s com-
ments notes that he believed the Elections 
Clause as written was intended to prevent 
‘‘. . . 
the 
State 
Governments 
[from] 
oppos[ing] and thwart[ing] the general one to 
such a degree as finally to overturn it. Now, 
to guard against this evil, he wished the Fed-
eral Government to possess every power nec-
essary to its existence.’’ With any change to 
the original text therefore unnecessary to 
achieve Burke’s desired goal, Mr. Goodhue 
voted against the proposed amendment. 
Similarly, 
proponent 
Representative 
Smith of South Carolina also believed the 
original text of the Elections Clause already 
limited the Federal Government’s power 
over federal elections to emergencies and so 
thought there would be no harm in sup-
porting an amendment to make that lan-
guage express. So, even the records of the 
First Congress reflect a recognition of the 
emergency nature of congressional power 
over federal elections. 
Similarly, the Supreme Court has sup-
ported this understanding. In Smiley v. 
Holm, the Court held that Article 1, Section 
4 of the Constitution reserved to the States 
the primary authority to provide a complete 
code for congressional elections, not only as 
to times and places, but in relation to no-
tices, registration, supervision of voting, 
protection of voters, prevention of fraud and 
corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties 
of inspectors and canvassers, and making 
and publication of election returns; in short, 
to enact the numerous requirements as to 
procedure and safeguards which experience 
shows are necessary in order to enforce the 
fundamental right involved. And these re-
quirements would be nugatory if they did 
not have appropriate sanctions in the defini-
tion of offenses and punishments. All this is 
comprised in the subject of ‘‘times, places 
and manner of holding elections,’’ and in-
volves lawmaking in its essential features 
and most important aspect. 
This holding, of course, is consistent with 
the understanding of the Elections Clause 
since the framing of the Constitution. The 
Smiley Court also held that while Congress 
maintains the authority to . . . supplement 
these state regulations or [to] substitute its 
own[]’’, such authority remains merely ‘‘ ‘a 
general supervisory power over the whole 
subject.’ ’’ More recently, the Court noted in 
Arizona v. Inter-Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc. 
that ‘‘[t]his grant of congressional power 
[that is, the fail-safe provision in the Elec-
tions Clause] was the Framers’ insurance 
against the possibility that a State would 
refuse to provide for the election of rep-
resentatives to the Federal Congress.’’ The 
Court explained that the Elections Clause 
‘‘. . . imposes [upon the States] the duty . . . 
to prescribe the time, place, and manner of 
electing Representatives and Senators[.]’’ 
And, while, as the Court noted, ‘‘[t]he power 
of Congress over the ‘Times, Places and Man-
ner’ of congressional elections ‘is para-
mount, and may be exercised at any time, 
and to any extent which it deems expedient; 
and so far as it is exercised, and no farther, 
the regulations effected supersede those of 
the 
State 
which 
are 
inconsistent 
therewith[]’’, the Inter-Tribal Court ex-
plained, quoting extensively from The Fed-
eralist no. 59, that it was clear that the con-
gressional fail-safe included in the Elections 
Clause was intended for the sorts of govern-
mental self-preservation discussed in this 
Report: ‘‘[E]very government ought to con-
tain 
in 
itself 
the 
means 
of 
its 
own 
preservation[.]’’; ‘‘[A]n exclusive power of 
regulating elections for the national govern-
ment, in the hands of the State legislatures, 
would leave the existence of the Union en-
tirely at their mercy. They could at any mo-
ment annihilate it by neglecting to provide 
for the choice of persons to administer its af-
fairs.’’ 
CONCLUSION 
It is clear in every respect that the con-
gressional fail-safe described in the Elections 
Clause vests purely secondary authority over 
federal elections in the federal legislative 
branch and that the primary authority rests 
with the States. Congressional authority is 
intended to be, and as a matter of constitu-
tional fact is, limited to addressing the 
worst imaginable issues, such as invasion or 
other matters that might lead to a State not 
electing representatives to constitute the 
two Houses of Congress. Our authority has 
never extended to the day-to-day authority 
over the ‘‘Times, Places and Manner of Elec-
tion’’ that the Constitution clearly reserves 
to the States. Unfortunately for Democrats, 
this clear restriction on congressional au-
thority means that we do not have the power 
to implement the overwhelming majority—if 
not the entirety—of their biggest legislative 
priority, H.R. 1 and related legislation, 
which would purport to nationalize our elec-
tions and centralize their administration in 
Washington, D.C. Thankfully, the Framers 
had the foresight to write our Constitution 
so as to prevent those bad policies from 
going into effect and preserve the health of 
our republic. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO), 
my good friend. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in opposition to H.R. 5746. 
Late last night, the Democrats hi-
jacked a bipartisan piece of legislation 
that I helped draft to allow NASA to 
lease property and help fund their own 
budget shortfalls. This bill would have 
been vital to America’s space program 
and Mississippi’s Fourth District, with 
Stennis Space Center in our backyard. 
To no one’s surprise, Democrat so-
cialists, hell-bent on minimizing the 
power 
of 
American 
voters, 
have 
jammed through their radical agenda 
to include this so-called voting rights 
legislation. 
This legislation only does one thing: 
It ensures that Democrats remain in 
power by tipping the scales by limiting 
your First Amendment and slashing 
States’ rights. 
Why else would the Democrats spend 
so much time catering to noncitizens, 
giving them taxpayer benefits, allow-
ing them to stay in our country, and 
now giving them the ability to uncon-
stitutionally vote in American elec-
tions? 
Democrats believe that behind every 
illegal immigrant is a Democrat voter 
only waiting for a bill like this to pass.

January 13, 2022 
This legislation shreds our founding 
documents and bastardizes the sacred 
rights of American citizens only to ap-
pease a group of socialists. 
We all know that Democrats need 
every advantage to give them any hope 
in November after seeing their Com-
mander in Chief’s gross incompetence 
and tanking approval ratings. They 
have the slimmest House majority in 
history and an even split in the Senate, 
stalemated by a few Democrats who 
refuse to bow to the demands of this 
socialist agenda. 
Democrats know the American peo-
ple reject their ridiculous policies, and 
we cannot allow them to cheat their 
way back into power with this bill. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this hijacked bill. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), the dean of the Florida dele-
gation. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, let’s be clear about what is 
happening here. We are at a crossroads. 
Free and fair elections are essential to 
keeping this fragile democracy intact. 
The American people must hear this 
loud and clear: There are people in 
power who don’t want you to vote, and 
they are using every tool in their tool-
box to make it harder. 
My fellow Americans, you cannot af-
ford to sleep on this. People in power 
and with influence are actively trying 
to take away your right to vote. Amer-
ica must confront this harsh reality. 
They are purging voter rolls, making 
voter registration more difficult, and 
cracking down on vote by mail, all 
while we remain in the midst of a pan-
demic. 
Voter suppression has not been con-
signed to the history books. It con-
tinues today, right here, right now, and 
the impact continues to fall dispropor-
tionately on communities of color. 
These policies are being actively pur-
sued all over the country in places like 
my home State of Florida, where the 
Governor wants to create a voting po-
lice force to intimidate voters. 
We must not allow those who seek to 
consolidate power and put a thumb on 
the scales of the democratic process to 
succeed. 
Our friends in the Senate must stand 
up for democracy and restore govern-
ment of, by, and for the people. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY), 
my good friend. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, in a des-
perate attempt to maintain their wan-
ing grip on power, the majority is at-
tempting to hijack a bill related to 
NASA in order to promote voter fraud 
and invalidate State voter ID laws. 
But that is not all. The Democrats 
want to institutionalize ballot har-
vesting schemes, mandate the use of 
unverifiable mail ballots, and pour 
public dollars into the campaign cof-
fers of wealthy politicians. 
You heard that right, Mr. and Mrs. 
America. 
Bidenflation 
skyrockets 
while Democrats are going to raid the 
Treasury to pay for their political ads. 
But that is just the beginning. 
A few days ago, New York City 
adopted a policy allowing noncitizens 
to vote, effectively legalizing foreign 
election interference. You can bet this 
will 
stretch 
to 
Minneapolis, 
Mil-
waukee, and Madison. In that respect, 
perhaps it is fitting that the majority 
has chosen a NASA bill to advance 
their cynical agenda and pave the way 
for alien voting. 
This is one giant leap backward for 
American election integrity, and if the 
majority actually thinks this bill is 
the solution to what is ailing America, 
Houston, we have a problem. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES), the author 
of the For the People Act. 
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, out in 
the country, the voice of the people is 
diminished by voter suppression, par-
tisan gerrymandering, and election 
subversion. 
Here in Washington, the voice of the 
people is diminished by big money, the 
insiders, and the lobbyists, who use 
their influence to block progress on so 
many of the things that Americans 
care about. 
But we can do something about this. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act will ensure free and fair access to 
the ballot box, with expanded registra-
tion opportunities and the broad avail-
ability of early voting and vote by 
mail, something that voters of both po-
litical parties took advantage of in the 
last election. 
It will ban partisan gerrymandering 
so that congressional districts are 
drawn fairly and with respect for the 
people. 
It will prevent the arbitrary removal 
of local election officials from their po-
sitions, and it will protect election of-
ficials from harassment and intimida-
tion. 
It will pull dark money out of the 
shadows in order to combat the cor-
rupting influence on our democracy. 
It will make meaningful investments 
in efforts led by the States to strength-
en and fortify their electoral infra-
structure. 
Too many Americans have become 
cynical about our politics, and they are 
angry. But there is hope in that anger 
because it means they still care; they 
still believe in American democracy; 
they cherish it. 
In November 2020, 150 million Ameri-
cans overcame tremendous obstacles to 
get to the ballot box, to pull our de-
mocracy back from the brink. 
The question now is, will we do our 
part? As their elected Representatives, 
will we show that our love for this 
great Republic is equal to theirs? Will 
we exercise the right to vote that we 
have in this Chamber in order to pro-
tect the right of every American to 
vote in their local library or their fire-
house or senior center? 
The answer must be yes. And after we 
pass this bill in the House, we look to 
our Senate colleagues to do whatever 
they can to secure the passage in that 
Chamber. 
The stakes are too high. Failure is 
not an option.

Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a re-
port by Common Cause that is titled: 
‘‘Maryland General Assembly Approves 
Gerrymandered Congressional Map.’’ 
[From the Common Cause Maryland, Dec. 8, 
2021] 
MARYLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPROVES 
GERRYMANDERED CONGRESSIONAL MAP 
Today, the Maryland General Assembly 
passed HB 1—the congressional districting 
plan adopted by the Legislative Redis-
tricting Advisory Commission (LRAC). The 
map is now headed to Governor Hogan’s 
desk. 
STATEMENT OF JOANNE ANTOINE, COMMON 
CAUSE MARYLAND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
When the redistricting process is led by 
politicians, the maps will be drawn to benefit 
the politicians—and that’s exactly what 
state legislators have done today. 
While we were encouraged by the General 
Assembly’s willingness to improve trans-
parency and access throughout the process 
in comparison to the 2011 redistricting cycle, 
they have chosen to maintain the status quo. 
They had an opportunity to do what’s in 
the best interest of Marylanders for the next 
decade and have chosen, yet again, to wait 
on a national solution. While I’m not sur-
prised, I am disappointed. 
Thank you to public for making their 
voices heard and Delegate Gabriel Acevero 
(D–Montgomery) for taking a stand against 
partisan gerrymandering here in Maryland 
and nationwide by being the lone Democratic 
vote against the congressional map. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 5746, which contains the 
text of H.R. 4, the so-called John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
With H.R. 4, Democrats are attempt-
ing to orchestrate yet another radical 
and unprecedented Federal power grab 
over State-administered elections, this 
time under the guise of updating the 
Voting Rights Act. 
But the history here is so important. 
Upon its enactment in 1965, the VRA 
employed extraordinary measures to 
address pervasive State resistance to 
removing radically discriminatory bar-
riers that did at that time prevent mi-
norities from exercising their right to 
vote. 
But here is what is important: After 
exhaustive review in 2013, the U.S. Su-
preme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder 
decision recognized an obvious fact 
when examining the Voting Rights 
Act: Things have changed dramatically 
since 1965. 
Of course, that fact should be cele-
brated. The Court reasoned that requir-
ing States to preclear election law

changes today based on conduct a half 
century ago was an unconstitutional 
invasion of State sovereignty. 
Republicans are thrilled the VRA 
worked. The truth is that more Ameri-
cans from minority communities are 
voting now than ever before, and over-
all voting registration remains sky 
high. 
In fact, voting registration dispari-
ties between minority and nonminority 
voters in States like Texas, Florida, 
North Carolina, Mississippi, and Lou-
isiana are below the national average— 
and get this—lower than Democrat-run 
States like California, New York, and 
Delaware. 
However, Democrats would have you 
think exactly the opposite. They want 
to bring preclearance back through 
H.R. 4 and have all the States seek ap-
proval from Merrick Garland’s Justice 
Department before they can make any 
changes to their election laws or redis-
tricting, regardless of whether that ju-
risdiction has a history of discrimina-
tion or not. 
Again, this is a blatant Federal 
power grab. These bills are contrary to 
the Founders’ intent, the plain text of 
the Constitution, and if they are fully 
implemented, they will further erode 
Americans’ faith and confidence in our 
government institutions. 
We remain hopeful that the people of 
our country will see this. We urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote today. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), the distin-
guished and unrelenting chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, des-
perate attempts? Hijacking our voting 
rights? That is exactly what our Re-
publican colleagues are doing. 
And why? Because when Democrats 
vote, Democrats win, and we provide 
for our children, our families, and our 
businesses. 
I stand here today in support of the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act of 
2022 because Black people representing 
the Congressional Black Caucus have 
stood in line, have been attacked by 
dogs, have put their lives on the line, 
and crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
for us to have the right to vote. 
America, watch what is happening 
today. Watch what Republicans are 
trying to do: Take away your funda-
mental right to vote. 
Let us restore our democracy. Let’s 
stand up for what four Republican 
Presidents in the past did. They reau-
thorized the Voting Rights Act. Repub-
licans are scared, and they are hijack-
ing Americans’ rights. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, you can tell it must be NFL 
playoffs, as I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS), my 
good friend and our Super Bowl cham-
pion from the Oakland Raiders. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, late yes-
terday afternoon my Republican col-
leagues and I learned that Democrats 
were dropping H.R. 1 and H.R. 4 into 
what was supposed to be a NASA bill. 
The American people join me in won-
dering why Democrats must resort to 
procedural gimmicks to ram voting 
rights bills to the floor. 
The answer is simple: Democrats are 
out of touch with Americans, who re-
peatedly rejected the Biden adminis-
tration’s far-left agenda, including its 
latest attempt to destroy the power of 
States to run their own elections. 
Unfortunately, we are hearing the 
same message today that we have 
heard over and over again from the 
Democrats: That minority Americans 
are not smart enough, not educated 
enough, and incapable of following 
basic rules to vote in Federal elections. 
And I am personally offended by this 
narrative. 
Earlier this year, Senate Democrats 
held a hearing titled: ‘‘Jim Crow 2021: 
The Latest Assault on the Right to 
Vote’’ where they compared the recent 
voting laws in Georgia to the Jim Crow 
laws in the days of segregation. 
As I stated in that hearing, I grew up 
in the Deep South during the era of ac-
tual Jim Crow laws that suppressed 
voting. 
What does actual voter suppression 
look like? It looks like poll taxes, 
property tests, literacy tests, and vio-
lence and intimidation at the polls. It 
looks like the segregated schools I at-
tended in Florida or the separate 
drinking fountains and restrooms that 
my race was forced to use. 
One section of the Georgia law that 
brought so much outrage from the left 
simply requires everyone applying for 
an absentee ballot to include evidence 
of a government-issued ID on their ap-
plication. 
I can assure you, my friends, minori-
ties are capable of getting a driver’s li-
cense, passport, government check or 
any other number of acceptable IDs. 
Today’s misnamed For the People 
Act won’t fool Americans who have not 
forgotten how far we have come since 
1965 and who hold sacred their con-
stitutional right to vote. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
jecting this latest attempt to remove 
power from the people and the States 
that best represent them. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), who 
serves on the Committee on House Ad-
ministration and the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to help bring this bill to the 
floor and to push for its consideration 
in the Senate. 
Pennsylvania—and 
Philadelphia, 
which I represent—is the birthplace of 
our democratic Republic, but it is now 
ground zero in the battle for the soul of 
our Nation. 
A decade ago, when the last redis-
tricting occurred, the Pennsylvania 
legislature launched an attack on elec-
tion rights, which has only escalated 
over the years. Voters have had to bat-
tle in court to get fair districts and to 
overturn discriminatory voter ID laws 
that threaten to disenfranchise more 
than half a million eligible Pennsyl-
vania voters. And in the last 2 years we 
have seen these threats multiply as the 
former President and his far-right al-
lies have tried over and over again to 
make it harder to vote and to throw 
out the legal votes of Pennsylvania’s 
eligible voters. 
This bill is not a takeover of State 
elections, it is a response to attempts 
by State legislatures, like Pennsylva-
nia’s, to make it harder for Americans 
to express their most essential free-
dom—voting—by exercising our duty 
under Article I Section 4 of the Con-
stitution to protect that right. 
I urge all of my colleagues, no matter 
what party, to support this legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire as to how much 
time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 15 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from North 
Carolina has 18 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), the 
ranking member of the House Judici-
ary Committee and my good friend. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have ob-
jected to counting the Presidential 
electors every single time this century 
a Republican has been elected Presi-
dent. 
They spent 4 years trying to overturn 
the 2016 election. Democrats spied on a 
Presidential campaign, they did im-
peachment in secret based on a so- 
called whistleblower, whose identity 
only Congressman SCHIFF got to know. 
This Congress they have closed the 
Capitol, enacted proxy voting, kicked 
Republicans off committees, and for 
the first time in American history de-
nied Republicans seats on a select com-
mittee that was chosen by the minor-
ity leader. 
They are trying to make D.C. a 
State, end the electoral college, end 
the filibuster, pack the Court, destroy 
executive privilege, take Federal con-
trol of elections, and are currently al-
lowing in jurisdictions illegal immi-
grants to vote. 
And finally, the Select Committee to 
Investigate the January 6th Attack on 
the United States Capitol has altered 
evidence and lied to the American peo-
ple about it. 
But somehow, they tell us it is Presi-
dent Trump and Republicans who are 
undermining democracy? Give me a 
break. 
Undermining democracy because we 
actually think you should show a 
photo ID when you go to vote? 
In 1 year’s time, while Democrats are 
doing all that, in 1 year’s time they 
have given us record crime, record in-
flation, record illegal immigration. 
And as bad as all that is, it is not the 
worst. The worst is how they have used 
the virus to attack our freedoms, how 
they have used the virus to attack our

First Amendment rights. And here is 
the irony: They used the virus to at-
tack our liberties, even though every-
thing they have told us about the virus 
has been wrong. 
They told us it didn’t come from a 
lab. They told us it wasn’t gain-of- 
function research. They told us it was 
only 15 days to slow the spread. They 
told us masks worked. They told us we 
have a Federal plan. Joe Biden said 
that himself. They have told us there 
would never be a vaccine mandate. 
They told us people who get vaccinated 
can’t get the virus, the vaccinated 
can’t transmit the virus, and they told 
us there was no such thing as natural 
immunity. 
Think about this: At the same time 
Democrats require you to put on a 
mask, show your papers and an ID to 
get a Big Mac at McDonald’s, they 
want to allow the Federal Government 
to stop States from requiring a photo 
ID to vote. 
This is ridiculous. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this legislation. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), my friend 
who serves on the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Our democracy is built on the sacred 
principle that every American has an 
equal and fair right to vote. But States 
like my home State of Texas are im-
posing laws that are already limiting 
that very sacred right. 
Between bills like SB1 and extreme 
gerrymandering, the voices of many 
Texans are being diluted and silenced, 
especially Latinos. We cannot let this 
stand. 
It is our responsibility, our duty to 
protect voting rights for every Amer-
ican, no matter what ZIP Code they 
live in or what language they speak. 
The Freedom to Vote Act will do just 
that for Latinos and for all Americans. 
By banning partisan gerrymandering, 
restoring the Voting Rights Act, and 
creating new protections for voters, we 
will ensure every American makes 
their voice heard. 
Mi voto, mi voz. 
(English translation of Spanish is as 
follows: My vote, my voice.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend Mr. DAVIS of Illinois for 
yielding. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Democrats 
have 
a 
scheme to take over elections, and it 
has taken a very disturbing turn. The 
Federal takeover of elections bill is 
masquerading as what was a non-
controversial NASA bill. 
The Constitution, Mr. Speaker, is 
clear: State legislators alone deter-
mine the time, place, and manner of 
elections, period. 
Voter participation, Mr. Speaker, 
over the past 20 years has enormously 
increased; it is well over 70 percent at 
this point because States have imple-
mented policies assuring easy access 
while maintaining voter integrity to 
the best of their ability. 
Nevertheless, Democrats want a Fed-
eral takeover of all elections. This plan 
legalizes ballot harvesting nationwide, 
bans voter ID laws. Does America hear 
that? Prohibits the ability to ask for 
an ID to vote. Somehow that is in the 
interest of our election integrity. I 
don’t think so. 
It allows noncitizens to vote, Mr. 
Speaker, and imposes new mandates on 
all precincts, regardless of their size or 
resources. Perhaps most egregiously, 
they want to provide millions of dol-
lars in taxpayer funding for campaigns. 
Under this new taxpayer scheme, the 
American taxpayer would give our 
Speaker of the House $22 million and a 
whopping $44 million to Senate Major-
ity Leader CHUCK SCHUMER for his cam-
paign. 
Americans can’t get COVID tests, 
hospitals are being overwhelmed, busi-
nesses can’t find workers, and this is 
the focus, to blow up the Senate fili-
buster and seize control of all elections 
to secure future Democrat majorities. 
Let’s vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
the Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER), my friend. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in ro-
bust support of the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act. I believe this is the 
most important vote any of us will 
ever vote upon. This is the bill that 
saves our democracy. 
The most fundamental idea of our ex-
ceptional Nation is that people have 
the right to choose their leaders. 
And we have made slow progress over 
the centuries. African Americans, Na-
tive Americans, women, 18-year-olds. 
This bill finally establishes the basic 
fundamental 
voting 
rights 
for 
all 
Americans. 
With this act we stand against efforts 
to manipulate voting rules in favor of 
the few and take our essential demo-
cratic privilege away from all Ameri-
cans. 
NASA has inspired humanity for cen-
turies, and now a small NASA bill be-
comes the vehicle to save our democ-
racy. 
b 1000 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I think 
it is important as we have this debate, 
frankly, on a bill that was dropped last 
night with provisions that have gone 
through this Chamber before which, 
frankly, have gone nowhere in the Sen-
ate, it is important to understand for 
the context of this discussion that I ac-
tually represent a preclearance county. 
I have lived in one for 20 years. It is 
Collier County, Florida. 
You see, Collier County was subject 
to preclearance in 1965 under the Vot-
ing Rights Act. But since I have lived 
there the last 20 years, there has been 
no evidence whatsoever that Collier 
County should even continue to be sub-
ject to preclearance. So much so that 
the Supreme Court agreed and actually 
decided that it was no longer needed to 
do preclearance in the United States 
because the evidence did not suggest it. 
But what this bill seeks to do is un-
leash preclearance across the entire 
United States with no evidence for it 
being needed, the evidence that did 
exist in 1965. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent such a coun-
ty today, and something tells me that 
in 1965, I wouldn’t have represented 
that county then at that time. I do 
today. The evidence is clear. There is 
no reason to unleash preclearance on 
the United States, no need at all. The 
other provisions of the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act still exists today and will 
continue to exist. But the preclearance 
provision is no longer needed. 
So what is this really about? This is 
really about making sure that politi-
cians have direct control over how 
elections are going to be administered 
in the several States which, by the 
way, is a violation of the United States 
Constitution. Voting laws are supposed 
to be enacted by State legislatures, not 
here in Congress. That is the way the 
Constitution is written. 
So I think this is a bad bill. We 
should not be doing this, let alone 
funding, doing public financing of Fed-
eral elections. Why would we ever want 
to do anything like that? We have 
more than enough money in our elec-
tions. We seem to spend billions of dol-
lars every cycle doing this stuff. We 
want more? We want to take it from 
the taxpayer? It is outrageous. Vote 
‘‘no’’ on this measure. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), my friend, the 
distinguished Democratic leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have 
grown up and become cognizant of pub-
lic affairs in the late 1950s and early 
1960s. It is ironic that today, I am hear-
ing the language of interposition of 
States’ rights. There were a lot of 
States’ rights in the 1950s and the 1940s 
and 1960s. And John Lewis will tell you 
those States’ rights kept people from 
voting, from participating, from play-
ing a role. 
Now, we have legislation before us 
that will ensure, as the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 assured, that people would 
not be shut out by States’ rights by 
people who wanted to keep certain 
other people from voting and partici-
pating in their State’s elections, in 
their county’s election, in their munic-
ipal election, in their city election. 
I have heard a lot about States’ 
rights. I am old enough to have heard 
about what States’ rights meant. They 
meant don’t butt in to assure that

every United States citizen, one na-
tion, under God, indivisible. But we 
were divisible. We were divisible by 
color and by other arbitrary and un-
justified distinctions. So we are here 
today to say that is not America. That 
is not one nation under God, indivis-
ible. 
So, yes, all the States will be covered 
because we want all States to comply, 
and they will not have a thing to worry 
about under this legislation if they 
have not had violations within the 20- 
year period. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, we will 
mark what would have been Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr.’s, 93rd birthday. When 
he was born in 1929, it had only been 9 
years, just 9 years from the date of his 
birth that women were given the op-
portunity to vote in America. How sad 
that it took us so long. When he was 
born in 1929, it had only been 9 years 
since the 19th amendment had been 
passed, and it had only been 64 years 
since the amendments ending slavery 
and ostensibly guaranteeing the right 
to vote for African Americans. 
But that constitutional amendment 
was not honored. And ways and means 
were found to prevent people from vot-
ing, from registering. And so, yes, the 
Supreme Court passed the decision in 
Shelby v. Holder, Shelby in Alabama, a 
county that had discriminated greatly 
and was discriminating at that point in 
time. And as soon as the Supreme 
Court said this is no longer necessary, 
we saw a cascade of new laws to re-
strict access to the ballot box—a cas-
cade. 
When Dr. King was born, neither Af-
rican-American men or African-Amer-
ican women could cast ballots and par-
ticipate in our democracy in many 
States and jurisdictions, North and 
South. Before he was killed, at just 39 
years of age, Dr. King led a movement 
to correct the injustices that had come 
about because for so long many Ameri-
cans had no recourse to participate in 
our democracy or pursue opportunities 
equally because their States felt they 
had the right to discriminate. That is 
what State rights were in my genera-
tion. And apparently, the concept still 
exists, but that is the right. 
The right to vote is the guarantee to 
all others. Dr. King joined by other gi-
ants of the Civil Rights Movement, in-
cluding our dear friend and brother. 
My, my, my, G.K. and I were just say-
ing how sad we are that John Lewis is 
not on this floor, who gave blood and 
almost his life but lived his life to as-
sure that every American had the right 
to vote and was facilitated in that 
right. 
Dr. King, joined by other giants of 
the Civil Rights Movement, including 
our friend and brother, John Lewis, 
used the tools of nonviolent, peaceful 
protest in organizing to expose the hy-
pocrisy of a system that called itself a 
democracy but did not allow all of its 
citizens to share in electing leaders. 
Each year, on Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s, birthday, Americans reflect on 
the lessons of his life and on the Civil 
Rights 
Movement 
as 
though 
they 
formed a chapter in America’s past. 
Would that they mirrored simply the 
past. But if we look around us today, 
there can be no doubt that the fight for 
our democracy is very much a part of 
our present. 
Now, this is a radical bill that will 
allow process of the United States Sen-
ate that is a failing practice. The ma-
jority will rule on debating this bill— 
the majority. It is not a radical pro-
posal that the majority of the Senate 
that is for this bill. When people get up 
and say, Oh, this bill can’t pass. The 
only reason it can’t pass is because the 
minority will stop it, if they can. I 
hope they can’t. I hope they change the 
rules. I am an opponent of the fili-
buster. It is undemocratic, and as Ham-
ilton said, it poisons democracy. 
The right to vote has not been so en-
dangered since Dr. King walked among 
us. But there is a remedy. It is not per-
fect but it will go a long way toward 
turning back the tide of voter suppres-
sion in protecting the fundamental 
right to vote. One nation, under God, 
indivisible. All of us could vote. The 
legislation incorporated into this bill 
represents the boldest and most con-
sequential voting rights reforms in a 
generation. 
I was the sponsor of the Help Amer-
ica Vote Act. It was called then a very 
consequential bill. It was not nearly as 
consequential as this bill will be in em-
powering every person eligible to vote. 
And by the way, every citizen, from my 
perspective, to vote, so there is no 
mischaracterization of my view. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman NAD-
LER, 
Representative 
SEWELL, 
Rep-
resentative 
SARBANES, 
Chairwoman 
BEATTY, and the entire Congressional 
Black Caucus, and literally hundreds of 
Members who through the years have 
fought to protect this sacred right. 
In addition to providing for auto-
matic online and same-day voter reg-
istration, the Freedom to Vote Act will 
make Election Day a Federal holiday— 
a holy day, if you will—in the pursuit 
of our secular commitment to democ-
racy. It will guarantee at least 15 days 
of early voting. 
Isn’t that terrible? Well, it must be 
terrible because many States through-
out the country are cutting those days 
down. Why? I don’t know. If you vote 
on Tuesday as opposed to Thursday, is 
there more fraud involved? I don’t 
know. It will guarantee those days and 
two weekends while ending require-
ments for difficult-to-obtain photo ID. 
It doesn’t eliminate ID. If States have 
ID, it does not eliminate that. 
Importantly, this legislation will re-
store voting rights to those who have 
paid their debts to society. And it will 
ensure that those who cast eligible bal-
lots provisionally in the wrong pre-
cincts will still have their votes count-
ed. 
As the sponsor of the Help America 
Vote Act in 2002, that provision was in 
the Federal law. This bill would limit 
partisan gerrymandering and remove 
the corrosive influence of dark money. 
My mother used to tell me, consider 
the source. If the money is dark and 
you don’t know who is paying the bill 
for the talk that is being given to you, 
you can’t make that judgment. You 
can’t determine who the source is. 
When it comes to defending the integ-
rity of our elections and our democ-
racy, this legislation is absolutely 
needed in America. 
Not only will it prohibit the removal 
of election officials without cause, 
which is happening because a President 
calls up and says, ‘‘Can’t you find some 
more votes?’’ That was the asking of 
some elected official, Secretary of 
State of Georgia, to commit a crime. 
Talk about fraud in elections. 
This will enable the EAC to provide 
State and local boards of election with 
grants to upgrade outdated voting 
equipment and protect against hackers 
and cyber threats. It wasn’t until 2003 
that the Federal Government paid part 
of the election costs incurred in elect-
ing Federal officials, also restoring the 
full force of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, 
which was undermined by Shelby v. 
Holder, applying it to every State—not 
discrimination. 
If you break the law in any State, if 
you preclude people from legitimate 
voting in any State, you are covered 
under this legislation. We don’t pick 
out any actor. Every State is included. 
We apply it to every State. And updat-
ing it for the 21st century, the Freedom 
to Vote Act has the power to restore 
trust that our elections are fair and 
that every eligible voter will be able to 
participate. 
House Democrats have passed voting 
rights measures multiple times, this 
Congress sending both H.R. 1 and H.R. 
4 to the Senate. The majority is for it, 
but the filibuster stops it. The minor-
ity controls the majority. 
b 1015 
Madison said that was not democ-
racy. Now, the Senate must act. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Senators to come 
together on Monday and approve this 
historic voting rights legislation for 
our time. We have the opportunity. 
I share G. K. BUTTERFIELD’s sadness 
that John Lewis is not on this floor to 
cast his vote. Very frankly, I would 
have yielded all the time I have taken 
to John Lewis to talk to us about how 
important this legislation is and how 
many people gave their lives and their 
blood and their time and their talent 
to accomplish an America where no 
person would be shut out of the ballot 
box. 
In future years, I hope Americans 
will be able to celebrate Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day by reflecting not only on 
how our country overcame Jim Crow in 
the 20th century but how we prevented 
its return in 2022. 
I know we have heard, ‘‘Oh, this is 
not Jim Crow.’’ No matter how subtle 
the discrimination may be, it is dis-
crimination.

January 13, 2022 
I ask Members to cast your vote for 
this bill today, so our citizens can cast 
their votes without hindrance and 
share equally in the making of our 
laws and in the shaping of our future. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
In the lengthy oration of the 1 
minute from the majority leader, I 
agreed with one word, that this is a 
radical bill. And the majority leader’s 
argument is a ‘‘throwing the baby out 
with the bathwater’’ argument. 
The States in this country remain a 
bulwark of democracy. The rhetoric 
from Democrats is that democracy 
itself won’t survive without their elec-
tions bill. Well, nothing speaks of pre-
serving our democracy like a late- 
night gut and replace in the Rules 
Committee. A bill about NASA gets 
700-plus pages added and a floor vote 
within 18 hours. 
Nothing speaks of preserving our de-
mocracy like giving Washington con-
trol of voter ID laws when 35 elected 
State legislatures have adopted them 
and 74 percent of the people favor 
them. People in my State voted to put 
it in our State constitution. Most be-
lieve elections should be made more se-
cure. 
Nothing speaks more of preserving 
our democracy than shifting the power 
to set election law from 50 decentral-
ized States, where legislatures con-
trolled by different parties have pre-
dominantly held and exercised that 
power for all 233 years of our experi-
ence under the Constitution, and cen-
tralizing that power in a single agency, 
the Department of Justice, at any time 
controlled by one party. 
Nothing speaks of preserving our de-
mocracy like abandoning historic par-
liamentary norms to accomplish this 
radical transformation with bare ma-
jorities in both Houses of Congress 
without one vote from the minority 
party. 
Democrats 
may 
continue 
gerry-
mandering in Illinois and Maryland 
with abandon, but they assure you that 
if you just put all control of elections 
into their hands in Washington, they 
will save democracy for you. It calls to 
mind the iconic Vietnam-era phrase: 
‘‘We had to burn the village to save it.’’ 
America, that is Democrats’ message 
to you. They will burn your democracy 
to the ground in order to save it. And 
they can’t let anything stop them from 
getting it done before they face your 
verdict this November. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask my friend from North Caro-
lina to refer to the bill section that re-
fers to voter ID. It simply says this bill 
sets uniform national standards for 
States that choose to require identi-
fication to vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, today our Nation faces 
the most dangerous assault on the vote 
since Jim Crow. Last year alone, more 
than 440 draconian voter restrictions 
have been introduced across 49 States, 
with at least 19 States enacting 34 
measures into law. This legislation 
seeks not only to suppress access to 
the ballot but empowers States to nul-
lify election results entirely. That is 
the legislation that I referenced across 
the country. 
This sinister campaign has particu-
larly targeted communities of color. As 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion proved in last summer’s report, 
partisan forces are accelerating a sin-
ister campaign to silence the voices of 
color in particular. 
There are four things, just four 
things, I want people to know about 
the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act, four things to remember, and one 
observation, the four reasons why 
every Member should vote for this bill 
today. 
First, it ends shameful voter suppres-
sion and election subversion, which 
lets local officials simply choose win-
ners and losers based on their own po-
litical interests. Nullification of elec-
tions, vote ‘‘no’’ on that. 
Secondly, it ends partisan gerry-
mandering so that the redistricting 
process will meet the standards of the 
Constitution, of the Voting Rights Act, 
and keep communities of interests to-
gether. 
One, stopping voter suppression and 
election nullification; two, ending par-
tisan gerrymandering. 
Third, it stops big, dark, special in-
terest money, which is suffocating the 
airwaves 
with 
misrepresentations, 
which does suppress the voices of the 
American people. Get rid of big, dark 
money. People can still give their big, 
dark, special interest money, but they 
have to disclose it so that the public 
knows. 
Fourth, this legislation empowers 
the grassroots by rewarding their par-
ticipation in our democracy and ampli-
fying a voice and, yes, the power of 
matching their small-dollar contribu-
tions. 
Hear this: There are no taxpayer dol-
lars involved in that, no matter what 
you might hear them misrepresent. No 
taxpayer dollars. 
Four things: end voter suppression 
and election nullification; end political 
gerrymandering; end big, dark, special 
interest money crushing the political 
system; and reward the grassroots. 
That is in the Freedom to Vote Act. 
In the John R. Lewis Act, which is 
part of what we are voting on today, I 
just want to be clear: The Voting 
Rights Act has been strongly bipar-
tisan. Indeed, Republican Presidents 
Nixon, Ford, Reagan, George Herbert 
Walker Bush, and George W. Bush, who 
signed the most recent Voting Rights 
Act, which received like 390 votes in 
the House, unanimous in the Senate— 
it was signed by George W. Bush. It was 
bipartisan. 
Four times the Congress has reau-
thorized the Voting Rights Act in a bi-
partisan way. This is the first time we 
have the assault that we have on that. 
I am very, very proud of the House of 
Representatives, Mr. Speaker, because 
we have twice passed the For the Peo-
ple Act, which is to protect our vote, 
and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. Even before he 
passed and had this named in his 
honor, we passed it once. 
The House has made it clear: We 
stand with the people in the fight for 
voting rights. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to 
commend Mr. BUTTERFIELD
for his 
leadership on all of this, going around 
the country; JOHN SARBANES, the au-
thor of the For the People Act; TERRI 
SEWELL, the author of the Voting 
Rights Act; ZOE LOFGREN, the chair of 
the House Administration Committee; 
and Mr. NADLER, the chair of the Judi-
ciary Committee. I also want to ac-
knowledge the work of JIM MCGOVERN, 
the chair of the Rules Committee, who 
has brought these bills to the floor 
time and time again. 
This is a day when Democrats will 
once again take a strong step to defend 
our democracy as we send the Freedom 
to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to the Sen-
ate for urgent consideration. Nothing 
less is at stake than our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong, bipar-
tisan ‘‘aye’’ vote on this legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD). 
Mr. 
FITZGERALD. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today I rise in objection to H.R. 5746, 
which is the latest attempt by my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
ignore the 10th Amendment and dump 
on the State legislatures of this Na-
tion, basically telling them, ‘‘You are 
incompetent,’’ not to mention the 
clerks. 
Democrats 
first 
tried 
to 
barge 
through the front door of election ad-
ministration with H.R. 1. After that 
failed, they tried an overhaul on the 
backdoor functions. And this bill rep-
resents a full-blown takeover. 
The supposedly slimmed-down bill 
would still override State laws by cre-
ating a Federal right to no-excuse 
mail-in voting and requires States to 
accept late-arriving ballots as long as 
they have timely postmarks. It is kind 
of a joke. 
It would automatically give felons 
the right to vote. Great. 
It would also override State voter ID 
requirements. Only a few months ago, 
Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle argued that 
voter ID laws suppressed voter turnout, 
only to flip-flop once they saw that the 
public overwhelmingly supports proof 
of identity before casting a ballot—80 
percent in some States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H165 
January 13, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have im-
plemented strong voter ID laws during 
my time in the Wisconsin legislature. 
Unfortunately, leading up to the 2020 
election, 
I 
saw 
these 
protections 
steamrolled under the guise of the pan-
demic. 
Let’s talk about the Supreme Court. 
In 2013, a decision recognized that we 
are no longer living in the Jim Crow 
era. The original Voting Rights Act 
worked, and extreme policies like 
preclearance are no longer required. 
Allegations that election integrity 
measures that have been adopted by 
States, such as Texas and Georgia, 
amount to anything close to Jim Crow- 
era restrictions is a slap in the face to 
those who endured real discrimination. 
There is no voting rights crisis. This 
is not about ensuring access to the 
polls. This is about taking power from 
the State legislatures and concen-
trating our election systems in the 
hands of Federal bureaucrats. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the Democratic whip, who 
has led the way in this House and the 
South for generations. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from North Carolina for 
yielding me this time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of 
this legislation carrying the Freedom 
to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act to the 
Senate for immediate consideration to 
safeguard our most fundamental con-
stitutional right, the right to vote. 
We took an oath to protect this coun-
try from all threats, foreign and do-
mestic. Today, we face a domestic 
threat from those seeking to gain and 
hold power by suppressing votes and 
nullifying election results. Congress 
must combat this threat by ensuring 
equal and unencumbered access to the 
ballot box and ensuring an accurate 
vote count. 
It is time to choose. Will we uphold 
our oath and protect this fragile de-
mocracy, or will we subvert the Con-
stitution and fetter the franchise? 
I want to remind the previous speak-
er that we did not have Jim Crow be-
fore there was Jim Crow, and we had it 
until 1954. I used to teach this stuff 
called history, and I will say to my col-
leagues: Anything that has happened 
before can happen again. 
It was the lack of the vote that had 
95 years between George Washington 
Murray, who was the last African 
American to represent South Carolina 
here in this body, until I came along in 
1992—95 years. 
Why? 
Because the right to vote was taken 
away and election results were nul-
lified. We are not going back. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I re-
serve the balance of my time, Mr. 
Speaker. 
b 1030 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN), who is a member of the cov-
eted House Committee on House Ad-
ministration. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, our col-
leagues object to guaranteeing the peo-
ples’ right to vote through the vehicle 
of a NASA bill of all things. A quarter 
of a century ago Republicans changed 
Texas State law to permit astronauts 
to vote absentee from space. They want 
to make it easier to vote from space, 
and they want to make it harder to 
vote on Earth. 
In the last election, tens of thou-
sands of citizens in Texas waited in 
line for 6 hours to vote and an astro-
naut on the International Space Sta-
tion could have orbited planet Earth 
four times in the 6 hours that Texas 
forced some of its citizens to wait in 
line to vote. 
Across the country it is voter sup-
pression, GOP gerrymandering of our 
districts, rightwing Supreme Court 
packing and judicial activism to de-
stroy the voting rights in cases like 
Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich 
and deployment of the filibuster to 
block voting rights legislation—the 
whole matrix of GOP democracy sup-
pression today. 
It is time to protect the right to vote 
here on Earth. If it takes a NASA bill 
to do it, then I invite my GOP col-
leagues to boldly go where none of 
them have ever gone before—to planet 
Earth on a mission to defend the vot-
ing rights of the people. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
LOUDERMILK). 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today obviously in strong opposi-
tion to this latest attempt by my col-
leagues on the other side to enact a 
Federal takeover of elections and con-
tinue their tactics that they have used 
consistently in this Congress and the 
last Congress to hide the intent of 
what they are doing. 
Make no mistake, this legislation is 
an attempt to circumvent State legis-
latures’ constitutional authority to set 
election laws, laws like the one re-
cently passed in Georgia that maxi-
mizes—maximizes—voter 
access 
and 
protects the integrity of every legal 
ballot. 
One-size-fits-all 
government 
has 
never worked in a diverse and free soci-
ety like we have here in the United 
States of America. One size fits all is 
synonymous with dictatorial regimes, 
Socialist societies, and Communist 
countries—governments that keep con-
trol over the people by stripping the 
authority from the hands of local offi-
cials that were elected by the people to 
represent them. 
This is what this bill does. To be 
clear, the goal of strong central gov-
ernments and strong federal govern-
ments is to have a homogeneous soci-
ety that is easily controlled. Our soci-
ety is diverse: diversity of thought, di-
versity of action, and diversity of 
speech. But the actions of my col-
leagues on the other side is to have a 
homogeneous society to where right 
and wrong is no longer determined by 
personal conviction or faith but what 
the Federal Government has deter-
mined is right and wrong. 
You don’t have to look any further, 
Mr. Speaker, of how the right to deter-
mine your own healthcare has been 
stripped away by my colleagues on the 
other side where people can no longer 
determine what they will and will not 
put into their body. 
The Constitution protects the ideas 
of individual liberty and federalism to 
where government is strongest at the 
local level. This bill disregards State 
voter IDs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
Georgia an additional 15 seconds. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. One thing I want 
to bring up that is homogeneous when 
it comes to campaign elections, Mr. 
Speaker, we live in an independent, di-
verse society where local governments 
are the greatest authority over the 
people. This is a takeover by the Fed-
eral Government to create a homo-
geneous society where everyone acts, 
thinks, and works according to the 
Federal Government. 
Oppose this legislation. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR), who is the 
distinguished vice-chair of the Demo-
cratic Caucus and, I might say, a mem-
ber of the Elections Subcommittee of 
which I have the honor to chair. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, 
legislation that would protect the right 
to vote and strengthen our democracy. 
This week we heard President Biden, 
traveling to the home of our late col-
league, John Lewis, rally the Nation 
around the need to protect and expand 
the right to vote. 
Today, we will pass this legislation 
in honor of John’s name. But in order 
to honor our colleague, we must make 
good on our commitment. We must 
pass this legislation in both Chambers 
without delay. We must also make 
clear, as President Biden did this week, 
that there is nothing more important— 
no rules or procedures—than the health 
of our democracy. There is far too 
much at stake to let tradition get in 
the way of real progress. 
I know from my work on the com-
mittee and the Select Committee to In-
vestigate the January 6th Attack on 
the U.S. Capitol that the concerns 
about the future of the American sys-
tem—the consent of the governed—are 
well-founded. 
Mr. Speaker, every Member of this 
body has a choice today, and the world 
will remember where we stood. I am 
proud to stand on the side of democ-
racy, on the side of making it easier to

vote—not more difficult—and on the 
side of the people because the Amer-
ican people are with us. This is not a 
Democrat or Republican issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill and pass this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Selma, Alabama (Ms. SEWELL), 
who is my dear friend and a sponsor of 
the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, as you 
know, voting rights are personal to me. 
It was in my hometown in 1965 on a 
bridge in Selma, Alabama, where John 
Lewis and the foot soldiers shed blood 
for the equal right of all Americans to 
vote. Fifty-six years later old battles 
have become new again as State legis-
latures erect direct barriers to the bal-
lot box—400 bills introduced and 34 
passed in 19 States. 
Once again, our Nation is at an in-
flection point. Today, the House of 
Representatives will, once again, send 
voting rights over to the Senate, and it 
must pass, Mr. Speaker. 
I implore our Senators: Do what is 
right. You have changed your rules 150 
times, most recently to raise the debt 
ceiling. If you can protect the full faith 
and credit of the United States, then 
surely you can protect the democracy. 
The time is now. What we need is 
courage. 
As we prepare to observe the birth-
day of Dr. Martin Luther King, let us 
remember that justice delayed can be 
justice denied. 
Senators, we need your leadership. 
We need it now. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate that reminder. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from the State of Arizona 
(Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, Repub-
licans are trying to protect everyone’s 
right to vote and the integrity of the 
election. 
It boggles my mind that in some cit-
ies in the United States noncitizens are 
allowed to vote and here in Wash-
ington, D.C., and other cities when we 
go to a restaurant, we need to show our 
vaccination database passport saying 
that we are fully vaccinated before we 
are allowed to enter, but yet my Demo-
crat colleagues don’t seem to want 
voter ID. 
In the State of Arizona, we have a 
law in place that requires a voter ID to 
vote. We also have a law in place that 
was held up by the courts that pro-
hibits ballot harvesting. Yet it con-
tinues to boggle my mind that our 
Democrat colleagues want to undo 
what the States have done and undo 
States’ rights. 
I am opposed to this bill. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I want to remind my friend from 
Arizona who just spoke that this bill 
sets uniform national standards for 
States that choose to require identi-
fication to vote. The bill gives States 
the flexibility—flexibility—to choose 
whether to require voter IDs. It is not 
a mandatory voter ID law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JONES), who is a thoughtful leader on 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, my col-
leagues across the aisle have asked 
why we are voting today to protect our 
democracy. 
The answer is as clear to me as it is 
unimaginable to them: for the people. 
This one is for the people who made 
today possible, for the young people 
who cast their first votes in 2020 and 
for the seniors who cast their first 
votes in 1966 after the passage of the 
original Voting Rights Act. 
It is for the people who, like John 
Lewis, put their lives on the line on 
Bloody Sunday and for the people who 
risked their lives to overcome racist 
voter suppression at the height of this 
pandemic. 
It is for people like my mentor and 
professor, the late Lani Guinier, moth-
er of the 1982 amendments to the Vot-
ing Rights Act. 
It is for the people who don’t have a 
vote but who do have a voice. 
Voting rights are preservative of all 
other rights. But time is running out. 
We can still have a democracy, Madam 
Speaker, but only if we pass this legis-
lation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I re-
serve the balance of my time, Madam 
Speaker. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), who 
is my friend and chair of the Appro-
priations Committee who stays in per-
petual motion. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, en-
suring all Americans can freely partici-
pate in the electoral process is a bed-
rock of our democratic society. Today 
in this country we are witnessing an 
attack on that sacred right to vote, re-
stricting voting access. We must act to 
restore Federal oversight. What we do 
will determine the course of our de-
mocracy for generations to come. 
Our late colleague, John Lewis, shed 
blood for the right of all Americans to 
vote. Let us honor the legacy of those 
who fought to protect voting rights 
and pass this critical legislation. 
President Biden made our choice 
today clear: 
‘‘Will we choose democracy over au-
tocracy, light over shadows, justice 
over injustice?’’ 
Like the President, I know where I 
stand. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting for the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, may I inquire about how much time 
each side has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
CLARK
of Massachusetts). The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 61⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from Illinois has 21⁄4 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), my 
friend who is another Member who 
stays in perpetual motion and who is a 
senior member on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am grateful for the distinguished 
leader of this debate, Mr. BUTTERFIELD, 
and his service to this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, this is a somber, sa-
cred moment in our lives on this floor. 
I stand here in the name of the blood 
shed by those foot soldiers, Dr. Martin 
Luther King and John Robert Lewis, 
who shed his blood on the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge. 
My friends who vote ‘‘no’’ today will 
disregard and ignore that bloodshed. I 
refuse to ignore the blood that was 
shed for the right to vote. 
As a member of the House Judiciary 
Committee, this committee built over 
the course of 13 hearings in two Con-
gresses led by JERRY
NADLER
and 
STEVE COHEN the record for the John 
Robert Lewis bill, and for that I am 
grateful, for I stand as a victim of the 
lack of preclearance. 
The bills that we have will eliminate 
a legislature, as a Texas bill states, to 
overturn duly voters’ choice. It will 
prevent the purging of voters which 
happens all the time. It will protect 
you at the polls, Madam Speaker, and 
it will disallow people from interfering 
with your vote. It is now a sacred 
honor and charge. We must vote now in 
the name of Martin King and John 
Robert Lewis. We cannot do any less. 
The Senate must do its job. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, and the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am pleased to co-an-
chor this Congressional Black Caucus Special 
Order with my colleague, the distinguished 
gentleman from New York, Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES. 
I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congress-
woman BEATTY of Ohio, for organizing this 
Special Order to discuss the reasons why the 
CBC strong supports H.R. 4, the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, which for 
nearly 50 years protected the most precious of 
all rights of a citizen in a democracy—the right 
to vote—until it was seriously undermined by 
the right-wing conservative majority of the 
United States Supreme Court, starting with the 
outrageously wrong decision in Shelby County 
v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), and exacer-
bated by Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S. ll, No. 
19–1257 and 19–1258 (July 1, 2021). 
Over the next hour, several of our col-
leagues will share their perspectives on why it 
is essential that it is urgent and essential to 
correct these miscarriages of justice by pass-
ing H.R. 4, H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H167 
January 13, 2022 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary Committee and an original cospon-
sor, let me say plainly at the outset that H.R. 
4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act, corrects the damage done in recent years 
to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and commits 
the national government to protecting the right 
of all Americans to vote free from discrimina-
tion and without injustices that previously pre-
vented them from exercising this most funda-
mental right of citizenship. 
I thank my CBC colleague, Congresswoman 
TERRI SEWELL of Alabama for introducing this 
legislation, to Speaker PELOSI, Chairman NAD-
LER, and the Democratic leadership, and to 
the many colleagues and countless number of 
ordinary Americans who never stopped agi-
tating and working to protect the precious right 
to vote. 
Madam Speaker, in response to the Su-
preme Court’s invitation in Shelby County v. 
Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), H.R. 4 provides 
a new coverage formula based on ‘‘current 
conditions’’ and creates a new coverage for-
mula that hinges on a finding of repeated vot-
ing rights violations in the preceding 25 years. 
It is significant that this 25-year period is 
measured on a rolling basis to keep up with 
‘‘current conditions,’’ so only states and polit-
ical subdivisions that have a recent record of 
racial discrimination in voting are covered. 
States and political subdivisions that qualify 
for preclearance will be covered for a period of 
10 years, but if they have a clean record dur-
ing that time period, they can be extracted 
from coverage. 
H.R. 4 also establishes ‘‘practice-based 
preclearance,’’ which would focus administra-
tive or judicial review narrowly on suspect 
practices that are most likely to be tainted by 
discriminatory intent or to have discriminatory 
effects, as demonstrated by a broad historical 
record. 
Under the bill, this process of reviewing 
changes in voting is limited to a set of specific 
practices, including such things as: 
1. Changes to the methods of elections (to 
or from at-large elections) in areas that are ra-
cially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse. 
2. Redistricting in areas that are racially, 
ethnically, or linguistically diverse. 
3. Reducing, consolidating, or relocating 
polling in areas that are racially, ethnically, or 
linguistically diverse; and 
4. Changes in documentation or require-
ments to vote or to register. 
It is useful, Madam Speaker, to recount how 
we arrived at this day. 
Madam Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in 
Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls 
risked their lives for freedom and to secure the 
right to vote for all Americans by their partici-
pation in marches for voting rights on ‘‘Bloody 
Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround Tuesday,’’ or the final, 
completed march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote. 
On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including 
our beloved colleague, Congressman John 
Lewis of Georgia for whom this important leg-
islation is named, were brutally attacked by 
state and local police at the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge as they marched from Selma to Mont-
gomery in support of the right to vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American. 
No one who witnessed the violence and 
brutally suffered by the foot soldiers for justice 
who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
will ever forget it; the images are deeply 
seared in the American memory and experi-
ence. 
On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the 
Capitol President Johnson addressed the na-
tion before signing the Voting Rights Act: 
‘‘The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which im-
prison men because they are different from 
other men.’’ 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to 
preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-
tions that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised. 
In 1940, for example, there were less than 
30,000 African Americans registered to vote in 
Texas and only about 3 percent of African 
Americans living in the South were registered 
to vote. 
Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of vio-
lence were the major causes of these racially 
discriminatory results. 
After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 
1965, which prohibited these discriminatory 
practices, registration and electoral participa-
tion steadily increased to the point that by 
2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans 
living in Texas were registered to vote. 
In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights 
Act became law, there were approximately 
300 African-Americans in public office, includ-
ing just three in Congress. 
Few, if any, African Americans held elective 
office anywhere in the South. 
Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 
there were more than 9,100 black elected offi-
cials, including 46 members of Congress, the 
largest number ever. 
Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act 
opened the political process for many of the 
approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials 
that have been elected and appointed nation-
wide, including more than 275 at the state or 
federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress. 
Native Americans, Asians, and others who 
have historically encountered harsh barriers to 
full political participation also have benefited 
greatly. 
The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 is Section 5, which requires that states 
and localities with a chronic record of discrimi-
nation in voting practices secure federal ap-
proval before making any changes to voting 
processes. 
The preclearance requirement of Section 5 
protects minority voting rights where voter dis-
crimination has historically been the worst. 
Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped 
more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes 
in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory 
changes right here in Texas. 
Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary lead-
ership of President Lyndon Johnson, the 
greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dra-
matic change in many states across the 
South. 
But in 1972, change was not coming fast 
enough or in many places in Texas. 
In fact, Texas, which had never elected a 
woman to Congress or an African American to 
the Texas State Senate, was not covered by 
Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and 
the language minorities living in South Texas 
were not protected at all. 
But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
Barbara Jordan was elected to Congress, giv-
ing meaning to the promise of the Voting 
Rights Act that all citizens would at long last 
have the right to cast a vote for person of their 
community, from their community, for their 
community. 
Madam Speaker, it is a source of eternal 
pride to all of us in Houston that in pursuit of 
extending the full measure of citizenship to all 
Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara 
Jordan, who also represented this historic 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, introduced, 
and the Congress adopted, what are now Sec-
tions 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights 
Act, which extended the protections of Section 
4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities. 
We must remain ever vigilant and oppose 
all schemes that will abridge or dilute the pre-
cious right to vote. 
Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind 
the nation that need to pass this legislation is 
urgent because the right to vote—that ‘‘power-
ful instrument that can break down the walls of 
injustice’’—faces grave threats. 
The threat stems from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. 
Not to be content with the monument to dis-
grace that is the Shelby County decision, the 
activist right-wing conservative majority on the 
Roberts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil 
twin, the decision in Brnovich v. DNC, 594 
U.S.ll, No. 19–1257 and 19–1258 (July 1, 
2021), which engrafts on Section 2 of the Vot-
ing Rights onerous burdens that Congress 
never intended and explicitly legislated against 
Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th 
Amendment, I venture to say that this con-
servative majority on the Court would subject 
poll taxes and literacy tests to the review 
standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC. 
According to the Supreme Court majority, 
the reason for striking down Section 4(b) of 
the Voting Rights Act was that ‘‘times 
change.’’ 
Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. 
But what the Court did not fully appreciate 
is that the positive changes it cited are due al-
most entirely to the existence and vigorous 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. 
And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still 
needed and that is why we must pass H.R. 4, 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. 
Let me put it this way: in the same way that 
the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 
1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did 
not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting 
Rights Act succeeded in stymieing the prac-
tices that resulted in the wholesale disenfran-
chisement of African Americans and language 
minorities but did eliminate them entirely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H168 
January 13, 2022 
The Voting Rights Act is needed as much 
today to prevent another epidemic of voting 
disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk’s vaccine is 
still needed to prevent another polio epidemic. 
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘[t]hrowing out 
preclearance when it has worked and is con-
tinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes 
is like throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting wet.’’ 
Madam Speaker, in many ways my home 
state of Texas is ground-zero for testing and 
perfecting schemes to deprive communities of 
color and language minorities of the right to 
vote and to have their votes counted. 
Consider what has transpired in Texas in re-
cent past, let alone the noxious voter suppres-
sion bill, SB7, it is currently trying to ramrod 
through the legislature. 
Only 68 percent of eligible voters are reg-
istered in Texas and state restrictions on third 
party registration, such as the Volunteer Dep-
uty Registrar program, exacerbate the sys-
temic disenfranchisement of minority commu-
nities. 
These types of programs are often aimed at 
minority and underserved communities that, 
for many, many other reasons (like demoniza-
tion by the president, for example) or mistrust 
of law enforcement are afraid to live as openly 
as they should. 
In Harris County, we had a system where 
voters were getting purged from the rolls, ef-
fectively requiring people to keep active their 
registrations and hundreds of polling locations 
closed in Texas, significantly more in number 
and percentage than any other state. 
In addition, the Texas Election Code only 
requires a 72-hour notice of polling location 
changes. 
Next, take what happened here in Texas in 
2019 when the Texas Secretary of State 
claimed that his office had identified 95,000 
possible noncitizens on the voter rolls and 
gave the list to the Texas State Attorney Gen-
eral for possible prosecution—leading to a 
claim from President Trump about widespread 
voter fraud and outrage from Democrats and 
activist groups. 
The only problem was that list was not ac-
curate. 
At least 20,000 names turned out to be 
there by mistake, leading to chaos, confusion, 
and concern that people’s eligibility vote was 
being questioned based on flawed data. 
The list was made through state records 
going back to 1996 that show which Texas 
residents were not citizens when they got a 
driver’s license or other state ID. 
But many of the person who may have had 
green cards or work visas at the time they got 
a Texas ID are on the secretary of state’s of-
fice’s list, and many have become citizens 
since then since nearly 50,000 people become 
naturalized U.S. citizens in Texas annually. 
Latinos made up a big portion of the 
95,000-person list. 
Texas Republicans adopted racial and par-
tisan gerrymandered congressional, State leg-
islative redistricting plans that federal courts 
have ruled violate the Voting Rights Act and 
were drawn with discriminatory intent. 
Even after changes were demanded by the 
courts, much of the damage done was already 
done. 
Reversing the position by the Obama ad-
ministration, 
the 
Trump 
Department 
of 
[in]Justice represented to a federal court that 
it no longer believed past discrimination by 
Texas officials should require the state to get 
outside approval for redistricting maps that will 
be drawn in 2021. 
In addition to affirmative ways to making it 
harder to vote, we also now face other odious 
impediments in Texas. 
Those of us who cherish the right to vote 
justifiably are skeptical of Voter ID laws be-
cause we understand how these laws, like poll 
taxes and literacy tests, can be used to im-
pede or negate the ability of seniors, racial 
and language minorities, and young people to 
cast their votes. 
This is the harm that can be done without 
preclearance, so on a federal level, there is an 
impetus to act. 
Those of us who cherish the right to vote 
justifiably are skeptical of Voter ID laws be-
cause we understand how these laws, like poll 
taxes and literacy tests, can be used to im-
pede or negate the ability of seniors, racial 
and language minorities, and young people to 
cast their votes. 
Consider the demographic groups who lack 
a government issued ID: 
1. African Americans: 25 percent 
2. Asian Americans: 20% percent 
3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent 
4. Young people, aged 18–24: 18 percent 
5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 
15 percent 
And there are other ways abridging or sup-
pressing the right to vote, including: 
1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting; 
2. Ending same-day registration; 
3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in 
the wrong precinct on Election Day will not 
count; 
4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration; 
5. Shortening poll hours; and 
6. Lessening the standards governing voter 
challenges thus allowing self-proclaimed ‘‘bal-
lot security vigilantes’’ like the King Street Pa-
triots to cause trouble at the polls. 
The malevolent practice of voter purging is 
not limited to Texas; we saw it in 2018 in 
Georgia, where then Secretary of State and 
now Governor Brian Kemp purged more than 
53,000 persons from the voter, nearly the 
exact margin of his narrow win over his oppo-
nent, Stacy Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial 
election. 
Voter purging is a sinister and malevolent 
practice visited on voters, who are dispropor-
tionately members of communities of color, by 
state and local election officials. 
This practice, which would have not passed 
muster under section 5 of the Voting Rights 
Act, has proliferated in the years since the Su-
preme Court neutralized the preclearance pro-
vision, or as Justice Ginsburg observed in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘threw out the um-
brella’’ of protection. 
Madam Speaker, citizens in my congres-
sional district and elsewhere know and have 
experienced the pain and heartbreak of receiv-
ing a letter from state or local election officials 
that they have been removed from the election 
rolls, or worse, learn this fact on Election Day. 
That is why I am very pleased that H.R. 4 
includes language that I worked hard to in-
clude in the Manager’s Amendment to the Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act of 2019 that 
strengthens 
the 
bill’s 
‘‘practice-based 
preclearance’’ provisions by adding specifically 
to the preclearance provision, voting practices 
that add a new basis or process for removing 
a name from the list of active registered voters 
and the practice of reducing the days or hours 
of in-person voting on Sundays during an 
early voting period. 
For millions of Americans, the right to vote 
protected by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is 
sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil 
and tears and blood of ordinary Americans 
who showed the world it was possible to ac-
complish extraordinary things. 
Madam Speaker, it is the responsibility and 
sacred duty of all members of Congress who 
revere democracy to preserve, protect, and 
expand the precious right to vote of all Ameri-
cans by passing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. 
Madam Speaker, free and fair elections, 
along with open, ethical, and honest govern-
ment, provide the foundation of our democ-
racy. But these principles have been threat-
ened in recent years by an unyielding strategy 
of voter suppression and outright attacks on 
historical statutes which were designed to pro-
tect voting rights. 
On Tuesday, the President traveled to At-
lanta to make the case for the legislation that 
we bring to the floor today. My Judiciary Com-
mittee colleagues and I have labored for the 
last two congresses, holding more than a 
dozen hearings to build a record to dem-
onstrate the critical need for a revitalized Vot-
ing Rights Act after the erosion of the Shelby 
County and Brnovich decisions. 
We must continue to confront the anti- 
democratic intent of those behind these dis-
criminatory schemes—attempting to stop any 
practice proven to bring more people to the 
polls—to cling to power in an increasing multi-
cultural America. Make no mistake, we vote at 
a critical juncture in our Nation’s history. 
I urge all Members to join me in honoring 
the legacy of our beloved colleague, the late 
John Lewis—who shed his blood to secure 
passage of the Voting Rights Act—by sup-
porting this vital legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the 
House Amendment to the Senate Amendment 
to H.R. 5746—the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act. This measure would, among other 
things, revitalize and strengthen the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 to confront the onslaught of 
discriminatory voting laws and practices that 
has emerged in recent years across the coun-
try. 
Significant portions of this measure—in par-
ticular, the bulk of Division D—rests on a sub-
stantial record that the House Judiciary Com-
mittee built over the course of 13 hearings in 
two Congresses, led by Judiciary Committee 
Chairman JERROLD NADLER and Constitution 
Subcommittee Chairman STEVE COHEN. This 
record documents the myriad ways that the 
right to vote—the most fundamental right in a 
democracy—remains under threat for too 
many Americans. 
I also applaud Congresswoman TERRI SE-
WELL for introducing H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act, which was ul-
timately incorporated into this measure. I urge 
all Members to join me in honoring the legacy 
of our beloved colleague, the late John 
Lewis—who shed his blood to secure passage 
of the Voting Rights Act—by supporting this 
vital legislation. 
Make no mistake, we are at a critical junc-
ture in our Nation’s history. The House faces 
a stark choice with this vote—protect democ-
racy or let it die.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H169 
January 13, 2022 
Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary 
Subcommittee on Crime, Homeland Security, 
and Terrorism, and a senior member of the 
Homeland Security, and Budget Committees, I 
rise in strong support of the rule governing de-
bate for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, 
the ‘‘Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.’’ 
We are here tonight because we must act. 
On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the 
Capitol President Johnson addressed the Na-
tion before signing the Voting Rights Act— 
considered the most effective civil rights stat-
ute ever enacted by Congress: 
‘‘The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which im-
prison men because they are different from 
other men.’’ 
This bill is the result of tireless work and 
compromise by my colleagues in the House 
and my colleagues in the Senate. 
The signing of the Voting Rights Act came 
after, in that same year, in Selma, Alabama, 
hundreds of heroic souls risked their lives for 
freedom and to secure the right to vote for all 
Americans by their participation in marches for 
voting rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turn-
around Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed 
march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, 
persons of all races and creeds, loved their 
country so much that they were willing to risk 
their lives to make it better, to bring it even 
closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the 
right to equal treatment under the law, and in 
the making of the laws, which is the funda-
mental essence of the right to vote. 
On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including 
our beloved former colleague, the late Con-
gressman John Lewis of Georgia, were bru-
tally attacked by state and local police at the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from 
Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to 
vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the 
nation the necessity of enacting a strong and 
effective federal law to protect the right to vote 
of every American. 
However, since the enactment of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, the right to vote has been 
under constant assault. 
The Voting Rights Act was enacted at a 
time when many African Americans in south-
ern states had been denied the right to vote, 
and when attempting to register, organize or 
even assist others in their attempt to register 
to vote meant risking their jobs, homes, and 
racial violence. 
Prior to the enactment of the VRA, litigation 
initiated under the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 
and 1960 failed to eliminate discrimination in 
voting because jurisdictions simply shifted to 
different tactics in order to disenfranchise Afri-
can Americans. 
Nearly fifty-seven years later, we face an-
other turning point in the life of the Nation and 
for the dignity of men and women and the 
destiny of democracy. 
Although the Supreme Court has described 
the right to vote as the one right that is pre-
servative of all others, this ‘‘powerful instru-
ment that canbreak down the walls of injus-
tice’’—faces grave threats. 
The threat stems from the decision issued in 
June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby 
County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which 
invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-
lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 
preclearance requirements. 
According to the Supreme Court majority, 
the reason for striking down Section 4(b) was 
that ‘‘times change.’’ 
Now, the Court was right; times have 
changed. 
But what the Court did not fully appreciate 
is that the positive changes it cited are due al-
most entirely to the existence and vigorous 
enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, and that 
is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed. 
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in 
Shelby County v. Holder, ‘‘[t]hrowing out 
preclearance when it has worked and is con-
tinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes 
is like throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting wet.’’ 
The current Supreme Court majority has 
simply never understood, or refuses to accept, 
the fundamental importance of the right to 
vote, free of discriminatory hurdles and obsta-
cles. 
In fact, were it not for the 24th Amendment, 
I venture to say that this conservative majority 
on the Court would subject poll taxes and lit-
eracy tests to the review standard enunciated 
in Brnovich v. DNC. 
Protecting voting rights and combating voter 
suppression schemes are two of the critical 
challenges facing our great democracy. 
Without safeguards to ensure that all citi-
zens have equal access to the polls, more in-
justices are likely to occur and the voices of 
millions silenced. 
And this is exactly what we have seen over 
this past year. 
The polarization of Americans is ever in-
creasing, as seen during the 2020 election 
through tactics meant to impede the right of 
certain Americans to vote, such as the re-
moval of mailboxes and the closing of postal 
stations in order to impede mail-in voting. 
After the former president was soundly de-
feated at the ballot box in what experts unani-
mously proclaim was the most secure election 
in history, still the former president and his 
cronies propagated the Big Lie that the elec-
tion was illegitimate because it was rife with 
fraud. 
The former president persisted in this spe-
cious claim even though, despite ample oppor-
tunities to do so, they produced not a scintilla 
of evidence to persuade any of the 61 state 
and federal courts that entertained the claims. 
But to this has been added reactionary state 
laws passed or introduced to suppress, 
abridge, restrict, or deny the right to vote of 
millions of eligible Americans, particularly per-
sons of color, young persons and persons with 
disabilities, and working parents, precisely the 
constellation of persons whose votes deter-
mined the outcome of the 2020 presidential 
election. 
In the aftermath of the 2020 election, ac-
cording to the Brennan Center For Justice, be-
tween January 1 and July 14, 2021, at least 
18 states enacted 30 laws that restrict access 
to the vote, some making mail voting and 
early voting more difficult, others imposing 
harsher voter ID requirements, and making 
faulty voter purges more likely. 
In total, more than 400 bills with provisions 
that restrict voting access have been intro-
duced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative ses-
sions. 
My home state of Texas is ground zero for 
this desperate effort to hold back an American 
future led by the ascendant coalition of young, 
racially diverse and all other tolerant, imagina-
tive, and innovative voters who became ener-
gized and inspired by Barack Obama in 2008 
and the belief in a new and just America. 
To combat not their ideas but instead their 
increasing numbers, the Republican legislature 
and Governor of Texas passed and signed 
into law SB1, which: bans drive-thru voting, 
24–hour voting, and the distribution of mail-in 
ballot applications; imposes new and extra-
neous ID requirements for voting by mail; au-
thorizing ‘‘free movement’’ to partisan poll 
watchers, effectively turning them into vote 
suppression 
vigilantes; 
requires 
monthly 
checks of voting rolls to facilitate purging un-
wanted voters; and imposes onerous new 
rules for voter assistance. 
All of this is more than enough to sound the 
warning bell that we are now engaged, as 
President Lincoln observed at Gettysburg, in a 
great contest testing the proposition that this 
Nation, or any nation conceived in liberty and 
dedicated to the proposition that all men and 
women are created equal, can long endure. 
This is the present crisis in which we find 
ourselves and it indeed is soul trying. 
But as Thomas Paine wrote on Christmas 
Eve in 1776: 
‘‘The summer soldier and the sunshine pa-
triot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service 
of their country; but he that stands by it now, 
deserves the love and thanks of man and 
woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily con-
quered; yet we have this consolation with us, 
that the harder the conflict, the more glorious 
the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we 
esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that 
gives everything its value.’’ 
The work for civil rights and voting rights in-
volved tens of thousands of individuals who 
fought to correct the course of the Nation by 
setting it on a path of equal rights and justice 
for all. 
The efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King, Ralph 
Abernathy, Andrew Young, Hosea Williams, 
Coretta Scott King, and John Robert Lewis, 
among others, as well as the thousands of 
foot soldiers in the civil rights movement suc-
ceeded in waking the Nation to the idea that 
change was needed. 
The result of their work was the establish-
ment of protections that allowed voters of 
every race, creed, color, and political belief to 
cast ballots free of interference or threat. 
The blood spilled during these difficult times 
is not forgotten by the communities that saw 
and experienced these battles, which is why 
laws like Texas SB1 cannot go unanswered 
by the United States House of Representa-
tives and Senate. 
To meet the challenge we have been called 
upon to face and overcome, what is needed is 
for men and women of courage, conscience, 
and conviction to step forward and come to 
the aid of their country by passing the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to strengthen 
the foundation of our democracy upon which 
all else depends, including the important nec-
essary investments to Build Back Better and 
mitigate the effects of Climate Change. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor 
of this rule governing debate of Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act.

January 13, 2022 
b 1045 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN), my friend and 
classmate from Houston, Harris Coun-
ty. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. Our country has a 
history of discriminating against peo-
ple of color and women when it comes 
to the right to vote. 
But that all changed in 1965, when 
President Lyndon Johnson signed the 
1965 Voting Rights Act because, you 
see, prior to his signing that act, in 
1965, there were four Asian Members of 
Congress. In 2021, there were 21 Mem-
bers. 
There were four Latino Members of 
Congress. In 2021, 54. 
There were six Black Members of 
Congress. In 2021, 60. 
And there were 18 women in Congress 
in 1965, and in 2021, there were 147. 
We must restore the Voting Rights 
Act and protect democracy. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, at this time in the interest of time, 
I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ALLRED), my friend 
from Dallas, who represents the 32nd 
Congressional District. 
Mr. ALLRED. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this should be a bi-
partisan vote. The right to vote has 
been reauthorized, and the Voting 
Rights Act has been reauthorized over-
whelmingly by bipartisan majorities in 
this House, and unanimously in the 
Senate. 
My constituent, George W. Bush, 
signed the reauthorization of the Vot-
ing Rights Act. But now it is time for 
us to not just restore the Voting 
Rights Act, but to make sure that we 
expand voting rights across the coun-
try, to give us a sword and a shield; the 
shield of the Voting Rights Act to pro-
tect the right to vote, to protect 
changes; and the sword of the Freedom 
to Vote Act and the expansions that it 
will provide, to vote by mail, voter reg-
istration, and allow every single Amer-
ican to make their voice heard in our 
elections. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, again, how much time do I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 4 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I say to the gentleman that I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. DAVIS is my friend, and I want 
the world to know that. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. The 
gentleman is also my friend. I appre-
ciate it. I enjoyed the debate and, 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to 
close, if I may. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
It is friendships like this with Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD, that I look around this 
Chamber and I think we, as Americans, 
should be celebrating what America is 
doing right. Look at the diversity of 
who serves here in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was 
necessary to stop discrimination, and 
it has worked. 
But make no mistake, today’s bill is 
not a voting rights bill. Today’s bill, 
unfortunately, is a bill that leads to 
lining your own campaign coffers with 
public funds. 
Now, Speaker PELOSI, the Speaker of 
the House, was here on the floor today. 
And no matter how many times she 
says it, that there are no taxpayer 
funds, it doesn’t make it true. 
Let me go through it. What happened 
is, the original H.R. 1 when proposed 
last Congress did have taxpayer fund-
ing of political campaigns, our own 
campaigns. But now they take the first 
ever corporate money, through cor-
porate fines. They put it into the De-
partment of the Treasury’s laundering 
machine, and it comes out as part of 
the Department of the Treasury. Those 
are not public funds. 
Does that mean when you send your 
check to pay your taxes and it goes to 
the Department of the Treasury, that 
those aren’t public funds? 
Every single person who votes ‘‘yes’’ 
for this bill that is not a voting rights 
bill is voting to line their own cam-
paign pockets. That is not what the 
American people want. 
Ninety-four percent of Americans 
said it is easy to vote. We have asked, 
time and time again, give me one per-
son to show up at a hearing that said 
that they wanted to vote in the last 
election and couldn’t, not one person 
has walked through that door. Not one 
person has showed up on a Zoom call, 
not one person. 
Why in the world do we continue to 
try to gaslight the American people 
into thinking that this is about voting 
rights? This is not about voting rights. 
This about lining your own campaign 
coffers. 
This is about breaking a tradition in 
the Senate. This is about taking over 
and winning elections for one side over 
the other. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself as much time as I 
may consume in order to close. 
First of all, Madam Speaker, let me 
thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY DAVIS) for his kind words. 
When Members of Congress say to 
each other, ‘‘you are my friend,’’ I just 
want the world to know that we mean 
that sincerely. Mr. DAVIS and I are 
genuinely friends. I am the chairman of 
the subcommittee. He is the ranking 
member of our full committee, and we 
have a whole relationship. We respect 
each other. I thank Mr. DAVIS so much. 
And I thank our chair of the full 
Committee on House Administration, 
Congresswoman ZOE LOFGREN, who al-
lowed me to manage the floor today. 
And I want to thank her for her leader-
ship, not only on this committee, but 
also on the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
Madam Speaker, this has been a 
healthy debate. This is the way Con-
gress should work. This is a healthy de-
bate, and I look forward to debate in 
the Senate. I hope it will start forth-
with and conclude on Monday. I look 
forward to passage in the United States 
Senate. 
Madam Speaker, the choice before 
the House today is clear. We must pro-
tect our democracy. 
It is past time for this Congress to 
act. Historically, we have come to-
gether to protect the right to vote. 
From the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
that I remember so well, its subsequent 
reauthorizations, and various election 
administration bills, we have protected 
and expanded the right to vote. And 
Madam Speaker, we must do that 
again. 
The Voting Rights Act works. Along 
with Lani Guinier, and Julius Cham-
bers, and Leslie Winner, and Jack 
Greenberg, of the NAACP Legal De-
fense Fund, I joined with them in the 
1980s and successfully litigated Voting 
Rights Act cases in North Carolina. 
The Voting Rights Act works. 
Throughout my career, I have wit-
nessed this body come together to en-
sure all Americans have a voice in this 
democracy. We must do that again 
now. 
One of our most sacred rights in this 
country is the right to vote. Indeed, as 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
observed 
in 
Wesberry v. Sanders: ‘‘Other rights, 
even the most basic’’—the most basic— 
‘‘are illusory if the right to vote is un-
dermined.’’ 
As a Congress, as a Nation, we can-
not, we must not tolerate any voter 
suppression, any voter discrimination 
of any kind in any State in America. 
And so, I respectfully urge all of my 
colleagues, Democrat and Republican, 
all 435 of us, I urge all of us to support 
this bill. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time for a vote. 
Ms. 
LOFGREN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Throughout 
our 
history, 
we 
have 
fought to advance justice and extend 
the right to vote, to ensure every 
American can freely and equally par-
ticipate in our democracy. Chief Jus-
tice Earl Warren, in the Supreme 
Court’s Reynolds v. Sims (1964) opin-
ion, wrote that ‘‘[t]he right to vote 
freely for the candidate of one’s choice 
is of the essence of a democratic soci-
ety, and any restrictions on that right 
strike at the heart of representative 
government.’’ 
Even though top experts have repeat-
edly affirmed that the 2020 election was

January 13, 2022 
the safest and most secure in our Na-
tion’s history, Republican lawmakers 
across the country unleashed a wave of 
anti-voter and election sabotage laws, 
which experts predict will only inten-
sify this year, seizing on a defeated 
president’s Big Lie about widespread 
voter fraud. According to the Brennan 
Center for Justice, between January 1 
and December 7, 2021, at least 19 states 
passed 34 laws restricting access to vot-
ing. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act responds to this assault on our de-
mocracy. It includes two pieces of leg-
islation vital to ensuring every Amer-
ican has free, equitable, and secure ac-
cess to the ballot—the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, versions of 
which 
have 
previously 
passed 
the 
House last year. The John R. Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act also 
contains the Native American Voting 
Rights Act, a bill critical to ensuring 
the United States upholds its trust ob-
ligations and protects the voting rights 
of Native Americans. 
Under this legislation, every voter 
would be able to vote early or by mail, 
and would have the option of reg-
istering to vote electronically or in- 
person on any day of early voting or on 
Election Day. This provides voters 
with a variety of options that better fit 
the lives Americans lead in the 21st 
Century. 
The legislation would also unrig the 
political system by ending partisan 
gerrymandering. Gerrymandering may 
be the single biggest contributing fac-
tor to the bitter polarization we see 
today—ending it would be a monu-
mental achievement. 
In most states, redistricting is done 
behind closed doors allowing the ma-
jority party to swing the outcome of 
upcoming elections, preserve the status 
quo, and ensure years of noncompeti-
tive elections. 
The result is a troubling reality in 
which politicians choose their voters 
instead of voters picking their elected 
officials. Sadly, we are seeing this take 
place now in much of the country dur-
ing this redistricting cycle, which is 
giving new opportunities to many of 
last decade’s extreme gerrymanders. 
This is not what our Founding Fa-
thers intended. Furthermore, it is 
counterproductive 
to 
a 
well-func-
tioning democracy. 
The Redistricting Reform Act, a bill 
I wrote and introduced for several Con-
gresses sought to address these unfair 
redistricting practices. It was included 
as a component of the For the People 
Act, which the House passed in this and 
last Congress, and it is included again, 
in part, in this landmark piece of vot-
ing and elections legislation, the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
The redistricting reforms in the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
require that the congressional redis-
tricting plans enacted during this re-
districting cycle, and going forward, 
are drawn using specific criteria that, 
among other things, allow for coalition 
districts, expanded Section two Voting 
Rights Act protections, and protection 
of communities of interest. 
The bill also sets out judicial rem-
edies where states fail to comply with 
the requirements of the bill, including 
a private right of action. 
Importantly, the bill prohibits par-
tisan gerrymandering, and in response 
to the U.S. Supreme Court decision, 
Rucho v. Common Cause, includes a 
clear standard for courts to apply in 
such cases. 
Under section 5003(c)(3), plaintiffs 
may ask a federal court to determine 
whether a state’s plan has triggered a 
rebuttable presumption that it materi-
ally favors or disfavors a political 
party. A court’s determination on 
whether to apply the presumption is 
intended to be quick and straight-
forward. The bill includes a formula di-
recting courts to assess the partisan 
makeup of the new redistricting plan 
by referring to a specific set of pre-
vious statewide elections. 
Using the results of the partisanship 
assessment, a court must then apply 
one or more standard quantitative 
measures of partisan fairness. Cur-
rently, the only available measure that 
meets the description provided in the 
text is the simplified efficiency gap, a 
well-known measure in the field of po-
litical science. As confirmed by polit-
ical scientists, other existing quan-
titative measures do not qualify be-
cause none of them calculate a bench-
mark share of seats based on a party’s 
share of the statewide vote and meas-
ure the difference between that bench-
mark and actual expected seat share. 
However, the study of how best to 
measure partisan gerrymandering is 
evolving and the bill accounts for that: 
if a new measure that meets the defini-
tion in the bill is created and becomes 
‘‘standard’’ in the field of political 
science, courts would be permitted to 
rely on that measure when applying 
the rebuttable presumption test. Of 
course, any non-standard measure that 
has been prepared principally for liti-
gation may not be used. 
The rebuttable presumption test pro-
vides states with some leeway, and it 
will not lead to invalidation of every 
state plan with a partisan lean. A plan 
will be enjoined under section 5003(c)(3) 
only if, in 2 or more of the 4 historical 
elections assessed, it results in par-
tisan advantage or disadvantage in ex-
cess of 7 percent or one congressional 
district, whichever is greater. 
The simplified efficiency gap may be 
measured using seat share or percent-
age, which is why a plan may be meas-
ured by both the 7 percent and 1 con-
gressional district limit. To convert 
‘‘one congressional district’’ into a per-
centage applicable to a given state, a 
court must simply divide the number 1 
by the total number of congressional 
districts in a state. Thus, in a state 
with 9 congressional districts, the effi-
ciency gap limit would be 1/9, or 11.11 
percent. The 11.11 percent limit would 
apply because 11.11 percent is greater 
than 7 percent. However, in a state 
with fifteen congressional districts, the 
partisan advantage limit set by the law 
would be 7 percent, because 1 district 
equals 6.66 percent of the state’s 15 dis-
tricts, and 7 percent is greater than 6.66 
percent. 
Notably, the prohibition on partisan 
advantage ‘‘in excess of’ one congres-
sional district should not be read to ex-
empt plans with a partisan advantage 
falling between 1 and 2 congressional 
districts. Looking at a state with 12 
districts, a plan with a simplified effi-
ciency gap of 9 percent would trigger 
the rebuttable presumption because 9 
percent of twelve districts equals 1.08 
districts. 
These redistricting reform provisions 
in the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act would have a significant impact 
both in mitigating this decade’s gerry-
mandering and in helping to ensure the 
racial fairness of maps by eliminating 
partisanship as a defense for skewed 
maps. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
right now, our Nation is at a crossroads. 
As we speak, the sacred right to vote—the 
fundamental pillar on which our Nation was 
built on—is under attack. 
That’s why I rise today in strong support of 
H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act. This bill—itself a result of pro-
longed and spirited deliberation between the 
House and the Senate—will if enacted serve 
as a safeguard for our democracy for genera-
tions to come. 
Let me be clear: every American must have 
the opportunity to make their voices heard and 
their votes counted. This is an issue with no 
middle ground—when the voice or the vote of 
one is suppressed, so be it for us all. 
We have seen no better example of the at-
tack on voting rights than in my home state of 
Texas. Initiatives like SB. I have sought to un-
dermine the right to vote freely, fairly, and 
safely for people across the state—especially 
those in minority and underserved commu-
nities. We have and must continue to fight 
these archaic and discriminatory laws, and 
today is a step in the right direction. 
I would also be remiss if I didn’t point out 
that we are using a bill from the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, which I 
chair, to advance this legislation. Our Com-
mittee has traditionally focused on the issues 
of the future—items such as scientific re-
search, space exploration, and technological 
innovations. That is why it is fitting that the 
House Leadership chose one of our bills to 
guarantee that the United States Senate 
would debate the future of our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, simply put, we can no 
longer afford the cost of inaction on this issue. 
I urge my colleagues in both the House and 
Senate to support this legislation so that we 
can meet the urgency of the moment. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following letters of support for 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746.

over 700,000 federal and District of Columbia 
employees I write to urge you to pass the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act which 
combines key provisions of the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. 
It is crucial for Congress to restore key 
provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that 
were wrongly invalidated by the 2013 U.S. 
Supreme Court decision Shelby County v. 
Holder. These provisions are critical to pre-
vent state and local governments from pass-
ing laws discriminating against voters due to 
their race, ethnicity, or similar factors. 
Shelby 
County 
v. 
Holder 
struck 
the 
preclearance provision of the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, allowing states to implement 
voting restrictions such as onerous identi-
fication requirements, purged voter rolls, 
elimination of same day voting registration, 
and limitations of early voting. 
The fundamental right of all citizens to 
vote and participate in the elections process 
is key to our functioning democracy. Public 
servants defend and advance this right every 
day through their work protecting our envi-
ronment, caring for veterans, and safe-
guarding our country. Voting rights restric-
tions have a direct impact on federal work-
ers. A 2010 article in the Social Sciences 
Quarterly stated that public sector voting 
turnout was two to three percent higher 
than private sector union households. Voters 
who favor a strong federal government and 
recognize the contributions of the federal 
workforce are more likely to show that sup-
port when they cast a ballot. 
AFGE is a full and active partner in the 
traditional alliance between the civil rights 
and workers’ rights movement. As such we 
are actively engaged in efforts to protect the 
right to vote and to have all votes counted, 
in protection against discrimination in the 
workplace, and enforcement of justice every-
where. 
The preclearance section of the Voting 
Rights Act blocked discriminatory voting 
changes before implementation. Fifty-three 
percent 
of 
the 
states 
covered 
by 
the 
preclearance requirements imposed because 
of past discrimination had passed or imple-
mented 
voting 
restrictions 
that 
disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters. 
Immediately following the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Shelby County v. Holder, striking 
the preclearance provision of the Voting 
Rights Act, states previously subject to 
preclearance (Texas, Alabama, and North 
Carolina) implemented restrictive identifica-
tion requirements, purged voter rolls, elimi-
nated same day voting registration and lim-
ited early voting. AFGE opposes denying the 
ballot to any eligible voter. 
Voting rights restrictions have a direct im-
pact on federal workers. Statistics from the 
American National Election Studies indicate 
that union household turnout is 5.7 percent 
higher than that of nonunion households, 
and as noted above, public employees vote in 
greater numbers. Voters who favor a strong 
federal government and recognize the con-
tributions of the federal workforce are more 
likely to show that support when they cast a 
ballot. Allowing new voting restrictions by 
states trying to limit legitimate voters from 
exercising their rights affect federal employ-
ees. These new limitations cloaked in unsub-
stantiated claims of ‘‘ballot protection’’ in-
clude limiting polling places and locations 
for casting early ballots, banning provision 
of drinking water to voters waiting in line 
and imposing onerous restrictions on absen-
tee voting. Federal workers report for duty 
24 hours a day, seven days a week. They 
count on utilizing voting options to exercise 
their patriotic right to vote. 
AFGE calls on the House to pass the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. For ques-
tions, please contact Fiona Kohrman. 
Sincerely, 
EVERETT B. KELLEY, 
National President.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
members and officers of the Communications 
Workers of America (CWA), I am writing in 
strong support of the House Amendment to 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the 
Freedom to Vote and John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, which will ensure 
that voters can safely and freely cast their 
ballots, protect against election sabotage, 
stop partisan gerrymandering, and limit the 
influence of dark money in politics so that 
billionaires can’t buy elections. 
Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that 
restrict access to the ballot box in 2021 alone 
and more are under consideration today. 
States are passing racially-gerrymandered 
maps that dilute the power of Black and 
Brown voters. This legislation would fight 
back against all these attacks, ensure the 
ability for every American to participate in 
safe, accessible, and transparent elections 
and restore political power to America’s 
working families. 
These pieces of legislation are major step 
forward and our democracy cannot afford to 
wait any longer for these crucial changes. I 
strongly urge a majority vote in favor of 
these historic pieces of legislation and op-
pose any amendments that would undermine 
the bill’s protections. CWA will include votes 
related to consideration of this bill in our 
Congressional Scorecard. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
DAN MAUER, 
Director of Government Affairs, 
Communications Workers of America (CWA). 
AFT, 
January 13, 2022. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.7 
million members of the American Federation 
of Teachers, and the millions of American 
children and families we serve, I write in 
strong support of the House Amendment to 
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. This 
bill will ensure that voters can safely and 
freely cast their ballots, protect against 
election 
sabotage, 
stop 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering, and limit the influence of dark 
money in politics. 
The need to prevent voter subversion while 
re-establishing and strengthening the protec-
tions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is more 
pressing than ever before. The country also 
has a right to see where all its representa-
tives stand on the fundamental right of the 
people to decide who represents us in the 
halls of power. 
H.R. 5746 combines provisions from the 
Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. The Free-
dom to Vote Act would enable the most com-
prehensive voting reform in decades. It 
would establish rules for federal elections; 
require automatic registration of any eligi-
ble voter, making voting easier and more ac-
cessible; prohibit harassment and intimida-
tion of election workers; ban partisan gerry-
mandering; strengthen election cybersecu-
rity; better defend elections from foreign in-
terference; and provide vital funding for 
elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act would restore long-estab-
lished federal voting rights protections and 
prevent new state voter suppression meas-
ures from being enacted. 
In 2021 alone, 19 states enacted 34 new laws 
that restrict access to the ballot box, and 
more are under consideration today. Can-
didates are running for top election offices 
peddling Donald Trump’s ‘‘big lie.’’ States 
are passing racially gerrymandered maps 
that dilute the power of Black and Latino 
voters. This legislation would fight back 
against all these attacks and ensure the abil-
ity of every American to participate in safe, 
accessible and transparent elections. If we 
care about our democracy and our way of 
life, we can no longer sit idly by. H.R. 5746 
will ensure the right to vote is protected for 
all Americans. 
The late Rep. John Lewis once said, ‘‘The 
vote is precious. It is almost sacred. It is the 
most powerful nonviolent tool we have in 
our democracy.’’ Protecting our democratic 
principles is patriotic, not partisan. Our re-
sponsibility as citizens is not just to vote, it 
is to stand up so that everyone who is eligi-
ble can vote and every vote is counted. The 
bedrock of American democracy is participa-
tion at the ballot box for all, no matter their 
religion, their race, their income, their gen-
der, their age, where they come from, what 
state they reside in or their ZIP code. The 
procedures 
of 
a 
democratic 
institution 
should help preserve, not undermine, the 
principles of our democracy. 
I urge you to take the steps needed to pass 
H.R. 5746 without any delay. Thank you for 
considering our views on this important 
matter. 
Sincerely, 
RANDI WEINGARTEN, 
President, American Federation of Teachers. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following letters of 
support for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
5746. 
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, 
New York, NY, January 13, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As President and 
CEO of the National Urban League, and on 
behalf of its 91 affiliates in 37 states and the 
District of Columbia, I am writing to express 
our strong support for the House Amendment 
to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, as it is 
considered in the House and Senate in the 
coming days. As a historic civil rights orga-
nization dedicated to ensuring that all peo-
ple are able to exercise their fundamental 
right to vote, we stand with our fellow civil 
rights organizations in supporting this bill. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
will ensure that voters can safely and freely 
cast their ballots, protect against election 
sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and 
limit the influence of dark money in politics. 
In 2021 alone, 19 states have enacted 34 new 
laws that suppress the right to vote for all 
Americans and more are under consideration 
today. In addition, states are pursuing ma-
nipulative redistricting effoits which dis-
criminate against and dilute the representa-
tion of Black and Brown voters. This legisla-
tion would fight back against these attacks 
and ensure the ability for every American to 
participate in safe, accessible, and trans-
parent elections. 
Our organization fully endorses this bill, 
which responds to the current needs of this 
nation in the fight for voting rights, and 
urges you to support this legislation. For 
more information, please contact Yvette 
Badu-Nimako, Senior Director for Judiciary, 
Civil Rights and Social Justice. 
Sincerely, 
MARC H. MORIA, 
President and Chief Executive Officer, 
National Urban League.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H173 
January 13, 2022 
FAIR FIGHT ACTION, 
January 13, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We write in strong 
support of the House Amendment to the Sen-
ate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which will ensure 
that voters can safely and freely cast their 
ballots, protect against election sabotage, 
and stop partisan gerrymandering. This bill 
is critical to mitigating the harmful effects 
of extreme anti-voter bill SB 202, which 
passed in the Georgia legislature in 2021 and 
will severely restrict voting access for count-
less eligible Georgia voters. 
Georgia is just one of 19 states that en-
acted 34 new laws that restrict access to the 
ballot box in 2021 alone. Just four days into 
Georgia’s 2022 session, anti-voter legislators 
are already attempting to prohibit drop 
boxes entirely. In Georgia and in states 
across the country, carryover bills from 
2021—including bills that would ban no-ex-
cuse vote by mail and end automatic voter 
registration—are still active. What’s more, 
candidates are running for top election of-
fices peddling the Big Lie. We must stem the 
tide on this insidious erosion of our democ-
racy. Black and brown voters in Georgia and 
across the country are looking to Senators 
to stand on the right side of history by vot-
ing yes on the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act. This legislation would fight back 
against these attacks and ensure the ability 
for every American to participate in safe, ac-
cessible, and transparent elections. 
Our organization fully endorses this bill 
and urges you to support this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
FAIR FIGHT ACTION. 
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, 
Washington, DC, January 13, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of The 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, a coalition of more than 230 national 
organizations committed to promoting and 
protecting the civil and human rights of all 
persons in the United States, we write in 
strong support of the Freedom to Vote: John 
R. Lewis Act. 
This legislation fills a distinct and critical 
role in combatting barriers to voting and 
protecting our democracy. Every American 
should be able to rely on a baseline level of 
voting access, free from obstacles to the vot-
ing booth or attempts to dilute or nullify 
their votes. Only passage of the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act can make this aspi-
ration a reality. We urge you to move swiftly 
and pass this legislation. 
For far too long, our elections have been 
undermined by practices and tactics in-
tended to undercut the power and represen-
tation of African Americans, Latinos, Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders, Native 
Americans, people with disabilities, and 
other 
communities 
historically 
excluded 
from our political process. The Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act is a comprehensive 
package that would address these barriers, 
including by establishing uniform national 
standards for elections and restoring essen-
tial provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
would set a basic federal foundation for vot-
ing access for all Americans. It would re-
quire states to modernize voter registration 
by instituting automatic and same-day reg-
istration, protecting against discriminatory 
purges, allowing all voters to request mail 
ballots, and ensuring voters have access to 
early voting. The legislation would also per-
mit voters who lack photo identification to 
use a variety of documents to establish their 
identity, restore voting rights to citizens 
with past convictions once they complete 
any term of incarceration, and prevent state 
election subversion. 
Moreover, the bill would also ban partisan 
gerrymandering and ensure protections in 
the redistricting process for communities of 
color and people who speak a primary lan-
guage other than English. These reforms will 
make it easier for everyone to vote—and vir-
tually all of them address barriers that dis-
proportionately affect Black, Latino, Asian, 
and Native American voters and voters with 
disabilities and are modeled after reforms 
that have been successfully implemented in 
multiple states. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
would stop most of the worst anti-voter 
measures that some lawmakers are pro-
posing and passing in states across the coun-
try. For instance, the bill would eliminate 
efforts to roll back early voting by ensuring 
states offer at least two weeks of early vot-
ing, including on nights and weekends. Fur-
thermore, the legislation would require that 
provisional ballots are counted within a 
county and create a minimum standard for 
secure drop boxes, as well as establish Elec-
tion Day as a federal holiday. By providing a 
baseline set of national voting rules that 
every American can rely on, the bill protects 
all Americans, including voters of color, 
against efforts to manipulate those rules. In 
addition, it includes much-needed protec-
tions for groups including students, voters 
with disabilities, and military and overseas 
voters. 
The legislation would also restore the es-
sential provision of the Voting Rights Act 
that prevents the adoption of discriminatory 
voting practices before they go into effect by 
establishing a transparent process for pro-
tecting the right to vote. In addition, it will 
restore and strengthen other provisions of 
the Voting Rights Act to help bring down the 
barriers erected to silence Black, Brown, and 
Native people; young voters; people with dis-
abilities; and new Americans and ensure ev-
eryone has a voice in the decisions impacting 
our lives. Finally, the bill includes the Na-
tive American Voting Rights Act, which pro-
tects voting rights for Indigenous commu-
nities who face myriad unique challenges to 
fully participating in our democracy. 
The Voting Rights Act was passed with 
leadership from both the Republican and 
Democratic parties, and the reauthorizations 
of its enforcement provisions were signed 
into law each time by Republican presidents: 
President Richard Nixon in 1970, President 
Gerald 
Ford 
in 
1975, 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan in 1982, and President George W. 
Bush in 2006. For more than half a century, 
protecting citizens from racial discrimina-
tion in voting has been bipartisan work. 
CONCLUSION 
In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights 
Act to outlaw racial discrimination in vot-
ing, and it became our nation’s most success-
ful and consequential civil rights law. Pre-
viously, many states barred Black voters 
from participating in the political system 
through literacy tests, poll taxes, voter in-
timidation, and violence. By outlawing the 
tests and devices that prevented people of 
color from voting, the Voting Rights Act and 
its prophylactic preclearance formula put 
teeth into the 15th Amendment’s guarantee 
that no citizen can be denied the right to 
vote because of the color of their skin. 
For decades, Congressman John Lewis im-
plored his colleagues in Congress to realize 
the promise of equal opportunity for all in 
our democratic process. When President 
Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights 
Act, he declared the law a triumph and said, 
‘‘Today we strike away the last major shack-
le of . . . fierce and ancient bonds.’’ But 56 
years later, the shackles of white supremacy 
still restrict the full exercise of our rights 
and freedom to vote. Before his death, Con-
gressman Lewis wrote: ‘‘Time is of the es-
sence to preserve the integrity and promises 
of our democracy.’’ It is long past time for 
Congress to realize the promise of democracy 
for all and support the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act. If you have any questions 
or need additional information, please con-
tact Jesselyn McCurdy. 
Sincerely, 
WADE HENDERSON, 
Interim President and CEO. 
JESSELYN MCCURDY, 
Executive Vice Presi-
dent for Government 
Affairs. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, on the 
cusp of celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s birthday, this Congress has an important 
decision to make. Will we stand to protect vot-
ing rights or will we hide behind voter suppres-
sion laws? Will we protect the fundamental 
right to vote or will we undermine it? This is 
an easy decision to make, and I know where 
I stand—to protect the right to vote. Now is 
the time for action. Now is the time for Con-
gress to pass the Freedom to Vote John R. 
Lewis Act to the President’s desk. As Dr. King 
said, ‘‘The time is always right to do what is 
right.’’ And that time is now. 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the following letters of support 
for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H174 
January 13, 2022 
Last year, nineteen states enacted 34 new 
laws that restrict access to the ballot box, 
and as state legislatures begin new sessions 
this year, many more anti-voter bills are 
under consideration. States are passing ger-
rymandered maps that dilute the power of 
Black and Brown voters. And billionaires, 
special interests and dark-money groups con-
tinue to try to buy elections and drown out 
the voices of everyday Americans. This legis-
lation would fight back against all these at-
tacks and ensure the ability for all Ameri-
cans to have their voices heard and to par-
ticipate in safe, accessible, and transparent 
elections. 
It is essential that this legislation pass as 
expeditiously as possible. 
We strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Sincerely, 
KAREN HOBERT FLYNN, 
President, Common Cause. 
PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY, 
Washington, DC, January 13, 2022. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MEMBER
OF CONGRESS: Throughout 
our nation’s history, we have worked to 
build a more inclusive and representative de-
mocracy. This is our generation’s moment. 
On behalf of our 1.5 million supporters na-
tionwide, People For the American Way 
writes in strong support of the House amend-
ment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 5746, 
the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, 
which would help return power to the Amer-
ican people. 
When the ‘‘Conscience of Congress’’ John 
Lewis passed away in 2020, he was still fight-
ing to restore what the Voting Rights Act 
lost in Shelby County in 2013. Congressman 
Lewis supported the restorative Voting 
Right Advancement Act that now bears his 
name, and he wrote the Voter Empowerment 
Act to advance pro-voter measures and ac-
countability supports. Those measures, and 
more, now comprise much of H.R. 5746. The 
bill also addresses the devastating 2010 Su-
preme Court decision in Citizens United that 
unleashed a massive uptick in outside, often 
secret, political spending. It is designed to 
advance campaign finance reform—restoring 
balance and transparency and guarding 
against foreign interference. Finally, the 
new H.R. 5746 language recognizes the dan-
gers of political power grabs over election 
administration and the importance of eth-
ical public service. 
Our broken democracy has rendered us un-
able to fully address important substantive 
priorities for the American people. Right 
these wrongs by supporting the House 
amendment to the Senate amendment to 
H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act. 
Sincerely, 
MARGE BAKER, 
Executive Vice President.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: Our Maryland rep-

tainable future for all Marylanders, 
We write in strong support of the House 
Amendment to the Senate Amendment to 
H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act, which will ensure that voters can 
safely and freely cast their ballots, protect

JANUARY 13, 2022. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: We write in strong 
support of H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act. Our democracy is at an 
inflection point. The right to vote, and by 
extension to a free and fair election, is under 
the gravest threat in a generation. This re-
ality makes it all the more critical that the 
House pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. 
Lewis Act as expeditiously as possible. The 
Act will ensure that voters can safely and 
freely cast their ballots, protect against 
election 
sabotage, 
stop 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering, and limit the influence of dark 
money in politics so that billionaires can’t 
buy elections. 
The situation is dire. Nineteen states en-
acted 34 new laws that restrict access to the 
ballot box in 2021 alone and more are under 
consideration today. Candidates are running 
for top election offices peddling the Big Lie 
that the 2020 election was stolen. States are 
passing racially-gerrymandered maps that 
dilute the power of Black and Brown voters. 
This legislation would fight back against all 
these attacks and ensure the ability for 
every American to participate in safe, acces-
sible, and transparent elections. It would 
also take crucial steps to combat the corro-
sive influence of money in politics. 
CREW fully endorses and urges you to sup-
port this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
Citizens for Responsibility 
AND ETHICS IN WASHINGTON.

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE 
CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR 
OF H.R. 4394 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that I may 
hereafter be considered to be the first 
sponsor of H.R. 4394, a bill originally 
introduced by Representative Nunes of 
California, for the purposes of adding 
cosponsors and requesting reprintings 
pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
California? 
There was no objection.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority leader the schedule for next 
week. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the majority leader of the 
House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Mr. SCALISE for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, on Tuesday the 
House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning 
hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business 
with votes postponed, as usual, until 
6:30 p.m. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning 
hour and 12 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
And again, as usual, on Friday the 
House will meet at 9 a.m. for legisla-
tive business. 
The House, Madam Speaker, will con-
sider Senate 2959, the Supplemental 
Impact Aid Flexibility Act under sus-
pension of the rules. This bill passed 
the Senate unanimously. It is on sus-
pension in the House. It is coauthored 
by Representative JOE COURTNEY of the 
House. 
This bipartisan legislation allows 
local 
educational 
agencies 
partici-
pating in the Impact Aid Program to 
use the student count or Federal prop-
erty valuation data from their fiscal 
year 2022 program applications for 
their fiscal year 2023 applications. 
This, Madam Speaker, will prevent 
schools from losing substantial funding 
upon which they have relied to address 
COVID–19 learning loss by giving them 
more flexibility to use prepandemic 
data to calculate funding needs. 
The House may consider other bills 
under suspension of the rules. The com-
plete list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow. 
The House will also consider H.R. 
4673, the EVEST Act sponsored by 
Chairman MARK TAKANO of the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee, the rule for 
which we adopted this week. 
This legislation would automatically 
enroll eligible veterans into the VA 
healthcare system so that no veterans 
are left behind when it comes to receiv-
ing quality, affordable healthcare. 
Lastly, Madam Speaker, the House 
stands ready to act on the Build Back 
Better Act, as well as the Freedom to 
Vote: John R. Lewis Act should the 
Senate amend them and send them 
back to us. 
Additional 
legislative 
items, 
of 
course, are possible. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, on 
the school bill, I know one of the big 
concerns many people have been rais-
ing is trying to get schools open again. 
Last week it was reported that 5,200 
different schools were closed last week. 
And I know this Congress has sent bil-
lions of dollars to school systems 
across the country. The intent was 
that that money be used to get schools 
opened, and yet, there are some schools 
taking the money and staying closed, 
which goes against all the medical 
science out there. We know the damage 
this is doing to our young children, 
learning, depression, and so many 
other challenges that it creates for 
them. 
Will there be any part of that legisla-
tion that helps require that in order to 
get money schools have to be open? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, be-
cause I don’t have it in front of me, and 
I haven’t read it as carefully as perhaps 
I should have, I don’t know the specific 
answer to that question. 
What I do want to say, however, is 
that we need to have kids in school. 
Everybody says that the learning expe-
rience is substantially compromised by 
virtual learning. It is better than noth-
ing, and it has been pursued very vigor-
ously and with great positive effect. 
But having said that, we all think 
that young people ought to be back in 
schools. But I don’t know whether this 
bill, which passed the Senate unani-
mously, deals with that particular as-
pect that the gentleman asked about. 
But let me say this: I think that every 
school system has adopted the premise 
that in school is better. 
Clearly, we have been assaulted by a 
virus whose transmissibility is sub-
stantially more than the previous 
virus, the delta variant. The omicron 
variant, as we know, one of the prob-
lems is it is easily caught and easily 
transmitted.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H176 
January 13, 2022 
The good news is if you have taken a 
vaccination and had a booster, the 
likelihood of you going to the hospital 
is much smaller, and if you go to the 
hospital, you are much less sick. But 
having said that, we continue to have a 
challenge to get this under control. 
And the administration, properly so, 
and the overwhelming majority of the 
medical community, properly so, and 
the overwhelming majority of sci-
entists are recommending that we wear 
a mask, that we wear a KN95 or N95 
mask because they are much better 
than the surgical masks or the cloth 
masks, that we continue to wash our 
hands regularly, and we continue to 
keep our distance. 
But the gentleman and I agree that 
we need to ensure that—to the extent 
that it is possible and that parents will 
send their children to school because of 
being dissuaded by the transmissibility 
of this disease—we need to have kids in 
school. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate that. Maybe we can work on 
something that would ensure that as 
tax dollars are going to school systems 
that it is going to keep the schools 
open, not to allow them to then shut 
down on the kids because, as we know, 
the science is very clear that kids are 
much better off in school, safer in 
school than not being in school, and 
that the learning experience is dra-
matically less if they are not in school, 
as well as the mental conditions, the 
social development that is not occur-
ring if they are not in the classroom. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I think 
everybody is concerned about this. Cer-
tainly, every parent in my district and 
your district is concerned about this, 
and anybody who is concerned about 
the welfare of our children is concerned 
about it. 
But I think it would be appropriate 
for me to say that the teachers of 
America—and my wife was a teacher, 
and I happen to believe that teachers 
are the most important people in any 
society because they educate the lead-
ership and the citizens of tomorrow— 
have been put to an extraordinary 
challenge. 
And I have a granddaughter who has 
four children, so I have four great- 
grandchildren, three of whom are in 
school and were in school in 2020 and 
2021. And Judy, my granddaughter, who 
is named after my wife, has told me on 
numerous 
occasions 
what 
extraor-
dinary ends her children’s teachers— 
there were three different teachers at 
different levels in the school system— 
went to make sure that while they 
were home, while they were learning 
virtually that they had a positive, pro-
ductive experience. But all of them 
felt, I think, it is a lot easier to have 
kids in school if they can do so safely. 
I think that bears saying. 
Like 
medical 
personnel, 
teachers 
have been put through extraordinary 
stress, as have parents generally have 
been put through stress. 
So I think the gentleman’s concern is 
rightfully placed, and we need to do ev-
erything we can to make sure kids get 
back in school and have a learning ex-
perience like you and I had in the 
classroom. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, our 
teachers have been true heroes through 
this, our frontline hospital workers, 
people that work at grocery stores; we 
have seen so many people rising up to 
the challenge, and even where govern-
ments failed their ability to do their 
job. 
I know one challenge that, hopefully, 
we see resolved in the United States 
Supreme Court—it won’t be today; we 
were expecting it maybe this week, 
but, hopefully, early next week we see 
the Supreme Court resolve these chal-
lenges where there were mandates on 
vaccines that required people to get 
fired from their job if they chose a 
healthcare decision on vaccinations. 
I have been vaccinated. I know the 
gentleman from Maryland has too, but 
for those who haven’t, whether they 
are frontline hospital workers or teach-
ers, people shouldn’t be forced to lose 
their job based on that choice they 
make. But the Supreme Court will, 
hopefully, address that and resolve 
that next week. It is something that is 
out of our hands now, but it is in the 
court’s hands at the highest level. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I un-
derstand 
the 
gentleman’s 
position, 
which is held by a number of people. 
My own view is that employers make 
a reasonable decision when they say to 
an employee—for the sake, not only of 
the employee but for everybody else in 
the workplace with whom they work— 
that you are required to be vaccinated 
because we believe that science and 
medical personnel tell us that is a 
much safer route. But I understand 
there is a difference on that. 
But even then, I know Governors who 
have been against vaccines are not nec-
essarily against the employer requiring 
that as an employee requirement as op-
posed to a governmental requirement. 
Mr. SCALISE. And I would hope the 
government would drop that mandate, 
but if not, it is hopeful that the Court 
would make it clear that the govern-
ment doesn’t have the authority to re-
quire that people get fired if they don’t 
get vaccinated, encourage people to 
follow the science. If they have ques-
tions or concerns, that is a conversa-
tion they should have with their doc-
tor, not a government mandate. 
But as the gentleman knows, we may 
have disagreement on that, but fortu-
nately for us, it will get resolved at the 
Supreme Court, hopefully, early next 
week. 
I wanted to ask the gentleman since, 
we are looking at the schedule for next 
week, I didn’t notice any of the bills 
that we have highlighted in the past 
that would address some of the many 
crises our country is facing, whether it 
is inflation, whether it is high gas 
prices, whether it is the border crisis— 
all that are running out of control—the 
empty shelves that we are seeing at so 
many stores. 
Will the gentleman commit to work-
ing with us to bring some of the bills to 
the floor to address the real crises that 
are hurting hardworking families like 
the ones I just mentioned? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, first of 
all, let me say inflation is a serious 
challenge confronting American fami-
lies, particularly working families in 
this country. 
I live alone, and because I am just 
one person, I buy relatively small 
amounts of food at the grocery store. 
And I go to the grocery store nowadays 
and whether it is the price of bacon, 
which is at $12 a pound for Hormel or 
another meat packing, it is high, and I 
think to myself how a family not doing 
as well as I am doing and with kids to 
feed, how tough it is on them. So this 
inflation is very tough. 
It is a worldwide phenomenon. It is a 
phenomenon that is caused obviously 
by a pent-up demand asking for a lot of 
goods and chasing a lot of goods. And 
elementary economics, that any of us 
took in college, is that there are a lot 
of resources chasing few resources, i.e., 
a lot of money chasing a short supply 
of goods, and you have that demand so 
that it drives prices up. 
This pandemic has had a global effect 
on the supply chain. The supply chain 
has been substantially affected. This 
was not the fault of, frankly, either 
Biden or his predecessor in terms of 
what happened to the supply chain. In 
Singapore they shut down companies, 
as you know, for months at a time. 
They just shut them down, which is 
one of the things that has led to this 
chip shortage, which has had ramifica-
tions. 
So I want to assure the gentleman 
that the administration, our side of the 
aisle—I know your side of the aisle is 
very concerned about the inflationary 
pressure that is putting such a stress 
on America’s families. This pandemic 
has 
caused 
extraordinary, 
historic 
things to happen. That is the bad news. 
The good news is we have created 
more jobs in the last year and 2 months 
than were created—of course, net we 
lost jobs for the previous 4 years; over 
2 million jobs net lost. So the good 
news is that we have a number of eco-
nomic statistics that are, in fact, posi-
tive. However, having said that, we do 
need to be very concerned about infla-
tion. The administration has expressed 
their concern. 
We believe that the infrastructure 
bill will have a positive impact on in-
flation, assuming the Build Back Bet-
ter Act passes, which I assume at some 
point it will. 
b 1145 
I think that is going to have a very 
positive affect on inflation because it 
will help the supply chain, help the

health of the people, the employees, it 
will make people more able to get out. 
Childcare. It is going to help people get 
back to work, which will have a posi-
tive impact on the supply chain and on 
the availability of goods and services. 
So I think we are moving in the right 
direction. 
Unemployment, as the gentleman 
knows, which is down 3.9 percent. So 
while inflation is up and unacceptably 
high, historically high, over the last 4 
years, we need to get it down. And we 
see this phenomena happening all over 
the world. This is not the fault of the 
President or the Congress, it is the 
fault of an extraordinary, invasive, and 
widespread disease that has caused ex-
traordinary disruptions within our so-
ciety and economy. 
But we need to get a handle on it. We 
need to take action. So I will talk to 
the gentleman about what issues he be-
lieves would be helpful in that regard. 
Mr. SCALISE. Clearly, some of those 
bills that have been discussed and of-
fered up in the past to address the in-
flationary problems but also the poli-
cies of this administration that have 
caused that. And as we know from the 
energy crisis, it is not pandemic re-
lated that gas prices are so high. This 
President made a decision starting on 
day one of his administration to shut 
down American energy production, to 
shut down pipelines in America, green 
lighting pipelines in other countries, 
begging foreign countries to make 
more oil, but shutting off and making 
it harder to make energy in America. 
Clearly, 
that 
self-imposed 
supply 
shortage has created higher prices that 
we would love to see addressed. We 
might disagree philosophically on how 
to get there, but I don’t think there is 
much disagreement from people who 
spend over $100 filling their car up that 
it needs to change. But if you look at 
the workforce challenges, and every 
small business owner I talk to—I would 
imagine all of us could share similar 
stories—our small business owners are 
telling us they can’t find workers. 
Somebody might want to go to their 
favorite restaurant but they are wait-
ing an hour and a half and wondering 
why a third of the tables are empty, be-
cause they can’t get people to work. 
And so as some might want to look 
at the unemployment number, clearly 
the number of people that are not even 
in the workforce that just stopped 
working because they can get paid, 
right now large amounts of money, to 
stay at home is a challenge that we 
should confront here in this Congress 
to help encourage people to get back 
into the workforce, not to be paying 
people not to work. And the enhanced 
unemployment benefits were, one, part 
of that problem, but there were many 
other parts of that problem. 
But it is the idea that there are too 
many dollars, as the gentleman said, 
chasing too few goods is the driver of 
inflation, but the biggest driver of that 
is all of the money that has been spent 
in Washington. And if you look at 
about $6 trillion that has been spent on 
various relief packages—some of it was 
targeted to COVID, which we all sup-
ported, very bipartisan, some of it had 
nothing to do with COVID which, un-
fortunately, has created higher infla-
tion—there is talk right now that the 
administration—and I am not sure if 
the Democratic leadership is having se-
rious conversations on this—is looking 
at yet another bill, potentially over a 
trillion dollars of additional spending. 
I would ask the gentleman, is that 
something that is anticipated to be 
brought to the floor? I would urge, if 
that is being looked at, to not do it be-
cause there is about $800 billion re-
maining from other relief packages 
that are unspent. And hopefully we 
stop the spending in Washington that 
is driving inflation and try to encour-
age the economy to get opened at a 
more rapid pace. And if people need ad-
ditional help, to look to the money 
that is sitting there, the $800 billion 
that is unspent, rather than trillions 
more dollars that would be put into a 
marketplace that is already over-
saturated with Federal spending that is 
driving this inflation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman. Of course, as you 
know better than probably anybody, 
the Speaker appointed a task force to 
look exactly at that issue of the $800 
billion and what has been done, what 
has been spent to make sure that it has 
been properly spent, because you are 
the ranking member on the committee 
headed up by JIM CLYBURN that is look-
ing at those issues. I know you had a 
hearing this past week. 
Yes, we have a difference of opinion. 
The difference of opinion, you call it 
spending, I call it investment. We are 
investing in our children. We are in-
vesting in our families. We are invest-
ing in small businesses. We are invest-
ing in growth and opportunity. And we 
are investing in the ability of those 
folks that you talk about that are not 
in the workforce, the restaurant can’t 
hire. Why can’t they hire them? Be-
cause they are not paying sufficient 
amount to justify a mom getting 
childcare because childcare is so expen-
sive. Or she is caught—or a single dad— 
is caught in the catch-22 situation. If I 
go to work, I will earn money but I will 
pay it all to childcare. If I am going to 
pay it all to childcare, it is much bet-
ter for me as a parent to be with my 
child, if the net result is going to be 
pretty much a wash. 
We are investing in that. We are in-
vesting in childcare in the Build Back 
Better Act. We are investing in early 
childhood education, three- and four- 
year-olds. We believe that is invest-
ment. And it also is very important for 
that small business so that that mom 
or dad who has that child who is then 
going to go and be in a preschool envi-
ronment can have time to themselves 
so that they can, in fact, pursue em-
ployment without simply putting it 
from one pocket to another pocket, 
none of which is their pocket. 
So the difference, I think, really is 
you look at it as spending, we look at 
it as investment. We think it will have 
big, big return for our country. And 
that is what Build Back Better is 
about. The building back better you 
say it was not related to the pandemic. 
It clearly was related to the pandemic. 
The pandemic hit us in the gut. It hit 
everybody throughout the world in the 
gut. We have recovered better than 
anybody else in the world. And that is 
because we invested, sometimes in a bi-
partisan way, and sometimes in a par-
tisan way, but we invested in our peo-
ple, in our children, in our families, in 
our businesses, and in our health, gen-
erally of our country and indeed trying 
to help other parts of the world as well 
because this is a global pandemic that 
affects us all. 
But I think the real difference is, we 
perceive this as an investment. We 
think it will help grow America. I am 
sure you have heard me talk about, 
from time to time, the Make It In 
America agenda. Our investment in 
both the infrastructure bill and the 
Build Back Better will have a positive 
effect on Make It In America. 
So we see it, Mr. Whip, as invest-
ment. We think it will have a positive 
effect. We think it is having a positive 
effect. And as I say, unemployment is 
down below 4 percent and jobs are up 
over 6 million over the last 11 months. 
So that is a good accomplishment. Is it 
enough? Do we still have people who 
aren’t working for a varied number of 
reasons, many of which are related to 
COVID–19? 
So we see it as an investment, and I 
am hopeful the Build Back Better Act 
will pass and I hope that will have a 
positive effect not only on, as the 
President says, the next 5 years, but on 
the next five generations. So we are 
continuing to pursue that. 
But inflation, which is how we start-
ed this discussion, is a problem and we 
need to deal with it. I would be glad to 
talk to the gentleman about what he 
thinks will be helpful to do that. I 
know part of that is stop spending 
money. I think if we stop investing 
money, our country will not get to 
where it wants to be and where it is 
now with respect to the rest of the 
world, leading the rest of the world in 
terms of economic recovery from the 
pandemic. We are not there yet but we 
are going to get there 
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gen-
tleman, and clearly we have a dif-
ference on—— 
Mr. HOYER. Right. 
Mr. SCALISE. What the effects of 
spending trillions of dollars would 
have. And Build Back Better, as the 
gentleman brought up, would be about 
$4.5 trillion of higher taxes, additional 
spending, things that, by many ac-
counts, would increase inflation even 
higher; but we will see where the Sen-
ate goes on that bill. I am not sure if 
the gentleman is anticipating bringing

other legislation, the bipartisan bills 
that we did, to do things like create 
Operation Warp Speed, which was 
maybe one of the most successful 
things government did in reaction to a 
pandemic in the history of the world, 
to come up with not one, not two, but 
now three proven and effective vac-
cines in less than a year to a virus no 
one even knew about. It never hap-
pened in the history of the world but 
something that we came together, Re-
publicans and Democrats with Presi-
dent 
Trump, 
to 
achieve 
a 
great 
achievement, something we would sure 
urge President Biden to build on. 
Because President Biden did run with 
a promise that he would, ‘‘shut down 
the virus.’’ Clearly, he has failed at 
that. We have asked through a number 
of different means to have hearings on 
some of the things we have heard con-
cerns about. And I would start with 
testing. There was an article recently 
that the President was presented with 
a plan in October to come up with 
about 750 million tests that people 
could have for COVID at home that 
would be readily available by Christ-
mas where they, in October, antici-
pated a resurgence of COVID by De-
cember. 
It has been reported that the Presi-
dent rejected that plan. We have asked 
for a hearing into that. For whatever 
reason, the majority has not agreed to 
that. Here is a letter I sent to Mr. CLY-
BURN and Mrs. MALONEY through the 
Select Subcommittee on Coronavirus, 
as well as through the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. Myself and 
Ranking Member COMER asked to have 
a hearing into some of these things, 
the testing failures that were reported. 
If they are true, we ought to hear 
about them. If they are false, the ad-
ministration ought to be pointing that 
out. They have not, which tells me 
they must be true. But then why in Oc-
tober would the President have re-
jected a testing plan that could have 
prevented us from getting to the place 
we are at right now with this resur-
gence? 
What about some of the national 
plans that the President said he had as 
a candidate that then he later told 
Governors recently he doesn’t have a 
national plan on COVID. The mixed 
messaging coming from the adminis-
tration is causing tremendous confu-
sion across America, and we have 
asked that we have hearings to clarify, 
give the administration a chance to 
state their plan or the lack thereof, 
state whether or not they rejected a 
massive testing plan for the Nation in 
October that would have prevented 
what happened in December. 
The lack of desire by the administra-
tion to be transparent about any of 
this is creating tremendous confusion 
across the country. This Congress 
could address that by holding hearings 
to get the facts out. I know we are 
going to continue to press for those 
kinds of hearings. I would hope we have 
them, but so far we have not gotten 
any response to the affirmative on 
that. 
I don’t know if the gentleman has 
anything to add. Maybe the gentleman 
would agree that we would have these 
kind of hearings to get some of these 
facts out or get some of these issues 
addressed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I would say at the outset, I believe the 
committee on which he serves with Mr. 
CLYBURN
is one of the committees, 
among many, who ought to be looking 
at those facts. 
But let me say this, because in stat-
ing the facts, as you just did, the ap-
pearance is that substantial progress 
has not been made. I don’t think that 
premise is correct. Let me read you 
some statistics. 
Last year, the first year the Presi-
dent came into office, testing in Amer-
ica was molecular in at-home tests per 
day. The beginning of last year, 1.7 mil-
lion per day. Today, 11.7 million tests 
per day are being conducted. 
So to imply that somehow there has 
not been substantial progress, that is a 
10-fold increase in the testing available 
to Americans every day. And when 
Biden took office, zero at-home rapid 
tests were available to consumers— 
zero. Today, 300 million at-home rapid 
tests are on the market each month. 
Enough? No. Are more coming? Yes. 
Has the government used the Defense 
Production Act to accomplish greater 
production? They have. The adminis-
tration started using, as I said, the De-
fense Production Act. The Biden ad-
ministration is increasing places peo-
ple can get free tests, for instance. 
You talk about a plan. When Biden 
took office, there were only 2,500 phar-
macies offering free testing. Today, 
there are 20,000 sites, an 8-fold increase. 
The administration is purchasing 500 
million at-home rapid tests to be dis-
tributed for free to Americans who 
want them, with initial delivery start-
ing this month. 
b 1200 
The administration is distributing up 
to 50 million free at-home self-tests to 
community health centers and rural 
health clinics. In addition to already 
covering PCR tests, the administration 
is requiring private insurance plans to 
cover at-home tests starting on Janu-
ary 15, just a couple of days from 
today. A lot is happening. 
Is enough happening? Enough is not 
happening until everybody has imme-
diate availability. ‘‘Immediate’’ may 
overstate it, but easy access. The fact 
is that some people are having prob-
lems finding the at-home tests now, 
and we need to work on that. 
Those statistics show you that ex-
traordinary increases have occurred 
under the Biden administration, and 
that is their plan, to make sure that 
these tests are available, because we 
know that testing will make a dif-
ference. If you find out you are sick, 
you quarantine. 
I suggest to the gentleman that the 
Biden administration has made an ex-
traordinary difference. Is the situation 
where we want it to be? Absolutely, it 
is not. 
Do we have a new variant that appar-
ently came out of South Africa or was 
first identified in South Africa that 
spiked up? 
I talked to Dr. Monahan yesterday, 
and apparently, just in recent days, we 
have had a fall-off in disease recog-
nized. I hope that is the case. I hope it 
keeps going down because we are per-
haps now using the KN–95 or N–95 
masks and keeping our distance a little 
more conscientiously. Let’s hope all of 
that works for the people, for the coun-
try, and for the globe. 
Mr. SCALISE. The problem with 
President Biden’s plan is that it has 
been reactionary and not visionary. 
When he was presented with a plan in 
October to make sure that every Amer-
ican that needed a test would have it in 
December, when they in October said 
there will probably be a real uptick in 
December, the President said no to 
that. 
So if today he says let’s go and order 
500 million tests, that sounds fine and 
well, except that he said no to that in 
October when he could have staved off 
what we see, and that is hours-long 
lines of people to get tested. People 
shouldn’t have to be waiting 5 hours in 
a line to get tested when the President 
in October was presented with a plan. 
Again, if he wasn’t, as it has been re-
ported, he should come out publicly 
and say that. The report has been out 
for weeks now, and he hasn’t done that. 
We should be having hearings on this 
to find out what was the plan that was 
presented and who was involved, by the 
way, in rejecting that plan. Was the 
CDC involved? Was NIH involved? Was 
HHS involved in rejecting a forward- 
thinking plan in October that predicted 
what inevitably did happen this Christ-
mas? 
Who was involved in the rejection of 
that plan, and why did they do it? Is it 
that the administration doesn’t want 
accountability? I don’t know, but we 
have asked those questions, and we 
have asked for a hearing on that. 
We have been told that it is not going 
to happen. I hope the gentleman would 
help push to get this to happen, to find 
this out so we don’t play catch-up 
every time something happens, when 
there were there people saying: Let’s 
try to stop something before it be-
comes a problem. 
If there are people in the White 
House who said, no, we are not going to 
do it until it is a problem for families, 
those people ought to be removed from 
the White House. And they shouldn’t 
be involved in the decisionmaking 
chain because their decisions caused 
maybe more death, surely caused a dra-
matic increase in ills that people are 
facing right now because it could have 
been staved off, and it wasn’t. We don’t

have that information from an admin-
istration who promised to be trans-
parent. 
We did have a hearing a few days ago 
in the select subcommittee. It was a 
private hearing; it wasn’t open to the 
public. I didn’t agree with that, but 
that was the decision made by the ma-
jority. We have to start having trans-
parency, as was promised to the people. 
People deserve transparency. They 
deserve to have these questions an-
swered and, frankly, to have a more 
forward-thinking plan, not a reac-
tionary plan when forward-thinking 
was presented and rejected. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this has been a calm 
discussion so far. Let me remind the 
gentleman that the previous President 
said in February or March of 2020 that 
this is going to go away in about 30 
days: Don’t worry about it. It will go 
away. 
A lot of your Members said we don’t 
need a mask; we don’t need to keep dis-
tance; we don’t need to wash our hands; 
this is going to go away. It is here 
today and gone tomorrow. That was 
the previous administration’s plan. 
I agree with you. The science com-
munity, the private-sector community, 
and government on Operation Warp 
Speed did a good job—extraordinary 
work in the private sector, extraor-
dinary work around the world. Because 
of the computer age in which we live, 
they were able to share information in-
stantaneously, in real time, and say 
that this alternative doesn’t work, 
which accelerated greatly the ability 
to get, within a year, an extraordinary 
accomplishment, largely from our sci-
entific and medical community but fa-
cilitated by Warp Speed. No doubt 
about that. Give credit where credit is 
due. 
Very 
frankly, 
the 
leader—unlike 
President Biden, who said this is a 
problem; we have to be careful; we have 
to pursue it; we have to invest—said no 
problem. The gentleman conveniently 
forgets that. 
He also ignores the statistics I just 
gave where we have had a tenfold, 
eightfold increase in the availability of 
testing and pharmaceutical access for 
literally millions of people. This is per 
day that we are talking about, 11.7 mil-
lion people per day. 
It doesn’t take too long at that rate 
that the whole country, all 330 million 
people, in about a month and a few 
days has been taken care of. When you 
say we have to make progress, we have 
made extraordinary progress. 
Our view is—and I know we differ on 
this—we have made investments in the 
American Rescue Plan Act to deal with 
the pandemic crisis; in the infrastruc-
ture bill to create jobs, additional 
manufacturing capacity, and training 
and apprenticeships for our people; in 
the Build Back Better bill to make 
sure that our families can keep their 
heads above water and can, in fact, 
have childcare that they can rely on 
and feel their children are safe so they 
can take a job, be productive citizens, 
and add to the growth of our economy. 
We believe we are doing that. Are we 
doing it perfectly? None of us do it per-
fectly. Perhaps we need to do more, as 
the gentleman implies, and have hear-
ings. 
The gentleman says he was in a hear-
ing. Private or public, I presume the 
gentleman had an opportunity to ask 
questions. I don’t know who the wit-
nesses were, so I don’t know what ex-
pertise they have. 
I can’t believe that if you requested 
of Mr. CLYBURN that you have relevant 
witnesses to come by and that you 
want to question about the progress 
that either has been made or you think 
ought to be made or further things that 
could be done, I can’t believe that he 
wouldn’t agree to do that. 
In any event, great progress is being 
made, but the entire world—not the 
Biden world, not America—the entire 
world is confronting a crisis and is hav-
ing a tough time getting ahold of it. 
We have done it better than anybody 
else in terms of growing our economy 
and keeping our people’s heads above 
water. That is to be applauded. 
Do we still have a challenge? We do. 
Are we still working on it? We are. Do 
we need to continue? Yes. 
Mr. 
SCALISE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
under President Trump, when he cre-
ated Operation Warp Speed, the one 
thing he did say is that we are going to 
move red tape so we can focus the en-
tire scientific community, both the 
Federal agencies but also the private 
sector, in working together in remov-
ing the red tape so they can focus on 
getting a vaccine. He didn’t say three, 
but he said let’s at least get them the 
ability, all of these great companies, 
many that are American companies, to 
go put their innovation to work and 
get bureaucracy and red tape out of the 
way and follow science but expedite so 
that we can get there quicker when 
many scientists, including some who 
still testify at committees today, said 
it was going to take years to get a vac-
cine. 
In less than a year, we had three. 
President Biden inherited that when he 
walked in the door and took the oath 
of office. He had three proven vaccines. 
I know the gentleman talks about 
statistics. Look at COVID deaths. Dur-
ing the campaign, President Biden not 
only said he would crush the virus, but 
he said that anybody who presided over 
that many deaths—that was months 
before the election—doesn’t deserve to 
be President of the United States. I 
thought that was an inappropriate 
statement. 
More people have died under Presi-
dent Biden’s watch from COVID than 
under President Trump’s. It was an un-
fair standard that President Biden put 
in place when he was at one of the de-
bates. If he is going to say things like 
he is going to crush the virus and going 
to have a plan, but then he comes out 
and obviously didn’t crush the virus 
and tells Governors that there is no 
Federal plan, I do think that is a mixed 
message, at the least. That dereliction 
in his promise, at the worst, ought to 
be confronted. 
What is the plan, if there is a plan? If 
there is not a plan, admit there is not 
a plan. But you campaigned saying 
there was going to be a plan, and clear-
ly, there is not one. Those are other 
facts that we can put on the table. 
Clearly, when you look at how Presi-
dent Trump pushed the Federal Gov-
ernment to work and partner with the 
private sector to move red tape so we 
can expedite the research and the 
trials, more tests than were ever done 
maybe on any other attempt for a vac-
cine, and come up in less than a year 
with vaccines when many said it would 
take years, it was clearly a remarkable 
achievement that we all worked on. 
President Trump led the effort, and we 
funded it in a very bipartisan way, and 
it was very effective. 
Obviously, this is a challenge for 
every country. There were other things 
said that ought to be put out there, and 
let’s at least try to all be saying the 
same thing and focusing on the same 
thing. 
When scientific experts say that this 
is what we anticipate happening—if 
you are going to reject that science, at 
least hold people accountable who were 
part of the discussions to reject that 
science, as I referred to the October re-
jection of a testing plan that would 
have been in effect for December that 
was rejected. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. For a long time, the 
former 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States—apparently, 
he 
changed 
his 
view now and criticized DeSantis for 
not pursuing mask wearing, et cetera, 
et cetera. The fact of the matter is, of 
course, the former President discour-
aged wearing masks early on. He dis-
couraged it: Oh, no, you don’t need to 
wear a mask. 
He had events that were spreader 
events, as we call them. 
The gentleman heard me say that I 
think the President followed good ad-
vice and made a decision on Warp 
Speed that was helpful. As the gen-
tleman noted, it was the scientists at 
NIH and scientists in the private sector 
and scientists throughout the world, 
but mainly our people, who did an ex-
traordinary thing in an extraordinarily 
short timeframe—never been done be-
fore—to develop this kind of vaccine. 
You talk about the three vaccines. 
The three manufacturers, it had never 
been done before. It was a wonderful 
event. Unfortunately, too many people 
are advising: Don’t take the vaccine. 
You don’t have to take the vaccine. 
Don’t sweat it. 
The government tells people they 
have to vaccinate their children to 
send them to school. Why? So other 
children don’t get sick.

I told you I had those great-grand-
children, three of whom are in school. 
They have a child that sits in front of 
them, a child that sits to the right, a 
child that sits to the left, and a child 
that sits behind them. I want all of 
them well because I don’t want my 
great-grandchild getting sick. 
I don’t think there was a very suc-
cessful effort either by the former 
President or by many on your side of 
the 
aisle 
to 
say—you 
talk 
about 
science—do what the scientists tell you 
to do. Now, I notice most of your Mem-
bers are doing so now, but still some 
wear it as a badge of courage and raise 
money off of it. I think that is harmful 
to our communities. 
I think you sort of just set aside no 
plan. Well, no plan has resulted going 
from 1.7 million to 11.7 million tests 
per day. That is the plan. We invested 
in March, in the American Rescue Plan 
Act, in making sure that health serv-
ices could respond properly. A lot of 
money went into health and testing in 
the American Rescue Plan. 
You keep saying there is no plan. We 
have adopted plans, and we think they 
are positive plans. We think, hopefully, 
that we are going to get better soon. 
Neither President Trump nor Presi-
dent Biden was responsible for this ex-
traordinary virus. Our view is Presi-
dent Trump laid back for a long, long 
time before he really engaged heavily 
in this, and now he has changed his 
tune to a much more positive ‘‘listen 
to the scientists’’ kind of attitude, 
which we welcome. 
b 1215 
I disagree with the gentleman that 
there is not a plan. We adopted to-
gether in 2020 five major pieces of legis-
lation to address this challenge, and we 
have adopted in a partisan way, unfor-
tunately, bills that continue to fight 
that fight, and I think it is fighting it, 
not as successfully because we have a 
new variant, much more transmissible, 
a different type. It has metastasized 
into a more communicable disease. 
That has caused us a challenge, we are 
addressing that, and we are accel-
erating the availability of resources to 
do so. 
Mr. SCALISE. Clearly, we have some 
disagreements, but as we both have ad-
vocated for the vaccine, I do think one 
of the differences that we may have is 
that I strongly feel that it is a personal 
decision. It is a medical decision. And 
if government thinks that shaming 
people, threatening people, and firing 
people is going to address that chal-
lenge, they have missed the mark, and 
I wish they would instead move away 
from the shame and the firing. Hope-
fully the U.S. Supreme Court agrees 
with us and stops at least the firings of 
people by mandates from the govern-
ment and just encourages people to 
have that conversation with their doc-
tor if they have hesitation. But, ulti-
mately, it is a decision that each indi-
vidual would have to make. 
We will continue this conversation I 
am sure, and I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. I just want to say in 
terms of where we are today, the over-
whelming percentage—I am talking 
about 90 percent—of people who are 
getting really sick are people who are 
not vaccinated. And for the govern-
ment to say: You need to be vaccinated 
because we don’t want you coming to 
the office, we don’t want you coming 
with other people who are being care-
ful, who have been vaccinated, and who 
have done the responsible thing and 
getting them sick. Because what we 
have seen, unfortunately, even with 
vaccination, is that people who are 
vaccinated, of our own Members on 
both sides of the aisle who have been 
vaccinated, have gotten—thankfully— 
mild cases of COVID. 
But when we talk about the Presi-
dent 
wanting 
people 
to 
get 
vac-
cinated—and my friend indicates that 
he and I both are advocates of that, 
and/or requiring them to get vac-
cinated—the reason you require people 
to get vaccinated, the more people you 
have unvaccinated, the more hosts this 
virus has to metastasize and to grow 
into a different type of virus that can 
attack in different ways. That is why 
you do that. That is why they talk 70 
percent. Now we just have about 70 per-
cent in America now. Very frankly, if 
we had a higher percentage we would 
be better off. So let’s hope that we can 
work together to make sure that we 
give encouragement to people to do 
what the scientists advise. 
My friend talks about the reason we 
were so successful in that year under 
Warp Speed of getting those three vac-
cines is because the scientists knew 
what had to be done. They found out 
and they had quick discoveries and 
eliminated a lot of dead-ends relatively 
quickly because of our computer capa-
bility and transformation of informa-
tion around the world and dead-ends. 
If we listen to them, we would be bet-
ter off. But an awful lot of people are 
saying: Don’t listen to them. Don’t do 
it. 
When the gentleman says for health 
reasons, there are hundreds, probably 
billions, I don’t know what the billions 
are, people who have been vaccinated 
with 
a 
miniscule 
and 
almost 
undetectable adverse reaction. So I 
don’t know what the gentleman talks 
about for health reasons. I know 
Djokovic is saying he is doing it for 
health reasons. I don’t know what 
those are. Maybe my friend does. I am 
not an expert enough to know what 
that is. But all the doctors I talk to— 
and certainly our own doctor here 
whom we consult with on a regular 
basis, I know both of us have done 
that—say get the vaccine. 
So I would hope that all of us would 
ask our constituents to get the vac-
cine. It is good for you, it saves your 
lives, it saves your families, and it 
saves others. Get it. 
Mr. SCALISE. To be clear, I never 
said it was for health reasons. I said it 
was a health decision. So this is a med-
ical decision that people are making. 
Again, in the past we have seen this 
suggested by some in the medical com-
munity inaccurately that if you get 
vaccinated you can’t get the virus. A 
Supreme Court Justice said that if you 
get vaccinated you can’t spread the 
virus. That turned out to be false. We 
know whether vaccinated or not you 
can get the virus. You can receive the 
virus, you can give it to other people, 
and you can die. We know in the hos-
pitals the higher propensity of people 
in the hospitals are unvaccinated. 
Those are the kinds of things that we 
should be encouraging to get the facts 
out and then encouraging people to go 
make their decision with their doctor 
if they have concerns and questions. 
There are valid questions. There are 
people in the past who have raised reli-
gious exemptions to other vaccines 
and, by the way, been given approval 
for those religious exemptions that 
today are not getting similar religious 
exemptions for this. 
So let’s just treat it equally, let’s 
treat it fairly, and let’s just focus on 
the facts. This idea that if you man-
date something and threaten somebody 
it is going to change behavior, it is just 
not proving itself to be correct, and it 
is causing more division and forcing 
people into corners that they shouldn’t 
be on. So hopefully, again, we can con-
tinue this conversation and get back to 
a place where we are in agreement 
which we have been in things like Op-
eration Warp Speed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S COVID CRISIS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to address 
President Biden’s COVID crisis. 
Sadly, 
COVID–19 
cases 
and 
hos-
pitalizations in the United States have 
reached record highs in the past week. 
Many Americans are having trouble 
finding COVID at-home tests and dif-
ficulties in scheduling a time to be 
tested with their healthcare provider. 
What is President Biden’s response? 
In a recent COVID Zoom meeting 
with Governors, President Biden said: 
‘‘There is no Federal solution.’’ 
Now, this mishandling of the pan-
demic is disappointing. Operation Warp 
Speed, developed under the previous 
administration, 
provided 
significant 
vaccines in record time. This initiative 
also established a robust distribution 
plan, innovative treatments, medical 
equipment, and ever-growing testing 
capacity. 
Madam Speaker, in addition to this, 
our families are struggling to pay for 
everyday goods as inflation reaches a 
40-year high. We are facing a self-in-
flicted economic crisis as this adminis-
tration encourages our workforce to 
stay home. Our students continue to 
face uncertainty in their learning with 
last-minute school closures despite 
schools receiving ample COVID relief 
funding. 
To 
distract 
from 
these 
failures, 
President 
Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats are trying to change the 
rules in the Senate to pass their So-
cialist agenda. 
f 
VOTER SUPPRESSION 
(Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, on 
January 6 we witnessed a violent coup 
attempt in our Capitol fueled by the 
big lie. 
Our country continues to face a slow- 
moving coup in the form of voter sup-
pression. 
I have seen firsthand in my home 
State of Arizona voter suppression laws 
targeting people of color and a State 
senate that would rather waste tax-
payer money on a sham audit instead 
of upholding our sacred democratic 
right to vote. 
The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act is critical to protecting the vote in 
my State and States across the coun-
try where restrictive laws are being 
put into place to strip people of their 
right to vote. Arizona will stand strong 
together this weekend. Thousands will 
gather this Saturday in Phoenix for de-
mocracy and voting rights. 
Passing this bill today answers their 
call by guaranteeing access to democ-
racy for every Arizonan. 
Today the House showed where it 
stands. We won’t shrink from pro-
tecting our democracy and the voting 
rights of all Americans. It is past time 
for 
the 
U.S. 
Senate 
and 
Senator 
SINEMA to do the same. 
f 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
GRANVILLE CRANE 
(Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the memory of the 
late Granville Crane, surviving crew 
member of the USS Indianapolis and re-
cipient 
of 
the 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal. 
Mr. Crane was born in 1925 and 
turned 95 years old this year. He joined 
the ship’s crew at the age of 16, one of 
the youngest crew members to join at 
the height of World War II. 
In 1945 he participated in a top-secret 
trip to deliver parts for the first nu-
clear weapon ever used in combat and 
was aboard the same ship when it was 
torpedoed and sunk that year. 
Hundreds of men went down with 
their ship, and many more faced dehy-
dration, shark attacks, and exposure 
before there was any hope of rescue. Of 
1,195 men aboard, Mr. Crane was one of 
only 316 who survived. As Mr. Crane 
waited to be rescued, he clung to his 
faith. 
Mr. Crane will be remembered as a 
family man, a hero, a survivor, a pa-
triot, and a great man of God. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District and our great Nation, 
we are forever in Mr. Crane’s debt. Our 
prayers are with Mr. Crane’s family at 
this time. May he rest in peace. 
f 
MINIMUM WAGE 
(Mr. CARTER of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, 20 States, including Lou-
isiana, still have the same hourly pay 
floor as the Federal minimum wage: 
$7.25. 
Louisiana also has the second highest 
poverty rate of any State. That is be-
cause minimum wage is a poverty 
wage—a full-time salary is less than 
$16,000 a year. No one can survive on 
that, much less raise a family on that 
wage. 
While the Federal minimum wage 
has not increased since 2009, the costs 
of 
housing, 
medicine, 
food, 
and 
childcare have all exponentially in-
creased. We cannot simply subject mil-
lions of our constituents to endure the 
trials of poverty. It is not a mystery. 
We can, we must, and we know how to 
help. It is time to finally increase the 
Federal minimum wage and lower the 
costs with the Build Back Better Act. 
INFLATION SURGE 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to the latest 
Consumer Price Index data released by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics just 
yesterday. 
This new data shows a 7 percent an-
nual increase in inflation—the largest 
12-month increase since 1982. The last 
time inflation was this out of control, 
Michael Jackson had just released 
‘‘Thriller’’. So from moonwalking to 
now 
sleepwalking 
with 
President 
Biden, we have continuously seen nega-
tive real wages, meaning that our pay 
is actually decreasing when you ac-
count for inflation. 
The President’s only idea is to print 
and spend more money. Gasoline is up 
50 percent. Propane, kerosene, and fire-
wood are up 34 percent; and beef, veal, 
and bacon are up 18 percent. Higher in-
flation is eroding the true purchasing 
power for all American families, and 
these record-breaking CPI numbers un-
derestimate the real cost of inflation. 
Americans need leadership that will 
prioritize getting our economy and our 
Nation back to its pre-pandemic per-
formance.

AMERICA’S CHILDREN ARE 
COUNTING ON US 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, Jan-
uary 14 marks the first time in 6 
months that families will not receive 
an expanded child tax credit payment, 
a program to support children and fam-
ilies that Congress passed last spring 
with the American Rescue Plan. 
For the last 6 months, working and 
low-income families have had the relief 
of knowing that every month they 
would receive $250 per child, and $300 
for kids under six. 
These payments have been a lifeline 
for families, helping them put food on 
the table and provide for children as 
the pandemic rages. As a result, child 
poverty and hunger then dropped in 
this country by almost half. 
More than 76,000 families in my dis-
trict received these monthly payments, 
and they are worried about what will 
happen now that the payments have 
ended. Just last weekend, two constitu-
ents, a dad and a grandmother, ap-
proached me to say how important the 
CTC program had been. 
We cannot go backwards. The Senate 
must move quickly to pass the Build 
Back Better Act and extend the child 
tax credit. America’s children are 
counting on us.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
BATTALION CHIEF DAVID MAEKER 
(Mr. ELLZEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored to recognize an outstanding 
constituent of Texas 6, Battalion Chief 
David Maeker, who has dutifully served 
the people of Waxahachie for the past 
26 years. 
David was Battalion Chief in 2018 but 
was leading in and out of the fire sta-
tion well before that. Throughout his 
career, he has set the tone for what it 
means to be a good leader. 
I am incredibly proud to announce 
that Chief Maeker was named Fire-
fighter of the Year for Waxahachie in 
2021, an outstanding honor for which he 
deserves to be recognized. 
David also helps his community. He 
has done so by starting a nonprofit 
called Compassion for the Fatherless, 
which works with an orphanage over-
seas in fulfilling the needs of children 
by providing them with a strong foun-
dation to be successful in life. 
David, you truly lead by example. I, 
and the citizens of Waxahachie, thank 
you for your incredible service and 
leadership in our community and to 
those who need it most. 
Congratulations on the well-deserved 
honor. 
f 
DEMOCRATS DELIVER ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to announce it is finally 
infrastructure year for Georgia’s Fifth 
Congressional District. 
I have seen firsthand how the infra-
structure bill will transform the entire 
Fifth Congressional District in Geor-
gia. To share just a few projects: We 
are going to repair crumbling bridges 
in the city of South Fulton; extend the 
Peachtree 
Creek 
Greenway 
in 
Brookhaven; make Forest Park a more 
pedestrian-friendly city; and maintain 
Hartsfield-Jackson’s 
title 
as 
the 
world’s busiest airport. We are deliv-
ering for the people. 
I am especially proud that the infra-
structure bill includes the Recon-
necting Neighborhoods Program, based 
on legislation that I wrote. This pro-
gram will reconnect neighborhoods 
like the Sweet Auburn district that 
was intentionally divided by the con-
struction of Federal interstates. 
This is a matter of racial justice be-
cause far too often, it was Black neigh-
borhoods that were divided. I have met 
with community leaders to hear what 
they need from the program, and I will 
continue to be their voice in Wash-
ington as they build back better. 
And I almost forgot. While we are 
making these decades-overdue invest-
ments in infrastructure, we are going 
to also create millions of good-paying, 
union jobs. Democrats have delivered 
for the Fifth District and our country, 
and we are not done yet. 
f 
POTENTIAL TREATMENTS FOR 
COVID–19 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, it 
was a very disappointing recess. I knew 
at least three more people who passed 
away because of the COVID. 
For that reason, I was very dis-
appointed in President Biden’s com-
ments earlier today on television, in 
that I think he could have brought up 
things that would have prevented some 
of these unnecessary deaths. 
First 
of 
all, 
President 
Trump’s 
COVID was cured by monoclonal anti-
bodies 16 months ago. Nevertheless, in 
my district, we have a shortage of 
monoclonal antibodies. I have doctors 
or clinics calling me wondering where 
they are. It is a good question. 
They were available for the President 
of the United States 16 months ago. 
But, for some reason, President Biden 
and 
his 
team 
have 
shortages 
of 
monoclonal antibodies in my district 
that I am convinced would have saved 
some of these lives. 
The next thing I will point out is 
that my doctors tell me that people are 
better off if they are taking vitamin D, 
vitamin C, zinc, quercetin. All these 
things would save people’s lives if they 
were taking them up front before they 
got the virus. 
But again, President Biden gives a 
big speech. No comments on this; just 
let people die. 
f 
FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Sometimes it is 
extremely difficult, Madam Speaker, to 
really convey in this form both the 
pain and the emotion of one’s journey 
in life. 
I worked for the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, the conference 
that Dr. Martin Luther King and Ralph 
David Abernathy organized and gath-
ered foot soldiers for from around 
America. They were, in fact, the be-
loved community, and included the 
likes of John Robert Lewis and many 
others that sit in this House today. 
I walked on plantations and tried to 
register sharecroppers. And so, I come 
today to recount for us the words of Dr. 
King: ‘‘We shall overcome because the 
arc of the moral universe is long, but it 
bends toward justice.’’ 
We need to enact democracy reform 
now more than ever because State law-
makers introduced over 440 suppression 
bills in 49 States. 
We cannot allow the other body to 
stand on some sort of pro forma dig-
nity that they cannot overturn the fili-
buster, when people died for the vote. 
We honor Dr. King on Monday. I want 
that vote to be in his honor that we 
have voting rights. 
f 
HYPOCRISY IN PLANS FOR GREEN 
AND RENEWABLE ENERGY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, we 
have a lot of lofty goals in this country 
about green energy, renewable energy, 
and such. But we are not providing the 
ways in order to get there. 
One of the important components is 
the mined products that we need to go 
into various equipment and vehicles, et 
cetera. We are not able to mine the 
critical minerals, the rare earths in 
this country. 
For example, to get a permit to open 
a type of mine or expand a mine, it 
could be 15, 16, 18 years in this country 
while our neighbors just north of the 
border, a 2- or 3-year process to secure 
the permits to mine products that are 
desperately needed in this country if 
we are ever going to talk about meet-
ing the goals you would have for re-
newable energy, electric cars, and all 
that in order to lower the carbon foot-
print. 
So what is the hypocrisy here? In my 
home State of California, you can hard-
ly get mining done. You can hardly 
even keep electricity flowing because 
of taking away power plants due to— 
those are power plants that would be 
zero CO2. I don’t understand the hypoc-
risy. So we have to get smart about 
this.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF EU-
ROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT 
PRESI-
DENT DAVID SASSOLI 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of a champion 
for democracy, David Sassoli, Presi-
dent of the European Parliament, who 
passed away earlier this week. 
President Sassoli was a respected 
leader of conviction and principle; a 
distinguished Italian journalist-turned- 
public-servant dedicated to his service 
to helping vulnerable women, home-
lessness, individuals and the rights of 
refugees. 
Sassoli was a symbol of balance and 
generosity to Europe. His leadership 
and commitment to social justice will 
not be forgotten. He will be remem-
bered as a stalwart defender of the 
shared European and American values 
of human rights, the rule of law, and 
equality. 
I send my deepest condolences, as I 
know Members of the House do, to the 
people of the European Union. And my 
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily and loved ones.

BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROJECTS IN SAN DIEGO 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, our constituents sent us here 
to deliver for them, and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law is delivering for 
San Diego. 
Recently, the Department of Trans-
portation announced that $24 million 
has been allocated to the San Diego 
International Airport, supporting tour-
ism for our international city and help-
ing our economy recover. 
But it is not just the airport. $4.8 bil-
lion in highway funding has been allo-
cated to California already, the first of 
more than $29 billion in road and 
bridge funding coming to our State. 
Last week, I visited sites in my dis-
trict, in El Cerrito, Kensington, and 
Talmadge, where neighborhood roads 
were cracked, crumbling, and in need 
of repair. 
I have spoken with constituents, 
local officials, and small business own-
ers in La Mesa and El Cajon about the 
importance of transit, walkability, and 
broadband because this may be the 
largest infrastructure bill since Eisen-
hower, but it is also one that is focused 
on the needs of the 21st century. 
Connecting people by roads, transit, 
and high-speed internet can help us 
cross divides and expand opportunity. 
And it makes our society fairer, more 
sustainable, and more equitable. 
f 
PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to join President Biden 
and my colleagues in Congress in call-
ing for action, long-overdue action, to 
protect the right to vote. 
President Biden delivered a powerful 
speech this week in Georgia, and I am 
hopeful that this stiffened the spines of 
some of those here in the Capitol. I 
know that I want to live in the Amer-
ica of John Lewis, not Bull Connor, and 
the America of Dr. King, not George 
Wallace. 
Today, I was proud to vote for the 
vital legislation to protect the essen-
tial right to vote. Now the Senate must 
act, using all available means. 
The filibuster is not a law and it is 
not in the Constitution. It is a tradi-
tion that has been misused throughout 
history to deny civil and voting rights, 
and it is being used again today. What 
is in the Constitution? The right to 
vote. 
Ahead of Dr. Martin Luther King 
Day, it is time to honor those who 
came before us to secure the America 
that we live in today. The eyes of his-
tory are upon us. We cannot let this 
moment pass us by. 
INFRASTRUCTURE CREATES JOBS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
every American deserves the opportu-
nities that a good-paying job makes 
possible. 
Working with the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration, Democrats in Congress 
have expanded those opportunities. 
Thanks to investments like the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, job creation is at 
record levels. The Bipartisan Infra-
structure Law will create millions 
more good-paying, union jobs. 
Not only will it rebuild our roads and 
bridges, but it also invests in infra-
structure that will spur economic de-
velopment in our communities. 
Removing lead pipes and guaran-
teeing clean drinking water for 10 mil-
lion more Americans will improve com-
munity health and help attract new 
companies that will bring jobs and in-
vestments. So will expanding reliable 
broadband and modernizing regional 
airports like the DeKalb Taylor Munic-
ipal Airport in my district. 
Finally, expanding our electric vehi-
cle charging network will give Ameri-
cans more options when choosing a new 
car, while accelerating climate action. 
I am so proud to work with the 
Biden-Harris administration to rebuild 
infrastructure for Illinois families, and 
we are just getting started.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
MARGARET HILL 
(Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the extraordinary 
life of Dr. Margaret Hill, who passed 
away peacefully last month at the age 
of 81. She was, for many who knew her, 
the heartbeat of San Bernardino. 
For 50 years, she devoted herself to 
ensuring all children have access to 
high-quality education. In 1971, she 
began as a high school teacher, and 
would go on to serve as principal, as-
sistant 
superintendent 
for 
San 
Bernardino County, an adjunct pro-
fessor and, finally, the last decade, 
when I have known her more as a 
school 
board 
member 
for 
San 
Bernardino City Unified. 
Through all her roles, Dr. Hill never 
wavered in her devotion to the children 
of our community. Her warmth, her 
wisdom, and her kind spirit will be 
missed, but her legacy lives on in the 
countless lives that she touched in the 
classroom and in the community. 
It was a privilege to know her, 
Madam Speaker. May she rest in peace.

THOSE WHO CANNOT REMEMBER 
HISTORY ARE CONDEMNED TO 
REPEAT IT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from South Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
first got interested in and started 
studying history as an 8-year-old. I 
grew up in a parsonage where my 
brothers and I were required, every 
morning before breakfast, to recite a 
Bible verse and, every evening before 
retiring to bed, we had to share with 
our parents a current event. 
We didn’t have television. Therefore, 
in order to carry out that rule, we had 
to read the newspapers. It was deliv-
ered to our home every afternoon. 
Today, those who are living down in 
my hometown of Sumter, you get the 
Sumter Daily Item in the morning. 
Back then it was an afternoon paper. 
It was my interest in the Presi-
dential campaign of Harry Truman 
that attracted me to politics. Harry 
Truman ascended to the Presidency 
from the Vice Presidency. Of course, no 
one gave him a chance to get elected 
on his own. He did not have, according 
to conventional wisdom, what it took, 
and he was going to be up against this 
scion, this big-time prosecutor from 
New York, Thomas Dewey. 
In fact, one Chicago newspaper was 
so assured of the outcome, they didn’t 
bother to wait on the results to write 
the headlines for their newspapers the 
day after the election. All of us remem-
ber that headline: ‘‘Dewey Wins.’’ 
When the votes were counted, all the 
votes were counted, Truman had been 
elected President. 
That always intrigued me, this man 
of limited educational background, a 
disability, without any of all of the 
trappings of what would make one a 
big-time leader. Of course, when Tru-
man left office, he was not very pop-
ular with a lot of people. In fact, his 
popularity was pretty low. 
But as we look back on history, and 
people continue to write about history, 
they keep upgrading Truman. Most 
places I see now, he is in the top ten. In 
my opinion, he is in the top five. I con-
sider myself, to this day, a Truman 
Democrat. 
After studying history, I went on to 
teach it. I became a firm believer in 
George Santayana’s admonition that 
those who cannot remember history— 
of course, he said ‘‘the past’’—are con-
demned to repeat it. That is what 
brings me to this floor today. 
It has been a long, long time since I 
have stayed here on what we call get-
away day to address this body during 
what we call Special Orders. 
I listened intently today as we de-
bated the legislation that was a vehicle 
by which we would send two pieces of 
legislation: The Freedom to Vote Act, 
a bill that was proposed by Senator JOE 
MANCHIN, and the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, a bill 
that this body approved and sent over 
to the Senate as H.R. 4. Upon John 
Lewis’ death, I came to this floor and 
asked and received unanimous consent 
to change the name of H.R. 4, to re-
name it in honor of John Lewis, and 
this body granted unanimous consent 
for that to happen. 
Now, John Lewis and I first met as 
19-year-old college students. I was in 
Orangeburg, South Carolina. He was 
down in Nashville, Tennessee. We met 
on the campus of Morehouse College, 
where the Vice President was on the 
day before yesterday, I think it was. It 
was also the weekend when I first met 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Now, as is often the case—and we saw 
quite a bit of it today—a disagreement 
cropped up between us so-called Young 
Turks, those of us who were in SNCC, 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee—in fact, this was the sec-
ond organizational meeting of SNCC— 
and SCLC, which was being run by 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Aber-
nathy, and others. 
We asked Dr. King to come and meet 
with us so we could try to reconcile our 
differences. Dr. King came and agreed 
to a 1-hour meeting. That meeting con-
vened at 10 p.m. in the evening. It was 
not over until 4 a.m. the next morning. 
I always refer to that evening and that 
meeting as my Saul-to-Paul trans-
formation. I came out of that meeting 
a changed man—well, I guess, boy. I 
have never been the same. 
I started reading everything I could 
about Dr. King. I went back to my 
campus, and I got his book, his first 
book, ‘‘Stride Toward Freedom,’’ and, 
of course, all the way down through his 
last book, ‘‘Where Do We Go from Here: 
Chaos or Community.’’ 
I interacted with him several times 
over the years. After the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, one of Dr. King’s first trips 
was to the little town of Kingstree, 
South Carolina, a rural town in Wil-
liamsburg County that is currently in 
my district. When he came that day, he 
came to talk to us about all the 
marches we were having. I was living 
in Charleston at the time. My late wife 
and I got in our little Falcon and drove 
to Kingstree to be a part of that meet-
ing. 
Dr. King talked that day about 
marching. We had marched to inte-
grate lunch counters. We had marched 
to get off the back of the bus. We had 
marched for a lot of social things. But 
he said to us on that day: It is time to 
march to the ballot boxes. He put a 
new definition on what marching was 
all about. I remember that day as if it 
were yesterday. 
In fact, not long ago, the local com-
munity decided to have a 50th anniver-
sary celebration of that event and 
called me and asked would I attend. I 
told them I would be glad to attend. 
b 1300 
Of course, I later got a phone call 
from a reporter who asked me what I 
was going to say at this 50th anniver-
sary. I told the reporter, I said: Well, I 
think I will reminisce a little bit about 
that day and the speech he gave. 
And he says: Well, did you see it on 
television? How do you know about the 
speech? 
I said: I was there.

January 13, 2022 
The reporter didn’t quite believe that 
I was there, and of course, he ques-
tioned me, wanting to know what I re-
membered most about that day. 
I said to him: The thing I remember 
most about that day was that there 
was a very big storm. In fact, the 
storm was so bad that, on our way 
there, we had to stop and wait it out. 
When I got there, I was sure that we 
were not going to have a celebration, 
but the sun came out, and Dr. King 
came. But there was so much rain in 
that cow pasture, I told him, that we 
were in, it was not very conducive for 
the convention. 
The reporter was kind of quiet, and 
he hung up. A few days later, the re-
porter called me back. The reporter 
had gone to the Weather Bureau to 
check out my story about that day and 
sheepishly reported to me that he had 
checked it out and that my description 
of that day was pretty accurate. 
I said: Well, I lived through it. The 
things you live through are the kinds 
of things you remember most, and you 
remember them best. 
I have lived through a lot, growing 
up in South Carolina. I remember the 
conversations I had with my parents. 
My mother was a beautician. As you 
can imagine, a lot of conversations go 
on in the beauty shop. 
So when my mother would sit down 
with me, we would often have discus-
sions about information that flowed 
throughout the beauty shop. In fact, I 
wrote about one day, coming home 
from school. One of the rules we had 
was that we had to stop by the beauty 
shop to report in after school every day 
to make sure that things had gone 
okay. 
On this particular day, when I went 
into the beauty shop to make my re-
port, there was a lady there that had 
grown up with my mother in the cotton 
field adjacent to the one that she grew 
up in over in Lee County, South Caro-
lina. 
When I walked in, I spoke, and this 
lady turned to me and says: My, my, 
how much you have grown since I last 
saw you. My goodness, she said, your 
voice is beginning to change. 
Then she asked me a question, what 
it is that you want to be when you 
grow up. That question was asked of us 
very often back then. I began to tell 
her how proud I was of that back-
ground that I had developed since 1948 
studying Harry Truman and how I had 
developed this interest in politics and 
government. I told her I wanted to 
grow up to be a Member of the United 
States Congress. 
That lady looked at me and very 
sternly said: Son, don’t you let any-
body else hear you say that again. 
That lady was not throwing cold 
water on my dreams. She just felt that 
a little Black boy in Sumter, South 
Carolina, should not have those kinds 
of dreams and aspirations. It was not 
safe for a little Black boy to have those 
kinds of dreams. 
My mother never said anything that 
day, but that night, when she closed 
the beauty shop, she came into the 
house and called me to the kitchen 
table, and she sat me down. 
She said: Now, JAMES, don’t you let 
what that lady said to you today ruin 
your dreams. You stay in school, you 
study hard, you stay out of trouble, 
and you will be able to live out your 
dreams and your aspirations. 
My mom did not live to see me get 
elected to Congress. She died in 1971. I 
didn’t get here until 1992. But I think 
about her almost every time I come 
into this Chamber, how right she was. 
So, today, looking back on that his-
tory, I recall from my studies that the 
first civil rights bill passed by this 
Congress was passed in 1866, giving the 
former slaves the right of citizenship. 
Of course, following that 1866 law, 
South Carolina held a constitutional 
convention in 1868. That was a very in-
teresting constitutional convention. 
I would like to share with you some 
of what took place in that convention. 
There are two things kind of inter-
esting about the convention to me. 
Number one is the majority of the 
attendees at that convention were 
Black. It is kind of interesting. 
The second one is there was an 
attendee at that convention, Robert 
Smalls, who was there in 1868. Robert 
Smalls had been a slave until 1862. Just 
think about that. He was a delegate to 
the South Carolina Constitutional Con-
vention and would go on to serve 10 
years in the South Carolina legislature 
and another 10 years here in the United 
States Congress—a former slave. 
Now, I don’t know how Robert Smalls 
felt about slavery. He didn’t like it. If 
he did, he would not have engineered 
the escape. He would not have stolen 
the Planter and taken his whole family 
and friends and delivered the Planter 
to the Union Army and got his freedom 
and $1,500 for having done so. And he 
turned that $1,500 into great wealth 
and had become a great soldier in the 
Union Army. 
Now, back then, Robert Smalls, a 
former slave, had not gone to school. 
He didn’t have a high school education, 
and therefore, though he wanted to be, 
they would not have taken him into 
the Navy. He was actually inducted 
into the Army and assigned to a Navy 
ship. That is why you see some ships 
now named for Robert Smalls. 
It was my great honor to be in Balti-
more, Maryland, at the Baltimore har-
bor to speak for the christening of the 
USS Robert Smalls. 
Now, however Robert Smalls may 
have felt, after Robert Smalls gained 
wealth, he went back to Beaufort, 
South Carolina, where he was born and 
raised and where he had been a slave. 
He bought the house that he had been 
a slave in. The McKee family that 
owned him legally, when they got 
back, Mr. McKee, John McKee—I think 
John was his first name—had passed 
away, and his wife was living in poor 
health and no wealth. 
Robert Smalls went and got her and 
brought her to that house that she had 
been the head of and he had been a 
slave in, and he nursed her, kept her 
there until her death. He forgave, but 
Robert Smalls never forgot. 
He died in 1915, basically of a broken 
heart. Why? Because Robert Smalls, 
who had been in that 1868 convention 
as a delegate, was also a delegate in 
the 1895 South Carolina Constitutional 
Convention. 
Now, in 1868, January 14, 1868, is when 
he got his State rights as a full-fledged 
American citizen, and then in 1895, 
Robert Smalls was in that convention. 
It was in that convention, September 
10, 1895, that Robert Smalls got all of 
his rights taken away. 
As I said earlier today on this floor, 
any rights given by the State, in this 
instance the United States, can be 
taken away by the States, in this in-
stance the United States. That is why 
I am fearful of what is taking place, 
most especially in the other body. 
What we did here today, sending 
those two bills to protect the voting 
rights of people of color, is being 
threatened by the other body with a 
filibuster. I have been saying for some 
time now that I believe very strongly 
that constitutional rights ought not be 
subjected to the filibustering whims of 
any one person. 
We don’t allow that for our budget 
matters. We call it reconciliation when 
it comes to doing the budget so that 
you can pass it. If everything in this 
bill applies to the budget, we can have 
a simple majority to pass it. When the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States was put at risk a couple of 
weeks ago, we worked around the fili-
buster in order to raise the debt limit 
so as not to ruin the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America. 
And you are telling me that the same 
should not apply to basic constitu-
tional rights? 
As I said here on the floor today, as 
a result of that 1895 convention that 
took all of those rights away, in 1897, 
George Washington Murray left the 
United States House of Representa-
tives, being the last Black person. At 
one point, of the four Black Represent-
atives in this House, three were from 
South Carolina. 
b 1315 
The very first Black person ever 
elected to the United States Congress— 
I want to clean that up because a lot of 
times I say that and people start send-
ing me pictures of Hiram Revels, and 
what’s his name down there in Lou-
isiana. Look, they were Senators, and 
they were sent to this Congress by 
their legislative bodies. 
It was not until, what, 1913 when we 
changed the Constitution in 1913 to 
allow for the popular election of Sen-
ators. So the first person of color, the 
first Black person to be elected to the 
United States Congress was Joseph 
Rainey. We just named a room on the 
first floor of this Capitol in his honor. 
It just so happens it was on the 150th 
anniversary of his election, which I

think was December 12, I believe, in a 
special election, December 12, 1870. And 
it just so happened that on that day, 
none of us knew it, but when we got to 
the room that we named in his honor 
and we looked, guess what number was 
on the room? Room 150. It is now 
named for Joseph Rainey from George-
town, South Carolina. He was the first 
one in 1870. 
In 1897 George Washington Murray 
left this Congress. And because of the 
Constitutional Convention, what they 
did in 1895, taking all the rights of 
Black people away, not another Black 
person got elected to this Congress 
from South Carolina until yours truly 
was elected in 1992: 95 years. 
And for most of that time, well, I 
hadn’t really counted all the days and 
the years, but let me say this: For a 
major portion of that time, if not most 
of it, Black people were in the majority 
in the State of South Carolina. They 
were in the majority but had zero rep-
resentation here in this Congress, zero 
representation in the legislature, and 
zero representation in governing bodies 
all over the State. 
I remember the first Black in South 
Carolina that got elected to the county 
council down in Beaufort, South Caro-
lina. All of these things happened in 
my lifetime. 
And so what I am saying to this body 
today and what I am saying to this 
great country of ours is that what we 
are doing here today in allowing States 
to pass laws that take away voting 
rights and privileges, just think about 
this, a State, one of my neighboring 
States, Georgia, just passed a law that 
says not only are we going to suppress, 
throw up all these barriers to voting, 
we aren’t just going to do that, but 
now if this line gets long and you are 
standing out here in the hot weather 
trying to cast a vote and someone de-
cides to give you a bottle of water to 
quench your thirst, they just com-
mitted a criminal act. You can give a 
bottle of water to anybody walking out 
on the streets if they are thirsty, but if 
you give a bottle of water while some-
one is standing to vote in line, you 
have just committed a criminal act. I 
want the people of this country to 
think about that. I want my friends in 
the other body to think about that. 
And then it went even further. They 
have put into the law a mechanism and 
a little entity, about I think three peo-
ple, and sent them up to be referees 
over whether or not the voting was to 
their liking, the results. And if they do 
not like the results of the vote, they 
can nullify the vote. That is what they 
just did. 
You got 19 States—and I want to has-
ten to add here all of them are not 
southern States—19 States, two of 
them up in the Northeast have passed 
34 laws and have introduced over 400 to 
make it difficult for people to vote and 
to nullify the efforts of voters. That is 
Third World stuff. That is banana re-
public stuff. That is not the stuff of 
which America is made. And we are 
going to sit idly by and just watch this 
happen? 
Earlier today, one of my colleagues 
on the other side was upset because 
someone has compared—I think maybe 
upset with the President. In fact, one 
of my colleagues said as a southerner 
he was insulted by President Biden’s 
speech. And the basis I understand of 
the insult is the fact that he called 
what these States are doing with these 
new laws Jim Crow 2.0. I am not into 
all of this IT stuff, so I don’t know 
what that really means, but I know 
this: It sounds like I agree with him. I 
am not insulted by that. Because Jim 
Crow was not Jim Crow until it became 
Jim Crow. 
Reconstruction—one of the reasons I 
sort of correct some of my friends 
sometimes when they say it is because 
I don’t want them to get things mud-
dled. I hear people talk all the time 
about me being the first Black Con-
gressman from South Carolina since 
Reconstruction. That is not true. All 
nine of us, the eight before me and me, 
we are all since Reconstruction. 
Reconstruction didn’t last but about 
12 to 13 years based upon which date 
you want to use, it didn’t last. Recon-
struction was over in 1876, so Robert 
Smalls did not get elected until the 
1880s. Robert Smalls got elected since 
Reconstruction. No. 
Reconstruction ended in 1876, and at 
the end of Reconstruction is when all 
these so-called Jim Crow laws went 
into place. The Black Codes went into 
place. Those things, those laws start-
ing with the Supreme Court decision in 
1872, the Crescent decision coming out 
of Louisiana, which is kind of inter-
esting. 
But Plessy v. Ferguson came out of 
Louisiana. And I want to thank the 
Governor of Louisiana for having— 
after all these years—issued a pardon 
to Homer Plessy, who is a man who was 
arrested and fined $25 for riding in a 
forbidden car on the train that he had 
paid a first-class ticket for and he was 
arrested putting in place separate but 
equal, which was never equal. 
And so I want to read to you some-
thing that was said in the 1895 conven-
tion by Robert Smalls. It is real inter-
esting. These are the words of a former 
slave: ‘‘Since Reconstruction times’’ 
and I am quoting Robert Smalls, 
‘‘53,000 Negroes have been killed in the 
South.’’ Since Reconstruction. Remem-
ber now, Reconstruction ended in 1876. 
So somewhere between 1876 and 1895 
when Robert Smalls made this speech 
he says: ‘‘ . . . 53,000 Negroes have been 
killed in the South, and not more than 
three White men have been convicted 
and’’—he said ‘‘hung’’ here, though I 
want everybody to know that I am edu-
cated enough to know that should have 
been hanged—‘‘for these crimes. I want 
you to be mindful of the fact that the 
good people of the north are watching 
this convention upon this subject. I 
hope you will make a Constitution that 
will stand the test. I hope that we may 
be able to say when our work is done 
that we have made as good a Constitu-
tion as the one we are doing away 
with.’’ 
Just think about that. They were 
doing away with the Constitution of 
1868 that gave Robert Smalls and other 
Blacks the right to vote, gave citizens 
those rights, and in 1895 he is saying, 
I’m hoping that when we finish here 
today we will have made a new Con-
stitution that is as good as the one 
that we are getting rid of. I think Rob-
ert Smalls knew very well what was in 
the making. 
There is another gentleman in that 
Constitutional Convention with him 
who also served in the Congress, Thom-
as E. Miller, he had served in the Con-
gress. And in order to get him to serve 
him in Congress, they made it attrac-
tive for him to be the first president of 
South Carolina State University where 
Joe Biden was a couple weeks ago and 
from which I graduated. Thomas Miller 
spoke on this issue, as well. 
But here is what I want you to under-
stand. One of the things they were put-
ting in this Constitution was in order 
to get the right to vote you had to be 
able to interpret sections of the Con-
stitution of the United States. You 
can’t get the right to vote until you in-
terpret the Constitution. And now 
some of the sections are a little worse 
than that. 
In Alabama—we have all seen the 
stories—in order to get the right to 
vote you had to be able to tell whoever 
was standing there—somebody who 
probably couldn’t even count, let alone 
understand 
the 
Constitution—how 
many jelly beans were in a jar. These 
were laws passed by States. And any-
body who may think that that is silly 
to have to be able to count or guess 
how many jelly beans are in a jar in 
order to get the right to vote, that is 
no more silly than arresting somebody 
for giving a bottle of water to some-
body standing in line in the hot sun. 
That is how stupid some of these 
laws they are passing are. And we in 
this body and my friends across the 
other 
side 
of 
this 
building 
are 
condoning that, saying that we can’t 
change this process to get rid of that 
kind of silliness. But this is serious 
stuff. 
b 1330 
‘‘How can you expect an ordinary 
man to understand and explain any 
section of the Constitution, to cor-
respond to the interpretation put upon 
it by the manager of an election.’’ 
And I guarantee you, some of these 
people—I knew some of them—who 
were running these elections could not 
read the Constitution, much less inter-
pret it. 
I want everybody to listen to this: 
When by a recent decision of the Su-
preme Court, composed of the most 
learned men in the State, two of them 
put one construction upon a section of 
the Constitution and the other justice 
put an entirely different construction 
upon it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H187 
January 13, 2022 
How did we get 5–4 decisions in the 
United States Supreme Court? Because 
five people think one way; four people 
think the other. Which one of them 
would get the right to vote, inter-
preting the Constitution? This is the 
kind of silliness here. 
To embody such a provision in the 
election law would be, to me, that 
every White man would interpret it all 
right and every Negro would interpret 
it wrong. 
And then Robert Smalls said, I ap-
peal to the gentleman from Edgefield 
to realize that he is not making the 
law for one set of men. 
Robert Smalls said, ‘‘Some morning, 
you may wake up to find that the bone 
and sinew of your country is gone . . . 
I tell you that the Negro is the bone 
and sinew of your country and you can-
not do without him. I do not believe 
you want to get rid of the Negro, else 
why did you impose a high tax on im-
migration agents who might come here 
to get him to leave?’’ That is very in-
sightful, very insightful. 
Now, Thomas Miller, who had also 
served in Congress, and as I just said, 
became the first President of South 
Carolina State, Thomas Miller was a 
free-born attorney. He was a college 
graduate. And as I said, he, too, had 
served in the Congress. As I told you 
earlier, in 1868, the majority of the del-
egates were Black. In the 1895 conven-
tion, six Blacks, only six. Thomas Mil-
ler was one of the six. 
Tillman, Miller told the convention, 
condemned Reconstruction-era polit-
ical corruption but had ‘‘not found 
voice eloquent enough, nor pen exact 
enough to mention those imperishable 
gifts bestowed upon South Carolina 
. . . by Negro legislators.’’ That is 
what he said. 
He said that ‘‘We were 8 years in 
power. We had built schoolhouses, es-
tablished charitable institutions, built 
and maintained the penitentiary sys-
tem, provided for the education of the 
deaf and’’—that is a colloquial term 
that is no longer used—to the deaf and 
mute—you can imagine what the other 
word is—and ‘‘rebuilt the jails and 
courthouses . . . In short,’’ he says, 
‘‘we had reconstructed the State.’’ 
Now, the reason I point this out to 
you is because he was a majority Black 
legislator 
in 
South 
Carolina 
that 
passed a law that provided for free pub-
lic education for everybody. Little old 
State of South Carolina was the first 
State in the Union to provide for free 
public education for everybody. Until 
that time throughout the South, only 
the elite were provided education. 
And as I said here, the school, the 
penitentiary system, the most modern 
penal system had been created in 
South Carolina by a majority of Black 
legislators; the school to educate the 
deaf and mute done by a majority of 
the Black legislators. And that is what 
Thomas Miller was talking about. 
Now, I want to say something about 
what Robert Smalls had to say about 
waking up and finding that the law you 
passed that was meant for me may one 
day apply to you. We just saw that last 
year in January when Georgia elected 
Senator OSSOFF. Senator OSSOFF ended 
up defeating an incumbent Senator. 
Now, that incumbent Senator was 
David Perdue. 
Now, let me tell you something inter-
esting about that, and I think that peo-
ple better start thinking. Georgia de-
cided several years ago—I remember 
when it happened—that because there 
were so many Black people voting, 
they decided to set up—and you can go 
back, I won’t go through it today, and 
read the debate that took place in the 
legislature. 
When Georgia decided in order to win 
a general election in Georgia, you had 
to have 50 percent plus 1. And man who 
proposed it argued on the floor that he 
was doing that in order to dilute, to 
nullify the effect of the Black vote, to 
make sure that you get to a 1-on-1 
Black versus White runoff requirement. 
He felt that if there were three or four 
people in the general election and then 
the Black people voted in unison, they 
could get a Black person elected to the 
Senate. And that is not what he wanted 
to happen. 
So he wanted to make sure that if 
there were more than two people run-
ning and nobody gets 50 percent, then 
you have to have a runoff in the gen-
eral election between those two. And if 
one was Black and the other was 
White, the White person was sure to 
win. 
Well, that tells you how shortsighted 
he was, because that is exactly what 
happened in that other election be-
tween Warnock and the incumbent 
Senator. Now, Warnock got a smaller 
vote than the person he was in the run-
off with, but he didn’t get 50 percent so 
they had to have a runoff. David 
Perdue got 49.8 percent of the vote, but 
it was not 50 percent. 
If they had not changed that law, 
David Perdue would have been re-
elected to the United States Senate on 
that day back in November. He never 
would have been in the runoff because 
he had 49.8 percent, but they put in the 
law that you got to get 50 percent. So 
now he has got to runoff. And he runs 
off against Ossoff and gets beat. He 
would have been elected if Georgia had 
not changed. 
Just like Robert Smalls told the peo-
ple of South Carolina: You are not 
making this law just for me. You are 
going to wake up one day and this law 
is going to apply to you. Just ask 
David Perdue. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CLYBURN. On the other side, the 
gentleman was shortsighted in his de-
bate in the legislature simply because 
Warnock was in this runoff. It was 
Black against White. But the people of 
Georgia decided they would elect a 
Black guy. So the Georgia legislature 
was wrong on both fronts when they 
put that law in place. The law that 
would have reelected Perdue was taken 
away and they put in place a law that 
was supposed to ensure his election, 
and he lost. And they lost on both 
fronts. 
So I say to my friends in the Senate, 
and I have been talking to them, and I 
am, quite frankly, very disappointed in 
my conversations and that is why I de-
cided to come to this floor today. I 
want to say to them, they should be 
careful. They should be very, very care-
ful because what may look like a good 
thing to do today, may not be such a 
good thing after it is operated for some 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I will give you back 
a few of these minutes. I could go on 
for some more. I have got some other 
things I probably should have said and 
I may have already said some things 
that I should not have said. But I did 
say I would say something interesting 
about that first Constitutional Conven-
tion in 1895. 
I just told you about free public 
schools, when in that Constitutional 
Convention, the guy that put up the 
resolution 
calling 
for 
free 
public 
schools was Robert Smalls. The penal 
system that they put in place, that was 
the envy of the world, done by the ma-
jority of Black legislators. I have 
talked about all that. 
But there was something else that 
they proposed that they couldn’t get 
done. They had proposed in 1868 at that 
convention, the majority of Black peo-
ple tried to give the vote to women—in 
1868. Something that did not happen 
until the 19th amendment in the 
1900s—whenever that was—1920-some-
thing. Just to let you know that skin 
color has nothing to do with the extent 
of progressive ideas or, what we might 
call, enlightened thought. 
Madam Speaker, I want to close 
with—I call it a poem. I used to quote 
it pretty often. A German theologian, 
Lutheran theologian named Martin— 
and I think I am pronouncing his last 
name right—Niemoller. It isn’t quite 
spelled that way, but I am not that 
equipped in the German language but I 
think that is the way it is pronounced. 
And I close with his words: 
First they came for the socialists, and I did 
not speak out because I was not a socialist. 
Then they came for the trade unionists, 
and I did not speak out because I was not a 
trade unionist. 
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not 
speak out because I was not a Jew. 
Then they came for me, and there was no 
one left to speak for me. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H188 
January 13, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I am going to try 
something. We talked about this over 
our Christmas break, that the first 
floor speech should be one that would 
be a bit more positive. As we started to 
work through the story, we wanted to 
tell and show some of the good things 
happening in the country, I came to a 
conclusion that I am going to have to, 
on a number of these, walk through 
how I believe the left’s policies—maybe 
not intentionally—but are actually 
really causing harm to things that are 
really good for America, good for the 
world, good for everyone here. 
So one of the things I am going to do 
is sort of walk through some really 
neat technologies and things that ac-
complish much of the good we want, 
and then sort of talk through a little 
bit of the policies that are being adopt-
ed here or promoted here that were ac-
tually screwed up. 
Just before the Christmas break, we 
did a floor presentation because there 
was an article out that there substan-
tially had been a cure—it was only one 
individual—but it was a proof-of-con-
cept cure for type 1 diabetes. They ba-
sically took a stem cell, turned it into 
an islet cell, reinjected the islet—islet 
cells produce insulin—and it worked. 
Obviously, we have all had our hearts 
broken over the years when we think 
there is a medical breakthrough, but 
this one has been being worked on for 
a decade. 
I found another article, another re-
search team, which actually took blood 
and then, using some hormones, took 
those blood cells and drove them back 
to functionally being a T cell, and then 
took the T cell being an islet cell—an 
insulin-producing cell. Why is this im-
portant? 
That first article we talked about, 
saying this is a miracle, we now know 
how to cure type 1 diabetes. The prob-
lem was that one was going to require 
anti-rejection drugs. This methodology 
doesn’t. You can cure type 1 diabetes 
and the individual because you did it 
from their blood. This is wonderful. 
My reason for starting with this is if 
you dig through the paper and some of 
the comments and some of the smart 
people that fixate on this, they start to 
say this is also a path for many of our 
brothers and sisters who suffer from 
type 2 diabetes. 
Why do we care so much about ulti-
mately curing type 2 diabetes? First 
off, this is actually a separation. I 
think it is more because no one has 
really presented this to my brothers 
and sisters on the left. We had the dis-
cussion in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee about how to help populations, 
the Tribal populations. Many Members 
here, they have urban minority popu-
lations that have overwhelmingly suf-
fered with diabetes. There becomes this 
conversation that we are going to build 
more medical clinics. 
When you head in that direction, 
what you are basically selling is that 
you are going to help Americans live 
with their misery. What I am trying to 
drill into this place is let’s move to 
cures because the cure is the most hon-
orable, loving, caring, and also the 
most effective thing we can do. 
Remember—it is going to be in my 
last couple boards—in about 29 years, 
the CBO says we are going to have $112 
trillion of borrowed money, and that 
was on last year’s calculation, in cur-
rent dollars publicly borrowed, $112 
trillion of borrowing. About 75 percent 
of that borrowing was just the shortfall 
in Medicare. 
We know 31 percent of Medicare 
spending is diabetes. Cure diabetes and 
type 2—it is complex. You have to be 
willing to actually change incentives 
on what we eat, what we grow, what is 
produced in food, how we deliver nutri-
tional support. 
Now that we actually have a way—or, 
it looks like we are going to have a 
way to help our brothers and sisters 
deal with their autoimmune rejection 
and go back to producing insulin again. 
It turns out, if it is true, that that 
path could be one of the most effective 
things ever in actually U.S. sovereign 
debt but also ending misery. We have a 
small problem, and we are going to get 
to that. 
I am going to show you as we walk 
through this where Democrat policies 
will actually stillborn many of these 
technologies that end this suffering 
and also have these amazing impacts of 
making people’s lives better, healthier, 
and actually having a real effect on 
this crazy amount of borrowing. 
My calculation from last month is we 
are actually borrowing about $47,000 
every second. As the next decade 
comes, that number goes up dramati-
cally. If you care about people’s retire-
ment security, my little girl’s eco-
nomic future, that should be the fixa-
tion here. You can take it on by doing 
good things. It is not cutting and slash-
ing programs. It is dealing with the 
drivers of that debt. It turns out 
healthcare costs are the primary driver 
of that debt. 
I did this slide just because, A, I 
thought it was cute, but it also helps 
us sort of think where we are tech-
nology-wise. Yes, that is a group of kit-
tens in a Starlink dish because it was 
warm, and everybody likes pictures of 
kittens. 
More to the point, today I believe 
there was another Falcon 9 rocket sent 
up to space to distribute a bunch more 
of these low Earth-orbiting WiFi sat-
ellites—broadband satellites. If you 
take a step backward and look at the 
budget that the Democrats promul-
gated for broadband and then take a re-
alization—hey, all of North America 
actually has broadband. The difference 
is it is not a wire; it is a satellite dish. 
Yes, the kittens are cute. 
So my Tribal communities in Ari-
zona that may be in the middle of no-
where, you know, a chapter house up in 
the Navajo reservation, they have 
broadband. They have been waiting for 
that broadband for decades, and this 
place keeps promising that we are 
going to run a piece of fiber, a piece of 
wire out there. Forgive my language, 
screw that. Put up the satellite dish— 
the small satellite dishes that are just 
a little larger than some of the big din-
ner plates. They have broadband. It 
would cost a fraction of what we are 
spending. 
That would be actually having this 
place read about technology, encour-
aging our staff to pay attention to 
what is happening in the scientific 
world instead of this place sounding 
like we are debating from the 1990s. 
How much of what goes behind these 
microphones is functioning decades out 
of date, rhetorically, technology-wise? 
It is just very, very frustrating. 
So one of my personal fixations—and 
we are going to talk about things like 
the Democrats’ H.R. 3 and their ap-
proach to healthcare. There is a revolu-
tion happening, and it is called person-
alized medicine. We are about to—not 
about to. It has happened. I beg people 
to 
sort 
of 
think 
about 
this 
conceptionally. Disease is about to be-
come a software program. Stop and 
think about that. 
What we have learned on stem cells, 
messenger RNA, and some of the de-
rivatives of messenger RNA, the fact of 
the matter is the cancer you have, the 
heart disease you have, the virus you 
have, even now the bacteria you may 
have in your bloodstream, by using the 
new technology, we are turning cures, 
but cures are functionally almost a 
software problem. We code it; we un-
derstand the DNA; we produce a cure. 
Yet, the vision of the legislation 
where the left says, well, we are going 
to 
control 
pharmaceutical 
prices, 
crushes the very innovation that is 
about to cure people. It turns out those 
cures are the thing that crashes the 
price of healthcare because 5 percent of 
our brothers and sisters who have 
chronic conditions, chronic diseases, 
chronic ailments are the majority of 
our healthcare spending. 
What the left has proposed is great 
politics. It is brilliant politics. Hey, we 
are going to go and functionally na-
tionalize the pricing mechanisms by 
referring to Europe, and that is how we 
are going to price drugs. Yes, the 
economists who do pharmaceutical re-
search say all these new innovative 
drugs are going to disappear, and we 
basically make Big Pharma bigger. 
What you have done is you have 
crushed the capital for the innovative 
cures, and you take those that are the 
maintenance drugs, the things that 
maintain 
our 
misery, 
and 
you 
incentivize them just to make tweaks 
to maybe make them a little better 
and extend their patents. That is actu-
ally the outcome of the left’s approach 
on healthcare. 
I don’t think it is done maliciously. I 
think it is just one of those occasions 
that you are going to see multiple 
times on these boards. Good intentions 
aren’t necessarily good outcome. Vir-
tue signaling doesn’t mean that it 
worked. It just means that the left gets

judged on good intentions, not on the 
outcomes. 
Even in the new papers that are out 
in the last month or two talking about 
CAR-T, which is a derivative of func-
tionally messenger RNA being used on 
heart disease—remember, heart disease 
is the number one killer as we get 
through this pandemic time. 
What 
happens 
if 
that 
back-to- 
healthcare disease is substantially a 
software problem? We actually have a 
way to have an incredible impact on 
the number one killer in our Nation. 
This is a wonderful thing. This is a 
really good thing. This does not happen 
quickly under the left’s H.R. 3 mecha-
nisms. They will stillborn much of this 
technology, the investment in it, and 
the ability to bring it to market. 
If the left and the right, if we actu-
ally give a darn, what we should be 
looking at here are the things that are 
disruptive that cure and what we do to 
get these technologies to our brothers 
and sisters as fast as possible. If it is 
true—and there now has been multiple 
research papers on this, and they are 
trying to now commercialize it, the 
ability for this to deal with the pro-
teins that cause some of the heart 
damage, allowing the heart to heal, 
that it is really incredibly effective. 
This is wonderful because we did not 
have this a year ago, even concep-
tually, and it is here. 
What happens if I come to you and 
say: Well, we have just learned how to 
do editing of small snippets of genetic 
code. We can end sickle cell anemia. 
This is working. It is back to my con-
stant of trying to pitch this concept of 
cure the disease, end the misery, don’t 
do what is the rhetorical method 
around this place, saying it is great 
politics for me to offer more healthcare 
clinics because that way it looks like I 
just did something, and it helps my re-
election. Yes, getting the actual cure 
to market might take a little bit 
longer. 
Do you remember at the beginning of 
the pandemic when we talked about 
getting a vaccine and this concept 
where we would get a vaccine in less 
than a year? The debates we were hav-
ing here were that, oh, that is pie in 
the sky, that is a fantasy, but it hap-
pened. It took a bunch of money. It 
took unleashing a lot of resources and 
freaky smart people and pushing the 
bureaucracy to become more efficient. 
But it happened. 
Madam Speaker, could you imagine 
if we had that same type of passion to 
cure diseases? We know how to cure 
now sickle cell anemia. How do we get 
this to our brothers and sisters who are 
suffering instead of trying to come up 
with another way to just do the main-
tenance? 
b 1400 
My argument behind this microphone 
right now is that these are wonderful 
things that are happening. 
How do we keep the Democrats’, the 
left’s, policies from destroying this 
progress? 
This is a little board that basically 
talks about the Democrats’ H.R. 3— 
wonderful rhetoric. Every voter, right 
and left, Republican and Democrat, is 
frustrated with pharmaceutical prices. 
Okay, but do they understand that the 
mechanism being proposed by the left— 
basically, the economists tell us that 
there are dozens and dozens of cures 
that are real expensive. 
Remember, many of these cures take 
billions and billions and billions of dol-
lars of research just to get them to 
market, and a substantial number of 
them, a majority, fail. A lot of those 
costs are our fault. The bureaucratic 
mechanisms—and a couple of us have 
ideas on how to streamline that proc-
ess and reduce that cost to get these 
revolutionary 
pharmaceuticals 
that 
cure to market. But this is really im-
portant. 
There is one other thing on this 
board that needs to be understood. The 
left’s pharmaceutical pricing proposal 
does something called reference pric-
ing. They reach over to Europe, take a 
handful of countries there that actu-
ally have what they—think of it as a 
formula that says quality life years. So 
if this drug costs more than a certain 
amount of money for an additional 
quality life year, they don’t buy it. 
There are countries over there that 
have pricing like I think in Great Brit-
ain was equivalent to 38,000 USD, that 
if the drug costs more than that, you 
can’t get it. That will reduce drug 
prices. It will also kill a whole bunch of 
people, and it will end the resources for 
the cures that come in the future. 
There are other ways to get there 
without crushing small pharma. That 
is basically the way that you make Big 
Pharma less big because you cure the 
very disease that the book of business 
over here makes money on by main-
taining. This isn’t hard economics. It is 
just math. And I accept this place is a 
math-free zone, but the math is the 
math. 
There are good things happening. We 
just have to stop much of the Demo-
crats’ policies, which are crushing 
these opportunities because, look, it is 
great politics. The rhetoric is great 
politics. It is crappy economics. 
I want to give you another simple ex-
ample, Madam Speaker, and this one is 
more maybe closer to home, being from 
Arizona. A couple weeks ago, a big rig 
tractor-trailer—I believe it was on I–10 
in Arizona—drove a fairly substantial 
distance completely autonomously. No 
driver 
at 
all, 
completely 
autono-
mously. 
Well, think about that. Let’s take a 
step. 
Didn’t we hear President Biden— 
what was it, a few weeks ago?—talk 
about the supply chain: We don’t have 
enough truck drivers. We are going to 
fix this. We are going to make it so 
goods can make it to the warehouses 
where they can be value added, the 
manufacturing, the store shelves. 
This was part of it because the 
United States, one of our greatest dif-
ficulties is our demographics. The re-
ality is we are getting much older very 
fast. I mean, what is it? The mean 
truck driver is somewhere in the mid- 
fifties. This is part of the solution. 
Okay. This is wonderful. 
How much of this place is really fix-
ated on the combination of resources, 
but it is also the regulatory, the litiga-
tion, and the liability standards to 
make this happen so it helps solve the 
transportation of goods here in the 
country? 
It is wonderful, except one small 
problem. The Democrats, in their infra-
structure bill, slipped in a wonderful 
little section. Because, remember, this 
is a supply chain. So the container 
comes off the ship, goes to the stack, 
goes to the truck, the truck we just 
saw we now have the autonomous tech-
nology that is starting to work. So 
what did the Democrats slip into their 
infrastructure bill? Making it so you 
can’t automate the port. 
So they, once again, sold out to the 
union because, well, that is who writes 
them checks. But you can’t have it 
both ways. You can’t have a President 
get behind the microphone and say: I 
am working on this; I am going to help 
solve the supply chain problem, wink, 
wink, nod, nod. I am going to hide it in 
the infrastructure legislation where 
the vast majority of the money did not 
go to actually infrastructure, and then 
put in things in there saying: But we 
are going to also make sure you can’t 
automate the ports. 
This is special interest legislation be-
cause Congress has become a protec-
tion racket. You are this union. You 
come in. You have enough friends here. 
They will actually do something that 
protects that book of business against 
what was good for the entire country. 
So all of this technology that is 
about to help us deal with our worker 
shortage, our supply chain shortage, 
actually gets stymied because the left 
basically says the union is more impor-
tant than the rest of the country. Let’s 
make sure you make it so we can’t 
make our ports more efficient. 
That is a classic example of good 
things were happening. And the tech-
nology isn’t Republican or Democrat, 
but you have to make it so it comes to-
gether. 
The left constantly selling out to 
their special interests basically crush-
es the very things that create the pro-
ductivity that we desperately need for 
the future of this country because, re-
member, growth is moral. Growth 
makes the poor a lot less poor. And 
then to do these backdoor little deals 
that actually crush the efficiencies and 
the productivity that make the society 
wealthier, it is a wink, wink, nod, nod. 
It may be great politics, but it is really 
crappy economics. 
So let’s actually talk about another 
thing that is happening. How many 
speeches have we been giving about 
global warming here? A lot of our 
brothers and sisters care passionately 
about this. And then on the other side

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H190 
January 13, 2022 
of the very beginning of the Biden ad-
ministration with the help of many of 
my Democrat colleagues here, they ba-
sically trumped down on permitting, 
regulations, 
accessibility, 
pipelines, 
those things for natural gas, even 
though we know over the previous dec-
ade and a half natural gas was the sub-
stantial, by far, driver of the reduction 
of North America’s greenhouse gases 
because it burned so much more effi-
ciently. Because accessibility had be-
come so available, the price of natural 
gas had come down so much that facil-
ity after facility that were generating 
electricity had switched to natural gas 
away from coal. 
So what did the Democrats do this 
last year? They made natural gas sub-
stantially more expensive. Well, what 
did they think was going to happen? 
Congratulations to my brothers and 
sisters on the left, which I believe they 
have increased coal usage by 23 percent 
last year over where the Trump admin-
istration was, which was accused of 
being too friendly to coal by the envi-
ronmental left had, because of the pro-
ductivity and accessibility to natural 
gas, natural gas prices fell, and use of 
coal went down dramatically. The left 
comes in and starts to do all sorts of 
regulations, permitting, restrictions, 
those things for natural gas, and nat-
ural gas prices go up. Those facilities 
converted back to coal. Congratula-
tions. Twenty-three percent more coal 
got burnt. 
It is just, once again, a simple exam-
ple of if you don’t do basic math. It is 
great rhetoric: come behind the micro-
phones, tell us about how much you 
care about the environment, and then 
screw up the economics so much that 
this Nation actually over the next few 
years, greenhouse gas-wise, is about to 
get dirtier. 
You have seen my slides I have 
brought to the floor before on how 
much of our baseload nuclear is about 
to come off line. There will be more 
baseload nuclear about to come off line 
than every bit of photovoltaic that has 
been put into this entire Nation. 
It is math. It is not hard. But we 
don’t seem to reward facts around here. 
What we reward is brilliant virtue sig-
naling, pretty words, and not the final 
outcome. 
Having had a conversation with a 
couple of my friends who are good peo-
ple—they are on the left. They care 
passionately about greenhouse gases. I 
asked them about this natural gas. 
Why do you go so anti-natural gas 
even though it was responsible for the 
vast majority of the reduction of U.S. 
greenhouse gases? 
Well, I don’t like methane. 
Okay, that is fair. May I suggest ac-
tually purchasing a scientific journal 
subscription or two and read because a 
couple of weeks ago some of these arti-
cles came out about a dramatically, 
dramatically less expensive way to 
capture methane? It is functionally 
clay with a slight alteration. I think it 
is called copper oxide, added. It is func-
tionally kitty litter. 
Do you see a theme, Madam Speaker, 
kitties in the Starlink satellite? 
This is functionally an MIT paper 
saying: Hey, we found a really inexpen-
sive way to capture the methane. So if 
you are worried about wellhead bleed- 
off or interconnection bleed-off or 
these things, apparently the model 
even works for ambient capture. 
So instead of going anti-natural gas 
and making everyone’s life more miser-
able and more expensive and then push-
ing manufacturers of ions, electric gen-
eration, back to coal, get your head 
right. Learn the economics and say: 
There is technology out there that we 
can capture the thing you say you are 
worried about very inexpensively, put 
your resources, put the regulatory push 
behind a solution. 
It is a little harder to explain in 
front of your environmentalist town-
hall, but they are facts. There are won-
derful things happening. There are so-
lutions, and solutions that don’t bank-
rupt the American people. It just re-
quires this place stop sounding like it 
is the 1990s policywise. 
Understand, this is one of my biggest 
frustrations around here. We need a 
moment 
of 
honesty. 
The 
policies 
pushed by the administration and my 
brothers and sisters on the left here 
have made America poorer. They have 
made the working men and women 
poor and the working poor poorer. 
Here is the chart. The facts are the 
facts are the facts are the facts. Wages 
have gone up. They were also going up 
dramatically in 2018, 2019, and in the 
very beginning of 2020 with no infla-
tion. 
Our problem right now is the classic 
problem between sort of the Keynesian, 
stimulus, consumption side of econom-
ics and those of us who are more on the 
supply side where you make more prod-
uct and, by doing that, you raise wages 
because you become more efficient. 
You incentivize productivity, and that 
productivity makes it so you can pay 
people more. 
We did just the opposite: push cash 
after cash after cash in society, push 
up inflation, and Americans got poorer. 
You saw the inflation data the last 
couple days, Madam Speaker. So all 
the nice speeches around here about 
Republicans did this, Republicans did 
that, moment of clarity, honesty—and 
it is math—Democrat policies made 
the working poor poorer this last year. 
And it is math. 
What are the two things you do most 
that create the most economic violence 
to the working poor? I really wish I 
had someone here who was willing to 
answer that. It is real simple: Open up 
the border so you create a flood of indi-
viduals who have similar skill sets. My 
drywaller or my gardener or whoever 
these people are, they sell their labors. 
They sell their willingness to work 
their hearts out. When you flood the 
market with people with similar skill 
sets, then you crush their wages and 
then, at the same time, create inflation 
on top of that. 
From an economic standpoint, if you 
want to commit economic violence on 
the poor, do exactly what the left is 
doing right now: open up the borders 
and incentivize inflation. 
A tough part with both of these is 
that it is not a switch you can just 
turn off. The labor availability for 
those who sell their labor, they sell it 
because they didn’t graduate high 
school and didn’t have some of the ben-
efits many of us did, but their wages 
were going up dramatically in 2018, 
2019. In the beginning of 2020, a new re-
gime comes in, the border is opened up, 
we are in the middle of a pandemic, 
there are lots of other things going on, 
and there are numbers out there that 
are really difficult because you have to 
adjust for the amount of cash that was 
pushed into society. But when you 
start to try to normalize that, I think 
when we look back there is going to be 
an understanding of just how brutal 
the policies of opening up the border 
and inflation were to the very people 
we talk about and claim we care about. 
My fear is that brutality economi-
cally looks like it is going to be with 
us for about a decade. It may take 10 
years to squeeze out what we have done 
in our population dynamics and infla-
tion. 
I hope this place is willing—and when 
I talk to some of my Democrat col-
leagues and I walk them through the 
numbers, they just stare at me angrily 
and say, well, we are going to just send 
them more money, not understanding 
that just sets off the cycle even more. 
b 1415 
I threw this one in because I think 
this is actually something, we should 
all just be hopeful. We now have, actu-
ally, an antiviral in the pandemic. We 
have the Pfizer pill. I believe Merck 
has one, but the Pfizer is remarkably 
effective. 
So if you have a home COVID test 
and can actually take an antiviral pill 
at home—you’ve got to take a number 
of them—should you still have a dec-
laration of a pandemic? 
And my reason is, go back to the dis-
cussions we had when this began, when 
the pandemic was declared. This has 
been a miserable thing for everyone to 
go through. But it was always we are 
doing this because our emergency 
rooms are going to be full. We won’t 
have enough ventilators. We don’t have 
therapeutics. 
Well, 
now 
we 
have 
therapeutics 
where you can take it at home. You 
can identify the virus at home. 
Is it time for us to actually step in 
and say, this is something we are going 
to live with? We now have the tools to 
take care of it. If you happen to be in 
one of—where you have a compromised 
immune system, you have other sorts 
of co-morbidities—which I still hate 
that word—yes, there are different pro-
tocols. 
For the vast majority of our Nation, 
this is what we had said a couple of 
years ago; when we get this, we don’t

need to have a declaration of a pan-
demic because you can test at home 
and take a pill at home—well, a num-
ber of pills—and it is an antiviral that 
is incredibly effective. 
Is it time we start having the con-
versation that the declaration of a pan-
demic has outlived its welcome, and we 
start now figuring out we have meth-
ods to help our brothers and sisters 
who are suffering take care of them-
selves and do it from home? They don’t 
have to be in the urgent care centers. 
They don’t have to be in our emer-
gency rooms, our hospitals. This is 
hopeful, and it is here. 
Now, of course, you already saw an 
earlier debate, I believe, between our 
leaders discussing about the Biden ad-
ministration’s failure to properly pre- 
order and those things. I will let others 
who specialize in this have that debate. 
But that should be considered hope-
ful, and it is time, and we are already 
starting to see some movement with 
our brothers and sisters on the left 
starting to understand that this is 
something that we are going to live 
with. 
All right. This one is uncomfortable, 
but it is math. The University of Chi-
cago, four Ph.D. economists were look-
ing at parts of the Build Back Better, 
the social entitlement spending bill, 
and the childcare tax credit. And it 
turns out, because the left insists on 
de-linking the money from getting job 
training, from learning skills, from ac-
tually pursuing work, from taking 
work, economists basically say, once 
again, the left’s great rhetoric of how 
they are going to help working men 
and women who have children, actu-
ally, the data says they are going to 
make them poorer. 
So what we have proposed over and 
over and over to the left is: Okay, if 
you intend to do this, could we put in 
a component that says we need you to 
gain skills? We want you to be part of 
the economy. We want you to be part 
of society. We would like you to work. 
And the reaction—we actually had 
testimony in the Joint Economic Com-
mittee from a leftist Democrat witness 
who basically said, why should people 
have to work? Even a couple of the 
Democrats on the dais, you know, their 
jaws are dropping saying, well, that is 
your witness. 
But then the economists turn to you 
and say, the way you are designing 
your legislation you are hurting work-
ing poor people. You have already done 
it with opening the border. You have 
already done it with inflation. Now you 
are going to make sure it sticks. 
These are just crappy economics. And 
they know better. It is just the politics 
of this craziness right now. 
So let’s actually go on to something 
else that I am hoping will make some 
sense. I did this board specifically for 
someone who will probably never see 
this moment of the speech. So, last 
week, we sent out, you know, a post-
card saying it is about to become a new 
year. Tell us what issues you care 
about. And someone on the left stuck 
one in my mailbox, and the first thing 
said, rich people need to pay more. 
Okay. It would have been nice if this 
individual had actually had the for-
titude to actually give me their name 
or phone number so I could talk to 
them and walk them through the num-
bers. Because you hear the left’s folk-
lore all the time. Well, the tax reform, 
it was for rich people. No, it wasn’t. 
Once again, the data makes it very 
clear, the wealthy, after tax reform, 
are paying a higher percentage of the 
Federal income tax. Understand, one 
more time. The tax code got more pro-
gressive after tax reform. So the math 
is the truth. 
How many times do you hear it? 
I remember last year, I did a presen-
tation, Speaker PELOSI came in on it, 
and then Speaker PELOSI talks in the 
mike and says, 82 percent of the bene-
fits went to the rich people. And even 
the Democrats who were on Ways and 
Means, their jaws are dropping, and 
they are looking down at the floor. 
But this place makes math up. It 
makes crap up because we are about 
virtue signaling, not the facts. The tax 
code we are under today is more pro-
gressive. The rich pay a higher percent-
age of the Federal income tax burden 
than before tax reform. 
But back to the rhetoric and that 
postcard that was in my mailbox say-
ing rich people need to pay more taxes. 
Okay. Maybe the left should stop try-
ing to subsidize them. 
In the left’s Build Back Better, their 
social entitlement spending plan, the 
amount of tax cuts that are function-
ally designed into that, tax credits, 
money transfer—you do understand, 
two-thirds of millionaires get a tax cut 
under the Democrats Build Back Bet-
ter. 
It is, once again, the rhetoric versus 
the math; the virtue signaling versus 
owning a calculator. The analysis says 
the Democrats are, once again—talk a 
great game. The wealthy need to pay 
their fair share. And then they turn 
around and do legislation that actually 
subsidizes the rich. 
A few months ago, we did a presen-
tation here and said, if society, if gov-
ernment really needs another trillion 
dollars—okay, if that is the argument 
coming from the left, stop subsidizing 
the rich. 
We came here with a series of boards 
that showed almost $1.4 trillion over 10 
years—and I am talking the really 
rich, you know, the subsidies that are 
built in. And you could just hear—what 
is the colloquialism—crickets. Because 
if you actually look at the wealthiest 
ZIP codes in the Nation, they are actu-
ally represented by people on the left. 
So just a couple more of these to sort 
of help walk us through. 
We all know the Democrats’ passion 
for State and local tax deductions, and 
it goes up and down in their negotia-
tions. But once again—and to BERNIE 
SANDERS’ credit, he actually told the 
truth on this. It is a tax cut for the 
really, really, really rich, when the 
vast majority of the money goes to 
people making $1 million or more. 
But how many times have we read in 
the political press that a number of our 
Democrat brothers and sisters here 
won’t let the legislation become law 
unless they get these tax cuts for their 
rich taxpayers? 
Okay. Then stop sticking a postcard 
in my mailbox without your name on it 
saying tax the rich more, and being 
part of, obviously, a political party 
that wants to either subsidize the rich, 
hand them tax credits, or hand them 
money. You can’t—it is just fas-
cinating. We work in a place that the 
words don’t match the facts. 
And this was one of my favorite 
things. In Ways and Means, when we 
were grinding through the Democrats’ 
Build Back Better bill, we actually did 
some simple math. Once again, we ac-
tually tried to read part of it. 
So you make $800,000 a year. Your 
family makes $800,000 a year. Built into 
that legislation was $118,000 of tax 
credits for a family making $800,000 a 
year. Buy the right Tesla; buy the bat-
tery wall; buy the right solar panels. 
That is their version of taxing the 
rich, getting the wealthy to pay their 
fair share? Or is it their version of, 
hey, we are going to subsidize the peo-
ple that finance our campaigns. And, 
oh, by the way, these are their con-
stituents. 
So back once again, what is the 
greatest threat to our Republic? Be-
sides all the craziness here and the 
shiny objects and the debate of the day 
that will change tomorrow, the sense 
of indignation, people will walk behind 
these microphones—I am going to 
argue it is the next two boards. This 
year, 77 percent of all the spending is 
mandatory. It is functionally a for-
mula. It is Social Security. It is Medi-
care. Ten percent is defense, 13 percent 
is everything else. 
When you and I go home, and if I am 
in front of a Republican audience, it is 
often, oh, you have got to get rid of 
waste and fraud. You have got to get 
rid of foreign aid. In front of a leftist 
audience, well, it is defense. 
But, no, it is demographics. The vast 
majority of this here is functionally 
demographics. Demographics, getting 
old, is not Republican or Democrat. 
But yet, even last night, you saw 
more legislation being pushed by the 
Democrats that expands these manda-
tory portions, and this is based on a 
CBO report from a year ago. 
But functioning 29 years, you have 
$112 
trillion 
of 
publicly 
borrowed 
money, so that is not borrowing from 
trust funds, and it is on today’s dollars. 
This isn’t inflated dollars in the future. 
That is like 205 percent of projected 
GDP. The majority of it is the short-
falls in Medicare, then Social Security. 
The rest of the budget is in balance. 
If you have made a commitment, you 
are an elected official here and you 
made a commitment that you are 
going to protect Social Security; you

going to protect retirement security; 
start telling the truth about the math. 
And understand, those previous slides I 
showed, that there is a miracle of won-
derful things that are going to cure 
misery, cure diseases. 
Why isn’t that the fixation here, that 
we are going to actually fix the things 
that create this incredible amount of 
debt? Instead, we have a body that 
doesn’t do math, and is rewarded for 
absolutely absurd virtue signaling. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 2022 
No. 9 
Senate 
(Legislative day of Monday, January 10, 2022) 
The Senate met at 10 a.m., on the ex-
piration of the recess, and was called to 
order by the President pro tempore 
(Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Mighty God, our strong fortress, we 
worship You, for Your mercies are new 
each day. 
Lord, You keep us safe, protecting us 
with the shield of Your divine bless-
ings. Continue to bless our lawmakers. 
Give them the wisdom to call for Your 
help and receive Your deliverance from 
trouble. Dispel the shadows that sur-
round them with Your divine light. 
Lord, take hold of their future, doing 
for them, this day and always, more 
than they can ask or imagine. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
REMEMBERING HARRY REID 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I begin my remarks, I see my 
dear friend, the President, sitting 
there—the Senator from Nevada—and I 
am just thinking, last night, as we 
watched Harry Reid leave the Senate 
for the final time: Harry, we miss you, 
but we know you are still here to guide 
us. Thank you. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
defending democracy—something Lead-
er Reid would have been passionate 
about, if he were still with us here, and 
he is telling us that now—over the next 
few days, the U.S. Senate will face a 
critical and unavoidable question: Are 
its Members going to act to protect our 
democracy and protect voting rights or 
will its Members choose the path of ob-
struction, inaction, and side with the 
Big Lie overtaking our precious experi-
ment in self-rule? 
We had two professors come to us 2 
days ago, the authors of ‘‘How Democ-
racies Die,’’ and one of the main ways 
that democracies die is when one polit-
ical party refuses to accept the results 
of an election that was run freely and 
fairly. That is what is happening here. 
They showed how important this is and 
how there is unfortunate historical 
precedent in doing what we did. 
And earlier this week, President 
Biden made that clear. He made clear 
to the Nation—and to all of us who 
serve in the Senate—that the time to 
answer the question about whether al-
lowing the Big Lie, so ruinous to a de-
mocracy, to overtake our precious ex-
periment in self-rule will prevail. 
As the Senate has done many times 
in its history, it must soon act again to 
safeguard democracy from the dangers 
of the present day: the power of dark 
money, voter suppression, and efforts 
to subvert the democratic process from 
the bottom up. 
I commend President Biden for offer-
ing a strong speech, and I look forward 
to having him join Senate Democrats 
later today at our caucus meeting to 
discuss the path forward. 
Yesterday, I shared with my Demo-
cratic colleagues our plan for what the 
next few days are going to look like in 
this Chamber and how I, as majority 
leader, will move to finally begin, at 
last, a floor debate on the voting rights 
legislation. 
Later today, the House of Represent-
atives will pass a message that will in-
clude the language of the two bills Re-
publicans 
have 
filibustered 
for 
months—the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act. 
As permitted under the existing 
rules, we will have the ability to pro-
ceed to the legislation and debate it on 
a simple majority basis—something 
that has been denied to us four times 
in the last several months because Re-
publicans didn’t want to move forward. 
Then the Senate will finally hold a de-
bate on the voting rights legislation 
for the first time in this Congress, and 
every Senator will be faced with a 
choice of whether or not to pass this 
legislation to protect our democracy. 
There has been a lot of gas-lighting 
here on the floor lately from the other 
side about power grabs, about take-
overs, but precious little in terms of 
substance. I have not heard them men-
tion what Republican legislatures are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S196 
January 13, 2022 
doing. That is not the thrust of their 
speech. They say: Oh, it is a power 
grab. Oh, it is a takeover. 
Well, my friends, if there was ever a 
power grab, it is what is happening in 
the State legislatures right now, where 
Republican legislators are taking away 
people’s sacred right to vote and aim-
ing it particularly at certain groups— 
people of color, young people, people in 
urban areas, older people, disabled peo-
ple. 
So let me remind my colleagues what 
these bills actually do. The Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act are balanced, 
effective, and commonsense bills that 
build on the work that this Chamber 
has done in the past to protect democ-
racy, and it was often done with bipar-
tisan votes. The transformation of the 
Republican Party in the era of Donald 
Trump is apparent and nasty, and, 
most importantly, really dangerous to 
our democracy. 
These laws set basic standards for all 
American citizens to vote safely and 
vote securely, while protecting elec-
tions from attempts at subversion. 
What is wrong with that? How is that 
a power grab, to allow people to vote? 
It is the people who should have the 
power, not politicians and State legis-
lative bodies to take it away. 
The bill also fights against the power 
of Big Money that has cascaded into 
our system, and so much of it is now 
being used to try and intimidate legis-
lators, 
Senators, 
and 
Congressmen 
from preserving this right to vote. 
And the bill ends partisan gerry-
mandering. We have all seen situa-
tions—the legislature of Wisconsin, the 
State Assembly, where 53 percent of 
the people voted for Democratic legis-
lators in 2020, but only about a third of 
the seats are Democratic due the se-
vere nature of this gerrymandering. 
And, so importantly, these bills re-
store the critical preclearance provi-
sions that were once part of the Voting 
Rights Act that many of my Repub-
lican colleagues supported in the past, 
which a conservative majority on the 
Supreme 
Court 
shamefully 
gutted 
roughly a decade ago. 
Democrats have tried for months— 
months—to convince our Republican 
colleagues to join us on a bipartisan 
basis to begin debate on these bills, to 
no avail. We presented these reason-
able, commonsense proposals, as I said, 
many of which had been voted on by 
Republicans in the past. We presented 
them on the floor in June, August, Oc-
tober, and November. Each time I 
promised my Republican colleagues 
they would have the opportunity to 
voice their concerns and offer germane 
amendments. I wouldn’t limit the ger-
mane amendments that they wished to 
offer. 
We have lobbied Republicans pri-
vately and tried to engage them in 
both the Senate Rules Committee and 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
Every step of the way—every step of 
the way—we have been met with near 
total resistance. To date, none of our 
efforts have produced any meaningful 
engagement from the other side of the 
aisle. 
But Members of this Chamber were 
elected to debate and to vote, particu-
larly on an issue as vital to the beating 
heart of our democracy as this. 
I have said for months that just be-
cause Republicans have refused to 
work with us to protect voting rights 
does not mean Democrats would stop 
working to move forward on our own. 
The matter is simply too important. It 
is the wellspring of our democracy, the 
right by which all other rights are se-
cured—voting. 
I am reading the biography of Grant, 
by Chernow. The No. 1 thing the south-
ern segregationists, who happened to 
be Democrats at the time, wanted to 
take away from the newly freed slaves 
was the right to vote. They knew that, 
if Black people didn’t have the right to 
vote in the South, they would have no 
power—no power over our laws, no 
power of where resources go, no power 
to decide the directions of the country. 
And that was the No. 1 thing they 
wanted to prevent. 
So it is so vital to keep people’s right 
to vote, particularly when some of the 
laws—too many—are aimed at the peo-
ple of color, reminding us that racism 
is the poison of America still. 
So we will move forward. The path I 
have laid out sets up a process by 
which Senators can finally make clear 
to the American people where they 
stand on protecting our democracy. Re-
publicans will have a chance to show 
where they stand on preserving the 
right of every eligible citizen to cast a 
ballot. 
Republicans will have a chance to 
make clear where they stand on fight-
ing efforts to empower partisan actors 
to subvert the election process and cre-
ate more Big Lies in the future. Repub-
licans will have a chance to make clear 
where they stand on fighting the power 
of dark money, which so many Ameri-
cans oppose—Democrats and Repub-
licans. And Republicans will have a 
chance to show where they stand on 
ending partisan gerrymandering. 
Of course, to ultimately end debate 
and pass anything, we will also need 10 
Republicans to join us, ultimately, on 
cloture. If they don’t, we will be left 
with no choice but to consider changes 
to Senate rules so we can move for-
ward. And changing Senate rules has 
been done many times before in this 
Chamber. This is not the first, second, 
or third time that this is happening. 
All of us must make a choice about 
whether or not we will do our part to 
preserve our democratic Republic this 
day and age. We cannot be satisfied in 
thinking that democracy will win out 
in the end if we are not willing to put 
in the work, strength, and courage to 
defend it. 
Last night, I read the op-ed published 
by President Obama that eloquently 
laid out what really is at stake here. I 
encourage my colleagues to read it if 
they haven’t already. He reminded us 
that democracy is not a given. It is not 
self-executing. But it can indeed sur-
vive and thrive if we are prepared to 
follow in the footsteps of the great 
Americans who did their part to defend 
democracy before us, many of them 
giving their lives. We are now being 
called upon to do our part. 
Madam President, I now ask unani-
mous consent to have printed in the 
RECORD the Obama op-ed, which I will 
bring to the desk shortly. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Jan. 12, 2022] 
FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IN USA TODAY: 
WE NEED TO FOLLOW JOHN LEWIS’ EXAMPLE 
AND FIGHT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY 
[By Former President Barack Obama] 
‘‘The world, and future generations, will be 
watching,’’ Obama writes as he calls on Sen-
ate to ‘‘do the right thing’’ and pass legisla-
tion to protect voting rights. 
When I spoke at John Lewis’ memorial 
service two years ago, I emphasized a truth 
John knew better than just about anyone. 
Our democracy isn’t a given. It isn’t self-exe-
cuting. We, as citizens, have to nurture and 
tend it. We have to work at it. And in that 
task, we have to vigilantly preserve and pro-
tect our most basic tool of self-government, 
which is the right to vote. 
At the time, various state legislators 
across the country had already passed a vari-
ety of laws designed to make voting harder. 
It was an attack on everything John Lewis 
fought for, and a challenge to our most fun-
damental democratic freedoms. 
Since then, things have only gotten worse. 
SLOW UNRAVELING OF BASIC DEMOCRATIC 
PRINCIPLES 
While the American people turned out to 
vote at the highest rate in a century in the 
last presidential election, members of one of 
our two major political parties—spurred on 
by the then-sitting president—denied the re-
sults of that election and spun conspiracy 
theories that drove a violent mob to attack 
our Capitol. 
PROTESTERS ATTACK THE CAPITOL ON JAN. 6 
Although initially rejected by many Re-
publicans, those claims continued to be am-
plified by conservative media outlets, and 
have since been embraced by a sizable por-
tion of Republican voters—not to mention 
GOP elected officials who do, or at least 
should, know better. Those Republican offi-
cials and conservative thought leaders who 
have courageously stood their ground and re-
jected such anti-democratic efforts have 
found themselves ostracized, threatened and 
subjected to primary challenges. 
Meanwhile, state legislators in 49 states 
have introduced more than 400 bills designed 
to suppress votes. Some of these bills we’ve 
seen before: legislation that would discour-
age voters, including racial minorities, low- 
income voters and young people from casting 
a ballot. Others aim to treat certain polling 
locations differently, creating one set of 
rules for voters living in cities and another 
set for people living in more conservative, 
rural areas. 
We’re also seeing more aggressive at-
tempts to gerrymander congressional dis-
tricts. Gerrymandering, which essentially al-
lows politicians to choose their voters in-
stead of the other way around, isn’t new— 
and both parties have engaged in it. 
But what we’re seeing now are far more ag-
gressive and precise efforts on the part of Re-
publican state legislatures to tilt the playing

field in their favor. In states that have ap-
proved new congressional maps, there are 
now 15 fewer competitive districts than there 
were before. Fewer competitive districts in-
creases partisanship, since candidates who 
only have to appeal to primary voters have 
no incentive to compromise or move to the 
center. 
Finally and perhaps most perniciously, 
we’ve seen state legislatures try to assert 
power over core election processes including 
the ability to certify election results. These 
partisan attempts at voter nullification are 
unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times, 
and they represent a profound threat to the 
basic democratic principle that all votes 
should be counted fairly and objectively. 
The good news is that the majority of 
American voters are resistant to this slow 
unraveling of basic democratic institutions 
and electoral mechanisms. But their elected 
representatives have a sacred obligation to 
push back as well—and now is the time to do 
it. 
Now, there are bills in front of the Senate 
that would protect the right to vote, end par-
tisan gerrymandering, and restore crucial 
parts of the Voting Rights Act. Bill sponsors 
have diligently reached out to their Repub-
lican colleagues to obtain their support. 
Sadly, almost every Senate Republican who 
expressed concern about threats to our de-
mocracy in the immediate aftermath of the 
Jan. 6 insurrection has since been cowed into 
silence or reversed their positions. When one 
of the bills in front of the Senate today was 
introduced in November, every Democrat 
supported it. And every Republican but one 
voted against moving it forward. 
Protecting our democracy wasn’t always a 
partisan issue. The Voting Rights Act was 
the result of Democratic and Republican ef-
forts, and both President Reagan and Presi-
dent George W. Bush signed its renewal when 
they were in office. But even if Senate Re-
publicans now refuse to stand up for our de-
mocracy, Democrats should be able to get 
the job done with a simple majority vote. 
There are already 50 Senators who support 
bills to safeguard elections. The only thing 
standing in the way is the filibuster—a Sen-
ate procedure that allows a minority of just 
41 Senators to prevent legislation from being 
brought up for a vote. 
The filibuster has no basis in the Constitu-
tion. Historically, the parliamentary tactic 
was used sparingly—most notably by South-
ern senators to block civil rights legislation 
and prop up Jim Crow. In recent years, the 
filibuster became a routine way for the Sen-
ate minority to block important progress on 
issues supported by the majority of voters. 
But we can’t allow it to be used to block ef-
forts to protect our democracy. That’s why I 
fully support President Joe Biden’s call to 
modify Senate rules as necessary to make 
sure pending voting rights legislation gets 
called for a vote. And every American who 
cares about the survival of our most cher-
ished institutions should support the presi-
dent’s call as well. 
PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 
For generations, Americans of every polit-
ical stripe have taken pride in our status as 
the world’s oldest continuous democracy. We 
have spilled precious blood and spent count-
less treasure in defense of democracy and 
freedom abroad. But as we learned during 
the Jim Crow era, our role as democracy’s 
defender isn’t credible when we violate the 
rights and freedoms of our own citizens. And 
at a time when democracy is under attack on 
every continent, we can’t hope to set an ex-
ample for the world when one of our two 
major parties seems intent on chipping away 
at the foundation of our own democracy. 
No single piece of legislation can guar-
antee that we’ll make progress on every 
challenge we face as a nation. But legislation 
that ensures the right to vote and makes 
sure every vote is properly counted will give 
us a better chance of meeting those chal-
lenges. It’s how we can overcome the grid-
lock and cynicism that’s so prevalent right 
now. It’s how we can stop climate change, 
and reform our broken immigration system, 
and help ensure that our children enjoy an 
economy that works for everyone and not 
just the few. 
Now is the time for all of us to follow John 
Lewis’ example. Now is the time for the U.S. 
Senate to do the right thing. America’s long- 
standing grand experiment in democracy is 
being sorely tested. Future generations are 
counting on us to meet that test. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, as we con-
tinue 
this 
important 
conversation 
about the future of our democracy, I 
ask my Democratic colleagues to con-
sider the following: If the right to vote 
is the cornerstone of our democracy, 
then how can we in good conscience 
allow for a situation in which the Re-
publican Party can debate and pass 
voter suppression laws at the State 
level with only a simple majority vote 
but not allow the United States to do 
the same? 
Let me repeat that. 
If the right to vote is the cornerstone 
of our democracy, then how can we in 
good conscience allow for a situation in 
which the Republican Party can debate 
and pass voter suppression laws at the 
State level with only a simple majority 
vote but not allow the U.S. Senate to 
do the same? 
In the coming days, we will confront 
this sobering question. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
a recent survey asked Americans for 
their view of the most important prob-
lems facing our country. Of course, we 
know 
what 
Washington 
Democrats 
view as their top priority. President 
Biden and Senate Democrats have been 
shouting—actually 
shouting—at 
the 
American people that an evil, racist, 
anti-voting conspiracy will destroy de-
mocracy forever unless Democrats get 
total one-party control of the entire 
government, starting next week. 
But are the American people buying 
any of it? Is this what working families 
want prioritized? So let’s take a look. 
In a recent survey, Gallup asked citi-
zens for their priorities, what they 
thought we ought to be doing. 
Do you know what share of Ameri-
cans said election law? Less than one- 
half of 1 percent—one-half of 1 percent. 
Nobody in this country is buying the 
fake hysteria that democracy will die 
unless Democrats get total control. 
Here is what people do care about: 
The top response at 21 percent was poor 
government leadership. About a year 
into the Biden administration, the 
American people’s single greatest con-
cern is bad leadership. And when you 
dig into the other issues, you can see 
why. 
Some of the next largest concerns 
were either general economic problems 
or inflation and rising costs, in par-
ticular, and no wonder—no wonder. 
New figures, just yesterday, show our 
country continues to experience the 
worst inflation in 40 years—40 years. 
Gas prices are nearly a dollar higher 
than a year ago; grocery prices are up 
6.5 percent; and across the economy, 
inflation has exceeded 5 percent every 
month for 7 straight months. There is 
no working family who has not been 
hurt directly by this. 
Another huge chunk of Americans 
said 
their 
chief 
worry 
is 
the 
coronavirus—certainly 
no 
surprise 
there. A year into the administration 
that promised it would shut down the 
virus, well, what do we have? Record- 
setting new cases. Shortages of testing. 
Shortages of important treatments, in 
part, because of the Biden administra-
tion’s decisions. 
We have reports of multiple States 
potentially limiting or excluding pa-
tients from lifesaving treatments on 
the basis, believe it or not, of their eth-
nicity. 
And still, 2 years into this, notwith-
standing abundant vaccines and a mild-
er variant, we have Big Labor bosses in 
big cities being permitted to lock vul-
nerable kids out of the classroom. 
Oh, and when kids are in the class-
room, the Department of Education 
and the Department of Justice try to 
persecute concerned parents who dare 
ask what their kids are learning. 
So these are just a few examples of 
real problems. These are the kinds of 
places where the American people need 
this dramatically unpopular adminis-
tration to entirely refocus. 
Yesterday, a new poll indicated that 
33 percent of Americans approve of the 
President—33 percent. When he was in-
augurated and pledging to govern for 
all Americans, to heal and unite the 
country, this White House enjoyed im-
pressive approval ratings. But as the 
far left has been handed the reins, the 
support has cratered. 
Now, there is a path forward for my 
Democratic colleagues to respond to 
the country they have so badly dis-
appointed, but it isn’t to try to break 
the Senate and rewrite election laws. It 
is to actually start tracking the issues 
that American families need tackled. 
Now, there are also countless other 
issues which may not make national 
headlines but matter hugely to those 
who are affected. For example, next

January 13, 2022 
week, I will again travel to Western 
Kentucky to visit some of the areas hit 
hardest by last month’s devastating 
tornado outbreak. The national news 
cameras may have left, but families in 
this part of the Commonwealth are 
still trying to pick up the pieces of 
their lives after losing homes, busi-
nesses, and loved ones. 
I am profoundly grateful to everyone 
contributing to the recovery process. 
Our utility workers are taking on the 
herculean task of restoring public serv-
ices. The Kentucky National Guard has 
played a crucial role in distributing 
supplies. Private individuals have do-
nated food, clothing, and blood. 
The Kentucky General Assembly just 
approved a State-funded relief package, 
and Kentucky’s entire Federal delega-
tion joined together to advocate di-
rectly for increased Federal aid. 
This is going to be a long process. It 
will require consistent support on the 
local, State, and Federal levels. Re-
building will take literally months and 
years—not days and weeks. 
Well, I will be with these commu-
nities every step of the way. 
Finally, beyond our shores, there re-
mains no shortage of forces that wish 
to harm America and our interests. 
Senators will vote today on a measure 
to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
We can send a strong warning to Putin 
that he won’t be allowed to use energy 
as a weapon. We can signal strong sup-
port for Eastern and Central European 
partners 
that 
have 
long 
opposed 
Putin’s pipeline. 
Even Democratic Senators who now 
oppose the sanctions they used to sup-
port acknowledge the pipeline is ‘‘a 
tool of malign influence of the Russian 
Federation.’’ 
Really, the Government of Germany 
should have shelved this project itself a 
long time ago. Berlin can still make 
the right call. 
These sanctions, like the prior Nord 
Stream 2 sanctions that had over-
whelming bipartisan support here in 
Congress, are not about driving a 
wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is 
the wedge. That is the whole point. 
That has been Putin’s goal—decoupling 
Ukraine from Europe and making Eu-
rope even more reliant on Russian gas. 
So for Senators who seem more con-
cerned about standing with Berlin than 
with Kiev, this bill includes a waiver. 
We expect President Biden would actu-
ally exercise the waiver. 
But a clear bipartisan message would 
still be sent, just like when 98 Senators 
voted to enact CAATSA in 2017, just 
like when Democrats signed off on the 
previous bill to sanction Nord Stream 2 
in the 2020 NDAA. 
So I hope each of our colleagues will 
support Senator CRUZ’s measure. The 
Senate must show we are focused on 
real-life threats to democracy, to secu-
rity, and to our friends. 
As we speak, Russia is literally pre-
paring to escalate its military assault 
on Ukraine. It has amassed more than 
100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. De-
terring Russian aggression and pre-
paring for the very real threat of a 
major war on the European Continent 
will take far more than these sanc-
tions. 
It will take urgency and seriousness 
from the administration. Time is of the 
essence. Our delays in getting emer-
gency assistance to Ukraine approved 
do not inspire much confidence. 
The administration cannot move at 
the speed of bureaucracy. That won’t 
cut it. Humanitarian and military sup-
port to Ukraine cannot wait. Rein-
forcing American and NATO positions 
in Europe cannot wait. 
We must not pull our punches out of 
some fear of provoking Putin. What 
will encourage Putin is if he senses 
American weakness. Ukraine and our 
eastern flank NATO allies deserve our 
support. 
They are on the frontlines of a much 
broader war that Russia and China are 
conducting 
against 
the 
democratic 
international order itself. This order 
helps America. It benefits our national 
interests, and it benefits our allies, but 
it is not going to enforce itself. It will 
not defend itself. And our allies will 
not act if America fails to lead. 
Our Nation’s contest with China and 
Russia is the biggest challenge we face. 
It will entail significant risks and per-
haps, God forbid, serious sacrifice. 
Meeting these challenges and pre-
venting the worst will take the kind of 
unity and bipartisanship that Presi-
dent Biden promised—not the out-
rageous—outrageous—and divisive par-
tisanship he has embraced.

PROTECTING EUROPE’S ENERGY 
SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to consideration of S. 3436, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S.3436) to require the imposition of 
sanctions with respect to entities responsible 
for the planning, construction, or operation 
of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and their cor-
porate officers and to apply congressional re-
view under the Countering America’s Adver-
saries Through Sanctions Act to the removal 
of sanctions relating to Nord Stream 2, and 
for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
S. 3436 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to speak in op-
position to S. 3436, which is the Nord 
Stream 2’s sanctions bill sponsored by 
Senator CRUZ. 
I certainly share the concerns that 
have been expressed just a few minutes 
ago by Senator MCCONNELL about the 
threat that Russia poses to Ukraine 
and to Eastern Europe and the role 
that Nord Stream 2 plays in that crit-
ical issue. 
I have been a strong and long-
standing opponent of Nord Stream 2. I 
believe now what I believed at the time 
that I originally cosponsored the Nord 
Stream 2 sanctions bill with Senator 
CRUZ; that the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline 
is a long-term threat to the energy se-
curity of Europe. 
But right now we are in a different 
place on this, and while Senator CRUZ 
and I worked together on sanctions leg-
islation to stop this pipeline, my dis-
agreement now with Senator CRUZ is in 
his approach to what we need to do to 
address what is right now a much more 
serious threat to Europe, to NATO, to 
the transatlantic alliance, and that is 
Russia’s threat against Ukraine. 
And what Senator CRUZ’s bill would 
do is not stop Nord Stream 2; it would 
undermine the current diplomatic situ-
ation that is absolutely critical if we 
are going to respond to the Russian 
threat. 
His bill is a vote—supporting his bill 
would be a vote to compromise the 
transatlantic community. It is a vote 
that breaks the message of bipartisan 
support in the face of Russian aggres-
sion and, furthermore, not just bipar-
tisan support but allied support with 
the United States and Germany and 
Western Europe against the threat that 
Russia poses to Ukraine and really to 
Eastern Germany if they take this ac-
tion. 
The dynamics on Nord Stream 2 have 
changed since Senator CRUZ
and I 
fought for the passage of legislation to 
prevent the completion of that pipe-
line. At the time, we worked together 
to provide the Trump administration 
with critical tools to sanction this 
pipeline, and we did that because there 
were some members of the Trump ad-
ministration who came to us and said: 
We need this legislation because the 
administration has not acted. 
And the fact is, 95 percent of the con-
struction of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline 
was completed during the Trump years. 
Unfortunately, the Trump administra-
tion, even after we passed that sanc-
tions legislation, sat on those sanc-
tions. 
They waited until literally the last 
day of the Trump administration to 
sanction just one entity, just one enti-
ty in 4 years. And so what we saw is 
what I just said; that 95 percent of that 
pipeline was completed during the 
Trump years. 
Now, we are in a very different situa-
tion right now, unfortunately, because 
we are in a situation where Russia is 
threatening Ukraine, and we need to 
work closely with our European allies 
to present a united front against Rus-
sia. 
We have strengthened our relation-
ship with our German allies. The Biden 
administration has restored a diplo-
macy-first foreign policy, which seeks

to advance American policy interests 
through dialogue and not through 
threats. 
There is a new German coalition gov-
ernment in place that we are now en-
gaging with. It is a government that 
appears to be more skeptical about the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. They have 
paused certification of the pipeline and 
stalled its operation until at least later 
this year, and the new government has 
indicated that this pipeline is not just 
an economic project. 
So it is very clear that the dynamics 
have changed, and when the dynamics 
change on the ground, then our ap-
proach and our foreign policy should 
reflect those changes. We can’t look at 
this legislation in isolation. 
This legislation that Senator CRUZ is 
proposing that we are going to be vot-
ing on today is coming at a time when 
the administration is exhausting every 
single 
diplomatic 
avenue 
to 
deter 
Putin from further violating Ukraine’s 
territorial integrity. 
Russia 
has 
amassed 
over 
100,000 
troops on Ukraine’s border, and, of 
course, the next month or so is really 
going to be critical in changing Putin’s 
calculation that any invasion would 
come with a hefty price. 
Nord Stream 2 right now presents a 
potential incentive for Putin to use 
against our European partners, but it 
is also leverage. It is leverage that the 
West can use at a pivotal moment as 
Russia is thinking about—Vladimir 
Putin is thinking about what he is 
going to do in Ukraine. 
So I believe we need to stop this pipe-
line long term, and there may be a 
time in the future when another 
change in our approach on the pipeline 
may be necessary. As we know, that 
happens with foreign policy. We don’t 
live in a static world; it is dynamic, 
and it demands that we adopt our re-
sponses. 
I have joined Senator MENENDEZ and 
38 Democrats in introducing the De-
fending Ukraine Sovereignty Act of 
2022, legislation that does reflect the 
reality on the ground, that would im-
pose swift and crippling sanctions on 
Russia’s economy if Putin decides to 
invade. It would provide critical addi-
tional military support to our Ukrain-
ian allies, and it would strengthen sup-
port to our Eastern European allies in 
the face of Putin’s attempt to look 
backward, not forward. 
We are not going to give Vladimir 
Putin and Russia the ability to veto 
who joins NATO. We saw that very 
clearly at the session yesterday with 
Russian and NATO officials. Russia 
didn’t like it because they didn’t get 
the answer they wanted, which was a 
veto over who should be able to join 
NATO. 
We are going to continue to take a 
strong stand with our allies in opposi-
tion to what Russia is doing, but we 
can’t use yesterday’s solutions to help 
us solve today’s problems. The imme-
diate threat that we are facing right 
now is the threat of a Russian invasion 
of Ukraine, and we need to do every-
thing possible, work as closely as pos-
sible, show no daylight with our allies 
in standing up to that threat. Unfortu-
nately, what Senator CRUZ is proposing 
with the Nord Stream 2 sanctions legis-
lation would do exactly that. It would 
drive a wedge between us and our al-
lies, particularly between the United 
States and Germany, at a time that we 
cannot afford it. 
So I intend to vote against this legis-
lation and support Senator MENENDEZ’s 
legislation that will give us the tools 
we need to continue to address poten-
tial Russian aggression. 
I yield the floor and look forward to 
hearing Senator MURPHY’s comments 
because I know he shares the same con-
cerns that I am expressing. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. 
MURPHY. 
Madam 
President, 
first and foremost, let me thank Sen-
ator SHAHEEN. She has been a leader in 
the Senate and in our caucus on raising 
alarms about the danger of Nord 
Stream 2 to European security and 
Ukrainian security. I have been so glad 
to work with her over these past sev-
eral years, and I am here on the floor 
to join her in our strong opposition to 
the legislation that is pending on the 
floor as we speak. 
If this bill passes, it won’t make the 
Nord Stream Pipeline any less likely. 
It won’t stop Russia from invading 
Ukraine. In fact, it will do the exact 
opposite. It will make the completion 
of Nord Stream more likely, and it will 
be a gift to Russia, dividing us from 
our European allies right at the mo-
ment when we need to be in solidarity 
with them in order to deter Russian ag-
gression. 
I will try not to repeat too much of 
what Senator SHAHEEN has said, but let 
me just underscore the points she has 
made. 
First, the sanctions in this bill are, 
unfortunately, pretty feckless. They 
are feckless because they can be un-
done easily, within 30 to 60 days, by the 
Russian Government. 
The reality is, if we don’t convince 
our European partners to stop moving 
forward with this project, there is no 
amount of U.S. sanction that can be ef-
fective here. What we know is that 
even if you were to sanction this Ger-
man-Swiss company, the German board 
of directors, in a matter of days, 
weeks, maybe a few months, the Rus-
sians could reengineer the financing 
and the administration of the project 
to keep it going. 
Even more interesting to me is what 
Senator MCCONNELL just said. Senator 
MCCONNELL just came to floor and said 
that while he supports Senator CRUZ’s 
proposal, he expects that the Biden ad-
ministration will waive the sanctions. 
So then why are we engaging in this in 
the first place if Republicans are going 
to support the waiving of the sanc-
tions? Because the sanctions would in-
terrupt our negotiations with Ger-
many, why pass the bill in the first 
place? 
So, apparently, many Republicans 
are supporting the Cruz bill but then 
are going to be asking the Biden ad-
ministration to not implement it. That 
doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense. 
The primary impact of this bill, as 
Senator SHAHEEN explained, is to di-
vide us from Germany. Why is that? 
Because we know that the only way to 
stop Nord Stream 2 is by convincing 
the Germans and other Europeans to 
stop the project. 
Now, we have, for the first time since 
we began talking to the Germans about 
this, convinced them to press pause— 
the first time the German Government 
has decided to press pause through 
their regulatory agencies. They have 
stopped the certification of the pipe-
line, which, by the way, is built. It was 
95 percent built when President Trump 
left office. He let it be constructed—95 
percent built. It is now 100 percent 
built. 
But the Germans have, because of 
American diplomacy and because of 
the threat of invasion of Ukraine from 
Russia, pressed pause on this project. 
It can’t start until the summer or the 
fall, and, frankly, that time allows us 
to continue to engage with the Ger-
mans and others to try to convince 
them that this project is not in their 
interest. 
So think about this from the German 
perspective. They finally said yes to 
the United States, and the minute they 
say yes is the minute the U.S. Senate 
decides to sanction German citizens. 
That is bad diplomacy. It is just bad di-
plomacy. It is a moment at which we 
have to be in lockstep with our Euro-
pean partners. We need to be sending a 
message to Vladimir Putin that the 
United States and Europe are together 
and that we are going to deliver a 
crushing package of sanctions if you 
enter Ukraine any further. 
This would be a gift to Vladimir 
Putin because it is a signal of division 
at a moment when we need to be stand-
ing together. 
Senator MENENDEZ has the right ap-
proach. Senator MENENDEZ
has pro-
posed a bill which I think can draw 
support from 90 percent of this body 
that enacts a set of sanctions on Russia 
if Russia moves any farther into 
Ukraine beyond where they are already 
in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. That 
sends the right signal. That is an effec-
tive message of consequence rather 
than this proposal, which apparently is 
a set of sanctions Republicans are 
going to ask to be waived and divides 
us from our partners at a moment 
when we need to be together. 
Lastly, I want to address one par-
ticular point that I have heard Senator 
CRUZ make over and over and over 
again in defense of his proposal. 
Senator CRUZ says that the construc-
tion of the pipeline stopped when Con-
gress passed the Nord Stream sanctions 
and didn’t begin again until Joe Biden 
became President. I have seen that re-
peated in the press, and it just isn’t 
true.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S200 
January 13, 2022 
One company that was laying the 
pipeline backed out of the project when 
the 2019 sanctions bill was passed, but 
then guess what happened. Russia 
started retrofitting other ships to fin-
ish the job, and the minute they were 
permitted, construction began again— 
not when Joe Biden was President; 
when Donald Trump was President. 
The ships were ready in May of 2020, 
before Joe Biden was even nominated, 
and they started work a few months 
later, as soon as the Danish Govern-
ment permitted them. 
Now, Senator SHAHEEN and Senator 
CRUZ had passed a sanctions bill with 
all of our support at the end of 2019. 
During all of 2020, while the Russians 
were retrofitting these ships, while 
they were sending them back to Danish 
waters, while the permitting process 
was happening, Donald Trump didn’t 
enact one sanction that was permitted 
by Congress. 
Congress passed a law at the end of 
2019. In all of 2020, Donald Trump didn’t 
enact a single sanction. This was the 
critical moment. This was the time in 
which the meat of the pipeline was 
being built. President Trump did noth-
ing, and he paid no consequence for it. 
Do you know why? Because in 2020, 
Senator CRUZ didn’t hold up any of 
Donald 
Trump’s 
State 
Department 
nominees when Trump was refusing to 
implement sanctions, when the Rus-
sians sent ships that started showing 
up to restart construction, not even 
when construction restarted in the fall 
of 2020—nope. During this time, all of 
Trump’s State Department nominees 
sailed through without a single Repub-
lican objection or blockade. 
On Trump’s last day in office, his last 
day, literally as he was packing up the 
Oval Office, January 19, he sanctioned 
one ship and the company that owned 
the ship—essentially a signal of how 
little he cared. On the day he was leav-
ing, he sanctioned one ship and the 
company that owned the ship, but by 
this time, 95 percent of the pipeline 
was complete. It was too late. Then he 
begrudgingly hands over the keys to 
the Oval Office to Joe Biden and leaves 
the incoming President with a mess—a 
pipeline 95 percent built that Donald 
Trump could have stopped if he had 
used the sanctions he was given. 
So you can understand why some of 
us wonder what the motivation is be-
hind Senator CRUZ’s extraordinary tac-
tics now when the pipeline is already 
built. It seems that the difference be-
tween 2020 and 2021 is essentially that 
now there is a Democrat in the White 
House. 
This bill isn’t going to help Ukraine. 
It is designed to hurt the President of 
the 
United 
States. 
Unfortunately, 
some—not all—not all but some of our 
Republican colleagues here have con-
sistently put their desire to politically 
harm President Biden ahead of their 
desire to protect the Nation, holding 
up 
the 
confirmation 
of 
President 
Biden’s nominees. It doesn’t help the 
security of the Nation; it just increases 
the chances that the United States 
won’t have the personnel on hand to 
deal with a crisis somewhere around 
the world when it develops and that 
that failure may hurt Joe Biden’s ap-
proval rating. Unfortunately, I think 
that is what is going on here. Unfortu-
nately, I think that is what is going on 
here, and I hope that my colleagues see 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The Senator from New Hamp-
shire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Would my colleague 
yield for a question? 
Mr. MURPHY. I would. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Senator MURPHY, I 
am really pleased—sadly pleased, but I 
think it is really appropriate that you 
brought up the issue about holding 
State Department nominees, because 
one of the things that have been unfor-
tunate about Senator CRUZ’s approach 
to Nord Stream 2 in recent weeks has 
not just been his holding up of nomi-
nees but has been his suggestion that 
the change in response on my part and 
on others’ who oppose Nord Stream 2 
has been partisan. 
But, as you point out, during all of 
the Trump administration, Senator 
CRUZ did not hold one nominee because 
of Nord Stream 2. Is that your under-
standing? 
Mr. MURPHY. That is my under-
standing. My understanding is that 
there may have been private advocacy 
or public speeches given but that there 
certainly wasn’t the tactic used that 
had been used during 2020, which is ex-
traordinary, the holding of all nomi-
nees. 
I think I would add to that that 
Democratic Senators have not used 
that tactic. We had huge disagreements 
with President Trump’s policy, includ-
ing his failure to use sanctions that 
were given to him by Congress to stop 
the pipeline at the moment when those 
sanctions would have been most effec-
tive, but we didn’t block all of Presi-
dent Trump’s Ambassadors and State 
Department 
personnel 
because 
we 
thought that it was better to have 
those people on hand, working to pro-
tect U.S. interests, than it was to have 
those positions vacant. 
That is the case we have been trying 
to make on this floor, that if you real-
ly care about helping Ukraine, why did 
Senator CRUZ spend all of 2020 blocking 
the Ambassadors and State Depart-
ment personnel whose job it would 
have been to help Ukraine? 
No one has been more engaged on 
this question and this fight than you 
have, Senator SHAHEEN. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Well, I think the 
other important point that we both 
made is the fact that what stopped 
policies and the pipeline when the first 
sanctions bill was passed was the 
threat of sanctions; it wasn’t actually 
implementing those sanctions. In fact, 
it was then Russia’s ability to come 
back in, retrofit ships, and do the work 
themselves, Gazprom and Russia. Rus-
sian ships did the work themselves, and 
throughout the last year of the Trump 
administration, they refused to take 
any action to address that. In fact, I 
remember being in a meeting—I can’t 
remember if you were in that meeting 
or not—with Senator CRUZ and some of 
our Republican colleagues and a mem-
ber of the administration urging us to 
pass another sanctions bill because the 
administration had not acted. 
So I think it is really important, as 
you say, to point out that 95 percent of 
that pipeline was done under the pre-
vious administration when Senator 
CRUZ and our colleagues who would 
like to stop the pipeline had the oppor-
tunity to hold up his nominees to raise 
those concerns, and that did not hap-
pen. That puts us at a disadvantage 
today as we look at the threat of Nord 
Stream. Would you agree with that? 
Mr. MURPHY. I would. 
If you don’t mind, Senator SHAHEEN, 
I will just go through the timeline once 
again because I think it is important. 
In December of 2019, Congress passed 
the sanctions bill that you and Senator 
CRUZ championed. That stops Allseas, 
the 
private 
company, 
from 
con-
structing the pipeline. 
They pull back, but immediately 
Russia starts retrofitting their own 
ships, and we knew it. We saw it. This 
wasn’t secret. That happens from the 
beginning of 2020, and by May of 2020, 
those ships are on their way. 
From May until October, they are 
caught up in permitting, but it is just 
a matter of time. Everybody knows 
those ships are eventually going to 
start laying down pipe. 
By October of 2020, before Joe Biden 
is elected President, those ships are 
back doing construction. 
In October, November, December, all 
throughout the end of 2020, those ships 
are back rebuilding the pipeline, such 
that on January 19, the last day of 
Trump’s Presidency, 95 percent of the 
pipeline—somewhere around 95 percent 
of the pipeline—is done. 
Then literally walking out the door, 
Donald Trump lays down a sanction on 
one company and one ship that the 
company owns. 
All through 2020, there was no block-
ade of State Department nominees, no 
grinding to a halt of Senate nomina-
tions business to try to prompt the 
President to change his mind. All of 
that magically starts happening when 
Joe Biden is President, when 95 percent 
of the pipeline is done. 
I hope, Senator SHAHEEN—and I will 
let you wrap up—I hope that we can 
find a way to get on the same page here 
because we have been for much of the 
last several years, and you have led 
that effort. 
I think Senator MENENDEZ’s legisla-
tion, which is all about the right set of 
incentives and disincentives for Rus-
sian behavior, is perhaps the means 
that we can sort of elevate this above 
the question of who is President and 
get back to fighting for the interests of 
our Nation and the interests of our 
partners in Ukraine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S201 
January 13, 2022 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Senator 
MURPHY. I couldn’t have said anything 
better. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, just a 
quick observation or two about what 
my colleagues from New Hampshire 
and Connecticut were just speaking to, 
and that is the issue of the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. I intend to talk 
about another subject, but as I was lis-
tening to their dialogue on that sub-
ject, there were a couple of things that 
I thought were important to respond 
to. 
They had indicated that there is a 
bill offered by Senator MENENDEZ on 
their side of the aisle that they 
thought would get 90-plus votes here in 
the U.S. Senate. I would say to my col-
leagues on the Democratic side that 
Senator CRUZ, as he was advocating for 
a vote on his amendment, offered that 
up. He offered up a vote on Menendez 
and a vote on his amendment to 
Menendez, and that was turned down 
by the Democrat leadership. So that 
was put forward as an offer by the Sen-
ator from Texas, Senator CRUZ. 
Just to also make the point—this 
isn’t something that is a new issue for 
him. He has been advocating on the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline for years. In 
fact, there were sanctions put in place 
under 
the 
previous 
administration, 
which I think had been quite effective. 
With respect to holding State De-
partment nominees, sometimes around 
here, you have to get people’s atten-
tion in order to get a vote on some-
thing. I mean, he didn’t have to hold 
nominees in the last administration be-
cause they allowed for a vote. In this 
administration, that has not been the 
case. He has been trying for literally 
weeks and months. I happened to be 
here in the wee hours of the morning a 
few weeks ago on a Friday evening 
when this was being discussed, and we 
were waiting for some agreement be-
tween him and the Democrat leader-
ship about giving him a vote on this 
amendment. Ultimately, when he got 
the vote on his amendment, he turned 
loose 40-some State Department nomi-
nees. 
So I think he has in this case played 
fairly, played by the rules in the Sen-
ate, and exercised the leverage he has 
as a U.S. Senator to ensure that he got 
a vote on an issue that is critically im-
portant, not only to him and I would 
say to this entire body but to our coun-
try and certainly to our allies in that 
region. 
There is one final point I will make. 
Everybody, as they were talking about 
this, was saying: Wow, you know, this 
is—all of a sudden, this issue has be-
come a relevant one. 
Well, it has always been a relevant 
one. Defending and supporting people 
in Ukraine and making sure they have 
a democratic government that allows 
for self-rule is something that I think 
all of us in this country want to see 
happen. 
But I think one of the reasons it has 
come to a head is because last year— 
not last year but 2 years ago, the pre-
vious 
administration—the 
Senators 
from New Hampshire and Connecticut 
were going after Senator CRUZ
and 
other Republicans for not paying at-
tention to this issue a long time ago. 
We have been paying attention to it 
for a long time, but one thing that has 
intensified that attention is the fact 
that the Russians now have tens of 
thousands of troops on Ukraine’s bor-
der. That is a new issue and an issue 
that I think demands the attention of 
this body, our country, our govern-
ment, our State Department, and the 
American 
military, 
in 
conjunction 
with our allies in that region. 
This is a critical time. It is very im-
portant that a strong message be sent. 
I am not sure why you would wait until 
after the Russians cross the border and 
occupy Ukraine before you do some-
thing that might deter that kind of bad 
behavior. 
I think the reason they have amassed 
the troops they have on the Ukraine 
border is because they perceive the 
change of administration, perhaps a 
different view, and, in fact, I think 
that buildup started in the spring of 
2021 under this administration. 
So just to make the point that the 
vote we will have this afternoon on 
Senator 
CRUZ’s 
proposal 
on 
Nord 
Stream 2 has been a long time in the 
making—he has, I think, consistently 
worked this issue, advocated for this 
issue in a way that any Senator who is 
trying to get a vote around here would. 
I think with respect to why this issue 
is now particularly relevant in light of 
our national security interests is the 
fact that the Russians do have literally 
tens of thousands of troops sitting on 
Ukraine’s border at a time when the 
world is a very dangerous place, and 
that region in particular faces consid-
erable peril because of the neighbor-
hood in which they live. 
So I would hope that this afternoon 
when this Nord Stream 2 vote comes 
up, that it will enjoy broad bipartisan 
support recognizing the value and im-
portance of the message it sends. 
Also, I might add, because it was also 
pointed out by the two Senators who 
were just here, that this is something 
that the Ukrainian Government is ask-
ing us to do. They suggested this was 
something that isn’t desired or wanted, 
and it, in fact, is. Many of us partici-
pated in a conference call on Christmas 
Eve with President Zelensky in which 
he voiced support for this. I think he 
and his country, his government, and 
his people realize how important it is 
that a message be sent to their neigh-
bors and that the American Govern-
ment, in concert with our allies in this 
region, send a very strong statement 
with respect to that particular issue. 
So I hope that we get a good, strong 
vote this afternoon and that it won’t be 
a party-line vote. It is at 60, meaning it 
will take some Democrats to vote with 
Republicans. But I can’t think of a 
time when the stakes have been higher 
for the people of Ukraine or, frankly, 
for that matter, for that region in its 
entirety. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, I want to shift gears 
now, if I might. Yesterday, we learned 
that in December, inflation hit its 
highest level in 40 years—40 years. In-
flation reached 7 percent in December, 
the seventh straight month that infla-
tion has been over 5 percent. Today, we 
discovered that year-over-year infla-
tion for domestically produced goods 
increased even more, by a massive 9.7 
percent. 
Americans are struggling under steep 
increases in grocery prices, fuel prices, 
utility prices, and the list goes on. De-
spite wage increases in 2021, American 
families experienced a de facto pay cut, 
with their purchasing power shrinking 
thanks to inflation, and there is appar-
ently no end in sight. 
Given the real economic harm that 
American families are suffering as a re-
sult of this crisis, you would think the 
issue would be front and center here in 
Washington for Democrats, but you 
would be wrong. In fact, a lot of the 
time, inflation doesn’t even seem to 
exist on Democrats’ radar. Democrats 
can’t be bothered to pay attention to a 
real crisis with real economic con-
sequences for American families be-
cause they are too focused on their 
manufactured voting rights crisis. 
Earlier this week, President Biden 
traveled to Georgia, which has become 
the Democrats’ poster child for the 
supposed assault on voting rights, to 
deliver a speech to gin up support for 
the Democrats’ partisan election bill, 
and what a speech it was. 
In the course of his overwrought and 
bombastic remarks, the President, who 
once vowed to bring Americans to-
gether, managed to imply that half the 
country is racist. Never one to let the 
truth get in the way of a good story, he 
continued his bizarre habit of falsely 
claiming that he had been arrested in 
various situations. He laid out, per-
haps, the weakest case for a voting 
rights crisis that you can imagine. 
The President, of course, used Geor-
gia’s thoroughly mainstream 2021 elec-
tion law as his main example. Here is 
what he had to say. Here is what the 
voting rights crisis amounts to: 
First, according to the President, 
Georgia is making it harder to vote by 
mail. Now, I am guessing he might be 
referring to the provision of the Geor-
gia law that asks voters to write in 
their driver’s license numbers on their 
absentee ballots. Given that almost 
every American in this country has a 
driver’s license or some form of photo

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S202 
January 13, 2022 
ID, I have got to say that it doesn’t 
seem like an unduly burdensome re-
quirement. After all, New York City 
and Washington, DC, are now requiring 
you to present a photo ID and proof 
that you have been vaccinated before 
you can enter any restaurant or public 
place, and liberals seem OK with that, 
but, 
apparently, 
to the President, 
Georgia’s measure is Jim Crow 2.0. 
The President continues by accusing 
Georgia of limiting drop boxes. Ballot 
drop boxes have become a bizarre fixa-
tion of Democrats engaged in trying to 
persuade Americans that the right to 
vote is under attack. The truth is that 
Georgia didn’t even use drop boxes 
until the 2020 election and that Geor-
gia’s new election law now requires at 
least one drop box in each county is 
hardly a criminal attempt to restrict 
drop boxes. But let’s be honest here. 
Even if Georgia decided to eliminate 
drop boxes entirely and return to its 
pre-2020 status quo, Georgians would 
still have ample opportunities to vote. 
Georgia’s new law mandates a min-
imum of 17 days of early voting—17 
days—and Georgia provides for no-ex-
cuse absentee voting, which means any 
Georgia citizen can request an absentee 
ballot for any reason whatsoever. That, 
of course, is a far more generous voting 
policy than those offered by the Presi-
dent or the Senate Democrat leader’s 
home States. The President’s home 
State of Delaware doesn’t offer no-ex-
cuse absentee voting, and it is just 
starting to offer early voting this 
year—remember, Georgia with 17 days 
early voting, no-excuse absentee vot-
ing. Similarly, the Democrat leader’s 
home State, Senator SCHUMER’s home 
State of New York, offers just 9 days of 
early voting in contrast to Georgia’s 
17, and New York—the State of New 
York—on their ballot, recently re-
jected a ballot measure to allow no-ex-
cuse absentee voting. 
So no-excuse absentee voting is not 
allowed in New York, but it is allowed 
in Georgia, with 9 days early voting in 
New York and 17 in Georgia. Yet, some-
how, the President hasn’t yet visited 
Delaware or New York to accuse them 
of making it difficult for citizens to 
vote. I will believe in Democrats’ sup-
posed commitment to protecting the 
vote when I see the Senate majority 
leader come to the floor and excoriate 
New Yorkers for attacking voting 
rights. 
Continuing on with President Biden’s 
speech, we come to, perhaps, the most 
ridiculous example the President and 
Democrats have used in their attempt 
to convince Americans that voting 
rights are under assault, and here I am 
going to quote directly from the Presi-
dent’s speech: 
[T]he new Georgia law actually makes it 
illegal—think of this—I mean, it’s 2020, and 
now ’22, going into that election—it makes it 
illegal to bring your neighbors, your fellow 
voters food or water while they wait in line 
to vote. . . . I mean, think about it. That’s 
not America. That’s what it looks like when 
they suppress the right to vote. 
That is what it looks like when they 
suppress the right to vote? Really? 
I mean, I have to give President 
Biden credit for delivering that line 
with a straight face because that is 
pretty much the most absurd claim 
Democrats have made in the course of 
this debate. The President, of course, is 
referring to the provision of Georgia’s 
election law that prohibits individuals 
or organizations from giving food or 
drinks to voters within 150 feet of a 
polling place. 
Now, just for purposes, again, of com-
paring and contrasting, the Democrat 
leader’s home State of New York—Sen-
ator SCHUMER’s home State of New 
York—has a similar provision pre-
venting voters in line from being given 
anything, including food and water, 
whose retail value is in excess of $1. 
This is the State of New York—the 
State of New York. But people are 
blowing a gasket over this provision in 
Georgia law—the very provision the 
State of New York has in law today. I 
would argue, in most States, you can’t 
go within a certain number of feet of a 
voting place if you are a political oper-
ative or a political organization. I 
mean, that is true in our State, and I 
am sure it is true in a lot of States 
around the country. The aim of those 
laws, of course, is to prevent partisan 
political organizations or candidates 
from exerting improper pressure on 
voters in line. 
Now, nothing in Georgia’s law pre-
vents partisan political organizations 
from setting up food trucks or lunch 
stations outside of the 150-foot radius 
and feeding voters to their hearts con-
tent—150 feet. That is 50 yards. Of 
course, Georgia’s law explicitly allows 
nonpartisan poll workers to make 
water available to voters. An election 
worker, somebody who is involved with 
the actual vote itself, can deliver water 
to voters if they are waiting in line. It 
just prevents political operatives and 
political 
organizations 
from 
doing 
that—a law that, again, is consistent 
with laws throughout the country, in-
cluding—including—the State of New 
York. Yet I suppose it is typical of 
nanny-state Democrats to think Amer-
icans are incapable of packing them-
selves a snack. 
I am pretty sure—pretty sure—I have 
never seen a weaker case for a crisis. 
Take a look at Democrats’ supposed 
evidence, and their case crumbles to 
dust, which, of course, raises the ques-
tion of what is behind Democrats’ man-
ufactured crisis. Unfortunately, I think 
we know the answer. The Democrats 
have manufactured the supposed voting 
rights crisis in the hopes of forcing 
through election legislation that they 
hope will give them an advantage in fu-
ture elections. More than one Demo-
crat has openly admitted that Demo-
crats want to pass a Federal election 
takeover because they think it will 
help their party win elections. 
I don’t blame Democrats for running 
scared. Between their inflation crisis, 
their border crisis, the President’s 
humiliating, disastrous retreat from 
Afghanistan, the November election re-
sults in Virginia, and the fact that just 
one-third of the American people ap-
prove of the job the President is doing, 
the Democrats have reason to be scared 
about their 2022 electoral prospects. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. President, instead of addressing 
the inflation crisis they helped to cre-
ate or, perhaps, moving their agenda 
from the far left and closer to the cen-
ter, the Democrat leaders have decided 
that the solution to improving their 
electoral chances is to pass a partisan 
Federal takeover of election law and to 
break the Senate rules to do it. Appar-
ently, they don’t care what damage 
they do to the Senate and the country 
in the process. If Democrat leaders 
have their way, the longstanding pro-
tections for the minority in the Senate 
and the millions upon millions of 
Americans the Senate minority rep-
resents will be swept away in the name 
of, 
perhaps, 
improving 
Democrats’ 
electoral prospects. 
Although, I have to say, in the Wash-
ington Post Fact Checker about the 
Georgia law, which, by the way, gave 
the President four Pinocchios—four 
Pinocchios, which is pretty much the 
biggest whopper you can get—for his 
statements last year about this Geor-
gia election law, they went on to say 
that the analysts who have looked at 
this—a lot of the analysis has been 
done by so-called election experts— 
think that it will expand—expand—the 
opportunity for people in Georgia to 
vote. 
All of this is disheartening, to say 
the least, because I think we all know 
that, in the end, if you are going to 
blow up the Senate rules, that that has 
consequences that go on for a very, 
very long time. 
There are Democrats in this Chamber 
today who still express, I think, regret 
for what happened in 2013, with respect 
to the executive calendar—which deals 
with executive branch nominees and 
judicial branch nominees, judges—be-
cause it led, in 2017, to the Republicans 
retaliating, following suit, with Su-
preme Court Justices. 
I don’t think you can—assume for a 
minute that, at some point, this flips. 
If Democrats blow up the rules to do 
this and create, I have to say, a manu-
factured crisis in order to do it, then 
you are not going to be able to blame 
Republicans, because once the rules are 
gone, the rules are gone. Then we be-
come the House of Representatives, a 
total majoritarian body with longer 
terms. 
That is not what the Founders in-
tended. This place is here for a reason. 
It is here to represent the rights of the 
minority, the people who didn’t win 
the vote, the people who might be in 
the minority party, who ought to have 
some say and some voice in the laws 
that are made here and the policies 
that are made here that are going to 
affect them and their families. I am 
hopeful that there are still some Demo-
crats with doubts about this course of 
action, enough, perhaps, to block their 
leadership’s partisan push.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S203 
January 13, 2022 
In his inaugural address, the Presi-
dent of the United States vowed to be 
a President for all Americans. On Tues-
day, he made it clear that he is becom-
ing nothing more than a President for 
the far-left wing of the Democratic 
Party. In less than a year, he has gone 
from promising unity to sowing divi-
sion. It is a sad epitaph to a Presidency 
that has barely begun. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 3436 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the eyes of 
history are upon us today. Each of us 
will be faced with a momentous ques-
tion: Can we put petty differences 
aside, and can we come together to de-
fend our friend and our ally Ukraine 
against imminent Russian aggression? 
This isn’t theoretical. Russian tanks 
and troops are, right now, massed on 
the Ukrainian border, and they are pre-
paring for invasion. The Senate, in just 
a few hours, will vote on a bill that 
represents the best way to deter Putin 
from invading Ukraine by sanctioning 
the company that is racing to finish 
and make operational the Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline, which Putin desperately 
wants completed so that he can use it 
as a cudgel against our European al-
lies. If we don’t come together today, 
Ukraine risks getting wiped off the 
map altogether. 
Putin didn’t just wake up one day 
and 
decide 
he 
wanted 
to 
invade 
Ukraine. He has wanted to invade 
Ukraine for years. He did so already in 
2014, but he stopped short of a full inva-
sion because he couldn’t endanger 
Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, which 
he needs to get Russia’s natural gas to 
Europe. 
That 
stopped 
Putin 
from 
marching all the way to Kiev. The next 
year, in 2015, Putin began the Nord 
Stream 2 project—to build a pipeline to 
go around Ukraine so that he could get 
his gas to Europe and invade Ukraine 
with no risk to the billions he relies on 
every year. 
Nord Stream 2, as we know and as we 
have heard from Republicans and from 
Democrats—literally hundreds of times 
over the past years on this floor, in 
committees, in briefings—Nord Stream 
2 was designed to circumvent Ukraine. 
It is why the Senate has worked to-
gether for years, in a bipartisan man-
ner, to stop Nord Stream 2 from com-
ing online. 
In 2017, Congress came together and 
passed the Countering America’s Ad-
versaries Through Sanctions Act, or 
CAATSA, 
which 
sanctioned 
invest-
ments in Russian energy export pipe-
lines. 
In 2019, Congress passed Protecting 
Europe’s 
Energy 
Security 
Act, 
or 
PEESA, which sanctions Nord Stream 
2 directly. I authored that bill, along 
with Democratic Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN. 
And, in 2021, Congress expanded those 
sanctions in the Protecting Europe’s 
Energy 
Security 
Clarification 
Act. 
Again, I authored that bill, along with 
Democratic Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN. 
For the next several hours, this body 
will revisit and debate this issue once 
again. We will revisit our successes 
from 2019 to 2021 in using targeted 
sanctions to end construction of the 
pipeline. 
When President Trump signed our bi-
partisan sanctions into law, Putin 
stopped construction of the pipeline 
literally 15 minutes before the law be-
came 
effective. 
Sanctions 
worked. 
They succeeded. Together, we won a bi-
partisan foreign policy and national se-
curity victory. 
But we will also revisit in this debate 
the catastrophic decision President 
Biden made in May of this year to 
waive those sanctions. The sanctions 
that had worked, the sanctions that 
were 
successful, 
President 
Biden 
waived them nonetheless. 
When this debate is over, each of us 
will have to decide whether he or she 
will vote to finally and definitively put 
an end to this pipeline through manda-
tory sanctions. 
Our Ukrainian allies are crying out 
for us to do so. Ukraine’s President and 
Prime Minister and Speaker of the Par-
liament have all explicitly and passion-
ately done so in recent days. Ukraine’s 
Prime Minister said last week that 
Nord Stream 2 is ‘‘no less an existen-
tial threat to [Ukraine’s] security & 
democracy than Russian troops on our 
border.’’ That is the Prime Minister of 
Ukraine begging this body, the U.S. 
Senate, to help him. 
Just this week, a public letter from 
leaders 
in 
Ukrainian 
civil 
society 
said—and I want to quote this at 
length. They said: 
Since 
late 
October 
2021, 
Russia 
has 
amassed more than 120,000 troops close to 
the 
Ukrainian 
border 
along 
with 
the 
logistical support for a major new offensive. 
This menacing build-up had been accom-
panied by increasing belligerent rhetoric 
from senior Russian officials. We believe the 
green light given to the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line in May 2021 served as one of the key 
triggers for the current crisis and must be 
urgently revised. 
In ordinary times, that open letter 
from Ukrainian civil society would res-
onate with both Democrats and Repub-
licans. This is a plea for help. 
Opponents of our legislation are 
clutching at pretexts to avoid doing 
what we have done many times before, 
and I want to address those pretexts 
one at a time. 
One argument we have heard again 
and again is that imposing sanctions 
on Nord Stream 2 AG, the Gazprom- 
owned cutout that runs Nord Stream 2, 
would shatter European unity. That is 
an argument that is being repeated by 
the White House repeatedly—that this 
is all about transatlantic unity; we 
should give Putin its pipeline because 
of transatlantic unity. 
I urge every Senator to ask a simple 
question: What unity and with whom? 
In January, the European Parliament 
voted to condemn and stop the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. The vote was 581 to 
50—581 to 50. If you care about trans-
atlantic unity, let me suggest that we 
side with the 581 and not the 50. The 
Biden White House’s argument is lit-
erally: Go with the 50 in the name of 
transatlantic unity. 
I don’t know how you stand up and 
make that argument with a straight 
face—581 to 50. 
In August of 2021, the chairs of the 
Foreign Affairs Committees in nine 
countries opposed explicitly the Nord 
Stream 2 U.S.-German agreement—the 
Biden agreement—to allow the comple-
tion of Nord Stream 2. Among those 
countries that explicitly opposed that 
agreement: Estonia, the Czech Repub-
lic, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Are 
those countries Europe? Do we care 
about transatlantic unity with those 
countries that are begging us to find 
the courage to stand up to Vladimir 
Putin? 
When President Biden made his deal 
to allow the pipeline to go through 
anyway, 
the 
Foreign 
Ministers 
of 
Ukraine and Poland issued a remark-
able joint statement declaring that the 
decision President Biden made to sur-
render to Putin, that it created an im-
mediate ‘‘security crisis’’ for Europe. 
They told us then—Ukraine and Poland 
both told us then—that, as a result of 
waiving sanctions, we are going to see 
Russian troops. They were right. It is 
almost as if they understand their 
neighbor. It is almost as if they under-
stand Putin’s desire to reassemble the 
Soviet Union. It is almost as if they be-
lieve Vladimir Putin when he said that 
he believed the greatest geopolitical 
disaster of the 20th century was the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union, and he 
wants to bring it back together by 
force, which I would note would be a 
grave national security threat to the 
United States. 
Now, some will say, when they say 
European unity, they really mean 
unity with Germany. Indeed, I have 
heard Members on this floor say: Lis-
ten, I am just not prepared to sanction 
Germany. 
This bill doesn’t sanction Germany. 
It doesn’t sanction the German Gov-
ernment. It doesn’t sanction the Ger-
man 
company. 
It 
sanctions 
Nord 
Stream 2 AG, which is wholly owned 
and controlled by Gazprom. This is 
sanctioning a Russian cutout because 
this pipeline is a tool for Putin’s ag-
gression in Europe. 
And even when it comes to unity in 
Germany, what they really mean is 
unity with Angela Merkel, and I will 
concede that. Angela Merkel wants 
this pipeline. I don’t fully understand 
why, but she does. But Angela Merkel 
is no longer the Chancellor of Ger-
many. Indeed, the German people went

January 13, 2022 
to the polls, and they voted her party 
out of office. So one would think from 
the United States, to the extent we are 
concerned about standing with an ally, 
we should be concerned about the cur-
rent Government of Germany, not the 
former government, and we should re-
spect the views of the German people. 
Now, the current Government of Ger-
many is hopelessly fractured on Nord 
Stream 2. The Greens, who are part of 
this coalition government, passion-
ately oppose Nord Stream 2. Vocally, 
repeatedly they have condemned Nord 
Stream 2, and they are an integral part 
of this German Government. But just a 
few hours ago, the German Defense 
Minister, on the other side, said Nord 
Stream 2 is off the table. They are not 
willing to do anything to stop Nord 
Stream 2. And the German Chancellor 
has said the same, declaring that he 
seeks a positive reset with Putin. This 
is the same Putin who has tanks on the 
border of Ukraine, and he is preparing 
to invade. 
Another argument that we will hear 
is that sanctions should be kept in our 
pockets. We should reserve them for 
use later in the case of a Russian inva-
sion. I would note, this is not what our 
Ukrainian allies advocate, and I have 
trouble believing anyone in this Cham-
ber actually takes this argument seri-
ously, nor should they. Putin doesn’t. 
Putin believes that once he brings 
Nord Stream 2 online, and once he has 
changed the region through invasion, 
that no one will have the will to im-
pose sanctions. And I would note, he is 
not crazy to believe that. 
When the Biden administration first 
capitulated to Russia on Nord Stream 
2, the Biden administration and the 
German Government made a promise. 
They said if—if, if—Russia uses energy 
for energy blackmail, then we will stop 
the pipeline. They beat their chest 
with that promise. They were quite 
bold about it. I have had some Mem-
bers of the Senate say: Well, we have 
got really strong promises from Ger-
many now. 
Well, what has happened since then? 
Russia has nakedly and unequivocally 
used energy for energy blackmail. En-
ergy prices have skyrocketed in Eu-
rope, and Putin is openly boasting, he 
is laughing and saying: Well, turn Nord 
Stream 2 on and your energy prices 
will go down. 
He is not hiding it. He is not pre-
tending. He did exactly what the Biden 
White House and the German Govern-
ment said: If you do x, we will stop it. 
He did it openly, brazenly, laugh-
ingly, and absolutely nothing hap-
pened—zero, crickets. 
Mr. President, I ask you, as a reason-
able man, if the German Government 
and the Biden White House were un-
willing to impose sanctions when Putin 
immediately triggered what they said 
was their redline, in what universe 
would the Biden White House or the 
German Government have greater re-
solve once millions of Germans are de-
pendent on Russian natural gas from 
Nord Stream 2 to heat their homes 
when it is literally stopping the Ger-
mans from freezing to death? Because 
that, if the Ukrainian pipeline is shut 
down, becomes the only viable source 
of heat. Do we really think they are 
going to have greater courage then 
than they have had so far? Nobody 
does. Putin doesn’t. 
It is important to understand that 
the debate before this Chamber is, Do 
we impose sanctions before an invasion 
in order to stop the invasion or do we 
threaten sanctions after an invasion is 
done? 
The bill that my colleague Senator 
MENENDEZ is pushing would do the lat-
ter. It would impose sanctions after an 
invasion is completed. I don’t think 
Putin believes those sanctions would 
ever be imposed. But I can tell you, 
Ukrainian President Zelensky has very 
expressly addressed this issue. Here is 
what he said: ‘‘Only if the sanctions 
are applied prior to the armed conflict 
would they become a prevention mech-
anism for any possible escalation.’’ 
That is the President of Ukraine beg-
ging the Members of this Senate to 
vote in favor of the bill on the floor 
today. 
Today will be one of our very last 
chances to stop Nord Stream 2 and to 
stop an imminent Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. 
Just a few minutes ago, two of my 
colleagues, Senator MURPHY and Sen-
ator SHAHEEN, had a colloquy in which 
they explained why they have flipped 
their positions. They and every other 
Democrat in this Chamber have voted 
for sanctions on Nord Stream 2 not 
once but twice. Every Democrat voted 
in support of my bipartisan sanctions 
on Nord Stream 2. Only two things 
have changed since all of the Demo-
crats voted in favor of these sanctions: 
No. 1, the occupant of the White House, 
who now has a ‘‘D’’ behind his name in-
stead of an ‘‘R.’’ 
The White House is furiously lob-
bying Democrats, asking Democrats to 
stand with their party—sadly, at the 
expense of our allies, at the expense of 
Europe, and at the expense of U.S. na-
tional security. 
On the merits, this should be a very 
easy vote. And I would suggest, if Joe 
Biden were not President, if Donald 
Trump were sitting in the Oval Office 
today, every single Democrat in this 
Chamber would vote for these sanc-
tions—all of them—as they did twice 
when Donald Trump was sitting in the 
Oval Office. 
The other thing that has changed, by 
the way, is the Russian troops on the 
border of Ukraine, which is exactly 
what the Ukrainians and the Poles told 
us would happen when Biden waived 
these sanctions. 
Those are the two things that have 
changed. 
I have to say, my colleagues Senators 
MURPHY and SHAHEEN had a very odd 
colloquy because they decided to go 
after me personally instead of focusing 
on the merits of the issue. In par-
ticular, they said: You know, when 
Trump was President, Senator CRUZ 
didn’t hold his State Department nomi-
nees over Nord Stream 2, and Trump 
didn’t impose sanctions over Nord 
Stream 2. 
Now, I recognize in politics some-
times, in the heat of the moment, you 
say things; you don’t entirely think 
through them. But even in the annals 
of bad arguments, that is a singularly 
absurd argument. It is true I didn’t 
hold the State Department nominees 
over Nord Stream 2. It is true Trump 
didn’t impose sanctions. Why? Because 
we stopped Nord Stream 2, because we 
were successful. 
When I authored the bipartisan sanc-
tions, there were significant elements 
of the Trump administration that re-
sisted it. The Department of the Treas-
ury fought mightily against it. And I 
was more than happy to battle my own 
party on this because this was the 
right thing to do for U.S. national se-
curity. Is there even one Democrat 
with the courage to do that against his 
own party now that it is the other side? 
The argument I didn’t hold any 
nominees—why would I hold nominees? 
President Trump signed the bill. I have 
said from the beginning: If Biden im-
poses the sanctions, I will lift all the 
holds. I lifted 32 holds in December to 
get this vote. 
My focus is on stopping this pipeline 
and stopping Putin and Russia. And 
their argument that, well, 
Trump 
didn’t impose sanctions—that is cor-
rect, because Putin stopped building 
the pipeline. 
I remind you of the timing. President 
Trump signed the bill, if my memory 
serves correctly, at 7 p.m. on a Thurs-
day night. Putin stopped building the 
pipeline at 6:45 p.m., 15 minutes before-
hand. There was nothing to sanction 
because 
they 
didn’t 
commit 
the 
sanctionable conduct; they stopped. 
They only returned to building the 
pipeline—does the Presiding Officer 
know what date Putin began building 
the deep-sea pipeline once again? Janu-
ary 24, 2021, 4 days after Joe Biden was 
sworn into office. Putin knew that 
Biden was going to do what he did: 
waive the sanctions and surrender. The 
sanctions worked. We had a bipartisan 
victory that, inexplicably, this White 
House gave away. 
I want to take a minute to speak to 
my Democratic colleagues. 
Listen, there are lots of issues we are 
going to disagree with one another on 
a partisan matter. That is fine. We will 
talk about tax rates, whether they 
should be high or low. We can have 
good, vigorous arguments about that. 
That is a part of our democracy. But in 
this instance, the Biden White House is 
carrying out a policy that makes no 
sense, that abandons our allies, that is 
harmful to American national security, 
that strengthens and encourages the 
aggression of Vladimir Putin, a bully 
and a tyrant, and that makes war 
much more likely. 
Most, if not all, of my Democratic 
colleagues know all of this. I am going

to ask my Democratic colleagues to do 
something hard, which is to have the 
courage to stand up and take some par-
tisan grief for voting against the White 
House on this one. Save the White 
House from the mistake they are mak-
ing. That is one of the roles of the Sen-
ate. We keep hearing the analogy the 
Framers used of a saucer to cool the 
tempers of the moment. The Senate did 
that with President Trump. The Senate 
should do so with President Biden as 
well. 
In my 10 years in the U.S. Senate, I 
have taken a lot of votes. The Pre-
siding Officer has taken a lot of votes. 
There are very few votes that I think 
are as consequential as the vote we are 
getting ready to take. 
If Senate Democrats put partisan 
loyalty above national security, if they 
vote simply by party line, it will dra-
matically increase the chances of a 
violent Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
Days or weeks or months from now, if 
we turn on the television set and see 
Russian tanks in the streets of Kiev, 
the reason will be that the U.S. Senate 
heard the pleas of our Ukrainian allies 
and we turned a deaf ear to them. I 
pray that we don’t do so. The eyes of 
history are upon us, and this body, Re-
publicans and Democrats, should rise 
to the occasion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, the Republican Senate leader 
came to the floor and noted the fact 
that when the American people were 
asked about the issues of the moment, 
they didn’t mention their right to vote. 
I think most Americans would be sur-
prised that we are even debating that 
issue at this moment in American his-
tory. 
We know the right to vote has been 
contentious, divisive, deadly when it 
comes to the policies of this Nation 
and particularly the policies of indi-
vidual States. It was one of the critical 
reasons, in addition to the hideous in-
stitution of slavery, that we went to 
war among ourselves and 600,000-plus 
Americans gave their lives. It really 
was at the heart of what happened 
after that when the North prevailed, 
the Union was saved, and the President 
of the United States, a man from Illi-
nois, not only created an Emancipation 
Proclamation but set the stage for con-
stitutional amendments which guaran-
teed that right to vote. 
So I imagine some people would be 
excused if they didn’t list it as the 
highest priority. They probably assume 
it is really not an issue for debate, but 
it is. You see, in this last Presidential 
election, we had two or three historic 
things occur. 
First, the turnout of American voters 
was unprecedented. That is a good 
thing. In a democracy, it is to be ap-
plauded, and each year, we should try 
to improve on that outcome. 
The second thing, though, we would 
have to put in the liability column, and 
that is a petulant former President 
who refused to even acknowledge that 
he lost the election and instead claims 
that he was abused and that it was sto-
len from him. That fanciful lie is now 
making its way across America back 
and forth as former President Trump 
peddles it in every quarter. Unfortu-
nately, some people are listening. 
Some 30 percent of American people 
agree with the former President that 
the election was stolen from him. 
He couldn’t win that argument in 
any courtroom. He couldn’t even con-
vince his handpicked Attorney General 
to back him up. So he resorted to send-
ing a mob of his followers on January 
6, 2021, to storm this Capitol. For the 
first time since 1812, we were invaded 
by people who did not subscribe to the 
basic tenets of our Constitution. It was 
a grim day. I will never forget it. Those 
who were here, I am sure, say the 
same. But it set the stage for a cam-
paign that has followed for more than 
a year. 
This morning, we read in the paper 
that some eight Republican attorneys 
general are going to close ranks in a 
Trump-inspired 
alliance 
to 
change 
election laws across America to his lik-
ing. Shame on them, and shame on 
anyone who thinks that is what Amer-
ica is all about. 
We should encourage more and more 
of those legally eligible to vote. We 
should make it an easy exercise and 
not a hardship and burden. But the 
States—almost 20 of them now—are in 
the process of changing the laws in 
their States on voting and, with each 
change in the law, making it more dif-
ficult. Oh, it doesn’t sound too rep-
rehensible on its face, until you add it 
all together: the notion that people 
would have less time to apply for ab-
sentee ballots; the fact that they would 
have to come up with a good reason; 
that their applications for those bal-
lots would have to contain certain in-
formation, which is new and sometimes 
challenging to individuals; limiting the 
periods of time that people can vote; 
limiting the opportunity to register to 
vote in special elections, as in the 
State of Georgia. Each one of those is 
an additive factor to reducing the like-
lihood that people will turn up and 
vote—even this notion in Georgia that 
you can’t provide food and drink to 
voters waiting in line. 
Well, in my hometown of Springfield, 
IL, we vote in the Park District. There 
is seldom a wait of more than 5 min-
utes. That is about the average across 
America, but we know there are excep-
tions. We have seen people waiting in 
line much longer. In fact, one State 
found that African Americans waited 
in line an average of 50 minutes—not 5; 
50 minutes. The idea of perhaps giving 
someone a drink of water under those 
circumstances is now against the law 
in Georgia. It is hard to imagine. That 
is just one of the things they wanted to 
add to the burdens of voting in Amer-
ica. 
So when we come to the floor and 
discuss voting, and the Republican 
leader tells us people don’t care—I bet 
they will when they come to realize 
what is happening. 
It is interesting that he notes that 
what they do care about—they care 
about the coronavirus. I do too. 
I didn’t have to check the voting 
records to know what I am about to 
say is true. That Senator from Ken-
tucky and every other Senator on that 
side of the aisle voted against Joe 
Biden’s American Rescue Plan. 
In the beginning of his administra-
tion, he had a bold, policy-driven piece 
of legislation called the American Res-
cue Plan, which set out to do some-
thing that had to be done. Yes, we had 
found the vaccines, but in order to 
produce them and to administer them, 
we needed a program that cost money. 
Joe Biden stepped up and said: This 
is what we are going to do. We are 
going to get this jab, this shot, avail-
able to Americans across the board, 
and we are going to spend the money to 
do it. It does no good to have a formula 
that can save your life, and yet you 
can’t access it or pay for it. 
So he put it in the American Rescue 
Plan. It just made common sense, 
didn’t it? With so many people dying 
and sick, that we have an ambitious, 
unprecedented, historic administration 
of that vaccine across America? It was 
an easy vote for me and for every Dem-
ocrat and obviously easy on the other 
side for Republicans because not a sin-
gle one, including the Republican lead-
er 
from 
Kentucky, 
would 
support 
President Biden in that effort. 
There was money in there as well to 
keep businesses open so that they 
could hire back their people, go back in 
business. I don’t know about the Pre-
siding Officer’s State. I am sure New 
Jersey is similar to Illinois. But I have 
talked to a lot of restauranteurs who 
walked up to me and said: Senator, we 
never met before, but if you hadn’t 
voted to give me a chance to reopen 
this business, I wouldn’t be here today. 
That is the reality of the bill that 
the Republicans all, every single one, 
voted against. So it is no surprise that 
they come to the floor critical of Joe 
Biden and his Presidency and saying he 
just doesn’t understand the real issues. 
Well, the coronavirus is a real issue. 
The President’s response was a real re-
sponse. Sadly, the unanimous opposi-
tion to the President by the Repub-
lican side of the aisle was also a real 
response. 
I can remember, coming out of col-
lege and hearing about the Voting 
Rights Act being debated right here on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, and as I 
have said before on the floor—and I 
won’t belabor it—I have taken the time 
over the years to understand what led 
up to it—Reconstruction, Jim Crow, 
the great migration, and all that fol-
lowed from that. 
And 
my 
friend—and 
she 
is 
my 
friend—Carol Anderson, a professor at 
Emory University in Atlanta, GA, has 
written a book called ‘‘One Person, No 
Vote.’’ She flattered me and asked me

January 13, 2022 
to write the forward to the book, which 
I gladly did, and then read it and 
thought: What an incredible story it 
tells us about America and the battle 
to win the vote. 
I remember—as I mentioned, I was 
young and fresh out of college and law 
school—when Dr. Martin Luther King 
came to the city of Chicago. I remem-
ber it well because I was in the midst 
of working as a young man on a polit-
ical campaign. And it made all the 
headlines when Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., decided to walk through 
Marquette Park. That particular pa-
rade—that protest—drew violence from 
people dressed in Nazi uniforms, throw-
ing rocks at him, and jeering at those 
who supported his effort. 
I remember that because, nowadays, 
when you talk about Dr. Martin Luther 
King’s day of observance, which is com-
ing up next week, people have a tend-
ency to think of that in gentle and 
positive terms—and it should be. But 
let’s not forget the price he paid—ulti-
mately, his life—to deliver that mes-
sage to a divided America. And so when 
we talk about why he did it and what 
it meant to us, one of the guiding fac-
tors was the right to vote and his belief 
that, from Reconstruction forward to 
his day, we were still finding ways to 
deny the right to vote to African 
Americans and others in this country. 
It was that fundamental an issue—an 
issue he was willing to give his life for. 
For some of us, Martin Luther King 
Day will be a day of reflection, a 
chance to envision in America what it 
truly means to be ‘‘free at last.’’ But it 
is also a day of action. Let’s hope we 
have some action here on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. 
Each day we open the session in the 
Senate by pledging allegiance to the 
flag. That is a good thing. I do it out of 
respect and gladly so. But we don’t 
stand here and pledge allegiance to the 
filibuster. The filibuster is a Senate 
rule, not that long in its history, that 
is an interpretation of what the Senate 
is about. It has changed over the years 
over and over again. It is not sacred. It 
is not constitutional dictum. It is, in 
fact, the best efforts of politicians in 
this Chamber, in their day, to write a 
rule that establishes a minimum vote. 
What does it mean to us? Well, it 
means a lot. In a Senate that is divided 
50–50—50 Republicans and 50 Demo-
crats—it means that there are meas-
ures which require 60 votes. It used to 
be a rare occurrence in this body that 
someone would invoke a filibuster, and 
yet now it has become virtually com-
monplace. 
If you just look at the last 5 or 10 
years, you can see a change in the Sen-
ate, a dramatic orchestrated change in 
the Senate. What was uncommon, re-
quiring 60 votes for a measure, has now 
become the standard, and, of course, 
what that means is very few things 
come to the floor of the Senate. 
When the Republicans were in con-
trol, just a few years ago, during the 
course of an entire calendar year, on 
the Senate floor we voted for 26 amend-
ments—26. In the normal history of the 
Senate, hundreds of amendments are 
voted in the course of a year. But be-
cause of the filibuster and the design of 
many to slow down and stop the busi-
ness of the Senate, in 1 year we voted 
for 26 amendments—26. 
And that is what happens when you 
shut down debate. That is what hap-
pens when you shut down opportunity 
for amendments. And that is what hap-
pens when you pledge allegiance to the 
filibuster. 
We have to be honest about this. 
There should be an exception written 
in for the filibuster when it comes to 
voting rights. Something as funda-
mental as our constitutional authority 
to vote should be given the day for ar-
gument on the floor of the Senate and 
should be subject to a majority vote, 
up or down. That is not too much to 
ask. 
I would rather pledge allegiance to 
the flag and to the voting authority in 
America that it represents than to the 
filibuster, a rule which has been mis-
used as much as it has been properly 
used in its history. 
There are many enduring victories 
we can attribute to Dr. King and the 
civil rights movement. But the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 are certainly high on 
the list. These laws put a stake in the 
heart of Jim Crow, expanding voting 
rights to generations of Black Ameri-
cans. 
Prior to the passage of these laws, 
State legislators throughout the Deep 
South had disenfranchised voters of 
color through a whirlwind of discrimi-
natory legislation. These laws didn’t 
explicitly ban Black Americans from 
voting. The 15th Amendment, ratified 
during Reconstruction, prevented them 
from doing that. But soon enough, 
these lawmakers discovered new ways 
to discriminate against voters of color. 
And in decades after Reconstruction, 
they erected barriers to the ballot box, 
like poll taxes, property ownership re-
quirements, literacy tests. 
When it comes to Jim Crow laws, it 
is easy to get caught up in abstractions 
and generic descriptions. You hear the 
phrase ‘‘literacy test,’’ that was used 
even into the 1960s in America, and you 
think: Well, that just means I have to 
read at grade-school level, right? 
Wrong. A poll test from a Louisiana 
parish had questions on it which I 
struggle to answer even today. And 
they were designed to make sure that 
voters wouldn’t be able to answer. 
‘‘Draw a line around a number or letter 
of this sentence.’’ What the heck does 
that mean? And on and on. 
I share this example to demonstrate 
what voter suppression looked like in 
the days of Dr. King. In the words of 
historian Carol Anderson, whom I men-
tioned earlier, tactics like literacy 
tests were ‘‘legislative evil genius.’’ 
They didn’t disenfranchise voters on 
the basis of their skin color outright. 
But they were only administered to 
some voters, and you can imagine 
which ones. 
Thank God the Members of the Sen-
ate on a bipartisan basis decided in the 
1960s to outlaw this legislative sleight 
of hand. Our predecessors didn’t cave in 
to the disingenuous cries of ‘‘States’ 
rights,’’ which we hear to this day on 
the Republican side of the aisle. Our 
predecessors understood that voting is 
a fundamental liberty. It should be 
treated differently. It is the reason we 
pledge allegiance to that flag, because 
we make the decision, under that flag, 
of who governs us. 
Right now, millions of American vot-
ers are facing a new wave of voter sup-
pression laws, and much like the pro-
ponents of Jim Crow laws did in their 
day, 
Republicans 
State 
lawmakers 
today are erecting new barriers to the 
ballot box, latching onto the myth of 
‘‘widespread voter fraud.’’ That is what 
the State legislative leaders are say-
ing. Where could they have come up 
with that idea? Is it possible that it is 
a disgruntled former President with a 
bruised ego because he lost his effort 
for reelection in 2020? 
The reality is, the laws they are pass-
ing in these States are not about pre-
venting voter fraud. They are about 
preventing eligible Americans from 
voting. The nurse working back-to- 
back shifts on election day, the single 
parent who doesn’t own a car or can’t 
afford a babysitter, or a person living 
with a disability—should we be con-
cerned as to whether they have an op-
portunity to vote? We certainly should. 
The new laws enacted in nearly 20 
States will prevent our most vulner-
able neighbors from exercising their 
right to vote. That is why we ought to 
look at the Senate rules. It isn’t just a 
matter of some theoretical academic 
debate on the rules. These are real-life 
decisions in States across the Nation. 
And the most troubling of these laws 
take the assault of democracy even fur-
ther. They give partisan actors more 
power to meddle and interfere in elec-
tion administration. Some of the pro-
posals we have seen can potentially 
allow partisans to overrule the valid 
votes of the American people and 
anoint a victor of their own choosing. 
Over the next few days, I expect 
many of us will quote excerpts of Dr. 
King’s most famous speeches. My hope 
is that we will take heed of the words 
he wrote in that letter from the Bir-
mingham jail. In it, he responded to a 
group of White religious leaders who 
had pleaded with him and his fellow 
civil rights advocates to slow down, 
wait a little longer, racial equality is 
going to follow soon. 
In response, Dr. King wrote: ‘‘For 
years now, I’ve heard the word ‘Wait!’. 
. . . This ‘Wait’ has almost meant 
‘Never’. . . . We must come to see, with 
one of our distinguished jurists, of yes-
terday that ‘justice too long delayed is 
justice denied.’’’ 
He continued, ‘‘We’ve waited for 
more than 340 years for our God-given 
and constitutional rights. . . . I hope,

sirs, you can understand our legitimate 
and unavoidable impatience.’’ 
The issue that we are debating on 
voting rights and the issue of our rules 
is not just a casual conversation about 
a rule book no one hardly knows of. It 
is an issue that does go to the heart of 
our democracy, to our pledge of alle-
giance to the flag, not to the filibuster. 
The issue is our Republican col-
leagues are afraid of this debate. 
Traditionally, they played a key role 
in the passage of the Voting Rights Act 
in the 1960s. In fact, percentagewise, 
there were more Republican Senators 
voting for that than Democratic Sen-
ators. And I say that acknowledging 
that my Democratic Party, in those 
days, was not altogether on the right 
side. 
We have been told that we are break-
ing the Senate if we change this rule to 
protect people’s right to vote. At the 
heart of what the Senate is and what it 
stands for and the reason it exists is 
the right of Americans to vote. 
Is it worth a carve-out? Is it worth a 
change? Is it worth a modification of 
the Senate rules to protect the right to 
vote? Can anything be more sacred? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise at 
a challenging, divisive time for our Na-
tion. For years, America’s politics have 
spiraled steadily downward into in-
creasingly bitter, tribal partisanship, 
and our democracy has been strained. 
While that may sound abstract, it is 
a problem that hurts Americans in 
real, tangible ways. These deepening 
divisions hurt our ability to work to-
gether, to create new job opportunities, 
to protect the health and safety of our 
communities and country, and to en-
sure 
everyday 
families 
get 
ahead. 
Americans across the country know 
this. They see it every day, not only on 
social media and cable news but at 
their jobs and around their dinner ta-
bles. We are divided. 
It is more likely today that we look 
at other Americans who have different 
views and see the other or even see 
them as enemies instead of as fellow 
country men and women who share our 
core values. It is more common today 
to demonize someone who thinks dif-
ferently than us, rather than to seek to 
understand their views. 
Our politics reflect and exacerbate 
these divisions, making it more and 
more difficult to find lasting, broadly 
supported solutions to safeguard our 
freedoms, keep our country safe, and 
expand opportunity for all our citizens. 
So two questions face us as a nation: 
Where does this descending spiral of di-
vision lead, and how can we stop it? 
Our country’s divisions have now 
fueled efforts in several States that 
will make it more difficult for Ameri-
cans to vote and undermine faith that 
all Americans should have in our elec-
tions and our democracy. These State 
laws have no place in a nation whose 
government is formed by free, fair, and 
open elections. 
We must also acknowledge a painful 
fact: 
The State laws we seek to address 
are symptoms of a larger, more deeply 
rooted problem facing our democracy— 
the divisions themselves, which have 
hardened in recent years and have com-
bined with rampant disinformation to 
push too many Americans away from 
our basic constitutional values. 
In the spring of 2017, after Trump 
took office, I wrote an opinion piece in 
the Arizona Republic highlighting my 
concerns about the strains on our con-
stitutional boundaries and the shrink-
ing respect for our founding constitu-
tional principles. In the years that fol-
lowed, my colleagues and I in this body 
were called upon to participate in two 
separate impeachment trials for crimes 
against our Constitution. 
And on January 6, last year, I was 
standing in this very spot, speaking in 
this very Chamber, defending Arizona’s 
fair 
and 
valid 
election 
against 
disinformation, when violent insurrec-
tionists halted the Presidential certifi-
cation. 
Threats to American democracy are 
real. 
I share the concerns of civil right ad-
vocates and others I have heard from in 
recent months about these State laws. 
I strongly support those efforts to con-
test these laws in court and to invest 
significant resources into these States 
to better organize and stop efforts to 
restrict access at the ballot box. 
And I strongly support and will con-
tinue to vote for legislative responses 
to address these State laws—including 
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
that the Senate is currently consid-
ering. 
I support these bills because they 
strengthen Americans’ access to the 
ballot box, and they better ensure that 
Americans’ votes are counted fairly. It 
is through elections that Americans 
make their voices heard, select their 
representatives, and guide the future of 
our country and our communities. 
These bills help treat the symptoms 
of the disease, but they do not fully ad-
dress the disease itself. And while I 
continue to support these bills, I will 
not support separate actions that wors-
en the underlying disease of division 
infecting our country. 
The debate over the Senate’s 60-vote 
threshold shines a light on our broader 
challenges. There is no need for me to 
restate my longstanding support for 
the 60-vote threshold to pass legisla-
tion. 
There is no need for me to restate its 
role: protecting our country from wild 
reversals in Federal policy. It is a view 
I have held during my years serving in 
both the U.S. House and the Senate, 
and it is the view I continue to hold. It 
is the belief that I have shared many 
times in public settings and in private 
settings. 
Senators of both parties have offered 
ideas, including some that would earn 
my support to make this body more 
productive, more deliberative, more re-
sponsive to Americans’ needs, and a 
place of genuine debate about our 
country’s pressing issues. 
And while this week’s harried discus-
sions about Senate rules are but a poor 
substitute for what I believe could 
have—and 
should 
have—been 
a 
thoughtful public debate at any time 
over the past year, such a discussion is 
still a worthy goal. 
But a discussion of rules falls short 
of what is required. American politics 
are cyclical, and the granting of power 
in Washington, DC, is exchanged regu-
larly by the voters from one party to 
another. 
This shift of power back and forth 
means the Senate 60-vote threshold has 
proved maddening to Members of both 
political 
parties 
in 
recent 
years— 
viewed either as a weapon of obstruc-
tion or a safety net to save the country 
from radical policies, depending on 
whether you serve in the majority or 
the minority. 
But what is the legislative filibuster 
other than a tool that requires new 
Federal policy to be broadly supported 
by Senators representing a broader 
cross section of Americans—a guardrail 
inevitably viewed as an obstacle by 
whoever holds the Senate majority but 
which, in reality, ensures that millions 
of Americans, represented by the mi-
nority party, have a voice in the proc-
ess? 
Demands to eliminate this thresh-
old—from whichever party holds the 
fleeting majority—amount to a group 
of people separated on two sides of a 
canyon, shouting that solution to their 
colleagues, and that makes the rift 
both wider and deeper. 
Consider this: In recent years, nearly 
every party-line response to the prob-
lems we face in this body, every par-
tisan action taken to protect a cher-
ished value has led us to more division, 
not less. 
The impact is clear for all to see: the 
steady escalation of tit for tat, in 
which each new majority weakens the 
guardrails of the Senate and excludes 
input from the other party, furthering 
resentment and anger amongst this 
body and our constituents at home. 
Democrats’ increased use of requiring 
cloture for traditional nominees under 
President George W. Bush led to simi-
lar tactics by Republicans under Presi-
dent Barack Obama. The 2013 decision 
by Senate Democrats to eliminate the 
60-vote threshold for most judicial and 
Presidential nominations led directly 
to a response in 2017 by Senate Repub-
licans who eliminated the threshold for 
Supreme Court nominees. 
These shortsighted actions by both 
parties have led to our current Amer-
ican judiciary and Supreme Court 
which, as I stand here today, is consid-
ering questions regarding fundamental 
rights Americans have enjoyed for dec-
ades. 
Eliminating the 60-vote threshold— 
on a party line with the thinnest of 
possible majorities—to pass these bills

that I support will not guarantee that 
we prevent demagogues from winning 
office. 
Indeed, some who undermine the 
principles of democracy have already 
been elected. Rather, eliminating the 
60-vote threshold will simply guarantee 
that we lose a critical tool that we 
need to safeguard our democracy from 
threats in the years to come. 
It is clear that the two parties’ strat-
egies are not working—not for either 
side and especially not for the country. 
I know it is comfortable for Members 
of each party, particularly those who 
spent their career in party politics, to 
think that their respective party alone 
can move the country forward. Party 
control becomes a goal in and of itself, 
instead of prioritizing a healthy, appro-
priate balance in which Americans’ di-
verse views and shared values are rep-
resented. 
But when one party needs only to ne-
gotiate with itself, policy will inex-
tricably be pushed from the middle to-
ward the extremes. 
And I understand, there are some on 
both sides of the aisle that prefer that 
outcome, but I do not. And I know that 
Arizonans do not either. Our country’s 
first President, George Washington, a 
leader whose wisdom I borrowed at the 
conclusion of the 2020 impeachment 
trial—he warned against political fac-
tions more than 200 years ago, saying 
that extreme partisanship could lead to 
the ‘‘ruins of public liberty.’’ 
‘‘I was no party man myself,’’ Wash-
ington wrote, ‘‘and the first wish of my 
heart was, if parties did exist, to rec-
oncile them.’’ 
Today, we serve in an equally divided 
Senate, and today marks the longest 
time in history that the Senate has 
been equally divided. The House of 
Representatives is nearly equally di-
vided as well. 
Our mandate? It seems evident to 
me: work together and get stuff done 
for America. 
And the past years have shown when 
a party in control pushes party-line 
changes exceeding their electoral man-
date, the bitterness within our politics 
is exacerbated, tensions are raised 
within the country, and traditionally 
nonpartisan issues are transformed 
into partisan wedges. 
We must address the disease itself— 
the disease of division—to protect our 
democracy. And it cannot be achieved 
by one party alone. It cannot be 
achieved solely by the Federal Govern-
ment. The response requires something 
greater and, yes, more difficult, than 
what the Senate is discussing today. 
We need robust, sustained strategies 
that put aside party labels and focus on 
our democracy because these chal-
lenges are bigger than party affiliation. 
We must commit to a long-term ap-
proach as serious as the problems we 
seek to solve—one that prioritizes lis-
tening and understanding, one that em-
braces making progress on shared pri-
orities and finding common ground on 
issues where we hold differing and di-
verse views. 
This work requires all Americans ev-
erywhere. Efforts to fix these problems 
on a bare-majority party line will only 
succeed in exacerbating the root causes 
that gave way to these State laws in 
the first place, extending our dissent 
into a more fragmented America. 
This work is our shared responsi-
bility as Americans. I share the dis-
appointment of many that we have not 
found more support on the other side of 
the aisle for legislative responses to 
State-level voting restrictions. I wish 
that were not the case, just as I wish 
there had been a more serious effort on 
the part of Democratic Party leaders 
to sit down with the other party and 
genuinely discuss how to reforge com-
mon ground on these issues. 
My Republican colleagues have a 
duty to meet their shared responsi-
bility to protect access to voting and 
the integrity of our electoral process. 
We need a sustained, robust effort to 
defend American democracy, an effort 
on the part of Democrats, Republicans, 
Independents, and all Americans in 
communities across this country. So 
we ask, What must we do to protect 
our democracy? 
We should invest heavily in recruit-
ing and supporting State and local can-
didates for office—in both parties—who 
represent the values enshrined in our 
Constitution. 
We should ensure we have a judiciary 
that is less lopsided in its political 
leanings and that we can all depend on 
to uphold the Constitution. 
We must confront and combat the 
rise of rampant disinformation and en-
sure that all Americans have the tools 
to see fact from fiction. This will be 
particularly difficult work since some 
in power have used disinformation to 
manipulate our differences and pull 
Americans apart, pressuring us to see 
our fellow Americans as enemies. 
The dangers facing our democracy 
took years to metastasize, and they 
will take years of sustained, focused ef-
fort to effectively reverse. There are 
steps that we can take today to fix our 
politics and better set the stage for re-
pairing our democracy. 
Many of you know I began my career 
as a social worker. And in our social 
work training, our first necessary skill 
is the ability to listen to others—lis-
tening not to argue or rebut but listen-
ing to understand. I ran for the U.S. 
Senate rejecting partisanship, willing 
to work with anyone to help Arizonans 
build better and more secure lives. 
And throughout my time serving Ari-
zona, I have listened to Arizonans ex-
pressing diverse views on inflation, 
economic 
competitiveness, 
climate, 
and social priorities, and the role of 
the Federal government itself. 
I find myself grateful, time and time 
again, to learn from Arizonans who 
share the same core values but differ in 
position on issues and policies. Their 
similarities and their differences are 
surely representative of the complexity 
of Americans nationwide. 
So I find this question answers itself: 
Can two Americans of sharp intellect 
and good faith reach different conclu-
sions to the same question? Yes. Yes, 
of course they can. 
It is easy for elected officials to give 
speeches about what they believe. It is 
harder to listen and acknowledge that 
there are a whole lot of Americans 
with different ideas about what is im-
portant in our country and how to 
solve those problems. 
And yet it is important to recognize 
that disagreements are OK. They are 
normal. 
And 
honest 
disagreements 
matched with a willingness to listen 
and learn can help us forge sturdy and 
enduring solutions. 
You know, Congress was designed to 
bring together Americans of diverse 
views, representing different interests 
and, as a collective, to find com-
promise and common ground to serve 
our country as a whole. 
We face serious challenges, and meet-
ing them must start with a willingness 
to be honest, to listen to one another, 
to lower the political temperature, and 
to seek lasting solutions. 
Some have given up on the goal of 
easing our divisions and uniting Ameri-
cans; I have not. 
I have worked hard to demonstrate in 
my public service the value of working 
with unlikely allies to get results, 
helping others see our common human-
ity and finding our common ground, 
and I remain stubbornly optimistic be-
cause this is America. We have over-
come every challenge we have ever 
faced. 
I am committed to doing my part to 
avoid toxic political rhetoric, to build 
bridges, to forge common ground, and 
to achieve lasting results for Arizona 
and this country. But we are in des-
perate need of more—more people who 
are willing to listen, to seek under-
standing, to stitch together the fabric 
of our country that has been ripping 
around the edges; more people who are 
willing to put down the sticks sharp-
ened for battle and instead pick up 
their neighbors to learn why they are 
angry or upset or left behind. 
So I call on each of us as Americans: 
Let us be those people. We are but one 
country. We have but one democracy. 
We can only survive, we can only keep 
her, if we do so together. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
S. 3436 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak against the sanctioning 
of German and Russian businesses over 
the transport of natural gas between 
their countries. 
Proponents of sanctions say: Sanc-
tion this, sanction that. The Depart-
ment of the Treasury is currently ad-
ministering dozens of sanctions pro-
grams designed to change the behavior 
of certain countries. Yet, no one seems 
to ask the important questions: Do 
sanctions promote peace and under-
standing, or do they escalate tension 
between nations? What behavior has 
China modified since the United States 
began sanctions? Has Russia changed

her behavior? Has Russia given back 
Crimea? Sanctions, although lacking in 
proof of effectiveness, are very popular 
with both parties. 
Embargoes, sanctions’ big brother, 
also garner bipartisan enthusiasm. The 
U.S. embargo of Cuba has now gone on 
for more than 60 years without any evi-
dence of a change in regime or even a 
change in the regime’s policy. 
Embargoes are often described, espe-
cially by the embargoed country, as an 
act of war. Many historians say that 
the U.S.’s embargo of 1807 ultimately 
led to the War of 1812. President Jeffer-
son’s embargo was intended to punish 
France and England for their aggres-
sions, but instead the embargo crippled 
American shipping exports. Exports de-
clined by 75 percent. 
Some historians also blame the U.S. 
embargo of Japan for the ensuing war. 
Roosevelt seized many of Japan’s as-
sets, and Japan lost access to much of 
its international trade and over 80 per-
cent of its imported oil. Effectively, at 
least from the perspective of Japan, 
the embargo was an act of war. 
Yet enthusiasts for embargoes and 
sanctions 
still 
clamor 
for 
more. 
Sanctionistas 
point 
to 
the 
inter-
national sanctions against Iran as the 
lever that brought about the Obama- 
era nuclear agreement with Iran. Per-
haps, but an equally valid argument 
could be made that it was the exten-
sion of carrots rather than sticks that 
brought Iran to the table. It is funny 
how diplomacy seems to require give- 
and-take, not just take, take, take. 
Our interaction with Iran should illu-
minate today’s debate over sanctions 
on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline between 
Russia and Germany, but the shade of 
mercantilism is dimming the light of 
experience. 
Opponents of the pipeline, not sur-
prisingly, are largely from States that 
compete in the sale of natural gas. This 
is more about protectionism than it is 
national security. Reports are that the 
pipeline will cause a significant reduc-
tion in U.S. exports of liquid natural 
gas; hence the keen interest by people 
representing States that sell natural 
gas. This is not so much about national 
security; it is about protectionism. 
Acknowledging that this debate is 
only superficially about national secu-
rity and really more about provincial 
protectionism helps us better under-
stand the dynamics. 
History demonstrates that trade and 
interconnectedness between nations is 
a barrier to war. Engaging in mutually 
beneficial commerce, coupled with a 
potent military deterrence, is the com-
bination that best promises peace. 
Over the past decade, Congress and 
Presidents have heaped sanctions on 
Russia and China. When I have asked 
the State Department officials who 
come before our committee to reveal 
what behavioral changes have come 
about as a result of sanctions, I have 
often gotten blank stares. 
Now, the sanctionistas want to sanc-
tion an already completed pipeline. 
Last year, they said that if we put 
sanctions on, we will stop them. Well, 
the Senate and the House overwhelm-
ingly passed sanctions. We got sanc-
tions, and they still completed the 
pipeline. 
But what behavior are they now ask-
ing Russia to change? What specifically 
has Russia been asked to do? What 
Russian action is necessary for these 
sanctions to end? 
I have asked the sponsor of this bill: 
The sanctions that you want to do to 
Russia, what behavior—what do you 
want from Russia? The response is that 
they 
don’t 
want 
any 
behavioral 
changes from Russia. The word-for- 
word response from the sponsors of this 
bill is that they just want Russia not 
to ship oil to Germany. It is about 
trade. It is about trade that might 
compete with certain natural gas-pro-
ducing States. It has nothing to do 
with national security. 
If Nord Stream 2 sanctions were real-
ly about changing Russian behavior or 
deterring aggression in Ukraine, then 
NATO, 
including 
Germany, 
could 
threaten sanctions if Russia invades 
Ukraine. Now, that—the threat of 
sanctions, with Germany as an ally— 
might actually have deterring value. 
In fact, last summer, the United 
States and Germany did just that. The 
United States and Germany announced 
an agreement in which they said joint-
ly that any attempt to use energy as a 
weapon or commit further aggressive 
acts against Ukraine will be met with 
sanctions. This is Germany and the 
United 
States 
together. 
That 
has 
power. Our little pinprick sanctions 
saying ‘‘We don’t like you, and we are 
going to punish the companies that are 
involved’’ will do nothing. 
If we actually work with Germany, 
we have deterring value. Germany 
could turn off the spigot to the natural 
gas like that. If it is a valid threat 
from Germany with us, together, we 
might be able to deter Russia. But sim-
ply turning the gas pipeline off now 
and sanctioning it is like being a hos-
tage taker and saying ‘‘We don’t want 
you to do this, and we have your hos-
tage’’ and then going ahead and shoot-
ing the hostage before you get what 
you want. 
We should threaten sanctions. The 
threat of sanctions has power. Once 
you turn them on and you have no plan 
to turn them off, you have no leverage 
over Russia and you do nothing. 
The commitment or the agreement 
between 
Germany 
and 
the 
United 
States—the 
agreement 
says, 
‘‘This 
commitment is designed to ensure Rus-
sia will not misuse any pipeline, in-
cluding Nord Stream 2, to achieve ag-
gressive political ends’’ or they will be 
met with sanctions. This could be a de-
terrence. 
The more countries that got together 
and said this—an international com-
munity of sanctions can have some ef-
fect. One-country sanctions, particu-
larly against its ally, Germany, will 
have no effect. 
The rush to impose sanctions now 
undermines the threat of sanctions to 
deter 
Russian 
aggression 
against 
Ukraine. When you put sanctions on 
now and you offer them nothing and no 
way to remove the sanctions, how are 
you deterring anything? In fact, you 
might well make them angry enough 
that they actually do act in response 
to the sanctions in the opposite of 
what you have intended. 
As today’s debate unfolds, I think 
you will find that sanctions against 
Nord Stream 2 are more about mer-
cantilism and protectionism than na-
tional security. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first, 
I would like to ask unanimous consent 
that I be able to speak for up to 5 min-
utes, followed by Senator SULLIVAN, 
who is on the floor, for up to 15 min-
utes and then Senator SASSE for up to 
7 minutes before the scheduled recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
would hope that everyone in this body 
has listened to Senator SINEMA’s im-
portant speech on the filibuster just 
now. I really appreciated her clear- 
eyed rationale—her rationale to pre-
serve the minority voices in this body 
and to find common ground in this 
Chamber. I thank her. 
Mr. President, I also come to the 
floor today to support the sanctions on 
Vladimir Putin’s Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line. Now, I urge all of my colleagues 
to vote in support of S. 3436, the Pro-
tecting Europe’s Energy Security Im-
plementation Act. 
You know, last week, the President 
of Ukraine and the Prime Minister of 
Ukraine endorsed this legislation. The 
Prime Minister said the following: 
Nord Stream 2 is no less an existential 
threat to our security and democracy than 
Russian troops on our border. Senators 
shouldn’t vote to protect Russia and Nord 
Stream 2. This is a security matter not only 
for Ukraine, but for the entire region. 
I believe the Prime Minister of 
Ukraine is exactly right. 
The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is 
being built by Gazprom. For people 
who aren’t familiar with that, Gazprom 
is the Russian state-owned natural gas 
company. Now, the pipeline would dou-
ble the amount of Russian gas going to 
Germany via the Baltic Sea. 
This pipeline is an existential threat 
to our ally Ukraine. It is a threat to 
our allies in Europe as well. 
Right now, Vladimir Putin has mobi-
lized 100,000 troops on the border of 
Ukraine. He can afford to do this be-
cause he is flush with cash. Rising en-
ergy prices and reduced American pro-
duction mean Vladimir Putin has hit 
the energy economic jackpot. The 
world is now more dependent on Rus-
sian oil and energy. If gas starts to 
flow through this pipeline, Vladimir 
Putin will get even richer, more power-
ful, and the world will become even 
more dependent on him, the dictator.

S210 
January 13, 2022 
Vladimir Putin uses energy as a geo-
political weapon. He uses energy to co-
erce our allies and our partners in Eu-
rope. 
Stopping this pipeline should be an 
area of bipartisan agreement. In fact, 
it was an area of bipartisan agreement 
in this very body until Joe Biden be-
came President. Many Democrats in 
the body voted for sanctions the first 
time around. Even Joe Biden opposed 
the pipeline before he became Presi-
dent. 
Congress has overwhelmingly passed 
several pieces of bipartisan legislation 
imposing sanctions on this Russian 
pipeline. Yet the Biden administration 
refuses to implement these laws. 
The Biden administration has now 
been actively lobbying this body and 
actively lobbying Congress against this 
bill. Democrats must think it would 
give Putin what he wants. I don’t get 
it. They think that if you give Putin 
what he wants, then he is going to play 
nice. That is not going to happen. 
Every American President must nego-
tiate from a standpoint and a position 
of American strength. Vladimir Putin 
is cunning, opportunistic, and aggres-
sive. He respects strength, not state-
ments. When he sees an opportunity, 
he takes it. He can smell the weakness. 
The pipeline will mean an enormous 
transfer of wealth—wealth from our al-
lies to our enemy. It will make our al-
lies weaker, and it will make Putin 
stronger. If Putin gets stronger, we 
know he will get even more aggressive. 
It is time now for this body to stand 
up—stand up against Russia. It is time 
to sanction this pipeline. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to commend my colleague from 
Wyoming Senator BARRASSO, who has 
been a leader on so many of these 
issues, and Senator CRUZ on his bill, 
this important piece of legislation that 
we are going to be voting on here in a 
couple hours. 
This Nord Stream 2 sanctions bill is 
not just about the immediate crisis in 
Ukraine, but this would be a continu-
ation of long-term bipartisan American 
strategy as it deals with Russia, energy 
security, and American security. So I 
want to provide a little broader con-
text to that bipartisan strategy and 
put this debate and vote that we are 
having here today into that context. 
The U.S. commitment to European 
security, as we all know, is ironclad. 
We fought two world wars and a cold 
war to protect our interests in a free 
and open Europe. We expanded NATO 
to secure those gains and to prevent 
Russia from ever building a new empire 
that could threaten us or our allies. 
As we all know, Russian power is not 
just a function of military power; to 
the contrary, Vladimir Putin and the 
Russians for decades have been using 
energy in terms of power and energy as 
a weapon. As a matter of fact, it is 
their weapon of choice in many in-
stances in Europe. 
Let me provide a few recent exam-
ples. 
If you look at this map, one pipeline 
that is actually not depicted is the so- 
called Brotherhood Pipeline from Rus-
sia into Ukraine, and it goes into Eu-
rope. The Russians have cut off sup-
plies of natural gas on that and other 
pipelines going through Ukraine in 
2006, in 2008, in 2014, and in 2015. 
In Moldova, shortly after the defeat 
of a pro-Russian Government and the 
election of a pro-Western one, Russia 
did what they normally do. They cut 
off gas to that country. 
And it is not just impacting coun-
tries like Ukraine. When these gas sup-
plies were cut off by Russia—because 
Vladimir Putin was angry about some-
thing—it impacted over 18 EU coun-
tries with regard to those cutoffs. And 
it is happening even today. 
Just yesterday, the head of the Inter-
national Energy Agency in Paris said 
that Russia is already, right now, stra-
tegically limiting natural gas to Eu-
rope during this very cold winter to 
pressure European nations not to sup-
port Ukraine as the Russians amass 
tens of thousands of troops on their 
border as we speak. 
For these reasons, it has been the 
longstanding bipartisan American pol-
icy to do two things as it relates to en-
ergy security: First, we have sought, 
dating back to the 1980s, to block im-
plementation of major pipelines from 
Russia—from the then-Soviet Union 
into Europe. The Reagan administra-
tion did this with sanctions in 1982, and 
we have continued to work this ele-
ment of our policy. The other element 
of American bipartisan policy, as it re-
lates to European energy security, has 
been to help countries—former Soviet 
Union countries, particularly in the 
Caspian and Central Asia area—to pro-
vide their own energy outlets, in terms 
of natural gas and oil, to Europe 
through the southern corridor—the 
BTC Pipeline. 
These are all areas that Democrats 
and Republicans have been involved 
with in terms of energy supplies to our 
European allies that don’t go through 
Russia. Some of the diplomacy here on 
these pipelines started with the Clin-
ton administration, which did a very 
good job on this. I had the opportunity, 
as an Assistant Secretary of State in 
charge of economic and energy issues 
in the Bush Administration, to lead ef-
forts on these southern corridor pipe-
lines, and they were successful. Right 
now, these pipelines are providing en-
ergy to our allies in Europe. They don’t 
go through Russia. They start in coun-
tries like Azerbaijan, go through Geor-
gia, go through Turkey. This has been 
very bipartisan, supported by the Sen-
ate, and the Russians hate this. They 
hate it. 
Why? Because it doesn’t give them 
any control over energy into Europe. 
So, as I mentioned, today’s vote is 
actually part of a long-term bipartisan 
American strategy for decades that we 
have been pursuing because we know 
the Russians use energy—particularly, 
natural gas, as a weapon. 
So how have we been doing on this? 
Well, at the end of the Trump adminis-
tration, we were in a very good posi-
tion on European energy security in 
two key areas. First, as Senator BAR-
RASSO mentioned, we had strong—very 
strong—bipartisan support with regard 
to Nord Stream 2 sanctions, on its con-
struction and operations. We had over-
whelming Republican and Democrat 
support for the sanctions that we are 
going to be voting on today in the 2021 
NDAA and in the 2020 NDAA—very big, 
very bipartisan. 
Another reason we were set up very 
well, in terms of Eurasian energy secu-
rity, is at the end of the Trump admin-
istration we had achieved a long-
standing bipartisan goal of American 
national security, economic security, 
and energy security. What was that? 
Energy independence. We, once again, 
had become the world’s energy super-
power. 
What do I mean by that—largest pro-
ducer of oil, bigger than Saudi Arabia; 
largest producer of natural gas, bigger 
than Russia; one of the biggest pro-
ducers of renewables in the world. This 
is a bipartisan goal. 
With regard to European security, 
why was that so important? Because it 
answered a huge question that the Eu-
ropeans often said: If we are going to 
block Nord Stream 2, Russian gas into 
Germany and other places in Europe, 
where are we going to get the gas? 
Well, we had an answer: You are going 
to get your gas in America. 
Our exports in LNG, liquefied natural 
gas, surged to take care of this prob-
lem. This is a good thing. 
In terms of the environment and cli-
mate, U.S. LNG exports to Europe have 
a 41-percent lower emissions profile 
than Russian gas and pipelines to Eu-
rope. So it is good for the environment, 
climate, national security, energy se-
curity. 
And here is another area. This big 
production of American energy was 
something that the people who know 
Vladimir Putin best knew that it was 
one of the biggest things we could do. 
A couple of years ago, I was in a 
meeting with my colleague whom we 
miss very much here, Senator McCain, 
and a Russian dissident—a very famous 
Russian dissident. And at the very end 
of the meeting, I asked: What more can 
we do to undermine the Putin regime? 
Do you know what he said to me? He 
looked me in the eye, without hesi-
tation, and said: Produce more Amer-
ican energy. That is the No. 1 thing 
that you can do to undermine the 
Putin regime. 
And we did it. We did it. 
So these are all things, in addition to 
strengthening our own military, in ad-
dition to giving the Ukrainians Javelin 
missile systems—all of these things 
were putting us in a good position. 
Putin seemed very much in a box and 
certainly wasn’t threatening Ukraine 
with tens of thousands of troops on the

border. Where are we today on these 
key areas that I just mentioned? 
Well, we are not in such good shape. 
In terms of energy independence, this 
administration seems focused on actu-
ally 
destroying 
the 
production 
of 
American energy—oil and gas in par-
ticular. I guarantee you, the dictators 
in Moscow as well as in Beijing can 
hardly believe their luck. It seems like 
President Biden wants to undermine 
the very bipartisan goals we had for 
decades—American energy independ-
ence and the United States as the 
world’s energy superpower again. 
Just think about what he is seeing: 
canceled pipelines, the Keystone Pipe-
line, Canada and United States, and 
the President is green-lighting Nord 
Stream 2; killing energy production in 
great States like mine. Just Monday, 
there were more obstacles to produce 
energy in Alaska, and now we are im-
porting two times as much oil from 
Russia as we were a year ago. That is 
helping Putin, hurting the United 
States. 
What about Nord Stream 2, where we 
looked so strong just in the past few 
years, with this body, in a strong bipar-
tisan way, sanctioning that pipeline 
right there. President Biden has green- 
lighted it. 
But we don’t have to. That is the 
point of this vote today. Again, this 
vote is not just about the current crisis 
in Ukraine; it is about continuing a 
long-term bipartisan approach to Eur-
asian energy security that would make 
our European allies less vulnerable to 
Russian energy blackmail, which has 
not only gone back decades, it is lit-
erally happening right now. Just lis-
ten, as I mentioned, to the Inter-
national Energy Agency’s report yes-
terday on this topic. 
To be honest, it is also about a more 
political question, this vote today. 
Many of my Democratic colleagues 
suddenly became very hawkish against 
Russia and Putin on these issues and 
other issues during the Trump years, 
and I welcomed their conversion to a 
more hard-line approach. But it always 
begged the question, was that more 
hawkish conversion a principled one 
because they realized being tough on 
Putin, in terms of energy and our mili-
tary, was the best way to achieve 
American national interests or was 
this conversion more of a temporary 
one, depending on who occupied the 
White House? I hope it is not the lat-
ter, but today’s vote will answer that 
for some of the Senators who are look-
ing to change their recent votes. 
But, clearly, some of my colleagues 
just a few years ago, who were voting 
to sanction and stop the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline and were sounding very tough 
on Vladimir Putin and Russia, are now 
in a bit of a quandary if they vote dif-
ferently today. So, not surprisingly, 
they are making arguments to ration-
alize this new position, and I would 
like to review, briefly, just a few of 
those. 
Senator MURPHY has been down on 
the floor, the junior Senator from Con-
necticut, with a lot of these argu-
ments. And I respect him, a thoughtful 
voice on foreign policy. I don’t always 
agree with him, but he is a serious 
voice. But his arguments on this issue 
right now are not very persuasive or 
powerful. Here is the thing he is saying 
right now: This isn’t about Russia. I 
am quoting Senator MURPHY. This is 
about ‘‘a Cruz-Trump agenda to break 
up the Atlantic alliance.’’ A Cruz- 
Trump agenda to break up the Atlantic 
alliance. 
Now, look, he is clearly trying to 
make a boogeyman here, the so-called 
Cruz-Trump agenda. But serious people 
who have been working on these issues 
for decades know that what we are 
doing today is a continuation of long- 
term bipartisan support for really im-
portant energy security policy for the 
United States and our European allies. 
This is continuing that longstanding 
approach. 
You know, in his quote on the Cruz- 
Trump agenda, he said: This is actually 
about keeping the Atlantic relation-
ship going to ‘‘save Ukraine from an 
invasion.’’ To save Ukraine from an in-
vasion. 
But 
where 
is 
the 
President 
of 
Ukraine on this issue? What does the 
President of Ukraine, who knows a lit-
tle bit about power politics and Putin, 
think about what we are doing today? 
He supports sanctions. He supports 
sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
That is where Senator MURPHY
is 
starting to dig a little deeper on his 
weak arguments and trying to provide 
cover for his colleagues who are going 
to change their vote. He had to respond 
on 
where 
President 
Zelensky 
of 
Ukraine was. Here is what Senator 
MURPHY said about that: 
I’m a big supporter of President Zelenskyy. 
But often he misreads American politics. 
And I think it would have been better for 
him to have stayed out of this one. 
Wow. 
So, as to the leader of the country, 
right here, whom many of us think this 
is all about, who certainly knows what 
Russian energy power politics are 
about since he has been on the pointy 
end of that weapon many times, we 
now have a Senator saying: President 
Zelensky, sit down. Be quiet. Stay out 
of this one. We don’t want to hear from 
you even though this is about ‘‘saving’’ 
your country—unless, of course, you 
support his position on Nord Stream 2. 
So these are very weak arguments by 
the Senator from Connecticut. 
The most legitimate argument I have 
heard some of my Democratic friends 
make on switching their vote on their 
previous Nord Stream 2 sanctions is 
that the Germans—a very important 
ally; we all agree on that—don’t want 
us to apply Nord Stream 2 sanctions. 
OK. That is an argument we should all 
consider, and this is what I have heard 
Secretary Blinken and National Secu-
rity Advisor Sullivan have been telling 
Senators this week as they lobby 
against this vote we are going to take, 
although, early in the year, it was re-
ported in the press that both of them 
actually supported Nord Stream 2 sanc-
tions. 
Here is the thing on that argument. 
It is actually hard to tell what the Ger-
mans really want. In fact, what the 
Germans really want seems to be 
changing by the hour. There was a re-
cent change in government in Ger-
many, and the new Foreign Minister 
herself has said that the country 
should not grant Nord Stream 2 regu-
latory approval in order to resist ‘‘Rus-
sian blackmail’’ on energy prices. This 
is the current Foreign Minister of Ger-
many. 
It is also important to remember 
where the rest of the European Union 
is. There is broad opposition in Europe 
on Nord Stream 2. The European Par-
liament voted last year, on an over-
whelming, cross-party basis—581 to 
50—in favor of canceling the entire 
project in the wake of the arrest of 
Alexei Navalny, a Russian democracy 
leader whom Putin first tried to kill 
before locking away in prison. The Eu-
ropean Parliament has voted at least 
four further times on other resolutions 
to call on the EU to halt this very 
project, which is what we are looking 
to vote on today. 
Finally, outsourcing this very impor-
tant foreign policy, national security, 
American issue to the Germans is sim-
ply not wise. The Germans have not al-
ways been so clean or levelheaded when 
it comes to Russian gas, Gazprom, and 
Nord Stream 2. What am I talking 
about? Well, of course, I am talking 
about the former Chancellor of Ger-
many, Gerhard Schroder—one of the 
biggest betrayers of the West, cer-
tainly, in the last century. He left his 
chancellorship 
to 
become 
Putin’s 
Gazprom lapdog. He is the main lob-
byist who is pushing Russian gas all 
over Germany and Europe. He is an em-
barrassment to the Atlantic Alliance. 
He has been the chairman for many 
years of Gazprom. This is the former 
Chancellor of Germany. Of course, he 
has influenced Germans to say this is 
good. He has made millions doing it, by 
the way. He should be sanctioned with 
other Putin cronies. 
At the end of the day, this shouldn’t 
be outsourced to Germany. What we 
need to do is to take a vote on what is 
right for American national security, 
and a vote that sanctions this pipeline 
would be consistent with long-term, 
very bipartisan, American-Eurasian en-
ergy security policy. 
Make no mistake, my colleagues: 
Nord Stream 2 is Putin’s pipeline. Let’s 
not make it his lifeline. I encourage all 
of my colleagues to do what they have 
done recently, in the last couple of 
years, which is to vote in an over-
whelming, bipartisan manner to sanc-
tion the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S212 
January 13, 2022 
from Arizona for an extraordinary 
stand of courage and just a great 
speech on the floor a few minutes ago. 
I rise today to defend the filibuster 
again from the latest round of attacks. 
I did this repeatedly in the last admin-
istration, earning the ire and frustra-
tion of a President of my own party 
over and over again as I defended the 
Senate’s 
purpose 
and 
the 
super-
majority requirements that forge a 
consensus in a big, broad, diverse, con-
tinental nation. Today, I rise to defend 
the filibuster again when it is a Presi-
dent of the other party who has decided 
to go full demagogue. 
For his entire career in the Senate— 
basically, Joe Biden served in this body 
as long as I have been alive, plus or 
minus a few years—Joe Biden was a 
stalwart defender of the filibuster. He 
said that weakening the filibuster 
would ‘‘eviscerate the Senate.’’ But 
earlier this week, the President was 
pushed around by a bunch of rage-ad-
dicted 20-somethings on his staff and 
agreed to go down to Georgia and just 
read whatever nonsense they loaded 
into his teleprompter. It was shameful. 
It was sad. 
The President of the United States 
called half of the country a bunch of 
racist bigots. Think about that—half 
the country a bunch of racist bigots. 
He doesn’t believe that. This was a se-
nile comment of a man who read what-
ever was loaded into his teleprompter. 
His speechwriters puppet-mastered 
him into saying that anyone who dis-
agrees with him is George Wallace, 
Bull Connor, Jefferson Davis. If you 
disagree with Joe Biden, you are Jef-
ferson Davis. It is pretty breathtaking. 
Equating millions of Americans to 
some of the ugliest racists in all of 
American history isn’t just overheated 
rhetoric; it is a disgusting smear. Does 
President Biden really believe this in 
his heart of hearts? Based on the con-
versations I have had with him over 
the years, I don’t think he believes this 
at all. 
So let’s go back to last year. Can-
didate Joe Biden ran for office, prom-
ising that he would unify the country. 
That is why the man was elected—be-
cause he said that the crap we went 
through the last 4 years was wrong. He 
said he was going to try to unify the 
country, but now he has decided to sur-
render to a tiny, little far-left group in 
the mistaken belief that the loudest 
voices on Twitter actually represent 
America. 
It would be useful for us to pause and 
recognize that the overwhelming ma-
jority of all political tweets in America 
come from less than 11⁄2
percent of 
Americans. Let’s just say that again 
because there are a bunch of morons 
around this building who have decided 
to take their Twitter feed as reality. It 
is not reality. 
What the President said in Georgia 
was nonsense, and Joe Biden, with his 
decades in the U.S. Senate, knows that. 
The President will be coming to Cap-
itol Hill in the next hour. If President 
Biden really believes that Jim Crow is 
the same thing as a lot of States that 
have decided to reconsider some of 
their COVID expansion policies around 
voting—that Jim Crow and redelib-
erating about COVID expansions are 
the same thing—he needs to make that 
argument in person. 
If JOE MANCHIN is really as big a rac-
ist as Joe Biden apparently thinks and 
if KYRSTEN SINEMA is really a racist—if 
that 
is 
what 
animates 
KYRSTEN 
SINEMA—in the eyes of Joe Biden, he 
should have the courage to say that to 
their faces. He is not going to say that 
to their faces because he doesn’t be-
lieve it. Ron Klain has an army of 
Twitter trolls that he has decided are 
reality, and he has decided to have 
President 
Biden 
become 
something 
completely different than the person 
who ran for office last year or who 
served for decades in the U.S. Senate. 
In fact, if Joe Biden really believes 
that JOE MANCHIN and KYRSTEN SINEMA 
are bigots, why has he not called for 
them to be kicked out of his party? If 
they are as racist as Bull Connor and 
Jefferson Davis, why does Joe Biden 
want them in his party? 
The stuff he said in Georgia is non-
sense, and you wouldn’t say it to reg-
ular Americans in New Jersey or West 
Virginia or Arizona or Nebraska be-
cause it is not true. 
In fact, if Joe Biden really believes 
that LISA MURKOWSKI is George Wal-
lace, if TIM SCOTT is Bull Connor, if 
SUSAN
COLLINS
and I are Jefferson 
Davis, I would hope he would have the 
guts to come and say it to our faces, 
but 
he 
will 
not 
because 
this 
is 
performative politics. It was nonsense, 
and everybody knows that it goes away 
after this weekend. 
But CHUCK SCHUMER might have a 
primary from AOC, so it is really use-
ful to shift the blame for his disastrous 
leadership of the Senate over the last 
13 months from himself to KYRSTEN 
SINEMA and JOE MANCHIN. That is real-
ly what is happening right now. 
President Biden ought to have the 
courage to stand up to his own staff, 
and he ought to be enough of a man to 
apologize to the Senate and to the 
American people for the nonsense he 
said in Georgia. The vast majority of 
what he said in violating the Ninth 
Commandment and disparaging people 
was not what he really believes, and he 
wouldn’t say it to me face-to-face. This 
fiasco was ugly, and it was entirely un-
necessary. 
It makes no sense to federalize our 
elections right now. By the way, you 
can differ with me about that. You can 
believe that federalizing all elections is 
a good idea—it is in our constitutional 
system—but to demonize people as rac-
ist bigots because they are not in favor 
of federalizing the elections is a pretty 
bizarre leap. 
So let’s just review a little bit of his-
tory. Last year, we had a President 
who disgraced his office by trying to 
steal an election. What stopped that? 
Our decentralized State-based systems 
of elections are what stopped last 
year’s attempt to steal an election. 
It makes absolutely no sense to try 
to go into nuclear partisanship now 
when we should actually be talking 
about how you prevent another Janu-
ary 6 by doing the hard and actual bi-
partisan work—not the grandstanding 
for Twitter but the hard and bipartisan 
work of reforming the Electoral Count 
Act, which is 130 years old and obvi-
ously doesn’t work that well. We 
should reform the Electoral Reform 
Act. 
This is about the subversion of an 
election, not the suppression. There are 
real problems in our electoral system, 
and we could be doing work to actually 
fix that and try to stop the institu-
tional arsonists in Congress who want 
to build political brands on the wreck-
age of American institutions. We could 
do real work. The President decided to 
do something completely different this 
week. 
Here is the silver lining. President 
Biden, Leader SCHUMER, and everybody 
in this body know that the charade we 
have been going through for the last 3 
days is great for the 11⁄2 percent of peo-
ple addicted to rage on Twitter. I get 
it. There are 11⁄2 percent of people who 
get their jollies out of this. It is bad for 
America, and it is just as undermining 
of the public trust in elections as what 
Donald Trump did last year. 
But here is the thing: Everybody 
going through this charade knows that 
it dies this weekend. Why? Because 
Members of the Democrats’ own con-
ference know that there is no exception 
to the way the Senate rules work. 
Every single Senator knows that the 
filibuster is not going to die this week-
end, and every Senator knows that, if 
it would, the nonsense rhetoric about 
one exception—it is like losing your 
virginity just once—is not really how 
it works. Once the filibuster goes for x, 
it goes for y, and it goes for z. Today, 
it is election centralization. Tomorrow, 
it is gun politics. The next day, it is 
climate debates. Every red-hot issue in 
American culture and American poli-
tics would be in the same exception be-
cause every issue would be just as ur-
gent next week, next month, and next 
year. 
Fortunately, Senator MANCHIN knows 
this, Senator SINEMA knows this, and 
by the way, a whole bunch more col-
leagues of mine in the Democratic 
Party also know this. They just don’t 
have as much courage to say it in pub-
lic as those two. A whole bunch of my 
colleagues—I tried to count this morn-
ing; it is between 15 and 18 of my col-
leagues in the Democratic Party—have 
privately told me they regret following 
Harry Reid over the tribalist cliff in 
the summer of 2013 for just the one ex-
ception of judicial confirmations to the 
DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I think 15 
to 18 Democrats have privately told me 
they regret this. Why? Because that 
one-time exception is now how the en-
tire Executive Calendar works. Every-
body knew, when Harry Reid set this

place on fire in 2013, that that was 
what it was going to produce and that 
the exact same thing would happen on 
the legislative calendar with the sup-
posed one-time carve-out for the legis-
lative filibuster. 
Let’s remember what this institution 
is for. What the Senate is supposed to 
be about is we are supposed to be the 
one part of Congress and the one part 
of the American Government that 
thinks beyond a 24-month window. It is 
the job of the people who serve in this 
body—only 100 people right now and 
only, I think, 2,100 people across 230- 
some years of U.S. history. Only 2,000 
people have had the honor of serving 
our States in this body. It is supposed 
to be our job to take the long-term 
view, not just 24 hours of Twitter. We 
are supposed to think beyond the 24 
months of the next election. That is 
what our job is supposed to be. 
There are a lot of people around this 
place who apparently can’t think be-
yond 24 hours right now. That is their 
right, but they shouldn’t be Senators 
because the purpose of this place is 
supposed to be to take a long-term 
view. 
Some of my colleagues are convinced 
that Americans are polarized because 
Congress doesn’t act more or faster, 
and they think that the solution is, 
supposedly, to eliminate the filibuster. 
They are kidding themselves. That 
would not extinguish the fires of red- 
hot tribalism in this country. It would 
throw gasoline on them. Addressing 
the real tribal disease in America re-
quires a Senate that becomes less trib-
al, not more tribal. 
Senator SINEMA’s speech should be 
commended to every Member of this 
body to go back and read. She said 
there are two fundamental questions 
before us today. One is, Where does the 
descent into tribalism in this institu-
tion ultimately land? And what can 
each of us do to stop that? 
Those are the two big questions that 
she said should be before us today. 
Getting rid of the filibuster means 
this: It means that you turn one razor- 
thin majority imposing its will on the 
American people and on legislation 
into 
a 
pendulum-swinging, 
another 
razor-thin majority, 24 months later, 
that sweeps all of that aside and jerks 
the American people around to the op-
posite legislation of what was just 
passed 50–50—51–50 in today’s Senate. 
And all of it flips 11 months from now, 
and the legislation all gets undone, and 
new legislation gets put in place. 
Do you really think regular folks in 
New Jersey and Nebraska want that? 
Hardly any of them want that. 
Imagine what the current situation 
would look like if you have that feder-
ally imposed whiplash on our most sen-
sitive issues inside every 24 months. We 
think tribalism is bad now. I guarantee 
you can make it worse. And elimi-
nating the filibuster accelerates that 
descent into tribalism. 
There is a place, of course, where 
simple majorities rule. It is right down 
that hallway. We have a House of Rep-
resentatives already. Does anybody 
want to make the argument that that 
place is healthier than we are because 
it is a simple majoritarian body? No, it 
is 
plain 
to 
see, 
in 
an 
age 
of 
hyperpartisanship and social media 
grandstanding, that the House is being 
more and more ruled by demagogues 
and dolts. That is not what the Senate 
is called to do. 
The Senate is supposed to be a dif-
ferent place. The Senate is supposed to 
be the place where passions are tem-
pered and refined by people who are re-
sponsible for thinking beyond our next 
election, which is why every election 
cycle in America only has one-third of 
Senators even up for reelection. That is 
the whole reason we have 6-year terms. 
If I had my will, I could be King for a 
day and write some constitutional 
amendments and pass them. I would 
have a single 12-year Senate term, and 
everybody would be out of here. It is a 
little bit longer than 6 years, but one 
term, no reelection, and get back to 
life, go back to serving in your commu-
nity. 
If you get rid of the filibuster, you 
will turn the Senate into the House, 
and you will ensure that this body, too, 
ends up consumed by demagogues, 
conspiracists, and clowns. That is what 
will happen in this body. The American 
people don’t have time for that crap. 
Nobody wants that. 
Americans don’t want one-party rule, 
by the Democrats or by the Repub-
licans. Both of these parties are really 
crappy. The American people are not 
fans of these political parties. 
Getting rid of the filibuster means 
you don’t have to try to talk to people 
on the other side of the aisle and get to 
a 60-vote threshold for legislation or a 
67-vote threshold for rules changes. It 
means that one of these two terrible 
parties gets to do a lot more stuff a lot 
faster that will inevitably be incred-
ibly unpopular with the American peo-
ple. 
The American people do not want 
revolution. They do not want funda-
mental change. What they want is 
competence. What they want is more 
honesty. 
What 
they 
want 
is 
less 
performative grandstanding. 
Institutions like the Senate provide 
frameworks and processes for com-
petent, 
responsible 
self-government, 
for more honesty. We are not living up 
to it right now, but we could live down 
to something worse, and ending the fil-
ibuster would accelerate that. It would 
accelerate tribalism. It would accel-
erate people following Senators into 
bathrooms, screaming at them, trying 
to bully them. It will not lead to more 
productive, 
compromise 
legislation 
that tries to bring along a larger share 
of the American public. 
The rules and the norms of this place 
have been built up over a very long 
time, and they exist to discourage dem-
agoguery. Putting cameras in every 
room we are in around here tries to un-
dermine so much of what the Senate is 
about. I am for lots of transparency. I 
am for pen-and-pad reporters every-
where. But the cameras we have put in 
this place have encouraged so much 
demagoguery. That is so much of the 
problem of why we have so much trib-
alism here and tribalism more broadly 
in the country. 
And if you eliminate the filibuster, 
you accelerate all those most destruc-
tive, short-term performative trends. 
You encourage more rank partisanship, 
and you discourage consensus, com-
promise, and collaboration. 
Friends, 
please 
do 
not—like 
the 
President did in Georgia this week— 
surrender to the angriest voices on so-
cial media in the mistaken belief that 
they reflect the majority of America. 
They don’t. They reflect the majority 
of Twitter. 
Political Twitter is like the ninth 
most popular topic on Twitter. K-pop 
music is exponentially more popular on 
Twitter than politics. The share of 
Americans paying attention to polit-
ical Twitter bounces around between 
one-tenth and one-sixth. And some-
thing like 80 percent of all political 
tweets come from under 2 percent of 
the public. We should remind ourselves 
of that again, and again, and again, be-
cause there are people here who regu-
larly mistake Twitter with reality and 
with the American public. We are 
called to serve the American public. 
We are not called to serve rage-ad-
dicted people on social media. 
Now, perhaps more than ever, it is 
our job to stop giving ear to political 
arsonists who would burn down our in-
stitutions and intensify our divisions. 
Now is the time for us to think to-
gether over the long-term how we 
renew those institutions. 
The filibuster is a part of what can 
lead us to broader consensus, and 
eliminating the filibuster will accel-
erate the political arson around this 
place and across our land. 
Senate, we can do better.

January 13, 2022 
weapons are arriving every day. Putin 
yearns to reassemble the old Soviet 
Union. Putin would see Ukraine wiped 
off the face of the map. 
This is not the first time that the 
people of Ukraine have had to face 
down 
Russian 
aggression 
and 
authoritarianism. Throughout the Cold 
War and through their independence in 
1991, millions of Ukrainians died as 
they struggled for independence from 
the Soviet Union and from Soviet Rus-
sia. 
In 1994, the United States signed the 
Budapest Memorandum on Security 
Assurances. We committed—the United 
States of America committed—to en-
suring Ukraine’s territorial integrity 
in exchange for Ukraine voluntarily 
giving up the world’s third largest nu-
clear arsenal, which it had inherited 
following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. That was our commitment, and 
it is now our national obligation. 
Russia, of course, also signed the Bu-
dapest Memorandum. Nevertheless, in 
2014, thousands of Ukrainians died 
when Putin invaded Ukraine. 
Putin only stopped short of a full in-
vasion because he couldn’t endanger 
the Ukrainian energy infrastructure, 
which he needs to get Russian gas to 
Europe. He now believes that Nord 
Stream 2 is a done deal, thanks to 
President Biden’s catastrophic sur-
render and waiving of the mandatory 
sanctions passed by Congress. 
Putin sees Nord Stream 2 as an alter-
nate route to get his gas to Europe 
that Ukraine cannot touch, and so he 
has 
moved 
to 
complete 
what 
he 
couldn’t do in 2014. When President 
Biden waived the sanctions on this 
Russian pipeline, the governments of 
Ukraine and Poland warned then that 
the result would be Russian troops on 
the border of Ukraine and an imminent 
invasion. They were right. 
In 
recent 
weeks, 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine and their government—the 
President, the Prime Minister, the 
Speaker of the Parliament—they have 
all called on this body to fulfill the 
commitment that we made to their na-
tion. They have explicitly and repeat-
edly called upon the U.S. Senate to 
pass this bill before us, imposing im-
mediate sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
None of us can know if that will 
change Putin’s calculation, but we 
must acknowledge, as the people of 
Ukraine have pleaded with us to under-
stand, that it is the only thing that can 
do so. 
That is why today, in just a few min-
utes, we will have one last chance to 
stop the pipeline that Putin built so he 
can invade Ukraine. For 2 years, this 
body has had bipartisan consensus and 
unanimity on standing up to Russia on 
stopping Nord Stream 2. It is only with 
a Democrat in the White House that 
suddenly scores of Democrats have de-
cided partisan loyalty is more impor-
tant than standing up to Russia; par-
tisan loyalty is more important than 
stopping Putin; partisan loyalty is 
more important than standing with our 
European people allies. And, I would 
note, ironically, the White House’s lead 
talking point is ‘‘transatlantic unity.’’ 
When the Parliament voted on Nord 
Stream 2, it voted to condemn and shut 
down Nord Stream 2 by a vote of 581 to 
50—581 to 50. The White House is say-
ing: Stand with the 50. Stand with 9 
percent of the European Parliament 
against 91 percent of the European Par-
liament. 
That makes no sense, and no Demo-
crat uttering those talking points be-
lieves it. But there are too many 
Democrats who are deciding partisan 
loyalty matters more than standing 
with our allies. Partisan loyalty means 
more than standing with our European 
friends. Partisan loyalty means more 
than honoring our treaty commit-
ments. Partisan loyalty matters more 
than protecting the national security 
of the United States. 
For 5 years, Democrats have uttered 
the words: Russia, Russia, Russia. We 
will now learn whether they meant 
those words when they said them, or 
was that simply animus for President 
Trump? 
We should stand together. If a Repub-
lican were in the White House, every 
Democrat in this Chamber would vote 
to sanction Nord Stream 2. The only 
reason not to do so is because, for some 
Democrats, partisan loyalty matters 
more than standing up to Russia or de-
fending our national security. 
Let me, finally, say: If the Senate 
votes down these sanctions in just a 
few minutes, it will effectively give a 
green light to Putin. That is what the 
leaders of civil society in Ukraine have 
told us. And if, as a result of the Sen-
ate’s vote, the Democrats vote with 
Russia, with Putin, we may well see in 
the days or weeks or few months ahead 
Russian tanks in the streets of Kiev. 
And every Senator—Democrat or Re-
publican—will remember this moment, 
this moment we had to stop the Rus-
sian invasion of Ukraine. And those 
Senators who put our obligations to 
our friends, our obligations to our Na-
tion, our obligations to security above 
partisan loyalty, they will remember 
that. And those Senators that didn’t, 
they will remember that. 
The eyes of history are on the Sen-
ate. There are moments, particularly 
dealing with war and peace, when the 
consequences 
of 
our 
actions 
echo 
throughout the days. This moment is 
one of them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 5 minutes, followed by 
Senator MENENDEZ to speak for up to 
10 minutes, before the scheduled roll-
call vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right 
to object, I am sorry, I didn’t hear the 
unanimous consent request. 
Mr. RISCH. I think it was just a 
minute or 2 for you and the rest for me, 
Senator. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. And I object to 
that. 
Mr. RISCH. I would ask for 5 minutes 
for myself and 10 minutes for yourself. 
Is that sufficient? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow 
citizens, I rise today to speak on behalf 
of the Cruz-Risch Nord Stream 2 bill, 
which is designated as S. 3436. To start 
with, it is important to note that this 
bill has language which is almost iden-
tical to the bipartisan language that 
was contained in the House-passed Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. Both 
bodies passed this language. It was, un-
fortunately, taken out in the con-
ference of that bill before it went to 
the White House. But now, this lan-
guage is back before us in this bill. And 
what it would do is it would imme-
diately 
sanction 
Nord 
Stream 
2— 
Putin’s premier energy weapon against 
Europe and Ukraine, particularly. 
The timing could not be more impor-
tant. Ukraine stands on the brink of 
invasion, and Europe is in the throes of 
an energy crisis created by Russia. 
There is a reason Ukraine’s President 
Zelensky tweeted an urgent request in 
December for all friends of Ukraine and 
Europe in the U.S. Senate to back 
these sanctions. That request is before 
us at this moment. 
We are now seeing the consequences 
of the administration’s decision to 
waive P.E.E.S.A. sanctions and the re-
fusal to impose CAATSA sanctions. 
Months ago, the administration set the 
stage for this mess on Ukraine’s border 
and emboldened Putin. 
Russia has deliberately cut gas trans-
mission to Europe through Ukraine 
and is using high energy prices to pres-
sure the European Union into approv-
ing Nord Stream 2 as quickly as pos-
sible. Putin has publicly stated that 
fact. 
Meanwhile, Russian forces continue 
their buildup along the border with 
Ukraine in preparation for what could 
be a full-scale invasion. Clearly, the 
administration’s efforts have failed to 
signal credibility and resolve and have 
not deterred Putin from continuing 
along the path to war. 
U.S. diplomacy needs additional ac-
tion, not just rhetoric, to stop a Rus-
sian invasion. And these sanctions 
would provide that by putting Congress 
in charge of waiver authority. A vote 
for these sanctions will provide credi-
bility to our threat, sending a strong 
message to Putin. 
Remember, Nord Stream 2 is de-
signed to replace Ukraine’s gas transit 
system, meaning Russia no longer has 
to worry about destroying its own in-
frastructure in the event of a full-scale 
war. We must not allow Putin’s black-
mail to succeed. 
Nord Stream 2 has always been a bi-
partisan issue here in the Senate, and 
it should continue to be. Not a single 
Member of Congress supports the com-
pletion of this pipeline. I would like to 
think a similar number of us feel we

should not ignore our friends in Eu-
rope, particularly Central and Eastern 
Europe, who stand to lose the most 
from Nord Stream 2. 
Our bill would impose mandatory 
sanctions against Nord Stream 2 AG, 
the 
company 
responsible 
for 
the 
project, as well as the companies in-
volved in testing and certifying the 
pipeline before it becomes operational. 
We do provide the administration 
with a pathway to lifting these tar-
geted sanctions, pending congressional 
review. This pathway is the exact same 
process for congressional input that 98 
Senators voted for in CAATSA, just a 
few years ago. The time to act is now. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to condemn the enormous Rus-
sian military buildup on the Ukrainian 
border, and the Kremlin’s reckless poli-
cies of coercion as it seeks to reimpose 
a new iron curtain on the European 
continent. Moscow wants to secure an 
unwarranted sphere of influence that 
would enable Russia to determine by 
fiat the fate and the policies of other 
sovereign state—most immediately in 
Ukraine, whose people and government 
desire further integration into Europe 
and trans-Atlantic institutions 
Make no mistake about it—the Putin 
regime’s actions threaten not only our 
friends in Ukraine. They are also an as-
sault on the principles of the Helsinki 
Final Act, the foundation of European 
security, which today is enshrined in 
the Organization on Security and Co-
operation in Europe, the OSCE. 
I want to commend President Biden 
and his very capable diplomatic team 
for the sustained effort they have em-
barked upon to rally our friends and al-
lies—in NATO and the European Union 
and across the OSCE—to present a 
united front against Vladimir Putin’s 
mounting aggression. 
Russia has in recent months amassed 
over 100,000 troops and heavy weaponry 
on Ukraine’s borders, with many more 
poised to join them, and have openly 
threatened war if its demands are not 
met. The Kremlin is also waging a 
propaganda war preparation strategy 
for the Russian people by broadcasting 
false claims that Ukraine poses a 
threat to Russian interests and sov-
ereignty. 
At the barrel of a gun, the Kremlin 
has demanded not only that the United 
States and NATO close its open doors 
to partners like Ukraine and Georgia— 
a strategic nonstarter on its own—but 
also that the Alliance security um-
brella and even material security as-
sistance be retracted to pre-l997 bor-
ders, essentially reducing NATO to its 
frontiers as of 1991. 
In other words, Mr. Putin insists that 
the United States and its Euro-Atlan-
tic allies remove any means of securing 
or guaranteeing the defense of sov-
ereign states that happen to lie near 
Russia. Such demands are outrageous, 
dangerous, and impossible to accept. 
In this troubling time, acquiescence 
to Russian aggression is not an option. 
I support this administration’s ap-
proach to unite with our European al-
lies and categorically refuse to give 
into the Kremlin’s ruthless militarism. 
I also support negotiating in good faith 
to see if we can find a realistic solution 
with respect to arms control, con-
fidence-building 
measures, 
and 
the 
like—while making it clear to Mr. 
Putin 
that 
the 
freedom 
and 
sov-
ereignty of Europe are not on the 
table. 
The diplomatic engagements that 
have taken place in Europe in recent 
days, in several concentric circles, 
have demonstrated remarkable unity 
among our allies, and have clarified for 
Russia the costs they would incur in 
the event of any further aggression 
against Ukraine. 
This is thanks to the Biden adminis-
tration’s sophisticated campaign to re-
claim American leadership in world af-
fairs. 
One hopes the Kremlin has heard the 
messages that we and our allies have 
sent to Moscow. Under the looming 
shadow of Russian mass mobilization 
and martial rhetoric, however, we 
should suffer no illusions. Mr. Putin’s 
goal is domination, and there is no 
room to give on that score. 
Unfortunately, we find ourselves here 
today on the floor of the United States 
to consider a measure, which the Sen-
ator from Texas has introduced, that 
threatens to undermine the American 
effort to mobilize the Western world’s 
coalition to stand up to Russia at this 
critical moment. We are here to de-
bate, yet again, how to deal with Nord 
Stream 2, the ill-conceived natural gas 
pipeline between Russia and Germany 
that promises to weaken Ukraine’s eco-
nomic and security situation while it 
strengthens 
Russia’s 
leverage 
over 
Western Europe. 
In the ll6th Congress, we voted to 
condemn and to sanction those in-
volved in this misbegotten enterprise— 
most importantly in the Protecting 
Europe’s 
Energy 
Security 
Act, 
‘‘PEESA’’, enacted in January 2021. 
This law imposes strong sanctions on 
all those involved in the construction 
and operation of the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. As is customary and appro-
priate, the Congress also gave the Ex-
ecutive the authority to waive sanc-
tions against individuals and entities 
when it determined to do so would be 
in the national security interest of the 
United States. 
Last spring, the administration chose 
to exercise that walver. 
I disagreed with that decision. I have 
said so many times and in many con-
texts. I retain the hope that the pipe-
line will never begin operations, as I 
believe it would do enormous damage— 
not just to Ukraine—but also to Europe 
at large. 
The administration is focused on 
working with Germany to implement 
the July 21 Joint Statement of the 
United States and Germany on Support 
for Ukraine, Energy Security, and Our 
Climate Goals, which includes clear 
commitments to act if Russia attempts 
to use energy as a weapon or commit 
further 
aggressive 
acts 
against 
Ukraine. 
Let us be clear that the bill before us 
would not actually accomplish what 
the Senator from Texas claims. It 
would not stop Nord Stream 2 any 
more than existing law does. It would 
not protect Ukraine any more than ex-
isting law and policy does. All this bill 
would do, essentially, is create a 90-day 
recurring cycle of revisiting the admin-
istration’s exercise of the waiver au-
thority we wrote into the law last year. 
And then it would create the option for 
a vote on a resolution of disapproval of 
that waiver. 
At a time when we should be using 
our time and energy to address the 
mounting threat to Ukraine posed by 
Russia’s massive buildup along their 
shared border, today’s vote is an un-
necessary distraction. Therefore, I op-
pose S. 3436. 
The Senate should be considering se-
rious proposals to counter Russian ag-
gression. The chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee has in-
troduced a bill that is worthy of our 
time, attention, and support. The De-
fending Ukraine Sovereignty Act is a 
serious effort to address Russia’s ag-
gression toward Ukraine, which is why 
I am an original cosponsor of this 
measure. 
If the President affirmatively deter-
mines that Russia has engaged in a re-
newed invasion or escalation of hos-
tilities, the Defending Ukraine Sov-
ereignty Act triggers a cascade of man-
datory sanctions on Russia’s political 
and military leadership, financial in-
stitutions, extractive industries—and 
Nord Stream 2. 
As chairman of the U.S. Helsinki 
Commission and a senior member of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, I am especially mindful and 
concerned about what Russia’s actions 
and demands mean for European and 
international security, as well as de-
mocracy and human rights. 
It is no mistake that Mr. Putin’s war 
drums have been accompanied by a 
concerted regime effort to erase and re-
write the Soviet Union’s cruel history; 
including 
smothering 
the 
domestic 
human 
rights 
network 
Memorial, 
which has so carefully and painstak-
ingly chronicled the Soviet Union’s 
brutal human and social toll on the 
people of Russia and the former Soviet 
Union. 
Russia’s 
intervention 
to 
suppress 
popular dissent and prop up the author-
itarian regime in Belarus tells a simi-
lar story. Its deployment of troops just 
last week under the umbrella of the 
Collective Security Treaty Organiza-
tion, the CSTO, to quell public unrest 
in Kazakhstan—the first time the Rus-
sian-controlled CSTO has intervened 
militarily in a crisis in a member 
state—also serves to expand Russian 
influence in the region. The CSTO de-
ployment has raised concerns among

some of the Kazakhstani public, which 
may help to explain why the troops 
have started withdrawing today. The 
rapid deployment, however, certainly 
makes the government of Kazakhstan 
more beholden to Russia. It weakens 
Kazakhstan’s often-touted ‘‘multi-vec-
tor’’ policy under which it aims to bal-
ance its relations with Russia, China, 
and the West. 
The Putin regime has erected a cor-
rupt police state at home, which it ag-
gressively exports for greater domin-
ion. 
A 
broader 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine could easily lead to tens of 
thousands of deaths and threaten tens 
of millions more. Preventing such an 
outcome should be our paramount con-
cern. Peace on Russia’s stated terms 
would consign millions of free peoples 
to the Kremlin’s authoritarian whims, 
and would shatter the fragile miracle 
of European peace and prosperity. 
I believe we must present a strong, 
determined, and unified response that 
makes clear that Russian aggression 
will only further unify the continent, 
and complicate the Kremlin’s security 
anxieties. 
At the same time, the United States 
is willing, with its partners and allies, 
to work toward listening to the Krem-
lin’s 
legitimate 
security 
concerns. 
Here, too, is an opportunity to make 
use of the OSCE’s institutional powers 
to build consensus and lay the founda-
tions for a durable peace. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
condemning Russia’s military buildup 
and aggressive posture in the region, 
and calling for Moscow to de-escalate 
immediately and negotiate in good 
faith. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
complete my remarks before the vote 
begins. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this 
is a pivotal week for the security of 
Ukraine. Talks are ongoing to test 
whether the Kremlin wants to engage 
in diplomacy or is intent on war, to see 
if the United States and our allies can 
pull Putin back from the brink. And if 
the headlines are any indication this 
morning, it is clear that this is an open 
question. 
This is a critical time. There still 
may be a window to deter the Kremlin 
from deciding to invade. But we must 
be clear and united about what awaits 
Russia if it chooses the unwise path. 
We must send an unequivocal message: 
that, should Putin invade, the con-
sequences would be devastating; that 
there would be steep costs to the econ-
omy and to the people of Russia if he 
further tramples on Ukraine’s territory 
and independence. 
That message should be sent through 
every channel, at every level, including 
by this body. And we have a chance to 
do just that. 
The Defending Ukraine Sovereignty 
Act, which has in just 2 short days 39 
cosponsors already, is a comprehensive 
response to the threat facing Ukraine. 
It would impose massive, crippling 
sanctions on multiple sectors of Rus-
sia’s economy. It would impose the 
harshest sanctions on Putin and senior 
Kremlin officials themselves. It would 
effectively cut Russia off from the 
international financial system. That is 
the sanction that I helped devise that 
ultimately brought Iran, years ago, to 
the negotiating table. 
This act also makes clear that the 
United States will make every effort to 
expedite security assistance and de-
fense articles to help support Ukraine. 
And it expands our efforts to counter 
Kremlin aggression across the region. 
It says the United States will not stand 
for this bullying. And it makes clear 
that Putin has a choice to make. 
But we are not voting on that com-
prehensive response. We are not voting 
on how severe the consequences should 
be if Putin goes down the path of inva-
sion. Instead, we are voting on whether 
to sanction Nord Stream 2—as if that 
alone would deter Putin from re-
invading, as if that alone would stop 
him. 
Instead, sanctioning Nord Stream 
now at this pivotal moment would have 
the opposite effect of deterring Putin. 
It might even be the excuse Putin is 
looking for. Right now, the one thing 
we know Putin wants is for Nord 
Stream 2 to be operational. 
Now, let’s be clear. If we don’t sanc-
tion Nord Stream now, that does not 
mean the pipeline goes online. It does 
not mean that Putin get his way. What 
it does mean is that there is leverage. 
Right now, we have a new German 
Government that has blocked the pipe-
line from moving forward. Right now, 
that German Government is a produc-
tive partner with us on this critical 
issue. They are where we need them to 
be—working to coerce Putin not to re-
invade Ukraine; making clear that if 
Putin advances into Ukraine, there 
will be no Nord Stream; working with 
us to strengthen and support strong de-
terrence; coordinating with us to en-
hance the impact of devastating sanc-
tions, if we need to pull that trigger. 
That is where we need the German 
Government to be. 
Sanctioning Nord Stream now, in the 
way that the Cruz bill would do, would 
not just be a sanction on Nord Stream 
2 AG. The bill would sanction ‘‘any cor-
porate officer of an entity established 
for or responsible for the planning, con-
struction, or operation of the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline’’ or a successor enti-
ty. 
This broad scope would have a clear 
ripple effect on the entities, many of 
them German, and individuals, many of 
them German citizens, who work on 
the pipeline. That includes German 
companies involved in the pipeline, in-
dustrial sites, rail operators, port oper-
ators, and any entity associated with 
that deal. 
So for an ally that is with us in this 
fight against Putin’s aggression, for an 
ally that is standing up with us when 
we need them to be strong, this would 
be akin to a sanction on them. They 
have made that clear to us. Now is not 
the time to take that step. 
Again, the pipeline today is paused. 
They basically stopped the regulatory 
process on it. At the earliest, it could 
be months before anything happens, de-
pending upon what Putin does—depend-
ing upon what Putin does—and even if 
they allow it to move forward. Now is 
not the time to take off the table a key 
piece of leverage. 
I have to address some other points I 
have heard some of our colleagues 
mention. 
I listened to the Senator from Texas 
attempt to lay blame time and time 
and time again at the feet of President 
Biden. He has tried to blame President 
Biden for Nord Stream, and now he is 
trying to blame him for Putin’s illegit-
imate power-grabbing and military ag-
gression. Do you know what? I suggest 
he look back and review just how and 
when Nord Stream came to be because 
it wasn’t President Biden who could 
have imposed sanctions back in 2017. It 
wasn’t President Biden who did noth-
ing for years while 94 percent of the 
pipeline was being built. It wasn’t 
President Biden who waited until his 
last day in office to impose sanctions 
on Nord Stream. There was someone 
else who could have used his authority 
to put a stop to this malign influence 
project but didn’t. There was someone 
else who could have made the Krem-
lin’s weaponization of energy a priority 
but didn’t. 
The Senator already knows this, but 
how can I be so sure? Because he said 
so at the time. In December of 2019, he 
said: 
I want this to be very clear, if the pipeline 
is completed, it will be the fault of the mem-
bers of this [Trump] administration who sat 
on their rear ends and didn’t exercise the 
clear power. 
The fault of the Trump administra-
tion—his words—but now, magically, it 
is President Biden’s fault. Please. A 
pipeline that was 94 percent complete 
by January of 2021—to me, that is a 
Trump-Putin pipeline. 
It may be convenient to say that 
work on the pipeline stopped until 
Biden became President, but that is 
just not the case. In fact, work stopped 
on 
the 
pipeline 
for 
6 
months—6 
months—from December of 2019 until 
the spring of 2020, because a company 
backed out of the project. But did Rus-
sia stop? No. It was working furiously 
to finish the job by retrofitting ships 
that could complete the pipeline. The 
moment that was done, the moment 
the ships were ready, pipeline construc-
tion started again. 
A 
retrofitted 
Russian 
ship, 
the 
Cherskiy, showed up in Germany in 
May of 2020, awaiting a permit by Dan-
ish authorities. The permit was ap-
proved in October of 2020. The fact that 
it received a permit was sanctionable

January 13, 2022 
by the then Trump administration. The 
Trump administration failed to act. 
On December 11, Nord Stream 2 AG 
said that the Fortuna resumed offshore 
construction activities in shallow Ger-
man waters. Nord Stream 2 AG was not 
waiting for Biden to be in office; it was 
acting. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
could and should have imposed sanc-
tions under CAATSA at that point. As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
it 
didn’t 
need 
CAATSA; it had IEEPA sanctions it 
could have imposed and chose not to. 
Now, look, my position on Nord 
Stream has been clear. I have been and 
remain strongly opposed to the pipe-
line. I supported sanction measures on 
the project when they could have had 
an impact during the Trump adminis-
tration, before hundreds of miles of 
pipe had been completed. And Presi-
dent Trump had those tools. He had 
them. We passed them overwhelmingly, 
and then we gave him more tools and 
more sanctions. What did he do? Noth-
ing. Not until his last day in office did 
he impose sanctions on Nord Stream— 
his very last day. So let’s stop with the 
games. By the time the Biden adminis-
tration took office, the pipeline was 94 
percent complete—94 percent. 
Senator CRUZ wants to stop the pipe-
line, and so do I, but it is far from clear 
that sanctions at this point, when the 
pipeline is already built, will do just 
that. In fact, it isn’t clear to me at all 
that the Senator’s proposal would even 
change the status quo. Instead, it 
would most certainly tie up this body 
and this floor so that we would be vot-
ing time and time again on resolutions 
of disapproval related to Nord Stream. 
Now, of course, I get it. I get it. I un-
derstand why the Senator would rather 
tie up this floor and hamstring the 
President’s agenda instead of voting on 
nominees or voting rights or Build 
Back Better or judges or a whole host 
of other critical elements before the 
country. But that is the reality of the 
Senator’s proposal. 
So I ask my colleagues, what is the 
urgent threat that needs addressing? Is 
it attempting to score political points 
and tie this President’s hands inten-
tionally and internationally or is it ad-
dressing the very real and potentially 
imminent 
threat 
amassing 
along 
Ukraine’s border? 
I believe we need to address the real 
threat and the whole threat facing 
Ukraine and the region, and that is 
why I drafted the Defending Ukraine 
Sovereignty Act. 
I have stood up for and alongside 
Ukraine time and time again in the 
face of Ukraine’s aggression. In 2014, I 
was in Ukraine right after Russia’s in-
vasion took place. After Russia’s ille-
gal occupation of Crimea, I drafted the 
Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which 
passed into law, to impose sanctions on 
Russia 
and 
increase 
support 
for 
Ukraine. In 2016, I introduced the 
STAND for Ukraine Act to help restore 
Ukraine sovereignty and territorial in-
tegrity in the face of Kremlin aggres-
sion. 
I will continue to ensure that the 
United States does all it can to help 
Ukraine defend itself against Putin’s 
bullying, to provide the assistance it 
needs, to support its integrity, and to 
bolster its security in the region, and I 
urge this body to do just that. 
Finally, Senator CRUZ would like to 
suggest that partisan loyalty is why we 
believe his approach at this time is 
wrong. What is wrong is to break the 
coalition we now have against Putin at 
one of the most critical times of 
Ukraine’s history. Germany is a crit-
ical part with us and ally with us to 
deter Putin. If you end Nord Stream 
today—not 
that 
this 
legislation 
would—one less reason for Putin to 
say: Well, that is gone. Why shouldn’t 
I invade anyhow? 
I urge my colleagues to address the 
actual 
imminent 
threat 
amassing 
along Ukraine’s border, to make clear 
to Putin what the massive cost of his 
actions will be. We might still be able 
to turn Putin back, but we must be 
laser-focused on what it will take to 
get him from taking one more step to-
wards Ukraine’s border. 
I urge my colleagues to actually ad-
dress the threat at hand, one that ex-
tends far beyond a pipeline but threat-
ens an entire country’s borders and the 
security of a region. It is a threat that 
demands a comprehensive, resounding 
response. That is what we will be offer-
ing in short order. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote no on 
this approach, to make sure we keep 
the unity that is essential at this time 
to deter Putin, and to work with me to 
make sure that this body sends the 
united, strong message to deter Putin, 
stand with our allies, and support 
Ukraine. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the Cruz legis-
lation. 
I yield the floor.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 
a short announcement about the sched-
ule. 
Due to the circumstances regarding 
COVID and another potentially haz-
ardous winter storm approaching the 
DC area this weekend, the Senate will 
adjourn tonight. However, we will be 
postponing recess so the Senate can 
vote on voting rights. We will return 
on Tuesday to take up the House- 
passed 
message 
containing 
voting 
rights legislation. 
Make no mistake, the U.S. Senate 
will, for the first time this Congress, 
debate voting rights legislation begin-
ning on Tuesday. Members of this 
Chamber were elected to debate and to 
vote, particularly on an issue as vital 
to the beating heart of our democracy 
as this one, and we will proceed. 
If the Senate Republicans choose ob-
struction over protecting the sacred 
right to vote, as we expect them to, the 
Senate will consider and vote on 
changing the Senate rules, as has been 
done many times before, to allow for 
the passage of voting rights legislation. 
I will close with this: If the right to 
vote is the cornerstone of our democ-
racy, then how can we, in good con-
science, allow for a situation in which 
the Republican Party can debate and

pass voter suppression laws at the 
State level with only a simple majority 
vote but not allow the U.S. Senate to 
do the same? 
In the coming days, we will confront 
this sobering question, and every Mem-
ber will go on record. 
Finally, Members should expect that 
the next State work period would begin 
on the week of January 24. 
NORD STREAM 2 
Mr. President, now on Nord Stream, 
a few minutes ago the Senate voted 
against passing legislation proposed by 
Senator CRUZ to address Nord Stream 
2. 
Probably every single one of us in 
this Chamber agrees that the United 
States must be strong in confronting 
Putin and his destabilizing tactics in 
Eastern Europe and in Ukraine. But as 
my colleagues made clear this morn-
ing, Senator CRUZ’s bill, in our opinion, 
is the wrong answer at this time to 
deter President Putin’s aggression. I 
commend my colleagues who came to 
the floor to make the case against to-
day’s misguided proposal: my friends 
Chairman MENENDEZ, Senator SHA-
HEEN, who cochairs the Senate’s NATO 
Observer Group, and Senator MURPHY. 
After today’s vote, this issue is not 
behind us. The work is not done. Presi-
dent Putin remains a threat, and we 
must address this matter. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to work with Chairman 
MENENDEZ
and Chairman BROWN
to 
support Chairman MENENDEZ’s com-
prehensive sanctions, security, and hu-
manitarian aid package. 
I believe the Menendez bill is the an-
swer and an important step in the right 
direction. But, of course, I am willing 
to consider reasonable additions and 
modifications. 
From interfering in elections to con-
ducting a plethora of cyber attacks 
that target us here in the homeland, to 
what is happening today on the border 
of Ukraine, President Putin has left no 
doubt of his desire to stir up insta-
bility. His action with respect to 
Ukraine calls for a robust and severe 
deterrent action. 
I hope my Republican colleagues will 
come forward and work with the chair 
so we can truly confront Putin’s dan-
gerous aggression.

MORNING BUSINESS 
VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, had 
there been a recorded vote, I would 
have voted ‘‘No’’ on S. Res. 490, ‘‘a res-
olution recognizing the essential work 
of United States Capitol personnel on 
the anniversary of the insurrectionist 
attack on the United States Capitol on 
January 6, 2021.’’ 
I am grateful for the service of all 
Capitol personnel who come to work 
every day to help operate the workings 
of Congress and keep Members safe. 
However, this resolution has been writ-
ten to score cheap partisan political 
points. It attacks Republicans for their 
response to COVID–19, and it contains 
falsehoods, such as the incorrect asser-
tion that the riot at the Capitol on 
January 6, 2021 was perpetuated by 
‘‘violent insurrectionists.’’ Not a single 
person from that day has been charged 
with the crime of insurrection. If we 
are going to honor Capitol Hill work-
ers—and we should—we must do so in a 
manner that focuses on their service to 
their nation, not on false narratives 
that are meant to divide us. 
I support Capitol personnel but op-
pose this resolution as written.

TRIBUTE TO ANDY BRUNELLE 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON, and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, I congratu-
late Andy Brunelle on his remarkable 
career in government service. Andy is 
retiring on January 31, 2022, after 27 
years with the U.S. Forest Service. 
For more than 20 years, Andy has 
worked with our offices in his position 
as the Capitol City Coordinator for the 
U.S. Forest Service. In this position, he 
has represented both the U.S. Forest 
Service Region 1 and Region 4 and the 
seven National Forests in Idaho as he 
has served as a liaison working with 
State and local government officials, 
agency directors, Idaho’s Congressional 
Delegation 
and 
interest 
groups 
in 
Idaho on issues of statewide concern. 
Given the importance of the natural re-
sources and species habitat on the 
more than 20 million acres of federal 
forested land in Idaho he has acted on 
behalf of, Andy has worked on many 
challenging issues over the years. This 
includes working closely with our dele-
gation concerning improving and ex-
tending the Secure Rural Schools pro-
gram, a vital resource for Idahoans. We 
thank him for his thoughtful, helpful, 
and pragmatic work for the betterment 
of our great State and country. 
Andy began working for the U.S. For-
est Service in 1995 after serving as Spe-
cial Assistant for Natural Resources in 
the Office of Idaho Governor Cecil D. 
Andrus. From 1988 to 1995, he was the 
Governor’s key staff person on a wide 
variety of natural resource issues, in-
cluding challenging issues such as 
water quality, federal lands manage-
ment, and protection of Snake River 
salmon. Additionally, he served on the 
Northwest Power Planning Council; 
Boise City Planning and Zoning Com-
mission; and City of Boise advisory 
committees. Andy also dedicates con-
siderable time to serving on boards of 
nonprofit organizations, including the 
Boise WaterShed Exhibits Environ-
mental Education Center; Idaho Envi-
ronmental 
Forum; 
Ted 
Trueblood 
Chapter of Trout Unlimited; and Harris 
Ranch Wildlife Mitigation Association. 
As we wish Andy well in his well- 
earned retirement, we express our deep 
gratitude for dedicating so much of his 
time and talents to enhancing, sus-
taining, and conserving such an essen-
tial part of our State’s treasures. 
Thank you, Andy, for your decades of 
dedicated work and skilled problem- 
solving on behalf of Idahoans, and con-
gratulations on your retirement.

REMEMBERING CALEB SHIELDS 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
like to share a few words today to 
honor an outstanding leader and friend 
of mine who recently passed away. 
Caleb Shields was the retired Chair-
man and former Councilman of the As-
siniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort 
Peck Reservation in Montana. 
We talk a lot about service in this 
body, but everyone in Congress could 
learn from how Caleb lived his life. 
He dedicated himself to service— 
service to this country, where he 
served honorably in the United States 
Navy; service to his Tribe as an elected 
leader for 24 years and as one of their 
most tireless champions; and as the au-
thor of a 500-page book on his Tribe’s 
history, he served the next generation 
of the Fort Peck Tribes and the next 
generation of Montanans who now have 
access to knowledge that won’t ever be 
forgotten. 
Caleb was widely regarded as one of 
the most influential Tribal leaders in 
the country during his tenure, a rep-
utation that was well-earned. Among 
his many achievements are his success-
ful 20-year fight to get a water pipeline 
and treatment center on the Fort Peck 
reservation. After they were built, they 
were both named in his honor, and for 
generations to come, the name Caleb 
Shields will continue to serve the Fort 
Peck Tribe. 
Less widely known were the small 
ways that Caleb showed his love and 
devotion for the Fort Peck Tribe. I am 
told that Caleb could recite the record 
of the Poplar High School basketball 
team all the way back to the 1970s. 
Caleb was devoted to that team, and 
believed strongly that basketball could 
provide hope and momentum that 
could propel the dreams of future lead-
ers. 
Caleb’s legacy, his friendship, and his 
leadership will be felt for generations. 
I want to express my deepest sympathy 
to Caleb’s wife of 58 years, Yvonne, to 
the whole Shields family, and to the 
Fort Peck Tribes for the loss of this 
great leader. Caleb made our state and 
our Nation stronger, and he will never 
be forgotten.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ROBERT J. O’BRIEN

S219 
January 13, 2022 
1964, was elected to the Board of Gov-
ernors of the Chicago Mercantile Ex-
change, a position he held continuously 
until 1977. He served as Chairman of 
the Exchange from 1967 to 1968 and was 
inducted into the FIA Futures Hall of 
Fame in 2007. 
During his tenure on the Board of 
Governors, contracts on live animals 
were successfully introduced to the 
market, representing the first in a 
wave of innovation in contract design. 
He was also involved in changing the 
structure of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange to make it more democratic 
and in revitalizing the audits and in-
vestigations department to attract new 
exchange members. 
Mr. O’Brien’s entrepreneurial spirit 
is best illustrated in his countless con-
tributions to the futures industry as he 
built the largest independent futures 
brokerage and clearing firm in the 
United States. He pioneered new indus-
try practices and created opportunity 
for others, including taking delivery of 
the first live cattle contract traded on 
the 
Chicago 
Mercantile 
Exchange, 
broadcasting the first live commodity 
report from the trading floor, and spon-
soring the first woman to work on the 
trading floor in 1966. 
The longevity of Mr. O’Brien’s career 
and the lasting success of his company 
are a testament to the focus placed on 
the relationships that have been built 
with more than 80,000 clients, his em-
ployees, and his family. Mr. O’Brien is 
survived by five children, 22 grand-
children, and 33 great grandchildren.∑

RECOGNIZING BOWLING GREEN 
UTILITY WORKERS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, during the 
early morning hours of December 11, 
2021, Kentucky endured a series of tor-
nadoes that proved to be the deadliest 
storms in the Commonwealth’s history. 
There was damage throughout South-
ern Kentucky and beyond. Roofs were 
ripped off and trees snapped like twigs, 
but in this difficult time our commu-
nity continues to come together and 
help one another. Immediately after, 
volunteers from all around Kentucky 
and even outside the Commonwealth 
showed up to help clean up the debris. 
Despite the devastation, I am reminded 
that the unbridled spirit of our Com-
monwealth shines its brightest during 
these times of adversity. 
Of the many heroes that emerged 
during this crisis were the people of 
Bowling Green Municipal Utilities who 
immediately responded to the destruc-
tion and worked collectively to restore 
electricity to countless homes. Bowling 
Green 
Municipal 
Utilities 
reported 
24,000 of its 31,500 customers were ini-
tially without power and 52 trans-
mission polls had been severely dam-
aged. By the next morning half of these 
powerless homes had their electricity 
restored. This should have been time 
for the men and women of BGMU to 
enjoy the upcoming holiday season. In-
stead, they responded to the call of 
duty, working long shifts in the freez-
ing cold. Because of their efforts, they 
were able to restore power to countless 
members of the community and pro-
vided relief to those most in need. We 
have a long road to recovery, but if we 
all display the perseverance our line-
men and Kentuckians demonstrated, 
the Commonwealth will soon be back 
better than ever. I would like to per-
sonally thank people of Bowling Green 
Municipal Utilities for their continued 
service to all the impacted commu-
nities.∑

RECOGNIZING THE EMPLOYEES OF 
5 STAR ELECTRIC 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, during the 
early morning hours of December 11, 
2021, Kentucky endured a series of tor-
nadoes that proved to be the deadliest 
storms in the Commonwealth’s history. 
There was damage throughout South-

spite the devastation, I am reminded 
that the unbridled spirit of our Com-
monwealth shines its brightest during 
these times of adversity. 
Of the many heroes that emerged 
during this crisis were the people of 5 
Star Electric who immediately re-
sponded to the destruction. 5 Star Elec-
tric sent out 140 linemen to restore the 
electrical grid, and, after a second 
storm hit Christian County later in the 
month, sent multiple crews to Hop-
kinsville to provide assistance to the 
impacted communities. 
This should have been time for the 
men and women of 5 Star Electric to 
enjoy the upcoming holiday season. In-
stead, they responded to the call of

Mr.

MANCHIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 490 
Whereas Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
once said, ‘‘If a man is called to be a street 
sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a 
Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven com-
posed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. 
He should sweep streets so well that all the 
hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 
‘Here lived a great street sweeper who did his 
job well. . .No work is insignificant. All 
labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and 
importance.’’; 
Whereas the United States Capitol (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Capitol’’) 
is the people’s house; 
Whereas January 6, 2022, is the anniversary 
of the January 6, 2021, insurrectionist attack 
on the Capitol during a joint session of Con-
gress to receive the votes of the electoral 
college; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, violent insur-
rectionists, carrying Confederate flags and 
symbols, ransacked the Capitol, and Capitol 
custodial, 
janitorial, 
and 
maintenance 
staff—the majority of whom are African 
American, Latino, or other people of color— 
were there to pick up the pieces and deserve 
eternal gratitude for their work; 
Whereas, on March 1, 2021, the Senior Sen-
ator from Minnesota introduced a resolution 
recognizing Capitol personnel and members 
of the press corps and honoring the incred-
ible and diligent work done by Capitol per-
sonnel to care for and repair the Capitol in 
the wake of the January 6 attack; 
Whereas, in the days following the January 
6 attack, the Senate rightly recognized Eu-
gene Goodman and the many officers of the 
United States Capitol Police who deserve the 
deep gratitude of the United States for put-
ting their lives on the line to protect the 
Capitol and the democratic process of the 
United States; 
Whereas Capitol custodial, janitorial, and 
maintenance staff deserve the distinct honor 
and gratitude of the United States, as they 
also put their lives on the line serving the 
republic on January 6, 2021, and over the past 
year, during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas Capitol custodial, janitorial, and 
maintenance staff and other essential work-
ers, including Restaurant Associates and 
Sodexo staff, come to work each day and do 
their jobs with skill, dedication, and dignity; 
Whereas the work of such staff is too often 
overlooked, but remains essential to the 
functioning of the Government; 
Whereas Capitol personnel of all races and 
creeds who have shown up for work during 
the pandemic, while many individuals in the 
Capitol have not taken COVID–19 seriously, 
deserve proper equipment and safe working 
conditions ; 
Whereas Capitol custodial, janitorial, and 
maintenance staff were at the Capitol on 
January 6, 2021, doing their jobs when violent 
insurrectionists stormed the building, barg-
ing into the Senate Chamber; 
Whereas the largely African American and 
Latino custodial staff and other custodial 
staff of color were left to restore dignity and 
respect to the Capitol, the Office of the Sen-
ate Parliamentarian, and many other rooms 
and hallways throughout the Capitol; 
Whereas the work of the Capitol custodial 
staff allowed Members of the Senate to re-
turn to the Senate Chamber on January 6, 
2021, to continue to certify the electoral 
votes and secure the democracy of the 
United States; 
Whereas many individuals in the United 
States were so moved by the actions of the 
Capitol custodial staff on January 6, 2021, 
that such individuals wrote thank you notes 
to the staff in the days following the attack; 
Whereas the actions of the Capitol custo-
dial, janitorial, and maintenance staff on the 
night of the January 6, 2021, attack and in 
the days and weeks following are the epit-
ome of service, love of country, and the dig-
nity of work; and 
Whereas many Capitol personnel are rep-
resented by Local Numbers 626, 658, 2910, and 
2477 of the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees, Local 23 
of UNITE HERE, and the United States Cap-
itol Police Labor Committee which advocate 
for members in the workplace: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the strength and commit-
ment of the personnel of the United States 
Capitol who bring skill and dedication to 
their work every day and who worked 
through the night on January 6, 2021, and in 
the days following to restore dignity to the 
United States Capitol and to ensure the de-
mocracy of the United States continues to 
function; 
(2) expresses gratitude for the personnel of 
the United States Capitol and the United 
States Capitol Police for their bravery and 
service to the United States; and 
(3) reaffirms its dedication to strength-
ening the rights of the personnel of the 
United States Capitol and the United States 
Capitol Police and to providing support and 
resources to ensure their health, well-being, 
safety, and protection from further attacks, 
including higher pay, collective bargaining 
rights, paid sick and vacation leave, and 
comprehensive health insurance with mental 
health resources.

SENATE RESOLUTION 491—RAISING 
AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING 
THE PREVENTION OF STALKING 
BY DESIGNATING JANUARY 2022 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
STALKING 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. 
GRASSLEY, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. CRAPO, 
Ms. HIRONO, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. DURBIN, 
and Mrs. BLACKBURN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 491 
Whereas approximately 1 in 6 women in the 
United States, at some point during her life-
time, has experienced stalking victimiza-
tion, causing her to feel very fearful or be-
lieve that she or someone close to her would 
be harmed or killed; 
Whereas it is estimated that, each year, 
between 6,000,000 and 7,500,000 individuals in 
the United States report that they have been 
victims of stalking; 
Whereas more than 85 percent of victims of 
stalking report that they have been stalked 
by someone they know; 
Whereas nearly 70 percent of intimate 
partner stalking victims are threatened with 
physical harm by stalkers; 
Whereas stalking is a risk factor for inti-
mate partner homicide; 
Whereas 3 in 4 female victims of intimate 
partner homicides were stalked during the 
year preceding the homicide by their killers; 
Whereas 11 percent of victims of stalking 
report having been stalked for more than 5 
years; 
Whereas two-thirds of stalkers pursue 
their victims at least once a week; 
Whereas many victims of stalking are 
forced to take drastic measures to protect 
themselves, including relocating, changing 
jobs, or obtaining protection orders; 
Whereas the prevalence of anxiety, insom-
nia, social dysfunction, and severe depres-
sion is much higher among victims of stalk-
ing than the general population; 
Whereas many victims of stalking do not 
report stalking to the police or contact a 
victim service provider, shelter, or hotline; 
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal 
law, the laws of all 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, and the territories of the United 
States, and the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice; 
Whereas stalking affects victims of every 
race, age, culture, gender, sexual orienta-
tion, physical and mental ability, and eco-
nomic status; 
Whereas national organizations, local vic-
tim service organizations, campuses, pros-
ecutor’s offices, and police departments 
stand ready to assist victims of stalking and 
are working diligently to develop effective 
and innovative responses to stalking, includ-
ing online stalking; 
Whereas there is a need to improve the re-
sponse of the criminal justice system to 
stalking through more aggressive investiga-
tion and prosecution; 
Whereas there is a need for an increase in 
the availability of victim services across the 
United States, and those services must in-
clude programs tailored to meet the needs of 
victims of stalking; 
Whereas individuals between 18 and 24 
years old experience the highest rates of 
stalking victimization, and a majority of 
stalking victims report their victimization 
first occurred before the age of 25; 
Whereas up to 75 percent of women in col-
lege who experience behavior relating to 
stalking also experience other forms of vic-
timization, including sexual or physical vic-
timization; 
Whereas college students with disabilities 
are twice as likely as college students with-
out disabilities to experience stalking; 
Whereas there is a need for an effective re-
sponse to stalking on each campus; 
Whereas more than twice as many victims 
of stalking are stalked using technology, 
such as phone calls, text messages, social 
media platforms, internet posts, emails, 
electronic tracking, as victims of stalking 
who are stalked without the use of tech-
nology; 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
heightened the risk of online stalking and 
harassment, particularly among school-aged 
individuals; 
Whereas victim service organizations and 
law enforcement entities have swiftly adapt-
ed to the COVID–19 pandemic in order to 
continue to serve victims of stalking; 
Whereas victim service providers report an 
increase in online stalking and harassment, 
particularly among school-aged individuals; 
and 
Whereas the Senate finds that ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’ provides an op-
portunity to educate the people of the 
United States about stalking: Now, there-
fore, be it

RESOLU-

AS 
A 
FUNDAMENTAL 
HUMAN 
RIGHT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO A 
FREE SOCIETY AND PROTECTED 
FOR 
ALL 
PEOPLE 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
UNDER

CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES, AND RECOGNIZING THE 
236TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EN-
ACTMENT 
OF 
THE 
VIRGINIA 
STATUTE FOR RELIGIOUS FREE-
DOM 
Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. BLUNT, 
Mr. TILLIS, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. 
THUNE, Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. RISCH, 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. 
HOEVEN, Mr. WICKER, Mr. LANKFORD, 
and Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina) sub-
mitted the following concurrent resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 27 
Whereas the democracy of the United 
States is rooted in the fundamental truth 
that all people are created equal, endowed by 
the Creator with certain inalienable rights, 
including life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness; 
Whereas the freedom of conscience was 
highly valued by— 
(1) individuals seeking religious freedom 
who settled in the colonies in the United 
States; 
(2) the founders of the United States; and 
(3) Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in a letter 
to the Society of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church at New London, Connecticut, dated 
February 4, 1809, that ‘‘[n]o provision in our 
Constitution ought to be dearer to man than 
that which protects the rights of conscience 
against the enterprizes of the civil author-
ity’’; 
Whereas the Virginia Statute for Religious 
Freedom was— 
(1) drafted by Thomas Jefferson, who con-
sidered the Virginia Statute for Religious 
Freedom to be one of his greatest achieve-
ments; 
(2) enacted on January 16, 1786; and 
(3) the forerunner to the Free Exercise 
Clause of the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States; 
Whereas section 2(a) of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 
6401(a)) states that— 
(1) ‘‘[t]he right to freedom of religion 
undergirds the very origin and existence of 
the United States’’; and 
(2) religious freedom was established by 
the founders of the United States ‘‘in law, as 
a fundamental right and as a pillar of our 
Nation’’; 
Whereas the role of religion in society and 
public life in the United States has a long 
and robust tradition; 
Whereas individuals who have studied the 
democracy of the United States from an 
international perspective, such as Alexis de 
Tocqueville, have noted that religion plays a 
central role in preserving the Government of 
the United States because religion provides 
the moral base required for democracy to 
succeed; 
Whereas, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, 
134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014), the Supreme Court of 
the United States affirmed that ‘‘people of 
many faiths may be united in a community 
of tolerance and devotion’’; 
Whereas the principle of religious freedom 
‘‘has guided our Nation forward’’, as ex-
pressed by the 44th President of the United 
States in a Presidential proclamation on Re-
ligious Freedom Day in 2011, and freedom of 
religion ‘‘is a universal human right to be 
protected here at home and across the 
globe’’, as expressed by that President of the 
United States on Religious Freedom Day in 
2013; 
Whereas ‘‘[f]reedom of religion is a funda-
mental human right that must be upheld by 
every nation and guaranteed by every gov-
ernment’’, as expressed by the 42nd President 
of the United States in a Presidential procla-
mation on Religious Freedom Day in 1999; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States protects— 
(1) the right of individuals to freely express 
and act on the religious beliefs of those indi-
viduals; and 
(2) individuals from coercion to profess or 
act on a religious belief to which those indi-
viduals do not adhere; 
Whereas ‘‘our laws and institutions should 
not impede or hinder but rather should pro-
tect and preserve fundamental religious lib-
erties’’, as expressed by the 42nd President of 
the United States in remarks accompanying 
the signing of the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.); 
Whereas, for countless people of the United 
States, faith is an integral part of every as-
pect of daily life and is not limited to the 
homes, houses of worship, or doctrinal creeds 
of those individuals; 
Whereas ‘‘religious faith has inspired many 
of our fellow citizens to help build a better 
Nation’’ in which ‘‘people of faith continue 
to wage a determined campaign to meet 
needs and fight suffering’’, as expressed by 
the 43rd President of the United States in a 
Presidential proclamation on Religious Free-
dom Day in 2003; 
Whereas, ‘‘[f]rom its birth to this day, the 
United States has prized this legacy of reli-
gious freedom and honored this heritage by 
standing for religious freedom and offering 
refuge to those suffering religious persecu-
tion’’, as noted in section 2(a) of the Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 6401(a)); 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote— 
(1) in 1798 that each right encompassed in 
the First Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States is dependent on the other 
rights described in that Amendment, ‘‘there-
by guarding in the same sentence, and under 
the same words, the freedom of religion, of 
speech, and of the press: insomuch, that 
whatever violated either, throws down the 
sanctuary which covers the others’’; and 
(2) in 1822 that the constitutional freedom 
of religion is ‘‘the most inalienable and sa-
cred of all human rights’’; 
Whereas religious freedom ‘‘has been inte-
gral to the preservation and development of 
the United States’’, and ‘‘the free exercise of 
religion goes hand in hand with the preserva-
tion of our other rights’’, as expressed by the 
41st President of the United States in a Pres-
idential proclamation on Religious Freedom 
Day in 1993; and 
Whereas we ‘‘continue to proclaim the fun-
damental right of all peoples to believe and 
worship according to their own conscience, 
to affirm their beliefs openly and freely, and 
to practice their faith without fear or in-
timidation’’, as expressed by the 42nd Presi-
dent of the United States in a Presidential 
proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 
1998: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) on Religious Freedom Day on January 
16, 2022, honors the 236th anniversary of the 
enactment of the Virginia Statute for Reli-
gious Freedom; and 
(2) affirms that— 
(A) for individuals of any faith and individ-
uals of no faith, religious freedom includes 
the right of an individual to live, work, asso-
ciate, and worship in accordance with the be-
liefs of the individual; 
(B) all people of the United States can be 
unified in supporting religious freedom, re-
gardless of differing individual beliefs, be-
cause religious freedom is a fundamental 
human right; and 
(C) ‘‘the American people will remain for-
ever unshackled in matters of faith’’, as ex-
pressed by the 44th President of the United 
States in a Presidential proclamation on Re-
ligious Freedom Day in 2012.

RECOGNIZING MELISSA CONNOLLY 
AND 
HER 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Melissa Connolly for over eight years 
of service to the constituents of New York’s 
10th Congressional District. 
Melissa’s career in the House began in 
2009 as a Legislative Assistant to former Rep-
resentative Jerry Costello following her grad-
uation from Duke University’s School of Public 
Policy and the University of Pennsylvania. 
After working with former Representative Shel-
ley Berkley, Melissa joined my office in 2013, 
rising from Legislative Assistant to become my 
Legislative Director. 
As Legislative Director, Melissa has been a 
trusted and valued advisor who helped set 
and manage my policy agenda. She also 
played a significant leadership role in my 
Washington DC office, serving as a mentor 
and a resource for junior staff, and I appre-
ciate and have relied on her skill and experi-
ence in managing our team. Melissa also 
helped staff me in my role as Dean of the 
New York Delegation, which included coordi-
nating meetings with the New York Delegation 
and other elected officials from the City and 
State. 
Throughout her tenure in my office, Melissa 
established herself as an expert on issues re-
lating to women and families and as a critical 
resource for other staff on Capitol Hill working 
on those issues. She worked tirelessly with 
the Education and Labor Committee, women’s 
and labor rights organizations, and businesses 
to help pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act on the House floor with a strong bipartisan 
vote. Her countless hours of work building 
support for this legislation should pave the 
way for it to become law soon and to improve 
the lives of millions of Americans. 
Melissa also worked closely with my Judici-
ary Committee staff on several important initia-
tives, including legislation extending the dead-
line to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, 
which passed the House twice. She also 
helped lead the Judiciary Committee’s work to 
protect women’s fundamental right to abortion, 
springing into action after Texas enacted its 
abortion ban to help plan a hearing to spotlight 
the devastating impact of the law. She ap-
proaches the topic of reproductive freedom 
and health with the knowledge, passion, and 
energy that makes her an extremely effective 
policymaker. 
In addition to these issues, Melissa has 
managed a broad portfolio over the course of 
her 13 years on the Hill. She worked to help 
pass and ensure effective implementation of 
the Affordable Care Act and helped fend off 
numerous Republican attacks designed to re-
peal it. She has worked diligently with stake-
holders to build support for the Living Donor 
Protection Act, which would protect living 
organ donors from high insurance premiums 
and remove barriers to organ donation. She 
has also long led my office’s effort to increase 
funding for both Section 8 housing and Hous-
ing Opportunities for People with AIDS in the 
annual appropriations bills. Her efforts to build 
support for these programs has translated into 
millions of dollars of additional funding for peo-
ple in dire need of support. They may never 
know her name, but she has, nevertheless, 
improved countless lives through her efforts. 
Twenty years later, my office continues to 
work on issues stemming from the terrorist at-
tacks of September 11, 2001. Melissa was es-
sential to our efforts to extend and expand the 
9/11 health and victim compensation programs 
that have distributed more than $9 billion to 
the families of first responders and survivors 
of these attacks. The health care program has 
helped care for tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans with 9/11 related health conditions and 
Melissa helped organize the most recent Judi-
ciary Committee hearings on the programs 
that led to their long-term extension. 
In response to the COVID–19 outbreak, Me-
lissa not only smoothly managed her legisla-
tive team’s transition to a remote work envi-
ronment, but she also worked tirelessly to ad-
vocate for the needs of New Yorkers and keep 
my constituents informed of our efforts. She 
effectively advocated for specific legislative 
provisions to assist New York’s hospitals, 
mass transit, small businesses, arts institu-
tions and museums, and tenants, and she 
worked doggedly to see that these provisions 
were included in the comprehensive bills that 
were passed to address the pandemic and 
economic collapse that followed. She also 
planned and implemented our COVID–19 
communication strategy with our communica-
tions and community liaison staff, including 
drafting issue-specific, weekly e-newsletters, 
setting up web pages explaining the CARES 
Act and Heroes Act benefits, and creating 
toolkits for constituents seeking assistance. 
I would be remiss if I did not mention 
Melissa’s husband, Mike Connolly, and her 
children, Maisie and Robert. Both of her chil-
dren were born during her tenure in the office, 
and for me and the rest of our team it has 
been a pleasure watching them grow up, hear-
ing their stories, and occasionally receiving 
their artwork, many of which are displayed 
throughout the D.C. office. 
Finally, Melissa has a great attitude, a good 
sense of humor, and is a joy to work with. She 
has sound judgment, excellent people skills, 
and a deep understanding of how Congress 
works. My staff and I are lucky to have worked 
with her for all these years, and we will surely 
miss her as she moves on to new endeavors 
in the private sector.

HONORING 
CABARRUS 
COUNTY 
LIBERTY BELL AWARD RECIPI-
ENT TOM GRADY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Tom Grady on receiving the 
Cabarrus County Bar Association Liberty Bell 
Award. 
A native of Cabarrus County, Mr. Grady 
graduated from Wake Forest University School 
of Law before returning home to begin prac-
ticing law with Williams, Willeford, and Boger 
in 1966. He continued work for this firm and 
its successors for fifty-five years before retiring 
in 2020. 
Mr. Grady quickly became well-known for 
his skill and success as a motorsports attor-
ney. He provided exceptional legal services to 
many associated with NASCAR, and his lead-
ership proved paramount in the 1990s and 
early 2000s when the motorsports industry un-
derwent a significant period of advancement 
and growth. On account of his excellence as 
a legal professional and mentor, Mr. Grady 
had the honor of serving as the President of 
the Cabarrus County Bar Association and was 
inducted into the North Carolina Bar Associa-
tion Hall of Fame. 
The Liberty Bell Award is presented by the 
local bar to an individual who exhibits exem-
plary or distinguished accomplishments and 
contributions to the legal profession. Over the 
course of his career and service to Cabarrus 
County, Mr. Grady provided a strong and con-
sistent source of legal knowledge to support 
and assist his clients and community. I know 
I speak for our entire community in wishing 
him and his family continued success and 
happiness going forward. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Mr. Tom Grady as the Cabarrus 
County Bar Association Liberty Bell Award re-
cipient and wish him well as he continues to 
enjoy retirement.

dedication to the City of Peoria. Ardis retired 
in 2021 as the longest serving Mayor in the 
history of the City, serving for 16 years. Prior 
to his 4 terms as Mayor, he also served on 
the City Council for 6 years. We thank Mayor 
Ardis for his tireless advocacy and dedication 
to move the City forward through times of 
prosperity and adversity. His unwavering com-
mitment to the community is a testament to 
his perseverance and love for Peoria. 
During his tenure, Peoria earned the unique 
distinction of being named an All-America City. 
Mayor Ardis led the effort to create a one-of- 
a-kind program called Peoria Promise, which 
gives all students in the City the opportunity to 
attend community college with tuition reim-
bursement. Mayor Ardis’s leadership also 
helped to develop Peoria’s warehouse district 
which has brought economic development to 
the area and transformed downtown. That ef-
fort has continued recently with OSF Health 
Care’s new headquarters also coming to 
Downtown Peoria. His influence on the City of 
Peoria over the years is endless. 
In addition, Jim is a caring person that has 
always generously given his time and re-
sources to many charities and philanthropic ef-
forts that help people. One shining example is 
his dedication to the St. Jude Memphis to Pe-
oria Run that raises money for children with 
cancer. Jim has dedicated his professional 
and personal life to the Peoria community and 
continues to do so now after his time as 
Mayor with his role at the OSF Foundation. I 
appreciate our friendship and his commitment 
to public service. I wish Jim great success in 
all his future endeavors.

HONORING JOSE ALVARADO AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
Jose Alvarado as Iowan of the Week. Jose 
has lived in Iowa for over two decades and 
over this time he has shown a clear commit-
ment to improving the Latino community and 
Iowa as a whole. With a clear understanding 
of the issues facing the Latino community in 
Iowa, Jose has successfully implemented 
community-oriented solutions. 
Jose founded the LatinX Immigrants of Iowa 
organization in 2016 to help people. With the 
Latino population of Iowa continuing to grow, 
organizations such as Jose’s have taken on 
increased importance. LatinX Immigrants of 
Iowa has been able to provide legal, financial, 
and civic programs. Lawsuits and mortgages/ 
leases can be quite technical ordeals, and any 
language barrier only makes for a more com-
plicated situation. Jose recognized this issue, 
and the organization he founded ensures that 
no Latino individual is left behind. 
Over the past 2 years, the organization has 
been on the front lines in COVID–19 re-
sponse. Jose and his organization recognized 
the need for more Spanish-specific COVID–19 
information and community vaccination clinics. 
Leveraging the organization’s resources and 
connections, LatinX Immigrants of Iowa was 
able to vaccinate approximately 1,600 individ-
uals in the Des Moines area from COVID–19 
in a comfortable and familiar setting. While 
this is already an impressive accomplishment, 
Jose plans to put on another vaccine clinic 
event in January as well. Ensuring that 
COVID–19 information is shared with all peo-
ple is a crucial part of how we can effectively 
curtail COVID–19 transmission, and I’m thank-
ful for Jose and LatinX Immigrants of Iowa’s 
efforts to cover the Latino community in this 
critical time. 
Jose and LatinX Immigrants of Iowa also or-
ganize large community gathering events. 
These events promote Latino heritage and 
community-building in Central Iowa. This year, 
the organization put on a successful Dia´ de 
los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebration in 
Des Moines with the goal to make it as au-
thentic as possible. As Jose turns towards 
2022, they will kick off the new year with a Dia´ 
de los Reyes Magos (3 King’s Day) celebra-
tion, which is a popular holiday for the Latino 
community. These events, in addition to regu-
larly scheduled education classes, help ensure 
that Latinos know that there is a place for 
them in Iowa. 
Jose strengthens Iowa’s community through 
his dedicated public service. I look forward to 
following him and his organization as they 
continue to move forward serving the commu-
nity, and I am proud to name Jose Alvarado 
as Iowan of the Week.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PASSING OF VICE 
ADMIRAL PAUL FREDERICK FOS-
TER, USN 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the 50th anniversary of the passing of 
Vice Admiral Paul Frederick Foster, USN. 
Over his distinguished 23-year career in the 
United States Navy, Vice Admiral Foster be-
came the first naval officer to be awarded the 
Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, 
and our Nation’s highest military distinction, 
the Medal of Honor. 
Born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of a Con-
gregationalist minister, he spent his early 
years traveling the west with his father, living 
in Kansas, Utah, Oklahoma, and Idaho before 
his appointment to the United States Naval 
Academy. At the academy, he reached the 
rank of cadet commander and served as com-
mander of the Midshipmen Battalion. Upon 
graduation in 1911, he was assigned to var-
ious postings in the Caribbean Sea. In 1914, 
then-Ensign Foster took part in the Battle of 
Veracruz during the United States’ intervention 
against Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. At 
the head of his company, he led his sailors 
ashore during the fighting on April 21 and 22, 
1914. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for 
his leadership, heroism, and courage under 
enemy fire. His commendation cites that ‘‘Ens. 
Foster was eminent and conspicuous in his 
conduct, leading his men with skill and cour-
age’’. 
Upon his return to the United States in 
1915, Vice Admiral Foster became one of the 
first American naval officers to undergo sub-
marine instruction. He served as executive of-
ficer on the experimental submarine G–4 and 
participated in maneuvers along the Eastern 
Seaboard. When the United States joined the 
Allies in World War I, Vice Admiral Foster was 
sent to England and served on U.S. Sub-
marine L–2. In 1918, he was awarded the 
Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his part 
in sinking one of the three enemy submarines 
sunk during the war. 
After World War I, he returned to peacetime 
duty back in the United States. In 1924, during 
a training accident on the USS Trenton, with 
total disregard for his safety, Vice Admiral 
Foster entered a burning gun turret and extin-
guished the fire both inside the turret and on 
the clothing of the crew members, saving their 
lives. For this act of valor, he was decorated 
with the Navy Cross. He retired from active 
duty in 1929 but remained a member of the 
Navy Reserve. 
Vice Admiral Foster was recalled to active 
duty in 1941 following the attack on Pearl Har-
bor. President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly 
tasked him to conduct special naval inspec-
tions worldwide during the Second World War. 
As Assistant Inspector General of the Navy, 
Vice Admiral Foster examined bases across 
the globe, overseeing operations and ensuring 
the security, effectiveness, and safety of U.S. 
naval operations in North America, Europe, 
and the Pacific. He received the Legion of 
Merit and Navy Commendation Medal for his 
essential service. He retired from the Navy 
fully in October 1946 with the rank of vice ad-
miral. 
The end of his military service did not mark 
the end of his career in public service. In 
1954, Vice Admiral Foster was appointed by 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be the as-
sistant general manager for international ac-
tivities at the Atomic Energy Commission 
(AEC) and later general manager of the com-
mission, advancing the United States’ peaceful 
pursuit of atomic power. Finally, in 1959, 
President Eisenhower appointed him perma-
nent U.S. representative to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, furthering 
U.S. leadership in managing the peacetime 
development of atomic science and tech-
nology through the ‘‘Atoms for Peace’’ initia-
tive. During his service in Vienna, he had the 
opportunity to meet with several world leaders, 
including Pope John XXIII. After retiring in 
1961, Vice Admiral Foster settled in Virginia 
Beach. He passed away on Jan. 30, 1972, at 
the age of 82. In a tribute to his years of serv-
ice, the Spruance-class destroyer USS Paul F. 
Foster was named in his honor in 1976. A true 
American hero, Vice Admiral Foster’s legacy 
lives on through his family, friends, and com-
mitment to service to his country. I hope the 
rest of my colleagues will join me in honoring 
his memory on the 50th anniversary of his 
passing on Jan. 30, 2022.

West Chambers County, Texas. After serving 
as the Executive Director of the Baytown-West 
Chambers County Economic Development 
Foundation for the last 36 years, Mike will be 
retiring this month. 
For nearly four decades, Mike has been a 
driving force for regional economic growth. 
Without a doubt, his work has improved the 
quality of life for all living in the City of Bay-
town and the surrounding community. 
Over the years, Mike played a major role in 
landing many significant developments and 
project expansions, including the establish-
ment of a regional logistics hub, a distribution 
center for a multinational retail corporation, a 
multinational steel-making company, and the 
largest master-planned, rail-and-barge-served 
industrial park in the U.S. He was also instru-
mental in creating the Cedar Bayou Navigation 
District as well as the various improvement 
districts in Chambers County. These projects 
yielded numerous high-paying jobs for Bay-
town and generated a multitude of support 
from countless businesses in the Greater 
Houston area, including critical industries 
along the Houston Ship Channel. 
During his tenure, Mike collaborated with 
key stakeholders, such as the City of Bay-
town, Chambers County, Harris County, the 
Port of Houston, the Greater Houston Partner-
ship, the State of Texas, the Houston-Gal-
veston Area Council, and the Baytown Cham-
ber of Commerce to diversify the economy 
and enhance growth and prosperity within the 
region. In addition, he actively contributed to 
the industrial development of the Greater 
Houston area through his memberships in the 
Texas Economic Development Council and 
the 
International 
Economic 
Development 
Council. 
As if these significant accomplishments 
were not enough, Mike also served his nation 
honorably as an infantryman in the U.S. Army 
during the Vietnam War. During the war, his 
unit ran Reconnaissance-in-Force (RIF) mis-
sions to determine the location of enemy com-
batants for artillery strikes. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mike Shields for 
his momentous contributions to the economic 
development of the City of Baytown, West 
Chambers County, and the surrounding com-
munities over the last 36 years. Our region 
has a flourishing economy, in large part to 
Mike’s efforts, and I wish him and his family all 
the best in retirement.

CVNL through significant growth, encouraging

IN RECOGNITION OF HOLLY JAREK 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to honor Holly Jarek, a 
leader in the field of providing compassionate 
care to children and young adults who are se-
verely developmentally delayed and with com-
plex medical needs. Holly recently retired, and 
I would like to take a moment to highlight just 
a few of her accomplishments. 
After graduating from Cathedral High School 
in Springfield, Massachusetts, Holly went on to 
attend Boston University’s School of Nursing, 
where she received a B.S. and M.S. in Child 
Health Nursing. From there, she received her 
Doctorate from the University of Alabama in 
Health Services Administration. Her doctoral 
work explored the administrative challenges 
facing pediatric long-term care administrators. 
Holly’s experience includes a decade work-
ing with the University of Massachusetts Med-
ical Center in a variety of leadership and edu-
cational roles. She was also a full-time faculty 
member at the University of Massachusetts 
Nursing School during this time, specializing in 
pediatrics and technology-based care. After 
leaving UMass Medical, she spent ten years in 
the private sector, where she established 
home care programs for medically fragile chil-
dren throughout the United States and Can-
ada in her capacity as a National Program 
Manager with Olsten Health Services. From 
there, she returned to the non-profit sector 
with the Franciscan Children’s Hospital. She 
served as Vice President of Seven Hills Foun-
dation and Administrator at Seven Hills Pedi-
atric Centers in Groton and Hopedale, Massa-
chusetts. 
I had the pleasure of meeting Holly on sev-
eral occasions in Washington during her time 
as Chair of the Intellectual and Developmental 
Disabilities Committee of the American Health 
Care Association. She was a strong advocate 
on behalf of the most vulnerable in our soci-
ety, and her leadership will be truly missed. 
Madam Speaker, in light of Holly’s many ac-
complishments in her field, I would like to 
thank her for her steadfast service, and offer 
my personal best wishes for a long, happy, 
and healthy retirement.

HONORING APACHE JUNCTION 
POLICE CHIEF THOMAS E. KELLY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career of Apache Junction Police 
Chief Thomas E. Kelly who is set to retire this 
January after nearly 50 years of service in law 
enforcement. Chief Kelly has been a steadfast 
defender of our community. 
In Apache Junction, Chief Kelly worked his 
way up through the department, serving first 
as captain of the criminal investigations divi-
sion before serving as Deputy Chief and then 
Chief. This impressive period of service made 
Apache Junction safer under his watch, how-
ever we are only a portion of the country 
which has benefitted from his service. 
Prior to his arrival in Apache Junction, Chief 
Kelly worked in the Chicago Police Depart-
ment. From there he accepted a position with 
the U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforce-
ment Administration (DEA), working in various 
capacities in the U.S. and around the world. 
He finished his time with the DEA as Special 
Agent in Charge in the Chicago Field Division. 
Chief Kelly is a model law enforcement offi-
cer, which is why he has also worked with the 
Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training 
Board, leadership of the Arizona Association 
of Chiefs of Police, and trained law enforce-
ment partners on a global scale. 
Chief Kelly will be greatly missed. While we 
claim his service in Apache Junction, Chief 
Kelly’s retirement marks the end of extended 
service to the entire country. His commitment 
to protecting his community and setting high 
standards for law enforcement excellence will 
be greatly missed. We wish Chief Kelly a 
great retirement and thank him for giving his 
life to the protection of our community.

HONORING SAJ’S CENTENNIAL 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 13, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the one hundredth anniversary of 
SAJ: Judaism that Stands for All. Originally 
named the Society for the Advancement of Ju-
daism, the synagogue’s founding in 1922 was 
a historic moment in the growth of Judaism in 
America. One hundred years later it remains a 
cornerstone of Jewish life in New York City. 
SAJ was founded by Rabbi Mordecai M. 
Kaplan, one of the most influential Jewish 
thinkers of the 20th Century. Rabbi Kaplan de-
veloped an understanding of Judaism as an 
evolving civilization, later becoming known as 
Reconstructionist Judaism. For decades, SAJ 
served as Kaplan’s experimentation field. 
There, Americans Jews could take pride in 
drawing from their Jewishness to support their 
Americanness, and their Americanness to sup-
port their Jewishness. 
SAJ joined the rapidly growing synagogue 
community on New York’s Upper West Side, a 
neighborhood rich with Jewish life. 
SAJ has long stood for social justice, equal-
ity, and progress. It is a place where all are 
welcome, including LGBTQ+ and interfaith 
families. In 1922, it hosted the first bat mitzvah 
in the United States. Today, it is led by all-fe-
male clergy and staff. Rabbi Alan Miller, who 
served as rabbi of SAJ from 1961 to 1992, in-
troduced to the sermon the idea of ‘‘the open 
microphone,’’ where congregants can share 
their reactions as part of a dialogue. Origi-
nated at SAJ, the open microphone is now uti-
lized by rabbis across Jewish denominations. 
Today, we celebrate SAJ’s commitment to 
advancing justice in the Upper West Side, in 
New York City, and in the world beyond. We 
celebrate its one hundred years of bold, intel-
lectual curiosity and one hundred years of en-
riching Jewish life.
