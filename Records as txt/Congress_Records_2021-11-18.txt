DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Your word is a lamp to our feet and 
a light to our path, alive and active, 
judging the thoughts and attitudes of 
our hearts. Yours is a word which calls 
us to hear and obey, to live according 
to the truth and love You lay before us. 
Holy God, speak Your word to us 
today that it would pierce our hearts 
and judge our thoughts and intentions. 
Share the insight of Your word with us 
that it would shed light on our way-
ward paths, that we would return to 
the way You would have us live. 
Reveal the meaning of Your word 
when our own perception falls short, 
that we would understand what You 
call us to do and who You call us to be. 
Time and again, our words have prov-
en inadequate, hurtful, and unwise. We 
pray Your redemption, O God. Let our 
speech always be gracious, seasoned 
with kindness, so that it would serve to 
build one another up and not tear each 
other down. 
Today and every day, call us back to 
the words You have provided in scrip-
ture, that You would teach us, rebuke 
us, correct us, and train us in the way 
of righteousness. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING ANGIE HENDERSHOT 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to recognize an incredible leader 
in mid-Michigan, Angie Hendershot. 
For the past 25 years, my constitu-
ents in Flint, Saginaw, and Bay City 
have welcomed Angie Hendershot into 
their homes as a reporter and anchor 
with ABC TV–12. She is a trusted voice 
in our community. Local reporters like 
Angie play a vital role in democracy. 
For the past 25 years, she has kept 
mid-Michigan informed and connected 
through her on-the-ground reporting 
and investigative journalism. Through-
out her course of work, Angie has won 
many awards, including 10 Emmys and 
numerous awards from the Associated 
Press and Michigan Association of 
Broadcasters. 
But for Angie, working at ABC 12 
isn’t just a job; it is a way to give back 
to the community she loves. She has 
demonstrated time and time again her 
commitment to mid-Michigan through-
out her career with volunteerism and 
charity work. One of those initiatives 
is the annual diaper drive, where Angie 
helps to collect donations of diapers, 
wipes, and cash to help the Flint Dia-
per Bank supply more than a million 
diapers to local, needy babies every 
year. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Angie on her achievements and this 
important milestone. I speak for our 
entire community when I say we look 
forward to welcoming her into our liv-
ing rooms for many, many years to 
come. 
Great work, Angie. 
f 
PENN STATE’S SEATS FOR 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, as 
Americans, we should always honor 
and support our veterans and Active 
Duty military personnel. This week, 
Penn State University kicked off its 
10th 
annual 
Military 
Appreciation 
Week, holding a series of events and 
ceremonies on behalf of the brave men 
and women who have served and fought 
for and continue to fight for our coun-
try. 
Military Appreciation Week at Penn 
State culminates this Saturday with 
the annual military appreciation tail-
gate and football game at Beaver Sta-
dium. Penn State’s Seats for Service-
members program will give 7,000 com-
plimentary tickets to veterans and 
servicemembers to enjoy the game.

November 18, 2021 
Moreover, Penn State is now home to 
the largest stadium in the United 
States, honoring POW/MIA service-
members with a chair of honor that 
will forever remain empty honoring 
those brave Americans who never re-
turned home. 
To Penn State University and the 
community members who have made 
this week possible, thank you for your 
work. We are Penn State.

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS 
FOR TEXAS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the billions 
of dollars coming to Texas to provide 
clean water and to weatherize our 
power grid. 
In just the past year and a half, my 
district has faced a devastating winter 
storm and a massive pipe burst that 
put lives at risk. These two events, pic-
tured beside me, demonstrate a simple 
truth. We are long past due for invest-
ments that modernize our electric grid 
and restore our aging water systems. 
That is why I am proud that the in-
frastructure bill will invest $3.5 billion 
to prepare power grids for weather 
emergencies and bring $2.9 billion di-
rectly to Texas for clean water. Thanks 
to this funding, communities like mine 
will benefit from clean water, reliable 
power, and peace of mind. 
f 
NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH DAY 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on Thursday, November 18, in 
honor of National Rural Health Day. 
My home State of Mississippi is lead-
ing the way in rural healthcare innova-
tion, which is important because 54 
percent of our State’s population lives 
in rural areas. Thanks to a strong net-
work of hospitals served by dedicated 
healthcare providers, as well as a 
world-class telehealth system anchored 
by the University of Mississippi Med-
ical Center, patients in Mississippi can 
receive the care they need in their 
communities. 
I am proud of the partnership be-
tween two universities in my district 
to improve health outcomes in rural 
communities across our State. The 
University of Mississippi Medical Cen-
ter, our State’s only academic medical 
center, and Mississippi State Univer-
sity, with its land grant mission and 
extension expertise, are partnering on 
critical healthcare and public health 
challenges and are working together to 
meet the healthcare needs of their fel-
low Mississippians. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
Mississippi’s role in advancing rural 
healthcare and the selfless service of 
our healthcare providers. 
BUILDING BACK GREEN 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commend my colleagues 
for acting to tackle the climate crisis. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, we 
are celebrating America’s efforts to 
combat our world’s largest existential 
threat: global warming. 
Last week, Speaker PELOSI led a di-
verse group of House Democrats to 
Glasgow, Scotland. I was part of that 
group, the COP 26 conference, and our 
message was clear. The U.S. is proud to 
be back in the Paris Agreement and 
will continue to demonstrate our com-
mitment to reach net-zero emissions. 
Our commitment was met by action, 
not only with the agreements that 
were struck during the conference, but 
also the sound policies included in the 
Build Back Better Act. The frame-
work’s $555 billion investment rep-
resents the largest single investment 
in our clean energy economy in his-
tory. This includes buildings, transpor-
tation, 
industry, 
electricity, 
agri-
culture, and climate-smart practices 
across lands and waters. 
As an environmental justice policy, 
the Justice40 acknowledges decades of 
environmental 
burdens 
on 
Black, 
Brown, and indigenous communities. 
Upholding this policy is vital to guar-
antee that communities that have 
weathered the costs of climate change 
finally receive commonsense human 
rights. 
Let’s build back better. Let’s build 
back green. 
f 
ECONOMIC CRISIS 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to discuss the rising costs that are 
crushing hardworking families. 
Last week, it was reported that infla-
tion hit a 30-year high. This is a hidden 
tax on every American that is making 
your paycheck worth less. Americans 
are paying more for everything, from 
groceries, to utilities, to filling up the 
gas tank. 
The cost of a gallon of gas is up 61 
percent; utilities up 28 percent; and ev-
eryday grocery items, like eggs, milk, 
and chicken, are all significantly high-
er. 
These 
numbers 
have 
real 
con-
sequences for not only Orange County 
families I represent, but nationwide. 
We need to get our spending under con-
trol or these problems will only con-
tinue to get worse. 
Madam Speaker, I will continue to 
fight against these policies that are 
making life for Americans more expen-
sive. 
OVERDOSE DEATHS REACH 
RECORD HIGH 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we got horrible news yesterday; for the 
first time in the United States, over 
100,000 people died from illegal drugs. 
When I got here 6 years ago, that num-
ber was 47,000. By comparison, in 12 
years, only 58,000 died in the Vietnam 
War. Almost twice as many people die 
in this country every year from illegal 
drug overdose than died in the entire 
12-year period of the Vietnam War. 
Today, we look at a major bill, the 
Build Back Better Act, and we look at 
what is the effect of the Build Back 
Better Act on 100,000 deaths. In this 
bill, we are encouraging more illegal 
immigration; we are taking more Bor-
der Patrol agents off the border and 
processing young people. And finally, 
in this bill we are encouraging more 
people to come here, which inevitably 
means more fentanyl, more deaths. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the majority 
party to please step back, change the 
bill to add a few more Border Patrol 
agents, and change the bill to get out 
the carrots that are going to encourage 
more fentanyl and more deaths. 
f 
VACCINE MANDATE CONCERNS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
come to the House floor to speak on be-
half of business owners and employees 
and healthcare providers, including 
employees at Cookeville Regional Med-
ical Center who are concerned about 
President 
Biden’s 
unconstitutional 
vaccine mandate. 
If the Biden administration mandate 
is allowed to take effect, there is a 
strong possibility that Cookeville Re-
gional Medical Center, the hospital in 
my hometown where I was born and 
where my two sons were born, will not 
have the staff necessary to carry on 
normal operations. 
The Biden administration’s plan to 
mandate vaccines will devastate med-
ical facilities throughout the country. 
Let me be clear. President Biden’s 
mandates on medical facilities will 
dramatically exacerbate the current 
medical worker shortage in my State 
and in my district. 
While I encourage everyone to con-
sult with their doctors and consider 
joining me in being vaccinated, it is 
not the Federal Government’s place, 
under the current circumstances, to 
mandate a vaccine. That is why I am 
calling on President Biden to end his 
indiscriminate vaccine mandate.

INVESTING IN OUR NATION’S 
FUTURE 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, we 
are at critical crossroads as we work to 
recover after the health and economic 
crises caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic here at home and around the 
world. 
As we look to our future, we are 
going to build back better to create an 
economy that works for every Amer-
ican and all families that leaves no one 
behind. This is a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to transform the lives of 
millions of Americans by reducing 
costs for everything from prescription 
drugs to childcare; creating good-pay-
ing union jobs by addressing the ur-
gency of the climate crisis; cutting 
taxes for working families; and making 
sure that none of these investments 
add to the deficit by making the 
wealthiest individuals and largest cor-
porations pay their fair share in taxes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this investment in 
our Nation’s future. 
f 
FREEDOM TO VOTE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
over the last couple of months, hun-
dreds of individuals have come to 
Washington from all over the country 
to protest the lack of the passage of 
the Voting Rights Act, the John Rob-
ert Lewis Voting Rights Act, and, as 
well, the Freedom to Vote Act. 
Freedom to Vote and John Robert 
Lewis 
voting 
laws 
are 
the 
underpinnings of this great Nation. It 
exemplifies the beginning of the Con-
stitution, that we were created to cre-
ate a more perfect Union. It underlies 
the elimination of slavery, the right to 
vote for all people, and due process. 
We must move these important, cru-
cial legislative initiatives that are 
more than laws; they are the very 
heart of this Nation. 
The Senate must move. It must move 
now. 
More people are coming. They will be 
arrested, and they are insisting that we 
move. 
I am ready—I know we are, this 
House under Democratic leadership—to 
pass both bills. We seek this legislation 
now. We cannot wait. 
People want to vote, and they want 
to vote safely, and they want to end 
the big lie. Let’s vote.

(A) PAYMENT RATES AND COST ESTIMATION.— 
(i) PAYMENT RATES.—The State plan shall cer-
tify that payment rates for the provision of di-
rect child care services for which assistance is 
provided in accordance with this section for the 
period covered by the plan, within 3 years after 
the State first receives funds under this sec-
tion— 
(I) will be sufficient to meet the cost of child 
care, and set in accordance with a cost esti-
mation model or cost study described in clause 
(ii) that is approved by the Secretary; and 
(II) will correspond to differences in quality 
(including improved quality) based on the 
State’s tiered system for measuring the quality 
of eligible child care providers described in sub-
paragraph (B). 
(ii) 
COST
ESTIMATION.—Such 
State 
plan 
shall— 
(I) demonstrate that the State has, after con-
sulting with relevant entities and stakeholders, 
developed and uses a statistically valid and reli-
able cost estimation model or cost study for the 
payment rates for direct child care services in 
the State that reflect rates for providers at each 
of the tiers of the State’s tiered system for meas-
uring the quality of eligible child care providers 
described in subparagraph (B), and variations 
in the cost of direct child care services by geo-
graphic area, type of provider, and age of child, 
and the additional costs associated with pro-
viding inclusive care; 
(II) certify that the State’s payment rates for 
direct child care services for which assistance is 
provided in accordance with this section— 
(aa) are set in accordance with the most re-
cent estimates from the most recent cost esti-
mation model or cost study under subclause (I), 
so that providers at each tier of the tiered sys-
tem for measuring provider quality described in 
subparagraph (B) receive a payment that is suf-
ficient to meet the requirements of such tier; 
(bb) are set so as to provide payments to pro-
viders not at the top tier of the tiered system 
that are sufficient to enable the providers to in-
crease quality to meet the requirements for the 
next tier; 
(cc) ensure adequate wages for staff of child 
care providers providing such direct child care 
services that— 
(AA) at a minimum, provide a living wage for 
all staff of such child care providers; and 
(BB) are equivalent to wages for elementary 
educators with similar credentials and experi-
ence in the State; and

of living increases to ensure those payment rates 
remain sufficient to meet the requirements of 
this section; and 
(III) certify that the State will update, not 
less often than once every 3 years, the cost esti-
mation model or cost study described in sub-
clause (I). 
(iii) PAYMENT
PRACTICES.—Such State plan 
shall include an assurance that the State will 
implement payment practices that support the 
fixed costs of providing direct child care serv-
ices.

State plan shall certify that the State has imple-
mented, or assure that the State will implement 
within 3 years after first receiving funds under 
this section, a tiered system for measuring the 
quality of eligible child care providers who pro-
vide child care services for which assistance is 
made available under this section. Such tiered 
system shall— 
(i) include a set of standards, for determining 
the tier of quality of a child care provider, 
that— 
(I) uses standards for a highest tier that at a 
minimum are equivalent to Head Start program 
performance standards described in section 
641A(a)(1)(B) of the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 
9836a(a)(1)(B)) or other equivalent evidence- 
based standards approved by the Secretary; and 
(II) includes quality indicators and thresholds 
that are appropriate for child development in 
different types of child care provider settings, 
including child care centers and the settings of 
family child care providers, and are appropriate 
for providers serving different age groups (in-
cluding mixed age groups) of children; 
(ii) include a different set of standards that 
includes indicators, when appropriate, for care 
during nontraditional hours of operation; and 
(iii) provide for sufficient resources and sup-
ports for child care providers at tiers lower than 
the highest tier to facilitate progression toward 
meeting higher quality standards. 
(C) ACHIEVING HIGH QUALITY FOR ALL CHIL-
DREN.—Such State plan shall certify the State 
has implemented, or will implement within 3 
years after first receiving funds under this sec-
tion, policies and financing practices that will 
ensure all eligible children can choose to attend 
child care at the highest quality tier within 6 
years after the date of enactment of this Act. 
(D) COMPENSATION.—Such plan shall provide 
a certification that the State has or will have 
within 3 years after first receiving funds under 
this section, a wage ladder for staff of eligible 
child care providers receiving assistance under 
this section, including a certification that wages 
for such staff, at a minimum, will meet the re-
quirements of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II)(cc). 
(E) SLIDING FEE SCALE FOR COPAYMENTS.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in clause 
(ii)(I), the State plan shall provide an assurance 
that the State will for the period covered by the 
plan use a sliding fee scale described in clause 
(ii) to determine a copayment for a family re-
ceiving assistance under this section (or, for a 
family receiving part-time care, a reduced co-
payment that is the proportionate amount of the 
full copayment). 
(ii) SLIDING FEE SCALE.—A full copayment de-
scribed in clause (i) shall use a sliding fee scale 
that provides that, for a family with a family 
income— 
(I) of not more than 75 percent of State me-
dian income for a family of the same size, the 
family shall not pay a copayment, toward the 
cost of the child care involved for all eligible 
children in the family; 
(II) of more than 75 percent but not more than 
100 percent of State median income for a family

(g) ALLOWABLE
SOURCES
OF
NON-FEDERAL 
SHARE.—For purposes of calculating the amount 
of the non-Federal share, as determined under 
subsection (c)(2)(B)(iii), relating to a payment

eral share— 
(1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evalu-
ated, including facilities or property, equipment, 
or services;

Head Start Act, or through any State spending 
on preschool services for any fiscal year that a 
State receives payments under subsection (c)(2) 
(referred to in this paragraph as the ‘‘reduction 
fiscal year’’) relative to the previous fiscal year, 
the Secretary, in collaboration with the Sec-
retary of Education, shall reduce support for 
such State under such subsection by the same 
amount as the total reduction in that State fis-
cal effort for such reduction fiscal year. 
(2) WAIVER.—The Secretary, in collaboration 
with the Secretary of Education, may waive the 
requirements of paragraph (1) if— 
(A) the Secretaries determine that a waiver 
would be appropriate due to a precipitous de-
cline in the financial resources of a State as a 
result of unforeseen economic hardship, or a 
natural disaster, that has necessitated across- 
the-board reductions in State services during the 
5-year period preceding the date of the deter-
mination, including for early childhood edu-
cation programs; or 
(B) due to the circumstance of a State requir-
ing reductions in specific programs, including 
early childhood education programs, the State 
presents to the Secretaries a justification and 
demonstration why other programs could not be 
reduced and how early childhood education 
programs in the State will not be disproportion-
ately harmed by such State reductions.

ceived under this section shall be used to supple-
ment and not supplant other Federal, State, and 
local public funds expended on prekindergarten

or health insurance issuer offering group or in-
dividual health insurance coverage shall pro-
vide coverage of selected insulin products, and

sharing than the levels specified in subsection 
(a) for selected insulin products described in this 
section that are delivered by an out-of-network 
provider. 
‘‘(d) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Subsection (a)

UNDER CATASTROPHIC PLANS.—Section 1302(e) of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(42 U.S.C. 18022(e)) is amended by adding at the

duced).

individual under this title, the Commissioner 
shall promptly notify the individual of such de-
termination and inform the individual of the 
right to appeal such determination in accord-
ance with the provisions of section 2205. Proper 
adjustment or recovery shall be made as follows:

ment to an individual of less than the correct 
amount, the Commissioner shall promptly pay 
the balance of the amount due to such under-
paid individual.

an individual of more than the correct amount, 
the Commissioner shall decrease any payment 
for a month under section 2202 to which such 
overpaid individual is entitled (except that no 
such payment may be decreased in any manner 
that results in weekly benefit amounts for each 
week ending during such month that are less 
than the lower of the weekly benefit amounts 
for each such week as determined for such indi-
vidual under section 2203(a) or the amount spec-
ified in clause (ii) with respect to such weekly 
benefit amounts of the individual), or shall re-
quire such overpaid individual to refund the 
amount in excess of the correct amount, or shall 
apply any combination of the foregoing. 
‘‘(ii) LIMITATION ON RECOVERY.— 
‘‘(I) AMOUNT SPECIFIED.—The amount speci-
fied in this clause with respect to a weekly ben-
efit amount of an individual for a week is an 
amount equal to the weekly benefit amount that 
would be determined for the individual for such 
week under section 2203(a) if the individual’s 
weekly benefit rate (as determined under section 
2203(b)) were equal to the applicable dollar 
amount as determined under subclause (II).

poses of subclause (I), the applicable dollar 
amount is—

determined for a week ending in a month in any 
calendar year after 2024, the corresponding 
amount established with respect to a weekly 
benefit amount determined for a week ending in 
a month in the calendar year preceding such 
calendar year or, if larger, the product of the 
corresponding amount specified in item (aa) 
with respect to a weekly benefit amount deter-
mined for a week ending in a month in calendar 
year 2024 multiplied by the quotient obtained by 
dividing— 
‘‘(AA) the national average wage index (as 
defined in section 2210) for the second calendar 
year preceding such calendar year, by

any case in which more than the correct amount 
of payment for comprehensive paid leave bene-
fits under section 2202 has been made, there 
shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recov-
ery from, any individual who was without fault 
in connection with the overpayment if such ad-
justment or recovery would defeat the purpose 
of this title or would impede efficient or effective 
administration of this title, or if such individual 
relied on the receipt or expected payment of 
comprehensive paid leave benefits under section 
2202 to make a financial decision. In considering 
whether an individual is without fault, the 
Commissioner shall take into account the indi-
vidual’s age and any physical impairment or 
mental impairment (including intellectual dis-
ability), limited English proficiency, low levels 
of literacy skills, educational limitations, and 
any other circumstances that may render the in-
dividual not at fault. 
‘‘(b) CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Any person who knowingly 
makes a false statement, misrepresents a fact, or 
omits material information in connection with 
an application for benefits under section 2202 or 
a periodic benefit claim report under section 
2204 shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty 
of not more than the amount determined under 
paragraph (2) for a calendar year for each such 
statement, misrepresentation, or omission. 
‘‘(2) AMOUNT DETERMINED.—The amount de-
termined under this paragraph for a calendar 
year shall be the amount that would be in effect 
for such calendar year if such penalty— 
‘‘(A) had been first established in the amount 
of $5,000 in calendar year 1994; and 
‘‘(B) had been initially adjusted for inflation 
in calendar year 2016. 
‘‘(c) EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—No person or entity who— 
‘‘(A) knowingly and willfully makes or causes 
to be made any false statement or representation 
of a material fact in any application for any 
benefit under this title, 
‘‘(B) at any time knowingly and willfully 
makes or causes to be made any false statement 
or representation of a material fact for use in 
determining rights to any such benefit, 
‘‘(C) having knowledge of the occurrence of 
any event affecting (i) his initial or continued 
right to any such benefit, or (ii) the initial or 
continued right to any such benefit of any other 
individual in whose behalf he has applied for or 
is receiving such benefit, conceals or fails to dis-
close such event with an intent fraudulently to 
secure such benefit either in a greater amount or 
quantity than is due or when no such benefit is 
authorized, 
‘‘(D) having made application to receive any 
such benefit for the use and benefit of another 
and having received it, knowingly and willfully 
converts such benefit or any part thereof to a 
use other than for the use and benefit of such 
other person, or 
‘‘(E) conspires to take any action described in 
any of subparagraphs (A) through (C), 
may represent, or submit evidence on behalf of, 
an individual applying for, or receiving, benefits 
under this title. 
‘‘(2) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—An exclusion under 
this paragraph shall be effective with respect to 
services furnished to any individual on or after 
the effective date of the exclusion. Nothing in 
this paragraph may be construed to preclude 
consideration of any medical evidence derived 
from services provided by a health care provider 
before the effective date of the exclusion of the 
health care provider under this subsection. 
‘‘(d) REDETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.— 
‘‘(A) TERMINATION
OR
REVERSAL
OF
BENE-
FITS.—The Commissioner shall immediately re-
determine the entitlement of an individual to 
comprehensive paid leave benefits under section 
2202 if there is reason to believe that fraud or 
similar fault was involved in the application of 
the individual for such benefits. 
‘‘(B) DISREGARD OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE.—When 
redetermining the entitlement, or making an ini-
tial determination of entitlement, of an indi-
vidual under this title, the Commissioner shall 
disregard any evidence if there is reason to be-
lieve that fraud or similar fault was involved in 
the providing of such evidence. 
‘‘(2) SIMILAR FAULT DESCRIBED.—For purposes 
of paragraph (1), similar fault is involved with 
respect to a determination if—

mination is knowingly concealed. 
‘‘(3) TERMINATION OF BENEFITS.—If, after re-
determining pursuant to this subsection the en-
titlement of an individual to comprehensive paid 
leave benefits, the Commissioner determines that 
there is insufficient evidence to support such en-
titlement, the Commissioner may terminate such 
entitlement and may treat benefits paid on the 
basis of such insufficient evidence as overpay-
ments.

fined in section 2210) for the most recent cal-
endar year that ends before the beginning of 
such preceding fiscal year, to

expended, for administrative expenses described 
in subsection (b)(1) during fiscal year 2024 or 
any subsequent fiscal year, except that such 
amount shall not be available in any fiscal year 
unless the Commissioner determines that the 
number of applications filed during such fiscal 
year for comprehensive paid leave benefits 
under section 2202(a) will exceed the number 
that were anticipated to be filed during such fis-
cal year (as determined by the Commissioner) by

TION OPTION FOR LEGACY STATES. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—In each calendar year be-
ginning with calendar year 2025, the Commis-
sioner shall make a grant to each State that, for 
the calendar year preceding such calendar year, 
was a legacy State and that met the data shar-
ing requirements of subsection (e), in an amount 
equal to the lesser of— 
‘‘(1) an amount, as estimated by the Commis-
sioner, equal to the total amount of comprehen-
sive paid leave benefits that would have been 
paid under section 2202 (including the costs to 
the Commissioner to administer such benefits, 
not to exceed (for purposes of estimating such 
total amount under this paragraph) 7 percent of 
the total amount of such benefits paid) to indi-
viduals who received paid family and medical 
leave benefits under a State law described in 
paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (b) during the 
calendar year preceding such calendar year if 
the State had not been a legacy State for such 
preceding calendar year; or 
‘‘(2) an amount equal to the total cost of paid 
family and medical leave benefits under a State 
law described in paragraph (1) or (3) of sub-
section (b) for the calendar year preceding such 
calendar year, including— 
‘‘(A) any paid family and medical leave bene-
fits provided by an employer (whether directly, 
under a contract with an insurer, or provided 
through a multiemployer plan) as described in 
subsection (d); and 
‘‘(B) the full cost to the State of administering 
such law (except that such cost may not exceed 
7 percent of the total amount of paid family and 
medical leave benefits paid under such State 
law). 
In any case in which, during any calendar 
year, the Commissioner has reason to believe 
that a State will be a legacy State and meet the 
data sharing requirements of subsection (e) for 
such calendar year, the Commissioner may make 
estimated payments during such calendar year 
of the grant which would be paid to such State 
in the succeeding calendar year, to be adjusted 
as appropriate in the succeeding calendar year. 
‘‘(b) LEGACY STATE.—For purposes of this sec-
tion, the term ‘legacy State’ for a calendar year 
means a State with respect to which the Com-
missioner determines that— 
‘‘(1) the State has enacted, not later than the 
date of enactment of this title, a State law that 
provides paid family and medical leave benefits; 
‘‘(2) for any calendar year that begins before 
the date that is 3 years after the date of enact-
ment of this title, the State certifies to the Com-
missioner that the State intends to remain a leg-
acy State and meet the data sharing require-
ments of subsection (e) at least through the first 
calendar year that begins on or after such date; 
and 
‘‘(3) for any calendar year that begins on or 
after such date, a State law of the State pro-
vides for a State program to remain in effect 
throughout such calendar year that provides 
comprehensive paid family and medical leave 
benefits (which may be paid directly by the 
State or, if permitted under such State law, by 
an employer pursuant to such State law)— 
‘‘(A) for at least 4 full workweeks of leave 
during each 12-month period to at least all of 
those individuals in the State who would be eli-
gible for comprehensive paid leave benefits 
under section 2202 (without regard to section 
2202(c)(2)(D)), except that the State shall pro-
vide such benefits for leave from employment by 
the State or any political subdivision thereof, 
and may elect to provide such benefits for leave 
from any other governmental employment; 
‘‘(B) at a wage replacement rate that is at 
least equivalent to the wage replacement rate 
under the comprehensive paid leave benefit pro-
gram under section 2202 (without regard to sec-
tion 2202(c)(2)(D)). 
‘‘(c) COVERED EMPLOYMENT UNDER THE LAW 
OF A LEGACY STATE.—For purposes of this title, 
the term ‘covered employment under the law of 
a legacy State’ means employment (or self-em-
ployment) with respect to which an individual 
would be eligible to receive paid family and med-
ical benefits under the State law of a State, as 
described in paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection 
(b), during any period during which such State 
is a legacy State. 
‘‘(d) EMPLOYER-PROVIDED BENEFITS IN A LEG-
ACY STATE.— 
‘‘(1) TREATMENT
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
THIS 
TITLE.—Notwithstanding any provision of sec-
tion 2209, in the case of a State that permits 
paid family and medical leave benefits to be pro-
vided by an employer (whether directly, under a 
contract with an insurer, or provided through a 
multiemployer plan) pursuant to a State law de-
scribed in paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection 
(b)— 
‘‘(A) such benefits shall be considered, for all 
purposes under this title, paid family and med-
ical leave benefits under the law of a legacy 
State; and 
‘‘(B) leave for which such benefits are paid 
shall be considered, for all such purposes, leave 
from covered employment under the law of a 
legacy State. 
‘‘(2) DISTRIBUTION OF GRANT FUNDS.—In any 
case in which paid family and medical leave 
benefits are provided by one or more employers 
(whether directly, under a contract with an in-
surer, or provided through a multiemployer 
plan) in a legacy State pursuant to a State law 
described in paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection 
(b), the State, upon the receipt of any grant 
amount under subsection (a), may distribute an 
appropriate share of such grant to each such 
employer. 
‘‘(e) DATA SHARING.—As a condition of receiv-
ing a grant under subsection (a) in a calendar 
year, a State shall enter into an agreement with 
the Commissioner under which the State shall 
provide the Commissioner— 
‘‘(1) with information, to be provided periodi-
cally as determined by the Commissioner, con-
cerning individuals who received a paid leave 
benefit under a State law described in para-
graph (1) or (3) of subsection (b), including each 
individual’s name, information to establish the 
individual’s identity, dates for which such paid 
leave benefits were paid, the amount of such 
paid leave benefit, and, to the extent available, 
such other information concerning such individ-
uals as necessary for the purpose of carrying

‘‘(2) not later than July 1 of such calendar 
year, the amount described in subsection (a)(2) 
for the calendar year preceding such calendar 
year; and 
‘‘(3) such other information as needed to de-
termine compliance with grant requirements. 
‘‘(f) GREATER BENEFITS PERMITTED.—Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to prohibit a 
legacy State or an employer providing benefits 
pursuant to a legacy State law from providing 
paid family and medical leave benefits that ex-
ceed the requirements described in this section.

vided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary,

erly allocable to members of such group included 
on such return. 
‘‘(C) TREATMENT
OF
DIVIDENDS
AND
OTHER 
AMOUNTS.—In the case of any corporation 
which is not included on a consolidated return

from such other corporation (reduced to the ex-
tent provided by the Secretary in regulations or 
other guidance) and other amounts required to

partnerships required to be included in gross in-
come under this chapter.

INTO
ACCOUNT 
CERTAIN ITEMS OF FOREIGN INCOME.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If, for any taxable year, a

justed financial statement income of such tax-
payer shall be adjusted to take into account 
such taxpayer’s pro rata share (determined 
under rules similar to the rules under section 
951(a)(2)) of items taken into account in com-
puting the net income or loss set forth on the 
applicable financial statement of each such con-
trolled foreign corporation with respect to which 
such taxpayer is a United States shareholder. 
‘‘(B) NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENTS.—In any case in 
which the adjustment determined under sub-
paragraph (A) would result in a negative ad-
justment for such taxable year— 
‘‘(i) no adjustment shall be made under this 
paragraph for such taxable year, and 
‘‘(ii) the amount of the adjustment determined 
under this paragraph for the succeeding taxable 
year (determined without regard to this para-
graph) shall be reduced by an amount equal to 
the negative adjustment for such taxable year.

case of a foreign corporation, to determine ad-
justed financial statement income, the principles 
of section 882 shall apply.

propriately adjusted to disregard any Federal 
income taxes, or income, war profits, or excess 
profits taxes (within the meaning of section 901) 
with respect to a foreign country or possession 
of the United States, which are taken into ac-
count on the taxpayer’s applicable financial 
statement. To the extent provided by the Sec-
retary, the preceding sentence shall not apply to 
income, war profits, or excess profits taxes 
(within the meaning of section 901) that are im-
posed by a foreign country or possession of the 
United States and taken into account on the 
taxpayer’s applicable financial statement if the 
taxpayer does not choose to take the benefits of 
section 901. The Secretary shall prescribe such 
regulations or other guidance as may be nec-
essary and appropriate to provide for the proper 
treatment of current and deferred taxes for pur-
poses of this paragraph, including the time at 
which such taxes are properly taken into ac-
count.

WITH
RESPECT
TO
DIS-
REGARDED ENTITIES.—Adjusted financial state-
ment income shall be adjusted to take into ac-
count any adjusted financial statement income

plies, the adjusted financial statement income 
(determined without regard to this paragraph) 
shall be reduced by the amounts referred to in 
section 1382(b) (relating to patronage dividends 
and per-unit retain allocations) to the extent 
such amounts were not otherwise taken into ac-
count in determining adjusted financial state-
ment income.

TIONS.—Adjusted financial statement income

pursuant to section 7(i) or section 7(j) of such 
Act (43 U.S.C. 1606(i) and 1606(j)) only at such 
time as the deductions are allowed for tax pur-
poses. 
‘‘(9) AMOUNTS
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
ELECTIONS 
FOR DIRECT PAYMENT OF CERTAIN CREDITS.—Ad-
justed financial statement income shall be ap-
propriately adjusted to disregard any amount 
received as a refund of taxes which is attrib-
utable to an election under section 6417. 
‘‘(10) CONSISTENT
TREATMENT
OF
MORTGAGE 
SERVICING INCOME OF TAXPAYER OTHER THAN A 
REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Adjusted financial state-
ment income shall be adjusted so as not to in-
clude any item of income in connection with a

when such income is included in gross income 
under any other provision of this chapter.

REASONABLE

ance of taxes imposed by this chapter with re-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
into the RECORD on H.R. 5376. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the bill before us 
today marks a triumph for our Nation. 
After months of negotiations within 
our Caucus and our committees, with 
our colleagues in the Senate, and with 
the White House, I am proud to present 
the most consequential legislation for 
American families since the New Deal. 
The Build Back Better Act makes 
historic investments over 10 years to 
overhaul and reimagine entire sectors 
of our economy and society so that ev-
eryone, not just those at the top, will 
benefit from a growing economy. 
This bill delivers the most trans-
formative investment in children and 
caregiving in generations, the largest 
effort to combat climate change in 
American history, the biggest expan-
sion of affordable health coverage in a 
decade, the most significant effort to 
bring down costs and strengthen the 
middle class in generations, invest-
ments and key reforms to make our 
tax system more equitable, and more. 
To be clear, if we were only making 
the largest investment in childcare in 
the history of the Nation, saving most 
American families more than half of 
their spending on childcare, that would 
be a major victory for the American 
people. 
If we were only guaranteeing uni-
versal preschool for all 3- and 4-year- 
olds, the first expansion of basic public 
education in our country in 100 years, 
that would be a major victory for the 
American people.

If we were only making our Nation’s 
largest investment ever to combat the 
climate crisis, that would be a major 
victory for the American people. 
If we were only capping out-of-pocket 
prescription drug costs under Medicare 
at $2,000, saving more than a million 
seniors an average of $1,200 a year, that 
would be a major victory for the Amer-
ican people. 
If we were only expanding the Afford-
able Care Act so that those who have 
been locked out of Medicaid can get 
good coverage and then requiring all 
insurance companies to provide insulin 
for no more than $35 a month, that 
would be a major victory for the Amer-
ican people. 
If we were only making the single 
largest and most comprehensive invest-
ment in affordable housing in U.S. his-
tory, that would be a major victory for 
the American people. 
If we were only providing one of the 
largest middle-class tax cuts in our Na-
tion’s history, that would be a major 
victory for the American people. 
But in this bill, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act, we don’t just do one of these. 
We do all of them. Each of these invest-
ments on its own will make an extraor-
dinary impact on the lives of American 
families. Together, they will be trans-
formative. 
Here is the kicker. Because our tax 
system has been so unjust, so tilted to 
benefit the well-off and the well-con-
nected, we can pay for all this by sim-
ply making our tax code more fair. 
It is a hell of a deal. It is why Nobel 
Prize-winning economists and other ex-
perts 
backed 
this 
paid-for 
and 
progrowth agenda, citing how it will 
make our tax system more equitable, 
ease longer term inflationary pres-
sures, and help American families build 
a much stronger future. 
That is what governing should be 
about. It is not a game. We aren’t 
elected to make a scene. We are elected 
to make a difference and to make the 
lives of the people we serve better. 
Enacting this legislation will be a 
momentous achievement for Congress. 
More importantly, it will change lives. 
It will save lives. It will deliver on the 
promise of the American Dream for 
generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this is an absolute 
disgrace. It is beyond belief how ter-
rible this moment is. It is embar-
rassing to the people of the United 
States what is going on. 
We have seen three versions of this 
bill written behind closed doors in 
Speaker PELOSI’s office. As we stand 
here this second—as we stand here, 
Madam Speaker, this second—they are 
rewriting a fourth version of the bill in 
Speaker PELOSI’s office. 
We will be recessing shortly, some-
time during this debate, so the Rules 
Committee 
can 
present 
a 
fourth 
version of a 2,000-page bill. Once again, 
in this House, Speaker PELOSI is trying 
to pass a bill before anyone knows 
what is in it, so then the American 
people can read it after it has been 
passed. 
Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, I 
will tell you what is in the version of 
the bill right now. It is the worst piece 
of legislation that I have seen in my 
entire life of public service. It is trans-
formational. It will completely change 
America as we know it, all at the ex-
pense of working-class families. 
They call it the Build Back Better 
bill. Let me tell you what those three 
b’s stand for: bankrupts the economy; 
benefits the wealthy; and builds the 
Washington machine. 
We are standing here because this is 
a budget bill. It originated in the Budg-
et Committee. Speaker PELOSI
said 
that a budget is a statement of your 
values. Well, let’s see the Democratic 
Party’s values by what is in their bill. 
Of this 2,100-page bill, it bankrupts 
the economy. They will try to tell you 
that the bill is less than $2 trillion. 
They will try to tell you that a $4.5 
trillion spending bill will cost zero. 
Well, the American people are not stu-
pid. You don’t spend $4.5 trillion and it 
costs zero. That is one of their talking 
points. 
Even Senator MANCHIN, a Democrat 
Senator from West Virginia, says that 
this bill creates shell games. 
We know there are all kinds of budg-
et gimmicks to try to make it look 
like it only spends $1.5 trillion. In fact, 
it spends $4.5 trillion. Even The New 
York Times agrees that it spends a 
whole lot more money than what the 
Democrats are saying. 
It is also not only the largest spend-
ing bill in the history of this United 
States; it is the largest tax increase in 
the history of the United States. It in-
creases taxes on working-class families 
of all income levels, all at a time when 
we are facing record inflation. 
Since Joe Biden has taken office, in-
flation is over 7 percent. In my home 
State, inflation is over 8 percent. 
Madam Speaker, the folks on the 
other side of the aisle will say that in-
flation is just a high-class problem. 
They will say that it is only transitory. 
But I can tell you, the people of Mis-
souri and the people across this coun-
try care about those increasing prices 
in the supermarket, not the prices in 
the stock market. 
This bill only punishes Main Street 
while rewarding Wall Street, and you 
should be ashamed of what is going on 
in this bill, Madam Speaker. This bill 
benefits the wealthy beyond belief. 
The Democrats always say that they 
are the party of the working class. 
Well, in fact, the 10 most wealthy con-
gressional districts in this body are all 
held by liberal Democrats. In fact, Wall 
Street spent more than $70 million to 
defeat Donald Trump and to elect Joe 
Biden. Why are they doing this bill? 
They are doing this bill to reward their 
political friends, their constituents, 
their allies, their donors. 
The second largest program in this 
bill is a tax cut for millionaires, $250 
billion for a tax cut for millionaires. A 
millionaire family will get $25,900 in a 
tax break in this bill, but a middle- 
class family will get $20. 
b 1030 
They are just rewarding their friends. 
But, Madam Speaker, do you know 
what? 
Those millionaires also get $12,500 to 
buy luxury electric cars. 
Guess what, Madam Speaker? 
Those millionaires also get govern-
ment taxpayer-paid family leave. The 
list goes on and on about the benefits 
to the wealthy. This body should be 
ashamed of what is about to happen. 
The third B, it builds the Washington 
bureaucracy. This bill creates more 
than 150 new Federal programs. 
It is all about control. This bill is 
about 
controlling 
every 
aspect 
of 
Americans’ lives whether it is their 
paychecks, 
whether 
it 
is 
their 
healthcare decisions, or whether it is 
their kids’ education. I would think 
that the Democrats, after seeing what 
happened a few weeks ago in Virginia, 
New Jersey, and all across this coun-
try, would know that the American 
people are fed up with government con-
trol. In fact, over the weekend, a poll 
said 60 percent of Americans believe 
that Joe Biden and the Democrats are 
expanding government control beyond 
belief. 
If we want to protect working-class 
families, if we want to protect our free-
doms, and if we want to save America, 
we have to kill this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, it 
must be easy to be a Republican in 
Congress these days because you can 
make things up. You can throw out 
numbers without any fear of being con-
tradicted. But we will have, probably 
by the end of the day, a CBO score from 
the Congressional Budget Office which 
will undercut virtually every argument 
that the gentleman from Missouri 
made. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT), who is the distinguished chair-
man of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee and also a member of the Budg-
et Committee. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, the Build Back Better Act ad-
dresses urgent challenges that workers, 
families, and businesses face every day. 
With provisions just within the juris-
diction of the Education and Labor 
Committee, the bill makes childcare 
affordable and secures universal pre-
school for 3- and 4-year-olds lowering 
the costs of working families and 
boosting our economy by helping par-
ents reenter the workforce. It also al-
lows 9 million more children to receive 
healthy school meals. 
It lowers the cost of prescription 
drugs, and it lowers the cost of higher 
education.

high-quality job training programs, it 
gives workers more opportunities and 
enhances the skills of our workforce. 
Madam Speaker, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act is a historic proposal that will 
lower costs for nearly every American 
family, creates good-paying jobs, and 
sets a strong foundation for the future 
of this country—and it is paid for. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
our colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the 
good gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
the latest estimate for the Democrats’ 
build back broke bill is $4.9 trillion. 
That averages about $40,000 per family 
over the next decade. 
They say it is paid for. Well, by 
whom? 
By you, of course, through direct 
taxes, tax-driven price increases, and 
worst of all, inflation. 
And what do you get? 
Well, amnesty for 7 million illegal 
aliens. That is the entire population of 
Alaska, Wyoming, Vermont, Rhode Is-
land, Delaware, North Dakota, South 
Dakota, and Montana combined. 
Now, explain to me how working 
Americans are helped by flooding the 
market with low-wage foreign labor. 
The trillions of dollars of excess 
spending by the Democrats has already 
driven the inflation rate to 6.2 percent 
and 
rising. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
that 
means if you earn $50,000 a year, the 
Democrats just took $3,100 of that. If 
you have managed to put $100,000 to-
wards your retirement, the Democrats 
just took $6,200 of that. 
Policy matters. When Republicans 
reduced the tax and regulatory bur-
dens, we delivered the lowest unem-
ployment rate in 50 years, the lowest 
poverty rate in 60 years, and the fastest 
wage growth in 40 years. The Demo-
crats have reversed these policies and 
reproduced the misery that we are suf-
fering today. 
The American people know that we 
are on the wrong track and that this 
bill sends us deeper into that cold and 
bleak winter. 
Build back better? 
How about put things back the way 
they were before you broke them, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR), who is the 
vice chair of the Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding time. 
Sometimes what happens in Congress 
is complicated. It is wrapped in par-
liamentary procedure and language 
that is hard to understand. 
So let’s be very clear about the legis-
lation that we are discussing today. 
The Build Back Better Act is a tax cut 
for working families. It is an extension 
of the child tax credit and preschool 
access to help parents get back to 
work. It is the largest ever initiative to 
fight climate change. It is a tool to 
give every American a chance to suc-
ceed. 
Passing this bill will lift children out 
of poverty, expand our middle class, 
and make healthcare more affordable. 
It is simple. 
Madam Speaker, we need to pass this 
bill because the American people de-
serve this investment. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA). 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member SMITH
for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to this reckless so-
cial spending bill. It is simply wrong 
that, rather than funding mandatory 
programs like Social Security and 
Medicare—which are on the verge of in-
solvency over the next 10 years—Demo-
crats instead are adding 150 new pro-
grams to this bill. Think about that, 
seniors. Your money that is coming to 
you every day is on the verge of bank-
ruptcy, and yet the Democrats are add-
ing another 150 programs. 
Academic economists all over our 
country are saying that this bill is a 
complete disaster for all Americans be-
cause it will dramatically increase 
taxes. The Penn Wharton Budget Model 
estimates that the new programs will 
dramatically increase the debt by $4 
trillion every year. Families and busi-
nesses can’t continue to go down this 
path of continuing to see increases in 
our gas, our groceries, and our hard-
ware supplies all because of this reck-
less spending that continues to happen 
by the Democrats. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), who is the 
Democratic Caucus chairman and a dis-
tinguished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair of the 
Budget Committee for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, there is a big dif-
ference between Democrats and Repub-
licans. We fight for the people; they 
fight for the privileged few. We will 
pass the Build Back Better Act. They 
passed the GOP tax scam where 83 per-
cent of the benefits went to the 
wealthiest 1 percent so they could sub-
sidize the lifestyles of the rich and 
shameless. There is a big difference be-
tween Democrats and Republicans. 
The Build Back Better Act will in-
vest in the creation of millions of good- 
paying jobs and cut taxes for working 
families. It will lower childcare costs, 
housing costs, and education costs; and 
it will drive down the high cost of life-
saving prescription drugs. 
The Build Back Better Act will in-
vest in a green economy—a sustainable 
economy and a resilient economy—and 
lower energy costs for everyday Ameri-
cans. 
The Build Back Better Act will cre-
ate an economy that works for every 
single American creating opportunity 
and prosperity in every single ZIP 
Code. 
Madam Speaker, I thank President 
Biden for his extraordinary leadership. 
Democrats don’t talk about it; we are 
about it. And because we are going to 
build back better for the people here in 
America, the best is yet to come. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to read 
a quote of a Senator who happens to be 
the budget chair on the other side of 
the aisle. He is quoted, ‘‘You can’t be a 
political party that talks about de-
manding the wealthy pay their fair 
share of taxes and then end up with a 
bill that gives large tax breaks to 
many millionaires. 
‘‘You can’t do that. The hypocrisy is 
too strong. It’s bad policy, it’s bad poli-
tics.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I agree with Sen-
ator BERNIE SANDERS. In this bill the 
hypocrisy is way too strong. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the great gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. ROUZER). 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the 2,000-plus-page 
bill before us today has countless pro-
visions that are going to substantially 
increase the debt, incentivize even 
more people not to work, and hike the 
taxes of the very ones who create the 
jobs. 
It levies more than $400 billion in tax 
hikes on small businesses, and it in-
cludes a $1.2 trillion Made in America 
tax plan that is going to do nothing but 
send jobs overseas. It spends nearly $80 
billion so the IRS can go after the av-
erage taxpayer and snoop around his 
bank account. It eliminates work re-
quirements for welfare when, in fact, 
we have 10.4 million jobs available. 
It prevents lifesaving drugs from 
coming to market and disincentivizes 
the innovation necessary to discover 
cures. It hinders domestic energy pro-
duction and even imposes a tax on nat-
ural gas. 
Should this monstrosity become law, 
it will hurt the economy, drive up the 
debt, 
and 
increase 
inflation 
even 
more—all of which means the standard 
of living of each and every American is 
going to decline. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, virtually every Re-
publican who comes to the microphone 
today will say that this is an infla-
tionary bill. We know that. They have 
said that time after time after time. 
Unfortunately, the experts disagree 
with them. Seventeen Nobel econo-
mists have written a letter stating 
that they believe this, over the long 
term, will ease inflationary pressures. 
Former Treasury Secretary Larry 
Summers, who is as much of an infla-
tion hawk as there is in this country, I 
think, said just last week, ‘‘I’m for 
Build Back Better. I’m for it because of 
what it’ll do for the environment. I’m 
for it because of what it’ll do for the 
society.

November 18, 2021 
‘‘I don’t think it’s going to have a 
meaningful impact on inflation. It 
spends less money over 10 years than 
we spent just last year. Its spending is 
largely offset by tax increases. And it 
includes measures that will actually 
increase supply.’’ 
This is from the former Secretary of 
the Treasury, Larry Summers. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KIL-
DEE), who is a distinguished member of 
the Budget Committee. 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding and 
for his work on this important piece of 
legislation. 
With the Build Back Better budget, 
we help lower costs for the working 
families that I represent. We lower 
healthcare costs by allowing Medicare 
to negotiate the price of drugs like in-
sulin, lowering out-of-pocket costs for 
those families back home that I rep-
resent. 
It will lower childcare costs by ensur-
ing universal preschool for all 3- and 4- 
year-olds and expanding the child tax 
credit, which is a monthly tax cut 
helping working families with children 
pay for groceries and school supplies 
and take care of their monthly mort-
gage payments. 
This Build Back Better budget isn’t 
free. It is fully paid for. It is paid for by 
making corporations and the wealthi-
est Americans finally step up and begin 
to pay their fair share. 
Today, Democrats are delivering on 
this important legislation to cut taxes 
and to lower costs for working Ameri-
cans and for those middle-class fami-
lies that I represent. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, only in this Chamber will you 
hear people say that if you spend tril-
lions more dollars it will only make in-
flation go down. The American people 
aren’t that stupid. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the fine gentleman from New York (Mr. 
GARBARINO). 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this so-called reconciliation 
bill. This Build Back Better bill is 
nothing more than a sham to push far 
radical progressive policies on Amer-
ica, policies that America doesn’t want 
and doesn’t need. This will be the larg-
est spending bill in our Nation’s his-
tory, the largest tax increase in our 
Nation’s history, and it is going to fall 
on the backs of middle-income and low- 
income families. 
And for what, Madam Speaker? 
A massive government takeover with 
150 new programs when we can’t even 
work the programs we have now well. 
It would grant amnesty to 7 million il-
legal immigrants and put billions into 
the Green New Deal. 
How do they plan to pay for it, 
Madam Speaker? 
By weaponizing the IRS to go after 
small businesses and families. But that 
won’t be enough because of the price 
tag of this bill. 
It will explode our national debt and 
my grandchildren will have to pay for 
this. 
This socialist spending spree is a bad 
bill. It is bad for Long Island; it is bad 
for the Nation. I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote against it. 
b 1045 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
That is another thing we are going to 
hear continuously throughout the day, 
and that is that these are socialist pro-
grams; just as we heard last week that 
building infrastructure in this country 
was a socialist activity. And now 
childcare is socialist. Public education 
is socialist. Caring for our seniors is so-
cialist. Dealing with climate change is 
socialist. 
I would like to get a definition from 
my Republican colleagues about what 
socialism is because the American peo-
ple see this very differently; and vir-
tually every poll on this piece of legis-
lation has shown overwhelming sup-
port for each the elements that we are 
proposing. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for his great 
leadership. 
This bill is about people; people who 
are working, people who need help. It is 
about people; the American people. 
I am very happy that this bill really 
focuses on the needs of people in Texas. 
In Texas, people are paying $9,428 for a 
toddler, but we are now going to pro-
vide them with childcare for 3- and 4- 
year olds, and free childcare. We are 
going to provide it for 2 million-plus 
children in the State of Texas. We are, 
in essence, going to make sure that 
these children are learning. 
You want to ask about inflation? 
That is corporate greed. Everyone 
knows when corporations raise the 
price of goods, there is inflation. But 
economists know that that is not going 
to exist because we are putting money 
in the pockets of working men and 
women, giving them a child tax cut. 
We are also providing students to be 
able to go to community college, 
HBCUs, 4-year colleges with $550 in 
Pell Grants. That is what this bill is 
about, helping people; helping people 
with their childcare, helping people go 
to school. 
It is also about making sure that the 
hungry children in Texas are able to 
eat. 1,642,000 students will be able to re-
ceive food. That is what this is about; 
putting money where people are having 
the need. 
And yes, making sure that uninsured 
people, 766,000 in Texas without any in-
surance, suffering through the pan-
demic, now have insurance. 
And we know that there has been an 
increase in violence; $2.5 billion in pre-
venting violence. 
This is about people; people who will 
have housing. It is about people. Vote 
for the Build Back Better Act. I thank 
President Biden. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in strong 
support of the Build Back Better Act (RCP 
117–18, H.R. 5376), and am proud to have 
this opportunity to explain why this $1.75 bil-
lion package, conceived and advanced by 
President 
Biden 
and 
House 
Democrats, 
makes visionary and transformative invest-
ments to change for the better the health, 
well-being, and financial security of America’s 
workers and families. 
Today we are completing the job we began 
with the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Framework, which I witnessed President 
Biden sign on the South Lawn of the White 
House. 
To put it all in perspective, Madam Speaker, 
we have before us a once in a century oppor-
tunity to make gigantic progress in making 
ours a more perfect union, and to do it in a 
single bound with enactment of the Build Back 
Better Act, the most transformative legislation 
passed by this Congress since the Great Soci-
ety and the New Deal. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
earlier this year: 
‘‘At this point in time in this nation, we need 
to go big. We need to quit counting the egg- 
sucking legs on the cows and count the cows 
and just move. And move forward and move 
right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall 
ourselves, and then we shall save our coun-
try.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I am especially excited to 
support this bill because it directly impacts the 
members of my community and will improve 
the lives of Texans everywhere. 
The Build Back Better Act will bring down 
costs that have held back families in Texas for 
decades by cutting taxes and making child 
care, home care, education, health care, and 
housing more affordable. 
These investments will provide new learning 
opportunities for children, help parents, and 
especially working parents, make ends meet, 
and position the economy for stronger growth 
for years to come. 
The Build Back Better Act will create good- 
paying jobs for residents of Texas, combating 
climate change, giving our kids cleaner air and 
water, and making America the leader in glob-
al innovation and 21st century manufacturing. 
Specifically, Madam Speaker, the Build 
Back Better Act delivers the largest investment 
in child care and early education in history by 
providing access to affordable child care. 
Child care is a major strain for families in 
Texas, where the average annual cost of a 
child care center for a toddler is $9,428, 
meaning that a Texas family with two young 
children would on average spend 21 percent 
of their income on child care for one year. 
The lack of affordable options also makes it 
difficult for parents, and especially mothers, to

remain in their jobs, contributing to the 26.1 
percent gender gap in workforce participation 
between mothers and fathers in Texas. 
The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas 
to provide access to child care for 2,011,503 
young children (ages 0–5) per year from fami-
lies earning under 2.5 times the Texas median 
income (about $205,204 for a family of 4), and 
ensure these families pay no more than 7 per-
cent of their income on high-quality child care. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide uni-
versal, high-quality, free preschool for every 3- 
and 4-year old in America. 
In contrast, today, only 24 percent of the 
775,102 3- and 4-year-olds in Texas have ac-
cess to publicly-funded preschool, and it costs 
about $8,600 per year for those who cannot 
access a publicly-funded program. 
The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas 
to expand access to free, high-quality pre-
school to more than 588,286 additional 3- and 
4-year-olds per year and increase the quality 
of preschool for children who are already en-
rolled. 
Parents will be able to send their children to 
the preschool setting of their choice—from 
public schools to child care providers to Head 
Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, 
allowing more parents to go back to work, and 
building a stronger foundation for Texas’s fu-
ture economic competitiveness. 
The Build Back Better Act cuts taxes and 
reduces some of the largest expenses for 
workers and families, like education, health 
care, and housing. 
Madam Speaker, the average cost of a 2- 
year degree in Texas is $2,885 per year, and 
$11,096 per year for a 4-year degree, strain-
ing many student budgets. 
To help unlock the opportunities of an edu-
cation beyond high school, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act will increase maximum Pell Grant 
awards by $550 for students at public and pri-
vate non-profit institutions, supporting the 
486,377 students in Texas who rely on Pell 
grants. 
The Build Back Better Act will also invest in 
Texas’s 112 minority-serving institutions and 
the students they serve, including Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), 
Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and 
Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). 
Madam Speaker, of the world’s biggest 
economies, the United States is second to last 
in investing in workforce development, and 
funding for federal job training programs has 
dropped by almost half since 2001. 
The Build Back Better Act invests in training 
programs that will prepare Texas’s workers for 
high-quality jobs in fast-growing sectors like 
public health, child care, manufacturing, IT, 
and clean energy. Fifty-nine public community 
colleges in Texas will have the opportunity to 
benefit from grants to develop and deliver in-
novative training programs and expand proven 
ones. 
Madam Speaker, 18 percent of children in 
Texas live in food insecure households, harm-
ing their long-term health and ability to suc-
ceed in school. 
The Build Back Better Act will ensure that 
the nutritional needs of Texas’s children are 
met by expanding access to free school meals 
to an additional 1,642,000 students during the 
school year and providing 3,631,226 students 
with resources to purchase food over the sum-
mer. 
When it comes to housing costs, more than 
1.7 million renters in Texas are rent burdened, 
meaning they spend more than 30 percent of 
their income on rent, while homeownership re-
mains out of reach for many families. 
The Build Back Better Act expands rental 
assistance for Texas renters, while also in-
creasing the supply of high-quality housing 
through the construction and rehabilitation of 
over 1 million affordable housing units nation-
wide. 
The Build Back Better Act addresses the 
capital needs of the entire public housing 
stock in America, and it includes one of the 
largest investments in down payment assist-
ance in history, enabling more first-generation 
homebuyers to purchase their first home. 
Madam Speaker, access to affordable qual-
ity health care should be a right, not a privi-
lege, and residents of Texas facing illness 
should never have to worry about how they 
are going to pay for treatment. 
The Build Back Better Act will close the 
Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of 
Americans gain health insurance, extend 
through 2025 the American Rescue Plan’s 
health insurance premium reductions for those 
who buy coverage on their own, and help 
older Americans access affordable hearing 
care by expanding Medicare. 
In Texas, that means 1,554,000 uninsured 
people will gain coverage, including the 
771,000 who fell into the Medicaid coverage 
gap, and 1,066,400 will on average save hun-
dreds of dollars per year. 
In addition, the Build Back Better Act will 
support maternal health and invest in national 
preparedness for future pandemics. 
Finally, the Build Back Better Act will ex-
pand access to home- and community-based 
care to more of Texas’s senior citizens and 
disabled citizens and improve the quality and 
wages of caregiving jobs. 
Madam Speaker, the federal budget is an 
expression of the nation’s values and the in-
vestments made to Build America Back Better 
are a clear declaration of congressional 
Democrats’ commitment to ensuring that our 
government, our economy, and our systems 
work For The People. 
These long-overdue investments in Amer-
ica’s future will be felt in every corner of the 
country and across every sector of American 
life, building on the success of the American 
Rescue Plan, accommodating historic infra-
structure investments in the legislative pipe-
line, and addressing longstanding deficits in 
our communities by ending an era of chronic 
underinvestment so we can emerge from our 
current crises a stronger, more equitable na-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we 
took in February 2021 when we passed the 
American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the 
right direction, but it was a targeted response 
to the immediate and urgent public health and 
economic crises; it was not a long-term solu-
tion to many of the pressing challenges facing 
our nation that have built up over decades of 
disinvestment in our nation and its people in 
every region and sector of the country. 
We simply can no longer afford the costs of 
neglect and inaction; the time to act is now. 
The Build Back Better Act makes the trans-
formative investments that we need to con-
tinue growing our economy, lower costs for 
working families, and position the United 
States as a global leader in innovation and the 
jobs of the future. 
This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build 
on the successes of the American Rescue 
Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal re-
sponsibility and broadly shared prosperity for 
generations to come. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide re-
sources to improve our education, health, and 
child care systems, invest in clean energy and 
sustainability, address the housing crisis, and 
more; all while setting America up to compete 
and win in the decades ahead. 
The Build Back Better Act is paid for by en-
suring that the wealthy and big corporations 
are paying their fair share and Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year will not see 
their taxes increase by a penny. 
Let me repeat that: No American making 
less than $400,000 a year will not see their 
taxes increase by a penny. 
In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments 
made by the Build Back Better Act will expand 
opportunity for all and build an economy pow-
ered by shared prosperity and inclusive 
growth, and I would like to go into a little more 
detail about the specific ways this bill will help 
the people of Texas. 
Contrary to what my friends on the other 
side of the aisle will say, the Build Back Better 
Act will cut taxes for Texas families and work-
ers, not increase them. 
Prior to the pandemic, 15 percent of chil-
dren under the age of 18 in Texas lived in 
poverty. 
The Build Back Better Act will bolster finan-
cial security and spur economic growth in 
Texas by reducing taxes on the middle class 
and those striving to break into it. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act ex-
tends Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of 
$300/month per child under 6 or $250/month 
per child ages 6 to 17, which will continue the 
largest one-year reduction in child poverty in 
history. 
And critically, the agreement includes per-
manent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, 
meaning that the neediest families will con-
tinue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over 
the long-run. 
The Build Back Better Act will also provide 
a tax cut of up to $1,500 in tax cuts for more 
than 1.5 million low-wage workers in Texas by 
extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion. 
The Build Back Better Act will address the 
existential threat Texans face due to climate 
change by making the largest investment into 
our country’s green future in American history. 
From 2010 to 2020, Texas experienced 67 
extreme weather events, costing up to $200 
billion in damages. 
The Build Back Better Act will set the United 
States on course to meet its climate targets— 
a 50–52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions below 2005 levels by 2030—in a 
way that creates good-paying union jobs, 
grows domestic industries, and advances envi-
ronmental justice. 
The Build Back Better Act represents the 
largest ever single investment in a clean en-
ergy economy—across buildings, transpor-
tation, industry, electricity, agriculture, and cli-
mate smart practices in our lands and waters. 
And the Build Back Better Act will create a 
new Civilian Climate Corps that will enlist a di-
verse generation of Texans in conserving our 
public lands, bolstering community resilience, 
and addressing the changing climate, all while 
putting good-paying union jobs within reach. 
In clean energy and in other sectors, the 
Build Back Better Act will also strengthen do-
mestic manufacturing and supply chains for

critical goods, benefiting American businesses, 
workers, consumers, and communities. 
The Build Back Better Act will deliver mean-
ingful outcomes for Black communities and 
help build an America in which all can thrive. 
Black families are feeling the strain of the 
high costs of child care and are two times 
more likely than white parents to have to quit, 
turn down, or make a major change in their 
job due to child care disruptions. 
Only 26.8 percent of Black 3- and 4-year old 
children are enrolled in publicly-funded pre-
school, while the average cost of preschool for 
those without access to publicly-funded pro-
grams is $8,600. 
Under the Build Back Better Act, the vast 
majority of working Black families of four earn-
ing less than $300,000 will pay no more than 
7 percent of their income on child care for chil-
dren under 6. 
This will expand access to the 9 out of 10 
families with young children across the country 
who are working, looking for work, partici-
pating in an education or training program, or 
taking care of a serious health condition, and 
who are making up to 2.5 times their state’s 
median income. 
This means most families will cut their child 
care spending by more than half—for exam-
ple, for two Black parents earning $100,000 
per year, the Build Back Better Act will 
produce more than $5,000 in annual child care 
savings. 
The Build Back Better Act also offers ac-
cess to free preschool for all 3- and 4-year old 
children, providing Black parents access to 
high quality programs in the setting of their 
choice—from public schools to child care pro-
viders to Head Start. 
The Build Back Better Act will also reduce 
the cost of home-based care for the hundreds 
of thousands of older Black adults and Black 
people with disabilities who need it and are 
unable to access it. 
And investment in home care will raise 
wages for home care workers, 28 percent of 
whom are Black. 
Almost 3.9 million Black people were unin-
sured in 2019 and even with the Affordable 
Care Act’s premium subsidies, coverage under 
the ACA was too expensive for many families, 
and over 570,000 Black people fell into the 
Medicaid ‘‘coverage gap’’ and were locked out 
of coverage because their state refused to ex-
pand Medicaid. 
The Build Back Better Act closes the Med-
icaid coverage gap while I also lowering health 
care costs for those buying coverage through 
the ACA by extending the American Rescue 
Plan’s lower premiums, which could save 
360,000 Black people an average of $50 per 
person per month. 
With these changes, more than one in three 
uninsured Black people could gain coverage. 
The Build Back Better Act also adds hearing 
coverage, including for the more than 5.8 mil-
lion Black people on Medicare. 
And, the Build Back Better Act will make an 
historic investment in maternal health, includ-
ing for Black women, who die from complica-
tions related to pregnancy at three times the 
rate of white women. 
Madam Speaker, about 30 percent of Black 
renters pay over half their income In rent. 
The Build Back Better Act enables the con-
struction, rehabilitation, and improvement of 
more than 1 million affordable homes, boost-
ing housing supply and reducing price pres-
sures for renters and homeowners and will 
make investments to improve the safety, en-
ergy efficiency, and quality of existing public 
housing, where nearly half of residents are 
Black. 
It also expands the availability of housing 
choice vouchers to hundreds of thousands 
more families, including the nearly half of cur-
rent voucher holders who are Black. 
The Build Back Better Act will remove lead- 
based paint from housing units, which dis-
proportionately affects Black children and pro-
vides grants for resident-led community devel-
opment projects in neighborhoods that have 
faced systemic disinvestment. 
The Build Back Better Act will ensure that 
the nutritional needs of Black children are met 
by expanding access to free school meals dur-
ing the school year and providing students 
with resources to purchase food over the sum-
mer. 
Madam Speaker, about 22.1 percent of 
Black people fall below the poverty line, strug-
gling to pay expenses like food, rent, health 
care, and transportation for their families. 
The Build Back Better Act extends the Child 
Tax Credit, providing a major tax cut to nearly 
3 million Black people and cutting the Black 
poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which will help 
the 85 percent of Black women who are either 
sole or co-breadwinners for their families. 
The Build Back Better Act permanently ex-
tends the American Rescue Plan’s increase to 
the Earned-Income Tax Credit from $543 to 
$1,502, which will benefit roughly 2.8 million 
Black low-wage workers, including cashiers, 
cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation work-
ers, and child care providers. 
The Build Back Better Act increases the 
maximum Pell Grant by $550 per year for stu-
dents enrolled in public and private, non-profit 
colleges and make an historic investment in 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
(HBCUs), as well as Tribal Colleges and Uni-
versities (TCUs), and minority-serving institu-
tions (MSIs). 
Through high-quality training programs, ca-
reer and technical education pathways, and 
Registered Apprenticeships, President Biden’s 
Build Back Better Act will invest in training 
programs that will prepare millions of Black 
workers for high-quality jobs in growing sec-
tors. 
The toll of gun violence overwhelmingly falls 
on Black Americans and other people of color. 
For example, Black men make up 6 percent 
of the population but represent more than 50 
percent of gun homicide victims. 
That’s why the Build Back Better Act pro-
vides $2.5 billion to support evidence-based 
community violence intervention programs 
shown to reduce violence. 
These programs are effective because they 
leverage trusted messengers who work di-
rectly with individuals most likely to commit 
gun violence, intervene in conflicts, and con-
nect people to social, health and wellness, 
and employment services to reduce the likeli-
hood of violence. 
Madam Speaker, no one is better prepared 
or more experienced to lead the American 
renaissance that will be produced by the in-
vestments made by the Build Back Better Act 
than President Biden, the architect of the 
American Rescue Plan and who as Vice 
President during the Obama Administration 
oversaw the implementation of the Recovery 
Act, which saved millions of jobs and rescued 
our economy from the Great Recession the 
nation inherited from a previous Republican 
administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader. 
Madam Speaker, let me briefly highlight 
some of the key investments made by the 
transformative Build Back Better Act that ben-
efit all Americans. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide two 
years of free pre-K and two years of free com-
munity college to ensure every student has 
the tools, resources, and opportunity to suc-
ceed in life. 
It will also invest in our teachers and institu-
tions that serve minority students and provide 
funding to give school buildings long-overdue 
infrastructure updates. 
People lead happier, healthier, and more 
productive lives when they have had access to 
high-quality education and that is why the 
Build Back Better Act makes necessary invest-
ments to increase quality education by four 
years for all students at no cost to hard-work-
ing families. 
The Build Back Better Act expands access 
to affordable, high quality education beyond 
high school, which is increasingly important for 
economic growth and competitiveness in the 
21st century. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act will 
increase the maximum Pell Grant by $550 for 
more the more than 5 million students enrolled 
in public and private, non-profit colleges and 
expand access to DREAMers. 
It will also make historic investments in His-
torically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities 
(TCUs), 
and 
minority-serving 
institutions 
(MSIs) to build capacity, modernize research 
infrastructure, and provide financial aid to low- 
income students. 
The Build Back Better Act will help more 
people access quality training that leads to 
good, union, and middle-class jobs and will 
enable community colleges to train hundreds 
of thousands of students, create sector-based 
training opportunity with in-demand training for 
at least hundreds of thousands of workers, 
and invest in proven approaches like Reg-
istered Apprenticeships and programs to sup-
port underserved communities. 
The Build Back Better Act will increase the 
Labor Department’s annual spending on work-
force development by 50 percent for each of 
the next 5 years. 
The Build Back Better Act expands access 
to quality, affordable health care by strength-
ening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable 
Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that 
millions of Americans already rely on. 
It includes a major new expansion of Medi-
care benefits, adding a hearing benefit to the 
program for the very first time. 
Only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 
70 who could benefit from hearing aids have 
ever used them. 
The Build Back Better Act strengthens the 
Affordable Care Act and reduces premiums for 
9 million Americans who buy insurance 
through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace 
by an average of $600 per person per year. 
Just for example, a family of four earning 
$80,000 per year would save nearly $3,000

November 18, 2021 
per year (or $246 per month) on health insur-
ance premiums and experts predict that more 
than 3 million people who would otherwise be 
uninsured will gain health. insurance. 
The Build Back Better Act closes the Med-
icaid coverage gap, leading 4 million unin-
sured people to gain coverage. 
The Build Back Better Act will deliver health 
care coverage through Affordable Care Act 
premium tax credits to up to 4 million unin-
sured people in states that have locked them 
out of Medicaid. 
A 40-year old in the coverage gap would 
have to pay $450 per month for benchmark 
coverage—more than half of their income in 
many cases but thanks to the Build Back Bet-
ter Act individuals would pay $0 premiums, fi-
nally making health care affordable and acces-
sible. 
The Build Back Better Act strengthens the 
ACA by extending the enhanced Marketplace 
subsidies that were included in the American 
Rescue Plan. 
It also provides an affordable coverage op-
tion for the more than two million Americans 
living in states that have not expanded Med-
icaid under the ACA and do not earn enough 
to qualify for Marketplace subsidies. 
When the Build Back Better Act is fully im-
plemented, soon gone will be the terrible old 
days when too many Americans are forced to 
choose between medical care and putting food 
on the table or affording other necessities. 
Madam Speaker, approximately 3.9 million 
Black people were uninsured in 2019 before 
President Biden took office and even with the 
Affordable Care Act’s premium subsidies, cov-
erage under the ACA was too expensive for 
many families, and over 570,000 Black people 
fell into the Medicaid ‘‘coverage gap’’ and 
were locked out of coverage because their 
state refused to expand Medicaid. 
Madam Speaker, nearly 1 in 4 Americans 
struggle to afford prescription drugs but Medi-
care is currently prohibited from negotiating 
prescription drug prices to get the best deal 
for American seniors. 
That changes with the historic Build Back 
Better Act, which authorizes Medicare negotia-
tion of drug prices for high-cost prescription 
drugs, including drugs seniors get at the phar-
macy counter (through Medicare Part D), and 
drugs that are administered in a doctor’s office 
(through Medicare Part B). 
Under the Build Back Better Act, drugs be-
come eligible for negotiation once they have 
been on the market for a fixed number of 
years (9 years for small molecule drugs and 
12 years for biologics) and Medicare will nego-
tiate up to 10 drugs per year during 2023, in-
creasing to up to 20 drugs per year. 
The Build Back Better Act imposes a tax 
penalty if drug companies increase their prices 
faster than inflation, which should end the 
shameful days where drug companies could 
raise their prices with impunity. 
Perhaps most important, the Build 
Back Better Act directly lower out-of- 
pocket costs for seniors by capping the 
amount seniors pay for their drugs 
under Medicare Part D at $2,000, a sub-
stantial reduction from the more than 
$6,000 that seniors pay today on aver-
age. 
The Build Back Better Act will also 
lower insulin prices so that no Amer-
ican with diabetes pays more than $35 
per month for needed insulin. 
Madam Speaker, the cost of pre-
school in the United States exceeds 
$8,600 per year on average, and for as 
long as we can remember, child care 
prices in the United States have risen 
faster than family incomes, yet the 
United States still invests 28 times less 
than its competitors on helping fami-
lies afford high-quality care for tod-
dlers. 
The Build Back Better Act supports 
families in need of child care by pro-
viding access to safe, reliable, and 
high-quality care delivered by a well- 
trained child care workforce. 
The Build Back Better Act will pro-
vide universal and free preschool for all 
3- and 4-year-olds. 
This is the largest expansion of uni-
versal and free education since states 
and communities across the country 
established public high school 100 years 
ago. 
This is important because our nation 
is strongest when everyone can join the 
workforce and contribute to the econ-
omy. 
That is why this investment is vital 
to so many millions of—especially 
women—who are often forced to choose 
between working to support their fam-
ily or caring for their family. 
The Build Back Better Act will en-
sure that the vast majority of working 
American families of four earning less 
than $300,000 per year will pay no more 
than 7 percent of their income on child 
care for children under 6. 
Under the Build Back Better Act, 
parents who are working, looking for 
work, participating in an education or 
training program, and who are making 
under 2.5 times their states median in-
come will receive support to cover the 
cost of quality care based on a sliding 
scale, capped at 7 percent of their in-
come. 
The Build Back Better Act will help 
states expand access to high quality, 
affordable child care to about 20 mil-
lion children per year—covering 9 out 
of 10 families across the country with 
young children. 
For two parents with one toddler 
earning $100,000 per year, the Build 
Back Better Act will produce more 
than $5,000 in child care savings per 
year. 
In addition, the Build Back Better 
Act promotes nutrition security to 
support children’s health and help chil-
dren reach their full potential by in-
vesting in nutrition security year- 
round. 
The 
legislation 
will 
expand 
free 
school meals to 8.7 million children 
during the school year and provide a 
$65 per child per month benefit to the 
families of 29 million children to pur-
chase food during the summer. 
The Build Back Better Act will de-
liver affordable, high-quality care for 
older Americans and people with dis-
abilities in their homes, while sup-
porting the workers who provide this 
care. 
Right now, there are hundreds of 
thousands of older Americans and 
Americans with disabilities on waiting 
lists for home care services or strug-
gling to afford the care they need, in-
cluding more than 800,000 who are on 
state Medicaid waiting lists. 
A family paying for home care costs 
out of pocket currently pays around 
$5,800 per year for just four hours of 
home care per week. 
The Build Back Better Act will per-
manently improve Medicaid coverage 
for home care services for seniors and 
people with disabilities, making the 
most transformative investment in ac-
cess to home care in 40 years, when 
these services were first authorized for 
Medicaid. 
The Build Back Better Act will im-
prove the quality of caregiving jobs, 
which will, in turn, help to improve the 
quality of care provided to bene-
ficiaries. 
In the area of housing, the Build 
Back Better Act makes investments to 
ensure that Americans have access to 
safe and affordable housing by pro-
viding resources to increase housing 
vouchers and funding for tribal hous-
ing. 
It also supports investments in pro-
grams that will help address our na-
tion’s housing crisis by increasing the 
supply of affordable homes for those in 
need and investing in historically un-
derserved communities and those that 
have been previously left behind. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better 
Act makes the single largest and most 
comprehensive investment in afford-
able housing in history and will enable 
the construction, rehabilitation, and 
improvement of more than 1 million af-
fordable homes, boosting housing sup-
ply and reducing price pressures for 
renters and homeowners. 
It will address the capital needs of 
the public housing stock in big cities 
and 
rural 
communities 
all 
across 
America and ensure it is not only safe 
and habitable but healthier and more 
energy efficient as well. 
It will make a historic investment in 
rental assistance, expanding vouchers 
to hundreds of thousands of additional 
families. 
And, perhaps even more importantly, 
the Build Back Better Act includes one 
of the largest investments in down pay-
ment assistance in history, enabling 
hundreds of thousands of first-genera-
tion home buyers to purchase their 
first home and build wealth. 
In short, Madam Speaker, this legis-
lation will create more equitable com-
munities, through investing in commu-
nity-led redevelopments projects in 
historically under-resourced neighbor-
hoods and removing lead paint from 
hundreds of thousands of homes, as 
well as by incentivizing state and local 
zoning reforms that enable more fami-
lies to reside in higher opportunity 
neighborhoods. 
The Build Back Better Act will spur 
and empower comprehensive action to 
build an equitable clean energy econ-
omy 
with 
historic 
investments 
to 
transform and modernize the elec-
tricity sector, lower energy costs for

Americans, improve air quality and 
public health, create good-paying jobs, 
and strengthen U.S. competitiveness— 
all while putting our country on the 
pathway to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity by 2035. 
The Build Back Better Act extends 
and expands clean energy tax credits 
and supports clean electricity perform-
ance payments so utilities can accel-
erate progress toward a clean electric 
grid at no added cost to consumers. 
The Build Back Better Act invests in 
clean energy, efficiency, electrifica-
tion, 
and 
climate 
justice 
through 
grants, consumer rebates, and federal 
procurement of clean power and sus-
tainable 
materials, 
and 
by 
incentivizing private sector develop-
ment and investment. 
Another exciting aspect of the Build 
Back Better Act, Madam Speaker, is 
that it will drive economic opportuni-
ties, environmental conservation, and 
climate resilience—especially in under-
served 
and 
disadvantaged 
commu-
nities—including through a new Civil-
ian Climate Corps. 
Madam Speaker, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act includes a $100 billion invest-
ment to reform our broken immigra-
tion system—and does it consistent 
with the Senate’s reconciliation rules— 
as well as to reduce backlogs, expand 
legal representation, and make the 
asylum system and border processing 
more efficient and humane. 
Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible 
for such protection are an integral part 
of Texas’s social fabric. 
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants 
who are eligible for protection, 112,000 
of whom reside in Harris County. 
These individuals live with 845,300 
family members and among those fam-
ily members, 178,700 are U.S.-born cit-
izen children. 
These persons in Texas who are eligi-
ble for protection under the bill arrived 
in the United States at the average age 
of 8 and on average have lived in the 
United States since 1996. 
They own 43,500 homes in Texas and 
pay $340,500,000 in annual mortgage 
payments and contribute $2,234,800,000 
in federal taxes and $1,265,200,000 in 
state and local taxes each year. 
Annually, these households generate 
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in 
Texas and help power the national 
economy. 
The expansion of the Child Tax Cred-
it (CTC) enacted in the American Res-
cue Plan has already benefited nearly 
66 million children, put money in the 
pockets of millions of hard-working 
parents and guardians, and is expected 
to help cut child poverty by more than 
half. 
The Build Back Better Act not only 
extends this meaningful tax cut, but it 
also extends the expanded Earned In-
come Tax Credit (EITC) and the ex-
panded Child and Dependent Care Tax 
Credit, which help families make ends 
meet and put food on the table, reduce 
child poverty, and lessen the burden on 
hard-working Americans so they can 
provide a better future for America’s 
children. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in voting to pass H.R. 5376, 
the transformative, life-changing Build 
Back Better Act. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, as the gentlewoman from 
Texas says, this helps a lot of people, 
especially if you are a millionaire. 
That is why it is the second largest 
provision in this bill. It is tax breaks 
for millionaires. 
In fact, Senator TESTER from Mon-
tana is quoted, he is ‘‘not a big fan be-
cause I think it gives tax breaks to the 
wrong people: rich people.’’ That is a 
Democrat Senator from Montana. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the fine gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, Democrats claim their bill 
will cost $1.7 trillion. That number, by 
itself, should cause alarm. But this 
number is reached through budget gim-
micks. 
If Democrats succeed in making the 
provisions of this bill permanent, as 
they have publicly said they intend to 
do, then the cost will be much, much 
higher. 
The Penn-Wharton Budget Model es-
timates total spending for this bill 
would be $4.6 trillion over 10 years if 
the provisions are made permanent. 
The 
Committee 
for 
a 
Responsible 
Budget estimates the cost at $4.9 tril-
lion. 
If Democrats are going to spend this 
kind of money, they should at least be 
honest about the true cost to the 
American people. I urge my colleagues 
to reject this reckless spending. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MORELLE), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, the 
Build Back Better Act is an historic 
opportunity to reduce our Nation’s 
healthcare costs, increase access to 
childcare, support working families, 
and strengthen our economy. 
One item I would like to highlight is 
a provision to boost regional innova-
tion. Since the 116th Congress, I have 
proudly sponsored the Innovation Cen-
ters Acceleration Act, legislation that 
would invest significant Federal dol-
lars in our Nation’s innovation efforts. 
Federal R&D as a percentage of GDP 
has fallen considerably since the mid- 
1960s, harming our productivity and 
global competitiveness, while opening 
the door for China to lead the world in 
innovation. 
I am incredibly proud that this bill 
includes $3.36 billion to create the re-
gional innovation clusters envisioned 
in my proposal. Not only will this in-
vestment enhance our ability to be 
competitive, but it will create jobs at a 
time when they are needed the most. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in proudly supporting and advancing 
this historic legislation, and I look for-
ward to its passage. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
the gentleman from New York, but I 
would just like to point out, in his 
home State, a family of four with two 
children under six, in just over a year, 
will face more than a $3,200 tax in-
crease. But yet, a millionaire in his 
State, for the next 10 years, will re-
ceive a tax break of over $25,000 a year. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the fine gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. I thank him for his leader-
ship. It is extremely important. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in ada-
mant opposition to what is a disastrous 
package. Disastrous. This very well 
may be one of the most consequential 
votes any of us, any of us have ever 
taken on this House floor. 
Yet, it has never, never gone through 
the proper process. It never received 
the proper consideration this body de-
mands of any piece of legislation, the 
least of which would be one of the most 
consequential pieces of legislation that 
we have ever considered. 
I am sure most Members, on both 
sides of the aisle, do not fully know 
what is actually in this bill. Has any-
body, has any Member actually read 
this bill? Anybody? 
My colleagues across the aisle are at-
tempting to pass the most expensive 
bill, the most expensive bill, not by a 
little bit, by a lot. It is, yes, it is the 
most expensive bill by a lot that has 
ever been passed in American history. 
It has the largest tax increase ever 
considered and the biggest expansion of 
government in a generation; all while 
they have the slimmest of majorities. 
This is not a mandate. 
Look, what is going on? Look, what 
is happening here? The American peo-
ple are rejecting this. You saw what 
happened in Virginia. You see what is 
happening now. 
We have got all these things going 
on. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Americans 
are told that they shouldn’t have a say 
in their children’s education. They 
watched as Americans were abandoned 
behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. 
They see the crisis at our border. They 
go to the gas station; they see an in-
crease in gasoline prices. They see in-
creases at the grocery store. This legis-
lation makes it worse. This legislation 
pours fuel on the fire. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely urge all 
of my colleagues to oppose this mis-
guided and profoundly consequential 
bill. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG), a distin-
guished member of the Agriculture 
Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6584 
November 18, 2021 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, the 
Build Back Better Act follows through 
on our commitment to expand access 
to and lower the cost of healthcare for 
Americans across this country and 
back home in Minnesota. 
Included in this bill are the most far- 
reaching and impactful prescription 
drug reforms to pass this Congress in 
my lifetime. Not only will Medicare 
have the power to negotiate the prices 
of critical drugs for America’s seniors, 
we are installing annual caps for Medi-
care recipients, capping the cost of in-
sulin at $35 a month. 
We have designed a package that 
would lower out-of-pocket healthcare 
costs for hardworking Americans by 
strengthening the ACA, extending the 
premium tax credits for millions of 
families nationwide. 
This is our chance to make good on 
our promise to deliver a real, imme-
diate impact that will lower the cost of 
healthcare to make it more affordable, 
more accessible for every person across 
this country. 
I, for one, could not be more proud, 
and I encourage my colleagues to get 
this done. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Democrats’ spending bill is not about 
building back better, it is about build-
ing up a bureaucracy that will expand 
the reach of the Federal Government, 
especially over education. 
This bill will impose Federal control 
over pre-K, limit parental choice, in-
crease the cost of childcare, punish job 
creators, reward far-left special inter-
ests, and deepen our debt crisis. 
This bill recklessly sets aside $400 
billion 
for 
universal 
pre-K 
and 
childcare but, in reality, there is no 
telling how much this provision will 
cost the American people. Subsidizing 
the childcare of wealthy families isn’t 
building back better, it is building 
back bankrupt. 
This legislation is wrong for our 
country and wrong for our children. 
Education is best when run locally and 
when parents are involved. 
The bill also includes dangerous pro-
visions from the PRO Union Bosses 
Act, which kneecap business owners 
while putting a target on job creators’ 
backs with outrageously inflated Labor 
Department fines. 
Democrats keep saying this legisla-
tion is transformational. Well, let me 
tell them something: The American 
people do not want this country to be 
transformed in the way they want to 
transform it. 
It is time to make protecting the fu-
ture of this Nation, our children, a pri-
ority, not empowering teachers unions, 
burdening job creators, or centralizing 
control in the hands of unelected, un-
accountable Washington bureaucrats. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. CHU), a 
distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the trans-
formational Build Back Better Act and 
the investments it will make in our 
economy to help working families in 
our country. 
I am proud that, after months of 
compromise and negotiation, we have a 
bill today that is certain to make a dif-
ference in the lives of so many, while 
growing our economy and confronting 
the climate crisis. 
By extending the child tax cut, mak-
ing childcare affordable, and lowering 
drug prices, we are giving families 
more money in their pockets. We are 
also ensuring 4 weeks of paid leave for 
all workers so that nobody has to lose 
their job in order to take care of them-
selves or loved ones; something so 
many families have struggled with this 
pandemic. 
And all these investments are com-
pletely paid for by ensuring that bil-
lionaires and corporations pay their 
fair share. Those who get rich off the 
backs of working families need to pay 
their fair share and support them. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Colorado 
(Mrs. BOEBERT). She is someone who is 
a warrior, a fighter for conservatism 
and, apparently, even the Budget chair-
man is threatened by her. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the ranking member 
on the Budget Committee, who has 
done an excellent job exposing these 
terrible schemes to the American peo-
ple this Congress. 
Madam Speaker, America does not 
need and cannot afford this junk. 
America doesn’t need 80,000 new IRS 
agents snooping in our private trans-
actions. 
These 
are 
politically 
weaponized bureaucrat bullies that we 
are looking to hire more of. 
America cannot afford $1.5 trillion in 
new taxes, while Federal bureaucrats 
haul off and spend $4.1 billion on elec-
tric bicycles. 
b 1100 
Do they realize that this will use 
more fossil fuels, more petroleum prod-
ucts, to create electric bicycles than 
conventional bicycles? I don’t think so. 
I think they have lost their ever-loving 
minds. 
It includes $7.8 billion for environ-
mental justice going toward woke uni-
versities; 
$100 
billion 
for 
amnesty 
workarounds, as our southern border is 
completely invaded by nearly 2 million 
illegal aliens, many of them criminal 
aliens. There is $55 billion for Green 
New Deal policies and tax breaks so 
congressional Members from the Bronx 
can afford a new Tesla. 
Biden’s broke back budget has an-
other $330 billion to incentivize work-
ers to stay home. News flash to the 
party of wealthy cities and wealthy 
elites: We have a worker shortage right 
now in America. We have an inflation 
crisis. This will only make things 
worse, much worse, not better. 
But let me guess. When things do get 
worse, as they inevitably will, we will 
need to reelect you-all’s sorry selves so 
you can fix it, right? No thanks. I will 
pass. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this monstrosity of a spending bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, this 
bill offers childcare; educational oppor-
tunities from pre-K to post-grad; and 
the first belated, substantial response 
to 
the 
climate 
crisis. 
My 
top 
healthcare priority is providing assist-
ance to 2 million Texans out of 6 mil-
lion 
Americans 
who 
were 
denied 
healthcare by sorry Republican Gov-
ernors. Families left out and left be-
hind can finally see a family physician. 
From my bill to strengthen Medicare, 
we at least cover hearing care, which is 
important to reducing depression and 
dementia. 
Had 
we 
overcome 
Big 
Pharma’s 
stranglehold over this Congress, we 
could have delivered much more. Sav-
ings from meaningful drug price nego-
tiations could have financed vision and 
dental. Without further Biden adminis-
tration action though, most Americans 
will still be victims of prescription 
price gouging. 
While so much remains to be done, 
this historic legislation offers real 
hope and opportunity, reducing inequi-
ties and lifting up those too often for-
gotten. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
think I can find something I agree with 
my Democrat colleagues on. This bill is 
a transformational bill. It is a bill 
made up by people who think America 
is fundamentally broken and that we 
have to make big changes. That is 
what we are going to get. 
I will focus quickly on five areas. 
One, illegal immigration. Under this 
bill, we are adding no new Border Pa-
trol agents, but we are making it more 
difficult to deport people who have 
committed serious crimes here. We are 
using an additional carrot to get people 
here in that we are giving away free 
college to match the free healthcare we 
are already giving. 
One way that this bill would trans-
form America is you get a lot more il-
legal immigrants. Since yesterday, for 
the first time, we topped 100,000 illegal 
drug deaths in this country. I think 
this bill ensures that number is going 
to continue to go up. That is an 
undersold story. 
Secondly, I have always felt the big-
gest problem in America right now is 
an out-of-control welfare system that

destroys families. That system be-
comes more generous in this bill, be it 
through much more low-income hous-
ing or an earned income tax credit pro-
vision that increases the marriage pen-
alty or Pell grants. 
This is a transformative bill, and I 
strongly wish my colleagues would 
vote against it. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. WATERS), the dis-
tinguished chair of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Build Back Better 
Act, which will make historic invest-
ments across the country. 
We are in the middle of a housing cri-
sis, and I have worked hard for funding 
to assist this crisis that we have in 
housing. As chairwoman of the Finan-
cial Services Committee, I have consid-
ered this my responsibility. 
It is not lost on me that more than 
580,000 people experience homelessness 
on any given night, and millions of 
families are at this very moment sacri-
ficing their next meal to pay the rent. 
Many more have been kept out of their 
dream of homeownership. 
With more than $151 billion for hous-
ing in this bill, Democrats are helping 
families achieve housing stability and 
housing affordability. 
Housing is infrastructure. The Build 
Back Better Act provides the largest 
investment in America’s housing infra-
structure in history. This investment 
is critical to creating a fair and equi-
table 
Nation 
where 
everyone 
can 
thrive. 
As this bill goes to the Senate, in it 
we have $10 billion for first-generation 
home buyers; we have $25 billion in 
Section 8 rental assistance; we have $25 
billion in the HOME program, CDBG, 
and the housing trust fund to build 
more affordable units. 
So I would ask for support of this 
very significant legislation. It is indeed 
a game-changer. I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Build Back Better 
Act. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, as the gentlewoman from 
California said, there is $150 billion in 
this program for housing assistance. 
What is unfortunate, which she didn’t 
share, is that it also allows felons of 
domestic violence to get those grants, 
which is unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, infla-
tion rates are at a 30-year high, and gas 
prices are up 61 percent since last year. 
Why? Well, according to Joe Biden, it 
is because of the American Rescue Plan 
that this body passed in the spring. No 
less than the President himself said: 
You got checks, but what happens if there 
is nothing to buy and you got more money to 
compete for goods? It creates a real problem. 
Yes, Mr. President, it does create a 
real problem, and now you are trying 
to double down with this broke back 
better bill. 
What does it do? It further harms the 
economy with $4.5 trillion in new 
spending, $1.5 trillion in new taxes, and 
$3 trillion in new debt. It benefits the 
wealthy with a SALT tax cut of $25,000 
for millionaires, electric vehicle sub-
sidies for couples making $500,000 a 
year, 
and 
government-funded 
paid 
leave for millionaires. It builds the bu-
reaucracy with 150 new government 
programs, props up the Green New 
Deal, and weaponizes the IRS. 
Madam Speaker, this is the wrong 
plan for the American people, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL), a dis-
tinguished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, this 
is an incredible day. The House will 
pass the Build Back Better Act, Presi-
dent Biden’s popular and necessary 
agenda, and say to Americans every-
where: We have got your back. 
Today, we say to families everywhere 
that we will cut your childcare costs in 
half and provide universal pre-K to 3- 
and 4-year-olds. 
Today, we are finally going to take 
on Big Pharma, cut the cost of pre-
scription drugs, and make sure that 
people can afford the cost of insulin. 
This bill makes the biggest Federal 
investment in housing in our history 
and allows America to truly lead on 
taking on climate change, with half a 
trillion dollars of investment and 40 
percent of those funds going to commu-
nities that are most disproportionately 
burdened by the effects of climate 
change. 
For the first time in 35 years, we say 
to immigrants: You are truly essential, 
not expendable. We will protect Dream-
ers, TPS holders, essential workers, 
and farmworkers. 
I thank President Biden for his lead-
ership. We will provide transformative 
change for people across America and 
invest in our competitiveness; our 
thriving, not surviving; and our hu-
manity. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I would like to read a quote from the 
Democrat Congressman from Maine, 
talking about the huge tax break for 
the millionaires. He says: ‘‘The fact 
that more people and organizations on 
the Democratic side aren’t up in arms 
about this is wild.’’ 
I am surprised with a lot of my col-
leagues on the other side who want to 
help working-class Americans, who in-
stead are going to be supporting a bill 
that helps wealthy Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, the voters of Virginia sent a mes-
sage 2 weeks ago because they were 
scared to death of the continuation of 
these radical Biden policies, the radical 
policies of Governor Northam in Vir-
ginia, scared to death of the continu-
ation of that that was represented by 
the 
potential 
election 
of 
Terry 
McAuliffe. Did the Democrat majority 
hear that message? No. 
When this phony infrastructure bill 
is implemented, that was passed 2 
weeks ago, we will have $30 trillion in 
debt, which equates to $90,000 per 
American. 
For my friends across the aisle, who 
are economically illiterate and not 
good at math, the $30 trillion worth of 
debt is a 3 with 13 zeros. Please don’t 
tell them what comes after a trillion. 
But it is not just the spending of this 
$2 trillion to $4 trillion. They don’t 
even know what it will cost because we 
don’t have a score. 
It is 150 new programs. It is growing 
the welfare state. It is trying to get 
more people dependent on the Demo-
crats for their sustenance, separating 
work from income, massive amnesty 
for tens of millions of illegal aliens in 
our country, and hundreds of billions of 
dollars for the Green New Deal. 
This is the Bernie-AOC budget forc-
ing us into electric vehicles. It will 
massively increase utility, gas, and 
fuel prices. It will massively increase 
inflation, as we continue to have too 
many dollars facing too few supplies, 
too few goods, too few services, as a re-
sult of their policies. 
But they are tone-deaf economically. 
They want to bankrupt the future of 
our country with this massive, contin-
ued spending. It is bad for America, 
and everyone should vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the 
distinguished chair of the Small Busi-
ness Committee. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this legisla-
tion because working families deserve 
a government that will make their 
lives better. 
First off, to build back better, we 
must invest in our Nation’s entre-
preneurs, and that is exactly what this 
bill does. It will make a $5 billion in-
vestment in SBA programs that go be-
yond 
recovery 
and 
provide 
trans-
formative, 
long-term 
solutions 
and 
economic stimulus. It will create mil-
lions of new jobs on top of the millions 
already added under the Biden adminis-
tration. 
This legislation also includes the 
largest single, one-time investment 
ever made to HUD’s public housing 
capital fund. It will go a long way to 
clearing the backlog of repairs around 
the country. 
This bill also creates universal pre-K, 
extends the child tax credit, and finally 
mandates paid parental leave. 
On climate, we are including a focus 
on environmental justice and frontline 
communities like those I represent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from New York.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6586 
November 18, 2021 
Mr. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
here is what I can guarantee. Because 
of this bill, millions of working fami-
lies will see their lives improved by a 
Federal Government that we are show-
ing today has their back. 
While this is not the end of the fight, 
it is what progress looks like. That is 
why I am proud to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 2 
weeks ago, I led over 200 Members of 
this House in sending a letter to the 
Speaker, urging that we do not vote on 
this bill until the CBO had issued a 
cost score for this bill. Yet, here we 
are, debating what is likely the largest 
spending package in the history of this 
country, paired with the largest tax in-
crease in the history of this country. I 
say ‘‘likely’’ because we really don’t 
know what the bill will cost. Appar-
ently, we are supposed to pass the bill 
before we are allowed to know what it 
costs. 
Madam Speaker, that is crazy. Here 
is why that matters. Our national debt 
right now stands at about $29 trillion. 
Although we don’t have a CBO score on 
this bill, what we do have is an anal-
ysis by the Wharton School at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania which says 
that this bill would add $300 billion to 
that debt, at least, and that is if all the 
programs in this bill sunset on time, 
which we know is not going to happen. 
Further, the analysis says if they don’t 
sunset, this bill could add $2.5 trillion 
to our national debt. 
Madam Speaker, here is the real 
tragedy: We run about a $2 trillion def-
icit this year, and even in a good year 
it will be over a trillion dollars. The 
tax increases alone in this bill would 
almost get us to balancing the Federal 
budget, which would allow us to avoid 
leaving a legacy of debt to our children 
and our grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is bad for 
our country, and it is bad for our econ-
omy. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
b 1115 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ), a distinguished member of 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, our communities should not 
have to choose between paying their 
medical bills or paying for groceries. 
Parents want to go to work knowing 
that their kids are being taken care of, 
that their kids are learning, because 
when kids are learning, parents are 
earning. 
Families want to know that their 
kids and grandkids will inherit this 
beautiful place we call home, this plan-
et, still beautiful. They want the Build 
Back Better Act because it delivers 
those opportunities. 
So many Americans, especially our 
Latino and Native-American commu-
nities, suffer from diabetes. With Build 
Back Better, no one will have to pay 
more than $35 a month for insulin. This 
is lifesaving. Big Pharma shouldn’t 
make excessive profits off the pain of 
Americans. 
We are delivering for Americans, and 
it is fully paid for by taxing the rich 
and big corporations. I urge my col-
leagues to deliver Build Back Better 
‘‘for the people,’’ para la gente, for our 
hardworking immigrants, for all of our 
communities. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a doc-
ument from the Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget that shows 
the true cost of the bill is over $4 tril-
lion. 
[From the Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget, Nov. 5, 2021] 
HOUSE BUILD BACK BETTER BILLS ARE BUILT 
ON SHAKY FOUNDATION 
The House is slated to vote today on two 
parts of the President’s Build Back Better 
agenda—the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
(https://www.crfb.org/blogs/infrastructure- 
plan-will-add-400-billion-deficit-cbo-finds) 
and a reconciliation bill addressing climate 
change, child care, health care. and other 
priorities. 
The following is a statement from Maya 
MacGuineas, president of the Committee for 
a Responsible Federal Budget: 
A fiscally responsible Build Back Better 
agenda should be fully paid for, gimmick- 
free, well-targeted based on the country’s 
needs, and enacted in the context of a broad-
er budget. While policymakers should be 
commended for their efforts to scale back 
costs and include real offsets, these bills still 
fall far short of those goals. 
While President Biden and Members of 
Congress pledged their agenda would not add 
to the debt, it is likely that both bills would 
increase the deficit based on official esti-
mates. The bipartisan infrastructure bill— 
negotiated by Democrats and Republicans— 
will 
add 
roughly 
$400 
billion 
(https:// 
www.crfb.org/blogs/infrastructure-plan-will- 
add-400-billion-deficit-cbo-finds) to the debt 
over the next decade. While we still don’t 
know the true fiscal impact of the reconcili-
ation legislation, it is likely that it will add 
modestly to the deficit as well. No one 
should vote for this bill prior to seeing a 
CBO score. 
The bills are also riddled with gimmicks. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill claims it is 
fully paid for by taking credit for saving 
(https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-bipartisan- 
infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act) that 
had nothing to do with the bill itself. The 
reconciliation bill keeps its official cost 
down 
through 
arbitrary 
expirations—the 
Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax 
Credit expansions after one year, Affordable 
Care Act expansions after 3 and 4 years, and 
child care and pre-K after six years. If these 
and other sunset policies are extended with-
out offsets, it would cost an additional $2 to 
$2.5 trillion through the end of the decade. 
And then there’s the last-minute addition 
of a SALT cap increase, which will deliver a 
huge tax cut to very high earners (https:// 
www.crfb.org/blogs/72500-salt-cap-costly-and- 
regressive) at a cost of nearly $300 billion 
over the first five years. The proposed SALT 
cap increase would cost more than the bill’s 
Child Tax Credit, health coverage expan-
sions, housing initiatives, or education fund-
ing, and roughly 98 percent of the benefit 
would go to those making six figures. This is 
egregious in light of the objectives of the 
bill. This tax cut would be offset on paper 
with a sleight of hand where policymakers 
extend the SALT cap beyond 2026 but leave 
other accompanying parts of the TCJA for 
future lawmakers to extend. 
All of this is being considered in the con-
text of near-record levels of debt, trust funds 
years 
away 
from 
insolvency, 
and 
an 
unsustainable fiscal situation that few in ei-
ther party are even trying to address. Given 
the current budget outlook, we should ideal-
ly be pursuing long-term deficit reduction, 
rather than limiting deficit increases. And 
we should be doing it in the context of an ac-
tual detailed budget for the nation. 
Washington’s credibility is on the line, and 
we need to get this right. Rather than rush 
through irresponsible legislation before it 
has even been scored, the House should fix 
the flaws in the current bills to ensure the 
Build Back Better agenda—both reconcili-
ation and infrastructure—is honestly ac-
counted for and truly paid for. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), a dis-
tinguished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I stand today and rise in the strongest 
support for the Build Back Better Act, 
the most transformational investment 
in everyday Americans in generations. 
I rise in support of the largest effort 
to combat climate change in American 
history. 
I rise in support of the largest expan-
sion of affordable health coverage for 
Americans as well as the highest in-
vestment in housing. 
I rise in support of women, who will 
be able to go back to work because 
they will have childcare, and their chil-
dren will be able to have universal pre-
school. 
I rise in support of the American peo-
ple and seniors, who have been waiting 
for too long for more home care, and 
the workers will be able to see an in-
crease in wages for caregiving. 
I am so proud to stand today for the 
American people, the middle class, who 
have been waiting so long for finally 
getting to see the Build Back Better 
Act. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman 
from Illinois, and I remind her that 
government spending is already help-
ing fuel an inflation fire that is on pace 
to raise prices at the fastest rate in 40 
years. In her home State of Illinois, 
food prices currently are up 8 percent, 
clothing is up 9 percent, and gasoline 
prices are up 62 percent. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Build 
Back Better Act to deliver on the 
promises we have made to the Amer-
ican people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6587 
November 18, 2021 
This bill is about families and fair-
ness. Even before the pandemic, par-
ents in Virginia and across the country 
have been weighed down by the cost of 
raising their kids, caring for their el-
derly parents, and providing for their 
families. The Build Back Better Act 
will lighten that burden. 
The investments we are making with 
this bill, universal pre-K, affordable 
childcare, 
and 
lower 
prices 
for 
healthcare and prescription drugs, will 
bring everyday costs for families down 
and set all of our children up for a 
bright future. 
It will take long-overdue action to 
tackle the climate crisis by making 
the historic investments that we need 
to create a clean energy future for our 
kids, while creating millions of good- 
paying American manufacturing jobs 
in the process. 
We have the opportunity to enact 
once-in-a-generation change that will 
improve the lives of our families and 
keep our economy on a path to a 
strong and full recovery. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support a swift passage of 
the Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I will point out that 
since Joe Biden became President on 
January 20, the policies that he en-
acted by executive order in his first 
week in office have created an incred-
ibly awful border crisis. 
Unfortunately, 
1.4 
million 
people 
have illegally crossed the southern bor-
der since Joe Biden has taken office. 
And what does this legislation do? 
This legislation will only make it 
worse by providing over $100 billion in 
this legislation for backdoor amnesty. 
This bill also provides roughly $45,000 
of benefits to illegals over U.S. citi-
zens. That is unacceptable. The Amer-
ican people are opposed to that, and 
they are not liking it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), a distinguished member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly rise to sup-
port the largest investment in Amer-
ica’s working families, a human safety 
net, and the protection of the planet 
since FDR’s New Deal. 
To families facing high healthcare or 
childcare costs or struggling to find af-
fordable pre-K programs, the Build 
Back Better Act has your back. 
We deliver real help and support, in-
cluding paid family leave and a child 
tax credit extension that cuts child 
poverty in half and puts money in par-
ents’ pockets each month. 
It expands healthcare coverage for 
millions and helps seniors pay for home 
care, hearing aids, and prescriptions by 
finally allowing Medicare to negotiate 
lower drug prices. 
Build Back Better also seriously 
tackles climate change by moving us 
toward our 2030 emissions reduction 
goals and does it by producing high- 
paying, green, union jobs. 
For veterans, it invests $5 billion to 
upgrade aging VA hospitals and en-
sures we better serve those who so 
bravely served. 
Build Back Better is fully paid for 
and returns fairness to the Tax Code by 
making sure corporations and Amer-
ica’s wealthiest pay their fair share. 
Paired with the bipartisan infra-
structure bill, both bills will make life 
a lot better for all Americans, espe-
cially families in Florida. Let’s build 
back better now. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I never thought in the United States 
Congress—the home of the free, of the 
brave, of those taxpayers who work 
hard every day and entrust us to spend 
their money wisely—that we would see 
a spending bill of this magnitude that 
would saddle our future children with 
debt. 
The intrusion in this bill, the govern-
ment control, the debt, the taxes, the 
mandates and the disincentivizing of 
work and production will continue to 
lead to more labor shortages, more sup-
ply chain issues, and make things 
worse. 
And what is even worse than all of 
that is the name of the bill, that the 
people in this Congress are trying to 
fool the American people by calling it 
a Build Back Better bill. It is a dis-
aster. 
When we talk about putting Ameri-
cans first, what does this bill do at a 
time when we have the worst crisis at 
the border? There is $100 billion going 
to amnesty and benefits for those who 
are entering the country illegally, and 
this at a time when we are seeing a rise 
in fentanyl deaths due to what’s cross-
ing over our border, child trafficking, 
sex trafficking. 
And then look at Big Brother, the 
government intrusion part of this bill: 
doubling the number of IRS agents to 
go after Americans to spy on their 
bank accounts. 
This bill has crushing energy impli-
cations at a time when we are seeing 
record increases on gas prices, on elec-
tricity, on heat, and we are about to 
face the most expensive holiday season 
as a result. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from New 
York. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
in addition to that, there are the taxes 
and the mandates. 
Where are my moderate friends on 
the other side of the aisle who com-
mitted to vote against this bill unless 
there was a CBO score? 
They have been untruthful, and the 
American people will not forget what is 
occurring here today. 
Do not destroy the very country that 
my parents came to in order to pursue 
the American Dream. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN), a distinguished 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, because I have a heart, I will vote 
for universal pre-K. I have been to the 
classrooms, and I have seen those ba-
bies’ bright eyes, eager to learn. I have 
also understood while I was there that 
there were other children who wouldn’t 
have that benefit. They were getting a 
late start while others were getting a 
head start. This universal pre-K will 
give the same start to all of these chil-
dren. 
I am voting for the future because I 
have a heart. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the Build 
Back Better bill. I thank Chairman 
YARMUTH and the Speaker, as well as 
the committee chairs who worked to 
craft this transformative legislation. It 
makes bold investments in our people, 
reduces inflation, and will deliver real 
improvements in their lives. 
It will address the acute housing cri-
sis in my community and throughout 
the country. It also includes wildfire 
prevention, drought relief, conserva-
tion efforts, and climate change re-
search to curb the climate crisis. 
It includes the child tax credit, paid 
family leave, child nutrition programs, 
expanding access to childcare for work-
ing and low-income families, and home 
care for elders. All of these invest-
ments and more will help reduce pov-
erty and allow women to get back into 
the paid workforce. 
It will also help build rewarding ca-
reers, create jobs through workforce 
development funding for underserved 
populations, including returning citi-
zens. 
Passing this bill is a moral impera-
tive, especially for children, women, 
seniors, and people of color that have 
been disproportionately impacted by 
this pandemic and continue to be side-
lined due to systemic racial and eco-
nomic inequality. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY), a distinguished 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this transformative 
and once-in-a-generation opportunity 
to deliver for the American public in a 
way that we have never seen before.

November 18, 2021 
And to my colleagues, it is paid for. 
The Build Back Better Act will cre-
ate more than two million jobs each 
year over the course of the next dec-
ade. It will also ensure universal pre-K 
and extend the child tax credit to help 
lift thousands of children out of pov-
erty. 
Democrats and Republicans, Amer-
ica, listen to me, we need to make sure 
that everyone supports this. And for 
people who do not support Build Back 
Better, there should be consequences 
because this is the largest investment 
to combat the climate crisis in history. 
It includes historical investments in 
HBCUs, it includes $150 billion in our 
Nation’s housing infrastructure. 
This bill is a win for all. Do not be 
fooled. We have worked hard, and this 
bill is for Democrats and it is for Re-
publicans. People who do not vote for 
this do not believe in America. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I hear all the time in this Chamber 
people say it is for the children or it is 
for the kids. What hogwash from the 
other side to say that this bill helps 
the children with the child tax credit. 
Your child tax credit is for 1 year, 
but your tax break for millionaires is 
for 10? 
You are spending $250 billion in tax 
breaks for millionaires and $130 billion 
for 1 year for families. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AGUILAR). The gentleman is reminded 
to direct his remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Mis-
souri has 30 seconds remaining. 
b 1130 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. RYAN), a distinguished member of 
the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
wonderful place. I have to tell you, our 
child tax credit is 1 year more than 
your child tax credit. We did one this 
year; we are going to do one next year; 
and we are going to keep going. 
I love this place. Guys get wrapped 
around like a pretzel in this place. 
Let me be clear, I am against any tax 
cut for the wealthy. This is an invest-
ment in working-class people whether 
they are White or Black or Brown. 
But when I listen to the other side, I 
hear somebody who if this was a foot-
ball game I would go back and say, I 
want a review, I want a review of the 
play, and I want to pull up the C–SPAN 
video of all the Republicans at the 
Rose Garden touting a big tax cut for 
the top 1 percent that blew a trillion- 
dollar hole in the economy. 
This place is ridiculous. 
Let’s invest in the people. Let’s not 
cut taxes for rich people. 
And we have a new name for the 
GOP: the grand old phonies. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers on both sides are reminded to di-
rect their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Less than one-third of this budget 
bill is scored. Less than one-third. But 
what we do know is that it will not be 
fully paid for, and over the next 5 years 
it will add roughly $800 billion to debt. 
We do know that. 
This bill only bankrupts the econ-
omy. It benefits your wealthy political 
friends, allies, and donors, and it only 
builds the Washington machine. 
If working-class Americans are con-
sidered millionaires, then this bill is 
helping them because it is all about the 
millionaires. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we have gone back and 
forth on this bill for months now, and 
my Republican friends have said, oh, 
they haven’t had a chance to read the 
bill. The Budget Committee reported 
out the consolidated bill on September 
25. There have been 180 hours of debate 
on this bill before today; so if they 
can’t read the bill in 2 months, they 
have another problem. 
But at the end of the day, it is clear 
this has not been a fair debate. On one 
side you have House Republicans. On 
the other you have myself and my 
Democratic colleagues, 17 Nobel-win-
ning economists, former Treasury Sec-
retaries, Jack Lew and Larry Sum-
mers, scores of other economists and 
experts, and most importantly, the 
overwhelming majority of the Amer-
ican people. 
This hasn’t been an honest debate ei-
ther. Democrats have a plan to serve 
the American people. Republicans have 
an agenda to stop Democrats, period. 
And my friend from Ohio just had an-
other description of GOP. I don’t think 
it should be GOP at all; I think it 
should be NOP, the not our problem 
party. If it is healthcare, it is not our 
problem. Dealing with climate change, 
it is not our problem. Dealing with 
education, not our problem. Dealing 
with seniors, not our problem. Dealing 
with childcare, not our problem. Af-
fording college, not our problem. Deal-
ing with medical costs, not our prob-
lem. 
Democrats see important challenges 
facing the American people, and we are 
finally dealing with them. It is time to 
close the curtain on the Republican 
charade and do our jobs. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
and send to the Senate the most trans-
formative legislation for America and 
American families in a century. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) 
and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BRADY) each will control 30 minutes. 
The gentleman from Massachusetts 
is recognized. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 4 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong 
support of the Build Back Better Act 
and its implications. 
I am proud of the substantive con-
tributions that the Ways and Means 
Committee, once again, has made to 
this monumental initiative. With these 
provisions 
we 
will 
make 
trans-
formational investments in families, 
workers, and the fight against climate 
change. 
Getting to this point certainly has 
not been fast, nor has it been easy. 
Some might say it has been quite chal-
lenging. But that is what democracy 
looks like, and it frequently is noisy. 
We have examined these issues; we 
have had thoughtful, spirited debate in 
the committee; and we have refined our 
proposals. 
Since 2019, the Ways and Means Com-
mittee has held over 40 hearings re-
lated to topics addressed by these pro-
visions, and we have heard out the 
stakeholders from virtually every per-
spective. Over the course of 40 hours of 
committee markup, we thoroughly de-
bated this package and considered 60 
amendments 
from 
the 
Republican 
members. And in the 3 months since we 
passed our historic package out of the 
committee, we have refined our poli-
cies further and made hard com-
promises in the interest of accom-
plishing fine things for the American 
people. 
That is how legislation is developed, 
and it is not based on whim. 
There is not enough time to detail 
every policy in this legislation, but let 
me highlight just a few that are going 
to be particularly well received by the 
American people, and I am proud of 
these proposals. 
First and foremost, we fought hard to 
include a universal paid family and 
medical leave provision to finally put 
an end to workers’ impossible choice 
between providing for their family and 
caring for them. 
We also invest in making healthcare 
more affordable by extending the en-
hanced Affordable Care Act premium 
subsidies that we approved in the 
American Rescue Plan earlier this 
year. 
We close the Medicaid coverage gap, 
which will allow four million uninsured 
Americans to gain access to coverage. 
Let me say something, as well, Mr. 
Speaker. Everybody in Massachusetts 
has health insurance. Every child is 
covered, and 98 percent of adults are 
covered in the State, and it polls really 
well. 
I am proud of these investments we 
make here in supporting this develop-
ment and deployment of green energy, 
and I want to acknowledge two Mem-
bers in particular, Mr. THOMPSON and 
Mr. BLUMENAUER, for the role that they 
played. Our green tax policies put us on 
the path to a sustainable future, they 
help cut carbon emissions, and create 
good, well-paying jobs across the coun-
try.

November 18, 2021 
This an ambitious package, but it 
makes major investments—emphasis 
on the word ‘‘investments’’—in our 
economy, workers, and families, but it 
also responsibly meets the time in 
which we live. The Ways and Means 
Committee, of which I am enormously 
proud, we fully commit the funds that 
are necessary to pay for these prior-
ities by asking the most powerful 
amongst us to pay just a modest 
amount more. The various wealthy in-
dividuals will be asked to contribute, 
again, just a bit more to our Nation 
that has provided them with the oppor-
tunities to have such substantial suc-
cess. 
I urge our colleagues to support this 
legislation. We will allow for a strong-
er and better Nation to build back bet-
ter and stronger, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we meet today to con-
sider the largest spending bill in Amer-
ican history; a bill that no one has 
read, no one knows its cost, it was 
written in secret, and rushed to the 
floor to hide it from the American peo-
ple. 
We meet in the shadow of an awful 
economic report that shows America’s 
economy effectively stopped growing 
last quarter. President Biden is over 
700,000 jobs short of his promises from 
the last stimulus, has ignored the dam-
aging labor shortage and the fastest 
rising inflation in 40 years. 
This is all proof that President Biden 
is bungling the recovery, and leaves 
many Americans questioning his com-
petence. 
Given all that, you would think the 
President and Congressional Demo-
crats would avoid sabotaging Amer-
ica’s economy further. But that is ex-
actly what this $4 trillion socialist tax 
and spending binge does. 
Build Back Better’s crippling tax 
hikes will kill American jobs, drive 
many of them overseas, hammer small 
businesses as they struggle to recover, 
worsen the labor shortage, and drive 
inflation even higher. 
And, yes, President Biden is abso-
lutely breaking his pledge to not raise 
taxes on America’s lower- and middle- 
income earners. Two out of three mil-
lionaires will get a tax cut while the 
middle class gets a tax hike. 
Both the liberal Tax Policy Center 
and Congress’ own scorekeeper, the 
Joint Committee on Taxation, confirm 
this. This bill imposes over $400 billion 
in taxes on America’s small businesses, 
which couldn’t come at a worse time. 
There are $800 billion in tax increases 
on American businesses who compete 
both here and around the world. 
This is an economic surrender to 
China, Russia, Japan, and Europe; driv-
ing American jobs, investment, and 
manufacturing overseas. 
The new corporate minimum tax is 
really a Made in America tax. 
It hits American manufacturing, en-
ergy, and technology businesses the 
hardest along with American con-
sumers. 
The 
international 
tax 
in-
creases make it better to be a foreign 
company or consumer than an Amer-
ican one. 
Is it any wonder our foreign competi-
tors are happy to embrace a small glob-
al minimum tax; they are getting 
American jobs and a big bite of our tax 
base. 
There is a troubling new tax that 
hurts retirement plans, harming work-
ers and seniors the most by punishing 
businesses that invest in their own 
stock. 
All this while the Federal Govern-
ment enjoys record-high levels of tax 
revenue from corporations, small busi-
nesses, and high-income earners due to 
the Republican tax cuts in 2017. 
This $4 trillion socialist tax and 
spending binge will drive prices up 
even higher on families and make the 
damaging labor shortage even worse. 
As businesses from Main Street to 
manufacturing struggle to find work-
ers, Democrats’ changes to the child 
tax credit no longer require Americans 
to earn or to work to qualify for 
monthly checks. 
Experts predict this, along with lav-
ish COVID-era Affordable Care Act sub-
sidies, could drive up to 2 million more 
Americans to exit the workforce. 
Under their paid leave plan, tax-
payers will pay billions of dollars to 
put Washington in charge of your time 
off while workers struggle with one- 
size-fits-all mandates that limit choice 
for families and crush small businesses. 
This is crazy, too: Democrats are in-
sisting on giving a huge tax windfall to 
the wealthy 1 percent of Americans by 
lifting the reasonable SALT cap. The 
cost of this tax give-away? A whopping 
$222 billion. 
The penthouse gets an obscene tax 
break, but the building janitor gets 
nothing. The middle class gets nothing. 
The 90 percent of taxpayers who don’t 
itemize their taxes get nothing but 
higher taxes themselves. 
Where are their priorities? The SALT 
windfall for the wealthy is 50 times 
larger than the help a parent gets from 
the child tax credit. 
And it gets worse. Democrats are 
spitting away $550 billion in green pork 
subsidies for the wealthy and the 
world’s biggest corporations. 
Democrats are forcing taxpayers to 
send $12,500 to a wealthy family buying 
a luxury electric vehicle worth 80 
grand. They quietly snuck in tax 
breaks for wealthy trial lawyers, re-
cording artists, electric bikes, and sub-
sidies for the media. Of course, labor 
unions get a huge haul, including forc-
ing the 90 percent of Americans who 
don’t join a union to subsidize a few 
who do. 
While special interests cash in, fami-
lies don’t. Did you know this includes a 
new toddler tax that will force middle- 
class families to pay $13,000 more a 
year for their childcare? 
And there are budget gimmicks ga-
lore. 
‘‘It costs zero’’ will go down in his-
tory as one of the biggest whoppers a 
President has ever told. 
The true deficit is trillions of dollars 
over the decade. 
And one of the budget gimmicks 
lands on American seniors who won’t 
have affordable generic drugs in the fu-
ture to choose from. 
Another budget gimmick is super-
charging the IRS with 80,000 new 
agents. While Democrats will say they 
have walked away from their bank sur-
veillance plan, the White House is 
‘‘hopeful’’ Senators will sneak it back 
in. 
If you are worried about rising prices 
shrinking your paychecks more and 
more every month, these trillions in 
new government spending will only 
make it worse. 
Inflation is killing families, forcing 
them to effectively pay a second util-
ity bill, a second cell phone bill, or a 
second cable bill a month. Inflation is 
a tax, and Democrats are raising it in 
this bill. 
So crippling taxes, driving jobs over-
seas, making the worker shortage 
worse, and driving prices higher; this is 
a terrible bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1145 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), who had a pro-
found impact on the renewable energy 
tax credits. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, this is historic legislation, 
one of the most impactful investments 
in American workers, families, and 
communities during my time in Con-
gress. 
This bill includes the most sweeping 
and ambitious climate policy ever 
passed by Congress—the GREEN Act, 
legislation I was proud to lead with my 
Democratic colleagues on the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. It provides 
4 weeks of paid family leave and funds 
universal pre-K. It extends the child 
tax credit, a tax cut for working fami-
lies that has dramatically reduced 
child poverty since it was signed into 
law. 
This bill makes healthcare premiums 
more affordable, provides tax incen-
tives to improve disaster resiliency, 
and funds the VA so our veterans get 
the services they earned. And this bill 
is paid for. 
The investments in this bill are too 
many to list; but it is just that, an in-
vestment. This bill will pay dividends 
for generations, and I urge everyone to 
pass the Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY), one of our tax 
leaders. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I think a lot of us go 
out and actually do our own shopping.

And I know now when I go out to shop, 
I not only look at the front of the box, 
I look to the back to see what is in it. 
So we have here the Biden build back 
better sauce. Here it is. It is flavored 
with SALT tax, by the way, so don’t 
worry about your sodium content. And 
trust them. ‘‘It is in there.’’ 
What is in there; 150 new government 
programs. How about this? This is a 
great bargain for the hardworking 
American taxpayer. Now, they’re say-
ing it is only going to cost you $1.7 tril-
lion, and only in Washington would 
they say ‘‘only’’. 
The cost per American, $53,000 apiece; 
$550 billion for the Green New Deal; 
$412 billion in small business taxes; $80 
billion for those wonderful guys from 
the IRS that are coming to tear you 
apart; $7.8 billion on environmental 
justice; massive electric vehicle sub-
sidies for the very wealthy; govern-
ment paid leave for high-priced CEOs; 
subsidies for wealthy families; a SALT 
tax break for millionaires; and the 
Tree Equity Program. 
Who in the world would not buy this 
package? They will if they turn around 
and look at the back and understand 
that it is on sale right now in this 
House for $4 trillion. Hurry up, Amer-
ican taxpayers, before we run out of 
money. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. CLARK), a fellow Bay 
Stater, good friend, terrific leader. 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NEAL for 
his incredible work in putting together 
this bill and all his leadership and 
friendship. And today, we have the 
build back better agenda before us that 
was built on conversations that Presi-
dent Biden had with the American peo-
ple so we can meet this time of historic 
challenge 
for 
them 
with 
historic 
progress. 
The Build Back Better Act lowers 
costs and taxes for working families, 
creates jobs, and puts us on a path to-
wards sustainability. We will provide 26 
million children with access to afford-
able, quality childcare and universal 
pre-K. This will let families, and espe-
cially women in this country, get back 
to work and give all of our kids a great 
start. 
We will build one million units of af-
fordable housing, cut prescription drug 
costs and cap insulin costs, expand 
healthcare coverage, extend the his-
toric child tax cut, and invest directly 
in climate resiliency and clean energy. 
We declare with this bill that care is 
economic infrastructure and send a 
message to families and providers both 
that help is on the way. And all of this 
is done with a through line of equity. 
This is what is possible when we put 
families front and center here in Wash-
ington. 
Mr. Speaker, so today, we build back 
better. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from In-
diana (Mrs. WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as our Nation faces cri-
sis on every front, Democrats are fo-
cused on grabbing more control over 
Americans’ lives. Their Big Govern-
ment agenda empowers bureaucrats to 
take away our constitutional liberties. 
You don’t get the vaccine, you get 
fired. 
You try to manufacture something in 
America, you get taxed. 
You want to know what is being 
taught in your child’s school, you are 
labeled a domestic terrorist. 
This is America today, folks. Parents 
around 
the 
country 
are 
sounding 
alarms about what is being taught in 
public schools. If you think parents are 
engaged now, wait till you see what 
happens when they find out their only 
option for the daycare is a government- 
appointed 
provider. 
Faith-based 
daycares disappear with this bill. 
This really is breaking news for any-
body 
watching. 
Your 
faith-based 
daycare is eliminated with this bill. 
Parents, listen up. This isn’t a Repub-
lican or Democrat or Independent 
thing, this is an American thing. This 
is dangerous. It is happening, and a 
‘‘yes’’ vote brings this in. Please vote 
‘‘no’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE), a terrific 
member of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Build Back Bet-
ter Act. This transformational legisla-
tion will help grow our economy, get 
families back to work, and set our next 
generation up for long-term success. 
The bill includes a 1-year extension 
of the child tax credit, a historic mid-
dle-class tax cut for families. It has al-
ready lifted 3.5 million children out of 
poverty. The bill also will help build or 
preserve over 800,000 affordable housing 
units over the next decade through an 
expansion of the low-income housing 
tax credit, ensuring millions more 
Americans will have a safe place to call 
home. 
There is so much more in this legisla-
tion that will deliver direct support to 
our families, like making childcare and 
healthcare more affordable and acces-
sible and making historic investments 
in fighting the climate crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote to build back better and support 
this legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. LAHOOD), a member of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the so- 
called Build Back Better agenda. Presi-
dent Biden campaigned as a moderate 
problem-solver, but has governed as a 
radical progressive. 
Under nearly a year of Democrat con-
trol in Washington, we have witnessed 
devastating consequences, stifling in-
flation, massive labor shortages, a sup-
ply chain crisis, and devastation at our 
southern border. 
Instead of stepping back and working 
with Republicans to address the real- 
life issues American families are fac-
ing, President Biden and the Demo-
crats are pressing ahead with the most 
radical legislative agenda in my life-
time. 
Here is what the bill does: raises 
taxes on Illinois farmers, middle-in-
come workers, and small businesses, 
while subsidizing the wealthiest indi-
viduals on the coasts; encourages the 
IRS to snoop on average Illinoisan’s 
bank accounts; and pushes us to the 
brink of becoming a welfare state. 
Moreover, this bill is not paid for, as 
the Democrats claim, and will only 
bankrupt 
our 
children 
and 
grand-
children. This so-called Build Back 
Better agenda is a bad deal for Illinois 
and American families, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Con-
necticut 
(Mr. 
LARSON), 
neighbor, 
friend, and an effective member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NEAL for 
his outstanding leadership. 
Wow. Can you feel the love in this 
room today? Can’t you? I will tell you, 
I got to hand it to you, the ‘‘vote no 
and take the dough’’ crowd is pretty 
good. Everybody votes against the bill 
but then gets a newsletter out and 
takes credit for all the good work that 
is in the bill. No one voted for the 
American Rescue Plan, and yet, you 
took credit for that and sent letters 
out to people about their checks. But 
that is to be understood. 
Mr. Speaker, what this bill does is to 
make sure that working families, on 
average, will get $430 back in their 
pockets each month; save more than 
$14,000 a year in childcare; and uni-
versal pre-K will save families about 
$8,600 a year as well. Seniors will now 
have lower prescription drug prices, an 
estimated savings of $900 a year; and 
families in Connecticut will no longer 
be double-taxed on State and local 
taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank ROSA DELAURO 
and RICH NEAL for their hard work. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN), a member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, today we 
are a simple majority vote away from 
the largest expansion of the Federal 
Government in the history of this 
great Nation, ushering a new era of de-
pendence on socialized government. 
We sit at a crossroads between two 
different directions: 
Free will or government control. 
Honest, hard work or cradle-to-grave 
welfare. 
Generational debt or deficit reduc-
tion. 
Tax increases or tax reduction.

History will remember which road we 
decide to go down. I strongly encourage 
you to choose wisely and vote ‘‘no’’— 
vote ‘‘no’’—on the build back broke 
bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), who had a sub-
stantive impact on the writing of this 
legislation. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to express my strong 
support for the Build Back Better Act 
and commend all of those who played a 
role in making it happen, especially 
Speaker PELOSI and chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee, RICHARD 
NEAL, and all of the members and staff 
on that committee. 
Build Back Better seriously reduces 
longstanding poverty among children. 
Which children? All children; poor chil-
dren, Black children, Brown children, 
White children, children of disadvan-
taged families. It reduces poverty for 4 
million children. 
Build Back Better will provide pre- 
school programs for children of work-
ing families across America. It even 
provides help for individuals who have 
prison records so that they can get jobs 
and go to work. 
It is good for America. It is good for 
every community in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support it, 
and I urge its passing. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, the esteemed gentleman 
from Texas very much. 
Mr. Speaker, this break business’ 
backs bill is the latest iteration of an 
upside-down—in 
fact, 
inverted—eco-
nomic agenda, ignoring today’s prob-
lems and doubling down on what we see 
are failed policies. 
What is in this partisan reconcili-
ation bill says more about Democrat’s 
Big Government agenda than people’s 
actual needs, and it will exacerbate 
challenges currently facing working 
families and small businesses. It is an 
$80,000 tax break for wealthy individ-
uals and $400 billion tax hike on small 
businesses, with a total of $800 billion 
in new taxes. That is a fact. 
It subsidizes green energy but it has 
a new tax on natural gas, making heat-
ing your home more expensive. That is 
a fact. 
It disincentivizes work with new un-
accountable entitlements while busi-
ness owners are desperate to fill nearly 
10 million jobs. It will increase costs on 
domestic businesses and manufacturers 
and make products overseas more at-
tractive. And it is big spending that ev-
eryone agrees is not paid for; will in-
crease debt to somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of—I don’t know, what is the 
debt ceiling request going to be?—$34-, 
$35-, $36 trillion on something that was 
said was going to cost zero? Decrease 
GDP, reduces wage growth, and drives 
inflation higher. We need to make our 
country better not make government 
bigger. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS), author, scholar, 
and effective member of the Committee 
on Ways and Means. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding, for his integrity, and his 
steady leadership throughout this proc-
ess. 
I am proud of the legislation that we 
are considering today, and the entire 
House should be as well. Over the past 
two decades we have spent $6 trillion in 
three Middle East wars. 
Today, this Congress is cementing a 
commitment to finally nation-building 
at home, in America and for Ameri-
cans; investments in American families 
to 
help 
them 
become 
healthier, 
happier, and more productive into and 
through adulthood. 
Mr. Speaker, because of this bill, the 
future of my community in Western 
New York will be stronger and more re-
silient. We are building back better, 
stronger, and longer. This bill reflects 
our optimism as Americans to confront 
our challenges with strength. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
b 1200 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. FERGUSON), the chief deputy whip 
and a member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, what I 
really want to say about this bill would 
probably make me wind up on the 
prayer list of the church folks back 
home. 
This bill is horrendous for America. 
Most Americans want a job; they want 
a decent, safe place to live; they want 
their kids educated; and they want to 
be left alone to lead their lives the way 
that they want to. This bill violates 
every one of those basic tenets. 
It is going to destroy the economy 
and raise inflation. People will not be 
economically more secure. 
It is encouraging additional illegal 
immigration at our southern border, 
and it is making our communities less 
safe. 
It 
is 
going 
to 
destroy 
private 
daycare. This bill is going to allow the 
government to tell you where you have 
to have your kids educated. 
Has the majority not learned any-
thing from what happened in the elec-
tions a couple of weeks ago? 
By the way, it is going to tell you 
how you have to live your life, what 
kind of car you can buy, what kind of 
business you can run, and how to oper-
ate your business. Americans are sick 
and tired of this kind of government 
overreach. 
Mr. Speaker, 87,000 new IRS agents to 
spy on Americans’ bank accounts, to 
come dig in the cushions of your couch, 
in order to pay for SALT? This thing 
stinks like 3-day-old roadkill on south 
Georgia asphalt. Vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Wis-
consin (Ms. MOORE), the passionate ad-
vocate for the people of Milwaukee. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I am so proud to support the Build 
Back Better Act. It is time for us to 
pass this historic legislation that in-
vests in our communities, our workers, 
our children, and our families, while 
asking the wealthiest among us, who 
have benefited from our growing econ-
omy, to pay their fair share. 
These investments will lower the 
costs of childcare, which has kept 
women out of the labor force. It invests 
in our future workforce through our 
children. It helps us tackle the climate 
crisis, bolsters resilience, and creates 
economic and job opportunities and 
good-paying jobs for millions. I could 
go on and on and on. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to end by talk-
ing about the millions of people who 
depend upon insulin, something that 
has been a bipartisan issue. It is going 
to lower those costs to just $35 a 
month. That is reason enough to pass 
the Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. SMUCKER), a member of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I hope 
the American people are watching 
closely today because there is a funda-
mental question being debated, and 
that is: What should the role of the 
Federal Government be in each of our 
daily lives, and what economic system 
best provides for the opportunity and 
well-being of the American people? 
That is the question today. 
Democrats believe—they said this in 
our hearings—that the Federal Govern-
ment should provide everything to en-
sure all needs are met for middle-in-
come Americans. 
We believe in earned success. We be-
lieve in rewarding hard work. That sys-
tem, the free market system, has pro-
vided more opportunity than ever be-
fore in the history of mankind. 
Mr. Speaker, freedoms aren’t taken 
all at once. They are taken bit by bit 
by bit. This is a move toward an en-
tirely different economic system. It is 
a move toward socialism. 
We know that doesn’t work. Look at 
every country in history that has over-
delivered and overspent. It has not 
ended well. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER), whose economic advice 
abounds through this institution. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his extraordinary

leadership on the Ways and Means 
Committee in putting this together, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port the Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill finally makes 
it clear that our government’s most 
important responsibility is to give 
every American the possibility for life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
The Build Back Better Act makes the 
boldest actions to fight the existential 
crisis of climate change. 
It contains some of the most impor-
tant benefits for American families 
ever contemplated by Congress: low-
ering drug prices, paid family leave, af-
fordable childcare and healthcare, uni-
versal pre-kindergarten, and an ex-
tended child tax credit. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill would boost 
our economy in the best and strongest 
way by investing in our workforce and 
increasing labor force participation. 
It will create long-term structural 
benefits 
for 
our 
economy 
that 
strengthen our supply chains, reduce 
the effects that drive up energy prices, 
and restrain inflation. 
Along with the recently enacted in-
frastructure bill, it will create millions 
of jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, a vote for the Build 
Back Better Act is a vote for sustained, 
long-term economic growth that will 
benefit generations of Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I can’t help 
but wonder what my so-called mod-
erate colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are waiting for, with bated 
breath, from a CBO score. 
You don’t need a CBO score to know 
that $100 billion worth of amnesty, 
when our border is wide open, will crip-
ple the State of Texas, cripple our 
country, and cause thousands of pounds 
of fentanyl to pour into our country. 
You don’t need a CBO score to know 
that a 900 percent increase in OSHA 
fines to go after small businesses and 
shut them down with tyrannical vac-
cine mandates is going to cripple jobs 
and small businesses across the coun-
try. 
You don’t need a CBO score to know 
that $500 billion of unicorn climate 
agenda energy policies are going to 
drive up heating costs, drive up the 
cost of gasoline, and cripple our econ-
omy. You don’t need a CBO score to op-
pose that. 
You don’t need a CBO score to know 
that $300 billion of tax giveaways to ba-
sically blue State Yankees is going to 
somehow fix our country. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. EVANS), a highly effec-
tive member of the Ways and Means 
Committee and a terrific gentleman 
from Philadelphia. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, Philadel-
phians have been asking for help even 
before the pandemic, help with things 
like childcare, the cost of prescription 
drugs, housing, and jobs. 
Philadelphia, I have heard you. I am 
proud to vote for the Build Back Better 
Act and the infrastructure bill this 
week. 
Most of all, today, we make history. 
We make history because we are doing 
something for the American public. 
And it is important to remember, Build 
Back Better sends a message to every 
single American that we are on their 
side. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), the ranking mem-
ber 
of 
the 
Select 
Revenue 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition. It seems the 
majority has seen everything that the 
American people are angry about and 
are doubling down instead of address-
ing the very problems that need to be 
addressed. 
Americans are angry about the pro-
posed million-dollar payments to folks 
who want to come to our country ille-
gally. This bill makes that worse. 
Americans are angry they can’t get 
the IRS to answer the telephone. This 
bill 
spends 
$45 
billion 
to 
further 
weaponize the IRS. 
Americans 
are 
angry 
that 
store 
shelves are empty and prices are rising 
because of worker shortages. This bill 
makes it worse. 
Americans can’t get necessities like 
cars. In my district, newly manufac-
tured farm equipment sits unfinished 
and undelivered because of chip short-
ages. This bill makes it worse. 
Our economy is hurting. We need to 
get the American people back to work. 
This bill is only going to make life 
harder and more expensive for the very 
people who some are claiming to try to 
help. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and one of the only two Members left 
from the class of 1988 in Congress. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Build Back Bet-
ter Act. 
This legislation builds on our efforts 
to make healthcare more affordable 
and accessible for all Americans, in-
cluding millions unfairly caught in the 
Medicaid coverage gap. 
It also makes prescription drugs 
more affordable by finally giving Medi-
care the ability to negotiate lower drug 
prices with the pharmaceutical compa-
nies. Seniors will also pay no more 
than $2,000 a year in out-of-pocket 
costs for their drugs, and the legisla-
tion penalizes Big Pharma companies 
that unfairly raise prices. 
The Build Back Better Act also ag-
gressively tackles the worsening cli-
mate crisis. The new greenhouse gas 
reduction fund will accelerate innova-
tion in low- and zero-emission tech-
nologies. Rebates for homeowners to 
electrify and make their houses more 
efficient will save them money and re-
duce emissions. The new methane 
emissions reduction program will drive 
down pollution from the oil and gas in-
dustry. 
Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot wait 
any longer to combat the climate cri-
sis. Bold action is needed now. 
The Build Back Better Act invests in 
the American people and our future 
and deserves strong support today. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from West 
Virginia (Mrs. MILLER), a member of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, since President Biden has 
taken office, he has tried to increase 
taxes on everyone. His Build Back Bet-
ter Act—or as I like to call it, build 
back broke—is the latest example of 
his radical tax and spend agenda. 
This bill includes $4.5 trillion in new 
spending, $1.5 trillion in new taxes, and 
will cause $3 trillion in new debt. 
I introduced two amendments in this 
legislation, one that would ensure 
Americans still have access to life-
saving cures and one that would ensure 
Members of Congress do not benefit 
from 
Democrats’ 
SALT 
deduction. 
Democrats rejected both. 
If passed, this reconciliation package 
will negatively affect all facets of our 
day-to-day lives. It will make energy 
more expensive, tax small family busi-
nesses, ship American jobs overseas, 
and make the inflation crisis worse. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), the chair-
woman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, who is an advocate on behalf of 
the child tax credit. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, the 
Build Back Better Act strengthens our 
economy and changes the lives of mil-
lions of Americans. 
It fights inflation because it is fully 
paid for by making big corporations 
and the wealthiest pay their fair share. 
No one making under $400,000 will pay 
a penny more in taxes. 
It expands and improves the child tax 
credit, the biggest tax cut for working 
families 
with 
children, 
a 
trans-
formative policy that the chairman 
and I have been fighting for, for nearly 
20 years. It is a lifeline for the middle 
class and lifts over 50 percent of chil-
dren out of poverty. 
It 
guarantees 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
childcare will not exceed 7 percent of a 
family’s income. It includes paid fam-
ily and medical leave, which responds 
to the needs of all people so they can 
take time off to care for themselves or 
a loved one. 
It delivers a historic and once-in-a- 
generation investment in combating 
climate change that cannot wait. 
It lowers healthcare costs. It pro-
vides universal pre-K. I could go on and 
on. 
We have an opportunity to build the 
architecture for the future for working 
families. 
Working 
and 
middle-class 
families across this country are count-
ing on us to build a better and stronger 
America.

November 18, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, the U.S. Conference of Catho-
lic Bishops said it was completely un-
acceptable that the Build Back Better 
Act expands taxpayer funding of abor-
tion in many new and expanding pro-
grams. 
The National Right to Life Com-
mittee has pointed out that even 
ObamaCare contained a provision that 
specifically permitted States to ban 
elective abortions in their exchanges. 
The BBB, starting in 2024, would ex-
plicitly override the laws of those 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Biden once said 
that those of us who are opposed to 
abortion should not be compelled to 
pay for them. This bill coerces us to 
pay for abortion on demand. 
Mr. Speaker, unborn babies need the 
President of the United States and 
Members of Congress to be their friends 
and advocates, not powerful adver-
saries subsidizing their violent destruc-
tion. 
b 1215 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL), who is always 
quotable. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
gratulate the gentleman on his efforts 
in this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, last November the 
American people put Democrats in 
charge to raise this Nation from its 
knees, to improve the lives of working 
men and women, to confront powerful 
interests, and to rebuild for the next 
century. New Jersey taxpayers sent us 
to provide real relief from the odious 
SALT cap. 
Don’t pick out two or three districts 
in the country. Look at the whole situ-
ation, and then decide about this low- 
hanging fruit that you took to pay for 
your disaster in 2017. 
This legislation is a blueprint for 
America to build back better. 
And what was your answer? 
We got back the next week to vote on 
the other bill, and you voted to ad-
journ. You want to go home. You don’t 
want to vote on any of those things. 
You did it. Facts matter. Dispute it. 
Only one party is making raising 
children affordable. 
Only one party is creating a green fu-
ture that aids unions and supports do-
mestic manufacturing. 
Only one party will close the tax gap 
and provide tax fairness for working 
Americans. 
The American people elected Demo-
crats to act with urgency for the 
present and the future, Mr. Speaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better 
plan is a big, bloated joke. The problem 
is it is not funny. 
At a time when inflation is sky-
rocketing, House Democrats are dou-
bling down on their socialist wish list. 
Is your family struggling financially 
after endless COVID shutdowns? 
Don’t worry. The Democrats have a 
plan. They are going to be giving $80 
billion to the IRS to double the number 
of agents who can track your spending 
habits. 
Worried about whether you can af-
ford to put gas in your car or heat your 
home this year? 
Well, House Democrats have a plan 
for that too: huge tax hikes on natural 
gas, kneecapping American-made en-
ergy products to pour billions into the 
Green New Deal. 
Are you concerned about the security 
on our borders and keeping commu-
nities safe? 
House Democrats are providing am-
nesty for 8 million illegal immigrants. 
And we still don’t know what the 
cost of this bill is going to be. There is 
no report here yet. 
Mr. Speaker, we should not be voting 
on this monstrosity, and I urge my col-
leagues to oppose it. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER). He is a very effective 
gentleman, and he is always Mid-
western nice. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Build Back 
Better Act that will make trans-
formative investments in the lives of 
everyday Americans, all without add-
ing to the deficit. 
This bill is good for our country. It 
will unquestionably enhance the future 
for our children, but also improve the 
here and now for their parents and 
grandparents 
creating 
opportunities 
like universal pre-K. 
It takes on national challenges by 
lowering the cost of prescription drugs 
and, critically important, giving work-
ing families a tax cut. 
I have said from the start that I want 
a bill that will address four things: cli-
mate 
change, 
kids 
and 
education, 
healthcare, and economic growth. This 
legislation checks every box. 
I am proud of the work of all the 
House committees, and particularly 
our Ways and Means Committee. I am 
also proud that several initiatives I 
have long championed are included in 
this bill, including sustainable aviation 
fuel to fight climate change, Health 
Profession 
Opportunity 
Grants 
and 
graduate medical education to make 
healthcare more accessible, onshore 
wind manufacturing tax credits to bol-
ster domestic energy supply chains, 
and, significantly, tax cuts through the 
child tax credit and State and local tax 
deduction. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ARRINGTON), who is a key member 
on the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the great 
State of Texas for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have said a lot about 
the disastrous effects of this gar-
gantuan tax and spend bill on the heels 
of an economy that is sputtering on ac-
count of massive spending, which is 
driving inflation, and on the unemploy-
ment policies that have locked labor 
on the sidelines, and you have got vac-
cine mandates coming down the pike. 
This is the proposal from my Democrat 
colleagues and my friends. 
What I can’t understand, for the life 
of me, Mr. Speaker, is that in this bill, 
that is supposed to go after the in-
equity gap in our country, they have 
the largest spending program as a give-
away to millionaires from high-tax 
States like New York and California, 
$280 billion. There are special interest 
carve-outs. This looks like a Christmas 
tree of giveaways to political allies, 
unions, plaintiffs’ attorneys, and media 
corporations. 
That is all in this bill, Mr. Speaker. 
I plead with my colleagues: Relent. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA), who is a very ef-
fective member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his leadership and for 
his love of this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better 
Act is about future opportunity for our 
districts and for our democracy. 
As an immigrant-fueled, frontier na-
tion, we value individual mobility and 
reward hard work. That is the founda-
tion of why we are the richest and 
most successful nation ever. However, 
we are at an inflection point in which 
the past failure to invest in our work-
ing families has led to the degradation 
of our common life. That is why now 
more than ever we must provide more 
for the people who have plied through 
the pandemic, who propel our economic 
prosperity and promote our national 
unity. 
This legislation does that by focusing 
on children, education, healthcare, and 
affordable housing; by furthering our 
fight for clean energy and climate re-
siliency with e-buses, e-bikes, and 
microgrids; and by financing it in a 
way that protects our family farms and 
promotes our farm workers. 
For those of you who vote against 
this legislation today, you will prob-
ably take credit for it tomorrow be-
cause this investment will benefit not 
just my constituents but yours, too, 
because this bill provides every work-
ing family, not just with the resources 
to succeed in our country but with the 
dignity they deserve by playing a part 
in our democracy. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 1 minute. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a whole host of 
organizations, 
coalitions, 
patient 
groups, health advocacy groups, insti-
tutions, associations, and small busi-
nesses who have vehemently opposed 
and raised alarming concerns about 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
that list.

Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a letter from the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
ness, the Nation’s leading small busi-
ness advocacy group underscoring how 
this proposed bill will impose a small 
business surtax on already struggling 
mom-and-pop shops across America. 
NFIB, 
Washington, DC, November 5, 2021. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of NFIB, 
the nation’s leading small business advocacy 
organization, I write in strong opposition of 
H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act. This 
legislation would increase taxes, impose new 
mandates, and increase penalties on small 
business owners, threatening to disrupt the 
fragile small business recovery. H.R. 5376 
will be considered an NFIB Key Vote for the 
117th Congress. 
NFIB opposes efforts to raise taxes on 
small businesses. The Build Back Better Act 
broadens existing passive income taxes and 
applies them to active income, creating a 
true ‘‘Small Business Surtax.’’ Specifically, 
the legislation substantially expands the 
3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) on 
pass-through business income and applies it 
to all business income above $400,000 (indi-
vidual filers) and $500,000 (joint filers). The 
threshold is even lower for family businesses 
held as trusts, with the surtax applying to 
income above $13,000. These thresholds are 
not indexed for inflation, so the ‘‘Small Busi-
ness Surtax’’ will impact an increasing num-
ber of businesses and an increasing percent-
age of business income every year. 
Three-quarters of small employers are or-
ganized as pass-through entities (S Corpora-
tions, LLCs, Sole Proprietorships, and Part-
nerships). The ‘‘Small Business Surtax’’ 
would negatively impact more than 750,000 
pass-through businesses and over half of 
pass-through business income. When com-
bined with the other surtaxes on certain 
pass-through businesses, these tax changes 
create a 48.8% federal effective tax rate on 
pass-through business income before even 
considering state and local taxes. NFIB’s lat-
est tax survey, small business owners shared 
that federal business income taxes were the 
most burdensome tax on both a financial and 
administrative basis. These taxes will divert 
resources away from job creation, compensa-
tion increases, and business investment and 
further complicate tax compliance. The per-
manent tax increases fund temporary spend-
ing programs, meaning additional tax hikes 
will be necessary if the programs are ex-
tended and offset. 
NFIB is also concerned about the impact of 
a government-run paid family and medical 
leave program may have on small employers. 
The Build Back Better Act creates a four- 
week federal paid family and medical leave 
program for all workers without regard to 
employer size. This program would be a sig-
nificant change to small employers (fewer 
than 50 employees) who are currently not 
subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act 
(FMLA). Congress wrote this exemption into 
law because they understood that an em-
ployer mandate like FMLA would be burden-
some, and compliance would be difficult. In a 
recent NFIB member ballot, 90% of small 
businesses believe that small employers 
should be exempt from paid sick and family 
leave mandates. Requiring small business 
participation in a federal paid family and 
medical leave program would take away the 
flexibility many small businesses need to be 
able to manage their workforce at a time 
when half of small business owners are strug-
gling to fill open positions. 
NFIB opposes increased penalty amounts 
and increased penalty exposure on small 
businesses. The Build Back Better Act in-
creases civil monetary penalties on small 
businesses with isolated errors when trying 
to comply with complicated federal employ-
ment law and increases penalty exposure for 
employers by expanding the Affordable Care 
Act’s employer mandate. Fair Labor Stand-
ard Act (FLSA) violations currently operate 
under a strict liability standard, meaning 
employers who make an honest misinter-
pretation of the law or make an isolated mis-
take are not given leniency. The legislation 
also increases civil monetary penalties for 
violations under the Occupational, Safety, 
and Health Act (OSHA), as well as those 
under the National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA). If penalties are substantially in-
creased, a single error could ruin a small em-
ployer and permanently put them out of 
business. Further, the legislation lowers the 
definition of ‘‘affordability’’ for the ACA’s 
employer mandate, which would drive up 
health insurance costs for employers. Small 
businesses do not have the operating revenue 
of larger businesses and cannot simply ab-
sorb these substantial fines and cost in-
creases. They also do not have legal and 
human resources departments to negotiate 
lower fines with agency officials or lower 
premiums with health insurers. 
Small businesses are struggling with labor 
shortages, rising inflation, supply chain dis-
ruptions, 
and 
increasing 
threats

COVID–19 variants. Congress should not im-
pose significant tax increases, inflexible 
mandates, and massive new civil monetary 
penalties on small businesses as they would 
compound these problems and damage the 
fragile small business recovery. NFIB op-
poses H.R. 5376 and will consider the legisla-
tion an NFIB Key Vote for the 117th Con-
gress. 
Sincerely, 
KEVIN KUHLMAN, 
Vice President, 
Federal Government Relations. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a letter from American 
Farm Bureau who represents nearly 6 
million families and American farmers 
asking us to reject passage of this bill 
due to inflation and how this hurts 
America’s farmers. 
AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, 
Washington, DC, November 16, 2021. 
Hon. lll 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
Farm Bureau’s nearly 6–million member 
families, I write to urge you to oppose the 
Build Back Better Act, a piece of legislation 
that raises taxes and spends more taxpayer 
money at a time our country can afford to do 
neither. 
Inflation is driving up costs across the 
economy, 
and 
greatly 
increased 
federal 
spending is a contributing factor. Federal 
policy choices have raised energy prices, 
leading to higher costs for everything from 
food to used cars. And yet this legislation 
will further exasperate that pain through a 
methane tax on oil and gas. 
The Consumer Price Index is at a 31-year 
high, and unlikely to reach historical norms 
any time soon, having risen 6.2% since this 
time last year. Inflation is a hefty tax on 
every American’s paycheck. 
While certain funding increases or newly 
created programs may, by themselves, be 
commendable, the totality of the increased 
federal spending in this bill coupled with the 
enormously burdensome tax increases lev-
eled on businesses and individuals to pay for 
it will stifle economic growth and destroy 
jobs. Ultimately, the result could be the con-
solidation or sale of family farms and 
ranches. 
The legislation also seeks to raise revenue 
by increasing fines and penalties as much as 
ten times their current amount for viola-
tions of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, and Migrant 
and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protec-
tion Act. The missteps of farmers and ranch-
ers when navigating complex, oftentimes on-
erous regulations and laws should not serve 
as a funding mechanism. While Farm Bureau 
does not condone bad actors when it comes 
to appropriately managing safety, the sea-
sonal workforce, and employee pay on the 
farm, fines associated with OSHA, FLSA, or 
MSPA violations should not be determined 
based on their ability to serve as a pay-for in 
a partisan legislative process. If enacted, 
these provisions could put well-meaning 
farmers and ranchers out of business. 
While some elements of the reconciliation 
package would benefit agriculture, the mas-
sive amount of spending and tax increases 
required to pay for the plan outweigh the 
gains we would see in rural America. Also, 
the manner in which they were crafted is 
concerning. The agriculture industry and the 
committees of jurisdiction have held to a 
long tradition of bipartisanship that we have 
seen erode over this past year. We hope this 
does not negatively impact future farm pol-
icy discussions. 
In addition, the best policy is that which is 
discussed in an open and transparent manner 
with input from a variety of stakeholders. 
Reconciliation has been anything but trans-
parent with billions of dollars not even dis-
cussed by the committees of jurisdiction. 
This should concern all advocates of good 
and responsible government. 
The economy is still recovering from the 
pandemic, supply chains are stressed, and in-
flation is putting pressure on America’s 
pocketbooks. Now is not the time to put an 
additional burden on families struggling to 
make ends meet. After watching months of 
contentious, partisan debate surrounding the 
Build Back Better Act, Farm Bureau can 
only stand in opposition to the legislation. 
Respectfully, 
ZIPPY DUVALL, 
President. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GOMEZ), whose negotiating 
skill on USMCA really impressed me. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as a second-generation Amer-
ican. I am the son of Mexican immi-
grants who came here in pursuit of the 
American promise; a promise that if 
you work hard and follow the rules, 
you will succeed, and your children and 
grandchildren will build on that suc-
cess. 
Unfortunately, the promise has elud-
ed far too many Americans, particu-
larly the working class and people of 
color. Although some of them feel 
America has given up on them, they 
have refused to give up on America. 
That is why we must pass the Build 
Back Better Act to make historic in-
vestments in our people and our planet 
and put the American promise within 
reach of an entire generation for the 
first time. 
Through the Build Back Better Act, 
we have an opening to invest in chil-
dren and families by expanding the 
child tax credit and universal pre-K, 
give millions of families an affordable 
place to call home, and tackle climate 
change 
while 
creating 
good-paying 
jobs. We have a chance to redefine our 
commitment to the American people 
and to move toward a more just, equi-
table, and perfect Union. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Nevada 
(Mr. HORSFORD), who is a terrific advo-
cate for all things Nevada. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to highlight the historic investments 
that Ways and Means Democrats have 
secured in the Build Back Better Act. 
For years, Americans have seen their 
cost of living rise while my colleagues 
across the aisle focused on tax cuts for 
the wealthy and the well-connected. At 
long last, with Democrats in the ma-
jority, 
Congress 
is 
delivering 
the 
change that our constituents deserve. 
As we rebound from the pandemic, I 
am very proud that the Build Back 
Better Act includes my bills to cap 
out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, 
lower healthcare premiums for working 
students, and improve wages, benefits, 
and training for workers at nursing 
homes and hospitals. 
I also want to acknowledge the major 
investments in our clean energy future. 
To tackle the climate crisis and create 
good union jobs, the Build Back Better 
Act includes my bills to invest in clean 
energy transmission and incentivize 
production of dynamic glass. 
The Build Back Better Act will pay 
for itself, create millions of good-pay-
ing jobs, and lower costs for our fami-
lies. And critically, through a $5 billion 
investment in my bill to prevent com-
munity violence, the Build Back Better 
Act will keep our communities safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to pass 
this bold investment in America. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from the 
Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT), who is a 
very effective member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, with 
the Build Back Better Act, we are in-
vesting in a strong economy, in jobs, 
and ensuring that children, families, 
and all of our communities can com-
pete and succeed equitably in the 21st 
century. 
This will tremendously benefit all 
districts, 
including 
districts 
whose 
Members will not vote for the bill. No 
doubt many of them will try to take 
credit for this as they stand against 
this transformative investment in our 
economic future. 
Build Back Better fights inflation be-
cause it is paid for and because it helps 
working people return to work, in-
creasing supply. Build Back Better re-
duces the deficit, as we have seen from 
scoring that has been released as we 
developed the package. 
Americans overwhelmingly support 
Build Back Better because the Amer-
ican people broadly agree we face an 
urgent choice between Republicans 
who insist on keeping the economy 
that serves the wealthiest and the big-
gest corporations or the Democrats 
who are giving middle-class families a 
hand up at achieving the American 
Dream. 
We have millionaires and billionaires 
paying lower tax rates than teachers, 
cops, and firefighters. 
Stop pretending you care about bal-
ancing the budget, the deficit, and the 
middle class. We saw what you cared 
for in the 2017 tax grab. 
Mr. Speaker, vote to build back bet-
ter. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of H.R. 5376 is postponed.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
SCALISE), the Republican whip, for the 
purpose of an inquiry as to the balance 
of the day. 
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gentleman 
from Maryland for yielding. Mr. Speak-
er, I would like to request if the gen-
tleman could let us know what the 
schedule is expected to be for the re-
mainder of today. 
Obviously, the reports are that there 
may be a CBO score today. I also want 
to ask the gentleman: Would it be an-
ticipated that there would first be a 
CBO score before any final passage of 
legislation? 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his question. Let me 
read through this so I reach every 
point that I think each Member needs 
to know. 
Following the next vote, the House 
will stand in recess subject to the call 
of the Chair. As all Members know, we 
are waiting for some technical pursuits 
of the budget and reconciliation proc-
ess to be completed. 
The House has completed, as I think 
all of you know, 1 hour and 40 minutes 
of the 2 hours of debate on the Build 
Back Better Act, so there will remain 
10 minutes on each side prior to the 
passage of the Build Back Better Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6597 
November 18, 2021 
We are waiting, as the gentleman in-
dicated, for the completion of a privi-
leged scrub from the Senate Parlia-
mentarians necessary for the reconcili-
ation process. 
Once we have received that informa-
tion, the Rules Committee and Mr. 
MCGOVERN will meet to report a rule 
with an additional manager’s amend-
ment to make technical corrections to 
the bill, which will be considered on 
the floor so that the Parliamentarian’s 
concerns will be met in that technical 
amendment. 
We are also awaiting the final two 
committee estimates from CBO. We ex-
pect CBO to have estimates—and I 
want to make it clear that this may 
not be the CBO score of the overall 
piece of legislation. We have just heard 
from those who are going to be reading 
that through the night, I know. We are 
also waiting for the final two com-
mittee estimates. 
As I said, I want to thank the Senate 
Parliamentarian, who has been work-
ing around the clock—their office has 
been working around the clock to get 
us to where I think we are now. 
I want to also thank CBO, who has 
been working extraordinarily hard. 
This is a large piece of legislation, 
which I guess is an understatement, 
and it is also complex. 
Having said that, obviously, CBO has 
been working for months—literally Au-
gust, September, October, and Novem-
ber—on this legislation. We appreciate 
the hard work of the Parliamentarian 
and the Director of CBO and their 
staffs. 
We are working toward completing 
the Build Back Better Act today, and 
more information on the schedule will 
be provided as soon as it becomes avail-
able. 
Let me add, if I can, Mr. Whip, it is 
my hope that we will complete this leg-
islation today so that this would be the 
last 
legislative 
day 
prior 
to 
the 
Thanksgiving work period. 
I want to make sure everybody un-
derstands, however, we will complete 
Build Back Better before we go home. I 
am hopeful and believe—I think most 
Members are hopeful—that we can do 
that tonight, whether you are for it or 
against it, that we can do it tonight, 
and that is my effort to achieve that 
objective. I know it is the Speaker’s ef-
fort as well. 
I yield to my friend, the whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. I thank the gen-
tleman. So regarding the CBO score, 
right now we are probably at about 
one-third of the bill being scored. 
Would it be expected that it wouldn’t 
come up until the full 100 percent 
would be scored or something less than 
that? 
The other question would be, if the 
Rules Committee is going to meet 
again to come out with an additional 
rule based on the Senate scrub, would 
there be additional debate on the bill 
added as part of that rule or would it 
just be a debate on the rule and then 
straight into final passage? 
Mr. HOYER. There would be debate 
on the rule, and then the 20 minutes of 
remaining debate on the bill itself; 10 
minutes on your side and 10 minutes on 
our side. 
I want to say, we do expect to have a 
full table of the score. As those of you 
who have pored over CBO scores, you 
know there is a number of pages— 
sometimes shorter, 15, it can be longer 
than that—of prose in explanation of 
the score. What we will have is the 
score itself, as I understand it, a sum-
mary table of the score. We may not 
have the prose by that time. 
I want to make it clear to you that 
that is not necessary for us to pass it. 
It is necessary, and it will be in place, 
before it goes to the Senate under the 
reconciliation rules. 
Mr. SCALISE. So for the three re-
maining committees, we have Ways 
and Means, Energy and Commerce, and 
Judiciary 
that 
still 
haven’t 
been 
scored. Would all of those be at least in 
a table? The remaining committees 
that have not been scored, would they 
be part of a breakdown table at a min-
imum, whether or not it is the more 
detailed version, as well? 
Mr. HOYER. The Energy and Com-
merce has been done, so we do have 
that. But the other two will be in the 
table, correct. 
Mr. SCALISE. So Ways and Means 
and Judiciary would also be in a table 
before something came? 
Mr. HOYER. Yes, that is my under-
standing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

TERMINATION 
OF 
EMERGENCY 
WITH RESPECT TO THE SITUA-
TION 
IN 
BURUNDI—MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117– 
76) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Consistent with subsection 204(b) of 
the 
International 
Emergency 
Eco-
nomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I 
hereby report that I have issued an Ex-
ecutive Order that terminates the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, and 
revokes that Executive Order. 
The President issued Executive Order 
13712 to deal with the unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity and foreign policy of the United 
States constituted by the situation in 
Burundi, which had been marked by 
the killing of and violence against ci-
vilians, unrest, incitement of immi-
nent violence, and significant political 
repression. In Executive Order 13712, 
the President addressed the threat by 
blocking the property and interests in 
property of, among others, persons de-
termined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of State, to be responsible for or 
complicit in actions or policies that 
threaten the peace, security, and sta-
bility of Burundi or undermine demo-
cratic processes or institutions in Bu-
rundi, or to have engaged in human 
rights abuses. 
I have determined that the situation 
in Burundi that gave rise to the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13712 has been significantly al-
tered by events of the past year, in-
cluding the transfer of power following 
elections in 2020, significantly de-
creased 
violence, 
and 
President 
Ndayishimiye’s 
pursuit 
of 
reforms 
across multiple sectors. For these rea-
sons I have determined that it is nec-
essary to terminate the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13712 
and revoke that order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess subject to 
the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 33 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSID-
ERATION 
OF 
H.R. 
5376, 
BUILD 
BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 803 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 803 
Resolved, That during further consideration 
of the bill (H.R. 5376) to provide for reconcili-
ation pursuant to title II of S. Con. Res. 14, 
pursuant to House Resolution 774, the fur-
ther amendment printed in the report of the 
Committee on Rules accompanying this res-
olution shall be considered as adopted. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, the Rules 
Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 803. The rule self-exe-
cutes an additional manager’s amend-
ment to H.R. 5376, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6599 
November 18, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I don’t think I will 
surprise anyone here when I say that 
reconciliation can be a challenging 
process. The legislation we pass here 
must be vetted to comply with the Sen-
ate’s procedural rules so that it can be 
considered there as quickly as possible. 
This is why we are here tonight, to en-
sure the historic Build Back Better bill 
can be taken up across the Capitol 
without delay. 
There was some concern that this 
process might negatively impact the 
policies and programs contained in the 
legislation. But I am proud to report 
tonight, Madam Speaker, that this rule 
makes only very technical changes. 
As the summary states, it makes 
‘‘technical changes to narrow U.S. 
Code citations and references to com-
ply with Senate procedural require-
ments.’’ 
Now, let me put that in plain 
English, Madam Speaker. The Build 
Back Better Act remains virtually un-
changed. 
That means U.S. workers will see the 
establishment of the first-ever national 
paid family and medical leave guar-
antee. 
People will see the largest expansion 
of healthcare coverage since the Af-
fordable Care Act was passed nearly a 
decade ago. 
Nine million Americans will see their 
premiums reduced through the expan-
sion of the premium tax credit. 
Four million people who are unin-
sured today will have access to quality 
care through the closing of Medicaid’s 
coverage gap. 
Those who take prescription drugs 
will see lower costs since Medicare is 
finally—finally—allowed to start nego-
tiating drug prices. 
The more than 25 million people who 
rely on insulin in this country will see 
the cost of insulin capped at just $35. 
Families will save an average of 
$8,600 per child every year through the 
establishment of universal and free 
preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. 
Five million students will see their 
Pell grants get a boost, and Dreamers 
will be eligible to receive them. 
Roughly 40 million American fami-
lies will see a tax cut through the ex-
tension of the child tax credit. This 
was first enacted in the American Res-
cue Plan and will help cut child pov-
erty nearly in half. 
And, yes, Madam Speaker, future 
generations will have a more livable 
planet through historic investments 
that we are making here to combat the 
climate crisis. 
Now, I know this has been a long 
process at times. The Rules Committee 
has spent more than a dozen hours over 
multiple meetings considering this bill, 
and that is in addition to the work of 
all the other committees. 
But now, Madam Speaker, the num-
bers have been crunched; the technical 
language has been vetted; and we are 
on the doorstep of passing this historic 
bill. 
The Build Back Better Act is a trans-
formational bill at a historic moment, 
and it is up to all of us to seize this op-
portunity. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this rule and advance this trans-
formational legislation so that we can 
deliver for the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman from Massachusetts for yield-
ing me the customary 30 minutes, and 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
in 
Joe 
Biden’s 
America, 70 percent of Americans de-
scribe this economy as poor. It is not 
hard to see why that is. 
Inflation is at a 31-year high. This 
makes it harder for everyday Ameri-
cans to purchase everyday items. It is 
also wiping out wages. 
Gas prices alone are at a 7-year high. 
American families are facing the 
most 
expensive 
Thanksgiving 
on 
record. 
The backlog of ships that are waiting 
to deliver goods has grown by 43 per-
cent since President Biden promised to 
fix our supply chain crisis last month. 
Yet, here we are, about to consider 
the most expensive bill in American 
history. We are doing this instead of 
addressing the real problems that are 
facing real Americans. 
Democrats are now doubling down on 
their failed tax and spend policies that 
will make Joe Biden’s economic crisis 
even worse than it is now. 
President Biden once said: ‘‘Show me 
your budget, and I will tell you what 
you value.’’ Well, the bill before us 
today makes one thing clear: Demo-
crats value millionaires and billion-
aires over blue-collar workers and 
American families. 
The Democrats’ Big Government so-
cialist spending spree provides tax cuts 
of up to $25,900 for millionaires, home 
buying and childcare subsidies for cou-
ples making over $200,000, and electric 
vehicle subsidies for couples who bring 
in more than half a million dollars a 
year. 
Those are the values of my col-
leagues across the aisle. In total, there 
are $250 billion in tax breaks for the 
top 1 percent. 
Who will be paying for the wealthy to 
buy a new mansion or maybe put a new 
Tesla in their five-car garage? That is 
easy. It is going to be middle-class 
Americans, working families who have 
to subsidize these extravagances. 
The left-leaning Tax Policy Center 
found this bill would raise taxes on 
middle-class Americans by 30 percent. 
That doesn’t even factor in the hidden 
tax of inflation that is over 6 percent 
now. 
This tax scheme will also destroy up 
to 1 million U.S. jobs. 
Just like millionaires and billion-
aires, China benefits from this bill, 
thanks to a ban on domestic mineral 
production and policies that make it 
better for foreign businesses to manu-
facture outside the United States rath-
er than right here in America. 
Far-left news organizations also luck 
out with a new tax cut, while millions 
of illegal immigrants will be granted 
amnesty and will be eligible for $45,000 
a year in government benefits. 
Butterflies, freshwater mussels, and 
desert fish also receive millions of dol-
lars in this bill. There is also $2.5 bil-
lion for so-called tree equity. 
How about middle-class Americans? 
We already know that they will be pay-
ing more in taxes and seeing fewer eco-
nomic opportunities. But, surely, there 
is something in this bill for them. 
Well, for starters, Democrats are hir-
ing 87,000 new IRS agents to spy on 
their bank accounts. Their proposal 
will double the chance of being au-
dited, with nearly half of all audits hit-
ting families making less than $75,000 a 
year. 
The 
Democrats 
are 
also 
imple-
menting 
Big 
Government 
socialist 
price control schemes on prescription 
drugs, meaning that fewer cures and 
fewer treatments will be available for 
seniors and patients. 
Also, thanks to a natural gas tax and 
more than $550 billion spent on Green 
New Deal policies, Americans can ex-
pect to pay higher prices for home 
heating costs, electricity rates, and gas 
prices. Keep in mind that heating bills 
are already expected to be up as much 
as 54 percent for some American house-
holds this winter. 
So if President Biden’s words are 
true and a budget is demonstrative of 
values, then it is very clear what my 
friends across the aisle value, and that 
is millionaires and billionaires, illegal 
immigrants, bugs and fish, and even 
this concept of tree equity. 
Those 
are 
the 
values 
that 
are 
prioritized in this budget over the con-
cerns and needs of everyday Ameri-
cans, working-class and middle-class 
families. 
The Democrats’ Big Government so-
cialist spending scam is full of far-left 
priorities and will further fuel the 
highest inflation and the highest spike 
in prices that we have seen in four dec-
ades. Sadly, it is going to be American 
workers, job creators, and families who 
will be forced to foot this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the

U.S. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure 
and social spending legislation will not add 
to inflationary pressures in the U.S. econ-
omy, economists and analysts in leading rat-
ing agencies told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Biden has spent the past few months pro-
moting the merits of both pieces of legisla-

plan and a separate $1 trillion infrastructure 
plan. read more 
The two pieces of legislation ‘‘should not 
have any real material impact on inflation’’, 
William Foster, vice president and senior 
credit officer (Sovereign Risk) at Moody’s 
Investors Service, told Reuters. 
The impact of the spending packages on 
the fiscal deficit will be rather small because 
they will be spread over a relatively long 
time horizon, Foster added. 
Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, 
has previously raised inflationary concerns 
in relation to Biden’s social spending plan, 
with a report earlier this month suggesting 
he may delay the passage of the Build Back 
Better legislation. read more 
‘‘The bills do not add to inflation pres-
sures, as the policies help to lift long-term 
economic growth via stronger productivity 
and labor force growth, and thus take the 
edge off of inflation,’’ said Mark Zandi, chief 
economist at Moody’s Analytics, which oper-
ates independently from the parent com-
pany’s ratings business. 
Zandi said the costs of both the infrastruc-
ture and social spending legislation were sus-
tainable. 
‘‘The bills are largely paid for through 
higher taxes on multinational corporations 
and well-to-do households, and more than 
paid for if the benefit of the added growth 
and the resulting impact on the govern-
ment’s fiscal situation are considered’’, he 
said in an interview. 
Charles Seville, senior director and Amer-
icas sovereigns co-head at Fitch Ratings, 
said the two pieces of legislation ‘‘will nei-
ther boost nor quell inflation much in the 
short-run.’’ 
Government spending will still add less to 
demand in 2022 than in 2021 and over the 
longer-run, the social spending legislation 
could increase labor supply through provi-
sions such as childcare, and productivity, Se-
ville told Reuters. 
The House of Representatives passed the $1 
trillion infrastructure package earlier this 
month after the Senate approved it in Au-
gust. Biden signed the bill into law on Mon-
day. 
The Build Back Better package includes 
provisions 
on 
childcare 
and 
preschool, 
eldercare, healthcare, prescription drug pric-
ing and immigration. 
‘‘The deficit will still narrow in FY 2022 as 
pandemic relief spending drops out and the 
economic recovery boosts tax revenues’’, Se-
ville said. ‘‘But the legislation (Build Back 
Better) does not sustainably fund all the ini-
tiatives, particularly if these are extended 
and don’t sunset, meaning that they will be 
funded by greater borrowing.’’ 
The Congressional Budget Office antici-
pates publishing a complete cost estimate 
for the Build Back Better plan by Friday, 
Nov. 19. Biden said on Tuesday he expected 
the Build Back Better legislation to be 
passed within a week’s time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
just yesterday, economists and ana-
lysts made clear that the Build Back 
Better bill would not add to infla-
tionary pressures. Let me remind those 
on the other side that there are provi-
sions in this legislation to bolster our 
supply chains. 
If we want to talk about values, our 
values are that we want to lower the 
cost of prescription drugs for our sen-
ior citizens. Our values are that we 
think it is outrageous that drug com-
panies charge so much for insulin, a 
drug that has been around forever, yet 
families are being gouged by these drug 
companies. There is a provision in this 
bill that caps insulin costs at just $35 a 
month. Those are our values. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
NEGUSE), a distinguished member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, with 
all the respect in the world to my col-
league from Pennsylvania, to the ex-
tent he wants to talk about Joe Biden’s 
America, let’s stick to the facts. 
In Joe Biden’s America, wage growth 
is up, and unemployment is down. In 
Joe Biden’s America, family income is 
up, and prescription drug pricing is 
poised to go down. 
That is why I am excited to be here 
today, Madam Speaker, to support the 
Build Back Better Act and speak in 
support of this transformative, historic 
legislation that will inure to the ben-
efit of each and every American. 
There is a lot to be proud of in this 
bill, such as the tax cuts for working 
families that it will deliver, the jobs 
that it will create, and the costs for 
working families that it will lower. 
But for me, personally, the part that 
I am most enthused and excited about 
is universal pre-K because, as the 
Speaker knows, I am a father. I have a 
young 3-year-old daughter who started 
preschool this year. There is nothing 
that can bring a smile to my face more 
than seeing my daughter after a day at 
preschool, seeing how much she has en-
joyed it and how much she has learned. 
We are lucky to be able to send her to 
school, but many families in Colorado 
and across the country are not. 
Thanks to President Biden’s vision, 
universal pre-K for every 3-year-old 
and 4-year-old in the United States of 
America will be a reality. 
So let’s pass this bill. Let’s send it to 
the Senate. Let’s get it across the fin-
ish line. And let’s deliver for the Amer-
ican people. 
b 1815 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to cite 
something. While campaigning for the 
White House last year, President Biden 
repeatedly, repeatedly stressed that he 
would not directly raise taxes on indi-
viduals making below $400,000. 
Information in an analysis by the 
Joint Committee on Taxation released 
Tuesday showed that the House version 
of President Biden’s bill will start rais-
ing taxes as early as 2023 on middle- 
class families. 
Additionally, 
tax 
increases 
fall 
heaviest on the lower and middle class, 
while the super-wealthy receive a gen-
erous tax cut until at least 2025. 
I know my good friend from Colorado 
was talking about wages increasing. 
What is not being considered is that if 
wages are not increasing at the amount 
of inflation, people are actually having 
less purchasing power. So unless your 
wages have increased by 6.2 percent, 
your money earned is actually not 
what it was just a month or two or 
three ago. 
So, yes, wages may be rising, but 
they are not keeping pace with infla-
tion, so everyday Americans are paying 
what economists call the invisible tax 
of inflation, which hurts working-class 
and middle-class families the most, 
particularly when you look at the 
amount they have to pay for gas prices, 
which are at a 7-year high. By the way, 
the last time gas prices were this high, 
President Biden was again in the White 
House. 
Additionally, something to consider, 
the budget resolution has three com-
mittees that are well over the budget 
resolution amount, which I believe is 
going to cause a problem in the Senate. 
First, the Committee on Homeland 
Security was at $500 million in the 
budget resolution. It is almost three 
times that amount on the current CBO 
score. It is just under $1.5 billion. 
If you look at the Committee on the 
Judiciary, you had a budget resolution 
number of just about $108 billion. The 
CBO came back at $115 billion, just 
over $115 billion, with $369 billion from 
2032 to 2041. 
Then you have the Committee on 
Oversight, which is almost just as egre-
gious as Homeland Security’s number. 
It was in the budget resolution as $7.5 
billion. It is almost twice that, at $13.8 
billion. 
I am not the Senate Parliamen-
tarian, but from my understanding, 
this is going to cause significant issues 
at the Senate. 
But, Madam Speaker, I just want to 
talk about the previous question. If we 
defeat the previous question, I will 
offer personally an amendment to the 
rule to strike provisions in this bill al-
lowing millions of illegal immigrants 
to live and work in the United States 
indefinitely and setting them on the 
path toward citizenship. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD along with 
any extraneous material immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN), my good friend and the 
former ranking member of the Judici-
ary Committee to explain the amend-
ment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, in 10 
months we have gone from a secure 
border to complete chaos. We don’t 
have a border anymore. We don’t. We 
now have what Secretary Clinton said 
she wanted when she ran for President 
5 years ago. We have a borderless hemi-
sphere. 
You don’t believe it? Just look at the 
numbers. March was the highest month 
on record for illegal crossings at our 
southern border, the highest month on 
record until April, and then April was 
the highest month on record until May,

November 18, 2021 
and then May was the highest month 
on record until June. June was the 
highest month on record until July, 
when there were 212,000 illegal encoun-
ters on our southern border. 
This past month it went all the way 
down to 164,000. 1.7 million this year 
alone. A record. 
And guess what? Thousands more in 
a caravan are on their way. And all the 
terrible things that happen in these 
caravans are there because of the poli-
cies of the Biden administration and 
the Democrats who control the Federal 
Government. 
But don’t worry. Don’t worry. Sec-
retary Mayorkas said this, ‘‘The border 
is closed. The border is secure.’’ If the 
effects and what happens to kids and 
families on these treks wasn’t so seri-
ous, if it wasn’t so bad, you would al-
most have to laugh because there is no 
way anyone can describe the border as 
closed and the border as secure. 
In this big spending bill, this $2 tril-
lion monstrosity, what is the Demo-
crats’ response to that chaotic situa-
tion on our border? 
Amnesty for over 6 million people 
who are in our country illegally. Think 
about that. That is their response. 
Oh, and don’t forget—don’t forget 
what the Justice Department is getting 
ready to do. When they are not spying 
on parents, when they are not treating 
parents as a domestic terrorist threat, 
our Justice Department is getting 
ready to pay people who illegally en-
tered our country $450,000. I mean, you 
can’t make this stuff up. It is why peo-
ple all across this country are just 
throwing their hands up. What is going 
on? 
The cost of the immigration policies 
in this legislation are almost half a 
trillion dollars over the next 20 years. 
Half a trillion dollars. But, again, don’t 
worry, Joe Biden says that half a tril-
lion dollars in spending on immigra-
tion policies and all the other spending 
in this bill is going to help the infla-
tion problem. 
There is not a rational, sane person 
on the planet who believes that. And 
why the President of the United States 
would make such a statement is be-
yond me. 
Record high inflation. The highest we 
have had in 31 years, and Joe Biden 
says spending half a trillion over 20 
years on immigration policies in this 
legislation and all the other spending 
is going to lower inflation. 
Let’s defeat the previous question. 
When it comes up, let’s defeat the rule. 
And for goodness’ sake, I hope we will 
vote down this bill, which is only going 
to exacerbate the already terrible situ-
ation we have seen. Every single policy 
that has come from the Biden adminis-
tration and the Democrat-controlled 
Congress has been harmful to Amer-
ican families. 
We have gone, as I said, from a secure 
border to chaos. We have gone from en-
ergy independence to the spectacle of 
the President of the United States beg-
ging OPEC to increase production. We 
went from relatively safe cities to 
crime going up in every major urban 
area in this country, and we went from 
stable prices to a 31-year high in infla-
tion. 
You want to buy a home? It is going 
to cost more. 
You want to rent an apartment? It is 
going to cost more. 
Put food on the table? It is going to 
cost more. 
Put gas in your car? It is going to 
cost more. 
Thanksgiving turkey is going to cost 
more. Christmas presents for your fam-
ily are going to cost more in Joe 
Biden’s America. 
This bill is so bad. Vote down the 
previous question, vote down the rule, 
vote down this bill for the good of the 
families of this great Nation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, I 
think what is on display here really is 
the difference between Democrats and 
Republicans. 
I mean, this Build Back Better bill is 
about our values and about what we 
are for, about solving problems. And 
what we hear from our Republican 
friends is hate and vitriol, blaming Joe 
Biden for everything. It is a cloudy day 
out; it is Joe Biden’s fault. I mean, ev-
erything. But no solutions, nothing 
that they are for. 
We passed a historic infrastructure 
bill 2 weeks ago. It is going to help re-
build our country. The overwhelming 
majority of my Republican friends 
voted against it, and the few that voted 
for it are now under attack by the Re-
publican 
leadership 
and 
are 
being 
threatened with losing their committee 
assignments. I mean, that is their re-
sponse to our infrastructure chal-
lenges. 
When the previous President, Mr. 
Trump, was in office, we had infra-
structure week, infrastructure month, 
infrastructure press release, but no in-
frastructure money. Thankfully, be-
cause of the leadership of this Presi-
dent, and Members of this Congress 
who voted for it, we have an infrastruc-
ture bill. 
When you talk about policies that 
they are against, I mean, really, you 
are against the extension of the child 
tax credit, which has decreased child 
poverty by almost 30 percent? 
Are you against increasing the Pell 
grants and against investing in afford-
able housing? 
Are you against dealing with the cli-
mate crisis? 
Are you against, you know, the uni-
versal free pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4- 
year-olds? 
Are 
you 
against 
expanding 
the 
earned income tax credit? 
Are you against making historic in-
vestments in historically Black col-
leges and universities? 
I mean, I can go on and on and on. 
But these are the things we are for. 
What you hear from the other side is 
what they are against. 
I think the American people think it 
is more important for us to tell them 
what we are for. And what this bill is 
about is about being on the side of 
those who struggle in this country 
every day. 
And, by the way, there are invest-
ments in this bill to deal with our sup-
ply chain issues, which can also help 
with inflation, but I guess they are 
against that, too. 
I now yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY), the distinguished chair of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for his 
strong and important leadership on 
this historic bill. 
I rise in strong support of the Build 
Back Better Act and thank the Demo-
cratic leadership for their historic in-
vestment into the American lives and 
the lives of their families. 
We have no future if we don’t get se-
rious about combating climate change, 
and this bill is transformative in this 
area and so many other areas. 
The 
Oversight 
Committee’s 
title 
would make the Federal Government a 
leader on combating climate change by 
electrifying the Federal Government’s 
vehicle fleet. Our title includes nearly 
$3 billion for GSA and $6 billion for the 
Postal Service to purchase tens of 
thousands of electric vehicles and build 
the infrastructure necessary to support 
them. 
Electric vehicles are a sensible and 
cost-effective investment that will re-
duce emissions and help save our plan-
et. 
The title also includes $4 billion for 
GSA to expand the use of emerging 
green technologies and to green Fed-
eral buildings. 
I am especially pleased that we have 
included dedicated funding for OMB to 
track labor equity and environmental 
standards and performance. 
It is critical that the House pass this 
bill as quickly as possible. Congratula-
tions to everyone who is supporting 
this critically important bill. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, we are all here to 
represent our constituents, and I don’t 
think it is a coincidence that House 
Democrats represent all but one of the 
25 districts that benefit from the SALT 
tax provision. That includes Speaker 
PELOSI’s own district. What this is, it 
is a tax break for millionaires and bil-
lionaires. 
Let’s just look at the tax con-
sequences of this bill. Analysis by the 
nonprofit Tax Foundation found, ‘‘Over 
96 percent of districts across the 
United States would eventually see a 
tax increase’’ because of President 
Biden’s and House Democrats’ social-
ist, Big Government spending spree. 
Ninety-six percent of districts will 
have higher taxes because of that. This 
hurts the working and middle class.

November 18, 2021 
Even the left-leaning Tax Policy Cen-
ter found that President Biden’s and 
Speaker PELOSI’s spending spree would 
raise taxes on middle-class Americans 
by 30 percent. That is 30 percent that 
you have to take into account when 
you have inflation at over 6 percent. In 
essence, it is a 36 percent-plus tax in-
crease on middle-class families and 
working families. 
This bill, though, delivers tax cuts to 
some people, and that is two-thirds of 
the country’s millionaires. Two-thirds 
of the millionaires in the United States 
under this bill actually receive a tax 
cut. 
Small businesses also get hurt. They 
don’t get favored like millionaires and 
billionaires. This includes $400 billion 
in small business tax hikes, which 
some argue would take the effective 
tax rate of small businesses in excess of 
57 percent. 
Additionally, this bill hires 87,000 
new IRS agents that are going to be 
used to increase audits on everyday, 
working Americans. Nearly half of 
those audits will impact families earn-
ing $75,000 a year or less. About one- 
quarter affected will be Americans who 
earn just $25,000 per year. This will 
damage the working and middle class 
severely. 
b 1830 
This isn’t just numbers. We can talk 
about tax rates all we want, but when 
Americans go to Thanksgiving Day 
dinner, they will pay more than ever. 
If you just look at how much Ameri-
cans are paying, steak is up 24 percent. 
Bacon is up over 20 percent; fish and 
seafood over 11 percent; eggs, 11.6 per-
cent. This will be the most expensive 
Thanksgiving Day dinner in the his-
tory of the United States, thanks to 
Joe Biden’s economy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), my good 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee said Republicans want to blame 
Joe Biden for everything. I am not 
blaming Joe Biden for everything; the 
American 
people 
are. 
Right-track, 
wrong-track polling says 71 percent of 
our fellow citizens think our country is 
on the wrong track. I am not blaming 
Joe Biden; they are, the people we rep-
resent. 
Approval rating is 38 percent, and the 
Vice President’s approval is 28 percent. 
In the history of polling for Vice Presi-
dent and President, I don’t know if I 
have ever seen anything that low. It is 
the American people who are fed up 
with what they see. 
The gentleman who chairs the Rules 
Committee said: What are they for? I 
will tell you what we are for. I will tell 
you what Republicans are for. I will 
tell you what the American people are 
for. We are actually for a secure bor-
der. Imagine that. 
We are for lower prices. 
We actually would like to have real 
wages be going up like they were under 
President Trump. 
We would like to have a secure bor-
der 
like 
we 
had 
under 
President 
Trump. 
We would actually like less crime in 
our urban areas like we had under 
President Trump. 
We would like to be energy inde-
pendent like we were just 10 months 
ago. We would kind of like not to have 
the spectacle of the President of the 
United States begging OPEC to in-
crease production at the same time 
your policies in this bill would discour-
age American companies from increas-
ing production. What do you guys 
want, $8 a gallon gasoline? 
I will tell you what we are for. We 
are for a Department of Justice that 
doesn’t target parents, doesn’t target 
moms and dads for standing up and 
saying we don’t want this racist cur-
riculum, 
anti-American 
curriculum, 
taught to our kids. 
I will tell you what we are for. We 
are actually for not raising taxes on 
American families. That is what we are 
for. That is what American families 
want. They like to keep the money 
they earn, be able to put gas in their 
car, buy Christmas presents for their 
family, afford the things that just 10 
months ago they could. Ten months 
ago, it was so much different. That is 
what we are for. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I don’t even know how to respond to 
all of that. I would just say to my 
friends that the American people had 
what they had to offer. When they were 
in the majority, we had 4 years of Don-
ald Trump, and guess what? They voted 
for Joe Biden and gave him a victory 
by millions and millions and millions 
and millions of votes. So, I don’t think 
they want what they were selling. 
I just also say to my friends who are 
trying to lecture us on tax policy, my 
Republican friends can’t be serious 
here. You added $2 trillion to the def-
icit to give tax breaks to millionaires 
and billionaires and corporations at 
the expense of everyone else. It was 
shameful. It was shameful what my 
friends did. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. TAKANO), the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs con-
tribution to the Build Back Better Act 
of 2021. 
The committee has an important re-
sponsibility to advance measures that 
support veterans and honor their serv-
ice and sacrifice, as well as that of 
their families, caregivers, and sur-
vivors. 
Last week, we celebrated Veterans 
Day. The Build Back Better Act is the 
perfect way to continue to show our 
gratitude with concrete, meaningful in-
vestment for all veterans. 
By making this critical investment 
at the VA, we can start rebuilding VA’s 
capacity in terms of brick-and-mortar 
infrastructure, human capital, and sup-
port structures that serve our Nation’s 
veterans. 
Now, I have a difficult time believing 
my colleagues across the aisle think 
that veterans are unworthy of this in-
vestment. The fact is, veterans from 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Beaufort, 
South Carolina, and from Columbia, 
Missouri, to Clarksville, Tennessee, are 
among the districts that stand to gain 
directly from these resources. 
The most important piece of this leg-
islation is the $1.8 billion for medical 
facility leases that fixes a longstanding 
backlog of lease authorizations. Take a 
look at VA’s budget book, at the leases 
that are on that list. You will see it 
largely benefits Republican districts. 
Do my Republican colleagues not want 
VA facilities and clinics in their dis-
tricts? I don’t believe that for one mo-
ment. I know that they will attend the 
ribbon-cutting 
ceremonies, 
though, 
when this bill is passed into law and 
issue press releases when these facili-
ties are open. 
Voting against this legislation would 
not only mean turning our backs on 
our most sacred promise to our Na-
tion’s veterans, but it would be a strik-
ing departure for many of my Repub-
lican colleagues who have long advo-
cated for these investments. 
As demand for care and services at 
VA continue to grow, the lack of pur-
poseful, usable clinic space will hurt 
veterans, including women veterans, 
because clinic spaces are not designed 
for 
them. 
A 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
healthcare providers will hurt veterans 
because we simply don’t have enough 
providers in this country. Making in-
vestments in the next generation of 
healthcare providers is just common 
sense. 
I will end by saying nearly three- 
fourths of the American people agree 
that it is time to update VA’s infra-
structure. The Build Back Better Act 
gives us the framework to do just that. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
My friend and colleague from Massa-
chusetts was talking about taxes. I will 
stand here and talk about taxes all day 
because, at the end of the night, the 
American people will see that the sec-
ond-biggest provision in this bill is ac-
tually a tax break to millionaires and 
billionaires. 
Facts are facts. If you look at it, the 
Committee for Responsible Federal 
Budgets found that the SALT tax 
carve-out would ‘‘be nearly 50 times as 
large as the benefit of the expanded 
child tax credits for a typical family 
over 5 years.’’ 
SALT gives tax breaks to million-
aires and billionaires in blue States. 
Who pays for that? Working families 
all over the United States.

November 18, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. This is 
our moment. Now is the time to deal 
the working people back in. 
We need to prove to the people that 
the government works for them, not 
just for those on top. 
Build Back Better lowers family 
healthcare costs by strengthening the 
ACA, capping the price on insulin, add-
ing in hearing benefits for Medicare, 
and much more. 
This bill would be transformative for 
American families. With the child tax 
credit, childcare, and affordable, high- 
quality preschool, our Nation will fi-
nally invest in our children. 
We must address the climate crisis, 
and we can’t leave any community be-
hind. Our health, our culture, and our 
economy depend on it. 
We cannot wait another day to build 
back better for the working families of 
America. Let’s start now. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
One thing we need to address here 
also is the tax on natural gas. This will 
increase nearly everything everyday 
Americans buy. 
We already know that there are pro-
jections that people will be paying 
more than ever this winter to heat 
their homes, almost a 50 percent in-
crease in some places. 
If you look at the fees in this bill, the 
taxes, a $900 methane fee phases into 
$1,500 in production per metric ton. 
That just sounds like numbers, but 
think about it. If we are taxing natural 
gas, we are taxing Americans who use 
natural gas to heat their homes. We 
are taxing the industries that use pe-
trochemicals to manufacture everyday 
products that we use and manufacture 
here in the United States. And con-
sumers end up paying that tax, as well. 
We are also making it more expen-
sive to manufacture here in the United 
States because as you tax natural gas, 
it costs more to manufacture goods 
here at home. Again, the American 
consumer will end up paying this tax. 
These taxes on natural gas will do 
nothing more than make it harder for 
Americans to heat their homes. It will 
make it more expensive for us to man-
ufacture products, to pay for petro-
chemicals. It will make it harder for us 
to actually rebuild the economy. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I am so 
proud to have played a leading role in 
securing 
high-quality, 
affordable 
childcare for every family in America 
in the Build Back Better Act. 
This policy is personal for me. Grow-
ing up, I was raised by a single mom 
who had to work multiple jobs just to 
make ends meet. She got help raising 
me from my grandparents. My grand-
mother 
cleaned 
homes, 
and 
when 
daycare was too expensive, she had to 
take me to work with her. 
Madam Speaker, no family in Amer-
ica, no child in America, should have 
to accompany their guardian to work 
because childcare is too expensive, cer-
tainly not in the richest nation in the 
history of the world. That is why we 
are investing nearly $400 billion in 
childcare and early learning programs 
to ensure that we solve this afford-
ability crisis. 
The childcare provisions will trans-
form our childcare system and help 
bring unemployed parents back into 
the workforce without them being fi-
nancially burdened. 
For these reasons and so many more, 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this historic legislation. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, this monstrosity of 
a bill is the most progressive and ex-
pensive piece of legislation in our Na-
tion’s history. It will fundamentally 
alter the course of our great Nation by 
codifying the far left’s dangerous poli-
cies, such as components of the Green 
New Deal, taxpayer-funded abortion, 
and the weaponization of the IRS. 
In fulfilling the far left’s wish list, 
this bankrupts America. And it does 
so, Madam Speaker, all while Ameri-
cans are reeling from record-high rates 
of inflation that are crippling their 
pocketbooks, emptying shelves at the 
supermarket, 
and 
making 
gasoline 
prices skyrocket. 
This compounded with the fact that 
the Biden administration refuses to ad-
dress the myriad of crises plaguing 
Americans across the country, I am 
convinced that my counterparts on the 
other side of the aisle have no desire to 
set America up to succeed, nor are they 
interested in embracing the freedoms 
that we know and love, the very free-
doms that serve as the foundational 
underpinnings of our great democracy. 
No, this bill moves us not just one 
step toward socialism, it propels us 
into Big Government socialism. That is 
because this bill provides: 
Universal preschool childcare from 
birth to the tune of nearly $400 billion, 
both of which are great opportunities 
for Washington-controlled curriculums 
and bureaucrats to indoctrinate our 
children in the most developmental of 
years. 
$80 billion to double the size of the 
Internal 
Revenue 
Service, 
further 
weaponizing the agency and targeting 
hardworking American taxpayers. That 
should frighten every one of us. 
$100 billion to establish a backdoor 
amnesty program that will give 5-year 
renewable visas to millions of individ-
uals illegally residing in the United 
States. 
The child tax credit to those who 
enter the United States illegally by 
dropping the current law requirement 
for a Social Security number. 
$550 billion for the Green New Deal, 
including billions for a new climate 
green bank, environmental and climate 
justice grants, and the United States 
Postal Service to convert to an electric 
vehicle fleet. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman. 
Mr. CLYDE. And $12.5 billion for tree 
equity and radical environmental jus-
tice initiatives. 
That is right, this bill leaves us 
knocking on the door of Big Govern-
ment socialism. 
My constituents sent me to Wash-
ington, D.C., to protect and secure 
their freedoms and to put Americans 
first, not last, and I look forward to 
voting ‘‘no’’ on this travesty of a bill. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
also vote ‘‘no’’ on this Big Government 
socialism bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. STANSBURY). 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I 
want to take a moment this evening to 
dedicate my remarks to my dear 
friends Jon Baran, Caitie Padilla, and 
their beautiful daughter, Sophie. 
This week, we celebrated the signing 
of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
Now, it is time to pass the other half of 
the President’s agenda to ensure that 
our families and our communities can 
build a brighter, more just, more equi-
table, and more sustainable future. 
As a proud daughter of New Mexico, 
I represent the strong, beautiful, resil-
ient people of New Mexico’s First Con-
gressional District. Over the pandemic, 
we have used every ounce of our grit, 
our determination, and our heart to 
get by. Yet, so many families are still 
struggling. 
That is why we must pass the Build 
Back Better Act and why it is a must- 
pass bill for New Mexico. 
We must invest in healthcare and 
community well-being. We must invest 
in universal pre-K. We must invest in 
childcare and caring for our elders. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, 
we must invest in addressing global cli-
mate change because that is our 
charge. Our communities are counting 
on us, and that is why we must deliver 
this bill tonight.

November 18, 2021 
schemes for prescription drugs that 
will actually negatively impact seniors 
and negatively impact patients and 
those who have rare diseases in their 
families. 
There seems to be a fundamental 
misunderstanding about this industry. 
On average, it costs $2.6 billion to take 
a drug to market. We, for whatever 
reason, focus on the cost per each dose. 
By the way, petrochemicals are used to 
make our pharmaceuticals, which this 
bill also taxes, as I said before. But 
there 
is 
a 
fundamental 
misunder-
standing in how drugs are produced. If 
we get these socialist price controls in 
this bill, it will actually kill our inno-
vation, or deincentivize any pharma-
ceutical company to actually reinvest 
and invest in new drugs and prescrip-
tions, which will actually harm those 
with rare diseases and make it harder 
for those that are suffering from men-
tal conditions to get the drugs they 
need. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
let’s be clear. My friends are saying 
that putting a cap on the cost of insu-
lin is somehow socialism or undercut-
ting the United States of America. 
Give me a break. Talk to parents 
whose children have diabetes and how 
they anguish over the costs and how 
they worry about how their children 
will be able to support the cost of their 
prescriptions once they become 26 and 
are 
no 
longer 
on 
their 
parents’ 
healthcare. 
So let’s get real. This is a debate 
about values. We are on the side of cap-
ping the cost of insulin so that diabetes 
patients aren’t gouged like they are 
now. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, Demo-
crats know that genuine recovery from 
this pandemic means more than re-
turning to the status quo ante. 
Earlier this week, we made long over-
due investments in our infrastructure. 
Now with the Build Back Better Act, 
we can expand healthcare coverage and 
lower costs. We can provide families 
with access to affordable childcare and 
universal preschool. We can reduce 
housing costs. We can cut taxes for 
working 
people 
while 
making 
the 
wealthiest pay their fair share; and we 
can make the grandest effort in Amer-
ican history towards combating cli-
mate change. 
How we choose to invest our re-
sources is a reflection of our values. 
The 
previous 
administration 
prioritized handing $2 trillion to bil-
lionaires and big corporations. 
Let us instead invest in American 
workers and families and pass this 
Build Back Better Act now. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Rules. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, for 
decades Congress has based economic 
policy on trickle-down economics, evis-
cerating America’s middle class in the 
process. But today, we reject that ap-
proach. The Build Back Better Act in-
vests in American families, not hedge 
funds, in ways that will benefit all of 
us. 
I would mention two investments of 
particular importance to my district in 
Pennsylvania: Children and veterans. 
This bill builds upon the American 
Rescue Plan that we passed in March 
to expand benefits for families and sup-
port for childcare. In doing so, it will 
reduce child poverty more and produce 
generational benefits to our country. 
The bill also makes long, overdue in-
vestments in the aging infrastructure 
of our Veterans Administration; in-
cluding upgrading medical facilities 
and finally digitizing service records 
that are required for veterans and their 
families to obtain the benefits our Na-
tion has promised to them. 
With this bill, we can create real, 
sustained economic growth that bene-
fits all Americans, and I am proud to 
support it. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would just note that this 
bill does not include the Hyde amend-
ment, which will allow taxpayer dol-
lars to be used to fund on-demand abor-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
in this season of giving, as we sit down 
to our Thanksgiving table, I hope the 
American people will know that we 
have handed them a gift over corporate 
greed that is insistent on raising the 
price of goods. We presented to them 
the Build Back Better Act. 
And for those naysayers who want to 
talk about inflation, Mark Zandi said, 
‘‘The bills do not add to inflation pres-
sures, as the policies help to lift long- 
term economic growth via stronger 
productivity and labor force growth,’’ 
that is from one of the renowned 
economists in this Nation. 
Madam Speaker, what I am fighting 
for is to make sure that Perla Rosalez 
in Texas has health insurance for the 
first time in decades. I remember that 
I cried when we were not able to give 
all of these uninsured persons insur-
ance. We are giving them health insur-
ance and we also—as chairwoman of 
the Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, Homeland Security, and Inves-
tigations—are giving community vio-
lence dollars to stop the violence. 
Madam Speaker, this is a bill we 
should pass. Support the Build Back 
Better bill for the American people. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, while I have tremendous re-
spect for my colleague from Texas, I do 
want to point out that according to 
Moody’s Analytics, consumer prices 
will rise 2.24 percent higher after the 
Biden infrastructure and the American 
Rescue Plan and the Build Back Better 
spending spree then in a Biden-free 
economy. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, Mr. MCGOVERN, for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, when I served in 
local government, I helped to write and 
pass 
14 
consecutive 
budgets. 
If 
I 
learned one thing from that process, it 
is that budgets are statements of val-
ues. When Republicans last used the 
budget reconciliation process, it was to 
pass a $2 trillion tax giveaway to the 
wealthy. Before that, they used it to 
rip healthcare away from more than 20 
million Americans. They stated their 
values loudly and clearly. 
Well, here are our values in this bill. 
We value working Americans, and are 
using reconciliation to cut their taxes; 
not the rich. We value American chil-
dren and parents, and are using rec-
onciliation 
drastically 
to 
lower 
childcare costs, provide paid family 
leave, and guarantee access to pre-
school. We value the health and well- 
being of the American people, and are 
using reconciliation to expand access 
to vital health services, especially our 
seniors. And we value our environment, 
and are using reconciliation to make 
the single largest investment in the 
fight against climate change in his-
tory. 
These are our values. This is how we 
build back a better America, not only 
for the rich and well-connected, but for 
all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of this important investment in our fu-
ture. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I think it should be noted 
that this bill actually impedes and 
bans domestic energy and mineral pro-
duction, which will actually increase 
our dependencies on resource suppliers, 
from OPEC, Russia, and China. I just 
think that should be noted. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
CAMMACK), my good friend and col-
league. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. RESCHENTHALER) for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to read a 
statement from one of my Democratic 
colleagues here today. 
‘‘Because of last-minute late-night 
changes to the latest version of the 
Build Back Better Act, two-thirds of 
millionaires would get a big tax cut for 
the next 5 years under the bill. That is 
one reason that I refuse to vote for the 
bill without time to review the changes 
made to it a little over a week ago. 
Now we know. The tax benefits to

November 18, 2021 
these millionaires over 5 years could be 
50 times as large as the benefit of the 
child tax credit for a typical low- or 
middle-income family. The bill spends 
more on tax breaks for millionaires 
than on childcare assistance, edu-
cation, seniors, and even more than all 
of 
the 
healthcare 
provisions 
com-
bined.’’ 
This is from one of our Democratic 
colleagues. If one of our Democratic 
colleague is stating this, then we know 
that there is bipartisan opposition to 
this bill, a bill that we know is going 
to kill every single American’s Amer-
ican Dream. This is a socialist night-
mare that we can simply not afford. 
One in 25 people in this country is 
here illegally, and this bill will create 
a pathway for amnesty and all of the 
social welfare programs that go with 
it. We cannot afford this. We cannot 
agree to bankrupt our children and our 
grandchildren because of a political 
agenda. It is unfair. It is not right. It is 
un-American. I urge all of my col-
leagues, consider your children, your 
grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, 10 years ago, I, my-
self, was homeless, and under this bill, 
had these programs been in place, I 
probably would have never been able to 
be standing here today because the 
American Dream is bankrupted under 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge every single 
one of my colleagues, think with your 
hearts and your heads rather than the 
political agenda that you have been 
tasked with executing. Vote for the 
American people. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, you have to love 
these Republicans. They get up and 
talk about everything but what is in 
this Build Back Better bill. When all 
else fails, they get out and they bash 
immigrants again, blame immigrants 
for everything. 
Having a tough time at work? Well, 
blame an immigrant. 
Having a problem with your mar-
riage? Well, blame immigrants. 
But the bottom line is, they come to 
the floor and they tell us what they are 
against but they don’t tell us what 
they are for. This bill includes an ex-
tension of the child tax credit, which 
has already reduced child poverty in 
this country by 30 percent. They are 
against that? We are for that. 
This bill actually caps the cost of in-
sulin to $35 a month. Talk to your con-
stituents who have to rely on insulin to 
save the lives of their children. I mean, 
really? You are against that? We are 
for that. 
We actually care about our children’s 
future. That is why there is money in 
here to deal with the climate crisis; 
while my friends deny that there is 
even a climate crisis to be concerned 
about. 
So give me a break. Give me a break. 
This is a statement of our values. This 
is what we are for. We don’t hear what 
they are for. All we hear is what they 
are against. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, headline: 
Democrats deliver for the American 
people again. Democrats deliver for 
Central Florida, again. Lowering pre-
scription drug prices and capping costs 
for seniors. Extending child tax credit 
payments. Paid family leave and lower 
childcare costs for Central Florida 
families. 
Providing nearly 1 million Floridians 
with an expansion of the ACA, boosting 
affordable housing, immigration re-
form, the largest effort to combat cli-
mate change in history. 
And unlike the GOP tax scam that 
busted the deficit by $400 billion and $4 
trillion in debt, we pay for ours with 
major corporations, and the wealthy 
paying their fair share. 
Madam Speaker, the Republicans are 
doing nothing but divide. The Demo-
crats are delivering for America. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, with record high in-
flation and gas prices, supply chain 
shortages, and what is going to be the 
most 
expensive 
Thanksgiving 
on 
record, Democrats should focus on ad-
dressing real economic crises that are 
facing real Americans and real Amer-
ican workers every day. But instead, 
this bill before us would actually dou-
ble lower- and middle-income earners 
chances of being audited. It would 
make it more expensive for them to 
heat their homes and fill their gas 
tanks, and it will actually drive busi-
nesses and jobs overseas; further dam-
aging our economy. 
Democrats are extending tax breaks 
in this bill, extending tax breaks for 
millionaires and billionaires and jam-
ming through far-left radical policies 
that will only drive prices higher and 
make our paychecks lower. 
If President Biden and congressional 
Democrats get their way, average 
Americans will be pinching pennies 
while our country’s coastal elites will 
be legally evading taxes and getting 
tax subsidies and tax breaks to put an-

Let us pray. 
O God our Father, we want to serve 
You as You desire. Lord, make us alert 
to the needs of those You seek to 
touch, providing us with opportunities 
to transform hurting people. 
Use our lawmakers to do Your will 
on Earth as You empower them to be 
ambassadors of reconciliation. Lord, 
give them such winsome dispositions 
that they will bless even those who are 
hard of heart and withered in spirit. 
May our legislators comfort those who 
are brought low by sorrow and lift 
those who are bowed by life’s burdens. 
Lord, during this season of Thanks-
giving, inspire each of us to be grateful 
every day. 
We pray in Your precious Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
NDAA, last night, the Senate began 
the process to debate, amend, and ulti-
mately pass our annual Defense spend-
ing bill. With Republican cooperation, 
we can adopt the motion to proceed 
and begin voting on amendments early 
today. 
Let me say it again. With Republican 
cooperation, we can adopt the motion 
to proceed and begin voting on amend-
ments today. We should work together 
and complete this important bill before 
the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Last night’s vote was overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan, so there is no reason 
we can’t come to an agreement very 
soon to begin debating amendments. 
And there is already one important 
amendment that I want to mention: re-
pealing the 2002 Iraq AUMF. This bi-
partisan measure was reported out of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee earlier this year, and I said 
months ago that the Senate should 
hold a vote on it. The NDAA is a log-
ical place to do so. 
The Iraq war has been over for over a 
decade. An authorization passed in 2002 
is no longer necessary for keeping 
Americans safe in 2021. It has been 
nearly 10 years since this particular 
authorization has been cited as a pri-
mary justification for a military oper-
ation, and there is a real danger to let-
ting these legal authorities persist in-
definitely. Repealing this AUMF will in 
no way hinder our national defense, 
nor will it impact our relationship with 
the people of Iraq. 
I want to thank Chairman MENENDEZ, 
Senator KAINE, Senator YOUNG, and 
every Republican and Democratic co-
sponsor of the bill for working to bring 
this issue to the floor. And in the com-
ing days, I hope we can come to an 
agreement 
on 
other 
commonsense 
amendments to strengthen the Defense 
bill so we can get it passed through the 
Senate as soon as possible. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Madam President, on Build Back Bet-
ter, now that President Biden has en-
acted his once-in-a-generation infra-
structure bill, Democrats are taking 
the next steps toward passing the rest 
of his Build Back Better plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8408 
November 18, 2021 
The last year and a half have been 
unlike any in modern U.S. history. We 
have had a once-in-a-century pan-
demic, followed by the worst economic 
crisis since the Great Depression. 
We have come a long way this year as 
we have lifted our country out of the 
depths of these crises, but the chal-
lenges, of course, aren’t over. 
Americans right now want us to 
lower costs for things like healthcare, 
prescription drugs, childcare. We have 
a responsibility to pass legislation that 
will cut costs and improve American 
lives. That is why we need to keep 
working on passing Build Back Better. 
We know that passing this critical leg-
islation will lower costs for some of the 
most basic and essential things in ev-
eryday life. And as economists from 
leading rating agencies said yesterday, 
Build Back Better will not add to the 
inflationary pressures in the U.S. econ-
omy. 
The childcare provision could alone 
save families thousands of dollars each 
year. 
Families, 
on 
average, 
spend 
$10,000 annually on childcare for each 
child under 4. A generation ago, this 
was unheard of. Build Back Better will 
dramatically lower costs for millions 
of families by providing the largest in-
vestment in childcare in American his-
tory. 
The same goes for prescription drugs. 
If you are one of the roughly 10 million 
Americans who relies on insulin to 
manage your diabetes, chances are you 
have been spending more and more as 
the cost of this once-affordable drug 
has skyrocketed. It is truly one of the 
perplexing and frustrating trends of 
the past two decades. 
Well, Build Back Better will make it 
so Americans with diabetes don’t pay 
more than $35 per month on insulin by 
enabling Medicare to directly nego-
tiate prices in Part B and Part D— 
again, lowering costs, improving the 
lives of millions of families. 
Examples go on and on of how people 
will have more money in their pocket 
given their expenses. 
Build Back Better cuts taxes for par-
ents raising kids. It makes pre-K uni-
versal for the first time ever. It will 
provide help for small businesses to in-
vest within the United States and hire 
American workers. 
And, ultimately, it is the best thing 
we can do to recapture that sunny 
American optimism that has been the 
key to our country’s success. Creating 
jobs, lowering costs, fighting inflation, 
keeping more money in people’s pock-
ets—these are things Americans want 
and what Americans need, and it is 
what BBB does. 
We are going to keep working on this 
important legislation until we get it 
done. 
NOMINATION OF DILAWAR SYED 
Madam President, now, on a much 
sadder note, Mr. Syed. 
The Republican fixation on blocking 
qualified, uncontroversial, and essen-
tial nominees to fill roles in the Biden 
administration has hit a new and 
shameful low. 
Yesterday, every single Republican 
on the Small Business Committee boy-
cotted a hearing that would have held 
a vote on Dilawar Syed’s nomination 
for the No. 2 spot at the Small Business 
Administration. 
If confirmed, Mr. Syed would be the 
highest ranking Muslim American in 
government. This is the fifth time—the 
fifth 
time—that 
Republicans 
have 
failed to show up to a committee hear-
ing for Mr. Syed. 
To date—to date—we have yet heard 
a single legitimate reason for their op-
position. At one point, some of my col-
leagues seemed to question Mr. Syed’s 
allegiance because of his affiliation 
with a Muslim voter education group. 
That is repugnant, and after those ob-
jections provoked fierce criticism, Re-
publicans came up with entirely new 
fabrications for their resistance. 
But at no point have Republicans ex-
plained why Mr. Syed is not qualified 
for the job. Frankly, they can’t be-
cause Mr. Syed is the definition of a 
qualified candidate. His nomination 
has been praised by hundreds of busi-
ness groups, including the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce, hardly a liberal 
crowd. 
It is shameful; it is unacceptable; it 
is ridiculous for Republicans to keep 
stalling on Mr. Syed’s nomination. He 
is eminently qualified to serve in the 
SBA. 
Why are Senate Republicans oppos-
ing Mr. Syed’s nomination? And let me 
ask this again because the question 
resonates. Why are Senate Republicans 
opposing Mr. Syed’s nomination? 
I ask my Republican colleagues to 
drop their resistance and allow this ex-
cellent and straightforward nominee to

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The minority leader is recognized. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Well, at long last 
the Senate will officially turn to the 
NDAA. Every day, world events remind 
us that America faces serious rolling 
threats. In too many cases President 
Biden’s decisions have actually made 
things worse, so our annual oppor-
tunity for the Senate to have its say is 
as important this year as it has ever 
been. 
Over in Russia, Putin is preparing to 
escalate military hostilities along the 
border with Ukraine, and he is using 
Europe’s reliance on natural gas to 
bully our friends. But President Biden 
actually removed obstacles to Putin’s 
brandnew pipeline that will further ex-
tend his leverage and further enrich his 
cronies. 
So I hope the Senate will consider an 
NDAA amendment to sanction this 
project and to provide additional lethal 
support to Ukraine. These initiatives 
have previously won bipartisan sup-
port, so I would hope Democrats would 
join Republicans in pushing back on 
Moscow. 
China is flaunting major military in-
novations, like hypersonic weapons 
systems, stepping up airspace intru-
sions over Taiwan, and blaming Amer-
ica for their bad behavior. But while 
President Biden and our colleagues 
like to talk a good game about China, 
they have yet to really walk the walk. 
President Biden’s budget request for 
our military and defense does not even 
keep pace with President Biden’s infla-
tion. 
In addition, while Russia openly 
threatens its neighbors and China 
builds up its conventional and nuclear 
forces, there are reports that Demo-
crats are considering unprecedented 
new constraints on America’s own nu-
clear options through a ‘‘no first use’’ 
or ‘‘sole purpose’’ policy. 
Our allies have strong concerns about 
this. I hope the Senate will use the 
NDAA process to demonstrate bipar-
tisan support for finally modernizing 
our nuclear triad. That is the bedrock 
of deterrence and our strongest defense 
against these serious threats. 
So, what about terrorism? 
Following President Biden’s Afghani-
stan disaster, we are facing new and 
growing threats there as well. The new 
Taliban government has made cabinet 
ministers out of terrorists whom the 
Obama-Biden administration let out of 
Guantanamo Bay. But the Biden-Harris 
administration still naively acted like 
these characters care one bit about 
international norms. 
That is why Republicans have an 
amendment to ensure that none of the 
funding for Afghanistan aid can flow to 
the Taliban. It is an indictment of 
President Biden’s policy that such an 
amendment is even necessary, but yet 
that is where we are. 
In the Middle East, Iranian-backed 
terrorists are rampaging from Yemen 
to Iraq to Syria. They are emboldened 
as our deterrence has eroded. Given the 
multiple attacks on U.S. forces and fa-
cilities, we are fortunate more Ameri-
cans haven’t been killed. It may only 
be a matter of time before we see U.S. 
casualties at the hands of Iranian- 
backed terrorists. 
However, in the wake of these grow-
ing threats, Democrats want to use the 
NDAA—a bill that should strengthen 
our national defense—as an occasion to 
weaken the authorities that support 
our military’s presence and operational 
flexibility by repealing the 2002 AUMF. 
I expect a robust debate about that. 
I am glad we will finally be able to 
have these debates and these votes. 
America needs a course correction, and 
the Senate needs to supply it.

ferent matter, American families are

November 18, 2021 
dealing with painful inflation every 
single day. They have been fighting 
this daily battle for months now. 
A few months ago, a grandfather 
raising four grandkids in Missouri told 
reporters he had to cancel summer 
camp for his 8-year-old and his 6-year- 
old in order to keep affording diapers 
for their twin younger brothers. 
One Maryland woman told the local 
news she had gone to the grocery store 
to buy meat for her family, but was 
turned away by the pricetag and had to 
leave with a $2 loaf of bread instead. 
One man in Massachusetts, who cares 
for his elderly mother, told reporters 
that his 94-year-old mom needs the 
house kept warm, so they are getting 
absolutely crushed—crushed—by run-
away heating costs. Here’s what he had 
to say about it: 
Before, you’d go to the store, and if you 
had a $100, you could buy four bags of gro-
ceries and be happy. Now you are lucky to 
get a bag. Milk, orange juice, eggs. Plus the 
oil for the house, the water bills. It’s just 
crazy. It’s so much money. How is someone 
supposed to survive? 
This persistent and painful inflation 
has been directly fueled by the reckless 
spending spree that Democrats rammed 
through in March. Even if Washington 
Democrats didn’t inflict more new 
damage, economists still say ‘‘we’re 
going to see inflation get worse before 
it gets better.’’ 
The Democratic leader said on March 
12: ‘‘I do not think the dangers of infla-
tion, at least in the near-term, are very 
real.’’ 
He was catastrophically wrong. And 
these same people want yet another 
multitrillion-dollar bite at the apple. 
Look, American families know the 
spending part of Democrats’ reckless 
tax-and-spending spree would spell dis-
aster. Sixty-seven percent just told a 
survey that Washington should cut 
back on printing and spending because 
of inflation and rising costs. 
And then there is the taxing part of 
their 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree. The bill that Democrats are 
writing behind closed doors would hike 
taxes on the American people by an es-
timated $1.5 trillion—a trillion and a 
half dollars in tax increases. 
Democrats have already turned a 
strong economy into a shaky economy. 
Now they want to add the biggest tax 
hikes in a generation. A huge chunk of 
that is hundreds of billions of dollars 
for tax hikes on American industries 
and employers, because the Biden ad-
ministration has become enamored 
with a global scheme where countries 
around the world supposedly all agree 
to hike their tax rates together. 
This is an awful idea. Remember, in 
2019, Republican policies had set up the 
best economy for working Americans 
in a generation. This is in large part 
because we just cut taxes substan-
tially. We made America a more at-
tractive place to do business. 
So President Biden wants to do just 
the opposite of that: thrust America 
into some kind of global noncompete 
agreement. We are supposed to promise 
Europe and Asia that we won’t make 
America an especially attractive place 
to bring jobs and prosperity. 
Let me say that again. We are in the 
process of promising Europe and Asia 
that we won’t make America an espe-
cially attractive place to bring jobs 
and prosperity. 
Look, it gets worse. President Biden 
and Secretary Yellen want America to 
leap over the cliff first, tax the heck 
out of American industries while we 
just wait and see if our competitors ac-
tually follow suit. 
Well, you better believe China would 
be just thrilled to see the Democrats’ 
bill drain hundreds of billions of dol-
lars out of our own private sector as a 
symbolic gesture to the rest of the 
world. 
Democrats’ tax policies are just like 
their energy policies. They won’t build 
back better. They will build back Bei-
jing. They won’t build back better. 
They will build back Beijing. 
This is just one part of a $1.5 trillion 
job-killing tax hike. There are all 
kinds of tax increases that would hit 
major employers, Main Street small 
businesses, 
and 
American 
families. 
Nonpartisan experts have confirmed 
the Democrats’ bill would completely 
break the President’s promise not to 
raise ‘‘a single penny more,’’ he said, in 
taxes on middle-class households. 
They even want to send tens of bil-
lions in extra funding to the IRS so 
they can hire an army of new agents to 
snoop and audit their way across the 
country. But less than 3 percent of the 
huge IRS windfall would fund better 
customer service for taxpayers. 
Finally, in the midst of all these tax 
hikes, Democrats from New York, New 
Jersey, and California have managed to 
include—listen to this—a massive tax 
cut for wealthy people who choose to 
reside in high-tax blue States. This bo-
nanza for blue State millionaires and 
billionaires would cost almost $300 bil-
lion on its own. 
Even the Washington Post could only 
marvel at the audacity of this. Here’s 
their headline: ‘‘The second-biggest 
program in the Democrats’ spending 
plan gives billions to the rich.’’ That is 
the Washington Post’s assessment of 
it. 
In fact, even though Democrats want 
to hike taxes by $1.5 trillion, their bill 
still manages to give a net tax cut to 89 
percent of people making between 
$500,000 and $1 million, and 69 percent 
of households making over $1 million. 
This bears repeating. Even though 
Democrats want to hike taxes by $1.5 
trillion, their bill still manages to give 
a net tax cut to 89 percent of people 
making between $500,000 and $1 million, 
and 69 percent of households making 
over $1 million. 
All of this is a huge blow to Amer-
ican competitiveness: job-killing tax 
hikes. But Democrats make sure to 
look out for the ultrawealthy out on 
the coasts. A supermajority of them 
get tax cuts. I am almost impressed 
our colleagues have found a way to be 
this out of touch. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Biden border crisis continues to rage. 
Last month, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection encountered 164,303 individ-
uals attempting to illegally cross our 
southern border. That is more than 
twice the number of encounters Cus-
toms and Border Protection had the 
previous October and the highest Octo-
ber number ever recorded by Customs 
and Border Protection. In all, more 
than 1.7 million migrants were appre-
hended attempting to cross our south-
ern border in fiscal year 2021—the high-
est number ever. 
We are in the midst of a very serious 
crisis, and the response from Demo-
crats and the administration? Well, 
mostly crickets. Democrats seem to 
hope that ignoring the border situation 
will make it go away or at least ensure 
that no one pays attention. I am pretty 
sure the President and his administra-
tion spent more time earlier this year 
fighting against the use of the word 
‘‘crisis’’ to describe the situation at 
the border than they did actually 
thinking about how they might deal 
with the influx. Apparently, the admin-
istration is still—still—trying to avoid 
the ‘‘crisis’’ label judging by a recent 
hearing wherein the President’s nomi-
nee to head Customs and Border Pro-
tection seemed to carefully avoid refer-
ring to the situation at the border as a 
‘‘crisis.’’ 
If the highest number of border en-
counters ever recorded isn’t a crisis, I 
am not sure what is. The situation at 
our southern border is out of control. It 
is a security crisis, it is a manpower 
and enforcement crisis, and it is a hu-
manitarian 
crisis—although, 
again, 
you would never guess it from the 
Democrats’ behavior. 
Despite the fact that this crisis has 
been raging for the best part of a year 
now, Democrats and the administra-
tion have taken essentially no mean-
ingful action to address the situation, 
and that is not the worst of it. The 
Democrats’ policies are actually mak-
ing the situation worse. 
Among other things, the President 
has significantly limited the ability of 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
and Customs and Border Protection to 
enforce immigration laws, and arrests 
in the interior of the country dropped 
steeply under this administration. The 
Washington Post recently reported: 
Immigration arrests in the interior of the 
United States fell in fiscal 2021 to the lowest 
level in more than a decade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8410 
November 18, 2021 
The practical effect of the Presi-
dent’s immigration policies has been to 
encourage new waves of illegal immi-
gration. It is hardly surprising. If you 
think that your chances of staying in 
the United States are good, even if you 
are here illegally, you are likely much 
more inclined to undertake the journey 
in the first place. 
The 
administration’s 
actions—or 
lack thereof—have been compounded 
by the actions of Democrats in Con-
gress who have been doing their best to 
guarantee widespread amnesty. Demo-
crats have repeatedly attempted to in-
clude some form of amnesty in their 
tax-and-spending 
spree. 
While 
they 
have been partially foiled by the rul-
ings of the Senate Parliamentarian, 
the latest version of their bill still con-
tains provisions to grant de facto am-
nesty to many illegal immigrants. 
Their 
spending 
spree 
also 
delib-
erately lacks restrictions on Federal 
funding going to individuals in the 
country illegally, which means that il-
legal immigrants could end up receiv-
ing the $3,000-per-year child allowance, 
housing vouchers, and more. One anal-
ysis suggests that illegal immigrants 
could collect $10.5 billion in child al-
lowance payments next year. 
I haven’t even mentioned reports 
that the Biden administration has ap-
parently been contemplating settling 
lawsuits brought by individuals, who 
came here illegally, with payments of 
up to $450,000 per person—$450,000. That 
is right. That is more than four times 
as much as the government gives to 
the families of soldiers killed in action 
and nine times—nine times—as much 
as the government gives to an indi-
vidual wrongly imprisoned for 1 year. 
The administration has suggested that 
payments will not actually be that 
high, but even a settlement half that 
size would dwarf the payments that we 
give to the families of fallen soldiers. 
Immigrants have helped make this 
country what it is today, and I am a 
strong supporter of legal immigration, 
including temporary worker visas, like 
H–2B visas, which help South Dakota 
employers and many others address 
hiring challenges, but, again, immigra-
tion has to be legal. Encouraging ille-
gal immigration, as the Democrats are 
doing, presents a serious security risk 
because it makes it easier for everyone 
from terrorists to drug traffickers to 
enter the country unidentified, to say 
nothing of drugs like fentanyl and 
other illegal items. 
Encouraging 
illegal 
immigration 
through lax immigration enforcement 
and amnesty also undermines respect 
for the rule of law. The area of immi-
gration should not be an exception to 
the principle that the law has to be fol-
lowed and respected. Yet that is basi-
cally what Democrats’ policies are say-
ing—that the law doesn’t matter when 
it comes to immigration. 
Finally, we need to get away from 
any idea that there is anything com-
passionate about policies that encour-
age individuals to come here illegally. 
Attempting to enter the country ille-
gally is fraught with danger, from nat-
ural perils like weather, disease, and 
exposure, to exploitation by smugglers 
and traffickers. Amnesty and lax en-
forcement policies encourage thou-
sands more individuals and families to 
expose themselves to the dangers of an 
illegal border crossing. 
President Biden and Democrats could 
help stem this crisis right now by mak-
ing it clear that immigration law will 
be enforced and that the only accept-
able way to enter the United States is 
to come here legally. Unfortunately, it 
seems much more likely that the Presi-
dent will continue to ignore this crisis 
and deemphasize immigration enforce-
ment while Democrats in Congress will 
continue to push for amnesty. It is a 
serious failure of responsibility on the 
President’s part and one that will con-
tinue to have serious and sometimes 
deadly consequences.

THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was 
158 years ago tomorrow that Abraham 
Lincoln delivered what I believe was 
the greatest speech ever uttered by an 
American. He had been asked to say ‘‘a 
few words’’ at the dedication at the 
Soldiers’ National Cemetery in Gettys-
burg, PA. 
Four months had passed since the 
great armies of the North and South 
had clashed on that hallowed ground. 
They had fought for 3 days in the sear-
ing July heat. When the slaughter fi-
nally ended, the battlefield lay covered 
with the bodies of 50,000 dead and 
wounded soldiers and officers. It was 
the bloodiest battle in the hellish Civil 
War. 
What good could come from butchery 
and sorrow? What great purpose had 
been worth such staggering loss? Those 
were the questions which Abraham 
Lincoln pondered on his train ride to 
answer in Gettysburg. 
He spoke for less than 3 minutes— 
just 272 words. In those 3 minutes, he 
redefined the war as not a battle for 
territory or property, but for human 
dignity and human equality. 
He gave us a profound, simple, new 
definition of democracy: ‘‘Government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people.’’ He said the fallen soldiers had 
done all they could do. They had given 
their ‘‘last full measure of devotion’’ to 
ensure democracy did not perish from 
this Earth. 
Now, Lincoln said, it was left to us, 
the living, to ‘‘advance their unfinished 
work’’—in his words, to salvage from 
all of that death a new birth of free-
dom. 
He said that our Civil War was test-
ing ‘‘whether a nation, conceived in 
liberty, and dedicated to the propo-
sition that all men are created equal 
. . . can long endure.’’ 
Can our democracy endure? It is a 
question that Lincoln pondered not 
just at Gettysburg but throughout his 
life. 
Twenty-five years before Gettysburg, 
he had considered that question in a 
speech at the Young Men’s Lyceum in 
Springfield, IL. He was a young lawyer 
and a newly elected State legislator, 
just 29 years old. 
It was a challenging time in America, 
as it is today. Anxiety was high fol-
lowing a stock market panic the pre-
vious year. There was growing violence 
in America. Abolitionists were being 
killed by pro-slavery defenders. Blacks 
and others were being lynched with 
alarming frequency in the South. Lin-
coln feared that what he called ‘‘the 
justice of the mob’’ might replace the 
rule of law. Sound familiar? 
In a time of such anxiety, he ques-
tioned whether people might elect a 
despot who would use his power to tear 
down the institutions of our democ-
racy, rather than preserve them. 
In his most famous passage, he 
warned that if American democracy 
were ever to perish, ‘‘it must spring up 
amongst us; it cannot come from 
abroad. If destruction be our lot, we 
must ourselves be its author and fin-
isher.’’ 
I heard those words quoted by a 
thoughtful Member of the House of 
Representatives on the night of Janu-
ary 6, 2021, after the mob that attacked 
this Capitol had gone and Congress had 
returned to complete our duty to cer-
tify the electoral ballots and declare 
Joe Biden the President of the United 
States. 
The weapons and military programs 
that we will debate in the coming days 
are important. They are essential to 
protect America. But weapons alone 
cannot save us if we don’t understand 
what we are fighting to defend. There 
is only one sure way to preserve Amer-
ican democracy, Lincoln told us. We 
must know our history. We should 
study the Declaration of Independence 
and the Constitution, he said, as if 
they were a Bible, so that we revere 
the principles upon which our democ-
racy is built. 
Our democracy can’t survive if we re-
ject the great proposition for which so 
many died at Gettysburg: that all peo-
ple are created equal. Our democracy 
cannot survive if we abide by the rule 
of law only when it suits us. And it will 
not endure if we see each other as en-
emies rather than as friends and citi-
zens of one Nation that we all love. 
We have seen a demonstration of that 
particular issue this week in the House 
of Representatives. 
In his book, ‘‘Lincoln at Gettys-
burg,’’ Garry Wills wrote that ‘‘Up to 
the Civil War, the United States was 
referred to as a plural noun. ‘The 
United States are a free country.’ After

Gettysburg, it became singular, ‘The 
United States is a free country.’’’ 
As it says above your head, Mr. 
President, ‘‘e pluribus unum.’’ 
As we look forward to celebrating 
our national holiday of Thanksgiving, 
perhaps we could try a little harder to 
hear the ‘‘mystic chords of memory’’— 
what a phrase—that unite us. 
I think about that Gettysburg Ad-
dress, and I was asked to give a speech 
about the Gettysburg Address at Get-
tysburg many years ago. I tried to set 
out whatever I had to say in 272 words. 
I think I did a fair job, but I would give 
myself a passing grade, at best. But it 
was a complete shock to my audience 
when I stopped at 272 words, and Lin-
coln said that a speech doesn’t have to 
be eternal to be immortal. 
In our lives as public servants, we are 
called on to speak very often. And I am 
reminded, time and again, the impact 
that Lincoln had with so few words, to 
capture the moment, to give people 
hope, and to craft phrases which still 
endure to this day as some of the most 
masterful uses of the English language 
one can imagine. 
Tomorrow, I hope we can take a mo-
ment to recall our childhood education, 
when we were taught the Gettysburg 
Address and perhaps recite what we 
can of it. And I hope we will remember, 
even in these dark times, that we have 
faced harder times than this and we 
were delivered and this Nation en-
dured.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss the fiscal year 2022 National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
Over the coming days, the Senate 
will consider this bill, which the Armed 
Services Committee passed by a broad 
bipartisan margin of 23 to 3 in July. 
I look forward to debating and im-
proving this bill, as we all work toward 
ensuring our military has the right 
tools 
and 
capabilities 
to 
combat 
threats around the globe and keep 
Americans safe. 
First, I would like to acknowledge 
Ranking Member INHOFE, whose leader-
ship on this committee and this body 
has been invaluable. His commitment 
to our men and women in uniform is 
unwavering, and he was instrumental 
in helping to produce this bipartisan 
legislation. 
As we debate the NDAA, we must 
keep in mind that the United States is 
engaged in a strategic competition 
with China and Russia. These near-peer 
rivals do not accept U.S. global leader-
ship or the international norms that 
have helped keep the peace for the bet-
ter part of a century. 
This strategic competition is likely 
to intensify due to shifts in the mili-
tary balance of power and diverging 
views of governance. And it is unfold-
ing amidst climate change and the 
emergence of highly disruptive tech-
nologies. 
The interconnected nature of these 
threats will drive how we transform 
our tools of national power to respond. 
The passage of the FY2022 NDAA will 
be a critical step in meeting the com-
plex challenges before us. 
Turning to the specifics of this year’s 
Defense bill, the NDAA authorizes $740 
billion for the Department of Defense 
and $27 billion for national security 
programs within the Department of 
Energy. 
For the first time in years, this legis-
lation, like the President’s budget re-
quest, does not include a separate over-
seas contingency fund, or OCO, request. 
Any war-related costs are included in 
the base budget. 
This bill contains a number of impor-
tant provisions that I would like to 
highlight. 
To begin, we have a duty to ensure 
that 
the 
United 
States 
can 
outcompete, deter, and prevail against 
near-peer rivals. The NDAA supports 
the Department of Defense in this en-
deavor by providing the resources need-
ed by the combatant commanders to 
carry out the national defense strat-
egy, or NDS. 
Every 4 years, the Department re-
ports the NDS to outline the national 
security objectives of the administra-
tion. The 2018 NDS provided a frame-
work, and the DOD will release a new 
strategy in the coming months. 
In this regard, this bill creates a 
commission on the national defense 
strategy for the forthcoming NDS in 
order to boost our military advantage. 
Last year, the Armed Service Com-
mittee created the Pacific Deterrence 
Initiative—or 
PDI—to 
better 
align 
DOD resources in support of military- 
to-military partnerships to address the 
challenges posed by China. 
This year’s bill extends and modifies 
the PDI and reiterates the committee’s 
intent to improve our force posture in 
the Indo-Pacific, to increase readiness 
and presence, and to build the capabili-
ties of our partners and allies to 
counter these threats. 
Future 
investments 
under 
PDI 
should focus on military and non-
military infrastructure in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. This will assist in distrib-
uted military operations, and it will be 
more effective in countering predatory 
Chinese 
infrastructure 
development 
practices. 
The bill also requires the Secretary 
of Defense to provide recurring brief-
ings on efforts to deter Chinese aggres-
sion and military coercion. It compels 
a briefing on the advisability and feasi-
bility of increasing United States de-
fense cooperation with Taiwan. It is 
important we help Taiwan improve its 
overall readiness and acquire asym-
metric capabilities most likely to 
make the Chinese Government ques-
tion their ability to take the island by 
force. 
I want to emphasize, however, that 
our Nation’s ability to deter China can-
not be based on military might alone. 
We must strengthen our network of al-
lies and partners, which will be essen-
tial to any strategy for the Indo-Pa-
cific region. We must also ensure that, 
as we shift our focus to the Indo-Pa-
cific, we do not lose sight of priorities 
in other areas, like Europe. 
This year’s bill authorizes the con-
tinuation of the European Deterrence 
Initiative—or the EDI—recognizing the 
continued need to invest in support for 
our European allies and partners as we 
work toward the shared goal of deter-
ring Russian aggression, addressing 
strategic competition, and mitigating 
shared security concerns, the most re-
cent one being the amassing of Russian 
troops on the border of Ukraine. 
Turning to personnel, the key factor 
that makes the United States the 
greatest military power in the world is 
its people. We need to ensure that our 
uniformed personnel know every day 
how much we appreciate what they do 
and that we have their backs. 
Congress has done a good job in pro-
viding benefits to the military and 
their families, and this year’s Defense 
bill continues to do that. But our mili-
tary is showing the strain of two dec-
ades of continuous deployments, and I 
am concerned that there has been a 
dangerous erosion of trust within the 
chain of command; and issues such as 
racism, extremism, sexual harassment, 
and sexual assault have been allowed 
to fester and create friction and divi-
sion. 
The Department of Defense is ad-
dressing those issues, but Congress 
must provide guidance and resources. 
To this end, the bill strengthens the 
All-Volunteer Force and improves the 
quality of life of the men and women of 
the total force: the Active Duty, the 
National Guard, and the Reserves; 
their families; and, importantly, the 
Department of Defense civilian em-
ployees, who contribute significantly 
to the effectiveness of our operations. 
It reinforces the principles of a 
strong, diverse, inclusive force and 
that force cohesion requires a com-
mand climate that does not tolerate 
extremism 
or 
sexual 
assault 
mis-
conduct or racism; and that quality 
healthcare is a fundamental necessity 
for servicemembers and their families. 
Importantly, this NDAA includes the 
funding necessary to support a 2.7 per-
cent pay raise for both military serv-
icemembers 
and 
the 
DOD 
civilian 
workforce. We have also included a 
provision that would amend the Mili-
tary Selective Service Act to require 
the registration of women for Selective 
Service. I am proud of this position, 
which passed the Armed Services Com-
mittee on a broad bipartisan basis. 
Society, the military, and the nature 
of warfare itself have evolved signifi-
cantly since the 1948 Military Selective 
Service Act passed. Back then, women 
were denied the opportunity to serve in

combat roles and key leadership posi-
tions, and entire technologies and plat-
forms didn’t even exist. 
Today, all military occupations, in-
cluding combat roles, are open to 
women, and military success depends 
heavily on servicemembers with ad-
vanced education and technical skills 
in STEM, cyber, medicine, languages, 
and more. 
To be clear, I am hopeful that we will 
never have to draft again. If we do, 
however, 
it 
will 
be 
under 
cir-
cumstances so dire and existential that 
to voluntarily choose to enter the fight 
with anything less than our very best 
would be supremely foolish and poten-
tially fatal. If we are going to have a 
Selective Service System, women must 
be a part of it. Basic equality and mili-
tary readiness demand parity between 
the sexes to protect our country and 
uphold our values. In the meantime, it 
is time to end outdated sex discrimina-
tion and remove it from official policy 
and Federal law. 
The bill also creates a new category 
of bereavement leave for military per-
sonnel that would permit servicemem-
bers to take up to 2 weeks of leave in 
connection with the death of a spouse 
or a child. Similarly, in an effort to 
provide greater care and support to our 
military men and women, it increases 
parental leave to 12 weeks for all serv-
icemembers for the birth, adoption, or 
foster care placement of a child. It es-
tablishes a basic needs allowance to en-
sure that all servicemembers can meet 
the basic needs of their families, and it 
requires parity and special and incen-
tive pays for members of the Reserve 
and the active components. 
In addition, I am proud that this bill 
makes historic changes to the military 
justice system to combat and discour-
age sexual assault and related mis-
conduct within the military. Sexual as-
sault is an unconscionable crime and a 
pervasive problem in the U.S. military 
and American society writ large. 
When it comes to the military, one of 
the basic ethics is that one must pro-
tect your comrades and your subordi-
nates; one cannot exploit them. Sexual 
assault and sexual harassment is an ex-
ample of unconscionable exploitation, 
and it must be eliminated. We must 
take comprehensive action to halt sex-
ual misconduct, hold offenders ac-
countable, 
and 
support 
survivors. 
While the military has tried to stop 
sexual assault in the ranks, it simply 
hasn’t been enough. 
I commend President Biden, the De-
partment of Defense, and the Inde-
pendent Review Commission for their 
work on proposals, which we have con-
sidered during our markup and which 
are reflected in the bill. We will con-
tinue to work with the administration 
and the House to move toward enacting 
this momentous change. 
Turning now to the areas of air, land, 
and sea power, with respect to our 
services, we have taken steps to im-
prove their capabilities, their readi-
ness, and their ability to fight and win. 
This bill makes significant efforts to 
improve the readiness of the Navy and 
Marine Corps aircraft, ships, and weap-
ons systems. It provides considerable 
investments in our next-generation 
Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, includ-
ing an increase of $1.7 billion to restore 
a second guided missile destroyer to 
this year’s budget and $125 million for 
long lead material for our destroyer in 
fiscal year 2023. 
The bill authorizes $4.8 billion for the 
Columbia-class submarine program and 
for industrial-based development and 
expansion in support of the Virginia 
and Columbia shipbuilding programs, 
an increase of $130 million. 
I was up at Quonset Point, RI, re-
cently, where all submarines start 
their construction. Along with the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense, Secretary 
Hicks, we saw the progress that we are 
making to build two Virginia-class sub-
marines a year and turning out the 
first Columbia-class ballistic missile 
ship to replace the Ohio class. 
We are moving forward. And, frankly, 
many believe—as I do—that undersea 
strength is the best form of deterrence 
that we have. And as we deploy more 
submarines, we will have a greater 
ability to deter potential conflict. 
This bill also increases the Landing 
Helicopter Assault replacement fund-
ing by $350 million and the Expedi-
tionary Fast Transport vessel program 
by $270 million. 
Growing our surface and undersea 
warfare capabilities will be vital to our 
success in the Indo-Pacific region, and 
this NDAA makes important progress 
in this area. It is consistent with our 
defense strategy of shifting our focus 
to the Pacific, which requires a shift of 
resources to the Navy and Marine 
Corps. 
Similarly, the bill authorizes funding 
to strengthen naval aviation, including 
five additional F–35 fighter variants, 
one additional E–2D Hawkeye aircraft, 
two additional C–130J Hercules air-
craft, an additional KC–130J tanker, 
two additional CH–53K helicopters, and 
two MQ–4C Triton unmanned aerial 
systems. 
Now, with respect to the Air Force, 
the bill increases authorization funding 
by providing an additional F–35A fight-
er, five additional F–15 fighters, and ex-
tensions on the minimal capacity of 
several Air Force platforms. 
With respect to the Army, I am 
pleased that the bill advances research 
and development in important future 
technologies and makes broad invest-
ments in generational Army mod-
ernization efforts and continues to up-
grade significant enduring capabilities. 
Our bill focuses on filling critical de-
ficiencies and increasing investments 
in rapidly evolving demands. Further, 
it funds rapid development and fielding 
of land-based, long-range fires, includ-
ing the precision strike missile, me-
dium-range capability, and long-range 
hypersonic weapons. 
It also provides funding for future 
long-range assault aircraft and future 
attack 
reconnaissance 
aircraft, 
in-
creased funding for the future tactical 
unmanned aircraft system, and author-
izes full funding for the AH–64 Apache 
attack helicopters and the UH–60 Black 
Hawk utility helicopters. 
We are at a critical junction in a 
technological race with our near-peer 
competitors. We have enjoyed a tech-
nological lead over the last many dec-
ades. That lead is shrinking, and we 
have to not only develop the best of 
new technologies; we have to get them 
in the hands of our troops as quickly as 
possible. And that is what we are try-
ing to do in this legislation. 
Again, the issue is deterrence first, 
and what will help deter any conflict 
will be the realization of our adver-
saries that they are going up against 
the most sophisticated, technologically 
capable military in the world, manned 
by the most dedicated and skillful 
women and men in the world. That is 
what we are hoping to encourage. 
Likewise, with respect to the Army, 
the bill supports the modernization of 
its ground combat vehicles, including 
the M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley Fight-
ing Vehicles, Paladin self-propelled 
howitzer, tactical-type vehicles. 
Having the platforms and the per-
sonnel is critical, but they have got to 
be ready to go, and we have taken 
great pride in trying to improve the 
readiness of our forces. 
This NDAA authorizes more than $2.8 
billion for additional military con-
struction projects after funding other 
large projects in the budget request. 
This bill also includes a number of pro-
visions that will help acquisition out-
comes by strengthening the ability of 
DOD to analyze the defense industrial 
base, evaluate acquisition programs, 
and implement acquisition reform ef-
forts. 
It also streamlines processes to allow 
the Pentagon to invest in and incor-
porate 
advanced 
commercial 
tech-
nologies to support defense missions 
and strengthen DOD small business 
programs to allow partnerships with 
innovative, high-tech companies. 
From post-World War II until very 
recently, we were really in an indus-
trial age, and the United States led the 
world. We have now moved to a post-in-
dustrial age where the new tech-
nologies, the new innovations aren’t 
coming out of government labs or the 
Bell Labs; they are coming out of small 
business; they are coming out of young 
people who have come up with great 
ideas. 
And what we want to do and what we 
want to empower the Department of 
Defense to do is to be able to get those 
ideas, develop them, and incorporate 
them rapidly into our military forces. 
That means we have to develop part-
nerships with small business and think 
in a different way. We have to think 
about a more entrepreneurial acquisi-
tion system rather than ‘‘this is the 
way we have always done it and are 
going to keep doing it.’’ 
We also have another area that we 
have to pay attention to, and that is

November 18, 2021 
the area of the modernization of our 
nuclear triad. I recognize the concerns 
voiced by some of my colleagues about 
the cost of, and genuine disagreements 
about, our Nation’s nuclear policy. 
From my perspective, nuclear deter-
rence is the bedrock of our national de-
fense. For our nuclear deterrent to be 
credible and to ensure these weapons 
never need to be used, they must be ca-
pable and ready for use. 
The deterrence that we have enjoyed 
for many, many decades has been 
gained by the acknowledgement by all 
other nuclear powers that we are more 
than capable to respond. Our allies and 
partners depend on the U.S. nuclear 
umbrella. That is one of the reasons 
why the proliferation which President 
Kennedy thought would be almost uni-
versal has not developed. And mod-
ernization of our strategic forces is 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
their 
depend-
ability. 
One thing I think everyone agrees on, 
and I think often gets lost in the dis-
cussion, is another factor: arms control 
and 
modernization 
of 
our 
nuclear 
forces are inherently linked together. 
We must reinvigorate our efforts on 
arms control so that we do not have a 
situation where the proliferation issue 
becomes more obvious and more dan-
gerous. So even as we modernize, we 
should seek ways to promote strategic 
stability, like the extension of the New 
START agreement and follow-on talks 
to cover new strategic weapons and 
further reduce nuclear stockpiles. The 
best way to reduce nuclear weapons is 
through negotiated mutual arms reduc-
tions rather than unilateral actions. 
That has been the history of the Cold 
War, which with the Soviets and the 
United States we were able, with every 
Presidency, to come up with some type 
of agreement. Unfortunately, we took, 
I think, a less aggressive posture in the 
last administration, but we have to 
renew significantly our arms control 
efforts and make them clear that it is 
mutual interest of Russia but also 
China because China is a growing nu-
clear power with a very deliberate plan 
to increase significantly their nuclear 
arsenals. 
We have to get a situation where 
there is at least a trilateral negotia-
tion between the United States, China, 
and Russia for our own mutual benefit. 
And part of that is also not just look-
ing at numbers but looking at the safe-
guards that each country places on the 
use of nuclear weapons. 
We do not want a situation where 
there is an accidental launch that trig-
gers a catastrophic response. We have 
much to do. But I will emphasize again 
that simply rebuilding our triad with-
out rebuilding our diplomacy is not the 
best path forward. 
What we have tried to do in this bill 
is to enhance deterrence through a 
number of factors, including recapital-
izing the nuclear triad; ensuring the 
safety and security and reliability of 
our nuclear stockpile, our delivery sys-
tems, and our infrastructure; increas-
ing capacity in theater and homeland 
missile defense; and strengthening non-
proliferation programs. 
We have—particularly our land-based 
missile 
systems—installations 
that 
were built in the 1960s. They are rough-
ly 60 years old. They are showing wear 
and tear. And the delivery vehicles are 
also old. That is part of our moderniza-
tion program. The Columbia class is 
the first of our new ballistic missile 
submarines. We have to replace the 
Ohio class because, frankly, that fleet 
will literally wear out. They won’t be 
capable to go to sea at some point in 
the future. And that is why we are be-
ginning right now. We are also looking 
at a new, sophisticated armor that will 
complement the other two legs of the 
triad. 
And because this involves the De-
partment of Energy and the National 
Nuclear Security Administration, we 
authorized $20 billion for this effort. 
We have funded the Department of En-
ergy’s other defense activities at $920 
million and its nuclear energy activi-
ties at $149.8 million. This is all part of 
having an effective deterrence. 
Now, as we have seen, our adversaries 
are developing other capabilities at an 
alarming 
rate. 
With 
regard 
to 
hypersonics, it is especially clear that 
China is working to develop capabili-
ties that evade current missile defense 
capabilities possessed by the United 
States and our allies. To address these 
threats, the bill authorizes the Missile 
Defense Agency to develop a highly re-
liable missile defense interceptor for 
the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense 
System. It also authorizes the procure-
ment of the Iron Dome short-range 
rocket defense system, David’s Sling 
Weapon System, and Arrow 3 Upper 
Tier Interceptor Program to support 
our closest ally in the Middle East, 
Israel. 
There was a barrage emanating from 
Israel’s neighbors of approximately 
4,500 missiles over the last year. And 
Iron Dome, which was created by the 
Israeli Government, knocked down a 
significant number of those missiles 
protecting the State of Israel. So this 
is not an academic exercise; this is sup-
porting a close ally. 
And it is also clear, as I mentioned 
before, China is expanding its nuclear 
weapons stockpile at a faster rate than 
we have seen from any other nation. It 
appears that China is seeking to at 
least reach parity with the United 
States and Russia in its efforts to be-
come a world-class military. To re-
spond to this and other countries’ pro-
liferation efforts, the NDAA authorizes 
$239.84 million for Cooperative Threat 
Reduction Programs to stop the pro-
liferation of nuclear, chemical, and bi-
ological threats around the world. 
If you take those three aspects—im-
proving our military capability, invig-
orating our diplomacy, and actively 
using Cooperative Threat Reduction— 
to lower the ability and capability of 
those that have nuclear weapons, that 
is the best path ahead. 
Now, we have understood over the 
last several years that what is causing 
a great deal of destruction in this 
world in every aspect is technology, in-
cluding cyber space activities. And we, 
again, are trying to hone and invig-
orate our technological innovation in 
this area. 
Innovation has long given us the 
strongest economy and military in the 
world. But it must be nurtured and 
maintained through careful invest-
ments and strong leadership in both 
the public and private sectors. 
I believe we have an advantage be-
cause we have such a great educational 
system, a great entrepreneurial sys-
tem, the creativity and talent of the 
American people, but we have to focus 
on needs for our military and national 
priorities. 
And our top priority for Congress 
must be maintaining strong invest-
ments in technology areas that we 
know will shape future conflicts. This 
year’s NDAA includes multiple provi-
sions to accelerate the modernization 
of the Department of Defense by in-
vesting in research and development of 
cutting-edge technologies and deliv-
ering them in a timely manner to the 
force. Specifically, it authorizes an in-
crease of more than $1 billion for 
science and technology programs that 
fund cutting-edge research and proto-
typing activities at universities, small 
businesses, defense labs, and industry, 
including in critical areas such as arti-
ficial 
intelligence, 
microelectronics, 
advanced 
materials, 
5G, 
and 
bio-
technology. 
The bill also authorizes an increase 
of more than $500 million in funding for 
DARPA, 
the 
Defense 
Advanced 
Projects Agency. DARPA has been con-
ducting high-risk, high-payoff research 
for years, including such areas as quan-
tum computing and assisting with uni-
versities to accelerate their research. 
Importantly, the implements a number 
of recommendations from the National 
Security Commission on Artificial In-
telligence, which the Armed Services 
Committee established in a previous 
NDAA. The $500 million of funding for 
DARPA will be extremely critical to 
the future and will produce, I think, 
some breakthrough technologies that 
not only DOD will use but will become 
commercial products for our national 
economy. 
And recognizing, again, the competi-
tion between the United States and 
China on certain militarily-relevant 
technologies, the bill strengthens the 
language of the CHIPS Act to ensure 
the national network for microelec-
tronics research and development to 
support the development of world-lead-
ing domestic microelectronics tech-
nology and manufacturing capabilities. 
Now, I mentioned one of our prob-
lems is that we are moving from an in-
dustrial age, in which we were the 
dominant power in every dimension, to 
a new post-industrial age, where tech-
nological innovation has been distrib-
uted. Other countries, because of the

November 18, 2021 
nature of cyber and other technologies, 
are beginning to catch up with it and, 
in some cases, pass us. Often, and espe-
cially in the Department of Defense, 
one of our problems has been procure-
ment and acquisition practices. The 
Department’s approach has been con-
voluted, poorly communicated, and 
burdened with inertia that makes 
partnering with private industry far 
too difficult. As America confronts 
threats around the globe that are 
evolving at unprecedented speeds, we 
must find a better way to identify our 
defense needs, communicate them, and 
deliver them in a timely manner. 
There are several areas that, if trans-
formed, could allow DOD to more effec-
tively do this. The fiscal year 2022 
NDAA makes important progress by es-
tablishing an independent commission 
to review and assess the planning, pro-
gramming, budgeting, and execution— 
or PPBE—process and identify areas 
for reform. 
The PPBE process has, for many dec-
ades, since the 1960s, given DOD leaders 
a way to evaluate the resources they 
need and to deliver them to the troops. 
However, as I mention consistently, it 
is a bit of a relic of the industrial age. 
It came in 1961 under Secretary of 
Defense Robert McNamara, the former 
chief executive of the Ford Company. 
And at that time, it was the most so-
phisticated way to manage resources 
and do research, but that was the 
height of the industrial age. 
We are now in a situation much dif-
ferent. So we need to modernize the 
procurement system and the acquisi-
tion system that we have in place. We 
have to make it more rapid, more 
agile, more capable of absorbing new 
products and getting them into the 
hands of the troops. 
So in addition to establishing this 
independent review commission, the 
NDAA requires the DOD Comptroller, 
along with the DOD’s Chief Informa-
tion Officer and the Chief Data Officer, 
to submit a plan to consolidate the IT 
systems used to manage data and sup-
port the PPBE process. 
One of the things we have discovered 
is there is no really integrated data 
plan in the Department of Defense—the 
largest Federal entity. There are mul-
tiple different brands of software sys-
tems, different brand of hardware. 
Some can talk to others, some can’t. 
There is no successful company today 
that has such a, shall we say, slightly 
immature information processing sys-
tem, and we have got to change it. 
Similarly, 
management 
trans-
formation is badly needed with the De-
partment. As I said, it is one of the 
largest bureaucracies in the world, and 
the Government Accountability Office 
has put the Pentagon’s approach to 
business management on its high-risk 
list, citing its vulnerability to waste, 
fraud, and abuse, inability to pass a fi-
nancial audit, and a culture that re-
mains resistant to change. To spur 
transformation, this NDAA requires 
the Secretary of Defense to improve 
Pentagon management by leveraging 
best practices and expertise from com-
mercial industry, public administra-
tion, and business schools. 
I am confident these steps will allow 
us to leverage the best of American in-
genuity and market talent that drives 
innovation. At the end of the day, we 
should think about management as a 
defense capability like any other. We 
hope we are opening up a new day of 
more efficient and sophisticated man-
agement, more integrated communica-
tion, and doing it in a way that will 
produce results that will get the best 
technology into the hands of our fight-
ing men and women. 
One factor that we all are aware of 
every day is the challenge of cyber se-
curity. The cyber domain impacts ev-
erything we do, so there is absolutely 
no surprise that it has impacted the 
Defense Department and its industrial 
base. We need to ensure that our indus-
trial base has improved cyber security, 
that they are not the back door 
through which our adversaries will use 
to enter and gain access to even more 
critical elements of our national secu-
rity. As the recent SolarWinds, Micro-
soft Exchange Server, and Colonial 
Pipeline breaches painfully illustrated, 
traditional 
‘‘perimeter-based’’ 
cyber 
defenses are simply inadequate to deal 
with sophisticated threats. Our adver-
saries are clearly advantaged in cyber 
domain and are likely to succeed in 
penetrating static defenses. Therefore, 
this NDAA requires the development of 
a joint ‘‘zero trust’’ cyber security 
strategy and a model architecture for 
the Department of Defense information 
network. It also authorizes an increase 
of $268.4 million across DOD to support 
cyber security efforts. 
We all recognize that cyber is a per-
sistent threat to everything we do. As 
one very thoughtful gentleman said 
years ago at a function I was at, 
‘‘Breakthrough technology like cyber 
has two effects. It makes good things 
better and bad things worse.’’ And that 
is exactly what we are witnessing 
every day. So we have to exploit the 
good things and get them into our sys-
tem and be much more vigilant at pro-
tecting us from the bad things. 
Similarly, as the COVID crisis has 
made clear, we need a coordinated in-
dustrial policy to ensure that we have 
a robust, secure, and reliable tech-
nology and industrial base, especially 
in critical and emerging technology. 
We need to give the DOD the tools 
and expertise to understand its supply 
chain and its physical security chal-
lenges, its financial challenges, and in-
fluence 
from 
commercial 
market 
trends. To that end, this bill directs 
the Comptroller General to conduct a 
comprehensive assessment of research, 
development, test, and evaluation au-
thorities and other similar authorities 
and brief Congress on its findings. 
The pandemic has shown many inter-
esting things. Many companies and 
suppliers to our defense thought their 
products were coming from the United 
States, only to discover that critical 
components came from elsewhere and 
sometimes countries that were not par-
ticularly friendly to us. So we have to 
look seriously at our supply chain. 
Finally, while I spent most of my 
time speaking about future challenges 
and how we prepare the Department of 
Defense to face them, we cannot lose 
sight of the events surrounding our 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
After nearly 20 years of war, enor-
mous sacrifice by American and coali-
tion military, diplomatic, and intel-
ligence personnel and vast U.S. invest-
ment, the Afghan state has failed, and 
the Taliban has taken control. 
The Armed Services Committee has 
undertaken a series of hearings seeking 
to understand the collapse of the Af-
ghan National Defense and Security 
Forces. While there is temptation to 
close the book on Afghanistan and sim-
ply move on to long-term strategic 
competition with China and Russia, we 
must learn the lessons of the last two 
decades to ensure that our future coun-
terterrorism efforts in Afghanistan or 
anyplace else continue to hold violent 
extremists at bay. 
The top-line defense number in this 
bill, together with the allocations set 
by Chairman LEAHY for defense and 
nondefense funding across the 12 appro-
priations bills, provides a realistic bal-
ance for funding the military and the 
rest of the Federal Government. 
Once we have completed work on this 
important authorization bill, we need 
to complete the appropriations process. 
It would be a tremendous mistake and 
harmful for our national security, our 
economic prosperity, and our public 
health to resort to a continuing resolu-
tion to fund the government for an ex-
tensive period. 
I have calculated, roughly, that if we 
go into a yearlong continuing resolu-
tion, the Department of Defense will 
lose $36 billion, and the consequences 
of that would be staggering, particu-
larly at this moment where we face 
challenges across the globe. 
We have near-peer competition with 
Russia and China, dangerous develop-
ments in East Africa, and situations 
across the board where we need to be 
ready to go looking at the threats, not 
looking internally at how we are going 
to pay to keep the lights on. 
Again, to avoid this self-inflicted 
damage, we have to pass a budget, as 
well as this authorization bill. 
Let me conclude by once again 
thanking Ranking Member INHOFE and 
my colleagues on the committee for 
working thoughtfully on a bipartisan 
basis to develop this important piece of 
legislation. 
I would also like to thank the staff 
who worked tirelessly on this bill 
throughout the year—and tirelessly is 
an understatement. While we were 
leaving after our last vote, they were 
staying hours later to get this bill in 
shape to pass and then to begin our 
dialogue with the House. It is the staff 
of both sides. I salute my Republican

colleagues’ staffers and my staffers for 
their job. 
I look forward to a thoughtful debate 
on the issues as we go forward. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be recog-
nized for such time as I shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. First of all, this is a big 
deal, what we are embarking on now. It 
is something that—people understand 
it is the most important thing we do 
around here. 
Let me just say that my partner 
JACK REED and I have been doing this a 
long time. I have often said how fortu-
nate I am. You know, we hear all year 
out there in the real world about how 
everybody hates everybody in Wash-
ington; we want to compete with each 
other. But, you know, every year when 
we do the NDAA—that means the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act—it is 
the biggest and the most important bill 
of the year. Even though people think 
it is all happening inside this 2- or 3- 
day period, it is not. It is something 
that goes on all year long, and we have 
gotten to know each other very well. 
We know there are some areas where 
we have differences, but very rarely do 
we have differences that would impair 
our mission, and our mission is the 
most important mission that we have 
year-round. 
So I appreciate very much Chairman 
REED, what he has been doing along 
with me, what we have done together. 
The NDAA has a long history of bipar-
tisanship, and Senator REED and I have 
worked 
together 
to 
get 
this 
bill 
through the committee with an over-
whelming, bipartisan, 23-to-3 vote to 
bring it to the floor. That is where we 
are today. That is something you don’t 
hear about in Washington, that you 
can pass something out of a committee 
by a vote of 23 to 3, but we did, and we 
did it because this is a bill that is done 
by the Members. 
The world is getting more dangerous 
by the day. We know that is the case. 
One notable example is what is hap-
pening now at the Ukraine border. Just 
weeks after conducting its largest mili-
tary exercise in 40 years, Russia came 
dancing in, advancing a huge military 
buildup on the border. In fact, the De-
fense Minister from Ukraine was in my 
office this morning and was talking 
about all the things that are going on 
there. 
According to the image that we have 
by satellite, we are seeing tanks, we 
are seeing missiles, and we are seeing 
artillery. Here is why I am really con-
cerned: We are seeing even military 
ambulances. Why would Putin be put-
ting in military ambulances if he was 
not expecting casualties? The answer 
is, he wouldn’t. So we have an idea 
what is going to happen. 
In addition to this equipment, the ex-
perts are reporting that 90,000 Russian 
combat 
troops 
are 
amassed 
along 
Ukraine’s border. These troops are in a 
more threatening posture than they 
have ever been before. They are in the 
south and in the north. They are 
knocking on the door of Kyiv. All that 
is going on right now. 
It might sound crazy that Russia 
would want to deploy so many forces 
now in November to a region where the 
winters are brutally cold, but there is 
something not many people really 
think about; that is, frozen ground is 
easier to move around heavy equip-
ment like tanks and artillery. 
I am not the only one who is sound-
ing the alarm on this. Earlier this 
year, Senator ROUNDS and Congress-
man TRENT KELLY and I visited Roma-
nia, which, like Ukraine, sits on the 
frontlines of Russian aggression. At 
that time, Romanian military officials 
warned us that Russia was moving 
from a defensive to an offensive pos-
ture in the Black Sea. We are seeing 
that now. Everything we have pre-
dicted is happening now, and that as-
sessment of the shift was actually 
right. 
Putin is capitalizing on what he per-
ceives as U.S. weakness. He knows that 
our NATO allies are disturbed by the 
catastrophe in Afghanistan and that 
many of the European nations fear 
that the United States is no longer in-
terested in trans-Atlantic security. 
The President shouldn’t have done 
what he did, and we all—I think most 
Americans know that. It was a dis-
aster, the way he put this thing to-
gether in Afghanistan, and now we 
know where we are on this. It is tempt-
ing to say that we have seen this be-
fore, but I don’t think we have just like 
this. 
So this is about Americans, NATO, 
the credibility and the capability, and 
that is why the NDAA is so important 
every year but especially this year. 
But, first, let’s be frank: Russia is far 
from our only threat. In 2008—this is a 
document that a lot of people have 
looked at and thought, why didn’t we 
do this before? This was back, I think, 
in—what was it? About 5 years ago, it 
was put together. We had what we con-
sidered to be the top six Democrats and 
the top six Republicans on defense, and 
they put this book together. It is a 
very brief book, but we have been—this 
has been our Bible. We have been doing 
this now for a long time, and the 
things that we were predicting at that 
time are actually becoming a reality. 
It tells us for the first time—and this 
is significant. People don’t understand 
this. For the first time, we have two 
major adversaries at the same time. 
This hasn’t happened before. And, you 
know, we are talking about Russia. 
Yes, that is significant, and you have 
heard me say this before—the Chinese 
Communist Party has been investing 
heavily in modernizing its military. 
Over the last two decades, their mili-
tary spending has gone up 450 percent— 
just in the last two decades. Now, we 
are not doing that over here. 
You know, I have to say—and every-
one realizes this—these communist 
countries have a great advantage. They 
can move and move quickly, and they 
don’t seem to have any limitations. 
Now, we are seeing the results of that 
investment. 
They 
have 
tested 
hypersonic missiles that we don’t even 
have anymore. I have to say that 
again. Hypersonic missiles are some-
thing they have and they are using. 
They have tested. We have seen it. We 
don’t even have it, and we don’t have 
any counter to that. They are leap-
frogging us in other critical areas, like 
artificial intelligence, and they are 
rapidly expanding their nuclear arsenal 
and infrastructure. 
These investments in military capa-
bility are done with real purpose. They 
are a threat to Taiwan and other allies 
in the Indo-Pacific. Ambassador Bi- 
khim Hsiao was in my office this morn-
ing—Ambassador from Taiwan—and we 
were looking at things that are going 
on there, just like we are looking at 
from the Russian area. 
But the threat China poses to our 
own interests can’t be overstated or 
underestimated. 
Meanwhile, North Korea—so it is not 
just those two countries. North Korea 
is out there. Iran is out there. They are 
also continuing their threatening be-
havior. North Korea is conducting mis-
sile tests of its own, and Iran continues 
to back proxies striking at U.S. troops 
and our interests—most recently, we 
have seen in Syria. 
The terrorist threat in Afghanistan 
is also resurging thanks to the disas-
trous drawdown that continues to un-
dermine U.S. credibility. We know that 
ISIS-K and al-Qaida have the desire 
and intent to strike our homeland. 
This is something that a lot of people 
don’t understand. A lot of people don’t 
believe the threat that is out there. 
Now we know when they will be able to 
strike us, and it is closer than you 
think. As soon as 6 months from now, 
the Senate Armed Services Committee 
was told just last month this could 
happen. 
So I don’t say this to be dramatic. 
This is a reality, plain and simple. The 
world is more dangerous than it has 
ever been in my lifetime—by the way, 
people have reminded me over and over 
again yesterday and today, since it was 
my birthday, how long that lifetime 
has been—and we have seen a lot, but 
we haven’t seen anything like this be-
fore. 
National security needs to be the top 
priority. Without a strong military de-
fending our way of life, nothing else 
matters. We can talk about other 
things, but it doesn’t really matter if 
we can’t do that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8416 
November 18, 2021 
Since World War II, we have ensured 
peace through the world by projecting 
strength. Our military should and must 
serve as a strong deterrent to our ad-
versaries, and they have to know that 
they can’t beat us. Some people are 
questioning that, but they have to 
know that they can’t beat us, and we 
have to show them that they can’t. Yet 
we are fully aware that they have 
things we don’t have. They have tech-
nology we don’t have. This is some-
thing we haven’t dealt with before. 
President Biden’s inadequate defense 
budget request, the irresponsible draw-
down in Afghanistan—something he 
shouldn’t have done; the administra-
tion should not have done—and the 
lack of commitment to shared nuclear 
security are calling that into question. 
It 
is 
evidence 
that 
we 
aren’t 
prioritizing national defense, and we 
already have seen what happens when 
we don’t prioritize national defense. We 
see upticks in destabilizing, threat-
ening behavior—exactly what Putin is 
doing right now. Just imagine what 
would happen if Putin and Xi thought 
they stood a chance to beat us if we 
didn’t turn things around, and that 
could happen. 
It is a reality today that people don’t 
understand 
and 
should 
understand. 
Americans take for granted the idea 
that our military is the best. You 
know, when I go back to not just my 
State of Oklahoma but all around the 
country, people assume that. 
You know, I am old enough to re-
member what was happening at the tail 
end of World War II. We learned a les-
son. We learned to be prepared, and for 
a long period of time, we had the best 
of everything. We had the best modern 
equipment, all of this, and that isn’t 
the case today. Americans take for 
granted that we have the best of every-
thing, but we don’t. It is just not true 
anymore. 
Don’t just take my word for it, you 
know, just take it from me; a couple of 
weeks ago, our Nation’s No. 2 military 
adviser, General Hyten—no one dis-
agreed—I don’t know of anyone who 
would actually argue with General 
Hyten. He was explaining how China is 
on pace to surpass us if we don’t do 
something to change what is going on 
today. That is General Hyten. I don’t 
know a more knowledgeable person 
anywhere in America or elsewhere. 
We can meet these challenges. We 
can put our country back on the right 
track. That is going to take real in-
vestment and real strategy. Congress 
has a very important role to play here. 
We pass the National Defense Author-
ization Act and Defense appropriations 
each year, and every year, we give our 
military what it needs to set this thing 
right. 
Now, I am proud to say that this 
year’s NDAA goes a long ways to mak-
ing our country more secure. I am not 
saying it is perfect, but it is very good 
and a necessary start. And that is what 
this is all about now. It is what we are 
going to be passing—I am talking 
about tomorrow or the next day—and 
going into this long process that in-
cludes both the House and the Senate. 
So let’s start with one of the biggest 
ways to strengthen our national de-
fense: authorizing an additional $25 bil-
lion in funding for the Department of 
Defense. This is just a floor for defense 
spending. 
Now, it is important that we under-
stand this President has not been a 
good President in terms of building the 
national defense. He just isn’t. You 
know, his budget request shortchanged 
our national defense. In fact, if you put 
his budget numbers in terms of defense 
and nondefense, the amount that goes 
to nondefense averages about a 16-per-
cent increase, and the amount that 
goes to defense is a 1.6-percent in-
crease. Now, that is the President’s 
budget. It is not my budget. It is not 
our budget. It hasn’t passed, but none-
theless, that gives you an idea of where 
we are right now. The emphasis is not 
on defense. It should be, and it is not. 
President 
Biden’s 
budget 
request 
shortchanged the national defense. It 
didn’t even keep pace with out-of-con-
trol inflation. Inflation right now—the 
figure is above the 1.6 percent, and that 
is where we are today. It actually cut 
funding for our military even as we 
face the growing threats that I men-
tioned. And we are talking about the— 
compared to the inflation thing that is 
happening right now. So I am glad the 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
almost 
unanimously adopted my amendment 
to increase the Department of De-
fense’s budget top line. This is the bare 
minimum of what we need to meet the 
threats that we face. This is what un-
derscores everything we do. 
The bill also makes sure this money 
is spent the right way. As we have for 
the past few years, we are using the 
2018 national defense strategy—that is 
this book I referenced just a minute 
ago—as kind of our roadmap, and we 
are using this for that. 
The NDAA focuses on the Indo-Pa-
cific, which is our priority theater, by 
emphasizing investment in the region 
through the Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive, the PDI, which we started in last 
year’s bill. 
The way this works is we are—it is 
continuing as time goes by. We have a 
bill, and the bill is activated, usually 
in December, but then we are already 
into the next year. So while this 
seems—people say: You are only talk-
ing about one bill a year. It doesn’t 
really work out that way. 
It strengthens our supply chain so we 
are not reliant upon China, but we are 
doing that right now. It addresses the 
threats posed from information war-
fare, and it deters the foreign malign 
influence. It also stands strong against 
Russia. 
Perhaps most importantly, it pro-
vides critical lethal aid to Ukraine, and 
we know that these things are working. 
While radios and cold-weather gear are 
needed, they won’t deter Putin’s strat-
egy and his ambitions. Weapons like 
the Javelin anti-tank missiles, on the 
other hand, remind him that invading 
and annexing Kyiv will have real and 
concrete costs. 
We know Russia and China are ex-
panding their nuclear arsenals. Our nu-
clear stockpile serves as the corner-
stone for our deterrent, so we have to 
keep it safe, secure, and effective. That 
is why the NDAA supports the nuclear 
modernization 
our 
military 
com-
manders say is their top priority. 
It provides support for our allies and 
partners around the world. Unfortu-
nately, our allies and partners are 
questioning our commitment right now 
after what happened in Afghanistan, 
and they are feeling like they were 
being told and not consulted. They 
didn’t even know—that withdrawal 
that should not have taken place but 
did take place in Afghanistan is one 
that they were not even aware of. 
It provides the reassurance of Amer-
ican credibility that they desperately 
need to rebuild and cement those rela-
tionships. With strong allies and part-
ners around the world, we will ensure 
the balance of power in our favor, but 
we are not there yet. 
When it comes to hard power, this 
bill makes serious investments in 
equipment we need to fight and win 
wars now—growing our naval fleet, ex-
panding next-generation fighter capa-
bility, and providing for the largest in-
vestment in military construction in a 
decade. 
It looks to the future too. We know 
that we need to accelerate innovation 
and develop the technology that is 
going to help defeat whatever our en-
emies might throw our way. Yet, in 
many of these emerging technologies, 
we risk falling behind. In some cases, 
we already have fallen behind. It is 
kind of hard for us to accept that in 
America, as we went through several 
decades—I think since the Second 
World War—not falling behind, but we 
have now. So this year’s NDAA invests 
in defense technology that would put 
us back ahead of our competitors. That 
is our goal. Things like microelec-
tronics, 
artificial 
intelligence, 
hypersonic weapons, 5G—these are the 
areas that we are working on to get 
back in the driver’s seat. We have fall-
en behind. It is hard to say that, that 
America is falling behind. 
You know, General Hyten said re-
cently something that I really think is 
important for everyone to hear. He said 
that we must ‘‘focus on speed and re- 
inserting speed back in the process of 
the Pentagon . . . and that means tak-
ing risk, and that means learning from 
failures, and that means failing fast 
and moving fast.’’ 
I have to say that General Hyten is 
certainly one of the greatest warriors 
of our time. We should be listening to 
him. 
We have serious problems. We have 
to get policies and authorities in place 
to let the Pentagon move quickly and, 
as General Hyten put it, ‘‘fail fast.’’ As 
he retires this week, I think it is clear

why he is a national hero. He knows 
what is going on. 
Now, too much is hampered by bu-
reaucracy at the Pentagon. The NDAA 
encourages the Pentagon to move fast-
er, to take risks, and to jumpstart the 
innovation that we need to succeed, 
but we have to realize the impact. 
This is really the most important 
thing this bill does. We take care of our 
troops. People talk all the time about 
how much we spend on military. I hear 
a lot of people around who don’t think 
we need a strong military. A lot of 
them talk about why we spend more on 
our military than Russia and China put 
together. 
Yes, that is true; but we have costs 
that others don’t have. Communist 
countries don’t have the cost of taking 
care of their people. In fact, the most 
important thing we do is take care of 
our troops. Even though China and 
Russia are building up and modernizing 
their militaries, they don’t take care of 
their people—they don’t claim to take 
care of their people—and we do. The 
most expensive thing we do in our mili-
tary is to take care of our military. We 
take care of the schools and the people 
who are out there taking the risk. 
This bill takes care of our troops in 
so many ways. It improves their 
healthcare. It provides education and 
childcare for their children, and makes 
sure their spouses can have meaningful 
employment as they move from area to 
area. It is a unique problem that our 
spouses do have, as they are moving 
around the country. 
And so, again, we are competing with 
China and Russia and other countries, 
and none of them have this problem. 
This is the greatest expense that we do. 
Our servicemembers represent the very 
best in the country. If they do have to 
go into harm’s way, it is our responsi-
bility that they are the best prepared, 
best equipped, and the best led forces 
in the battlefield, and the bill does 
that. 
But we don’t want them to go to war. 
We want to prevent those wars from 
happening. As I said earlier, the best 
way we do that is by projecting 
strength, sending a message to our ad-
versaries that there is no chance that 
they can beat us. 
The NDAA is the major way that we 
send that message. And that is why the 
NDAA—the National Defense Author-
ization Act, the most significant bill of 
the year—has been enacted into law 
every year for the past 60 years. This 
will be the 61st year. 
So we are going to get it passed, but 
it almost never comes up this late in 
the year. This is the disadvantage we 
are working from, but it always gets 
done eventually. We still have a lot of 
work left to do after this and not a lot 
of time to do it. 
You know, we can’t afford late starts. 
If you do late starts, sometimes it ends 
up being just down to four people. Both 
my partner and I have been in this sit-
uation where we have been down to 
what they call the big four, making all 
these decisions ourselves. That is not 
what we are supposed to be doing. That 
is not what we want to do. But that is 
why the NDAA has been enacted into 
law every year for 60 years. 
We built this bill around Member re-
quests. This is unique. This is some-
thing people need to understand. We 
are getting our requests from the Mem-
bers that are serving with us here in 
the Senate. We are going to have an 
open amendment process. We are going 
to have an open amendment process, 
and this is what we have committed 
ourselves to do, to make sure we are 
doing. So you will get another chance 
to mark up this bill. 
So what we are doing right now is 
very important. You got to keep in 
mind, it is going to be done by the 
House; it is going to be done by the 
Senate. It is going to be something 
that is the most significant thing that 
is happening this year. But we could 
never work too hard or too long for our 
troops and national defense. 
I know some of my colleagues are 
concerned about one provision we’ve 
got—that we have in this bill at this 
time, which was added in markup and 
included in the House bill too. Now, I 
oppose the addition of this provision, 
which changes the military draft— 
what the military draft does. And I 
want you to hear this because, if en-
acted, it would expand the draft so that 
it is not just about finding combat re-
placements to serve on the frontlines; 
it also requires women to register for 
the Selective Service, not just men. 
I’ve always said, as a product of the 
draft myself, I know what the draft is. 
I was there and I served. I have always 
said that I understand that and I think 
the draft is essential. It changed my 
life, certainly. But I am strongly op-
posed to drafting our daughters and our 
granddaughters. So this is going to be 
coming up. We are going to be talking 
about this. Everything is going to be 
out in the open. Get ready for that 
fight, because that fight is coming, 
OK? 
That is why I submitted an amend-
ment to strike this provision from the 
underlying bill, and I will work to get 
it out of any conference report as well, 
OK? 
Last week, we marked Veterans Day, 
and that should be a reminder to all of 
us why we do this. In fact, we have got 
2.2 million reasons to do this—2.2 mil-
lion future veterans—our volunteer 
force, who put their lives in harm’s 
way and who rely on this bill getting 
done. And that doesn’t even include 
their families, who are sacrificing so 
much. So that’s out there, we know, 
and that is going to happen. 
I know my colleagues understand 
this. I know they understand our re-
sponsibility to our troops and to the 
American people. And so I look forward 
to our debate on this bill, and then 
passing it in the traditional, bipartisan 
way, as we always do; and, together, we 
are going to fulfill our constitutional 
duty and meet these challenges that we 
face, and we have little time to waste 
in doing this. 
So this is the most significant bill of 
the year. That is what we are going to 
do. We are going to get it done. And 
let’s go do it right, OK? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that the Senate has taken up 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
There is a 60-year tradition in this 
body of getting this bill done because 
the importance of this bill transcends 
partisanship. In fact, 81 Senators of 
both parties joined forces earlier this 
year to override a senseless veto of this 
important bill by the former President. 
Now, while both sides of the aisle can 
work cooperatively to get this defense 
policy done, we are now seeing unprec-
edented—unprecedented—obstruction 
by the minority party for passing a 
budget that will fund the programs 
that our military and our veterans 
need. 
Now, look, if Republicans succeed in 
this obstruction, I am going to tell you 
that the government will be forced to 
go to a full-year continuing resolution. 
That is not workable. The result will 
be frozen spending levels for the De-
partment of Defense and for the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, which 
amounts to a $70 billion cut in spend-
ing for those two Agencies alone, com-
pared to the appropriations bills pre-
pared in the U.S. Senate. 
I serve as chairman of the Senate 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and let 
me tell you what is at stake for Amer-
ica’s veterans and their families. Fund-
ing will be blocked for priorities like 
expanding veterans’ access to life-
saving mental healthcare services, en-
hancing women veterans’ healthcare, 
providing housing assistance, and expe-
diting the delivery of benefits and care 
for those suffering from toxic exposure. 
Let me say this again. 
If we go to a 1-year continuing reso-
lution, that means we go off of last 
year’s budget, last year’s spending bill. 
We will block priorities like expanding 
access to mental health services for 
our veterans. We will block services for 
expanding women veterans’ healthcare. 
We will block services for housing as-
sistance and for expediting what is one 
of the most serious issues coming out 
of the conflict of 20 years in the Middle 
East, and that is care for those that are 
suffering from toxic exposure. 
The bottom line is this would keep 
the VA from properly addressing a 
whole host of issues on behalf of those 
who would put their lives on the line 
for this country, and they are going to 
continue to pay the price for us not 
doing our job. 
As chairman of the Defense Appro-
priations Subcommittee, I was able to 
draft a bill that provided a $31 billion 
increase for defense compared to last 
year. This military bill is consistent 
with the spending levels approved by

November 18, 2021 
the bill we are working on today. In 
fact, in an amendment offered by Sen-
ator INHOFE, that amendment passed 25 
to 1, which will plus-up this bill. 
So why isn’t the defense appropria-
tions bill flying through this Senate 
just like the NDAA? 
Well, I will tell you. In September, 
the Republicans on the Appropriations 
Committee announced they would vote 
against all appropriations bills in part 
because Senator INHOFE’s bill doesn’t 
increase defense with enough spending. 
So the idea here is, just take money 
and throw it at the wall and hope that 
it’s spent right. 
The bottom line is there needs to be 
plans and there needs to be planning. 
And I am going to tell you, the last 
time I checked, the $31 billion increase 
is a pretty good chunk of dough. 
So it is simple. Do we want to fund 
the VA? Do we want to fund the mili-
tary? Do we want to fund this coun-
try’s government? 
Or do we want to go back to last 
year’s funding? Which, by the way, 
would be totally inadequate, but it is 
what some on the other side of the 
aisle are advocating right now. 
Look, guys, we are in a continuing 
resolution right now. It expires on De-
cember 3. If, in fact, we had a budget 
deal today, we couldn’t get an omnibus 
out for nearly 5 weeks. 
So what I am saying is this: no more 
finger pointing, no more changing the 
rules of the game, no more foot drag-
ging. Do what the gang of 10 did on the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
package. 
Let’s go into negotiations to get to 
yes. Let’s all work together. Let’s not 
play irresponsible political games with 
our military and with our veterans and 
with everybody else who lives in this 
country. 
What are we here for? Are we here to 
advocate for this country? Or are we 
here to advocate for a political party? 
I am telling you the appropriations 
bills should have been done last Sep-
tember. We should be sitting at the 
table today. I am ready to roll up my 
sleeves and help in any way that I pos-
sibly can to make sure these bills get 
through this body and to the Presi-
dent’s desk so we can fund our veterans 
and fund the needs that they have, so 
we can fund our military and deal with 
the threats that are facing us around 
the world. 
It is time, folks. It is time to quit 
talking, and it is time to start doing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my 
fellow Senators: On November 4 of this 
year, I introduced an amendment to 
this year’s national defense bill. This 
amendment focuses on the Office of 
Net Assessment. That office is within 
the Pentagon. 
The Office of Net Assessment’s pur-
pose is to produce an annual net assess-
ment, which is a long-term look at our 
military capabilities and those of our 
greatest adversaries. 
In 2019, when I began to look at Ste-
fan Halper’s contracting work for the 
Office of Net Assessment, something 
didn’t look right. So I asked the in-
spector general to look into it. 
For those who are unaware, Halper 
was a central figure in the debunked 
Russia collusion investigation. And I 
don’t have to explain the Russia collu-
sion investigation; everybody in the 
U.S. Senate knows something about 
that and they know what it refers to. 
Halper secretly, at that time, re-
corded Trump campaign officials dur-
ing Crossfire Hurricane. 
Halper also received over 1 million 
taxpayer dollars from the Office of Net 
Assessment 
for 
several 
research 
projects. But the question is: Were 
they really research projects? 
But the inspector general found some 
problems with his contract: 
The Office of Net Assessment didn’t 
require Halper to submit evidence that 
he actually talked to the people he 
cited in his work, which included Rus-
sian intelligence officers. 
Secondly, the Office of Net Assess-
ment couldn’t provide sufficient docu-
mentation that Halper conducted all of 
his work in accordance with the law. 
Thirdly, the Office of Net Assessment 
didn’t maintain sufficient documents 
to comply with all of the Federal con-
tracting 
requirements 
and 
OMB’s 
guidelines. 
The inspector general also found that 
these 
problems 
weren’t 
unique 
to 
Halper’s contract. This is the inspector 
general speaking up on this. I am re-
porting what he said. So these findings 
indicate systemic issues within the Of-
fice of Net Assessment in the Pen-
tagon. 
Moreover, this office has spent tax-
payers’ money on research projects 
unconnected to net assessments. In 
other words, they are spending money 
and wasting money that doesn’t deal 
very closely with our national defense. 
Two cases in point: The office funded 
a report titled ‘‘On the Nature of 
Americans as a Warlike People: Work-
shop Report.’’ 
Now, that report highlighted the 
‘‘level of American belligerency which 
is the result of the persistence of 
Scotch-Irish culture in America.’’ 
That ought to get a lot of your atten-
tion. What does that have to do with 
the assessment of the capability of us 
to deliver on the constitutional respon-
sibility of the Federal Government to 
the defense of the American people? Or 
what does that have to do with our as-
sessing the capability of our enemies? 
Yet another report focused on Vladi-
mir Putin’s neurological development 
and potential Asperger’s diagnosis. 
Now, I have highlighted these reports 
for the Pentagon, and I have asked for 
records from the Office of Net Assess-
ment relating to some of its other 
work as well. To date, they still 
haven’t been able to provide all of the 
records that they ought to provide to 
the Congress of the United States, 
under 
our 
constitutional 
responsi-
bility, to see that money is faithfully 
spent according to congressional intent 
and that the laws are faithfully exe-
cuted. 
While the Office of Net Assessment 
was busy wasting taxpayers’ money 
and not responding to congressional re-
quests, China built its hypersonic mis-
sile program. 
Are we on top of that program? It has 
got something to do with our enemy’s 
capability. 
As a result of all of these failures, 
then, like I told you, I introduced my 
amendment to the defense bill on No-
vember 4. The amendment would re-
quire the Government Accountability 
Office to determine how much taxpayer 
money this unit actually uses for net 
assessment—the reason they were set 
up. 
Are they doing their job? Are they 
following the law? Are they spending 
the taxpayers’ money responsibly? 
I think I have shown, in some in-
stances, where they have not. 
The amendment would filter out tax-
payer-funded research that has nothing 
to do with net assessment. In other 
words, the Office of Net Assessment 
ought to be doing net assessment, and 
that deals with the capability of the 
U.S. Government to do the No. 1 re-
sponsibility of the Federal Govern-
ment: the national defense of the 
American people. 
The second responsibility of this 
Agency is to determine the capability 
of our enemies to do damage to us. In 
other words, it is time that we find out 
how much money the Office of Net As-
sessment needs to actually do its job 
instead of acting like a slush fund for 
irrelevant 
or 
political 
research 
projects. 
Of course, if this happens and the 
taxpayers’ money is spent properly, 
this, in turn, will save the taxpayers, 
potentially, millions of dollars a year. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
the amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, families 
back home in Texas are planning their 
Thanksgiving menus, but they are also 
bracing for steep grocery bills. Prices 
are up for just about every part of a 
typical Thanksgiving meal. The cost of 
a frozen turkey is the highest in his-
tory. Things like potatoes, butter, 
pumpkin pies, even salt, cost more 
than they did a year ago. 
It is not just going to cost more to 
eat; it is going to cost more to cook. 
Appliance 
prices 
have 
skyrocketed 
over the past year, as have electricity 
bills, and family members will have to

November 18, 2021 
pay a lot more just to visit their 
friends and relatives because gas prices 
are up 60 percent from last year. 
As families are being pummeled by 
higher prices and inflation, our Demo-
cratic colleagues are planning to hand 
major savings to a select group of 
Americans, just not the ones you think 
and certainly not the ones who need 
the help. 
Despite their cries of taxing the rich, 
the Democrats are plotting an abso-
lutely massive handout to the wealthi-
est Americans. This windfall is not dis-
tributed through stimulus checks or 
lower tax rates. That would be far too 
obvious. Instead, our Democratic col-
leagues are relying on a range of gim-
micky sunsets and expirations to dole 
out the millionaire tax break. 
If they thought no one would notice, 
well, they would be wrong. For exam-
ple, The Washington Post headline says 
it all. It reads: ‘‘The second-biggest 
program in the Democrats’ spending 
plan gives billions to the rich.’’ 
That is not how our colleagues have 
tried to brand their legislation. They 
would portray themselves as modern- 
day Robin Hoods—stealing from the 
rich to give to the poor. 
Strange in that it is really just the 
opposite. They talk about the wealthy 
paying their fair share and giving 
working families free programs, but 
the reality of the situation is far dif-
ferent from the picture they paint, and 
the wealthiest Americans stand to reap 
big benefits under this legislation. 
For example, the Democrats have in-
cluded a provision that will allow mil-
lionaires and billionaires in blue States 
to pay less in Federal taxes. As the 
headline notes, this handout comes 
with a big pricetag of $285 billion in tax 
breaks for the wealthiest Americans. It 
is more expensive than the clean en-
ergy and climate provisions in their 
bill; more expensive than paid family 
leave; more expensive than the com-
bined cost of the child tax credit and 
home-based services. 
And there is no denying that the 
beneficiaries 
of 
this 
ultraexpensive 
provision are the wealthiest Ameri-
cans. According to the Tax Policy Cen-
ter, about 70 percent of the benefit goes 
to the top 5 percent of wage earners— 
70 percent goes to the top 5 percent. 
That is people making more than 
$366,000 a year, roughly six times the 
median household income of Texans. 
We were not talking about saving a few 
dollars here and there. The top 1 per-
cent would save an average of $14,900 
next year, and the bottom 40 percent of 
taxpayers wouldn’t be given a dime’s 
worth of a break in their taxes. 
The rich in America who stand to 
gain the most from this change are 
those who live in blue States, like New 
York and California that have higher 
State and local taxes. They would, 
under this legislation, get to deduct up 
to $80,000 in their State and local taxes 
from next year’s Federal tax return, 
leaving everybody else to fill up the 
gap. 
Working families in Texas should not 
have to subsidize the tax bill for Man-
hattan millionaires. If the wealthiest 
people in New York or California think 
their State and local taxes are too 
high, there is a pretty simple solution: 
Tell your elected officials to cut taxes 
or you can do like many people are 
doing these days, vote with your feet 
and move to places like Texas. 
Over the last decade, Californians 
have flocked to my State by the hun-
dreds of thousands. People do vote with 
their feet, and they clearly support 
what we are doing in Texas. 
We have been happy to welcome folks 
from all around the country who are in 
search 
of 
lower 
taxes, 
affordable 
homes, and a better standard of living. 
Blue State millionaires can’t expect 
my constituents to subsidize their tax 
bills. They need to either pay their 
taxes or maybe they need to decide to 
move to someplace where they are not 
taxed at such a high rate. 
Under this bill, two-thirds of those 
making more than $1 million will re-
ceive a tax cut next year. Let me say 
that again. The vast majority of mil-
lionaires will, under the Democratic 
legislation, receive a tax break, and 
nearly 90 percent of those earning be-
tween $500,000 and $1 million will re-
ceive a tax cut. This is a sharp contrast 
from how middle-class working fami-
lies are treated. 
Less than a third of those earning be-
tween $20 and $100,000 a year will re-
ceive a significant tax cut. And the fol-
lowing year, 2023, those savings dra-
matically decrease. 
Year over year, the tax provisions in 
this bill change dramatically. In fact, 
there is not a single year over the next 
decade in which each tax provision will 
be used at the same time. 
Democrats aren’t rewriting the Tax 
Code to make millionaires pay their 
fair share; they are gaming it to create 
the illusion of fairness. 
Some programs begin immediately 
and end after 1 year. Some don’t even 
take effect for a couple of years. These 
are plain budgetary gimmicks. After 
all, they can’t afford to give billion-
aires a tax break and dole out in-
creased social welfare programs. The 
fact of the matter is, the millionaire 
tax break in their legislation is the 
largest handout for wealthy Ameri-
cans. But it is not the only one in the 
bill. 
This legislation would allow people 
earning hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars to receive up to $12,500 from the 
taxpayers if they buy an electric vehi-
cle. They also can receive up to $900 to 
purchase an e-bike, which is obviously 
less green than a good old-fashioned 
regular bike. 
The Democrats’ reckless tax-and- 
spending bill also creates handouts for 
union bosses, trials lawyers, wealthy 
media corporations, and a host of pow-
erful friends of the Democratic Party. 
All of these handouts may appease 
some of our colleagues’ wealthiest sup-
porters, but it will only make life hard-
er for working families. 
Families earning just over the me-
dian household income, which is just 
under $62,000 in Texas, could see their 
childcare costs soar by as much as 
$13,000. 
And the climate policies in this bill 
are sure to drive energy prices even 
higher. Gasoline already costs 60 per-
cent more today than it did a year ago. 
That is a combination of inflation and 
the policies of this administration 
which attack the very energy industry 
that we depend upon to provide afford-
able energy. 
If the Democrats manage to get this 
grab bag of radical climate policies 
signed into law, prices at the pump will 
go even higher. 
So this bill will not, as advertised, 
help America to build back better. It 
will ensure that we never reach the 
prepandemic recovery that was the 
envy of the world. 
No public relations campaign can 
hide the truth about this bill. This is a 
reckless tax-and-spending spree that 
will benefit the wealthiest of Ameri-
cans at the cost of working families. 
The last thing we need to do is to 
line the pockets of wealthy Americans 
while driving up the costs of the middle 
class. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3243 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this is now 
the 17th time I have come to the Sen-
ate Chamber specifically to speak 
against President Biden’s vaccine man-
date. 
I have pledged before, and I pledge 
again today, to continue this fight 
until we beat the mandate. 
Now, thankfully, progress has been 
made on this front. The U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit last week 
halted 
enforcement 
of 
President 
Biden’s general mandate. It did so di-
recting their rulings specifically to the 
OSHA portion of the mandate. This is 
the one that applies to all workers ev-
erywhere and any place of employment 
with more than 100 workers. 
I, along with millions of Americans, 
am grateful that the U.S. court system 
performed its role in protecting the 
separation of powers and otherwise 
protecting the limits on government 
written into our laws and our Constitu-
tion. 
It is also encouraging to see the gov-
ernment Agency charged with enforc-
ing the general mandate; that is, 
OSHA, has now halted the enforcement 
of the mandate and is complying with 
the order issued by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
This, however, does not end Presi-
dent Biden’s vaccine mandates. That

mandate in particular remains the sub-
ject of ongoing litigation, and there are 
other requirements placed on other 
specific groups of workers outside of 
the OSHA mandate and, therefore, out-
side the scope of the order issued by 
the Fifth Circuit. 
Now, I have spoken previously on the 
situation that members of our Armed 
Forces face and on things that people 
who work in the healthcare profession 
face—difficult 
things, 
challenging 
things, things that threaten their live-
lihoods and cause a lot of problems for 
workers. 
I have offered various bills to help 
those groups of Americans keep their 
jobs and make sure that they have the 
right to make their own medical deci-
sions. 
I am fighting against the mandate. I 
am not fighting against the vaccines. I 
support the vaccines. I am vaccinated. 
I have encouraged others to be vac-
cinated. I see the development of these 
vaccines as something of a modern 
medical miracle, one that is protecting 
so many millions of Americans from 
the harms of COVID. 
But this one-size-fits-all dictate from 
Washington certainly isn’t the answer 
and, under our system of government, 
can’t be. I have heard from hundreds of 
Utahns who are personally at risk of 
losing their jobs and their livelihoods 
due to this mandate. Many of these 
Utahns have religious or health con-
cerns about the vaccine. 
President Biden promised these man-
dates would include exemptions for 
those people in those categories spe-
cifically, but in reality they are being 
dismissed or placed on unpaid leave or 
pushed into retirement with reduced 
benefits. 
These are good people, everyday peo-
ple. 
Many 
are 
dedicated 
frontline 
workers. Far too many are just trying 
to make ends meet and feed their fami-
lies. It shouldn’t be too much to ask to 
allow them to continue doing that 
unencumbered by their own govern-
ment in their efforts to do that. 
These mandates will just push people 
out of work and make many of them 
not only unemployed but unemployable 
outcasts in their chosen professions, 
professions for which they have spent 
years studying and learning and receiv-
ing certifications just in order to work. 
What a tragedy. 
This wouldn’t just harm those af-
fected directly by the mandates. It ab-
solutely would harm those directly af-
fected by them, but the harm extends 
much further than those directly af-
fected. It would affect all of us, in fact. 
The American economy is currently 
facing a labor shortage the likes of 
which we haven’t seen in decades. Busi-
nesses across the country are strug-
gling to find enough workers just to 
keep 
their 
doors 
open, 
let 
alone 
produce and serve at full efficiency. 
President Biden’s mandate will add to 
our high unemployment and our low 
labor force participation rates, and it 
will put even more pressure on infla-
tion—inflation that is making it hard-
er for Americans everywhere, espe-
cially the poor and middle-class Ameri-
cans, people living paycheck to pay-
check who find that every dollar they 
earn is buying less of everything, from 
gas to groceries, from housing to 
healthcare. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Pow-
ell recently warned that ‘‘hiring dif-
ficulties and other constraints could 
continue to limit how quickly supply 
can adjust, raising the possibility that 
inflation could turn out to be higher 
and more persistent than we expected.’’ 
The mandate is only worsening the 
problem. 
Now, I believe the Biden administra-
tion recognizes the harms this mandate 
will cause for our workforce. It is evi-
dent in the administration’s date of 
compliance extension to January 4 
that this is the case. 
Now, I have to ask an obvious ques-
tion here—or one that I think should 
be obvious, should be intuitive. If the 
forced vaccination of our entire Fed-
eral workforce, including employees 
and contractors and subcontractors—if 
forcing the vaccination of every one of 
these workers—were truly an emer-
gency so drastic that all workers, con-
tractors, 
and 
subcontractors, 
even 
those working remotely in their own 
homes, must be vaccinated imme-
diately, then why would they risk de-
laying compliance? 
They can’t have it both ways. If they 
want to say that this is an emergency; 
this is dire, so dire that we have to 
force every contractor, subcontractor, 
and Federal employee to get vac-
cinated immediately and we have to 
fire them if they don’t—if that is truly 
so emergent—then why delay it to Jan-
uary 4? Why delay it at all? 
Now, to be sure, it would be bad. And, 
to be sure, I am glad they have ex-
tended it. Perhaps, maybe, this means 
they are reconsidering this awful, hor-
rible step, this horrible thing that they 
are inflicting on those who can least 
afford to absorb something like this. 
But it really does undercut the emer-
gent nature of the situation, and it un-
dercuts 
their 
underlying 
reasoning 
that this has to happen immediately, 
so immediately that we have to fire all 
of them if they won’t submit to Presi-
dential medical orthodoxy. 
This mandate is even so drastic that 
it includes all workers and all contrac-
tors, including all those who work re-
motely, who don’t even go into a work-
place. And it also includes even those 
who have natural immunity from a 
previous case of COVID–19, something 
that some studies have indicated will 
provide 27 times the immunity of a 
vaccine. 
Again, vaccines are great. I have 
been vaccinated. I have encouraged 
others to do the same. Vaccines are 
protecting hundreds of millions of 
Americans right now. But why not 
take into account their natural immu-
nity, and why on earth would you fire 
someone who already has natural im-
munity or who works from home? That 
makes absolutely no sense. 
This mandate simply goes far beyond 
what is reasonable. It begs all sorts of 
questions. Why are you doing this? 
So, today, I am offering a bill to help 
another group—yet another group of 
people—a group consisting of people 
not protected by the Fifth Circuit’s 
halting of the general vaccine man-
date. Federal workers are still facing a 
vaccine requirement from the Biden 
administration. Almost 3 million work-
ers in this country are employed by the 
Federal Government. Many of them 
have reached out to me and my office 
and are concerned about losing their 
jobs due to this mandate. I know I am 
not the only one. I know that every 
single Member of this body has re-
ceived phone calls, letters, emails, and 
other pleas for help from people who 
don’t want to lose their jobs. 
This is a response to them. This is an 
effort to try to help them and part of 
my ongoing effort to reemphasize the 
fact that it doesn’t have to be this way. 
My bill, the Protecting Our Federal 
Workforce from Forced COVID–19 Vac-
cination Act, would prohibit an execu-
tive Agency from requiring its employ-
ees to receive a COVID–19 vaccine. It is 
a simple solution to prevent more un-
employment and to protect countless 
Americans from being forced out of the 
workforce. 
This bill will help protect Americans’ 
right to make their own medical deci-
sions and will help protect our econ-
omy as it strains under multiple crises 
and as the holiday season comes 
around. 
I encourage and sincerely implore all 
of my colleagues to support it. 
To that end, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 3243, which is at the desk. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Is there objection? 
Mr. PETERS. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, in an 
ideal world we would not need a vac-
cine mandate. In the ideal world the 
vast majority of people who can get 
vaccinated would heed the advice of 
scientists and of public health officials 
and take the very simple step to get 
vaccinated so that we can get this pan-
demic under control. 
But, unfortunately, our reality is 
very different. We have been working 
to contain this virus and manage this 
unprecedented health crisis for nearly 2 
years now. It has cost us more than 
765,000 American lives, and millions of 
other Americans have been infected 
and may face lifelong health challenges 
as a result.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8421 
November 18, 2021 
It doesn’t have to be this way. We 
have safe, effective, and lifesaving vac-
cines that are now, thankfully, avail-
able to a significant number of Ameri-
cans. 
Vaccines are our best tool to finally 
get this pandemic under control, and 
requiring the folks who are able to get 
vaccinated is just simply common 
sense. We are all tired of this pan-
demic, and we all want it to end. We 
are tired of wearing masks because 
some folks refuse to get vaccinated. We 
are tired of wondering if we could un-
knowingly be exposing our vulnerable 
family members who are taking every 
precaution. We are tired of waiting for 
enough people to get vaccinated so 
that our schools and our businesses and 
our daily lives can just get back to nor-
mal. 
And we are tired of emergency rooms 
and healthcare workers getting over-
run by COVID cases from people who 
are not vaccinated, when we already 
have the best tool to prevent the 
spread in the first place. Our frontline 
healthcare workers are being crushed 
by the consistently high number of 
cases, and public health experts are 
predicting that yet another spike will 
likely hit this winter unless people get 
vaccinated. 
In my home State of Michigan, the 
number of unvaccinated patients hos-
pitalized with COVID is once again 
climbing. A headline from today noted 
that Michigan has just reached a new 
pandemic 
record 
with 
the 
highest 
COVID case average in the Nation and 
that deaths across the State continue 
to rise. Emergency rooms are packed, 
and in some areas patients are forced 
to wait for hours or for days to be ad-
mitted. 
There is one key factor that is driv-
ing this horrific scenario: 88 percent of 
the cases, 88 percent of the hospitaliza-
tions, and 88 percent of the tragic 
deaths 
were 
all 
people 
who 
were 
unvaccinated. 
We can put an end to this nightmare 
by getting more Americans vaccinated. 
You know, we require so many pre-
ventive measures to keep ourselves and 
others safe. We wear seatbelts in our 
cars. We require hardhats on construc-
tion sites. We get vaccinated to protect 
ourselves against a whole number of 
health risks. And we do it because we 
know it saves lives and it keeps people 
healthy. 
The answer is simple: Get vaccinated. 
Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the thoughtful remarks and the in-
sights of my friend and distinguished 
colleague the Senator from Michigan. 
He is someone with whom I enjoy 
working, and one of the many things I 
appreciate about him is that he puts a 
lot of thought into everything he does. 
And I have always known him to be 
considerate, and I appreciate that 
about him. 
I also am in agreement with the fact 
that in an ideal world people would be 
getting vaccinated more than they are. 
And in that world, if more people got 
vaccinated, I do think there would be 
fewer hospitalizations, fewer deaths, 
and fewer COVID infections. And there 
are a lot of data sources supporting 
that. 
I also agree that we are all tired as a 
country, as individuals, as families, re-
gardless of what State we live in. We 
are tired of the pandemic, of the ERs 
being overcrowded, and things like 
that. These are all things we want to 
do away with. And I also agree with my 
colleague from Michigan that those 
things really would be alleviated if 
more people got vaccinated. 
In my mind, the question that we are 
discussing here isn’t about a disagree-
ment over the objectives that we have 
got; it is more about how to get there, 
who has authority to take what action 
and what consequences might attach to 
government actions. 
Notwithstanding the fact that my 
friend from Michigan and I both agree 
that the American people, to the ex-
tent they have been vaccinated, are 
benefiting as a whole from being vac-
cinated, it doesn’t mean that everyone 
is going to agree. 
It doesn’t get rid of disagreements 
that exist, in some cases, because of 
our religious belief or other moral con-
viction—one that I don’t happen to 
share and probably most of us in this 
body don’t happen to share, but that 
some people have. 
There are some people who, for reli-
gious or moral reasons, believe that 
they shouldn’t be vaccinated. There are 
others who have a specific medical con-
dition that has involved receiving med-
ical advice from board-certified med-
ical doctors that someone shouldn’t get 
this particular vaccine. 
I am not a doctor. I am not a sci-
entist. I don’t purport to understand 
these things. But I do know what I hear 
from Utahns, which is that a number of 
them have cited medical conditions of 
one sort or another; previous personal 
or family medical history that has sig-
naled particular sensitivity to vaccines 
in general; or, in some cases, when peo-
ple have autoimmune conditions of one 
sort or another or a combination of 
them. 
In some cases, doctors are concerned 
about inflaming that condition, in-
flaming the immune system of par-
ticular patients, and on that basis ad-
vise their patients with particular, 
somewhat unusual medical histories 
not to be vaccinated. 
There are others, still, who might 
not fit into either of these categories, 
but might consist of people who have 
already had the coronavirus and have 
recovered from it at some point over 
the last 18 months. 
There are studies indicating that 
natural immunity is real, and that 
have suggested that natural immunity 
can convey comparable immunity to 
that available under the vaccine. Some 
of the studies have indicated that that 
immunity could not only be as strong 
as, but, in some cases, 27 times strong-
er than that conferred by the vaccine. 
I had both. I had the coronavirus over 
a year ago and I still chose to be vac-
cinated in addition to that. My own ex-
perience with the coronavirus wasn’t 
all that pleasant. It wasn’t an experi-
ence that I care to relive. In consulta-
tion with my doctor, I concluded that 
it was a good thing for me to get it. I 
was willing to get it, especially upon 
learning that it might help protect me 
even further if I also had the vaccine in 
addition to having natural immunity. 
But, you know, not everyone is going 
to reach the same conclusions. And one 
of the struggles that we have had as a 
country involves difficult questions 
that people face when they disagree— 
when they have a genuine disagree-
ment. We have to be careful about how 
we use government power because the 
government power necessarily involves 
the use of force. 
Most of the time, mercifully, it 
doesn’t have to involve the direct ac-
tual use of force. It can involve the im-
plicit or implied or future or prospec-
tive use of force. In other words, you 
comply with this or that law or regula-
tion or government dictate of one sort 
of another, then you are fine. If you 
don’t, you know that at some point 
there will be consequences. 
A lot of people comply voluntarily 
after they received—I don’t know—a 
notice from a law enforcement officer 
or agent. Or maybe they wait until 
someone has sued them, and then they 
get a court order. But they know that 
at some point, if they refuse to comply, 
the government can enforce what it is 
requiring. 
So whenever we involve government 
in these kinds of decisions, we have to 
be able to defend the actual or threat-
ened or potential use of force in order 
to justify what we are doing. And we 
have to ask: Is this moral? Is this an 
appropriate case to use violence? 
Because if it is not an appropriate 
case to use violence for something, 
there is kind of a problem with putting 
government into the equation, because 
ultimately you have to rely on govern-
ment to be willing to threaten violence 
and carry out violence; meaning to 
show up at somebody’s house with a 
summons, an arrest warrant, or some-
thing like that and take them away. 
All that involves force. And again, 
mercifully, most of the time it doesn’t 
have to come to that. Most of the time, 
Americans, you know, comply with the 
law just because it is a good thing to 
comply with the law. 
But we really should ask the ques-
tion whether a government action is 
morally justified in any circumstance 
to such a degree that the use of vio-
lence would be warranted if it came to 
that. 
I struggle to accept the proposition 
that it is OK to use violence to force 
someone to get a COVID–19 vaccine. As

S8422 
November 18, 2021 
much as I love the fact that the vac-
cines are available and are a real bless-
ing—something of a modern medical 
miracle—I can’t get comfortable with 
the idea of using violence to force peo-
ple, who have another opinion, to com-
ply. 
It seems morally problematic and 
morally unjustified—for that matter, 
indefensible—for the government to 
tell someone, ‘‘If you don’t get this 
shot, you will get fired;’’ and, in fact, 
to tell their employer, ‘‘You must fire 
this person if this person doesn’t get 
the vaccine, even if this person has a 
good-faith religious belief against it, 
even if this person has natural immu-
nity or has some particular medical 
condition causing his or her board-cer-
tified medical doctor to advise against 
receiving the jab.’’ 
That isn’t moral to say to that per-
son, ‘‘You didn’t comply with a Presi-
dential medical edict, so you are 
fired;’’ and to tell the employer, ‘‘If 
you don’t fire that person, you are 
going to be the subject of punitive fines 
that will cripple any business.’’ 
And I literally mean any business. I 
don’t think there is a business in 
America subject to these mandates 
that could survive the crippling, delib-
erately cruel fines that are levied 
under them—not a one. 
This isn’t right. It is not moral. Deep 
down we know it. 
In fact, according to a recent poll 
conducted and reported by Axios— 
hardly a rightwing publication—it in-
volved a question, and the poll ques-
tion was something along the lines of: 
Should a person who declines to be vac-
cinated be fired for not being vac-
cinated? 
And 14 percent agreed that that is 
OK—14 percent. Only 14 out of 100 
Americans said: Yeah, that makes 
sense, that is OK; fire this person, fire 
him, fire her. They don’t matter. 
It is compounded when you look at 
the tragedies imposed by the individual 
circumstances. The soldier; the sailor; 
the airman; the marine; the TSA work-
er; the Federal contractor; the em-
ployee of a subcontractor of a company 
with one Federal contract who does 
mostly non-Federal work; the mom, 
the dad working in a factory, in a 
school, in a floral shop—if any of those 
either have a Federal contract or have 
more than 99 employees, all of those 
people are having their livelihoods 
threatened. 
It is not just a job. It is, in many 
cases—as is the case in the healthcare 
industry, for example—people who have 
spent a lifetime acquiring the skills 
and professional certifications, the de-
grees, the training, the education nec-
essary in order to participate in that 
profession. 
Many of these people, by the way, 
throughout the darkest hours of the 
pandemic, were the people working 
hardest to protect Americans, to make 
sure they had access to the healthcare 
they needed. 
Those same people are now being 
told: You are not good enough. You 
don’t deserve a job. You are going to be 
fired, even if you have a medical condi-
tion that precludes it. 
Even if this could be morally justi-
fied, which it can’t, one must ask the 
question asked by the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Fifth Circuit: Does Con-
gress, does the Federal Government, 
have the power to order such a wide-
spread vaccine mandate? 
It doesn’t. 
The OSHA mandate, for example, 
constitutionally, it would have to be 
predicated 
on 
Congress’s 
authority 
under the Commerce Clause, which 
gives us the power to regulate trade or 
commerce between the States, with 
foreign nations, and with the Indian 
Tribes. 
Even as that provision of the Con-
stitution has been interpreted really 
broadly since 1937—even under that 
broad interpretation, one that has seen 
only three acts of Congress over the 
last 84 years being deemed outside of 
Congress’s authority under the Com-
merce Clause—when you have to al-
most try hard to pass legislation predi-
cated on Commerce Clause authority 
that doesn’t fall within it, but even 
under that, this doesn’t pass the test. 
It is not, by its nature, economic ac-
tivity. In fact, it is not activity. You 
are punishing nonactivity. 
Even under these high watermark 
precedents from the New Deal era es-
tablishing a very deferential standard 
of review for exercises of Commerce 
Clause authority by Congress, this 
doesn’t even pass that. And even if it 
did, which it doesn’t, you would still 
have to identify the case of the OSHA 
mandate a definable delegation of au-
thority from Commerce using some in-
telligible principle authorizing this 
kind of action. 
You will not find that. It is not there. 
I have reviewed upside down, sideways, 
backwards, forwards the statutory text 
at issue with regard to OSHA. It does 
not provide this authority. The moral 
authority is lacking. The constitu-
tional authority is lacking. There is no 
power delegated by the Congress to 
OSHA to do this. It is not defensible. 
I am glad that delays on some of 
these mandates have been imposed. I 
am glad that OSHA is at least agreeing 
to comply with the order of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; 
and, at least for the duration of that 
litigation, enforcement will be halted. 
I hope and I fully expect that the ul-
timate resolution of that case will be 
consistent with what the Fifth Circuit 
ruled last week. In fact, I have little 
doubt that it will be. 
This is, in some ways, the most bra-
zen act of Presidential overreach that 
we have seen in a single directive, since 
President Harry Truman, on April 8, 
1952, issued an order seizing every steel 
mill in the United States for steel pro-
duction related to the Korean war ef-
fort. Mercifully, the U.S. Supreme 
Court was able to intervene and, within 
a couple of months, invalidated that 
action. 
This one is even clearer than that; 
but, more importantly, this one is 
more 
emotionally 
compelling 
than 
that. 
That unconstitutional act of Presi-
dential overreach affected a handful of 
steel companies. It certainly affected 
thousands upon thousands of workers. 
It didn’t have the ability to affect di-
rectly or indirectly every single man, 
woman, and child in America. This one 
does. 
That is one of the reasons why these 
moral and statutory and constitutional 
questions matter so much. That is why 
I have been coming to the floor every 
day, and why I will continue to do so 
indefinitely as long as it takes. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of Native Amer-
ican Heritage Month. As a Senator 
from Washington State, I am proud to 
represent 
29 
federally 
recognized 
Tribes. 
In Washington, we understand the 
importance of the sovereignty of Tribal 
Governments. And anyone who knows 
me knows, I believe a commitment is 
more than just words. It is about ac-
tion. 
At the start of this year, when we 
passed the American Rescue Plan to 
get America up and running again, it 
was the single largest Federal invest-
ment in Tribes ever—more than $32 bil-
lion for Tribal Nations. 
Since then, I have spoken to many 
Tribal leaders in Washington State 
about what this has meant for our 
Tribal communities. 
A housing grant to the Muckleshoot 
Indian Tribe helped provide homes for 
an additional 25 families. 
The Lummi Nation created new op-
portunities for education and job re-
training. 
The American Rescue Plan helped 
the Tulalip keep Tulalip-owned busi-
nesses, who have been struggling since 
the pandemic, afloat. 
Action 
on 
our 
commitment 
has 
helped Tribal members in my home 
State stay housed, get back to work, 
keep their small businesses open, and 
continues to make a difference in a 
thousand different ways. 
Now, these outcomes weren’t inevi-
table. They happened because of inten-
tional and specific policy decisions this

Congress made to support Tribal Na-
tions. 
So if we are serious about showing a 
real commitment to Tribal commu-
nities during Native American Herit-
age Month, then we need to continue to 
prioritize Tribal communities in all of 
our policymaking. 
Infrastructure in Indian Country—ev-
erything from roads to bridges, to 
broadband—has been underfunded for 
too long. The bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, which is now signed into law, will 
make $13 billion in direct investments 
in Indian Country, with tens of billions 
more in Federal grants and future 
funding opportunities. This will mean 
clean drinking water, access to high- 
speed internet, transit to connect com-
munities, and more. 
Now we have another opportunity to 
show our commitment to Tribal com-
munities with the Build Back Better 
Act. Just like everywhere else in this 
country, childcare is a crisis for Native 
communities. Right now, about one out 
of every four Native Americans in this 
country is experiencing poverty. That 
is higher than any other group. So 
when 1 in 10 Native American parents 
have to quit or change their job be-
cause 
they 
can’t 
find 
or 
afford 
childcare, we are making a tough situ-
ation worse. 
My childcare proposal in Build Back 
Better is going to cut the cost of 
childcare by thousands for Tribal fami-
lies—with many paying nothing at all 
for childcare—and it is going to help 
get more slots open everywhere we 
need them, so parents won’t be stuck 
on waiting lists for months on end. 
It is our government’s duty to make 
investments like this one in Indian 
Country because if we really believe in 
Tribal sovereignty and acknowledging 
the role our government has played in 
centuries of persecution Native peoples 
in this country have faced, we must 
also take action to create real oppor-
tunity for people; action on quality, af-
fordable childcare, housing, home care, 
and more. 
Build Back Better is going to make a 
big difference for Native communities, 
but there is more we need to do to ad-
dress the specific needs of Native com-
munities. 
We 
have 
to 
build 
on 
President 
Biden’s Executive action to address the 
epidemic of missing or murdered indig-
enous peoples, especially to protect Na-
tive women and girls. We must reau-
thorize the Violence Against Women 
Act and strengthen that legislation to 
empower Tribal Nations to hold per-
petrators of crimes committed on Trib-
al lands accountable. And living up to 
our commitments is also about rep-
resentation and a seat at the table. 
I was overjoyed to strongly support 
the confirmation of Deb Haaland, who 
is already blazing a trail as a historic 
Secretary of the Interior and a power-
ful voice for Tribal interests. 
I was proud to recommend Lauren 
King, a citizen of the Muscogee Nation 
and a Tribal law expert to serve a life-
time appointment as a Federal court 
judge in Washington State—the first 
Native American Federal judge in my 
State’s history and just the sixth ever 
in American history. And I am glad to 
see more than 50 Native Americans 
serving 
in 
key 
political 
positions 
throughout the Biden administration. I 
look forward to seeing many more. 
So, on this Native American Heritage 
Month, let’s resolve to build on the im-
portant work this Congress has done so 
far to support our Native communities. 
As a voice for Washington State 
Tribes in the U.S. Senate, I will always 
advocate for Indian Country and fight 
to ensure the Federal Government lives 
up to its sacred commitment to indige-
nous people across the country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this 
week, for the fifth month in a row—and 
the Presiding Officer has been standing 
with us on this important issue—par-
ents in Ohio and Maryland and all over 
the country, once again, see $250 or $300 
or, if they have two children, $600 in 
tax cuts directly into their bank ac-
counts. 
Think about this: 90 percent of Ohio 
children, this year, will have at least a 
$3,000 tax cut, not a deduction. This is 
real money in people’s pockets. This is 
90 percent of Ohio families who will get 
at least a $3,000 tax cut, and that is if 
they have one child. If they have more, 
they will get a bigger tax cut. 
You know, we know how hard parents 
work at their jobs and at raising their 
kids. Any parent knows how much 
work it is to take care of children, es-
pecially young children. It has gotten 
only harder and harder over the last 
year and a half. 
I hear some of my colleagues, espe-
cially on that side of the aisle, say— 
you know, they forget what hard work 
it is to raise children. And I watched 
what we were able to do on this with 
the chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, who just walked in, Senator 
WYDEN, and his leadership on this larg-
est tax cut for working families in my 
lifetime. 
So often, we know hard work doesn’t 
pay off. Think about the past few dec-
ades: The stock market went up; pro-
ductivity went up; executive com-
pensation has been stratospheric; yet, 
essentially, wages for most workers in 
this country have been flat. 
And you know how expensive it is to 
raise kids. Healthcare, school lunches, 
diapers, 
clothes, 
school 
supplies, 
braces, sports’ fees, camp fees—the list 
never seems to end. And one of the big-
gest expenses for so many families is 
childcare. So parents feel like they are 
stuck. The more they work, the more 
expensive childcare gets. 
One of the reasons that people 
haven’t returned to the workplace as 
much as some academicians or some 
professors or somebody predicted—it is 
not because we were providing unem-
ployment 
compensation. 
That 
just 
kept them alive. It is because they 
can’t find affordable, accessible, safe 
childcare. So that is why parents feel 
like they are stuck. It is why we passed 
the child tax credit—as I said, the larg-
est tax cut for working families ever. It 
is about finally, finally making hard 
work pay off so you can keep up with 
the cost of raising a family. 
One of the joys of this job—and I 
know that the Senator from Oregon 
and the Senator from Maryland share 
this because they do things like this— 
is we put on our website: What does the 
monthly child tax credit mean to you? 
We started this in July. We voted on 
it, on this floor, on March 6. Five days 
later, President Biden signed the law. 
We all went to talk to Secretary Yellen 
about getting these checks out quick-
ly. On July 15, 4 months after we voted 
for it—not even 4. Help me with my 
math. Three months after we voted for 
it, these checks started showing up. 
In my State, it was 2.1 million checks 
that went out. There were 2.1 million 
individuals who got this child tax cred-
it—you know, a million-and-some fam-
ilies because, obviously, some have 
more than one child in a family in 
many cases. Then they got a check on 
August 15; September 15; in October; 
and just this week, on November 15. 
We know it cut the rate of child pov-
erty by 40 percent. We also know that 
it helped families with school expenses 
or with, maybe, putting a little bit of 
money aside for Bowie State or Stark 
State, a community college in Ohio. 
Maybe it was just a way that fami-
lies—I mean, we know how there are so 
many families who are really anxious 
at the end of the month. Maybe we 
don’t talk to enough families like this 
around here, but for families who are 
anxious at the end of the month, get-
ting this $200 or $300 or $600 check in 
the middle of the month relieves the 
anxiety so many families have just to 
pay the rent because we know so many 
families, in that last week of the 
month, cut back on food a little bit, 
cut back on trying to figure out a way 
to get through the month so they can 
pay their rent at the beginning of the 
next month. 
So, on this website, when we ask peo-
ple what this means to you, we just get 
the most wonderful stories. 
Lisa said the tax cuts help her afford 
‘‘diapers and school supplies . . . and 
[now] we [can] put a little into starting 
a 529 college fund.’’ It is so exciting. 
Now we can finally ‘‘save for edu-
cation.’’ 
Lin from Columbus: ‘‘It kicked in 
right at a time when kid birthdays 
were happening for us, plus back to

school shopping, and several unex-
pected vehicle repairs were needed as 
well—it’s made a very helpful impact.’’ 
The Presiding Officer, Senator VAN 
HOLLEN, sits on the Banking and Hous-
ing Committee with me. He knows 
that, before the pandemic, 25 percent of 
renters in this country paid more than 
half of their income in rent, and if one 
thing goes wrong—your car breaks 
down; you get sick; your child gets 
sick; you miss a few days of work—you 
can be evicted. This will stop that from 
happening in many cases. 
Jeff from Cincinnati said it helps him 
afford ‘‘car insurance for a 17-year- 
old,’’ a 17-year-old who has a part-time 
job after school. 
The story we hear over and over is 
how expensive childcare is, how par-
ents use this money to afford childcare 
so they can go back to work or, maybe, 
work more hours than they are work-
ing. 
CeCe said her tax cut helps her pay 
for daycare. ‘‘Daycare is the same 
amount as my mortgage payment for 4 
days a week! So this is so, so helpful,’’ 
she said. 
Sarah said: ‘‘It has been critical as I 
started my unpaid maternity leave at 
the end of July.’’ 
I mean, we want people to be able to 
give birth and then stay with their 
child, their newborn, for a period of 
time. Many, many, many people in Bal-
timore, in Cleveland, in Portland don’t 
have any kind of leave—and how im-
portant it is that they can, maybe, 
stay a little longer with a newborn 
child and bond with her or him. 
Courtney, from Athens, near the 
Ohio River, said the CTC is ‘‘slightly 
more than half the cost of part time 
daycare tuition per month—much ap-
preciated help getting kiddo back into 
childcare and keeping [my husband and 
me] in the workforce.’’ 
These tax cuts mean more parents 
can afford to work and can afford to 
keep up with the extra cost of raising 
kids. 
When these tax cuts are fundamen-
tally stripped down from everything 
else, it is about the dignity of work. 
All work has dignity, whether you 
punch a clock or swipe a badge; wheth-
er you work for tips; whether you are 
on salary; whether you are raising chil-
dren or caring for an aging parent. 
Raising children is work. We never 
should forget that: raising children is 
work. 
It is a hell of a lot more work than 
moving money from one overseas bank 
account to another, as this body falls 
all over itself over the years giving tax 
cuts to rich people. 
It didn’t stop Senator MCCONNELL 
from rewarding the wealthiest CEOs 
and hedge fund managers and Swiss 
bank account holders. We remember 
what happened. When they did their 
tax cut 4 years ago, everybody in our— 
I mean, look at the difference. Four 
years ago, they passed the tax cut. You 
could see the lobbyists lined up in the 
hall outside Senator MCCONNELL’s of-
fice. Four years ago, we passed the tax 
cut. Almost all Republicans voted yes; 
almost all Democrats voted no. Sev-
enty percent of that tax cut went to 
the richest 1 percent. 
Earlier this year, we passed the larg-
est tax cut for working families every-
where. Everybody on this side voted 
yes; everybody on that side voted no. I 
mean, whose side are you on? Appar-
ently, we know that. Senator MCCON-
NELL and his crowd—they are always 
for the billionaires, they are always for 
giving more tax cuts, while Senator 
WYDEN and the Finance Committee are 
fighting for middle-class tax cuts. 
They then promised—and we all 
heard this—they promised that these 
big tax cuts for billionaires would 
trickle down, and they would hire more 
people, and they would pay higher 
wages, and the economy would grow. 
Well, it didn’t exactly work that way. 
They kept so much of it for them-
selves. They spent that money on stock 
buybacks, and we know what happened 
then. 
So the question is, Do you want tax 
cuts for billionaires and corporations 
or do you want tax cuts for working 
families? We want tax cuts for working 
families, and so do Americans from all 
over the country overwhelmingly from 
all kinds of backgrounds, from Chil-
licothe to Xenia, to Springfield, to 
Portsmouth, to Ravenna—all over the 
country. 
Every single month now, we are 
showing parents and workers we are on 
your side. We will not stop fighting to 
make sure parents’ hard work pays off 
for years to come. 
The child tax credit—we will make it 
permanent. It may not be this year, 
but we will make it permanent. As 
Senator WYDEN has said, it will become 
a lot like Social Security. It will be 
transformational. Americans will love 
it the way Americans have gotten used 
to and depend on and love Social Secu-
rity. It is part of who we are as a na-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a few 
moments, I intend to put forward a re-
quest for the Senate to take up and ap-
prove the nomination of a very special 
Oregonian; that is, my friend Chuck 
Sams, President Biden’s choice to lead 
the extraordinarily important National 
Park Service. I am just going to take a 
few minutes to talk about Chuck Sams 
and make sure the Senate understands 
why this is the right person for this 
very important job. 
First of all, I would say to the Sen-
ate, we have heard the national parks 
described as America’s best idea. That 
is because they form a network of 
treasures that no other country can 
match. But the fact is, the National 
Park Service is not only about the 
views and the photo-ops; the Director 
of the National Park Service is in 
charge of an organization of over 22,000 
employees and almost a quarter-mil-
lion volunteers. The Park Service gen-
erates tens of billions of dollars of eco-
nomic activity. The people of my 
State, Oregonians from one corner of 
the State to the other, particularly un-
derstand how critical outdoor treasures 
are for rural economies and rural jobs. 
There are park units in every State 
in 
the 
Nation—urban 
parks, 
rural 
parks, historic American buildings, an-
cient archeological sites. And the per-
sonnel at the Park Service—what in-
credible people. They do it all, from 
education to preservation to mainte-
nance, and they are also now doing 
more resilience against wildfires. 
That is why it is so important we 
have strong leadership at the National 
Park Service, because when you have 
employees taking on such diversified 
challenges and you have the Park Serv-
ice woven into the fabric of every State 
and so many communities, you need 
somebody at the top, the leader, to be 
capable and ready to take on these 
enormous challenges. Chuck Sams is 
that person, there is no question about 
it. 
I want the Senate to know that I 
have known Chuck Sams for years, and 
I have personally seen in action his 
dedication to communities and to the 
outdoors. He has been a longtime 
Umatilla Tribal leader and a key mem-
ber of the Northwest Power and Con-
servation Council, working with offi-
cials from across our region. He is also 
a veteran of the U.S. Navy. I know 
Chuck Sams to be a role model in the 
stewardship of America’s lands, our 
waters, our wildlife, and our history. 
The Congress and parkgoers are 
going to be able to count on him in the 
months and years ahead, after he is 
confirmed, because we know the Park 
Service faces some very big challenges. 
There is, for example, a multibillion- 
dollar maintenance backlog. The parks 
are often very crowded. They are con-
fronting the effects of the climate cri-
sis, whether it is wildfire, floods, or 
droughts. The list goes on and on. 
There has been for too long—too long— 
a workforce culture fraught with gen-
der discrimination and harassment. 
For almost 5 years, the Park Service 
has been without a Senate-confirmed 
Director. The reason why I am here is, 
I would say to the Presiding Officer 
and to my colleagues, I am here to 
make sure that the Senate doesn’t wait 
another single day after 5 years to con-
firm a capable leader, Chuck Sams, as 
the Director to address these chal-
lenges I have described. He is the right 
nominee at the right time. I want Sen-
ators to know I base this not on read-
ing a bunch of resumes or bios about 
Chuck Sams. I have seen it myself. I 
have seen Chuck at work in our State. 
He is committed. I support him 110 per-
cent. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed 
to executive session to consider the fol-
lowing nomination: Calendar No. 508,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8425 
November 18, 2021 
Charles F. Sams III, of Oregon, to be 
Director of the National Park Service; 
that the nomination be confirmed, the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate; that no 
further motions be in order with re-
spect to this nomination; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action; and that the Sen-
ate then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I want to 
commend my colleague from Oregon 
and his comments. As a matter of fact, 
I don’t disagree with pretty much any-
thing he said. 
I had my first good meeting with Mr. 
Sams this morning, and I would agree, 
I think he is qualified. I am particu-
larly impressed with his background as 
a Native American, as a veteran. 
One thing I like to talk a lot about is 
how our Alaskan Native American pop-
ulations serve at higher rates in the 
military than any other ethnic group 
in the country—special patriotism. Mr. 
Sams certainly carries that tradition 
on quite well. 
And I have already talked to Senator 
WYDEN. I intend to work with him and 
Mr. Sams just on a few more issues, a 
few more discussions. Again, we had a 
very good conversation this morning. 
This is nothing about his qualifica-
tions, but I wanted to make sure the 
administration is aware of some issues, 
at very high levels, as it relates to this 
position, this job. And, again, I agree 
with my colleague from Oregon; this is 
an extraordinarily important Federal 
Agency. As a matter of fact, it is so im-
portant for my State that I want to ex-
plain a little bit to my colleagues, 
many of whom don’t really know what 
the National Park Service does. But to 
my State, it is enormously important; 
it is powerful; and it can touch on peo-
ple’s lives in huge ways. 
Let me just give you a little bit of 
the numbers. The Federal Government 
manages roughly 66 percent of the 
lands in Alaska. Of that, the Park 
Service controls 55 million acres. Two- 
thirds of all National Park Service 
land—two-thirds of the land that Mr. 
Sams will be in charge of is in my 
State. A lot of people don’t recognize 
that. A lot of people don’t understand 
that. Alaskans understand that—two- 
thirds. 
So he is one of the big, important 
landlords of the great State of Alaska. 
And, as you can imagine, this Agency 
has outsized influence in Alaska be-
yond what these numbers represent— 
for hunting, for fishing, for transpor-
tation, for culture, and for people’s 
livelihoods. 
And this has been an Agency, to be 
quite frank, that has been abusing its 
power in Alaska for decades—Democrat 
administrations and Republican ad-
ministrations. 
In 1980, this body passed the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Conservation 
Act—what we call in Alaska ANILCA. 
The Congress took 100 million acres of 
Alaska lands. We weren’t supportive, 
by the way, Alaska—100 million acres. 
That is bigger than almost any State 
represented in the U.S. Senate, bigger 
than two Minnesotas. 
And a huge part of ANILCA laid out 
how the National Park Service would 
interact with Alaskans. For decades, 
Alaskans were saying that the way in 
which the National Park Service was 
treating Alaskans—by the way, Alaska 
Natives in particular—was not accord-
ing to the law, was not according to 
ANILCA. 
And it wasn’t just Alaskans saying 
this. In the last 4 years, there have 
been two U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sions—they are referred to as the 
‘‘Sturgeon’’ decisions—where an Alas-
kan who wanted to go hunting sued the 
National Park Service, and it went all 
the way to the Supreme Court. And the 
U.S. Supreme Court twice in the last 4 
years, 9 to 0—9 to 0—agreed with Alas-
kans that the National Park Service 
was not following the law as it related 
to ANILCA. 
As Justice Kagan, who wrote one of 
the opinions, said, ‘‘Alaska is often the 
exception, not the rule’’ to issues relat-
ing to Federal lands and access. 
Now, as you can imagine, the Na-
tional Park Service did not like get-
ting slammed by the U.S. Supreme 
Court twice 9-zip, but we liked it. It 
was a vindication of what Alaskans, for 
decades, have been saying about the 
abuse of power of the National Park 
Service. 
So I want to work with Senator 
WYDEN and Mr. Sams on further con-
versations, soon—we are not trying to 
block this; I know the National Park 
Service needs leadership, and I think 
he would be a good leader—but to look 
at making sure the implementation of 
these two U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sions, 9 to 0, are followed through by 
the entire bureaucracy. It is not much 
to ask. 
These are topics I raised with Mr. 
Sams today. He seemed to be in agree-
ment with me. But these issues are 
enormously important to the people I 
represent. 
And I am going to mention one final 
thing, and it is not really in Mr. Sams’ 
area of expertise, but I mentioned this 
to him as well. 
All Americans have been experi-
encing 
economic, 
pandemic-related 
pain over the last 20 months. My State, 
I think, has been hit as hard as any 
other State, particularly on the eco-
nomic side. And I want to just raise 
this topic right now because I am going 
to come down on the Senate floor and 
talk about it a lot more here. But it re-
lates to some of these issues. 
This administration, the Biden ad-
ministration, in the last 10 months, has 
issued 19 Executive orders or Executive 
actions solely focused on my State—19. 
There is no other State in the coun-
try—not Maryland, not Oregon, no 
other State in the country—that is get-
ting this kind of attention from the 
new administration, and it is attention 
that we don’t want because almost 
every one of these Executive orders and 
Executive actions is hurting working 
families, is hurting our economy, is 
hurting access to our lands at a time 
when we are already hurting. 
I just want to ask my colleagues, re-
spectfully, especially on the other side 
of the aisle, could you imagine a Re-
publican administration coming in and 
saying, ‘‘We are going to issue 19 Exec-
utive orders and actions targeting 
Maryland or Delaware or Oregon or 
Massachusetts’’? Senators would be on 
the floor, rightfully, sticking up for 
their State and their fellow citizens. 
This is a challenging time right now. 
Working families are hurting with in-
flation, high energy costs, and we have 
an administration in the White House 
that thinks it is fine to target the 
great State of Alaska. Well, it is not 
fine. It is not fine. It is a war on work-
ing families in my State, and I would 
hope all of my colleagues would recog-
nize that this isn’t appropriate. This 
isn’t appropriate. 
And it is not just these actions. The 
White House has made it known that it 
has 
gone 
to 
financial 
institutions 
throughout the country—banks, insur-
ance companies—saying: Don’t invest 
in American energy projects in the 
Arctic—also known as Alaska. 
So I am not going to hold this 
against Mr. Sams. My colleague from 
Oregon I have a lot of respect for. But, 
literally, every major project that is 
resource development, employs people, 
helps working families—by the way, 
there are some that aren’t economic. 
There is a law that we passed in the 
U.S. Senate 3 years ago to help Alaska 
Native Vietnam veterans. It was my 
bill. I care deeply about these great 
warriors who were really screwed by 
their country when they came home 
from Vietnam. 
The administration has delayed the 
implementation of that bill for 2 years. 
There will be Vietnam veterans—Alas-
ka Native Vietnam vets—in my State 
who will die before they get the benefit 
because they just thought they could 
do another hit on Alaska. 
So I ask my colleagues to just put 
yourself in my State’s position. None 
of you would accept that. And I am 
going to start talking about it, and I 
am going to start raising these issues. 
And I hope I can get some of my col-
leagues—Republicans and Democrats— 
to maybe reach out to the White 
House, going: Hey, this really isn’t ap-
propriate. Alaska has had a rough 
time. Everybody has had a rough time 
in America, but really? Nineteen Exec-
utive orders and actions? 
These are just the Alaska-specific 
ones. There are broader Federal ones 
that impact us too. But I want to work 
with Senator WYDEN. I want to work 
with Mr. Sams, particularly on that 
issue I raised earlier. I think he is

going to be very well qualified. I ad-
mire his desire to serve, his back-
ground, and especially his Navy back-
ground. 
And I intend to lift my hold very 
soon, but right now I am objecting. But 
my goal would be to have this nominee, 
who is qualified, after further discus-
sions with me and Senator WYDEN, 
moved to be confirmed by the U.S. Sen-
ate. But, for now, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I just 
want to tell the Senate where we are 
now and what is ahead. 
I have asked unanimous consent to 
confirm an Oregonian whom I have 
watched in action, Chuck Sams, to 
head the National Park Service, which 
has gone leaderless for 5 full years. 
Now, my colleague has said, to his 
credit, that Chuck Sams is very well 
qualified, that he is a good man, that 
he had good discussions with him. And 
I would just say to the Senate and my 
colleague—my colleague and I have 
worked together often here in the Sen-
ate. I remember, as chairman of the Fi-
nance Committee, we had some issues 
on the budget. And we got together, 
and within 20 minutes we had it 
worked out. 
So I would just say to my colleague, 
I am ready from this minute on to get 
together with you, to get together with 
Mr. Sams. We are going to be here, it 
sounds like, at least today, and then 
we will have to see. 
But I just hope we can work this out 
because I listened to the Senator very 
carefully. And I have been to Alaska. I 
went with your colleague Senator MUR-
KOWSKI when I was chairman of the En-
ergy Committee. And I heard my col-
league’s concerns. 
Well, to get those kind of concerns 
addressed—many of them—you have 
got to have a Director; you have got to 
have somebody you can hold account-
able, somebody you can get on the 
phone and you can talk to about issues. 
Chuck Sams is exactly that kind of 
person. 
So I want my colleague to know we 
are going to be here the rest of today 
and, it sounds like, some of tomorrow, 
but we will have to see. I hope that we 
can get this worked out, and I want to 
pledge to my colleague that I will, my-
self, be willing to work with him on 
issues he has with the State, just the 
way we did on those tax concerns with 
respect to the budget. And let’s see if 
we can get this done before we leave 
this week because the longer we wait— 
I mean, just think of the Park Service 
here over the holiday. There are going 
to be a lot of people—because the Park 
Service is part of the treasures of 
America—who are going to want to 
enjoy those facilities. 
So this has real-world consequences. 
I look forward to working with my col-
league, and I hope—I hope—we can get 
this done before we leave, and I pledge 
to my colleague that I will work with 
him to respond to his concerns not just 
about this nominee in the context of 
this nominee but in the context of the 
concerns he has for his State. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my colleague from Or-
egon, and I will commit to working 
with him to try and get this done be-
fore we head out to recess. 
We know the treasures of Alaska. As 
I mentioned, two-thirds of all the Park 
Service in the country is in my State, 
which is why I want to make sure I am 
having followup conversations—I had a 
good one already with Mr. Sams—to 
get commitments on a few additional 
issues that matter deeply not just to 
the Park Service and for America but, 
really, to my State. But you have my 
commitment to work with you and Mr. 
Sams on a few more of these issues. 
And, if I may, for all my colleagues, 
right—and I am glad to hear Senator 
WYDEN mention this—this shouldn’t be 
happening with one State. There is a 
Biden White House war on the State of 
Alaska. No one is getting treatment 
like this, and it shouldn’t be this way. 
If a Republican President were in at-
tacking Maryland or Oregon like that, 
I would call the White House going: 
Hey, lay off, guys. Lay off. 
So I sure hope some of my col-
leagues—Republican and Democrats— 
can send the message to Joe Biden, the 
President, that you know, the war on 
working families in Alaska is not real-
ly a good idea. They are Americans, 
too, and they have got a lot of re-
sources to produce for our great Na-
tion, which we need right now. 
So with that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, on 
September 9, President Biden told the 
American people that he was losing pa-
tience with them and they needed to 
get vaccinated right now. He laid down 
a series of Executive orders on Federal 
employees, on Federal contractors, on 
companies that had—individuals that 
had 100 employees or more, on individ-
uals that worked in any healthcare-re-
lated, anything that dealt with Medi-
care or Medicaid. It reached out to mil-
lions of people. 
He set a date that was within 3 
months, knowing full well it would 
take months to actually write the rule 
and it would create chaos across the 
country as everyone tried to figure out 
how to do this mandate. 
I fully believe that was the purpose 
of setting a close deadline; it was be-
cause it would have that much chaos in 
the country dealing with the vaccine 
mandates. Well, mission accomplished. 
It has created chaos across our econ-
omy and across lots of families. 
What is the situation right now in 
America dealing with COVID? 
We are on the backside of our second 
peak. We have seen hundreds of thou-
sands of people lose their lives to 
COVID. We have seen hospitals fill, get 
back to order; fill again, get back to 
order. 
But in the meantime, three vaccines 
have been developed, multiple different 
treatments have been developed, a 
multitude of tests have been developed, 
which has been the primary issue that 
we have every year with the flu. 
We don’t panic every year on the flu 
because we have testing. We have 
treatment. We have vaccines. We now 
have, for COVID, testing, treatments, 
and vaccines. It becomes much more 
manageable. 
In the meantime, right at 80 percent 
of all Americans who are 12 years old 
or over have already had at least one 
dose of one of the vaccines. 
Let me run that past you again: 80 
percent of Americans have had at least 
one dose of one of the three vaccines, of 
those 12 years old or older. 
About 45 million Americans have re-
covered from COVID; had it, tested 
positive, and have recovered. The vast 
majority of Americans, by far—like, 
not even close—the vast majority of 
Americans have been vaccinated or 
have recovered from COVID or both. 
But is the administration OK with 
that? 
No, they are not. The administration 
has laid down their own law to say, if 
Americans do not get the vaccine— 
those 20 percent left that haven’t got-
ten the vaccine that are 12 years old or 
older, if they don’t get the vaccine, 
this administration is going to find 
some way for them to lose their job; 
which, for many people, will also mean 
lose their insurance; lose their pension; 
and, sometimes, lose their home. 
But the President’s response is: I 
don’t care. Go get the shot. That is 
what I want you to do. 
Well, Mr. President, mission accom-
plished. 
Let me tell you a story of an indi-
vidual that works in the eastern part 
of my State, who works for one of 
those companies that is 100 people or 
more. He didn’t want to have the vac-
cine. The reason is not even important, 
but he said he didn’t want to take the 
vaccine. So what happened in his com-
pany of 100 or more? They fired him a 
couple of weeks ago. 
You are welcome, Mr. President. 
Thanks for firing him. 
Oh, it gets better. He lost his house 
because he couldn’t pay the mortgage, 
and this adult man has now moved in 
with his family while he tries to figure 
out what happens next for him. 
Do you know why? 
Because the President said he was 
losing patience and he didn’t care if 
this guy lost his house, lost his job, 
lost his insurance. The President was 
just saying, go get it, or else. 
Well, thanks. Right before Thanks-
giving, he is experiencing the ‘‘or else.’’ 
One of my constituent’s husband is 
facing termination. He is from another 
one of those large companies. He has 
worked for them for 30 years. He has a

secret clearance from the DOD. And his 
doctor gave him an exemption because 
his cardiac numbers fluctuate so much. 
And he is one of those high-risk indi-
viduals for blood clots, which can be a 
side effect of the vaccines. So his doc-
tor has encouraged him not to take the 
vaccine. 
So he went into his job. He asked for 
the medical exemption, and he was 
given two forms to sign. The first of 
the forms said he had to agree to take 
the vaccination or he would lose his 
job. The second form agreed that, if he 
took the vaccination, he would not sue 
the company if he had a negative reac-
tion. 
So here is a man who has to choose 
between taking the vaccine, knowing 
that his doctor has told him not to do 
it, and if he does take it, if he has a 
negative reaction, the company wants 
to be held harmless for it. And he has 
to sign a document saying the com-
pany will be held harmless for it or lose 
his job. 
Do you know why? 
Because President Biden said he was 
losing patience. 
So this family gets to sit around over 
Thanksgiving not talking about foot-
ball but talking about whether he is 
going to lose his job or possibly have a 
blood clot in the hospital. 
Which would you like to have that 
conversation on over Thanksgiving? 
There is a company that does elec-
trical engineering that also has one of 
those Federal contracts they talk 
about. Some of the employees don’t do 
the Federal contracting. They work for 
other issues. Fifty people of the 250 in 
the company have said they don’t want 
to take the vaccine, and so they are in 
the process of losing their jobs. And 
that company will not be able to fulfill 
its Federal contract because hiring 50 
more electricians is not that simple 
right now with the economy that we 
are currently in. 
A constituent told us that her em-
ployer is going to lay her off on Decem-
ber 8 because she hasn’t had the vac-
cine yet. So she will spend Thanks-
giving discussing this with her family 
as she approaches the time where she is 
about to be laid off. She works in one 
of those companies that has a Federal 
contract. She reached out to her pri-
mary care doctor, who is at the VA, by 
the way, and the VA instructed her 
that they are not writing exemptions 
for medical exemptions. 
She is on her own. 
Why? 
Because the President is losing pa-
tience, and he has decided he is going 
to throw all of these families in chaos 
or they are going to lose their job, be-
cause he said so. 
Why have I been fighting this man-
date since September 9 when the Presi-
dent actually announced it? 
Because it was obvious to me what 
was coming. It was this. 
Everyone could see it, apparently, 
but the White House. Americans are 
stubborn people. That is what has 
made us the most prosperous, freest 
people in the world. We are entre-
preneurs. We take risks. We understand 
the consequences for our risks. But we 
also go do because we can; we are 
Americans. 
And now the President of the United 
States has announced: I don’t care; you 
are going to get this, or else. 
So what is the real effect of this? All 
of this chaos? 
Oh, this is just part of it. There is a 
whole lot more. 
How about the EMS folks that are in 
rural Oklahoma, that are having a hard 
time actually keeping some of their 
drivers and folks in because they have 
chosen not to take the vaccine? 
What happens in 3 weeks from now 
when people get sick at their house or 
have a heart attack and EMS can’t re-
spond because those folks got fired 
from their jobs because the President 
said, I am losing patience? What hap-
pens? 
I will tell you what happens. People 
die. Other families are going to strug-
gle through this process as they are 
figuring out where they are going to go 
to work because they lost their career, 
because the President said: I have lost 
patience with you. 
Tell me this: For the person that is 
the JAG officer in the military, works 
in the National Guard, and for what-
ever reason—whether it is a religious 
accommodation, medical accommoda-
tion, or whatever it might be—they 
chose not to take this vaccine, when 
they get a dishonorable discharge, 
what happens to them? 
They lose their law license is what 
happens to them. They are disbarred, 
and they are no longer practicing their 
profession. 
What happens to the State trooper in 
Oklahoma that also serves on our Na-
tional Guard? 
When they get dishonorably dis-
charged, they don’t just lose their mili-
tary career; they lose their civilian ca-
reer. 
What happens to the nurse or doctor 
that serves with the National Guard? 
When they get drummed out, what hap-
pens? 
They lose their military career and 
their civilian career. That is what hap-
pens. 
Do you know why? 
Because the President decided he was 
losing patience with the American peo-
ple and they have to do what he says to 
do, not what they want to do. That is 
why all this chaos is happening. 
I heard from a constituent, 28 years 
of Federal service—28 years of Federal 
service. I am not going to give the ad-
ministration that they work in, but 
they work behind the scenes in an ex-
ceptionally important, exceptionally 
difficult task—serving their neighbors 
as a Federal employee. She doesn’t 
want to retire, but she doesn’t want to 
take this vaccine either. 
So do you know what she is doing? 
She is retiring. 
And what is going to happen in this 
agency in Oklahoma when they lose 
this cornerstone person at this Agen-
cy? 
They will struggle to figure out what 
she did, how she did it. And people in 
Oklahoma will get less help in that 
Agency because a long-term, vital civil 
servant is about to get run out of civil 
service because President Biden de-
cided he lost patience with her. 
That wasn’t in her civil service con-
tract. That was never negotiated with 
any other collective bargaining rights 
agreements, never. There is no addition 
in any collective bargaining rights 
agreements for Federal employees that 
they have to get a vaccine mandate if 
the President decides that they do, but 
he decided—that is, President Biden de-
cided—he was going to take this on. 
And so she is going to be discussing 
over Thanksgiving what she is going to 
do post-retirement, wishing that she 
could stay a little longer to be able to 
build up a few more years, and thought 
she was going to be able to, but, in-
stead, she got ran out because she and 
the President had a difference of opin-
ion about a brandnew vaccine. 
Now, I have said to this group before 
several times—and I will say it again— 
I have had the vaccine. I encourage 
others to take the vaccine. Eighty per-
cent of Americans who are 12 years old 
or older have had the vaccine. 
There are plenty of Americans who 
have had the vaccine who support the 
vaccine but do not want their next 
door neighbor to get fired because they 
disagree on the vaccine. In fact, I don’t 
know a lot of people who do, though I 
have met some that are just that 
heartless to be able to say: I don’t care 
what you think. I want to feel better 
forcing you to go get the vaccine. 
I have met some of those folks, but I 
don’t meet many of them. Most of 
them say: I freely made the decision; 
they should be able to freely make the 
decision, as well. 
But apparently that is not where the 
President is and, unfortunately, that is 
not where some of my Democratic col-
leagues are because multiple times we 
have brought an end to the vaccine 
mandates to multiple committees in 
multiple places over the last several 
months and it gets knocked down 
every time. 
Just this week, we filed a Congres-
sional Review Act dealing with just the 
OSHA piece. We have another one com-
ing dealing with all those on CMS to 
make a simple statement: We have got 
to stop this vaccine mandate. It is 
causing chaos in our families. It is 
causing chaos in our economy, and 
anyone who doesn’t think it is is not 
talking to people at home. 
So we will bring this in the next 18 
days to the floor of this Senate, and we 
will force a vote on it and put everyone 
on record: Do you stand with the Amer-
ican people, who strongly affirm the 
vaccine but strongly oppose the man-
date, or will you be one to say: I don’t 
care. I stand with the President. I am 
losing patience with people, this 20 per-
cent that haven’t done the vaccine. I

November 18, 2021 
am losing patience with them, and I 
am just going to force them to do it, as 
well—because that decision is coming 
to every single person in this body. 
This could be turned off right now, 
and one section of it already is turned 
off. The Fifth Circuit Court reached in 
on the issue of private employers and 
said that this was way overly broad of 
the President. No kidding. It was un-
constitutional for the President to 
reach into companies and to say: I 
don’t care who it is, how important 
they are to the company. If you don’t 
make them do the vaccine, you have to 
fire them. 
The Fifth Circuit said you cannot do 
that. Thank you, Fifth Circuit, for fi-
nally joining in on that. 
OSHA has now said that they are not 
going to enforce that, but there are 
lots of other companies that have done 
it anyway. And, I will tell you, for this 
individual in Eastern Oklahoma who 
has already been fired and lost his 
house, it is too late for him for sud-
denly the Biden team to say: Just kid-
ding. We are going to pull that back. 
His life has already been wrecked by 
you. 
What else is happening? I have 
reached out to multiple different Agen-
cies to be able to talk this through. It 
has been fascinating to me, when I 
have talked to different Agencies. By 
the way, the Federal Agency mandate 
for all Federal employees is next week 
to be able to have that done. But when 
I talk to leaders of Agencies of mul-
tiple different Departments across this 
town, none of them seem to know how 
many of their employees have actually 
been vaccinated yet—none of them. 
They all say: Well, we think it is quite 
a few. 
I say: How many folks have not been 
vaccinated? 
We have x number of folks who have 
been reported to us, but they don’t 
seem to know. It has become chaotic. 
For Federal workers, their unions 
have finally stepped in—finally. I have 
been shocked at how slow the Federal 
unions were to this. They finally 
stepped up and asked for an extension 
of the President to say: Don’t put the 
mandate down for next week. Give peo-
ple more time because, literally, people 
are sitting around over Thanksgiving 
deciding whether they are going to 
keep their job or not. 
And if 10 to 20 percent of the work-
force across the Federal workforce 
leaves, we are in such chaos that there 
is no way we will be able to finish serv-
ing people as we desperately need to be 
able to do across the Federal Govern-
ment. 
What would I recommend? I had some 
very frank conversations with the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, or the EEOC. It was inter-
esting to me, when I visited with the 
EEOC. That is the group that protects 
workers—Federal workers or private— 
from discrimination and protects work-
ers from inappropriate termination. 
When I talk to the EEOC, what I hear 
from them is that they weren’t con-
sulted through the process of devel-
oping this new vaccine mandate and all 
the exemptions that should be in place. 
Can I just tell the workers of my 
State and the workers across the coun-
try a simple thing? If your employer 
will not accept your religious accom-
modation that you put in or your med-
ical exemption that you put in—if they 
do not accept those—you need to go to 
the EEOC and file a complaint because 
the EEOC has rules about terminations 
that are inappropriate terminations. If 
individuals are being terminated from 
private companies, even if they are 
Federal contractors or Federal employ-
ees, I encourage you to go to the EEOC 
and file a complaint if they are not 
hearing your medical accommodation 
or your religious accommodation. That 
is your right as an American. 
When the President of the United 
States is running over your rights, you 
have every right to be able to appeal 
that personally. You don’t have to hire 
an attorney. You can file that com-
plaint on your own to be able to make 
sure that your employer knows that 
you are filing an EEOC complaint 
against them for inappropriate termi-
nation, for not accepting your medical 
exemption and your religious accom-
modation. 
Interestingly enough, when I ap-
proached the Office of Management and 
Budget a month ago about how they 
are going to handle religious accommo-
dation, they said: It is not the business 
of Federal workers to decide and indi-
viduals’ faith. We are just going to ac-
cept that. 
But when the document came out, 
there was a six-part test of whether 
you are religious enough to be able to 
turn down the vaccine. They literally 
created a six-part test that every su-
pervisor can go through and check to 
determine if you are religious enough 
to be able to turn this down. 
This would be the first time that I 
know of that the Federal Government 
has actually reached into an entity, to 
individuals, and said: We are going to 
decide for you how religious you are. 
That is how crazy this has become. 
I encourage you, again, if individuals 
have said that you are not religious 
enough to be able to ask for this ac-
commodation, go to the EEOC, file a 
complaint against your employer— 
whether that be a Federal Agency, 
whether that be a private entity—and 
make sure that they are well aware of 
what is going on. 
If you work in a Federal Agency and 
you have an initial appeals process 
that actually goes through, go through 
that. Go through that process. But if 
you are denied or not heard, you do 
have rights as an American, and I 
would encourage you to be able to 
stand up for your rights as an Amer-
ican against unjust hiring and unjust 
firing in this process. 
Let me read this last letter to you. 
As we have fought through this process 
and find every leverage point I can find 
for the people in my State to be able to 
make their own decisions, it has been 
difficult to be able to talk to people in 
the struggles that they have. 
Let me read one. This gentleman 
wrote to me: 
I retired after 20 years of Active-Duty serv-
ice in the military to enjoy time with my 
family and the supreme blessings of freedom 
and peace our country has secured at the ex-
pense beyond human measure. Now, many of 
our undaunted servicemembers and veterans 
alike face possible unemployment because 
we refuse to take a vaccine. Some are being 
coerced into taking it because they can’t 
support their families while unemployed. 
The very people who risked their lives and 
the well-being of their children face persecu-
tion for a personal medical choice. 
His comment to me: This is not 
American. 
I agree. That is why we are fighting 
this. That is why we are continuing to 
push this. That is why we are bringing 
a Congressional Review Act up to put 
every single person in this body on 
record: Do you support forcing people 
to take a vaccine or be fired, or not? 
I do not, and I hope that 99 other of 
my colleagues also do not. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The Senator from Kansas. 
NOMINATION OF SAULE OMAROVA 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
today to express my opposition to 
President Biden’s nominee to be Comp-
troller of the Currency, Dr. Saule 
Omarova. 
Although 
not 
the 
most 
publicly 
known office, the Comptroller of the 
Currency is a prominent and influen-
tial position that regulates and super-
vises all national banks. Given the un-
deniable importance of this office to 
the economy and to Americans, it has 
long been kept free of divisive politics 
and extreme views. 
While I talk about the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency and I talk 
about banks, my concerns are certainly 
more than just the financial institu-
tions that are in our country’s econ-
omy. It is the people, their customers 
who are served, that bother me or 
worry me the most. 
Rather than offer practical ideas for 
strengthening our Nation’s banks, Dr. 
Omarova advocates for the elimination 
of all commercial banks—the very fi-
nancial institutions she should be in-
terested in partnering with. Instead, 
she wishes to replace them with one 
bank—one bank—the Federal Reserve. 
While the Comptroller might not 
have direct control of the Federal Re-
serve’s structure, the reach of the posi-
tion cannot be understated. The Office 
of the Comptroller is a member of the 
Federal Financial Institutions Exam-
ination Council, the Financial Sta-
bility Oversight Council, and even the 
Board of the FDIC, an Agency Dr. 
Omarova hopes to eliminate. 
Although the doctor claims to sup-
port community banks, her plan would 
relegate them to mere franchises of the

November 18, 2021 
larger Federal Reserve, and her com-
ments have alarmed many Kansas com-
munity bankers. They have grave con-
cerns about her policies that would 
‘‘end banking as we know it.’’ 
One Kansas banker says: 
I have severe concerns with the President’s 
nominee to be the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency. Her support of moving the payment 
system entirely through the Federal Reserve 
and her commentary in favor of abolishing 
the FDIC moves the entire banking system 
toward a government-controlled financial 
system. Eliminating the dual banking sys-
tem would be disastrous for entrepreneurs 
and consumers alike in the marketplace. 
Another banker from Kansas said: 
We expect our regulator to supervise safety 
and soundness for banks in the system, not 
to propose and force feed social agenda items 
to us. 
Local lenders—I certainly know this 
in the State of Kansas—are the corner-
stone of many small towns, and the 
Comptroller 
should 
appreciate 
the 
value that community banking brings, 
what I call relationship banking. They 
provide crucial lending services for the 
underbanked populations in rural and 
urban areas alike. Eliminating the one- 
on-one, personal approach that allows 
community banks to thrive will do per-
manent damage to financial inclusivity 
and will further push people out of the 
financial system. 
I have often said to my colleagues in 
Washington, DC, that economic devel-
opment in many places in Kansas is 
whether or not there is a grocery store 
in town. It didn’t take me too long to 
realize that that answer, of whether or 
not there is a grocery store in town, 
often revolves around whether or not 
there is a community bank—a relation-
ship bank—in town, one that makes de-
cisions, certainly, on the wellness and 
the ability of the loan to be paid, but 
what is in the best interest of the com-
munity? How can I make my commu-
nity and my customers better off for 
the way this bank operates? 
Another Kansas banker noted it ap-
pears that Dr. Omarova is comfortable 
with a banking model ‘‘that lacks lus-
ter and the agility to serve the diverse 
nature of the American banking indus-
try.’’ 
With a banking model that would 
provide no incentive to create innova-
tive new products, consumers would no 
longer benefit from the financial mod-
ernization that has brought so many 
people into the banking sector, so 
many customers to the banking sector. 
Consumers are best served by a finan-
cial system that offers competitively 
priced loans and lets lenders invest 
back in their local communities. 
We must continuously work to im-
prove our financial sector for everyone, 
but forcing consumers to bank with the 
government would do so much more 
harm than good. Kansans want less 
government in their lives, not more, as 
this would be. 
Under Dr. Omarova’s proposal, the 
government would have mandatory 
seats on bank boards and be able to 
control investments in ‘‘socially sub- 
optimal’’ activities, a subjective defini-
tion that can be interpreted to stifle 
investment. She believes Federal bu-
reaucrats should handpick who gains 
access to credit—all but ensuring left-
ist ideas would be funded. 
Confirming her to this office would 
provide Dr. Omarova with ample oppor-
tunity to deny funding to industries 
she finds politically unfavorable, in-
cluding bankrupting our domestic en-
ergy companies, something she spoke 
about. 
While Dr. Omarova cheers on compa-
nies’ bankruptcies, jobs disappear, fam-
ilies go without income, and that 
American dream that is so important 
to all of us is crushed. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
doctor’s 
con-
firmation hearing this morning only 
deepened my concerns. Her views have 
no place in the role of the Nation’s top 
bank regulator. 
She is entitled to her views. She is 
entitled to her radical views but not as 
the Nation’s top bank regulator. 
By nominating Dr. Omarova, Presi-
dent Biden looks to fundamentally re-
shape banking from a market-driven 
industry to a one-size-fits-all govern-
ment entity. The thought of a cen-
trally planned economy and a banking 
system like that is not only unwork-
able, but it is radical—radically wrong. 
Even if these ideas are just for the 
sake of some academic thought, Dr. 
Omarova’s suggestions have consequen-
tial impacts. This is a very powerful 
position, and we cannot—we would 
take her views lightly at our own risk. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this 
nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING SERGEI MAGNITSKY 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, 12 
years ago this Tuesday, Russian tax 
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in Mos-
cow at the hands of prison guards who, 
instead of treating him for the acute 
illness that his torturous, yearlong de-
tention provoked, beat him for over an 
hour. He was found dead in his cell 
shortly thereafter. His ‘‘crime’’ was ex-
posing the largest tax fraud in Russian 
history, perpetrated by government of-
ficials. He was 37 years old and left a 
loving family and many friends. 
At the Helsinki Commission, which I 
chair, we had heard of Sergei’s plight 
months earlier, and we were saddened 
and outraged that such a promising life 
had been cut short and that so few ex-
pected his murderers to be held to any 
account. 
Impunity for the murder of journal-
ists, activists, opposition politicians, 
and now simply an honest citizen was 
and remains a depressing cliche´ in Rus-
sia under Vladimir Putin’s rule, while 
his regime often ruthlessly punishes 
people for minor infractions of the law. 
For those on the wrong side of the 
Kremlin, the message is clear and 
chilling. Even the most damning evi-
dence will not suffice to convict the 
guilty, nor will the most exculpatory 
evidence spare the innocent. 
The need for justice in Russia in this 
specific case has not diminished with 
the passage of time. Moreover, the dou-
bling down on the coverup of Sergei’s 
murder and the massive tax heist he 
exposed implicates a wider swath of 
Russian officials with the guilt of this 
heinous crime. It does not need to be 
this way, nor is it ever too late for a 
reckoning in this case in the very 
courtrooms that hosted the show trials 
that ultimately led to Sergei’s death. 
As sober as this occasion is, there is 
reason for hope. Vladimir Putin will 
not rule Russia forever, and every pass-
ing day brings us closer to that mo-
ment when someone new will occupy 
his post. Who that person will be and 
whether this transition will usher in a 
Government in Russia that respects 
the rights of its citizens and abides by 
its international commitments remain 
unclear. I hope it does. A Russian Gov-
ernment that returns to the fold of re-
sponsible, constructive European pow-
ers would increase global security, en-
hance the prosperity of its own citizens 
and trading partners, and bring new 
vigor 
to 
tackling 
complex 
inter-
national challenges such as climate 
change. 
Sergei’s work lives on in his many 
colleagues and friends who are gath-
ering in London this week to celebrate 
his life and to recognize others like 
him who seek justice and peace in their 
countries, 
often 
facing 
and 
sur-
mounting seemingly impossible obsta-
cles. All too often, they pay a heavy 
price for their courageous integrity. 
Sergei’s heroic legacy is exemplified 
in the global movement for justice 
sparked by his death and in the raft of 
Magnitsky laws that began in this 
Chamber and have now spread to over a 
dozen countries, including allies like 
Canada, the United Kingdom, and the 
European Union. Even as these laws 
help protect our countries from the 
corrupting taint of blood money and 
deny abusers the privilege of traveling 
to our shores, they also remind those 
who suffer human rights abuses at the 
hands of their own governments that 
we have not forgotten them. 
Sergei Magnitsky is a reminder to all 
of us that one person can make a dif-
ference. In choosing the truth over lies 
and sacrifice over comfort, Sergei 
made a difference that will never be 
forgotten. 
Fifty-five years ago, Senator Robert 
F. Kennedy addressed the National 
Union of South African Students and

freedom to be heard, ‘‘to share in the 
decisions of government which shape 
men’s lives.’’ He stated that govern-
ment ‘‘must be limited in its power to 
act against its people so there may be 
no . . . arbitrary imposition of pains or 
penalties on an ordinary citizen by offi-
cials high or low.’’ 
Senator Kennedy went on to say: 
Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or 
acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes 
out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny 
ripple of hope, and crossing each other from 
a million different centers of energy and dar-
ing, those ripples build a current which can 
sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression 
and resistance. 
Sergei Magnitsky stood up for an 
ideal. He acted to improve the lot of 
others. He struck at injustice. He was 
and remains a ripple of hope. 
On this sad anniversary of Sergei 
Magnitsky’s murder, let us all recom-
mit ourselves to helping those in Rus-
sia and around the world who seek 
their rightful share in the governance 
of their own countries and who deserve 
the confidence of doing so without fear 
of harm. If we do this, Sergei will not 
have died in vain. 
I am confident that one day there 
will be a monument in stone and 
bronze to Sergei in his native Russia. 
Until that day, the law that bears his 
name will serve as his memorial.

CONFIRMATION OF JULIANNE SMITH 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
would also like to speak to Julie Smith 
and her qualifications to be Ambas-
sador to NATO. 
Julie is, really, very well qualified to 
represent the United States within our 
biggest and most significant security 
alliance. Her 25-year career has focused 
on transatlantic relations and security. 
She has served the country as Deputy 
National Security Advisor and Acting 
National Security Advisor to then-Vice 
President Biden. 
In 2012, she was awarded the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense’s Medal for 
Exceptional Public Service. She has 
worked at some of the country’s most 
esteemed think tanks that address Eu-
ropean issues. 
As the U.S. confronts challenges 
around the world, we need to convey 
our firm commitment to our allies and 
our alliances. For this reason, it is ab-
solutely critical that we put Julie 
Smith in place as Ambassador to NATO 
as soon as possible. 
I am really very pleased that those 
who had a hold on her nomination have 
finally lifted those holds. It is unfortu-
nate that it has taken so long because, 
as we look at what is happening in 
Eastern Europe in particular, and as 
we look at the migrants who are being 
used by Belarus—and I assume that 
Vladimir Putin is behind this, as well, 
to send those migrants to the Polish 
border as a way to distract from what 
is happening in Eastern Europe—clear-
ly, the more equipped NATO is to help 
deal with those challenges, the better. 
If we are going to participate with 
NATO, we need to have an Ambassador 
on the ground. It should have happened 
several months ago, when she was nom-
inated. So I am very pleased that she is 
going to be able to assume her ambas-
sadorship very soon. As co-chair of the 
Senate NATO Observer Group, I look 
forward to working with her in her new 
role. 
But this should serve as a wake-up 
call to those people in this Chamber 
who continue to have holds on critical 
nominees who are important to this 
country’s national security. As I talk 
to U.S. allies, it is clear that the delay 
in 
sending 
Ambassadors 
to 
posts 
around the world is having a real im-
pact on our relations with our part-
ners; and in the absence of U.S. rep-
resentation, they are questioning our 
commitment to our bilateral relation-
ships. 
Now, I would like to think that my 
colleagues who have put these holds on 
our nominees aren’t doing it in an ef-
fort to undermine America’s security 
and to undermine this administration 
in protecting the United States, but, 
clearly, that is the impact of what they 
are doing. 
I have heard from a lot of my col-
leagues over the last months about 
U.S. standing in the world after our 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. Yet, as 
they 
are 
blocking 
administration 
nominees who would work with our al-
lies, who would engage in our shared 
priorities and values, who would listen 
to concerns, and who could work to-
gether, they are just exacerbating any 
issues that may exist. 
I don’t know why they are doing this, 
but, right now, there are 58 other State 
Department nominees who are await-
ing confirmation on the floor. Every 
day that passes that we have no Am-
bassadors in place in countries around 
the world, our national security is 
compromised, and I have got a very 
close-to-home example. 
Earlier today, I met with Diane 
Foley, the mother of James Foley, who 
was the first American killed by ISIS, 
and she has done yeoman’s work with 
her foundation to try to help the fami-
lies of hostages who are being held in 
countries around the world. She was 
talking about what we could do to help 
those families and to do everything to 
try and help them get their loved ones 
back—to free the hostages who are 
being wrongly held around the world. 
Well, one of the things we talked 
about is the fact that, in many of those 
countries, we don’t have Ambassadors 
because we have holds on those folks 
who are so important to help those 
families and to help address American 
interests in those countries. So what 
our colleagues are doing by holding up 
these nominees is undermining the na-
tional security of the United States. 
By grinding to a halt our State Depart-
ment nominees, a small group of my 
Republican colleagues has allowed par-
tisan brinkmanship to pervade a crit-
ical aspect of our national security. 
You know, there was a very impor-
tant principle established after World 
War II about partisan politics ending 
at the water’s edge. It is unfortunate 
that my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are not continuing to support 
that principle. 
We are stronger and safer when our 
diplomatic 
corps—those 
individuals 
who support Americans and U.S. for-
eign policy around the world—are sup-
ported by capable, Senate-vetted, and 
Senate-confirmed Ambassadors.

November 18, 2021 
So I hope we will see in the coming 
weeks a willingness of those few peo-
ple—it is only two or three people on 
the other side of the aisle who have 
held people up—to release those holds 
in the best interests of America and of 
our security. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in opposition to the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
As written, this legislation author-
izes $778 billion in defense spending 
just for next year alone. That is more 
money than we spent on defense during 
the Korean or Vietnam wars. It is even 
more money than we spent at the 
height of the extraordinary Reagan de-
fense buildup in the 1980s. 
Now Congress is set to pass this bill 
with virtually no debate and with vir-
tually no discussion about how much 
money we are spending. Congress keeps 
the spigot of cash wide open so long as 
it is for defense. And please note that 
not one single dollar of this huge de-
fense budget will be offset either with 
new taxes or with new spending cuts 
someplace else. 
Meanwhile, do you know how much 
money the President’s Build Back Bet-
ter plan will cost, on average, each 
year if Congress passes it? $175 billion. 
That is about one-fifth the size of this 
Defense bill. And unlike this Defense 
bill, every single dollar of the Presi-
dent’s plan will be offset with new rev-
enue or savings. 
But here is the thing: When we want 
to 
invest 
$175 
billion 
a 
year 
on 
childcare and paid family leave and ex-
panding access to healthcare and fight-
ing the climate crisis, and when we are 
going to offset every single dollar for 
those new expenses, everybody sud-
denly becomes so very concerned about 
spending. When we want to make in-
vestments that directly benefit people 
across this country, we are told ‘‘that 
costs too much’’ or ‘‘that is socialism.’’ 
But when we spend nearly five times 
that amount of money in the Defense 
bill, it is just a shrug of the shoulders. 
Look around this Chamber. It is 
empty. 
And let’s be clear where most of this 
defense money is going. It is largely 
going to the defense industry. The Pen-
tagon will take this money and give 
approximately $400 billion to contrac-
tors. And nearly 40 percent of that will 
go to a handful of giant contractors. 
This is a huge amount of money in an 
ordinary year, but 2 years into a global 
pandemic that has killed 765,000 Ameri-
cans, it is irresponsible to spend this 
much money on stuff that isn’t saving 
Americans from what is actually kill-
ing them. America’s spending priorities 
are completely misaligned, and the 
threats Americans actually are facing, 
the things that are quite literally en-
dangering their lives—like COVID–19 
and the climate crisis—don’t get this 
kind of attention. 
Let me be clear. We can spend far 
less money on defense and still protect 
Americans and American interests. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. The Congressional Budget Office 
recently published a report outlining 
three different avenues for cutting $1 
trillion in defense spending over the 
next decade. None of the three pro-
posals were even close to radical. And, 
by the way, none of them achieved any 
savings from nuclear modernization, 
contract spending, and closing bases. 
And before somebody cranks up the 
outrage machine, let me say I do not 
believe that we should spend nothing 
on defense. There are real threats to 
our Nation and real interests that we 
must defend. There are some situations 
that may require military solutions. 
But this Defense bill goes far beyond 
that threshold. This bill continues to 
feed into the wrongheaded idea that 
America’s strength can only be meas-
ured by our military domination. 
This bill is another example of Con-
gress granting the Pentagon virtually 
unlimited resources while, at the exact 
same moment, pinching pennies on 
things that will make the American 
economy work for our children and for 
our seniors, for workers and students 
and retirees, for everyone who isn’t 
part of a tiny little slice at the top. 
These misplaced priorities chip away 
at the strength of our Nation, and, 
ironically, they undermine the founda-
tion upon which our military is built. 
If we don’t come to recognize this soon, 
then all this money will have been 
wasted, and the world’s most powerful 
military will rest on a foundation of 
sand. 
There are important and valuable 
provisions in this Defense bill. There 
are even places where we should spend 
more money, like on cyber defense, but 
it is long past time for us to rationalize 
the Pentagon’s budget and align it 
with the threats we actually face. And 
this Defense bill, like so many before 
it, fails miserably to do that. For that 
reason, I will vote against it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUDIT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
November 15, the Pentagon announced 
that it completed its fourth consecu-
tive annual audit and received a fourth 
consecutive failing opinion. 
This is what the Pentagon believes: If 
it somehow merely just conducts an 
audit, then somehow conducting that 
audit is a success despite the fact that 
it has been a requirement under the 
law for the last 30 years for Agencies— 
and that means all government Agen-
cies—to conduct and pass an annual 
audit. The Department of Defense is 
about the only one that doesn’t meet 
the requirements of the law. 
The Department points to other signs 
of progress, such as that they were able 
to downgrade one material weakness 
from a previous audit and the closure 
of some 450 adverse findings. That, 
somehow, 
is 
progress. 
It 
is 
not 
progress—at least, it doesn’t meet the 
demands of the law. However, the fact 
remains that the Department of De-
fense is unable to accurately account 
for billions of taxpayer dollars it 
spends each year. 
Funding for the Department of De-
fense is crucial to our national secu-
rity. Men and women who volunteer to 
wear the uniform and, hence, defend 
our country—these people deserve to be 
well paid and well equipped. 
In light of the rising threats around 
the globe, it is more crucial than ever 
that not one dollar is lost to fraud, 
waste, and abuse. A clean audit, which 
the Defense Department has never had, 
is the key to whether Department of 
Defense money is spent responsibly. 
A key underlying problem to the con-
tinued failed audits is the financial 
management systems used by the var-
ious military Departments. The De-
partment of Defense uses hundreds of 
different financial systems that are 
outdated and are unable to commu-
nicate with each other. They cannot 
generate reliable transaction data and 
are not auditable. 
There are inadequate internal con-
trols in financial management systems, 
presenting an environment that is ripe 
for waste and fraud. Without internal 
controls at the transaction level, mili-
tary leaders can never know how much 
things cost. 
I have tried to work with leaders in 
the Department on this subject for 
years, but time and again, I have been 
disappointed. 
The Defense Department’s inability 
or its unwillingness to make necessary 
and overdue changes should be unac-
ceptable to any Senator. 
I filed an amendment to the bill be-
fore the Senate this year to address the 
root cause of the Pentagon’s failed au-
dits. The underlying bill provides for 
an independent Commission tasked 
with examining the budgeting and 
planning processes at the Pentagon. 
My amendment will require that very 
same Commission to also make rec-
ommendations on bringing financial 
management systems up to snuff. 
The Department of Defense will 
never be able to get a clean audit opin-
ion 
while 
these 
systems 
remain 
unfixed, and the Department of Defense 
has demonstrated an inability or un-
willingness to deploy an accounting

you will never be able to get a clean

I am glad that my amendment has 
been included in the substitute amend-
ment of the Defense bill before the U.S. 
Senate now, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this effort through to final 
passage to finally make real progress 
towards getting to a clean audit opin-
ion. Fiscal accountability and military 
readiness are not mutually exclusive. 
It is not an either-or scenario. Earning 
a clean bill of fiscal health will 
strengthen 
military 
readiness

boost support for necessary increases 
to defense spending in Congress, and it 
would get the backing of the American 
people to a greater extent than it does 
today.

bate, equally divided in the usual form, 
prior to each vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Reserving the right to 
object, I—what is missing from this list 
is the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act. In a moment, you are going to 
hear that it has this procedural prob-
lem—blue slips. For anyone who is not 
familiar with the lingo around here, 
that means that it is going to generate 
revenue, and therefore it has to origi-
nate in the House. That is what you are 
going to hear in a moment. 
Here is what is so interesting about 
it. About, I don’t know, 4, 5, 6 weeks 
ago, that very bill passed by unani-
mous consent in this very Senate. 
This bill doesn’t have a blue slip 
problem. It has a bunch of corporations 
who are making stuff in Xinjiang Prov-
ince problem. That is what the problem 
is here. So everyone is aware—every-
one here is aware, I hope. In the 
Xinjiang Province of China, Uighur 
Muslims are put into forced labor 
camps where they work as slaves— 
something that this administration 
and the previous one termed as ‘‘geno-
cide.’’ 
They work as slaves making prod-
ucts, and there are American compa-
nies that are sourcing goods that end 
up on the shelves in this country. It is, 
in fact, almost certain that in this very 
Chamber there is some product that 
was manufactured by slave labor in 
China. We passed that bill in the Sen-
ate by unanimous consent. Not a single 
person objected to it. There was no 
blue slip problem then. Now all of a 
sudden there is. 
This is because there is a bunch— 
that is why they are killing it in the 
House. A bunch of these corporations, 
lobbying against it, doing everything 
possible, and they know if it gets in 
this bill it is going to become law. 
So I object, and I ask that the re-
quest 
be 
modified 
to 
include 
my 
amendment No. 4330. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. I object to the modifica-
tion, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. RUBIO. I object. 
Mr. REED. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. I renew my request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, border se-
curity is national security. That is why 
I rise today to speak on my amend-
ment No. 4236, to block President 
Biden’s 
outrageous 
taxpayer-funded 
handouts to illegal immigrants who 
broke the law and entered our country 
illegally. 
At a time when American families 
are struggling because of Bidenflation, 
when families are paying more for ev-
erything from gas to groceries, to heat-
ing their homes, the President wants 
to give up to hundreds of millions of 
your taxpayer dollars to illegal immi-
grants as a reward for breaking the 
law. 
Don’t forget, we still have a crisis on 
our southern border, and we should be 
doing all that we can to secure our 
southern border, not incentivize illegal 
immigration. 
These taxpayer-funded handouts to 
illegal immigrants are outrageous, and 
I would urge my colleagues to allow a 
vote on my commonsense amendment. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
to modify the request to include my 
amendment No. 4236. 
Mr. REED. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. I object to the modifica-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. DAINES. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I renew 
my request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I would just 
like to bring to my colleagues’ atten-
tion to the front page of the Wall 
Street Journal, the lead story, the 
headline above the fold today, ‘‘Annual 
Drug Overdose Deaths Top 100,000, Set-
ting Record.’’ For the 12 months ending 
in April, alltime record number of fa-
talities—a 
big 
majority 
of 
them 
opioids, mostly synthetic opioids, driv-
en primarily by fentanyl. Unbelievable. 
Think of 100,000 new families in the 
last 12 months that will have an empty 
seat at the Thanksgiving Day dinner 
next Thursday. 
Pennsylvania has been hit as hard as 
any State, but every one of our States 
has been hit hard by this. 
So why am I objecting to this? 
Because I have an amendment that 
at least on the margins would help. It 
is simple, and it is common sense. It 
adds fentanyl to the majors list. The 
majors list is the list that includes the 
countries that the President has to 
identify as the largest producers of il-
licit fentanyl. That is China. Let’s be 
clear. But once these countries—any 
country—is identified as a big producer 
of fentanyl, my bill would require 
those countries to prosecute drug traf-
fickers and schedule fentanyl as a 
class, and if they do not, then they are 
not doing all they could and should be 
doing to keep fentanyl off our streets; 
in which case, under my amendment, 
the President would be authorized to 
withhold certain categories of foreign 
aid. 
This bill is so noncontroversial and 
common sense, it has actually already

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8433 
November 18, 2021 
It is bipartisan. Senator MAGGIE HAS-
SAN from New Hampshire, a Democrat, 
is my partner on the underlying bill. 
And I would point out to my col-
leagues, I don’t have any objection to 
anyone getting an amendment vote. I 
am not holding up anybody’s votes, as 
long as we get this chance to reduce 
the flow of fentanyl coming into Amer-
ica. 
So I ask to modify the request to in-
clude my amendment No. 3925. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ob-
ject to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
objection. Objection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. TOOMEY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I renew 
my request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I am 
reserving the right to object. 
I want to speak today on behalf of 
my amendment, Risch No. 4794, which 
is not included on that list, which I 
have introduced with cosponsors Sen-
ators PORTMAN, CRUZ, BARRASSO, JOHN-
SON, COTTON, DAINES, and WICKER. 
This amendment is the Senate com-
panion to bipartisan language that al-
ready is included in the House-passed 
NDAA which would sanction Nord 
Stream 2, Putin’s premier energy weap-
on against Ukraine and Europe. 
The timing could not be more impor-
tant. Ukraine stands on the brink of an 
invasion, and Europe is in the throes of 
an energy crisis created by Russia. 
There is a reason Ukraine’s President 
Zelensky tweeted an urgent request 
last week regarding this amendment, 
which said: 
[A]ll friends of Ukraine and Europe in the 
US Senate [should] back this amendment. 
We are now seeing the consequences 
of the administration’s decision to 
waive mandatory PEESA sanctions and 
refusal to impose CAATSA sanctions. 
Russia has deliberately cut gas trans-
mission to Europe through Ukraine 
and is using high energy prices to pres-
sure the EU into approving Nord 
Stream 2 as quickly as possible. Putin 
has publicly stated as such. 
Meanwhile, Russian forces have built 
up along the border of Ukraine in prep-
aration for what could be a full-scale 
invasion, just as they did to the Cri-
mea. 
Remember, Nord Stream 2 is de-
signed to replace Ukraine’s gas transit 
system, meaning Russia no longer has 
to worry about destroying its own in-
frastructure in the event of full-scale 
war. 
We cannot allow Putin’s blackmail to 
succeed. Nord Stream 2 has always 
been a bipartisan issue here in the Sen-
ate, and it should continue to be. Not a 
single Member of Congress supports the 
completion of this pipeline. I would 
like to think a similar number of us 
don’t think we should ignore our 
friends in Europe, particularly Central 
and Eastern Europe, who stand to lose 
the most from Nord Stream 2. 
Our amendment would impose man-
datory sanctions against Nord Stream 
2 AG, the company responsible for the 
project, as well as the companies in-
volved in testing and certifying the 
pipeline before it can become oper-
ational. 
We do provide the administration 
with a pathway to lifting these tar-
geted sanctions, pending, of course, 
congressional review. This pathway is 
the exact same process for congres-
sional input that 98 Senators voted for 
in CAATSA just a few years ago. 
Nord Stream 2 is not set to become 
operational for months so there is still 
time to stop it, but we need to act 
quickly. 
I urge my colleagues to join our dis-
tinguished colleagues in the House of 
Representatives on this important en-
deavor and to vote yes on this amend-
ment. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
to modify the request of the distin-
guished Senator REED and include my 
amendment No. 4794. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ob-
ject to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. RISCH. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I renew 
my original request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, 2 years ago, I authored bipartisan 
legislation sanctioning any company 
that participated in building Nord 
Stream 2. That legislation passed Con-
gress overwhelmingly, and Democrats 
and Republicans overwhelmingly sup-
ported it. That was passed on the 
NDAA, the National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
A year ago, I authored a second set of 
bipartisan sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
That second set of bipartisan sanctions 
again passed overwhelmingly with the 
support of Democrats and Republicans 
in this Chamber. That second set of bi-
partisan sanctions likewise passed on 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
Today, the Democrats are objecting 
to passing sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
What has changed? 
Two things have changed. No. 1, 
today Joe Biden is President and not 
Donald Trump. And the Democrats 
were more than willing to stand up to 
Russia when Donald Trump was Presi-
dent, but when Joe Biden is President, 
suddenly it is untenable for Democrats 
to stand up to Russia. 
But, secondly, it is even worse be-
cause what has also changed is that 
Joe Biden has utterly and completely 
capitulated to Vladimir Putin. He has 
waived the mandatory sanctions that 
this body passed. He has given a multi-
billion-dollar 
generational 
gift 
to 
Putin. This strengthens Russia. Dec-
ades from now, successor dictators in 
Russia will reap billions of dollars that 
they will use for military aggression 
against Europe, against America, and 
it will be because Joe Biden utterly 
and completely capitulated. 
So why are Senate Democrats object-
ing to a vote on Nord Stream 2? 
Because they cannot defend Joe 
Biden’s surrender to Putin on the mer-
its. They don’t want to vote on it be-
cause it would be politically inconven-
ient for this White House that has un-
dermined the national security of the 
United States and has weakened our al-
lies. Right now, energy prices are sky-
rocketing in Europe because Joe Biden 
surrendered to Vladimir Putin. 
We have twice passed Nord Stream 2 
sanctions on the NDAA. After Biden’s 
surrender to Putin, we should do so 
again. My Democratic friends who have 
given speech after speech after speech 
against Nord Stream 2, against Russia, 
should demonstrate they mean what 
they say and that they are not simply 
interested in being political protectors 
for a Democratic President. 
Accordingly—and I would note, by 
the way, in response to every amend-
ment that has been called up, the 
Democrats have not seen fit to provide 
even a word of substantive argument in 
response. So I am going to predict you 
are not going to hear the President, 
Joe Biden, surrender to Russia. You 
are not going to hear any defense of 
Nord Stream 2. You haven’t heard any 
substantive defense. You are going to 
hear two words—‘‘I object’’—because 
the Democrats are afraid of taking this 
vote. 
I believe we are elected here to rep-
resent our constituents and the inter-
ests of the United States, and we 
should have the courage to do so. 
Therefore, I ask to modify the request 
to include amendment No. 4794. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. CRUZ. My prediction was accu-
rate, and I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I renew 
my original request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Alaska.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8434 
November 18, 2021 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, in 
reserving the right to object, I am re-
questing a vote on my amendment No. 
4329. 
I am very disappointed that my 
Democratic colleagues will refuse to 
vote on this very simple, very impor-
tant, 
very 
constitutionally 
correct 
amendment 
that 
also 
dramatically 
could impact military readiness, which 
is why it is so important to discuss it 
here as we are debating the NDAA. 
My amendment is simple. It prohibits 
the Department of Defense from en-
forcing President Biden’s vaccine man-
date on contractors and subcontrac-
tors. That is it. 
Why is this important? 
Well, look, we all want to put the 
vaccine behind us. There is no doubt 
about that. We have all been vac-
cinated here. I think most of us have 
encouraged our constituents, in con-
sultation with their physicians, to do 
the same. 
First and foremost, as to this vaccine 
mandate, it is becoming increasingly 
clear it is not constitutionally based, 
and it is not based in statute, and I 
think the American people are seeing 
that on a daily basis. So it is an issue 
of not just the constitutional authority 
of the President, but it is an issue of 
the principle that got us all through 
the pandemic last year. 
If you will remember, one of the most 
important principles that we had as we 
were working on COVID relief—wheth-
er in the CARES Act or other aspects 
of legislation that we had with regard 
to COVID relief for our citizens—was 
this: If you got relief, whether you 
were a small business, from the PPP, 
or were an airline or a defense con-
tractor, the law said you had to keep 
your employees—that you had to keep 
them together—employers and employ-
ees together. That was the principle 
that all of us—Democrats and Repub-
licans and the Trump administration— 
agreed on during the pandemic, and it 
worked. Many of these workers were on 
the front lines, helping us get through 
the pandemic. 
This President, with his mandate, 
has taken a sledgehammer to that 
principle. Not only are we now saying 
employers and employees stick to-
gether; he is saying to employers: If 
you don’t listen to the President, em-
ployers in America, you have to fire 
your employees. 
Think about that. That is exactly the 
opposite of what we all agreed on last 
year as we were trying to get this Na-
tion through the pandemic. So it is 
fairness. It is the principle that mat-
ters. 
And here is the final thing—and I 
think we are going to see this. It is a 
readiness issue for our military. 
I have been talking to the White 
House. I am trying to get them to re-
scind this mandate. They have consist-
ently said: Well, it is only going to im-
pact about 1 percent of the workforce. 
We can’t afford anybody getting fired 
from their job, but they think it is 
about 1 percent. 
I was home in Alaska last weekend. 
This could impact contractors, and 10, 
15, 20 percent of their workforce might 
not be working—defense contractors— 
hurting readiness. 
Again, during the pandemic, we were 
asking these Americans to show up at 
work and make sure our defense indus-
tries were strong, and now the Presi-
dent is telling these same contractors: 
Go fire your employees—oh, by the 
way, over the holidays. 
So I think this is a very simple, rea-
sonable amendment that will help 
readiness. Therefore, I ask to modify 
the request to include my amendment 
No. 4329. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ob-
ject to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I renew 
my original request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in reserving the right to object, this is 
an astounding thing. This is a con-
versation that has happened today 
about amendments to the National De-
fense Authorization Act. 
Now, I haven’t been here very long, 
but, typically, an NDAA takes about 2 
weeks on the floor to be able to proc-
ess, and there is a lot of conversation 
about different amendments. There are 
managers’ packages; there are big 
groupings of packages that come to-
gether that are noncontroversial; and 
there will be a series of votes that are 
side by side with other votes. It has al-
ready been set up for 20 votes. That is 
terrific. That is a great start. 
Then there is a request for some 
other things that are pretty typical, 
actually. There have been requests just 
in the last couple of minutes on mili-
tary contractors and the vaccine man-
date that will certainly affect our mili-
tary readiness. That is certainly de-
fense related. 
There is human trafficking in China 
and 
whether 
products 
are 
coming 
through. 
That 
is 
pretty 
straight-
forward. In fact, that passed unani-
mously through this body. That doesn’t 
seem that controversial to be able to 
be in here. 
There 
are 
conversations 
about 
fentanyl and the origin of fentanyl, 
where that is coming from. That 
shouldn’t be controversial to try to 
protect the country, but, suddenly, 
that amendment has been blocked. 
Nord Stream 2—Ukraine and Rus-
sia—has not been a controversial issue 
for us. This body has laid down sanc-
tions multiple times on the NDAA on 
this exact issue, and now it is being 
blocked. You can’t even debate it. 
Myself and Senator DAINES
both 
brought up things tonight dealing with 
border security, which is certainly na-
tional security: 1.7 million people we 
know of have illegally crossed our 
southwest border this year. It is the 
highest number of illegal crossings in 
the history of our country—1.7 million. 
But, on January 20 of this year, Presi-
dent Biden stopped construction on the 
border wall—in many places, literally 
where they only had to hang the gates 
and install the electronic infrastruc-
ture there. That was all that was left, 
but it stopped. 
Why is this connected to national se-
curity? 
Well, certainly, border security is na-
tional security. Also, part of this fund-
ing did come out of defense funding. It 
is being done by the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers in many places. 
On top of that, this year, so far—just 
so far this year—we have paid contrac-
tors $2 billion not to build the wall. 
These were contracts that had already 
been let out to do the construction. We 
are continuing to pay about $3 million 
a day to contractors not to complete 
the wall in sections, by the way, that 
career individuals had selected—that 
section and that design—and then had 
to prove that that was the right place 
and the right design to both Repub-
lican and Democrats in this body, 
which they did. Now we are wasting $2 
billion to not do national security. 
My amendment is very straight-
forward. We take the contracts that 
are already out there, and we complete 
those sections of the wall that have 
been approved by career individuals. 
Let’s complete those sections and not 
just throw the money away and waste 
two billion of American taxpayer dol-
lars, but actually use it for national se-
curity. 
So, in saying that, I ask that the re-
quest 
be 
modified 
to 
include 
my 
amendment No. 4100. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I ob-
ject to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. LANKFORD. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I renew 
my original request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, I be-
lieve I have the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has the floor. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, we 
began this process for the National De-
fense Authorization Act months ago. In

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8435 
November 18, 2021 
July, in working closely with the rank-
ing member and all of my colleagues 
on the committee, we passed a bipar-
tisan National Defense Act which was 
focused on the fundamental rationale 
for our National Defense Act: the men 
and women of the Armed Forces; the 
equipment that they need; the new 
technology, which is absolutely nec-
essary as we go forward; the family 
lives of these men and women and their 
development; along with the weapons 
that they will use. 
This has been the focal point. As a 
result, we produced a committee report 
with a bipartisan majority of 23 to 3. 
We continued this bipartisan ap-
proach as we came into the floor de-
bate. We have already included in the 
substitute amendment, which will be 
offered, approximately 60 amendments, 
on a bipartisan basis, that cover a 
range of topics which have been agreed 
to by both sides. Again, everything we 
have done to this point has been on a 
bipartisan basis. 
Indeed, this unanimous consent that 
I have proposed is bipartisan. It incor-
porates amendments from both my Re-
publican colleagues and my Democrat 
colleagues. It does so, as we must, in a 
way that accommodates as many as we 
can, but we cannot and have never been 
able to guarantee that every amend-
ment offered could be incorporated 
into the bill. 
So what we have here is, in a way, a 
crossroads. We have tried since the 
very inception to produce a bipartisan 
bill and a bipartisan floor action and a 
bipartisan final vote on the National 
Defense Act in the U.S. Senate. 
We have to get there because—again, 
I can hear my colleagues talk about 
Nord Stream, and that is very inter-
esting and a very important issue; I 
can hear them talk about border secu-
rity; I can hear them talk about forced 
labor in China; I can hear them talk 
about illegal immigrants. 
Ultimately, this is about the men 
and women who wear the uniform of 
the United States, and we can’t leave 
them behind. The proposals might be 
meritorious, but we have to move for-
ward and give those men and women 
the tools they need to defend the Na-
tion. 
Again, I can’t emphasize enough how, 
in working together with my col-
leagues and ranking member, we have 
tried at every juncture to be inclusive, 
to be bipartisan, to have recognized as 
many of the issues as we could. And we 
have to do that in the context, frankly, 
of the fact, in the Senate, as has been 
demonstrated tonight, one person can 
stand up and say: No, I didn’t get what 
I want, and no one is going to get any-
thing. 
I think we have done a very good job, 
frankly—and I might not be objective— 
in producing a national defense act 
that, at this juncture and with these 
additional amendments, would be more 
than worthy for final consideration by 
the Senate. 
But what is, again, somewhat dis-
concerting to me is that, by analogy, 
you can say everything is national de-
fense. But the people who ultimately 
suffer, if we cannot get to passage and 
then deliberation with the House and 
then a final bill sent to the White 
House—it is not only that these prob-
lems that we have tried to address be 
unaddressed, but we will send a very 
powerful message to the men and 
women in the Armed Forces: We don’t 
have your back. We are too busy squab-
bling amongst ourselves about issues of 
the border, Nord Stream, and other 
issues. 
So I would hope that we could move 
forward. The regret is that at this 
juncture, we are abandoning approxi-
mately 20 amendments on a bipartisan 
basis that would have addressed many 
of the concerns of my colleagues in the 
Senate. Some are directly related to 
national defense and some are not, but 
they were agreed to by both sides, and 
they would be added to this legislation. 
But at this juncture, our responsi-
bility is—and it cannot be avoided— 
moving forward, of passing our defense 
bill, and then working with the House 
to send up to the President of the 
United States a bill worthy of the sac-
rifice and service of those who wear the 
uniform of the United States. 
Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. REED. With that, I would yield 
to the ranking member. 
Mr. INHOFE. Let me thank my part-
ner there for all the hard work that we 
have done together. 
Not many people understand the 
process that we go through every year. 
It is an exhaustive process to get just 
to where we are today. 
First of all, I would say that, out of 
all the amendments that were dis-
cussed, I support all of them. We didn’t 
get a chance to really see who did and 
who didn’t support them, but I support 
them all. 
When we start one of these processes 
each year—we do this every year—the 
first thing we do is that we send a no-
tice out. We send a notice out to each 
Member and ask each Member: What 
types of things are you interested in? 
And we send this out to all—to each 
Member of the House and the Senate, 
and they send their notices in as to 
what they want, when they want it, 
and how they want it. Then we put 
them and marry them in with other 
Democrats and Republicans who want 
the same thing and try to get these 
lists shaved down a little bit. And we 
have been successful in doing it. Right 
now, there are 60 cleared amendments. 
That is 60. That is about the same 
number we had last year and the same 
number we had before. 
I was disappointed that we had to 
waste a lot of time. My fellow Senator 
from 
Oklahoma, 
JAMES
LANKFORD, 
made the comment that we should 
have been on this bill for 2 weeks or 
longer. I agree; we should have. We 
couldn’t do it. We didn’t have it. 
I have to say that the leader—the 
Democratic leader—didn’t allow this to 
come up so that we could do this. We 
didn’t have a choice. As Republicans, 
we didn’t have a choice, and we were 
united in wanting to get started ear-
lier. As a result of that, a lot of Demo-
crats and Republicans have lost their 
opportunity to get heard and to have 
amendments considered. 
The system is good. It is one that has 
worked for a long time. This is going to 
work. When we stop to think about the 
number of hours that are spent wading 
through all of these amendments, this 
does take place. 
I would compliment our chairman of 
the committee. We have worked very 
well together. We have gotten to this 
point. We will have to get this thing 
finished, and we will. But, nonetheless, 
we have an exhaustive policy that we 
have considered year after year after 
year. That is where we are today. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
Democrats have been working in good 
faith for several days—actually, for 
several months, really—to pass this de-
fense legislation. 
The bill before us was produced 
through a bipartisan committee proc-
ess and included the input of at least 
three-fifths of Senators from both sides 
of the aisle. It is unfortunate that we 
cannot move forward tonight. 
Yesterday, we agreed to delay the 
initial cloture vote after the Armed 
Services Committee’s ranking member 
requested more time to work on a man-
agers’ package to include more input 
from Members. The managers’ package 
now include 57—57—amendments; 27 
from Republicans, 27 from Democrats, 
and 3 bipartisan amendments. 
Further, we just proposed votes on 18 
amendments, 3 of which are bipartisan 
and 8 of which are Republican-led 
amendments. We could start voting on 
them tonight, but unfortunately, the 
other side won’t agree—or some on the 
other side won’t agree. 
Democrats have demonstrated all 
year that we are more than willing to 
work in good faith on amendments 
here on the floor. This year, more 
amendments 
have 
received 
rollcall 
votes than during any of the past 4 
years. Members on both sides want to 
get this done. So these delays are un-
fortunate. There is no good reason to 
keep delaying. We should move the 
process forward. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll.

President 
Biden’s choice to lead the National 
Park Service. 
I am just going to take a few minutes 
to talk about Chuck Sams and why he 
is the right person for this critical job. 
Colleagues, we all know that the 
Park Service is often called America’s 
best idea, and together those parks 
form a network of treasures that no 
other country can match. 
The fact is, the National Park Serv-
ice is not only about the views and the 
photo-ops. It is all about our country. 
It is what makes our country so special 
for so many. 
The Director of the National Park 
Service is in charge of an organization 
of over 22,000 employees and almost a 
quarter million volunteers. The Na-
tional Park System generates tens of 
millions of dollars of economic activ-
ity. The people of my State know par-
ticularly how important those critical 
outdoor treasures are for rural econo-
mies and rural jobs. 
The fact also is that there are park 
units in every State in the country— 
urban parts, rural parts, historic Amer-
ican buildings, ancient archeological 
sites—and personnel at the Park Serv-
ice do it all, from education to preser-
vation, to maintenance, and even resil-
ience against wildfire. 
Chuck Sams has been a longtime 
Umatilla Tribal leader, and there he 
has served in a variety of roles. He is a 
member of the Northwest Power and 
Conservation Council, working with of-
ficials from across the Pacific North-
west. He is a veteran of the U.S. Navy. 
He is a role model—a role model—in so 
many respects, and particularly in the 
stewardship of America’s lands, waters, 
wildlife, and history. And the Congress 
and the parkgoers are going to rely on 
him in the months and years ahead be-
cause we all know the Park Service 
faces big challenges. 
I am going to wrap up and make my 
unanimous consent request, but, first, I 
want to commend my colleague from 
Alaska. My colleague and I have been 
working pretty much through the day. 
I will be brief. I just want to thank 
the Senator from Alaska. We have been 
working throughout the day to resolve 
the whole issue of the Sams nomina-
tion. 
This is a wonderful person who is 
going to give public service a really 
good name when he is confirmed. 
My colleague from Alaska has raised 
a number of issues that he considers 
very important to his State. He and I 
have worked together on a variety of 
these issues, both from the standpoint 
of the Energy Committee and most re-
cently as chairman of the Finance 
Committee, when we have worked on 
some tax issues. So I want to thank 
him for his cooperation that is going to 
make it possible for us to advance this 
nomination tonight. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to ex-
ecutive session to consider Executive 
Calendar No. 508, Charles F. Sams III, 
of Oregon, to be Director of the Na-
tional Park Service, and that the Sen-
ate vote on the nomination without in-
tervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
just want to thank Senator WYDEN for 
his cooperation working on this nomi-
nee. Mr. Sams, I do agree, is qualified. 
We had a long discussion this after-
noon about some of the big issues that 
are impacting my State as it relates to 
the National Park Service. 
You know, a lot of people love the 
National Park Service. Two-thirds of 
all National Park Service land in 
America is in Alaska—tens of millions 
of acres. It is bigger than almost every 
other State represented here on the 
Senate floor. That is just the National 
Park Service. 
For decades, that Federal author-
ity—the National Park Service author-
ity in Alaska—has been abused. How do 
we know that it has been abused? Well, 
we recently had two—two—U.S. Su-
preme Court decisions that were 9-to-0 
decisions, by the way, that essentially 
said the Park Service was not fol-
lowing the law in Alaska—two. 
So my discussions with Mr. Sams and 
the commitments he made to me, I 
think, are going to help Alaska. I think 
they are going to help the National 
Park Service, and it is related to the 
National Park Service authorities. 
After these two decisions—they were 
called the Sturgeon decisions—two in a 
row, at the U.S. Supreme Court, 9 to 0, 
by the way, and the U.S. Supreme 
Court telling the National Park Serv-
ice: You are not following the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Conservation 
Act. We call it ANILCA in Alaska. You 
are not following the Federal Govern-
ment. You need to follow it. 
So the commitment I got from Mr. 
Sams was there was a recent regula-
tion from the Federal Government in 
November of 2020 providing specifics of 
how the National Park Service was 
going to implement these two U.S. Su-
preme Court cases—the Sturgeon case. 
And he committed to me to be true to 
these regulations and to faithfully exe-
cute these regulations in the National 
Park Service on implementing Stur-
geon. That is a very big deal in Alaska. 
He also committed to have all of his 
senior Alaska staff and senior staff 
here in Washington, DC, take ANILCA 
training. This is a giant statute. The 
Federal Government often screws it up, 
and it has a negative impact on my 
State. So he committed to me that he 
will have his top leadership at the Na-
tional Park Service take training to 
understand this complicated law. That 
will also help my constituents and the 
country very much. 
So I want to, again, thank Senator 
WYDEN for working with me on these 
issues. These are important commit-
ments that Mr. Sams has made, and I 
have no further objection to this nomi-
nee’s confirmation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no objection, the clerk will report 
the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Charles F. 
Sams III, of Oregon, to be Director of 
the National Park Service. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nomination. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Sams nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, all without intervening 
action or debate; that no further mo-
tions be made in order to the nomina-
tion; that any statements related to 
the nomination be printed in the 
Record; that the President be imme-
diately notified of the Senate’s action, 
and the Senate resume legislative ses-
sion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

WORLD DAY OF REMEMBRANCE 
FOR ROAD TRAFFIC VICTIMS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, November 21, 2021, will mark the 
26th World Day of Remembrance— 
WDoR—for Road Traffic Victims, com-
memorating the millions of people 
killed and injured on the world’s road. 
It is also a day to thank emergency re-
sponders for their role in saving lives, 
to reflect on the impact of road traffic 
deaths and injuries on families and 
communities, and to draw attention to 
the need for improved legislation, 
awareness, infrastructure, and tech-
nology to save more families from the 
tragedy of losing a loved one. 
More than I million people die from 
road crashes every year, and tens of 
millions are seriously injured. Road 
traffic crashes are the No. 1 killer of 
young people aged 15–29 and the eighth 
leading cause of death among all peo-
ple worldwide. Rochelle Sobel, presi-
dent of the Association for Safe Inter-
national Road Travel, highlighted the 
gravity of this issue and the imperative 
to fix it: ‘‘Every 27 seconds, somewhere 
in the world, a person dies in a road 
crash.’’ 
On this 26th anniversary of World 
Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic 
Victims, it is important to remember 
the history and recommit to the goals 
of this day. It was initiated in 1995 as 
the European Day of Remembrance and 
quickly spread around the globe to 
countries in Africa, South America, 
and Asia. In 2005, the United Nations 
General Assembly adopted resolution 
60/2, recognizing November 15 as the 
World Day of Remembrance for Road 
Traffic Victims. Since that time, the 
observance of this day has continued to 
spread to a growing number of coun-
tries on every continent. 
This year marks the start of the new 
Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021– 
2030, during which the WDoR will high-
light the reasons for all of the nec-
essary actions to be taken during this 
coming decade. Indeed, the day has be-
come an important moment to focus 
international attention on this pre-
ventable epidemic and as an advocacy 
tool in global efforts to reduce road 
casualties. As a result of the growing 
awareness and global call to action 
that World Day of Remembrance for 
Road Traffic Victims has generated, in 
September 2020, the United Nations 
passed a resolution declaring the years 
2021 to 2030 a new Decade of Action for 
Road Safety. The declaration affirms 
the UN’s commitment to work vigor-
ously to implement a new, ambitious 
agenda to halve road crash deaths by 
2030. 
Additionally, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 calls 
on 
governments 
and 
their 
stake-
holders, including NGOs and private 
citizens, to address the personal, med-
ical, and financial burdens associated 
with road traffic deaths and injuries. 
The devastation of losing a child, 
parent, sibling, partner, friend, care-
giver, or caretaker is immeasurable, as 
are the challenges of caring for a per-
manently disabled loved. Road traffic 
crashes are preventable, and so we owe 
it to our communities to work together 
so that the hopes and dreams of our 
loved ones are not shattered on the 
roads of the United States and the 
world. We must all take action to pre-
vent these avoidable tragedies and save 
lives.

TRIBUTE TO JANET COIT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to honor Janet Coit, 
one of Rhode Island’s most respected 
environmental advocates. Ms. Coit is 
the newly appointed Assistant Admin-
istrator for the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric 
Administration’s 
Na-
tional Marine Fisheries Service. She 
joined NOAA after a decade of com-
mitted service leading the Rhode Is-
land Department of Environmental 
Management under three Governors. 
After graduating from Dartmouth 
College and Stanford Law School, 
where Ms. Coit was a member of the 
Environmental 
Law 
Journal, 
she 
served as counsel to the U.S. Senate 
Committee on the Environment and 
Public Works. She went on to serve as 
counsel and environmental coordinator 
for the late Senator John Chafee and, 
subsequently, his son Senator Lincoln 
Chafee. 
Ms. Coit then returned to Rhode Is-
land and began a decade of work as the 
State director for the Nature Conser-
vancy, where she oversaw some of the 
State’s 
largest 
land 
conservation 
projects. 
Ms. Coit went on to be appointed by 
Governor Lincoln Chafee to serve as di-
rector of the Rhode Island Department 
of Environmental Management. Gov-
ernors Raimondo and McKee wisely 
kept her in that position. Her legacy at 
DEM includes streamlined permitting 
processes, new opportunities for fami-
lies to connect with nature, and im-
proved customer service. As the long-
est serving chief executive in DEM’s 
history, she focused on public parks, 
promoting local food systems, Rhode 
Island’s fishing and shellfish indus-
tries, and climate solutions. She seized 
opportunities to coordinate regional ef-
forts, including addressing equity and 
justice issues, improving water quality, 
managing PFAS contamination, and 
fighting the climate crisis. In this ca-
pacity, she also served as chair of the 
Rhode 
Island 
Executive 
Climate 
Change Coordinating Council and on 
the board of directors for the Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative. She has re-
ceived numerous awards for her out-
standing contributions at DEM. 
In June, the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration appointed Ms. Coit to lead 
NOAA Fisheries, where she oversees 
fisheries management, protected spe-
cies, and fisheries habitat conserva-
tion. She also serves as the Acting As-
sistant Secretary of Commerce for 
Oceans and Atmosphere and Deputy 
Administrator, supporting and man-
aging NOAA’s coastal and marine pro-
grams. 
We are fortunate that exceptional 
people like Ms. Coit choose to dedicate 
their careers to public service. I am 
proud to recognize her today and thank 
her for her many contributions to the 
State of Rhode Island and the Nation.

TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH SUE 
MAYER 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise 
as chairman of the Select Committee 
on Ethics, and on behalf of the vice 
chairman, members of the committee, 
and its staff, to pay tribute to Deborah 
Sue Mayer as she retires after 23 years 
of Federal service including the last 6 
as chief counsel and staff director of 
the Select Committee on Ethics. As a 
paramedic, a naval officer, and attor-
ney, Deb’s career tells the story of a 
life dedicated to public service. She 
joined the Senate in January 2015 after 
4 years as director of investigations for 
the House Committee on Ethics. From 
2002 to 2011, Deb was a prosecutor with 
the U.S. Department of Justice; begin-
ning as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in 
the Eastern District of New York’s Or-
ganized Crime and Racketeering Sec-
tion. Deb went on to serve in the De-
partment of Justice Public Integrity 
Section 
of 
the 
Criminal 
Division, 
where she investigated and prosecuted 
corruption at all levels of government 
throughout the United States. Since 
1998, Deb has served as a Judge Advo-
cate in the U.S. Navy, first on Active 
Duty and continuing her career in the 
Reserve Force. 
In her time as chief counsel and staff 
director, Deb personally advised mem-
bers of the Committee and Senate,

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JOHN E. 
HYTEN 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
rise today to congratulate Gen. John E. 
Hyten on his retirement from the U.S. 
Air Force. I also want to extend my 
congratulations to his wife, Laura, and 
note the remarkable bond they share. 
Their partnership in life has enabled 
his success in uniform, and his achieve-
ments are truly theirs. 
Across four decades of service, Gen-
eral Hyten has risen through the ranks 
to become one of the most respected 
voices in our military, and many in 
this Chamber rely on his deep knowl-
edge and expertise. This is especially 
true on matters relating to space and 
nuclear deterrence. 
I got to know General Hyten when he 
became a Nebraska constituent fol-
lowing his appointment to be the com-
mander of U.S. Strategic Command in 
2016. This was actually General Hyten’s 
second tour of duty at Offutt Air Force 
Base, having previously commanded 
the 6th Space Operations Squadron 
there in the late nineties. 
During his 3 years as the commander 
of STRATCOM, I was privileged to 
work closely with him, not just as the 
senior Senator from Nebraska, but also 
the chair of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee’s 
Strategic 
Forces 
sub-
committee, which directly oversees 
STRATCOM’s mission areas. 
During this span, we witnessed a 
marked shift in the strategic land-
scape, with worrying trends with re-
spect to adversary behavior in space 
and investment in nuclear arms great-
ly accelerating. This elevated the im-
portance of STRATCOM’s mission and 
meant that, as its commander, General 
Hyten was on the front line of some of 
the most daunting security challenges 
facing our Nation. 
During his tenure, he played a key 
role in the Department of Defense’s re-
sponse to these evolving threats. As 
space transformed into a warfighting 
domain, his candid advice was invalu-
able in Congress reorganization of the 
Department of Defense’s space enter-
prise, including the creation of the 
Space Force and elevation of Space 
Command to a full-fledged unified com-
batant command. 
He was also an extremely effective 
advocate 
for 
our 
Nation’s 
nuclear 
forces, which continue to be the bed-
rock of our national security. As a 
vocal champion of nuclear moderniza-
tion, he helped make the case for re-
newing the triad and broadening the 
modernization conversation to increase 
focus on nuclear command, control and 
communications—or NC3—systems, as 
well as National Nuclear Security Ad-
ministration’s nuclear complex. 
He played an important part in draft-
ing the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, 
which marked the first time since the 
end of the Cold War that an NPR oc-
curred against a backdrop of growing 
nuclear threats and therefore had to 
confront the uncomfortable reality 
that Russia and China had not followed 
our lead in reducing nuclear stockpiles. 
He explained the problem with his 
customary candor: ‘‘When we started 
de-emphasizing nuclear weapons, what 
did the rest of the world do? The rest of 
the world did exactly the opposite. So 
if we de-emphasize nuclear weapons, 
we’re putting the country at jeopardy 
and we can never allow that to hap-
pen.’’ 
Those sage words are still true today 
and should continue to guide U.S. nu-
clear policy. They also reflect another 
of General Hyten’s characteristics that 
I value greatly: his unwavering focus 
on the threats facing our Nation. A 
tireless advocate for a return of threat- 
based planning, he always endeavored 
to base his approach on the changing 
threat picture and to educate those 
around him about the activities of our 
adversaries. 
When he was nominated to be the 
next Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, I felt very strongly that he 
was the right leader, with the right ex-
pertise, at the right time. I knew he 
would bring all of the qualities that 
distinguished him as a STRATCOM 
commander to bear in his new role, and 
he did not disappoint. 
As Vice Chairman, he continued to 
discharge 
his 
responsibilities 
with 
great professionalism and dedication, 
and his confirmation to the position 
also meant that the Nation could ben-
efit from his leadership for 2 more 
years. 
Sadly, that time is at an end. And 
while the 40 years of exemplary service 
Gen. John Hyten has rendered make 
this retirement well-earned, I hope he 
will continue to share his wisdom and 
counsel. I wish General Hyten and his 
wife, Laura, a wonderful retirement to-
gether and all the best in their future. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, the Biden administration’s disas-
trous withdrawal from Afghanistan 
jeopardized our national security, em-
powered our enemies, and put thou-
sands of innocent lives in jeopardy. But 
as 
the 
situation 
devolved, 
stories 
emerged of heroic efforts to push back 
the Taliban’s advance and save strand-
ed Americans, allies, and Afghan part-
ners from the clutches of one of the 
world’s most dangerous terror organi-
zations. 
Today, I want to honor a group of un-
sung heroes who joined this effort from 
the home front. Team Blackburn is 
blessed to include a dedicated and te-
nacious group of caseworkers and per-
sonal staff who treat the needs of Ten-
nesseans like those of their own fami-
lies. During those chaotic weeks, these 
people fielded hundreds of panicked 
calls for help from and on behalf of 
Tennesseans who were trapped behind 
enemy lines. They used every resource 
at their disposal, leveraged every con-
nection they could think of and worked 
more than a few miracles to bring 
those Tennesseans closer to home. 
On behalf of the Volunteer State, I 
thank the following members of my 
staff who went above and beyond on be-
half of the common cause of freedom: 
Elizabeth Kelly, Payton Scott, Kayley 
Russell, Heather Hatcher, Josh Knell, 
Jeri Wheeler, Dana Magneson, Caroline 
Diaz-Barriga, 
Kim 
Cordell, 
Mac 
McCullough, 
Alexander 
Gonzalez, 
Grace Burch, Jay Strobino, John Clem-
ent, Edward Pritchard, and Emily Man-
ning. 
f 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to 
hear the most anticipated abortion 
case in nearly 30 years when it con-
siders 
Dobbs 
v. 
Jackson 
Women’s 
Health Organization in oral argument 
on December 1, 2021. This development 
allows us to consider the many people 
whose dedication to the pro-life cause 
has led us to this point. One of those 
people is former President Donald J. 
Trump. The pro-life movement would 
not be where it is today absent his ad-
vocacy for pro-life policies and for con-
servative judges. 
In January 2016, Presidential can-
didate Trump said, ‘‘America, when it 
is at its best, follows a set of rules that 
have worked since our Founding. One 
of those rules is that we, as Americans, 
revere life and have done so since our 
Founders made it the first, and most 
important, of our ‘unalienable’ rights.’’ 
He continued, ‘‘Over time, our cul-
ture of life in this country has started 
sliding toward a culture of death. Per-
haps the most significant piece of evi-
dence to support this assertion is that 
since Roe v. Wade was decided by the 
Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 
million 
Americans 
never 
had 
the 
chance to enjoy the opportunities of-
fered by this country. They never had 
the chance to become doctors, musi-
cians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fa-
thers, sons or daughters. They never 
had the chance to enrich the culture of 
this nation or to bring their skills, 
lives, loves or passions into the fabric 
of this country. They are missing, and 
they are missed.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8439 
November 18, 2021 
These words helped guide President 
Trump’s actions in office as he advo-
cated for pro-life policies both domesti-
cally and abroad. Domestically, Presi-
dent Trump fought to defund Planned 
Parenthood and other abortion pro-
viders from receiving Federal funding. 
He prohibited such entities from re-
ceiving title X funding and permitted 
States to prohibit them from partici-
pating in Medicaid as well. In 2018, 
President Trump issued a rule requir-
ing health insurers to specify whether 
plans cover abortion. He also issued 
rules to protect religious objectors and 
moral objectors from the Department 
of Health and Human Services contra-
ceptive 
mandate. 
In 
addition, 
the 
President established a new Conscience 
and Religious Freedom division of the 
Office for Civil Rights to protect 
healthcare providers who object to par-
ticipating in abortions. 
President Trump’s commitment to 
the unborn was just as strong abroad. 
Just days after his inauguration, Presi-
dent Trump ended Federal funding of 
abortion overseas by reinstating the 
Mexico City Policy, which prohibits 
nongovernment organizations receiving 
U.S. aid grants from performing and 
promoting abortions overseas. He di-
rected the Secretary of State to imple-
ment the ban on taxpayer funds for 
overseas abortions across most U.S. 
global health programs through his 
Protecting Life in Global Health As-
sistance policy. 
In addition, President Trump also 
defunded the United Nations Popu-
lation Fund, a program long tied to 
China’s forced abortion one-child pol-
icy. To further underline this, the 
Trump administration in 2020 declared 
to the United Nations that abortion is 
not a human right and signed the Ge-
neva Consensus Declaration, where 33 
nations joined together to reaffirm the 
value of unborn life. Finally, in Janu-
ary 2021, the Trump administration and 
called for the Chinese Communist 
Party to immediately end its system of 
forced abortions. 
In addition to his work within the ex-
ecutive branch, President Trump also 
showed his commitment to the pro-life 
cause by nominating constitutional 
conservative and originalist judges to 
the Federal judiciary. He nominated 
three originalist Justices to the U.S. 
Supreme Court: Justice Neil Gorsuch 
in 2017, Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 
2018, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 
2020. More broadly, President Trump 
nominated 234 new article III judges 
who share this commitment to uphold-
ing our Constitution as written. 
As the pro-life movement advances, 
it is important for us to recognize how 
we got here. Former President Trump 
deserves praise for all his administra-
tion did over the past 4 years to ad-
vance the cause of the unborn. I am 
gratitude for that work and recognize 
the tireless advocacy of the Trump ad-
ministration to protect both women 
and their babies. 
RECOGNIZING THE INTERCESSORS 
FOR AMERICA 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, for many years, thousands of 
members of the Intercessors for Amer-
ica—IFA—have been devoted to prayer 
and fasting in the name of protecting 
the unborn and of ending abortion. The 
IFA was founded in 1973 in an era when 
our Nation experienced turmoil within 
the political, moral, and traditional 
values that are the cornerstone of our 
Nation. 
In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court 
issued its divisive landmark decision in 
Roe v. Wade, legalizing abortion and 
shocking the majority of Americans. 
IFA has worked since then to mobilize 
our Nation to pray for the protection 
of innocent life and to find unity 
among the cultural conflicts in our 
country. Today, IFA is a national orga-
nization of millions of like-minded peo-
ple who are steadfast in praying for 
God’s support and guidance for our Na-
tion’s executive, legislative, and judi-
cial branches of government. 
I thank the members of IFA for their 
dedication, prayers, and fasting in sup-
port of the sanctity of life. Their work 
has helped increase awareness for the 
pro-life movement and its overarching 
goal to defend the unborn. It is the dec-
ades of prayer and hard work of so 
many pro-life advocates that has led us 
to this moment in history in which the 
Supreme Court will be hearing oral ar-
guments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization. This case, which 
focuses on the constitutionality of a 
Mississippi law that bars abortion after 
15 weeks, could reset the abortion issue 
and return it to elected leaders, who 
are more directly accountable to the 
people than Federal judges. 
Today, I recognize and pay tribute to 
the role of the IFA in the nearly 50- 
year fight to protect innocent life in 
the womb. I also join with the IFA in 
praying for the members of our Su-
preme Court, who are now preparing to 
hear the Dobbs case. May God grant 
each Justice wisdom for the task and 
mercy for the unborn. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO SAM BROWNBACK 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, it is an honor to pay tribute to 
my fellow public servant Sam Brown-
back of Kansas. During his service both 
as Governor of Kansas and as a U.S. 
Senator, he advocated tirelessly for the 
right to life. More recently, during the 
last administration, he served as the 
U.S. Ambassador at Large for Inter-
national Religious Freedom, fighting 
for the free exercise of religion abroad. 
After a couple years in the House of 
Representatives, Ambassador Brown- 
back represented Kansas in the Senate 
from 1996 to 2011. He came to the Cap-
itol with a background similar to mine. 
I served as the Mississippi Commis-
sioner of Agriculture and Commerce 
prior to coming to the Senate, and Am-
bassador Brownback served as Kansas’s 
Secretary of Agriculture before coming 
to DC. 
Upon joining the Senate, Ambassador 
Brownback consistently supported pro- 
life legislation and voted in defense of 
the sanctity of life. Through his 15 
years in the Senate, he supported pro- 
life legislation including the Unborn 
Child Pain Awareness Act, the Born 
Alive Infants Protection Act, the Un-
born Victims of Violence Act, the Par-
tial Birth Abortion Ban Act, and the 
Hyde amendment. 
This support for unborn life contin-
ued when the people of Kansas elected 
Sam Brownback to be their Governor, 
a position in which he served from 2011 
to 2018. As Governor, he signed numer-
ous laws protecting unborn human life, 
including a measure that made Kansas 
the first State to ban dismemberment 
abortions. 
Furthermore, 
during 
his 
tenure, Kansas passed laws restricting 
funding to abortion providers and ban-
ning sex-selective abortions, among 
many others. 
Sam Brownback’s steadfast efforts 
paid off. By the time he became an Am-
bassador in 2018, Kansas had become 
the second most pro-life State in the 
Nation, as ranked by the Americans 
United for Life. In fact, the number of 
abortions in Kansas dropped by nearly 
30 percent, a testimony to the success 
of his policies promoting a culture of 
life. 
But his efforts did not stop there. 
Upon his confirmation in 2018 as the 
U.S. Ambassador at Large for Inter-
national Religious Freedom, he contin-
ued the fight to protect life and stand 
up against injustice abroad. He worked 
hand-in-hand with Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo in condemning the Chi-
nese Communist Party for its regime of 
forced abortions and sterilizations. 
Throughout his long and commend-
able career in public service, Ambas-
sador Brownback has shown a remark-
able commitment to the sanctity of 
life. As the Supreme Court prepares to 
hear the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization case, I am pleased 
to rise to recognize leaders in the pro- 
life movement who have advanced the 
cause 
to 
this 
point. 
Ambassador 
Brownback is definitely among those 
leaders for his many years as a cham-
pion for life.

TRIBUTE TO SEAN DUFFY 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, as the U.S. Supreme Court pre-
pares to hear oral arguments in Dobbs 
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion case, I am taking time to recog-
nize leaders in the pro-life movement 
who have helped bring us to this point. 
Today, I pay tribute to former Con-
gressman Sean Duffy, who represented 
the pro-life values of the Seventh Dis-
trict of Wisconsin for five terms from 
2011–2019. 
Throughout his time in the House, 
Representative Duffy remained unwav-
ering in his commitment to the sanc-
tity of life. Whatever pro-life issue

S8440 
November 18, 2021 
arose, Representative Duffy was there 
to defend the unborn and the value of 
all life. 
As religious liberty issues entered in 
the debate over the Affordable Care 
Act—ACA—Representative 
Duffy 
fought to keep taxpayer funding from 
covering 
abortions 
in 
ACA 
health 
plans. His opposition was part of his 
larger effort to oppose taxpayer fund-
ing for abortion in any arena, a fight 
embodied in his support of the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act. 
As our Nation a few years later 
learned of the horrors perpetrated by 
notorious abortionist Kermit Gosnell, 
Representative 
Duffy 
took 
to 
the 
House floor to highlight the evil of 
abortion as shown in Gosnell’s case. 
When videos revealed that Planned 
Parenthood was illegally selling fetal 
tissue from aborted babies, Representa-
tive Duffy joined his colleagues in call-
ing for an investigation into this trav-
esty. His pro-life leadership role led to 
an appointment to the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee’s Select In-
vestigative Panel on Planned Parent-
hood that investigated that organiza-
tion’s illegal fetal tissue sales. 
A true pro-life hero, Representative 
Duffy leads by example in living out 
his pro-life values. On August 2019, 
Representative Duffy announced his 
resignation to focus on his ninth child 
who was born with heart defects and 
Down’s syndrome. 
Representative Duffy, along with his 
wife Rachel Campos-Duffy, stands as 
an inspirational example of how to 
champion pro-life and pro-family val-
ues in both public roles and in private 
lives. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BETHANY KOZMA 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to recognize Bethany 
Kozma, former Deputy Chief of Staff at 
the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development—USAID. She de-
serves to be honored for her tireless 
work during the last administration to 
execute pro-life, pro-family, and pro-re-
ligious freedom policies across USAID. 
While her efforts in this regard gar-
nered criticism, Mrs. Kozma remained 
resolute in advancing the Agency’s 
firm pro-life positions. Her courage is 
an example to us all to cling tightly to 
our strongly held values, even in face 
of criticism. 
Standing strong, Mrs. Kozma played 
an integral role in helping the U.S. De-
partment of State, USAID, and the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services better synchronize their ef-
forts in countless multilateral negotia-
tions. This synergy helped ensure that 
the agreements formed by those nego-
tiations did not promote or permit 
abortion. 
In my own work here in the Senate, 
I know staff members toiling behind 
the scenes do important work that al-
lows me to do my job successfully. No 
doubt, that is also true in the execu-
tive branch. 
The work of dedicated agency staff 
like Mrs. Kozma was integral to the 
many pro-life successes of the past ad-
ministration. Her tireless work helped 
ensure the United States could lead in 
pro-life policies abroad. Mrs. Kozma 
and others like her deserve recognition 
and our gratitude. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE POMPEO 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to pay tribute to former 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Dur-
ing Mr. Pompeo’s time at the State De-
partment, he worked tirelessly to de-
fend unborn children around the world. 
Under then-Secretary Pompeo’s leader-
ship, the United States stood as a na-
tion that values all human rights, in-
cluding the right to life. His bold lead-
ership encouraged other world leaders 
to join the United States in standing 
against efforts by some within the 
United Nations to make abortion on 
demand an international right. 
Mr. Pompeo established his pro-life 
bona fides during his four terms in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. During 
that time, he supported numerous 
pieces of pro-life legislation, such as 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion 
Act and the Pain Capable Unborn Child 
Protection Act. 
His commitment to the pro-life cause 
continued in his role as our Nation’s 
top diplomat. A few particular suc-
cesses stand out. 
First, Secretary Pompeo initiated a 
new compliance mechanism to ensure 
enforcement of the Mexico City Policy, 
which prohibits taxpayer dollars from 
being used for abortion overseas. Under 
the Protecting Life in Global Health 
Assistance policy, the State Depart-
ment would refuse to partner with any 
foreign organizations involved in sup-
porting abortions. Additionally, these 
nongovernment organizations will also 
have to provide certification to the 
State Department that they are not in-
volved with abortions. This highly suc-
cessful policy closed an overwhelming 
proportion of the loopholes that had 
previously allowed organizations to 
skirt compliance with the Mexico City 
Policy. 
Second, Secretary Pompeo ensured 
full 
enforcement 
of 
the 
Siljander 
amendment, an annual rider in the 
State and foreign operations appropria-
tions bill to prohibit the use of U.S. 
funds, including foreign assistance, to 
lobby for or against abortion abroad. 
Third, the Department of State led 
the United States to sign the Geneva 
Consensus Declaration in 2020, which 
reaffirmed ‘‘that there is no inter-
national right to abortion.’’ Thirty- 
three other nations, representing more 
than 1.6 billion people, also signed the 
declaration, 
an 
achievement 
that 
would not have been possible without 
American leadership on the issue. 
Finally, Pompeo’s Department of 
State in 2020 also sanctioned China for 
its many human rights abuses, includ-
ing forced abortions and forced steri-
lizations. 
These accomplishments make clear 
that former Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo made true strides in vigor-
ously defending the right to life of the 
unborn babies around the globe. His en-
deavors deserve our applause and grati-
tude. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MORSE TAN 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to pay tribute to Morse 
Tan, former Ambassador at Large for 
Global Criminal Justice, whose dedica-
tion to the legal defense of human 
rights and the rights of the unborn is 
commendable. 
Morse Tan’s work to promote these 
values has spanned the globe. As an ex-
pert on North Korea, he has written ex-
tensively 
about 
the 
human 
rights 
abuses occurring in that country and 
how those responsible can be held ac-
countable. In his book, ‘‘North Korea, 
International Law and the Dual Crises: 
Narrative and Constructive Engage-
ment,’’ Tan sheds light on the genocide 
of Christians in North Korea, focusing 
specifically on the forced abortions im-
posed on many North Korean women. 
As Ambassador at Large for Global 
Criminal Justice during the last ad-
ministration, Ambassador Tan worked 
to gather evidence of China’s repressive 
treatment of the Uyghurs and other 
ethnic 
minorities, 
including 
forced 
abortions 
and 
forced 
sterilizations. 
Based in part on the Ambassador’s 
work, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
in July 2020 imposed sanctions on Chi-
nese officials because of human rights 
abuses. 
Furthermore, 
Secretary 
Pompeo determined that China had 
committed crimes against humanity 
and genocide against the Uyghurs and 
other ethnic minority groups, based on 
the findings of an internal review led 
by Ambassador Tan. 
Ambassador Tan has also undertaken 
significant work on behalf of the sanc-
tity of life in the United States as well. 
He has filed amicus briefs in two Su-
preme Court cases regarding pro-life 
issues. In McCorvey v. Hill, Ambas-
sador Tan coordinated, researched, and 
edited some 24 amicus briefs on behalf 
of Norma McCorvey, who was the 
plaintiff ‘‘Jane Roe’’ in Roe v. Wade. In 
Cano v. Baker, he coordinated, re-
searched, and edited 22 amicus briefs 
on behalf of Sandra Cano, who was the 
plaintiff ‘‘Mary Doe’’ in Doe v. Bolton. 
Finally, I hope that Ambassador 
Tan’s work as a law professor in 
courses such as bioethics, international 
human rights, and constitutional law 
will inspire a new generation to take 
up the legal fight to protect the sanc-
tity of life. 
It is an honor to recognize Ambas-
sador Morse Tan for his uncompro-
mising work to defend the right of the 
unborn babies in courts and to bring 
justice and accountability for perpetra-
tors of forced abortions around the 
world.

TRIBUTE TO ANN WAGNER 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to recognize Congress-
woman ANN WAGNER, who represents 
the Second Congressional District of 
Missouri in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. Throughout her tenure in 
the House; Representative WAGNER has 
remained an outspoken champion for 
life. 
Representative 
WAGNER
has 
worked to protect unborn life, through 
her vocal support of the Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act and so 
many 
other 
pieces 
of 
pro-life 
legisltaion. 
Additionally, 
she 
has 
helped lead the charge to prevent tax-
payer funding of abortion on-demand. 
This public servant’s efforts to pro-
tect vulnerable children from sexual 
exploitation and trafficking are par-
ticularly inspirational. She has fought 
hard for legislation that would increase 
the penalties for criminals who profit 
from sexual exploitation of innocent 
children. 
Representative 
WAGNER’s 
commit-
ment to children both inside and out-
side the womb is commendable. I know 
I take inspiration from her years of 
work on behalf of vulnerable children. 
Therefore, I offer my praise and grati-
tude for that work as the U.S. Supreme 
Court takes up Dobbs v. Jackson Wom-
en’s Health Organization, a case that 
could significantly change the land-
scape in terms of protecting young 
lives.

ADAMS STATE UNIVERSITY 
CENTENNIAL 
∑ Mr. BENNET. Madam President, it is 
my honor to congratulate Adams State 
University on 100 years of educating 
students in Alamosa, CO. The school 
was established on May 4, 1921, as 
Adams State Normal School by the 
Colorado 
Legislature 
following 
the 
tireless advocacy of Colorado State 
Representative

Adams State now has more than 3,000 
students enrolled in 27 bachelor’s de-
gree programs, nine master’s degree 
programs, and one Ph.D. degree pro-
gram. 
Located in the San Luis Valley with 
deep Hispano roots, Adams State was 
the first federally designated Hispanic 
serving institution in Colorado. The 
school has also fostered an elite dis-
tance-running culture over decades 
after hosting the U.S. Olympic Mara-
thon Trials in August 1968.

RECOGNIZING THE 2020–2021 
NATIONAL FFA OFFICER TEAM 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the 2020–2021 
National FFA officer team who re-
cently retired at the 94th National 
FFA Convention and Expo in Indianap-
olis, IN. Team members include presi-
dent Doster Harper of Georgia, central 
region vice president Paxton Dahmer 
of Missouri, eastern region vice presi-
dent Miriam Hoffman of Illinois, west-
ern region vice president David Lopez 
of California, southern region vice 
president Artha Jonassaint of Florida, 
and from my home State of Arkansas, 
National FFA secretary Anna Mathis. 
The Future Farmers of America was 
founded in 1928 by a group of young 
farmers with dreams of developing an 
organization to address the challenges 
of feeding a growing population. Their 
leadership was founded on their experi-
ence and passion for agricultural pur-
suits. Now known as the National FFA 
Organization to represent its diverse 
membership, FFA grows the next gen-
eration of leaders, builds communities, 
and strengthens agriculture. There are 
735,038 middle and high school FFA 
members in 8,817 chapters in all 50 
States and Puerto Rico. 
Each year, six student members are 
elected to represent FFA as a national 
officer. They serve the organization at 
the highest level, promoting FFA and 
inspiring 
members, 
advisers, 
staff, 
teachers, 
alumni, 
and 
supporters. 
These individuals pause their edu-
cational pursuits and other commit-
ments for an entire year in order to 
fully dedicate themselves to bettering 
the organization and the agricultural 
industry. National FFA officers spend 
time attending, speaking at, and facili-
tating FFA camps, conferences, and 
conventions and often meet with do-
nors, stakeholders, and alumni. Addi-
tionally, national officers serve as 
members of the National FFA board of 
directors, a testament to FFA being a 
student-led organization. It is no secret 
that these young leaders have a pro-
found impact on the future of the orga-
nization and agriculture. 
The 2020–2021 National FFA officer 
team led the organization with char-
acter, determination, and grit in the 
midst of a global pandemic. During this 
year and a half when many schools 
moved online and extracurricular ac-
tivities at school, such as FFA, were 
unable to meet and continue normally, 
it is remarkable that, under this 
team’s leadership, the number of FFA 
chapters in the organization increased 
despite the hardships faced. Their ten-
ure as a national officer concluded 
after planning and leading the 94th Na-
tional FFA Convention and Expo. The 
largest youth convention in the coun-
try, this year’s convention drew over 
60,000 registered attendees. 
Behind every great team are hosts of 
people who support them. I commend 
the families, staff, advisers, teachers, 
mentors, students, alumni, and others 
who supported these leaders and FFA. 
Their tenacity and leadership is en-
couraging to those they serve and to 
myself. I had the opportunity to visit 
with these national officers during 
their year of service. It has been an 
honor to meet and interact with this 
team. I am ever-increasingly opti-
mistic about the future of agriculture, 
especially with passionate, dedicated 
leaders like themselves at the helm. 
Doster, Anna, Paxton, Miriam, David, 
and Artha, I wish you the best in your 
future endeavors and congratulate you 
for your year of service as the 2020–2021 
National FFA officer team.∑

CONGRATULATING THE KINDRED 
HIGH SCHOOL VIKINGS 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, for 
the second time this year, I have the 
privilege of congratulating my alma 
mater, Kindred High School, on a State 
championship. 
In March, my hometown school cele-
brated the boys basketball team’s first- 
ever 
State 
championship. 
Eight 
months later, on November 12, the Kin-
dred Vikings football team won the 
State 11B title at the Dakota Bowl 
State Football Tournament. The Vi-
kings defeated longtime rivals, the No. 
1-ranked Hillsboro-Central Valley Bur-
ros, by a score of 37 to 14, for the cham-
pionship. They had earlier won their 
first three games, defeating Lisbon, 
Central Cass, and Bishop Ryan teams. 
This was the first State champion-
ship for the Vikings since State play-
offs sponsored by the North Dakota 
High 
School 
Activities 
Association 
began in 1975. They had made only one 
other Dakota Bowl appearance in 2016. 
To advance to the tournament this 
year, 
the 
Vikings 
defeated 
the 
Langdon-Edmore-Munich 
Cardinals, 
which had played in every Dakota Bowl 
since 2016. 
Graduating 
from 
Kindred 
High 
School in 1979, I lettered for 4 years in 
football, basketball and track. I was 
the starting quarterback my junior and 
senior years, and our team was bad, me 
especially. 
Knowing firsthand what it is like to 
persevere on a losing team, watching 
these Kindred Vikings, who ended the 
season with a 12–1 record, was thrilling. 
I saw very talented athletes excel by 
tapping into the strength of each play-
er. Notably, the impressive skills of 
running back Trey Heinrich did not go 
unnoticed when he was named the 
MaxPreps North Dakota Player of the 
Year. 
I want to recognize this year’s team 
members

Nate Safe, and Ryan Sunram and all 
the hometown fans on winning this 
championship. 
I join the rest of North Dakota in 
thanking the Kindred Vikings for in-
spiring all of us to achieve excellence. 
For the second time this year, they 
have 
demonstrated 
what 
can 
be 
achieved by combining faith and pas-
sion with determination and team-

TRIBUTE TO JOHN D. BECKETT 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, with the U.S. Supreme Court set 
to consider Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization in oral arguments 
on December 1, 2021, I am taking time 
to recognize individuals whose dedica-
tion to the pro-life cause has led us to 
this point. In this case, I pay tribute to 
Mr. John D. Beckett from Elyria, OH. 
His activities have been intertwined 
with championing pro-life and religious 
freedom. 
Mr. Beckett graduated from the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology in 
1960, after which he initially worked as 
an engineer in the aerospace industry. 
In 1963, he joined his father’s small 
manufacturing business, R.W. Beckett 
Corporation, and 2 years later became 
president following his father’s death. 
Under Mr. Beckett’s leadership, this 
small company grew over time to be-
come a worldwide leader in producing 
engineered components for residential 
and commercial heating. With its af-
filiates, the company employs nearly 
1,000 people. 
In addition to his business endeavors, 
Mr. Beckett has long been active in 
both church and community-related 
activities. This is where he has estab-
lished himself as a champion of the 
pro-life movement. 
In 1973, Mr. Beckett became a found-
ing member of the Intercessors for 
America, a national prayer organiza-
tion, and he continues to serve on the 
board 
today. 
The 
Intercessors 
for 
America has helped lead grassroots ef-
forts for people of faith to unite in 
prayer for the pro-life movement and 
for the unborn. In addition, he also be-
came a founding board member of 
King’s College in New York City, a 
Christian university, and he also serves 
on the board of Cru—Campus Crusade 
for 
Christ 
International.

these 
community 
activities, 
Mr. 
Beckett also found time to become a 
published author, writing two books 
about faith in the workplace. 
For these business and community 
activities, Mr. Beckett has received nu-
merous accolades. He received an hon-
orary doctor of law degree from both 
Spring Arbor University in 2002 and 
also from King’s College in 2008. He was 
also named Christian Businessman of 
the Year by the Christian Broadcasting 
Network in 1999 and the Entrepreneur 
of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2003. 
Today, he resides in Elyria, OH, with 
his wife, Wendy, to whom he has been 
married since 1961. 
I am thankful to John D. Beckett for 
his support of many nonprofit organi-
zations that defend the rights of the 
unborn and religious freedom. His work 
in helping establish the Intercessors 
for America has led to untold numbers 
of prayers being raised for the pro-life 
movement. I am pleased to honor his 
work through that organization as well 
as his lifetime of service to so many 
worthy causes.∑

TRIBUTE TO PHIL BRYANT 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I am honored to pay tribute to 
former Governor Phil Bryant of Mis-
sissippi. While there are many things 
for which the Governor deserves praise, 
today I specifically want to speak 
about Governor Bryant’s stalwart work 
during his term of office from 2012–2020 
to protect and defend the most vulner-
able of our society: unborn children. 
While running for office, Phil Bryant 
promised Mississippians that he would 
work tirelessly as Governor to protect 
the rights of the unborn. He fulfilled 
that promise. Throughout two terms in 
office, Governor Bryant was a driving 
force behind legislative efforts to pro-
tect life in Mississippi. 
In April 2012, Governor Bryant signed 
Mississippi House Bill 1390. This bill re-
quired abortion practitioners to be cer-
tified as obstetrician-gynecologists and 
to maintain admitting privileges at a 
local hospital. Through these require-
ments, 
this 
legislation 
sought 
to 
strengthen abortion regulations and 
ensure that women receive quality care 
for any complications following an 
abortion. 
In April 2014, Governor Bryant signed 
Mississippi House Bill 1400, banning 
abortions performed after 20 weeks. 
This legislation cited a plethora of 
medical evidence, showing that a baby 
can feel pain at this stage, and that 
pregnant 
women 
are 
at 
increased 
health risks, even death, when under-
going later-term abortion procedures. 
Additionally, 
Governor 
Bryant 
signed into law the Unborn Child Pro-
tection from Dismemberment Abortion 
Act in 2016, banning dismemberment 
abortions or those involving the prac-
tice known as D&E or ‘‘dilation and 
evacuation.’’ Dismemberment is the 
most prevalent method of second tri-
mester abortion, accounting for 96 per-
cent of all second trimester abortions. 
With the enactment of this law, Gov-
ernor Bryant not only banned these 
violent 
dismemberment 
procedures 
from taking place in the Mississippi, he 
also prohibited the illegal trafficking 
of the bodies of aborted babies in Mis-
sissippi. 
Governor Bryant did not stop there 
and continued working to keep his 
promise 
to 
make 
Mississippi 
‘‘the 
safest place in America’’ for unborn ba-
bies. In 2018, he signed the Gestational 
Age Act, which banned abortions after 
15 weeks in most cases. It is this law 
being challenged at the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health. 
Throughout all of these laws, Gov-
ernor 
Bryant 
maintained 
steadfast 
courage and held tightly to his promise 
to the people of Mississippi to fight 
continuously to protect the unborn. I 
love what he once said when groups 
threatened legal action against our 
State’s pro-life legislation. He said, 
‘‘We will all answer to the good Lord 
one day. I will say in this instance, ‘I 
fought for the lives of innocent babies, 
even under threat of legal action.’ ’’ 
That is indeed true. When his time 
comes, Governor Bryant can stand tall 
before the Lord, having fought the 
good fight to protect the unborn. And 
indeed, when the Supreme Court hears 
oral arguments in the Dobbs case on 
December 1, Governor Bryant can 
smile in the knowledge that his work 
was not in vain. 
For all these reasons, I call attention 
to Governor Phil Bryant. He deserves 
laudable recognition for his 8-year 
fight to protect and defend the right to 
life for the unborn babies in the womb, 
reflecting the character and values of 
the people of our State, Mississippi.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BECKY CURRIE 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, it is an honor to pay tribute to 
Representative Becky Currie, a mem-
ber of the Mississippi House of Rep-
resentatives, who authored the Gesta-
tional Age Act. It is this State law that 
underlies the U.S. Supreme Court’s 
consideration of Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s 
Health 
Organization 
this 
term. 
When the Supreme Court hears oral 
arguments on Dobbs on December 1, 
2021, it will hear a defense of the pro- 
life cause generating from the work of 
Becky Currie, my friend and my rep-
resentative. In the Mississippi House, 
she represents district 92, which covers 
my hometown of Brookhaven. 
Becky’s forethought in introducing 
this bill and shepherding it through the 
State legislature has led us to the 
point where the Supreme Court is con-
sidering a direct challenge to Roe v. 
Wade. By prohibiting most abortions 
after 15 weeks, the Gestational Age Act 
presents 
directly 
the 
question 
of 
whether Roe’s viability standard re-
mains good law. 
Becky’s background as a nurse, her 
tenacious personality, and her heart 
for the unborn made her the perfect 
person to sponsor this important bill. 
She knows how to fight and isn’t afraid 
of criticism. Her stubborn persistence 
in promoting policies to protect the 
unborn has made Mississippi a safer 
place for women and their babies. 
Through the Supreme Court’s consider-
ation of her bill, Becky Currie has the 
potential to do that for our entire Na-
tion. 
As the Supreme Court prepares to 
hear oral arguments in the Dobbs case, 
we are all indebted to Representative 
Currie’s her courage and tenacity in 
sponsoring the Gestational Age Act. 
Praise God for bringing us this far. I 
also pray that He will continue to work 
through Representative Currie, using 
her law to overrule Roe v. Wade and 
make our Nation a safer place for the 
unborn and their mothers.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARK LEE DICKSON 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to pay tribute to Pastor 
Mark Lee Dickson of Longview, TX, 
who founded the Sanctuary Cities for 
the Unborn Initiative in 2019. This in-
novative organization works to encour-
age cities and towns to adopt ordi-
nances declaring themselves as Sanc-
tuary Cities for the Unborn. 
Under Pastor Dickson’s leadership, 
this grassroots Sanctuary Cities for 
the Unborn movement has saved many 
babies throughout the Nation in 41 
towns and cities that have adopted 
these ordinances. 
This is not the only way that Pastor 
Dickson 
has 
dedicated 
himself 
to 
championing the pro-life movement. 
He also serves as the director of Grass-
roots for Right to Life of East Texas 
and as the senior pastor of Sovereign 
Love Church in Longview. 
Across our Nation, pro-life citizens of 
all ages and backgrounds represent the 
backbone of the grassroots movement 
to protect the unborn. Individuals like 
Pastor Dickson who take it on them-
selves to help promote life and prevent 
abortion in their own communities 
drive the passion in this movement. 
The Pastor Dickson and millions of 
other Americans have kept this issue 
salient for our political discourse and 
has led us to the place where the U.S. 
Supreme Court will be reconsidering 
its misguided abortion jurisprudence 
established by Roe v. Wade when it 
takes up a challenge to a Mississippi 
law banning most abortions after 15 
weeks gestation. In Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s 
Health 
Organization, 
the 
stage is set for the potential over-
turning of Roe and returning the issue 
of abortion to the States. 
I pray for Pastor Dickson and that 
God would raise up more like him. Pas-
tor Dickson’s example shows that the 
courage of one person can make a dif-
ference.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

November 18, 2021 
TRIBUTE TO LYNN FITCH 
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to pay tribute to Mis-
sissippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch. 
My State has much to be proud of in 
Attorney General Fitch as the first Re-
publican to hold this office in almost 
150 years and as Mississippi’s first fe-
male attorney general ever. 
Specifically today, I rise to honor her 
for her unwavering fight to defend Mis-
sissippi’s pro-life laws. Attorney Gen-
eral Fitch is representing the State of 
Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Wom-
en’s Health Organization at the U.S. 
Supreme Court this term. This case is 
the most anticipated abortion case to 
reach the Court since Casey v. Planned 
Parenthood in 1992, nearly 30 years ago. 
In the Dobbs case, Attorney General 
Fitch is defending a challenge to Mis-
sissippi House bill 1510, the Gestational 
Age Act Enacted in 2018, this legisla-
tion bans most abortions after 15 weeks 
gestation. By consistently defending 
this law all the way up to the Supreme 
Court, Attorney General Fitch has set 
the stage for the Court to consider 
overturning Roe v. Wade and return 
the issue of abortion to the States. 
The Dobbs case presents the strong-
est challenge to Roe in our lifetime. It 
is 
encouraging 
that 
the 
Supreme 
Court, with its first conservative ma-
jority in many years, will hear argu-
ments on the merits of this Mississippi 
law. I am so proud that our female Mis-
sissippi Attorney General will be in the 
courtroom to defend our law in this 
case. 
In arguing for the Court to recon-
sider Roe in the State’s brief in the 
case, Attorney General Fitch said, 
‘‘There are those who would like to be-
lieve that Roe v. Wade settled the issue 
of abortion once and for all. But all it 
did was establish a special-rules regime 
for abortion jurisprudence that has left 
these cases out of step with other 
Court decisions and neutral principles 
of law applied by the Court. As a re-
sult, state legislatures, and the people 
they represent, have lacked clarity in 
passing laws to protect legitimate pub-
lic interests, and artificial guideposts 
have stunted important public debate 
on how we, as a society, care for the 
dignity of women and their children.’’ 
I wholeheartedly agree. The unlim-
ited-abortion regime created by the 
Roe decision was wrong when it was 
handed down, and it is wrong now. It is 
bad for the unborn, and it is bad for 
women. I hope the Supreme Court rec-
ognizes that when it hears oral argu-
ments in the Dobbs case on December 
1. 
I am confident Attorney General 
Fitch will make our State proud by 
steadfastly defending Mississippi’s law 
to protect unborn. Mississippians are 
proud to have this champion for life 
representing our State in this land-
mark case. I am praying for General 
Fitch and for her staff as they prepare 
to continue the fight to defend life be-
fore the highest court in the land.∑ 
RECOGNIZING INTERNS 
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Madam President, I am 
proud to host a number of interns from 
Nevada in my office, all of whom have 
contributed greatly to my work in the 
U.S. Senate. I know I speak for my col-
leagues as well when I say that many 
of our interns have enjoyed and bene-
fited from a wonderful program oper-
ated by the Stennis Center for Public 
Service. This program is designed to 
enhance the internship experience for 
exceptional 
future 
leaders, 
giving 
young Americans an inside look at how 
Congress works and an opportunity to 
learn from bipartisan senior staffers 
and foster bipartisan relationships that 
will carry some of them through their 
career supporting Congress. 
Stennis interns are selected based on 
their employment experience, college 
course load, and future service to Con-
gress. This fall, 32 interns were chosen 
to be a part of this prestigious experi-
ence. These interns serve us on both 
sides of the aisle, working for Demo-
crats and Republicans in the House and 
Senate, including one exceptional in-
tern in my office who was awarded this 
opportunity: Natalie Gilbert of Las 
Vegas, NV. 
Natalie is an impressive young Ne-
vadan, having earned the distinguished 
honors of State of Nevada Mock Trial 
Outstanding Attorney and National 
Merit Commended Scholar in 2020. Be-
fore interning with my office, she in-
terned with the Clark County District 
Attorney’s Office in the homicide and 
domestic violence departments and 
worked directly with their victim ad-
vocacy program. Surpassing over 100 
hours of volunteer service, Natalie has 
been an invaluable member of our Las 
Vegas community. I am proud to recog-
nize Natalie and her incredible efforts. 
I wish her only the best as she con-
tinues to pursue her studies in political 
economy and justice and peace studies 
at Georgetown University. 
In addition to Natalie, I would like to 
congratulate all of the Stennis interns 
on their completion of this exceptional 
program. I also thank the Stennis Cen-
ter and their senior Fellows for pro-
viding a meaningful experience and fos-
tering bipartisan work. 
I ask that the names of the 2021 Fall 
Stennis congressional interns and the 
offices in which they work be printed 
in the RECORD.

TRIBUTE TO LAUREN CARSON 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to honor an accom-
plished policymaker, a protector of en-
vironmental and public health, and my 
State representative: Lauren Carson. 
Representative 
Carson 
represents 
Rhode Island’s 75th district and has a 
long history of working on issues re-
lated to sea level rise, reducing waste, 
and protecting the health and safety of 
Rhode Islanders. 
Representative Carson holds a bach-
elor’s degree from Ramapo College and 
two master’s degrees from the Univer-
sity 
of 
Rhode 
Island. 
She 
is 
a 
businessowner and an environmental 
advocate who worked for several years 
with Clean Water Action. 
Representative Carson also served 
her community through several organi-
zations, including the advisory board of 
the Alliance for a Livable Newport, the 
Newport 
Energy 
and 
Environment 
Commission, the Rhode Island Green 
Infrastructure Coalition, and the Envi-
ronmental Council of Rhode Island. 
In 2014, Representative Carson suc-
cessfully ran for a seat in the State 
legislature. At the statehouse, she has 
moved policy forward to protect Rhode 
Island’s environment. Among many 
other accomplishments, Ms. Carson 
created and led a commission on the ef-
fects of rising seas. She introduced a 
bill that created a uniform statewide 
process for permitting solar panel in-
stallations. She cosponsored legisla-
tion to phase out polluting cesspools. 
Earlier this year, she was appointed as, 
deputy majority leader, a role which 
she used to steward the 2021 Act on Cli-
mate into law, setting statewide net- 
zero goals for 2050 across all sectors. 
She coleads the Aquidneck Island Cli-
mate Caucus to give voice to the im-
portance of preventing and preparing 
for a warmer world and focus the is-
land’s efforts on sea level rise. 
I am glad to recognize Representa-
tive Carson’s dedicated service and to 
share my appreciation for all of her 
contributions to our State and our en-
vironment.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAWN EUER 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-

happens to also be my State Senator, 
Dawn Euer. All of us whom have 
worked with Senator Euer recognize 
her deep commitment to Rhode Island 
and to safeguarding the future of the 
planet by fighting the climate crisis. 
Senator Euer earned a law degree 
from Roger Williams University. While 
in law school, she served as a legal in-
tern in my office, where I saw firsthand 
her dedication to public service and to 
using the law to better the lives of oth-
ers. 
Senator Euer began her political ca-
reer as an activist and organizer. She 
was instrumental in the fight to make 
gay marriage the law of the land in 
Rhode Island. 
Senator Euer has served on the 
boards of the Environmental Justice 
League of Rhode Island and Bike New-
port. She has also advised the Newport 
City Council on energy efficiency, re-
newables, sustainable planning, and 
other environmental matters. 
In 2017, Senator Euer successfully ran 
to represent parts of Newport and 
Jamestown in the Rhode Island State 
Senate. Running in a district on the 
front lines of climate change and sea 
level rise, Senator Euer advocated for 
substantial investments in renewable 
energy and resiliency. In the last legis-
lative session, Senator Euer delivered 
on that promise in a big way. She suc-
ceeded in passing the Act on Climate 
bill, the most comprehensive climate 
legislation in State history. As the 
lead sponsor, Senator Euer developed 
an actionable plan to create mandatory 
and enforceable emissions reduction 
goals that chart a course to a safer fu-
ture. With that legislative victory in 
hand, Senator Euer recently traveled 
to COP26 in Glasgow to help show the 
world that American climate leader-
ship is back. 
For my friend Senator Euer’s tireless 
efforts in championing the 2021 Act on 
Climate and for all of her hard work on 
behalf of the people of Newport and 
Jamestown, I stand today to recognize 
her.∑

TRIBUTE TO MEG KERR 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to honor Meg Kerr, a 
staunch advocate for the environ-
mental movement. Ms. Kerr retired 
earlier this year after a successful ca-
reer of climate leadership and service 
to the State of Rhode Island. 
After graduating from Brown Univer-
sity and the University of North Caro-
lina, Ms. Kerr began the early part of 
her career as a scientist. She worked 
for 
the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency across North Carolina, Vir-
ginia, and Washington, D.C., where she 
partnered with States to standardize 
water quality reporting aligned with 
the Clean Water Act. 
Ms. Kerr then moved back to Rhode 
Island and quickly established herself 
as a prominent advocate for the envi-
ronment, taking on roles at the Rhode 
Island Rivers Council, the Narragan-
sett Bay Estuary Program, and Clean 
Water Action. Ms. Kerr closed out her 
impressive career as the Audubon Soci-
ety of Rhode Island’s Senior Director 
of Policy. 
To add to the list of her accomplish-
ments, Ms. Kerr was a founder of the 
Rhode Island Green Infrastructure Coa-
lition and helped launch the Provi-
dence Stormwater Innovation Center. 
She also helped found the annual Land 
and Water Conservation Summit that 
brought together hundreds of environ-
mentalists from the State and region 
for over a decade. Ms. Kerr is pas-
sionate about pollinators, as dem-
onstrated by her work organizing the 
Bee Rally to bring attention to the 
threats faced by our beloved bugs. 
Ms. Kerr is a fierce and respected 
leader for the environment and a famil-
iar face at the Rhode Island state-
house. Her expertise, mentorship of 
others, and ability to get things done 
for Rhode Island’s environmental com-
munity has made a real mark on our 
State. I am proud to recognize her 
service and thank her for all she has 
done to protect our environment.∑

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Consistent with subsection 204(b) of 
the 
International 
Emergency 
Eco-
nomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. l703(b), I 
hereby report that I have issued an Ex-
ecutive Order that terminates the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, and 
revokes that Executive Order. 
The President issued Executive Order 
13712 to deal with the unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity and foreign policy of the United 
States constituted by the situation in 
Burundi, which had been marked by 
the killing of and violence against ci-
vilians, unrest, incitement of immi-
nent violence, and significant political 
repression. In Executive Order 13712, 
the President addressed the threat by 
blocking the property and interests in 
property of, among others, persons de-
termined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of State, to be responsible for or

complicit in actions or policies that 
threaten the peace, security, and sta-
bility of Burundi or undermine demo-
cratic processes or institutions in Bu-
rundi, or to have engaged in human 
rights abuses. 
I have determined that the situation 
in Burundi that gave rise to the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13712 has been significantly al-
tered by events of the past year, in-
cluding the transfer of power following 
elections in 2020, significantly de-
creased 
violence, 
and 
President 
Ndayishimiye’s 
pursuit 
of 
reforms 
across multiple sectors. For these rea-
sons I have determined that it is nec-
essary to terminate the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 13712 
and revoke that order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. DURBIN): 
S. 3233. A bill to help increase the de-
velopment, distribution, and use of 
clean cookstoves and fuels to improve 
health, protect the climate and envi-
ronment, empower women, create jobs, 
and help consumers save time and 
money; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Clean Cooking 
Support Act. I am pleased to be joined 
in this effort by my friend and col-
league, Senator DURBIN. Our bill aims 
to address a serious global public 
health and environmental issue where 
leadership by the United States can 
make a real difference. 
Today, close to 3 billion people, or 
one-third of the global population, rely 
on ‘‘dirty cooking,’’ such as open fires 
or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe 
cookstoves that use agricultural waste, 
coal, dung, wood, charcoal, or other 
solid fuels, to cook their meals. The 
majority of people using these types of 
cookstoves and fuels are in developing 
countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin 
America. 
Exposure to smoke from these tradi-
tional cooking methods and open fires, 
referred to as ‘‘household air pollu-
tion,’’ causes chronic and acute dis-
eases such as lung cancer, heart dis-
ease, 
and 
stroke. 
Alarmingly, 
the 
household air pollution caused by tra-
ditional cookstoves and open tires 
causes 4 million premature deaths an-
nually, 
including 
400,000 
children 
younger than 5 years of age, most of 
whom 
live 
in 
sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
Women and girls are disproportion-
ately affected, as they spend hours 
cooking, inhaling toxic smoke, and col-
lecting fuels. 
These cookstoves also create serious 
environmental problems. Household air 
pollution does not remain in the home; 
it contributes to more than 10 percent 
of global ambient air pollution. Ac-
cording to the EPA, greenhouse gas 
emissions from nonrenewable wood 
fuels for cooking amount to 2 percent 
of the global CO2 emissions, on par 
with the global CO2 emissions from the 
aviation or shipping industries. In 2019, 
more than 600,000 deaths were attrib-
uted to ambient air pollution stem-
ming from the household combustion 
of solid fuels. 
These cookstoves should be replaced 
with modern alternatives to reverse 
these alarming health and environ-
mental trends. Since 2010, the Clean 
Cooking Alliance, an innovative pub-
lic-private partnership hosted by the 
United Nations Foundation, has sup-
ported the adoption of clean cooking 
worldwide, with the goal of achieving 
universal access to clean cooking by 
2030. Recognizing the serious health 
and environmental issues posed by tra-
ditional cookstoves, the Alliance aims 
to save lives, improve livelihoods, em-
power women, and combat pollution by 
creating a thriving global market for 
clean and efficient household cooking 
solutions. In April, President Biden an-
nounced that the U.S. is resuming and 
strengthening its commitment to the 
Clean Cooking Alliance, and during a 
recent presentation at the 2021 United 
Nations Climate Change Conference 
that covered clean cooking and house-
hold energy, EPA Administrator Mi-
chael Regan reaffirmed this under-
taking as well. 
Our legislation reinforces our coun-
try’s policy on promoting clean cook-
stoves and seeks to take a whole-of- 
government approach to address house-
hold air pollution. Specifically, the 
Clean Cooking Support Act would cre-
ate an interagency working group, 
with representatives from at least six 
different Federal agencies, committed 
to increasing access to clean cooking 
fuels and technologies worldwide. Our 
legislation explicitly spells out the role 
of each Federal agency in the advance-
ment of clean cooking as well. The De-
partment of Energy, for instance, is 
tasked with research and development 
to spur the production of low-cost, low- 
emission, and high-efficiency cook-
stoves, while the Department of State 
is directed to engage in diplomatic ac-
tivities across the globe to support the 
clean cooking and fuels sector. Finally, 
our bill would authorize funding for the 
U.S. Government to continue such ac-
tivities through 2027, to ensure that 
these important efforts to prevent un-
necessary illness and reduce pollution 
around the globe continue. 
Our legislation would directly benefit 
some of the world’s poorest people, in-
cluding the women and girls who are 
disproportionately affected, and reduce 
harmful pollution that affects us all. I 
urge my colleagues to join me and Sen-
ator DURBIN in supporting the Clean 
Cooking Support Act. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Ms. WARREN, Mr. 
BROWN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. 
HIRONO, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr.

456—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
A 
FREE, FAIR, AND PEACEFUL DE-
CEMBER 
4, 
2021, 
ELECTION 
IN 
THE GAMBIA 
Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. RISCH, 
Mr. LEAHY, Mr. COONS, Mr. ROUNDS, 
Mr. BOOZMAN, and Mr. CARDIN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 456 
Whereas, in 1965, The Gambia became inde-
pendent from Great Britain; 
Whereas, in 1970, The Gambia became a re-
public following a public referendum, and 
Dawda Jawara was elected president and 
subsequently reelected an additional five 
times; 
Whereas, from 1970 to 1994, The Gambia 
was one of Africa’s longest running democ-
racies and home to the continent’s human 
rights body, the African Commission on 
Human and People’s Rights; 
Whereas, in 1994, President Jawara was 
forcibly removed from office in a coup by the 
Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council 
(AFPRC), led by Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh; 
Whereas, after two years of direct AFPRC 
rule that was heavily criticized by the inter-
national community, a flawed constitutional 
reform process occurred and The Gambia 
scheduled a new presidential election; 
Whereas, in the lead up to the September 
1996 presidential election, the Jammeh mili-
tary government outlawed the country’s 
main opposition parties, restricted media 
freedom, prohibited meetings between rival 
candidates and foreign diplomats, and used 
soldiers to attack opposition rallies; 
Whereas Jammeh won the 1996 presidential 
election in a process widely regarded as 
flawed by international observers; 
Whereas President Jammeh won reelection 
in 2001, 2006, and 2011 in electoral processes 
marred by political repression, intimidation, 
and technical flaws; 
Whereas Jammeh’s presidency saw tar-
geted violence and widespread gross human 
rights violations, particularly against mem-
bers of the media, including the murder of 
editor Deyda Hydara and the disappearance 
of journalist Ebrima Manneh; 
Whereas President Jammeh personally or-
dered the kidnapping and torture of individ-
uals he accused of ‘‘witchcraft’’ and threat-
ened others over their sexual orientation; 
Whereas thousands of Gambians fled into 
exile out of concern for their safety, becom-
ing refugees in Africa at large and elsewhere; 
Whereas the Jammeh government’s human 
rights record was widely criticized by re-
gional 
and 
international 
human 
rights 
groups, as well as the United States, Euro-
pean Union, and members of the United 
States Senate; 
Whereas, in December 2016, opposition 
grand coalition candidate Adama Barrow, 
who campaigned on the promise of electoral 
and constitutional reform, won an upset 
election victory against President Jammeh; 
Whereas, immediately after the 2016 elec-
tion, Jammeh publicly accepted the defeat, 
but then later rejected the results and re-
fused to depart the presidency; 
Whereas Jammeh’s refusal to accept defeat 
was widely condemned, with the African 
Union refusing to recognize him as president 
and the Economic Community of West Afri-
can States deploying an international inter-
vention force to The Gambia; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2017, Barrow was 
sworn in as president at the Gambian Em-
bassy in Senegal; 
Whereas, on January 20, 2017, Jammeh and 
his family departed The Gambia, reportedly 
stealing more than $1,000,000,000 from state 
coffers, eventually to appear in Equatorial 
Guinea, where he remains in political exile 
with impunity; 
Whereas President Barrow initially agreed 
to limit his term to a three-year transition 
ending on January 19, 2020, but later stated 
his intent to serve the full five-year con-
stitutional term; 
Whereas the Gambian Truth, Reconcili-
ation, and Reparations Commission (TRRC) 
was established by an act of the Gambian 
Parliament to examine abuses committed 
during the Jammeh era and make rec-
ommendations as to whom to hold account-
able; 
Whereas more than 370 victims and former 
government officials testified at widely 
viewed TRRC hearings that documented 
widespread human rights abuses; 
Whereas the TRRC’s anticipated Sep-
tember 2021 final report submission to Presi-
dent Barrow was delayed; and 
Whereas The Gambia will hold the first 
post-Jammeh era presidential election on 
December 4, 2021, which will include six pres-
idential candidates: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Gambian people on 
the successful 2016 presidential election; 
(2) supports the courageous and necessary 
work of the Truth, Reconciliation, and Rep-
arations 
Commission 
to 
bring 
account-
ability, healing, and reconciliation to the 
nation; 
(3) calls on all parties and presidential can-
didates to participate in a free, fair, credible, 
and peaceful December 4, 2021, presidential 
election in The Gambia; and 
(4) expresses the support of the American 
people in The Gambia’s continued and note-
worthy democratic path forward.

RESOLUTION 
457—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF NOVEMBER 9, 
2021, 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
MICROTIA 
AND ATRESIA AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mrs. CAP-
ITO, and Mr. MARKEY) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 457 
Whereas microtia is a congenital anomaly, 
affecting the outer ear, where the ear does 
not fully develop during the first trimester 
of pregnancy; 
Whereas microtia is often accompanied by 
aural atresia, which is the absence or closure 
of the external auditory ear canal resulting 
in hearing loss; 
Whereas an estimated 750,000 people world-
wide have microtia; 
Whereas microtia is diagnosed at birth, af-
fecting 1 ear or both ears, but there is no un-
derstanding as to why microtia occurs; 
Whereas aural atresia is usually diagnosed 
at birth, affecting 1 ear or both ears, but in 
some cases may not be recognized until later 
in life; 
Whereas doctors and nurses may be well 
versed in the conditions and quickly educate 
and prepare parents; 
Whereas, in certain settings, the condi-
tions are rare enough that misinformation or 
lack of information quickly evaporates any 
remaining sense of celebration that accom-
panies a birth; and 
Whereas living with facial challenges such 
as craniofacial microsomia and hearing loss, 
as well as the longing for social acceptance, 
are some of the daily concerns for individ-
uals who are born with microtia or aural 
atresia: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
November 9, 2021, as ‘‘National Microtia and 
Atresia Awareness Day’’; 
(2) encourages each person of the United 
States— 
(A) to celebrate the community that is 
made up of not only children and adults with 
microtia or aural atresia, but families, 
teachers, advocates, and medical profes-
sionals from around the world who foster 
awareness and assistance; and 
(B) to help promote public awareness of 
microtia, aural atresia, and the hope that fu-
ture generations of families will leave the 
hospital equipped with more answers than 
questions, along with their dream for their 
child intact; 
(3) supports efforts to remove unnecessary 
barriers and replace them with resources and 
tools that aim to eliminate bullying and 
clear the way for an even more successful fu-
ture for those with microtia or atresia; 
(4) encourages Federal, State, and local 
policymakers to work together— 
(A) to raise awareness about microtia or 
atresia; 
(B) to improve proper diagnosis of microtia 
or atresia; and 
(C) to support advancements in technology 
that improve the lives of those with microtia 
and aural atresia; and 
(5) encourages the President to issue a 
proclamation calling upon the people of the 
United States to observe the day with appro-
priate awareness and educational activities.

Children’s 
Fund 
(commonly 
known 
as 
‘‘UNICEF’’) has worked tirelessly to support 
the rights and well-being of every child, in 
partnership with the United States; 
Whereas UNICEF was established in De-
cember 1946 to provide relief for children and 
adolescents in war-ravished countries and for 
child health purposes generally and to pro-
vide, without discrimination, assistance to 
vulnerable children around the world; 
Whereas, in 1965, the Nobel Prize was 
awarded to UNICEF for the ‘‘promotion of 
brotherhood among nations’’; 
Whereas UNICEF has been and remains a 
formidable and stalwart advocate for chil-
dren around the world; 
Whereas UNICEF operates in more than 190 
countries and territories to save the lives, to 
defend the rights, and fulfill the potential of 
children from early childhood through ado-
lescence; 
Whereas UNICEF partners with United 
States service organizations, including with 
Rotary International to eradicate polio, 
Kiwanis International to fight maternal and 
neonatal tetanus and iodine deficiency dis-
orders, the American Red Cross to decrease 
the incidence of childhood measles, Lions

Whereas, since 1990, continuing efforts by

Whereas UNICEF provides critical water,

Whereas UNICEF trains social service

117 countries; 
Whereas UNICEF helps provide education 
to millions of children and works to ensure 
that every child has access to education and 
the opportunity to develop the skills needed 
for life and work; 
Whereas UNICEF plays a key role in the 
global response by the United Nations to the 
COVID–19 pandemic and in the global vac-
cine distribution plan; 
Whereas, beyond the COVID–19 pandemic, 
UNICEF responds to new and ongoing hu-
manitarian situations in 152 countries; 
Whereas UNICEF remains a trusted and re-
liable source for the secure delivery of vac-
cines and medicines around the world, par-
ticularly for vulnerable populations; 
Whereas UNICEF provides personal protec-
tive equipment and facilitates training on 
infection prevention and control for millions 
of health workers; and 
Whereas UNICEF, through its work on the 
front lines of the COVID–19 pandemic, seeks 
not only to facilitate recovery from the 
COVID–19 crisis, but also to reimagine the 
future for every child by implementing solu-
tions to respond effectively to the COVID–19 
pandemic and strengthening systems to bet-
ter respond to future crises: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

At the end of title VII, add the following: 
Subtitle D—Access to Contraception 
SEC. 761. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Access 
to Contraception for Servicemembers and 
Dependents Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 762. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Women are serving in the Armed Forces 
at increasing rates, playing a critical role in 
the national security of the United States. 
Women comprise more than 18 percent of 
members of the Armed Forces, and as of fis-
cal year 2019, more than 390,000 women serve 
on active duty in the Armed Forces or in the 
reserve components. An estimated several 
thousand transgender men also serve on ac-
tive duty in the Armed Forces and in the re-
serve components, in addition to non-binary 
members and those who identify with a dif-
ferent gender. 
(2) Ninety-five percent of women serving in 
the Armed Forces are of reproductive age 
and as of 2019, more than 700,000 female 
spouses and dependents of members of the 
Armed Forces on active duty are of repro-
ductive age. 
(3) The TRICARE program covered more 
than 1,570,000 women of reproductive age in 
2019, including spouses and dependents of 
members of the Armed Forces on active 
duty. Additionally, thousands of transgender 
dependents of members of the Armed Forces 
are covered by the TRICARE program. 
(4) The right to access contraception is 
grounded in the principle that contraception 
and the ability to determine if and when to 
have children are inextricably tied to one’s 
wellbeing, equality, and ability to determine 
the course of one’s life. These protections 
have helped access to contraception become 
a driving force in improving the health and 
financial security of individuals and their 
families. 
(5) Access to contraception is critical to 
the health of every individual capable of be-
coming pregnant. This subtitle is intended to 
apply to all individuals with the capacity for 
pregnancy, 
including 
cisgender 
women, 
transgender men, non-binary individuals, 
those who identify with a different gender, 
and others. 
(6) Studies have shown that when cost bar-
riers to the full range of methods of contra-
ception are eliminated, patients are more 
likely to use the contraceptive method that 
meets their needs, and therefore use contra-
ception correctly and more consistently, re-
ducing the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
(7) Under the TRICARE program, members 
of the Armed Forces on active duty have full 
coverage of all prescription drugs, including 
contraception, without cost-sharing require-
ments, in line with the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148), 
which requires coverage of all contraceptive 
methods approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration for women and related services 
and education and counseling. However, 
members not on active duty and dependents 
of members do not have similar coverage of 
all methods of contraception approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration without cost- 
sharing when they obtain the contraceptive 
outside of a military medical treatment fa-
cility. 
(8) In order to fill gaps in coverage and ac-
cess to preventive care critical for women’s

November 18, 2021 
health, the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (Public Law 111–148) requires 
all non-grandfathered individual and group 
health plans to cover without cost-sharing 
preventive services, including a set of evi-
dence-based preventive services for women 
supported by the Health Resources and Serv-
ices Administration of the Department of 
Health and Human Services. These women’s 
preventive services include the full range of 
female-controlled contraceptive methods, ef-
fective family planning practices, and steri-
lization procedures, approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration. The Health Re-
sources and Services Administration has af-
firmed that contraceptive care includes con-
traceptive counseling, initiation of contra-
ceptive use, and follow-up care (such as man-
agement, evaluation, and changes to and re-
moval or discontinuation of the contracep-
tive method). 
(9) The Defense Advisory Committee on 
Women in the Services has recommended 
that all the Armed Forces, to the extent that 
they have not already, implement initiatives 
that inform members of the Armed Forces of 
the importance of family planning, educate 
them on methods of contraception, and make 
various methods of contraception available, 
based on the finding that family planning 
can increase the overall readiness and qual-
ity of life of all members of the Armed 
Forces. 
(10) The military departments received 
more than 7,800 reports of sexual assaults in-
volving members of the Armed Forces as vic-
tims or subjects during fiscal year 2019. 
Through regulations, the Department of De-
fense already supports a policy of ensuring 
that members of the Armed Forces who are 
sexually assaulted have access to emergency 
contraception, and the initiation of contra-
ception if desired and medically appropriate.

sections (a), (b), and (c), cost-sharing re-
quirements may not be imposed and cost-

SEC. 744. GRANT PROGRAM FOR INCREASED CO-
OPERATION 
ON 
POST-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS DISORDER RESEARCH BE-
TWEEN UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL. 
(a) FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(A) The Department of Veterans Affairs re-
ports that between 11 and 20 percent of vet-
erans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom 
and Operation Enduring Freedom have post- 
traumatic stress disorder (in this paragraph 
referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’) in a given year. In 
addition, that figure amounts to about 12 
percent of Gulf War veterans and up to 30 
percent of Vietnam veterans. 
(B) The Department of Veterans Affairs re-
ports that among women veterans of the 
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 20 
percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. 
(C) It is thought that 70 percent of individ-
uals in the United States have experienced 
at least one traumatic event in their life-
time, and approximately 20 percent of those 
individuals have struggled or continue to 
struggle with symptoms of PTSD. 
(D) Studies show that PTSD has links to 
homelessness and substance abuse in the 
United States. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs estimates that approximately 11 per-
cent of the homeless population are veterans 
and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services 
Administration 
estimates 
that 
about seven percent of veterans have a sub-
stance abuse disorder. 
(E) Our ally Israel, under constant attack 
from terrorist groups, experiences similar 
issues with Israeli veterans facing symptoms 
of PTSD. The National Center for Traumatic 
Stress and Resilience at Tel Aviv University 
found that five to eight percent of combat 
soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and 
during wartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 
percent. 
(F) Current treatment options in the 
United States focus on cognitive therapy, ex-
posure therapy, or eye movement desen-
sitization and reprocessing, but the United 
States must continue to look for more effec-
tive treatments. Several leading hospitals, 
academic institutions, and nonprofit organi-
zations in Israel dedicate research and serv-
ices to treating PTSD. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Defense, act-
ing through the Psychological Health and 
Traumatic Brain Injury Research Program, 
should seek to explore scientific collabora-
tion between academic institutions and non-
profit research entities in the United States 
and institutions in Israel with expertise in 
researching, diagnosing, and treating post- 
traumatic stress disorder. 
(b) GRANT PROGRAM.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense, 
in coordination with the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs and the Secretary of State, 
shall award grants to eligible entities to 
carry out collaborative research between the 
United States and Israel with respect to 
post-traumatic stress disorders. 
(2) AGREEMENT.—The Secretary of Defense 
shall carry out the grant program under this 
section in accordance with the Agreement on 
the United States-Israel binational science 
foundation with exchange of letters, signed 
at New York September 27, 1972, and entered 
into force on September 27, 1972. 
(c) ELIGIBLE ENTITIES.—To be eligible to 
receive a grant under this section, an entity 
shall be an academic institution or a non-
profit entity located in the United States. 
(d) AWARD.—The Secretary shall award 
grants under this section to eligible entities 
that— 
(1) carry out a research project that— 
(A) addresses a requirement in the area of 
post-traumatic stress disorders that the Sec-
retary determines appropriate to research 
using such grant; and 
(B) is conducted by the eligible entity and 
an entity in Israel under a joint research 
agreement; and 
(2) meet such other criteria that the Sec-
retary may establish. 
(e) APPLICATION.—To be eligible to receive 
a grant under this section, an eligible entity 
shall submit an application to the Secretary 
at such time, in such manner, and con-
taining such commitments and information 
as the Secretary may require. 
(f) REPORTS.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date on which an eligible entity com-
pletes a research project using a grant under 
this section, the Secretary shall submit to 
Congress a report that contains— 
(1) a description of how the eligible entity 
used the grant; and 
(2) an evaluation of the level of success of 
the research project. 
(g) TERMINATION.—The authority to award 
grants under this section shall terminate on 
the date that is seven years after the date on 
which the first such grant is awarded.

(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(A) Clause 12 of section 8 of article I of the 
Constitution of the United States empowers 
Congress with the responsibility to ‘‘raise 
and support Armies’’. 
(B) The United States first required mili-
tary conscription in the American Civil War 
under the Civil War Military Draft Act of 
1863. 
(C) The Selective Services Act of 1917 au-
thorized the President to draft additional 
forces beyond the volunteer force to support 
exceedingly high demand for additional 
forces when the U.S. entered the first World 
War. 
(D) The Selective Training and Service Act 
of 1940 was the first authorization by Con-
gress for conscription in peacetime but lim-
ited the President’s induction authority to 
‘‘no greater number of men than the Con-
gress shall hereafter make specific appro-
priation for from time to time’’. 
(E) Congress allowed induction authority 
to lapse in 1947. 
(F) Congress reinstated the President’s in-
duction authority under the Selective Serv-
ice Act of 1948 to raise troops for United 
States participation in the Korean War.

induction authority under the Selective 
Service Act of 1948 through the beginning of 
the Vietnam War. 
(H) Congress passed additional reforms to 
the draft under the Military Selective Serv-
ice Act of 1967 in response to issues arising 
from United States engagement in the Viet-
nam War. 
(I) Congress prohibited any further use of 
the draft after July 1, 1973. 
(J) If a president seeks to reactivate the 
use of the draft, Congress would have to 
enact a law providing authorization for this 
purpose 
(2) AMENDMENT.—Section 17 of the Military 
Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. 3815) is 
amended by adding at the end the following 
new subsection:

ing and service in the Armed Forces unless 
Congress first passes and there is enacted a 
law expressly authorizing such induction 
into service.’’. 
(h) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall take effect on the 
date of the enactment of this Act, except 
that the amendments made by subsections 
(d) and (g) shall take effect 1 year after such 
date of enactment.

coordination with the Secretary of Defense, 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Commerce, and the Secretary of Homeland

a 
report 
on 
geostrategic interests and national security 
implications related to trade in the Indo-Pa-
cific region. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The report required by sub-
section (a) shall include an assessment of the 
following: 
(1) How reductions in tariffs, revisions in 
government procurement rules, and other 
market access commitments by countries in 
the Indo-Pacific region could potentially af-
fect United States producers and supply 
chains deemed critical for national security 
purposes. 
(2) How agreements by those countries, in-
cluding with respect to strengthening invest-
ment and intellectual property rights, could 
potentially affect the development by the 
United States of critical new technologies. 
(3) How agreements by those countries re-
lating to digital trade could potentially af-
fect United States cybersecurity, including 
potential agreements entered into with the 
United States to promote cybersecurity and 
open data flows and to combat discrimina-
tory practices and government censorship. 
(4) How tariff and nontariff barriers im-
posed by those countries and trade agree-
ments by those countries could broadly af-
fect geostrategic United States interests, 
partnerships, and alliances. 
(5) Current and predicted foreign direct in-
vestment in the Indo-Pacific region by the 
People’s Republic of China. 
(6) How agreements by those countries 
could counter the semiconductor policies of 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, particularly those policies that could 
lead to the transfer of intellectual property, 
research and development, and manufac-
turing to the People’s Republic of China. 
(c) PUBLIC HEARING.—The Trade Represent-
ative and the officials specified in subsection 
(a) shall jointly conduct a public hearing and

strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes; which was ordered to 
lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
TITLE ll—EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 
SEC. l01. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Advancing 
Emergency 
Preparedness 
Through 
One 
Health Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. l02. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The term ‘‘One Health’’ reflects the 
interconnectedness of human health, animal 
health, and the environment. As technology 
and population growth facilitates increased 
interaction of human settlements with wild-
life habitats and as international travel and 
trade increases, the interface between these 
elements will also continue to rise. 
(2) When zoonotic diseases spill over to hu-
mans, there are often enormous health and 
economic costs. The World Bank estimates 
that, between 1997 and 2009, the global costs 
from 
six 
zoonotic 
outbreaks 
exceeded 
$80,000,000,000 and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimates that there 
are annually 2,500,000,000 cases of zoonotic 
infections globally, resulting in 2,700,000 
deaths. 
(3) There are also immense effects on the 
agriculture sector. In 2014 and 2015, a high 
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak 
in the United States led to the cull of nearly 
50,000,000 birds, and imposed up to approxi-
mately $3,300,000,000 in losses for poultry and 
egg farmers, animal feed producers, baked 
good production, and other related indus-
tries. 
(4) Public health preparedness depends on 
agriculture in a variety of ways. For exam-
ple, a wide range of vaccines, including those 
for influenza, yellow fever, rabies, and mea-
sles-mumps-rubella (MMR), are primarily 
cultivated in poultry eggs. Egg shortages re-
sulting from zoonotic disease outbreaks 
could impose serious risks to vaccine manu-
facturing efforts. 
(5) It is estimated that approximately 80 
percent of potential pathogens likely to be 
used in bioterrorism or biowarfare are com-
mon zoonotic pathogens. 
(6) While existing Federal Government ini-
tiatives related to One Health span multiple 
agencies, including the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention One Health office 
and the Department of Agriculture Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Services’ One 
Health 
Coordination 
Center, 
additional 
interagency coordination is necessary to 
help better prevent, prepare for, and respond 
to zoonotic disease outbreaks. 
SEC. l03. INTERAGENCY ONE HEALTH PRO-
GRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the In-
terior, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, and the Secretary of Agriculture 
(referred to in this title as the ‘‘Secre-
taries’’), in coordination with the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment, the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy, the Department of Homeland Security, 
the Department of Defense, the Department 
of Commerce, and other departments and 
agencies as appropriate, shall develop, pub-
lish, and submit to Congress a national One 
Health Framework (referred to in this title 
as the ‘‘framework’’) for coordinated Federal 
Activities under the One Health Program. 
(b) NATIONAL ONE HEALTH FRAMEWORK.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secre-
taries, in cooperation with the United States 
Agency for International Development, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the De-
partment of Homeland Security, the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of Com-
merce, and other departments and agencies 
as appropriate, shall develop, publish, and 
submit to Congress a One Health Framework 
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘frame-
work’’) for coordinated Federal activities 
under the One Health Program. 
(2) CONTENTS OF FRAMEWORK.—The frame-
work described in paragraph (1) shall de-
scribe existing efforts and contain rec-
ommendations for building upon and comple-
menting the activities of the Department of 
the Interior, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Preparedness and Response, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, the United States 
Agency for International Development, the

tional Institutes of Health, the Department 
of Homeland Security, and other depart-
ments and agencies, as appropriate, and 
shall— 
(A) assess, identify, and describe, as appro-
priate, existing activities of Federal agencies 
and departments under the One Health Pro-
gram and consider whether all relevant agen-
cies are adequately represented; 
(B) for the 10-year period beginning in the 
year the framework is submitted, establish 
specific Federal goals and priorities that 
most effectively advance— 
(i) scientific understanding of the connec-
tions between human, animal, and environ-
mental health; 
(ii) coordination and collaboration between 
agencies involved in the framework includ-
ing sharing data and information, engaging 
in joint fieldwork, and engaging in joint lab-

governmental organizations, and private en-
tities in order to develop new approaches for 
reducing hazards to human and animal 
health and to strengthen understanding of 
the value of an integrated approach under 
the One Health Program to addressing public 
health threats in a manner that prevents du-
plication; 
(E) identify best practices related to State 
and local-level research coordination, field 
activities, and disease outbreak prepared-
ness, response, and recovery related to One 
Health; and 
(F) provide recommendations to Congress 
regarding additional action or legislation 
that may be required to assist in estab-
lishing the One Health Program. 
(3) ADDENDUM.—Not later than 3 years 
after the creation of the framework, the Sec-
retaries, in coordination with the agencies 
described in paragraph (1), shall submit to 
Congress an addendum to the framework 
that describes the progress made in advanc-
ing the activities described in the frame-
work. 
(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—To 
carry out this section, there is authorized to 
be appropriated such sums as may be nec-
essary. 
SEC. l04. GAO REPORT.

SA 4807. Ms. SMITH (for herself, Mr. 
CASSIDY, and Ms. WARREN) submitted 
an amendment intended to be proposed 
to amendment SA 3867 submitted by 
Mr. REED and intended to be proposed 
to the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize ap-

lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1216. STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN AF-
GHANISTAN. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Since May 2021, the escalation of vio-
lent conflict in Afghanistan has forcibly dis-
placed an estimated 655,000 civilians, and 80 
percent of those forced to flee are women and 
children. 
(2) Since regaining control of Afghanistan 
in August 2021, the Taliban have taken ac-
tions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the 
late 1990s, including by cracking down on 
protesters, detaining and beating journalists, 
reestablishing the Ministry for the Pro-
motion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and 
requiring women to study at universities in 
gender-segregated classrooms while wearing 
Islamic attire. 
(3) Until the Taliban assumed control of 
the country in August 2021, the women and 
girls of Afghanistan had achieved much since 
2001, even as insecurity, poverty, under-
development, and patriarchal norms contin-
ued to limit their rights and opportunities in 
much of Afghanistan. 
(4) Through strong support from the United 
States and the international community— 
(A) female enrollment in public schools in 
Afghanistan continued to increase through 
2015, with an estimated high of 50 percent of 
school age girls attending; and 
(B) by 2019— 
(i) women held political leadership posi-
tions, and women served as ambassadors; and 
(ii) women served as professors, judges, 
prosecutors, defense attorneys, police, mili-
tary members, health professionals, journal-
ists, humanitarian and developmental aid 
workers, and entrepreneurs. 
(5) Efforts to empower women and girls in 
Afghanistan continue to serve the national 
interests of Afghanistan and the United 
States because women are sources of peace 
and economic progress. 
(6) With the return of Taliban control, the 
United States has little ability to preserve 
the human rights of women and girls in Af-
ghanistan, and those women and girls may 
again 
face 
the 
intimidation 
and 
marginalization they faced under the last 
Taliban regime. 
(7) Women and girls in Afghanistan are 
again facing gender-based violence, includ-
ing— 
(A) forced marriage; 
(B) intimate partner and domestic vio-
lence; 
(C) sexual harassment; 
(D) sexual violence, including rape; and 
(E) emotional and psychological violence. 
(8) Gender-based violence has always been 
a significant problem in Afghanistan and is 
expected to become more widespread with 
the Taliban in control. In 2020, even before 
the Taliban assumed control of the country, 
some studies projected that 87 percent of Af-
ghan women and girls will experience at 
least one form of gender-based violence in 
their lifetime, with 62 percent experiencing 
multiple incidents of such violence. 
(9) Prior to the Taliban takeover in August 
2021, approximately 7,000,000 people in Af-
ghanistan lacked or had limited access to 
emergency and primary health services as a 
result of inadequate public health coverage, 
weak health systems, and conflict-related 
interruptions in care. 
(10) Women and girls faced additional chal-
lenges, as their access to prenatal, child-
birth, and postpartum care was limited due 
to a shortage of female medical staff, cul-
tural barriers, stigma and fears of reprisals 
following sexual violence, or other barriers 
to mobility, including security fears. 
(11) Only approximately 50 percent of preg-
nant women and girls in Afghanistan deliver 
their children in a health facility with a pro-
fessional attendant, which increases the risk 
of complications in childbirth and prevent-
able maternal mortality. 
(12) Food insecurity in Afghanistan is also 
posing a variety of threats to women and 
girls, as malnutrition weakens their immune 
systems and makes them more susceptible to 
infections, complications during pregnancy, 
and risks during childbirth. 
(13) With the combined impacts of ongoing 
conflict and COVID–19, Afghan households 
increasingly resort to child marriage, forced 
marriage, and child labor to address food in-
security and other effects of extreme pov-
erty. 
(14) In Afghanistan, the high prevalence of 
anemia among adolescent girls reduces their 
ability to survive childbirth, especially when 
coupled with high rates of child marriage 
and forced marriage and barriers to access-
ing prenatal and childbirth services. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) since 2001, organizations and networks 
promoting the empowerment of women and 
girls have been important engines of social, 
economic, and political development in Af-
ghanistan; 
(2) any future political order in Afghani-
stan should secure the political, economic, 
and social gains made by Afghan women and 
work to increase the equal treatment of 
women and girls; 
(3) respecting the internationally recog-
nized human rights of all people is essential 
to securing lasting peace and sustainable de-
velopment in Afghanistan; 
(4) in cooperation with international part-
ners, the United States must endeavor to 
preserve the hard-won gains made in Afghan-
istan during the past two decades, particu-
larly as related to the social, economic and 
political empowerment of women and girls in 
society; 
(5) the continued provision of humani-
tarian assistance in Afghanistan should be 
targeted toward the most vulnerable, includ-
ing for the protection, education, and well- 
being of women and girls; 
(6) immediate and ongoing humanitarian 
needs in Afghanistan can only be met by a 
humanitarian response that includes formal 
agreements between local nongovernmental 
organizations and international partners 
that promotes the safe access and participa-
tion of female staff at all levels and across 
functional roles among all humanitarian ac-
tors; and 
(7) a lack of aid would exacerbate the cur-
rent humanitarian crisis and harm the well- 
being of women and girls in Afghanistan. 
(c) POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REGARD-
ING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS OF AF-
GHANISTAN.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—It is the policy of the 
United States— 
(A) to continue to support the internation-
ally recognized human rights of women and 
girls in Afghanistan following the with-
drawal of the United States Armed Forces 
from Afghanistan, including through mecha-
nisms to hold all parties publicly account-
able for violations of international humani-
tarian law and violations of such rights 
against women and girls; 
(B) to strongly oppose any weakening of 
the political or economic rights of women 
and girls in Afghanistan; 
(C) to use the voice and influence of the 
United States at the United Nations to pro-
mote, respect, and uphold the internation-
ally recognized human rights of the women 
and girls of Afghanistan, including the right 
to safely work; 
(D) to identify individuals who violate the 
internationally recognized human rights of 
women and girls in Afghanistan, such as by 
committing acts of murder, lynching, and 
grievous domestic violence against women, 
and to press for bringing those individuals to 
justice; and 
(E) to systematically consult with Afghan 
women and girls on their needs and priorities 
in the development, implementation, and 
monitoring of humanitarian action, includ-
ing women and girls who are part of the Af-
ghan diaspora community. 
(d) HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND AFGHAN 
WOMEN.—The Administrator of the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment should work to ensure that Afghan 
women are employed and enabled to work in 
the delivery of humanitarian assistance in 
Afghanistan, to the extent practicable. 
(e) REPORT
ON WOMEN
AND GIRLS
IN AF-
GHANISTAN.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and every 180 days thereafter through 2024, 
the Secretary of State shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress, and 
make available to the public, a report that 
includes the following: 
(A) An assessment of the status of women 
and girls in Afghanistan following the depar-
ture of United States and partner military 
forces, including with respect to access to

the Internal Revenue Service shall not be 
permitted to create or implement any new

mitted by Mr. REED and intended to be 
proposed to the bill H.R. 4350, to au-
thorize appropriations for fiscal year 
2022 for military activities of the De-

FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Thrift Savings Fund invests more 
than $700,000,000,000 on behalf of plan partici-
pants. As the guardian of the retirement 
funds of approximately 6,000,000 Federal ci-
vilian and military plan participants, it is 
critical that sums in the Thrift Savings 
Fund are not invested in securities linked to 
the economy of the People’s Republic of 
China. 
(2) Companies headquartered in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China have repeatedly com-
mitted corporate espionage, violated sanc-
tions imposed by the United States, flouted 
international 
property 
laws, 
committed 
theft, and failed to comply with audit and 
regulatory standards designed to safeguard 
investors. 
(3) The Thrift Savings Plan is known for 
its low management fees and comprehensive 
array of investment strategies. The provi-
sions of this section, and the amendments 
made by this section, will not increase fees 
imposed on participants of the Thrift Sav-
ings Plan. 
(4) The November 2017 selection of the 
MSCI ACWI Index by the Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board, initially scheduled 
to be effective in 2020, would violate the 
terms of subsection (i) of section 8438 of title 
5, United States Code, as added by subsection 
(b)(1) of this section. 
(b) PROHIBITION ON ANY TSP FUND INVEST-
ING IN ENTITIES BASED IN THE PEOPLE’S RE-
PUBLIC OF CHINA.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Section 8438 of title 5, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(i) Notwithstanding any other provision 
of this section, no fund established or over-
seen by the Board may include an invest-
ment in any security of— 
‘‘(1) an entity based in the People’s Repub-
lic of China; or 
‘‘(2) any subsidiary that is owned or oper-
ated by an entity described in paragraph 
(1).’’. 
(2) DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS.—Not later than 
30 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Federal Retirement Thrift Invest-
ment Board established under section 8472(a) 
of title 5, United States Code, shall— 
(A) review whether any sums in the Thrift 
Savings Fund are invested in violation of 
subsection (i) of section 8438 of that title, as 
added by paragraph (1) of this subsection; 
(B) if any sums are invested in the manner 
described in subparagraph (A), divest those 
sums in a manner that is consistent with the 
legal and fiduciary duties provided under 
chapter 84 of that title, or any other applica-
ble provision of law; and 
(C) reinvest any sums divested under sub-
paragraph (B) in investments that do not 
violate subsection (i) of section 8438 of that 
title, as added by paragraph (1) of this sub-
section. 
(c) PROHIBITION
ON
INVESTMENT
OF
TSP 
FUNDS
IN ENTITIES BASED
IN
THE PEOPLE’S 
REPUBLIC OF CHINA THROUGH THE TSP MU-
TUAL

HONORING 
THE 
WORK 
OF 
THE 
VALLEY 
SYRIA 
RELIEF 
COM-
MITTEE 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
appreciation of the efforts of my constituents 
to educate their fellow Americans about the 
human consequences of more than a decade 
of horrendous armed conflict in Syria and to 
provide support to the Syrian people. 
The crisis in Syria has faded from the head-
lines here in the U.S. But my constituents un-
derstand that democracy and justice, at home 
and abroad, depend on the commitment and 
participation of engaged American citizens. 
They have not given up, and neither must we. 
Their efforts are well described in a column 
by Sara Weinberger of the Valley Syria Relief 
Committee, published on November 15 in the 
Daily Hampshirite Gazette, and which I would 
like to include in the RECORD. 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN SYRIA HITS HOME 
(By Sara Weinberger) 
‘‘It was 11:15 a.m. on Sept. 30th. I was one 
of six heads on the Zoom screen. Michael 
Kane, Micky McKinley, Debbie Shriver and I 
stared in silence. The four of us comprised 
The Valley Syrian Relief Committee. 
‘‘Sharing the screen were two of Congress-
man Jim McGovern’s staff. We had requested 
the meeting to give the congressman an up-
date on the war in Syria, now in its 11th 
year, and to ask that he raise his voice in 
Congress to save Syrian lives. 
‘‘What we didn’t know was that McGovern 
had spent the morning trying to pass a stop-
gap bill on the last day of the fiscal year to 
prevent a government shutdown. Not a great 
day for our meeting, I thought, imagining a 
preoccupied McGovern politely listening to 
our presentation, while his mind was else-
where. Apologizing for his late arrival, he 
left his morning crisis at the door, and for 
the next hour listened intently, asked ques-
tions, and showed us that the purpose of our 
visit genuinely mattered. 
‘‘In 2011, Syrians, inspired by our demo-
cratic form of government, demonstrated in 
defiance of the authoritarian regime of Syr-
ia’s brutal dictator, Bashar Al Assad. They 
have been paying for it ever since with their 
lives and their livelihoods, with a whole gen-
eration of traumatized children who have 
lost loved ones, ran for refuge from barrel 
bombs, and tried to hold unto hope in a place 
that many have deemed a hell on earth. Yet, 
with our own country’s democracy in peril, 
garnering interest in longstanding wars on 
the other side of the world can be a chal-
lenge. 
‘‘This was not the case in our own commu-
nity, where several hundred of McGovern’s 
constituents have faithfully demonstrated 
their commitment and concern for the wel-
fare of Syrians since 2014. In September 2015, 
they filled the sanctuary of First Churches 
for our first big event, ‘‘Songs for Syria’’ to 
raise funds for the Syrian American Medical 
Society. We reminded McGovern of the hun-
dreds who accepted our invitations to edu-
cate members of his district’s interfaith or-
ganizations, who broke bread with us, shared 
soup, and bought copies of ‘‘The Soup for 
Syria’’ cookbook, produced by local pub-
lisher Michel Moushabeck. 
‘‘Folks from Franklin and Hampshire 
counties shipped a container filled with ev-
erything from diapers, to winter clothing, to 
shoes and boots to enable refugees and dis-
placed people living in tents to survive the 
long Syrian winter. Actions led to more ac-
tions: groups gathered to write personal let-
ters of hope to assure Syrian children and 
their families that they are not alone. 
‘‘Rebecca Leopold’s students at Amherst 
Regional High School formed the Refugees in 
Distress Club, developing a curriculum to 
educate younger students about the situa-
tion in Syria. With the help of our partners 
at the Washington, D.C.-based Syrian Emer-
gency Task Force, Mazen Al-Hamuda, spent 
a day at ARHS openly shared his traumatic 
story of the physical and emotional scars of 
brutal torture he endured in a Syrian prison. 
‘‘The above stories only scratch the sur-
face of the many actions the residents of 
Congressional District 2 engaged in on behalf 
of the Syrian people. Their efforts allowed 
the Valley Syrian Relief Committee to raise 
more than $200,000 for humanitarian assist-
ance and bring internationally known ex-
perts to inform and engage people in efforts 
to make sure the people of Syria are not for-
gotten. 
‘‘Pivoting to Zoom in 2020, our supporters 
generously donated funds to purchase two 
school buses to serve as an evacuation vehi-
cle when the bombs start falling, an ambu-
lance to get medical help for injured chil-
dren, and of course, to transport the young 
children to their beloved Wisdom House 
School. 
‘‘There was heartbreak too. The news of 
Mazen Al Hamouda’s disappearance in Syria 
broke all of our hearts, especially those of 
the students who fell in love with the lanky 
man with dark shadows under his eyes. 
Mazen’s legacy will live on with some of 
these students, who went on to college to 
major in human rights and international re-
lations. 
They 
will 
be 
the 
future 
peacebuilders, replacing dictatorships with 
civil societies in Syria and beyond. 
‘‘McGovern has been an ally for the Syrian 
people. He has organized programs for his 
congressional colleagues and others through 
the Lantos Human Rights Commission, to 
showcase Syrian heroes such as Caesar, who 
smuggled thousands of photographs of bru-
talized bodies of imprisoned Syrians, to ex-
pose to the world the war crimes of the 
Assad regime. We were moved by the genuine 
feelings expressed at the end of our meeting, 
when McGovern reminding his colleagues in 
Congress that they must recommit to bring-
ing about an end to the carnage. 
‘‘Our own country is on a precipice, with 
democracy hanging by a thread. Recently, I 
have become aware that what has happened 
in Syria could one day envelop our own 
country. Fascism is rearing its ugly head on 
every continent. Aligning ourselves to sup-
port those who are suffering can grow an 
international movement for human rights. It 
begins in communities like those in western 
Massachusetts, with those who actively up-
hold the humanity of our brothers and sis-
ters, no matter where they live.’’ 
RECOGNIZING MIKE EPPS, COME-
DIAN, PRODUCER, AND ACTOR 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize Mike Epps, who will be filming his 
next Netflix comedy special in his hometown 
of Indianapolis and will also be inducted into 
the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of 
Fame on November 20, 2021. 
Mike was born in Indianapolis to parents 
Mary Reed and Tommie Epps, and raised in 
our great city. Mike began performing comedy 
as a teenager. After achieving success in 
standup comedy, he moved to Atlanta, Geor-
gia, to pursue a career in comedy at the Com-
edy Act Theater. 
At 21 years old, Mike moved to New York 
City where he became a sensation in the un-
derground Black comedy scene. Mike’s career 
continued to prosper, performing in two HBO 
Def Comedy Jam broadcasts and appearing in 
the movie ‘‘Strays’’ in 1997 and the television 
series ‘‘The Sopranos’’ in 1999. 
After New York, Mike’s rise to fame took 
him to Los Angeles, where he landed a role in 
Ice Cube’s movie ‘‘Next Friday.’’ His acting ca-
reer gained momentum, appearing in films 
such as ‘‘Dr. Dolittle 2 ,’’ ‘‘All About the Ben-
jamins’’ and ‘‘The Fighting Temptations,’’ to 
name just a few. 
Mike has used his platform to support our 
city and give back to others. In 2012, he 
served as the ‘‘Super Bowl Ambassador’’ to 
Indianapolis. In addition, his generous con-
tributions to the Tupac Amaru Shakur Founda-
tion for the Arts in Georgia has helped provide 
opportunities for young people wishing to fol-
low in his footsteps. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Mike Epps. Our community is proud 
of his success and deeply grateful for his dedi-
cated philanthropic and mentorship efforts, 
which are making a positive impact in the lives 
of countless young people across the country.

HONORING DR. DIETER MARTIN 
GRUEN’S 99TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SEAN CASTEN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Dr. Dieter Martin Gruen’s 99th 
birthday, honor his service and contributions to 
the scientific community, and record my con-
tinued support for his nomination for the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom. 
For nearly eight decades, Dr. Gruen has 
worked to enhance American technology de-
velopment as a former Manhattan Project Sci-
entist and Argonne National Laboratory Distin-
guished Fellow. Born in 1922, Dr. Gruen is an

November 18, 2021 
internationally 
esteemed 
German-American 
chemist, inventor, and innovator who immi-
grated to the U.S. from Nazi Germany in 
1936. Throughout his career, Dr. Gruen has 
been driven by his curiosity and commitment 
to science—allowing him to make critical con-
tributions to nuclear fission and fusion, solar 
energy, energy storage, and conservation. 
Specifically, Dr. Gruen has made several key 
technological advancements such as the nu-
clear submarine reactor cooling design and 
purification of uranium used to end World War 
II in the Pacific theater. 
Through this work and countless other self-
less endeavors, Dr. Gruen has been recog-
nized by the international scientific community 
with numerous awards—including from Ar-
gonne National Laboratory, Northwestern Uni-
versity, and the Patent Law Association of 
Chicago—for his pioneering research in chem-
istry, physics, along with the emerging fields of 
materials and nanoscience. Dr. Gruen has 
been granted over 60 U.S. patents for his 
work in alternative energy and discoveries in 
interdisciplinary subjects. His lifelong contribu-
tion to science and alternative energy tech-
nology is exemplary and his work continues 
through today. Dr. Gruen’s tireless efforts to 
solve future clean energy challenges pre-
sented by climate change is seldom exhibited 
by an individual. Humble and unpretentious, 
Dr. Gruen has and remains the embodiment of 
a dedicated American and pure scientist. 
Dr. Gruen’s story is the story of many immi-
grant Americans: those who left behind places 
of persecution, discrimination, and lack of op-
portunity for a brighter future. Those who ar-
rived on our shores and helped build our na-
tion through their hard-work, courageous spirit, 
unyielding dedication, and personal sacrifice. 
His courage and tenacity is an inspiration for 
us all. 
Through the years, I have had the great 
pleasure of sitting down with Dr. Gruen, and 
learned from his countless stories about his 
work on the Manhattan Project, the nuts and 
bolts of nuclear fission technology, and his 
unique journey to the United States. At 99, Dr. 
Gruen still sees the world as a place of vast 
opportunities for technological innovation, a 
quality that I know encourages my own opti-
mism to tackle issues facing our society. 
For the reasons mentioned here and many 
more, I sincerely believe that Dr. Dieter Gruen 
should be awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom for his lifelong contributions to 
science and technology that continue today. 
Dr. Gruen’s tireless efforts to solve future en-
ergy challenges is seldom exhibited by an in-
dividual. Humble and unpretentious, Dr. Gruen 
has and remains the embodiment of a dedi-
cated American and pure scientist. 
In April 2021, my colleagues Representa-
tives BILL
FOSTER, FRENCH
HILL, JERRY 
MCNERNEY, and CHERI BUSTOS joined me in 
supporting Dr. Gruen’s nomination for the 
highest civilian award in this country. Dr. 
Gruen has dedicated his life to science and 
made monumental contributions to shaping 
the United States as a leader and world power 
in technology, innovation, and national de-
fense. 
Congratulations to Dr. Gruen for his dec-
ades of accomplishments and exceptional 
contributions to science and the national secu-
rity interests of the United States. I cannot 
think of a more deserving citizen for this 
award and today I wish him the happiest of 
birthdays. 
RECOGNIZING MONGOLIA 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, as a member 
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I rise 
to highlight the importance of the strategic re-
lationship between the United States and 
Mongolia. 
Though geographically surrounded by two 
countries, Russia to the north and China to 
the south, I am told that Mongolia recognizes 
the United States as its ‘‘third neighbor’’—a 
key partnership forged through diplomatic, 
military, cultural, and economic relationships 
that provide immense value to both nations. 
As the United States continually adapts, 
analyzes, and innovates to stay ahead of chal-
lenges from global competitors like China and 
Russia, maintaining and strengthening rela-
tionships with regional allies like Mongolia is 
critical. Since establishing formal diplomatic 
relations in 1987, and the country’s peaceful 
democratic revolution in 1990, the United 
States and Mongolia have partnered to ex-
pand political and financial cooperation and to 
advance market-based reforms to stabilize 
and grow economic opportunities for Mongo-
lian citizens. 
The U.S. State Department’s 2021 Invest-
ment Climate Statement on Mongolia high-
lighted the importance of direct foreign invest-
ment, especially from western companies and 
institutions, as pivotal for the growth and sta-
bility of the Mongolian economy. Mongolia is 
making efforts to bolster investor confidence 
by reiterating its commitment to implementing 
the 
U.S.-Mongolia 
Agreement 
on 
Trans-
parency in Matters Related to International 
Trade and Investment. This agreement pro-
vides greater regulatory certainty and trans-
parency for domestic and foreign investors by 
requiring a public-comment period before new 
regulations become final. 
The State Department’s report highlights 
areas of success where investments have out-
performed expectations, particularly in retail 
and service sectors of the economy. The re-
port also identifies sectors where greater cer-
tainty is needed to ensure continued economic 
growth, including the mining and natural re-
sources industries. 
To quote from the report: 
‘‘The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine has 
resurfaced as a bellwether of Mongolia’s in-
vestment climate. Upon reaching full pro-
duction, the mine may produce as much as 25 
percent of Mongolia’s GDP. Resolving an on-
going investment dispute related to the mine 
between the government and multi-national 
shareholders is seen by many investors as es-
sential to improving Mongolia’s investment 
climate image internationally.’’ (2021 Invest-
ment Climate Statements: Mongolia, 2021) 
A stable and robust Mongolian economy is 
central not only to the country’s democratic, 
cultural, and financial independence, but it is 
also a clear strategic asset to the United 
States. I commend the Mongolian government 
for the steps it has taken to welcome and 
incentivize investment into its economy and 
encourage the government to continue to 
make progress on the institutional and legal 
measures that are needed to secure existing 
capital and encourage further investments into 
local jobs, businesses, and economic opportu-
nities for the Mongolian people. On behalf of 
the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, I 
am honored to recognize the important rela-
tionship between the United States and Mon-
golia.

HONORING ANTIBIOTIC 
AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. A. DREW FERGUSON, IV 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Antibiotic Awareness Week 
as we work to combat a looming public health 
and national security crisis that may one day 
be our next pandemic if left unaddressed: anti-
microbial resistance (AMR). 
Applying the lessons learned from the 
COVID–19 pandemic by investing in pandemic 
preparedness now will save lives later. That is 
why I am spearheading bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation, the Pioneering Antimicrobial Sub-
scriptions to End Upsurging Resistance Act, 
also known as the PASTEUR Act. 
Through a partnership between the federal 
government and industry, this bill encourages 
innovative drug development to target the 
most threatening infections, improves the ap-
propriate use of antibiotics, and ensures do-
mestic availability when needed. 
Madam Speaker, as we tackle this next 
medical frontier, we must bring together the 
unique capabilities and resources of the public 
and private sectors to solve the market fail-
ures impeding the development of new lines of 
antibiotics. 
The PASTEUR Act accomplishes this, and 
I’m encouraged our legislation is included in a 
groundbreaking 
package 
introduced 
this 
week—Cures 2.0 that builds on the 21st Cen-
tury Cures Act of 2016—taking another impor-
tant step toward addressing antimicrobial re-
sistance.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF JAMES 
MERIMON PAINTER 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the legacy of James Merimon Painter, 
who passed away in Prospect Hill, North 
Carolina on October 23, 2021. 
James Painter spent his entire life advo-
cating for and serving the community he 
loved. From helping his parents on their farm 
during the Great Depression, to advising the 
Caswell Vocational Commission Services and 
the Caswell Civic Center Committees, Painter 
was one who truly put his community before 
himself. 
James took his knowledge of farming with 
him to the United States Navy where he was 
selected to lead a farming unit on the Mariana 
Island of Tinian to feed American Gls in the 
Pacific. While serving, he sustained serious in-
juries from sniper fire; and on a separate oc-
casion, his tractor ran over a land-mine. Fol-
lowing the incident, Mr. Painter jokingly said, 
‘‘that was a waste of a perfectly good tractor.’’

November 18, 2021 
After the war, James returned to his cattle 
farm and got married to his wife of 55 years— 
Ms. Josephine ‘‘Jo’’ Murchison. While pre-
dominantly raising beef cattle and grain, he 
served his community as the President of the 
Caswell County Farm Bureau, a position he 
proudly held for 17 years. Additionally, he was 
a member of the NC Farm Bureau Federation 
Board for 23 years. He won several different 
agriculture awards over the years—most nota-
bly being named ‘‘Cattleman of the Year’’ in 
1975—while his family received the Soil and 
Water Conservation Farm Family award of 
1979. 
In describing Mr. Painter’s life, Caswell 
County Farm Bureau colleague Lucas Bernard 
wrote that, ‘‘James Painter will be remem-
bered for his service to his community, 
Caswell County agriculture, and his nation. He 
has been an inspiration to me by seeing and 
hearing about his dedication to farming and 
agriculture locally, as well as overseas during 
WWII.’’ 
James Painter was preceded in death by his 
wife, Josephine, and is survived by his nieces 
and nephews. The Caswell County community 
has lost a great soul, advocate, and gen-
tleman with Mr. Painter’s passing. May he for-
ever rest in peace. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
James Merimon Painter for his service to his 
community and his sacrifice for this Nation.

RECOGNIZING THE ANNUAL 
COMMEMORATION OF HOLODOMOR 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the annual commemo-
ration of Holodomor, the Genocidal Famine in-
flicted upon the people of Ukraine by the So-
viet Union in 1932 and 1933. 
In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union engi-
neered a famine to ensure the Ukrainian peo-
ple could not resist Joseph Stalin’s totalitarian 
policies. This famine, known and remembered 
as Holodomor, led to the deaths of at least 3.9 
million people, or 13 percent of the population 
of Ukraine at the time. Some estimates of the 
number of those who died are much higher. 
‘‘Holodomor’’ is a combination of the Ukrainian 
words ‘‘hunger’’ and ‘‘to inflict death’’, a fitting 
name for the tragedy that occurred. 
While Soviet bureaucrats suppressed the 
facts of Holodomor at the time, including in-
structing Western journalists not to write about 
it, it is widely acknowledged as a genocide 
today. In fact, in 2018, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and U.S. Senate each unani-
mously passed resolutions citing previous dec-
larations of Holodomor as a genocide com-
mitted by Joseph Stalin and those around him. 
The vibrant Ukrainian-American community in 
Michigan’s Ninth District comes together each 
year in solemn commemoration of the millions 
of innocent lives taken and to ensure that this 
horrific event is never forgotten. 
As a member of the Ukrainian Caucus, I am 
honored to stand with Ukrainian-Americans in 
my district and throughout our country in wit-
ness of Holodomor. I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in reflection and remem-
brance and recommit ourselves to preventing 
genocide anywhere on Earth in the future. 
RECOGNIZING THOMAS J. GARI 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a notable resident within 
my district, Thomas J. Gari. Mr. Gari obtained 
a bachelor’s degree in Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Engineering from my alma mater, the 
Pennsylvania State University in 1970, and 
later went on to achieve a master’s degree in 
Business Administration from Villanova Univer-
sity in 1986. Following his education, Tom left 
his private sector career to join the Internal 
Revenue Service in 1999. In every stage of 
his career, Tom always worked to support and 
empower others, leveraging his extensive ex-
perience to identify complex case issues. find 
viable solutions, and produce consistent, qual-
ity results. In his final years at the IRS, Tom 
served as Engineering Team Manager, in 
which he managed all operational aspects ex-
ecuted by his team. Now, after more than 
twenty-two impressive years of dedicated gov-
ernment service and professional leadership, 
Tom is entering retirement. I am proud to rec-
ognize Thomas J. Gari as an exceptional man 
of character, guided by a sense to better his 
community and country. He has demonstrated 
an extraordinary ability to overcome complex 
challenges throughout the years as well as a 
steadfast dedication to supporting his col-
leagues. We are incredibly grateful for the 
positive impact that Tom has had on our com-
munity, and we wish him well in his retirement.

CONGRATULATING POLICE CHIEF 
MARION EUGENE SEALY, JR. 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful to recognize Police 
Chief Marion Eugene Sealy, Jr., of the City of 
Forest Acres for his 48 years of public service 
to his community. Chief Sealy will be retiring 
at the beginning of next year and South Caro-
lina will be losing a great public servant. 
Chief Sealy joined the Forest Acres Police 
Department in 1974 as a dispatcher. In 1975, 
he became a full-time patrol officer and shortly 
after was put in charge of the investigative di-
vision. Through his hard work and dedication, 
he became the Chief of Police of the Forest 
Acres Police Department in 1994. 
Throughout his career in public service, 
Chief Sealy led the department through many 
hardships including the tragic death of Officer 
Greg Alia. He has been so encouraging to his 
widow Kassy Alia Ray and their son Sal as 
Kassy has established Serve and Connect to 
improve neighborhoods challenged by poverty 
and crime. 
Through his leadership, he was able to suc-
cessfully relocate the police department during 
the devastating 2015 thousand-year flood to 
ensure the community of Forest Acres had ac-
cess to its police department. Working over-
night with his colleagues to set up operations, 
he dedicated himself to the safety of his offi-
cers and staff. He has set the standard of ex-
cellence in his community and I wish him the 
best of luck in his future endeavors .

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. JANIS 
SANTOS 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to extend my warmest 
congratulations to my good friend Janis 
Santos on her retirement following 40 years of 
dedicated public service to the children and 
families of western Massachusetts. 
A pioneer in the field of early education and 
childhood development, Janis most recently 
served as CEO of Holyoke Chicopee Spring-
field Head Start. Through her efforts to expand 
Head Start’s programs across the Common-
wealth, Janis has played a prominent role in 
improving the lives of more than 1,000 young 
children. Her diligence in directing the only mi-
grant, seasonal Head Start program in Massa-
chusetts only further demonstrates her excep-
tional commitment to helping the most vulner-
able families in our communities. 
In 1973, Janis began her lifelong advocacy 
and action on behalf of children and families 
by launching one of the first early-childhood 
centers in Ludlow, Massachusetts. Just six 
years later, in recognition of her cutting-edge 
approach to the field, Janis was taken on as 
Executive 
Director 
of

Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor the memory of my good friend 
and long-time colleague in this House cham-
ber, the gentleman from Kentucky, Larry Hop-
kins, who represented the people of central 
Kentucky for 14 years from 1979 to 1993. 
Congressman Hopkins served with great 
charisma and humor, befriending folks in 
every corner of Kentucky and across Capitol 
Hill. Public service was second nature to

Larry; he fought diligently for investments in 
our communities and worked hard to pave a 
brighter future for Kentucky. In fact, Larry won 
the Republican nomination for governor in 
1991 before Brereton Jones succeeded in the 
general election. Prior to his federal service, 
he was also elected to serve in both chambers 
of the Kentucky state legislature. 
As a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, he 
led the U.S. House Armed Services Com-
mittee with invaluable insight and expertise, 
leading the way for military modernization. He 
was a true patriot and champion for our U.S. 
Armed Forces on that committee. 
Larry and I were close friends before arriv-
ing on Capitol Hill, often traveling together, 
and sharing stories from home and abroad. 
He deeply loved the people of Kentucky and 
worked tirelessly to improve this great Com-
monwealth. I count it a great honor to have 
called him a friend, and I send my deepest 
condolences to the Hopkins family.

SUPPORTING 
H. 
RES. 
789, 
CEN-
SURING REP. PAUL GOSAR OF 
ARIZONA 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, yester-
day the House acted to discipline a Member 
for conduct that was unacceptable and in vio-
lation of all standards of decency and civility— 
conduct that brought disrepute to this institu-
tion. I joined 223 of my colleagues—Demo-
crats and Republicans—in passing H. Res. 
789 to officially censure Mr. PAUL GOSAR of 
Arizona and remove him from his assigned 
committees. 
Mr. GOSAR recently posted on social media 
an animated video depicting him graphically 
killing a female Member of Congress—Rep. 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ of New York— 
and violently attacking President Biden: Mil-
lions of people have seen this disturbing and 
violent video. Incredibly, Mr. GOSAR and 207 
House Republicans excused this despicable 
act as ‘‘free speech’’ and ‘‘symbolic.’’ Pro-
ducing and disseminating a video depicting 
the murder of a workplace colleague, of an 
elected federal official, and a fellow American 
is not symbolic—it is a threat that is intended 
to intimidate and inspire violence. 
Rep. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ is a val-
ued colleague who deserves to be treated with 
respect by all Members of Congress, even 
when political disagreements are significant. 
Mr. GOSAR’s use of official resources—paid for 
by American taxpayers—to depict the killing of 
a fellow Member of Congress is abhorrent, 
and it is conduct that was appropriately con-
demned by the House of Representatives. 
This is not a complicated matter. If Mr. 
GOSAR had shared such a video targeting a 
colleague in any other workplace in America, 
he would have been immediately terminated. 
While Democrats and two Republicans con-
demned his actions, the Republican leader 
and more than 200 Republican members con-
doned his actions, defended his conduct, and 
made light of a death threat against a Member 
of Congress. 
Have Republican Members of Congress be-
come so craven that they do not know right 
from wrong? Do my Republican colleagues 
not understand the signal this imagery sends 
to the American people, especially women and 
youth, that promoting violence—a male Mem-
ber of Congress brutally murdering a woman, 
a female Member of Congress—is acceptable 
political speech? This video is not political or 
free speech, it is violent misogyny. The fact 
that it has been publicly defended by 207 Re-
publican Members of Congress now makes 
such behavior part and parcel of the Repub-
lican playbook for how they intend to conduct 
themselves in the future. 
As we all know, on January 6, 2021, a mob 
of thousands of insurrectionists attacked the 
U.S. Capitol to prevent Congress from affirm-
ing the election of Joe Biden as President of 
the United States. Mr. GOSAR did not refrain 
from embracing these insurrectionists and the 
violence that threated the lives of Members of 
Congress, U.S. Capitol Police, and our con-
gressional staff and workforce. Now Mr. 
GOSAR is again embracing violence to send a 
political message and achieve his political 
goals. It is reprehensible, and this behavior is 
destroying our democracy. I take Mr. GOSAR’s 
threat seriously because this conduct inten-
tionally sends a signal to people who are more 
than willing to use violence to achieve political 
outcomes—as I experienced personally on 
January 6th. 
Mr. GOSAR’s behavior demanded censure 
by the U.S. House. Furthermore, I strongly en-
courage federal law enforcement officials to in-
vestigate this matter further to determine if his 
actions reach a standard of criminal conduct 
that merit prosecution. 
Every day I work as a Member of Congress 
in the U.S. House is an honor. Civility is not 
an option; it is a duty that is necessary if we 
are to govern and achieve our collective goals 
as Americans. Republicans and Democrats 
can disagree—strongly disagree—but we must 
always remember that we are all Americans, 
and the American people deserve our service 
and actions to be conducted with dignity and 
respect.

CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
CHURCH 
OF 
PHILADELPHIA 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate a great milestone for the 
Church of Philadelphia. On November 21st, 
the church will celebrate 40 years of ministry 
in Fort Worth. 
The Church of Philadelphia has been a pil-
lar of our North Texas community. This church 
celebrates the rich fabric of our community 
and welcomes people of all backgrounds to 
worship. Over the four decades since this 
church was founded by Pastor Gregory W. 
Spencer, the amount of growth that has oc-
curred has been incredible. The Church has 
used their prosperity to give back to our com-
munity by helping all of those in need. 
I want to take this opportunity to congratu-
late the Church of Philadelphia on their great 
work so far, and wish them best of luck for 
what is yet to come as they continue to serve 
communities across Fort Worth. 
HONORING JUDY L. ELLER 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Judy L. Eller of Peach 
Bottom, Pennsylvania for her more than forty 
years of federal service. 
Judy got her start in the civil service through 
a work-study program with the Social Security 
Administration. From there, Judy would go on 
to hold a number of positions throughout our 
federal government with the United States 
Army, as well as the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. 
Beginning in 1980, Judy was employed at 
the U.S. Army’s Research Institute for Chem-
ical Defense in Aberdeen, Maryland, where 
she worked alongside military personnel in 
handling and dismantling chemical agents. 
After her time at Aberdeen, Judy began 
working for the Department of Veterans Affairs 
in 1986, first at the Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center in Erie, Pennsylvania and later at other 
VA Medical Centers across Pennsylvania and 
Maryland. The highpoint of her career with the 
VA came when she took the position of Multi- 
Site Research Compliance Officer for the 
Fourth Veterans Integrated Services Network. 
Judy stayed in this role for seventeen years, 
lasting up until her retirement this month. 
We thank Judy for the many years of dedi-
cated service she gave to our country and its 
veterans. We wish her a well-deserved and 
restful retirement.

HONORING COMMAND SERGEANT 
MAJOR GARY E. GRAHAM 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the outstanding military service of 
Command Sergeant Major Gary E. Graham 
who will be retiring this year after over 43 
years of service in the Mississippi National 
Guard. 
CSM Graham hails from Conehatta, MS 
where he lives with his wife, Julie, and their 
children, Micah, Jessica, and Layla. I want to 
take the time to thank his wife and children for 
their strength and support as a military family. 
CSM Graham served a long and impressive 
military career beginning in 1978 when he at-
tended Basic Training and AIT as a Wheeled 
Vehicle and Generator Mechanic at Fort Jack-
son, SC. CSM Graham mobilized and de-
ployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom from 2003 until 2005. Upon his re-
turn from deployment, he mobilized once 
again and assumed the position of Task Force 
Magnolia CSM for Hurricane Katrina Oper-
ations. From 2006 to 2011, he was assigned 
as the Commandant of the 3rd NCO Acad-
emy. He was then reassigned as the 154th 
Regimental Training Institute CSM. In August 
2011, he was hand selected for NATO HQ Sa-
rajevo Command as the Senior Enlisted Advi-
sor to the Military and Government leadership

nents Achievement Medal, National Defense

many other federal and state awards. 
CSM Graham perfectly embodies the official 
organizational march of the United States Na-
tional Guard ‘‘Always Ready, Always There!’’ 
He is a true American patriot and I am hon-
ored to call him my friend and fellow Guards-
man. Our military servicemembers deserve to 
be recognized for their commitment to our 
great Nation and I am grateful for his unwav-
ering dedication to our country.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
LIFE 
APPLICATION 
MINISTRIES 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Life Application Min-
istries, which is celebrating 25 years of service 
to the community of Warren, Michigan. 
Life Application Ministries is a historic Afri-
can American congregation, inspired by enthu-
siasm to give back and share the love of God, 
and preserve morale and justice throughout 
the community. Life Application Ministries 
grew out of a bible study group that quickly 
garnered members throughout the 1990s. 
In 1996, Bishop Adolphus L. Cast founded 
the ministry in a time where African American 
congregations were not as prevalent in the 
area. In moments of racial injustice, the 
church gracefully responded with endless love 
and compassion to the community. Bishop 
Cast’s mission has been to bring racial and 
economic harmony to the city of Warren and 
his leadership has led to significant momen-
tum in that effort over the last two and a half 
decades. 
Throughout its history, the ministry has hon-
orably served the Warren community with var-
ious community programs including annual 
food drives and blood drives, providing finan-
cial assistance to residents and businesses, 
assisting people in need of help with home re-
pair and cleanup projects, as well as partici-
pating in larger city cleanup efforts. The 
church also offers shelter to residents in need 
through partnership with the Macomb County 
Rotating Emergency Shelter Team. 
One cannot recognize Life Application Min-
istries without acknowledging the remarkable 
leaders whose everyday commitment and 
dedication positively impact their members, 
our community, and beyond. I am proud to 
have the honor of recognizing Life Application 
Ministries 
today 
and 
to 
mark 
this 
quadricentennial event for the congregation. I 
encourage my colleagues to join me in offer-
ing congratulations to the entire Life Applica-
tion Ministries community as they celebrate 
twenty-five years of ministry and service in 
Warren, Michigan. 
HONORING RUSSELL COLOMBO 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
recognition 
of 
Russell 
(Russ) 
Colombo as he retires from a distinguished 
career in financial services spanning more 
than four decades and culminating in his role 
as President and Chief Operating Officer of 
Bank of Marin. 
Russ grew up in Marin County, CA where 
he graduated from San Rafael High School. 
He went on to earn a Bachelor of Science de-
gree in Agricultural Economics and Business 
Management from the University of California, 
Davis and his Master of Business Administra-
tion in Banking and Finance from Golden Gate 
University. After twenty-nine years in banking 
at Comerica Bank, Security Pacific, and Union 
Bank in San Francisco, Russ joined Bank of 
Marin as Executive Vice President and Branch 
Administrator in 2004. After only a year at the 
company, he was appointed Executive Vice 
President and Chief Operating Officer. As 
President and CEO since 2006, Russ led 
Bank of Marin’s growth into a prominent busi-
ness and valued community bank in Northern 
California. 
During his 15 years at the helm, Russ has 
become the face of the Bank of Marin. Under 
his leadership, the Bank championed honor-
able values of high-quality service, community 
engagement, 
and 
employee 
wellbeing. 
Through his local relationship-building efforts 
and strategic planning, including four acquisi-
tions, Russ oversaw the growth of Bank of 
Marin’s assets by more than $4 billion. 
Throughout this period of expansion, he con-
tinued to prioritize reinvesting in the local com-
munity. During the COVID–19 pandemic, Russ 
jumped in to meet the needs of the commu-
nity, facilitating the lending of critical federal 
relief loans and protecting economic vitality in 
the region. 
In a personal capacity, Russ continues to 
serve as Chairman of the Citizens Oversight 
Committee of Sonoma-Marin Area Rapid Tran-
sit (SMART). He is also a member and former 
board chair of the Board of the Western Bank-
ers Association, and a former Audit Committee 
Member of Hanna Boys Center. 
Through seasons of prosperity and difficult 
times, Russ never wavered from improving 
Bank of Marin’s performance and its core mis-
sion of serving the local community. Madam 
Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in 
honoring Russ Colombo for his many years of 
effective professional and community service 
to Marin County and extending to him best 
wishes on his next endeavors.

SUPPORTING THE NUTRITION INI-
TIATIVE 
TO 
REDUCE 
HEALTH 
DISPARITIES BY THE ACADEMY 
OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS 
AND 
THE 
NATIONAL 
BAPTIST 
CONVENTION USA 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, in late September, leaders of the Na-
tional Baptist Convention USA and the Acad-
emy of Nutrition and Dietetics (or the Acad-
emy) announced a strategic partnership aimed 
at reducing health disparities for African Amer-
icans. 
African Americans suffer disproportionately 
from COVID–19 deaths and other nutrition-re-
lated health disparities. Increasing access to 
healthy foods and addressing nutrition as a 
social determinant of health that prevents dia-
betes, heart disease, stroke, high blood pres-
sure and obesity are the cornerstones of this 
partnership. 
The joint initiative will consist of developing 
print and media resources that can be used in 
faith-based health ministries on issues such as 
diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, heart 
disease, stroke, eating on a budget, and living 
with kidney disease. The National Baptist Con-
vention USA will encourage member churches 
to incorporate these resources into new and 
existing programs and services, including 
workshops and seminars focused on biblical 
connections to food and nutrition. 
I want to commend and thank Patricia 
Babjak, Chief Executive Officer of the Acad-
emy, Evelyn Crayton, a past president of the 
Academy and the current Chair of the National 
Baptist Convention Task Force on the joint nu-
trition partnership that is comprised of mem-
bers from the National Organization of Blacks 
in Dietetics and Nutrition, as well as religious 
interest groups for their commitment and lead-
ership to addressing health disparities. The 
Academy has worked closely on this signifi-
cant initiative with National Baptist Convention 
USA President Rev. Dr. Jerry Young and Vice 
President Rev. Dr. William H. Foster, Jr. 
This partnership recognizes the importance 
of enhancing the lives of African Americans 
and every racial and ethnic group by improv-
ing nutrition security. In my Congressional Dis-
trict, there are too many food deserts and 
places where it’s easier to get access to guns 
than fruits and vegetables. 
I urge us all to get behind this initiative, and 
I applaud the Academy and the National Bap-
tist Convention USA for their lifesaving work.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF

HON. CHARLIE CRIST

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the passing of Winter the Dol-

and in honor of her home and family at Clear-
water Marine Aquarium in my district. 
After being rescued from a crab trap in De-
cember 2005, two-month-old Winter lost her 
tail and had to adapt to life without it. 
But Winter didn’t just survive. She thrived. 
And with a new prosthetic tail, her resilience 
inspired millions around the world—including 
many wounded and disabled veterans. 
Winter’s story became the inspiration for the 
movies Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2. And 
over her life, Winter provided hope to all who 
met her, and brought awareness to the plight 
of marine mammals. 
Winter’s legacy is one of perseverance, 
courage, and environmental stewardship.

HONORING 
THE 
155TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FIRST BAPTIST 
CHURCH OF FRANKLIN 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 155th anniversary 
of First Baptist Church of Franklin which has 
been a continuing source of inspiration for the 
community of Franklin, Virginia. The church 
was founded in 1866, a year after slavery was 
abolished in the United States. First Baptist 
Church of Franklin stands tall as the oldest or-
ganization of continuous existence in Franklin. 
The beginnings of First Baptist Church of 
Franklin were one of hardship at the initial 
phase of the Reconstruction era. A young man 
of faith named Joseph Gregory was rec-
ommended to be a licensed preacher. Rev-
erend Gregory was assigned a post to give 
the message of Christ to the African American 
members of this and other churches. 
Through the following months, he started 
preaching in the little village of Franklin. He 
took initiative and organized the Cool Spring 
Baptist Church. The church started in a brush 
arbor near the Black Water River, which was 
donated by Tom Barrett, one of the church’s 
members. Unfortunately, the brush arbor 
burned down but this did not stop the contin-
uous work of the congregants. Under the lead-
ership of the founding pastor, the members re-
built and continued serving their community. 
Following the leadership of Reverend Gregory, 
First Baptist Church of Franklin has had a di-
verse succession of faithful servants, such as 
Reverend Guy Powell, Reverend M.E. Gerst, 
Dr. W.R. Ashburn, Reverend S.W. Timms, 
Reverend W.E. Sanderlin, Dr. M.C. Allen, 
Reverend Grover C. Lassiter, Reverend Sam-
uel Franklyn Daly, Reverend Henry Blunt, 
Reverend Dr. Paige Chargois, Reverend Dr. 
D.S. Riddick, II and the church’s current pas-
tor, Reverend Marcus D. Jennings. 
First Baptist Church of Franklin is still a pil-
lar of the community. The organization’s min-
istries bring essential services to the City of 
Franklin and its citizens. In these trying times, 
First Baptist Church of Franklin has shown re-
siliency and remains a source of inspiration for 
its congregants. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the mem-
bers and leaders of First Baptist Church of 
Franklin for their contributions to the City of 
Franklin for the last 155 years. The ongoing 
commitment to preach the gospel, give the 
good news and to extend faith is reflected in 
the rich history of the church. I commend pas-
tor Marcus Jennings for his vision and service 
to his congregation, the community of Frank-
lin, and the members of the congregation who 
all make a community of faith possible. I wish 
the church many more years of growth and 
prosperity.

REMEMBERING NUNZIO MERLO 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my friend, Nunzio Merlo, who 
passed away on Friday, October 17, 2021 at 
the age of 80. 
He was born September 14, 1941 in 
Gioiosa 
Marea 
Sicily, 
Italy 
the 
son 
of 
Giuseppe and Tindara Stancampiano-Pizzo 
Merlo. He grew up in the mountains of Sicily 
with his three sisters and three brothers, his 
father (a sheep farmer and cheese maker) 
and his mother (a homemaker). Nunzio’s time 
as a young man in Sicily was spent working 
as a tree trimmer and a taxi driver, and he en-
joyed singing and playing guitar. He met the 
love of his life, Maria, in Gioiosa Marea when 
he was nineteen and she was seventeen. 
They married on August 12, 1962. 
On November 13, 1965 Nunzio immigrated 
to America with his wife and two-year-old son 
to build a new life. He was always a hard 
worker and often worked two jobs. Nunzio was 
employed at National Gypsum, the same com-
pany my grandfather Rizzi worked for, General 
Motors Lordstown, Tauro Brother’s Trucking, 
and the U.S. Postal Service. He was also a 
self-employed truck driver. He retired after 17 
years working for the City of Niles Water De-
partment in 2015. 
He was a member of Our Lady of Mount 
Carmel Parish in Niles, where he could always 
be found volunteering at the church festivals 
and Lenten fish dinners. It wasn’t an event at 
Mt. Carmel unless Nunzio was working. He 
was a member of the Sons of Italy, Niles 
Democratic Club, Niles Knights of Columbus 
Council 1681, and he played in several bocce 
leagues. 
Nunzio’s dedication to family was at the 
heart of everything he did. He especially en-
joyed cooking Sunday dinners for his family. 
Nunzio enjoyed gardening and playing Italian 
cards with family and friends and attending his 
grandchildren’s extracurricular activities and 
events. His kind heart, willingness to help oth-
ers and his infectious smile will live in the 
memories of family and friends forever. I can 
truly say, Madam Speaker, I would not be in 
Congress today if it wasn’t for Nunzio Merlo 
and his family. They launched my career and 
I will forever be grateful. 
He will be sadly missed by his wife of 59 
years, Maria Calabrese Merlo, his father-in-law 
Tindaro Calabrese of Niles, four sons: Joseph 
Merlo and his wife Louise of Niles, Robert 
Merlo and his wife Jamie of Niles, Tino Merlo 
and his wife Michelle of Howland, and 
Giovanne Merlo and his wife Monica of Niles, 
two sisters: Maria Merlo of Gioiosa Marea Sic-
ily Italy, and Rosa Merlo of Cefalu, Sicily, ten 
grandchildren: 
Giuseppe 
Merlo 
(Sarah 
Marlinski), Nicolette Merlo, Alenna Merlo, 
Nunzio Merlo, Roberto Merlo, Isabella Merlo, 
Gianna Merlo, Tino Merlo, Emma Merlo, and 
Giovanne Merlo. He is also survived by many 
loving nieces, nephews and cousins in the 
U.S. and Sicily.

WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
DAY 2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in honor of Women’s Entrepreneurship 
Day which is celebrated around the world 
each year on November 19th. 
Women-owned U.S. firms make up nearly 
20 percent of all firms that employ people and 
this number is growing. There are nearly 13 
million women-owned firms and they employ 
close to 10 million people. As a testament to 
their success, women-owned firms reported 
revenues of nearly $1.9 trillion. This is truly 
astounding and shows you how vital women 
are to the economy. I applaud these women 
entrepreneurs and their economically vital 
businesses. 
I also applaud Wendy Diamond, who has 
personally spearheaded the Women’s Entre-
preneurship Day movement. Since her cam-
paign launched in 2013, her Women’s Entre-
preneurship Day Organization has annually 
funded one thousand impoverished women 
with microloans to start their entrepreneurial 
journey in Nicaragua, India and Africa, hosted 
a nationwide entrepreneurship training pro-
gram for 60,000 female college students and 
early-stage entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia, ini-
tiated and funded the premiere Women’s Dis-
ability Cohort Pitch Competition, a visionary 
program that raises funding opportunities for 
women marginalized by their disabilities in 
partnership with 2Gether International, pro-
vided financial literacy education to one thou-
sand rural women in the Philippines, and 
partnered with a Uruguayan university to offer 
scholarships to young women. 
Women’s Entrepreneurship Day is now cele-
brated in 144 countries and 65 universities 
and colleges internationally, with numerous 
global ambassadors. The Women’s Entrepre-
neurship Day mission is to empower the near-
ly four billion women worldwide to be catalysts 
of change and uplift the over 250 million girls 
living in poverty around the world. 
As in past years, the Women’s Entrepre-
neurship Day Organization Pioneer Awards 
recognizes, and honors distinguished women 
who are leaders and innovators across mul-
tiple categories with inspiring accomplish-
ments. This year’s honorees include: 
Cathie Wood, Founder and CEO of ARK In-
vestment Management, LLC—Financial Pio-
neer Award 
Jeni Britton Bauer, CEO/Founder Jeni’s 
Splendid Ice Creams—Culinary Pioneer Award 
Judith Heumann, International Disability 
Rights Advocate, The Heumann Perspective— 
Human Rights Pioneer Award 
Mona Scott-Young, CEO of Monami Produc-
tions—Entertainment Pioneer Award 
The Honorable Kathy Hochul, 57th & first fe-
male Governor of New York State—Govern-
ment Pioneer Award

lier Swarovski and Chair of Swarovski Foun-
dation—Fashion Pioneer Award 
Dawn 
Dickson-Akpoghene, 
CEO 
and

Madam Speaker, I urge the entire House to 
recognize these remarkable role models, and 
to celebrate Women’s Entrepreneurship Day 
this year and every year moving forward.

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF JACOB 
DEITER AND HIS VETERANS ME-
MORIAL EAGLE SCOUT PROJECT 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Jacob Deiter, an outstanding young 
man who dedicated his Eagle Scout project to 
our nation’s veterans. Jacob went above and 
beyond to bring a veterans’ memorial to his 
hometown of Van Buren, Ohio. His hard work 
and dedication are truly deserving of high 
praise. 
Jacob is a 17-year-old senior at Van Buren 
High School and a member of Boy Scout 
Troop 313. In order to complete his Eagle 
Scout project, he spent the last two years 
planning and organizing the establishment of a 
memorial in the town square to honor the 
area’s veterans. 
Since 1775, millions of Americans have 
served in the United States Armed Forces. 
Every battle has left an impact on our nation’s 
veterans and their families. It is important to 
recognize the sacrifices they made for our 
country. This memorial includes a sidewalk 
with engraved bricks honoring area veterans 
as well as a granite memorial stone. There are 
also seven flag poles, one for each branch of 
service along with the United States and POW 
flags. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Jacob Deiter for the com-
pletion of this memorial for the veterans of 
Van Buren. He has shown outstanding leader-
ship in his community and is most worthy of 
this recognition. On behalf of the people of the 
Fifth District of Ohio, I wish Jacob all the best 
in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
LORRAINE SULLIVAN FROM THE 
DEARBORN 
MICHIGAN 
SOCIAL 
SECURITY OFFICE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Lorraine Sullivan on 
the occasion of her retirement from the Dear-
born, Michigan Social Security Office after 
over thirty-seven years of service to the Social 
Security Administration. Her significant con-
tributions in service of our community are wor-
thy of commendation. 
Mrs. Sullivan got her start at the Social Se-
curity Administration as a Stay in School par-
ticipant. She later held many titles as she 
worked her way up the ranks, serving as De-
velopment Claims Clerk, Claims Technical Ex-
pert, Operations Supervisor and now, District 
Manager of the Dearborn Field Office. The re-
cipient of two Regional Commission Citations, 
her excellence in service is evident through 
her work as a leader in the office. Dedicated 
to improving the conditions of the workplace, 
she is an advocate for diversity and inclusion 
within her office and celebrates the diversity of 
her staff, encouraging them to present devel-
opmental trainings on various topics. 
Known by others for her can-do attitude and 
willingness to help others, her staff describes 
her as a fair, straightforward, and empathic 
manager. Always looking for a way to uplift 
her staff, she has encouraged and mentored 
many team members who have gone on to 
become leaders in their own right. Outside of 
work, she enjoys travelling, dancing, and 
spending time with her loving family, including 
her granddaughter Carlaheyah. Mrs. Sullivan 
and her husband Carl Sullivan have two sons, 
Theo and Carl. An active member of Mount 
Olive Baptist Church—the church where she 
and Carl married twenty-three years ago, she 
is an enthusiastic volunteer and member of 
the choir. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Lorraine Sullivan for her dedi-
cated service to the Dearborn Michigan Social 
Security Office. We are grateful for her years 
spent serving countless Michiganders and her 
legacy will live on through the numerous staff 
members that she has mentored. I join with 
Lorraine’s family, friends, and colleagues in 
extending my best wishes to her in retirement.

FTC INVESTIGATING BIG OIL 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of President Biden’s call for the 
FTC to investigate the world’s largest oil com-
panies that appear to be engaging in egre-
gious price manipulation of oil and gasoline 
prices. 
In August, Big Oil started substantially re-
ducing production—a bizarre move as our 
economy was surging forward after the pan-
demic downturn. 
At a time when oil production costs are 
going down, and unprocessed gasoline awaits 
distilling, Big Oil is driving prices up—and 
reaping the benefits. The two biggest compa-
nies are on pace to double their income since 
2019. This is outrageous. 
It appears corporate fat cats are padding 
their own wallets at the expense of our na-
tional wellbeing. Enough is enough. 
The FTC should take a deep dive into Big 
Oil—and put a stop to any nefarious behavior 
that is harming hardworking Americans. 
I applaud President Biden’s call for action— 
and hope to see enforcement soon.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
SACRIFICES OF THE TRANSPOR-
TATION SECURITY ADMINISTRA-
TION’S EMPLOYEES AND OFFI-
CERS ON THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF TSA’S ESTABLISHMENT 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I join with the Ranking Member of 
the House Homeland Security Committee, 
JOHN KATKO, and Transportation and Maritime 
Security Subcommittee Chairwoman BONNIE 
WATSON COLEMAN and Ranking Member CAR-
LOS GIMENEZ, to mark tomorrow’s 20th anni-
versary of the establishment of the Transpor-
tation Security Administration. 
Following the devastating attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, Federal authorities under-
took the massive effort to safeguard and de-
fend our national transportation system. In the 
past two decades, TSA has implemented ad-
vanced security technologies, responded to 
new and ever-changing threats, and protected 
the lives of billions of passengers from around 
the country and across the globe. Today, even 
amid the dangers of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Transportation Security Officers, Federal Air 
Marshals, Transportation Security Inspectors, 
and other TSA employees continue to serve 
on the front lines and protect the lives of pas-
sengers and the security of cargo traveling by 
air, sea, road, and rail. 
I include in the RECORD the text of a resolu-
tion recognizing the service and sacrifices of 
TSA’s employees and officers on the 20th an-
niversary of TSA’s establishment. 
RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the service and sacrifices of 
the Transportation Security Administra-
tion’s employees and officers on the occasion 
of the 20th anniversary of the establishment 
of TSA and the role TSA’s employees and of-
ficers play in keeping our Nation secure. 
Whereas November 19, 2021, marks the 20th 
anniversary of the enactment of the Avia-
tion and Transportation Security Act (Pub-
lic Law 107–71), which amended title 49, 
United States Code, to establish the Trans-
portation Security Administration (TSA); 
Whereas the TSA was established following 
the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, 
with the mission to secure transportation 
systems and restore confidence in air travel; 
Whereas for 20 years TSA employees and 
officers have bravely served on the front 
lines keeping our skies and the traveling 
public safe, even in the face of targeted at-
tacks such as that which took the life of Of-
ficer Gerardo Hernandez; 
Whereas the TSA has remained on the 
front lines at our Nation’s airports through-
out the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the TSA has had over 10,000 em-
ployees test positive for COVID–19, with 32 
TSA employees having lost their lives from 
March 2020 through October 2021; 
Whereas since its establishment, TSA em-
ployees and officers have endeavored to im-
prove security domestically and internation-
ally, across all modes of transportation, 
against a wide range of evolving physical and 
cyber threats; and 
Whereas Americans will continue to look 
to TSA to be vigilant in the face of known 
and emerging threats: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) recognizes— 
(A) the service and sacrifices of the TSA’s 
employees and officers on the occasion of the 
20th anniversary of the establishment of 
TSA; and 
(B) the role TSA’s employees and officers 
play in keeping our Nation secure; and 
(2) encourages all Americans to observe 
TSA’s 20th anniversary with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.

HONORING JANICE SIEGEL ON HER 
RETIREMENT 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 18, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the work and dedication of my longest- 
serving congressional staff person—Janice 
Siegel. 
Janice worked with me and a small group of 
people on the brief but intense campaign to fill 
the vacancy left by Ted Weiss in 1992. She 
came with me to Washington, D.C., to set up 
my office and staff for my first term and stayed 
with my office for 29 years. As my Director of 
Operations, Janice provided sound advice on 
complicated budget, ethics, and personnel 
matters. Her careful, methodical approach to 
financial matters has served the office well 
and has saved us tens of thousands of dollars 
over the years. Janice also managed my D.C. 
schedule for more than twenty years, made 
countless train/plane/and hotel reservations for 
me, and tracked every penny of our Members’ 
Representational Allowance. Perhaps most im-
portantly she made sure we never overspent 
our MRA, and, therefore, I was never asked to 
pay for any office expenses from my own 
pocket. I thank her for that. 
Janice also coordinated numerous office 
moves over her career in the House and 
worked on everything from the color of the 
carpet, walls and drapes, to the purchasing of 
equipment, and movement of phones and 
computers throughout the House complex. 
She was well known throughout the House by 
the many hundreds of people she worked with 
on all these matters over the years. 
Janice not only served my office well, but 
she was a real asset to the House of Rep-
resentatives as a whole and helped with nu-
merous House-wide initiatives to make the 
House operate more efficiently and effectively. 
Janice founded the Professional Administra-
tive Managers (PAM) organization, and as its 
leader she organized a number of large meet-
ings which brought staff together with House 
Administrative officials to discuss the imple-
mentation of new policies and procedures re-
lated to House operations. In addition, she 
worked with the Office of the Inspector Gen-
eral to create a ‘‘Financial Administrators Cur-
riculum’’ which is now offered by the Congres-
sional Staff Academy. Her organization in-
cluded offices from both sides of the aisle and 
its influence was felt by the leaders of House 
Administration who frequently sought input 
and advice from the group. She was in regular 
contact with the various Chief Administrative 
Officers (CAO) of the House, the C.F.O., and 
the Directors of Payroll during her time on the 
Hill. These relationships gave her access to 
information and resources that were very help-
ful to our office. 
On another note, Janice has always cared 
about me personally, about my reputation, and 
especially about my personal safety. Over the 
years, Janice made sure the Capitol Police 
were aware of the threats against me and took 
additional steps to enhance my safety. She 
has had my interests in mind as she made 
spending and ethics decisions and was driven 
by a strong sense or right and wrong that kept 
me out of trouble for her entire tenure. As she 
was fond of saying, her job was to keep me 
OUT of the news. Meaning, she never wanted 
there to be a news story that we were not run-
ning the office ethically or in a financially 
sound manner. 
Finally. Janice is a compassionate, caring 
person who has a touch for and a real under-
standing of the importance of nice gestures. 
She takes the initiative to make suggestions 
for reaching out to people, especially when 
they are sick or someone close to them has 
recently passed away. She is thoughtful and 
considerate of others when it matters most. I 
appreciate all she has done over the years to 
connect with people facing trying times. 
I would be remiss if I did not mention 
Janice’s family and her husband, Frank 
Mumford. Janice is a wonderful daughter, sis-
ter, and wife and mentioned her family often 
while at work. She cared for her father when 
he became ill and moved into her home, and 
helped her sister get the help she needed to 
get treatment for cancer. She and Frank sup-
ported each other through tough times and 
were always there for one another. She is 
lucky to have Frank by her side. 
Janice herself is a breast cancer survivor 
and she worked in our office all through her 
own treatment. She faced the diagnosis brave-
ly and unafraid. She has always been a strong 
supporter of breast cancer research and fund-
ing and was always looking for ways for us to 
get involved and be supportive of the cause. 
We know that the loss of her mother to the 
disease when she was just a child affected 
her deeply. We imagine her mother would be 
proud to see her daughter working in Con-
gress, supporting efforts to increase funding 
for breast cancer research, working for a 
Member from New York City, and doing so 
with such distinction and for such a long pe-
riod of time. 
I know I am proud of the work she has done 
for us and want to sincerely thank her for ev-
erything she has done for me. 
We will miss Janice. We wish her all the 
best in her retirement.
