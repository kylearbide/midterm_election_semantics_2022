DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
for the information of Members, I have 
a brief statement. 
I have some good news. We have 
reached an agreement to extend the 
debt ceiling through early December. It 
is our hope that we can get this done as 
soon as today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Republican members and Democratic 
members of staff negotiated through 
the night in good faith. The Senate is 
moving toward the plan I laid out yes-
terday to spare the American people a 
manufactured crisis. All year, the 
Democratic government has made un-
precedented and repeated use of rec-
onciliation to pass radical policies on 
party-line votes. 
So, back in July, Republicans in-
formed our colleagues they would need 
to pursue any long-term increase in the 
debt ceiling through the same process. 
The President, the Speaker, and the 
Democratic leader had 3 months’ no-
tice to do their jobs, but for 21⁄2 months 
the Democratic leaders did nothing and 
then complained that they were actu-
ally short on time. 
The majority didn’t have a plan to 
prevent default, so we stepped forward. 
The 
pathway 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues have accepted will spare the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6950 
October 7, 2021 
American people any near-term crisis 
while definitively resolving the major-
ity’s excuse that they lacked time to 
address the debt limit through the 304 
reconciliation process. Now there will 
be no question; they will have plenty of 
time. 
Or, if our colleagues would instead 
prefer a more traditional bipartisan 
discussion around basic governance, 
they can stop trying to ram through 
yet another reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree that would hurt families and 
help China. That would be the path to-
ward that kind of discussion. 
f 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on a related matter, Washington 
Democrats are behind closed doors try-
ing to hammer out a multitrillion-dol-
lar reckless taxing-and-spending spree, 
but we already know a lot about this 
bill. 
First and foremost, we know their 
reckless legislation would hurt Amer-
ican families and actually help China. 
It is that simple: inflicting pain on 
American workers and families while 
putting us at a global disadvantage. 
Just look at the radical climate poli-
cies Democrats have packed into the 
spree to satisfy their far-left base. The 
apples haven’t fallen far from the awful 
Green New Deal. In the name of clean 
energy performance, Democrats want 
to force electric utilities to model 
their grids off of the high-cost, black-
out-prone system that liberals have set 
up in the State of California; move all 
50 States’ electric grids toward Califor-
nia’s. 
As one group of major power pro-
viders observed, not only would this be 
logistically unworkable, it would also 
threaten to send consumers’ electricity 
costs totally out of control. And in the 
words of a member of the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission who tes-
tified before our colleagues just last 
week, the scheme would be ‘‘H-bomb’’— 
‘‘H-bomb’’—for the electricity markets. 
At the same time, Democrats are 
also pushing a brand-new natural gas 
tax they call a methane fee. It is a nat-
ural gas tax is what it is. Just as our 
friends in Europe are facing soaring 
natural gas costs and the threat of win-
ter shortages, just as it seems Russia 
may be willingly supplying less and 
less gas to the free world, Democrats 
want our Nation to declare war on nat-
ural gas, kill tens of thousands of jobs, 
drain billions from the economy, and 
increase costs for our families—at a 
moment when U.S. natural gas futures 
just hit a 12-year high. 
There is no limit to the harm Demo-
crats will inflict on America to force 
the heartland to accept elite liberal 
fashions. Their legislation includes 
special giveaways for electric cars that 
are disproportionately the preferred 
option—you 
guessed 
it—of 
wealthy 
people, jacking up America’s gas bills 
and utility prices in order to turn 49 
other States into California. It is a bad 
idea at an awful time and just one 
more way their reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree would hurt families and 
help China. 
f 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on a related matter, while Ameri-
cans contend with Democrats’ self-cre-
ated border crisis and inflation crisis, 
our foreign policy is in crisis as well. 
The Biden administration’s disas-
trous retreat from Afghanistan may be 
over, but the danger to the American 
citizens and Afghan partners it left be-
hind certainly is not over. Around the 
world, adversaries and allies alike are 
drawing new conclusions from Presi-
dent 
Biden’s 
Afghanistan 
disaster 
about America’s will to defend our al-
lies and our interests. 
Pyongyang is putting on another 
master class in how despots disdain the 
so-called 
rules-based 
international 
order. Literally, while a North Korean 
official was haranguing the U.N. in a 
speech about the ‘‘consequences it will 
bring in the future in case it tries to 
encroach upon [its] sovereignty,’’ the 
Kim regime punctuated the speech 
with yet another provocative round of 
U.N. sanctions-violating ballistic mis-
sile tests. 
Iranian disregard for international 
norms and the Biden administration’s 
efforts 
to 
enforce 
them 
continues 
apace. Tehran is ramping up its nu-
clear activities, demanding bribes to 
even return to the negotiating table, as 
well as stepping up its use of terrorist 
proxies to threaten its adversaries all 
across the region. 
In light of our retreat from Afghani-
stan, we should not be surprised if Ira-
nian-backed groups redouble their ef-
forts to inflict U.S. casualties and oth-
erwise pressure the Biden administra-
tion to turn tail and run from Syria 
and Iraq. 
When it comes to near-peer competi-
tors like Russia, the Biden campaign’s 
tough talk has been replaced by the 
Biden administration’s desperate rhet-
oric of diplomacy. Putin is unfazed and 
undeterred. 
Repression at home, manipulation of 
energy markets abroad, military mod-
ernization, cyber mischief—this doesn’t 
exactly scream ready for good-faith en-
gagement. 
Most of all, the administration’s hol-
low rhetoric has done nothing to deter 
the growing threat from communist 
China. Just this month, Beijing has 
sent a record number of military air-
craft on provocative missions into Tai-
wan’s airspace. As senior Pentagon of-
ficials have warned, ‘‘we are witnessing 
a strategic breakout’’ by China, Demo-
crats still refuse to let us adequately 
fund our own military and defense. 
The Biden administration’s budget 
falls woefully short of our require-
ments for greater competition with 
China and with Russia—all the more so 
given the inevitable growing terror 
threat. And here in Congress, Demo-
crats are doubling down on this reck-
less misstep. Democrats want to spend 
trillions of dollars on a socialist wish 
list at home while leaving the service-
members who keep us safe overseas in 
the lurch. 
Now, I don’t expect Chairman SAND-
ERS or certain radicals in the House to 
be keen on using reconciliation to fund 
our 
military—hardly. 
But 
Senate 
Democrats have left Congress’s most 
fundamental tool for influencing de-
fense policy—the historically bipar-
tisan NDAA—in procedural limbo lit-
erally for months. 
The Democratic leader’s latest public 
statement on his caucus’s spending pri-
orities did not even mention the de-
fense authorization bill. Apparently, he 
is content to let it languish behind 
their leftwing wish list. 
So, Madam President, America is 
staring 
down 
serious 
and 
historic 
threats. And somehow, with unified 
control of government, the only ac-
tions Democrats have managed to take 
on foreign policy have made them 
worse. 
The American people deserve a lot 
better than this. Our servicemembers 
deserve better. Our allies deserve bet-
ter. But Washington Democrats are 
proving they cannot deliver. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MEGAN MERCER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on one final matter, it is a small 
group of people who become familiar 
faces right here on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate. There are the Senators them-
selves, the nonpartisan professionals 
on the dais, the Capitol Police, and 
doorkeepers. 
And then, Madam President, you 
have the men and women of each par-
ty’s cloakroom. These small and tight- 
knit teams keep information flowing 
from the Senate floor to Members’ of-
fices and vice versa. They track legis-
lation and amendments. They nego-
tiate procedure across the aisle. And in 
a thousand other duties, they all add 
up to tense days, late nights, and a 
truly front-row seat to Congress. 
For the last decade, one of those spe-
cial few has been a daughter of Ken-
tucky and an alumna of my own office: 
Megan Mercer. 
Megan’s Senate story started about 
15 years ago, when she spent a summer 
as a page. Before long, this impressive 
young woman took an internship in my 
personal office, serving Kentucky; then 
an entry-level position in my leader-
ship office here in the Capitol; and then 
Megan came here to the floor, to the 
Republican cloakroom. 
A decade ago now, she took a seat be-
hind their big desk. She answered 
phones. She answered questions. She 
learned the ropes. And over 10 years, 
she worked her way up to a key role of 
senior floor assistant. 
Pick any important vote, and Megan 
has been right here in the well, at this 
table, tallying the count for our side. 
She has cleared legislation and consent

requests. She has negotiated with Dem-
ocrat counterparts on a daily basis. 
Through it all, Megan’s colleagues 
have come to admire her patience, 
level-headedness, and the institutional 
knowledge she has built up; and so 
have we Senators. 
Fortunately, the work has not been 
thankless. I remember Megan was espe-
cially thrilled when Senator Lamar 
Alexander made sure that Megan’s help 
with the Music Modernization Act 
yielded a signed ‘‘thank you’’ note 
from Dolly Parton—one of her all-time 
favorites. 
So as we, unfortunately, prepare for 
Megan’s upcoming departure from the 
Senate, I want to thank her for her fine 
public service. Megan has made her na-
tive Kentucky proud; she has made her 
parents Dr. Albert and Robin Mercer 
very proud; and she has made me proud 
as well. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-

f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate Judiciary Committee 
released a report after an investigation 
of the circumstances surrounding Don-
ald Trump’s efforts to take over the 
Justice Department during the closing 
days of the last calendar year and be-
ginning of this year. 
Since January, the Committee has 
investigated reports that White House 
officials, including the President him-
self, pressed the Department of Justice 
to support President Trump’s unsub-
stantiated bids to overturn the 2020 
election results, and that Acting Civil 
Division Assistant AG Jeffrey Clark 
aided in that effort. 
Today’s interim staff report sheds 
new light on former President Donald 
Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 
election. Jeffrey Clark became Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie lawyer, pressuring his 
colleagues in the Department of Jus-
tice to force an overturn of the 2020 
election. 
Let me put this in perspective. The 
election was in November. The results 
were announced. Most of the world ac-
cepted it, but the former President, 
Donald Trump, never did. He filed a 
succession of lawsuits to prove that the 
election had been stolen. He failed in 
every effort in court. That was stage 
one. 
Having failed in court with some of 
the most outlandish theories imag-
inable, but considered normal for the 
likes of Rudy Giuliani, they went into 
the second phase. The second phase was 
to coerce the Department of Justice 
and the Attorney General to intervene 
in the election results and to reach out 
directly, as the President did himself 
personally, to the election officials in 
States where he thought he should 
have won but he didn’t. 
So all that effort was under way 
when William Barr, President Trump’s 
Attorney General at the time, issued a 
statement saying there was no evi-
dence of widespread fraud in the elec-
tion. That was disappointing to the 
President. 
It occurred that in the middle of De-
cember of last year, William Barr, the 
Attorney General, announced that he 
was going to resign as of December 23. 
A man was chosen as the Acting Attor-
ney General, Jeffrey Rosen, and Rich-
ard Donoghue as Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral. 
There was a full court press on at 
that time by President Trump and his 
supporters to influence Jeffrey Rosen 
into intervening into this election con-
test. When I say ‘‘full court press,’’ I 
am talking about repeated telephone 
calls and meetings in the White House 
over a period of 2 weeks. 
This report, which we have brought 
to the attention of the public, as well 
as members of the Committee, obvi-
ously, went into detail as to what hap-
pened during that 2-week period of 
time. It was an incredible moment, 
which most Americans didn’t even 
know was going on. We were a half step 
away from a full-blown constitutional 
crisis because what the President was 
trying to do was to convince the Attor-
ney General to contact the leaders in 
the 
States 
where 
he 
thought—the 
President thought he had won the elec-
tion and to tell them to not certify the 
results and to pick an alternative set 
of electors in some instances. 
In each of these cases, the President 
was—President Trump—pushing a the-
ory on why he actually won. These 
theories went from crazy to silly, to 
outlandish. 
Let me give you one of them. It was 
called Italy-gate. I hope you caught 
this 
one 
because, 
naturally, 
Rudy 
Giuliani was somehow involved with 
this—some notion that Italian sat-
ellites were intercepting the voting 
machines in America and changing the 
results against Donald Trump. That is 
the nature of things. 
In the State of Georgia, the Presi-
dent and his supporters were arguing 
that they have videotapes proving that 
people brought in suitcases full of bal-
lots, and they showed these videotapes. 
The election officials in Georgia— 
which, I might add, all Republican— 
countered that by saying that those 
were actual containers of ballots and 
that was the ordinary process; there 
was nothing sinister going on there. 
State after State, case after case, 
Trump was making the argument that 
he was cheated out of the election— 
which, of course, was false, but he still 
believes it to this day—and putting the 
pressure on Acting Attorney General 
Jeffrey Rosen to be complicit in this 
plot. He even asked him to consider fil-
ing a special case in the Supreme Court 
across the street to stop the election 
results from being certified. 
Our report shows that Jeffrey Rosen 
and his Deputy, Richard Donoghue, re-
sisted this from the start. Jeffrey 
Clark, 
another 
Assistant 
Attorney 
General in the Civil Division who had 
nothing, literally, to do with this mat-
ter on a legal basis, were in conflict 
from that point—Clark, on the side of 
Trump, saying that the letters to the 
States should be issued, and Rosen and 
Donoghue arguing that there was no 
basis in fact, no proof of election fraud 
that could warrant that kind of un-
precedented action. 
In the meantime, many other play-
ers, like Mark Meadows in the White 
House, were also pressuring the De-
partment of Justice. The net result of 
it was a fateful day—I believe it was 
January 3 of this year—when the Presi-
dent called Rosen, Donoghue, and 
Clark to the White House to pursue his 
effort to replace Rosen with Clark, a 
more complicit person in the process. 
At that moment, two things hap-
pened that were significant. The White 
House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, dis-
sented from the President’s position 
and said it was a murder-suicide pact 
for him to engage in this. Secondly, at 
that point, the eight leading officials 
in the Department of Justice all said 
that they would resign en masse if 
there was a replacement of the Acting 
Attorney General by Mr. Clark. 
The President hesitated and decided 
at the very last minute not to pursue 
that course, not to replace him. That 
was significant, I will tell you, because 
had it happened otherwise, there would 
have been a possibility that there 
would have been a contest on the elec-
tion results. 
What did the President do next after 
deciding that? Well, just for good 
measure, he ended up forcing the res-
ignation of the U.S. attorney in Geor-
gia who refused to buy his outlandish 
claims. It was the President’s way of 
protesting that particular U.S. attor-
ney’s—Mr. Cox—independence in the 
situation. 
What followed? We know what fol-
lowed. In a matter of 3 days, this Presi-
dent, former President, desperate in his 
situation, having failed in every court 
case, having failed to take over the De-
partment of Justice, decided to take 
his cause to the streets. We saw it in 
the U.S. Capitol 3 days later on Janu-
ary 6. The President turned loose a 
mob—a mob that was supposed to stop 
us from counting the electoral votes 
and electoral ballots. 
Most people say: Well, we heard most 
of this story before, so what is the 
point of it? The point of it is that we 
were so close to a constitutional crisis 
at that moment that it bears continued 
investigation and disclosure so the

October 7, 2021 
American people know that we should 
never be complacent when it comes to 
our rights as citizens and to our re-
sponsibilities to our Constitution. 
This 
President, 
former 
President 
Donald Trump, would have shredded 
the Constitution to keep his office in 
the Presidency. There is no doubt in 
my mind. 
To think that we reached that stage 
in history is certainly worth reflection 
for a moment. What more should we do 
going forward to make certain that we 
protect this democracy from the likes 
of Donald Trump or any of his succes-
sors in interest? That, I think, is a 
major responsibility that we face. 
I hope this report from the Senate 
Judiciary Committee will reopen the 
conversation. I hope as well that the 
select committee of the House on the 
January 6 occurrence, the mob insur-
rection here at the Capitol—we sub-
mitted this evidence to them. I hope it 
is a benefit to them as they move for-
ward. 
I certainly hope that, on a bipartisan 
basis, we can decide that the ordinary 
course of action with a valid, legal 
election deciding the future of this 
country is always the best route in a 
democracy. 
f 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there has been a controversy going on 
the last several years which has really 
been to the detriment of many good 
people. 
In 2007, Congress made a promise to 
college students. Here is what we said 
14 years ago: If you will give us 10 years 
of life in public service and you make 
your student loan payments during 
that 10-year period of time, at the end 
of it, America will forgive the remain-
der of your student debt. 
We said that, and more than a mil-
lion people took us up on the promise. 
They passed up perhaps higher salaries 
in more lucrative professions in order 
to serve the country. Then they discov-
ered at the end of the 10-year period 
that the loan forgiveness they were 
promised wasn’t coming. Nearly 99 per-
cent of those who applied under the 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness Pro-
gram were denied relief, often for su-
perficial clerical errors, loan servicing 
mistakes, or other matters beyond 
their control. 
Well, good news: Those days of bro-
ken promises are over. Yesterday, the 
Biden administration announced im-
portant changes to this program to 
help hundreds of thousands of bor-
rowers finally get the relief we prom-
ised over 10 years ago. The Education 
Department estimates the changes will 
immediately erase the debt of 22,000 
borrowers, more than the total number 
of loans that have been forgiven so far 
under the program. All told, more than 
550,000 borrowers could see a reduction 
in the amount of additional time they 
make in payments. 
Servicemembers whose loans were 
deferred while they were on Active 
Duty will have those periods of duty 
applied towards payments, as they 
should be. This is good news, and it is 
long overdue. 
Many of my Democratic colleagues 
and I tried for 4 years during the 
Trump administration to fix this pro-
gram. They ignored us. So I want to 
thank President Biden and Education 
Secretary 
Cardona 
for 
following 
through on their commitment to fix 
this important program and recognize 
the essential work of these public serv-
ants who sacrifice for this country and 
for the people who live here and should 
receive 
what 
we 
promised—helping 
hands on their student loans. 
f 
VACCINES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on 
another matter, today, President Biden 
is traveling to Chicago. He arrives with 
a simple message: Vaccines work. 
In Illinois and across the country, 
vaccine mandates are saving lives and 
allowing life to return closer to nor-
mal. Over the past month, our State 
has experienced a nearly 40-percent de-
crease in new COVID cases. We are see-
ing similar trends around the country. 
In the months since the Biden admin-
istration announced its policy requir-
ing the majority of Americans to get 
vaccinated, the United States has fi-
nally begun to turn the corner against 
the delta variant. Over the past 2 
weeks—2 weeks—our Nation has seen a 
roughly 25-percent decrease in new 
COVID 
infections. 
Hospitalizations 
have decreased by 20 percent, and 
deaths are down as well. 
In Illinois, we are proud to support 
the Biden vaccine policy. In fact, some 
of the biggest employers in our State 
were ahead of the curve. In early July, 
Loyola Medicine in Chicago was one of 
the first health systems in America to 
implement the vaccine requirement. In 
August, United Airlines, based in Chi-
cago, announced it would require its 
employees to get vaccinated. 
At the time, skeptics questioned 
whether this would lead to mass res-
ignations or labor shortages. They pre-
dicted chaos. Well, much to the dismay 
of the doomsayers, as of yesterday, 
more than 99 percent of United Air-
lines’ 
employees 
in 
America 
have 
rolled up their sleeves and gotten vac-
cinated. Every major airline in the 
country has followed United’s lead and 
introduced a vaccine requirement. This 
means safer skies for passengers and 
crew members. It is another big step 
back to normal. 
Unfortunately, not everyone is on 
board with this science-driven ap-
proach. Earlier this week, one of my 
colleagues from Wisconsin took the 
floor and made some unfortunate and 
irresponsible 
statements 
about 
the 
safety of coronavirus vaccines. This 
false information, unfortunately, may 
mislead some people. Senator JOHNSON 
decided to bring an argument from a 
Facebook comment section to the floor 
of the Senate. 
So let me say this: More than 700,000 
Americans 
have 
now 
died 
from 
coronavirus. That is more than the 
number of Americans who have died in 
every war since the Civil War com-
bined. 
We have the power to prevent more 
needless deaths from this disease in the 
form of three remarkably safe and ef-
fective vaccines. Fully vaccinated indi-
viduals are 10 times less likely to die 
from COVID, 10 times less likely to be 
hospitalized, and far less likely to 
spread the virus. 
The strong majority of Americans 
agree with President Biden’s actions. 
Importantly, the administration’s vac-
cine mandate is saving lives while also 
providing commonsense exceptions for 
those limited numbers of people who 
have medical or religious reasons. 
The fact is, the President’s vaccine 
policy 
is 
constitutional, 
evidence- 
based, and it is what America needs to 
once and for all put this pandemic be-
hind us. 
Still, some of our colleagues con-
tinue to oppose it. 
Yesterday, the senior Senator from 
Utah once again introduced legislation 
that would do away with the Presi-
dent’s vaccine policy. It would also 
allow anyone to sue the government or 
their employers for any perceived harm 
from vaccine requirements. What that 
harm might be is unclear. 
Can you imagine the chaos in our 
courtrooms if the Senator from Utah 
has his way? Well, you don’t have to 
imagine too hard because some States 
have already shown us the deadly cost 
of taking a stand against public health. 
There are several States in our coun-
try that both threaten to sue the Biden 
administration and enact the policies 
on their own to ban vaccine and mask 
mandates. They include Texas, Florida, 
Utah, Arkansas, South Carolina, and 
Georgia. The leaders in these States 
have gone to extraordinary lengths to 
stymie public health efforts to save 
lives. 
How has that worked out for these 
States? What has this dangerous, dead-
ly policy of opposing vaccines and 
masks meant in those States? 
Take a look at the map here. 
This was the deadly cost of resisting 
science and vaccines between July 1 of 
this year and October 1. Of the 6 
States—Texas, Florida, Utah, Arizona, 
South Carolina, and Georgia—their in-
fection rates per 100,000 people was 
4,441 compared to the rest of the coun-
try at 2,548 per 100,000. The death rate, 
sadly, was 54 per 100,000 in these 6 
States, 20 in the rest of the country. 
I bring this chart to the floor to 
make it clear that taking a political 
position is not about polling and decid-
ing what sounds popular to so many 
people. It is about the life-and-death 
reality we face with this virus and this 
pandemic. 
These leaders are arguing for a posi-
tion 
against 
vaccines 
and 
against 
masks, and look who is paying the 
price: the men and women who live in

their States, who are facing higher in-
fection rates and, sadly, dramatically 
higher death rates because of it. It is 
time for them to accept the reality 
that vaccines are safe and effective and 
that they work. 
These States have reported almost 
twice as many coronavirus infections 
as the rest of the country and, trag-
ically, nearly three times as many 
deaths. Lawmakers in these States 
have chosen a political course rather 
than one that makes common sense or 
cares for the well-being of their people. 
Our Nation’s healthcare professionals 
are exhausted. You would be, too, if 
you had to battle the virus every day 
for 18 months. Now they are threatened 
with another deadly public health cri-
sis: COVID disinformation from politi-
cians. 
Doctors 
and 
nurses 
and 
healthcare workers are being threat-
ened by the virus, and the patients, 
sadly, who carry it or those who don’t 
believe COVID even exists. 
What makes this all the more trou-
bling is that some of the biggest ped-
dlers of disinformation about vaccines 
have taken steps to protect themselves 
from the coronavirus. 
Allow me to give you exhibit A. 
Nearly every night, Tucker Carlson 
appears on FOX News and distributes 
bogus information to hundreds of thou-
sands of households across America. 
Tucker Carlson is the biggest anti-vax 
quack in America. 
But while Tucker is quick to ques-
tion the science behind masks and vac-
cines, what he won’t tell you is that, 
every day, he has to comply with a vac-
cine policy at FOX News. That is right. 
FOX News requires every one of its em-
ployees to disclose their vaccination 
status. According to ABC News, more 
than 90 percent of FOX Network’s em-
ployees have been vaccinated. The re-
maining 10 percent are required to get 
tested every single day. 
Sound familiar, the FOX policy? It is 
the same thing Joe Biden has asked for 
nationwide 
that 
many 
Republicans 
come to the floor and scream about 
every day and then turn on FOX News 
for their information. 
So, while there is little ideological 
overlap between the heads of FOX 
News and the officials in the Biden ad-
ministration, they both recognize one 
undeniable truth: Vaccine mandates 
are the key to ending this pandemic. 
I thank President Biden for showing 
the world that Chicago is leading the 
way in putting the pandemic behind us. 
If we want to save lives, jump-start the 
economy, get kids back in school, all I 
can say is three words: Follow the 
science; stop villainizing public health 
officials; and start encouraging every 
American to do their part in, finally, 
ending this pandemic.

INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose, of 
course, the Democrats’ reckless tax- 
and-spending bill. I have been coming 
to the floor to talk about this—the 
wasted taxes, the spending, all of the 
sorts of things the Democrats are try-
ing to do. 
You know, right now, the Democrats 
are pushing a Big Government, social-
ist agenda. There can be no question 
about it. They want additional, perma-
nent welfare programs. They want to— 
to me, this bankrupts current pro-
grams, like Medicare. It takes—it is 
very hard to think about this amount 
of spending without realizing the risk 
that it proves for Social Security. And, 
of course, the Democrats are proposing 
this big green new disaster. 
For all this spending, what do they 
want to do? 
Well, they want to raise taxes by tril-
lions and trillions of dollars. But it is 
still not enough to pay for all of the 
spending that they want to do. 
That is why Democrats are now 
working and pushing this backdoor tax 
increase. Democrats want to supersize 
the least accountable and most power-
ful Agency of the Federal Government. 
And that, of course, is the Internal 
Revenue Service. 
Now, what we know about this Agen-
cy, the IRS, is that they have, time and 
time again, proven they can’t be even 
trusted to properly secure data, when 
we look at the leaks that come out of 
the IRS. 
But they are looking for more data 
and more information, private infor-
mation, private business by American 
taxpayers. 
Democrats are asking, in this $3.5 
trillion bill, $80 billion of additional 
funding for the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. They want to give the IRS enough 
money and power to hire a full new 
army of bureaucrats.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6955 
October 7, 2021 
President Biden’s Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen has been very clear. She 
knows what she wants to do with some 
of the money. She wants to force banks 
to tell the IRS every time anyone 
writes or deposits a check above a cer-
tain amount in their banking account, 
checking account. And right now, the 
number that she is talking about is 
$600—$600 for a check written or depos-
ited. So every time someone pays the 
rent, deposits a paycheck, Democrats 
want the IRS to know about it. 
Not enough to know that government 
knows how much people make; they 
want to know how much they spend. It 
is Big Brother initiative to squeeze 
every last penny out of working fami-
lies. 
I mean, why else would they want to 
go after every hard-working man and 
woman in America to find out this in-
formation? 
As Americans find out about that, 
they are furious. They are smart 
enough to know that when Joe Biden 
first says we are only going to tax the 
billionaires—they are only going to tax 
the billionaires—why are they looking 
into the banking accounts and the 
checking accounts and the deposits and 
the withdrawals of people all across the 
country? 
Because the tax man is coming for 
them as well when it comes to trying 
to pay for this massive tax-and-spend-
ing blowout. 
So as more and more people find out 
about it, the more furious they be-
come. I got a report again this morn-
ing, 488 more emails and letters into 
Wyoming Senate—Senator from Wyo-
ming about that from my home State. 
I have received more calls, more 
emails, more letters from people from 
Wyoming on this one topic than on any 
one topic that I can recall in the time 
that I have been in the U.S. Senate. 
And everyone calling and writing 
about it has the same position. It is not 
like, well, half of the people are for it 
and half of the people are against it. 
Everybody is against this. Everyone we 
have heard from—the 488 that I heard 
from within the last 24 hours—every-
one is against this proposal. Thousands 
and thousands of emails. 
I talked to Senator LUMMIS, the 
other Senator from Wyoming. Her 
inbox is completely full as well, all re-
lated to this topic. It is what I heard 
about in the grocery store this past 
weekend at home in Wyoming. 
This new scheme will be terrible, and 
not just for the taxpayers. It is going 
be a heavy weight around the neck of 
the 
community 
banks 
and 
credit 
unions in Wyoming. 
I talked to one of the bankers from 
Wyoming. She was in the grocery store 
getting food for the weekend. What did 
she—it was the only—it was the thing 
she wanted to talk about, is the fact 
they would have to hire three new em-
ployees to comply with all of the regu-
lations coming out that would relate to 
trying to get this information from 
their bank to the IRS. 
In addition, this would be quite an 
attack on our privacy. This Big Broth-
er scheme would make bankers and 
credit union associates into de facto 
IRS agents. 
And as this bank officer said to me, 
she said: Look, I don’t want—I am not 
going to be working for the IRS. I work 
for my customers, my clients, the peo-
ple of Wyoming. The last thing I want 
to do is be somebody reporting into the 
IRS. 
This is what I am hearing from bank-
ers all around the State of Wyoming. 
They don’t want to be invading peo-
ple’s privacy. They don’t want to be-
come agents of the IRS. 
People in Wyoming have a straight-
forward response to this administra-
tion, and it is this: Leave us alone. We 
don’t need you looking over our shoul-
der, prying into our life and our activi-
ties. 
If Democrats go forward with this 
Big Brother plan, the people all across 
this country will not stand for it. Many 
people in Wyoming will look for alter-
natives to traditional banks and credit 
unions because they don’t want the 
IRS and the government and Big 
Brother to know their personal activi-
ties. They want to protect their pri-
vacy. They may find other places to 
put their money. 
Look, that is going to devastate local 
banks, local credit unions, if people 
take their money out because they 
don’t want the government boring into 
their data and their financial trans-
actions. 
It is going to happen in every State. 
Hard to believe the government would 
want to do that, but yet Secretary 
Yellen came to Capitol Hill, and that is 
what she is doing. She is still defending 
this indefensible idea; and I believe she 
is doing it because that is what Joe 
Biden, the President of the United 
States, is telling her to do as his Treas-
ury Secretary. 
So she went on television Tuesday— 
today is Thursday—2 days ago, essen-
tially said it was no big deal. That is 
what the Treasury Secretary of the 
United States believes, that violating 
the individual privacy of individuals of 
this country is no big deal. 
Last week, Senator LUMMIS from Wy-
oming questioned Secretary Yellen be-
fore the Banking Committee. Sec-
retary Yellen, actually astonishingly, 
doubled down. She said, ‘‘I think you 
misunderstand the proposal.’’ She said, 
‘‘The IRS already has a wealth of infor-
mation about individuals.’’ 
Well, Madam Secretary, we under-
stand that really well. We know you 
have a wealth of information about in-
dividual taxpayers. You know how 
much they make. You know how they 
make it. That is enough. If you have 
all this, you don’t need more, but yet 
you are asking for more, and you want 
$80 billion for an army of IRS agents to 
be able to find it out. That is the prob-
lem. The IRS has so much information 
about us already. 
Now, Senator LUMMIS did get Sec-
retary Yellen to admit working fami-
lies are not the ones skimping out on 
their taxes. Why else do we have this 
army of IRS agents looking into our 
taxes? Secretary Yellen didn’t seem to 
care. She doubled down, still defending 
this massive invasion of privacy, and 
that is what it is. It is a huge invasion 
of privacy, and I contend that they 
want all this information so they can 
try to squeeze more money from people 
who the Secretary even admits are not 
trying to cheat on their taxes. They 
are trying to find ways to take more 
money out of their pocketbooks, when 
they are already feeling the big bite of 
Joe Biden’s inflation at the gas pump 
and at the grocery store. 
This Big Brother plan is reckless. It 
treats the American people like crimi-
nals. It turns the IRS into the judge, 
the jury, and the lord high executioner. 
This scheme shows how 
desperate 
Democrats are to get their hands on 
taxpayer money. Why? So they can 
spend more. They are so desperate for 
more spending that they are willing to 
spy on the American people to try to 
get more money to spend. 
Watch and listen to the Democrats 
talk. There is a food fight going on, 
and the food fight is: How much more 
can we tax and how much more can we 
spend? It is a food fight between the 
really big spenders and the extremely 
big spenders. Look, Democrats think 
that Washington knows best. Now, the 
people of Wyoming know differently. 
We don’t need Washington looking over 
our shoulders. It is time for Democrats 
to drop the entire plan, mind their own 
business, and stop demanding more 
money to spy on the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FLOOD INSURANCE 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today 
is Thursday, October 7, 2021, and Risk 
Rating 2.0 has officially been in effect 
for 6 full days. 
What is Risk Rating 2.0? 
It is a new rating system for the Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program that 
will increase premiums higher than 
sustainable for homeowners and, there-
fore, higher than is sustainable for the 
program. 
In Louisiana, 80 percent of policy-
holders will see increases in the first 
year, and at times, for some, premiums 
will become unaffordable and can col-
lapse the value of their home. The Pre-
siding Officer is also from a coastal 
State. This will absolutely affect ev-
eryone who lives in a coastal State. 
Now, particularly, in my State, in 
light of recent storms, it is important 
that we understand the sustainability 
of the National Flood Insurance Pro-
gram is key.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6956 
October 7, 2021 
Congress never passed a bill requiring 
that FEMA implement Risk Rating 2.0. 
President Biden can stop it. He has 
chosen not to. We have asked that 
FEMA delay implementing this pro-
gram or reconsider it altogether. 
Now, by the way, FEMA has been 
slow to share information with policy-
holders and, frankly, misleading Con-
gress by hiding the true consequences 
of 2.0 and not being up front with the 
cost in the out-years. They said they 
would tell policyholders by August 1 of 
the increase in premiums, but they 
missed the deadline. It didn’t come 
down to homeowners and insurers until 
the middle of September. Some are 
still trying to figure out what this rat-
ing system will mean for their life. 
In 2019, my office reached out to the 
administration, and we were able to 
successfully delay the implementation 
saying that there needed to be further 
consideration. This time, however, the 
Biden administration has chosen not to 
delay it. 
Now, let’s just take a quote from a 
working family in Lake Charles, LA, 
who does not—I repeat—does not live 
in a flood zone. They currently pay $572 
for flood insurance on a single-family 
home that is worth approximately 
$250,000. The quote he received—this is 
real life. This isn’t theoretical. The 
quote that he received under Risk Rat-
ing 2.0 raises his premium to over 
$5,000—$572 to $5,000. 
Now, rate increases are capped at 18 
percent annually, so it doesn’t happen 
next year. But this is 18 percent com-
pounded. It is kind of like a balloon on 
one of those little helium things. It 
starts off and it doesn’t seem that it is 
inflating, and then, all of a sudden, it 
inflates rapidly, like a balloon note on 
a mortgage. 
So with progressive increases, when 
it gets to $5,000—actually, $5,624—he 
will have to choose: Do I continue my 
policy? 
Now, he is not in a flood zone. If you 
think about actuarially, you want peo-
ple who are not at high risk to spread 
the cost for everybody else. 
Under this, the Congressional Budget 
Office estimates that 20 percent of pol-
icyholders will drop their insurance. 
That has a risk of putting the National 
Flood Insurance Program into an actu-
arial death spiral where those at lower 
risk drop the insurance, the remaining 
risk is forced upon a relatively small 
number of people raising their risk 
even more, and you gradually have a 
continual falloff of the number of peo-
ple in the program. 
Now, some policyholders are required 
to pay for the insurance by law, but 
this puts them in an even worse situa-
tion. They will either have to put thou-
sands of dollars up for their insurance 
or risk losing their home. 
I would ask President Biden, who un-
questionably is an empathetic man and 
empathetic to the working families of 
our country, to consider delaying Risk 
Rating 2.0. 
Now, there are a couple of criticisms 
of the flood insurance program, in gen-
eral, which are unfounded. 
First: These are millionaires’ vaca-
tion homes; why do we even have a pro-
gram? 
This is factually not true. When CBO 
looked at samples of home values in 
the program, it ranged from $220- to 
$400,000. And I imagine the President 
from New Jersey—President of the 
Senate from New Jersey—can think of 
a middle-income family, a police offi-
cer and a teacher; who now live in a 
home worth $400,000. These are not mil-
lionaires or billionaires. 
In my home State of Louisiana, these 
are middle-income and working fami-
lies, folks trying to make ends meet. 
They are not folks in a vacation home. 
And here is an example of homes, after 
recent Hurricane Ida, that would need 
flood insurance: middle-income homes. 
By the way, you can see these homes 
are built a little bit on a berm. They 
have actually taken the effort to pro-
tect their homes from flooding. So the 
home itself is not flooded, just every-
thing else around it. On the other hand, 
I can promise you that there are older 
neighborhoods in which the water is 
above the doorstep. 
Now, looking specifically at Risk 
Rating 2.0, data shows who will see the 
rate hikes. It is bad news for Lou-
isiana, where rates will increase for al-
most everybody. 
The second criticism of the program 
is that it subsidizes people who suffer 
repetitive flood damage. Now, this ar-
gument is mitigated, if you will, by of-
fering mitigation. Data shows that 
mitigation is good for the taxpayer. 
According to the National Institute of 
Building Sciences, for every $1 spent in 
Federal mitigation grants, it saves the 
program an average of $6. 
In the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, there is $3.5 billion in flood 
mitigation assistance grants—grants 
going towards buying up properties 
that have experienced repetitive loss. 
Shoring up the program by removing 
high-risk 
properties 
protects 
other 
properties. It is true in your State, and 
it is true in my State. It is a wise in-
vestment to protect the National Flood 
Insurance Program. 
So we can have a conversation, by 
the way, about a criticism that if miti-
gation opportunities are offered to 
homeowners and they decline them, 
what to do about that. On the other 
hand, when folks are offered mitiga-
tion, they almost always accept the op-
portunity for that. 
Finally, some argue that private in-
surers will replace the National Flood 
Insurance Program. But let’s be hon-
est, that will not occur. I support the 
expansion of private insurance cov-
ering 
flood 
properties. 
Consumers 
should have options. If nothing else, 
this highlights the need for a long-term 
fix to the program. 
In the past, I proposed reforms to en-
sure that NFIP is affordable and acces-
sible to homeowners, accountable to 
taxpayers, and sustainable. I worked 
on flood insurance programs with Sen-
ators MENENDEZ and GILLIBRAND, both 
of them coming from States affected 
by flooding, just as mine did as well. 
This makes it bipartisan, two different 
regions. It is not only about the Gulf 
Coast; it is about the Atlantic Coast, 
the Pacific Coast; and it is about our 
island properties. 
By the way, I have been speaking 
about Louisiana, but Risk Rating 2.0 
applies nationwide. It impacts all those 
living on our coasts. Once more, we 
should 
all—all 
of 
us 
representing 
States with coastlines—ask the Biden 
administration to halt Risk Rating 2.0. 
This Congress, I will continue to 
work to reform NFIP. In addition to af-
fordability, 
accessibility, 
account-
ability, and sustainability, there needs 
to be an emphasis on supporting pre-
vention and mitigation efforts to pre-
vent future floods. 
At the end of the day, flood insurance 
must be affordable for the homeowner, 
accessible, accountable to the tax-
payer, and sustainable for the future. 
TRIBUTE TO PASTOR A.R. HARRIS, SR. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a 
moment to honor a man in my State of 
Louisiana, who has dedicated nearly 80 
percent of his life to preaching the gos-
pel and serving others through his 
faith. 
Pastor A.R. Harris, Sr., was born De-
cember 16, 1932, in Jonesboro, LA. He 
has preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
since he was 7 years old and led God’s 
people for over six decades. 
Pastor Harris is a veteran who served 
our country in the United States Army 
during the Korean war. He and his wife 
Eva of 63 years have six wonderful chil-
dren, four of whom followed their fa-
ther’s footsteps to preach the Good 
Word to spread the Gospel. He and Eva 
are being honored for their 46 years of 
service at their church, Zion Hill Mis-
sionary Baptist Church #2. 
He is a man of God, family, and coun-
try; and it is my privilege to stand here 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate and rec-
ognize the faithful service of Pastor 
A.R. Harris, Sr. 
God bless him, his family, and God 
bless the United States of America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2953 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
you know, it is no secret that I oppose 
President Biden’s tax proposal. I think 
it is bad policy that would undercut 
growth and derail American prosperity. 
But one of the worst parts of the 
President’s plan is the provision re-
quiring financial institutions to report 
their customer’s transactions of $600 or 
greater to the IRS. 
That means anytime an American 
pays a bill, makes a deposit, transfers 
funds, or makes a purchase of $600 or 
more, their bank, credit union, or fi-
nancial institution would be forced to 
report that data to the IRS. 
Opposition to this proposal is deep 
and bipartisan. I don’t care if you are a

Republican, Democrat, or Independent. 
No one wants the IRS looking over 
their shoulder every time they make a 
financial transaction. The IRS doesn’t 
efficiently use the data it collects now. 
Why in the world would we give them 
more information? 
If the IRS has reason to believe you 
are not paying all that you owe in 
taxes, they have the ability to audit 
you. They don’t need any more private 
financial data on any of us. The bulk of 
the data collection they are proposing 
will do nothing to close the so-called 
tax gap. All it does is violate the lib-
erty of every freedom-loving American 
who values their financial property. 
The proposal would dramatically in-
crease IRS audits of working Ameri-
cans. The overwhelming majority of 
people the IRS would look into as a re-
sult of this policy would not have done 
a single thing wrong, but when the IRS 
starts snooping, it will cost you big 
money. That means hiring a high- 
priced attorney/accountant who will 
bleed you dry. 
President Biden claims his proposal 
would only impact the rich, but mid-
dle-class families are the ones who will 
ultimately pay the price. 
Additionally, the IRS has a history 
of data security failures. Just earlier 
this year, the confidential tax informa-
tion of over a dozen well-known Ameri-
cans leaked from the Agency and was 
published in the press. That was unac-
ceptable and unlawful, but nothing was 
done to hold the IRS accountable. 
But this is, unfortunately, nothing 
new. Under President Biden’s watch, 
when he was Vice President, conserv-
ative groups and individuals were tar-
geted for aggressive audits. And as re-
cently as this year, a Texas-based char-
ity was denied tax-exempt status be-
cause the IRS considered the charity 
too close to Republicans and too close 
to Christianity. 
Folks, that is pitiful. 
Providing the IRS with massive 
amounts of financial-transaction data 
will only make it easier for them to 
target groups or individuals they dis-
agree with. If anything, we need to be 
reining in the IRS and holding officials 
accountable who go after taxpayers for 
political reasons. 
The outcry from voters has been 
strong and swift. Some of my Demo-
crat colleagues are feeling the heat 
from their constituents and are start-
ing to walk back the President’s pro-
posal. The American people have them 
on the run. 
Democrats in Congress are talking 
about only requiring transactions of 
only $10,000 or more to be reported to 
the IRS. While fewer Americans would 
be directly impacted by this threshold, 
we would still feel the broader, nega-
tive effects. 
That being said, on Tuesday of this 
week, 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Janet 
Yellen, the President’s top economic 
adviser, defended the Biden plan and 
doubled down on the $600 IRS proposal. 
Regardless of whether Democrats set-
tle on $600 or $10,000 threshold, every 
American would suffer. That is because 
our 
community 
banks 
and 
credit 
unions will be overwhelmed—I mean 
overwhelmed—with a tidal wave of 
compliance data. Small banks and 
credit unions won’t be able to afford to 
hire the staff that they are going to 
need, forcing them to close their doors 
in a lot of rural and minority areas. 
And for Americans, including many 
minorities, living in rural communities 
across the country, these small banks 
and credit unions are a focal point for 
the community. They provide the 
money folks need to buy their first 
home or car; they fuel the economic de-
velopment, provide good-paying jobs, 
and pump resources back into these 
rural communities. 
If these community banks and credit 
unions close, it would cut off access to 
capital for millions of Americans in 
communities. They would suffer. Live-
lihoods would be destroyed. 
That is why I, along with my col-
league from Florida, Senator RICK 
SCOTT, have introduced a bill prohib-
iting the IRS from creating, imple-
menting, or administering a financial 
reporting regime that would require fi-
nancial institutions or individuals to 
report data or financial transactions or 
account balances to the IRS. 
To be clear, my legislation does not 
touch the Bank Secrecy Act or any of 
the regulations either implemented or 
issued under that act. 
My bill has been endorsed by the 
American Bankers Association, the 
Independent Community Bankers of 
America, the National Association of 
Federally-Insured Credit Unions, the 
Credit Union National Association, the 
Heritage 
Action 
for 
America, 
the 
League of Southeastern Credit Unions, 
and the Alabama Bankers Association. 
These organizations and their members 
know that if President Biden’s proposal 
goes through, banking, as we know it, 
will end. 
At this time, I would like to yield the 
floor to my distinguished colleague 
from Florida, Mr. SCOTT. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Senator 
TUBERVILLE for leading this very im-
portant effort. 
I want to be very clear. What Presi-
dent Biden is proposing here is as close 
to policy from communist China as we 
have seen in the United States. In op-
pressive regimes like Cuba and com-
munist China, we have come to expect 
a surveillance state where the govern-
ment has access to every part of a per-
son’s life. Now Joe Biden wants to 
bring that here to America. 
Let me explain what the Biden ad-
ministration and Democrats in Wash-
ington are proposing. Democrats want 
to open your bank account to Federal 
agents. Under Joe Biden’s America, the 
Federal Government’s authority would 
be vastly expanded so the IRS can get 
a look at any account over $600. The 
madness doesn’t stop there. This new 
rule from Joe Biden would also require 
banks to report every transaction of 
$600 or more. Does anyone honestly 
think the Federal Government will 
keep your private information safe? 
Want to buy a bed? Here comes the 
Federal Government. But say you want 
to buy a new shotgun. Hunting season 
is coming up. Again, here come the 
feds. How about giving money to your 
favorite charities; supporting a cause 
or a political candidate you care about; 
for childcare or paying for mental 
health counseling? Perhaps you are 
just selling off a little furniture and 
want to put your profits in a savings 
account. For every one of these trans-
actions I have just described, the gov-
ernment is going to come take a look. 
Every American should be disgusted 
and furious by this insane overreach of 
the Federal Government. Think about 
the private, personal information the 
government would have access to. It is 
incredibly intrusive, and Joe Biden 
wants to make it nearly limitless. 
Again, does anyone honestly think the 
Federal Government would keep your 
private information safe? I understand 
that families are angry. I have heard 
from more than 18,000 constituents 
over just the last 2 weeks about how 
disgusted they are with this plan. 
Biden wants to expand the surveil-
lance state of the Federal Government 
to target every American family. Nine-
ty-five percent of American households 
have a bank account, and this policy 
will have impacts on every single one 
of those accountholders. But it is not 
just banks; Joe Biden is expanding the 
Federal surveillance state to monitor 
your finances across the board. They 
will be watching your local credit 
union and your PayPal and Venmo ac-
counts. They will even be watching to 
see 
how 
you 
spend 
and 
earn 
cryptocurrency. This is an outrageous 
violation of Americans’ privacy. 
I think the Democrats are also hear-
ing from their constituents. Recent re-
ports say the President and Democrats 
in the House are looking at raising the 
threshold from $600 to $10,000. That 
would still hit many Americans fami-
lies. 
We are not just talking about check-
ing accounts; this applies to savings, 
retirement, and investment accounts. 
You name it, the feds want to take a 
look. 
Again, I am not describing something 
in Cuba or communist China; I am 
talking about what Joe Biden and the 
Democrats want to do right here in the 
U.S.A. I can’t wait for my Democratic 
colleague to explain why President 
Biden is even proposing this. How can 
you possibly justify to the American 
people that the IRS should be snooping 
around in their bank, retirement, or in-
vestment accounts? 
There is only one explanation, and it 
is simply terrifying. The Democrats 
want to control how you spend your 
money. Democrats want to control 
your expenditures, your charitable and

political giving, and your investments. 
The more power Democrats can grab 
from American families, the more con-
trol they think they will get over each 
and every American. 
This all boils down to Joe Biden and 
the radical left bringing the American 
people under the thumb of his socialist 
tax-and-spend agenda. After all, how 
else is he going to be able to squeeze 
every last penny out of American fami-
lies’ bank accounts to pay for his so-
cialist plans? 
Here is how the Democratic Party 
works: They refuse to audit our Fed-
eral Agencies that year after year send 
billions in improper payments to the 
wrong people, which they rarely ever 
recover. They refuse to hold their gov-
ernment accountable for reckless waste 
and massive debt. But they want to put 
the magnifying glass on hard-working 
families who are just trying to live 
their dreams. 
Under Biden’s socialist regime, it is 
rules for thee but not for me. How is 
that different from communist China, 
where the government lives in opulence 
while their citizens live totally depend-
ent on the government in poverty? 
I will not stand for this outrageous 
plan. No American should tolerate this 
unprecedented overreach. I am proud 
to support Senator TUBERVILLE’s legis-
lation and hope every one of my col-
leagues looks at this for what it is: 
communist 
China-style 
totalitarian 
surveillance. 
I yield back to Senator TUBERVILLE. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. I would like to 
yield the floor to my distinguished col-
league from Indiana, Senator BRAUN. 
Mr. BRAUN. Thank you, Senator 
TUBERVILLE. 
Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Every year, I travel and 
visit every county in the State of Indi-
ana—92 of them. You know, I can’t ever 
recall anyone saying that they want 
the IRS to poke into their business 
more on a day-to-day basis. In fact, 
they bemoan the fact that many years 
ago, the IRS was actually sifting 
through stuff to determine who was 
conservative or not before they might 
grant status to your entity. 
We have gotten to a point—and I 
think Senators TUBERVILLE and SCOTT 
have eloquently laid out the details. I 
want to take a little different ap-
proach. 
I have been here a little less than 3 
years, 
and 
this 
kind 
of 
entrepreneurialism 
through 
govern-
ment, growing the Federal Govern-
ment, having an Agency like the IRS 
that can’t do its job well with the 
money that we do give to it, is just an-
other example of trying to pile on one 
bad thing after another. 
It would be different if we weren’t 
doing it borrowing 23 percent of the 
money we spend every year. Imagine 
that in your own household, in a State 
or local government, a business. You 
would be laughed out of the banker’s 
office if you did that and then wanted 
a loan to cover it and then do it the 
next 10 years. It doesn’t work anywhere 
else. 
This is an example that I think, 
along with maybe the vaccine man-
date, where you are now forcing small 
businesses to do something when they 
finally got a rhythm—and businesses 
have protected their employees and 
their customers as well as anybody out 
there in that journey. You have got 
that nonsense that is going to be un-
furled here soon. But it is an example 
of where, at some point, enough needs 
to be enough. 
The IRS has had a poor record of 
doing 
things 
to 
boot. 
Earlier, 
ProPublica released illegally obtained 
tax records of many Americans. We had 
the incident of issues with conservative 
businesses being discriminated against 
in getting proper status set up. I intro-
duced the Protect Taxpayer Privacy 
Act in June for that because the IRS is 
already 
doing 
things 
that 
they 
shouldn’t be doing. This would be a 
perfect companion to what Senator 
TUBERVILLE is putting out here. 
To wrap it up, we have to be careful 
when we send people here. If you were 
knocking it out of the park, delivering 
results, not borrowing money to do the 
things we try to do anyway, and then 
you tee up something like this—this is 
going to do nothing more than unleash 
more of an Agency that doesn’t do well 
in its job anyway, and it is truly an ex-
ample of government gone wild. 
I thank Senator TUBERVILLE
for 
bringing this to a focal point. 
I yield back to him. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator BRAUN and Sen-
ator SCOTT again for supporting this 
bill. 
I am proud to partner with him in 
this effort to safeguard the financial 
privacy of American citizens. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 2953, which is at the 
desk. I further ask that the bill be con-
sidered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and col-
leagues, the Senator’s proposal in ef-
fect would be a game-winning touch-
down for wealthy tax cheats. 
IRS Commissioner Rettig, a Repub-
lican appointee, came before the Fi-
nance Committee earlier this year and 
said the total amount of taxes evaded 
each year could be as high as $1 tril-
lion. Cheating by those at the very top 
is one of the major causes of that huge 
tax gap. A big reason why is that the 
automatic reporting and strict rules 
that apply to the typical, hard-working 
taxpayer—nurses and firefighters, for 
example—they don’t always apply to 
those at the top. That means the tax 
cheats are able to hide their cheating 
in the shadows. 
The Senator’s proposal would help 
them keep it that way. This proposal 
would make it extraordinarily difficult 
to collect the information necessary to 
crack down on the high-flying tax 
cheats. 
The argument against information 
reporting is always the same, and it 
has been consistently wrong. Despite 
what opponents say, what President 
Biden and Democrats have proposed is 
focused on rooting out tax cheating at 
the top. It wouldn’t apply to accounts 
with deposits and withdrawals under 
$10,000. And for most people, that is 
$10,000 on top of your paycheck. It is 
not 
about 
anybody’s 
transactions. 
They wouldn’t be reported, colleagues. 
It wouldn’t create any new surveillance 
of digital currency. This information- 
reporting proposal is about reporting 
only two numbers: the total amount 
going into an account and the total 
amount going out of it. Social Security 
income does not count either. 
So this idea—and I have listened to 
my friends—that somehow this is going 
to end Western civilization just doesn’t 
hold up. 
In fact, Commissioner Rettig, a Re-
publican appointee, pointed out re-
cently that this plan could actually re-
duce the odds of an audit for middle- 
class taxpayers, those folks that I was 
talking about, the nurses and the fire-
fighters. 
I am going to close with just a couple 
of other points. Most of my colleagues 
know that I am about as strong a pri-
vacy hawk as there is in the Senate. 
And I don’t take a backseat to anybody 
when it comes to fighting for Ameri-
cans’ privacy, whether it is taxpayer 
data, communications, web traffic— 
you name it. And, colleagues, all of 
that work, all of that private work, is 
on the public record. It is a matter of 
public record. It isn’t an atomic secret. 
In those debates about privacy, it is 
also striking that it is most often 
Members of the other side attempting 
to stop reforms, for example, to gov-
ernment surveillance of phone records 
and emails and web browsing—web 
browsing. But when Democrats are 
working 
to 
crack 
down 
on 
ultrawealthy tax cheats, that is when, 
suddenly, we have got Republicans say-
ing: Oh, my goodness; who is going to 
be sensitive to privacy? 
I want to repeat, as I have on this 
floor again and again, I will talk to 
anybody on either side of the aisle with 
any philosophy about protecting tax-
payer data. As the chairman of the

October 7, 2021 
Senate Finance Committee, which han-
dles privacy policy, I want it under-
stood that our committee—and I, par-
ticularly, given my record on privacy 
issues—we take privacy very seriously. 
That is not what is on offer by the 
other side today. The bottom line is 
wealthy tax cheats are ripping off the 
American people to the tune of billions 
and billions of dollars per year. Tax 
cheats thrive when the reporting rules 
that apply to them are loose and 
murky. Democrats want to fix this bro-
ken approach and crack down on cheat-
ing at the top. The Senator’s proposal 
would make that impossible, and it 
would hand—colleagues, it would hand, 
the Senator’s proposal—a big fourth- 
quarter victory to the tax cheats. 
For that reason, I object. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
this is a simple two-page bill that will 
protect every American from an inva-
sion of privacy by Big Brother Govern-
ment IRS. I am sorry to see that my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
oppose 
pro-
tecting the financial privacy of Amer-
ican taxpayers. That is a real shame. 
I think you would be hard-pressed to 
find a Member of the U.S. Senate who 
can honestly say that a majority of 
their constituents support President 
Biden’s proposal for the IRS to monitor 
a $600 or more transaction. I don’t 
think you could find one. 
We ought to be able to stand up to-
gether, in a bipartisan fashion, to re-
ject this radical proposal. I am con-
fident that the American people will 
continue to put pressure on their elect-
ed representatives to reject this plan. I 
will work with my colleagues to ad-
dress legitimate concerns, though I 
suspect there are none, and any posi-
tion is going to be purely political. 
Americans across the country can 
count on Senator SCOTT and myself to 
keep up the fight of this important 
issue. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5323 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
we have reached a really important 
point in our relationship with one of 
our great allies in the world. The 
United States has before it the chal-
lenge—and this Congress can meet that 
challenge—for $1 billion of supple-
mental security assistance to replenish 
Israel’s Iron Dome system. 
That funding is provided in H.R. 5323, 
the Iron Dome Supplemental Appro-
priations Act of 2022, passed by the 
House of Representatives by an over-
whelming—and 
I 
emphasize 
‘‘over-
whelming’’—bipartisan support. 
I want to thank my Connecticut col-
league ROSA DELAURO of New Haven 
for her leadership and all of the Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives 
for their vision and courage in sepa-
rating this measure and passing it. And 
we should do so now, as quickly as pos-
sible. 
All of us know that the 2016 memo-
randum of understanding negotiated 
between Israel and the United States 
provides $500 million per year in secu-
rity assistance for Israel’s missile de-
fense. The MOU allows Israel to re-
quest additional funds to replenish and 
restore missile defense capabilities in 
exceptional circumstances. 
We all remember vividly the May 2021 
conflict between Israel and Hamas, and 
in our minds still vividly and graphi-
cally are the pictures of that Iron 
Dome 
system 
intercepting 
missiles 
aimed at civilians in Israel. The Iron 
Dome defense system intercepted about 
90 percent of those potentially lethal 
missiles targeting populated areas of 
Israel. 
In total, about 4,400 rockets were 
launched by Hamas. Should the Iron 
Dome have failed, countless Israeli ci-
vilians would have been killed. This 
system performed with such extraor-
dinary and exceptional prowess, show-
ing its necessity for both humanitarian 
and defensive purposes. 
I recently returned from a trip to 
Israel, where I talked to the top leader-
ship of the new government, including 
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. I was 
inspired and excited by the determina-
tion of the Israeli leadership and, I be-
lieve, the Israeli people to inaugurate a 
new era where we are even closer to 
Israel than we have been in the past. 
There have been some bumps in the 
road; there have been some potential 
disagreements in this body; but we 
should focus on making sure that 
Israel’s defense is completely bipar-
tisan; that our relationship with Israel 
crosses party lines. We have that op-
portunity today to renew the sense of 
bipartisanship in our unshakeable rela-
tionship with Israel. 
And that relationship goes beyond 
just security concerns. We are bound 
by culture, heritage, faith, and a com-
mon commitment to democracy. And 
Israel has that commitment in perhaps 
the most constantly dangerous neigh-
borhood in the world. 
Iron Dome is a defensive system. It is 
solely defensive, and it defends against 
the loss of civilians on both sides, in 
Gaza as well as Israel, because the loss 
of life in Israel, if it occurs, if Iron 
Dome is lacking, will lead to escalating 
violence that will cost lives in Gaza as 
well. 
The Iron Dome prevents escalating 
hostilities that will cost lives among 
both Palestinians and Israelis. So its 
defensive value is indisputable, and 
that is why it does have bipartisan sup-
port here. It has the President’s sup-
port. He stated: 
We’re also going to discuss Israel’s unwav-
ering—unwavering 
commitment 
that 
we 
have in the United States to Israel’s secu-
rity. And I fully, fully, fully support replen-
ishing Israel’s Iron Dome system. 
A quote from his meeting prior to 
meeting with Prime Minister Bennett 
at the White House. 
Just 2 days before he made those re-
marks, Secretary Austin also expressed 
his support: 
You can also see that commitment as we 
advocate for the replenishment of the Iron 
Dome missile defense system. The adminis-
tration is committed to ensuring that Iron 
Dome can defend Israeli civilian population 
centers targeted by terrorist attacks, and 
we’re working closely with Congress to pro-
vide all the necessary information to respond 
positively to your request for the—for $1 bil-
lion in emergency funding, and it’s going to 
save more innocent lives. 
I am concerned that Members of the 
U.S. Senate are blocking passage of 
this bill. Senator PAUL has demanded 
that we add unrelated language to re-
scind funds from the Department of 
State and the Department of Defense 
before he will agree to a unanimous 
consent decree. We should prevent this 
sacred relationship from becoming a 
political football. We should make sure 
that we preserve it as a bipartisan 
source of consensus. 
And that is not to say necessarily 
that we agree with every single act, 
every single measure that our Israeli 
allies take. We can be friends and fam-
ily and still disagree. 
But our aid should not be conditioned 
on agreeing with every single policy or 
action taken by our Israeli friends. 
This measure is a defensive platform 
that saves lives. It is a humanitarian 
step that should be regarded for what 
it is—essential to our alliance, our re-
lationship, and our bond with Israel. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that, at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader, following consultation with 
the Republican leader, the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of Calendar 
No. 140, H.R. 5323; that there be up to 2 
hours of debate; that upon the use or 
yielding back of time, the bill be con-
sidered read a third time, and the Sen-
ate vote on passage of the bill, without 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I agree with the 
Senator from Connecticut that we 
should pass the proposal. In fact, I have 
offered a proposal to fund the Iron 
Dome with $1 billion that should be 
paid for, though. We are facing a $30 
trillion debt. We borrow $2 million a 
minute. Inflation is rising. They are 
wanting to pile more debt upon our 
country. So, if we are going to help our 
ally Israel, I think we need to be strong 
to do it, we need to be not piling on 
debt without consequences, and this 
should be paid for. 
There is a very easy pay-for that I 
have proposed. There is $6 billion left 
in a reconstruction fund for the Afghan 
national government. Well, the Afghan

October 7, 2021 
national government no longer exists. 
In the haste to leave, the Biden admin-
istration has let the Taliban overrun 
the country. 
So I asked the other day, in com-
mittee, of Secretary Blinken: This $6 
billion, are you planning on giving it to 
the Taliban? 
And he said: Well, it depends on 
whether they fulfill their commit-
ments. 
To me, that sounds like a pretty big 
‘‘if,’’ but if the Biden administration 
says that they fulfill their commit-
ment and expectations, the under-
standing is the Biden administration is 
going to give $6 billion to the Taliban. 
So, not only do they let them take 
$80 billion of equipment, not only did 
we leave in complete disarray, Demo-
crats now want to say: Oh, we have got 
to keep this money because we have to 
give it to the Taliban. 
That is obscene. 
We should immediately rescind all of 
that money. If you want to give money 
to Afghanistan, let’s vote on it again. 
But you gave the money to the pre-
vious government, and now you want 
to give the money to the Taliban, 
which has overrun the country. It is a 
disgrace. The Taliban shouldn’t get a 
penny. And we should pay for things, 
even for things that we are trying to 
give to allies. 
So I have a proposal before the desk. 
My proposal says to fully fund the $1 
billion for the Iron Dome project. Fully 
fund it. We have already given billions 
for it. We are willing to give $1 billion 
more, but we are going to pay for it by 
not giving money to the Taliban. So it 
is a pretty easy sort of list. We asked 
every Senator on the Republican side if 
they objected to this, and not one Re-
publican objected to this. So the reason 
the Iron Dome is being held up is be-
cause the Democrats are objecting to 
its being paid for. 
I am here today to support the Iron 
Dome. I am giving a proposal that 
would give them their $1 billion right 
now. It could happen today. All I ask is 
that it be paid for with money that has 
already been appropriated and that is, 
in all likelihood, going to be given to 
the Taliban if we don’t take it away 
now. I think it is a very reasonable 
proposal. 
I am disappointed that the Demo-
crats are objecting to Iron Dome today. 
It is a disappointment that they are 
against paying for it with a fund that 
is already out there, and that they so 
much love the idea of giving the money 
to the Taliban that they are going to 
insist on blocking Iron Dome funding 
because they are insistent on ‘‘No, no, 
we can’t get rid of the $6 billion be-
cause, if the Taliban behaves, we are 
going to give it to them.’’ 
Look, I don’t care if the Taliban be-
haves. I wouldn’t give them a penny. 
There are other ways of trying to have 
a diplomatic relationship other than 
giving money to people. People think 
that somehow, if the Taliban behaves, 
we have got to give them money? I 
think that is a crazy notion. 
So, without question, I will object. 
I ask the Senator to modify his re-
quest so that, instead of his proposal 
and as in legislative session, the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; 
further, that the only amendment in 
order be my substitute amendment, 
which is at the desk. I further ask that 
there be 2 hours of debate, equally di-
vided between the two leaders, and 
that upon the use or yielding back of 
that time, the Paul substitute amend-
ment at the desk be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time, and that 
the Senate vote on passage of the bill, 
as amended, with no intervening action 
or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
in reserving the right to object, let’s 
set the record straight. 
There is no possibility of this money 
or any other money going to the 
Taliban. Section 9021 of the fiscal year 
2021 Defense Appropriations Act—we 
all voted for it—makes funding the 
Taliban illegal, and if any Pentagon of-
ficial breaks that law, they could go to 
jail under the Antideficiency Act. 
Whatever the Secretary of State may 
have answered to Senator PAUL’s ques-
tion at a hearing, we should know and 
he should know that spending money 
in any way that enables it to go to the 
Taliban would be breaking the law, and 
he would have to come to Congress to 
use any of that money to aid the 
Taliban. So this is a false issue. 
The funds that the Paul amendment 
seeks to rescind have actually not yet 
been appropriated. He targets the $3.3 
billion in the fiscal year 2022 request. 
You can’t rescind funds that haven’t 
yet been appropriated. So the amend-
ment falls of its own weight, but I want 
to deal with the merits. 
No. 1, the Paul amendment seeks to 
rescind funds from the Department of 
Defense’s 
Afghan 
Security 
Forces 
Fund. Those funds are still needed to 
complete the withdrawal. They are in 
an account that is urgently needed to 
terminate contracts that are already in 
place and secure military equipment 
that has been withdrawn from Afghani-
stan. 
All of the complaints about the with-
drawal and all of the complaints about 
the need to secure that military equip-
ment 
are 
met 
by 
this 
funding. 
Defunding the Pentagon in this way 
will, in fact, disrupt the shutdown of 
these activities and open the United 
States to legal action from contrac-
tors. I have been advised, for those rea-
sons, that the Department of Defense 
strongly opposes the Paul amendment 
because it makes ending the war in Af-
ghanistan more difficult. 
Let me just close by saying that 
there is a need for humanitarian sup-
port in areas where the Palestinians 
live. There is a need for aid for water 
treatment and vaccines and health and 
all of the needs—humanitarian needs— 
of the Palestinian people. 
One of the encouraging parts of my 
visit with the Israeli leadership was 
their recognition that Israel has a hu-
manitarian obligation in this area. 
They recognize, as well, that we may 
not always agree on every facet of our 
relationship, but this measure should 
be unconditional because it is defen-
sive, and it is humanitarian to support 
the Iron Dome. 
I wish my Republican colleagues 
were here to refute Senator PAUL, be-
cause I know many of them support it. 
Therefore, I will not modify my re-
quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing the right to object, I am dis-
appointed that the Democrats will 
again today block the Iron Dome fund-
ing as paid for. I think it is important 
that we do support our allies. I am in 
support of the Iron Dome funding, but 
I think, at the very least, it should be 
paid for. We have offered them various 
permutations of this—either the entire 
$6 billion from the Afghan reconstruc-
tion fund or $1 billion. We have offered 
them other alternatives to look at 
other funding in government that al-
ready exists to see if we could pay for 
this. 
So the real reluctance is on the 
Democrats’ part to pay for aid, and the 
thing is that we can’t just blindly keep 
giving money away without repercus-
sions. We are $30 trillion in debt. 
So I am disappointed today that the 
Democrats will block the Iron Dome 
funding as paid for, and I do object to 
the underlying proposition. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I would just 
close, Mr. President, by saying we need 
to pass this measure. We need to do it 
now, and there is no need for pay-for. 
We should move ahead with this unani-
mous consent. I regret the objection. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5323 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, when I 
traveled to Israel in 2019, I saw with my 
own eyes the Iron Dome system up 
close and in person. I met with the 
brave soldiers who operate and protect 
it—young men and women, in many 
cases, no older than 18 or 19 years old. 
Iron Dome is a missile defense sys-
tem that has successfully intercepted 
thousands of missiles fired by terrorist 
groups, like Hamas, at Israeli popu-
lation centers. It has protected Jews, 
Christians, and Muslims. It has pro-
tected them all from harm and saved 
countless lives, Israelis and Palestin-
ians alike. 
This incredible feat of defense tech-
nology is a shining example of the un-
breakable U.S.-Israel security partner-
ship. The U.S. Army is in the process,

as well, of acquiring Iron Dome bat-
teries, and it tested the system as re-
cently as August, meaning this life-
saving technology could also protect 
American men and women in uniform 
from a variety of missile threats. 
Let me be clear. I want to emphasize 
the word ‘‘defense.’’ Iron Dome is a 
purely defensive system. It is a shield— 
a miraculous shield—against death and 
destruction, one that America should 
be proud to help support and has sup-
ported across both Democratic and Re-
publican administrations and in Demo-
cratic and Republican Congresses for 
over a decade. Iron Dome saves lives; 
Iron Dome prevents an escalation of vi-
olence; and Iron Dome provides a crit-
ical window for diplomacy. 
This past May, terrorist organiza-
tions launched over 4,400 rockets at 
Israel. That is right—4,400 rockets. 
Iron Dome was key to preventing 90 
percent of these rockets from reaching 
their targets, saving the lives of inno-
cent Israeli citizens. We should be 
proud to support this technological 
feat that has protected countless lives 
and will continue to do so. 
My trip to Israel and my visit to see 
Iron Dome, well, is on my mind today 
because Israel needs our help, and they 
need it now. 
This summer, following the barrage 
of rocket fire—those 4,400 missiles that 
Israel had to endure and which the Iron 
Dome protected Israel against—Israel 
made an emergency request to the 
United States for security assistance in 
order to replenish and repair the Iron 
Dome defense system to defend against 
future potential conflicts. 
To Israel’s north, on the border with 
Lebanon, which I went to see just 2 
years 
ago, 
Hezbollah, 
an 
Iranian- 
backed terrorist organization, is esti-
mated to possess over 100,000 missiles. 
Those 100,000 missiles are pointed at 
Israel, including thousands of precision 
missiles. If war were ever to break out 
again between Israel and Lebanon, as it 
did in 2006, Iron Dome would play a 
crucial role in protecting civilians—all 
civilians in Israel. 
Just a few months ago, I joined 
Democratic and Republican colleagues 
in urging the continued support for 
Iron Dome. Support for Iron Dome is 
about the integrity of the U.S.-Israel 
relationship. There has always been 
strong bipartisan support for the U.S.- 
Israel defense partnership. That bipar-
tisan support continues today. 
The failure to fund this critical de-
fensive tool would be catastrophic for 
Israel and would result in lives lost. It 
would lead to more conflict, and it 
would weaken the bond between the 
United States and our greatest ally in 
the Middle East. We must take action 
to ensure that this program remains 
fully operational. 
The House of Representatives has al-
ready passed legislation on an over-
whelmingly bipartisan basis to fund 
Iron Dome. It was a vote of 420 for, and 
only 9 against. So now it is the Sen-
ate’s turn to act. 
Earlier this week, my colleague Sen-
ator MENENDEZ, Chairman of the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee, said 
this: ‘‘There is no conceivable reason 
why anyone in this Chamber or on ei-
ther side of the aisle should stand in 
the way of U.S. support for this life-
saving defense to be fully ready for the 
next attack.’’ 
He is exactly right. Opposition to 
Iron Dome is contrary to U.S. national 
security interests and violates the 
commitment that the U.S. Government 
made to Israel. 
We have an opportunity to rebuild 
the Iron Dome shield, to support the 
security of our most important ally in 
the Middle East, and to save lives. But 
we must take action right here and 
right now. 
So as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader, fol-
lowing consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, the Senate proceed to con-
sideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 
5323; that there be up to 2 hours for de-
bate; that upon the use or yielding 
back of time, the bill be considered 
read a third time, and that the Senate 
vote on passage of the bill without in-
tervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, as we speak, the 
Taliban is regaining control, has con-
trol over most of Afghanistan, is bru-
talizing women, kicking women out of 
school. Women will no longer be par-
ticipating in the government. 
It is really just unconscionable that 
Democrats insist that money be there 
to give to the Taliban. 
Any person who believes and truly 
believes that the Taliban is a menace 
to women’s rights and to women in a 
civilized world should join me in say-
ing: We should make sure that no 
money ever goes to the Taliban. 
When Secretary Blinken was asked 
about this, he said that if there is co-
operation and if they meet expecta-
tions, the $6 billion—and some say up 
to $10 billion—available for the pre-
vious government will be given to the 
Taliban, who violently overthrew this 
government. 
We are asking something very sim-
ple. We could fund Iron Dome today. 
Make sure that everybody who listens 
to this understands. This is being 
blocked by Democrats who don’t want 
to pay for it. 
We have a proposal that would have 
proposed $1 billion today for Iron 
Dome, but it would have been paid for 
by taking money out of an account 
that has been allocated and that Sec-
retary Blinken has indicated he will 
give to the Taliban if they behave. 
So I think it is a real problem, and it 
is a problem of this body that the cava-
lier nature of just letting our country 
pile on $30 trillion of debt. You ask how 
we got here. We got here $1 billion at a 
time. 
So rarely do we have an episode or a 
time where we can object. You know, I 
would object to a trillion if it were on 
the floor. I would object to $50 billion 
on the floor. 
But the billion dollars ought to be 
paid for. And there are so many pay- 
fors. But this is why government grows 
by leaps and bounds and becomes more 
and more wasteful over time. 
So I do object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. PAUL’s objection is 
unacceptable. He knows it is unaccept-
able. This is no time for political 
games. It could jeopardize the support 
for our allies and people in need of life-
saving assistance. 
I challenge all my Republican col-
leagues to let us take up the House- 
passed bill, passed 420 to 9, and fund 
Iron Dome for our national security— 
our 
national 
security—as 
well 
as 
Israel’s. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I want to 
use the opportunity of the Senate floor 
today to call to the attention what I 
think is an alarming proposal that 
would allow the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice to track nearly all inflows and out-
flows of Americans’ bank accounts. 
I heard this story—I heard this pro-
posal while I was home in Kansas, and 
my reaction was: I assume this is just 
something on the internet, something 
that people are perhaps fabricating. 
Surely no one seriously is proposing 
that every transaction of $600 in one’s 
bank account and $600 out of one’s 
bank account is something that the In-
ternal Revenue Service should be mon-
itoring and recording, or that records 
would need to be provided to the IRS 
with that information. 
It is one of those thing I thought, 
well, that is just some crazy something 
that somebody is talking about. But, lo 
and 
behold, 
unfortunately, 
I 
have 
learned that, over the years—some-
times my constituents have brought 
me things in the past that tell me the 
story. It is, like, I can’t believe that 
would be true, but let me check it out; 
and far too often, it turns out that it 
really is someone’s proposal in the Na-
tion’s Capital. 
Most Kansans would react to this 
concept by saying: I can’t believe it is 
true. And then: Make sure you do 
something to keep it from happening. 
In this case, it is apparently true. 
And not only is it true, it is true be-
cause it is supported, it is proposed by 
the Biden administration. 
It is the Secretary of the Treasury, 
Janet Yellen, who believes and testi-
fied that this is a good idea. It is 
Charles Rettig, the IRS Commissioner, 
who believes that this is important to 
accomplish. It is not just somebody’s 
ideas. It is somebody who has some-
thing that—because they have some-
thing to say that matters that can 
cause it to happen is for this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6962 
October 7, 2021 
For the IRS knowing how much 
money a Kansan earns, that just isn’t 
enough. How much an American earns, 
it isn’t enough to know our income. 
Now the IRS wants to know how you 
spend that income. 
This is an invasion of privacy that fo-
cuses on account flows, not just on in-
come, and it intrudes on virtually 
every American. 
The claim that this will help tax 
wealthy cheats—I am all for taxing 
wealthy cheats, but instead, this isn’t 
that. It gives the government the un-
precedented access to nearly every 
working American’s bank account. 
Rather than listening to the enor-
mous pushback from Americans and 
eliminating from consideration this 
invasive mandate, Democrats are sim-
ply suggesting to tweak the proposal 
depending on the revenues needed to 
fund this massive tax-and-spend spree 
that is around the corner. 
In recent weeks, I have heard from 
more than 1,000 Kansans who are 
alarmed at this massive expansion of 
IRS reach and authority, this invasion 
of privacy. The last thing my Kansas 
constituents would want when it comes 
to their own bank account is more bu-
reaucrats watching and dictating how 
they live their lives. This provision is a 
threat to their privacy. They see it 
that way, and it is. 
Kansas relies heavily on small-town 
banks and credit unions to provide 
rural communities and their citizens 
with lending services to finance a 
small business expansion, to allow a 
family to pay for college, or to buy a 
home. 
The relationship between our bank-
ers, our credit unions, and their cus-
tomers and clients is a special one. It is 
personal. That private relationship be-
tween a banker and their customer is 
one that is based upon trust. The bank-
er no more wants to be in the middle of 
invading 
their 
customers’ 
privacy. 
Mandating that banks report to the 
government their customers’ account 
activities will significantly breach the 
trust that a customer, a client has with 
their banker. 
These financial institutions are often 
run by just a handful of employees, and 
are often a family operation handed 
down from one generation to the next. 
We have lots of small local banks and 
credit unions already knee-deep—per-
haps waist-deep—in red tape; some-
thing they have to deal with every day, 
and something we have tried nearly 
every day to reduce or eliminate. 
Our bankers and credit unions spend 
millions of dollars to comply with the 
anti-money laundering policies, and 
those often yield minimal results. 
This proposal would turn our bank-
ing system into an extension of the In-
ternal Revenue Service while forcing 
local banks to shoulder the cost. And 
these 
costs, 
of 
course, 
ultimately 
would be paid for—guess who—the cus-
tomer, the citizen. 
So not only are we—would this pro-
posal allow our privacy to be intruded 
upon, but we would be paying as it hap-
pens. 
Unfortunately, the IRS has increas-
ingly politicized and—has been politi-
cized and has a history of targeting 
disfavored groups and individuals, and 
has proven incapable of protecting tax-
payers’ data from leaks. 
Entrusting 
this 
bureaucracy, 
the 
IRS, or, really, any other bureaucracy 
in Washington, DC, with the super-
vision of your personal finances is no 
way to close a tax gap. 
At a time when the American people 
are more weary than ever of the Fed-
eral Government and their Agencies, 
this proposal will do nothing but fur-
ther increase that distrust. 
Democrats in Congress and particu-
larly 
in 
the 
Biden 
administration 
should 
prioritize 
strengthening 
the 
faith in the financial service, not pur-
suing these kinds of policies that will 
push underbanked Americans away. 
Ultimately, this plan will not achieve 
its stated goal of increasing tax reve-
nues. Rather, it will lead to more har-
assment of average Americans and 
those who work at their financial insti-
tutions. 
It is clear to me that there is an at-
tempt here to leave no stone unturned 
to find every possible way to tax every-
day Americans in order to fund a mas-
sive spending spree. 
So while we hoped that this proposal 
was just idle talk, something that 
somebody said over a cup of coffee at 
the local doughnut shop or the cafe, 
something that when we went to find 
out if there was any truth to it we dis-
cover: Oh, no, I could tell my constitu-
ents this isn’t happening, this is just 
something that somebody is gossiping 
about. 
But no. It is a serious proposal by the 
Biden administration, and it has seri-
ous consequences to the well-being, fi-
nancial, but perhaps more importantly, 
the privacy, something that Americans 
deserve, something that Americans re-
quest, and something that is already 
too often lacking in our lives—pri-
vacy—and in this case, privacy from 
the Federal Government. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Iowa. 
TRUMP INVESTIGATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to address the Senate Judi-
ciary majority’s Trump investigation 
examining the period from December 
14, 2020 through January 3, 2021. 
The majority released their report 
this morning; the minority released 
our report this morning. 
This truncated investigation doesn’t 
support the long-running Democratic 
narrative that Trump used the Justice 
Department to try to overturn the 2020 
election. And it is truncated because 
we don’t have all the records and this 
committee only interviewed three wit-
nesses. 
The available evidence shows that 
President Trump didn’t use the Depart-
ment of Justice to subvert the 2020 
election. For example, one witness tes-
tified that President Trump had no im-
pact—I repeat, no impact; and the 
words ‘‘no impact’’ come from that 
witness—on what the Department did 
to investigate election allegations. 
In fact, the evidence shows that 
President Trump listened to his advis-
ers and to their recommendations, and 
that he followed those recommenda-
tions. 
The witnesses also testified that 
President Trump didn’t fire anyone at 
the Justice Department relating to the 
election. 
Records from this investigation indi-
cate that President Trump’s focus was 
on ‘‘legitimate complaints and reports 
of crimes.’’ 
Witnesses testified that President 
Trump’s main focus was on making the 
Department aware of the potential 
criminal allegations and to ensure that 
the Department did its job. It wasn’t 
President Trump directing or ordering 
specific investigative steps. Witnesses 
also testified that it wasn’t unreason-
able for President Trump to ask the 
Department what it was doing to inves-
tigate election fraud and crime allega-
tions. 
Now, with respect to the other core 
issues in the Democratic narrative, the 
available evidence shows three facts. 
Fact No. 1: President Trump rejected 
sending the letter drafted and advo-
cated by Assistant Attorney General 
Clark to various States to contest the 
election. 
Fact No. 2: President Trump rejected 
firing Attorney General Rosen. Indeed, 
after Bill Barr submitted his resigna-
tion as Attorney General, President 
Trump apparently considered Richard 
Donoghue as a replacement, showing 
his displeasure with Rosen. 
Third 
and 
final 
fact: 
President 
Trump accepted Acting Attorney Gen-
eral Rosen’s position that the Depart-
ment not file a lawsuit against the 
States with reported voter issues. 
The Democrats’ report makes much 
of the efforts by individual lawyers to 
push the Department to take these 
steps, but the fact is, none of these 
steps were taken because President 
Trump made the ultimate decision not 
to take those steps. At each of these 
critical decision points, the President 
asked his advisers for their candid 
views and their candid recommenda-
tions, and the President followed them. 
Now, ask yourself this: Where would 
we be now if President Biden followed 
the advice and recommendations of his 
advisers regarding Afghanistan? And 
we know what that advice was because 
we heard it last week before the com-
mittees in the House and Senate by the 
generals who were testifying. 
Again, I am not sure why the com-
mittee is releasing transcripts and an 
investigative report when the inves-
tigation doesn’t seem to be complete 
yet. I, as chairman of a committee, run 
investigations 
differently. 
I 
collect 
records and run all the necessary inter-
views. I gather the full set of facts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6963 
October 7, 2021 
Then and only then, I release the mate-
rial publicly. 
So far, the narrative the majority 
has been spinning here just isn’t borne 
out by the facts. So this advice from 
me: Don’t take this Senator’s word for 
it; do as we have done on the Repub-
lican side. Read the transcripts. I think 
you will come to the very same conclu-
sions that I have just stated. 
TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR LISA SCHULTE MOORE 
Mr. President, on a second point and 
a much shorter point, I would like to 
recognize an outstanding professor at 
Iowa State University. Professor Lisa 
Schulte Moore of Iowa State Univer-
sity is doing important work on behalf 
of farmers and rural communities, and 
eventually it affects all Americans. 
Dr. Schulte Moore is a landscape 
ecologist and professor of natural re-
source ecology and management. Addi-
tionally, she serves as associate direc-
tor of the Bioeconomy Institute at 
Iowa State University. 
Dr. Schulte Moore was recently rec-
ognized as the 2021 MacArthur Founda-
tion Award recipient and the first-ever 
Iowa State MacArthur Fellow. This 
award is known as the Genius Grant 
and is given to individuals who have 
shown a dedication to their field 
through creativity and originality. 
Dr. Schulte Moore is a founder of the 
Prairie STRIPS conservation program. 
Established in 2003 at the Neal Smith 
National Wildlife Refuge in Prairie 
City, IA, this program studied the ef-
fects of planting prairie strips on farm-
land. 
Before I continue, I just used the 
name Neal Smith—former Congress-
man Neal Smith of Iowa, 36 years a 
Member of the House of Representa-
tives. He has been retired quite a while 
now. He just celebrated, I think, his 
100th birthday and is still active in the 
Des Moines community. 
Participants found that prairie strips 
can protect the quality of our soil and 
water by reducing farm field soil loss 
by 95 percent. They also reduce nitro-
gen and phosphorus runoff by up to 80 
percent. Because of the professor’s 
work, prairie strips are used in 14 
States on over 115,000 acres of cropland. 
In addition to the $625,000 received 
through the MacArthur Foundation, 
Dr. Schulte Moore was recently award-
ed a $10 million Federal grant to turn 
biomass and manure into fuel. With 
this research, the professor is looking 
for additional ways that farm waste 
can be turned into renewable fuel and 
consequently not contribute to the 
degradation of the environment. 
Whether it is researching the next 
generation of biofuels or helping farm-
ers understand what conservation prac-
tices work best at their farms, I am 
grateful that the MacArthur Founda-
tion recognized Dr. Schulte Moore. Her 
dedication and innovation encourage 
young people at Iowa State University 
and beyond to become involved in agri-
culture. 
The fact is, the United States has the 
safest and most abundant food supply 
in the world thanks to the American 
farmer and through research at institu-
tions like Iowa State University. 
Congratulations, Dr. Schulte Moore. 
Iowa State University and the State of 
Iowa are lucky to have a professor like 
you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
VACCINES 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. President 
Biden ran on a promise to be a unifying 
moderate. He promised to bring Amer-
ica together. On the campaign trail, he 
promised to ‘‘shut down the virus, not 
the country.’’ As we have seen with his 
vaccine management, the opposite has 
happened. 
Joe Biden and Democrats in Wash-
ington have adopted an agenda of sys-
temic socialism focused on expanding 
government and Federal control. In 
Joe Biden’s America, the government 
knows better than the people, and 
President Biden has shown that he is 
eager to use government mandates to 
keep families in check. 
President Biden’s latest vaccine man-
date for private companies tramples on 
the personal freedoms of Americans. 
This unconstitutional order will push 
more Americans out of the workforce, 
devastate our economy with product 
and service shortages that cripple sup-
ply chains, and throw America into a 
stagflation crisis not seen since the 
1970s. 
By forcing some working Americans 
to choose between keeping their jobs or 
doing what they believe is best for 
their health, Biden’s mandate hurts 
the people he claims to help—workers, 
low-income Americans, and seniors on 
a fixed income, who will all be either 
hit with higher unemployment, higher 
prices, or a shortage of available goods. 
When I think about the impact of 
burdensome government regulations, I 
think about my dad. My adopted father 
was a truckdriver. Anyone who has 
driven trucks or been close to someone 
in that line of work knows how de-
manding that job can be. It is hard 
work, and it is one of the most critical 
jobs in our country. Truckdrivers are 
like the offensive linemen of America’s 
supply chain—often overlooked but ab-
solutely essential to getting things 
moving. Our country is already experi-
encing a significant shortage of truck-
drivers. We can’t afford to lose any 
more. 
Of course, trucking isn’t the only in-
dustry that will be affected by Biden’s 
unconstitutional 
mandate; 
nearly 
every sector is under the gun. In an 
economy where simply keeping shelves 
stocked is an everyday challenge, los-
ing workers in almost any critical in-
dustry will have a catastrophic impact 
across our supply chains and drive 
prices even higher. 
Just this week, a month and a half 
before Thanksgiving, Amazon began al-
ready giving Black Friday discounts on 
goods because they expect so many 
delays and shortages on goods. That 
means families who have to wait for 
holiday bonuses before they can go 
shopping are going to be facing ‘‘out of 
stock’’ signs online and in stores. 
Joe Biden needs to answer this ques-
tion: How is he going to fix this? How 
can Joe Biden guarantee that our sup-
ply chains won’t completely crumble 
under his failed policies and mandates? 
In fact, I urge President Biden to 
have Transportation Secretary Pete 
Buttigieg and Commerce Secretary 
Gina Raimondo testify to the Com-
merce Committee on the shortages we 
are already seeing and the shortages 
that we anticipate. 
Ensuring the stability of American 
supply chains requires the urgent at-
tention of the Biden administration. As 
a member of the Commerce Committee 
and ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Tourism, Trade, and Ex-
port Promotion, I know this testimony 
from 
Secretaries 
Buttigieg 
and 
Raimondo would be useful in under-
standing how this will be addressed. 
We are already starting to see major 
supply issues. Seafood restaurants in 
Miami are seeing price increases of 50 
to 60 percent on fish. Furniture stores 
in Florida are seeing wait times of 6 to 
8 months before they can deliver cer-
tain products. Florida grocery stores 
are warning of product shortages as 
customers are starting to see empty 
shelves. 
Small business owners and families 
aren’t able to afford those kinds of 
drastic increases, but if President 
Biden has his way, those transpor-
tation difficulties are going to become 
even worse and prices will rise even 
higher. Right now, rising prices on ev-
eryday goods are forcing American 
families to make hard choices. 
I have said it on this floor countless 
times, and I will say it again: Reckless 
government spending causes inflation. 
The reckless spending agenda of Joe 
Biden and Democrats here in Wash-
ington is having disastrous effects on 
families across our country. 
We can never forget that, as inflation 
worsens and prices surge higher, it is 
the poorest Americans and those on 
fixed incomes who are hurt the most. 
There are single moms wondering if 
they can put an extra few gallons of 
gas in the car and still afford to put 
dinner on the table this week or moms 
like mine who took on odd jobs to 
make ends meet and watched the 
smallest price changes at the grocery 
store to make sure we could still get 
by. 
If President Biden actually spoke 
with small and midsized employers and 
hard-working families instead of big 
banks and CEOs, he would learn that 
massive Federal mandates won’t help 
us get our economy back on track. His 
Big Government mandates will only 
hurt us. 
I want to be clear. I got the vaccine. 
I had COVID. And I encourage every 
American to talk with their doctor and 
consider doing the same. But getting 
the vaccine is a choice every American

gets to make for themselves. We can’t 
give people an ultimatum to comply, 
quit, or get fired. It is a gross over-
reach by the Federal Government at a 
time when we need more jobs, not less; 
lower prices on everyday goods, not 
higher. 
Unlike Joe Biden and Democrats in 
Washington, I don’t believe that gov-
ernment knows better than the Amer-
ican people. My parents didn’t have 
much of a formal education, but they 
worked hard and made the choices they 
felt were right for the health and well- 
being of our family. They relied on gov-
ernment to keep them informed, and 
they made their own choices. That is 
how government should work. 
That is what I did when I was Gov-
ernor of Florida. In 2016, Florida was 
faced with the Zika virus, which im-
pacted newborns. Rather than placing 
mandates on pregnant women or re-
stricting their travel to areas with 
local transmission of Zika, which we 
knew where they were, we simply in-
formed Floridians. We worked to be as 
transparent as possible and offered free 
Zika testing to all pregnant women in 
Florida. That is how the Federal Gov-
ernment should deal with COVID. The 
government’s role in public health is to 
inform and support, not mandate. 
Our country has seen labor shortages 
caused by Democrats’ failed policies of 
rewarding unemployment, paying peo-
ple more to stay at home than to get 
back to work. Energy prices are surg-
ing, and inflation is raging. American 
families can’t afford more of Presi-
dent’s Biden’s radical policy decisions 
that are inflicting lasting damage and 
driving our economy backwards. 
Restoring and strengthening our sup-
ply chains is a critical step in getting 
the American economy rolling forward. 
It is time for President Biden to ac-
knowledge that massive, unconstitu-
tional mandates on private companies 
won’t do anything but hurt American 
business and throw gasoline on the al-
ready raging inflation crisis he has cre-
ated. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
TRIBUTE TO WARRANT OFFICER HERSHEL 
‘‘WOODY’’ WILLIAMS 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I am 
here today to honor the lives of our 
World War II Medal of Honor recipients 
who bravely served our Nation, includ-
ing the last surviving recipient who 
just 
celebrated 
his 
98th 
birthday, 
Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams. 
My colleague is here with me. We 
have known Woody for years and years 
and years. This is a person who has 
never quit serving his country from the 
day he was born to the day he fought 
and won the Congressional Medal of 
Honor in Iwo Jima. 
If you ever saw any pictures and basi-
cally the war videos we see, you see a 
little guy running around Iwo Jima 
shooting the flame thrower in the pill 
boxes. That was Woody. It is just unbe-
lievable. 
He is a fellow West Virginian. He was 
a marine, a Medal of Honor recipient 
for his heroic efforts at the Battle of 
Iwo Jima that I have been told in-
volved the flame thrower, which I have 
seen. And it is not just one. I think he 
went through five flame throwers be-
cause when he ran out, he went and re-
loaded and went at them again. It is 
just unbelievable. 
Woody has dedicated his life to our 
great and our beautiful United States 
through his service in the military and 
his dedication to supporting veterans 
and advocating for their needs for dec-
ades after. 
There is not a time when I know that 
Senator CAPITO and myself don’t hear 
from Woody and there is something 
going on, whether it is at the ceme-
tery, or whether we are having a ride 
for the Gold Star families. We do a mo-
torcycle ride, which I would like to in-
vite the Presiding Officer to. 
I say to the Presiding Officer: You 
would enjoy it. It is wonderful. 
Senator CAPITO has been with us be-
fore on that. It is just a wonderful 
thing, and Woody has never failed to be 
part of it. Now, he rides in a sling shot, 
but, by golly, he makes the whole 
route. 
He has dedicated his life fully to our 
veterans and to the Gold Star families. 
He is bound and determined to get a 
committal shelter built at the Donel C. 
Kinnard 
Memorial 
State 
Veterans 
Cemetery. Again, Senator CAPITO and 
I, both serving on the Appropriations 
Committee, have committed that we 
are united in getting this done. We will 
get that done, and it needs to be. 
That basically would ensure that the 
families of our fallen soldiers and vet-
erans, they have a safe place to lay 
their loved ones to rest, protected from 
the weather, rain, Sun, and snow 
throughout the year. 
In this year’s Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs appropriations 
bill, we include a language to create a 
pilot program that allows Federal vet-
erans cemeteries to build shelters for 
those purposes. But we must ensure the 
pilot program includes State veterans 
cemeteries, like the Donel C. Kinnard 
Memorial State Veterans Cemetery. 
The families of our fallen service-
members deserve to honor their loved 
ones in peace, and I am proud to help 
Woody fight for this simple request. 
Americans like Woody Williams an-
swered the call to serve our great Na-
tion during World War II, and he 
fought to ensure democracy prevailed. 
Their sacrifices allowed the rest of us 
to enjoy the freedoms we hold sacred 
and help make the United States the 
strongest Nation in the world. 
I am going to share with you one 
story that Woody has told all of us 
back home. He says the thing that he 
remembers most and the thing that he 
stills grieves the most about, he had 
two marines that were protecting him 
with gunfire while he ran around, and 
their lives were sacrificed for him. I 
think both got shot and perished. And 
he says: They gave their life for me to 
do my job and protect and save my life. 
There is not a day that goes by, he 
says, he doesn’t think about that, how 
the Good Lord spared him and the sac-
rifices that were made for him and our 
country. 
So I believe that honoring all of 
those who served in World War II by al-
lowing the last surviving—and I want 
to make sure we understand. Woody 
Williams is the last surviving Medal of 
Honor recipient from World War II. 
We are asking that he be allowed to 
lay in State at the U.S. Capitol Ro-
tunda. And what better way to honor 
this generation, their sacrifices than 
the President to authorize the State 
funeral for that brave individual. 
And Woody—there is not a better 
person to represent all of those who 
sacrificed and given their all, all of 
those who were basically decorated for 
their valor, to do this. And bestowing 
this great honor on the last survivor 
and the World War II Medal of Honor 
recipient would be the perfect way to 
come together as a nation to salute the 
‘‘greatest generation.’’ 
So I am honored to be here with my 
colleague and my friend Senator CAP-
ITO in a bipartisan—you know, I have 
always said this: The glue that holds 
this country together is the people who 
put themselves in harm’s way for all of 
us. 
They didn’t say: Well, I will put a 
uniform on and I will take a bullet for 
the Republican, but not the Democrat, 
or I will take a bullet for the Democrat 
and not the Republican. 
Senator CAPITO’s father took a bullet 
for all of us too, and she will speak 
about that, I am sure, and the bravery 
that he had. He was my dear friend, 
and we all miss him. But the sacrifices 
that my parents and Senator CAPITO’s 
parents and the generation—that was 
the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ I think, 
that we will ever see because they took 
responsibility and took responsibility 
for their action. They held themselves 
accountable for their actions, and that 
showed the character that generation 
has. 
And that is what I would hope these 
young interns and all the young pages 
that we have here understand, that 
your character is defined the day that 
you take responsibility for the ac-
tions—good, bad, or indifferent—and be 
able to look yourself in the mirror and 
say: I made a mistake. I can do better. 
That is my fault. I will fix that. That 
is character. 
So I am honored to be here and to 
honor every World War II veteran, 
every World War II Medal of Honor re-
cipient. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join us in our efforts to 
honor these brave veterans. And I call 
on our President, President Biden, to 
grant our request. 
With that, I yield the floor to my col-
league. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President.

ator from West Virginia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6965 
October 7, 2021 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, it is an 
honor to talk about a good friend of 
ours, Woody Williams, here with my 
fellow Senator from the West Virginia, 
to talk about our fellow West Vir-
ginian, Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams. 
He is just an incredible, incredible, 
individual. He turned 98 just, I think, 
last week. So he was born in 1923, 
which was the same year my father 
was born. Woody and I have talked 
about this because when I see him, I 
see my dad and that generation. My 
dad is no longer with us. You know, 
they did incredible things at such a 
young age. 
One day, I was honored to sit next to 
Woody on an airplane flying home. He 
travels all over. It is amazing where he 
goes and what he does. He told me his 
whole story of joining the Marines and 
signing up for the Marines and why he 
wanted to do it. He was a country boy, 
just born—they didn’t really actually 
know when he was born. He didn’t have 
a full birth certificate. And he is a lit-
tle guy. He wasn’t quite big enough to 
maybe get—be able to join, and he wor-
ried about that. He was 17, but nobody 
really knew how old he was. 
I asked him: Well, what was your at-
traction of being in the Marines? 
He said one day he was in town and 
he saw this guy walk by, and he was 
fully dressed in a Marine uniform. 
And he said: I want to be that guy. I 
want to wear that uniform. 
And he persevered, as he has in every 
aspect of his life. 
There are so many, as Senator 
MANCHIN said, so many brave from that 
‘‘greatest generation’’ that served in 
World War II. And he is the final World 
War II veteran Medal of Honor recipi-
ent of that award. 
We are so proud of him in West Vir-
ginia because, you know, it didn’t stop 
there for him. He spent a lifetime advo-
cating 
for 
veterans, 
for 
veterans’ 
health, for fallen soldiers’ families, in a 
whole variety of roles, and he never 
stopped. 
As Senator MANCHIN said, he fought 
valiantly in the Battle of Iwo Jima, 
storming those pill boxes, all four of 
them, under relentless fire. He survived 
the entire 5-week campaign in Iwo 
Jima. As we know, that was one of the 
most 
staunchly 
defended 
Japanese 
strong points at that time, and his ac-
tions played a critical role in the even-
tual capture of that island. 
He has inspired future generations to 
want to serve our Nation. He is a hero 
for what he has done at home. He has 
committed himself for 75 years to vet-
erans and their families, and he created 
the Hershel Woody Williams Founda-
tion. 
Through his foundation, Woody advo-
cates for and recognizes the sacrifices 
of our Gold Star families who have lost 
loved ones in the military. 
Because of his tremendous efforts, 
Woody and his foundation are respon-
sible for 60 Gold Star family memorial 
monuments. Senator MANCHIN
and I 
have been to the grand opening. They 
just had a new one in Charleston, on 
the grounds of the Charleston capitol. 
It is beautiful to see, and the other 70 
additional monuments that are going 
to be built in the future. 
We need reminders, I think. We need 
reminders of the sacrifices that people 
make. And we need reminders of what 
it takes to defend our liberties, our 
freedoms, our families. So we are real-
ly, really pleased to be here. 
The West Virginia Legislature in-
cluded Woody in the West Virginia Hall 
of Fame and named him a Distin-
guished West Virginian in 1980, and 
again in 2013, and they would probably 
do it again next year. He is just so ex-
ceptional. 
His unending energy and passion 
have also inspired many generations. 
He has spoken to numerous schools, 
universities, community events, and 
veterans’ receptions, promoting patri-
otism and the ideals of service above 
self. 
I have been privileged to attend—and 
I know Senator MANCHIN has too—sev-
eral speeches given by Woody Williams, 
keeping in mind the last one I heard, 
he was 97 years old. Oh, my gosh, so in-
spiring. It makes you just want to feel 
pride for our country but also for our 
people, that our country boy from West 
Virginia could keep inspiring the next 
generations. 
He has been here to the Halls of the 
U.S. Capitol. Or you might have even 
seen him at the coin flip—how did he 
get there?—at the Super Bowl in 2018. 
So he has gone on to really, I think, be 
a remarkable human being. If you 
haven’t met him or haven’t seen him, 
make sure you get a chance if you hear 
he is coming your way. 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
famously 
said: 
‘‘Any nation that does not honor its 
heroes will not long endure.’’ 
Today, I am proud to honor my 
friend, with Senator MANCHIN
and 
many other West Virginians and others 
around the country, and to share his 
stories of courage, compassion, and the 
service not only in the past but the 
service that he has today. I am glad to 
join a bipartisan group of our col-
leagues in honoring him and honoring 
him in the future. 
Thank you. 
I yield back. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I say to Senator CAP-
ITO, if you could just wait a minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I know you remember 
this very well. 
Woody is a person who taught us all 
how to say the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Because we think we know how to say 
it. We all memorized it as a little kid: 
‘‘I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America and to the 
Republic for which it stands.’’ 
Woody would always say: One Nation 
under God—do not stop, do not hesitate 
at ‘‘one Nation.’’ It is ‘‘one Nation 
under God.’’ It is not ‘‘one Nation.’’ 
‘‘Under God with liberty and justice for 
all.’’ 
He corrected us, and he never would 
let us say it without going with no 
pause because he said we are a nation 
under God. 
And I will never forget. He drove that 
home so many times to all of us. So the 
young pages here, I hope you will re-
member that. 
With that, maybe we should do a 
‘‘happy birthday’’ together to Woody 
because he is probably watching. So to-
gether, you and I? Happy birthday, 
Woody. 
Ms. CAPITO. Happy birthday, Woody. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
also want to wish Woody a happy birth-
day as well. 
I just join my colleagues today to 
commemorate and honor some of the 
Nation’s most admirable warfighters in 
the Second World War, and I so appre-
ciate my colleagues bringing their per-
sonal stories to the floor today. This is 
something that all Americans should 
cherish—the stories of these heroes. We 
have very few of these brave heroes 
still among us today, and it is so im-
portant that they receive every ounce 
of recognition that we can give them 
for their selflessness and extraordinary 
heroism. 
I am pleased to be a cosponsor of 
Senator MANCHIN’s legislation to pro-
vide a merited celebration and com-
memoration of the last living World 
War II Medal of Honor recipient, 
Woody Williams, who recently cele-
brated his 98th birthday. 
Medal of Honor recipients like Mr. 
Williams demonstrated a courageous 
and noble commitment to our Nation, 
and their exemplary actions deserve all 
the praise that we can give them. 
I am proud to represent a State that 
has several World War II Medal of 
Honor recipients of its own, in Mis-
sissippi: Van Thomas Barfoot of Edin-
burg, Robert T. Henry of Greenville, 
James Daniel Slaton of Gulfport, Louis 
Hugh Wilson of Brandon, and Jack Har-
old Lucas of Hattiesburg, whom I still 
remain friends with his family today. 
From Germany to Japan, these men 
served our Nation without hesitation 
in the height of the Second World War, 
defending our Nation, our allies, and 
the very principles of freedom. It fills 
my heart with great pride to call these 
late veterans my fellow Mississippians. 
The tributes we offer today for Mr. Wil-
liams in truth stand for our deep appre-
ciation for all of those who fought in 
World War II. 
I thank my colleagues for their great 
work on this important recognition 
and the opportunity to be a part of 
this. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I join 
my colleagues today in support of our 
bipartisan resolution to designate a 
state funeral in honor of the last sur-
viving Medal of Honor recipient for

World War II. Woody Williams is that 
person, and this would also recognize 
millions of Americans for their service 
and sacrifice during the war. 
The Medal of Honor represents a 
small token of our appreciation for the 
spirit, determination, and gallantry of 
those who performed far beyond the 
call of duty, those of our ‘‘greatest gen-
eration’’ who gave everything on the 
battlefield. This includes five brave 
Medal of Honor recipients from the 
great State of Montana: William W. 
Galt, Laverne Parrish, Leo J. Powers, 
Donald Ruhl, and Henry Schauer. Each 
of these men pitted bravery and her-
oism against great odds and showed ex-
emplary devotion to our Nation. Now, 
they have all passed, but their memo-
ries live on in each of us—in our free-
doms, in the freedoms of our children, 
and in those of our children’s children. 
Today, we have a special opportunity 
to honor their service and ensure that 
their acts of heroism are never forgot-
ten. A state funeral for the last sur-
viving World War II Medal of Honor re-
cipient is a key part of fulfilling this 
promise. These ceremonies offer our 
Nation the opportunity to pause and 
reflect on the service of not only the 
individual but also those who served 
alongside them. 
It is my hope that President Biden 
designates this state funeral so that we 
may honor the last surviving Medal of 
Honor recipient from World War II 
with this distinction. It is time to pay 
a final salute to the millions of men 
and women of our ‘‘greatest genera-
tion’’ who served our country with 
great courage. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, shortly, 
I will ask for unanimous consent on 
the nomination of Robert L. Santos to 
be the Director of the U.S. Census Bu-
reau. 
The mission of the Census Bureau is 
to serve as the leading source of qual-
ity data about the Nation’s people and 
our economy. The census and the Bu-
reau’s surveys are critical for commu-
nities, businesses, and people across 
our Nation to ensure communities have 
the resources and the information they 
need to thrive. 
The Census Bureau Director must 
meet the challenge of this mission. 
They must have experience in the col-
lection, analysis, and use of statistical 
data and demonstrated management 
experience at large organizations. 
Robert Santos is an eminently quali-
fied nominee for this role. He has over 
40 years of experience as a manager and 
expert in the field of survey design and 
statistical research, including experi-
ence as a manager at the most re-
nowned research centers for statistics, 
as principal of a market research firm, 
and currently at the nonprofit Urban 
Institute. 
He has interacted closely with the 
Census Bureau for decades as a re-
searcher, a stakeholder, and an expert 
adviser, serving on the Census Advi-
sory Committees and National Acad-
emies’ panels on Federal statistics. Mr. 
Santos has demonstrated a deep knowl-
edge of the Census Bureau, its data, 
and its stakeholders. He has dem-
onstrated a commitment to upholding 
the Bureau’s mission of producing es-
sential, high-quality data that our Na-
tion relies on. 
It is critical that we confirm Mr. 
Santos to the Census Bureau so they 
can continue their important work 
with a well-qualified leader at the 
helm. 
So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
following nominations: Calendar Nos. 
311 and 312, Robert Luis Santos, of 
Texas, to be Director of the Census for 
the remainder of the term expiring De-
cember 31, 2021; and Robert Luis 
Santos, of Texas, to be Director of the 
Census for a term expiring December 
31, 2026. (Reappointment); that the 
nominations be confirmed; that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate; that no 
further motions be in order to the 
nominations; that any related state-
ments be printed in the RECORD; and 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
First, happy birthday. Is it your 
birthday? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, sir. 
Don’t rush it. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. As my col-
league knows, the Census Bureau per-
forms critically important functions to 
collect accurate and timely data. Un-
fortunately, I am concerned that this 
nominee will politicize the Census Bu-
reau and will not perform his duties in 
a fair and unbiased fashion, which this 
position demands. 
I cannot and will not consent to al-
lowing this nominee to move forward 
in an expedited manner. We should 
take a vote so every Senator can get on 
the record with their support or opposi-
tion to this nominee. Therefore, Mr. 
President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last few months, the American people 
have watched in disbelief and then in 
anger as the Biden administration has 
completely fumbled the response to the 
border crisis. 
In the spring, the biggest concerns 
were the thousands of children coming 
across the border. We lacked the facili-
ties, the personnel, and the resources 
to provide proper care for those chil-
dren, particularly in those kinds of 
numbers. At one point, one of the proc-
essing centers in Donna, TX, in the Rio 
Grande Valley was at 1,600 percent of 
capacity. 
Then, in the summer, the scale and 
scope of the crisis grew. In addition to 
the thousands of unaccompanied chil-
dren entering our country each month, 
the number of family units has sky-
rocketed. 
I should pause to add, Mr. President, 
that the reason why the smugglers 
send in unaccompanied children is be-
cause they know they will simply be 
placed with sponsors in the interior of 
the country and most of them will fail 
to return to the immigration courts for 
their asylum hearing. So they will 
have been successfully placed in the 
United States, sometimes with rel-
atives, sometimes with noncitizens, 
sometimes with foster families who 
don’t know them at all. That is why 
the smugglers have been smuggling un-
accompanied children. 
But in August alone, more than 86,000 
members of families—typically women 
with young children—have crossed the 
border. Now that we have reached the 
fall, the crisis has shifted once again. 
I think what really grabbed people’s 
attention was when they saw the little 
town of Del Rio, TX, with 15,000 Hai-
tian migrants under a bridge in Del 
Rio, TX. First of all, they were 
shocked. They thought this was a Cen-
tral American phenomenon or Mexican 
migrants. But the reality is, as Border 
Patrol will tell you and has told me, we 
literally have people coming from 
around the world across the southern 
border, including some countries of 
particular concern. 
So the Haitians got people’s atten-
tion and completely overwhelmed the 
border region and our capacity to deal 
with them. That is why 400 Border Pa-
trol agents had to be shipped in from 
other parts of the border or from inte-
rior checkpoints, which means that 
those other locations were understaffed 
or perhaps had no staff at all. That, in 
turn, is an invitation to the drug smug-
glers to smuggle more drugs across the 
border. 
I have mentioned time and time 
again this shocking number: 93,000 
Americans died of drug overdoses last 
year. The vast majority of those drugs 
come across the southern border. So 
the cartels—these criminal organiza-
tions that smuggle people, drugs, and 
other 
contraband—they 
are 
pretty 
smart. They understand where the 
weaknesses are, where the gaps are 
both in our policy and in our physical 
ability to secure the border, and they 
play us just like a fiddle. 
The individuals and families huddled 
under the Del Rio Bridge—they were

trying to escape triple-digit tempera-
tures. 
It is hot in August and September in 
Texas, and they had little, if any, ac-
cess to food, clean water, or restrooms. 
It took a number of days before the De-
partment of Homeland Security was 
able to remove them from what the 
New York Times described as squalid 
conditions—truly, Third World condi-
tions. 
Now, President Biden has said to the 
migrants: Don’t come to the United 
States. But the fact is, what he says 
with his mouth, with his lips, is con-
tradicted by all of his policies and all 
of his action and inaction. 
Here, let me share a few headlines 
from the last several months: ‘‘Over-
whelmed Texas border community be-
gins busing migrants to Austin’’; ‘‘Mi-
grants freed without court notice— 
sometimes no paperwork’’; ‘‘Haitian 
migrants released in U.S. on ‘very, 
very large scale’.’’ 
Folks beyond our borders are reading 
this. Friends and family in the United 
States are communicating with poten-
tial migrants who have come across. 
Certainly, the human smugglers—the 
coyotes—who get rich and are getting 
richer with every person they smuggle 
into the United States, are reading 
these headlines and watching cable TV 
and talking to people inside the heart-
land of our country. The message they 
see with their own eyes or they hear 
from others contradicts this lip serv-
ice, really, that President Biden has 
been paying to border security. 
Like I said, this is especially true 
among the cartels and criminal organi-
zations that charge thousands of dol-
lars a head to bring folks from literally 
anywhere around the world. It just gets 
a little more expensive. If you want to 
come from, let’s say, the Middle East 
or if you want to come from, let’s say, 
Iran or Afghanistan, it is a little more 
expensive than if you just want to 
come from Mexico or Central America, 
but you can do it because the same net-
works and criminal organizations run 
those networks in those countries 
around the world. 
Last week, the Biden administration 
handed the cartels a big recruiting 
tool. 
Let me read you another headline: 
‘‘U.S. Will No Longer Deport Illegal 
Immigrants Based on Undocumented 
Status Alone.’’ 
That is what Secretary Mayorkas, 
the Secretary of the Department of 
Homeland Security, said: The U.S. 
Government will not enforce U.S. law. 
As if we needed to add any more to 
the chaos and the crisis on the border, 
Secretary Mayorkas has provided ex-
plicit confirmation that the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security will not 
enforce our immigration laws. His di-
rective strongly discourages Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement from 
even carrying out their most basic du-
ties. 
I know it seems like a long time ago, 
but it wasn’t that long ago when people 
said: ‘‘Abolish the police.’’ Before that, 
they said: ‘‘Abolish ICE,’’ Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement. But now 
they are, maybe, not so much intent on 
abolishing ICE as just telling them 
don’t do your job. Don’t enforce the 
very laws that we in Congress have 
made. 
Considering the fact that the border 
czar, Vice President HARRIS, once com-
pared ICE to the Ku Klux Klan, we 
probably should have seen this coming. 
Liberal activists can throw out their 
‘‘Abolish ICE’’ posters because the ad-
ministration is, effectively, nullifying 
the Agency from the inside. 
The reality of the situation, however 
inconvenient it may be, is that, by en-
tering the United States illegally, mi-
grants are breaking U.S. laws. We are 
fortunate, indeed, and grateful to the 
hard-working men and women of ICE 
and Customs and Border Protection, 
who are committed to enforcing our 
laws and keeping the American people 
safe, but they can’t do it when they are 
told don’t do your job or if the admin-
istration continues to denigrate these 
officers to try to shame them and to 
publicly criticize them for doing what 
we have asked them to do. 
Secretary Mayorkas’s decision not to 
enforce our immigration laws isn’t an 
example of prosecutorial discretion, 
which is the usual excuse; it is a viola-
tion of his oath. The Department of 
Homeland Security is charged with 
safeguarding the American people, but 
it can’t do it because of the direction of 
its own leadership—a member of Presi-
dent Biden’s Cabinet. 
There 
is 
nothing 
wrong 
with 
prioritizing the removal of the most 
dangerous criminals who are here ille-
gally. Previous administrations have 
prioritized 
certain 
categories, 
like 
those suspected of terrorism or others 
who could be a threat to our national 
security or public safety, but there is a 
difference between prioritizing and ex-
empting entire categories from en-
forcement altogether. 
Under this new guidance from Sec-
retary Mayorkas, ICE officers are dis-
couraged from arresting or removing 
illegal immigrants unless they have 
been convicted of a serious crime. It is 
unclear, though, whether domestic vio-
lence meets this criteria. Certainly, 
other crimes don’t. So it defies all 
common sense to ask our law enforce-
ment officers—that is what ICE officers 
are; they are law enforcement offi-
cers—to turn a blind eye to illegal con-
duct and not do what they have sworn 
to do in a professional oath. 
I am reminded of a controversial di-
rective issued by another one of Presi-
dent Biden’s nominees to enforce our 
Nation’s laws. Rachael Rollins was 
nominated to serve as the U.S. attor-
ney for Massachusetts and is currently 
the district attorney for Suffolk Coun-
ty—home to Boston. She is a current 
nominee from the Biden administra-
tion. 
Shortly after taking office as the 
Suffolk County district attorney for 
the State and local office, she released 
a memo that outlined more than a 
dozen crimes that should be ignored by 
law enforcement. This was the district 
attorney, who was charged with enforc-
ing the laws, saying to law enforce-
ment: Ignore the laws. 
According to Ms. Rollins, individuals 
who committed offenses like tres-
passing, shoplifting, larceny—that is 
stealing—wanton or malicious destruc-
tion of property or even possession 
with intent to distribute drugs should 
not be prosecuted. 
Again, I have no issue with law en-
forcement using limited resources to 
address the biggest threats and to 
prioritize their prosecution decisions, 
but they cannot, I believe, consistent 
with their oaths, exempt wholesale 
classes of criminals from enforcement. 
Under the Biden administration, we 
are already seeing a record-low number 
of deportations for people who violate 
our immigration laws. Back in April, 
as border crossings hit their highest 
level in 20 years, ICE removed the low-
est number of illegal immigrants on 
record. There is no coincidence there. 
The guidance from Secretary Mayorkas 
sends an unequivocal message to the 
entire world that, if you want to come 
to the United States illegally, you will 
be able to stay as long as you don’t get 
caught committing a murder or some 
other crime of a similar nature. 
The administration has 
tried 
to 
claim that this will not serve as a pull 
factor. That is what the Border Patrol 
talks about with the push factors—pov-
erty, violence, and maybe things like 
that which are the push factors for im-
migration—but they also talk about 
the pull factors, which are things that 
the migrants see and the smugglers see 
that will actually attract more illegal 
immigration to the United States. The 
administration has tried to claim that 
this refusal to enforce our immigration 
laws won’t act as an additional pull 
factor because, they say, the order only 
applies to immigrants who entered the 
United States before November 2020. 
But let’s consider some of the other 
things that have been said. For exam-
ple, Vice President HARRIS said mi-
grants should not come to the United 
States because they will be turned 
back. That is clearly not happening. 
That is clearly not the case. 
We were told that the Department of 
Homeland Security would use title 42, 
a public health law, to return the vast 
majority of Haitian migrants because, 
after all, while we are still dealing with 
the pandemic of COVID–19, these mi-
grants, by and large, aren’t vaccinated, 
and they are not tested for COVID–19 
when they are released into the inte-
rior of the United States. You would 
think that would be a problem for the 
Biden administration, but Secretary 
Mayorkas just flat lied to the Amer-
ican people when he said what would 
happen to the migrants from Haiti. 
Some 13,000 migrants from that group 
have been released into the interior of 
the United States before even appear-
ing in front of an immigration judge.

Clearly, that was a lie when he said 
they would be repatriated to their 
country of origin. So we have no reason 
to believe that things will be any dif-
ferent this time. 
The President can’t have it both 
ways. He can’t say he is taking a tough 
stance on illegal immigration to ap-
pease one wing of the Democratic 
Party while implementing policies that 
just encourage more illegal immigra-
tion to appease the other wing. 
The only way to address this crisis is 
to enforce our laws, not as the Biden 
administration wishes they were writ-
ten. If we are going to have any hope of 
managing the current crisis and the ad-
ditional crisis that will necessarily fol-
low, deterrence is a key. 
As the Border Patrol told me, there 
have to be consequences for illegal im-
migration. 
If 
there 
are 
no 
con-
sequences, people are going to continue 
to come in greater and greater num-
bers. 
Albert Einstein reportedly once said: 
Insanity is doing the same thing over 
and over again and expecting different 
results. 
Unless the administration backs up 
their ‘‘do not come’’ statements with 
actions which actually send the same 
message, we are going to continue 
down this very dangerous road. 
What will need to happen next before 
the administration takes this crisis se-
riously? More than 200,000 border cross-
ings during each of the last 2 months 
didn’t get their attention nor did the 
group of 30,000 migrants in Del Rio, TX, 
in a matter of days. So you can’t help 
but ask: How many more migrants will 
have to suffer before President Biden 
and Vice President HARRIS finally back 
up their empty statements with ac-
tion? 
We stand ready to help and to work 
on a bipartisan basis. As a matter of 
fact, Senator SINEMA and I, along with 
our colleagues HENRY
CUELLAR
and 
TONY GONZALEZ in the House, have a 
bipartisan-bicameral border solutions 
bill. It is not perfect, and it doesn’t an-
swer all the questions, but it is a good 
place to start. So far, we have heard 
nothing but crickets from the adminis-
tration. Apparently, they don’t care 
about the status quo and, so far, seem 
unwilling to do anything differently to 
correct it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to conclude my re-
marks today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I just 
listened to my colleague from Texas 
talk about what is going on at the bor-
der. I thought he made a lot of really 
good points, and I appreciate his will-
ingness not just to talk about this 
issue and the crisis we have on our 
southern border but also to talk about 
solutions. 
One of the solutions he talked about 
and I have heard about a lot recently— 
I am the ranking Republican on the 
Homeland Security Committee. In the 
last week, I have had the opportunity 
to speak with both the current Border 
Patrol Chief and also the recently re-
tired Border Patrol Chief about what is 
happening on the border and the real- 
world problems that it is creating. 
One thing they tell me is, just let us 
finish the small parts of the wall that 
haven’t been completed because it is 
impossible for us to enforce the laws if 
you have these openings. Secondly, 
they said: Please let us complete the 
technology. 
On both sides of this aisle, we have 
agreed, in the past, that, even if we dis-
agree on having a fence along any parts 
of the border, including the urban 
areas, we will agree on the technology 
that ought to go with it. 
They told me these stories that I had 
confirmed when I was down at the bor-
der earlier this year in that the tech-
nology that goes with it—the remote 
sensing cameras, the remote sensors in 
the ground, and so on—were stopped as 
soon as the Biden administration came 
in even though they were already paid 
for. So it wasn’t just stopping con-
struction; it was, in effect, in my view, 
more important that they have actu-
ally stopped the technology that is 
needed to be able to protect the border. 
Senator CORNYN talked about how he 
and Senator SINEMA have worked on 
legislation to deal with some of these 
issues. I appreciate that because that is 
what is needed. We need to make some 
changes. We can’t just continue to do 
what we are doing because we have 
over 200,000 people a month now com-
ing over—unprecedented numbers. Usu-
ally, in the summer, those numbers go 
down a lot, but they have actually in-
creased this summer. 
We also need to fix a broken asylum 
system. This should not be a partisan 
issue. 
It is obviously not working. People 
come to our border. They claim asy-
lum. They are allowed to come into the 
United States. They are told, you 
know: Please go to an immigration of-
fice and check in, but 4 or 5 years until 
your immigration case is likely to be 
heard, sometimes longer. 
Meanwhile, these folks are in the 
United States. 
And then at the end of the process, 
even though those who end up going 
through the court system are self-se-
lected because they are the folks who 
more likely—I think are more likely to 
have an asylum claim that is valid— 
but even when you go all the way 
through that process, guess what. Only 
15 percent of those from countries like 
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador— 
the so-called Northern Triangle coun-
tries—or other countries like Ecuador, 
only 15 percent are granted asylum by 
an immigration judge. 
But, meanwhile, everybody is in the 
United States. And as I said earlier, 
the internal enforcement is not occur-
ring, so people are literally not being 
told they have got to go back. And 
often, obviously, not identified be-
cause, after 4 or 5 years, many people 
are embedded in our community. 
So the asylum system has become a 
pull factor, and we need to realize that. 
I was in four countries in Latin 
America 
earlier 
this 
year—Mexico, 
Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador—and I 
heard from every one of the Presidents 
in those countries, the same thing in 
different ways, but the same thing, 
which is: You guys are pulling our peo-
ple to your southern border because 
the traffickers, the smugglers, the 
coyotes, who are making all this 
money, are coming to our families and 
saying: Hey, come to the border. Give 
me 10,000 bucks. I will take your kids 
there. I can get them into school in the 
interior of the United States, and they 
are right. 
Their narrative might not be exactly 
right. I am sure they exaggerate. But 
as a whole, what they are saying is cor-
rect. In other words, our system is so 
broken that these people who are ex-
ploiting poor people all over Latin 
America and elsewhere now—all over 
the world they are starting to come 
through our border in bigger numbers— 
are able to say: If you come with me, I 
will get you in. 
That is because the asylum system is 
broken. So until we fix the asylum sys-
tem, we can do everything else we are 
talking about—I don’t think this is 
going to work. 
And by the way, when I talk to my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
about this, when I talk to Secretary 
Mayorkas about it, they acknowledge 
this is broken. I mean, you have to. 
The 13,000 Haitians that just came 
into our country, that walked in, were 
given a bus ticket or a plane ride and 
told: Here is an immigration office. 
Please check in. 
My understanding is the vast major-
ity of those people had applied for asy-
lum, and we said: Come on in. 
And in 4 or 5 years, their case may be 
heard. And if they come to that trial, 
many of them will be deemed, just as 
the Central Americans are deemed, to 
be economic refugees. 
Look, if you or I were in Central 
America and knew we could better our-
selves and our family and take care of 
our kids by coming to the United 
States, wouldn’t we make the same de-
cision? 
But don’t we also in the United 
States have an obligation to have an 
orderly, legal way to do that? 
And we have one. We are the most 
generous country in the world in terms 
of taking in immigrants. And I am a 
strong supporter of the legal immigra-
tion system. But we have got to have a 
proper way to do it. It has got to be 
legal. Otherwise, again, people are 
going to be exploited. 
This trip north is not a safe trip. It is 
a dangerous trip, and people die in the 
desert. These kids are not treated well. 
Many are assaulted. 
I did a study on this when I was head 
of the Permanent Subcommittee of In-
vestigations. We did two reports. One

was on kids who were taken into HHS 
custody at the border, and then when 
they were sent out to their sponsors— 
because that is what happens. You go 
to the Border Patrol, then HHS, then 
you are sent out to sponsors. 
You know who the sponsors were? 
The very traffickers who had brought 
them up—in this case, from Guate-
mala—who were exploiting them. 
And those same traffickers took 
those kids and took them to an egg 
farm, where they had to work 11, 12 
hours a day, no school, paid little or 
nothing, living on bare mattresses un-
derneath trailers. 
Finally, luckily, a local law enforce-
ment official figured out what was 
going on and was able to save these 
kids. 
But that is not a system we should 
want in America. We should want a 
legal, orderly system that works for 
everybody. By the way, including the 
many, many people around the world 
who are waiting in line patiently to 
come to the United States through 
legal means. 
So I hadn’t meant to talk about this 
today, but I appreciate the fact that 
my colleague mentioned it. And I do 
think it is very important that, on a 
bipartisan basis, we put aside our polit-
ical rhetoric on this and talk about so-
lutions. 
I think we should go back to a sys-
tem where we are encouraging people 
to apply for asylum in their home 
country, and, second, to do it from 
third countries. If they are not com-
fortable doing it in their home country 
because they really are feeling per-
secuted for some reason, do it in a 
third country. 
Those agreements were in place dur-
ing the Trump administration. They 
were starting to work. They have now 
been ended. And then if you come to 
the border, have the adjudication be 
immediate. Let’s spend the money to 
have the processing centers there at 
the border so people aren’t waiting 4, 5, 
6 years to go to their immigration 
hearing that they may or may not at-
tend, as you can understand. 
Instead say: You want to come as an 
asylee? Here is the system. Your adju-
dication is going to occur right now. 
And for those who apply and are suc-
cessful—which, again, is about 15 per-
cent of people from the countries that 
are sending most of these migrants— 
then you would come in as an asylee 
and you would have the ability to be 
resettled legally and you would have 
the ability to work. 
But if you are one of the 85 percent, 
you would be told: Sorry, you didn’t 
make the standards. You have got to 
go back home, and you can apply le-
gally, and here is the way you do it. 
Wouldn’t that make more sense for 
our country? 
By the way, there is now a backlog of 
1.3 million people waiting for these 
asylum hearings—1.3 million people. 
And it is growing every day. 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
Mr. President, I had planned today to 
talk about something else, which is the 
tax situation that we are facing with 
this new proposal from the Democrats. 
You probably heard about the Build 
Back Better legislation, also some-
times called the reconciliation bill. It 
is in reconciliation because it wouldn’t 
require any Republican votes, and 
Democrats are proposing to take this 
through Congress, much as they did in 
March with the $1.9 trillion legislation. 
This is also called the $3.5 trillion 
bill, this Build Back Better. Actually, I 
would argue it is a lot more than 3.5 
trillion when you look at the actual 
spending in it. 
But let’s focus on the tax side for a 
moment because that is how it is in-
tended to be paid for. 
The tax hikes, which would be the 
largest tax increases in America in at 
least 50 years, systematically dis-
mantle a lot of the pro-growth and pro- 
job reforms that were put in place in 
2017. 
Why do I call them pro-growth and 
pro-jobs? 
Because they worked. They helped 
Americans keep more of their hard- 
earned earnings. They helped busi-
nesses to be more successful, to hire 
more people and increase wages. And 
they are a big reason that, as of Feb-
ruary of 2020—the month that we went 
into in this pandemic, as of February 
2020—we had 19 straight months in this 
country of wage growth of over 3 per-
cent per annum—19 straight months. 
But what all of us should want—Re-
publican, Democrat, all of us—higher 
wages. And by the way, most of that 
wage growth went to lower- and mid-
dle-income Americans. 
That is what we should want too, 
right? 
That was happening. In fact, as of 
that point, we had the lowest poverty 
rate in the history of America. We 
started keeping track of it back in the 
fifties. It was the lowest poverty rate 
ever. This was just a year or so ago. 
This was before the pandemic hit. 
We also had a 50-year low in unem-
ployment—the lowest unemployment 
ever—for certain groups: Blacks, His-
panics, disabled, others. 
So this is something that was an 
achievement, that met the standards 
that we talk about on both sides of the 
aisle—more 
economic 
opportunity, 
closing the wage gap, giving people a 
chance to come off the sidelines and 
get a job. Things were happening, and 
in large measure, because of these 2017 
reforms. 
And yet, in this proposal that is now 
being proposed, called the Build Back 
Better proposal, there are tax increases 
that dismantle much of the reform in 
2017 that caused this economic growth. 
U.S.-based corporations are going to 
have a really hard time competing now 
in the global economy again because it 
takes our tax rate back up to being the 
highest, depending on where they end 
up in terms of their rate—one of the 
highest or the highest rate in the en-
tire world. 
The average corporate tax rate under 
the Ways and Means proposal will be 32 
percent again—back up into the thir-
ties—instead of an average of 21 per-
cent, plus about 5 points on the State 
average, which is about 26 percent. 
So, again, it puts us in a position 
where we are not competitive with the 
rest of the world. That is why we 
changed it back in 2017. In fact, accord-
ing to the International Tax Competi-
tiveness Index, the Democrats’ plan 
would cause the United States to drop 
steeply down the rankings from 21st in 
the world to 28th in the world among 
developing countries in terms of com-
petitiveness of our Tax Code. 
Once again, as happened too often be-
fore the 2017 reforms—and, by the way, 
has not happened since then—compa-
nies will choose to say: OK. I am out of 
here. 
Because of the Tax Code and the tax 
changes that they want to make, com-
panies will say, as they did before 2017, 
because of the tax laws: I can’t be com-
petitive as an American company. I am 
going to go be a company of some other 
country. 
It is called inversions. Sounds bad, 
and it is. Nobody wanted inversions. 
Democrats, Republicans, we all hated 
them. Guess what. We stopped them. 
After the 2017 reforms, they stopped. 
Miraculously, we had companies in 
Ohio that chose to do that. It was ter-
rible. They chose to actually become 
foreign companies because our Tax 
Code was so uncompetitive. We can’t 
let that happen again. 
Small businesses, which make up 
about 99 percent of the business in 
America, and they account for about 
two-thirds of the jobs in America—and, 
by the way, most of the job growth is 
in small businesses—are also hit hard 
by these tax increases. 
The vast majority of small businesses 
are structured as what you call pass- 
throughs. In other words, they don’t 
pay taxes at the company level; the in-
dividuals who own the company pay 
the taxes. That is the vast majority of 
companies in America. 
So when you raise individual income 
taxes, guess what happens. You are 
socking it to not just the wealthy or 
whoever you are trying to sock it to; 
you are socking it to small business be-
cause that is, again, the vast majority 
of businesses in America, most of the 
employees. And that is how they are 
taxed, down to the individual level. 
To make matters worse, the Biden 
administration seems intent on ending 
section 199A, which is a deduction we 
put in place on purpose to help small 
businesses kind of level the playing 
field between big businesses and small 
businesses. They are actually talking 
about getting rid of that deduction. So 
for small businesses listening today, be 
aware. 
In all, the more successful pass- 
through companies should expect their 
Federal tax rate to rise from about 29.6 
percent today to about 46.4 percent 
under the Democrats’ new plan—46.4 
percent taxation on small business. 
How does that make sense?

October 7, 2021 
So I think what is going to happen is 
you will see a lot of small businesses go 
out of business if this happens and cer-
tainly not be able to create new jobs 
and the opportunity that we saw dur-
ing the 2018, 2019 time period. 
But it is not just larger and small 
businesses that are going to feel the 
impact of these tax hikes. American 
workers and families will find them-
selves losing more of their hard-earned 
cash from all sides, thanks to the 
across-the-board tax increases, whether 
in estate taxes, capital gains taxes, re-
tirement account taxes, the marriage 
tax, cigarette excise taxes—the list 
goes on and on. 
It is no surprise, then, that contrary 
to what President Biden has repeatedly 
said, according to the nonpartisan 
Joint Committee on Taxation—they 
are the people up here on the Hill who 
tell us what the impact is of tax law 
changes. The Joint Committee on Tax-
ation, analyzing this tax proposal that 
is out there already—this is the Demo-
crat tax proposal of the Ways and 
Means Committee—they say a lot of 
taxpayers who make less than $400,000 
a year are going to see higher taxes. 
Some percentage of taxpayers in 
every bracket will see tax rates go up, 
even folks making between 40,000 and 
50,000 a year, according to the distribu-
tion tables by the Joint Committee on 
Taxation. 
More than one in three taxpayers 
making between $100,000 and $200,000 
per year will be paying higher taxes in 
2023—more than one in three. By 2031, 
more than three-quarters of those mid-
dle-class taxpayers will be paying high-
er taxes. 
This is according to the Joint Com-
mittee. I encourage you to go on their 
website. Joint Committee on Taxation, 
JCT.org. 
So even working-class families are 
going to end up paying some of the 
price of this spending spree in the form 
of higher taxes. But all of us have to 
pay an additional price in damage to 
our economy. 
According to the Tax Foundation, 
the combined long-run effects of the 
tax hikes include a decline in our long- 
run gross domestic product of 0.98 per-
cent. So about a 1-percent decline in 
our GDP—wow—a decline of the wage 
rate of about 0.68 percent, and a loss of 
303,000 full-time jobs. 
So this is the Tax Foundation ana-
lyzing what the effects of this would be 
in addition to what I have talked about 
in terms of the tax hikes. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation 
has looked at this and said: Well, if you 
raise taxes on corporations, it is going 
to come primarily out of the pockets of 
the workers, and that is a lot of these 
middle-class families. But also it is 
going to reduce our economy. It is 
going to decline our wages. And it is 
going to result in a loss of over 300,000 
full-time jobs. 
That is the Tax Foundation. 
So, to be honest, I am not exactly 
sure where the President got the no-
tion he has been repeating lately that 
the price tag on this $3.5 trillion— 
maybe $5 trillion; I don’t know; de-
pending on how you look at the spend-
ing—is zero dollars. That is what he 
said. It is zero dollars. 
Even by their own admission, the big 
tax hikes we are talking about here are 
not going to cover all the spending, No. 
1. But more importantly, billions of 
dollars lost in economic growth, a sig-
nificant decline in wages, and hundreds 
of thousands of jobs lost doesn’t sound 
like zero to me; it sounds like a bad 
deal for the American people. 
So, along with my Republican col-
leagues, we have to keep telling the 
American people what is in this tax 
proposal and urging people to learn 
more about how these new taxes are 
going to affect them, their businesses, 
and their communities, and weigh in 
with their representatives in Congress. 
Why would the American people sup-
port tax hikes that are going to be bad 
for workers and bad for our businesses? 
We have a responsibility to our con-
stituents to ensure that does not hap-
pen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2846 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, President 
Biden announced his vague, still-un-
written mandate for the vaccine just 
almost a month ago. He said then, at 
the time of his announcement, that his 
‘‘patience was wearing thin.’’ Those are 
his words, not mine. Yet, oddly, Presi-
dent Biden’s administration is now in 
no particular rush to implement the 
rule. So almost a month has now 
elapsed, but there is still no rule and 
therefore no implementation of the 
rule. Perhaps President Biden and 
those who work with him are realizing 
what 
countless 
Americans 
already 
know: that the mandate was not well 
thought out. 
First, neither the President of the 
United States specifically nor the Fed-
eral Government generally has the au-
thority to issue a sweeping vaccine 
mandate of this nature. The Constitu-
tion doesn’t empower the Federal Gov-
ernment and certainly not the Presi-
dent individually, acting in isolation, 
with the right, the authority, or the 
power to broadly dictate personal med-
ical decisions for all Americans with 
the stroke of the Executive pen. 
I spoke earlier this week and I also 
spoke last week about individuals with 
religious, moral, and medical reasons 
to forgo vaccinations. The President’s 
mandate ignores their concerns and 
their rights. 
Much of corporate America is already 
starting to fire unvaccinated workers 
despite the legitimate religious, moral, 
or health concerns that those workers 
might have. Some are even being 
charged fees for being married to an 
unvaccinated spouse. So it is not just 
their 
decisions 
but 
that 
of 
their 
spouses that are causing them to con-
front adverse action from their em-
ployer, all as a result of this mandate— 
a mandate which doesn’t yet exist. 
Even though time was of the essence a 
month ago when it was issued, there is 
still no rule and still nothing to en-
force, but people are starting to en-
force what they think will be in the 
rule if and when it ever does get pro-
mulgated. 
In recent days, I have heard from 
over 200 Utahns who are at risk of los-
ing their jobs due to this mandate. 
They are scared of becoming not just 
unemployed but unemployable—unem-
ployable, second-class outcasts due to 
the President’s order. 
Have we lost compassion? Have we 
lost all reason? Troublingly, it seems 
that these mandates aren’t based in 
reason. The mandate completely ig-
nores the millions of Americans who 
have previously contracted and recov-
ered from COVID–19. These people have 
antibodies against the virus. 
In other countries where significant 
research on natural immunity has been 
conducted, the results are compelling. 
A study conducted in Italy shows that 
natural immunity is more effective 
than vaccines at reducing risk of fu-
ture infection. Another study of half a 
million people in Denmark has shown 
that natural immunity provides sig-
nificant, lasting protection against in-
fection. Finally, a study from three 
separate hospitals in Israel found that 
natural immunity from a previous 
COVID infection was ‘‘27 times more ef-
fective than vaccinated immunity in 
preventing symptomatic infections.’’ 
But the President’s mandate announce-
ment makes no mention of natural im-
munity—no mention whatsoever. Our 
entire national health apparatus seems 
to disregard the significant protection 
individuals have if they previously had 
and recovered from COVID. 
Now, I believe the vaccines are gen-
erally safe and effective. I have been 
vaccinated. Every member of my fam-
ily has been vaccinated, with my en-
couragement. I see these vaccines as a 
miracle, one that is helping to protect 
millions and millions of Americans— 
hundreds of millions of Americans, for 
that matter. But I also recognize that 
millions of Americans are already pro-
tected by their natural defenses be-
cause they contracted COVID, before 
the vaccines were available in many in-
stances, and they have recovered and 
therefore have natural immunity. The 
science shows that this immunity is 
strong, that it is effective, and that it 
is widespread in America. 
So I, today, am offering a bill that 
would require Federal Agencies to rec-
ognize, accept, truthfully characterize, 
and include natural immunity in any 
regulation. This bill does not say that 
vaccines are bad or unhelpful; it mere-
ly asks the Federal Government to re-
spect widely available science. 
I am glad to be joined in this effort 
by Senators BRAUN, TUBERVILLE, and 
SULLIVAN as cosponsors. 
The bill would allow us to keep 
Americans employed and help us beat

the pandemic in a smart way, in a rea-
soned, rational way, and in a compas-
sionate way. 
Now, I believe—in fact, I am quite 
confident that the mandate in its en-
tirety will be struck down as unconsti-
tutional, as having been issued outside 
the authority of the President of the 
United 
States. 
This 
simple 
bill 
wouldn’t undo the whole thing, as I be-
lieve the courts are certain ultimately 
to do. This simple bill is narrow, and it 
would simply give peace of mind to 
Americans and employers by recog-
nizing and upholding evidence-based 
realities concerning our natural de-
fense to COVID. It is a commonsense 
proposal, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on HELP be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 2846 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. 
I ask unanimous consent that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, unfortu-
nately, even though the Senate has had 
multiple exposures now to nonsense 
ideas like this bill, they keep coming 
back. 
Now, Agencies like the CDC and NIH 
are already looking closely at data on 
COVID infection and natural immu-
nity. They have been since the earliest 
days of this pandemic. 
In an August ‘‘Morbidity and Mor-
tality Weekly Report,’’ CDC assessed 
data from Kentucky and found that out 
of a group of people who had been in-
fected with COVID before, those who 
were unvaccinated were twice as likely 
to get COVID again than the people 
who were vaccinated. In other words, 
being unvaccinated puts you at higher 
risk of being reinfected, period. 
Getting vaccinated is a necessary 
step to protect you but also to protect 
those around you. 
We are in the middle of the deadliest 
pandemic in American history. It has 
now killed 700,000 people and counting. 
If we are going to end this thing, if we 
are going to reopen our economy, if we 
are going to save lives, we need to get 
everyone vaccinated when they are eli-
gible. 
We don’t need politicians suggesting 
they know more than those experts and 
ignoring the data. We don’t need bills 
meant to weaken one of our strongest 
tools to get this thing behind us, like 
the ones that Republicans have repeat-
edly been pressing for. 
Workplace safety standards are noth-
ing new in this country. Immunization 
requirements are nothing new in this 
country. And let’s be clear. The vac-
cine requirements President Biden has 
enacted so far include tailored exemp-
tions for legitimate religious and med-
ical considerations that have long been 
standard. The emergency temporary 
standard he has envisioned would allow 
testing as an alternative. 
People are dying every day. Families 
are scared, and they are tired, and they 
are angry that even as they try so hard 
to do the right thing so we can end this 
crisis, their hard work is being under-
mined. 
So can the Republicans stop the the-
atrics and stop wasting our time? Can 
they stop pretending they know more 
than the experts about this disease? Is 
that too much to ask? 
It isn’t, and I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the insight and the thoughtful atten-
tion paid to this matter by my friend 
and distinguished colleague, the Sen-
ator from Washington. 
I respectfully submit that we are not 
dealing with theatrics when it comes 
to hard-working Americans, including 
the more than 200 Utahns whom I have 
heard from just in the last 2 weeks, 
who are losing their jobs or are at im-
mediate risk for doing so based on a de-
cision forced upon them by an action 
that has been threatened but not taken 
and in no way legally articulated by 
the President of the United States. 
These are not theatrics for those who 
are losing their jobs. That is just not 
an accurate portrayal, and it really is 
disrespectful to those who are enduring 
that. To them, these are not theatrics. 
To them, this is their ability to make 
a living. 
As far as the characterization that 
these claims of natural immunity are 
one off, I have yet to see any study 
that refutes the studies I referenced a 
moment ago—not the one from Den-
mark, not the one from Italy, and not 
the one from Israel that shows the sig-
nificant immunity benefits conferred 
by a previous COVID infection, one 
from which a person has fully recov-
ered. In the case of at least two of 
those studies—the one from Italy and 
the one from Israel—the immunity is 
as strong if not stronger. In fact, the 
one from Israel concluded that it is 27 
times more protective. 
Yet we continue to hear efforts like 
this one today characterized as ‘‘theat-
rics,’’ characterized as ‘‘nonsense ideas 
like this bill’’—bills that try, in the 
case of the bill that we are talking 
about today, to protect the employ-
ment rights and the personal decisions 
of Americans who have natural immu-
nity or, as in previous bills, those who 
have a legitimate medical concern, es-
pecially where that concern is one that 
has been taken on the advice of a 
board-certified physician who has ad-
vised them, based on a preexisting 
medical condition, not to get it. 
I also heard that the President has 
indicated that there would be excep-
tions. We don’t know what those excep-
tions are. Many of those exceptions are 
not being honored by those segments of 
corporate America already moving to 
implement and enforce this vaccine 
mandate. 
What is happening is that HR depart-
ments and general counsel’s offices in 
large corporations—those with more 
than 99 employees—are understandably 
trying to get ahead of this so that they 
are not behind when the rule actually 
issues, so they won’t run any risk of 
the aggressive, heavy fines with which 
they have already been threatened. So 
for that reason, many of them are try-
ing to get ahead of it, and many of 
them are now using President Biden’s 
speech about the yet-to-exist rule, and 
they are either threatening to fire or 
preparing to fire or in some cases al-
ready have fired people regardless of 
any exceptions that they think they 
ought to be entitled to. It is easier for 
the corporation, in some instances, 
perhaps, or maybe more convenient or 
maybe more in conformity with the 
liking of the individuals making the 
decision to do that, but it is not fair to 
the workers. It is especially not fair in 
light of the fact that all of these ac-
tions are being undertaken in response 
to a yet-to-exist rule promulgated by 
an executive branch Agency that has 
yet to act at the behest of the Presi-
dent of the United States—one person 
without statutory authority and with-
out constitutional authority to do this. 
That is tragic. 
Because he doesn’t have the author-
ity to do this, it shouldn’t happen at 
all. At a minimum, we, as the law-
making body within the Federal Gov-
ernment, have an obligation to take it 
down. Even if we can’t take it all down 
or to stop it, we at least have an obli-
gation to try to make its effects less 
draconian, less hurtful, and less harm-
ful to individuals who, by no choice of 
their own and no fault of their own, 
aren’t in a position to get this, whether 
because of religious convictions, nat-
ural immunity, or a health condition 
or something else. 
It is tragic. We are better than this. 
We should be acting to protect Ameri-
cans, not make them more vulnerable. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here to talk about the Presi-
dent’s Build Back Better agenda and 
its importance to our country. 
We have heard a lot over the last 
couple of months about the new jobs 
that that plan will bring. It is esti-
mated by economists that it will gen-
erate 4 million jobs every year for the 
next 10 years. That is because we are 
going to be investing in modernizing 
our infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6972 
October 7, 2021 
We have already heard about the im-
portant work to modernize our roads 
and our bridges, expand our transit sys-
tems, build out the infrastructure of 
the 21st century, including high-speed 
internet to every American household 
and every small business. 
We have talked about the importance 
of deploying a clean energy grid and 
making sure that we move toward a 
clean energy economy. That will put 
millions of Americans to work in good- 
paying jobs. If you are generating that 
kind of economic activity, that kind of 
wage opportunity, obviously, that is 
good for every American household and 
brings in more income. 
But, today, I am going to gather with 
some of my colleagues, organized by 
the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR, who will join us shortly, to 
talk about how the Build Back Better 
agenda will not just generate millions 
of jobs and good-paying jobs, but help 
the dollars that Americans have in 
their pockets and bank accounts travel 
faster, how it is going to save them 
money. 
Now, one way it is going to save 
money is for families with kids. They 
are going to get a tax cut. In fact, that 
tax cut was put in place as part of the 
American Rescue Plan that we passed 
earlier this year. As a result of a tax 
cut for families with kids, families 
around the country right now are get-
ting up to $300 per child to help cover 
the everyday costs of raising kids and 
addressing the needs of a family. 
That will also cut child poverty in 
half, but only for this year. It is cur-
rently scheduled to terminate at the 
end of this year, that tax cut for Amer-
ican families with kids. So one of the 
things we do in the Build Back Better 
agenda is extend that for many years 
because it doesn’t make sense to have 
that terminate and have those families 
stuck with all those additional costs. 
But there is also another way that 
the Build Back Better agenda is going 
to help every dollar that comes into 
the family bank account go farther, 
and that is by reducing the costs that 
they face in so many of their everyday 
household expenditures. 
I want to focus on a couple of areas. 
One is in the area of childcare, one is in 
the area of healthcare and prescription 
drugs, and the other is the energy costs 
and gas costs that so many families 
face. The Build Back Better agenda is 
going to lower the costs for American 
families in those areas so that the in-
come they have will go much further. 
I want to start with childcare be-
cause working parents with infant chil-
dren are scraping by today to pay for 
childcare, paying, on average, $1,300 
every month to get licensed care. 
Under the Build Back Better agenda, 
if you look at the projections, you will 
see that Marylanders—families in my 
State 
of 
Maryland—will 
see 
their 
childcare bills cut nearly in half with 
weekly savings of $141 every week. 
That is $7,322 a year for childcare 
costs—lowering of childcare costs for 
those families. 
If you think about the need to try to 
get more people in the workforce, it is 
understandable that if you are a parent 
with kids, you want to make sure that 
when you go into the workforce, your 
kids have an affordable and secure 
place during the day. And right now 
that is not an option for millions of 
American families. So one of the 
things this proposal does, the Build 
Back Better plan, is dramatically re-
duce those costs for childcare. 
The proposal will also cut prescrip-
tion drug costs for seniors. We have 
been having a debate for years about 
the need to allow Medicare to nego-
tiate for lower drug prices on behalf of 
all of us, on behalf of all the bene-
ficiaries in Medicare. 
The Veterans’ Administration nego-
tiates drug prices for veterans who are 
in their care, and yet we don’t allow 
Medicare to negotiate drug prices. This 
is nuts. And it runs up the costs for 
Medicare because if you don’t get to 
negotiate price, the pharmaceutical 
companies get to set the price wher-
ever they want. So this proposal, the 
Build Back Better plan, will cut those 
costs and reduce prescription drug 
costs for Part D premiums by 15 per-
cent. 
We are also proposing to expand 
Medicare to cover vision, dental, and 
hearing services. This is a big gap in 
the current Medicare Program. Right 
now, seniors, on average, each year, are 
paying $914 out of pocket for hearing 
services, $874 for dental services, and 
$230 for vision services. Our proposal 
would cover that big gap in the Medi-
care Program. 
I am going to talk for one moment 
about energy prices because we all 
know we have to move to a clean en-
ergy economy. We are going to make it 
easier to do that as we put more Amer-
icans to work in that area. 
One of the things that is proposed is 
a generous electric vehicle tax credit of 
up to $12,500. This will make it easier 
for Americans to afford those cars. It is 
much easier to run a car on cheaper 
electricity than on gas. 
But it is also going to help folks who 
continue to drive their gas-powered 
cars for years to come, because if we 
get more people into electric cars, that 
means less demand for gas, and so that 
means the folks who continue to drive 
in their gas cars will get lower gas 
prices. And we all know that gas prices 
have been on the rise. 
Finally, talking about energy sav-
ings—you know, the best way to save 
energy money is to make sure that we 
don’t waste as much energy. All of us 
know that we have homes, in many 
cases they are not that well insulated. 
So part of this plan also includes help 
to homeowners to more cheaply make 
their homes energy efficient. That 
means, with a given amount of power, 
they will heat their homes at cheaper 
costs because there will be less wasted 
energy. 
In situation after situation, if you 
look at this bill, not only will it gen-
erate more jobs at better wages, not 
only will it provide working families 
with kids with tax cuts, but it will also 
help Americans save money on every-
thing 
from 
prescription 
drugs 
to 
childcare, to energy prices, and many 
others. 
That is what economists have said, 
and that is especially true because we 
are going to pay for this by finally re-
quiring big corporations to pay their 
fair share and not allow them to hide 
so many of their profits offshore in 
places like Bermuda and the Cayman 
Islands. And we are going to ask the 
very wealthiest, billionaires, to also 
pay more for the success of the entire 
country. 
So I just want to emphasize the 
fact—because we hear so much misin-
formation in this Chamber about what 
is in the Build Back Better agenda— 
that in addition to the jobs and higher 
wages, it is also going to help save fam-
ilies money on their bills so that their 
dollars will travel farther. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, let 
me start by asking unanimous consent 
that the vote on the motion to dis-
charge the Lhamon nomination occur 
at 3:30 p.m. today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to talk about the oppor-
tunity we have before us to deliver re-
sults for the people we work for. 
Right now, too many Americans are 
struggling to make ends meet and get 
ahead because of the cost and avail-
ability of childcare, healthcare, home 
care, and prescription drugs. 
In my home State of Wisconsin, peo-
ple like Zena, a human resources rep-
resentative from Twin Lakes, needs us 
to pass the Build Back Better Budget 
that invests in working families. 
Zena has been battling several severe 
autoimmune diseases, and she has been 
battling this for more than 15 years. 
She fell very ill after contracting 
norovirus, and she was unable to work 
and ultimately lost her job, as well as 
her 
employer-sponsored 
healthcare 
that came with it. 
Sick and uninsured, she turned to our 
State’s BadgerCare program for help. 
But because the Republicans in the 
Wisconsin State Legislature have re-
fused a Federal investment to fully ex-
pand Medicaid coverage, Zena was 
locked out of the program and unable 
to access necessary healthcare cov-
erage. Like millions of Americans, 
Zena found herself in the Medicaid cov-
erage gap and was forced to make 
choices that no one living in the 
United States should have to face, 
choices like paying for life-sustaining 
medication or paying her mortgage. 
Right now, the people we work for 
are paying two to three times more for 
their prescription drugs than people in

other wealthy countries. This needs to 
change, and we have an opportunity to 
get the job done if we simply make the 
superwealthy and most profitable cor-
porations, like the big drug companies, 
pay their fair share of taxes. 
For years, Congress has been talking 
about lowering the cost of prescription 
drugs, so let’s finally do it by giving 
Medicare the power to negotiate lower 
prescription drug prices that will save 
taxpayers money. Let’s stand on the 
side of seniors, who should no longer be 
at the mercy of Big Pharma. 
In addition to lowering the cost of 
needed medications, our Build Back 
Better budget provides the opportunity 
to expand Medicare benefits to include 
vision, dental, and hearing. The last 
time I checked, your ears, eyes, and 
teeth are all a part of your overall 
health, and there is no good reason not 
to include them in Medicare coverage. 
Right now, the United States is also 
in the midst of a long-term care and 
caregiving crisis. Hundreds of thou-
sands of older adults and people with 
disabilities who need and qualify for 
home- and community-based care serv-
ices are unable to access them. I know 
something about this. I was my grand-
mother’s caregiver, and I know first-
hand the challenges that family care-
givers face. 
But we can do something about this, 
and we should, with Build Back Better 
legislation that invests in long-term 
care; creates new, good-paying home- 
care jobs; and raises wages for care 
workers who often work around the 
clock to care for our loved ones yet live 
in poverty. 
All of this and more is doable if 
Washington finally says we are not 
going to continue spending trillions of 
taxpayer dollars on tax loopholes and 
tax giveaways for huge, profitable cor-
porations, millionaires, and billion-
aires. 
This is all to say that we face an ur-
gent choice: Do we work for the power-
ful special interests who have too much 
influence in Washington, or do we work 
for people like Zena and others like her 
who simply look for a little help from 
us to even the playing field and to get 
ahead? 
This is our moment to prove to the 
American people—to people like Zena— 
that their government works for them, 
not just those at the top. I have faith 
that we can do this for Zena, for Wis-
consin, and for the millions of Ameri-
cans counting on us to get the job done 
for them. 
I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, as we go over the wonderful 
things that Build Back Better offers— 
including tax benefits for families with 
children, support for home care and 
childcare for family members, lower 
prescription drug costs—I want to 
focus on a particular area, which is the 
addiction crisis, which grinds on in 
Rhode Island. I think every Member of 
this body knows a family who has been 
touched by this crisis. 
I remember visiting the small town 
of Burrillville, RI, a close-knit commu-
nity. People know one another there. 
On January 1, 2015, no one would have 
known that half a dozen people would 
die in Burrillville of drug overdoses in 
the next 3 months. That went through 
that community just in a heart-
breaking wave, and it remains bur-
dened by addiction and overdose. 
We have made a lot of gains since 
then. The CARA bill that Senator 
PORTMAN and I did, CARA 2.0, which 
was baked into the SUPPORT Act, 
shifted the way we think about addic-
tion so we don’t see it as a moral fail-
ing. We recognize its medical nature. 
We recognize, frankly, the noble nature 
of the path to recovery that people 
have to walk. We invested in preven-
tion and education and treatment. 
But still there is a massive gap that 
remains between the needs of families 
who have a member who is facing ad-
diction and the care and support that 
we give them, and Build Back Better 
makes some really important steps for 
those families—first, for new mothers 
in recovery. 
A new mom has a lot going on: caring 
for a newborn, coping with a potential 
substance abuse complication for that 
newborn, and caring for herself in her 
often deadly battle with addiction. 
Build Back Better would grow the 
workforce specializing in that care for 
moms. 
The Medicaid Reentry Act, which I 
did with Senator BALDWIN, is also in 
the mix to provide Medicaid coverage 
to people as they get out of jail and 
prison. We showed in Rhode Island that 
these programs dramatically reduce 
overdoses and deaths in the weeks fol-
lowing 
release 
from 
incarceration. 
Steady access to care through Medicaid 
will save lives. 
There is a boost to the Minority Fel-
lowship Program because it is demon-
strable that a more diverse workforce 
produces better outcomes for patients 
and families. 
Finally, the peer recovery coach is a 
personal favorite of mine. We are pio-
neering this in Rhode Island. These are 
people who have walked the path of ad-
diction and recovery, and they can re-
late to people who are struggling in a 
way that you and I might not be able 
to. Their role, after an overdose or in a 
crisis, to get people onto the path of re-
covery is wonderfully important. 
All of the other things we are doing 
will actually create more stable lives. 
When events happen that knock people 
off of the path of recovery, having a 
stable life actually allows for a better 
shot at recovery and work around re-
lapse. 
So there is a lot to love in Build 
Back Better, and I want people to 
know that we did not forget those folks 
who are struggling with addiction or 
walking the noble path of recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that Senators 
MERKLEY, KAINE, and I be able to com-
plete our remarks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
we are all gathered here today, the 
group of us, to make a real case for 
passing the Build Back Better agenda 
and what it really means to people 
back in our home States, as Senator 
WHITEHOUSE was just explaining about 
Rhode Island. We get a lot in the minu-
tia here for good reason. We are fight-
ing a lot of forces. But in the end, what 
I know about this agenda, from the in-
frastructure in the bipartisan infra-
structure bill to the work we are doing 
as part of this people-first agenda, it is 
about putting the people of this coun-
try first over the pharmaceutical com-
panies, over polluters. 
As I see those fires rage in my State, 
I know we have to do something about 
it. As I see people coming to me after 
years and years and years about the 
costs of common drugs—Lyrica. You 
see it advertised on TV all the time. 
What you might not know is that it 
has gone up 50 percent in just the last 
5 years. 
What I do know is that the people of 
this country overwhelmingly—Demo-
crats, Republicans, and Independents— 
support bringing costs down for fami-
lies, support a big middle-class tax cut, 
and support doing something about 
pharmaceutical prices. 
Chief among the reforms in this bill 
when it comes to healthcare will be al-
lowing Medicare to negotiate directly 
for less expensive drugs for our seniors. 
I think 46 million seniors should be 
able to get a pretty good deal, and I 
know they could if someone let them 
do it. 
Right now, in law, because the phar-
maceutical companies lobbied to get it 
done, they got a ban—a ban—on Medi-
care negotiating better prices for our 
seniors. This doesn’t just help our sen-
iors, to lift this ban; it helps everyone 
in America because this is the single 
biggest purchaser of drugs, our seniors, 
because they need help in their later 
years. They have health issues. 
The stories I have heard in my 
State—people like Claire from St. 
Paul. When the cost of the prescription 
drugs she relied on to manage her ar-
thritis jumped from 60 bucks per 
month to 1,400 bucks per month, she 
knew she could no longer afford it. She 
tried over-the-counter options. Her ar-
thritis advanced. She could barely hold 
a fork and a knife. I met a woman who 
was literally holding the drops of her 
insulin from day to day to day so she 
could save it for the next day. That is 
how we are treating seniors in our 
country? 
Let’s unleash the power of 46 million 
seniors, get better prices for the drugs, 
push this Build Back Better agenda, 
which puts people first, and bring down 
the cost of prescription drugs. 
Thank you, Madam President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6974 
October 7, 2021 
I yield the floor to my friend from 
Oregon. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
Build Back Better invests in families, 
the foundations for our families to 
thrive—in education, in childcare, in 
healthcare, and in housing. So much is 
needed. It makes huge investments 
critical to taking on the biggest chal-
lenge facing mankind: climate chaos. 
Earlier this summer, the U.N. cli-
mate panel released a report they 
called ‘‘code red for humanity’’ because 
the science shows what a dire path we 
are on right now. 
Another report, this one coming from 
Save the Children and published in the 
journal Science, titled ‘‘Born into the 
Climate Crisis,’’ shows how much hard-
er life is going to be for our children. 
Let me say it again: for our children— 
not our children’s children, not our 
grandchildren’s 
grandchildren; 
our 
children. On average, they will experi-
ence 21⁄2 times more droughts than we 
did, three times as many floods, three 
times as many crop failures, twice the 
number of wildfires, and so forth. This 
is the dangerous and unforgiving world 
we are willfully leaving our children if 
we do not act now to control methane 
and carbon dioxide that are heating up 
our planet and causing these catas-
trophes. This is a collective effort of 
humankind, but America has to act 
and help lead the world to action. 
Now, some say we simply cannot af-
ford the investments, but the truth is, 
we can’t not afford to act. Last year 
alone, America confronted 22 separate 
billion-dollar 
disasters. 
That 
came 
with a $95 billion pricetag to the Amer-
ican people. Winds and flooding and se-
vere storms accounted for $35 billion. 
Hurricanes over the last 5 years cost 
$400 billion. Those numbers don’t ac-
count for the droughts, the wildfires, 
the impact on sea life, ocean eco-
systems, the fishing industry. They 
don’t account for any of that. 
We are facing massive economic dis-
asters if we don’t act on climate, and 
the way we act: We pass Build Back 
Better. We set ourselves on that path 
to net zero in the next 30 years, reduc-
ing our emissions over the next decade 
to half of what they were in 2005, ensur-
ing that 80 percent of our American 
electricity is carbon-free by 2030, and 
ensuring that half of America’s auto 
fleet is electric by the same time. We 
have the tools. We have to have the po-
litical will to act. So we must pass 
Build Back Better. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
with my colleagues on Build Back Bet-
ter, and I just want to emphasize two 
points that really matter to me. 
First, Build Back Better is abso-
lutely critical to combine with the in-
frastructure bill. If we make an infra-
structure investment that will be the 
biggest since the Interstate Highway 
System, who is going to build it? Who 
is going to build it? 
Open the paper. You can’t hire 
schoolbus 
drivers. 
You 
can’t 
hire 
truckers. We have a tight labor market 
right now. What Build Back Better 
does is massive investments in the 
American workforce, beginning with 
the workforce of tomorrow—our chil-
dren—all the way up through commu-
nity college, workforce development, 
and immigration reforms that will ex-
pand the Nation’s workforce. 
If we invest in infrastructure but 
don’t think about making sure that we 
have the workforce to do it, what a 
missed opportunity. The Build Back 
Better plan has amazing investments 
in our workforce—the workforce we 
need right now and the workforce we 
will need for decades. 
The second thing about Build Back 
Better that I particularly appreciate is 
what it does for children. 
If we pass Build Back Better, we will 
have done for American children what 
Social Security has done for American 
seniors. 
Let me just point something out. 
Pre-Social Security, you would work 
your whole life; you would educate 
your kids; you would be the PTA presi-
dent or the Little League coach or the 
Sunday school teacher. You would re-
tire, and 50 percent of people would re-
tire and then go below the poverty 
level. That was what being a senior cit-
izen was in the United States before 
Social Security. 
FDR basically said: We want you to 
have a dignified retirement because 
you have worked, and you have earned 
it. 
So Social Security, once passed and 
implemented, dropped the senior pov-
erty rate from 50 percent to 10 percent. 
There has never been a program that 
has been as successful in doing exactly 
what it was designed to do as Social 
Security. 
Build Back Better can do the same 
thing for kids. We are a nation that has 
tolerated, for decades, a youth poverty 
level dramatically higher than the 
adult poverty level. What does that say 
about a society? Yet we have sort of 
acted like: Well, I guess that is the law 
of nature. I guess we can’t do anything 
about it. I guess kids are just going to 
be a lot poorer than adults. 
We don’t have to tolerate it. We can 
do something about it with the com-
bined impact of the child tax credit, 
the childcare tax credit, the funding 
for childcare, universal pre-K, paid par-
ent and family leave, and free commu-
nity college. If you put those things to-
gether, we will do for children what So-
cial Security did for adults, and we will 
no longer be a nation that tolerates an 
unacceptably high children’s poverty 
rate and says: Well, there is nothing we 
can do about it. 
We can do something about it, and 
we will do something about it. That is 
why I so strongly support, with my col-
leagues, Build Back Better. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
DEBT CEILING 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
as we await the vote this afternoon, I 
hope we will resolve a number of things 
today so that we make sure we stand 
by the full faith and credit of the 
United States and not let regular peo-
ple’s interest rates go up, the economy 
go to tatters, and our credit rating be 
downgraded. I hope we can get this 
done. 
At the same time, just as Americans 
have gone through this pandemic—just 
as those moms and dads have been at 
home, with their toddlers on their 
knees and laptops on their desks; just 
as they have been teaching their first 
graders how to use a mute button; and 
just as so many people have lost their 
jobs or risked their lives while working 
on the frontline—they are ready to get 
through this. They see the light at the 
end of the tunnel or, as we say in Du-
luth, MN, the lighthouse on the hori-
zon. They see this just as we continue 
to work, as best we can, with a number 
of our colleagues we disagree with be-
cause we think we should just simply 
move through this and make sure we 
are standing by the full faith and cred-
it of the United States and not let our 
debt ceiling lapse. 
As we do that, we are looking to the 
future just as America is. Just as we 
are starting to see those jobs come 
back, they are going back to work; 
they are starting to see their families 
again; they are going to family re-
unions; they are starting to be able to 
go to weddings again. As all of this is 
happening—as we get the vaccine out 
there and as we bring people back to-
gether—we also have to plan for that 
future just like families do every day. 
That is what this is about, the Build 
Back Better agenda. That is what this 
is about—putting people in front of so 
many people who, honestly, have done 
pretty well during this time. There are 
a whole bunch of billionaires who 
didn’t even have to pay taxes while 
these families have been struggling 
through the pandemic. There are a 
whole bunch of people for whom it is 
easier to go and get prescription drugs 
or do whatever they want while other 
people are having to choose between 
filling their refrigerators with food or 
filling their prescriptions at the phar-
macy. 
So you got a tour in the last half 
hour from Maryland to Wisconsin, the 
State of my neighboring friend TAMMY 
BALDWIN; to Rhode Island; to the great 
State of Oregon on the west coast; to 
my home State of Minnesota; to close 
by Senator KAINE’s State of Virginia. 
What we are seeing, while our States 
may be very different, and what we are 
hearing are the same things: Regular 
people want to bring costs down. That 
is what this bill is about—bringing 
costs down for families in America— 
and there are many ways we are going 
to do this. 
One is with straightforward tax cuts 
for people. Another is with making it

easier to afford things. It is that sim-
ple. That is what I like most about it 
in my State. They want to make it 
easier to get childcare. They want to 
make it easier to get healthcare. They 
want to make it easier for their par-
ents at the moment when they go to 
assisted living or they need to get 
someone in to help them, just like my 
dad, whom we lost this year. He got 
that long-term care insurance. I don’t 
know why he did it, but he did. I knew 
the day that his money ran out, and he 
was going to go on Medicaid because 
that was there for his safety net. So 
many families in America know ex-
actly what I am talking about, and 
what this bill does is build on the safe-
ty net we have in place. 
So let’s remember that. Putting our 
kids first, our seniors first, our fami-
lies first, our healthcare first—that is 
what this is about. 
We look forward, over the next few 
weeks, to getting this bill done and 
getting it agreed to. To me, it is not al-
ways about what those top numbers are 
and everything you hear on the news; 
it is for what it is going to mean to the 
families in my State.

GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we are rap-
idly approaching a milestone in our 
country, and it is not a good one. We 
are rapidly approaching $30 trillion in 
debt. We are accumulating debt like we 
never have at any time in our history. 
We are actually accumulating debt at 
the rate of over $2 million per minute. 
Now, some say deficits don’t matter. 
Some on the left say they have this 
new monetary theory: We can just 
print it all up. You can all have free 
stuff. There will be manna from Heav-
en. And nothing could go wrong; we are 
just going to give you money. If not 
$1,400 checks a month or a year, why 
don’t we give you monthly checks? 
That is part of the new plans. The 
new plans of the $31⁄2 trillion that we 
are facing down at this point—that will 
all be borrowed—is to give people free 
money; to give people free this, free 
that. But I think people are smarter 
than that. I think people know that, 
ultimately, you don’t get anything in 
life without hard work; you don’t get 
anything in life, really, for free. 
Isn’t there some kind of ramification 
to so much borrowed money? When 
someone comes to you and says or they 
call you on the phone and they say 
‘‘Here is a thousand dollars; all you 
have got to do is sign up for this,’’ 
most people immediately recoil and 
they say ‘‘Well, that might be a scam. 
Somebody is going to be ripping me off 
to say that.’’ 
Well, that is sort of the bait-and- 
switch of the politics we face now. Peo-
ple are saying: We are going to give 
you free college, free cars, free cell 
phones, free this, free that. Everything 
in life will be free. You won’t have to 
work anymore. 
The problem is, there are ramifica-
tions. Money doesn’t grow on trees. 
Money has got to come from some-
where. So either we borrow it and we 
become more indebted to foreign coun-
tries, we tax people for it, or ulti-
mately the way we fix a lot of our def-
icit problems is we simply print the 
money. 
So when the Federal Reserve prints 
the money, as we increase the money 
supply, the money that we have be-
comes worth less and less; it loses its 
purchasing power. This is the insidious 
tax of inflation. 
The interesting thing about it is that 
inflation is a regressive tax. It doesn’t 
affect everyone the same. In fact, the 
tax of inflation actually affects the 
working class, the people of lower in-
comes, and those on fixed incomes and 
pensions, 
retirees—it 
affects 
them 
much worse because they don’t have 
the ability for their income to go up. 
So, right now, we are facing 5 percent 
inflation because of the massive bor-
rowing that, really, both parties insti-
tuted in the last year. They decided 
that the result to the pandemic would 
be to close everything down, destroy 
the economy, and then give everyone 
free money. And, to a large extent, 
both parties actually did this last year. 
Now, this year, the decision has been 
made by Republicans to say: Whoo, 
this is so much. We have got to stop. 
We have got to get people back to work 
and let the economy recover.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6976 
October 7, 2021 
So it has primarily been Democrats 
this year, but both parties have a cer-
tain responsibility to this—at least 
some members of both parties. But, as 
the inflation occurs and as this effect 
is being transmitted to the economy, 
you find that those who suffer are 
those who cannot raise their incomes, 
those who have fixed incomes or low 
incomes. 
One of the things you see here is 
that, if we have 5-percent inflation, 
what does that mean? 
You say: Well, I don’t know. It means 
I lose my purchasing power by 5 per-
cent next year. 
But what if it happens year in and 
year out for a decade, and you have 
lost 50 percent of your purchasing 
power? 
It means, to make up for that, you 
really have to have a 50-percent in-
crease in your wages. 
So will wages keep up with inflation? 
The dirty little secret is that, in 
some ways, wages will rise, but maybe 
they rise an equivalent amount or a 
little bit less, and you say a decade 
later: I am not any better off. 
And there become people mired and 
more dependent on government as gov-
ernment gets larger and larger. They 
think they are getting free stuff, but it 
is not really free. The allure of some-
thing for nothing—this is the allure of 
socialism. This is a false allure. It is 
the idea that you are going to be able 
to get something and you are not going 
to have to pay for it. 
So we have accumulated $30 trillion 
in debt. Interest payments have been 
fairly low over the past decade or so. 
Interest payments are at about, you 
know, 1, 2, 2.5 percent, but now interest 
rates are rising. Even at the low inter-
est rates, our interest rate that we pay 
each year has grown to about $300 bil-
lion a year. 
So, with $300 billion a year, people 
say: Well, there is a debt ceiling. If the 
debt ceiling doesn’t come up, we will 
default, and Wall Street will become 
hysterical, and there will be a collapse 
of the stock market. 
Well, there doesn’t need to be. No-
body is really for spreading discalm or 
spreading, you know, chaos among the 
marketplace. We all want the market-
place to be calm. 
How could we calm the marketplace? 
Well, what we would say to the mar-
ketplace is, we will pay our bills and 
we are not going to default on our cur-
rency. And the way you can pay for 
your bills is to pay for them with in-
come. We bring in $3.8 trillion a year in 
tax revenue. The interest payment is 
$300 billion. It is less than we bring in 
in 1 month. So the annual payment on 
interest is less than what we bring in 
in tax revenue in 1 month. 
Why can’t we pay the interest? Why 
would we ever not pay the interest on 
our debt? Why? 
Because we are overdrawn and be-
cause all the rest of the spending is 
crowded out by the interest. 
We have got plenty of money to pay 
for the interest. We just don’t have 
enough left to pay for the cocaine stud-
ies with Japanese quail. That is, you 
know, about a million bucks. 
You say: Oh, it is only a million 
bucks. 
Well, they studied Japanese quail to 
see whether or not Japanese quail on 
cocaine are more sexually promis-
cuous. 
How did we get to a $30 trillion debt? 
Because there are studies like that 
littered throughout the budget. In fact, 
the group that does these studies, the 
National Science Foundation, we just 
increased their budget by two-thirds. It 
was mostly the Democrats, but, once 
again, many of the Big Government 
Republicans voted for this too. So we 
have exploded the National Science 
Foundation. 
Now, was there any warning that the 
National Science Foundation was one 
of the most wasteful parts of our gov-
ernment? 
Well, yes, since 1972. 
There was a Senator at the time 
named William Proxmire. He was a 
conservative, or a maverick, Democrat 
from the Midwest, and he started an 
award. He called it the Golden Fleece 
Award. The first award he gave was for 
a study from the National Science 
Foundation. It was over a study that 
was $50,000. That was when $50,000 was 
a lot of money. And the study was to 
see what makes people happy. 
Really? 
People were aghast that we were 
spending $50,000 on it. He complained, 
and he gave them a booby prize and a 
Golden Fleece Award. 
And, lo and behold, we are still doing 
it. The same organization, last year, 
did a million-and-a-half-dollar study 
that if you take a selfie of yourself 
while smiling and then look at the 
selfie later on, does it make you 
happy? That cost a million-and-a-half 
bucks. 
Why do people like each other? Why 
do people fall in love? 
These aren’t studies for taxpayer dol-
lars. But these are small ticket items. 
They say: Oh, you could never balance 
the budget on that. 
Well, what about the $70 million 
spent on a hotel in Kabul, and the con-
tractor ran off with the money, and it 
was never built? 
What about a $48 million gas sta-
tion—no; strike that—natural gas gas 
station in a remote area of Afghani-
stan? 
Well, very few, if anybody, in the 
United States has a car that runs on 
natural gas. 
Why was the U.S. Government build-
ing a natural gas gas station in Af-
ghanistan? 
Because we have gone ‘‘woke’’ on the 
green climate. We are for the green cli-
mate. We have got to combat climate 
change and reduce the carbon footprint 
of Afghanistan. 
Really? 
I thought the military was supposed 
to kill the enemy and defend the coun-
try, but we are reducing the carbon 
footprint in Afghanistan. 
Somebody put this up—I think it was 
Rod Dreher—the other day. It was a lit-
tle video clip. It was tragic, but some-
what hilarious in its tragicness. 
He said: This is when we lost the Af-
ghan war. 
It had a picture of a urinal. I think it 
was by Marcel Duchamp, some Dadaist 
artist back in, like, 1917, and I guess he 
thought it would be really hilarious to 
put a male urinal in a museum and call 
it art. I don’t know if it was really art 
or if it was a joke, but the thing is they 
were having these Afghan men and 
women in robes and veils and every-
thing studying Dadaist art—a male uri-
nal—and 
asking 
them 
what 
they 
thought of this. You could see a couple 
of women just sort of shaking their 
heads with utter incomprehension. 
When we are spending money sending 
Ph.D.s over to Afghanistan to teach 
Dadaist art—that a male urinal is 
somehow art—I think that is why some 
of them think that we are actually the 
culture that is in decay, not theirs. 
But the thing is we are spending 
money right and left. The right spends 
it on military adventures, and the left 
spends it on welfare, and the com-
promise that always happens around 
here is that right comes together with 
left, and they all agree: Well, you 
know, we might as well just spend it on 
both. 
So everything goes up. The military 
budget went up. We already spend more 
than all of the countries. More than 10 
countries combined is our military 
budget—$750-some-odd billion. Repub-
licans and Democrats just raised it $25 
billion more. 
In the midst of ending a war, where is 
the peace dividend? What happened? 
We ended a war. I thought we would 
have a little more money left over. 
So, today, I tried to take $6 billion 
that is supposed to go to the Afghan 
Reconstruction Fund, to the old Af-
ghan Government. There is no Afghan 
Government. They have been overrun 
by the Taliban. 
I would love for Americans who are 
watching this to call me today, at my 
office, and tell me why the Taliban 
should get money. 
I asked that we take that money 
away, put it back in the Treasury, and 
spend some of it on the Iron Dome for 
Israel, and it was objected to by the 
Democrats because, by golly, they will 
spend money, but they don’t want to 
offset it with any spending cuts. 
Well, really? 
We should have zero dollars being 
sent to any government in Afghani-
stan. 
I asked Secretary Blinken about this, 
and his response was: Well, I can’t 
guarantee it, and if they—you know, if 
they are meeting expectations and 
they are acting and behaving properly, 
they might get this money. 
Really? 
I don’t see a scenario or a world in 
which U.S. taxpayer dollars would be 
going to the Taliban. It makes utterly 
no sense at all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6977 
October 7, 2021 
But we have spending that is lit-
erally out of control. The only time I 
have ever heard a Democrat—most of 
the time, they are honest in that they 
don’t care about the debt. But the only 
time I have ever heard them say any-
thing about it is when they say: Well, 
you know, it happens because you cut 
taxes. 
Well, you know, it is verifiably false. 
You can go back to the Reagan tax 
cuts, when the rates went from 70 to 50, 
and then from 50 to 28. 
Do you know what happened? 
The government got more revenue 
because, when you tax people less, 
when you let them keep more of their 
own money, guess what. Their incen-
tives to produce go up, and the econ-
omy grows by leaps and bounds. So 
when Reagan cut taxes dramatically, 
the economy responded and grew tre-
mendously. 
When we cut taxes in 2017, it was the 
same thing. It was the same thing: 
Revenue didn’t go down. Revenue went 
up. 
So how did the deficit get worse? 
Why did the deficit get worse? Was it 
because we cut taxes in 2017? 
No. It was because we piled on the 
money. We just were spending money 
like there was no tomorrow. 
So, before we got to the extraor-
dinary times we have now, where ev-
erything is about COVID and we are 
just going to spend money like there is 
no tomorrow, we were borrowing $1 
trillion a year. The main segments of 
government—Medicare, Medicaid, So-
cial Security, food stamps, other wel-
fare, and military—probably comprise 
three-fourths or more of government. 
If you look at that on an annual 
basis, before you get to the extraor-
dinary binge over the last 2 years, we 
were already $1 trillion short every 
year—$1 trillion short. So, last year, 
we added a couple trillion more, and 
our deficit for the year—for 1 year— 
was $3 trillion. We have never, ever 
borrowed that much. 
There are going to be ramifications. 
You are already seeing some of the 
ramifications. 
You 
are 
seeing 
the 
prices in the grocery store go up; you 
are seeing the prices at the pump go 
up; you are seeing sometimes wages go 
up. But you are also seeing prices ris-
ing faster than wages, which often hap-
pens in an inflationary cycle. 
Some people have trouble compre-
hending these numbers. 
What is a billion? What is a trillion? 
Reagan had an analogy he did. He 
said: If you want to know how big ‘‘a 
billion’’ is, take thousand-dollar bills 
and put them in your hand, and when 
you have them about 4-inches high, 
you have got $1 million. But if you 
want to know how much or how tall a 
stack of $1,000 would be if you had $1 
trillion, it would be 60 miles high—over 
60 miles high. 
That is what kind of money we are 
talking about. That was to get to a 
trillion. 
So we have $1 trillion of institutional 
debt that is added every year, but now 
we are talking about a time when they 
are talking about adding, in one bill, 
$3.5 trillion. The bill that they have be-
fore us has $1 billion in spending for 
every page. Every page of the bill has 
an extra billion dollars in spending. It 
is extraordinary. We have never, ever 
seen anything like this. 
What happens when a country de-
stroys its currency? 
We have examples in history. In Ger-
many, in 1923, the money was starting 
to lose its value in about September. A 
loaf of bread might have cost 100 mark 
when, before, it cost 1 mark. Two 
weeks later, it was 1,000 marks, but 
then 2 weeks later, it was 10,000 marks, 
and then it was a million, and then it 
was several million. This happened in a 
2-month period of time. 
People say: Oh, when it comes, when 
the currency unravels, it will be grad-
ual. 
In Germany, it happened in a 2- 
month period. 
In Venezuela, the currency is com-
pletely worthless. It is the same in 
Germany. It is almost better to burn 
your currency for fuel or warmth than 
it is to spend it. This is what happens 
when you have runaway spending and 
out-of-control deficits. Venezuela is 
one of the richest countries in South 
America. They have more oil under-
ground than Saudi Arabia, but, frank-
ly, socialism doesn’t work. Socialism is 
this borrow and spend. It has this 
alarming tendency to want to offer ev-
erybody everything and say it is going 
to be free. Many of these things back-
fire. 
For the last year, we have been say-
ing: Oh, gosh. We feel sorry for work-
ers, so we are going to pay them while 
they are unemployed. 
But guess what. If you pay them 
more than the market wage, more of 
them will choose unemployment, and 
more of them will choose unemploy-
ment, and more of them will stay un-
employed for a longer period of time. 
We found this out in the 2008 recession. 
During the 2008 recession, we ex-
tended unemployment. It is normally 
26 weeks, paid for by a tax, and it 
largely works within the confines of a 
State-run program. We extended it to 
99 weeks—almost 2 years. 
But do you know what the studies 
found? 
This is part of the syndrome we have 
around here. It is sort of the ‘‘big 
heart, small brain’’ syndrome. I think 
many of these people want to help peo-
ple; they just don’t understand that 
what they are doing is actually hurting 
the same people they are trying to 
help. 
So if you extend unemployment to 99 
weeks, and then, all of a sudden, the 
guy, at 99 weeks—or woman—says, ‘‘I 
need to get a job,’’ and they go to the 
employer and say, ‘‘I have been out of 
work for 99 weeks, and I have been on 
unemployment,’’ and the other person 
who is applying for the job says, ‘‘Well, 
I have been out of work for 10 weeks, 
and I am looking for a job,’’ who do 
you think the employer hires? 
Every time, it is the person out of 
work for 10 weeks. 
As for the person who hasn’t worked 
for 99 weeks, they are like: There 
might be something wrong here. We 
might have gotten to the point where 
we have lost the work ethic. 
So what have you done to the people 
who you try to help? 
You have actually kept them out of 
the workplace so long that they be-
come unemployable. 
After they become unemployable, 
what do they become? 
They become the permanently unem-
ployable, the nonworking part. 
Do you wonder who this is? 
Sixty-two percent of the country is 
in the workforce, and 38 percent is not. 
These are people who are permanently 
out of the workforce. These aren’t peo-
ple who can’t work. These are just peo-
ple who, for one reason or another, are 
no longer in the workforce. 
Now, some of them really can’t work, 
and we have sympathy for that, but 
many of them are people who just 
stayed out of work too long or took the 
wrong incentives or became addicted to 
drugs or alcohol because they weren’t 
working. 
So there are things we can do in our 
country, but if we are not careful, it is 
going to slip away from us. I don’t 
want our country to be Venezuela, and 
I don’t want our country to destroy its 
currency, but what we are offering is a 
more difficult sell because the other 
side is going to give you free college 
and free daycare and free cars and free 
cell phones. 
What we are offering is opportunity. 
What we are offering is the freedom to 
try to strive. We are offering equality 
before the law, not equality of outcome 
after you have done your work, after 
you have tried to participate—equality 
before the law. 
One of the interesting things that I 
think isn’t often grasped by people is 
that if you want equal outcomes, if you 
want everybody to be the same and you 
want to equalize everybody, you actu-
ally have to treat them unequally. 
In our country, it took a while, but 
we have gotten to the point where peo-
ple truly believe in the concept of 
equality before the law. But if you also 
want to believe in equal outcomes at 
the end, realize you can’t believe in 
both. They are mutually exclusive. You 
cannot believe in equality before the 
law if you want equal outcomes. 
If you want this so-called equity at 
the end, you want everybody to be 
equal at the end, you have to treat 
them unequally because some people 
are either born with more talent, born 
with more money, born with more 
sense, luckier, work harder—there are 
a lot of reasons. 
If you put 100 people in a room and 
you give them all 5 bucks, within an 
hour, somebody will have more. Some-
body had some cigarettes. Somebody 
really wanted to smoke, and they have 
a dollar. The money spreads around the 
room. They have done these experi-
ments. Money doesn’t stay in one

place, but it is by and large, in a free 
society, based on work. But once the 
government 
becomes 
in 
charge 
of 
things, 
it 
becomes 
less 
of 
a 
meritocracy and becomes more of a so-
ciety based on who you know. 
There are rich people—don’t get me 
wrong. When you look at socialism, 
there are rich people: Maduro, Chavez, 
Castro—incredibly rich people. They 
own their own islands. They have bil-
lions of dollars. Their relatives are all 
rich. 
So instead of a society mostly based 
on merit—we talk about the greatness 
of America. One of the most important 
things about capitalism and freedom 
and what happened in America is, for 
the first time, it wasn’t based on who 
you were; it wasn’t based on royal lin-
eage. For the most part, Europe was, 
you know, longtime landowners and 
royalty, and a very small percentage of 
the public did very well. 
In fact, before 1820, before the Indus-
trial Revolution, virtually everybody 
in the world—96, 98 percent of the 
world lived in extreme poverty. A bare 
subsistence level. Barely enough to eat. 
There was no obesity because there was 
barely enough food. You just scraped 
by. That was 98 percent of the world. 
Fast-forward to today, after we have 
adopted what Adam Smith talked 
about as far as trade, division of labor, 
and capitalism, do you know what we 
have now? When you look at poverty— 
less than $2 a day in the world—it is 
less than 10 percent of the world. You 
won’t find this on television. There is 
not going to be any good news on tele-
vision or in the newspaper. The poorest 
people in our country actually are 
equivalent to the middle class in most 
countries. We are a huge success, but 
we are a country misguided and led 
astray by media that aren’t honest. 
For example, if you watched CNN, 
you would think that nobody is getting 
vaccinated, and it is a complete dis-
aster, and, whoa, we are stuck in this 
rut because no one is vaccinated. It is 
completely untrue. Over 90 percent of 
people over 65, who are the most vul-
nerable, are vaccinated. Now, sure, 
there are a lot of younger people who 
aren’t vaccinated, and there are some 
older people, but 90 percent is a pretty 
good success. Over age 50, it is like 75, 
80 percent of people. People are in-
formed. They know this is a disease 
that can affect any age but affects pri-
marily the older ages. 
For example, the one truth you won’t 
be told is that an 85-year-old has a 
10,000 times greater chance of dying 
than a 10-year-old. Now, you think we 
should treat them the same? If you 
were their doctor, do you think a 10- 
year-old 
should 
get 
the 
same 
healthcare and the same prescriptions 
for what they need to do as an 85-year- 
old? That makes no sense at all. 
I see 10-year-olds and I see 5-year- 
olds out on the Mall—my wife and I 
were walking down to the Lincoln Me-
morial the other day, and I saw 5-year- 
olds in groups, led by teachers, wearing 
masks outside. There is no science to 
that. 
We 
have 
Dr. 
Fauci 
spreading 
mistruths across the country, saying 
we have to forcibly vaccinate the kids? 
There is no science behind any of that. 
In fact, England is rejecting what we 
are doing. In England, because of the 
age skew, because of what they are see-
ing—that the people most at risk are of 
an older age—they are actually saying: 
Instead of forcibly vaccinating chil-
dren, why don’t we try to make the 
vaccine doses available for the elderly? 
Why don’t we target our care to those 
who are at highest risk? 
We have a problem in our country. 
We have people who have so politicized 
science that there are people strug-
gling and dying every day because they 
have never heard about monoclonal 
antibodies. We have people dying every 
day because the government, at the be-
hest of Dr. Fauci and a few other peo-
ple, has said: You can’t get monoclonal 
antibodies if you are in the hospital. 
I talk to people every day who really 
have not yet heard of monoclonal anti-
bodies, who get COVID again after 
being fully vaccinated or sometimes 
not being vaccinated and are not get-
ting the treatment because Dr. Fauci 
says: If you are in the hospital, you 
don’t get it. 
So we have medicine that is coming 
from on high, from a central authority 
like the politburo, and doctors are 
afraid to prescribe. This has never hap-
pened in our country before. Doctors 
were able to make their own decisions 
based on their own experience, based 
on studies, based on real-life examples, 
but using their own discretion. Now 
doctors 
are 
afraid 
to 
prescribe 
monoclonal antibodies, and many of 
them are disallowed from prescribing it 
to an inpatient. 
Realize the ridiculous nature of that. 
You are in the emergency room. You 
are sick, and you are coughing. You 
might be dying from COVID. You get 
to the emergency room. You don’t 
know what to say. You can barely talk. 
Your spouse has to be able to tell the 
doctor ‘‘Please stop’’ in an emergency 
room. Give them the monoclonal anti-
bodies before they are admitted be-
cause once they are admitted, we won’t 
treat them. It is the same way with 
symptoms. You have to have symptoms 
within the first 10 days. If you don’t 
have symptoms—if you are on day 11, 
you won’t get monoclonal antibodies. 
It is completely arbitrary, it is capri-
cious, and it has to do with govern-
ment-mandated guidelines. 
Let’s take some of the other truths 
or mistruths that are out there. 
I have said over and over again that 
cloth masks don’t work because they 
don’t. 
Peer-reviewed 
studies 
have 
shown time and time again that cloth 
masks don’t work. But when Dr. Fauci 
tells you that all masks work, when he 
comes in all draped with three masks 
on himself with little insignias, clever 
insignias of different sports teams, he 
is actually spreading a mistruth that 
causes lives to be lost. 
Why? Let’s say you have a 75-year- 
old woman and she gets COVID, and 
her husband is taking care of her. Do 
you think the advice to go into the 
room to feed her, bathe her, help her 
get in and out of her clothes while she 
is sick, while wearing a cloth mask is 
a good idea or a bad idea? It is mal-
practice. Yet, for some reason, the left-
wing media has lauded this man as the 
second coming, and what he is telling 
you is absolutely verifiably dangerous 
to your health. 
The only mask that really works of 
any real value is the N95 mask. The 
surgical masks have some value but 
not very much. Most of the air is going 
around the mask. They just aren’t of 
value. But you have to submit. The 
man is telling you to do it; you got to 
do what you got to do. But the thing is, 
when you tell people something is safe, 
they tend to react to that and have be-
havior, and in their behavior, they are 
in favor of something that may well ac-
tually be risky behavior for them. 
The vaccinations—because we ignore 
natural immunity, we directed the vac-
cine to the wrong people and still are. 
For example, because of Dr. Fauci’s 
lead—India is accepting his lead as 
well, and India does not have enough 
vaccine. They have a billion people. 
They can’t vaccinate enough people 
fast enough. So if you have a billion 
people and you have 200 million doses 
of vaccine, who do you think you 
should give it to? Should you give it to 
the 10-year-old the same as the 85-year- 
old? No. That is ridiculous. But what 
about two 65-year-olds and one of them 
has had COVID and one of them hasn’t? 
The studies are plentiful. The studies 
are throughout that say that if you 
have already had it, you have natural 
immunity to COVID, as good or better 
than the vaccine. 
Do you think it makes good public 
health policy to say that everybody 
who is 65 should get it instead of say-
ing: Have you had it? Why don’t we 
check you for antibodies if you think 
you have had it? Maybe you should 
wait until we have vaccinated every 65- 
year-old who doesn’t have immunity. 
These are real things. These are real 
discussions. But if you have these, un-
less it is on the Senate floor—actually, 
that is not even true. You can say this 
on the Senate floor, and YouTube will 
take it down. I have had it happen. I 
have given speeches on the floor that 
YouTube takes down. 
So this is a world in which people 
need to realize and get back to the 
ideas of classical liberalism where we 
debated things. Classical liberalism 
was about skepticism; it was about you 
having your opinion and me having my 
opinion. But the difference between the 
elitist or the collectivist point of view 
and the individual right point of view 
is, I believe you have every right to 
your opinion. 
But if you are a collectivist and you 
believe that, from the very top down, 
all medical decisions come from Dr. 
Fauci, and if he doesn’t want you to

fly, you don’t get to fly—see, it is dif-
ferent from individual liberty because I 
think if you have a differing opinion, 
you are welcome to your opinion. 
If an airline has a policy I don’t like, 
maybe I choose not to fly, but the idea 
that we are going to restrict everyone’s 
behavior based on what they decide to 
do—what is next? People eat too many 
cheeseburgers. We are not going to give 
them a heart stent because we think 
they haven’t behaved and haven’t lis-
tened to the doctors on what they 
should be eating? 
There is no end to this. But in the 
end, if we are not careful, we are going 
to spend this country into oblivion. 
COVID is a big cause of the extra 
spending we have now, but I can tell 
you, there are ramifications that are 
coming quick. They are coming in the 
form of higher prices. But there is no 
reason in the world for us to default. 
We have plenty of money. We should 
simply pay for the interest based on 
what comes in every month. 
With that, I would like to reserve my 
time and turn it over. 
Mr. LEE. Will the gentleman yield 
for a question? 
Mr. PAUL. Sure. 
Mr. LEE. Senator PAUL, when you 
and I were both elected to the Senate 
back in 2010, I remember the national 
debt was an issue then. It was becom-
ing large enough that people were con-
cerned about it. As it mounted, some-
times we had conversations about how 
long it might continue—how long it 
might continue to spiral upward. 
Are you surprised to see that here we 
are, 11 year later, 11 years after you 
and I arrived here, and where it has 
gone since then? 
Mr. PAUL. I guess ‘‘surprised’’ is not 
the word I would choose; I would say 
disappointed. 
You know, the tea party movement— 
we had 100,000 people on the Mall out 
there. People were concerned about the 
debt. They were concerned about con-
stitutional government. 
I remember you and I meeting for the 
first time and talking about how we 
needed to reverse some of these ter-
rible precedents that had allowed gov-
ernment to grow large and that the 
courts need to reform government, as 
well as government be reformed from 
its elected officials. 
But, yes, we had a great debate that 
summer. In the summer of 2011, we said 
we wouldn’t raise the debt ceiling with-
out reform. 
Mr. LEE. If the gentleman would 
yield for a question again, I believe it 
was during that summer that a number 
of people started focusing on emerging 
economic research, including research 
proposed by Professors Rogoff and 
Reinhart at Stanford University sug-
gesting that whenever the debt-to-GDP 
ratio exceeds a certain level, exceeds 
roughly 100 percent, 1-to-1, certain 
things start to happen, and economic 
growth becomes more elusive. 
As I recall, we were nowhere close, 
yet, to the 1-to-1 ratio. Now that we 
have blown past that, what do you 
think that ought to tell us about the 
fact that, even as we have blown past 
that point, we are now being asked to 
raise the debt ceiling by larger and 
larger amounts or as sometimes—— 
Mr. PAUL. Without any reform. 
Mr. LEE. For a time period without 
any reform. 
Mr. PAUL. Yes. I remember when, a 
couple of years after that, we actually 
became that—our economy was equal 
to our debt. So the gross domestic 
product—how 
much 
everything 
is 
worth that is produced in the whole 
country—was about 17 or 18 billion at 
the time, as the debt sort of crossed 
that. 
We are now, depending on how you 
measure it, some say at like 140 per-
cent of our GDP, and the interesting 
thing is, that is about where Greece 
was when Greece began to declare its 
bankruptcy and was unable to pay its 
bills. 
It is alarming. It is foolish and un-
wise for us to say: Oh, there are no con-
sequences. I think there will be con-
sequences, and the No. 1 thing that we 
are seeing now is inflation. 
Mr. LEE. Now, we have seen, with— 
our status as the United States having 
the world’s reserve currency, the U.S. 
dollar, has given us some flexibility in 
that area, flexibility that other coun-
tries like Greece haven’t had. 
Do you think there is some risk of 
becoming overly confident in that 
world reserve currency status? In other 
words, could we be jeopardizing the 
very thing that we fought so hard to 
achieve and that so few nations ever 
achieve? 
Mr. PAUL. Yes. And I think that you 
are right. Having the world’s currency 
allows us—you know, many countries 
trade in dollars. You will go into mar-
ketplaces all around the world, and 
what they are actually exchanging is 
dollars. So as we have bought more 
goods than we have exported, we im-
port more than we export, we paid for 
that in dollars. Some have described 
that as being able to export our infla-
tion. 
People have also said: Well, the dol-
lar isn’t perfect. It is a fiat currency. It 
is being inflated. 
But everybody else is so bad that we 
are sort of the cleanest shirt in a closet 
full of dirty shirts. 
So, yes, I think being the reserve cur-
rency has allowed us to last longer, but 
there are immutable rules of econom-
ics that eventually catch up to a coun-
try, and I think we approach those. I 
don’t think anybody can predict ex-
actly when we get there, but I think we 
are approaching a time—and it may 
not be a gradual unraveling. You know, 
if you look back at the history of our 
marketplace, we have had these black 
swan events. We have had these events 
where the marketplace, in 7 or 8 days 
in our history, most of the losses have 
happened calamitously. 
Even in 2011, when the market went 
down, there was a debate. They said: 
Oh, it is because we risked the debt 
ceiling. 
Well, many of us thought that the 
marketplace went down at that time 
because we actually continued to bor-
row without reforming the process. 
Mr. LEE. In an economy where cur-
rency and circulation isn’t backed up 
by any tangible object and where the 
government has effectively the ability 
to just print more money, even if that 
currency happens to be the world’s re-
serve currency, at some point after you 
keep printing money, doesn’t that 
cause problems? 
Mr. PAUL. It is based on faith, and so 
when does the faith end? Faith is not 
something particularly—it is hard to 
determine faith in the dollar. One way 
you can determine it is, will people buy 
our bonds. One of the indications that 
people lose faith in our currency is 
that when, to borrow money, you see 
your bond prices rise; you see interest 
prices rise. I think that is coming. 
You know, we are already seeing in-
flation at a 5-percent rate. Typically, 
you will see the interest rates rise as 
well. And there is going to be a time 
there are going to be repercussions. I 
fully believe that you cannot continue 
to borrow at this rate without ulti-
mately suffering, perhaps, an economic 
calamity. And I want to stop that for 
our country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah is recognized. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we have a 
debt ceiling for a reason. It is not com-
pletely arbitrary. It is not just made 
up. It is not something that someone 
came up with for their own amuse-
ment. No. When the sheer numeric vol-
ume, the quantity, the amount of our 
national debt ceases to cause panic; 
when the principle of jeopardizing our 
children’s future loses effect; when the 
sacrifice it would cost taxpayers to pay 
the debt becomes laughably large; 
when all else fails, Congress sets a cap 
and says: Here, here, here. We have to 
think about this. We have to think 
about this debt problem. 
There is a reason why we have that. 
They are sound reasons rooted in logic, 
rooted in mathematics, rooted in the 
inevitability of our own future if we 
don’t control the way that the Federal 
Government spends money. Now, near-
ly half of the Members of this entire 
body—almost the entirety of the Sen-
ate Republican conference—wrote a 
letter almost 2 months ago, saying 
that we would not raise the debt limit. 
We committed that we were finally 
going to make a change for the sake of 
families back home and generations 
still unborn. We were going to make a 
change to rein in reckless spending. 
Now we are faced with more spending 
and more debt than our country has 
ever seen before. Our debt-to-GDP ratio 
has now reached a staggering level of 
125 percent. 
The national debt is rushing toward 
$30 trillion, and far too quickly, this 
body is signaling a willingness and, I 
might dare say, an eagerness to sign on

the 
dotted 
line 
without 
thinking 
through the consequences or at least 
without thinking through the con-
sequences of everyone outside this 
building, without thinking through the 
consequences of those who are wealthy 
and well connected and will probably 
fare just fine regardless of the Federal 
Government’s reckless practice of ef-
fectively just printing more money. 
Let me tell you why that is such a 
problem and why I think it is so dan-
gerous. First of all, as I mentioned a 
moment ago in my exchange with the 
Senator from Kentucky, once we pass 
this 1-to-1 debt-to-GDP ratio, econo-
mists have scoured the landscape and 
looked at economies all over the world 
throughout human history, throughout 
periods of time in which any records 
have been kept at all, and they have 
concluded that this 100 percent debt-to- 
GDP ratio is tragic; it is dangerous; it 
is perilous. Once you cross that Rubi-
con, you are in some very, very tough 
positions. Economic growth starts to 
sputter. It staggers. It becomes more 
and more difficult to get out of the 
death spiral. 
You see, in the past, even as our na-
tional debt has been on the rise, we 
have been OK insofar as it has in-
creased, more or less, to a degree com-
mensurate with the size of our econ-
omy. Economic growth has been such 
that it remained, more or less, con-
stant—less constant lately, but it has 
remained somewhat proportional to 
the size of our economy. Economic 
growth has propelled that, but that is 
the problem. It is the goose that laid 
the golden egg. And we know what hap-
pens when you get rid of that goose or 
when you meaningfully impair its abil-
ity to lay those golden eggs. 
Once we reach that point, we pass the 
100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, we know 
that our economic growth will stall, 
and it will become far more difficult to 
pay off. We also know that it matters 
on a very personal level, for reasons I 
will get into more in just a moment, 
for poor and middle-class American 
families everywhere, throughout Utah 
and across America. People who are 
living paycheck to paycheck or other-
wise on a fixed income or fixed budget, 
like most American families, find that 
when the government just prints more 
money—as it tends to do when we start 
to borrow and then spend trillions of 
dollars at a time more than the Fed-
eral Government is bringing in—that 
brings about inflation. It is as though 
there are a basket of goods that the 
economy is capable of faithfully, con-
sistently producing from one year to 
another. The basket of goods might 
grow or shrink a little bit from year to 
year, but it is going to tend to fluc-
tuate mostly at the margins. The big 
picture is going to look fairly con-
sistent. 
So what happens when the govern-
ment just prints more money and puts 
that into circulation? The purchasing 
power of each dollar is diminished. 
Now, this tends to work out fine. In 
fact, it can work out really well for 
wealthy and well-connected individ-
uals. The rich usually figure out a way 
to get even richer off of this dynamic. 
They can hedge against it. They can 
figure out a way to benefit in one way 
or another from the chaos and some-
times even from the government spend-
ing. But where does that leave every-
one else? Well, for most people—and by 
‘‘most people’’ I mean 99 percent of 
Americans—it is not going to make 
them wealthier. It is going to make 
them poorer because most people are 
still living with more or less the same 
income, more or less the same re-
sources. They have still got more or 
less the same basket of goods in the 
economy, but when you have got more 
dollars in the American economy be-
cause we are effectively printing more, 
each dollar matters less. It buys less— 
everything from gas to groceries, from 
housing to healthcare. Poor and mid-
dle-class 
American 
families 
suffer 
while the wealthy and well connected 
might benefit. And a small handful of 
politicians receive a pat on the back, 
thanking them, congratulating them 
as they congratulate themselves and 
each other for what they characterize 
as a job well done. 
Sure, they will always be able to 
point to someone who benefits from the 
programs they are sponsoring that 
they are creating. Some of those people 
won’t be wealthy and well-connected 
interests. Some of them will be deserv-
ing families, some of them, poor and 
middle-class American families. But, 
you know, most families are just made 
poorer as government expands its foot-
print. 
Let’s look at what happened last 
year alone. During the last few years 
before the pandemic, we were bringing 
in about $3 trillion a year in tax rev-
enue. We were spending about $4 tril-
lion—a 
massive, 
embarrassing, 
dis-
graceful, indefensible deficit, an annual 
deficit of about a trillion dollars a 
year. It was inexcusable, especially at 
the height—at the peak—of an eco-
nomic cycle. 
Then the pandemic hit. Last year, we 
still brought in about $3 trillion in tax 
revenue, just as we had expected, just 
as we had during the previous 2 years. 
Only this time we didn’t spend $4 tril-
lion. We spent $6.6 trillion. We brought 
in $3 trillion, and we spent $6.6 trillion. 
We spent more than double what we 
brought in. We spent more money that 
was borrowed than the money that was 
paid into the Treasury. 
What did that do? Well, it dramati-
cally increased the money supply— 
abruptly, in a way that hurts poor and 
middle-class American families. It is a 
predictable, foreseeable result. 
Look, if you are playing Monopoly 
and all of a sudden you decide to just 
double the amount of money that ev-
eryone gets in the game, it doesn’t 
make everybody better off; it just in-
creases the prices that are paid. 
What happens when that is real 
money and those are real people, when 
it is not just plastic game pieces at 
stake, but it is hungry mouths that 
need to be fed and sheltered and cared 
for? That is where it hurts. And that is 
what is so tragic when the Government 
colludes with itself, with a small hand-
ful of people on the outside encour-
aging it to do so, some whispering in 
the ears of the politicians, telling them 
that they will be doing so many great 
things; that the expenditures and the 
expansion of government is worth the 
investment. 
They are not doing it with their own 
money. No, they are doing it with the 
money of America’s poor and middle 
class. It is really a sort of reverse 
Robin Hood sort of thing. We are steal-
ing from the poor to give to the rich 
and the well connected and to give 
good headlines to a small handful of 
politicians. Shame on us. Shame on us 
all. Shame on this institution as we 
have done that. 
Look, I came to the U.S. Senate 11 
years ago, committed to reducing the 
size, the scope, the reach, the cost, and 
the overall footprint of the Federal 
Government and its impact on the lives 
of everyday citizens. I did so based on 
the understanding and based on the in-
disputable fact that whenever govern-
ment expands its reach, it does so at 
the expense of individual liberty and 
individual prosperity. 
It doesn’t mean that government 
doesn’t have a place. It doesn’t mean 
that we don’t need government; quite 
the contrary, we do. But it just means 
that there is always a balancing that 
has to be taken into account. You can’t 
expand government without hurting 
average, everyday people who are sub-
ject to those things. 
Unfortunately, 11 years later, that 
same government is larger, more ex-
pensive, and more burdensome than 
ever before. In a farcically futile sys-
tem, Americans now work for months 
out of every year just to pay their Fed-
eral taxes. Then, after all that is done, 
they are insultingly demeaned and told 
that it is not enough; in fact, it hasn’t 
been enough for a long time. 
Even though some of you who are 
now taxpayers and now voters have 
now worked months—at least weeks, 
maybe months—out of every year just 
to pay your Federal taxes, and even 
though a lot of this debt may have 
been accumulated before some of you 
were old enough to vote or some of you 
were even born, no matter. You have 
got to pay it. This is making that 
worse. We are making it worse for 
present living Americans, those who 
are of voting age, working age, tax-
paying age, and those who are not. And 
it is also adding burdens to those who 
have not even been born, whose parents 
have yet to meet. The regulatory state 
is growing ever more costly in terms of 
its economic impact. 
I have been studying the cost of the 
Federal regulatory system for about 25 
years. I first started thinking about it 
while I was in law school. I remember

law school, and he explained that the 
Federal regulatory system adds what 
he characterized as sort of a backdoor, 
invisible, de facto tax on poor and mid-
dle-class Americans. He explained that 
it is a backdoor invisible tax, it is re-
gressive, and that it affects everyone 
and disproportionately the poor and 
middle class because of the fact that 
nowhere is any consumer able to iden-
tify the precise cost to them. In fact, 
most of them don’t even know that it 
exists because unlike their tax bill, 
there is no return at the end of the 
year. Unlike their sales tax that typi-
cally will show up on someone’s receipt 
or a property tax or anything else, 
there is no written indication of it that 
tells any one taxpayer or citizen what 
it is costing them every year. But it is 
there. 
Anyway, back in I think 1996 or 1997, 
he explained that the Federal regu-
latory system was imposing this back-
door, invisible, highly regressive tax on 
Americans to the tune of $3 or $400 bil-
lion a year. I remember thinking, this 
is staggering, because that is a lot of 
money. It is a lot of money that could 
otherwise go toward other priorities, 
whether in the government, you know, 
shoring up Social Security or Medi-
care; or some other program providing 
for soldiers, sailors, airmen, and ma-
rines with what they need; or in the 
lives of families, providing for housing, 
education, for nourishment or other 
needs of our children. It just goes into 
the cost of complying with Federal reg-
ulations. 
So, yes, Americans do pay for that, 
we explained; they just pay for it in a 
way that they can’t quite see. There is 
no single bill that tallies the size of the 
expense for it, but they do pay for it 
nonetheless. They pay for it with high-
er prices on goods and services, every-
thing they buy, and they also pay for it 
with diminished wages, unemployment, 
and underemployment. 
So here we are 25 years later. No one 
knows for sure what the Federal regu-
latory system costs, but most esti-
mates I have seen of late put the num-
ber at about $2 trillion a year—$2 tril-
lion. That is the backdoor, invisible 
tax that Americans pay through higher 
prices on goods and services, dimin-
ished 
wages, 
unemployment, 
and 
underemployment, due to what it costs 
to comply with Federal regulations. 
Most people don’t even think much 
about Federal regulations, and with 
good reason. People have other, better 
things to do. Those who do think about 
them are perhaps inclined to think— 
maybe because they have been taught 
to think or because they have never 
been 
taught 
otherwise—that 
these 
costs are borne by billionaires; that 
they are borne by big, blue chip cor-
porations or a type of industrial tycoon 
whom you would associate with a Mo-
nopoly game piece perhaps. But they 
are, in fact, borne by poor and middle- 
class Americans everywhere. That is 
money they can’t get back, on top of 
the money they had to pay after work-
ing weeks or months out of every year 
just to pay their Federal taxes, and 
then being told: By the way, after the 
$2 trillion that you as a people were re-
quired to pay through this backdoor, 
invisible, highly regressive regulatory 
tax, so to speak, and on top of the $3 
trillion that you paid on your taxes, it 
is still not enough because we are now 
nearly $29 trillion in debt. It is sad. It 
is insulting. It is discouraging. 
I mentioned inflation a minute ago, 
and I want to get back to that for a 
moment. It is the natural, foreseeable 
consequence of a government that real-
ly knows no limits on what it is there 
to do and knows essentially no limits 
on what it can spend. These days, if the 
Federal Government can dream it, if 
politicians can desire it, they can fund 
it. 
There has never been an institution 
on planet Earth that had access to 
more capital than the Federal Govern-
ment does. There has never been a gov-
ernment in the existence of planet 
Earth that has had the ability to 
produce the amount of wealth that this 
Nation has and the ability of its people 
to produce that wealth and the ability 
of the government to spend that 
amount of money. Because of that, this 
government also has tremendous bar-
gaining power, and it has correspond-
ingly 
tremendous 
borrowing 
power 
that goes along with that. 
In other words, because the American 
economy has been strong and because 
the U.S. dollar has been the world’s re-
serve currency of choice, that has 
given us this ability. It might make it 
seem like money, while not growing on 
trees technically, can be sort of printed 
into existence, just taken out of thin 
air, and that we won’t feel the con-
sequence for it. 
Now, you can get away with that a 
little bit longer when you have the 
world’s reserve currency and in an 
economy as large as ours, with credit 
that has been relatively good compared 
to that of other sovereign nations, but 
it does have limits, and we are seeing 
those limits now. We are seeing them 
in ways that we haven’t seen yet. I was 
worried about this, scared to death of 
it 10, 11 years ago when I first got here, 
but it is so much worse now. It is so 
much worse now because we have be-
haved in a way that has made it worse. 
You can’t hide it for that long. The 
piper eventually has to be paid, and the 
consequences 
can 
eventually 
make 
themselves known. It is finally start-
ing to harm American families by re-
ducing their real earnings and under-
cutting their purchasing power. 
In new research that we just released 
this week, the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, Republicans—and I am the 
ranking 
Republican 
on 
that 
com-
mittee—found that these rising prices 
are brought about as a result of a mix 
of two types of inflation: transitory in-
flation and more lasting inflation 
brought about by runaway government 
spending. We found that government 
stimulus measures have ignited more 
lasting and more systemic inflation. 
These inflationary pressures are build-
ing on transitory inflation, and they 
are pushing prices higher. 
That is why I am really concerned 
that, over a year after the recession of-
ficially ended, Congress continues un-
daunted, unhindered, and seemingly 
more eager than ever in its desire to 
pursue new massive government spend-
ing measures, including a $3.5 trillion 
budget resolution—the single largest 
spending package in history. 
If 
Congress 
continues 
to 
pursue 
spending packages that boost consumer 
demand while at the same time de-
pressing employment and investment, 
which is exactly what we are doing, 
then government-induced inflation will 
increase even further, with even more 
drastic, painful consequences for us all 
but especially for America’s poor and 
middle class. The wealthy and well 
connected 
will 
do 
just 
fine. 
The 
wealthiest among us will probably get 
richer as a result. The politicians 
among us who vote for these things 
will probably be patted on the back, 
congratulated by a compliant, dutiful 
news media, and, most importantly, 
congratulated by each other, while 
poor and middle-class Americans will 
be left silently carrying the bill and 
bearing the pain of what they are doing 
to them. 
Congress should consider the infla-
tionary risks of this pattern of unfet-
tered, unrestrained government spend-
ing. My colleagues should be aware 
that the costs go beyond the simple 
sticker price of new spending. 
The American people will be better 
served by policies that are geared to-
ward returning Americans to work and 
removing barriers to business invest-
ment in American workers. But we are 
not doing that. We are going in the op-
posite direction of where we should, 
and as a result, Americans are paying 
the price, especially poor and middle- 
class Americans. 
It is certainly affecting people in my 
home State of Utah. Eighty-five per-
cent of Utahans who were polled re-
cently said that they were concerned 
about inflation, and they have reason 
to be. We have data from all over the 
country. Look, nationwide, overall, 
prices are up 5.3 percent over last year, 
just in 1 year alone—5.3 percent overall 
nationwide. In some areas of the econ-
omy, it is particularly acute. You see 
it in meat prices, which are up 8 per-
cent overall from last year. Beef is an 
astounding 12 percent more expensive 
than last year. Milk is 10 percent more 
expensive. Gasoline costs 50 percent 
more than it did a year ago. In the Salt 
Lake City area, home prices are up 26 
percent above where they were last 
year. So everything from gas to gro-
ceries 
and 
from 
housing 
to 
healthcare—they are all going up in 
like fashion. 
Global supply chains, quite frankly, 
can’t keep up. Warnings are already 
being raised about holiday shortages 
and huge price increases as there just

aren’t enough goods in the entire econ-
omy to meet demand, because, again, 
you just add more money to it. It 
doesn’t make it more affordable; it 
makes it less affordable. More spending 
and therefore more money chasing 
fewer goods will only cause prices to 
rise even more. That hurts the poorest 
Americans the most. 
The Federal Government prioritizes 
those who are already wealthy and well 
connected with its spending, and its 
politicians right here in this Chamber 
congratulate 
themselves 
and 
each 
other and are congratulated by a com-
pliant mainstream news media that for 
whatever 
reason 
always 
wants 
to 
praise the expansion of the Federal 
Government even when it hurts Amer-
ica’s poor and middle class, which it 
does. 
Americans are paying the price. Poor 
and middle-class Americans are paying 
the price—those least able to do any-
thing about it. Yes, we are causing 
that. Those we prioritize, helping the 
wealthy and well connected with this 
kind of spending—those Americans who 
don’t have paid lobbyists are left in the 
dust, holding the bags and harmed the 
most. 
We aren’t cold or calloused for reject-
ing more spending—no, no. We are con-
sidering those who end up paying the 
price for this Monopoly money ploy to 
spend 
without 
end. 
The 
everyday 
Americans, the hard-working Ameri-
cans shouldn’t be harmed like this. Yet 
they are going to be. They are already 
feeling that. It is indefensible. 
So we are nearing the point of nearly 
$29 trillion in our national debt. It is 
the highest debt in our Nation’s his-
tory. The debt-to-GDP ratio is now 
over 125 percent. As I mentioned a few 
minutes ago, debt-to-GDP ratio, where 
economic growth around the world 
throughout 
human 
history—growth 
tends to stall out once we cross that 
100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. Just a 
couple of years ago, we were still in the 
80-percent range, and now we are at 
about 125 percent. 
Politicians have promised to deal 
with the national debt for decades. 
They promised it over and over and 
over again, and now the argument has 
shifted. Some on the other side of the 
aisle are saying that debt doesn’t mat-
ter or that it might even be good. In 
fact, they are saying that it is so nec-
essary that if we don’t add to it, if we 
don’t augment it, if we don’t feed this 
beast, then we are somehow going to 
cause an economic catastrophe. 
Now, look, it may be good for their 
socialist makeover of America. It is 
disastrous for the people back home, 
especially those who they claim will be 
benefitting from it. The debt has 
reached absolutely unimaginable lev-
els. It is almost $230,000 per taxpayer, 
nearing $87,000 per citizen. 
Meanwhile, 
businesses 
across 
the 
country are struggling to keep their 
doors open among labor shortages, sky-
rocketing prices, heavy regulation, 
vaccine and other mandates, and peo-
ple losing their jobs. 
Because the President of the United 
States is using authority he doesn’t 
have through an order he is unwilling 
to even share with us, they are going to 
choose, in some cases, between getting 
a vaccine that in some cases might be 
hazardous to their health based on 
unique circumstances and the judg-
ment of their own doctor—yet they 
have to choose between getting the 
vaccine and losing their job. 
Many businesses are barely inching 
along. So, no, they don’t need more 
government spending. In fact, talking 
to countless business owners in Utah, 
more spending is the last thing they 
need. But it is certainly the last thing 
that poor and middle-class Americans 
need. What happens when we do that is 
they all get poorer, even as we are con-
gratulated and we congratulate each 
other for expanding government yet 
again. 
I have had recent conversations with 
a number of businessowners who, be-
cause of the heavy hand, the heavy 
spending practices of government, have 
been unable to keep themselves even in 
business. 
I spoke to one of many restaurant 
owners recently who explained his in-
ability, even after increasing repeat-
edly the offering price, offering huge, 
huge sign-in bonuses—$15, then $16, 
then $18, then $19, then $20 an hour on 
top of that hiring bonus just to hire 
people to work in his restaurant in a 
college town with a lot of young people 
who are usually willing to work in res-
taurants. They couldn’t do it because 
of government interference. The gov-
ernment was competing with them. 
The government was paying people 
more to not work than they could be 
paid to work. This is only compounding 
the problem. 
None of this would be possible if we 
weren’t effectively operating this gov-
ernment with a printing press that 
makes the American people poorer. 
So, yes, I signed that letter 2 months 
ago, along with 46 Republican Sen-
ators, almost the entire Senate Repub-
lican Conference. I signed that not just 
because the letter looked neat, not be-
cause it would get praise—I know we 
would get the opposite of that in the 
press—but because of the people we 
represent, especially the poor and mid-
dle class we represent, who will be 
made poorer and less secure every sin-
gle time we do this. 
I can’t vote to raise this debt ceiling, 
not right now, especially given the 
plans at play to increase spending im-
mediately by another $3.5 trillion, 
which according to some is only as low 
as $3.5 trillion because of creative ac-
counting. But the real number might 
be more than $5 trillion. Regardless, we 
can’t do that. We can’t afford that. 
It is not that the government can’t 
physically do it—we know its ability to 
do it—but we also know that when it 
exercises that ability to do that, poor 
and middle-class Americans suffer. 
I can’t do this to them, neither 
should any of us. 
Thank you.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER

KAINE). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I rise to 
address the elephant in the room that 
almost no one is talking about. Every-
one is talking about the debt limit, but 
almost no one is talking about the 
debt. 
I am a rancher, and I often think 
about policy in ranching terms. This is 
‘‘all hat, no cattle’’ politics. 
We are starting down a track of a $29 
trillion national debt. Let me say that 
again: a $29 trillion debt. 
When I first came to Congress, it was 
just under $10 trillion, which seemed at 
the time an insurmountable debt. Now, 
we are getting closer to $30 trillion. 
Certainly, if the spending that is being 
entertained by the majority party and 
the Biden administration passes, we 
will be well over $30 trillion. 
In the immortal, but edited, words of 
Jimmy MacMillan—‘‘the rent is too 
[dang] high,’’ guy—the debt is too dang 
high. 
Another sobering statistic that was 
raised by the last speaker, in February, 
the Congressional Budget Office said 
that the national debt would surpass 
the economy’s size this year, meaning 
the debt-to-GDP ratio has long been an 
indicator of the country’s fiscal health 
and countries have historically tended 
to decline once their debt surpassed 
their gross domestic product. This 
year, that country is us. It is the 
United States of America. Remember, 
countries 
historically 
decline 
once 
their debt passes their gross domestic 
product. That is what is happening 
here. 
It is a very sobering thought, but not 
a thought that is part of the debate for 
raising the debt ceiling. The debt ceil-
ing increase that is being discussed 
now is so more spending can occur 
without addressing our debt-to-GDP 
ratio. We cannot go on like this. It is 
irresponsible at the deepest levels. 
Now, I understand and I appreciate 
the concerns that have led to this 
short-term debt limit deal, but the fact 
of the matter is, unless we actually ad-
dress the spending problems that are 
driving our national debt—and soon— 
we are already saddling future genera-
tions of people in my State of Wyoming 
and all the American people with a 
debt that they will never be able to 
repay. And soon, interest payments on 
that debt will crowd out other spend-
ing. The only reason it hasn’t happened 
already is because interest rates have 
been relatively low. 
But we have to pay interest on our 
debt before we pay other things, in-
cluding the things that are in the ma-
jority party and the Biden administra-
tion’s $3.5 trillion plan. I believe this is 
unforgiveable. 
Now, I am new to the Senate, so I 
was not here the last time we had to 
address the debt ceiling issue. But the 
last time it came up, it was Repub-
licans who were the majority party and 
were on the dance floor by themselves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6983 
October 7, 2021 
Since Republicans were in power in 
Senate, Democrats left the Republicans 
to dance by themselves and raise the 
debt limit alone. So anyone talking 
about this issue today needs to recog-
nize that history. 
It is normal for the party in power— 
where now the Democrats control the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House, it is normal for them to raise 
the debt ceiling. 
The problem is that both when Re-
publicans have been in the majority 
and have raised the debt ceiling and 
now Democrats are in the majority and 
are going to raise the debt ceiling, nei-
ther party seems to talk about the 
debt. They only talk about raising the 
debt ceiling. 
It is really kind of shocking that the 
main focus of this debate, whenever it 
occurs, is never on how we got here. It 
is never on why we spend too much. It 
is never on the debt itself. It is always 
on just raising the ceiling or sus-
pending the ceiling so we can spend 
more, so we can run up more debt, so 
we can have higher interest payments 
that can crowd out other spending, 
that can create the vicious cycle that 
creates deficit after deficit after def-
icit. 
Our colleagues on the left can throw 
back at any Republican here that 
spending has gone on like drunken sail-
ors, even among Republicans, and they 
are not wrong—and, also, I mean no 
disrespect to the Navy in referencing 
sailors. Happy birthday to the Navy, 
celebrating its 246th birthday yester-
day. 
There is a lot of blame to go around 
here. What I would like to see us do is 
get together, both parties, all col-
leagues who are interested in this sub-
ject, come up with a way to address our 
debt, to balance our budget, whether it 
is freezing spending or addressing our 
trust funds or recognizing how we can 
fix our entitlement programs or how 
we can make the Social Security fund 
solvent, which we know how to do and 
do not have the political courage to do. 
We have to contain these massive in-
terest payments. We must start ad-
dressing this issue. 
Earlier this year, I proposed the Sus-
tainable Budget Act to create bipar-
tisan solutions to our long-term spend-
ing. 
The 
Sustainable 
Budget 
Act 
should be on the table. 
My colleagues Senators ROMNEY and 
MANCHIN also introduced the Trust Act 
to shore up the long-term fiscal sol-
vency of our trust funds. That is an-
other bill that should be on the table 
at the same time that we are debating 
raising the debt ceiling. 
Both of these ideas are worthy pro-
posals that we should be discussing 
now on a bipartisan basis because this 
problem isn’t one that only affects one 
party. When the time comes to pay the 
bill, our debt holders don’t care—won’t 
care—if you are a Republican or a 
Democrat. They only care about get-
ting paid, and we are swiftly approach-
ing a time when we will be unable to do 
so. 
You know, one of the reasons that I 
became so interested in digital cur-
rencies, in nonfiat currencies, is be-
cause they are not issued by a govern-
ment. Bitcoin is not issued by a gov-
ernment, so it is not beholding to the 
debts that are run up by governments, 
including the greatest government that 
has ever existed on the face of the 
Earth, the United States of America. 
The United States of America is now 
at the point where our debt exceeds our 
GDP ratio. It is the point at which na-
tions decline. If we are going to let the 
dollar decline, having the lessons of 
history in front of us, and failing to 
act, we are truly irresponsible. 
In the event that that contingency 
occurs, I want to make sure that 
nonfiat 
currencies—currencies 
not 
issued by government, currencies not 
beholden to political elections—can 
grow, can allow people to save, can be 
there in the event that we fail at what 
we know we have to do. 
There is no proof yet in the 21st cen-
tury that we are going to make this 
right. Time and again, in the U.S. 
House and the Senate, time and again, 
Presidents of both parties have run up 
the debt irresponsibly, with no plan to 
address it. So thank God for bitcoin 
and other nonfiat currencies that tran-
scends the irresponsibility of govern-
ments, including our own. That is an 
indictment 
of 
our 
responsibility— 
Democrats and Republicans, Presidents 
and Congress—our responsibility to ad-
dress this looming, predictable, mas-
sive issue. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak for the generations of Americans 
who this body is irresponsibly drown-
ing in debt. 
Now, to be clear, debt is a bipartisan 
problem. Debt is a problem both par-
ties bear substantial responsibility for. 
To understand just how true that is, 
we need look back just 21 years. In the 
year 2000, when this century began, our 
national debt stood at roughly $5 tril-
lion. 
Mr. President, I want you to pause 
and think about that. The year 2000 
wasn’t that long ago. Five trillion dol-
lars is the total amount we owed. 
In 2001, George W. Bush became 
President. During the 8 years of Bush’s 
Presidency, the debt doubled from $5 
trillion to $10 trillion. My party bears 
a significant degree of responsibility 
for that growth. 
Then in 2008, Barack Obama was 
elected President; and over the next 8 
years, the debt doubled again, from $10 
trillion to $20 trillion. 
I want you to pause and reflect on 
that. The $5 trillion debt that we start-
ed the 21st century with had been accu-
mulated by 42 Presidents over two cen-
turies; and then two Presidents, over 16 
years, one a Republican and one a 
Democrat, took our debt and increased 
it by 300 percent, quadrupled the Na-
tion’s debt in 16 years. 
As we stand here today in 2021, some 
9 months into the Joe Biden Presi-
dency, the debt is roughly $29 trillion. 
My home State, the great State of 
Texas, has roughly 29 million residents. 
That means the national debt is $1 mil-
lion for every man, woman, and child 
in the State of Texas. That is reckless 
and irresponsible. 
Now, 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
point out that Republicans spent too 
much during the Trump Presidency. I 
agree. Much of that spending I voted 
against. And I would note last year was 
an extraordinary year with a pandemic 
unlike anything any of us have ever 
seen in our lives. I wish Republicans 
had been better at exercising fiscal re-
sponsibility when we had control of the 
White House and both houses of Con-
gress. 
The unfortunate reality in this body, 
though, is that when you have a multi-
trillion-dollar spending bill, you can 
usually count on the votes of every sin-
gle Democrat and about half the Re-
publicans. So on spending bill after 
spending bill, we see 75 to 80 Senators 
coming 
together—usually 
all 
the 
Democrats and half the Republicans. 
And there are about 20 of us who try 
to say: Why are we bankrupting our 
kids 
and 
grandkids? 
Why 
are 
we 
digging the hole deeper and deeper and 
deeper? 
But that is—at least right now—a mi-
nority view in this body. 
But the fact that my party bears sig-
nificant responsibility for the debt we 
have today is not to draw an equiva-
lency between what has happened in 
the past and what is happening right 
now, because, Mr. President, what Sen-
ate Democrats, what House Democrats, 
and what President Biden are doing 
now has no precedence in our Nation’s 
history. It is an order of magnitude dif-
ferent. 
Senate 
Democrats, 
House 
Democrats, and President Biden, if the 
spending proposals they have put forth 
pass, within a 12-month period, they 
will have spent $9.5 trillion. 
One of the problems people have at 
home is understanding big numbers. A 
million, a billion, a trillion—they have 
all got an ‘‘illion’’ in them. It is hard 
to tell the difference. That just sounds 
like a lot of money. 
Well, let’s put $9.5 trillion in context: 
$9.5 trillion is more than twice what 
the United States spent to win World 
War II. The entire course of the war, it 
cost us less than half of that to save 
the free world and defeat the Nazis. 
And Washington Democrats are trying 
to spend that in 12 months. It is wildly 
irresponsible. It is reckless. 
They are trying to accompany that 
with trillions of dollars of new taxes. If 
the Democrats get their way, every tax 
you can think of is going up. Individual 
income tax is going up. Corporate taxes 
are going up. Small business taxes are 
going up. Capital gains taxes are going 
up. The death tax is going up. Farmers 
are paying more in taxes. Ranchers are 
paying more in taxes. Small businesses 
are paying more in taxes. Working 
families are paying more in taxes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6984 
October 7, 2021 
Joe Biden campaigned promising no 
one who makes $400,000 a year or less 
will see their taxes go up. That state-
ment was a flat-out falsehood. 
And, by the way, look, I recognize 
Joe Biden and I are of a different party, 
so maybe you are inclined not to credit 
me with my assessment of the truth or 
falsity of President Biden’s promise. 
Well, if you don’t take my word for 
it, take the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation’s word for it, that analyzed the 
Democrats’ tax program and found, for 
roughly 80 percent of Americans, taxes 
either stay the same or go up; that it is 
cutting taxes for a very small portion 
of Americans. It is raising taxes on 
people with incomes as low as $40,000 a 
year. 
By the way, it is also worth noting 
part of the Democratic talking points 
is that the deficit is driven by the 2017 
tax cuts. Those are good partisan talk-
ing points. Those will get a round of 
applause in any Democratic gathering. 
Although I say that, with all candor, 
Mr. President, I haven’t been to many 
Democratic gatherings, but I feel con-
fident that is accurate; that Democrats 
like: ‘‘Yes, too many tax cuts.’’ 
Before you are inclined just to be-
lieve that political rhetoric, however, 
you might at least pause to look at the 
facts, to look at the numbers. And the 
facts and numbers show that, after we 
passed the 2017 tax cuts, cutting taxes 
on working families across this coun-
try, that we saw record prosperity; we 
saw the lowest unemployment in 50 
years; we saw the lowest African Amer-
ican unemployment ever recorded; we 
saw the lowest Hispanic unemployment 
ever recorded; and we saw Federal tax 
revenues go up. 
So the next time you hear a Demo-
crat say the debt comes from the tax 
cut, it just ain’t so. The next year, the 
Treasury got more money in taxes 
than it had the year before. So the 
Democratic narrative about tax cuts 
driving the debt is—to borrow a term 
from the current President—malarkey. 
The debt that we are facing as a re-
sult of this wild spending spree is going 
up and up and up, and one of the con-
sequences of that spending and that 
debt is we are seeing an inflation bomb 
going off in this country. 
Now, for younger Americans, infla-
tion may not sound very real. Inflation 
is not something we have lived with in 
recent times. We have been in this sort 
of weird holiday from economic history 
with inflation being very, very low. 
Mr. President, you and I are both old 
enough to remember the 1970s. We are 
both old enough to remember double- 
digit 
inflation, 
21-percent 
interest 
rates. 
Inflation is a cruel tax, and it is a tax 
on everybody, but it is particularly 
cruel on the most vulnerable. 
You know who gets hammered with 
inflation? Senior citizens, seniors who 
spent their whole lives saving. And 
they suddenly see the values of their 
savings going down and down and down 
because Washington politicians are de-
valuing their money—seniors who are 
on a fixed income get the same amount 
of money each month, but suddenly the 
cost of everything goes up. 
Right now, today, all across this 
country—in Texas, in Virginia, and in 
every other State—prices are going up. 
The cost of gasoline has skyrocketed as 
a direct result of Joe Biden and the 
Democrats’ policies. The cost of food is 
going up. The cost of rent is going up. 
The cost of lumber is going up. The 
cost of homes is going up. 
According to the chief economist at 
Moody’s 
Analytics, 
for 
households 
earning the U.S. median annual in-
come, which is about $70,000 a year, the 
current inflation rate has forced them 
to spend another $175 a month in food 
and fuel and housing. That works out 
to $2,100 a year. 
So each month, if your family is at 
the median income level in the United 
States, the Democrat inflation tax is 
about 175 bucks a month. And that is 
before their massive tax rates kick in, 
and that is before this body passes the 
Bernie Sanders socialist budget. 
It is worth noting just how radical 
these Democrats are. President Biden 
is in the White House; that is true. But 
in the Senate, Senate Democrats have 
the slimmest majority possible. This is 
a 50–50 body. It is only by virtue of the 
Vice President’s tie-breaking vote that 
they have any majority at all. Yet 
Democrats have interpreted this in-
credibly close election as a mandate to 
radically transform this country. 
Joe Biden didn’t campaign on that. 
Joe Biden campaigned as a nice, happy, 
centrist moderate. No more mean 
tweets. Nothing to scare you at home. 
We are just going to return to the hal-
cyon days of yesteryear. 
Five years ago—well, let’s go back 
even further than that. Nine years ago, 
Mr. President, when you and I were 
both elected to the Senate—we arrived 
here the exact same time. Nine years 
ago, there was exactly one socialist in 
this body that admitted he was a so-
cialist. That was BERNIE SANDERS. 
If you asked Senator SANDERS, he 
would say: I am a socialist. I am not a 
Democrat. I am running as a socialist. 
And most of the Democrats in this 
body would say: No, no, no. That is not 
me. I am not a socialist like him. 
That was a fringe view. Even in the 
2020 election, Joe Biden, when he was 
running in a primary against BERNIE 
SANDERS, said: No, no, no. I am not a 
socialist. 
Well, today, BERNIE SANDERS is the 
chairman of the Budget Committee. We 
are in the midst of debating, passing, 
the Bernie Sanders socialist budget— 
$5.5 trillion. That is radical. That is ex-
treme. And I think our Democratic col-
leagues are too scared of the left flank 
in their own party to dare stand up to 
it. 
Now, in addition to the reckless 
spending, to the reckless taxes they are 
trying to ram through, to the massive 
debt they are trying to ram through, 
we also have a radical agenda across 
the country, including on our southern 
border, where we are facing a crisis on 
our southern border. Over 2 million 
people are expected to cross illegally 
this year. The highest rate of illegal 
immigration in 21 years, and congres-
sional Democrats refuse to do anything 
about it. 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS have 
handed the agenda over to the open- 
border radicals, and we are seeing a 
public health crisis; we are seeing a na-
tional security crisis; we are seeing a 
humanitarian crisis as a result. 
As bad as the economic and domestic 
policy has been, the foreign policy has 
been even worse, including the greatest 
national security disaster and foreign 
policy disaster in a generation—the ut-
terly incompetent and calamitous sur-
render in Afghanistan. 
All of that extreme agenda is being 
pushed by Joe Biden and CHUCK SCHU-
MER and NANCY PELOSI, which brings us 
to our present crisis, the debt ceiling 
crisis. 
Our national debt is roughly $29 tril-
lion. Yet Democrats want to add tril-
lions more to that. How many tril-
lions? We don’t know. They are bat-
tling within their conference just how 
many trillions more with which to sad-
dle this country, but it is going to be a 
lot. 
But do you know the curious thing? 
This crisis is 100 percent manufactured 
by Democrats. Why is that? Because 
for the entirety of this Congress, 
Democrats have had complete, 100-per-
cent power to raise the debt ceiling 
anytime they have wanted. 
How is that? Well, ordinarily, in this 
body, the way legislation moves, it 
needs 60 votes to move. It is called the 
legislative filibuster. But there is an 
exception to that, and it is a big excep-
tion. It is called budget reconciliation. 
It comes from the Budget Act of 1974. 
Under budget reconciliation, you only 
need 50 votes, not 60 votes. It is the big-
gest exception that exists to the fili-
buster rule. 
Democrats, unfortunately, have 50 
votes in this body. They have a major-
ity in the House, and they have the 
White House. That means Democrats, 
using budget reconciliation—and it is 
clear, by the way, that you can raise 
the debt ceiling by using budget rec-
onciliation—could have raised the debt 
ceiling in January. They didn’t. They 
could have raised the debt ceiling in 
February. They didn’t. They could 
have raised it in March or April or May 
or June, July, August, September. 
They didn’t. We are in October. Demo-
crats could have raised the debt ceiling 
today. They didn’t. They could have 
done it with only Democratic votes, 
and there would not have been a single 
thing Republicans could have done to 
stop them. They know that. They don’t 
dispute that. 
So why are we facing a crisis? If, for 
10 months, Democrats could have done 
this anytime they had wanted, why 
didn’t they? Well, it is because there 
are at least some Democrats who real-
ize that drowning the Nation in debt

October 7, 2021 
and spending and taxes is not popular 
back home. The voters don’t like it. 
So, instead, Majority Leader SCHU-
MER has not once, not twice, but three 
times tried to move a legislative vehi-
cle to raise the debt ceiling that re-
quires 60 votes. He didn’t have to do it. 
He could have done it using reconcili-
ation and using only Democratic votes. 
He had the total power to do that, but 
he didn’t want to do that. He wanted to 
use it—to move it forward in a way 
that required at least 10 Republicans to 
join with him. Why? There is one and 
only one reason for this. I would chal-
lenge any Senate Democrats to ask 
Majority Leader SCHUMER if there is 
any other reason he proffered for not 
doing what he could have done at any 
time, day or night. The only reason is 
to obscure accountability. The only 
reason is to blame some of that debt on 
Republicans so that Senate Democrats 
could claim: Hey, both parties did it. 
What the Democrats are doing right 
now is unprecedented. It is radical. 
They know it, and they are scared of it. 
So what are we seeing instead? We are 
seeing CHUCK SCHUMER tell the Amer-
ican people: We are on the verge of a 
default. We are seeing Joe Biden 
threaten that the United States will 
default on our debt. We are seeing the 
Treasury Secretary threaten that the 
United States will default on our debt. 
Joe Biden’s threats to default on the 
debt are wildly reckless and irrespon-
sible. 
Let me be clear so that no one is con-
fused: The United States should never, 
ever, ever default on our debt—period. 
All 100 Senators in this Chamber agree 
with that. There is not a single Sen-
ator in either party who believes the 
United States should default on our 
debt. 
Why does Joe Biden go on national 
television and threaten to default on 
the debt when he could have raised the 
debt ceiling anytime he wanted? Be-
cause he is playing a game of political 
brinksmanship, threatening a calami-
tous result on the American economy 
because he wants to browbeat Repub-
licans into serving as a smokescreen to 
help hide the responsibility Democrats 
pay for their massive spending and 
debt. 
I have got to say, for the last several 
months, I was proud of my party. The 
Republicans were united. We were 
standing together. We were standing as 
one. And every single Republican—all 
50 Republicans were telling anyone who 
would listen: We will not participate in 
raising the debt ceiling. If the Demo-
crats are going to raise trillions in 
spending, they need to raise the debt 
ceiling and own the debt that their 
reckless spending is producing. Our 
party was completely united. 
The Republican leader and I—and he 
and I have had significant disagree-
ments over the years, but on this ques-
tion, we were in exactly the same 
place. We were saying exactly the same 
thing. Our conference has a wide range 
of views from conservatives to mod-
erates to libertarians. All 50 of us were 
on the same page. The Democrats have 
the power to raise the debt ceiling on 
their own. They are engaged in wildly 
reckless spending, and if they are going 
to do that, they need to be the ones to 
vote for this debt. 
We were united for 2 months. Indeed, 
46 of us signed a letter to CHUCK SCHU-
MER, I think 2 months ago, making 
clear what our position was. I helped 
write that letter. It was not a fringe 
position of a couple of members of the 
conference; we got 46 out of 50 Repub-
lican Senators to sign it. So SCHUMER 
knew. PELOSI knew. Biden knew. But 
they chose to engage in reckless 
brinksmanship. 
Now, I believe the end result of this 
game of chicken was clear: that Demo-
cratic Leader SCHUMER was on a path 
to surrender. He was on a path to doing 
what he should have done a week ago 
or 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks ago or a 
month ago or 2 months ago, which is 
moving a reconciliation bill and rais-
ing the debt ceiling. 
I can tell you there were Democratic 
Senators—multiple Democratic Sen-
ators—coming to me and coming to the 
other members of my party, saying: 
OK. How much time would it take to 
move a reconciliation bill? Can we get 
it done in time for the October 18 date 
that the Treasury Secretary has laid 
out? 
To a person, Republicans answered: 
Yes, there is plenty of time, under the 
rules of reconciliation, to move for-
ward. There is no barrier. You have all 
the time you need. 
I believe Democratic Leader SCHU-
MER was on the verge of surrendering, 
and then unfortunately, yesterday, Re-
publicans blinked. I think that was a 
mistake. I think that was the wrong 
decision. 
Now, I will tell you, the reason Re-
publican leadership made that decision 
to blink was because Senate Democrats 
threatened to nuke the filibuster, to 
eliminate the filibuster. I don’t know if 
that threat was real. I don’t know if 
they would have carried through on it 
or not. But I understand why Repub-
lican leadership blinked. Ending the 
filibuster would enable the Democrats 
to pass an even more radical agenda 
than the one they are doing right now. 
It would enable the Democrats to pass 
things that would profoundly alter this 
Nation, perhaps irreparably. So I un-
derstand why Republican leadership 
blinked, but I wish they had not. I wish 
they had not because I believe we were 
on the verge of victory. 
The American people agreed with us. 
The Democratic position, on its face, 
was objectively unreasonable. Here is 
the Democratic position: We have com-
plete power to raise the debt ceiling 
anytime we want, but the only way we 
will do it is if Republicans do it with 
us. Otherwise, we will default on the 
debt. 
Even the Capitol Hill press corps— 
and, Mr. President, in your quieter mo-
ments, you will admit it leans very far 
left—even the Capitol Hill press corps 
knew that was ridiculous. 
So unfortunately, yesterday, we were 
on the verge of victory, but we turned 
that victory into defeat. 
Now, let’s be clear what the order of 
magnitude of this defeat is. We are 
soon going to vote on moving to take 
up the debt ceiling. The political 
games played by Democratic Leader 
SCHUMER may have prevailed in the 
short term by cajoling 10 or more Re-
publicans to vote with the Democrats 
to allow a vote on the debt ceiling. I 
hope that doesn’t happen. I hope we de-
feat that vote. I am certainly going to 
vote no, and I am urging my colleagues 
to vote no. But if 60 or more Senators 
vote to take up the vote, then we will 
see a clear divide. On the debt ceiling, 
all 50 Republicans will vote no. On the 
debt ceiling, all 50 Democrats will vote 
yes. We will see a clear divide. I wish it 
had happened without the political 
games, without the political theater, 
that Democratic leadership played. 
One of the reasons I think it was a 
mistake for Republican leadership to 
give in to the demands, to the hostage- 
taking, to the political terrorism of the 
other side, is that it significantly hurts 
the credibility of the Republican con-
ference. The Democratic leader is no 
doubt telling every Democratic Sen-
ator: You see, they won’t hold their 
ground. They will give in. All we have 
to do is stand strong, and they won’t 
stand and fight against us. 
Now, I hope that proves nothing more 
than hot air. I hope that proves a bad 
estimation of what Republican Sen-
ators will do. I can tell you this con-
ference remains absolutely united that 
the Bernie Sanders’ socialist budget of 
$5.5 trillion, with trillions in taxes, is 
wildly and recklessly irresponsible and 
would do massive damage to this coun-
try. I hope and believe we will stay 
united on that. But we could have 
stayed united on the debt ceiling as 
well. We could have stayed united in 
making clear that the Democrats had 
every ability to do this on their own, 
but sometimes in a poker game, a bluff 
wins the pot. In this case, to mix my 
metaphors, which would make my high 
school English teacher very angry, in 
the game of chicken, CHUCK SCHUMER 
won this game of chicken. As two 
trucks drove toward each other on a 
country road, one or the other was 
going to turn or you were going to have 
a lot of dead chickens. 
I wish Republicans had not blinked. 
We shouldn’t have done that, but the 
strategic mistake by our leadership 
should not distract from the funda-
mental divide in this body. 
I don’t know why it is the Demo-
cratic Senators look at this last elec-
tion—an unbelievably close election— 
and conclude that there is no need for 
bipartisanship in the Senate, that their 
mandate is to ram through a radical 
and socialist agenda. 
And let me be clear by the way: The 
first major bill the Democrats took up 
was a $1.9 trillion spending bill, a so-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6986 
October 7, 2021 
called COVID relief bill. I say so-called 
COVID relief because only 9 percent of 
the bill was healthcare spending on 
COVID. It was a liberal wish list, pay-
ing off special interests that support 
the Democrats. 
You know, Mr. President, you and I 
were both at Joe Biden’s inauguration. 
We sat on the steps of the Capitol. We 
heard President Biden give what I 
thought was a pretty good speech; a 
speech about unity, a speech about 
coming together, a speech about heal-
ing. 
Sadly, that speech didn’t even last 
the time it took for the words to be 
transmitted over the airways to the 
people listening at home. 
It would have been easy for President 
Biden and Democrats to pass a bipar-
tisan COVID relief bill—easy. There 
were Republicans eager to do so. And 
to show that that is not just empty 
posturing, that that is not just par-
tisan language, last year, when we had 
a Republican majority in the Senate, 
we passed bipartisan COVID relief bills 
not once, not twice, not three times, 
not four times—five times. Five times. 
When Republicans had the majority, 
we didn’t ram through COVID relief 
bills that were hard partisan bills, but, 
instead, we worked together with the 
other side. 
When Joe Biden, who promised heal-
ing and unity, the first big bill he had, 
he made a choice: Do I want to honor 
what I said, or do I want to give into 
the angry socialist left? 
And he rammed through a bill—a $1.9 
trillion 
spending 
bill—that 
in 
the 
House of Representatives got zero Re-
publican votes, and in the Senate got 
zero Republican votes. 
And I have got to tell you, Senate 
Democrats didn’t want a Republican 
vote. There wasn’t even a minute of 
discussion of negotiation. There wasn’t 
an attempt to make it bipartisan. It 
was: We have the power by the nar-
rowest, narrowest margin, and we are 
going to abuse that power. 
And, sadly, it hasn’t changed. It has 
continued. 
This Bernie Sanders, socialist budg-
et—$5.5 trillion—is reckless and par-
tisan, and it will get zero Republican 
votes in the House, it will get zero Re-
publican votes in the Senate—because 
the Democrats believe they have a 
short window to fundamentally trans-
form this Nation and to destroy the 
free market system that has produced 
the greatest prosperity this Nation has 
ever seen. 
This is tragic, and I, for one, will 
continue doing everything humanly 
possible to lead the fight to stop this 
radical agenda that threatens the lives, 
the safety, the security, the liberties, 
the constitutional rights, and the fi-
nancial future of 29 million Texans. 
Bankrupting our kids and grandkids 
is serious business, and the political 
games from the Democrats are meant 
to distract from that. 
And let me note, finally, there is leg-
islation I have supported all 9 years I 
have served in this body. It is legisla-
tion introduced by the Senator from 
Pennsylvania, Senator TOOMEY, called 
the Full Faith and Credit Act, al-
though I actually prefer a different 
name for it. 
The name I prefer is the default pre-
vention act. It is legislation that says, 
in the event the credit limit is not 
raised, the United States will never 
ever, ever default on the debt; that 
even without the credit limit being 
raised, there are tax revenues coming 
in every month. 
So the default prevention act makes 
clear we will prioritize those tax reve-
nues to interest on the debt, to paying 
our Active Duty military, and to So-
cial Security and Medicare. 
Government by crisis would end, or 
at least be substantially mitigated, if 
we pass the default prevention act. 
Earlier today, I was on a radio pro-
gram—Sean Hannity’s radio program, 
where he played an interesting clip of 
Democrats all talking about debt ceil-
ing denial or default denial. 
And I would commend the other 
party. One of the things the Democrats 
do really well is message discipline. 
When they come up with talking 
points, it is remarkable. Every Demo-
crat in these United States of America, 
from Joe Biden down to the county dog 
catcher, they repeat the exact same 
words. 
So Sean Hannity played a whole se-
ries of just clips of Democrats using 
the identical talking points: Debt ceil-
ing denial, default denial. 
You know who is in denial is the 
Democrats. They are in denial that the 
debt ceiling exists. They are in denial 
of the $29 trillion that is bankrupting 
our kids and grandkids. 
And they like these crises. Why do I 
know they like these crises? Because 
they don’t want to pass the default pre-
vention act. 
If the Democratic Senators who give 
speeches about how bad a default would 
be, if they actually believed that, we 
could come together today and we 
could ensure the citizens of Texas, the 
citizens of Virginia, the citizens of 
Utah that there will never ever, ever, 
ever be a default of our debt. 
But if we did that, it would mean 
that Senator SCHUMER
and NANCY 
PELOSI and President Biden couldn’t 
engage in the kind of theatrics, the 
kind of reckless brinksmanship that we 
have seen over the last several weeks. 
That would jeopardize their radical 
agenda. 
I hope and pray that this body, the 
Senate, serves as the last bulwark to 
stop the radical socialist agenda that 
Washington Democrats are trying to 
ram through. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. 
GRAHAM. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
missed most of what Senator CRUZ 
said, but I think I have a general idea 
of what he was going to say. 
So what is this all about tonight? 
Why are we here? 
So the bottom line is we have a debt 
ceiling increase that is coming due 
under our law. The debt ceiling has 
been dealt with numerous times since I 
have been here. 
What is this all about? 
My 
Democratic 
colleagues—we 
worked together to pass a $1.2 trillion 
bill for roads, bridges, ports, and elec-
trical vehicles. I was 1 of 19 Repub-
licans. Made sense to me. 
The reason we have got a debt ceiling 
problem beyond the normal course of 
business is that my Democratic col-
leagues, through reconciliation, are 
going to keep on spending from $31⁄2 to 
$5 trillion that has got zero to do, in 
my view, with infrastructure as we 
know it. It is more about expanding 
the size and scope of government. 
They have every right to pursue this, 
and we, as Republicans, have every 
right to make it hard. 
So Senator MCCONNELL has been say-
ing for 2 months now that if you are 
going to spend the money through rec-
onciliation, you need to raise the debt 
limit through reconciliation. And there 
has been a change of heart here at the 
last minute, but we will be doing this 
again in December. 
So here is my point: I think you 
should do that. I think the reconcili-
ation process is available to you. I 
think you should be required to use it, 
and I don’t intend to help you spend 
any more of this money. 
Now, what does reconciliation mean? 
It means that you can do it by your-
self through a process that allows 50 
votes, not 60. 
As Budget ranking member, I am 
willing to waive the 3 days. I am will-
ing to try to make the process less 
painful. But the point is that you need 
to own this, and that was our position 
until recently. 
We will be doing this again in Decem-
ber, and this idea that the rules of the 
Senate may change because of this 
issue or any other issue—I want to get 
something off my chest. 
When President Trump was Presi-
dent, we had the House and the Senate, 
and there was enormous pressure on 
Republicans to change the rules to get 
everything we wanted, and a lot of 
Democratic colleagues standing up for 
the constitutional filibuster—legisla-
tive filibuster. We sent a letter with 
over 60-something names on it basi-
cally saying to the leaders of the Sen-
ate: Let’s don’t make the Senate the 
House. 
All of a sudden, you are now in 
charge of 50–50, and there is a constant 
stream of threats, coming from the 
President this time, to change the 
rules of the Senate to raise the debt 
limit because you don’t want to use 
reconciliation. 
If you have no more respect for the 
Senate than that, go ahead and change 
the rules. 
I am not going to live the rest of my 
political life under threat. I am asking 
no more of you than I ask of myself. 
So if the reason the Republican 
Party has changed its position is be-
cause we think somehow what we were

doing would put the Senate in peril, 
well, then, the Senate was in peril a lot 
more than we thought it was. 
It never entered my mind to go to 
Democratic colleagues and say: If you 
don’t do a few things that I need to 
have to get people off my ass at home, 
then I may have to do carve-outs of 
this and that. 
I didn’t do it because I don’t think it 
is the right thing to do. I am not going 
to tolerate it now. 
Now, I will work with you when it 
makes sense, but what you are doing 
makes no sense to me, and you need to 
pay a political price for it under the 
rules. 
I am not doing anything illegal. The 
Republican Party wasn’t doing any-
thing backdoor. We said there is a way 
forward on the debt ceiling. It is rec-
onciliation. And that is the process you 
should use because of what you are 
doing in terms of spending all this 
money, and we are just not going to be 
part of making it easy for you to spend 
all this money. 
And here we are. Ten Republicans are 
going to be voting here pretty soon. I 
will not be one of them. 
And to my Republican colleagues: I 
understand where you are coming 
from. I don’t fault you for your vote. 
You know, I was 1 of 19 Republicans 
that voted for an infrastructure pack-
age. A lot of you didn’t agree. Some of 
you were vocal about it. I can take 
criticism from within my party and 
without. I try to be respectful. 
I will be respectful tonight, but here 
is our problem as Republicans: We said 
for 2 months we are going to do one 
thing, and at the end we have done an-
other. 
What does it really matter? 
I don’t know. I think it matters to 
the people who listen to us and have 
some faith in us. 
So to my Democratic colleagues: If 
we get through the night, we will be 
doing this again. And I promise you, 
come December, I will be doing every-
thing I can to give you a reasonable 
reconciliation process to make it as 
painless as possible in terms of process, 
but this is what you should be doing 
because this is what you are doing to 
the country. 
And to my Republican colleagues: We 
will have another bite at this apple, 
and we need to decide who we are and 
what we believe. And if we are not 
going to pursue this strategy anymore, 
let’s just tell the people of the country 
up front it was a bad idea, we shouldn’t 
have done it. I think it wasn’t a bad 
idea, but let’s not mislead people here. 
Let’s not say one thing and do another. 
So I am hoping that we can find a 
way to do some things together before 
now and 2022. There are some things on 
Section 230. The colleague, the Pre-
siding Officer, is one of the best people 
in the world to do things with if you 
are looking for bipartisanship on immi-
gration. We have got a broken border, 
we have got DACA at risk. Maybe we 
can do a small deal on immigration. 
But the point for me is this was a 
self-inflicted wound, and we need not 
do this again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we had a 
number of Senators come to the floor 
over the last couple of hours talking 
about some of the problems that we 
face as a country. They are real, they 
are serious, and they are being made 
more severe still and more severe than 
they need to be by virtue of the step 
that the Senate is, I fear, about to 
take. 
When we extend the debt limit with-
out any plan as to how you are not 
going to be back in the same position 
in just a few more months and you are 
raising it or, as we have been doing it 
lately, just suspending the debt limit, 
you are creating sort of a debt limit 
Mardi Gras, an era in which any 
amount of additional borrowing is per-
mitted during that period. 
It becomes especially dangerous dur-
ing times like this one, where we are 
spending not just to the tune of bil-
lions, not just to the tune of hundreds 
of billions, not just to the tune of a 
trillion more than we take in, but to 
the tune of many trillions more than 
we take in each and every year. That is 
what is hurting poor and middle-class 
American families. It is a reverse 
Robin Hood that is so perverse. It is a 
reverse Robin Hood effect. We are ef-
fectively borrowing—stealing from the 
poor and giving it to the rich and well 
connected, and we are giving the praise 
that accompanies it to the politicians 
who clamor for attention as a result of 
other people spending other people’s 
money that other people will have to 
work for to earn back and to pay it 
back. Some of those people aren’t old 
enough to vote yet; some of them have 
not been born; and some will be born 
years from now to parents who have 
not met. 
It is not fair for us to do that, and 
that is why this isn’t just another debt 
ceiling debate. It is not just another 
debt limit discussion. This one is so 
much bigger than it has been in the 
past. The effects are being felt so much 
more directly than they have at any 
other time in the past when we have 
raised this. 
I know that this can come across to 
a lot of people as an intensely partisan 
place. I understand how people can 
think that. In some ways it is. Every-
thing about it reminds people of that, 
especially the visual images that they 
see. You know, we have got 100 desks in 
here; 50 of them are on that side of the 
aisle, and 50 of them are on this side of 
the aisle. And there are a number of 
issues on which there is a division of 
thought, a set of pretty deep disagree-
ments that sometimes lead to votes 
that break down more or less along 
partisan lines. There is a lot of that. 
In my view, it doesn’t reflect a petu-
lant desire to disagree for the sake of 
being disagreeable. It tends to reflect 
something a little deeper, a little more 
heartfelt, and, more than anything, it 
reflects a genuine difference of opinion 
among the people we represent. 
We don’t like to disagree around 
here. In fact, I like agreeing. I don’t 
like being disagreeable with those on 
the other side of the aisle. Many of my 
very favorite people in the U.S. Senate 
are people who don’t share my party 
affiliation and who are at the opposite 
end of the ideological spectrum for me. 
It makes it that much more fun to 
work with them because there are a 
number of areas where we can and 
where we do agree. 
So there are ways in which this place 
is portrayed in the entertainment 
media and in the news media that are 
accurate, insofar as they show this 
sometimes heated debate that occurs 
across party lines. There is some of 
that that occurs. It is an incomplete 
picture because there are a lot of areas 
where we agree, where we reach conclu-
sions that are good, and we reach them 
together. 
There is another feature of that, 
though, that is very seldom portrayed 
in the news media, in the entertain-
ment media, or elsewhere in our soci-
ety and in our culture, and it worries 
me. And that is about the areas where 
there is bipartisanship—a bipartisan-
ship that maybe is good for people in 
this Chamber, but leaves a lot of people 
out in the cold. It is good for politi-
cians whether they have an R or a D 
after their name, but it is bad for ev-
eryone else, especially the poor and 
middle class. That part concerns me. It 
worries me a lot. You know, we didn’t 
get to this point, going into the pan-
demic at the peak of an economic 
cycle, where we were spending a tril-
lion dollars a year more than we were 
taking in—we didn’t get to that point 
without a lot of bipartisanship. 
We didn’t get to the point of trillion- 
dollar annual deficits without a whole 
lot of Republicans and a whole lot of 
Democrats agreeing together to spend 
a trillion dollars more each year than 
we were taking in with record-low un-
employment, with strong economic 
growth. We were still borrowing that 
much. Twenty-five percent—$1 out of 
every $4 spent by the government—was 
borrowed. There is a lot of bipartisan-
ship in that, but not all bipartisanship 
is equal and not all bipartisanship is 
good for hard-working poor and middle- 
class Americans. Some of it is down-
right harmful. 
We didn’t get to the point where we 
spent last year more than double what 
we brought in. We brought in $3 tril-
lion, miraculously, during the height of 
the pandemic, and yet we spent $6.6 
trillion last year. We didn’t get to that 
point without a whole lot of bipartisan-
ship and without a whole lot of Repub-
licans agreeing with a whole lot of 
Democrats to spend that much more 
than we had. 
We didn’t get to be almost $30 trillion 
in debt without a whole lot of biparti-
sanship. That was a whole lot of Re-
publicans and a whole lot of Democrats

agreeing to do something that might 
have felt good in the moment—might 
have done a lot of good in the mo-
ment—but didn’t take into account the 
forgotten 
man 
and 
the 
forgotten 
woman in the picture. The poor and 
middle-class family that finds it harder 
to get by, to buy everything from hous-
ing to healthcare, from gas to gro-
ceries, it didn’t take them into ac-
count. So, no, not all bipartisanship 
makes sense. Not all bipartisanship has 
the best interests of the American peo-
ple at heart. 
Sometimes you need someone in the 
room to express hesitation, to express 
reluctance. Sometimes it is one or two, 
and sometimes it is half. That is why I 
was elated. I was pleased when a few 
months ago nearly every Member of 
the Senate Republican conference, 46 
out of the 50 of us, signed a letter. 
Now, the letter explained a few 
things, a few things that I think are 
pretty important to remember. It ex-
plained, for example, that we don’t 
ever want to see the Federal Govern-
ment default on its debt, pointing out 
that not raising the debt limit is a dif-
ferent decision than a decision to de-
fault on the debt. We bring in more 
than enough money every month and 
every year to meet the debt service ob-
ligations of every month and every 
year—a significant amount more, in 
fact. 
Sometimes 
changing 
the 
prioritization of spending can allow us 
to borrow less than we would other-
wise. So nearly every Member of the 
Republican Senate conference signed 
this letter acknowledging that we 
don’t want to default. And we do find 
ourselves in an untenable position in 
which Democrats are wanting to pass a 
$3.5 trillion bill that really, according 
to the nonpartisan Committee for a Re-
sponsible Federal Budget, would end up 
costing more like $5 trillion. And we 
don’t think it is right in that cir-
cumstance to just suspend the debt 
ceiling and that we are not going to do 
it. 
So we signed this letter. We said, we, 
the undersigned Republican Senators 
are letting Senate Democrats know 
and the American public know that we 
will not vote to increase the debt ceil-
ing, whether that comes through a 
stand-alone bill, a continuing resolu-
tion, or any other vehicle. This is a 
problem created by Democratic spend-
ing, and Democrats will have to accept 
sole responsibility for facilitating. 
I want to be clear. It is not saying 
that the underlying problem was cre-
ated entirely by Democrats. But it is 
saying that what the Democrats were 
about to do and are still planning to do 
is the driving reason why we are un-
willing to just suspend the debt ceiling. 
Remember, when we are suspending it, 
we are not just raising it by a certain 
amount. We are creating a period of 
debt ceiling Mardi Gras, a period in 
which any amount of additional bor-
rowing is allowed under the law. And 
when you have got one party that 
wants to add to the tune of many tril-
lions of dollars to our already out-of- 
control debt, one that is now in the 
range of about 125 percent of our GDP, 
that is a problem. It was not unreason-
able for us to make that commitment. 
It would have been unreasonable for us 
not to make that commitment. Some-
times you need someone who is willing 
to say: Maybe this isn’t such a good 
idea. 
I commend those who signed the let-
ter. I implore all who signed it to re-
member that commitment, to remem-
ber it to their voters. I don’t think it 
helps for us to just suspend the debt 
ceiling anyway, and I don’t think it 
helps to dismiss this simply as a clo-
ture vote. 
The point of the letter was that the 
Democrats have the ability to do this 
on their own through the reconcili-
ation process. If they want to do it, 
they should use that process. They 
haven’t used that process. In light of 
that, we have no business facilitating 
it. 
I see we have an additional colleague 
here who is interested in speaking. In 
deference to him, I am going to let him 
proceed. 
Before I do so, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a copy of 
that letter, dated August 10, 2021, 
signed by 46 Republican Senators. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, August 10, 2021. 
TO OUR FELLOW AMERICANS: Since taking 
total control of the United States federal 
government, with the Presidency, a narrow 
majority in the House, and Vice President 
Harris providing the deciding vote in an 
evenly split Senate, Democrats have em-
barked on a massive and unprecedented def-
icit spending spree. Without a single Repub-
lican vote, they passed a $1.9 trillion ‘‘Covid 
relief’’ bill in March even though $1 trillion 
was still unspent from previous bipartisan 
Covid relief bills. 
Now they have passed a $3.5 trillion Budget 
Resolution, again without a single Repub-
lican vote. The non-partisan Committee for a 
Responsible Federal Budget has calculated 
that a more honest score of this budget reso-
lution will likely exceed $5 trillion. Senate 
Democrats shamelessly estimate their tax 
and spending plan will result in a $45 trillion 
debt level by 2031. 
In order for this spending to occur, our na-
tion’s debt limit will have to be increased 
significantly. Because Democrats are respon-
sible for the spending, they need to take re-
sponsibility for increasing the debt ceiling. 
They have total control of the government, 
and the unilateral ability to raise the debt 
ceiling to accommodate their unilateral 
spending plans. Indeed, Democrats have the 
ability to raise the debt limit through the 
Budget Resolution by introducing appro-
priate language in the upcoming reconcili-
ation process (or a subsequent reconcili-
ation). Doing so would not require a single 
Republican vote, and would appropriately re-
quire each and every Democrat to take re-
sponsibility for their out-of-control spend-
ing. 
We should not default on our debts under 
any circumstances. If Democrats threaten a 
default, it will only be because they refuse to 
vote for the debt ceiling increase neces-
sitated by their own irresponsible spending. 
Democrats, at any time, have the power 
through reconciliation to unilaterally raise 
the debt ceiling, and they should not be al-
lowed to pretend otherwise. 
We, the undersigned Republican Senators, 
are letting Senate Democrats and the Amer-
ican public know that we will not vote to in-
crease the debt ceiling, whether that in-
crease comes through a stand-alone bill, a 
continuing resolution, or any other vehicle. 
This is a problem created by Democrat 
spending. Democrats will have to accept sole 
responsibility for facilitating it.

Mr. LEE. Thank you. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, first of 
all, I want to thank the Senator from 
Utah for his courtesy. 
Thank you, Senator LEE. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2196 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Ameri-
cans across the country, people around 
the world, and myself believe that in 
this room, they know that President 
Biden is failing at our southern border. 
That is not a secret. We have had 
months of record-shattering numbers 
of illegal immigrants crossing our 
southern border. 
We have had unfathomable amounts 
of illegal drugs produced by Mexican 
cartels—meth, fentanyl, heroin—com-
ing into our country. It is making its 
way across that southern border and 
into States like my home State of 
Montana. 
Many of you have probably heard me 
say that Montana is a northern border 
State with a southern border crisis. 
Well, that is true. The crisis at our 
southern border, created by President 
Biden, is out of control, and we all 
know we must do something to change 
the status quo to protect our families 
and our communities. 
But what I am here to talk about 
today is how President Biden is also 
failing at our northern border—the bor-
der between the United States and Can-
ada. While our southern border remains 
wide open to illegal drugs, illegal im-
migrants—many 
potentially 
COVID- 
positive or unvaccinated—our northern 
border remains closed because of Presi-
dent Biden. 
The hypocrisy here is stunning. It is 
infuriating. It is unexplainable. There 
is no reason or rationale behind Presi-
dent Biden’s decision. It can’t be be-
cause of COVID–19 or because of vac-
cination rates. Canadians are over 80

percent vaccinated—80 percent. Hai-
tians, on the other hand, coming across 
the southern border, have less than a 1- 
percent COVID vaccination rate. So if 
COVID–19 and the vaccination rates 
were the issue, then why did President 
Trudeau lift his restrictions and start 
allowing Americans to travel to Can-
ada on August 9? It makes no sense. 
President Biden is prohibiting Cana-
dians from traveling into the United 
States. They can’t come into Montana. 
Who is paying the price for President 
Biden’s hypocrisy? Montanans are pay-
ing the price. Montana families and 
Montana businesses are paying the 
price. Montana border communities 
and 
northern 
border 
communities 
across the country are paying the 
price. President Biden’s inexplicable 
policies are hurting Montana’s econ-
omy, destroying jobs, shuttering busi-
nesses, and hurting our families. 
In fact, let me give you an example. 
Great Falls, MT, which proudly calls 
Malmstrom Air Force Base its home, 
reported that they have seen a 20- to 
25-percent decrease in revenue due to 
the continued border closure. This is, 
sadly, the story we are hearing from 
many communities and business own-
ers across Montana as Canadians are 
no longer able to come visit our beau-
tiful State. 
This has been going on for far too 
long. Since the President will not do 
the right thing, to use some good old- 
fashioned Montana commonsense to 
listen to Montanans and open our 
northern border, I have introduced a 
bill to do just that. 
And, by the way, I have seen some of 
my colleagues across the aisle join me 
in calling on this administration to re-
open the northern border, and I am 
grateful for that, but actions speak 
louder than words. 
Today, we have the opportunity to 
stop putting the power in the hands of 
President Biden to make the right de-
cision here—he hasn’t made it—be-
cause we know that won’t happen. 
Today, we can pass my bill, called the 
Restoring the Northern Border Travel 
Act, and require the Biden administra-
tion to reopen the northern border. 
Let’s help revitalize Montana. How 
about 
the 
other 
northern 
border 
States? Let’s put an end to this irra-
tional closure and this hypocrisy. A 
wide open southern border and a closed 
northern border, it doesn’t make any 
sense. 
So I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to join me in passing my 
bill. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 2196 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I appreciate my 
colleague from Montana’s efforts to get 
the northern border travel back to nor-
mal. I understand that this is an im-
portant issue in Montana, and it is im-
portant to families along our northern 
border, not only Montana but across 
our Nation. 
I just want to flag a couple of things, 
if I can. This legislation has not been 
considered just yet in the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee on which I serve and for-
merly chaired. Given the importance of 
this issue, I will be more than happy to 
work with my colleague from Montana 
on a path forward from this time. 
I am concerned, having said that, 
that this legislation, as is, is a bit too 
broad and could have unintended con-
sequences, including making it harder 
to address future challenges at our bor-
ders. Having said that, fortunately, the 
Biden administration is already taking 
action to safely and responsibly reopen 
our border, including the recent an-
nouncement to expand the eligibility 
of travelers to enter the U.S. via air 
travel that will go into effect—I be-
lieve it is next month. 
Again, I appreciate my colleague’s ef-
forts here and am ready to work with 
him, as I said to him just a few min-
utes ago, more than willing to work 
with him on this bill within the Home-
land Security Committee where I serve 
as a senior Democrat, and we can look 
at changes to refine the legislation and 
help build bipartisan support for it. 
Unfortunately, however, tonight I 
have to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I am 
grateful for the support the Senator 
from Delaware has offered here. The 
reason I am down here asking for the 
unanimous consent this evening is to 
provide a sense of urgency to try to get 
this done now. 
President Trudeau opened up the Ca-
nadian border on August 9, and Presi-
dent Biden has kept the border shut 
down to Canadians coming in during 
that entire time. It doesn’t make 
sense. COVID is a concern. We agree on 
that. However, it should not be a con-
cern at the U.S.-Canadian border, with 
Canadians having an 80-percent vac-
cination rate. 
Canada 
began 
letting 
fully 
vac-
cinated Americans cross the border 2 
months ago. Canada has a higher vac-
cination rate than the United States. I 
find it a bit hypocritical to talk about 
the concern about vaccination rates 
and relating that to the northern bor-
der and, at the same time, the southern 
border is wide open with vaccination 
rates, for example, of Haitians of less 
than 1 percent. 
So anyway, we want to get this re-
solved. We are seeing businesses and 
families 
suffer 
in 
northern 
border 
States. This administration continues 
to have a wide open southern border 
policy while keeping the northern bor-
der closed. Montana can’t figure that 
one out. Many of us who live in north-
ern border States see the same thing. 
The hypocrisy has to end. The travel at 
the U.S.-Canadian border needs to be 
restored immediately. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to yield back the 
remaining time on both sides.

objection, it is so ordered.

NOT VOTING—1 
Burr 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). On this vote, the yeas are 61, the 
nays are 38. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn having voted in the af-
firmative, the motion is agreed to. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
few moments, the Senate will pass an 
extension of the debt limit through 
early December, avoiding a first-ever, 
Republican-manufactured default on 
the national debt. 
On Monday morning, I said we needed 
to pass a bill to address the debt limit 
by the end of the week, and that is ex-
actly what we did. 
Republicans played a dangerous and 
risky partisan game, and I am glad 
that their brinksmanship did not work. 
For the good of America’s families, for 
the good of our economy, Republicans 
must recognize in the future that they 
should approach fixing the debt limit 
in a bipartisan way. 
What is needed now is a long-term so-
lution so we don’t go through this 
risky drama every few months, and we 
hope Republicans will join in enacting 
a long-term solution to the debt limit 
in December. We are ready to work 
with them. 
Leader MCCONNELL and Senate Re-
publicans insisted they wanted a solu-
tion to the debt ceiling, but said Demo-
crats must raise it alone by going 
through a drawn-out, convoluted, and 
risky reconciliation process. That was 
simply unacceptable to my caucus, 
and, yesterday, Senate Republicans fi-
nally realized that their obstruction 
was not going to work. 
I thank very much my Democratic 
colleagues for our showing our unity in 
solving this Republican-manufactured 
crisis. 
Despite 
immense 
opposition 
from Leader MCCONNELL and the Mem-
bers of his conference, our caucus held 
together and we pulled our country 
back from the cliff’s edge that Repub-
licans tried to push us over. 
This is a temporary but necessary 
and important fix. I appreciate that, at 
the end of the day, we were able to 
raise the debt limit without a con-
voluted and unnecessary reconciliation 
process that, until today, the Repub-
lican leader claimed was the only way 
to address the debt limit. 
Let me say that again. Today’s vote 
is proof positive that the debt limit can 
be addressed without going through the 
reconciliation process, just as Demo-
crats have been saying for months. 
The solution is for Republicans to ei-
ther join us in raising the debt limit or 
stay out of the way and let Democrats 
address the debt limit ourselves. Those 
are the two choices, and it is very sim-
ple. 
Senate Democrats want a long-term 
solution to the debt limit to make sure 
financial markets remain stable and 
our economic recovery stays on track. 
America’s full faith and credit must 
never be used as a political bargaining 
chip. I hope my Republican colleagues 
relent from trying to make it one when 
we revisit this issue soon. 
So now that Republican brinkman-
ship has relented, Senate Democrats 
will focus on passing the Build Back 
Better agenda so we can finally build 
up ladders of opportunity for people to 
climb up to the middle class, to help 
people already in the middle class stay 
there, to fight climate change, and cre-
ate the good-paying jobs of tomorrow 
and rekindle that sunny American op-
timism that has long been the course 
of our national identity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture 
having been invoked, the motion to 
refer and the amendments pending 
thereto fall. 
AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN

ment No. 3848 is withdrawn and all

TEXAS ABORTION BAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
night, a Federal judge in Texas did 
what the U.S. Supreme Court should 
have done. He issued an injunction 
blocking Texas’ clearly unconstitu-
tional bounty hunter abortion ban 
from being enforced while challenges 
to the law make their way through the 
courts. The ruling by U.S. District 
Judge Robert Pitman came in response 
to a challenge of the Texas ban brought 
by the Federal Department of Justice. 
The Texas abortion law, known as 
S.B. 8, is the most restrictive abortion 
law in the Nation and the most serious 
challenge to Roe v. Wade in 50 years. It 
was deliberately crafted to outlaw 
most abortions while allowing State 
lawmakers to evade judicial review. It 
deputizes private citizens to enforce 
the ban by suing anyone who ‘‘aids and 
abets’’ a woman seeking an abortion. 
And it offers rewards of $10,000 or more 
to plaintiffs who bring suits. 
In his ruling, Judge Pitman wrote 
that Texas politicians had ‘‘contrived 
an unprecedented and transparent stat-
utory scheme’’ that has ‘‘unlawfully 
prevented [women in Texas] from exer-
cising control over their lives in ways 
that are protected by the Constitu-
tion.’’ 
The Supreme Court order allowing 
the Texas law to take effect was a 
product of the Court’s ‘‘shadow dock-
et’’ of cases that are decided without 
full briefing or oral arguments—and 
without 
transparency 
or 
account-
ability. 
The 5–4 order, from the Court’s con-
servative majority, was criticized by 
some of the Court’s own members, in-
cluding Chief Justice John Roberts, 
who warned that Texas lawmakers had 
created a ‘‘model for action,’’ that 
other States could copy to undermine 
constitutionally protected rights. 
The Chief Justice was right. Since 
the Court’s ruling on S.B. 8, elected of-
ficials and political candidates in a 
number of States have vowed to intro-
duce similar abortion bans. 
With Judge Pitman’s wise ruling last 
night, that rush to use citizen bounty 
hunters to avoid legal accountability 
while denying the constitutional rights 
of women and perhaps others is on 
hold—at least for now. But the threat 
to constitutional rights remains. Texas 
has already filed a notice of appeal in 
the conservative Fifth Circuit. 
Abortion providers remain at risk of 
facing bounty hunter lawsuits if they 
perform abortions prohibited by the 
ban while the injunction is in place. 
Anti-choice organizations have vowed 
to be ‘‘vigilant’’ in suing individuals 
retroactively if the order is reversed. 
I hope that justice—and the Con-
stitution—will prevail in the coming 
days as this litigation continues. The 
fundamental rights of millions of Tex-
ans are at stake. 
f 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today in recognition of Hispanic 
Heritage Month to celebrate our His-
panic and Latino communities and 
their immeasurable contributions to 
our Nation. Hispanic and Latinos have 
been with our country since its very 
founding and have helped make Amer-
ica exceptional. Hispanic and Latino 
Americans play vital roles in our com-
munities. They are our teachers, our 
heathcare heroes, our entrepreneurs, 
our essential workers, our public serv-
ants and elected officials, all vital to 
the fabric of our Nation. 
Hispanic Heritage Month started as a 
commemorative week that Congress 
established in 1968 and expanded to a 
full month in 1988 to recognize the crit-
ical role the Latino community has 
played in the civil rights movement. 
Celebrations start September 15, a sig-
nificant date, as it is the independence 
date for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Gua-
temala, and Nicaragua, while Mexico 
celebrates its independence on Sep-
tember 16, and Chile celebrates its 
independence on September 18. 
This month, we celebrate the nearly 
61 million Latino Americans across the 
country and the more than 600,000 His-
panic or Latino residents in Maryland. 
Maryland is proudly one of the most di-
verse States in the Nation. We are 
home to people with origins in Central 
and South America, with sizeable popu-
lations of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, 
Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans. 
America is a nation of immigrants; 
people from far and wide have settled 
in the United States, the land of oppor-
tunity. Since the Immigration Act of 
1965, millions of individuals from Cen-
tral and South America have immi-
grated to the United States for numer-
ous reasons, including economic insta-
bility or violence in their native coun-
try. 
We take this month to highlight the 
importance of the Hispanic and Latino 
communities, including the election in 
1822 of Joseph Marion Hernandez, the 
first Hispanic in Congress, as Florida’s 
Delegate. Today, according to the Con-
gressional Research Service, there are 
54 Hispanic or Latino Members—a 
record 
number—serving: 
47 
in 
the 
House, including two Delegates and the 
Resident Commissioner, and seven in 
the Senate. 
Though the Hispanic and Latino 
communities have been essential to 
America’s identity, from the scientific 
innovation to art, culture, music, food, 
and so much more, we must still recog-
nize the disparities that these commu-
nities face. For the second year, we are 
celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
pandemic has affected people of color 
at disproportionate rates in terms of 
economic distress and case severity. 
The Hispanic or Latino unemployment 
rate soared to 18.9 percent in February 
of 2020. Hispanic or Latina women took 
even larger losses compared to their 
male counterparts. The unemployment 
disparity is due to the overrepresenta-
tion of Hispanic or Latino workers in 
the food preparation or serving indus-
try, as well as building and grounds 
cleaning and maintenance. These sec-
tors suffered some of the harshest eco-
nomic effects of the pandemic. Even 
though the unemployment rate has de-
creased to 6.4 percent in Hispanic and 
Latino communities—6.2 percent in 
Maryland—they still have not experi-
enced the same economic recoveries as 
their White counterparts. 
For the immigrants who do not have 
a green card, their likelihood to have 
lost a job is even higher. Many say that 
at least one family member in their 
household has lost a job or wages. 
Families are suffering; they are wor-
ried about putting food on the table or 
even losing their homes. The financial 
toll of the last year and a half has ex-
acerbated the prepandemic inequalities 
that the Hispanic or Latino commu-
nities were already facing. 
Hispanic or Latino people are also 
more likely face the harshest health ef-
fects of the COVID–19 pandemic. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol 
and 
Prevention, 
Hispanic 
or 
Latino people are twice as likely to 
catch COVID, 2.8 times more likely to 
be hospitalized, and 2.3 times more 
likely to die compared to their White 
counterparts. In my own home State, 
Hispanic or Latino people are 14.3 per-
cent of the case rates when they only 
make up 10.6 percent of our population. 
With the widening gaps of healthcare 
coverage, Hispanic or Latino families 
face large hospital bills for their bouts 
of COVID. Twenty percent of non-
elderly Hispanic or Latino people are

uninsured. Although the Affordable 
Care Act and President Biden’s expan-
sion of the Affordable Care Act have 
helped many receive healthcare cov-
erage, people of color remain less like-
ly to have healthcare coverage. 
It is our duty in Congress to ensure 
that our Hispanic and Latino commu-
nities have the resources and access to 
healthcare they need so we can close 
the gap between them and their White 
counterparts. This comes with edu-
cating these communities on how to 
sign up and receive healthcare. It also 
comes with comprehensive immigra-
tion reform to provide an easier path-
way to citizenship so people can come 
out of the shadows. 
Regardless of the repercussions of the 
pandemic, Hispanic and Latino Ameri-
cans remain optimistic, filled with love 
and pride for their families, commu-
nities, and the United States of Amer-
ica. I want to take this opportunity to 
thank Hispanic and Latino Americans 
for their contributions that have made 
the United States the country it is 
today. I want to thank the hard-work-
ing 
Hispanic 
and 
Latino 
essential 
workers who have put their lives at 
risk to keep our country running dur-
ing the pandemic. I want to thank the 
Hispanic and Latino communities who 
love our Nation and strive to change it 
for the better. Thank you for being an 
important part of the American story.

REMEMBERING AMBASSADOR 
GEORGE S. VEST, III 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
would like to bring to the attention of 
colleagues the recent passing of long- 
time U.S. diplomat George Southall 
Vest, III, a long-time resident of Be-
thesda, MD. He was 102 years old. His 
career with the State Department 
spanned the Cold War era, from 1947 to 
1989. As chairman of the U.S. Helsinki 
Commission, I want to draw particular 
attention to Ambassador Vest’s rep-
resentation of the United States at the 
initial multilateral discussions of 35 
countries that led to an historic sum-
mit in Helsinki, Finland, from July 30 
to August 1, 1975, where the Helsinki 
Final Act was signed. 
An all-European summit was not a 
priority for the United States in the 
early 1970s. Indeed, it was a long-stand-
ing Soviet proposal, and Washington 
was wary of its use to confirm the divi-
sion of Europe, give added legitimacy 
to communist regimes in Eastern Eu-
rope, and provide an opportunity for 
Moscow to divide the United States 
from its European allies. Washington 
agreed to engage but saw little value in 
the effort. As Ambassador Vest himself 
was quoted as saying, ‘‘This was the 
first time after World War II where all 
the Eastern European countries, all the 
Western European countries, together 
with Canada and the United States, sat 
down to talk about security and co-
operation . . . I had very, very few in-
structions. I was left pretty much to 
feel my own way.’’ 
The early work of Ambassador Vest 
and his team and that of his immediate 
successors led to the Helsinki Final 
Act, which included 10 principles guid-
ing relations between states that serve 
as a basis, to this day, of our response 
to events in Europe, including Russia’s 
aggression against Ukraine and other 
neighbors. The Final Act provided a 
comprehensive definition of security 
that includes respect for human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, the basis 
for us to address today’s brutal crack-
down 
on 
dissent 
in 
Belarus 
and 
authoritarianism elsewhere. It also 
provided for a follow-up to the Final 
Act with regular reviews of implemen-
tation and development of new norms, 
a multilateral effort now represented 
by today’s 57-country Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
with its important institutions and 
field missions. 
Ambassador Vest, left pretty much 
to feel his own way, may not have in-
tended to make such an impact on Eu-
ropean security. Keep in mind that he 
represented the United States in these 
negotiations during the tumultuous 
time of U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, 
an oil crisis on the horizon, the grow-
ing Watergate scandal at home, and a 
rising Soviet threat across the globe. 
Nevertheless, his initial efforts con-
tributed to an end of the Cold War divi-
sion of Europe rather than a confirma-
tion of it. That is quite a turnaround. 
I should add that the Congress later 
played a major role in shaping the U.S. 
contribution to this result when it cre-
ated the Helsinki Commission in 1976. 
While things have changed since then, 
the Commission does now what it did 
in the late 1970s: ensure that human 
rights considerations are central to 
U.S. foreign policy and U.S. relations 
with other countries. 
Given the challenges we face today, I 
hope it is useful to remind my col-
leagues of Ambassador Vest’s legacy as 
a diplomat. Both before and after the 
negotiations, he served in positions in 
which he worked to strengthen ties 
with Europe, including through the 
NATO alliance and dialogue with a 
growing European Union. He was also a 
mentor to new generations of Amer-
ican diplomats. All of this followed his 
combat service as a forward artillery 
observer in Europe during World War 
II. 
George Vest joined the Foreign Serv-
ice in 1947, after using the G.I. Bill to 
earn his master’s degree in history 
from the University of Virginia, where 
he had received his B.A. in 1941. He 
served as Assistant Secretary of State 
for European Affairs under President 
Carter and as U.S. Ambassador to the 
European Union from 1981 to 1985. His 
last assignment at the State Depart-
ment was as Director General of the 
Foreign Service. He retired in 1989 as a 
‘‘career ambassador,’’ a rank requiring 
a Presidential nomination and Senate 
confirmation. 
George Vest’s father was an Epis-
copal priest and Vest graduated from 
the Episcopal High School in Alexan-
dria, VA, before attending U-Va. He 
was as dedicated to his church as he 
was to our Nation. He served on the 
vestry at St. Albans Episcopal Church 
and volunteered in its Opportunity 
(thrift) Shop, both located on the Close 
of Washington National Cathedral. He 
also tutored students in DC public 
schools. Two sons, George S. Vest, IV 
of Fairfax, VA, and Henry Vest of 
Broomfield, 
CO, 
and 
two 
grand-
daughters survive him. I send my con-
dolences to his family and thank them 
for his life of service. Let us be inspired 
by Ambassador George Vest and plant 
our own seeds for a better world tomor-
row.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
DEPARTMENT 
OF MAINE, VETERANS OF FOR-
EIGN WARS CENTENNIAL ANNI-
VERSARY 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise 
today in recognition of the 100th anni-
versary of the Department of Maine, 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, Maine VFW. 
Maine VFW was founded in 1921 as a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to 
serving U.S. veterans of overseas con-
flicts, advocating for all veterans, their 
families, and their communities, and 
recognizing the sacrifices America’s 
servicemen and women have made for 
this great country. Maine VFW, along-
side its sister chapters across the 
United States, represents the oldest 
war veterans’ organization in America. 
Every year for the last century, it has 
made a positive and tangible impact 
for Maine veterans. Maine VFW de-
serves not only our admiration, but 
also our gratitude. 
Since its founding, Maine VFW has 
secured an array of remarkable vic-
tories for its membership and the many 
communities it serves. Through the 
Veterans Affairs office at Togus, Maine 
VFW helps recoup more than $5 million 
in earned benefits every year. Maine 
VFW also advocates for veterans and 
their families at the State and Na-
tional level and has helped shape na-
tional security and veterans’ policy for 
generations of Americans. In 2020, for 
example, Maine VFW helped expand 
the VA’s list of conditions for which 
there is a presumptive service connec-
tion for veterans exposed to Agent Or-
ange and has made important strides 
to support veterans exposed to toxic 
chemicals in the first Gulf War and the 
Global War on Terror. Additionally, 
Maine VFW has worked tirelessly to 
improve mental healthcare for Amer-
ican veterans and successfully advo-
cated for the John Scott Hannon Vet-
erans Mental Health Care Improvement 
Act, landmark legislation to increase 
the VA’s mental health workforce and 
strengthen rural veterans’ access to 
care, which was signed into law last 
year. Pursuant to its commitment to 
patriotic service, stewardship, and edu-
cation, Maine VFW also spearheads a 
variety of community advocacy initia-
tives, food and blood drives, and Home-
less Veterans Stand Downs to respond

to the needs of Maine’s most vulner-
able populations. 
On the national level, Veterans of 
Foreign Wars and each of its State 
chapters have played a central role in 
the passage of nearly every important 
piece of veterans’ legislation over the 
last 100 years, including the GI bills 
that have helped millions of veterans 
pursue education and training opportu-
nities since 1944. VFW champions sev-
eral major youth education and schol-
arship programs, such as Voice of De-
mocracy, a competitive audio-essay 
scholarship that awards nearly $2 mil-
lion annually to students in grades 9– 
12. VFW and Auxiliary members par-
ticipate in thousands of community 
service initiatives and major philan-
thropic campaigns each year. VFW also 
performs important work abroad, advo-
cating for prisoners of war and service-
members who remain missing in ac-
tion. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, 
America’s veterans have put them-
selves in harm’s way overseas so that 
we may enjoy freedom at home. A tes-
tament to Maine’s dedication to this 
cause is the number of veterans per 
capita in our State, which consistently 
ranks as one of the highest in the Na-
tion. Day in and day out, the Maine 
VFW works to support these veterans 
and their communities and has done so 
for a century. On behalf of a grateful 
nation, I would like to honor and 
thank the Maine VFW for these 100 
years of service. Its steadfast support 
for servicemembers, veterans, and their 
families continues to change the lives 
of Americans at home and abroad.

passion for innovation and engineering 
led him to the University of Louisville, 
where he earned a bachelor of science 
in industrial engineering. John then 
enrolled at the University of Louisville 
School of Medicine to pursue his child-
hood dream. Like many students, John 
relied on coffee, energy drinks, and 
soda for a caffeine boost. One night, 
during a late-night study session, John 
thought, Why not just put caffeine in 
water? Over the next 2 years, he 
worked with his mentor, Tom O’Grady, 
to turn that idea into a business. They 
spent most of 2016 developing their 
brand and fine-tuning the Phocus for-
mula, launching their product in 2017. 
After graduating from medical school 
in 2018, John deferred his residency in 
ophthalmology to continue building his 
company. 
Today, Phocus is a thriving small 
business providing consumers nation-
wide a healthy alternative to the tradi-
tional energy drink. Headquartered in 
Louisville, Phocus recently celebrated 
its fourth anniversary. To date, Phocus 
has developed 11 flavors of sparkling 
and regular water infused with caffeine 
extracted from green tea, electrolytes, 
and the amino acid L-theanine. Unlike 
traditional energy drinks, Phocus bev-
erages have zero calories and are free 
of sweeteners, sodium, and additives. 
Phocus beverages are available at sev-
eral regional and national retailers and 
are featured in over 200 corporate of-
fices across America. In 2020, Phocus 
Cola was named the Best New Product 
at BevNET’s Best of 2020 Awards. 
Like many small business owners, 
John and Tom are actively involved in 
their community. Locally, Phocus reg-
ularly supports community organiza-
tions, including the Louisville City 
Football Club’s youth soccer clinics 
and the American Junior Golf Associa-
tion’s Justin Thomas Junior Cham-
pionship. During the holiday season, 
Phocus has teamed up with ESPN Lou-
isville for its ‘‘Cram the Van’’ toy and 
clothing drive for children in need. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
company 
donated 
200,000 
cans 
of 
Phocus to 472 hospitals and healthcare 
facilities across 40 States. In May of 
2021, their ‘‘Buy One. Gift One. A Case 
for Teachers.’’ program donated cases 
of Phocus to teachers nationwide in 
recognition of Teacher Appreciation 
Month. Phocus’s community involve-
ment, success, and products have been 
profiled in local and national outlets, 
including WDRB, WAVE3, Louisville 
Courier-Journal, 
Louisville 
Business 
Journal, MarketWatch, Fox News, and 
CNBC. 
Clear Cut Phocus, LLC is a remark-
able example of the resilience and 
adaptability of locally owned small 
businesses. 
Small 
businesses, 
like 
Phocus, form the heart of towns across 
Kentucky and play a critical role in 
Kentucky’s beverage industry. Con-
gratulations to John, Tom, and the en-
tire team at Phocus. I wish them the 
best of luck, and I look forward to 
watching their continued growth and 
success in Kentucky, and beyond.

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Ms. HIRONO, Mr. BOOKER, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. SANDERS, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. MARKEY, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, 
and Ms. BALDWIN): 
S. 2954. A bill to amend the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act to alter the 
definition of ‘‘conviction’’, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Fair Adjudications for 
Immigrants Act. This legislation would 
ensure that immigrants with criminal 
convictions do not face barriers to nat-
uralization and experience unfair re-
movals after their convictions have 
been dismissed, expunged, or pardoned 
by a Federal or State locality. 
What the bill would do. The Fair Ad-
judications for Immigrants Act is im-
portant in ensuring immigrants are not 
unjustly 
treated 
after 
receiving 
a 
criminal charge that never resulted in 
a conviction or after a previous convic-
tion no longer stands. 
Specifically, this bill would ensure 
that immigrants whose convictions 
have been overturned are not penalized 
when they are no longer considered 
valid in the court of conviction or for 
sentences that have been fully sus-
pended by the sentencing court. 
By redefining the term ‘‘conviction’’ 
in the Immigration and Nationality 
Act, this legislation also clarifies that 
any adjudication that is appealable or 
in which the court has issued a judicial 
recommendation against removal or 
probation without judgment will not 
count as a conviction. 
The bill would apply retroactively to 
any conviction, adjudication, or judge-
ment entered before, on, or after the 
enactment of this bill. Finally, it es-
tablishes that an immigrant cannot be 
removed on the basis of a conviction if 
the sentencing court issues a rec-
ommendation against removal to the 
Secretary of Homeland Security. 
Why the bill is needed. Under current 
law, rather than having access to many 
rehabilitative measures that are af-
forded in the criminal justice system, 
immigrants with dismissed criminal 
charges, suspended sentences, or crimi-
nal convictions that are no longer con-
sidered valid in the court of conviction 
still face severe consequences in the 
immigration court system. 
Some 
of 
the 
immigration 
con-
sequences that immigrants can face in-
clude unjust removals, mandatory de-
tention, and barriers to naturalization. 
It is imperative that we resolve this 
disparity between immigration and 
criminal law to prevent those immi-
grants with dismissed criminal charges 
or with convictions that are no longer 
considered valid in the court of convic-
tion from continuing to face punitive 
immigration consequences. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself and 
Ms. SMITH): 
S. 2959. A bill to provide that, due to 
disruptions caused by COVID–19, appli-
cations for impact aid funding for fis-
cal year 2023 may use certain data sub-
mitted in the fiscal year 2022 applica-
tion; to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions.

unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in

By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and 
Mr. WICKER): 
S. 2986. A bill to require a review of 
sanctions with respect to Russian 
kleptocrats and human rights abusers; 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to sound the alarm on the na-
tional security threat that corruption 
represents and to echo the determina-
tion made earlier this year by Presi-
dent Biden that corruption constitutes 
a core national security threat to the 
United States. 
Along with many colleagues in this 
body, I have worked long and hard to 
fight 
corruption—which 
undermines 
democracy, human rights, and the rule 
of law and is behind so many of the 
persistent problems that we seek to 
solve. 
The recently released Pandora Pa-
pers investigations—coordinated by the 
International Consortium of Investiga-
tive 
Journalists 
and involving 150 
media outlets, including The Wash-
ington Post and the Organized Crime 
and Corruption Reporting Project—re-
veal the astonishing extent to which 
questionable financial flows are enter-
ing our country and those of our allies. 
This warrants further review. Although 
we had known that such a system of 
offshore finance exists, it is still shock-
ing to see the scale of the corruption, 
documented in great detail by emails, 
contracts, and other documents. For-
eign dictators, their associates, and 
other foreign officials have stolen un-
told 
sums—billions 
of 
dollars—and 
moved that dirty money into our de-
mocracies, into real estate, bank ac-
counts, trusts, and other financial in-
struments. 
This is a profound threat to our na-
tional security. It hollows out the rule 
of law abroad and now it threatens to 
hollow out the rule of law at home. 
Foreign kleptocrats cannot do this 
alone. Although kleptocrats may steal 
abroad, to taint our political system 
with that money requires the assist-
ance of enablers—American lawyers, 
accountants, trust, and company serv-
ice providers, real estate professionals, 
and the like—who put aside any moral 
qualms they may have about working 
for the enemies of democracy to obtain 
a small slice of the illgotten gains. 
The Pandora Papers make clear that 
U.S. enablers apparently play an out-
sized role in helping to move stolen as-
sets from dictatorships and struggling 
democracies into consolidated democ-
racies—an appalling and corrupt trans-
ference of wealth from those who need 
it most to those who have no need at 
all. 
All told, the papers include docu-
ments from 206 U.S. trusts in 15 States 
and Washington, DC, and 22 trustee 
companies. While there is obviously 
much legitimate business to be done in 
creating and managing trusts and in-
vestments—and we should be careful 
about overstating or generalizing with-
out careful examination of each case— 
it appears that some Americans may 
have knowingly played a significant 
role in facilitating corruption. 
The papers include 300 politicians and 
public officials from more than 90 
countries and territories—though no 
Americans and exceedingly few West-
ern Europeans. This comes as no sur-
prise. The movement of corrupt money 
runs east to west, not west to east. It 
is the tragedy of the post-Cold War 
world that corruption has come west 
along with dirty money rather than de-
mocracy going east. There are names 
in the papers that also come as no sur-
prise—Putin cronies Konstantin Ernst 
and Gennady Timchenko are both 
named. Both are included on Alexey 
Navalny’s list of 35 human rights abus-
ers and kleptocrats. Timchenko is al-
ready under U.S. sanctions, though 
Ernst is not. Now would be a good time 
to consider sanctions on him. 
The Aliyevs of Azerbaijan also make 
an appearance. They collectively own a 
real estate empire in London worth 
$700 million. A Chinese Communist 
Party official also was found to have 
used an offshore company to trade in 
U.S. stocks. 
However, there is good news. It does 
not have to be this way. The triumph 
of global kleptocracy is not inevitable. 
We can fight back, and we are. Never 
before has there been an American ad-
ministration so focused on the coun-
tering corruption or a Congress so cre-
ative and aggressive in facing down the 
threat. President Biden is the first 
President ever to declare countering 
corruption to be a ‘‘core U.S. national 
security 
interest.’’ 
Congress 
has 
formed a Caucus against Foreign Cor-
ruption and Kleptocracy. The House re-
cently passed no fewer than six dif-
ferent counterkleptocracy measures in 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act, which included bills of mine. Now 
it is incumbent upon us in the Senate 
to do the same. 
First is the Combating Global Cor-
ruption Act that would create a public 
and tiered country-by-country report-
ing requirement on compliance with 
international 
anti-corruption 
norms 
and standards. Those countries in the 
lowest tier of this report would have 
their leadership evaluated for Global 
Magnitsky sanctions. 
Then there is the Global Magnitsky 
reauthorization that would reauthorize 
and enhance these critical sanctions 
for targeting global kleptocrats and 
human rights abusers—exactly the sort 
of people identified in the Pandora Pa-
pers. I am also proposing a new meas-
ure—and I am introducing it today— 
that would mandate the administra-
tion evaluate the ‘‘Navalny 35’’ for 
Global Magnitsky sanctions. Russian 
opposition 
leader 
Alexei 
Navalny’s 
Anti-Corruption Foundation, in a let-
ter addressed to President Joe Biden 
earlier this year, called for the United 
States to impose sanctions on dozens of 
Russian oligarchs and government offi-
cials, whom it credibly accuses of po-
litical 
persecution, 
human 
rights 
abuses, and corruption. I agree with 
the Navalny team and urge the admin-
istration to move forward on this. 
All three of these measures have been 
included in the House National Defense 
Authorization Act, and I urge my col-
leagues to include them in the Senate 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
The Pandora Papers are a wake-up 
call to all who care about the future of 
democracy. Thirty years after the end 
of the Cold War, it is time for democ-
racies to band together and demand an 
end to the unprecedented corruption 
that has come to be the defining fea-
ture of the global order. We must purge 
the dirty money from our systems and 
deny kleptocrats safe haven. 
It will take hard decisions and dif-
ficult reforms, but we can do it. We al-
ready have the bipartisan momentum. 
Now we only have to see it through.

thermal units and energy cost avoidance of 
more than $800,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas energy efficiency has enjoyed bi-
partisan support in Congress and in adminis-
trations of both parties for more than 40 
years; 
Whereas 
bipartisan 
legislation 
enacted 
since the 1970s to advance Federal energy ef-
ficiency policies includes— 
(1) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.); 
(2) the National Appliance Energy Con-
servation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100–12; 101

energy service companies, and technology 
firms), public-interest organizations, envi-
ronmental and conservation groups, and 
State and local governments; 
Whereas, since 1980, the United States has 
more than doubled its energy productivity, 
realizing twice the economic output per unit 
of energy consumed; 
Whereas more than 2,000,000 individuals in 
the United States are currently employed 
across the energy efficiency sector, as the 
United States has doubled its energy produc-
tivity, and business and industry have be-
come more innovative and competitive in 
global markets; 
Whereas the Office of Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy of the Department of 
Energy is the principal Federal agency re-
sponsible for renewable energy technologies 
and energy efficiency efforts; 
Whereas cutting energy waste saves the 
consumers of the United States billions of 
dollars on utility bills annually; and 
Whereas energy efficiency policies, financ-
ing innovations, and public-private partner-
ships have contributed to a reduction in en-
ergy intensity in Federal facilities by nearly 
50 percent since the mid-1970s, which results 
in direct savings to United States taxpayers: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 6, 2021, as ‘‘Energy

SULLIVAN, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina, Mr. TILLIS, 
Mr. WICKER, and Mr. MORAN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Armed 
Services: 
S. RES. 419 
Whereas, despite social stigmas and public 
opinion averse to women in uniform, women 
applied for military service in such numbers 
that enrollment ceilings were reached within 
the first several years; 
Whereas, President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
established the Women Accepted for Volun-
teer Emergency Service (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘WAVES’’) on July 30, 1942, 
when he signed the Navy Women’s Reserve 
Act (Public Law 77–538; 56 Stat. 730) into law; 
Whereas, while women had served in the 
enlisted ranks of the Navy in a variety of po-
sitions during World War I, legislation 
passed after World War I limited women to 
service as nurses until the creation of the 
WAVES; 
Whereas, during World War II, women in 
the United States were recruited into the 
Armed Forces to perform military assign-
ments so that men could be freed for combat 
duties; 
Whereas, under the direction of Lieutenant 
Commander (later Captain) Mildred Helen 
McAfee, the WAVES peaked in 1945 at nearly 
83,000 officers and enlisted personnel, or ap-
proximately 2.5 percent of the wartime 
strength of the Navy and was composed of 
women from urban and rural communities 
across many socioeconomic backgrounds; 
Whereas, the Secretary of the Navy’s An-
nual Report Fiscal Year 1945 stated that 
there were 8,475 officers and 74,497 enlisted 
WAVES serving in the spring of 1945; 
Whereas the WAVES worked at large and 
small naval commands from Florida to 
Washington and from California to Rhode Is-
land, as well as overseas; 
Whereas the WAVES numerous and diverse 
contributions ranged from yeoman, chauf-
feur, and baker to pharmacist, artist, air-
craft mechanic, and dental hygienist; 
Whereas during World War II, WAVES 
served as training instructors throughout 
the country for newly recruited WAVES as 
well as thousands of aspiring male naval avi-
ators, gunners, and navigators destined for 
combat units; 
Whereas the WAVES who served in naval 
aviation taught instrument flying, aircraft 
recognition, celestial navigation, aircraft 
gunnery, radio, radar, air combat informa-
tion, and air fighter administration but were 
not allowed to be pilots; 
Whereas the WAVES served the Navy in 
such numbers that, according to a Navy esti-
mate, enough men were freed for combat 
duty to crew the ships of 4 major task forces, 
each including a battleship, 2 large aircraft 
carriers, 2 heavy cruisers, 4 light cruisers, 
and 15 destroyers; 
Whereas, at the end of World War II, Sec-
retary of the Navy James Forrestal stated 
that members of the WAVES ‘‘have exceeded 
performance of men in certain types of work, 
and the Navy Department considers it to be 
very desirable that these important services 
rendered by women during the war should 
likewise be available in postwar years 
ahead’’; 
Whereas, by the end of World War II, more 
than 400,000 women had served the United 
States in military capacities, with every 
Navy aviator who entered combat having re-
ceived some part of his training from a 
WAVE; 
Whereas the WAVES, despite their merit 
and the recognized value and importance of 
their contributions to the war effort, were 
not given status equal to their male counter-
parts, and struggled for years to receive the 
appreciation of Congress and the people of 
the United States; 
Whereas the WAVES helped to catalyze the 
social, demographic, and economic evo-
lutions that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s 
and continue to this day; and 
Whereas the pioneering women who served 
in the WAVES are owed a great debt of grati-
tude for their service to the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the women who served the 
United States in the Navy Women Accepted 
for 
Voluntary 
Emergency 
Service 
(‘‘WAVES’’) during World War II; 
(2) commends the WAVES who, through a 
sense of duty and willingness to defy stereo-
types and social pressures, performed mili-
tary assignments to aid the war effort, with 
the result that men were freed for combat 
duties; and 
(3) recognizes that the WAVES, by serving 
with diligence and merit, not only opened up 
opportunities for women that had previously 
been reserved for men, but also contributed 
vitally to the victory of the United States 
and the Allies in World War II.
