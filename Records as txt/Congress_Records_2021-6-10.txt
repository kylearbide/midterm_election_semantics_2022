REMEMBERING ROBERT ALLEN 
KATZMANN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
late last night, a giant of the legal 
world, Judge Robert Katzmann, passed 
away at the age of 68. He was the 
former chief judge of the Second Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals in New York, one 
of the Nation’s foremost jurists, and a 
kind, humble, compassionate human 
being, who was deeply admired by ev-
eryone who knew him. 
The son of immigrants—his father 
was a refugee from Nazi Germany— 
Robert Katzmann was an amazing in-
tellect, attending our Nation’s top 
schools. He went on to work for his 
professor and eventual mentor, Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, whetting his chops 
in working on the confirmation of 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme 
Court. For the rest of his life, he was 
maybe the most important writer on 
the topic of legislative-judicial rela-
tions. 
Later in his life, even when he had 
attained one of the highest judgeships 
in the country, Judge Katzmann never 
lost his passion for helping those who 
were just starting their careers. He 
taught at NYU and Georgetown and 
ran 
an 
acclaimed 
civic 
education 
course even while he was the chief 
judge on the court of appeals. He also 
lectured widely for the cause of proper 
legal representation for the poor, espe-
cially the immigrant poor. 
It just so happens that yesterday 
morning, I was able to introduce a 
nominee to the Second Circuit, Judge 
Katzmann’s circuit, who dedicated her 
career to providing top-notch legal 
counsel to those who couldn’t afford it: 
Ms. Eunice Lee, a former Federal de-
fender. It is a fitting reminder that 
Judge Katzmann’s legacy lives on 
through the principles he advanced. 
We send our deepest condolences to 
his wife, his brothers and sister, and to 
the innumerable number of students 
and colleagues whom Judge Katzmann 
inspired over the course of his life. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, on the subject of our business 
here on the floor, the Senate has had a 
very productive week. 
We began the week by passing land-
mark, bipartisan legislation to super-
charge American innovation and lay

the groundwork for another century of 
American leadership on the world 
stage. It passed with nearly 70 votes— 
an overwhelming and rare display of bi-
partisan support. As I mentioned yes-
terday, we are going to work with 
Speaker PELOSI and the relevant com-
mittee chairs in the House to move 
this bill forward as quickly as possible. 
It is vital to our Nation’s future that 
the House and Senate must come to-
gether to send President Biden a bill 
that he can sign into law. 
The Senate also confirmed the first 
judicial 
appointments 
of 
President 
Biden’s 
tenure—two 
district 
court 
judges—and we will confirm a third 
today, the first Muslim American to 
serve as an article III judge in our his-
tory. On Monday, the Senate will con-
firm President Biden’s first circuit 
court nominee, the amazing Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson, and next week, 
this Chamber will take up additional, 
highly qualified nominees to the execu-
tive branch, including Lina Khan for 
the Federal Trade Commission and sev-
eral others. 
The Senate Democratic majority will 
move swiftly to perform our constitu-
tional duty to advise and consent on 
the President’s nominees. 
f 
RANSOMWARE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another matter, ransomware, over the 
past few months, there have been a 
number of high-profile cyber attacks 
against the U.S. Government, Amer-
ican businesses, and critical infrastruc-
ture. From the cyber winds attack last 
year to a ransomware attack on the 
city of Baltimore and the Colonial 
Pipeline, cyber crime is a real and 
growing threat. 
Just last week, the MTA, our vast 
subway system in New York, was the 
victim of an attack. 
While the Attorney General has an-
nounced an intensified effort to combat 
this scourge of ransomware attacks, we 
in Congress have a responsibility to 
conduct 
oversight 
and 
determine 
whether our government needs an addi-
tional authority and resource to take 
the fight to cyber criminals and foreign 
intelligence services. 
Congress must ensure that Federal 
Agencies, like the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency, have 
the necessary resources to take on this 
growing threat and support State and 
local governments under assault. So 
earlier this week, I called for Congress 
to increase CISA’S budget by $500 mil-
lion to fight this growing threat, and 
today I am asking Chairman PETERS— 
GARY PETERS of our Homeland Secu-
rity Committee—and the other rel-
evant committee chairs to begin a gov-
ernment-wide review of these attacks 
and determine what legislation may be 
needed to counter the threat of cyber 
crime and bring the fight to the cyber 
criminals. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
one final matter, I want my colleagues 
to be aware of the number ‘‘29 per-
cent.’’ That is the percentage of Repub-
lican voters who believe that President 
Trump will be ‘‘reinstated’’ as Presi-
dent later this summer—29 percent. Al-
most a third of Republican voters be-
lieve he will be reinstated as President. 
According to that recent poll by Morn-
ing Consult, nearly a third—nearly a 
third—of Republican voters believe 
Donald Trump will be reinstated. 
Of course, the idea of ‘‘reinstate-
ment’’ 
comes 
from 
the 
disgraced 
former President Trump himself and is 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
deluded 
ramblings of a defeated politician. But 
it is a glaring warning that the Big Lie 
has created fertile ground for all sorts 
of insane conspiracy. 
It is a depressing fact of our times 
that there is an audience out there who 
will literally believe anything the 
former President says, no matter how 
unrealistic or untrue. They believe him 
when he just abjectly lies. 
The blame here, however, does not 
rest only with the former President. 
The blame falls heavily on Washington 
Republicans and the political right who 
have not done enough to stand up to 
the Big Lie. 
After making a few brave noises in 
the wake of January 6, Republican 
leadership here in Washington now 
seems to have traded political courage 
and truth for appeasement. 
The Republican minority leader in 
the House called Donald Trump ‘‘mor-
ally responsible’’ for the attack on 
January 6. He empowered his deputies 
to take part in painstaking negotia-
tions to establish an independent com-
mission to study those events and then 
promptly voted against it. He convened 
his entire conference to deliver a pink 
slip to the one Member of his leader-
ship team who dared repeat the truth 
that President Biden is the President. 
Here in the Senate, the Republican 
leader gave a strong speech on January 
6 and was willing to hold Donald 
Trump responsible for what happened 
that day. Several months later, how-
ever, the Republican leader whipped his 
Members into a partisan filibuster of 
an independent commission, which he 
called a ‘‘purely political exercise.’’ 
The 
Republican 
Party 
is 
now 
wrapped around the axle of the Big Lie, 
and a big reason why is that Repub-
lican leaders are unwilling to move on 
from Trumpism. 
We are watching the results play out 
in State after State, where Republican 
legislatures have swallowed the Big Lie 
whole and are rapidly constricting the 
right to vote and fumbling through old 
ballots for traces of bamboo. 
The truth is, the Big Lie has con-
sequences. It erodes our trust in elec-
tions, faith in our democracy, and it is 
gnawing away at the very right to vote 
in America. 
After 4 long years during which the 
Republican Party foolishly tried to 
ride the tiger of Donald Trump, it 
seems as though many of them wound 
up inside. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
night, the Air Force announced some 
historic news for South Dakota, and 
today I am proud to share that Ells-
worth Air Force Base in Western South 
Dakota has been officially named Main 
Operating Base 1 for the future B–21 
Bomber, home of the Raider. This des-
ignation not only means that Ells-
worth will be the first base to host the 
B–21 Raider, but it will also host the 
formal training unit and the first oper-
ational squadron. 
Those who have heard me talk about 
the importance of this decision likely 
know the outlook for the base wasn’t 
so rosy 16 years ago. I had just arrived 
here in the Senate in 2005 when Ells-
worth was placed on the base realign-
ment and closure, or BRAC, list that 
May. It was an all-hands effort by the 
congressional delegation and Ellsworth 
and State and community leaders to 
make the case to the Bush administra-
tion and to the BRAC Commission to 
remove Ellsworth from the closure list. 
Many thought South Dakota might 
not have the clout to make this stand; 
that we didn’t wield enough influence. 
We were only given about a 12-percent 
odds of pulling through, but we were 
determined that we weren’t going to 
lose Ellsworth. 
We started by challenging the cost- 
savings assumptions of the BRAC Com-
mission, which began to unravel under

scrutiny, and we proved it would actu-
ally cost money to close Ellsworth. We 
also pressed the Commissioners not to 
put all of our eggs in one basket when 
it comes to our Nation’s security inter-
ests, highlighting the organizational 
risk of consolidating all of our B–1s at 
one location. The outlook was grim, 
but we stood our ground and we won 
the day and we were removed from the 
BRAC list that August. 
But we didn’t stop there. We got 
right to work on building up the base 
so that we would never again find our-
selves in the same position. In 2007, we 
saw the Air Force Financial Services 
Center open at Ellsworth; 2011, saw the 
arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron 
and its command and control stations 
for MQ–9 Reapers. In 2015, a decade- 
long mission paid off with the quad-
rupling of the training airspace for the 
base. The Powder River Training Com-
plex is now the largest training air-
space in the continental United States 
and can be used for large-force exer-
cises that draw combat aircraft from 
across the country, and it is well suited 
for B–21 training. This is just one of 
the efforts that we undertook to put 
Ellsworth in the best position possible 
to secure this new mission, and it is 
wonderful to see it pay off with yester-
day’s announcement. 
I know that while South Dakota is 
celebrating 
today, 
others 
are 
dis-
appointed in this decision. For those 
who were seeking to have the Main Op-
erating Base 1 in their State but will 
now follow Ellsworth in the sequencing 
and wait a little longer for the B–21 
mission to arrive, know this: My sup-
port for the B–21 enterprise will not 
lessen because we are at this mile-
stone. 
As I said, we argued 15 years ago that 
the United States should not put all its 
eggs in one basket when it comes to 
strategic assets. I stand by that rea-
soning to this day. Under the current 
bomber roadmap, every bomber base 
will keep a bomber mission well into 
the future. The Stealth B–21 will even-
tually replace our B–1s and Stealth B– 
2s at bases around the country. Mean-
while, our fleet of B–52s will be given 
new modern engines through a service 
life extension program. All of our 
bomber bases which have played and 
continue to play an essential role in 
our national security will continue to 
do so. Long-range strike will remain a 
team effort. 
The core of our military strength is 
our men and women in uniform. They 
volunteer to lay down their lives, if 
necessary, in the service of our Nation, 
and it is incumbent on us here in Con-
gress to do our part to ensure that they 
have the tools they need to succeed in 
their missions. 
The B–21 is an essential part of that 
equation. I remind my colleagues that 
the United States is one of only three 
countries in the world that operate a 
strategic bomber. The other two coun-
tries are Russia and China, and they 
are both working to develop their own 
next-generation bombers. We cannot 
afford to cede any ground. 
The B–21 is scheduled to take its first 
flight in 2022 and should enter service 
around 2027. It will replace our aging 
B–1s, which have proven a workhorse 
over the last several decades, as well as 
two squadrons of B–2s. 
But our small bomber fleet is grow-
ing smaller. Seventeen of the most 
structurally fatigued B–1s are being re-
tired this year, which has actually per-
mitted maintainers to concentrate re-
sources on the remaining aircraft. 
Flight hours are up, and the B–1 has 
been a key component of the new 
Bomber Task Force missions. 
But that doesn’t mean a smaller 
bomber force is sustainable in the long 
run without reinvestment and mod-
ernization. Our national security re-
quires that the B–21 Program move 
full-speed ahead. Fortunately, public 
reports indicate the B–21 Program is 
on-budget and on-time. ‘‘B–21 speeds to 
IOC,’’ or initial operating capacity, 
reads a headline recently from June 3. 
In an interview, the Air Force Global 
Strike Commander, Gen. Timothy Ray, 
detailed the agile and adaptive B–21 
process. He noted that adding certain 
capabilities to the bombers could take 
one-tenth of the time it has for pre-
vious airframes. 
The ability to incrementally add new 
capabilities and upgrades, instead of 
being forced to make wholesale block 
upgrades, should keep B–21 develop-
ment moving quickly. And Congress— 
Congress can do its part by providing 
stable funding for the B–21. 
Now, with the record of decision for 
Main Operating Base 1 signed, we also 
need to restart in earnest on the in-
vestments necessary to prepare Ells-
worth for the B–21. We can now get to 
work building the high-end mainte-
nance facilities for the B–21’s stealth 
coating, training, and operations build-
ings for the new missions and a secure 
weapons facility for the nuclear mis-
sion. 
Ellsworth has come a long way since 
it was placed on the chopping block 16 
years ago. 
I am grateful to the Air Force for 
this decision and the hard work by so 
many to get us here today. From BRAC 
to B–21, I am humbled to have been a 
small part of this effort, and I remain 
steadfast in my support for the mission 
and the men and women of the 28th 
Bomb Wing. I can’t wait to get to work 
on this new chapter of Ellsworth’s 
story. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
morning, the Labor Department an-
nounced that it had observed the larg-
est uptick in prices since the depths of 
the great recession back in 2008, and 
core inflation has reached a nearly 
three-decade high. 
The latest data reinforced what too 
many Americans have already been ex-
periencing firsthand: The Biden admin-
istration’s partisan spending bill has 
blunted our Nation’s economic recov-
ery with higher prices at the gas pump 
and the grocery store, a tougher time 
for small businesses trying to staff up, 
and 
unemployment 
policies 
that 
incentivize too many Americans to 
simply stay on the sidelines. 
Republicans and outside economists 
warned that the worst of these condi-
tions actually could have been avoided, 
but Democrats chose to go it alone. As 
recently as a few days ago, it appeared 
that President Biden was open to a 
new, more consultative approach to 
major legislation. He and the leading 
Republican on a committee of jurisdic-
tion were engaged in what appeared to 
be good-faith, bipartisan negotiations 
on infrastructure spending, but then 
the President decided to walk away. 
Now, at the White House’s direction, 
Democrats in Congress are making 
preparations 
to 
muscle 
through 
a 
bloated spending bill on a unilateral, 
partisan basis, and it is becoming clear 
that the sort of united, bipartisan ac-
tion Ranking Member CAPITO has made 
possible within the EPW Committee is 
getting harder and harder to replicate. 
The bipartisanship that has defined 
infrastructure policy for years is be-
coming the exception to Democrats’ 
new partisan rule. It might have some-
thing to do with the fact that our 
Democratic friends have taken to using 
‘‘infrastructure’’ as a code for a grow-
ing wish list of unrelated liberal spend-
ing. 
The Biden administration’s first in-
frastructure plan made that much 
clear from its rollout back in March. 
Remember, this was a multitrillion- 
dollar bill that proposed to spend more 
on electric vehicles than on actual 
roads and bridges. It contained so 
many leftwing pet projects that the au-
thors of the Green New Deal boasted 
about just how much of their mani-
festo’s DNA had actually rubbed off. 
Well, the administration’s approach 
clearly influenced a number of Demo-
crats right here in the Senate. Last 
month, on the same day that Chairman 
CARPER and Ranking Member CAPITO 
were guiding a surface transportation 
bill to a unanimous vote, the Finance 
Committee was busy marking up a par-
tisan plan to pick winners and losers in 
the market for reliable domestic en-
ergy. 
Just this week, we watched their go- 
it-alone approach replicated by Demo-
crats over in the House. The Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee 
had a perfect opportunity to reach con-
sensus on surface transportation. Our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4026 
June 10, 2021 
colleagues on the EPW Committee had 
left a clear roadmap on exactly how to 
cut a consensus deal, but instead, the 
House chairman forced his committee 
to mark up $547 billion littered—lit-
tered—with Green New Deal policies. 
Compared to the last multiyear high-
way bill, it nearly doubles the share of 
resources 
for 
mass 
urban 
transit 
projects, while upping the road-and- 
bridge funding Middle America relies 
on by not nearly as much. In contrast 
to smart permit-streaming steps taken 
by our colleagues’ Senate bill, it large-
ly neglects to help the communities 
and builders who spent years wading 
through Federal redtape before they 
can even break ground. 
The recent history of investment in 
roads, bridges, waterways, airports, 
and broadband tells us that smart, tar-
geted solutions are capable of earning 
overwhelming 
support. 
But 
until 
Democrats get serious, the road ahead 
for consensus action on our Nation’s 
infrastructure will only get steeper. 
ABORTION 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, unfortunately the administration’s 
radical left turn touches much more 
than just infrastructure policy. In fact, 
it 
includes 
an 
unprecedented 
new 
threat to the basic dignity of human 
life. 
On the campaign trail last year, 
President Biden announced that he 
would abandon a mainstream position 
he had held literally for decades: that 
taxpayer dollars should not be used to 
fund abortions. It was an alarming re-
versal. But under immense pressure 
from the far left, President Biden kept 
his radical campaign promise, shrugged 
off a commonsense precedent upheld by 
administrations of both parties for 
more than 40 years, and proposed a 
budget that entirely erases the protec-
tions of the Hyde amendment. 
When asked about it at a hearing 
yesterday, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services confirmed that the 
President’s change of heart was not a 
mistake, saying: ‘‘The budget is a re-
flection of what the President has 
said.’’ This new fringe stance on tax-
payer-funded abortions aligns much 
more closely with the Secretary’s own 
views, as our colleagues may recall 
from his confirmation process. 
Now, it is no secret that the Demo-
cratic Party has been hurtling to the 
left on abortion in recent years. Here 
in the Senate, our colleagues have re-
peatedly blocked efforts to limit elec-
tive abortion after the 20th week. Their 
opposition keeps the United States in a 
rather inglorious company alongside 
China, North Korea, and just four other 
countries that fail to offer this basic 
protection to the unborn. 
So President Biden’s decision to 
abandon the Hyde amendment aligns 
him with an increasingly radical con-
sensus among elected Democrats, but 
it puts him way out of step with the 
clear majority of Americans who op-
pose taxpayer-funded abortion. 
The administration’s budget request 
continues to make headlines for all the 
wrong reasons, but its plan to sell out 
on longstanding protections for the 
most vulnerable Americans might just 
be the lowest of the low. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, the latest data from Customs and 
Border Protection show that the cur-
rent fiscal year has seen the highest 
number of migrant apprehensions since 
2006. Let me say that again. We are 8 
months into fiscal year 2021, but the 
CBP has already apprehended more mi-
grants at our southern border than in 
any full year since 2006. 
It is hard to overstate the humani-
tarian and security crisis that has un-
folded this year. Monthly arrivals of 
unaccompanied minors reached their 
highest levels on record. Higher border 
traffic concealed an alarming rise of 
flows of deadly drugs like fentanyl. 
CBP recently announced its apprehen-
sions even included individuals who are 
on the terrorist watch list. 
The origins of this crisis are cer-
tainly not a mystery. The Democrats 
who have spent the last few months in 
the White House focusing on what to 
call it instead of how to fix it are the 
same Democrats who spent last year 
sending potential migrants dangerous 
mixed signals from the campaign trail: 
‘‘You want to flee. . . . you should 
come.’’ That was future President 
Biden. ‘‘No . . . they should not be de-
ported.’’ 
That 
was 
then-Senator 
KAMALA HARRIS. 
Sure enough, CBP officials are re-
porting that many migrants they en-
counter believe that ‘‘there has been a 
change in immigration laws . . . a gap 
in enforcement on the U.S. border’’ 
under the new administration. 
But if you ask now-Vice President 
HARRIS, the administration’s point per-
son on the border, there is apparently 
blame to be found everywhere but her 
own party’s rhetoric on immigration, 
and there is value in going just about 
anywhere but the border itself. 
This week, the Vice President’s in-
vestigation of the root causes of migra-
tion brought her to Guatemala and 
Mexico. The administration’s delega-
tion was apparently keen to talk about 
factors like corruption and climate 
change, but the President of Guate-
mala had a different agenda. As he put 
it, ‘‘We asked the United States Gov-
ernment to send more of a clear mes-
sage.’’ Sound familiar? 
Of course, one place Vice President 
HARRIS did not stop on her trip was the 
U.S.-Mexico 
border, 
and, 
bizarrely, 
when she even plans to do that remains 
completely unclear. When asked about 
it in an interview this week, the Vice 
President responded with a laugh: ‘‘I 
don’t understand the point that you’re 
making.’’ 
For months, the Biden administra-
tion has assured the American people 
that when it comes to our southern 
border, Vice President HARRIS has it 
covered, and they are betting on it. 
The White House budget request pro-
poses no increase in funding for DHS, 
whose agents are working overtime to 
contend with the crisis on the ground. 
Well, there are a lot of folks on both 
sides of the border who are still wait-
ing for the point person to actually 
take charge.

NOMINATION OF ZAHID N. QURAISHI 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week the Senate will consider the nom-
ination of Zahid Quraishi to be judge 
on the U.S. District Court for the Dis-
trict of New Jersey. 
Judge Quraishi has had an amazing 
public service career, and since 2019 he 
has served as a U.S. magistrate judge. 
Once confirmed, Mr. Quraishi of New 
Jersey will be the first Muslim Amer-
ican in U.S. history to serve as an arti-
cle III Federal judge. 
The son of Pakistani immigrants, 
Judge Quraishi was born in New York 
City and grew up in Fanwood, NJ. He 
graduated from Rutgers Law School 
and joined a law firm in his home State 
of New Jersey. But his time in the pri-
vate sector was cut short by a strange, 
tragic twist of fate. His first day of 
work was September 11, 2001. 
Those events of that day inspired 
Judge Quraishi to consider a career in 
public service. He applied to the U.S. 
Army Judge Advocate General’s Corps, 
where he was commissioned as an offi-
cer and attained the rank of captain. 
Judge Quraishi was twice deployed to 
Iraq, in 2004 and 2006. For his service, 
he was awarded the Bronze Star and 
Combat Action Badge. 
After 
leaving 
the 
Army, 
Judge 
Quraishi continued to work in public 
service, first as an assistant chief coun-
sel in the U.S. Department of Home-
land Security and then as a Federal 
prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice for the District of New Jersey. 
Before becoming a U.S. magistrate 
judge, Judge Quraishi served as a part-
ner as well as chief diversity officer at 
a law firm in New Jersey. During his 
time, he was recognized as a New Lead-
er of the Bar by the New Jersey Law 
Journal and awarded the Professional 
Achievement Award by the Asian Pa-
cific American Lawyers Association. 
Judge Quraishi received a unanimous 
rating of ‘‘well qualified’’ from the 
American Bar Association. He also has 
strong support from his home State 
Senators, Senators BOOKER and MENEN-
DEZ, and received broad, bipartisan 
support in the Judiciary Committee, 
with eight Republicans joining all 
Democrats in voting to advance his 
nomination. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting in favor of this historic nomina-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today following the 
conclusion of Vice President HARRIS’s 
border evasion tour to Guatemala and 
Mexico earlier this week. 
As a physician, I have had the oppor-
tunity to do multiple mission trips to 
Mexico and Central America, and I 
have been to the border now three 
times. I have seen the crisis firsthand, 
which is why it was so concerning to 
me that in the early days of this new 
administration, they followed through 
on a number of campaign promises re-
lated to opening our border and curb-
ing control measures put in place by 
the previous administration. 
Just to be clear, the current adminis-
tration issued multiple Executive or-
ders and actions on immigration, in-
cluding halting construction of the 
border wall, ending the ‘‘Remain in 
Mexico’’ policy, and reaffirming the 
White House’s commitment to grant 
blanket amnesty to 11 million illegal 
immigrants residing in the United 
States. While President Biden and his 
administration appear surprised by the 
massive influx of immigrants and mi-
grants encountered in the aftermath, 
this was a predictable result. 
As described by the President of Gua-
temala, once the message from the 
White House changed to, ‘‘We’re going 
to reunite families, we’re going to re-
unite children. The very next day, the 
coyotes were here organizing groups of 
children to take them to the United 
States.’’ 
On March 24, after months of result-
ing escalating crises on our southern 
border, President Biden tapped Vice 
President HARRIS to serve as his border 
czar. In the 10 weeks that have passed 
since her appointment, the situation at 
the border has continued to worsen. In 
April, Customs and Border Protection 
officials made more than 178,000 appre-
hensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 
May, they once again made more than 
170,000 
apprehensions, 
marking 
the 
third straight month over that figure. 
These are 20-year records. 
As demonstrated in an interview 
with Lester Holt this week, Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS considers these staggering

numbers a laughing matter. If she took 
her role seriously and actually visited 
our southern border, she would realize 
that Americans who live in border 
communities are not laughing. That is 
because their towns are being over-
whelmed by migrants, and they feel 
their lives are in danger. 
Now, the origin of these migrants has 
expanded as the crisis has gone on. In 
recent weeks and months, Border Pa-
trol has encountered significant num-
bers of migrants from Ecuador, Ven-
ezuela, Cuba, and Brazil. While these 
arrivals have come from a wide variety 
of nations, the majority of the border 
crossings continue to come from Mex-
ico and the Northern Triangle coun-
tries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El 
Salvador. 
Despite years of foreign aid and as-
sistance to the nations, this is a trend 
we have seen growing in recent years. 
Since 2018, Border Patrol has encoun-
tered 
approximately 
5 
percent 
of 
Honduras’s population, 3.5 percent of 
Guatemala’s, and roughly 3 percent of 
El Salvador’s population. Now Vice 
President HARRIS is proposing to pro-
vide more than $300 million in regional 
humanitarian aid and a $4 billion long- 
term plan for Central America. 
However, as this graph shows, there 
is little evidence to show that this type 
of cash injection will reduce migration 
from these Northern Triangle nations, 
and Biden administration officials ac-
knowledge that even if these efforts 
were successful, it would take years or 
possibly even decades to truly make an 
impact. This is not the type of urgency 
needed to address this raging crisis on 
our border. This is simply throwing 
good money after bad money. 
Let’s take a look how policy impacts 
the border. This graph proves the cause 
of the crisis is policy, and aid has been 
ineffective in remaking the economy of 
the Northern Triangle. These econo-
mies need much more than intermit-
tent aid infusion. I like to use the 
phrase ‘‘trade not aid.’’ Since entering 
into CAFTA-DR in 2005, the United 
States has increased trade between the 
United States and the other six coun-
tries in the agreement: Costa Rica, the 
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Gua-
temala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. As 
of 2019, goods traded among the coun-
tries included in the pact increased by 
62 percent. By working to expand trade 
in the region, the United States could 
boost capital investment and pros-
perity. 
This type of productivity could result 
in further good job opportunities and 
encourage individuals in the Northern 
Triangle to remain home rather than 
pouring across our southern border. It 
also has the potential to reconfigure 
supply chains away from China and 
bolster our relationship with nations in 
our hemisphere at a time when China 
is moving to exploit developing coun-
tries. 
I have seen the empty warehouses 
and jobs leaving Central America first-
hand in Honduras on mission trips—a 
result of China entering the World 
Trade Organization. Through stronger 
trade agreements, we can help bring 
jobs back to our hemisphere, particu-
larly those that would help address 
some of our medical supply challenges, 
such as making medical gowns, masks, 
and gloves. These could easily be made 
in Central America. 
At the same time, it is absurd that 
this administration cannot chew gum 
and walk at the same time. Proposing 
$4 billion of taxpayer funds in an aid 
package, when their recently proposed 
$6 trillion budget request does not in-
clude funding increases for the mis-
sions carried out by the Department of 
Homeland Security along the border, is 
astonishing. 
A final point, Vice President HARRIS 
keeps saying she wants to get to the 
root of the problem, and while White 
House policy has created the crisis at 
the border, the true long-term root of 
the problem is the lack of law and 
order in Central America, which leads 
to unstable economies. 
The policies first put in place by 
President Obama and now by the cur-
rent administration have enriched the 
cartels, further encouraged violence, 
and harmed Central American econo-
mies. By not truly addressing the 
roots, their policies continue to en-
courage migrants to make the long 
dangerous journey north. 
We must continue to build a wall 
along the southern border and increase 
funding for technology, radars, towers, 
air assets, and others. We must also re-
instate the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ pro-
gram. Our Vice President, acting as 
border czar, must visit our southern 
border 
communities 
and 
the 
CBP 
agents and officers overwhelmed by 
this self-inflicted crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
NOMINATION OF ZAHID QURAISHI 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
thank my distinguished colleague from 
New Jersey for allowing me to go first 
because I have one of our foreign coun-
try’s Ambassador in my office. 
Today, in the Senate, we have an op-
portunity to both alleviate a judicial 
emergency and make history by sup-
porting the confirmation of Zahid 
Quraishi to the U.S. District Court of 
New Jersey, where he currently serves 
as a U.S. magistrate judge. 
As I mentioned many times in the 
past, the vacancies on this court have 
been declared judicial emergencies by 
the Judicial Conference of the United 
States. The U.S. District of New Jersey 
is one of the busiest courts in the en-
tire country, with 46,000 cases pending 
before it. Yet being short-staffed has 
left our judges with mind-boggling 
caseloads, more than three times the 
national average. 
Fortunately, we in the Senate have 
an extraordinary nominee before us 
this week. Judge Quraishi has devoted 
his career to serving our country, and 
his story embodies both the rich diver-
sity of New Jersey and the promise of 
America as a place where anything is 
possible. 
He was born in New York, grew up in 
Fanwood, NJ, with his parents, both 
immigrants from Pakistan, who came 
to this country to build a better life. In 
1997, he graduated from the John Jay 
College of Criminal Justice in New 
York, and in 2000, he earned his J.D. 
from Rutgers Law School, my alma 
mater. 
After a clerkship with the New Jer-
sey Superior Court, Mr. Quraishi ac-
cepted a position with a New York law 
firm. His first day on the job was Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and the horrific events 
of that day prompted him to change 
the trajectory of his career and focus 
on serving our country. 
In 2003, he joined the U.S. Army 
Judge Advocate General’s Corps, where 
he earned the rank of captain and 
served two deployments in Iraq—first 
in 2004 and then 2006. For his service, 
Mr. Quraishi was awarded the Bronze 
Star and the Combat Action Badge, a 
recognition by the U.S. Army for non-
infantry soldiers who engage in ground 
combat. 
After leaving the Army, he continued 
to work in public service, first as trial 
counsel with the Department of Home-
land Security and then as a Federal 
prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice for the District of New Jersey. 
In 2013, he joined the law firm of 
Riker Danzig, where he worked until 
2019, when he was appointed as a U.S. 
magistrate judge for the U.S. district 
court and became the first Asian- 
American Federal judge in New Jer-
sey’s history. 
Now Mr. Quraishi is poised to break 
barriers once more. If confirmed, he 
will become the first Muslim American 
in U.S. history to serve as an article III 
Federal judge. My colleagues, Zahid 
Quraishi is a man of integrity, a con-
summate public servant, and a trail-
blazer for Asian Americans and Muslim 
Americans across this country who 
dream of one day presiding over a court 
of their own. 
We should all draw our inspiration 
from his story because it is a story 
that could only take place in the 
United States of America. I urge my 
colleagues to support this historic 
nomination to the U.S. District Court 
of New Jersey without delay. 
And I want to thank my distin-
guished colleague from New Jersey, 
Senator BOOKER, for bringing Judge 
Quraishi’s nomination to the President 
and to myself, and it is an example of 
the power of having someone sitting on 
the Judiciary Committee knowing the 
importance of diversity, so that any 
American who comes before a Federal 
court can think that someone like 
them is sitting in judgment of them. 
So I thank Senator BOOKER. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I thank 
my senior Senator, who himself has an

S4029 
June 10, 2021 
improbable story, his lived experience, 
a son of immigrants coming up in New 
Jersey, being born in a way that he 
knows struggle and knows poverty. 
And the fact that he is on the Senate 
floor speaking about someone else who 
has an improbable story shows you the 
greatness of America. 
I am grateful for my senior Senator 
and chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee for taking time to show us 
the importance of this moment. This is 
history here. 
America has never before had an arti-
cle III judge who also happens to be a 
Muslim. That has never before hap-
pened. Think about this: 200-plus years 
in American history, a country that 
was born and our Founders enshrined 
in our very founding documents, in the 
Bill of Rights, this ideal of freedom of 
religion. We celebrate religious plu-
rality and religious diversity. 
So this is an extraordinary moment. 
Now, I am thrilled that it is a bipar-
tisan moment. In committee, during 
this time of heightened partisanship, in 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
Judge 
Quraishi passed out 19 to 3—19 to 3— 
which is a further testimony not just 
to the gravity of this historic moment, 
not just to a man’s religion, but to the 
man himself, the core of who he is. 
Senator MENENDEZ said this. 
Many people, after 9/11, felt the deep, 
agonizing grief in this country. We are 
not defined as a nation by what hap-
pens to us. We are defined by how we 
choose to respond. From the attacks at 
Pearl Harbor to the attacks on 9/11, 
those horrific moments, you saw how 
this Nation showed who it is—our grit, 
our guts, our grace, our greatness. 
That 
is 
the 
tradition 
of 
Judge 
Quraishi. A man that had a glide path 
toward a career of comfort and private 
sector success made a decision. Those 
horrific tragedies, he would not let 
them define our Nation. How we de-
fined ourselves was by people like him. 
He joined the Army. He became a 
U.S. Army judge advocate. He attained 
the rank of captain. He was deployed to 
Iraq—first in 2004 and then again in 
2006. And after his service in the mili-
tary, Judge Quraishi continued his 
service to the Nation, like so many of 
our veterans do—first as the assistant 
chief counsel in the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security and then as a Fed-
eral prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office for the District of New Jersey. 
Do not define a person by what they 
say. Simply do not define them by 
their faith and do not define them by 
the color of their skin, but by the con-
tent of their character and in the ac-
tions that they take. In a time that our 
Nation was crippled with grief, he 
stood up and he served, and he has been 
serving every single step since. He is 
‘‘well qualified.’’ That is what the 
American Bar Association says. 
But I tell you, he is well qualified on 
a higher standard than that. He is a pa-
triot to this country. Patriotism is 
love of Nation, but love is not a being 
verb. It is a doing verb. It is action. His 
actions have shown his love for Amer-
ica, and now he is up here in this 
Chamber to make history. I urge my 
colleagues, as we saw in the Judiciary 
Committee in a 19-to-3 vote, to vote in 
a bipartisan way. 
This is a chance for the annals of 
time to show our commitment to great 
people, to a great man, to a person of 
character, to a person of commitment, 
to a person of conviction, to a person of 
patriotism who happens also to be Mus-
lim and, for the first time in American 
history, 
to 
achieve 
something. 
It 
should have been achieved a long time 
ago. 
I am going to conclude by saying 
something: Judge Quraishi and I are 
relatively of a similar age, and we 
share another painful life happening 
that I know many of my colleagues 
have shared as well. During COVID–19, 
during this pandemic, the judge’s fa-
ther died. I talked to him during this

ple of faith. And I want to tell him 
right now and say into this record: It is 
your father who also loved this coun-
try, who brought about an American 
dream for his family. He is watching 
right now this happening, these delib-

right now, Your father is proud of you.

June 10, 2021 
break. We know that when school is 
out, many students who receive free 
and reduced-price meals throughout 
the school year are not getting the nu-
trition that they need. 
The pandemic required us to explore 
innovative options for getting food and 
nutrition, for getting that assistance 
to children in need, especially those 
who were in rural and hard-to-serve 
areas. That is why I, along with Sen-
ator LEAHY, have reintroduced the 
Hunger-Free Summer for Kids Act. 
I am pleased that we have 12 bipar-
tisan cosponsors and the support of na-
tional 
organizations 
like 
Feeding 
America, Share Our Strength, Tusk 
Philanthropies, Bread for the World, 
the Alliance to End Hunger, MAZON: A 
Jewish Response to Hunger, and Save 
the Children. 
When I served as a school board 
member many years ago, I saw how im-
portant the national school meals pro-
gram is to providing many children 
with healthy meals, helping them to 
learn and grow. I also saw that many 
kids were left without nutritious food 
during the summer months. 
Seeing this reality is, in part, why I 
wanted to serve as cochair of the Sen-
ate Hunger Caucus. It is the reason 
why I care about these programs, en-
suring we have a bipartisan child nutri-
tion reauthorization process that can 
include this bill that Senator LEAHY 
and I are introducing. 
Before the pandemic, we had data 
that showed the traditional Summer 
Food Service Program was not serving 
all of the kids who needed these meals. 
Only one in seven children receiving 
free or reduced-price meals during the 
school year were receiving meals from 
the current Summer Meals Program. 
Big gaps exist, especially in rural 
areas. According to Feeding America, 
86 percent of counties with children 
most at risk for food insecurity are 
rural counties. 
The current program requires chil-
dren to come to a feeding site and eat 
their meals with other children. This 
concept has its benefits, as it builds a 
sense of community, provides a safe 
place for kids to go, and then offers 
them a chance to participate in other 
physical and enrichment activities. 
However, we know that getting kids 
to a feeding site can be a real chal-
lenge. Buses take students to school, 
but the buses don’t run in the summer. 
During the pandemic, Congress gave 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture the 
authority to waive the requirement 
that kids had to eat meals together at 
feeding 
sites. 
This 
flexibility 
has 
spurred innovation with public-private 
partnerships. For instance, in my home 
State of Arkansas, Faulkner County 
did a tremendous job packing meal 
boxes to be sent home to families. Vol-
unteers have delivered meals through 
mobile delivery routes. Thanks to the 
Meals to You program that was coordi-
nated by the Baylor Collaborative on 
Hunger and Poverty, more than 1.1 mil-
lion meals were delivered directly to 
the doorstep of almost 9,000 children 
living in rural Arkansas. 
According to Share Our Strength, 
there was a 160-percent increase in the 
number of meals served by allowing 
offsite consumption of meals. 
Another way to ensure kids are re-
ceiving access to food is through the 
Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer 
Program. Each child receives a set 
amount of money that is loaded onto 
an EBT card. Families then can shop 
for food to make sure their kids get the 
nutrition they need. This program has 
been tested for a number of years by 
the USDA. The results have shown that 
providing a $30 monthly benefit for a 
child was effective in reducing the 
most severe category of food insecurity 
during the summer and can lead to 
positive changes in children’s nutri-
tional outcomes through the consump-
tion of healthier foods. 
This bill expands how we ensure chil-
dren receive healthy meals throughout 
the summer. 
The pandemic has certainly shown 
the importance and the success of this 
program when offsite consumption and 
EBT are options States can utilize to 
feed children. 
I want to commend the volunteers 
and staff on the frontlines who are 
there each and every day ensuring that 
children receive the nutrition they 
need. They work tirelessly, being true 
heroes to so many families during the 
pandemic. I thank them for their hard 
work, their innovation, and their dedi-
cation. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the weeks and months 
ahead to see this bill become part of a 
permanent, bipartisan child nutrition 
reauthorization law. It is important 
that members of the Ag Committee 
work together in a bipartisan manner, 
through regular order, agreeing on the 
policy and the offsets that will be re-
quired to provide schools, States, and 
families greater certainty into the fu-
ture. I am committed to a bipartisan 
path forward, and this bill is just the 
beginning. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 247 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, women 
make invaluable contributions to our 
families, communities, and workplaces. 
Thankfully, 
the 
opportunities 
for 
women in the workplace have grown 
tremendously over time and in recent 
decades, and there is no doubt that, 
without 
exception 
or 
qualification, 
they should always be treated equally 
and receive equal pay for the same 
work as their male counterparts. 
This week, the Senate considered 
proceeding to a bill called the Pay-
check Fairness Act—one that was di-
rected at achieving this goal by ad-
dressing the gender pay gap. But if we 
truly care about supporting and em-
powering women in the workplace, it is 
important that we understand exactly 
what the pay gap is and what exactly it 
can tell us about women’s experiences. 
So what is the pay gap? Well, first, 
there is a crucial distinction that we 
have to make between the unadjusted 
pay gap and the adjusted pay gap. 
When most people refer to the gender 
pay gap, they mean the unadjusted pay 
gap, or the comparison between the 
median man’s pay and the median 
woman’s pay, based only on sex. Ac-
cording to this measure, the median 
earnings of women are 18 percent lower 
than men. But the unadjusted pay gap 
leaves out key pieces of the puzzle. In 
reality, there are many other factors 
that influence pay for individual men 
and women, such as industry, occupa-
tion, experience, education, perform-
ance, and in particular, family deci-
sions. 
The adjusted pay gap does take these 
factors into account and turns out to 
be a much smaller number—a very dif-
ferent number—than the unadjusted 
pay gap. When controlling for these 
factors, and thus comparing men and 
women with the same jobs and quali-
fications, the pay gap falls to just 2 
percent, which can arguably be ex-
plained by nondiscriminatory factors 
like performance that other studies 
have not yet addressed. 
The pay gap before and after parent-
hood tells us something else that is 
key too. This measure suggests that 
women are paid less not simply because 
they are women but because of the 
family decisions they make typically 
after having children. Women are far 
more likely to take on more of the 
caretaker responsibilities within their 
families and thus make work-related 
tradeoffs that allow them to do so. 
One study in Denmark found that av-
erage women’s earnings are comparable 
to men’s earnings before parenthood 
but drop after the birth of their first 
child, when hours worked and partici-
pation rates tend to fall for women. 
Another study by the Harvard Busi-
ness Review found that women are 
more likely to make decisions to limit 
work-related travel, choose a more 
flexible job, slow down career pace, 
make a lateral move, or leave a job in 
order to accommodate family respon-
sibilities. 
Ultimately, the pay gap seems to 
show in large part the particular 
choices and preferences of women in 
their career and family paths. 
So in light of this information, what 
would the Paycheck Fairness Act do? 
This bill would allow employees to sue 
businesses that pay workers different 
wages even if the differences have 
nothing to do with the sex of the em-
ployee at issue. As a result, businesses 
would be forced to ignore the rest of 
the factors that influence pay, includ-
ing merit, which is and should be the 
main determinant of earnings. It would 
instead enforce rigid, collective pay 
scales that would reduce flexibility in 
benefits or hours—the very thing that 
employees want in the workplace. 
If this legislation were to become 
law, instead of receiving higher pay, 
women would likely find it harder to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4031 
June 10, 2021 
get their foot in the door. Employers 
could be more reticent to hire women 
in 
some 
circumstances, 
especially 
those reentering the workforce, since 
they automatically would be included 
in future gender- or race-based class 
action lawsuits, and it would raise 
costs for businesses and hurt wages 
across the board. 
In short, it is a federally mandated, 
one-size-fits-all approach to pay that 
would only take away choice, oppor-
tunity, and flexibility for women—the 
very things that Congress ought to en-
sure are allowed. Indeed, surveys show 
that workplace flexibility is incredibly 
valuable to women. One survey esti-
mates that 60 percent of female job-
seekers say that greater work-life bal-
ance and personal well-being are very 
important to them when considering a 
job, and 46 percent of female employees 
say flextime is the most important 
benefit a company can offer employees. 
Further research shows that produc-
tivity can be improved by as much as 
50 percent when flexible options are 
available to workers. 
If we are to empower women and 
make it easier for them to increase 
their earnings, we should not be get-
ting in the way of flexible options that 
can help. 
Thankfully, the rejection of the Pay-
check Fairness Act this week proved 
that it is not the right approach. There 
is, indeed, a better path forward. The 
bill I am proposing, the Working Fami-
lies Flexibility Act, would help provide 
it. 
For decades, Federal labor laws have 
unfairly restricted private sector em-
ployees from choosing either tradi-
tional overtime pay or paid time off as 
compensation 
for 
overtime 
hours 
worked, while granting a special ex-
emption for government employees. 
This legal disparity between private 
sector employees and public sector em-
ployees unfairly discriminates against 
working men and women in the private 
sector, and it is long overdue that it be 
addressed. There is no reason that 
these working moms and dads in the 
private sector should be prevented 
from receiving the flexibility that em-
ployees in the government are able to 
receive. 
My bill would simply amend the Fair 
Labor Standards Act to allow private 
sector employers to give their employ-
ees the option to choose either tradi-
tional overtime pay or paid time off, 
both accrued at 1.5 times the overtime 
hours worked. It is a totally voluntary 
proposal for both employers and em-
ployees. Employers are not forced to 
offer it, and employees are not forced 
to take it. 
In addition to offering safeguards to 
ensure that the choice to use comp 
time is voluntary, it retains all exist-
ing labor law protections for employ-
ees, including the 40-hour workweek 
and overtime accrual protections. 
If we truly seek to empower women 
in the workplace, we ought to give 
them the freedom and flexibility to 
pursue their careers and the families 
they desire. The Working Families 
Flexibility Act would do just that, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
This is something that we ought to 
adopt right now. This is something 
that Federal law already allows for, for 
government employees, and we ought 
to end the discrimination against pri-
vate sector employees. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 247 and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, let me just 
say that over the last year, we have 
heard constantly that you should ‘‘stay 
home when you are sick.’’ It is good ad-
vice, of course, and the right thing to 
do for public health, and I certainly en-
courage people to do it. But what I 
thought about every single time was, 
what about the workers who can’t just 
stay home? There are a lot of them. 
Right now, 32 million American 
workers do not have access to a single 
paid sick day. Let me repeat that. 
Thirty-two 
million 
people 
in 
the 
United States will lose pay if they stay 
home because they are sick or because 
they have to care for a sick loved one. 
Only 20 percent of private sector work-
ers in the United States have paid fam-
ily 
leave 
through 
their 
employer, 
meaning millions of workers will lose 
pay if they give birth or have a sick 
child, for just a few examples. 
What I hear from workers in these 
situations is that they need to know 
they have the ability to take time off 
without worrying about losing their 
paycheck and without worrying about 
whether their boss will allow them. 
That is why I am on the floor today 
to object in the strongest terms to the 
misleadingly titled bill the Senator 
from Utah just proposed. His bill would 
allow employers to offer workers’ comp 
time instead of time-and-a-half pay 
when workers put in overtime. 
Here is why this won’t work when it 
comes to taking paid leave. Under this 
bill, the so-called Working Families 
Flexibility Act, workers would have no 
guaranteed right to use the comp time 
they have earned even when there is an 
emergency. And it actually gets worse 
from there. Under this bill, if a work-
er’s claim is denied, their only option 
to fight back is to request that their 
comp time be cashed out, and the em-
ployer has a whole month to comply. 
As of March 2021, more than half of 
Americans said they were living pay-
check to paycheck. A month is not 
going to work for them. 
Anyone who is serious about making 
sure workers can support themselves 
and care for themselves and their fami-
lies should reject this bill and work 
with my colleagues and me to pass 
Senator GILLIBRAND’s FAMILY Act and 
the Healthy Families Act Congress-
woman DELAURO and I introduced. Our 
legislation would actually truly give 
workers flexibility and the weight off 
their shoulders as they navigate the 
kinds of tough times we all encounter 
in our lives. 
Look, when this pandemic struck, we 
saw how costly not having paid leave 
has been for our workers, for our fami-
lies, for our businesses, and for our 
country. Millions of workers were 
forced to choose between the well- 
being of themselves and their cowork-
ers and their families or their pay-
check. Millions were infected, and mil-
lions 
more—especially 
women 
and 
workers of color—were forced out of 
their jobs in large part due to lacking 
paid 
leave 
or 
quality, 
affordable 
childcare options. 
This pandemic has really made it 
more clear than ever: It is far past 
time we made paid leave a right for all, 
not just a privilege for some. 
Now is not the time for more false 
choices and stress for our workers. It is 
a time to get real solutions over the 
finish line, so I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is unfortu-
nate that the Senate won’t choose to 
make available to private sector work-
ers options that are already available 
to government employees. 
Just to reiterate here, under this leg-
islation, employers are not required to 
offer it; employees are not required to 
take it. This just eliminates the ves-
tigial remains of labor laws passed dec-
ades ago that denied workers and em-
ployers this option. They keep that 
open for government workers. That is 
discriminatory. It is unfair, and it 
ought to end. 
VOTE ON QURAISHI NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Quraishi nomination? 
Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise for the seventh time to call for 
this entire body to have the oppor-
tunity to consider and cast their votes 
for the Military Justice Improvement 
and Increasing Prevention Act. 
This commonsense reform would en-
sure that people in the military who 
have been subjected to sexual assault 
or other serious crimes get the justice 
they deserve. 
In the 8 years that I spent advocating 
for this reform, with many other Sen-
ators, I have heard some criticism from 
those who would rather not see change 
to our military justice system. I want-
ed to take this time to briefly respond 
to a few of those criticisms. 
First, I have heard that the bill will 
add bureaucracy to the process. The 
fact is, this bill actually cuts redtape. 
Instead of needing to find time on a 
commander’s busy schedule for a mili-
tary prosecutor to brief them on the 
case, the prosecutor’s recommenda-
tions, instead, become the prosecutor’s 
decision. 
Under this law, prosecutors who un-
derstand complex military justice con-
cepts like unlawful command influence 
and evidentiary standards make the de-
cision, rather than a commander whose 
time 
is 
better 
spent 
focusing 
on 
warfighting than on learning the evi-
dentiary rules. I have to wonder if 
these critics have actually read the 
bill, since it specifically requires the 
services to use existing resources that 
we have already provided to accom-
plish this reform. 
Second, detractors worry that this 
law will result in fewer prosecutions. 
The opposite is true. Under the current 
system, only about one-third of sur-
vivors are willing to even come forward 
to report a crime. When 64 percent of 
victims are retaliated against for com-
ing forward and less than 1 percent of 
victims actually sees a conviction, who 
can blame them? 
When we put complex cases in the 
hands of impartial, professional pros-
ecutors, both victims and the accused 
will have more faith and more con-
fidence in the system. The more con-
fidence survivors have in the system, 
the more they are likely to come for-
ward. And the more survivors who 
come forward, the more offenders we 
can prosecute. 
Third, those who would rather push 
off this reform to maintain the status 
quo sometimes say that there is a lack 
of data to support the policy and worry 
that it would somehow collapse good 
order and discipline. There is no lack of 
data on justice systems to pull from. 
Our major Western allies have imple-
mented systems like this, and in coun-
try after country, this type of reform, 
just like other military justice re-
forms, has improved good order and 
discipline. 
In Israel, for example, this system 
brought survivors out of the shadows 
and gave them confidence to report. 
From 2012 to 2017, the Israeli military 
saw a 91-percent increase in willingness 
to report crimes. During that same pe-
riod, the U.S. military saw an increase 
of only 33 percent. Despite the success 
of the #MeToo movement, we are still 
lagging so far behind in fostering a 
military climate where victims feel 
safe to come forward. 
Year after year, detractors have had 
the same dogmatic response: Com-
manders will be unable to maintain 
good order and discipline if we make 
this change. Well, I have talked to 
commanders who have seen the need 
for change, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. They can start 
with 
my 
cosponsor, 
Senator 
JONI 
ERNST. If commanders feel this author-
ity is essential to their ability to lead, 
then they have a lot more to learn 
about leadership. 
Last, we have the argument that is 
developing that, if we do make this 
change, to just make it a little bit. 
Let’s just do it for one crime. Let’s just 
do it for the crime of sexual assault. 
Well, we have an editorial today that 
was published in The Hill. The headline 
is, ‘‘Military justice reform, ‘pink 
court’ and unit cohesion.’’ These were 
four military experts who wrote this 
editorial, and I will read a quote from 
it. 
President Biden, Secretary Austin and 
members of the House and Senate may be 
tempted to settle on a compromise under 
which only sex offenses would be subject to 
prosecution decision making by lawyers 
rather than non-lawyer commanders. After 
all, they may believe, it’s those offenses that 
have given rise to this entire controversy, so 
let’s just fix that. 
That may be the way the process unfolds 
from here, but it would be a mistake—and a 
tragic one, given the difficulty of getting 
Congress to focus on military justice in a 
sustained way. It would take years for the 
military justice system to recover if Con-
gress takes the wrong path at the current 
fork in the legislative road. 
It goes on to talk about two reasons 
this would be harmed. The first lies 
with the fact that there is bias in the 
system and that this bias cannot be 
eradicated by just taking out one 
crime, that it should be for all serious 
crimes. 
I will read from the text again. 
Second, even though men as well as women 
in uniform are victims of sexual assault, 
public concern has chiefly focused on the 
women. It is concern over them and their 
willingness to come forward without fear of 
retaliation that has given the reform issue 
such potency. As a practical matter, if a par-
allel system is created for the disposition of 
sex offenses, that system will be understood 
as having been created chiefly for the benefit 
of women in uniform. Congress will, in ef-
fect, have created ‘‘pink courts’’—courts for 
women. 
Creating ‘‘pink courts’’ will destroy unit 
cohesion. It is difficult to imagine a surer 
way of turning back the clock on all the 
progress our country has made in inte-
grating women in uniform, including opening 
occupational specialties, admission to the 
service academies, qualification as pilots of 
warplanes and commanders of naval ships 
and Coast Guard cutters, and promotion to 
flag and general officer ranks. 
Congress should transfer the charging 
power for all felony-level offenses by mili-
tary personnel to uniformed prosecutors 
independent of the chain of command. Lim-
iting the transfer to sex offenses makes no 
sense. 
One argument that was not included 
in here is that, if you do limit it to just 
one crime, you don’t address the issue 
of defendants’ rights. Now, with so 
much data we have available about ra-
cial biases in prosecution and convic-
tion and punishment, it is right that 
we care about both plaintiffs’ rights 
and defendants’ rights and reform the 
entire system. 
These 
unfounded 
arguments 
are 
nothing more than delay tactics. Every 
day we delay this vote, we deny justice 
to our servicemembers—the people who 
do so much for us and so much for this 
country. There is no reason to wait any 
longer. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that, at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Committee 
on Armed Services be discharged from 
the further consideration of S. 1520 and 
the Senate proceed to its consider-
ation; that there be 2 hours for debate, 
equally divided in the usual form; and 
that upon the use or yielding back of 
that time, the Senate vote on the bill 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I object. 
We look forward to having a very 
healthy and serious debate on this 
issue in the Armed Services Committee 
so that we can resolve many claims by 
both sides about the best way to deal 
with this. 
I 
think, 
through 
Senator 
GILLI-
BRAND’s great efforts, we have moved a 
long, long way in terms of addressing 
the issue of sexual assault through the 
UCMJ, but there are still significant 
issues that have to be thoughtfully dis-
cussed. In the context of that discus-
sion, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL MARTINEZ 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday, and it is that time of the 
week. I know a lot of our reporters in 
the Senate like this because it is the 
signal of kind of the end of the work-
week here. Of course, it is also a signal 
that I get to come to the floor and do 
what is one of my favorite elements 
about being a U.S. Senator: talking 
about someone who makes Alaska 
what I believe to be the greatest State 
in the country. We call this person our 
Alaskan of the Week. 
Before I get to talking about our 
Alaskan of the Week—an extraordinary 
young man named Michael Martinez— 
let me tell you a little bit about what 
is going on in Alaska right now. 
Today, in Anchorage, the Sun rose at 
4:44 a.m., and it will set tonight at 11 
p.m. It was light almost all day. Black-
out curtains are up, and 12 midnight 
Sun celebrations are abounding. It is a 
great time of the year to be in Alaska. 
You can’t believe the energy you feel. 
We were recently able to pass a 
cruise ship bill—and I appreciate the 
Presiding Officer’s doing that a couple 
of weeks ago—that enables cruise ships 
to come back to our State this sum-
mer. So we are going to have tourists 
coming, and you should, too, America. 
If you are watching on C–SPAN, come 
on up. Alaska is safe. It is beautiful. If 
it is on your bucket list, make it hap-
pen this summer. You will love it. You 
will see breathtaking scenery and some 
of the most generous, innovative peo-
ple in the country. You will not be dis-
appointed. So come on up. 
You will be in a State where 21-year- 
old Michael Martinez, our Alaskan of 
the Week, was born and raised—one of 
the many, many reasons I remain opti-
mistic about the state of our State and 
the state of our country. So let me tell 
you a little bit about Michael. 
His mother, Mary, is from the village 
of Kotlik in the Yukon-Kuskokwim 
Delta. 
She 
is 
Yupik. 
His 
father, 
Eufemio, is from Central Mexico. So 
those two met and married in Anchor-
age, and that is where Michael was 
raised. 
As I said, he is 21 years old now and 
has one more year to go before he re-
ceives his bachelor of science degree in 
chemistry from the University of Alas-
ka Anchorage—a great university. Al-
though he has been very successful so 
far in his already having won many 
awards for his research, he plans on 
going to graduate school. There is so 
much for him to study, after all, and 
his interest in science runs very deep, 
as it has since he was a young boy 
when he began winning science fairs. 
An Alaska reporter wrote a story in 
2016—so 5 years ago—already docu-
menting then young Michael’s suc-
cesses. The first award was for an ex-
periment demonstrating how weight 
and length affect the throwing distance 
of traditional hunting spears used by 
Alaska Natives. Isn’t that a cool re-
search topic? In eighth grade, he won 
an award for designing a robot. 
Eventually, he moved on to bigger 
and better things, like, at the tender 
age of 16, trying to find a cure for can-
cer and getting mentorship from his 
high school teachers at Service High 
School in Anchorage and, very impor-
tantly, in the Alaska Native Science 
and Engineering Program—what we 
call ANSEP—in Alaska. He won the 
Emperor Science Award, which is a 
prestigious science research award of-
fered through PBS Learning Media and 
Stand Up to Cancer. 
Michael worked with his mentor, Dr. 
Holly Martinson, Ph.D., from the Uni-
versity of Alaska Anchorage, to make 
a database for Alaska Natives suffering 
from cancer. It was his introduction to 
the world of research, and he fell in 
love with it. He entered ANSEP. 
Let me talk to you a little bit about 
ANSEP. It is a program that attracts 
young Alaska Native students from all 
over Alaska and provides extraordinary 
educational opportunities for them in 
science, in the STEM fields. ANSEP 
students have been enormously suc-
cessful and have gone on to do incred-
ible, incredible things. I can’t say 
enough about this tremendous pro-
gram. 
Eventually, Michael was introduced 
to another mentor, Dr. Brandon Briggs, 
a professor of biological sciences and 
the director of the Advanced Instru-
mentation for Microbiome Studies. It 
was his work at Dr. Briggs’ lab that led 
him to his current passion of finding 
better environmentally friendly ways 
to extract much needed, even critical, 
materials from the Earth. 
Increasingly, both here in Congress 
and across the country, we have been 
focusing on metals and minerals that 
are needed to power our future, par-
ticularly rare earth elements and crit-
ical minerals. So much of our economic 
future and our national defense de-
pends upon these minerals. The prob-
lem—although we have many of these 
minerals, rare earths included, in our 
country and particularly in Alaska—is 
that our mining industry has had in-
credibly difficult times in terms of 
being able to access them, whether it 
be with permitting delays that take 
years, with far-left environmental law-
suits that prohibit the extracting of 
them, or with the lack of production 
capacity. The result is that China, like 
it is in so many other areas, is domi-
nant, controlling up to 90 percent of 
some of these critical minerals. 
Like many of the challenges we face 
and confront with China, we need the 
best minds in America working on 
these things. Our young minds hold the 
promise of our future. 
That is one of the reasons we re-
cently passed a bill right here in the 
Senate this week to fund research in-
stitutions, so that we can unleash this 
talent and creativity. 
This is where our Alaskan of the 
Week, Michael, comes in. It was re-
cently announced that Michael won 
first place in the High North Young 
Entrepreneur Award at the High North 
Dialogue, an international pitch com-
petition for Arctic-related business 
ideas. Here is what he won it for: form-
ing a company with his adviser-men-
tor, Dr. Briggs, called Arctic Biotech 
Oath, which is working on sustainably 
extracting rare-earth elements, as I 
said, which are in abundance in Alaska. 
How does this work? What is the 
science and chemistry that he is al-
ready working on? In a lab, they are 
using microorganisms, fungi, which dig 
into the ore, breaking it up, and releas-
ing the rare-earth element into a solu-
tion, which is a more natural and sus-
tainable process to extract these rare- 
earth elements. 
This process is still in research and 
development, but it has incredible po-
tential for our Nation and for our 
State, and he has founded a company 
that is doing this, and Michael is just 
21 years old. Michael could be any-
where doing this, but he is staying in 
Alaska because Alaska is home, and he 
is committed to contributing to our 
State. 
That is why I’m still here. And that’s why 
the company will be here and will be based in 
Alaska. I was born and raised here. I am try-
ing to improve our State and see Alaska soar 
and thrive within the next couple of decades. 
I want to see a green energy sector evolve in 
Alaska. 
So that is Michael. He wants to be 
part of this, and he is part of this at 
the tender age of 21. 
So to Michael, thanks for all your 
hard work. 
By the way, thanks to all the men-
tors in Michael’s life and ANSEP and 
UAA, which have helped him along the 
way. 
Good luck in your endeavors, and 
congratulations, Michael, for being our 
Alaskan of the Week. 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. President, since this administra-
tion—the Biden administration—came 
into office, I and a number of Senators,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4034 
June 10, 2021 
Democrats and Republicans, have been 
trying to work with them on a number 
of important foreign policy issues, par-
ticularly as it relates to China. 
The President is now in Europe, and 
a couple days ago, he wrote an op-ed in 
the Washington Post where he stated 
that the United States must lead the 
world from positions of strength. 
By the way, his National Security 
Advisor, Jake Sullivan, also has made 
this argument. It is actually a really 
good argument, that the United States 
needs to lead the world, particularly 
competition with countries like Russia 
and China, from positions of strength. I 
couldn’t agree with that more. 
But let me just talk about two areas 
where we have strength relative to any 
other country in the world and where 
this administration is not reinforcing 
that but is undermining it. And I real-
ly, really hope they change. Let me 
begin with the obvious one in terms of 
our foreign relations and national secu-
rity—the U.S. military. 
We have a position of strength; there 
is no doubt about it. We have the finest 
fighting force in the world, maybe in 
the history of the world. We need to 
continue to lead with strength and 
value the men and women who raise 
their right hand and volunteer for this 
incredible fighting force, not with 
words but, most important, with ac-
tions and with funding. 
Here is where this administration is 
clearly missing the mark. This is a 
breakdown of the Biden administra-
tion’s blowout $6 trillion budget. As 
you can see, it lays out priorities, and 
I think we can all agree that if you 
look at this chart, the military and na-
tional defense are simply not prior-
ities. To the contrary, they are dead 
last in terms of this administration’s 
priorities. 
Look at this. Every Agency you can 
imagine—Commerce, HHS, EPA, Inte-
rior—there are double-digit—20 percent 
or more—increases in their budget. 
Where are the two national security 
Agencies in the Biden administration’s 
priorities? They are down here. Actu-
ally, we see a 2-percent increase in De-
fense, a 0.2-percent increase in Home-
land Security, but inflation is now esti-
mated at 4.2 percent, so the numbers 
here are actually declines—inflation- 
adjusted decreases in the Department 
of Defense’s budget and Homeland Se-
curity’s budget. Dead last. 
We had an Armed Services hearing 
today with the Secretary of Defense 
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs— 
two gentlemen I have a lot of respect 
for. They have a tough job because 
they had to come up to the Hill and 
pitch this budget, when I believe they 
didn’t agree with that budget. I don’t 
think Secretary Austin and General 
Milley want to cut defense spending, 
but guess what—that is what they had 
to pitch today. 
In the hearing, I asked them this 
question. Budgets are a reflection of an 
administration’s priority. If you look 
at this chart, it is clear that the Biden 
administration 
prioritizes 
defense 
spending in our military and our na-
tional security last—dead last. So my 
question to them was, how can you tell 
our troops that we are prioritizing 
their mission, defending America, when 
it is clear, again, from this document 
and from the Biden administration’s 
budget that it is dead last? To be re-
spectful to General Milley and Sec-
retary Austin, they didn’t have a very 
good answer because there is no good 
answer. There is no good answer. 
But we know that one country is 
prioritizing their defense spending. 
I also showed General Milley and 
Secretary 
Austin 
this 
chart. 
This 
chart, if you look at it, is where the 
U.S. annual change in defense spending 
is—that is the blue—and where the 
Communist Party of China’s annual de-
fense spending is. That is the red. 
Again, if you take a look, these big 
declines here, that is the second term 
of the Obama administration, where 
they cut defense spending in the United 
States by 25 percent. Not good. Not 
good for our troops. The increases here 
are when the Republicans had control 
of the U.S. Senate during the Trump 
administration era, when we were in-
creasing our defense spending and in-
creasing readiness. And now we are 
starting to go back to the previous 
Biden-Obama era of cutting defense 
spending. What have the Chinese been 
doing? Every year, at least 6 percent 
and sometimes 12, 13 percent. 
Again, this is not being from a posi-
tion of strength for the United States, 
as the President of the United States 
says we must. 
Let me just make one final point in 
another area in terms of a position of 
strength. One of the other areas of our 
country’s strength right now—and no-
body disagrees with it—is in the area of 
energy. In the last 10 years, we have 
had an energy renaissance in our coun-
try, turning us into a true global super-
power of energy: Largest producer of 
natural gas in the world; bigger than 
Russia. Largest producer of oil in the 
world; bigger than Saudi Arabia. Larg-
est producer of renewables in the 
world. All of the above. 
Our country has been trying to get to 
this point where we are the world’s en-
ergy superpower—again, we were in 
this position during World War II—for 
the last several decades, and this has 
always been a bipartisan endeavor. 
Jimmy Carter wanted energy independ-
ence, and so did every other President 
before and after him, and we are there. 
But we are on the cusp of seeing this 
enormous strategic advantage to our 
Nation, to working families, to our en-
vironment, disappear. Why? Because 
the Biden administration is restricting 
energy production in America, is hav-
ing senior officials like John Kerry and 
Gina McCarthy go to Wall Street and 
tell our Wall Street executives: Don’t 
invest in the energy sector, and they 
are stopping the permitting of pipe-
lines where we need to move our en-
ergy. In fact, the President is fine with 
killing the Keystone Pipeline and the 
10,000 jobs that go with it but is ap-
proving the Russian Nord Stream Pipe-
line. That is a gift to President Putin. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
Wall Street Journal editorial today en-
titled ‘‘America’s Energy Gift to Dic-
tators.’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Wall Street Journal] 
AMERICA’S ENERGY GIFT TO DICTATORS 
(By The Editorial Board) 
China, Russia and Iran will exploit the US. 
retreat on fossil fuels: 
The U.S. is barreling toward one of the 
greatest self-inflicted wounds in its history. 
This came into sharper focus last week when 
President Biden suspended oil leases in Alas-
ka’s 
Arctic 
National 
Wildlife 
Refuge 
(ANWR), even as Russia and the Organiza-
tion of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) announced production increases. 
Mr. Biden’s anti-carbon fusillade will have 
no effect on the climate as global demand for 
fossil fuel will continue to increase for dec-
ades no matter what the U.S. does. Mean-
time, Russia, China and Iran will take ad-
vantage of America’s astonishing fossil-fuel 
retreat. 
Not long ago, the U.S. depended on OPEC 
for much of its oil supply. But hydraulic 
fracturing and horizontal drilling enabled 
producers to extract oil and natural gas once 
believed unrecoverable. Shale frackers from 
North Dakota to Texas unleashed a surge of 
oil and gas onto global markets, breaking 
OPEC’s dominance on supply. OPEC tried to 
break U.S. producers by flooding markets, 
but frackers became more efficient. By 2019 
the U.S. was producing nearly two-and-a-half 
times as much crude as in 2008. OPEC and 
Russia have had to limit their production to 
lift prices to shore up budgets that depend on 
petrodollars. 
U.S. producers reduced investment during 
the pandemic as demand plunged. While 
prices have since recovered to a two-year 
high, a larger U.S. retrenchment driven by 
government and progessive investors is on 
the way. 
Two weeks ago the hedge fund Engine No. 
1 allied with big asset managers, government 
pension fund and proxy advisers ousted three 
Exxon Mobil board members in a climate 
proxy battle. Shareholders also passed a res-
olution requiring Chevron to reduce its 
downstream emissions. The latter is a de 
facto mandate to withdraw from oil and gas. 
America’s big banks have red-lined U.S. 
coal companies and refused to finance oil 
projects in ANWR, which the 2017 GOP tax 
reform opened up to development. Now the 
Biden Administration is trying to wall off 
the Arctic again as it launches a regulatory 
assault on fossil fuels—from tighter emission 
rules to endangered-species protections. 
The anti-carbon left says the U.S. must 
banish fossil fuels to meet the Paris goal of 
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius relative to pre-industrial temperatures. 
This is incompatible with a worldwide popu-
lation that is expected to grow by two billion 
by 2050. It would require an enormous reor-
ganization of the global economy that would 
keep billions in poverty. 
Electric vehicles would have to make up 
60% of worldwide car sales by 2030, according 
to a recent International Energy Agency re-
port. ‘‘You have 800 million people who do 
not have access to electricity. You can’t say 
that they have to go to net zero [carbon]. 
They have to develop,’’ Indian Minister of

New and Renewable Energy Raj Kumar 
Singh said in March. 
Unless there is some technology break-
through, demand for fossil fuels will con-
tinue to grow for decades. And Russia and 
China will take advantage of U.S. energy dis-
armament. Russian oil giant Rosneft warned 
last fall that retrenchment by U.S. and Eu-
ropean companies would result in higher 
prices and shortages. ‘‘Someone will need to 
step in,’’ Rosneft senior executive Didier 
Casimiro said. 
In November Rosneft announced a $170 bil-
lion oil and gas project in Russia’s north, 
which it claims can supply the entire world’s 
oil demand for a year. It says the project will 
become the world’s largest liquefied natural 
gas producer by 2030. Russia is also laying 
down thousands of miles of oil and gas pipe-
lines to supply Europe and Asia. 
Vladimir Putin is gloating that Russia’s 
Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany will 
soon be finished, as Mr. Biden has refused to 
sanction Russian companies running the 
project. But he didn’t care about upsetting 
Canada when he killed the Keystone XL 
pipeline. Nor Alaskans when he suspended 
the ANWR leases. Mr. Biden wants to curtail 
North American energy development while 
he stands by as Russia uses its natural re-
sources for strategic gain. 
That includes coal, by the way. Russia is 
spending more than $10 billion on railroad 
upgrades to boost its coal exports. According 
to a new report by the Global Energy Mon-
itor, coal producers—in Australia, China, 
India, Russia and South Africa—are planning 
mining projects that would increase global 
output by 30%. China has 112 coal mines 
under construction. It is also developing 
shale. 
Progressives want to surrender one of 
America’s major strategic economic advan-
tages in the name of saving the climate. But 
banishing fossil fuels in the U.S. won’t elimi-
nate carbon emissions, which will be pro-
duced somewhere else. So will the jobs, eco-
nomic growth and geopolitical leverage. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, here 
is how this excellent editorial begins: 
The U.S. is barreling toward one of the 
greatest self-inflicted wounds in our coun-
try’s history. 
I could not agree more. 
The editorial goes on to list the dif-
ferent actions that I just mentioned— 
restricting energy production in Amer-
ica, including in Alaska, with ANWR, 
restricting 
pipelines, 
encouraging 
defunding of the energy sector. It is 
not good for the country. 
The editorial also notes that this will 
have no impact on global greenhouse 
gas emissions. None. None. It is virtue 
signaling at the expense of working 
families, working Americans, and our 
national security. 
Right now, we are beginning to im-
port more oil from Russia than we ever 
have. How does that make any sense? 
How does that help a working family in 
Alaska or Maryland or anywhere? It 
doesn’t. It does one thing: It empowers 
countries like Russia and Putin and 
Saudi Arabia at the expense of the 
United States. This is a fact. Yet, 
every day you hear a new action. You 
read a new quote from someone in this 
administration focused on killing the 
energy sector of the United States. 
Again, as the Wall Street Journal just 
mentioned, this will be recognized in 
history as one of the greatest self-in-
flicted wounds, with no upside. No up-
side. 
We have the highest environmental 
standards in the world in Alaska when 
we produce oil. Highest in the world. 
Russians have the lowest, and yet we 
are now preferring Russian oil over 
American oil. 
Can anyone tell me how this makes 
sense? It doesn’t. 
Here is how the editorial concludes: 
Progressives want to surrender one of 
America’s [most] strategic economic advan-
tages in the name of [so-called] saving the 
climate. But banishing fossil fuels in the 
[United States] won’t eliminate carbon emis-
sions, which will [just] be produced [else-
where]. So will . . . jobs [and] economic 
growth and [the] geopolitical [advantage 
that comes with our energy dominance]. 
Let me conclude by saying this. As I 
mentioned, I agree with President 
Biden and National Security Advisor 
Jake Sullivan. We need to address 
challenges, particularly with our ad-
versaries like China and Russia, from 
positions of strength. Two of the most 
prominent positions of strength—the 
U.S. military and our energy domi-
nance—right now are being undermined 
by this very administration. 
They need to change course, and if 
they do, we will support their actions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana is recognized. 
COVID–19 VACCINES 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to say thank you. I rise today to 
say thank you to President Biden and 
Secretary of State Blinken. They have 
both announced today, though it had 
been rumored for several days, that the 
United States of America is about to 
make available 500 million doses of the 
coronavirus vaccine to our friends and 
neighbors across the world. And I hope 
the President and the Secretary are 
willing to offer even more, if necessary. 
We have learned a lot about the virus 
and the disease that it causes. I will 
mention three things. No. 1, we have 
learned that the virus came from 
China; No. 2, we have learned that the 
best vaccines for the virus came from 
the United States of America; and No. 
3, we have learned that the pandemic is 
not over. 
Yes, things are better in the United 
States. And we are so blessed in that 
regard, and I am so thankful. That is a 
combination of Americans receiving 
the vaccine; it is a combination of 
Americans being careful in their be-
havior. Our coronavirus rates are a 
combination of people who contracted 
the disease and therefore have the anti-
bodies, and that is why our numbers 
are going down, and we are also thank-
ful for that. 
But that is not the situation in other 
parts of the world. If you go to South 
America, if you go to Central America, 
if you ask anyone—if you ask Sub-Sa-
haran Africa about how things are 
going in terms of the pandemic, it is 
alive and well and raging. And our 
friends and neighbors need the help, 
and I am grateful today that President 
Biden and Secretary of State Blinken 
are going to make that help available. 
For a couple of reasons, it makes 
sense to show the world what U.S. lead-
ership really means. No. 1, it is the 
right thing to do. It is the moral thing 
to do. We developed a vaccine. We need 
to share it. That doesn’t mean that we 
have to require pharmaceutical compa-
nies to share their patented and pro-
tected information. I think that is a 
real mistake. We can accomplish ev-
erything through licensing agreements. 
But we do need to share. 
No. 2, this makes sense in terms of 
our national security. It is not the 
most important reason to do this but 
in terms of national security and the 
rest of our neighbors throughout the 
world understanding that the Amer-
ican people are generous and that we 
help other folks when they are down. 
No. 3, it makes sense for the Presi-
dent and the Secretary to do this in 
terms of geopolitical terms. China is 
trying to do the same thing that we are 
going to do in terms of making vac-
cines available throughout the world. 
And I thank China for that, and I 
thank the Chinese people. The Chinese 
people are wonderful people. Their 
leadership, not so much. 
The Chinese people—let me say it 
again—the people of China are wonder-
ful. The leadership of the Communist 
Party of China is a bunch of pirates. 
But I am thankful they are willing to 
make vaccines available. The problem 
is, they are making their own vaccine 
available, which is inferior to the 
American vaccine, and, No. 2, in many 
cases, 
their 
vaccine 
diplomacy— 
‘‘their’’ meaning, of course, the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s vaccine diplo-
macy—is tied to conditions. 
Yes, says the Chinese Communist 
Party, we will share our vaccine with 
you if you will help us take over Tai-
wan. Yes, we will share our vaccine 
with you, say members of the Com-
munist Party of China, if you will join 
with us in saying that the Communist 
Party of China is doing nothing wrong 
in hiding the origin of the coronavirus. 
That is not what we are doing. 
Our gift, as Americans, to the rest of 
the world is unconditional. It is firm. 
It is categorical. It is the moral thing 
to do. It is the smart thing to do, in 
terms of our own national security. We 
can’t completely recover until the 
world recovers. And No. 3, it makes 
perfect sense, in my judgment, in ex-
plaining to the rest of the world the 
difference between communism and the 
free enterprise system and the hearts 
that lie behind both of those systems. 
It is also, and I will close on this 
point—it is necessary. There are very 
few countries in the world—we are 
blessed to be one of them—that have 
the ability to manufacture, to store, 
and to distribute the vaccine. Yes, it is 
wonderful to talk about, well, we are 
going to help other countries with 
their—let’s say, their manufacturing 
needs. We should do that, but we don’t

have enough time. We just don’t have 
enough time because in the developing 
world, when time is of the essence, 
they just don’t have the ability that we 
have to manufacture a vaccine, which 
is only part of it; to store that vaccine, 
and these vaccines require very careful 
protocol in terms of storage; and No. 3, 
to distribute it. We can do all three, 
and President Biden, over the last sev-
eral days, along with Secretary of 
State Blinken, said we are about to 
show the world what American leader-
ship looks like. We are going to share 
our innovation and our vaccines with 
our world’s neighbors, and there are no 
strings attached. And we are doing it 
because it is the right thing to do. 
I think all Members of this Congress 
should join with the President and 
should join with the Secretary of State 
in this effort. If they need the re-
sources, I think we should provide 
them, and let’s all get back on our feet 
together as a world. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to give an up-
date on what is happening on our 
southwest border. It seems a lot of the 
national media has stopped focusing on 
that area. 
I talked to the people in Oklahoma 
and asked: What is going on on the 
southwest border? What has changed? 
Interestingly enough, just 2 days ago, 
President Biden and his team released 
what is the current status of what they 
call the ‘‘border challenge.’’ They 
talked about it, and here is the update. 
This comes from the White House 
itself, their update. They stated this: 
There is improved processing of unac-
companied children. The administra-
tion successfully reduced the number 
of unaccompanied children in Customs 
and Border Protection custody. 
The second thing they list is that the 
administration has reduced the average 
amount of time children are in Cus-
toms and Border Protection facilities. 
The third thing they list is that the 
administration has reduced the number 
of unaccompanied children in the care 
of Health and Human Services. 
Then they move on and say that they 
removed barriers to unifying children 
with parents and sponsors in the 
United States. And they go through 
and give the details of how much better 
they are at unifying parents and chil-
dren here in the United States. 
Interestingly enough, when you read 
through this and just look at the lan-
guage, you think, gosh, the numbers 
are going significantly down—until you 
slow down and ask the question. What 
they are really saying in this report is: 
We are moving people across the border 
faster than we used to. They don’t 
spend as much time at the border as 
they used to. They are now in the inte-
rior of the country. 
Why do I say that? Because the infor-
mation came out, strikingly enough, 
the day after this was released, the up-
date of what was happening on the bor-
der in May. 
In March of this year, with the high-
est number of interdictions that we 
have had in 20 years—in March of this 
year—173,000-plus; only to be beaten in 
April by the highest in 20 years with 
178,000-plus; only to be beaten, now we 
know, in May with 180,000-plus. The 
surge continues to accelerate while the 
administration puts out their notice 
saying: We are getting so much more 
efficient at moving people from the 
border into the interior of the country. 
This is why President Giammattei of 
Guatemala spoke to the administration 
this week in a public setting, strik-
ingly enough, saying: You are giving 
mixed signals to the people of Central 
America. For the Vice President to 
come to Guatemala and say ‘‘Don’t 
come; don’t come’’ but then for the ad-
ministration to say ‘‘But if you do 
come, we are a lot faster getting you 
into the country than we used to be,’’ 
this is the mixed-signal problem. It is 
why coyotes continue to be able to 
move record numbers of people through 
Central America into the interior of 
the country. 
It is not just from Central America. 
We have had this year a more than 400 
percent increase in migration from na-
tions outside of the Northern Triangle 
in Mexico because the coyotes are 
learning—we know how to move peo-
ple, and the world is seeing that if you 
want to be able to come to America il-
legally, now is the time to do it. 
So if you go back to March, we had 
all these individuals who were coming 
from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Sal-
vador. Now there is a 400-percent in-
crease of people from outside of those 
areas who are coming into those same 
trafficking networks moving into the 
United States. 
We have now had this year 23,000, 
that we know of, individuals who, when 
they were brought across the border 
under the new Biden proposal to be 
more efficient at moving people across 
the border, that if the line was too long 
to be processed at the border, they 
would be released into the United 
States and told: Whatever city you go 
to, turn yourself in to ICE and start 
what is called a notice to appear proc-
ess to be able to request asylum, lit-
erally. This has never happened under 
any administration. No administration 
has done this. If the line is too long at 
the border when you are crossing ille-
gally and it backs up there to be able 
to check in with the Border Patrol or 
CBP, then they are released into the 
country. As we know of, by the end of 
March—we don’t know the numbers yet 
for April and May, but by the end of 
March, 23,242 people had been just re-
leased and told ‘‘Turn yourself in, 
whatever city you get to.’’ 
Now, I have asked the question: How 
many people have actually turned 
themselves in? How many people have 
actually done that? The latest number 
that 
we 
have 
that 
have 
actually 
checked in is about 1,800 people. Quite 
frankly, I was surprised it was that 
high. That is almost 8 percent of the 
people who have actually turned them-
selves in when they arrived at the city, 
meaning 92 percent of the people who 
were released at the border, we have no 
idea where they are anywhere in the 
country—92 percent. This is not what 
Americans expected. 
Worse still, I have asked the basic 
question: What is happening with ICE? 
Why should I ask that question about 
interior enforcement in the United 
States? Because the first week Presi-
dent Biden was in office, he announced 
a moratorium on any deportations, 
even deportations that a Federal court 
has ordered removed. He was going to 
do no deportations at all. He was going 
to stop for 100 days. 
A Federal court actually interceded 
in that and responded: If a Federal 
court has ordered what is called a final 
order of removal, they have to be re-
moved. The Biden administration re-
sponded with: OK, we will do that. We 
will remove people if there is a final 
order of removal. 
So I asked the simple question: What 
has happened since then? Here is what 
has happened since then. The Biden ad-
ministration has changed the policy for 
ICE into a policy we have never done as 
a country. If an individual is going to 
be removed by ICE now, they have to 
contact regional leadership and ask 
permission to be able to remove that 
person. Regional leadership will go 
through a whole set of the criteria es-
tablished by the Biden administration, 
and if they don’t qualify, they cannot 
be removed regardless of their status. 
What has happened since then? Last 
month, there were only 3,000 people in 
the country removed—3,000. That is the 
lowest number we have had on our 
records. To give you an example of 
this, we have 6,000 ICE agents in the 
country yet only 3,000 deportations in 
the country in a month. We are on 
record to be at a number we have never 
experienced before as a country for de-
portations of any President because we 
are not enforcing the law. 
Not only do we have record numbers 
coming across the border, we have a 
record low number of deportations that 
are happening. What do I mean by 
that? Well, we contacted the ICE Coun-
cil, and we asked specifically: What 
does it mean when we learn that people 
are not being deported? Who is not 
being deported? 
When I talked to ICE leadership 2 
weeks ago, I asked very direct, specific 
questions: Are all criminal aliens being 
deported? Their answer back to me 
was, no, we are making a case-by-case 
decision on criminal aliens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4037 
June 10, 2021 
My next question: Are all sex offend-
ers being deported? The answer was, 
no, we are making a case-by-case deci-
sion on sex offenders on whether they 
should be deported. 
Let me give a few examples. These 
are direct examples that come from the 
ICE Council of things that have hap-
pened in the last month under the new 
Biden policy to not deport individuals. 
First option. This person was in local 
custody pending charges for aggravated 
assault. The detainer was carried over 
from the previous administration, from 
the Trump administration. Once the 
Biden administration took leadership, 
the ICE detainer was removed. They 
ordered a reevaluation of the case and 
said that they have to be actually con-
victed of aggravated assault charges 
before you can put a detainer. Now, a 
detainer doesn’t actually remove them. 
That is just a detainer to say: Don’t re-
lease them if convicted. That detainer 
was removed. 
Case No. 2. This person had been de-
ported four times before—four times 
before. They have had convictions for 
evading arrest, domestic violence, and 
multiple DUIs. They also have a pend-
ing DUI charge right now again. ICE 
officers requested permission to place a 
detainer on this person, and they were 
instructed that they could not put a 
detainer on this person. Even though 
they had been deported four times—do-
mestic violence conviction in the past, 
evading arrest in the past, and mul-
tiple DUIs—they were told they could 
not put a detainer on him. 
Case No. 3. This is actually an ICE 
fugitive who has a court-ordered final 
order of removal. Remember, I men-
tioned earlier that a Federal court said 
you do have to deport these individ-
uals? Well, guess what. That is actu-
ally not occurring. ICE officials made a 
request for someone who had an aggra-
vated assault, and they were told that 
they could not do it unless they went 
through a lengthy, long process. They 
started through the process, and by the 
time all the paperwork was done, that 
person had already bonded out, and 
they are gone. They are at large. 
Case No. 4. This individual had ille-
gally entered the country. They had 
local charges for rape of a child. ICE 
officers were prohibited from placing a 
detainer on them, saying that they 
hadn’t been convicted yet, so they 
couldn’t even put a detainer pending 
their conviction to remove them. 
Case No. 5. This person had already 
been deported before, had a conviction 
for a sex offense against a child and 
sexual battery. ICE officers requested 
permission to make an arrest on this 
individual, but ICE management de-
nied the request based on the new 
Biden priorities. That person is on the 
street right now. 
Case No. 6. This person has been de-
ported twice already. There are pend-
ing charges right now. Although they 
had been deported before, they have 
pending charges on them right now for 
distribution of heroin, aggravated as-
sault, endangerment of a child, and 
failure to stop or to respond to a com-
mand of police. 
Here is what happened. A criminal 
informant advised police that this indi-
vidual had arranged to sell him a quar-
ter-pound of heroin. By the way, that is 
a lot. When the subject appeared at the 
designated location, the police at-
tempted to arrest this individual, but 
instead the person, illegally present in 
the country, attempted to ram the po-
lice with his car. He almost hit a police 
officer who was standing outside of his 
vehicle. The person was arrested. The 
subject did have a quarter-pound of 
heroin in their possession. They admit-
ted also to selling heroin just moments 
before, and they had a child and an 
adult in the back seat of the car during 
the heroin sale and when that person 
had rammed the police vehicle. ICE of-
ficers requested permission to place an 
ICE detainer on this individual, and 
ICE management denied that request— 
denied that request. Though they had 
been deported twice, though they had 
attempted to ram a police officer’s ve-
hicle, though they were currently in 
the act of selling a quarter pound of 
heroin, they said: 
Police work is inherently dangerous. Offi-
cers know the risk. No detainer is warranted. 
What are we doing? Three thousand 
people have been deported in our coun-
try in a month, and individuals lit-
erally selling heroin and attacking our 
police officers, ICE is not allowed to 
deport. Individuals in this country who 
are currently pending charges of sexual 
abuse of a child are not being deported, 
not even a detainer to be able to hold 
them. 
Is this what America wanted? It is 
certainly not what the people of Okla-
homa want. It certainly does not 
strengthen the morale of our ICE 
agents who currently cannot make an 
arrest or our Border Patrol and our 
Customs and Border Protection indi-
viduals who function more like hotel 
check-in staff at our border than they 
are law enforcement. 
This is not creating a stable environ-
ment in America. It is unstable. This 
has got to stop. 
This is not a radical request of the 
administration; it is a simple state-
ment: Follow the law. 
Article II of the Constitution, the 
President of the United States is the 
individual who is given the responsi-
bility to enforce the law of the United 
States. The law is clear in all of these 
areas, and he can’t just say: I have 
prosecutorial discretion. I am not 
going to deport sex offenders and peo-
ple who try to ram their car into police 
officers and people with multiple DUIs. 
What in the world? 
These are not possible cases. These 
are recent cases that are real cases 
happening in the country right now. 
And it is why our ICE agents are so in-
credibly frustrated because they want 
to enforce the law and protect our 
country. They have kids as well, and 
they don’t want someone with multiple 
DUIs driving on the street. 
This needs to be addressed by this ad-
ministration—and stop just making 
brief statements in Guatemala, saying 
don’t come but having doublespeak 
here at the border, saying but if you 
do, we will move you through quickly. 
And if you get into the country, we 
will not deport you, even for sexual 
battery. 
Now, in the ‘‘haven’t I seen this 
movie before’’ category, I noticed a 
couple other things this week that 
came up. There is a new leaked docu-
ment that came out that was released 
by the press of tax documents that had 
been leaked out of the IRS that some-
how miraculously got to individuals in 
the press who ran an extensive story 
about tax documents. 
Now, we can all have our different 
perspectives on how people pay taxes 
and how much taxes they pay, but one 
thing should be clear for every person 
in this body; it is against the law to re-
lease tax documents. It is against the 
law to do that. But somehow, mysteri-
ously, tax documents started getting 
released in the last couple of weeks. 
This reminds me so much of a few 
years 
ago, 
when 
the 
IRS 
was 
weaponized for political purposes and 
Lois Lerner was actively shutting 
down conservative nonprofits, getting 
access to nonprofit status, but left- 
leaning 
nonprofits 
were 
expedited 
through. And we all expressed our frus-
tration that the IRS was being politi-
cized. The IRS, of all places that have 
all documents, should not be politi-
cized. And now, suddenly, at the begin-
ning of this administration, just as we 
saw in the Obama-Biden administra-
tion, now we see in the Biden-Harris 
administration the politicization of the 
IRS again. 
Interestingly enough, in the Presi-
dent’s budget that he released this 
week, he wants to give an additional 
authority to the IRS that has not been 
talked about much. He wants every 
bank transaction in America—credit 
union or bank—of $600 or more to be 
sent to the IRS. So the IRS would 
have—every time you go to your bank 
or credit union, deposit or withdraw 
$600 or more, that transaction and all 
the details of it would have to be sent 
to the IRS not by you but by the bank 
or the credit union. 
When I asked the IRS Commissioner 
about that earlier this week in my con-
versation with him, he said they lit-
erally do not have the capacity to han-
dle that much information. They don’t 
have the technology to do it. They 
don’t have the manpower to do it. 
But the Biden administration wants 
every bank transaction that you do of 
$600 or more of any type to be able to 
go to the IRS and to be kept there. In-
terestingly, that proposal comes out 
the same week that information comes 
out that the IRS is now suddenly leak-
ing tax information to the press. I have 
seen that movie before. 
I have seen the movie before on the 
Keystone Pipeline. That was news 
again this week. We saw that during

June 10, 2021 
the Obama-Biden administration as 
well, and now we are seeing it in the 
Biden-Harris administration; that sud-
denly pipelines are bad news. 
Well, when the Colonial Pipeline 
went down a couple of days, the whole 
East Coast panicked because they 
couldn’t get fuel when one pipeline 
went down. We shouldn’t be talking 
about how to not build pipelines; we 
should be talking about how to build 
pipeline redundancy to make sure that 
if a pipeline goes down, we are not 
trapped, as Americans, with no fuel in 
the situation that we are in right now. 
But in the middle of this, to be able 
to please the environmental left, the 
President of the United States shut 
down the Keystone Pipeline, and the 
company finally gave up and said: We 
are not going to invest any more 
money on something that we can’t fin-
ish. 
Now, will that change America’s use 
of oil by one drop? No, it won’t. Amer-
ica will use the exact same amount of 
oil that it used before. But what it will 
do is make it more expensive to be able 
to move oil from the northern part of 
the United States to the southern part 
of the United States to raise prices on 
all consumers. 
We will still have a use of oil; it will 
just raise prices. And the oil that 
moves will now move on a train or on 
a truck, which uses more carbon, which 
is more dangerous than using a pipe-
line. I have seen this movie before. 
In the middle of canceling out the 
Keystone Pipeline, the President lifted 
sanctions on a Russian pipeline, the 
Nord Stream 2, which will cut off the 
United States from selling natural gas 
to Western Europe because that was 
Western Europe’s alternative. They can 
either buy natural gas from us or buy 
gas from Russia. 
The Trump administration had put 
sanctions on that pipeline, and so the 
pipeline 
had 
stopped 
construction. 
President Biden lifted sanctions on 
that so now we won’t sell American 
natural gas; now Western Europe will 
be dependent on Russian natural gas. 
How does that help the stability of 
Europe? How does that help American 
jobs? How does that help our future? I 
have no idea. 
In the ‘‘I have seen this movie be-
fore,’’ I was fascinated this week to be 
able to see President Zelensky of 
Ukraine, when he found out about this 
pipeline shift, which, by the way, dra-
matically affects Ukraine, when he 
read about it in the press because the 
State Department and the administra-
tion didn’t notify him that the pipeline 
that skips Ukraine and cuts them off, 
our administration—the Biden admin-
istration—approved. 
President Zelensky stated to the 
press he has reached out over and over 
to President Biden to get a meeting 
with him and can’t get a meeting with 
him. 
When I read that, I had to laugh. I 
sat in this seat during an impeachment 
proceeding on President Trump be-
cause he wouldn’t give a meeting to 
President 
Zelensky. 
President 
Zelensky is screaming in the media: I 
am trying to get ahold of President 
Biden, and he won’t meet with me, and 
he is benefiting Russia and cutting off 
Ukraine—and everybody just yawns. 
It is quite remarkable to see the dif-
ference in how our media and how indi-
viduals treat everyone. 
And in the category of ‘‘I have never 
seen this movie before,’’ let me give 
you one. Today, I had the opportunity 
to be able to meet with our Secretary 
of HHS, Xavier Becerra. We were talk-
ing about the budget that he has pre-
sented for HHS, which is enormous. In 
fact, the President’s budget is larger 
than any budget any President has 
ever given—not even close—in the 
overspending. The deficit total in it is 
epic, almost $2 trillion in deficit just 
from the budget, not including every-
thing else this year. 
But in my conversation with Xavier 
Becerra, I asked him a simple question: 
I noticed in your budget proposal you 
have changed the term that I am not 
familiar with. You have added a term, 
and the term that you put in your 
budget is you refer to some people as a 
‘‘birthing person.’’ I said: I have to tell 
you, I don’t know that term ‘‘birthing 
person.’’ What does that mean? 
And he said: Well, I think it describes 
itself, is what he said. 
I said: What is that? Is that a mom? 
And he said: Well, yes, that describes 
itself. It describes the function. 
I thought, the function? That is a 
woman. That is a mom. That is not a 
birthing person. 
My simple question was: It sounds 
like you are trying to be politically 
correct here to be able to appease 
someone, but do you think it might 
possibly be offensive to some women 
and some moms to not be referred to as 
a woman or as a mom but to be re-
ferred to as a ‘‘birthing person’’ in-
stead? 
And he just said: I will look into it. 
Just when I think it can’t get weirder 
around this town and the terms can’t 
get stranger, that is a new one on me. 
I look forward to next May, when I 
walk down the aisle at a Hallmark 
store to look for the ‘‘Happy Birthing 
Person Day’’ card that I can send to 
my mom. What an odd statement to 
make. 
What a demeaning statement to 
make to moms, to refer to them as a 
‘‘birthing person.’’ What is wrong with 
just calling a mom a mom? It is a pret-
ty great term that Americans are most 
certainly used to. And if it is the in-
tent of Xavier Becerra to retrain Amer-
icans to stop calling their mom a mom, 
to call them a birthing person, I hope 
that he loses that one big time. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
year, our friends across the aisle paint-
ed a picture of doom and gloom of what 
governing with a Republican Senate 
minority might look like. They fore-
casted unprecedented obstruction, end-
less stonewalling, and the inability to 
get anything done. 
Now, there is nothing more popular 
than the myth that Congress is unable 
to get anything done. It is pretty pop-
ular. The press, uncritically, reports it, 
even when it is demonstrably false. But 
it is safe to say the vision painted by 
our Democratic colleagues of doom and 
gloom with a Republican Senate mi-
nority of unprecedented obstruction, 
endless stonewalling, and inability to 
get things done—well, that hadn’t 
come to pass. 
Actually, I feel like I am doing a 
Washington Post fact check. But over 
the past few months, Republicans and 
Democrats have actually worked to-
gether to make progress on a number 
of issues. 
One, I am sure the Biden administra-
tion would confirm that we have been 
able to confirm a number of nominees 
for high-ranking positions in the Fed-
eral Government with broad bipartisan 
support. 
We extended the popular Paycheck 
Protection Program that was part of 
the CARES Act, which was the major 
COVID–19 relief bill that passed over-
whelmingly last year on a bipartisan 
basis. We did that because we all recog-
nized the importance of small busi-
nesses continuing to take advantage of 
this lifeline until they could safely re-
open. 
We took action, on a bipartisan basis, 
to combat the increase in hate crimes 
against Asian Americans. We provided 
States with additional resources to up-
grade their drinking and wastewater 
infrastructure. 
And this week we passed historic leg-
islation to improve the way we counter 
the threat from the Chinese Com-
munist Party, the so-called Endless 
Frontier Act. It included a $52 billion 
emergency appropriation to make sure 
that we weren’t dependent on imports 
of semiconductors, which are so essen-
tial to our economy and to our na-
tional security. 
That is not all. The Environment and 
Public Works Committee advanced a 
bipartisan surface transportation bill. 
That is actually the second time—first 
under 
Republican 
leadership, 
now 
under Democratic leadership—that the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee has advanced a bipartisan, 
unanimously supported surface trans-
portation bill. 
The Judiciary Committee that I 
serve on unanimously has approved 
three bills to support our men and 
women in blue. And two committees, 
the Rules Committee and the Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs Committee, just released a bipar-
tisan report—127 pages long, if I am not 
mistaken—on the events surrounding 
January 6. 
You would be hard pressed to count 
the number of bipartisan bills that 
have actually been introduced in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4039 
June 10, 2021 
last few months, just in 6 months of 
the Biden administration: legislation 
to bring down prescription drug prices, 
enhance cyber security, which is an in-
creasingly scary and frightening issue, 
especially with the Colonial Pipeline, 
the JBS hack, and the SolarWinds 
hack by the Russians. 
We also know we need to improve our 
electric grid infrastructure, which we 
have bills doing that. And then we also 
have even a bipartisan bill to address 
the humanitarian crisis on the south-
ern border—bipartisan, bicameral. 
These are some of the bills that I 
have introduced, and when you add to 
it the work being done by other Mem-
bers of the Senate, you have a long list 
of opportunities for us to work to-
gether on behalf of the American peo-
ple. I believe this is the type of results 
and consensus that the American peo-
ple had hoped for after the last election 
because, the truth is, neither party got 
a mandate after the last election. 
I know President Biden won the elec-
tion, but we have a 50–50 Senate, and 
Speaker PELOSI has a very slim major-
ity in the House. And we have a Presi-
dent who, I think, inspired all of us 
when he started talking about healing 
the separations in our Nation and ap-
pealing to a promise of unity. 
I can tell you one thing, that 2020 
wasn’t a mandate to pass a radical 
agenda. It was a call for us to work to-
gether. I don’t know any other way you 
can interpret a 50–50 Senate. And I be-
lieve there is no better time for us to 
get work done on behalf of our con-
stituents in the Senate. 
There is, perhaps, the apocryphal 
story of George Washington, who told 
Thomas Jefferson that the Senate was 
meant to be the saucer to cool House 
legislation, like how a saucer appar-
ently was used at the time to cool hot 
tea. There certainly is a lot of hot tea 
in the House these days, and the fili-
buster, I believe, and the 60-vote re-
quirement to cut off debate is core to 
the Senate’s ability to perform its con-
stitutional function—to cool off the de-
bate and to talk about the greater good 
and to force us to do something that 
maybe we don’t do naturally, which is 
to force us to work together. 
The Founders understood that if you 
passed legislation on a purely partisan 
basis, well, the next 2 years after the 
election, the next 4 years after a new 
President, the new majority, the new 
President, could simply undo it. And 
we have seen a lot of that, unfortu-
nately—admittedly, on both sides of 
the aisle. 
But when you have to get 60 votes in 
the Senate to pass legislation that im-
pacts the lives of 330 million Ameri-
cans, it strikes me that is a pretty 
commonsense way to force us to do, 
again, maybe what might seem unnatu-
ral to us but we have to do for the ben-
efit of the American people. It forces us 
to pass bipartisan bills and makes pass-
ing partisan bills impossible. 
Now, I know both parties. There is a 
reason why people are Democrats and a 
reason why people are Republicans. We 
have different ideas, different prior-
ities, different ways of going about 
doing things, perhaps to achieve a re-
sult that we would all agree on, a dif-
ferent means to an end. But the fact of 
the matter is, notwithstanding our 
preference, perhaps, to have our poli-
cies succeed over those of our Demo-
cratic colleagues, that is not always 
necessarily in the best interest of the 
American people. What is in the best 
interest of the American people is to 
have us work together. 
Just 4 years ago—it is amazing how 
time flies and how much people’s posi-
tions change depending on where they 
sit. Well, 4 years ago, now-Majority 
Leader Senator SCHUMER, the Senator 
from New York, said we should ‘‘build 
a firewall around the legislative fili-
buster.’’ 
Believe me, that 60-vote requirement 
looks a lot better when you are in the 
minority than it does when you are in 
the majority. As a matter of fact, when 
President Trump was in the White 
House and we had a Republican major-
ity in the Senate, I can’t tell you how 
many times he pressed on Leader 
MCCONNELL to eliminate the filibuster 
because it was an impediment to him 
getting what he wanted done. But he 
wasn’t looking at the long game or the 
long-term consequences of doing that. 
Senator MCCONNELL, on the other 
hand, having been in the Senate a long 
time, understood that short-term gain 
was not worth the long-term pain. 
But Senator SCHUMER called it the 
most important distinction between 
the House and the Senate, this con-
sensus-building mechanism known as 
the filibuster. But, today, Senator 
SCHUMER perhaps has succumbed to the 
temptation, once you are in the major-
ity, to say: Anything that gets in my 
way, any impediment to getting what I 
want, like the 60-vote requirement, we 
need to do away with it. So he has done 
a complete 180. Clearing the way for a 
radical agenda is priority No. 1. 
I understand the political pressures 
that come within our political parties, 
and it is pretty clear to me that the 
pressure on our friends in the Demo-
cratic Party is from the progressive 
left, who want to push the party far-
ther and farther to the left. But that is 
not a reason for us to give up our pre-
vious convictions or principles. 
Apparently, 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues—not all, but some of our 
Democratic 
colleagues—apparently 
have abandoned the long-held belief 
that the filibuster is a vital stabilizing 
force, and they are on the warpath to 
eliminate it. You can tell by the lan-
guage that is being used. Some have 
called the filibuster a ‘‘weapon of mass 
destruction,’’ ‘‘a death grip of democ-
racy.’’ 
And here is perhaps the most des-
picable description when, I think it 
was, President Obama himself, who 
spoke at John Lewis’s funeral, called 
the filibuster a ‘‘Jim Crow relic,’’ es-
sentially suggesting that anybody who 
supported this vital stabilizing mecha-
nism was a racist. And he gave tacit 
permission to other people to play the 
race card when it comes to the fili-
buster. 
Well, it hasn’t even been a year since 
our Democratic colleagues used this 
‘‘Jim Crow relic’’ to block an anti- 
lynching bill. This was part of the po-
lice reform bill that Senator TIM SCOTT 
led that was filibustered by our Demo-
cratic friends. 
I still remember being on the floor 
when then-Senator KAMALA HARRIS and 
CORY BOOKER, who were the chief advo-
cates for this anti-lynching provision 
in the police reform bill, were part of 
the core of Democrats who filibustered 
that bill. They filibustered their own 
anti-lynching bill. So when somebody 
wants to play the race card and say 
that this is used for improper purposes, 
their own actions demonstrate the hy-
pocrisy of that argument. 
The 
inconvenient 
truth 
for 
our 
Democratic colleagues is that they 
have filibustered bill after bill when 
they were the minority party over the 
last 6 years. But I know memories are 
short around here. The impulse to get 
something done today may cause peo-
ple to do things that they later would 
regret. We certainly have seen that in 
the George W. Bush administration 
when then-Leader Reid decided to raise 
the bar for judicial confirmations to 60 
votes for cloture and blocked a number 
of George W. Bush’s judges. 
Of course, we know how that story 
ended. Ultimately, we got back to the 
status quo ante after we went through 
years of fights, gangs meeting and 
coming up with tentative compromises. 
And then, ultimately, with the use of 
the same precedent setting or the ap-
peal of the ruling of the Chair, that 
then was used to bring the number 
back down to 51, where it had, in es-
sence, been forever, when Neil Gorsuch 
was confirmed. So it is important for 
us to remember that what goes around 
comes around here, and what might 
seem expedient today may prove to be 
pretty painful tomorrow. 
Well, we know our Democratic col-
leagues have used this so-called Jim 
Crow relic—and, again, I think that is 
completely inaccurate to use it that 
way. This is how the Senate functions. 
Our Democrats are within their rights 
when they employ the filibuster to kill 
countless pieces of legislation, whether 
it is pandemic relief, government fund-
ing, pro-life legislation, or police re-
form. The list goes on and on. 
Again, I don’t particularly like it 
when the minority filibusters legisla-
tion I would like to see passed, but 
what that means is it is an invitation 
and, really, a command to us to roll up 
our sleeves and work harder to try to 
find common ground. Really, if you 
think about it, eliminating the fili-
buster is a lazy way of legislating be-
cause it means you don’t have to do 
the hard work. You don’t have to build 
bipartisan consensus. You don’t have 
to worry about stabilizing our laws so

that they don’t change dramatically 
every 2 years or every 4 years depend-
ing on who is in charge. 
So we don’t have to wonder how our 
Democratic colleagues felt about the 
filibuster when it was of benefit to 
them because they made countless 
statements and even put their feelings 
in writing. When Republicans held con-
trol of the House and the Senate and 
the White House, our Democratic col-
leagues were afraid the filibuster would 
be eliminated. They were afraid we 
would do what we did not do but that 
which Leader SCHUMER and others are 
advocating now, which is to eliminate 
the filibuster so we could get—they 
were worried that we would eliminate 
the filibuster to get what we wanted 
rather than have to work together on a 
bipartisan basis. 
So the shoe is truly on the other foot 
now that Democrats have a nominal 
majority in a 50–50 Senate but with the 
tie-breaking vote of the Vice Presi-
dent. That is why Senator SCHUMER 
gets to be the floor leader even though 
he doesn’t command a majority of Sen-
ators. 
Back then, when Democrats were in 
the minority and they were worried 
about eliminating the filibuster, 33 of 
them—33—signed a letter insisting that 
the filibuster be preserved. Among 
them was the now Vice President, then 
Senator KAMALA HARRIS. 
Senator MCCONNELL, being an insti-
tutionalist at heart, agreed, and he 
never wavered to pressure from any-
one, even President Trump, to elimi-
nate the filibuster. But now the tables 
have turned, and so have many of our 
colleagues’ views on the filibuster. 
Instead of resisting pressure to blow 
up the rules of the Senate and perhaps 
change it forever, Leader SCHUMER has 
gladly accepted his marching orders 
from the radical left, and he is trying 
to dismantle the longstanding rules of 
the Senate, what makes it exceptional, 
as he said, different from the House— 
way back when. 
Senator SCHUMER banked on Repub-
lican obstruction to justify going nu-
clear. He is trying to set up a series of 
votes in order to justify going nuclear 
to change the Senate into the House, 
to eliminate the bipartisan command 
of that 60-vote requirement. 
So he engaged in a lot of doom-and- 
gloom forecasting to predict that Re-
publicans would willy-nilly filibuster 
Democrat legislation, but it hasn’t 
come to pass. So now he is trying to or-
chestrate a series of votes that are de-
signed to fail. And they are just that— 
designed to fail—because they don’t 
represent the kind of hard work that 
goes into building bipartisan consensus 
in the Senate. 
We kicked things off earlier this 
week with a vote on a bill that would 
exploit the cause of pay fairness to line 
the pockets of trial lawyers. 
We will soon vote on the Democratic 
Party’s attempt to seize authority 
from the States to run elections. This 
is a bill so extreme that a number of 
Democrats have said they will not vote 
for it. 
Who knows what might be next, 
whether it is packing the Supreme 
Court, making Puerto Rico or Wash-
ington, DC, a State with two Demo-
cratic Senators each, or whether they 
will try to use this to erode the con-
stitutional rights of American citizens, 
for example, under the Second Amend-
ment. But blocking these bills isn’t an 
example of Republican obstruction; it 
is a destructive act of political theater. 
Well, 
thank 
goodness 
there 
are 
enough Democrats who are opposed to 
eliminating the filibuster, apparently. 
So it appears that Democrats don’t 
have the votes to make this horribly 
miscalculated rules change. Two of our 
colleagues have made clear in their 
statement that they have the courage 
to stand up for what they believe is 
right, despite the pressure they are re-
ceiving from the far left. 
Senators MANCHIN and SINEMA have 
repeatedly said they will oppose efforts 
to eliminate the filibuster. They won’t 
accept the short-term gain for long- 
term pain. Unlike the rest of their con-
ference, their caucus, they recognize 
the inherent dangers of making this 
strictly a 51-vote majority institution. 
They seem to be following the advice of 
what then-Senator Barack Obama gave 
back in 2005 when then-Senator Obama 
said: 
If the majority chooses to end the fili-
buster . . . then the fighting and the bitter-
ness and the gridlock will only get worse. 
The American people deserve better 
than that. Chipping away at the right 
of the minority may seem expedient 
now, but Democrats would be sure to 
regret those changes one day, just as 
they now regret the day that Harry 
Reid cleared an easy path for hundreds 
of conservative Federal judges. 
In two years, Republicans could win 
the majority in either or both of the 
Chambers. In 4, a Republican could win 
the White House, as well. How would 
our Democratic colleagues feel then 
when their rights as Members of the 
minority are disparaged and ignored? 
Would our Democratic colleagues sup-
port their rule changes then? Would 
they then believe the Senate minority 
should be silenced and made irrelevant, 
as apparently some believe now? 
Well, I find it hard to believe that 
that would be the case. The thing 
about power in Washington is it is 
never permanent. Majorities and Presi-
dents change. And there is a reason 
why the rules should stay the same. If 
Democrats had the votes to eliminate 
the filibuster, our country would face a 
tidal wave of changes: defunding the 
police, election law hijacking by the 
Federal Government over the States 
and local jurisdictions, tax hikes as 
high as the mind can conceive, re-
stricted rights under the Constitution. 
You get the picture. 
But when the tide inevitably turns, 
which it will at some point, then the 
temptation would be on the part of the 
Republicans to reverse all of those 
changes. The economy, the govern-
ment, the average American family 
would be in a constant whiplash. 
The requirement to get 60 votes to 
close off debate in the Senate is de-
signed to protect our country from the 
relatively rapid changes of majorities 
and Presidents, and eliminating it 
would do serious, irreparable harm, as 
many of the quoted comments by dis-
tinguished Democrats have stated in 
the past, if not today, at least in the 
past. So I agree with what Senator 
SCHUMER said 4 years ago: We should 
build a firewall around it. 
But in the meantime, there is still a 
lot of bipartisan work being done here 
in the Senate, even under the current 
rules, without the thermonuclear de-
vice of blowing up the 60-vote cloture 
requirement known as the filibuster. 
But every day that the Democratic 
leader wastes on political theater, 
which he knows is not going to suc-
ceed, is a day we have wasted in pass-
ing bipartisan legislation that will ben-
efit all of the American people, not just 
a partisan majority. 
This is the world’s greatest delibera-
tive body. It may be one of the last 
ones in existence. I don’t know any 
other place in our country or around 
the world where Senators can come 
down to the Senate floor and express 
their views no matter how unpopular, 
no matter how politically incorrect, 
but engage in actual debate and ex-
change of views, which ultimately give 
the American people the best oppor-
tunity to make up their own minds 
about what policies they agree with 
and who they trust to protect their 
welfare. 
This is the world’s greatest delibera-
tive body. There are far more impor-
tant ways to spend our time than on 
political theater.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL TERRELL K. TILLERY 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an exceptional member 
of the Department of the Air Force. I 
would like to recognize Lt. Col. Terrell 
‘‘T’’ Tillery’s distinguished service and 
dedication to enhancing the relation-
ship between the U.S. Air Force and 
my office. 
Lieutenant Colonel Tillery has dis-
tinguished himself through his profes-
sional character and leadership by 
serving our Nation in uniform. A leader 
and expert communicator, he has pro-
vided exemplary service to our country 
while assigned to the Air Force Senate 
Liaison Office. Terrell is a career force 
support officer with experience in man-
power, personnel, and services, includ-
ing assignments as a force support 
squadron commander, recorder for the 
USAF Selection Board Secretariat, and 
a squadron section commander. He has 
served tours at the base, major com-
mand, agency, center and air staff lev-
els. He has deployed in support of Oper-
ations Willing Spirit, Iraqi Freedom, 
Enduring Freedom, and Freedom’s Sen-
tinel. It was this experience that made 
Terrell the perfect fit to serve as a leg-
islative liaison officer for the Depart-
ment of the Air Force for the past 2 
years on Capitol Hill. 
Terrell served as a legislative liaison 
officer from July 2019 to May 2021, 
skillfully 
performing 
his 
duties 
throughout. His attention to detail and 
responsiveness strengthened the capa-
bilities of my office in support of our 
special relationship with the Air Force. 
Specifically, Terrell shaped numerous 
engagements between my office and 
Air Force senior leaders. Of special 
concern to me was the related dialog 
concerning the Air Force’s future to in-
clude that of the KC–46 and B–21 air-
craft, the Next Generation Air Domi-
nance Program, and the Ground Based 
Strategic 
Deterrent. 
Additionally, 
Terrell’s direct support provided me 
and my staff with critical information 
necessary for our consideration of two 
National Defense Authorization Acts. 
After concluding this challenging as-
signment, Lieutenant Colonel Tillery 
will take command of another U.S. Air 
Force squadron, this time the 355th 
Force Support Squadron at Davis- 
Monthan Air Force Base, AZ. In clos-
ing, I express my gratitude and appre-
ciation to Lieutenant Colonel Tillery 
for his excellent support of me and my 
staff in furtherance of the Air Force 
and Space Force missions and my ap-
preciation to his supportive family, 
Mrs. Catherine Tillery, and their three 
children Tucker, Collier and Chandler 
Grace. I wish this Air Force family all 
the best in their next chapter of service 
to our Nation.

ily Wellness, PLLC, of Crestwood, KY, 
as the Senate Small Business of the 
Week. 
In 2014, Dr. Molly Rutherford and her 
husband 
Chris 
Rutherford 
founded 
Bluegrass Family Wellness, PLLC, in 
Crestwood, KY. A graduate of Virginia 
Tech, Dr. Rutherford earned an MPH in 
epidemiology from Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity and an M.D. from Eastern Vir-
ginia Medical School, specializing in 
family medicine. After 8 years of work-
ing in the healthcare sector, Dr. Ruth-
erford and her husband established 
Bluegrass Family Wellness. Through a 
direct primary care model, Bluegrass 
Family Wellness provides individual-
ized, affordable, and accessible medical 
care for Oldham County and the sur-
rounding area. 
As a medical practitioner, Dr. Ruth-
erford has been at the forefront of bat-
tling the opioid crisis in Kentucky. She 
pursued a specialty in addiction medi-
cine, ensuring that Bluegrass Family 
Wellness treated addiction with an evi-
dence-based approach balancing medi-
cation and counseling. From 2018 to 
2019, Dr. Rutherford served on the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human 
Services Pain Management Best Prac-
tices Intra-Agency Task Force, which 
produced a report highlighting the con-
nection between pain management and 
the opioid crisis. Dr. Rutherford served 
as president of the Kentucky Society of 
Addiction Medicine. She is a board 
member of the Unbridled Project, a 
nonprofit 
advocating 
for 
evidence- 
based solutions to the opioid crisis. 
Together with her husband Chris, Dr. 
Rutherford consistently gives back to 
her community. Locally, Bluegrass 
Family Wellness has sponsored several 
Little League teams, the Oldham Coun-
ty Youth Football League, and East 
Oldham Middle School. They support 
several charitable organizations, in-
cluding a scholarship for a City School-
house, a private school in Louisville, 
KY. Dr. Rutherford and her family are 
active within their local church com-
munity, as well. Notably, Dr. Ruther-
ford is a member of the Coalition for a 
Healthy Oldham County, the American 
Academy of Family Physicians, the 
American Society for Addiction Medi-
cine, the Kentucky Academy of Family 
Physicians, and the Indiana State Med-
ical Association. 
Like many local physicians, Dr. 
Rutherford and her team stepped up to 
keep their community safe and healthy 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. As the 
pandemic unfolded, Dr. Rutherford con-
tinued seeing patients in person and by 
telemedicine. She treated COVID–19 
patients at her practice and published 
a peer-reviewed article alongside sev-
eral physicians regarding early out-
patient treatment for COVID–19. Dr. 
Rutherford 
consistently 
spoke 
out 
about 
the 
negative 
effects 
of 
lockdowns, highlighting impact on in-
dividuals battling addiction. Dr. Ruth-
erford published op-eds on the harm 
school lockdowns caused children, suc-
cessfully advocating for reopening Jef-
ferson County Public Schools. 
Bluegrass Family Wellness, PLLC, is 
a remarkable example of the critical 
role that small, family-oriented med-
ical practices play in their commu-
nities. Local medical practices like 
Bluegrass Family Wellness form the 
heart of towns across Kentucky, regu-
larly stepping up to support their com-
munities in times of crisis. Congratula-
tions to Dr. Rutherford, Chris, and the 
entire 
team 
at 
Bluegrass 
Family 
Wellness. I wish them the best of luck 
and look forward to watching their 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.∑

TRIBUTE TO CHASE POUST 
∑ Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to recognize the heroic ac-
tions of 7-year-old Chase Poust, of 
Jacksonville, FL, and thank the brave 
first responders with the Jacksonville 
Fire and Rescue Department, Jackson-
ville Sheriff’s Office, and Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
whose actions saved Chase’s dad, Ste-
ven, and 4-year-old sister, Abigail. 
On May 28, 2021, Steven, Chase, and 
Abigail were boating and swimming on 
the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, 
FL, when the current pulled 4-year-old 
Abigail away, causing her to lose grip 
from the boat. Her father, Steven, 
jumped in to try to bring her back to 
safety. At the direction of his dad, 
Chase swam to get to the shore to find

help, swimming through the river for 
over an hour. 
Within that hour, Steven and Abigail 
had drifted nearly 2 miles away from 
the boat, according to Jacksonville 
Fire and Rescue Department; and other 
agencies, including the Jacksonville 
Sheriff’s Office and the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission, 
were called in to expand the search. 
Thanks to Chase and Jacksonville’s 
brave first responders, Steven and Abi-
gail were successfully rescued and a 
terrible tragedy was prevented. 
Chase’s strength and bravery is a re-
minder that heroes come in all ages 
and sizes. I applaud the lifesaving ac-
tions of the Jacksonville Fire and Res-
cue 
Department, 
the 
Jacksonville 
Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Conservation Commission, and 
most of all, Chase, who showed remark-
able grit and determination to save his 
dad and sister.∑

REMEMBERING SARAH COHEN- 
DOHERTY 
∑ Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to recognize an Oregonian who was 
a champion for children and families in 
my home State. Sarah Cohen-Doherty 
was a young Oregonian with a passion 
for helping those most vulnerable; she 
left us far too soon. Sarah was known 
in the Portland community to be a 
fierce advocate with a generous heart, 
and she followed that heart into a ca-
reer in public service. 
After getting her master of arts in 
teaching from Willamette University, 
Sarah worked as a community impact 
manager for Social Venture Partners 
Portland, an organization that invests 
in local nonprofit organizations and 
community causes. Every day, she 
worked tirelessly to put needy people 
in touch with the organizations that 
could solve their problems and improve 
their lives. 
Sarah’s public service extended out-
side of work hours. She was instru-
mental in the effort to pass a county 
ballot initiative that would go on to 
fund universal preschool in Multnomah 
County. In November 2020, several 
months after her tragic, unexpected 
passing, that county ballot measure 
passed thanks to her efforts. If that 
wasn’t enough, somewhere in what I 
can only assume was the 25th hour of 
the day, Sarah also volunteered in 
Portland-area high schools to teach 
about the Holocaust. Sarah was com-
mitted to Oregon’s statewide effort to 
preserve the memories of those lost in 
the 
horrific 
genocide 
and 
prevent 
something so awful from occurring in 
the future. I am incredibly proud to 
have known Sarah and was moved by 
her commitment to equity for all chil-
dren, especially Portland’s youngest. 
Sarah is survived by her husband 
Brian, stepdaughter Maysa, mother 
Ruth and father Jerry. Her life will be 
celebrated by a community made bet-
ter by her service and incredible com-
passion. The impact she had during her 
time here with us will be felt for gen-
erations by the children and families 
she worked so incredibly hard to sup-
port and protect. We celebrate her life 
and the legacy she leaves behind.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Ms. WARREN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
and Mr. MARKEY): 
S. 2004. A bill to provide for the basic 
needs of students at institutions of 
higher education; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mrs. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the ‘‘BASIC 
Act,’’ which I introduced today. 
I know how important it is to help 
students cover the full cost of attend-
ing college, including tuition and fees, 
housing, food, transportation, books, 
medical, childcare and supplies. 
In California, even though State and 
institutional aid programs cover full 
tuition and fees for about half of stu-
dents attending a California State Uni-
versity, University of California and 
California Community College, stu-
dents struggle to pay for the remaining 
cost of attendance. 
Each year, over 300,000 eligible appli-
cants do not receive a state Cal Grant 
because of limited availability. Non- 
tuition college costs can exceed $20K 
annually. Low-income students may 
spend about half their family income 
on out-of-pocket costs after grant aid. 
This bill will help accelerate Califor-
nia’s work to make college affordable 
and provide funding to reach more 
schools across California and across 
our Nation. This is especially impor-
tant at a time when community college 
enrollment 
has 
slowed 
during 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
particularly 
among students of color, lower-income 
students, and students who have left to 
work or take care of family members. 
As we work to build back better and 
increase affordability and accessibility

of higher education, we must help our 
students stay in school. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill to authorize $1 billion for a 
new grant program to help institutions 
of higher education meet students’ 
basic needs. 
This funding represents an essential 
aspect of building more equitable paths 
to higher education, and it represents 
an investment in our students, our in-
stitutions, and our future. 
This legislation recognizes the dis-
proportionate impact this pandemic 
has on vulnerable populations and it 
helps coordinate assistance across fed-
eral agency lines. 
I want to thank Senator WARREN and 
Representative TORRES for introducing 
this bill with me, and I hope our col-
leagues will join us in support of this 
bill that ensures no student is forced to 
choose between their education and 
food or housing. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
COLLINS, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Ms. 
CORTEZ MASTO, and Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR): 
S. 2008. A bill to strengthen the 
United States Interagency Council on 
Homelessness; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED, Mr. President, along with 
Senator COLLINS, I am reintroducing 
legislation that would eliminate the 
sunset date for the United States Inter-
agency Council on Homelessness (the 
Council or USICH) so that this agency 
can build upon its success in helping to 
prevent and end homelessness nation-
ally. 
The Council was established under 
the Reagan Administration as part of 
the landmark Mckinney-Vento Home-
less Assistance Act of 1987, Since that 
time, it has worked across the Federal 
government and the private sector to 
coordinate homeless assistance nation-
ally. In 2009, e Homeless Emergency 
Assistance and Rapid Transition to 
Housing Act, which I authored along 
with Senator COLLINS, expanded the 
Council’s role to work with public, 
non-profit, and private stakeholders to 
develop a national strategic plan to 
end homelessness. According to the 
Council, 
the 
Council’s 
work 
‘‘has 
helped drive homelessness down by 9% 
and helped 82 communities effectively 
end veteran homelessness and four end 
chronic homelessness’’ since 2010. 
Even with this progress, the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment’s 2020 Annual Homeless Assess-
ment Report to Congress found that on 
‘‘a single night in 2020, roughly 580,000 
people were experiencing homelessness 
in the United States’’ and ‘‘2020 mark] 
ed] the first time since data collection 
began that more individuals experi-
encing homelessness were unsheltered 
than were sheltered.’’ 
Clearly, we have more work to do. 
and if anything, COVID–19 has further 
highlighted the critical importance of 
housing. Indeed, for many families, 
their homes may be the single most ef-
fective and accessible form of personal 
protective equipment. And we also 
know that continuing to invest in pro-
grams to address homelessness and in-
crease affordable housing pays addi-
tional dividends. According to Cross-
roads Rhode Island, a homeless services 
organization, ‘‘In 2016, approximately 
90% of individuals experiencing home-
lessness in Rhode Island were on Med-
icaid,’’ and ‘‘The average annual Med-
icaid cost for a person experiencing 
homelessness in Rhode Island ($14,723) 
was 80% higher than that of the aver-
age Medicaid recipient ($8,200).’’ In 
short, helping families avoid homeless-
ness 
can 
actually 
save 
taxpayers 
money. 
This is what we call a win-win, and 
the Council is uniquely positioned to 
facilitate a whole of government ap-
proach that marshals the resources of 
the Council’s 19 federal member agen-
cies to help more communities effec-
tively address homelessness and also 
potentially save taxpayer funds. Our 
bipartisan legislation ensures that the 
Council’s doors remain open until there 
truly is an end to homelessness nation-
wide. 
I thank the many groups that sup-
port our legislation including the Na-
tional Low Income Housing Coalition, 
Local Initiatives Support Corporation, 
the Council of Large Public Housing 
Authorities, HousingWorksRI, and oth-
ers. I urge our colleagues to join Sen-
ator COLLINS and me in supporting this 
legislation. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. GRASSLEY): 
S. 2009. A bill to promote trans-
parency by permitting the Public Com-
pany Accounting Oversight Board to 
allow its disciplinary proceedings to be 
open to the public, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President. the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(PCAOB) Enforcement Transparency 
Act, which I reintroduce today with 
Senator GRASSLEY, will bring needed 
transparency to the disciplinary pro-
ceedings 
the 
PCAOB 
has 
brought 
against auditors and audit firms earlier 
in the process. 
Nearly two decades ago, in response 
to a series of massive financial report-
ing frauds, including those involving 
Enron 
and 
WorldCom. 
the 
Senate 
Banking 
Committee 
held 
multiple 
hearings, which produced consensus on 
various underlying causes, including 
weak corporate governance, a lack of 
accountability, and inadequate over-
sight of accountants charged with au-
diting 
public 
companies’ 
financial 
statements. Later, in a 99 to 0 vote, the 
Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002 to address the structural weak-
nesses revealed by the hearings. Among 
its many provisions, this law called for 
the creation of an independent board, 
the PCAOB, responsible for overseeing 
auditors of public companies in order 
to protect investors who rely on inde-
pendent audit reports on the financial 
statements of public companies. 
Today, the PCAOB, under the over-
sight of the U.S. Securities and Ex-
change Commission (SEC), oversees 
more than 1,700 registered accounting 
firms, as well as the audit partners and 
staff who contribute to a firm’s work 
on each audit. The Board’s ability to 
begin proceedings that can determine 
whether there have been violations of 
its auditing standards or rules of pro-
fessional practice is a crucial compo-
nent of its oversight. However, unlike 
other oversight bodies, the Board’s dis-
ciplinary proceedings cannot be made 
public without consent from the par-
ties involved. Of course, parties subject 
to disciplinary proceedings have no in-
centive to consent to publicizing their 
alleged wrongdoing and these pro-
ceedings typically remain cloaked be-
hind a veil of secrecy. In addition, the 
Board cannot publicize the results of 
its disciplinary proceedings until after 
the appeals process has been com-
pletely exhausted, which can often 
take several years. 
This lack of transparency invites 
abuse and undermines the Congres-
sional intent behind the PCAOB, which 
was to shine a bright light on auditing 
firms and practices, deter misconduct 
and bolster the accountability of audi-
tors of public companies to the invest-
ing public. 
Our bill will restore transparency by 
making hearings by the PCAOB, and 
all related notices, orders, and mo-
tions, transparent and available to the 
public unless otherwise ordered by the 
Board. This would more closely align 
the PCAOB’s procedures with those of 
the SEC for analogous matters. 
Increasing transparency and account-
ability of audit firms subject to PCAOB 
disciplinary proceedings bolsters inves-
tor confidence in our financial markets 
and better protects companies from 
problematic auditors. I hope our col-
leagues will join Senator GRASSLEY and 
me in supporting this legislation to en-
hance transparency in the PCAOB’s en-
forcement process. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
KELLY, and Mr. MENENDEZ): 
S. 2022. A bill to enable States to bet-
ter provide access to whole genome se-
quencing clinical services for certain 
undiagnosed children under the Med-
icaid program, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the ‘‘Ending the Di-
agnostic Odyssey Act.’’ This legislation 
gives States the option of providing 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) clin-
ical services through edicaid for chil-
dren with a disease that is suspected to 
have a genetic cause, at an enhanced 
Federal matching rate for three years. 
I am pleased to be joined by Senators 
KELLY and MENENDEZ.

agnostic odyssey, and 30 percent of

those children will not survive beyond 
the age of five years old. The average 
patient sees seven different physicians 
in that time. The wait to find a cause— 
never mind a cure—can be excru-
ciating. Parents try to project a calm 
and reassuring presence for their child 
while facing a whirlwind of doctor ap-
pointments, hospital visits, and unan-
swered questions. 
Undeniably, we are making progress 
in both accelerating research funding 
for rare diseases as well as in the devel-
opment of diagnostics. In 2014, the Na-
tional 
Institutes 
of 
Health 
(NIH) 
launched 
a 
program 
called 
the 
Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). 
In its first 20 months, the UDN accept-
ed 601 participants undiagnosed by tra-
ditional medical practices. Of those 
who completed their UDN evaluation 
during this time, 35% were given a di-
agnosis. Many of these diagnoses were 
rare genetic diseases including 31 pre-
viously unknown syndromes. 
In May 2019, the Director of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis 
Collins, wrote a blog post on how whole 
genome sequencing—combined with ar-
tificial intelligence (AI)—can now be 
used to diagnose genetic diseases in se-
riously ill babies in fewer than 24 
hours. Dr. Collins writes ‘‘I would sub-
mit that there is no other technology 
in the history of planet Earth that has 
experienced this degree of progress in 
speed and affordability.’’ 
For parents of children with an 
undiagnosed illness, answers cannot 
come soon enough. There are approxi-
mately 
7,000 
rare 
diseases 
known 
today. Approximately 80 percent of 
rare diseases are genetic, and about 
one-half of all rare diseases affect chil-
dren. For example, Alstrom syndrome 
is an extremely rare and complex ge-
netic disorder. Approximately 1200 af-
fected individuals have been identified 
worldwide, which makes a obtaining a 
correct diagnosis challenging. Charac-
teristics of Alstrom syndrome include 
vision 
disturbances, 
sensorineural 
hearing impairment, cardiomyopathy, 
obesity, kidney dysfunction, and diabe-
tes. Robin Marshall, Executive Direc-
tor of the Alstrom Syndrome Inter-
national, located in Mount Desert Is-
land, Maine, has said that ‘‘Whole Ge-
nome Sequencing has changed the lives 
of those we represent by enabling ear-
lier and more accurate diagnosis, fos-
tering more timely and appropriate 
medical care, and unlocking a host of 
social services to combat the edu-
cational and psycho-social complica-
tions that our children confront.’’ 
By giving states an incentive to pro-
vide whole genome sequencing for eli-
gible children through Medicaid, my 
legislation will ensure that more chil-
dren and their families can obtain the 
right diagnosis and treatment from the 
start. The ‘‘Ending the Diagnostic Od-
yssey Act’’ has the support of more 
than one hundred patient advocacy or-
ganizations, including Alstrom Syn-
drome International, the Genetic Alli-
ance, the Personalized Medicine Coali-
tion, and many others. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. MORAN, Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, Mr. WARNER, and 
Mr. SCHATZ): 
S. 2024. A bill to require that internet 
platforms give users the option to en-
gage with a platform without being 
manipulated by algorithms driven by 
user-specific data; to the Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transpor-
tation. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

(5) INPUT-TRANSPARENT ALGORITHM.— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—The term ‘‘input-trans-
parent algorithm’’ means an algorithmic 
ranking system that does not use the user- 
specific data of a user to determine the order 
or manner that information is furnished to 
such user on a covered internet platform, un-
less the user-specific data is expressly pro-
vided to the platform by the user for such 
purpose. 
(B) INCLUSION OF AGE-APPROPRIATE CONTENT 
FILTERS.—Such term shall include an algo-
rithmic ranking system that uses user-spe-
cific data to determine whether a user is old 
enough to access age-restricted content on a 
covered internet platform, provided that the 
system otherwise meets the requirements of 
subparagraph (A). 
(C) DATA PROVIDED FOR EXPRESS PURPOSE 
OF
INTERACTION
WITH
PLATFORM.—For pur-
poses of subparagraph (A), user-specific data 
that is provided by a user for the express 
purpose of determining the order or manner 
that information is furnished to a user on a 
covered internet platform— 
(i) 
shall 
include 
user-supplied 
search 
terms, filters, speech patterns (if provided 
for the purpose of enabling the platform to 
accept spoken input or selecting the lan-
guage in which the user interacts with the 
platform), saved preferences, and the user’s 
current geographical location; 
(ii) shall include data supplied to the plat-
form by the user that expresses the user’s de-
sire that information be furnished to them, 
such as the social media profiles the user fol-
lows, the video channels the user subscribes 
to, or other sources of content on the plat-
form the user follows; 
(iii) shall not include the history of the 
user’s connected device, including the user’s 
history of web searches and browsing, geo-

interaction, and financial transactions; and 
(iv) shall not include inferences about the 
user or the user’s connected device, without 
regard to whether such inferences are based 
on data described in clause (i). 
(6) OPAQUE ALGORITHM.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘‘opaque algo-
rithm’’ means an algorithmic ranking sys-
tem that determines the order or manner 
that information is furnished to a user on a 
covered internet platform based, in whole or 
part, on user-specific data that was not ex-
pressly provided by the user to the platform 
for such purpose. 
(B) EXCEPTION FOR AGE-APPROPRIATE CON-
TENT FILTERS.—Such term shall not include 
an algorithmic ranking system used by a 
covered internet platform if— 
(i) the only user-specific data (including 
inferences about the user) that the system 
uses is information relating to the age of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4048 
June 10, 2021 
SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO ALLOW USERS TO SEE 
UNMANIPULATED 
CONTENT 
ON 
INTERNET PLATFORMS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Beginning on the date 
that is 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, it shall be unlawful— 
(1) for any person to operate a covered 
internet platform that uses an opaque algo-
rithm unless the person complies with the 
requirements of subsection (b); or 
(2) for any upstream provider to grant ac-
cess to an index of web pages on the internet 
under a search syndication contract that 
does not comply with the requirements of 
subsection (c). 
(b) OPAQUE ALGORITHM REQUIREMENTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The requirements of this 
subsection with respect to a person that op-
erates a covered internet platform that uses 
an opaque algorithm are the following: 
(A) The person provides notice to users of 
the platform that the platform uses an 
opaque algorithm that makes inferences 
based on user-specific data to select the con-
tent the user sees. Such notice shall be pre-
sented in a clear, conspicuous manner on the 
platform whenever the user interacts with 
an opaque algorithm for the first time, and 
may be a one-time notice that can be dis-
missed by the user. 
(B) The person makes available a version 
of the platform that uses an input-trans-
parent algorithm and enables users to easily 
switch between the version of the platform 
that uses an opaque algorithm and the 
version of the platform that uses the input- 
transparent algorithm by selecting a promi-
nently placed icon, which shall be displayed 
wherever the user interacts with an opaque 
algorithm. 
(2) 
NONAPPLICATION
TO
CERTAIN
DOWN-
STREAM PROVIDERS.—Paragraph (1) shall not 
apply with respect to an internet search en-
gine if— 
(A) the search engine is operated by a 
downstream provider with fewer than 1,000 
employees; and 
(B) the search engine uses an index of web 
pages on the internet to which such provider 
received access under a search syndication 
contract. 
(c) SEARCH
SYNDICATION
CONTRACT
RE-
QUIREMENT.—The requirements of this sub-
section with respect to a search syndication 
contract are that— 
(1) as part of the contract, the upstream 
provider makes available to the downstream 
provider the same input-transparent algo-
rithm used by the upstream provider for pur-
poses of complying with subsection (b)(1)(B); 
and 
(2) the upstream provider does not impose 
any additional costs, degraded quality, re-
duced speed, or other constraint on the func-
tioning of such algorithm when used by the 
downstream provider to operate an internet 
search engine relative to the performance of 
such algorithm when used by the upstream 
provider to operate an internet search en-
gine. 
SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY FEDERAL TRADE COM-
MISSION. 
(a) UNFAIR
OR DECEPTIVE ACTS
OR PRAC-
TICES.—A violation of this Act by an oper-
ator of a covered internet platform shall be 
treated as a violation of a rule defining an 
unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed 
under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)). 
(b) POWERS OF COMMISSION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
paragraph (3), the Federal Trade Commission 
shall enforce this Act in the same manner, 
by the same means, and with the same juris-

plicable terms and provisions of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) 
were incorporated into and made a part of 
this Act. 
(2) PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES.—Except as 
provided in paragraph (3), any person who

NIZATIONS.—Notwithstanding 
section 
4, 
5(a)(2), or 6 of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (15 U.S.C. 44, 45(a)(2), 46) or any jurisdic-
tional limitation of the Commission, the 
Commission shall also enforce this Act, in 
the same manner provided in paragraphs (1) 
and (2) of this paragraph, with respect to— 
(A) common carriers subject to the Com-
munications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) 
and Acts amendatory thereof and supple-
mentary thereto; and 
(B) organizations not organized to carry on 
business for their own profit or that of their 
members. 
(4) AUTHORITY PRESERVED.—Nothing in this 
Act shall be construed to limit the authority

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 267—DESIG-
NATING 
JUNE 
12, 
2021, 
AS 
‘‘WOMEN VETERANS APPRECIA-
TION DAY’’ 
Mr. 
BOOKER 
(for 
himself, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Mr. 
BRAUN, 
and 
Ms. 
ROSEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 267 
Whereas, throughout every period of the 
history of the United States, women have 
proudly served the United States to secure 
and preserve freedom and liberty for— 
(1) the people of the United States; and 
(2) the allies of the United States; 
Whereas women have formally been a part 
of the United States Armed Forces since the 
establishment of the Army Nurse Corps in 
1901 but have informally served the United 
States since the inception of the United 
States military; 
Whereas women have served the United 
States honorably and with valor, including— 
(1) as soldiers disguised as males during 
the American Revolution and the Civil War; 
(2) as nurses during World War I and World 
War II; and 
(3) as combat helicopter pilots in Afghani-
stan; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, women con-
stitute approximately 17 percent of United 
States Armed Forces personnel on active 
duty, including— 
(1) 21 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Air Force; 
(2) 20 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Navy; 
(3) 15 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Army; 
(4) 9 percent of active duty personnel in the 
Marine Corps; and 
(5) 15 percent of active duty personnel in 
the Coast Guard; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, women con-
stitute nearly 21 percent of personnel in the 
National Guard and Reserves; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, women comprise 
nearly 25 percent of the personnel in the Na-
tional Guard and Reserves activated to sup-
port COVID–19 response efforts; 
Whereas, in 2020— 
(1) the population of women veterans 
reached 2,000,000, which represents an expo-
nential increase from 713,000 women veterans 
in 1980; and 
(2) women veterans constitute more than 
10 percent of the total veteran population; 
Whereas an estimated 1 in 4 women vet-
erans enrolled in the healthcare system of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs report 
having experienced military sexual trauma 
(MST) during their military service; 
Whereas the United States is proud of, and 
appreciates, the service of all women vet-
erans who have demonstrated great skill, 
sacrifice, and commitment to defending the 
principles upon which the United States was 
founded and which the United States con-
tinues to uphold; 
Whereas women veterans have unique sto-
ries and should be encouraged to share their 
recollections through the Veterans History 
Project, which has worked since 2000 to col-
lect and share the personal accounts of war-
time veterans in the United States; and 
Whereas, by designating June 12, 2021, as 
‘‘Women Veterans Appreciation Day’’, the 
Senate can— 
(1) highlight the growing presence of 
women in the Armed Forces and the Na-
tional Guard; and 
(2) pay respect to women veterans for their 
dutiful military service: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates June 
12, 2021, as ‘‘Women Veterans Appreciation 
Day’’ to recognize the service and sacrifices 
of women veterans who have served valiantly 
on behalf of the United States.

(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Developing a robust, talented, and 
homegrown workforce, particularly in the 
fields of STEM, is critical to the success of 
the United States innovation economy. 
(2) The United States educational system 
is not producing a sufficient number of work-
ers with the necessary STEM expertise to 
meet the needs of the United States industry 
in STEM fields. 
(3) Hands-on and experiential learning op-
portunities outside of the classroom are crit-
ical for student success in STEM subjects 
and careers, stimulating students’ interest, 
increasing confidence, and creating motiva-
tion to pursue a related career. 
(4) Hands-on and experiential learning op-
portunities can be particularly successful in 
inspiring interest in students who tradition-
ally have been underrepresented in STEM 
fields, including girls, students of color, and 
students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
(5) An expansion of hands-on and experien-
tial learning programs across the United 
States would expand the STEM workforce 
pipeline, developing and training students 
for careers in STEM fields. 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—

school’’, ‘‘high school’’, ‘‘secondary school’’, 
and ‘‘State’’ have the meanings given the 
terms in section 8101 of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
7801). 
(2) 
ELIGIBLE
NONPROFIT
PROGRAM.—The 
term ‘‘eligible nonprofit program’’— 
(A) means a nonprofit program serving pre-
kindergarten, elementary school, or sec-
ondary school students; and 
(B) includes a program described in sub-
paragraph (A) that covers the continuum of 
education 
from 
prekindergarten 
through 
high school and is available in every State. 
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this section 
are to— 
(1) provide effective, compelling, and en-
gaging means for teaching and reinforcing 
fundamental STEM concepts and inspiring 
the youth of the United States to pursue ca-
reers in STEM-related fields; 
(2) expand the STEM workforce pipeline by 
developing and training students for careers 
in United States STEM fields; and 
(3) broaden participation in the STEM 
workforce by underrepresented population 
groups. 
(d) PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to the avail-
ability of appropriations for such purposes, 
the Director shall—

be used, mimicked, or redesigned to develop 
new products, processes, and systems that 
improve societal well-being, strengthen na-
tional security, and contribute to the econ-
omy. 
(2) Engineering biology relies on a work-
force with a diverse and unique set of skills 
combining the biological, physical, chemical, 
and information sciences and engineering. 
(3) Long-term research and development is 
necessary to create breakthroughs in engi-
neering biology. Such research and develop-
ment requires government investment, as 
many of the benefits are too distant or un-
certain for industry to support alone.

dence-based governance of engineering biol-
ogy and to support the growth of the engi-
neering biology industry. 
(5) The Federal Government has an obliga-
tion to ensure that ethical, legal, environ-
mental, safety, security, and societal impli-
cations of its science and technology re-
search and investment follows policies of re-
sponsible 
innovation 
and 
fosters 
public 
transparency. 
(6) The Federal Government can play an 
important role by facilitating the develop-
ment of tools and technologies to further ad-
vance engineering biology, including user fa-
cilities, by facilitating public-private part-
nerships, by supporting risk research, and by 
facilitating the commercial application in 
the United States of research funded by the 
Federal Government. 
(7) The United States led the development 
of the science and engineering techniques 
that created the field of engineering biology, 
but due to increasing international competi-
tion, the United States is at risk of losing its 
competitive advantage if it does not strate-
gically invest the necessary resources. 
(8) A National Engineering Biology Initia-
tive can serve to establish new research di-
rections 
and 
technology 
goals, 
improve 
interagency coordination and planning proc-
esses, drive technology transfer to the pri-
vate sector, and help ensure optimal returns 
on the Federal investment. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) BIOMANUFACTURING.—The term ‘‘bio-
manufacturing’’ means the utilization of bio-
logical systems to develop new and advance 
existing products, tools, and processes at

OPMENT. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Widespread use of standards facilitates 
technology advancement by defining and es-
tablishing common foundations for inter-
operability, product differentiation, techno-
logical innovation, and other value-added 
services. 
(2) Standards also promote an expanded, 
more interoperable, and efficient market-
place. 
(3) Global cooperation and coordination on 
standards for emerging technologies will be 
critical for having a consistent set of ap-
proaches to enable market competition, pre-
clude barriers to trade, and allow innovation 
to flourish. 
(4) The People’s Republic of China’s Stand-
ardization Reform Plan and Five-Year Plan 
for Standardization highlight its high-level 
goals to establish China as a standards power 
by 2020, participate in at least half of all 
standards drafting and revision efforts in 
recognized international standards setting 
organizations, and strengthen China’s par-
ticipation in the governance of international 
standards setting organizations. 
(5) As emerging technologies develop for 
global deployment, it is critical that the 
United States and its allies continue to par-
ticipate in the development of standards 
that underpin the technologies themselves, 
and the future international governance of 
these technologies. 
(6) The United States position on standard-
ization in emerging technologies will be crit-
ical to United States economic competitive-
ness. 
(7) The National Institute of Standards and 
Technology is in a unique position to 
strengthen 
United 
States 
leadership 
in 
standards 
development, 
particularly 
for 
emerging technologies, to ensure continuing 
United States economic competitiveness and 
national security. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the principles of openness, trans-
parency, due process, and consensus in the 
development of international standards are 
critical; 
(2) voluntary consensus standards, devel-
oped through an industry-led process, serve 
as the cornerstone of the United States 
standardization system and have become the 
basis of a sound national economy and the 
key to global market access; 
(3) strengthening the unique United States 
public-private 
partnerships 
approach 
to 
standards development is critical to United 
States economic competitiveness; and 
(4) the United States Government should 
ensure cooperation and coordination across 
Federal agencies to partner with and support 
private sector stakeholders to continue to 
shape international dialogues in regard to 
standards development for emerging tech-
nologies. 
(c) ACTIVITIES AND ENGAGEMENT.—The Sec-

ards for digital economy technologies, in-
cluding partnering with industry to assist 
private sector partners to develop standards 
strategies and support engagement and par-
ticipation in the relevant standards activi-
ties; and 
(3) prioritize efforts on standards develop-
ment for emerging technologies, identify or-
ganizations to develop these standards, iden-
tify leadership positions of interest to the

tration serving under an appointment with-
out time limitation; and 
‘‘(B) does not include— 
‘‘(i) a reemployed annuitant under sub-
chapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 
5 or any other retirement system for employ-
ees of the Federal Government; 
‘‘(ii) an employee having a disability on 
the basis of which such employee is or would 
be eligible for disability retirement under 
any of the retirement systems referred to in 
clause (i); or 
‘‘(iii) for purposes of eligibility for separa-
tion incentives under this subsection, an em-
ployee who is in receipt of a decision notice 
of involuntary separation for misconduct or 
unacceptable performance. 
‘‘(2) AUTHORITY.—The Administrator may 
establish a program under which employees 
may be eligible for early retirement, offered 
separation incentive pay to separate from 
service voluntarily, or both. This authority 
may be used to reduce the number of per-
sonnel employed or to restructure the work-
force to meet mission objectives without re-
ducing the overall number of personnel. This 
authority is in addition to, and notwith-
standing, any other authorities established 
by law or regulation for such programs. 
‘‘(3) EARLY RETIREMENT.—An employee who 
is at least 50 years of age and has completed 
20 years of service, or has at least 25 years of 
service, may, pursuant to regulations pro-
mulgated under this subsection, apply and be 
retired from the Administration and receive 
benefits in accordance with subchapter III of 
chapter 83 or 84 of title 5 if the employee has 
been employed continuously within the Ad-
ministration for more than 30 days before 
the date on which the determination to con-
duct a reduction or restructuring within 1 or 
more Administration centers is approved. 
‘‘(4) SEPARATION PAY.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Separation pay shall be 
paid in a lump sum or in installments and

‘‘(i) an amount equal to the amount the 
employee would be entitled to receive under 
section 5595(c) of title 5, if the employee were 
entitled to payment under such section; or 
‘‘(ii) $40,000. 
‘‘(B) LIMITATIONS.—Separation pay shall 
not be a basis for payment, and shall not be 
included in the computation, of any other 
type of Government benefit. Separation pay 
shall not be taken into account for the pur-
pose of determining the amount of any sever-
ance pay to which an individual may be enti-
tled under section 5595 of title 5, based on 
any other separation. 
‘‘(C) INSTALLMENTS.—Separation pay, if 
paid in installments, shall cease to be paid 
upon the recipient’s acceptance of employ-
ment by the Federal Government, or com-
mencement of work under a personal serv-
ices contract as described in paragraph (5). 
‘‘(5) LIMITATIONS ON REEMPLOYMENT.— 
‘‘(A) An employee who receives separation 
pay under such program may not be reem-
ployed by the Administration for a 12-month 
period beginning on the effective date of the 
employee’s separation, unless this prohibi-
tion is waived by the Administrator on a 
case-by-case basis. 
‘‘(B) An employee who receives separation 
pay under this section on the basis of a sepa-
ration and accepts employment with the 
Government of the United States, or who 
commences work through a personal services 
contract with the United States within 5 
years after the date of the separation on 
which payment of the separation pay is 
based, shall be required to repay the entire 
amount of the separation pay to the Admin-
istration. If the employment is with an Exec-
utive agency (as defined by section 105 of 
title 5) other than the Administration, the 
Administrator may, at the request of the 
head of that agency, waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. If the employment 
is within the Administration, the Adminis-
trator may waive the repayment if the indi-
vidual involved is the only qualified appli-
cant available for the position. If the em-
ployment is with an entity in the legislative 
branch, the head of the entity or the ap-
pointing official may waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. If the employment 
is with the judicial branch, the Director of 
the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts may waive the repayment if 
the individual involved possesses unique 
abilities and is the only qualified applicant 
available for the position. 
‘‘(6) REGULATIONS.—Under the program es-
tablished under paragraph (2), early retire-
ment and separation pay may be offered only 
pursuant to regulations established by the 
Administrator, subject to such limitations 
or conditions as the Administrator may re-
quire. 
‘‘(7) USE OF EXISTING FUNDS.—The Adminis-
trator shall carry out this subsection using 
amounts otherwise made available to the Ad-
ministrator and no additional funds are au-
thorized to be appropriated to carry out this 
subsection.’’.

SEC. 3002. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is 
leveraging its political, diplomatic, eco-
nomic, military, technological, and ideolog-
ical power to become a strategic, near-peer, 
global competitor of the United States. The 
policies increasingly pursued by the PRC in 
these domains are contrary to the interests 
and values of the United States, its partners, 
and much of the rest of the world. 
(2) The current policies being pursued by 
the PRC— 
(A) threaten the future character of the 
international order and are shaping the 
rules, norms, and institutions that govern 
relations among states; 
(B) will put at risk the ability of the 
United States to secure its national inter-
ests; and 
(C) will put at risk the future peace, pros-
perity, and freedom of the international 
community in the coming decades. 
(3) After normalizing diplomatic relations 
with the PRC in 1979, the United States ac-
tively worked to advance the PRC’s eco-
nomic and social development to ensure that 
the PRC participated in, and benefitted 
from, the free and open international order. 
The United States pursued these goals and 
contributed to the welfare of the Chinese 
people by— 
(A) increasing the PRC’s trade relations 
and access to global capital markets; 
(B) promoting the PRC’s accession to the 
World Trade Organization; 
(C) providing development finance and 
technical assistance; 
(D) promoting research collaboration; 
(E) educating the PRC’s top students; 
(F) permitting transfers of cutting-edge 
technologies and scientific knowledge; and 
(G) providing intelligence and military as-
sistance. 
(4) It is now clear that the PRC has chosen 
to pursue state-led, mercantilist economic 
policies, an increasingly authoritarian gov-
ernance model at home through increased re-
strictions on personal freedoms, and an ag-
gressive and assertive foreign policy. These 
policies frequently and deliberately under-
mine United States interests and are con-
trary to core United States values and the 
values of other nations, both in the Indo-Pa-
cific and beyond. In response to this stra-
tegic decision of the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP), the United States has been 
compelled to reexamine and revise its strat-
egy towards the PRC. 
(5) The General Secretary of the CCP and 
the President of the PRC, Xi Jinping, has 
elevated the ‘‘Great Rejuvenation of the Chi-
nese Nation’’ as central to the domestic and 
foreign policy of the PRC. His program de-
mands— 
(A) strong, centralized CCP leadership; 
(B) concentration of military power; 
(C) a strong role for the CCP in the state 
and the economy; 
(D) an aggressive foreign policy seeking 
control over broadly asserted territorial 
claims; and 
(E) the denial of any values and individual 
rights that are deemed to threaten the CCP. 
(6) The PRC views its Leninist model of 
governance, ‘‘socialism with Chinese charac-
teristics’’, as superior to, and at odds with, 
the constitutional models of the United 
States and other democracies. This approach 
to governance is lauded by the CCP as essen-
tial to securing the PRC’s status as a global 
leader, and to shaping the future of the 
world. In a 2013 speech, President Xi said, 
‘‘We firmly believe that as socialism with 
Chinese characteristics develops further . . . 
it is . . . inevitable that the superiority of 
our socialist system will be increasingly ap-
parent . . . [and] our country’s road of devel-
opment will have increasingly greater influ-
ence on the world.’’. 
(7) The PRC’s objectives are to first estab-
lish regional hegemony over the Indo-Pacific 
and then to use that dominant position to 
propel the PRC to become the ‘‘leading world 
power,’’ shaping an international order that 
is conducive to the CCP’s interests. Achiev-
ing these objectives require turning the PRC 
into a wealthy nation under strict CCP rule 
and using a strong military and advanced 
technological capability to pursue the PRC’s 
objectives, regardless of other countries’ in-
terests. 
(8) The PRC is reshaping the current inter-
national order, which is built upon the rule 
of law and free and open ideals and prin-
ciples, by conducting global information and 
influence operations, seeking to redefine 
international laws and norms to align with 
the objectives of the CCP, rejecting the le-
gitimacy 
of 
internationally 
recognized 
human rights, and seeking to co-opt the

June 10, 2021 
leadership and agenda of multinational orga-
nizations for the benefit of the PRC and 
other authoritarian regimes at the expense 
of the interests of the United States and the 
international community. In December 2018, 
President Xi suggested that the CCP views 
its ‘‘historic mission’’ as not only to govern 
China, but also to profoundly influence glob-
al governance to benefit the CCP. 
(9) The PRC is encouraging other countries 
to follow its model of ‘‘socialism with Chi-
nese characteristics’’. During the 19th Party 
Congress in 2017, President Xi said that the 
PRC could serve as a model of development 
for other countries by utilizing ‘‘Chinese wis-
dom’’ and a ‘‘Chinese approach to solving 
problems’’. 
(10) The PRC is promoting its governance 
model and attempting to weaken other mod-
els of governance by— 
(A) undermining democratic institutions; 
(B) subverting financial institutions; 
(C) coercing businesses to accommodate 
the policies of the PRC; and 
(D) using disinformation to disguise the 
nature of the actions described in subpara-
graphs (A) through (C). 
(11) The PRC is close to its goal of becom-
ing the global leader in science and tech-
nology. In May 2018, President Xi said that 
for the PRC to reach ‘‘prosperity and reju-
venation’’, it needs to ‘‘endeavor to be a 
major world center for science and innova-
tion’’. The PRC has invested the equivalent 
of billions of dollars into education and re-
search and development, and has established 
joint scientific research centers and science 
universities. 
(12) The PRC’s drive to become a ‘‘manu-
facturing and technological superpower’’ and 
to promote ‘‘innovation with Chinese charac-
teristics’’ is coming at the expense of human 
rights and longstanding international rules 
and norms with respect to economic com-
petition, and presents a challenge to United 
States national security and the security of 
allies and like-minded countries. In par-
ticular, the PRC advances its illiberal polit-
ical and social policies through mass surveil-
lance, social credit systems, and a signifi-
cant role of the state in internet governance. 
Through these means, the PRC increases di-
rect and indirect government control over 
its citizens’ everyday lives. Its national 
strategy of ‘‘Military-Civil Fusion’’ man-
dates that civil and commercial research, 
which increasingly drives global innovation, 
is leveraged to develop new military capa-
bilities. 
(13) The PRC and the CCP are committing 
crimes against humanity and are engaged in 
an ongoing genocide, in violation of the Con-
vention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris De-
cember 9, 1948, against the predominantly 
Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and reli-
gious minority groups in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur 
Autonomous 
Region, 
including 
through campaigns of imprisonment, tor-
ture, rape, and coercive birth prevention 
policies. 
(14) The PRC is using legal and illegal 
means to achieve its objective of becoming a 
manufacturing 
and 
technological 
super-
power. The PRC uses state-directed indus-
trial policies in anticompetitive ways to en-
sure the dominance of PRC companies. The 
CCP engages in and encourages actions that 
actively undermine a free and open inter-
national market, such as intellectual prop-
erty theft, forced technology transfers, regu-
latory and financial subsidies, and manda-
tory CCP access to proprietary data as part 
of business and commercial agreements be-
tween Chinese and foreign companies. 
(15) The policies referred to in paragraph 
(14) are designed to freeze United States and 
other foreign firms out of the PRC market, 
while eroding competition in other impor-
tant markets. The heavy subsidization of 
Chinese companies includes potential viola-
tion of its World Trade Organization com-
mitments. In May 2018, President Xi said 
that the PRC aims to keep the ‘‘initiatives 
of innovation and development security . . . 
in [China’s] own hands’’. 
(16) The PRC is advancing its global objec-
tives through a variety of avenues, including 
its signature initiative, the Belt and Road 
Initiative (BRI), which is enshrined in the 
Chinese Constitution and includes the Dig-
ital Silk Road and Health Silk Road. The 
PRC describes BRI as a straightforward and 
wholly beneficial plan for all countries. How-
ever, it eventually seeks to advance an eco-
nomic system with the PRC at its center, 
making it the most concrete geographical 
representation of the PRC’s global ambi-
tions. BRI increases the economic influence 
of state-owned Chinese firms in global mar-
kets, enhances the PRC’s political leverage 
with government leaders around the world, 
and provides greater access to strategic 
nodes such as ports and railways. Through 
BRI, the PRC seeks political deference 
through economic dependence. 
(17) The PRC is executing a plan to estab-
lish regional hegemony over the Indo-Pacific 
and displace the United States from the re-
gion. As a Pacific power, the United States 
has built and supported enduring alliances 
and economic partnerships that secure peace 
and prosperity and promote the rule of law 
and political pluralism in a free and open 
Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the PRC uses eco-
nomic and military coercion in the region to 
secure its own interests. 
(18) The PRC’s military strategy seeks to 
keep the United States military from oper-
ating in the Western Pacific and to erode 
United States security guarantees. 
(19) The PRC is aggressively pursuing ex-
clusive control of critical land routes, sea 
lanes, and air space in the Indo-Pacific in the 
hopes of eventually exercising greater influ-
ence beyond the region. This includes lanes 
crucial to commercial activity, energy ex-
ploration, transport, and the exercise of se-
curity operations in areas permitted under 
international law. 
(20) The PRC seeks so-called ‘‘reunifica-
tion’’ with Taiwan through whatever means 
may ultimately be required. The CCP’s in-
sistence that so-called ‘‘reunification’’ is 
Taiwan’s only option makes this goal inher-
ently coercive. In January 2019, President Xi 
stated that the PRC ‘‘make[s] no promise to 
renounce the use of force and reserve[s] the 
option of taking all necessary means’’. Tai-
wan’s embodiment of democratic values and 
economic liberalism challenges President 
Xi’s goal of achieving national rejuvenation. 
The PRC plans to exploit Taiwan’s dominant 
strategic position in the First Island Chain 
and to project power into the Second Island 
Chain and beyond. 
(21) In the South China Sea, the PRC has 
executed an illegal island-building campaign 
that threatens freedom of navigation and the 
free-flow of commerce, damages the environ-
ment, bolsters PLA power projection capa-
bilities, and coerces and intimidates other 
regional claimants in an effort to advance its 
unlawful claims and control the waters 
around neighboring countries. Despite Presi-
dent Xi’s September 2015 speech, in which he 
said the PRC did not intend to militarize the 
South China Sea, during the 2017 19th Party 
Congress, President Xi announced that ‘‘con-
struction on islands and reefs in the South 
China Sea have seen steady progress’’. 
(22) The PRC is rapidly modernizing the 
PLA to attain a level of capacity and capa-
bility superior to the United States in terms 
of equipment and conduct of modern mili-
tary operations by shifting its military doc-
trine from having a force ‘‘adequate [for] 
China’s defensive needs’’ to having a force 
‘‘commensurate with China’s international 
status’’. Ultimately, this transformation 
could enable China to impose its will in the 
Indo-Pacific region through the threat of 
military force. In 2017, President Xi estab-
lished the following developmental bench-
marks for the advancement of the PLA: 
(A) A mechanized force with increased 
informatized and strategic capabilities by 
2020. 
(B) The complete modernization of China’s 
national defense by 2035. 
(C) The full transformation of the PLA 
into a world-class force by 2050. 
(23) The PRC’s strategy and supporting 
policies described in this section undermine 
United States interests, such as— 
(A) upholding a free and open international 
order; 
(B) maintaining the integrity of inter-
national institutions with liberal norms and 
values; 
(C) preserving a favorable balance of power 
in the Indo-Pacific; 
(D) ensuring the defense of its allies; 
(E) preserving open sea and air lanes; 
(F) fostering the free flow of commerce 
through open and transparent markets; and 
(G) promoting individual freedom and 
human rights. 
(24) The global COVID–19 pandemic has in-
tensified and accelerated these trends in the 
PRC’s behavior and therefore increased the 
need for United States global leadership and 
a competitive posture. The PRC has capital-
ized on the world’s focus on the COVID–19 
pandemic by— 
(A) moving rapidly to undermine Hong 
Kong’s autonomy, including imposing a so- 
called ‘‘national security law’’ on Hong 
Kong; 
(B) aggressively imposing its will in the 
East and South China Seas; 
(C) contributing to increased tensions with 
India; and 
(D) engaging in a widespread and govern-
ment-directed disinformation campaign to 
obscure the PRC government’s efforts to 
cover up the seriousness of COVID–19, sow 
confusion about the origination of the out-
break, and discredit the United States, its 
allies, and global health efforts. 
(25) The CCP’s disinformation campaign re-
ferred to in paragraph (24)(D) has included— 
(A) concerted efforts, in the early days of 
the pandemic, to downplay the nature and 
scope of the outbreak in Wuhan in the PRC, 
as well as cases of person-to-person trans-
mission; 
(B) claims that the virus originated in 
United States biological defense research at 
Fort Detrick, Maryland; 
(C) Chinese state media reports insinuating 
a possible link between the virus and other 
United States biological facilities; and 
(D) efforts to block access to qualified 
international infectious disease experts who 
might contradict the CCP’s narrative. 
(26) In response to the PRC’s strategy and 
policies, the United States must adopt a pol-
icy of strategic competition with the PRC to 
protect and promote our vital interests and 
values. 
(27) The United States’ policy of strategic 
competition with respect to the PRC is part 
of a broader strategic approach to the Indo- 
Pacific and the world which centers around 
cooperation with United States allies and 
partners to advance shared values and inter-
ests and to preserve and enhance a free, 
open, democratic, inclusive, rules-based, sta-
ble, and diverse region. 
(28) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115–409) contributed to a 
comprehensive framework for promoting

SEC. 3004. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
(a) OBJECTIVES.—It is the policy of the 
United States, in pursuing strategic com-
petition with the PRC, to pursue the fol-
lowing objectives: 
(1) The United States global leadership role 
is sustained and its political system and 
major foundations of national power are pos-
tured for long-term political, economic, 
technological, 
and 
military 
competition 
with the PRC. 
(2) The balance of power in the Indo-Pa-
cific remains favorable to the United States 
and its allies. The United States and its al-
lies maintain unfettered access to the re-
gion, including through freedom of naviga-
tion and the free flow of commerce, con-
sistent with international law and practice, 
and the PRC neither dominates the region 
nor coerces its neighbors. 
(3) The allies and partners of the United 
States— 
(A) maintain confidence in United States 
leadership and its commitment to the Indo- 
Pacific region; 
(B) can withstand and combat subversion 
and undue influence by the PRC; and 
(C) align themselves with the United 
States in setting global rules, norms, and 
standards that benefit the international 
community. 
(4) The combined weight of the United 
States and its allies and partners is strong 
enough to demonstrate to the PRC that the 
risks of attempts to dominate other states 
outweigh the potential benefits. 
(5) The United States leads the free and 
open international order, which is comprised 
of resilient states and institutions that up-
hold and defend principles, such as sov-
ereignty, rule of law, individual freedom, and 
human rights. The international order is 
strengthened to defeat attempts at desta-
bilization by illiberal and authoritarian ac-
tors. 
(6) The key rules, norms, and standards of 
international engagement in the 21st cen-
tury are maintained, including— 
(A) the protection of human rights, com-
mercial engagement and investment, and 
technology; and 
(B) that such rules, norms, and standards 
are in alignment with the values and inter-
ests of the United States, its allies and part-
ners, and the free world. 
(7) The United States assures that the CCP 
does not— 
(A) subvert open and democratic societies; 
(B) distort global markets; 
(C) manipulate the international trade sys-
tem; 
(D) coerce other nations via economic and 
military means; or 
(E) use its technological advantages to un-
dermine individual freedoms or other states’ 
national security interests. 
(8) The United States deters military con-
frontation with the PRC and both nations 
work to reduce the risk of conflict. 
(b) POLICY.—It is the policy of the United 
States, in pursuit of the objectives set forth 
in subsection (a)— 
(1) to strengthen the United States domes-
tic foundation by reinvesting in market- 
based economic growth, education, scientific 
and technological innovation, democratic in-
stitutions, and other areas that improve the 
ability of the United States to pursue its 
vital economic, foreign policy, and national 
security interests; 
(2) to pursue a strategy of strategic com-
petition with the PRC in the political, diplo-
matic, economic, development, military, in-
formational, and technological realms that 
maximizes the United States’ strengths and 
increases the costs for the PRC of harming 
United States interests and the values of 
United States allies and partners; 
(3) to lead a free, open, and secure inter-
national system characterized by freedom 
from coercion, rule of law, open markets and 
the free flow of commerce, and a shared com-
mitment to security and peaceful resolution 
of disputes, human rights, and good and 
transparent governance; 
(4) to strengthen and deepen United States 
alliances and partnerships, prioritizing the 
Indo-Pacific and Europe, by pursuing greater 
bilateral and multilateral cooperative initia-
tives that advance shared interests and val-
ues and bolster partner countries’ confidence 
that the United States is and will remain a 
strong, committed, and constant partner; 
(5) to encourage and collaborate with 
United States allies and partners in boosting 
their own capabilities and resiliency to pur-
sue, defend, and protect shared interests and 
values, free from coercion and external pres-
sure; 
(6) to pursue fair, reciprocal treatment and 
healthy competition in United States-China 
economic relations by— 
(A) advancing policies that harden the 
United States economy against unfair and il-
legal commercial or trading practices and 
the coercion of United States businesses; and 
(B) tightening United States laws and reg-
ulations as necessary to prevent the PRC’s 
attempts to harm United States economic 
competitiveness; 
(7) to demonstrate the value of private sec-
tor-led growth in emerging markets around 
the world, including through the use of 
United States Government tools that—

ment and advance capacity-building initia-
tives that are grounded in the rule of law;

frameworks;

in the innovation of critical and emerging

communications, 
artificial 
intelligence, 
quantum computing, semiconductors, and 
biotechnology, by— 
(A) providing necessary investment and 
concrete incentives for the private sector to 
accelerate development of such technologies; 
(B) modernizing export controls and in-
vestment screening regimes and associated 
policies and regulations;

technical standards-setting bodies and ave-
nues for developing norms regarding the use 
of emerging critical technologies; 
(D) reducing United States barriers and in-
creasing incentives for collaboration with al-
lies and partners on the research and co-de-

measures;

nology security; 
(iii) safeguarding chokepoints in supply 
chains; and 
(iv) ensuring diversification; and 
(F) designing major defense capabilities for 
export to allies and partners; 
(11) to enable the people of the United 
States, including the private sector, civil so-
ciety, universities and other academic insti-
tutions, State and local legislators, and 
other relevant actors to identify and remain 
vigilant to the risks posed by undue influ-
ence of the CCP in the United States;

gagement, academic research, and coopera-
tion in other areas where the United States

and other multilateral organizations and de-
fend the integrity of these organizations 
against co-optation by illiberal and authori-

SEC. 3005. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that the execu-
tion of the policy described in section 3004(b) 
requires the following actions: 
(1) Strategic competition with the PRC 
will require the United States— 
(A) to marshal sustained political will to 
protect its vital interests, promote its val-
ues, and advance its economic and national 
security objectives for decades to come; and 
(B) to achieve this sustained political will, 
persuade the American people and United 
States allies and partners of— 
(i) the challenges posed by the PRC; and 
(ii) the need for long-term competition to 
defend shared interests and values. 
(2) The United States must coordinate 
closely with allies and partners to compete 
effectively with the PRC, including to en-
courage allies and partners to assume, as ap-
propriate, greater roles in balancing and 
checking the aggressive and assertive behav-
ior of the PRC. 
(3) The President of the United States 
must lead and direct the entire executive 
branch to treat the People’s Republic of 
China as the greatest geopolitical and 
geoeconomic challenge for United States for-
eign policy, increasing the prioritization of 
strategic competition with the PRC and 
broader United States interests in the Indo- 
Pacific region in the conduct of foreign pol-
icy and assuring the allocation of appro-
priate resources adequate to the challenge. 
(4) The head of every Federal department 
and agency should designate a senior official 
at the level of Under Secretary or above to 
coordinate the department’s or agency’s 
policies with respect to strategic competi-
tion with the PRC. 
(5) The ability of the United States to exe-
cute a strategy of strategic competition with 
the PRC will be undermined if our attention 
is repeatedly diverted to challenges that are 
not vital to United States economic and na-
tional security interests. 
(6) In the coming decades, the United 
States must prevent the PRC from— 
(A) establishing regional hegemony in the 
Indo-Pacific; and 
(B) using that position to advance its as-
sertive political, economic, and foreign pol-
icy goals around the world. 
(7) The United States must ensure that the 
Federal budget is properly aligned with the 
strategic imperative to compete with the 
PRC by— 
(A) ensuring sufficient levels of funding to 
resource all instruments of United States na-
tional power; and 
(B) coherently prioritizing how such funds 
are used. 
(8) Sustained prioritization of the chal-
lenge posed by the PRC requires— 
(A) bipartisan cooperation within Con-
gress; and 
(B) frequent, sustained, and meaningful 
collaboration and consultation between the 
executive branch and Congress. 
(9) The United States must ensure close in-
tegration among economic and foreign pol-
icymakers, the private sector, civil society, 
universities and academic institutions, and 
other relevant actors in free and open soci-
eties affected by the challenges posed by the 
PRC to enable such actors— 
(A) to collaborate to advance common in-
terests; and 
(B) to identify appropriate policies— 
(i) to strengthen the United States and its 
allies; 
(ii) to promote a compelling vision of a 
free and open order; and 
(iii) to push back against detrimental poli-
cies pursued by the CCP. 
(10) The United States must ensure that all 
Federal departments and agencies are orga-
nized to reflect the fact that strategic com-
petition with the PRC is the United States’ 
greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic chal-
lenge, including through the assigned mis-
sions and location of United States Govern-
ment personnel, by— 
(A) dedicating more personnel in the Indo- 
Pacific region, at posts around the world, 
and in Washington DC, with priorities di-
rectly relevant to advancing competition 
with the People’s Republic of China; 
(B) placing greater numbers of foreign 
service officers, international development 
professionals, members of the foreign com-
mercial service, intelligence professionals, 
and other United States Government per-
sonnel in the Indo-Pacific region; and 
(C) ensuring that this workforce, both ci-
vilian and military, has the training in lan-
guage, technical skills, and other com-
petencies required to advance a successful 
competitive strategy with the PRC. 
(11) The United States must place renewed 
emphasis on strengthening the nonmilitary 
instruments of national power, including di-
plomacy, information, technology, econom-
ics, foreign assistance and development fi-
nance, commerce, intelligence, and law en-
forcement, which are crucial for addressing 
the unique economic, political, and ideolog-
ical challenges posed by the PRC. 
(12) 
The 
United 
States 
must 
sustain 
resourcing for a Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive, which shall be aligned with the over-
arching political and diplomatic objectives 
articulated in the Asia Reassurance Initia-
tive Act (Public Law 115–409), and must 
prioritize the military investments nec-
essary to achieve United States political ob-
jectives in the Indo-Pacific, including— 
(A) promoting regional security in the 
Indo-Pacific; 
(B) reassuring allies and partners while 
protecting them from coercion; and 
(C) deterring conflict with the PRC. 
(13) Competition with the PRC requires the 
United States’ skillful adaptation to the in-
formation environment of the 21st century. 
United States public diplomacy and mes-
saging efforts must effectively— 
(A) promote the value of partnership with 
the United States; 
(B) highlight the risks and costs of 
enmeshment with the PRC; and 
(C) 
counter 
CCP 
propaganda 
and 
disinformation.

SEC. 3113. UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR INFRA-
STRUCTURE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Global Infrastructure 
Coordinating Committee (GICC) was estab-
lished to coordinate the efforts of the De-
partment of State, the Department of Com-
merce, the Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Energy, the Department of 
Transportation, the United States Agency 
for International Development, the United 
States Trade and Development Agency, the 
Development Finance Corporation, the Ex-
port-Import Bank of the United States, and 
other agencies to catalyze private sector in-
vestments around the world and to coordi-
nate the deployment of United States Gov-
ernment technical assistance and develop-
ment finance tools, including project prepa-
ration services and commercial advocacy. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the world’s infrastructure needs, includ-
ing in the transport, energy, and digital sec-
tors, are vast and growing; 
(2) total or partial ownership or acquisi-
tion of, or a significant financial stake or 
physical presence in, certain types of infra-
structure, including ports, energy grids, 5G 
telecommunications networks, and undersea 
cables, can provide an advantage to coun-
tries that do not share the interests and val-
ues of the United States and its allies and 
partners, and could therefore be deleterious 
to the interests and values of the United 
States and its allies and partners; 
(3) the United States must continue to 
prioritize support for infrastructure projects 
that are physically secure, financially via-
ble, economically sustainable, and socially 
responsible; 
(4) achieving the objective outlined in 
paragraph (3) requires the coordination of all 
United States Government economic tools 
across the interagency, so that such tools 
are deployed in a way to maximize United 
States interests and that of its allies and 
partners; 
(5) the GICC represents an important and 
concrete step towards better communication 
and coordination across the United States 
Government of economic tools relevant to 
supporting infrastructure that is physically 
secure, financially viable, economically sus-
tainable, and socially responsible, and should 
be continued; and 
(6) the executive branch and Congress 
should have consistent consultations on 
United States support for strategic infra-
structure projects, including how Congress 
can support such initiatives in the future. 
(c) REPORTING
REQUIREMENT.—Not later 
than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, and semi-annually thereafter for 
5 years, the Secretary of State, in coordina-
tion with other Federal agencies that par-
ticipate in the GICC, and, as appropriate, the 
Director of National Intelligence, shall sub-

gress a report that identifies— 
(1) current, pending, and future infrastruc-
ture projects, particularly in the transport, 
energy, and digital sectors, that the United 
States is supporting or will support through 
financing, foreign assistance, technical as-
sistance, or other means; 
(2) a detailed explanation of the United 
States and partner country interests served 
by the United States providing support to 
such projects; and 
(3) a detailed description of any support 
provided by other United States allies and 
partners to such projects.

that the United States must lead in inter-
national bodies that set the governance 
norms and rules for critical digitally enabled 
technologies in order to ensure that these 
technologies operate within a free, secure, 
interoperable, and stable digital domain. 
(b) 
COUNTERING
DIGITAL 
AUTHORITARIANISM.—It is the sense of Con-
gress that the United States, along with al-
lies and partners, should lead an inter-
national effort that utilizes all of the eco-
nomic and diplomatic tools at its disposal to 
combat the expanding use of information and 
communications technology products and 
services to surveil, repress, and manipulate 
populations 
(also 
known 
as 
‘‘digital 
authoritarianism’’). 
(c) 
NEGOTIATIONS
FOR
DIGITAL
TRADE 
AGREEMENTS
OR ARRANGEMENTS.—It is the 
sense of Congress that the United States 
Trade Representative should negotiate bilat-
eral and plurilateral agreements or arrange-
ments relating to digital goods with the Eu-
ropean Union, Japan, Taiwan, the member

ing alliance, and other nations, as appro-
priate. 
(d) FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IN THE DIG-
ITAL AGE.—It is the sense of Congress that 
the United States should lead a global effort

cluding the ability to safely consume or pub-
lish information without fear of undue re-
prisals, is maintained as the digital domain 
becomes an increasingly integral mechanism 
for communication. 
(e) EFFORTS TO ENSURE TECHNOLOGICAL DE-
VELOPMENT DOES NOT THREATEN DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNANCE

adopt a set of common principles and stand-
ards for critical technologies to ensure that 
the use of such technologies cannot be 
abused by malign actors, whether they are 
governments or other entities, and that they 
do not threaten democratic governance or 
human rights. 
(f) FORMATION
OF
DIGITAL
TECHNOLOGY

SEC. 3133. FINDINGS ON CHINESE INFORMATION 
WARFARE AND MALIGN INFLUENCE 
OPERATIONS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In the report to Congress required under 
section 1261(b) of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), the President 
laid out a broad range of malign activities 
conducted by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China and its agents and enti-
ties, including— 
(A) propaganda and disinformation, in 
which ‘‘Beijing communicates its narrative 
through state-run television, print, radio, 
and online organizations whose presence is 
proliferating in the United States and 
around the world’’; 
(B) malign political influence operations, 
particularly ‘‘front organizations and agents 
which target businesses, universities, think 
tanks, scholars, journalists, and local state 
and Federal officials in the United States 
and around the world, attempting to influ-
ence discourse’’; and 
(C) malign financial influence operations, 
characterized as the ‘‘misappropriation of 
technology and intellectual property, failure 
to appropriately disclose relationships with 
foreign 
government 
sponsored 
entities, 
breaches of contract and confidentiality, and 
manipulation of processes for fair and merit- 
based allocation of Federal research and de-
velopment funding’’. 
(2) Chinese information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations are ongoing. In 
January 2019, then-Director of National In-
telligence, Dan Coats, stated, ‘‘China will 
continue to use legal, political, and eco-
nomic levers—such as the lure of Chinese 
markets—to shape the information environ-
ment. It is also capable of using cyber at-
tacks against systems in the United States 
to censor or suppress viewpoints it deems po-
litically sensitive.’’. 
(3) In February 2020, then-Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher 
Wray, testified to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary of the House of Representatives that 
the People’s Republic of China has ‘‘very ac-
tive [malign] foreign influence efforts in this 
country,’’ with the goal of ‘‘trying to shift 
our policy and our public opinion to be more 
pro-China on a variety of issues’’. 
(4) The PRC’s information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations continue to adopt 
new tactics and evolve in sophistication. In 
May 2020, then-Special Envoy and Coordi-
nator of the Global Engagement Center 
(GEC), Lea Gabrielle, stated that there was a 
convergence of Russian and Chinese nar-
ratives surrounding COVID–19 and that the 
GEC had ‘‘uncovered a new network of 
inauthentic Twitter accounts’’ that it as-
sessed was ‘‘created with the intent to am-
plify 
Chinese 
propaganda 
and 
disinformation’’. In June 2020, Google re-
ported that Chinese hackers attempted to 
access email accounts of the campaign staff 
of a presidential candidate. 
(5) Chinese information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations are a threat to the 
national security, democracy, and economic 
systems of the United States and its allies 
and partners. In October 2018, Vice President 
Michael R. Pence warned that ‘‘Beijing is 
employing a whole-of-government approach, 
using political, economic, and military tools, 
as well as propaganda, to advance its influ-
ence and benefit its interests in the United 
States.’’. 
(6) In February 2018, then-Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher 
Wray, testified to the Select Committee on 
Intelligence of the Senate that the People’s 
Republic of China is taking advantage of and 
exploiting the open research and develop-
ment environments of United States institu-
tions of higher education to utilize ‘‘profes-
sors, scientists and students’’ as ‘‘nontradi-
tional collectors’’ of information. 
(b) PRESIDENTIAL DUTIES.—The President 
shall— 
(1) protect our democratic institutions and 
processes from malign influence from the

People’s Republic of China and other foreign 
adversaries; and 
(2) consistent with the policy specified in 
paragraph (1), direct the heads of the appro-
priate Federal departments and agencies to 
implement Acts of Congress to counter and 
deter PRC and other foreign information 
warfare and malign influence operations 
without delay, including— 
(A) section 1043 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), which author-
izes a coordinator position within the Na-
tional Security Council for countering ma-
lign foreign influence operations and cam-
paigns; 
(B) section 228 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public 
Law 116–92), which authorizes additional re-
search of foreign malign influence operations 
on social media platforms; 
(C) section 847 of such Act, which requires 
the Secretary of Defense to modify con-
tracting regulations regarding vetting for 
foreign ownership, control and influence in 
order to mitigate risks from malign foreign 
influence; 
(D) section 1239 of such Act, which requires 
an update of the comprehensive strategy to 
counter the threat of malign influence to in-
clude the People’s Republic of China; 
(E) section 5323 of such Act, which author-
izes the Director of National Intelligence to 
facilitate the establishment of Social Media 
Data and Threat Analysis Center to detect 
and study information warfare and malign 
influence operations across social media 
platforms; and 
(F) section 119C of the National Security 
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes 
the establishment of a Foreign Malign Influ-
ence Response Center inside the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence. 
SEC. 3134. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS 
FOR 
THE 
FULBRIGHT-HAYS 
PRO-
GRAM. 
There are authorized to be appropriated, 
for the 5-year period beginning on October 1, 
2021, 
$105,500,000, 
to 
promote 
education, 
training, research, and foreign language 
skills through the Fulbright-Hays Program, 
in accordance with section 102(b) of the Mu-
tual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act 
of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2452(b)). 
SEC. 3135. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING 
ANTI-ASIAN RACISM AND DISCRIMI-
NATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Since the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, crimes and discrimination against 
Asians and those of Asian descent have risen 
dramatically worldwide. In May 2020, United 
Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 
said ‘‘the pandemic continues to unleash a 
tsunami 
of 
hate 
and 
xenophobia, 
scapegoating 
and 
scare-mongering’’ 
and 
urged governments to ‘‘act now to strength-
en the immunity of our societies against the 
virus of hate’’. 
(2) Asian American and Pacific Island 
(AAPI) workers make up a large portion of 
the essential workers on the frontlines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, making up 8.5 percent 
of all essential healthcare workers in the 
United States. AAPI workers also make up a 
large share—between 6 percent and 12 per-
cent based on sector—of the biomedical field. 
(3) The United States Census notes that 
Americans of Asian descent alone made up 
nearly 5.9 percent of the United States popu-
lation in 2019, and that Asian Americans are 
the fastest-growing racial group in the 
United States, projected to represent 14 per-
cent of the United States population by 2065. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the reprehensible attacks on people of 
Asian descent and concerning increase in 
anti-Asian sentiment and racism in the 
United States and around the world have no 
place in a peaceful, civilized, and tolerant 
world; 
(2) the United States is a diverse nation 
with a proud tradition of immigration, and 
the strength and vibrancy of the United 
States is enhanced by the diverse ethnic 
backgrounds and tolerance of its citizens, in-
cluding Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers; 
(3) the United States Government should 
encourage other foreign governments to use 
the official and scientific names for the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as recommended by the 
World Health Organization and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention; and 
(4) the United States Government and 
other governments around the world must 
actively oppose racism and intolerance, and 
use all available and appropriate tools to 
combat the spread of anti-Asian racism and 
discrimination. 
SEC. 3136. SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT MEDIA 
AND 
COUNTERING 
DISINFORMATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The PRC is increasing its spending on 
public diplomacy including influence cam-
paigns, advertising, and investments into 
state-sponsored media publications outside 
of the PRC. These include, for example, more 
than $10,000,000,000 in foreign direct invest-
ment 
in 
communications 
infrastructure, 
platforms, and properties, as well as bringing 
journalists to the PRC for training pro-
grams. 
(2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, 
the United Front Work Department (UFWD), 
and UFWD’s many affiliates and proxies, has 
obtained unfettered access to radio, tele-
vision, and digital dissemination platforms 
in numerous languages targeted at citizens 
in other regions where the PRC has an inter-
est in promoting public sentiment in support 
of the Chinese Communist Party and expand-
ing the reach of its misleading narratives 
and propaganda. 
(3) Even in Western democracies, the PRC 
spends extensively on influence operations, 
such as a $500,000,000 advertising campaign to

TITLE II—INVESTING IN ALLIANCES AND 
PARTNERSHIPS 
Subtitle A—Strategic and Diplomatic Matters 
SEC. 3201. APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CON-
GRESS DEFINED. 
In this subtitle, the term ‘‘appropriate 
committees of Congress’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3202. UNITED STATES COMMITMENT AND 
SUPPORT FOR ALLIES AND PART-
NERS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States treaty alliances in 
the Indo-Pacific provide a unique strategic 
advantage to the United States and are 
among the Nation’s most precious assets, en-
abling the United States to advance its vital 
national interests, defend its territory, ex-
pand its economy through international 
trade and commerce, establish enduring co-
operation among like-minded countries, pre-
vent the domination of the Indo-Pacific and 
its surrounding maritime and air lanes by a 
hostile power or powers, and deter potential 
aggressors; 
(2) the Governments of the United States, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand are critical allies 
in advancing a free and open order in the 
Indo-Pacific region and tackling challenges 
with unity of purpose, and have collaborated 
to advance specific efforts of shared interest 
in areas such as defense and security, eco-
nomic 
prosperity, 
infrastructure 
connectivity, and fundamental freedoms; 
(3) the United States greatly values other 
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, in-
cluding with India, Singapore, Indonesia, 
Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam as well 
as regional architecture such as the Quad, 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Community (APEC), which are essential to 
further shared interests; 
(4) the security environment in the Indo- 
Pacific demands consistent United States 
and allied commitment to strengthening and 
advancing our alliances so that they are pos-
tured to meet these challenges, and will re-
quire sustained political will, concrete part-
nerships, economic, commercial, and techno-
logical cooperation, consistent and tangible 
commitments, high-level and extensive con-
sultations on matters of mutual interest, 
mutual and shared cooperation in the acqui-
sition of key capabilities important to allied 
defenses, and unified mutual support in the 
face of political, economic, or military coer-
cion; 
(5) fissures in the United States alliance 
relationships 
and 
partnerships 
benefit 
United States adversaries and weaken collec-
tive ability to advance shared interests; 
(6) the United States must work with allies 
to prioritize human rights throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region; 
(7) as the report released in August 2020 by 
the Expert Group of the International Mili-
tary 
Council 
on 
Climate 
and 
Security 
(IMCCS), titled ‘‘Climate and Security in the 
Indo-Asia Pacific’’ noted, the Indo-Pacific 
region is one of the regions most vulnerable 
to climate impacts and as former Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Installations 
and Environment Sherri Goodman, Sec-
retary General of IMCCS, noted, climate 
shocks act as a threat multiplier in the Indo- 
Pacific region, increasing humanitarian re-
sponse 
costs 
and 
impacting 
security

Pacific region, the United States Inter-

STATES
EDU-
CATIONAL
AND
EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS
WITH 
TAIWAN.— 
(1) ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES- 
TAIWAN
CULTURAL
EXCHANGE
FOUNDATION.— 
The Secretary of State should consider es-
tablishing an independent nonprofit that— 
(A) is dedicated to deepening ties between 
the future leaders of Taiwan and the United 
States; and 
(B) works with State and local school dis-
tricts and educational institutions to send

SEC. 3214. TAIWAN FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Taiwan Fellowship Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 
96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) affirmed United 
States policy ‘‘to preserve and promote ex-
tensive, close, and friendly commercial, cul-
tural, and other relations between the people 
of the United States and the people on Tai-
wan, as well as the people on the China 
mainland and all other peoples of the West-
ern Pacific area’’. 
(2) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance 
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409), 
the United States has grown its strategic 
partnership with Taiwan’s vibrant democ-
racy of 23,000,000 people. 
(3) Despite a concerted campaign by the 
People’s Republic of China to isolate Taiwan 
from its diplomatic partners and from inter-
national organizations, including the World 
Health Organization, Taiwan has emerged as 
a global leader in the coronavirus global 
pandemic response, including by donating 
more than 2,000,000 surgical masks and other 
medical equipment to the United States. 
(4) The creation of a United States fellow-
ship program with Taiwan would support— 
(A) a key priority of expanding people-to- 
people exchanges, which was outlined in 
President Donald J. Trump’s 2017 National 
Security Strategy; 
(B) President Joseph R. Biden’s commit-
ment to Taiwan, ‘‘a leading democracy and a 
critical economic and security partner,’’ as 
expressed in his March 2021 Interim National 
Security Strategic Guidance; and 
(C) April 2021 guidance from the Depart-
ment of State based on a review required 
under the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (sub-
title B of title III of division FF of Public 
Law 116–260) to ‘‘encourage U.S. government 
engagement with Taiwan that reflects our 
deepening unofficial relationship’’.

thorities on Taiwan or a Taiwanese civic in-
stitution; 
(2) to provide for eligible United States 
personnel to learn or strengthen Mandarin 
Chinese language skills and to expand their

cantly delayed and lacked access to com-
plete, original data and samples’’;

rector-General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros

the investigative team had encountered ‘‘dif-
ficulties’’ in accessing necessary raw data, 
that ‘‘we have not yet found the source of 
the virus,’’ and that ‘‘all hypotheses remain 
on the table’’; and 
(5) it is critical for independent experts to

ernment-sponsored research and funding and

such as 4–AP, which continue to be traf-
ficked to second countries in which they are 
used in the final production of United 
States-bound fentanyl and other synthetic

SEC. 3221. DEFINITIONS. 
In this subtitle: 
(1) 
APPROPRIATE
COMMITTEES
OF
CON-
GRESS.—The term ‘‘appropriate committees 
of Congress’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the Committee on Armed Services, and the 
Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; 
and

mittee on Appropriations of the House of

(A) includes national security forces that

SEC. 3222. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China aims to 
use its growing military might in concert 
with other instruments of its national power 
to displace the United States in the Indo-Pa-
cific and establish hegemony over the re-
gion. 
(2) The military balance of power in the 
Indo-Pacific region is growing increasingly 
unfavorable to the United States because— 
(A) the PRC is rapidly modernizing and ex-
panding the capabilities of the PLA to 
project power and create contested areas 
across the entire Indo-Pacific region; 
(B) PLA modernization has largely focused 
on areas where it possesses operational ad-
vantages and can exploit weaknesses in the 
United States suite of capabilities; and 
(C) current United States force structure 
and presence do not sufficiently counter 
threats in the Indo-Pacific, as United States 
allies, bases, and forces at sea in the Indo- 
Pacific region are concentrated in large 
bases that are highly vulnerable to the 
PRC’s strike capabilities. 
(3) This shift in the regional military bal-
ance and erosion of conventional and stra-
tegic deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region— 
(A) presents a substantial and imminent 
risk to the security of the United States; and 
(B) left unchecked, could— 
(i) embolden the PRC to take actions, in-
cluding the use of military force, to change 
the status quo before the United States can 
mount an effective response; and 
(ii) alter the nuclear balance in the Indo- 
Pacific. 
(4) The PRC sees an opportunity to dimin-
ish confidence among United States allies 
and partners in the strength of United States 
commitments, even to the extent that these 
nations feel compelled to bandwagon with 
the PRC to protect their interests. The PRC 
is closely monitoring the United States reac-
tion to PRC pressure and coercion of United 
States allies, searching for indicators of 
United States resolve. 
(5) Achieving so-called ‘‘reunification’’ of 
Taiwan to mainland China is a key step for 
the PRC to achieve its regional hegemonic 
ambitions. The PRC has increased the fre-
quency and scope of its exercises and oper-
ations targeting Taiwan, such as amphibious 
assault and live-fire exercises in the Taiwan 
Strait, PLA Air Force flights that encircle 
Taiwan, and flights across the unofficial me-
dian line in the Taiwan Strait. The Govern-
ment of the PRC’s full submission of Hong 
Kong potentially accelerates the timeline of 
a Taiwan scenario, and makes the defense of 
Taiwan an even more urgent priority. 
(6) The defense of Taiwan is critical to— 
(A) defending the people of Taiwan; 
(B) limiting the PLA’s ability to project 
power beyond the First Island Chain, includ-
ing to United States territory, such as Guam 
and Hawaii; 
(C) defending the territorial integrity of 
Japan; 
(D) preventing the PLA from diverting 
military planning, resources, and personnel 
to broader military ambitions; and 
(E) retaining the United States credibility 
as a defender of the democratic values and 
free-market principles embodied by Taiwan’s 
people and government; 
(7) The PRC capitalized on the world’s at-
tention to COVID–19 to advance its military 
objectives in the South China Sea, inten-
sifying and accelerating trends already un-
derway. The PRC has sent militarized survey 
vessels into the Malaysian Exclusive Eco-
nomic Zone, announced the establishment of 
an administrative district in the Spratly and 
Paracel Islands under the Chinese local gov-
ernment of Sansha, aimed a fire control 
radar at a Philippine navy ship, encroached 
on Indonesia’s fishing grounds, sunk a Viet-
namese fishing boat, announced new ‘‘re-
search stations’’ on Fiery Cross Reef and 
Subi Reef, landed special military aircraft 
on Fiery Cross Reef to routinize such deploy-
ments, and sent a flotilla of over 200 militia 
vessels to Whitsun Reef, a feature within the 
exclusive economic zone of the Philippines. 
(8) On July 13, 2020, the Department of 
State clarified United States policy on the 
South China Sea and stated that ‘‘Beijing’s

claims to offshore resources across most of 
the South China Sea are completely unlaw-
ful’’. 
(9) These actions in the South China Sea 
enable the PLA to exert influence and 
project power deeper into Oceania and the 
Indian Ocean. As Admiral Phil Davidson, 
Commander of Indo-Pacific Command, testi-
fied in 2019, ‘‘In short, China is now capable 
of controlling the South China Sea in all sce-
narios short of war with the United States.’’. 
(10) The PLA also continues to advance its 
claims in the East China Sea, including 
through a high number of surface combatant 
patrols and frequent entry into the terri-
torial waters of the Senkaku Islands, over 
which the United States recognizes Japan’s 
administrative control. In April 2014, Presi-
dent Barack Obama stated, ‘‘Our commit-
ment to Japan’s security is absolute and ar-
ticle five of the U.S.-Japan security treaty 
covers all territory under Japan’s adminis-
tration, including the Senkaku islands.’’. 
(11) On March 1, 2019, Secretary of State 
Michael R. Pompeo stated, ‘‘As the South 
China Sea is part of the Pacific, any armed 
attack on Philippine forces, aircraft, or pub-
lic vessels in the South China Sea will trig-
ger mutual defense obligations under Article 
4 of our Mutual Defense Treaty.’’. 
(12) The PLA also continues to advance its 
influence over the Korean Peninsula, includ-
ing through a series of joint air exercises 
with the Russian Federation in the Republic 
of Korea’s Air Defense Identification Zone. 
(13) The PLA is modernizing and gaining 
critical capability in every branch and every 
domain, including— 
(A) positioning the PLA Navy to become a 
great maritime power or ‘‘blue-water’’ navy 
that can completely control all activity 
within the First Island Chain and project 
power beyond it with a fleet of 425 battle 
force ships by 2030; 
(B) increasing the size and range of its 
strike capabilities, including approximately 
1,900 
ground-launched 
short- 
and 
inter-
mediate-range missiles capable of targeting 
United States allies and partners in the First 
and Second Island chains, United States 
bases in the Indo-Pacific, and United States 
forces at sea; 
(C) boosting capabilities for air warfare, 
including with Russian-origin Su–35 fighters 
and S–400 air defense systems, new J–20 5th 
generation stealth fighters, advanced H–6 
bomber variants, a long-range stealth bomb-
er, and Y–20 heavy lift aircraft; 
(D) making critical investments in new do-
mains of warfare, such as cyber warfare, 
electronic warfare, and space warfare; and 
(E) increasing the size of its nuclear stock-
pile and delivery systems. 
(14) The PRC is pursuing this moderniza-
tion through all means at its disposal, in-
cluding its Military-Civil Fusion initiative, 
which enlists the whole of PRC society in de-
veloping and acquiring technology with mili-
tary applications to pursue technological ad-
vantage over the United States in artificial 
intelligence, hypersonic glide vehicles, di-
rected 
energy 
weapons, 
electromagnetic 
railguns, counter-space weapons, and other 
emerging capabilities. 
(15) The United States lead in the develop-
ment of science and technology relevant to 
defense is eroding in the face of competition 
from the PRC. United States research and 
development spending on defense capabilities 
has declined sharply as a share of global re-
search and development. The commercial 
sector’s leading role in innovation presents 
certain unique challenges to the Department 
of Defense’s reliance on technology for bat-
tlefield advantage. 
(16) The PRC has vastly increased domestic 
research and development expenditures, sup-
ported the growth of new cutting-edge indus-
tries and tapped into a large workforce to in-
vest in fostering science and engineering tal-
ent. 
(17) The PRC is increasing exports of de-
fense and security capabilities to build its 
defense technology and industrial base and 
improve its own military capabilities, as 
well as its influence with countries that pur-
chase and become dependent on its military 
systems. 
SEC. 3223. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
BOLSTERING SECURITY PARTNER-
SHIPS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC. 
It is the sense of Congress that steps to 
bolster United States security partnerships 
in the Indo-Pacific must include— 
(1) supporting Japan in its development of 
long-range precision fires, munitions, air and 
missile defense capacity, interoperability 
across all domains, maritime security, and 
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais-
sance capabilities; 
(2) launching a United States-Japan na-
tional security innovation fund to solicit and 
support private sector cooperation for new 
technologies that could benefit the United 
States and Japan’s mutual security objec-
tives; 
(3) promoting a deeper defense relationship 
between Japan and Australia, including sup-
porting reciprocal access agreements and tri-
lateral United States-Japan-Australia intel-
ligence sharing; 
(4) encouraging and facilitating Taiwan’s 
accelerated acquisition of asymmetric de-
fense capabilities, which are crucial to de-
fending the islands of Taiwan from invasion, 
including long-range precision fires, muni-
tions, anti-ship missiles, coastal defense, 
anti-armor, air defense, undersea warfare, 
advanced command, control, communica-
tions, computers, intelligence, surveillance 
and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and resilient 
command and control capabilities, and in-
creasing the conduct of relevant and prac-
tical training and exercises with Taiwan’s 
defense forces; and 
(5) prioritizing building the capacity of 
United States allies and partners to protect 
defense technology. 
SEC. 3224. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

United States foreign policy, and prioritize 
resources for achieving United States polit-
ical and military objectives in the region;

international waters and airspace in the 
Indo-Pacific maritime domains, which are

gies; 
(4) strengthen and deepen the alliances and 
partnerships of the United States to build 
capacity and capabilities, increase multilat-
eral partnerships, modernize communica-
tions architecture, address anti-access and 
area denial challenges, and increase joint ex-
ercises and security cooperation efforts; 
(5) reaffirm the commitment and support 
of the United States for allies and partners 
in the Indo-Pacific region, including long-
standing United States policy regarding—

attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or pub-
lic vessels in the South China Sea will trig-
ger mutual defense obligations under Article 
IV of our mutual defense treaty; 
(D) Article IV of the Australia, New Zea-
land, United States Security Treaty, done at 
San Francisco September 1, 1951; and

Treaty, done at Manila September 8, 1954, to-
gether with the Thanat-Rusk Communique 
of 1962; 
(6) collaborate with United States treaty 
allies in the Indo-Pacific to foster greater 
multilateral security and defense coopera-
tion with other regional partners; 
(7) ensure the continuity of operations by 
the United States Armed Forces in the Indo- 
Pacific region, including, as appropriate, in 
cooperation with partners and allies, in 
order to reaffirm the principle of freedom of 
operations in international waters and air-
space in accordance with established prin-
ciples and practices of international law; 
(8) sustain the Taiwan Relations Act (Pub-
lic Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the 
‘‘Six Assurances’’ provided by the United 
States to Taiwan in July 1982 as the founda-
tions for United States-Taiwan relations, 
and to deepen, to the fullest extent possible,

is willing to deny them the ability to achieve 
their objectives, including by— 
(A) consistently demonstrating the polit-
ical will of the United States to deepening 
existing treaty alliances and growing new 
partnerships as a durable, asymmetric, and 
unmatched strategic advantage to the PRC’s 
growing military capabilities and reach; 
(B) maintaining a system of forward-de-
ployed bases in the Indo-Pacific region as the 
most visible sign of United States resolve 
and commitment to the region, and as plat-
forms to ensure United States operational 
readiness and advance interoperability with 
allies and partners; 
(C) adopting a more dispersed force posture 
throughout the region, particularly the

States ability to operate; 
(E) strengthening extended deterrence to 
ensure that escalation against key United 
States interests would be costly, risky, and 
self-defeating; and

SEC. 3230. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON MARITIME 
FREEDOM 
OF 
OPERATIONS 
IN 
INTERNATIONAL WATERWAYS AND 
AIRSPACE 
OF 
THE 
INDO-PACIFIC 
AND 
ON 
ARTIFICIAL 
LAND 
FEA-
TURES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—Congress— 
(1) condemns coercive and threatening ac-
tions or the use of force to impede freedom of

quo, or to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region; 
(2) urges the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China to refrain from imple-
menting the declared East China Sea Air De-
fense Identification Zone (ADIZ), or an ADIZ 
in the South China Sea, which is contrary to 
freedom of overflight in international air-
space, and to refrain from taking similar 
provocative actions elsewhere in the Indo- 
Pacific region;

People’s Republic of China’s claims to off-
shore resources across most of the South 
China Sea are unlawful; and 
(4) condemns the People’s Republic of 
China for failing to abide by the 2016 Perma-
nent Court of Arbitration ruling, despite the 
PRC’s obligations as a state party to the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States to— 
(1) reaffirm its commitment and support 
for allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion, including longstanding United States 
policy regarding Article V of the United 
States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty 
and reaffirm its position that Article V of 
the United States-Japan Mutual Defense 
Treaty applies to the Japanese-administered 
Senkaku Islands; 
(2) oppose claims that impinge on the 
rights, freedoms, and lawful use of the sea, 
or the airspace above it, that belong to all 
nations, and oppose the militarization of new 
and reclaimed land features in the South 
China Sea; 
(3) continue certain policies with respect 
to the PRC claims in the South China Sea, 
namely— 
(A) that PRC claims in the South China 
Sea, including to offshore resources across 
most of the South China Sea, are unlawful; 
(B) that the PRC cannot lawfully assert a 
maritime claim vis-a`-vis the Philippines in 
areas that the Permanent Court of Arbitra-
tion found to be in the Philippines’ Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) or on its continental 
shelf; 
(C) to reject any PRC claim to waters be-
yond a 12 nautical mile territorial sea de-
rived from islands it claims in the Spratly 
Islands; and 
(D) that the PRC has no lawful territorial 
or maritime claim to James Shoal; 
(4) urge all parties to refrain from engag-
ing in destabilizing activities, including ille-
gal occupation or efforts to unlawfully assert 
administration over disputed claims; 
(5) ensure that disputes are managed with-
out intimidation, coercion, or force; 
(6) call on all claimants to clarify or adjust 
claims in accordance with international law; 
(7) uphold the principle that territorial and 
maritime 
claims, 
including 
territorial 
waters or territorial seas, must be derived 
from land features and otherwise comport 
with international law; 
(8) oppose the imposition of new fishing 
regulations covering disputed areas in the 
South China Sea, regulations which have 
raised tensions in the region; 
(9) support an effective Code of Conduct, if 
that Code of Conduct reflects the interests of 
Southeast Asian claimant states and does 
not serve as a vehicle for the People’s Repub-
lic of China to advance its unlawful mari-
time claims; 
(10) reaffirm that an existing body of inter-
national rules and guidelines, including the 
International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 
1972 (COLREGs), is sufficient to ensure the 
safety of navigation between the United 
States Armed Forces and the forces of other 
countries, including the People’s Republic of 
China; 
(11) support the development of regional 
institutions 
and 
bodies, 
including 
the 
ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN De-
fense Minister’s Meeting Plus, the East Asia 
Summit, and the expanded ASEAN Maritime 
Forum, to build practical cooperation in the 
region and reinforce the role of international 
law; 
(12) encourage the deepening of partner-
ships with other countries in the region for 
maritime domain awareness and capacity 
building, as well as efforts by the United 
States Government to explore the develop-
ment of appropriate multilateral mecha-
nisms for a ‘‘common operating picture’’ in 
the South China Sea among Southeast Asian 
countries that would serve to help countries 
avoid destabilizing behavior and deter risky 
and dangerous activities; 
(13) oppose actions by any country to pre-
vent any other country from exercising its 
sovereign rights to the resources of the ex-
clusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental 
shelf by making claims to those areas in the 
South China Sea that have no support in 
international law; and 
(14) assure the continuity of operations by 
the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, 
including, when appropriate, in cooperation 
with partners and allies, to reaffirm the 
principle of freedom of operations in inter-
national waters and airspace in accordance 
with established principles and practices of 
international law.

People’s Republic of China is also utilizing 
the BRI to advance its own security inter-
ests, including to expand its power projec-
tion capabilities and facilitate greater access 
for the People’s Liberation Army through 
overseas military installations; and 
(2) the expansion of the People’s Liberation 
Army globally through overseas military in-
stallations will undermine the medium- and 
long-term security of the United States and

which is at odds with United States goals to 
promote peace, prosperity, and self-reliance 
among partner nations, including through 
the Millennium Challenge Corporation. 
(b) LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE.—Except as 
provided in subsection (c), for fiscal years 
2022 through 2031, the government of a coun-

eration Army for purposes other than par-
ticipating in United Nations peacekeeping 
operations or for temporary humanitarian, 
medical, and disaster relief operations in 
such country shall not be eligible for assist-
ance under sections 609 or 616 of the Millen-

economic practices as a means of political 
and economic coercion in the Indo-Pacific 
region and beyond; 
(E) to promote the values of democracy 
and human rights, including through efforts

political 
dissidents, 
Uyghurs, and other ethnic Muslim minori-
ties, Tibetan Buddhists, Christians, and 
other minorities; 
(F) to respond to the crackdown by the 
Chinese Communist Party, in contravention 
of the commitments made under the Sino- 
British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the 
Basic Law of Hong Kong, on the legitimate 
aspirations of the people of Hong Kong; and 
(G) to counter the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s efforts to spread disinformation in the

and connectivity issues, trade and commer-
cial relations, bilateral legal matters, and 
support for democracy, good governance, and

challenges, 
including 
pandemics, energy security, and environ-
mental stewardship; 
(4) the United States and Canada should 
enhance cooperation to counter Chinese

nomic espionage, and propaganda efforts; 
(5) the People’s Republic of China’s infra-
structure investments, particularly in 5G 
telecommunications technology, extraction 
of natural resources, and port infrastructure, 
pose national security risks for the United 
States and Canada;

propriate, intelligence gathered regarding—

continue to advance collaborative initiatives

lic of China’s apparent arbitrary detention 
and abusive treatment of Canadian nationals 
Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in appar-
ent retaliation for the Government of Can-
ada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou is deeply con-
cerning;

international leadership by—

plying with its international legal obliga-
tions, including those pursuant to the Extra-
dition Treaty Between the United States of

December 3, 1971; and 
(B) launching the Declaration Against Ar-
bitrary Detention in State-to-State Rela-
tions, which has been endorsed by 57 coun-
tries and the European Union, and reaffirms 
well-established prohibitions under inter-
national human rights conventions against 
the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals 
to be used as leverage in state-to-state rela-
tions; and 
(3) the United States continues to join the 
Government of Canada in calling for the im-
mediate release of Michael Spavor and Mi-

PART II—TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE 
SEC. 3255. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TRANS-
ATLANTIC ALLIANCE. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States, European Union, and 
European countries are close partners, shar-
ing values grounded in democracy, human 
rights, transparency, and the rules-based 
international order established after World 
War II; 
(2) without a common approach by the 
United States, European Union, and Euro-
pean 
countries 
on 
connectivity, 
trade, 
transnational problems, and support for de-
mocracy and human rights, the People’s Re-
public of China will continue to increase its 
economic, political, and security leverage in 
Europe; 
(3) the People’s Republic of China’s deploy-
ment of assistance to European countries 
following the COVID–19 outbreak showcased 
a coercive approach to aid, but it also high-
lighted Europe’s deep economic ties to the 
People’s Republic of China; 
(4) as European states seek to recover from 
the economic toll of the COVID–19 outbreak, 
the United States must stand in partnership 
with Europe to support our collective eco-
nomic recovery, reinforce our collective na-
tional security, and defend shared values; 
(5) the United States, European Union, and 
European countries should coordinate on 
joint strategies to diversify reliance on sup-
ply chains away from the People’s Republic 
of China, especially in the medical and phar-
maceutical sectors; 
(6) the United States, European Union, and 
European countries should leverage their re-
spective economic innovation capabilities to 
support the global economic recovery from 
the COVID–19 recession and draw a contrast 
with the centralized economy of the People’s 
Republic of China; 
(7) the United States, United Kingdom, and 
European Union should accelerate efforts to 
de-escalate their trade disputes, including 
negotiating a United States-European Union 
trade agreement that benefits workers and 
the broader economy in both the United 
States and European Union; 
(8) the United States, European Union, and 
Japan should continue trilateral efforts to 
address economic challenges posed by the 
People’s Republic of China; 
(9) the United States, European Union, and 
countries of Europe should enhance coopera-
tion to counter PRC disinformation, influ-
ence operations, and propaganda efforts; 
(10) the United States and European na-
tions share serious concerns with the repres-
sions being supported and executed by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, and should continue implementing 
measures to address the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China’s specific abuses 
in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, and 
should build joint mechanisms and programs 
to prevent the export of China’s authori-
tarian governance model to countries around 
the world; 
(11) the United States and European na-
tions should remain united in their shared 
values against attempts by the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China at the 
United Nations and other multilateral orga-
nizations to promote efforts that erode the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, like 
the ‘‘community of a shared future for man-
kind’’ and ‘‘democratization of international 
relations’’; 
(12) the People’s Republic of China’s infra-
structure investments around the world, par-
ticularly in 5G telecommunications tech-
nology and port infrastructure, could threat-
en democracy across Europe and the na-
tional security of key countries; 
(13) as appropriate, the United States 
should share intelligence with European al-
lies and partners on Huawei’s 5G capabilities 
and the intentions of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China with respect to 
5G expansion in Europe; 
(14) the European Union’s Investment 
Screening Regulation, which came into force 
in October 2020, is a welcome development, 
and member states should closely scrutinize 
PRC investments in their countries through 
their own national investment screening 
measures; 
(15) the President should actively engage 
the European Union on the implementation 
of the Export Control Reform Act regula-
tions and to better harmonize United States 
and European Union policies with respect to 
export controls; 
(16) the President should strongly advocate 
for the listing of more items and tech-
nologies to restrict dual use exports con-
trolled at the National Security and above 
level to the People’s Republic of China under 
the Wassenaar Arrangement;

(17) the United States should explore the 
value of establishing a body akin to the Co-
ordinating Committee for Multilateral Ex-
port Controls (CoCom) that would specifi-
cally coordinate United States and European 
Union export control policies with respect to 
limiting exports of sensitive technologies to 
the People’s Republic of China; and 
(18) the United States should work with 
counterparts in Europe to— 
(A) evaluate United States and European 
overreliance on goods originating in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, including in the 
medical and pharmaceutical sectors, and de-
velop joint strategies to diversify supply 
chains; 
(B) counter PRC efforts to use COVID–19- 
related assistance as a coercive tool to pres-
sure developing countries by offering rel-
evant United States and European expertise 
and assistance; and 
(C) leverage the United States and Euro-
pean private sectors to advance the post-

June 10, 2021 
the Secretary of State shall brief the appro-
priate committees of Congress on the feasi-
bility and advisability of establishing a 
United States-based public-private sponsored 
security dialogue (to be known as the ‘‘Oce-
ania Security Dialogue’’) among the coun-
tries of Oceania for the purposes of jointly 
exploring and discussing issues affecting the 
economic, diplomatic, and national security 
of the Indo-Pacific countries of Oceania. 
(b) REPORT
REQUIRED.—The briefing re-
quired by subsection (a) shall, at a min-
imum, include the following: 
(1) A review of the ability of the Depart-
ment of State to participate in a public-pri-
vate sponsored security dialogue.

ania Security Dialogue with participation 
and support of the Department of State as 
described in subsection (a). 
(6) An analysis of how an Oceania Security 
Dialogue could help to advance the Boe Dec-
laration on Regional Security, including its 
emphasis on the changing environment as

SEC. 3295. REPORT ON COUNTERING ILLEGAL, 
UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED 
FISHING IN OCEANIA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) many countries of the Oceania region 
depend on commercial tuna fisheries as a 
critical component of their economies; 
(2) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has used its licensed fishing fleet 
to exert greater influence in Oceania, but at 
the same time, its licensed fishing fleet is 
also a major contributor to illegal, unre-
ported, and unregulated fishing (in this sec-
tion referred to as ‘‘IUU fishing’’) activities; 
(3) the sustainability of Oceania’s fisheries 
is threatened by IUU fishing, which depletes 
both commercially important fish stocks 
and non-targeted species that help maintain 
the integrity of the ocean ecosystem; 
(4) in addition, IUU fishing puts pressure 
on protected species of marine mammals, sea 
turtles, and sea birds, which also jeopardizes 
the integrity of the ocean ecosystem; 
(5) further, because IUU fishing goes unre-
corded, the loss of biomass compromises sci-
entists’ work to assess and model fishery 
stocks and advise managers on sustainable 
catch levels; 
(6) beyond the damage to living marine re-
sources, IUU fishing also contributes di-
rectly to illegal activity in the Oceania re-
gion, such as food fraud, smuggling, and 
human trafficking; 
(7) current approaches to IUU fishing en-
forcement rely on established methods, such 
as vessel monitoring systems, logbooks 
maintained by government fisheries enforce-
ment authorities to record the catches land-
ed by fishing vessels, and corroborating data 
on catches hand-collected by human observer 
programs; 
(8) such established methods are imperfect 
because— 
(A) vessels can turn off monitoring sys-
tems and unlicensed vessels do not use them; 
and 
(B) observer coverage is thin and subject to 
human error and corruption; 
(9) maritime domain awareness technology 
solutions for vessel monitoring have gained 
credibility in recent years and include sys-
tems such as observing instruments deployed 
on satellites, crewed and uncrewed air and 
surface systems, aircraft, and surface ves-
sels, as well as electronic monitoring sys-
tems on fishing vessels; 
(10) maritime domain awareness tech-
nologies hold the promise of significantly 
augmenting the current IUU fishing enforce-
ment capacities; and 
(11) maritime domain awareness tech-
nologies offer an avenue for addressing key 
United States national interests, including 
those interests related to— 
(A) increasing bilateral diplomatic ties 
with key allies and partners in the Oceania 
region; 
(B) countering illicit trafficking in arms, 
narcotics, and human beings associated with 
IUU fishing; 
(C) advancing security, long-term growth, 
and development in the Oceania region; 
(D) supporting ocean conservation objec-
tives; 
(E) reducing food insecurity; and 
(F) countering attempts by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to 
grow its influence in the Oceania region. 
(b) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with 
the Administrator of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, the Com-
mandant of the Coast Guard, and the Sec-
retary of Defense, shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees a report as-
sessing the use of advanced maritime domain 
awareness technology systems to combat 
IUU fishing in Oceania. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include— 
(A) a review of the effectiveness of existing 
monitoring 
technologies, 
including 
elec-
tronic monitoring systems, to combat IUU 
fishing; 
(B) recommendations for effectively inte-
grating effective monitoring technologies 
into a Oceania-wide strategy for IUU fishing 
enforcement; 
(C) an assessment and recommendations 
for the secure and reliable processing of data 
from such monitoring technologies, includ-
ing the security and verification issues; 
(D) the technical and financial capacity of 
countries of the Oceania region to deploy 
and maintain large-scale use of maritime do-
main awareness technological systems for 
the purposes of combating IUU fishing and 
supporting fisheries resource management; 
(E) a review of the technical and financial 
capacity of regional organizations and inter-
national structures to support countries of 
the Oceania region in the deployment and 
maintenance of large-scale use of maritime 
domain awareness technology systems for 
the purposes of combating IUU fishing and 
supporting fisheries resource management; 
(F) an evaluation of the utility of using 
foreign assistance, security assistance, and 
development assistance provided by the 
United States to countries of the Oceania re-
gion to support the large-scale deployment 
and operations of maritime domain aware-
ness systems to increase maritime security 
across the region; and 
(G) an assessment of the role of large-scale 
deployment and operations of maritime do-
main awareness systems throughout Oceania 
to supporting United States economic and 
national security interests in the Oceania re-
gion, including efforts related to countering 
IUU fishing, improving maritime security, 
and countering malign foreign influence. 
SEC. 3296. OCEANIA PEACE CORPS PARTNER-
SHIPS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act,

of— 
(1) expanding the presence of the Peace 
Corps to all currently feasible locations in 
Oceania; and

with 
regional 
and 
inter-
national partners of the United States to ex-
pand the presence of Peace Corps volunteers 
in low-income Oceania communities in sup-
port of climate resilience initiatives. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The report required by sub-
section (a) shall— 
(1) assess the factors contributing to the 
current absence of the Peace Corps and its 
volunteers in Oceania; 
(2) examine potential remedies that in-
clude working with United States Govern-
ment agencies and regional governments, in-
cluding governments of United States al-
lies— 
(A) to increase the health infrastructure 
and medical evacuation capabilities of the 
countries of Oceania to better support the 
safety of Peace Corps volunteers while in 
those countries; 
(B) to address physical safety concerns 
that have decreased the ability of the Peace 
Corps to operate in Oceania; and 
(C) to increase transportation infrastruc-
ture in the countries of Oceania to better 
support the travel of Peace Corps volunteers 
and their access to necessary facilities; 
(3) evaluate the potential to expand the de-
ployment of Peace Corps Response volun-
teers to help the countries of Oceania ad-
dress social, economic, and development 
needs of their communities that require spe-
cific professional expertise; and 
(4) explore potential new operational mod-
els to address safety and security needs of 
Peace Corps volunteers in the countries of 
Oceania, including— 
(A) changes to volunteer deployment dura-
tions; and 
(B) scheduled redeployment of volunteers 
to 
regional 
or 
United 
States-based 
healthcare facilities for routine physical and 
behavioral health evaluation.

June 10, 2021 
SEC. 3307. UNITED STATES POLICY AND INTER-
NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT ON THE 
SUCCESSION 
OR 
REINCARNATION 
OF THE DALAI LAMA AND RELI-
GIOUS FREEDOM OF TIBETAN BUD-
DHISTS. 
(a) REAFFIRMATION
OF POLICY.—It is the 
policy of the United States, as provided 
under section 342(b) of division FF of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub-
lic Law 116–260), that any ‘‘interference by 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China or any other government in the proc-
ess of recognizing a successor or reincarna-
tion of the 14th Dalai Lama and any future 
Dalai Lamas would represent a clear abuse of 
the right to religious freedom of Tibetan 
Buddhists and the Tibetan people’’. 
(b) INTERNATIONAL
EFFORTS
TO
PROTECT 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF TIBETAN BUDDHISTS.— 
The Secretary of State should engage with 
United States allies and partners to— 
(1) support Tibetan Buddhist religious 
leaders’ sole religious authority to identify 
and install the 15th Dalai Lama; 
(2) oppose claims by the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China that the PRC has 
the authority to decide for Tibetan Bud-
dhists the 15th Dalai Lama; and 
(3) reject interference by the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China in the reli-
gious freedom of Tibetan Buddhists. 
SEC. 3308. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TREATMENT 
OF UYGHURS AND OTHER ETHNIC 
MINORITIES 
IN 
THE 
XINJIANG 
UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Uyghurs are one of several pre-
dominantly Muslim Turkic groups living in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
(XUAR) in the northwest of the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). 
(2) Following Uyghur demonstrations and 
unrest in 2009 and clashes with government 
security personnel and other violent inci-
dents in subsequent years, PRC leaders 
sought to ‘‘stabilize’’ the XUAR through 
large-scale arrests and extreme security 
measures, under the pretext of combatting 
alleged terrorism, religious extremism, and 
ethnic separatism. 
(3) In May 2014, the PRC launched its 
‘‘Strike Hard Against Violent Extremism’’ 
campaign, which placed further restrictions 
on and facilitated additional human rights 
violations against minorities in the XUAR 
under the pretext of fighting terrorism. 
(4) In August 2016, Chinese Communist 
Party 
(CCP) 
Politburo 
member 
Chen 
Quanguo, former Tibet Autonomous Region 
(TAR) Party Secretary, known for over-
seeing intensifying security operations and 
human rights abuses in the TAR, was ap-
pointed as Party Secretary of the XUAR. 
(5) Beginning in 2017, XUAR authorities 
have 
sought 
to 
forcibly 
‘‘assimilate’’ 
Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities into 
Chinese society through a policy of cultural 
erasure known as ‘‘Sinicization’’. 
(6) Since 2018, credible reporting including 
from the BBC, France24, and the New York 
Times has shown that the Government of the 
PRC has built mass internment camps in the 
XUAR, which it calls ‘‘vocational training’’ 
centers, and detained Uyghurs and other 
groups in them and other facilities. 
(7) Since 2015, XUAR authorities have arbi-
trarily 
detained 
an 
estimated 
1,500,000 
Uyghurs—12.5 percent of the XUAR’s official 
Uyghur population of 12,000,000—and a small-
er number of other ethnic minorities in the 
‘‘vocational training’’ centers and other de-
tention and pre-detention facilities. 
(8) In 2017, the XUAR accounted for less 
than two percent of the PRC’s total popu-
lation but 21 percent of all arrests in China. 
(9) The Atlantic, Radio Free Asia, and 
other sources have revealed that detainees 
are forced to renounce many of their Islamic 
beliefs and customs and repudiate Uyghur 
culture, language, and identity. 
(10) Investigations by Human Rights Watch 
and other human rights organizations have 
documented how detainees are subject to po-
litical indoctrination, forced labor, crowded 
and unsanitary conditions, involuntary bio-
metric data collection, both medical neglect 
and intrusive medical interventions, food 
and water deprivation, beatings, sexual vio-
lence, and torture. 
(11) Research by the Australian Strategic 
Policy Institute suggests that, since late 
2019, many detainees have been placed in 
higher security facilities and convicted of 
formal crimes. 
(12) Human Rights Watch has reported that 
the PRC uses data collection programs, in-
cluding facial recognition technology, to 
surveil Uyghurs in the XUAR and to identify 
individuals whom authorities may detain. 
(13) PRC authorities have placed countless 
children whose parents are detained or in 
exile in state-run institutions and boarding 
schools without the consent of their parents. 
(14) New York Times reporting revealed 
that numerous local PRC officials who did 
not agree with the policies carried out in 
XUAR have been fired and imprisoned. 
(15) Associated Press reporting documented 
widespread and systemic efforts by PRC au-
thorities to force Uyghur women to take 
contraceptives or to subject them to steri-
lization or abortion, threatening to detain 
those who do not comply. 
(16) PRC authorities prohibit family mem-
bers and advocates inside and outside China 
from having regular communications with 
relatives and friends imprisoned in the 
XUAR, such as journalist and entrepreneur 
Ekpar Asat. 
(17) PRC authorities have imposed perva-
sive restrictions on the peaceful practice of 
Islam in the XUAR, to the extent that 
Human Rights Watch asserts the PRC ‘‘has 
effectively outlawed the practice of Islam’’. 
(18) Individuals who are not detained in 
camps have been forced to attend political 
indoctrination sessions, subjected to move-
ment restrictions, mass surveillance sys-
tems, involuntary biometric data collection, 
and other human rights abuses. 
(19) International media, nongovernmental 
organizations, scholars, families, and sur-
vivors have reported on the systemic nature 
of many of these abuses. 
(20) On June 26, 2020, a group of 50 inde-
pendent United Nations experts jointly ex-
pressed alarm over China’s deteriorating 
human rights record, including its repression 
in Xinjiang, and called on the international 
community ‘‘to act collectively and deci-
sively to ensure China respects human rights 
and abides by its international obligations’’. 
(21) On October 6, 2020, 39 United Nations 
member countries issued a public statement 
condemning human rights violations by PRC 
authorities and calling on the PRC to allow 
the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights unfettered access to Xinjiang. 
(22) The United States Congress passed the 
Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 
(Public Law 116–145). 
(23) The United States Congress passed the 
Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public 
Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note), which has 
been used to sanction PRC officials and enti-
ties for their activities in the XUAR. 
(24) The United States Government has im-
plemented additional targeted restrictions 
on trade with Xinjiang and imposed visa and 
economic sanctions on PRC officials and en-
tities for their activities in the XUAR. 
(25) The United States Government has 
documented human rights abuses and viola-
tions of individual freedoms in the XUAR, 
including in the 2019 Department of State 
Report on International Religious Freedom. 
(26) On January 19, 2021, then-Secretary of 
State Michael Pompeo ‘‘determined that the 
PRC, under the direction and control of the 
CCP, has committed genocide against the 
predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang’’. 
(27) On January 19, 2021, during his con-
firmation 
hearing, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony Blinken testified that ‘‘forcing men, 
women, and children into concentration 
camps, trying to in effect reeducate them to 
be adherents to the Chinese Communist 
Party—all of that speaks to an effort to com-
mit genocide’’. 
(28) On January 19, 2021, Secretary of the 
Treasury Janet L. Yellen, during her con-
firmation 
hearing, 
publicly 
stated 
that 
China is guilty of ‘‘horrendous human rights 
abuses’’. 
(29) On January 27, 2021, in response to a 
question 
from 
the 
press 
regarding 
the 
Uyghurs, Secretary Blinken stated that his 
‘‘judgement remains that genocide was com-
mitted against the Uyghurs’’. 
(30) On March 10, 2021, in response to a 
question on Xinjiang during his testimony 
before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives, Secretary 
Blinken reiterated, ‘‘We’ve been clear, and 
I’ve been clear, that I see it as genocide, 
other egregious abuses of human rights, and 
we’ll continue to make that clear.’’. 
(31) The 2020 Department of State Country 
Reports on Human Rights Practices: China 
states that ‘‘[g]enocide and crimes against 
humanity occurred during the year against 
the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and 
other ethnic and religious minority groups 
in Xinjiang’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the atrocities committed by the CCP 
against Uyghurs and other predominantly 
Muslim Turkic groups in Xinjiang, including 
forced labor, sexual violence, the internment 
of over 1,000,000 individuals, and other hor-
rific abuses must be condemned; 
(2) the President, the Secretary of State, 
and the United States Ambassador to the 
United Nations should speak publicly about 
the ongoing human rights abuses in the 
XUAR, including in formal speeches at the 
United Nations and other international fora; 
(3) the President, the Secretary of State, 
and the United States Ambassador to the 
United Nations should appeal to the United 
Nations Secretary-General to take a more 
proactive and public stance on the situation 
in the XUAR, including by supporting calls 
for an investigation and accountability for 
individuals and entities involved in abuses 
against the people of the XUAR; 
(4) the United States should continue to 
use targeted sanctions and all diplomatic 
tools available to hold those responsible for 
the atrocities in Xinjiang to account; 
(5) United States agencies engaged with 
China on trade, climate, defense, or other bi-
lateral issues should include human rights 
abuses in the XUAR as a consideration in de-
veloping United States policy; 
(6) the United States supports Radio Free 
Asia Uyghur, the only Uyghur-language news 
service in the world independent of Chinese 
government influence; and 
(7) the United States recognizes the re-
peated requests from the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
unfettered access to the XUAR and the 
PRC’s refusal to comply, and therefore— 
(A) PRC authorities must allow unfettered 
access by the United Nations Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to the 
XUAR;

(B) the United States should urge collabo-
rative action between the United States Gov-
ernment and international partners to pres-
sure PRC authorities to allow unfettered ac-
cess to the XUAR; 
(C) the President, the Secretary of State,

TITLE IV—INVESTING IN OUR ECONOMIC 
STATECRAFT 
SEC. 3401. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS 
REGARDING THE PRC’S INDUSTRIAL 
POLICY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China, at the 
direction of the Chinese Communist Party, is 
advancing an ecosystem of anticompetitive 
economic and industrial policies that— 
(A) distort global markets; 
(B) limit innovation; 
(C) unfairly advantage PRC firms at the 
expense of the United States and other for-
eign firms; and 
(D) unfairly and harmfully prejudice con-
sumer choice. 
(2) Of the extensive and systemic economic 
and industrial policies pursued by the PRC, 
the mass subsidization of PRC firms, intel-
lectual property theft, and forced technology 
transfer are among the most damaging to 
the global economy. 
(3) Through regulatory interventions and 
direct financial subsidies, the CCP, for the 
purposes of advancing national political and 
economic objectives, directs, coerces, and in-
fluences in anti-competitive ways the com-
mercial activities of firms that are directed, 
financed, influenced, or otherwise controlled 
by the state, including state-owned enter-
prises, and ostensibly independent and pri-
vate Chinese companies, such as technology 
firms in strategic sectors. 
(4) The PRC Government, at the national 
and subnational levels, grants special privi-
leges or status to certain PRC firms in key 
sectors designated as strategic, such as tele-
communications, oil, power, aviation, bank-
ing, and semiconductors. Enterprises receive 
special state preferences in the form of fa-
vorable loans, tax exemptions, and pref-
erential land access from the CCP. 
(5) The subsidization of PRC companies, as 
described in paragraphs (3) and (4)— 
(A) enables these companies to sell goods 
below market prices, allowing them to out-
bid and crowd out market-based competitors 
and thereby pursue global dominance of key 
sectors; 
(B) distorts the global market economy by 
undermining longstanding and generally ac-
cepted market-based principles of fair com-
petition, leading to barriers to entry and 
forced exit from the market for foreign or 
private firms, not only in the PRC, but in 
markets around the world; 
(C) creates government-sponsored or sup-
ported de facto monopolies, cartels, and 
other anti-market arrangements in key sec-
tors, limiting or removing opportunities for 
other firms; and 
(D) leads to, as a result of the issues de-
scribed in paragraphs (A) through (C), de-
clines in profits and revenue needed by for-
eign and private firms for research and de-
velopment. 
(6) The CCP incentivizes and empowers 
PRC actors to steal critical technologies and 
trade secrets from private and foreign com-
petitors operating in the PRC and around 
the world, particularly in areas that the CCP 
has identified as critical to advancing PRC 
objectives. The PRC, as directed by the CCP, 
also continues to implement anti-competi-
tive regulations, policies, and practices that 
coerce the handover of technology and other 
propriety or sensitive data from foreign en-
terprises to domestic firms in exchange for 
access to the PRC market. 
(7) Companies in the United States and in 
foreign countries compete with state-sub-
sidized PRC companies that enjoy the pro-
tection and power of the state in third-coun-
try markets around the world. The advan-
tages granted to PRC firms, combined with 
significant restrictions to accessing the PRC 
market itself, severely hamper the ability of 
United States and foreign firms to compete, 
innovate, and pursue the provision of best 
value to customers. The result is an unbal-
anced playing field. Such an unsustainable 
course, if not checked, will over time lead to 
depressed competition around the world, re-
duced opportunity, and harm to both pro-
ducers and consumers. 
(8) As stated in the United States Trade 
Representative’s investigation of the PRC’s 
trade practices under section 301 of the 
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411), conducted 
in March 2018, ‘‘When U.S. companies are de-
prived of fair returns on their investment in 
IP, they are unable to achieve the growth 
necessary to reinvest in innovation. In this 
sense, China’s technology transfer regime di-
rectly burdens the innovation ecosystem 
that is an engine of economic growth in the 
United States and similarly-situated econo-
mies.’’. 
(9) In addition to forced technology trans-
fers described in this subsection, the United 
States Trade Representative’s investigation 
of the PRC under section 301 of the Trade 
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) also identified re-
quirements that foreign firms license prod-
ucts at less than market value, government- 
directed and government-subsidized acquisi-
tion of sensitive technology for strategic 
purposes, and cyber theft as other key PRC 
technology and industrial policies that are 
unreasonable and discriminatory. These poli-
cies place at risk United States intellectual 
property rights, innovation and techno-
logical development, and jobs in dozens of in-
dustries. 
(10) Other elements of the PRC’s ecosystem 
of industrial policies that harm innovation 
and distort global markets include— 
(A) advancement of policies that encourage 
local production over imports; 
(B) continuation of policies that favor 
unique technical standards in use by PRC 
firms rather than globally accepted stand-
ards, which often force foreign firms to alter 
their products and manufacturing chains to 
compete; 
(C) requirements that foreign companies 
disclose proprietary information to qualify 
for the adoption of their standards for use in 
the PRC domestic market; and 
(D) maintenance of closed procurement 
processes, which limit participation by for-
eign firms, including by setting terms that 
require such firms to use domestic suppliers, 
transfer know-how to firms in the PRC, and 
disclose proprietary information. 
(11) The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and 
associated industry-specific efforts under 
this initiative, such as the Digital Silk Road, 
are key vectors to advance the PRC’s mer-
cantilist policies and practices globally. The 
resulting challenges do not only affect 
United States firms. As the European Cham-
ber of Commerce reported in a January 2020 
report, the combination of concessional lend-
ing to PRC state-owned enterprises, non-
transparent procurement and bidding proc-
esses, closed digital standards, and other fac-
tors severely limit European and other par-
ticipation in BRI and make ‘‘competition 
[with PRC companies] in third-country mar-
kets extremely challenging’’. This under-
scores a key objective of BRI, which is to en-
sure the reliance of infrastructure, digital 
technologies, and other important goods on 
PRC supply chains and technical standards. 
(12) On January 9, 2021, the Ministry of 
Commerce of the PRC issued Order No. 1 of 
2021, entitled ‘‘Rules on Counteracting Un-
justified Extraterritorial Application of For-
eign Legislation and other Measures’’, which 
establishes a blocking regime in response to 
foreign sanctions on Chinese individuals and 
entities. That order allows the Government 
of the PRC to designate specific foreign laws 
as ‘‘unjustified extraterritorial application 
of foreign legislation’’ and to prohibit com-
pliance with such foreign laws. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the challenges presented by a non-
market economy like the PRC’s economy, 
which has captured such a large share of 
global economic exchange, are in many ways 
unprecedented and require sufficiently ele-
vated and sustained long-term focus and en-
gagement; 
(2) in order to truly address the most detri-
mental aspects of CCP-directed mercantilist 
economic strategy, the United States must 
adopt policies that— 
(A) expose the full scope and scale of intel-
lectual property theft and mass subsidiza-
tion of Chinese firms, and the resulting harm 
to the United States, foreign markets, and 
the global economy; 
(B) ensure that PRC companies face costs 
and consequences for anticompetitive behav-
ior; 
(C) provide options for affected United 
States persons to address and respond to un-
reasonable and discriminatory CCP-directed 
industrial policies; and

(D) strengthen the protection of critical 
technology and sensitive data, while still 
fostering an environment that provides in-
centives for innovation and competition; 
(3) the United States must work with its 
allies and partners through the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), the World Trade Organization, and 
other venues and fora— 
(A) to reinforce long-standing generally ac-
cepted principles of fair competition and 
market behavior and address the PRC’s anti-
competitive economic and industrial policies 
that undermine decades of global growth and 
innovation; 
(B) to ensure that the PRC is not granted 
the same treatment as that of a free-market 
economy until it ceases the implementation 
of laws, regulations, policies, and practices 
that provide unfair advantage to PRC firms 
in furtherance of national objectives and im-
pose unreasonable, discriminatory, and ille-
gal burdens on market-based international 
commerce; and 
(C) to align policies with respect to curbing 
state-directed subsidization of the private 
sector, such as advocating for global rules 
related to transparency and adherence to no-
tification requirements, including through 
the efforts currently being advanced by the 
United States, Japan, and the European 
Union; 
(4) the United States and its allies and 
partners must collaborate to provide incen-
tives to their respective companies to co-
operate in areas such as— 
(A) advocating for protection of intellec-
tual property rights in markets around the 
world; 
(B) fostering open technical standards; and 
(C) increasing joint investments in over-
seas markets; and 
(5) the United States should develop poli-
cies that— 
(A) insulate United States entities from 
PRC pressure against complying with United 
States laws; 
(B) counter the potential impact of the 
blocking regime of the PRC described in sub-
section (a)(12), including by working with al-
lies and partners of the United States and 
multilateral institutions; and 
(C) plan for future actions that the Govern-
ment of the PRC may take to undermine the 
lawful application of United States legal au-
thorities, including with respect to the use 
of sanctions.

TITLE V—ENSURING STRATEGIC 
SECURITY 
SEC. 3501. FINDINGS ON STRATEGIC SECURITY 
AND ARMS CONTROL. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States and the PRC have 
both made commitments to advancing stra-
tegic security through enforceable arms con-
trol and non-proliferation agreements as 
states parties to the Treaty on the Non-Pro-
liferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Wash-
ington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968. 
(2) The United States has long taken tan-
gible steps to seek effective, verifiable, and 
enforceable arms control and non-prolifera-
tion agreements that support United States 
and allied security by— 
(A) controlling the spread of nuclear mate-
rials and technology; 
(B) placing limits on the production, 
stockpiling, 
and 
deployment 
of 
nuclear 
weapons; 
(C) decreasing misperception and mis-
calculation; and 
(D) avoiding destabilizing nuclear arms 
competition. 
(3) In May 2019, Director of the Defense In-
telligence Agency Lieutenant General Rob-
ert Ashley stated, ‘‘China is likely to at 
least double the size of its nuclear stockpile 
in the course of implementing the most rapid 
expansion and diversification of its nuclear 
arsenal in China’s history.’’. The PLA is 
building a full triad of modernized fixed and 
mobile ground-based launchers and new ca-
pabilities for nuclear-armed bombers and 
submarine-launched ballistic missiles. 
(4) In June 2020, the Department of State 
raised concerns in its annual ‘‘Adherence to 
and Compliance with Arms Control, Non-
proliferation, and Disarmament Agreements 
and Commitments’’ report to Congress that 
the PRC is not complying with the ‘‘zero- 
yield’’ nuclear testing ban and accused the 
PRC of ‘‘blocking the flow of data from the 
monitoring stations’’ in China. 
(5) The Department of Defense 2020 Report 
on Military and Security Developments In-
volving the People’s Republic of China states 
that the PRC ‘‘intends to increase peacetime 
readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to 
a launch on warning posture with an ex-
panded silo-based force’’. 
(6) The Department of Defense report also 
states that, over the next decade, the PRC’s 
nuclear stockpile—currently estimated in 
the low 200s—is projected to least double in 
size as the PRC expands and modernizes its 
nuclear force. 
(7) The PRC is conducting research on its 
first potential early warning radar, with 
technical cooperation from Russia. This 
radar could indicate that the PRC is moving 
to a launch-on warning posture. 
(8) The PRC plans to use its increasingly 
capable space, cyber, and electronic warfare 
capabilities against United States early 
warning systems and critical infrastructure 
in a crisis scenario. This poses great risk to 
strategic security, as it could lead to inad-
vertent escalation. 
(9) The PRC’s nuclear expansion comes as 
a part of a massive modernization of the 
PLA which, combined with the PLA’s ag-
gressive actions, has increasingly desta-
bilized the Indo-Pacific region. 
(10) The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), 
which was elevated in 2015 to become a sepa-
rate branch within the PLA, has formed 11 
new missile brigades since May 2017, some of 
which are capable of both conventional and 
nuclear strikes. Unlike the United States, 
which separates its conventional strike and 
nuclear capabilities, the PLARF appears to 
not only co-locate conventional and nuclear 
forces, including dual-use missiles like the 
DF–26, but to task the same unit with both 
nuclear and conventional missions. Such 
intermingling could lead to inadvertent es-
calation in a crisis. The United States De-
fense Intelligence Agency determined in 
March 2020 that the PLA tested more bal-
listic missiles than the rest of the world 
combined in 2019. 
(11) A January 2021 report from the Insti-
tute for Defense Analysis found that many 
United States and international observers 
viewed China’s no first-use policy with skep-
ticism, especially in the wake of the expan-
sion and modernization of its nuclear capa-
bilities. 
(12) The long-planned United States nu-
clear modernization program will not in-
crease the United States nuclear weapons 
stockpile, 
predates 
China’s 
conventional 
military and nuclear expansion, and is not 
an arms race against China. 
(13) The United States extended nuclear de-
terrence— 
(A) provides critical strategic security 
around the world; 
(B) is an essential element of United States 
military alliances; and 
(C) serves a vital non-proliferation func-
tion. 
(14) As a signatory to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done 
at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 
1968, the PRC is obligated under Article Six 
of the treaty to pursue arms control negotia-
tions in good faith. 
(15) The United States has, on numerous 
occasions, called on the PRC to participate 
in strategic arms control negotiations, but 
the PRC has thus far declined. 
(16) The Governments of Japan, the United 
Kingdom, Poland, Slovenia, Denmark, Nor-
way, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Nether-
lands, 
Romania, 
Austria, 
Montenegro, 
Ukraine, Slovakia, Spain, North Macedonia, 
Sweden, the Czech Republic, Croatia, and Al-
bania, as well as the Deputy Secretary Gen-
eral of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, have all encouraged the PRC to join 
arms control discussions. 
SEC. 3502. COOPERATION ON A STRATEGIC NU-
CLEAR DIALOGUE. 
(a) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to pursue, in coordination with United 
States allies, arms control negotiations and 
sustained and regular engagement with the 
PRC— 
(A) to enhance understanding of each oth-
er’s respective nuclear policies, doctrine, and 
capabilities; 
(B) to improve transparency; and 
(C) to help manage the risks of miscalcula-
tion and misperception; 
(2) to formulate a strategy to engage the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China on relevant bilateral issues that lays 
the groundwork for bringing the People’s Re-
public of China into an arms control frame-
work, including— 
(A) fostering bilateral dialogue on arms 
control leading to the convening of bilateral 
strategic security talks; 
(B) negotiating norms for outer space; 
(C) developing pre-launch notification re-
gimes aimed at reducing nuclear miscalcula-
tion; and 
(D) expanding lines of communication be-
tween both governments for the purposes of 
reducing the risks of conventional war and 
increasing transparency; 
(3) to pursue relevant capabilities in co-
ordination with our allies and partners to 
ensure the security of United States and al-
lied interests in the face of the PRC’s mili-
tary modernization and expansion, includ-
ing— 
(A) ground-launched cruise and ballistic 
missiles; 
(B) integrated air and missile defense; 
(C) hypersonic missiles; 
(D) intelligence, surveillance, and recon-
naissance; 
(E) space-based capabilities; 
(F) cyber capabilities; and 
(G) command, control, and communica-
tions; 
(4) to maintain sufficient force structure, 
posture, and capabilities to provide extended 
nuclear deterrence to United States allies 
and partners; 
(5) to maintain appropriate missile defense 
capabilities to protect against threats to the 
United States homeland and our forces 
across the theater from rogue interconti-
nental ballistic missiles from the Indo-Pa-
cific region; and 
(6) to ensure that the United States declar-
atory policy reflects the requirements of ex-
tended deterrence, to both assure allies and 
to preserve its non-proliferation benefits. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) in the midst of growing competition be-
tween the United States and the PRC, it is in 
the interest of both nations to cooperate in 
reducing risks of conventional and nuclear 
escalation; 
(2) a physical, cyber, electronic, or any 
other PLA attack on United States early 
warning satellites, other portions of the nu-
clear command and control enterprise, or 
critical infrastructure poses a high risk to 
inadvertent but rapid escalation; 
(3) the United States and its allies should 
promote international norms on military op-
erations in space, the employment of cyber 
capabilities, and the military use of artifi-
cial intelligence, as an element of risk reduc-
tion regarding nuclear command and con-
trol; and 
(4) United States allies and partners should 
share the burden of promoting and pro-
tecting such norms by voting against the 
PRC’s proposals regarding the weaponization 
of space, highlighting unsafe behavior by the 
PRC that violates international norms, such 
as in rendezvous and proximity operations, 
and promoting responsible behavior in space 
and all other domains.

effects of engaging the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China on arms control 
and risk reduction, including— 
(1) areas of potential dialogue between the 
Governments of the United States and the 
People’s Republic of China, including on bal-
listic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missiles, 
conventional forces, nuclear, space, and

(c) APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS 
DEFINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘appro-
priate committees of Congress’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the Committee on Armed Services, and the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
of the Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the 
Committee on Armed Services, and the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3504. COUNTERING THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-
LIC OF CHINA’S PROLIFERATION OF 
BALLISTIC MISSILES AND NUCLEAR 
TECHNOLOGY TO THE MIDDLE EAST. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China became 
a full participant of the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group in 2004, committing it to apply a 
strong presumption of denial in exporting 
nuclear-related items that a foreign country 
could divert to a nuclear weapons program. 
(2) The People’s Republic of China also 
committed to the United States, in Novem-
ber 2000, to abide by the foundational prin-
ciples of the 1987 Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) to not ‘‘assist, in any way, 
any country in the development of ballistic 
missiles that can be used to deliver nuclear 
weapons (i.e., missiles capable of delivering a 
payload of at least 500 kilograms to a dis-
tance of at least 300 kilometers)’’. 
(3) The 2020 Department of State Report on 
the Adherence to and Compliance with Arms 
Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament 
Agreements and Commitments found that 
the People’s Republic of China ‘‘continued to 
supply MTCR-controlled goods to missile 
programs of proliferation concern in 2019’’ 
and that the United States imposed sanc-
tions on nine Chinese entities for covered 
missile transfers to Iran. 
(4) A June 5, 2019, press report indicated 
that the People’s Republic of China allegedly 
provided assistance to Saudi Arabia in the 
development of a ballistic missile facility, 
which if confirmed, would violate the pur-
pose of the MTCR and run contrary to the 
longstanding United States policy priority 
to prevent weapons of mass destruction pro-
liferation in the Middle East. 
(5) The Arms Export and Control Act of 
1976 (Public Law 93–329) requires the Presi-
dent to sanction any foreign person or gov-
ernment who knowingly ‘‘exports, transfers, 
or otherwise engages in the trade of any 
MTCR equipment or technology’’ to a coun-
try that does not adhere to the MTCR. 
(6) The People’s Republic of China con-
cluded two nuclear cooperation agreements 
with Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2017, respec-
tively, which may facilitate the People’s Re-
public of China’s bid to build two reactors in 
Saudi Arabia to generate 2.9 Gigawatt-elec-
tric (GWe) of electricity. 
(7) On August 4, 2020, a press report re-
vealed the alleged existence of a previously 
undisclosed uranium yellowcake extraction 
facility in Saudi Arabia allegedly con-
structed with the assistance of the People’s 
Republic of China, which if confirmed, would 
indicate significant progress by Saudi Arabia 
in developing the early stages of the nuclear 
fuel cycle that precede uranium enrichment. 
(8) Saudi Arabia’s outdated Small Quan-
tities Protocol and its lack of an in-force Ad-
ditional Protocol to its International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Comprehensive Safe-
guards Agreement severely curtails IAEA in-
spections, which has led the Agency to call 
upon Saudi Arabia to either rescind or up-
date its Small Quantities Protocol. 
(b) MTCR TRANSFERS.—Not later than 30 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the President shall submit to the appro-
priate committees of Congress a written de-
termination, and any documentation to sup-
port that determination detailing— 
(1) whether any foreign person in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China knowingly exported, 
transferred, or engaged in trade of any item 
designated under Category I of the MTCR 
Annex to any foreign person in the previous 
three fiscal years; and 
(2) the sanctions the President has imposed 
or intends to impose pursuant to section 
11B(b) of the Export Administration Act of 
1979 (50 U.S.C. 4612(b)) against any foreign 
person who knowingly engaged in the export, 
transfer, or trade of that item or items. 
(c) THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA’S NU-
CLEAR FUEL CYCLE COOPERATION.—Not later 
than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the President shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a report 
detailing— 
(1) whether any foreign person in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China engaged in coopera-
tion with any other foreign person in the 
previous three fiscal years in the construc-
tion of any nuclear-related fuel cycle facility 
or activity that has not been notified to the 
IAEA and would be subject to complemen-
tary access if an Additional Protocol was in 
force; and 
(2) the policy options required to prevent 
and respond to any future effort by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to export to any for-
eign person an item classified as ‘‘plants for 
the separation of isotopes of uranium’’ or 
‘‘plants for the reprocessing of irradiated nu-
clear reactor fuel elements’’ under Part 110 
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ex-
port licensing authority. 
(d) FORM OF REPORT.—The determination 
required under subsection (b) and the report 
required under subsection (c) shall be unclas-
sified with a classified annex.

SEC. 4101. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Build 
America, Buy America Act’’. 
PART I—BUY AMERICA SOURCING 
REQUIREMENTS 
SEC. 4111. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the United States must make signifi-
cant investments to install, upgrade, or re-
place the public works infrastructure of the 
United States; 
(2) with respect to investments in the in-
frastructure of the United States, taxpayers 
expect that their public works infrastructure 
will be produced in the United States by 
American workers; 
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested 
in public infrastructure should not be used 
to reward companies that have moved their 
operations, investment dollars, and jobs to 
foreign countries or foreign factories, par-
ticularly those that do not share or openly 
flout the commitments of the United States 
to environmental, worker, and workplace 
safety protections; 
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed 
Federal assistance should give a common-
sense procurement preference for the mate-
rials and products produced by companies 
and workers in the United States in accord-
ance with the high ideals embodied in the en-
vironmental, worker, workplace safety, and 
other regulatory requirements of the United 
States; 
(5) common construction materials used in 
public works infrastructure projects, includ-
ing steel, iron, manufactured products, non- 
ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based 
products (including polyvinylchloride, com-
posite building materials, and polymers used 
in fiber optic cables), concrete and other ag-
gregates, glass (including optic glass), lum-
ber, and drywall are not adequately covered 
by a domestic content procurement pref-
erence, thus limiting the impact of taxpayer 
purchases to enhance supply chains in the 
United States; 
(6) the benefits of domestic content pro-
curement preferences extend beyond eco-
nomics; 
(7) by incentivizing domestic manufac-
turing, domestic content procurement pref-
erences reinvest tax dollars in companies 
and processes using the highest labor and en-
vironmental standards in the world; 
(8) strong domestic content procurement 
preference policies act to prevent shifts in 
production to countries that rely on produc-
tion practices that are significantly less en-
ergy efficient and far more polluting than 
those in the United States; 
(9) for over 75 years, Buy America and 
other domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws have been part of the United 
States procurement policy, ensuring that the 
United States can build and rebuild the in-
frastructure of the United States with high- 
quality American-made materials; 
(10) before the date of enactment of this 
Act, a domestic content procurement pref-
erence requirement may not apply, may 
apply only to a narrow scope of products and 
materials, or may be limited by waiver with 
respect to many infrastructure programs, 
which necessitates a review of such pro-
grams, including programs for roads, high-
ways, and bridges, public transportation, 
dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime fa-
cilities, intercity passenger and freight rail-
roads, freight and intermodal facilities, air-
ports, water systems, including drinking 
water and wastewater systems, electrical 
transmission facilities and systems, utili-
ties, broadband infrastructure, and buildings 
and real property; 
(11) Buy America laws create demand for 
domestically produced goods, helping to sus-
tain and grow domestic manufacturing and 
the millions of jobs domestic manufacturing 
supports throughout product supply chains; 
(12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
domestic content procurement preference 
policies apply to all Federal Government 
procurement and to various Federal-aid in-
frastructure programs; 
(13) a robust domestic manufacturing sec-
tor is a vital component of the national secu-
rity of the United States; 
(14) as more manufacturing operations of 
the United States have moved offshore, the 
strength and readiness of the defense indus-
trial base of the United States has been di-
minished; and 
(15) domestic content procurement pref-
erence laws— 
(A) are fully consistent with the inter-
national obligations of the United States; 
and 
(B) together with the government procure-
ments to which the laws apply, are impor-
tant levers for ensuring that United States 
manufacturers can access the government 
procurement markets of the trading partners 
of the United States.

of injuriously subsidized steel, iron, or man-
ufactured goods.

SEC. 4151. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Make 
PPE in America Act’’. 
SEC. 4152. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed 
the vulnerability of the United States supply 
chains for, and lack of domestic production 
of, personal protective equipment (PPE). 
(2) The United States requires a robust, se-
cure, and wholly domestic PPE supply chain 
to safeguard public health and national secu-
rity. 
(3) Issuing a strategy that provides the 
government’s anticipated needs over the 
next three years will enable suppliers to as-
sess what changes, if any, are needed in their 
manufacturing capacity to meet expected de-
mands. 
(4) In order to foster a domestic PPE sup-
ply chain, United States industry needs a 
strong and consistent demand signal from 
the Federal Government providing the nec-
essary certainty to expand production capac-
ity investment in the United States. 
(5) In order to effectively incentivize in-
vestment in the United States and the re- 
shoring of manufacturing, long-term con-
tracts must be no shorter than three years in 
duration. 
(6) To accomplish this aim, the United 
States should seek to ensure compliance 
with its international obligations, such as 
its commitments under the World Trade Or-
ganization’s Agreement on Government Pro-
curement and its free trade agreements, in-
cluding by invoking any relevant exceptions 
to those agreements, especially those related 
to national security and public health. 
(7) The United States needs a long-term in-
vestment strategy for the domestic produc-
tion of PPE items critical to the United 
States national response to a public health 
crisis, including the COVID–19 pandemic.

in illicit activity, as documented in reports 
and testimony by officials from the Depart-
ment of Justice, the Department of Home-
land Security, the Department of the Treas-
ury, the Government Accountability Office, 
and other agencies. 
(5) In the National Strategy for Combating 
Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, issued 
in 2020, the Department of the Treasury 
found the following: ‘‘Misuse of legal entities 
to hide a criminal beneficial owner or illegal 
source of funds continues to be a common, if 
not the dominant, feature of illicit finance 
schemes, especially those involving money 
laundering, predicate offences, tax evasion, 
and proliferation financing.’’. 
(6) Federal legislation, including the Anti- 
Money Laundering Act of 2020 (division F of 
Public Law 116–283) and the Corporate Trans-
parency Act (title LXIV of division F of Pub-
lic Law 116–283), combating the crime of 
money laundering and providing for the col-
lection of beneficial ownership information 
by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Net-
work of the Department of the Treasury (re-
ferred to in this section as ‘‘FinCEN’’) with 
respect to corporations, limited liability 
companies, or other similar entities formed 
under the laws of the States has recently 
been enacted to— 
(A) set a clear Federal standard for incor-
poration practices; 
(B) better enable critical national security, 
intelligence, and law enforcement efforts to 
identify and counter money laundering, the 
financing of terrorism, and other illicit ac-
tivity; and 
(C) bring the United States into compli-
ance with international standards with re-
spect to anti-money laundering and coun-
tering the financing of terrorism. 
(7) Providing beneficial ownership informa-
tion to FinCEN is especially important in 
cases in which foreign firms, including those 
in the People’s Republic of China or subject 
to the jurisdiction of the People’s Republic 
of China, seek to acquire United States firms 
and the valuable intellectual property of 
those firms in a manner that poses a threat 
to the national security of the United 
States. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury 
should implement the Anti-Money Laun-
dering Act of 2020 (division F of Public Law 
116–283), including the Corporate Trans-
parency Act (title LXIV of division F of Pub-
lic Law 116–283), within the timelines re-
quired under those Acts, including the ele-
ments of those Acts designed to enhance the 
ability of financial services providers to 
adopt and implement anti-money laundering 
best practices, mitigate burdens on small 
businesses, ensure the security of beneficial 
ownership information as provided for by 
those Acts, and address specific concerns re-
lating to abuses of anonymous shell compa-
nies by Chinese entities and the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China.

such funds from the Department sought to 
provide funding to, or to use, domestic enti-
ties with no such ties to the country or coun-
tries of concern for such purposes and any 
barriers to the use of domestic entities; and 
(C) whether data use agreements, data se-
curity measures, and other such measures 
taken by the Department or recipient of

811 of the James Madison Memorial Fellow-
ship Act (20 U.S.C. 4510) is amended to read 
as follows: 
‘‘(b)(1) It shall be the duty of the Secretary 
of the Treasury to invest in full the amounts 
appropriated to the fund. 
‘‘(2) Subject to paragraph (3), investments 
of amounts appropriated to the fund shall be 
made in public debt securities of the United 
States with maturities suitable to the fund. 
For such purpose, such obligations may be 
acquired— 
‘‘(A) on original issue at the issue price; or 
‘‘(B) by purchase of outstanding obliga-
tions at the market price. The purposes for 
which obligations of the United States may 
be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United 
States Code, are hereby extended to author-
ize the issuance at par of special obligations 
exclusively to the fund. Such special obliga-
tions shall bear interest at a rate equal to

public debt, except that where such average 
rate is not a multiple of 1⁄8 of 1 percent, the 
rate of interest of such special obligations 
shall be the multiple of 1⁄8 of 1 percent next

obligations shall be issued only if the Sec-
retary determines that the purchases of 
other interest-bearing obligations of the

sets in securities other than public debt se-
curities of the United States, provided that 
the securities are traded in established 
United States markets. 
‘‘(B) A determination described in this sub-
paragraph is a determination by the Board 
that investments as described in subpara-
graph (A) are necessary to enable the Foun-
dation to carry out the purposes of this title 
without any diminution of the number of fel-
lowships provided under section 804. 
‘‘(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be 
construed to limit the authority of the 
Board to increase the number of fellowships 
provided under section 804, or to increase the 
amount of the fellowship authorized by sec-
tion 809, as the Board considers appropriate 
and is otherwise consistent with the require-
ments of this title.’’.

Section 816 of the James Madison Memorial 
Fellowship Act (20 U.S.C. 4515) is amended to 
read as follows:

TITLE III—MISCELLANEOUS 
SEC. 6301. ENHANCING ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR 
THE 21ST CENTURY. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) 
APPROPRIATE
COMMITTEES
OF
CON-
GRESS.—The term ‘‘appropriate committees 
of Congress’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation of the Senate; and 
(B) the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce of the House of Representatives. 
(2) 
ENTREPRENEUR.—The 
term 
‘‘entre-
preneur’’ means an individual who founded, 
or is a member of a group that founded, a 
United States business. 
(3) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of Commerce. 
(4) UNITED
STATES
BUSINESS.—The term 
‘‘United States business’’ means a corpora-
tion, partnership, association, joint-stock 
company, business trust, unincorporated or-
ganization, or sole proprietorship that— 
(A) has its principal place of business in 
the United States; or 
(B) is organized under the laws of a State 
of the United States or a territory, posses-
sion, or commonwealth of the United States. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Recent research has demonstrated 
that— 
(A) new businesses (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘startups’’)— 
(i) are disproportionately responsible for 
the innovations that drive economic growth; 
and 
(ii) account for virtually all net new job 
creation; 
(B) the rate of formation of United States 
businesses has fallen significantly in recent 
years; and 
(C) as determined by widely cited research, 
the decline in the rate described in subpara-
graph (B) is occurring in all 50 States, in all 
but a handful of 360 metro areas examined, 
and across a broad range of industry sectors. 
(2) Before policymakers can identify ways 
in which the decline in the rate described in 
paragraph (1)(B) may be counteracted, the 
underlying causes of the decline must be 
identified. 
(3) Economists have identified several fac-
tors that may explain the decline in the rate 
described in paragraph (1)(B), including— 
(A) demographic changes caused by an 
aging workforce and slowing population 
growth; 
(B) increased industry concentration that 
may make it more difficult for new market 
entrants to compete with established compa-
nies; 
(C) increased risk-aversion following the fi-
nancial crisis and recession that occurred in 
2008 and 2009 and deterioration of household 
balance sheets; 
(D) difficulties relating to access to cap-
ital, particularly difficulties encountered by 
underserved populations, women, and mem-
bers of minority groups; 
(E) the concentration of venture capital in 
only a few cities; 
(F) record levels of student debt; and 
(G) inefficiencies or other difficulties relat-
ing to the commercialization of federally 
funded research and innovation. 
(c) ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS.— 
(1) ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS REQUIRED.— 
Not later than 2 years after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary, in con-
sultation with the Director of the Bureau of 
the Census and the Director of the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis of the Department of 
Commerce, shall conduct an assessment and 
analysis regarding the reasons for the state 
of the formation of new United States busi-
nesses during a period— 
(A) that the Secretary determines appro-
priate based on the data described in para-
graph (2)(A)(i); and 
(B) ending on the date on which the assess-
ment and analysis is conducted. 
(2) CONSIDERATIONS AND CONSULTATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—In conducting the assess-
ment and analysis required under paragraph 
(1), the Secretary shall— 
(i) notwithstanding any other provision of 
Federal law, and subject to subparagraph 
(B), review data collected and maintained 
by— 
(I) the Bureau of the Census; 
(II) the Bureau of Economic Analysis; 
(III) the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(IV) the Small Business Administration; 
(V) the Department of the Treasury; 
(VI) the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System; and 
(VII) any other Federal or State agency, or 
public or private sector organization, that 
the Secretary determines appropriate; 
(ii) with respect to the formation of new 
United States businesses, consider the im-
pact of— 
(I) demographic changes caused by an 
aging workforce and slowing population 
growth; 
(II) increased industry concentration and 
whether such concentration may make it 
more difficult for new market entrants to 
compete with established companies; 
(III) increased risk-aversion following the 
financial crisis and recession that occurred 
in 2008 and 2009 and deterioration of house-
hold balance sheets; 
(IV) difficulties relating to access to cap-
ital, particularly difficulties encountered by 
underserved populations, women, and mem-
bers of minority groups; 
(V) the concentration of venture capital in 
only a few cities; 
(VI) record levels of student debt; 
(VII) inefficiencies or other difficulties re-
lating to the commercialization of federally 
funded research and innovation; 
(VIII) the use of federally funded research 
and innovation in the commercial market; 
(IX) regulatory burden, overlap, com-
plexity, and uncertainty at the Federal and

nesses, or investors in incumbent businesses, 
respectively; 
(XI) foreign-born entrepreneurs and the

ation; and 
(XII) any other factor that the Secretary

(iii) consult with— 
(I) the heads of any agencies and offices of 
the Federal Government that the Secretary 
determines appropriate, including— 
(aa) the Secretary of the Treasury; 
(bb) the Secretary of Labor; 
(cc) the Administrator of the Small Busi-
ness Administration; 
(dd) the Chief Counsel of the Office of Ad-

tiality requirements and protections as the 
confidentiality requirements and protections

viding the data. 
(3) REPORT.—The Secretary shall submit to 
the appropriate committees of Congress a re-
port regarding the findings of the Secretary

SEC. 6302. PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL FUNDING 
FOR WUHAN INSTITUTE OF VIROL-
OGY. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, no Federal funding may be made avail-
able to the Wuhan Institute of Virology lo-
cated in the City of Wuhan in the People’s 
Republic of China. 
SEC. 6303. ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY 
PROVISIONS 
OF 
ECO-
NOMIC AND TRADE AGREEMENT BE-
TWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Agreement includes significant 
mandates for the People’s Republic of China 
related to its domestic intellectual property 
regime, including with respect to copyrights, 
trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; 
(2) the changes included in the Agreement, 
if implemented effectively, should improve 
the domestic intellectual property frame-
work of the People’s Republic of China, 
which has historically proven to harm the 
innovation and creative communities in the 
United States; 
(3) despite commitments made by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
under the Agreement, ongoing market access 
barriers, uneven enforcement, measures re-
quiring forced technology transfer, and seri-
ous deficiencies in the rule of law continue 
to make the business environment in the 
People’s Republic of China highly chal-
lenging for rights holders in the United 
States; 
(4) as reflected in the 2021 report by the 
United States Trade Representative required 
under section 182(h) of the Trade Act of 1974 
(19 U.S.C. 2242(h)) (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Special 301 Report’’), the People’s Re-
public of China has consistently been listed 
in that annual report since 1989 as a trading 
partner of the United States that ‘‘fails to 
provide adequate and effective IP protection 
and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, 
brands, manufacturers, and service pro-
viders, which, in turn, harm American work-
ers’’; and 
(5) Congress encourages the United States 
Trade Representative, the Attorney General, 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, the Secretary of Com-
merce, and the Director of the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office— 
(A) to use all available tools to ensure that 
the People’s Republic of China fully imple-
ments its commitments under the Agree-
ment; and 
(B) to actively consider additional means 
to require the People’s Republic of China to 
address unfair market access barriers, forced 
technology 
transfer 
requirements, 
and 
broader intellectual property theft concerns, 
including through future trade agreements 
and working with partners in multilateral 
organizations, such as the Group of 7 (G7), 
the Group of 20 (G20), and the World Trade 
Organization. 
(b) 
ENFORCEMENT
OF
AGREEMENT.—The 
President, acting through the United States 
Trade Representative, shall coordinate with 
the heads of such Federal agencies as the 
President considers appropriate to enforce 
the actions related to intellectual property 
laid out in the Agreement including— 
(1) the civil, administrative, and criminal 
procedures and deterrent-level civil and 
criminal penalties provided in the Agree-
ment; and 
(2) by using the full enforcement authority 
of the President, including any enforcement 
authority in connection with the identifica-
tion and reporting process under section 182 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242). 
(c) REPORT ON STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION 
OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and every 180 days thereafter, the United 
States Trade Representative shall submit to 
the appropriate committees of Congress a re-
port on the status of the implementation by 
the People’s Republic of China of its obliga-
tions under Chapter 1 of the Agreement. 
(2) INFORMATION
IN
REPORT.—Each report 
required by paragraph (1) shall contain infor-
mation sufficient to enable the appropriate 
committees of Congress to assess the extent 
of the compliance by the People’s Republic 
of China with the Agreement, including ap-
propriate quantitative metrics. 
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) AGREEMENT.—The term ‘‘Agreement’’ 
means the Economic and Trade Agreement 
Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of 
China, dated January 15, 2020. 
(2) 
APPROPRIATE
COMMITTEES
OF
CON-
GRESS.—The term ‘‘appropriate committees 
of Congress’’ means the Committee on Fi-
nance of the Senate and the Committee on 
Ways and Means of the House of Representa-
tives. 
SEC. 6304. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE 
REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION TO 
DETERMINE 
THE 
ORIGINS 
OF 
COVID–19. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) COVID–19 has taken the lives of nearly 
3,500,000 individuals around the world. 
(2) 
Understanding 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic is essential to address-
ing our vulnerabilities and preventing future 
crises. 
(3) In May 2020, the World Health Assembly 
did not authorize a comprehensive investiga-
tion into the origins of COVID–19, and in-
stead passed a significantly limited com-
promise resolution, with Chinese govern-
ment support, which did not explicitly in-
clude in its scope the possibility of a re-
search-related accident. 
(4) The 2020 World Health Assembly resolu-
tion and its terms of reference, which were 
negotiated privately between the World 
Health Organization (in this section referred 
to as ‘‘WHO’’) and Chinese authorities, hand-
ed the Chinese government control over the 
joint-study process by giving the Chinese 
government veto power over which inter-
national experts were allowed to participate 
in the joint study and by agreeing that most 
primary research would be carried out by 
Chinese teams without ensuring broad access 
to primary data by international experts. 
(5) As a result of these terms, the signifi-
cant structural, procedural, and analytical 
shortcomings of the joint study, and the se-
vere restrictions imposed by Chinese au-
thorities, the WHO-convened joint study into 
the origins of COVID–19 was prevented from 
providing a balanced consideration of the 
multiple theories of the origin of COVID–19. 
(6) Only 4 of the 313 pages of the joint- 
study team report and its annexes addressed 
the possibility of a laboratory accident, and 
no thorough examination of the lab incident 
hypothesis was carried out by the joint- 
study team. 
(7) Some of the international experts on 
the joint-study team stated that they lacked 
the means and resources to properly inves-
tigate the research-related accident hypoth-
esis, and they were neither able nor meant to 
do such a full investigation but instead were 
acting as a ‘‘study review group’’. 
(8) 
WHO 
Director-General 
Dr. 
Tedros 
Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented on March 
30, 2021, the day the joint-study report was 
released, ‘‘I do not believe that [the joint- 
study team’s] assessment [of a possible lab 
incident] was extensive enough. Further data 
and studies will be needed to reach more ro-
bust conclusions . . . potentially with addi-
tional missions involving specialist experts, 
which I am ready to deploy.’’. 
(9) The WHO Director-General further com-
mented, ‘‘As far as WHO is concerned all 
hypotheses remain on the table . . . We have 
not yet found the source of the virus, and we 
must continue to follow the science and 
leave no stone unturned as we do . . . It is 
clear that we need more research across a 
range of areas, which will entail further field 
visits.’’. 
(10) The March 30, 2021 Joint Statement on 
the WHO-convened COVID–19 Origins Study 
by the United States and 13 other countries 
recognized the severe shortcomings of the 
joint-study process and called for ‘‘a trans-
parent and independent analysis and evalua-
tion, free from interference and undue influ-
ence.’’. 
(11) In spite of the devastation the COVID– 
19 pandemic has caused in the United States 
and around the world, no process currently 
exists to ensure a comprehensive investiga-
tion into the source of COVID–19. 
(12) Such an investigation is essential for 
ensuring this type of crisis never happens 
again for the benefit of all people, all na-
tions, and future generations. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) a comprehensive investigation to deter-
mine the origins of COVID–19 must be con-
ducted by WHO immediately, with access to 
all relevant records, samples, and personnel 
in China, and that such investigation must 
fully explore all possible sources of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including exclusively 
‘‘natural’’ zoonosis in the wild, human con-
tamination in an animal farm, and a re-
search-related accident;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4216 
June 10, 2021 
(2) the United States delegation to the 
World Health Assembly should, in concert 
with allies and partners around the world, 
work to ensure that an international sci-
entific investigation into the origins of 
COVID–19, with full access to all relevant 
records, samples, and personnel in China, 
will be authorized by the World Health As-
sembly and implemented with extreme ur-
gency; and 
(3) should such a full investigation not be 
authorized by the 2021 World Health Assem-
bly, then the United States Government 
should immediately begin planning a com-
prehensive and data-driven investigation 
into the COVID–19 pandemic origins, in con-
cert with willing partner governments and 
experts around the world.

estimated 80 percent of its rare earth com-

of China’s dominant position in the rare 
earth market to ‘‘strike back’’ at the United 
States.

ance on the People’s Republic of China for 
rare earth minerals through—

projects, production technologies, and refin-
ing facilities in the United States; or 
(ii) in partnership with strategic allies of 
the United States that are reliable trading 
partners, including members of the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue; and

tion under section 301(b), the Trade Rep-
resentative shall analyze the impact of the 
action on United States entities, particu-
larly small entities, and consumers in the 
United States with a goal of mitigating the

‘‘(b) PROCESS
FOR
EXCLUSION
FROM
DU-
TIES.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to subsection 
(d), the Trade Representative shall establish 
and maintain a process for exclusion re-
quests from duties under section 301(b) un-
less the Trade Representative determines 
and certifies to the appropriate congres-
sional committees that maintaining an ex-
clusion process— 
‘‘(A) would impair the ability of the United 
States to maintain effective pressure to re-
move unreasonable or discriminatory prac-
tices burdening commerce in the United 
States; or 
‘‘(B) is impractical due to the low value of 
the duties imposed. 
‘‘(2) BRIEFING.—If the Trade Representative 
makes a certification under paragraph (1), 
not later than 3 days before making the cer-
tification, the Trade Representative shall 
brief the appropriate congressional commit-
tees regarding the reasons for the certifi-
cation. 
‘‘(3)

CERTIFICATION.—If 
the 
Trade Representative makes a certification

clusion process required under subsection 
(b)(1), the Trade Representative shall con-
sider whether and which criteria described in 
paragraph (2), and such other criteria as the

‘‘(2) CRITERIA DESCRIBED.—The criteria de-
scribed in this paragraph for exclusion of ar-
ticles from duties under section 301(b) in-
clude the following:

clusion would result in severe economic 
harm to the requester. 
‘‘(B) Whether the article or a reasonable 
substitute is not commercially available to 
the requester. 
‘‘(C) Whether the imposition of the duty 
with respect to the article would unreason-
ably increase consumer prices for day-to-day 
items consumed by low- or middle-income 
families in the United States. 
‘‘(D) Whether the imposition of the duty 
would have an unreasonable impact on man-
ufacturing output of the United States. 
‘‘(E) Whether the imposition of the duty 
would have an unreasonable impact on the 
ability of an entity to fulfill contracts or to 
build critical infrastructure. 
‘‘(F) Whether the failure to grant the ex-
clusion is likely to result in a particular en-
tity or entities having the ability to abuse a 
dominant market position. 
‘‘(d) EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DUTIES.—This 
section shall not apply to duties imposed 
under section 301(b) pursuant to a dispute 
resolution process under the World Trade Or-
ganization.

OF NOTICE.—Subject to 
subsection (d), not later than 90 days after 
imposing any duty under section 301(b), the 
Trade Representative, in consultation with 
such other Federal agencies as the Trade 
Representative considers appropriate, shall 
publish a notice in the Federal Register re-
garding the criteria that the Trade Rep-
resentative will apply and the evidence it 
will evaluate in determining whether a re-
quest for exclusion from such duty satisfies 
the requirements of the exclusion process 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
‘‘(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘appropriate congressional 
committees’ means— 
‘‘(A) the Committee on Finance of the Sen-
ate; and

the House of Representatives. 
‘‘(2) SEVERE ECONOMIC HARM.—The term ‘se-
vere economic harm’, with respect to an ex-
clusion from duties requested by a United

portion of the workers employed by the enti-
ty becoming totally separated from employ-
ment. 
‘‘(3) SMALL ENTITIES.—The term ‘small en-

ESS.—In implementing the process estab-
lished under paragraph (1) for exclusion of 
articles from duties described in paragraph 
(2), if the exclusion of the article can likely 
be administered by U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection— 
(A) the Trade Representative shall exclude 
that article from the imposition of such a 
duty if the Trade Representative determines, 
following a request from a United States en-
tity or an association of those entities, that 
the failure to grant the exclusion would re-
sult in severe economic harm to the re-
quester; 
(B) unless the Trade Representative deter-
mines that granting the exclusion would im-
pair the ability of the United States to main-
tain effective pressure to remove an unrea-
sonable or discriminatory practice burdening 
United States commerce, the Trade Rep-
resentative shall exclude that article from 
the imposition of such a duty if the Trade 
Representative determines following a re-
quest from a United States entity or an asso-
ciation of those entities that— 
(i) the article or a reasonable substitute is 
not commercially available to the requester; 
(ii) the imposition of the duty with respect 
to the article would unreasonably increase 
consumer prices for day-to-day items con-
sumed by low- or middle-income families in 
the United States; 
(iii) the imposition of the duty would have 
an unreasonable impact on manufacturing 
output of the United States; 
(iv) the imposition of the duty would have 
an unreasonable impact on the ability of an

entity to fulfill contracts or to build critical 
infrastructure; or 
(v) the failure to grant the exclusion is 
likely to result in a particular entity or enti-
ties having the ability to abuse a dominant

SEC. 73006. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LEADER-
SHIP AT WORLD TRADE ORGANIZA-
TION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The United States had led the forma-
tion, as well as reform, of rules governing 
the multilateral trading system since World 
War II. 
(2) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (in this sec-
tion referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) and a key ar-
chitect of the organization. 
(3) The United States secured important 
commitments in the WTO to facilitate trade 
in goods and services, to prevent the applica-
tion of non-scientific restrictions on United 
States agriculture, and to protect United 
States intellectual property. 
(4) The United States uses the rules of the 
WTO to benefit workers, farmers, fishers, 
and businesses in the United States by facili-
tating access to the 90 percent of the world’s 
consumers who live outside the borders of 
the United States. 
(5) The fundamental purpose of the WTO is 
to create space for members to negotiate 
with each other, and the WTO reserves to 
those members exclusively the right to nego-
tiate and adopt rules that reduce and elimi-
nate trade barriers and discriminatory treat-
ment. 
(6) The prompt settlement of disputes in 
which a member of the WTO considers that 
its rights are being impaired by the actions 
of another member is essential to the func-
tioning of the WTO and the maintenance of 
a proper balance between the rights and obli-
gations of members. 
(7) The WTO’s dispute settlement function, 
including in particular the Appellate Body, 
has increasingly failed to enforce the rules of 
the WTO in a timely manner, and has 
usurped the negotiating prerogative of mem-
bers by creating new obligations and rights 
that are inconsistent with or not included in 
the rules negotiated by members. 
(8) The creation of those obligations and 
rights undermines— 
(A) the WTO’s negotiating function by dis-
couraging members from making conces-
sions; and 
(B) the WTO’s dispute settlement function 
by encouraging overuse of the process and 
undermining its legitimacy, including by 
preventing free market economies from re-
sponding to globally trade distortive prac-
tices by nonmarket economies. 
(9) The WTO does not have sufficient rules 
to discipline the distortive economic policies 
of nonmarket economies, such as policies re-
lating to excess capacity and forced tech-
nology transfer, the special treatment those 
economies afford to state-owned enterprises, 
and their massive and opaque industrial sub-
sidies. 
(10) There is long-standing bipartisan sup-
port in Congress to reform the WTO to ad-
dress those failings. 
(11) The current presidential administra-
tion, as well as prior administrations, raised 
concerns about the failings described in this 
subsection and have made reform of the WTO 
a top priority of United States trade policy. 
(12) The United States urges WTO members 
to work constructively with the United 
States to assess the reasons why the existing 
WTO rules have proven inadequate in order 
to create an atmosphere within the WTO 
that is conducive to the development of new 
rules less subject to jurisprudential drift. 
(13) The guiding principle for reform of the 
WTO, and the lens through which WTO mem-
bers should consider specific reform pro-
posals, is the restoration of the WTO’s capa-
bility and capacity for negotiation among 
members.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4234 
June 10, 2021 
(14) The United States has achieved its 
trade policy objectives through active lead-
ership at the WTO, and an absence of that 
leadership would be filled by nonmarket 
economies that are hostile to a host of 
United States interests. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) while the United States finds value and 
usefulness in the WTO, in order to fulfill the 
needs of the United States and other free and 
open economies in the 21st century, signifi-
cant reforms are needed; 
(2) the United States must therefore con-
tinue to demonstrate leadership to achieve 
reforms that restore the effectiveness of the 
WTO’s— 
(A) negotiating function; 
(B) dispute settlement function so that it 
transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces 
outcomes negotiated by members rather 
than usurping their primacy by creating new 
rights or obligations; and 
(C) rules for special and differential treat-
ment to ensure those rules promote advance-
ment for truly developing countries, rather 
than becoming tools for globally competitive 
countries, like the People’s Republic of 
China, to engage in protectionism and mar-
ket distortions; 
(3) the efforts to reform the negotiating 
function of the WTO should revitalize the ne-
gotiating function by providing confidence 
to members that the WTO operates accord-
ing to the rules as negotiated and adopted by 
members; 
(4) a revitalized negotiating function must 
include new rules that reflect the 21st cen-
tury economy, further combat anticompeti-
tive and protectionist barriers, and ensure 
disputes are efficiently resolved; 
(5) the United States Trade Representative 
should continue to lead efforts to work with 
WTO members to pursue reforms at the WTO 
that— 
(A) ensure the dispute settlement mecha-
nism faithfully applies the rules adopted by 
members, including by undertaking meas-
ures to ensure the WTO’s Appellate Body 
does not create new rights and obligations; 
(B) improve public confidence in dispute 
settlement by promoting greater trans-
parency and efficiency in the conduct of pro-
ceedings; 
(C) redress the consistent failure by cer-
tain members to satisfy their notification 
obligations under various WTO agreements, 
including through measures that strengthen 
accountability; 
(D) ensure rules for special and differential 
treatment are appropriately reserved for 
countries whose state of development and 
global competitiveness actually warrants 
such flexibility; 
(E) create new rules and structures that 
can serve the interests of the United States 
while promoting peace, prosperity, good gov-
ernance, transparency, effective operation of 
legal regimes, the rule of law, and free enter-
prise; and 
(F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations 
currently underway with Japan and the Eu-
ropean Union; and 
(6) the United States Trade Representative 
should explore and assess specific reform 
proposals, including— 
(A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that 
further the interests of the United States 
while limiting the benefits accruing to coun-
tries that are not parties to those agree-
ments; 
(B) efforts to ensure that incorrect inter-
pretations by the Appellate Body, including 
with respect to the Agreement on Safe-
guards, the Agreement on Implementation of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tar-
iffs and Trade 1994, and the Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are 
corrected, and not to be deemed preceden-
tial;
