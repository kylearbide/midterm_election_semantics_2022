Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 1, 2021 
No. 115 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. BLUMENAUER).

DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
July 1, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable EARL BLU-
MENAUER to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Gracious God, such privilege You 
have shown us, what favor You have 
bestowed on this Nation from its incep-
tion 245 years ago. This Republic is 
nothing short of Your gracious gift. 
In Your mercy, You have called us 
into liberty. On this Independence Day, 
we acknowledge the sacrifice of our 
country’s ancestors and the toil of our 
Founders. Much blood has been spilled 
and tears shed to ensure the success of 
the experiment of American democ-
racy. 
Remind us again, even as we cele-
brate this weekend, that noble ideals 
served to build the strong foundation 
of these United States; our freedoms 
are not occasion for us to promote self-
ish interests or exercise our privilege 
over another. 
Rather, in light of the independence 
we enjoy, we are called to recommit 
ourselves to what binds us together. 
May we once again seek cooperatively 
to love and serve You, as we devote 
ourselves to love and serve this coun-
try and all who have pledged them-
selves to its principles. 
May we, without fault, in response to 
Your undeserved favor on our country, 
proclaim liberty throughout the land 
unto all the inhabitants thereof. 
God bless America. In Your saving 
name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
TAKANO) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. TAKANO led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
CONGRATULATING ANDY 
MELENDREZ 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate a constituent 
and dear friend, Andy Melendrez, on his 
retirement from the Riverside City 
Council. 
Mr. Melendrez has served as a council 
member for Ward 2 for four consecutive 
terms. During his first term as council 
member, he focused on enforcing public 
safety. 
He has also always been a strong ad-
vocate 
for 
Riverside’s 
youth. 
Mr. 
Melendrez brought the first youth 
opera program to the Cesar Chavez 
Community Center-Bobby Bonds Park 
and other social service programs for 
youth that would provide them with 
mentoring, 
workforce 
development 
training, and other opportunities to 
improve their lives. 
Mr. Melendrez’s dedication to im-
proving the lives of families in River-
side is admirable. There is no doubt of 
his dedication and commitment to pub-
lic service. 
Riverside was lucky to have him as a 
local leader, and I wish him the best in 
his retirement from the city council. 
f 
REJECT PARTISAN 
INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, every 5 
years, this body deliberates a surface 
transportation reauthorization, which 
is traditionally a bipartisan effort to 
deliver improvements to America’s in-
frastructure, like roads, bridges, high-
ways, and transit. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are stripping this 
bill of its bipartisan roots in favor of 
their my-way-or-the-highway plan that 
is riddled with Green New Deal prior-
ities, wasteful spending, and a clear 
prioritization of urban America over 
rural America. 
The Democrats’ bill provides an esti-
mated $307 billion for Green New Deal- 
related mandates, ties the hands of 
States to address their unique projects, 
fails to streamline the project delivery 
process, and pulls resources away from 
programs upon which rural commu-
nities rely. 
That is a losing deal for every Amer-
ican waiting for real improvement to

infrastructure they use every day, and 
it is a losing deal for our kids and 
grandkids who will be forced to foot 
the bill. 
We must reject this harmful proposal 
and work together on a bipartisan sur-
face transportation bill that meets the 
mark for every American who relies on 
our Nation’s transportation systems. 
f 
STOP PALESTINIAN EVICTIONS 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise on behalf of the thousands of Pal-
estinian families in the West Bank that 
face the prospect of eviction, demoli-
tion, and displacement from their 
homes by the Israeli Government. 
We have received word that demoli-
tion orders have already begun for 
homes in the al-Bustan neighborhood 
of Silwan in East Jerusalem. A few 
months ago, families in Sheikh Jarrah 
and other neighborhoods faced a simi-
lar fate. Tomorrow, others will also. 
After the devastation and bloodshed 
of the past few months and the contin-
ued toll of the coronavirus pandemic 
on Palestinian families, we cannot 
allow these evictions, demolitions, and 
displacements to further exacerbate 
this humanitarian crisis. 
No individual or family should ever 
be forcibly removed from their home, 
not in the West Bank, not in Gaza, not 
in Europe, not in Asia, not really any-
where. It is wrong. 
This crisis must end now. This is 
about human rights, dignity, and re-
spect. If we are ever to achieve peace in 
the region, a true two-state solution, 
there must be a mutual understanding. 
I once again urge the Biden adminis-
tration to do everything in its power to 
stop the evictions. 
f 
CONGRATULATING ISABELLA 
KERN 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Pennsylvania’s 15th Congressional Dis-
trict 2021 Congressional Art Contest 
winner, Isabella Kern. 
The annual art competition, orga-
nized by the Congressional Institute, 
showcases the artwork of high school 
students from across every congres-
sional district in the country. 
Isabella just graduated from Rich-
land High School earlier this month. 
Her artwork titled ‘‘America’s Working 
Woman’’ is an oil painting on canvas. 
Isabella’s work was selected by an 
independent panel of judges from 70 en-
tries, which is the largest group of stu-
dents to participate in the 15th Dis-
trict’s congressional artwork competi-
tion. 
All the winning pieces will be dis-
played for the year in the Cannon tun-
nel, where they will be viewed by Mem-
bers of Congress, staff, and many visi-
tors to the Capitol every day. 
Congratulations, Isabella, and con-
gratulations to all those in Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th District and throughout the 
Nation who participated in this com-
petition and expressed their creative 
skills.

COMMENDING PENNSYLVANIA FOR 
REACHING 
FOURTH 
OF 
JULY 
VACCINATION GOAL 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, 
after a year of battling the coronavirus 
pandemic, my home Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania ended its mask mandate. 
I am proud of Pennsylvania for ex-
ceeding President Biden’s goal for vac-
cinations by the Fourth of July. With 
over 75 percent of adults with one dose 
and 60 percent with both doses, we are 
safely lifting our mask mandate. 
I salute my State’s leadership in put-
ting health and science first as we 
sought to get the virus under control. 
When this pandemic started, no one 
knew how long it would take to get 
past these precautions. At times, it 
was difficult to see any return to nor-
malcy, but we got there together. 
I thank my constituents for their 
sacrifice. Pennsylvania families, teach-
ers, students, workers, and businesses 
saved lives, jobs, and businesses. 
As we are on our way to beating this 
pandemic, I look forward to seeing 
their smiling faces again on Independ-
ence Day. 
Let’s take lessons from this pan-
demic. American workers need higher 
wages. Healthcare is a right. School 
and childcare funding is vital. It is 
time to upgrade our infrastructure.

KENNY BEDNAREK REPRESENTS 
IOWA AND USA IN OLYMPICS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
the Summer Olympics in Tokyo will 
kick off in less than a month, and I 
would be remiss not to mention a 
young track star from a college in my 
district who is making his first Olym-
pic appearance. 
Kenny 
Bednarek, 
a 
22-year-old 
sprinter who hails from Indian Hills 
Community College in my hometown 
of Ottumwa, earned a spot on the USA 
Olympic team when he finished second 
in the men’s 200-meter dash, with an 
impressive time of 19.78 seconds, be-
coming the first Iowa junior college 
athlete to qualify for the Olympic 
Games. 
Though COVID–19 might have de-
layed the 2020 Summer Olympics, we 
are all glad to see that it is back on 
schedule, and Iowa’s Second District is 
proud to be represented by such a stel-
lar athlete on Team USA. 
I wish you the best, Kenny, and I 
know you will do great as you go on to 
Tokyo to represent both the United 
States and Iowa in the Summer Olym-
pic Games. 
I would also like to wish my brother 
Richard Miller a happy birthday. Rich-
ard was a Secret Service agent who 
guarded five Presidents. Happy birth-
day, Rick. 
And happy Independence Day to our 
Nation. 
f 
TAKE ACTION ON WILDFIRES 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, 2020 was 
California’s 
worst 
fire 
season 
on 
record, and 2021 has the potential to be 
even worse. 
Wildfires damage property, pollute 
our air, and threaten lives, and we need 
to take action. 
I have been calling for fair pay for 
Federal firefighters. These brave Amer-
icans put their lives on the line to keep 
our communities safe, and I am glad 
that the Biden administration recently 
committed to paying Federal fire-
fighters at least $15 an hour. 
As we begin another fire season, we 
need to strengthen our coordination 
across levels of government to learn 
from past disasters. I have introduced 
legislation to create an independent 
board to closely examine and report on 
natural disasters. This will keep fami-
lies safe and save taxpayers money. 
And, of course, we need to tackle a 
key contributor to worsening fire sea-
sons, the climate crisis. 
As we move forward on infrastruc-
ture legislation, environmental protec-
tion must be a priority. 
For the millions of Americans and 
Californians hurt by wildfires each 
year, doing nothing is not an option. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to defend the unborn and protect 
taxpayers from being forced to fund 
abortions. 
The Hyde amendment, which pro-
hibits taxpayer dollars from paying for 
abortion, has enjoyed broad, bipartisan 
consensus since 1976, and a majority of 
Americans support it today. It is esti-
mated to have saved nearly 2.5 million 
lives. 
It saddens me that I now have to de-
fend this commonsense provision from 
attacks by congressional Democrats 
and the Biden administration. Ameri-
cans should not be forced to financially 
support the destruction of life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3585 
July 1, 2021 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, which would codify this 
vital prohibition into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
f 
DEFUNDING POLICE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, here we 
go again. The laughable attempt by 
senior White House officials to cast Re-
publicans as those that want to defund 
the police is completely ridiculous. 
They put up this fig leaf concept be-
cause we didn’t support an irrespon-
sible, nearly $2 trillion spending pack-
age, which had a tiny portion of it— 
$350 million out of $2 trillion—possibly 
to be able to go for local government to 
decide its own use for police. That is 
what the whole premise is on. So some-
how, Republicans are defunding the po-
lice. 
Well, I think that is the mantra we 
have seen come from the Democrats, 
some in this Chamber and many at the 
local government level. 
In New York, for example, one Mem-
ber 
from 
this 
Chamber 
said: 
‘‘Defunding police means defunding po-
lice.’’ New York City proceeded to cut 
$1 billion from the NYPD. 
In Minneapolis, another Member said 
that it is time to ‘‘reimagine public 
safety in Minneapolis.’’ They went on 
to cut over $6 million. But after seeing 
the error of their ways, they are now 
restoring the money. 
In Los Angeles, for example, there 
were calls for a cut of $100 million, and 
now they are restoring that. Amazing.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 3684) to 
authorize funds for Federal-aid high-
ways, highway safety programs, and 
transit programs, and for other pur-
poses, will now resume. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
AMENDMENTS EN BLOC NO. 5 OFFERED BY MS. 
DAVIDS OF KANSAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the question on the 
adoption of amendments en bloc No. 5, 
printed in House Report 117–75, on 
which further proceedings were post-
poned and on which the yeas and nays

Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that in the en-
grossment of H.R. 3684, the Clerk be au-
thorized to correct section numbers, 
punctuation, spelling, and cross-ref-
erences, and to make such other tech-
nical and conforming changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the actions of 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER HOUSE 
JOINT RESOLUTION 54 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, con-
sistent with Israel’s request for $1 bil-
lion in emergency military aid to fund 
the Iron Dome, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Appropria-
tions be discharged from further con-
sideration of House Joint Resolution 54 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, can 
the Speaker inform us of the composi-
tion of the floor leadership? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Floor 
leadership includes the Speaker and 
majority leader on the majority side 
and the minority leader on the minor-
ity side and does not include the entire 
hierarchy of party leadership. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for that clarification. 
So that means that the Speaker and 
majority leader are blocking funding 
for Israel? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate. 
f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
CONGRESSMAN SONNY CALLAHAN 
(Mr. CARL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to join my Ala-
bama colleagues in honoring and re-
membering the incredible life of Con-
gressman Sonny Callahan. Sonny Cal-
lahan, better known as just ‘‘Sonny’’ in 
the district, served Alabama’s First 
Congressional District in Washington 
for 18 years and lived a life devoted to 
public service. 
Before his time in Congress, Sonny 
joined the United States Navy and 
served in the Alabama legislature. 
Sonny was a true statesman, and his 
service to our State and to our Nation 
was unmatched. 
For many years, Sonny was a close 
friend and a mentor of not only myself, 
but everyone that knew him. Although 
Sonny is no longer with us, his legacy 
and his impact will live on forever. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members 
present rise for a moment of silence in 
honor of the late Sonny Callahan. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
REGINALD ALTON POPE 
(Ms. BARRAGA´ N asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor the life of Pastor Reginald 
Alton Pope, a beloved faith and com-
munity leader in Los Angeles. 
Under Pastor Pope’s direction, Beth-
el Missionary Baptist Church went be-
yond the walls of the church to offer 
support services to its neighbors, did 
outreach to the unhoused, provided un-
employment services, and much more. 
I witnessed this work after worship-
ping with the church on a Father’s Day 
morning. 
It was a moving service. Pastor Pope 
preached that this country is big 
enough for all our children. I will al-
ways remember Pastor Pope’s passion 
and his compassion. 
Pastor Pope founded the Watts Area 
Ministers as a force for positive com-
munity change. I was honored to par-
ticipate in their annual Martin Luther 
King Day festivities, always first-rate, 
service-focused events. 
After a life of service to our commu-
nity, Pastor Pope passed away on June 
16, 2021. 
He is missed.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, when 
I became a physician, I took a Hippo-
cratic oath to do no harm. It has guid-
ed my actions and my conscience to do 
no harm. 
For the past 41 years, most Ameri-
cans, regardless of their views on abor-
tion, have agreed on one very simple 
principle: No taxpayer should be re-
quired to pay for abortion. We have 
agreed that Americans who believe life 
begins at conception should not be co-
erced by the government to violate 
their conscience. 
As a Senator, Joe Biden told his con-
stituents 
that, 
‘‘The 
government 
should not tell those with strong con-
victions against abortion, such as you 
and I, that we must pay for them.’’ 
That was Joe Biden then. 
Tragically, President Biden and our 
colleagues across the aisle now want to 
eliminate lifesaving Hyde amendment 
protections and force every U.S. tax-
payer to fund abortions through gov-
ernment spending. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and 
Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure 
Act, and ask for its immediate consid-
eration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
JONES). As the Chair previously ad-
vised, that request cannot be enter-
tained absent appropriate clearance. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DON 
CAMERINO GONZALEZ VALLE 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I want to honor the life of a 
family man, a entrepreneur, a commu-
nity member, and a friend. 
Don Camerino Gonzalez Valle, who 
passed away last week, embodied the 
American Dream. Camerino and his 
dad came to the U.S. to work in the 
Bracero program, just like my father 
had. 
Camerino didn’t fear hard work. He 
worked in the field, at meatpacking 
plants, as a taxi driver, and a bar-
tender. But he found success by appeal-
ing to our community’s cravings for 
food that reminded them of home. He 
founded Taqueria Los Comales in 1973, 
in our neighborhood of Little Village, 
serving delicious tacos al pastor, just 
like the ones you find in Mexico. 
His strong work ethic and good eye 
for business soon turned into a res-
taurant with a chain of over 25 
taquerias that went as far as Houston 
and Wisconsin. But Don Camerino was 
more than a businessman; he was, in a 
way, a father figure for many recently 
arrived immigrants who could find a 
plate of food and a job at his res-
taurants. 
On holidays, like Thanksgiving and 
Christmas, he would keep the res-
taurant open so that the immigrants, 
who were far from home, could feel 
closer to their country of birth. Our 
common respect and admiration for 
our immigrant community is what 
brought us together as friends. He was 
also adamant about preserving impor-
tant traditions, like la charreria, the 
Mexican-style rodeo, which he prac-
ticed with great discipline and honor. 
When I decided to run for office, he 
supported me. My wife, Evelyn, and I 
send our thoughts to Don Camerino’s 
family during this time. He will be 
sorely missed in our community. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF VERNON 
DEE MARTIN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Mr. Vernon Dee Martin of 
St. Simons Island, Georgia, who peace-
fully passed away on June 12 at the age 
of 78. 
Vernon was born in Oklahoma and 
moved to St. Simons Island in 1969, 
after accepting a position with the 
Coastal Georgia Regional Development 
Commission. At the time, he would be-
come the youngest executive director 
of a regional agency in the United 
States. It is at the Coastal Georgia Re-
gional Development Commission that I 
met Vernon, as I served as the chair of 
that commission during the time that 
he was executive director. 
Some of Vernon’s accomplishments 
include securing the Federal Law En-
forcement Center in Brunswick and the 
Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in 
Camden County. He also proudly served 
in the Georgia Army and Georgia Air 
National Guard for 40 years, retiring as 
a colonel. 
Through every position he had, he 
worked to better his community and 
improve the lives of others. One cannot 
visit Georgia’s First Congressional Dis-
trict without seeing the profound im-
pacts Vernon made for his community. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to share how the INVEST in 
America Act, which we just passed, 
will benefit residents of my district, as 
well as communities across the coun-
try. 
Year after year, the U.S. Congress 
has failed to muster the political will 
to properly fund American infrastruc-
ture. State and local authorities don’t 
have enough money to meet basic 
maintenance needs, much less to make 
investments in modernization, expan-
sion, or other improvements. 
Thankfully, the INVEST in America 
Act can change that. It provides $715 
billion to repair and improve our Na-
tion’s infrastructure, create good-pay-
ing jobs, and lay the foundation for ro-
bust economic growth in the 21st cen-
tury. 
I am proud to say that this package 
includes almost $21 million for projects 
to help communities in my district, 
small businesses, commuters, and resi-
dents. These projects include the rede-
sign of dangerous rail crossings, up-
grades to commuter transit stations, 
bike lanes, and safety improvements to 
areas like the Cobbs Creek Parkway, 
which is the site of hundreds of acci-
dents—many of them fatal. 
We have more work to do to get an 
infrastructure package to President 
Biden’s desk and signed into law, but 
passing the INVEST in America Act is 
an important step towards that goal. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. MOORE of Utah asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand in support of H.R. 18, the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act. 
For nearly half a century, Repub-
licans and Democrats shared a bipar-
tisan position that we should not use 
taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. Un-
fortunately, 
Democrats 
have 
now 
changed their mind. 
Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we 
codify the Hyde amendment, which 
protects the conscience rights of all 
Americans. We must also continue 
working across the aisle on solutions 
for low-income mothers and children, 
including 
housing, 
childcare, 
and 
healthcare to ensure every child is 
given equal opportunities, no matter 
the circumstances of their conception 
or birth. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3590 
July 1, 2021 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my profound support 
for life. 
Unfortunately, life is under attack in 
America right now. With the introduc-
tion of a Democrat budget that does 
not feature the Hyde amendment pro-
tections, taxpayers could soon be fund-
ing 
abortions—something 
that 
has 
been outlawed for many years. 
Ending these safeguards is both un-
popular and unrepresentative of the 
will of the American people. Taxpayers 
should not be forced to subsidize abor-
tions that destroy the dignity of life 
and millions of unborn babies in Amer-
ica. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
HUMAN RIGHTS ATROCITIES IN 
CHINA 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, as the Chinese Communist 
Party marks a century of power, Amer-
icans must renew our efforts to hold 
this regime accountable for its human 
rights atrocities. The Chinese Govern-
ment has imprisoned more than 1 mil-
lion Uyghurs, persecuting this reli-
gious minority for their fundamental 
beliefs. 
For 100 years, the Chinese Com-
munist Party has committed gross vio-
lations of human rights, mass impris-
onment, torture, and genocide. Now 
more than ever, Americans must stand 
strong with the people of China, Hong 
Kong, and Taiwan. We must support 
the Chinese people’s right to free ex-
pression, their right to privacy, and 
the right to life itself. 
As Americans celebrate the Fourth of 
July, we must remember that our free-
dom is much too precious to be taken 
for 
granted. 
As 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan said, freedom is a fragile thing, 
and it is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. 
f 
HONORING JOHN MCMAHON 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor the career of an exemplary 
public servant in my district. 
San Bernardino County Sheriff John 
McMahon will retire this month after 
36 years of service to the people of San 
Bernardino. 
His career started in 1985, when he 
was assigned to the Sheriff’s station in 
the town of Needles. And since then, he 
served in 15 different stations. He has 
served in every rank possible to hold in 
the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s 
Department, and he served as the sher-
iff of my county since 2014. 
In that time, the San Bernardino 
County Sheriff’s Department has be-
come known as one of the premier law 
enforcement agencies in the entire Na-
tion under his exemplary leadership. 
We thank him for his service to the 
people of our district, and we wish him 
and his wife, Shelly, the best of luck in 
retirement. 
f 
DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, re-
cently, if you look at the CDC num-
bers, we hit an all-time record in drug 
overdoses for a 12-month period at 
90,000. That is up from 45,000 only 6 
years ago. 
There are two dangerous trends that 
are going the exact opposite way than 
you would think, if we care about the 
people who died and their families. 
First of all, because of the antipolice 
hysteria out there, the number of po-
lice are being reduced; and for that rea-
son, at least in my area, they are no 
longer doing criminal investigations in 
some 
cities 
when 
there 
are 
drug 
overdoses. 
Secondly, I think the major reason 
for the massive increase in deaths is 
the 
increase 
in 
fentanyl 
deaths— 
fentanyl being actually much more 
dangerous than heroin. 
We now have this happening at a 
time when the Border Patrol is being 
pulled off the border to process unac-
companied minors and we have the hor-
rible situation of not even increasing 
the budget of the Border Patrol. 
Mr. Speaker, if we care about the 
90,000 people who die every year of drug 
overdoses, it is time to start caring a 
little bit more about the border and 
care a little bit more about the number 
of police we have in our country. 
f 
SLOVENIA TAKES THE HELM 
(Mr. GOSAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as the chairman of the U.S. Slo-
venia Friendship Caucus to commemo-
rate today, July 1, as the first day of 
the Slovenia’s presidency of the Coun-
cil of the European Union. 
Slovenia takes the helm of one of the 
EU’s main decisionmaking bodies at a 
challenging time not just for the EU, 
but for the world at large. Slovenia 
will manage a Europe working to con-
trol the COVID pandemic, seeking to 
repair the economic and social damage 
from this virus; all the while dealing 
with the ongoing and critical issues 
with the EU and the U.S., such as coun-
tering Chinese and Russian influence, 
bolstering cybersecurity, and charting 
an economic path for the future. 
As Slovenia begins its 6-month presi-
dency, it is doing so under the slogan, 
‘‘Together. Resilient. Europe,’’ which 
outlines an agenda where Slovenia 
seeks to facilitate the European recov-
ery while also reflecting on Europe’s 
future, strengthening the rule of law 
and European values, and increasing 
security and stability in the European 
neighborhood. 
Slovenia officials have also made 
their intentions known to Balkanize 
the EU through engaging Western Bal-
kan states which have yet been able to 
join. 
Slovenia’s 
presidential 
platform 
makes it clear they are up to the 
unique challenge. The challenge is not 
just recovering from a once-in-a-gen-
eration pandemic, but thinking strate-
gically to promote a more resilient Eu-
rope in the future. 
I wish our strong friend and ally, Slo-
venia, all the best. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. FITZGERALD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to stand for life and to speak 
about the removal of the Hyde amend-
ment from President Biden’s budget. 
The President’s decision to remove 
this lifesaving measure from his budget 
was disappointing, as this provision 
has been in every budget since its en-
actment in 1980. 
H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, would correct this mis-
guided omission from the President’s 
budget for codifying the Hyde amend-
ment into Federal law, preventing tax-
payer dollars from funding abortions. 
In no circumstance should any Amer-
ican be forced to go against their con-
science and publicly fund abortions 
with their tax dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration on H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request

ENDING CRISIS OF CRIME ON CITY 
STREETS 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, there is a 
crisis of crime on our city streets. Vio-
lent crime is up double digits in Se-
attle, Portland, Austin, Oakland, and 
major cities across our great country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3591 
July 1, 2021 
The increase in violent crime is the 
predictable result of liberal cities 
defunding and undermining their law 
enforcement, like in Austin, Texas, 
where the far-left city council cut $150 
million from their police budget. What 
did we see weeks later? A doubling in 
the number of murders. 
Just this week, the police chief of 
Oakland, California, begged publicly 
for the city council not to cut the po-
lice department budget because it 
would result in more crime. 
When you cut law enforcement budg-
ets, you reduce the number of law en-
forcement officers. When you reduce 
the number of law enforcement offi-
cers, more criminals will be on the 
streets. 
This is not rocket science. Stop at-
tacking, undermining, and defunding 
law enforcement, and the crisis of 
crime will stop being a crisis.

GETTING ANSWERS ON COVID–19 
ORIGINS 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
the COVID–19 pandemic has taken the 
lives of 4 million individuals across the 
world, including 600,000 Americans. It 
took the life of my mother-in-law, as 
well as the loved ones of many of my 
constituents in the community that I 
represent. 
As we safely reopen our communities 
and evaluate lessons learned, we know 
no one wants to see another pandemic. 
As we hear of the new delta variant, I 
know I am not alone in wanting an-
swers regarding the origins of COVID– 
19. 
Reports of this virus having escaped 
from a lab must be taken seriously and 
looked into, especially as CCP refuses 
to cooperate with investigations into 
COVID–19’s origins. 
As we mark the CCP centennial, and 
it continues its quest to be the world’s 
top economic, technological, and mili-
tary superpower, it is more important 
than ever that we get to the truth. 
This is a public health issue, eco-
nomic issue, and a national security 
issue that, as we saw over the past 
year, will impact each of us. 
f 
RESECURING SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, in the 100 
days Vice President Harris has been 
overseeing the border, an estimated 
500,000 immigrants and thousands of 
pounds of drugs have flowed over the 
border into our country. Despite clear 
evidence of a worsening crisis, the 
Biden administration continued to dis-
mantle effective policies. 
When I visited the border, Border Pa-
trol agents consistently expressed that 
eliminating the Remain in Mexico pol-
icy has brought on this current crisis. 
Now, the Biden administration is con-
sidering rescinding yet another suc-
cessful policy, title 42, which allows 
CBP to expel adult migrants. 
The data is clear. Human traffickers, 
drug smugglers, and criminals are ben-
efiting from the Biden administration’s 
open border policies. More fentanyl has 
been seized this year than in all of 2020. 
Deadly drugs like fentanyl are flow-
ing across the border into our commu-
nities, killing people in my district and 
all of our districts. Fentanyl was 
present in 75 percent of the overdose 
deaths in my home county of Luzerne 
County in the last year. 
An open border is not some faraway 
problem. 
Consequences 
are 
rever-
berating across America. We must send 
a strong message of enforcement and 
resecure our southern border. 
f 
CALL FOR NATION TO RECOGNIZE 
SLAVERY REMEMBRANCE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. I rise today as I always 
do, with great respect for all and love 
of country at heart. 
I rise today for a very special reason. 
Today is one of the days that I will 
cherish for the rest of my life. What I 
will do today is something that I be-
lieve will help us to commemorate an 
unfortunate 
circumstance 
that 
our 
country has been a part of. 
This is the day that I will have the 
opportunity to bring to the attention 
of the Congress of the United States of 
America a very special resolution. This 
is a resolution that is supporting the 
designation of Slavery Remembrance 
Day. 
The resolution proposes that August 
20, 2021, serve as the first Slavery Re-
membrance Day. And this is done to re-
mind us of the evils of slavery. 
Mr. Speaker, I have noticed that as 
time has passed during my lifetime, 
there have been those who have sought 
to whitewash, to sanitize, the evils as-
sociated with slavery. This is a nec-
essary resolution because this resolu-
tion will forever allow us to remember 
the horrors of slavery, the events that 
have 
shaped 
our 
current 
cir-
cumstances. 
Slavery was our seminal sin. It was 
the sin that has, for too long—cen-
turies, for too long—had an impact on 
the politics, the economics, the social 
standing of people in our country. 
This resolution reads as follows. I 
shall not read it in its entirety today, 
but there are some portions of it that 
are exceedingly important. 
Whereas this resolution may be cited as 
the ‘‘Original Slavery Remembrance Day 
Resolution of 2021.’’ 
For those who keep records, it is H. 
Res. 517. It has been filed, and it has 
more than 75 original cosponsors. I am 
saying original and more than 75 sim-
ply because, right up to the last 
minute, we were adding people, so more 
than 75 original cosponsors. 
I shall do all that I can to memori-
alize the persons who are original co-
sponsors, and I shall seek additional 
cosponsors of this resolution. 
Whereas the House of Representatives rec-
ognizes August 20, 2021, as ‘‘Slavery Remem-
brance Day’’ and commemorates the lives of 
all enslaved people while also condemning 
the act and perpetuation of slavery in the 
United States of America and across the 
world. 
Whereas we posthumously recognize the 
following Members of Congress, who served 
during and after the Reconstruction era, as 
honorary cosponsors of this resolution. 
Their names are listed. I will not 
read them today. I want to do some-
thing very special when these names 
are mentioned, and they shall be men-
tioned in the near future. But their 
names are all here, persons who actu-
ally served in the Congress of the 
United States of America. These are 
persons who merit a special place in 
history because of all that they had to 
endure to serve our country. 
Whereas, on August 20, 1619, the first 20 
enslaved Africans were brought to what is 
now Fort Monroe, then Point Comfort. 
At that time, the time that they ar-
rived, August 20, 1619, it was Point 
Comfort. History has a way of remind-
ing us of things. ‘‘Point Comfort,’’ the 
place where 20 enslaved Africans ar-
rived. Point Comfort. 
Whereas the House of Representatives rec-
ognizes August 20, 2021, as ‘‘Slavery Remem-
brance Day’’ and commemorates the lives of 
all enslaved people while also condemning 
the act and perpetuation of slavery in the 
United States of America and across the 
world. 
Whereas African tribal chiefs captured, 
enslaved, and sold their captives to trans-
atlantic slave traders. 
You can’t tell the story without tell-
ing the whole story. You have to tell 
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth. If there is a scintilla of 
a mistake in what I say, I would beg 
that people would contact me and let 
me know, because the truth about slav-
ery must be told. And the truth is that 
African people sold other Africans into 
slavery. 
Whereas over the period of the Atlantic 
slave trade, from approximately 1526 to 1867, 
millions of humans were abducted and 
shipped from Africa, and 10,700,000 arrived in 
the Americas as personal property. 
Whereas the majority of enslaved Africans 
brought to British North America arrived be-
tween 1720 and 1780. 
I do want to emphasize the fact that 
they were personal property, chattels. 
They could be bought; they could be 
sold. I do understand that this is a part 
of the history that we don’t cherish. It 
is a part of the history that we don’t 
care to recall, but it is a part of the 
history that we must remember. 
We cannot allow ourselves to think, 
for any amount of time, that history 
will never repeat itself, and we have to 
be ever vigilant as to prevent history

from repeating itself. This is why we 
must have a remembrance day. 
This is not the only remembrance 
day, my dear friends. We remember 9/ 
11, and it is commemorated for the 
lives that were lost. We remember 
Pearl Harbor. We remember January 6, 
the date of the insurrection. And my 
prognostication is that there will be a 
January 6 remembrance day. 
Days such as these, days that are in-
famous, should always be remembered 
in the annals of history, and they 
should forever live in infamy. But we 
have to remember these days. 
b 1145 
Whereas 6 percent of African captives were 
sent directly to British North America. 
Whereas by 1825, the population of the 
United States included about one-quarter of 
the people of African descent in what has 
been called the New World. 
Whereas the Middle Passage from West Af-
rica to the West Indies was dangerous and 
horrific for enslaved people. 
Whereas the Middle Passage carried moth-
ers, 
fathers, 
children, 
sisters, 
brothers, 
aunts, uncles, cousins, and individuals from 
all walks of life to slavery in the Americas. 
Whereas although the sexes were sepa-
rated, men, women and children were kept 
naked, packed—and even stacked, I might 
add—but packed close together, and the men 
were chained for long periods. 
Whereas according to some historians, 
about 12 percent of those who embarked did 
not survive the voyage. 
Whereas sharks followed the slave ships to 
feed on the bodies of slaves thrown over-
board. 
Whereas enslaved people suffered a variety 
of miserable and often fatal maladies due to 
the Atlantic slave trade and the inhumane 
living and working conditions. 
Whereas infant and child mortality rates 
were twice as high among slave children as 
among Southern White children. 
Whereas enslaved people often worked 
from sunup to after sundown, 6 to 7 days a 
week often without food for long periods of 
time. 
Whereas enslaved Black families lived with 
the 
perpetual 
possibility 
of 
separation 
caused by the sale of one or more family 
members. 
Stepping aside from the text for a 
moment, it has to be painful to hear 
this, to know that on the auction block 
a mother could be separated from her 
children and to know that on that auc-
tion block families would be separated 
and could be sent in different direc-
tions. 
Human beings were treated as prop-
erty. The suffering that they endured 
is unthinkable and unimaginable. It 
was suffering that not even the mind of 
Dante could imagine. They were per-
sons treated, to a certain extent, like 
animals. The enslaved Black families 
were human beings. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas it is estimated that approxi-
mately one-third of enslaved children in the 
upper South States of Maryland and Virginia 
experienced family separation in one of three 
possible scenarios: sale away from parents, 
sale with mother away from father, or sale of 
mother or father away from children. 
These are the horrors of slavery and 
the evils of slavery that we can never 
ever forget. Just as we never forget 
other horrors and just as we have re-
membrance days for them, we should 
have this remembrance day for slavery. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas Nat Turner was born into slavery 
in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1800. 
Whereas Southampton County was home 
to many plantations, and enslaved people 
outnumbered free Whites. 
Whereas Turner learned to read and write 
at an early age, a young age, becoming deep-
ly religious. 
Whereas Turner was sold to several dif-
ferent masters over the course of his life, the 
last time in 1830. 
Whereas Turner preached to his fellow 
enslaved people developing a loyal following. 
Whereas Turner began planning a revolt 
with a few trusted fellow enslaved men from 
neighboring plantations. 
Generally speaking, we honor people 
who fight being held in captivity. Gen-
erally speaking, they are held in high 
esteem, and they are celebrated for 
their desire to be free and their willing-
ness to fight for their freedom—gen-
erally speaking. 
But one has to ask: Where are all of 
the statues for Nat Turner? 
Where are all of the resolutions that 
have been written extolling the virtues 
of Nat Turner? 
The question must be posed: How can 
we honor those who enslaved to a 
greater extent than we honor those 
who suffered the horrors of slavery? 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas Turner began planning a revolt 
with a few trusted fellow enslaved men from 
neighboring plantations. 
Whereas Turner’s rebellion began in Au-
gust 1831, quickly growing from a small 
handful of enslaved individuals to more than 
70 enslaved and free Blacks. 
Whereas the rebels went from house to 
house 
in 
Southampton 
County, 
freeing 
enslaved people. 
Whereas the rebels were ultimately de-
feated by a State militia that had over twice 
the manpower of the rebels, with three artil-
lery companies reinforcing it. 
Whereas Turner was captured 6 weeks after 
the rebellion was put down, whereupon he 
was quickly convicted and sentenced to 
death. 
Whereas in retaliation for the uprising, 
Virginia officially executed 56 Black people 
with at least 100 more killed by militias 
through extrajudicial violence. 
We are now talking about people who 
were killed because other people fought 
for their freedom. 
Stepping aside from the text, we can 
never allow ourselves to sanitize the 
horrors of slavery. This resolution is 
important. There has to be a day of re-
membrance. 
Whereas the rebellion caused widespread 
panic among slaveholders throughout the 
South, resulting in widespread violence 
against enslaved people. 
Please, Mr. Speaker, understand, I 
take no great pride in reading this and 
presenting this. There is no great pride 
in this. There is pain. This is sinful and 
shameful, and we can never forget the 
horrors of slavery. 
Whereas in the wake of the rebellion, the 
Virginia General Assembly passed legisla-
tion making it illegal to teach enslaved free 
Blacks to read and write. 
I take no pleasure. 
Whereas the Underground Railroad was a 
network of individuals who helped around 
100,000 slaves escape to the North. 
Whereas the railroad began when a con-
ductor often posing as a slave would enter a 
plantation and attempt to guide runaways. 
(1200) 
Whereas the escapees would travel 10 to 20 
miles each night between safe houses or 
‘‘stations’’ to avoid detection, waiting in 
safe houses for the next along the line to be 
alerted to their presence. 
Whereas Ms. Harriet Tubman escaped from 
slavery along the Underground Railroad, a 
network of abolitionists who guided escaped 
slaves to the North, traveling primarily at 
night to avoid bounty hunters. 
My dear friends, my dear brothers 
and sisters, many of these persons were 
not of African ancestry. We didn’t get 
here by ourselves. There were people of 
goodwill, of many stripes who made it 
possible for us to have these opportuni-
ties that we have today. I thank them 
all. My prayer is that there will always 
be such people of goodwill to assist 
those who find themselves in harm’s 
way, due to injustice. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas Ms. Tubman returned to the 
South no less than 13 times to free 70 
enslaved persons, including much of her fam-
ily, for which she would be given the name, 
Moses. 
Whereas Ms. Tubman deftly led those she 
saved North during the fall and winter, when 
there would-be captors stayed inside to avoid 
the cold. 
Some things bear repeating. Whereas 
Ms. Tubman deftly led those she saved 
North during the fall and winter, when 
their would-be captors stayed inside to 
avoid the cold. 
Whereas in Ms. Tubman’s own words: ‘‘I 
never ran my train off the track, and I never 
lost a passenger.’’ 
Whereas during the Civil War, Ms. Tubman 
served as a nurse, scout, spy in the Union 
Army, becoming the first woman to plan and 
lead a military operation in the United 
States, liberating 700 enslaved people in 
South Carolina. 
Whereas the life of Ms. Tubman continued 
working to improving the lives of oppressed 
people, raising funds and building schools, as 
well as a hospital, in the name of formerly 
enslaved people, while participating in the 
women’s suffrage movement. 
Whereas John Brown, an abolitionist who 
ran an important stop on the Underground 
Railroad, dedicated his life to slavery. 
Whereas John Brown led a militia in gue-
rilla attacks on pro-slavery towns in Kansas, 
losing one of his sons in the struggle. 
Whereas John Brown, with the help of Har-
riet Tubman, planned and organized an inva-
sion of the South to free all slaves. 
One has to ask: Where are the statues 
of John Brown? 
One has to ask: How is it that we 
have statues within a short distance of 
where I stand now honoring those who 
would enslave, but not honoring those 
who would set the slaves free? 
One has to ask: How do these things 
happen? 
But one has to also be appreciative of 
the fact that their removal is almost a 
certainty now. 
One has to be appreciative of the fact 
that there are those among us who

have taken up the fight for freedom, 
and they have brought it to the very 
floor of this House of Representatives. 
I am grateful to those who have con-
cluded that we must remove the stat-
ues of those who would enslave, and my 
prayer is we will replace them with 
some statues of those who fought to 
free the slaves. This is my prayer. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas John Brown began his invasion at 
Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, but was sur-
rounded and captured by Federal troops led 
by Robert E. Lee, losing two more sons in 
the fight. 
There are still people alive today who 
don’t want John Brown to be cele-
brated. They don’t want the people who 
gave their very last breath, the very 
last ounce of their existence to the 
cause of freedom. Celebrate those who 
would enslave, but not those who would 
free the slaves. 
I am grateful to those people of good-
will who stand today to continue the 
struggle for liberty and justice for all, 
as extolled in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Whereas the 13th Amendment was passed 
by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified 
on December 6, 1865, and provides that ‘‘Nei-
ther slavery or involuntary servitude, except 
as a condition of punishment, except as pun-
ishment for a crime whereof the parties shall 
have been duly convicted, shall exist within 
the United States, or any place subject to 
their jurisdiction.’’ 
There is much more that can be said 
about the 13th Amendment. Because I 
do not say it at this time, I beg that 
you not charge me for not knowing 
some of the things that can be said 
about the 13th Amendment. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas beginning in the 20th century, Af-
rican Americans began to relocate from 
Southern farms to Southern cities, from the 
South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West, 
in a movement known as the Great Migra-
tion. 
Whereas 
the 
relocation 
of 
formerly 
enslaved individuals and their descendants 
also included unfavorable and, at times, un-
just interactions with law enforcement that 
often resulted in imprisonment and convict 
leasing. 
Stepping aside from the text, in 
Sugar Land, Texas, bodies were un-
earthed. In Sugar Land, Texas, 95 bod-
ies unearthed. Those who study these 
things have concluded that they were 
likely the victims of convict leasing. 
Convict leasing was a means by 
which slavery was continued by an-
other name. Convict leasing allowed 
laws to be used to have persons who 
committed petty offenses held in jail. 
They were detained. Couldn’t pay a 
fine. These Black Codes, as they were 
called, allowed for convict leasing to 
continue. 
Persons were arrested for just stand-
ing around, not having a job, put into 
the convict leasing program. And 95 
such bodies were found of persons who 
are thought to have been victims of 
convict leasing in Sugar Land, Texas. 
Just outside of my congressional dis-
trict, I might add. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas convict leasing, also known as 
slavery by another name, was a system that 
allowed persons to lease imprisoned individ-
uals to private entities, often corporations 
and plantations. 
Whereas the remains of 95 persons thought 
to be of African ancestry, who were sub-
jected to the State of Texas convict leasing 
system, were discovered in 2018, at the con-
struction site of Fort Bend Independent 
School District’s James Reese Career and 
Technical Center in Sugar Land, Texas. 
There is much more to be said about 
this. In the days and weeks to come, I 
shall say more about this and what has 
happened to these 95 persons, human 
beings, buried, to a certain extent, in a 
common grave area. 
Whereas while slavery was abolished, de-
scendants of the enslaved continue to live 
with the effects of slavery’s progenies: Jim 
Crow, mass lynchings, segregation, police 
brutality, mass incarceration, and institu-
tionalized racism. 
b 1215 
Stepping aside from the text, I am a 
son of the segregated South. I have ex-
perienced these progenies, some of 
them. Not all of them, of course. I am 
73 years of age. I have been blessed to 
live longer than many thought I would, 
not because of some illness, but be-
cause I was born Black. 
The prognosticators never projected 
or prognosticated that I would be 
standing here. There was nothing at 
my birth that would have given anyone 
reason to believe that I would stand 
here. And probably there was nothing 
that would give persons reason to be-
lieve that I would stand here and read 
this resolution. 
For many, this is a resolution that is 
not supposed to be filed; it is not sup-
posed to be heard. 
I am a liberated Democrat. I am not 
going to allow my agenda, the agenda 
of those who have suffered, to go unno-
ticed. It won’t happen on my watch. As 
long as I am in this House, I am going 
to remind us that we have a duty and 
a responsibility, as well as an obliga-
tion, to understand the evils of slavery 
and understand how they have not 
evaporated. They have not simply 
faded away. To this day, the progenies 
of the evils still haunt us. They haunt 
us in this very House. 
For those who are offended, I beg 
that you would forgive me, but I don’t 
have any recourse. Those who sent me 
here, they didn’t send me here to do all 
that I can to get along and go along. 
They sent me here to try to make a dif-
ference. I guess I have a case of the 
‘‘can’t help its.’’ 
I do what I can do, because I know 
my history, and I have suffered the 
pain from a progeny of slavery. 
Continuing with the text: 
Whereas despite the horrors of slavery and 
against all odds, enslaved people became 
thought leaders and revolutionaries and 
changed the course of American history. 
Too often they are forgotten, pushed 
aside. 
Too often, the history that they 
made is stolen. 
Too often the status quo will wait 
until they can find a proper person to 
attribute the history to. 
The status quo too often selects the 
persons that ought to be celebrated in 
history, and too often those persons 
are not the persons who suffered to 
bring the history to a better place. 
The status quo has many ways to de-
fend itself. The status quo can do it 
with the power of appointment. 
The status quo can do it by acknowl-
edging people and ignoring others. 
The status quo has many ways to de-
fend itself. 
I am reminded of the words of Vol-
taire. He reminds us that—and I am 
paraphrasing—it is dangerous to be 
right in matters where the established 
powers are wrong. 
So the status quo defends itself, and 
the true history is not always known. 
There will come a time, however, when 
the truth about some of the history I 
am aware of will be made known. 
Mr. Chairman, the House is not in 
order. Someone appears to be on the 
phone in the House. I ask that we kind-
ly investigate. This is a matter of seri-
ous concern, and a person ought not be 
on the phone in the House. It is con-
trary to the rules of the House. A per-
son ought not do this when a serious 
matter is being discussed on the floor 
of the House of Representatives. 
Doesn’t matter who that person is, 
by the way. And if the person doesn’t 
stop, I will put the person’s name in 
the RECORD, because I know who it is. 
I am not going to suffer that kind of 
disrespect. 
Resolved, this resolution may be cited as 
the ‘‘Original Slavery Remembrance Day 
Resolution of 2021.’’ That is section 1 in the 
short title. 
Section 2, Slavery Remembrance Day. 
That the House of Representatives: 
One, supports the designation of a ‘‘Slav-
ery Remembrance Day’’ to serve as a re-
minder of the evils of slavery. 
Two, condemns slavery and its evil prog-
enies; and encourages all to acknowledge the 
importance of slavery remembrance. 
I am grateful to the Speaker for al-
lowing the time. I am grateful to the 
majority leader. I am grateful to the 
whip. I am grateful to all of the chairs. 
I am grateful to the many persons who 
are cosponsors of this resolution. 
As I indicated, it was coming to me 
as I was moving to the floor, and I have 
found a note from my staff. I am eter-
nally grateful to my staff. 
Seventy-seven cosponsors. These are 
the persons who are part of what I be-
lieve to be a historic resolution. 
Those who are not should not be con-
demned. We simply but only ask that 
they would become cosponsors, and 
this can be accomplished quite easily. 
Contact my office and let us know that 
you would like to be a cosponsor. The 
love we have for you is not diminished 
one scintilla because you are not an 
original; it is not. I am not that kind of 
guy. I am interested in having persons 
of goodwill become a part of this reso-
lution. And there is much more that 
will be said and done as we move for-
ward with the resolution. 
I thank all of the persons who are 
here today. I appreciate the fact that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 1, 2021 
this House functions as efficaciously as 
it does. 
I am going to remember who was 
standing with the gavel at hand. I am 
going to remember the faces. This is a 
special moment in time. I will remem-
ber those who were to speak after me. 
I will remember this wonderful lady 
who is seated over to my left, who has 
always been so kind and so generous 
and gentle. 
I will remember the person who has 
prevented someone else from talking 
on the phone and who doesn’t allow it 
to happen in this House when there is 
business before this House. She is even-
handed; she treats all of us the same. 
I 
will 
remember 
the 
Parliamen-
tarian, who has allowed his COVID 
beard to continue. That is just a joke, 
friends. I want to bring a bit of levity. 
But the Parliamentarian has been very 
helpful, and all of those who are associ-
ated with the office, have been very 
helpful. 
I pray that on the August 20 or be-
fore, this resolution will receive a vote 
in this House so that this House can go 
on record, as it has gone on record for 
many other things, as supporting Slav-
ery Remembrance Day. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor now to 
yield back the balance of my time.

RECOGNIZING THE RICHMOND 
HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL TEAM 
(Mrs. MCCLAIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Richmond High 
School softball team, the Division 3 
State champions. 
As you know, softball, especially 
girls softball, has been very near and 
dear to my heart. 
The 
Richmond 
girls 
persevered 
through a hard-fought championship 
game 
against 
Buchanan, 
including 
being down 1 to 0 going into the sixth 
inning. 
After losing two of their first three 
games, the Richmond girls showed that 
they would not give up on their team 
and ended their season on a 22-game 
win streak. 
With everything that these students 
have had to fight through this year, 
softball has been their rock. They con-
tinued to fight to prove that no matter 
what adversity was in front of them, 
they would overcome it. 
We are all so proud of you. Congratu-
lations Richmond girls softball team. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to con-
gratulate Unionville-Sebewaing High 
School’s softball team, the back-to- 
back Division 4 State champs. 
The girls of Unionville-Sebewaing, 
also known as U-S-A, proved to the en-
tire State of Michigan that they re-
main at the top of Division 4 with their 
14–1 victory over Rudyard. 
Congratulations.

HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANCE OF 
GOVERNANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for your courtesies. And I 
begin with a clarion call. The Speaker 
wears many hats, and we have been in 
meetings where we have focused our 
legislative prowess, legislative ques-
tions, on voting rights. So, I think it is 
appropriate to begin today to say that 
a crisis is pending. 
I am stunned by this decision. I am 
aghast. I will not use the word ‘‘en-
raged’’ because action requires a calm 
and contemplative mind. 
Today, the Supreme Court upheld 
voting restrictions. They might have 
written it and said they upheld voting 
laws. They upheld voting restrictions 
in Arizona and signaled that challenges 
in new State laws making it harder to 
vote—my God, I am going to say that 
on this floor—making it harder to vote 
in spite of the constitutional privilege 
that is ensconced in the 13th, 14th, and 
15th Amendments that generates into 
the States the dignity of humanity, 
that citizens’ birthright is the right to 
be precise in your desires of your rep-
resentation. 
And then, it signaled in this article 
that challenges to new State laws mak-
ing it harder to vote would have a hos-
tile reception from a majority of the 
Justices. 
The vote was just as we expected. All 
the Court-packing—all the Court-pack-
ing—has borne fruit. 
Forgive me. I wanted to be on this 
floor speaking eloquently, if you will, 
about a myriad of things, but a 6–3 
vote, not even a light of difference: 
three who were not appointed by Re-
publican 
Presidents, 
and 
then, 
of 
course, the packing by the former 
President of the United States. 
By the way, I just want to make a 
public statement. I know the First 
Amendment has its privileges. I ask 
the media to call the former President 
‘‘the former President.’’ He is not the 
President of the United States. He is 
not ‘‘President’’ and his name. He is 
the former President. He is not ‘‘Presi-
dent’’ and his name at the border. He is 
the former President at the border, cre-
ating havoc. 
And havoc was created with this 6–3 
vote. The decision was the Court’s first 
consideration of how a crucial part of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 applies to 
voting restrictions that have a dis-
proportionate impact on members of 
minority groups. 
It was issued as disputes over voting 
rights have taken center stage. We are 
still suffering from the Shelby case of 
2013 that indicated that the Section 5 
provision is unconstitutional and has 
left us with no tools to deal with this. 
As Republican-controlled State legis-
latures increasingly seek to impose re-
strictions, new voting rules, we are in 
the fight of our life. 
I am on the floor of the House today 
to indicate that there is no divide in 
any of us, thanking the Congressional 
Black Caucus Chairwoman BEATTY on 
the urgency of voting rights, and the 
Judiciary Committee and the chairman 
of that committee, the subcommittee 
chairmen of that committee, and all 
the Members and staff, we needed this 
decision to be able to craft the record 
that is going to withstand and fight the 
battle and be able to pass what the Su-
preme Court cannot undermine with its 
decision. 
In fact, we must thwart its decision. 
We must protect the vulnerable. We 
must not allow the disabled to be 
videotaped in Texas. We must not 
allow the hungry and thirsty to be de-
nied water and food in Georgia. We 
must not allow judges to overturn 
willy-nilly the elections in Texas. 
We must not allow, if I might, the 
idea of a former officer of the United 
States—in fact, the Chief Officer of the 
United States. We must not allow that 
person to make a mockery of the order 
of government. 
There is but one President of the 
United States. That is President Joe 
Biden. There is but one Vice President, 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS. And 
they are effectively leading this gov-
ernment and this Nation. They are car-
ing people. 
President Biden is, as we speak, ei-
ther there or en route to the enormous 
tragedy in Surfside, Florida, to provide 
comfort 
but 
also 
to 
provide 
the 
strength of the Federal Government in 
any investigation that will proceed. 
That is the able work of the Florida 
delegation and this President. They 
will do their job, particularly those 
Members who represent that area, 
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and many 
other Members. 
But it is challenging to be thwarted 
in voting and to ignore the Constitu-
tion, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amend-
ments. 
So, today, I want to proceed with 
what I think is a necessary agenda that 
is so important to this Nation. I will 
talk about so many different aspects of 
the issue of governance, why voting is 
so important, and why we need to close 
the social and racial divide, or racial 
and social equity should be inter-
twined. 
Let me emphasize, if you will, the 
enormous difference that what we are 
going to be working on over the next 
couple of weeks is going to make in 
lives, and that is, of course, the child 
tax credit. 
Votes and winning the majority in 
2020 of the House and Senate by Demo-
crats, and, of course, the new President 
and Vice President, led us to the ex-
panded and improved child tax credit. 
It is a historical change that is a life-
line to the middle class and cuts child 
poverty. It provides children and their 
families 
with 
additional 
payments 
through the year that help them with

the cost of food, childcare, diapers, 
healthcare, clothing, and taxes. 
I will be in my town, Houston, Texas, 
on July 3—yes, the Independence Day 
weekend—to be able to open the eyes of 
my mothers and fathers caring for chil-
dren, that this is their legitimate op-
portunity to receive monthly pay-
ments, $250 per month per child and 
$300 per month for every young child. 
All the families in my community can 
feel more secure and better able to deal 
with the burdensome expenses that 
face them weekly and monthly. 
Let me be very clear: This brings 
America together, this idea of the child 
tax credit. But, let me remind you, it 
was because of our votes that elected a 
Democratic majority, not a majority 
that does not include a desire to work 
in a bipartisan manner. We do desire 
that. 
I think this is the first opportunity 
that I have had since the historic pas-
sage—maybe the second—a moment 
that I can say to the Chamber and to 
this historic CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a 
large thank you for bipartisanship that 
has brought about, after 38 years, the 
historic Juneteenth holiday that was 
celebrated because it was signed on 
June 17th, the first historic holiday on 
June 18th. 
Thank you to Opal Lee. Thank you to 
the initiator of the State holiday in 
Texas, Al Edwards. But more impor-
tantly, thank you to that teacher in 
the airport who stopped me and said: 
Thank you for Juneteenth. I can now 
teach the original sin of slavery to 
even elementary schoolchildren, not 
out of anger and hatefulness, but the 
whole story of America’s original sin 
and what liberation, emancipation, and 
freedom represent. 
Thank you for the quote about Presi-
dent Joe Biden that said: He may be 
known for many things in his adminis-
tration, but he will probably be remem-
bered for signing the Juneteenth holi-
day. 
I am grateful to my colleagues for al-
lowing me to lead, to have introduced 
that bill, the first Member of Congress 
to do so. I am grateful to Members of 
the other body—Senator MARKEY and 
Senator CORNYN—who rallied so that 
the Senate could move and that, in 1 
day, we could pass it in the House, the 
bill that I introduced that the Senate 
then took. 
To the leadership here, how much we 
exalted this body when it was a 415-per-
son vote. I hope with that vote that 
there are those thinking that: Wow, I 
voted for that. I am not finished be-
cause we are not finished. 
If anything reinforces that our jour-
ney is not finished, it must be the idea 
that, today, the Supreme Court ren-
dered a decision that completely turns 
upside down the writing of the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
led so ably by my colleague and friend 
Congresswoman TERRI SEWELL, a bill 
that will come through the House Judi-
ciary Committee. We will be able to be 
the fixers, the doctors, those who will 
hold the Constitution and say: The Su-
preme Court, though the highest body 
in the land, in this instance, because of 
the Court-packing, is wrong because 
the Founding Fathers did not intend 
for us to have a restraint on that unfet-
tered right of voting. 
My friends, we would not be in the 
midst of the debate right now on the 
INVEST Act that is going to provide 
such a new difference in our lives. That 
is because of the vote. 
I thank the chairman of the Trans-
portation Committee, Mr. DEFAZIO, be-
cause now that first step will be toward 
rebuilding the Nation’s roads, bridges, 
transit, rail, and we will be fighting 
against climate change. 
Look at our Western region, where 
hundreds are impacted, thousands, mil-
lions, but then they have lost tens 
upon tens, maybe hundreds of people, 
maybe, but certainly numbers who died 
from the enormous heat. 
We actually passed that historic bill 
today. I am very proud that part of it, 
working out of Energy and Commerce 
and working with Chairman PALLONE, 
we have provided real dollars to com-
munities for wastewater infrastruc-
ture. You know that is important. We 
have done that through the Clean 
Water State Revolving Fund. We have 
provided, I want you to understand, the 
historic funding level for drinking 
water, the State revolving fund, mak-
ing improvements to prioritize replac-
ing lead service lines that have plagued 
so many of our Midwestern States and 
Southern States, our public housing, 
improving water quality in schools. 
I know it well because my schools are 
old. Children before bottled water, with 
the historic water systems, were drink-
ing out of those old water fountains 
and addressing needs in territories, re-
forming the broken standard-setting to 
make it work better as it relates to 
public health and to eliminate toxins. 
b 1245 
The vote, the right to vote, is an ex-
tremely vital part, and as we have had 
the right to vote, and each Member has 
had the right, I am glad to publicly an-
nounce that I will have complete ref-
ormation of a historic street in my dis-
trict, Scott Street—the right to vote— 
with the grant that was awarded 
through me to Houston and metro and 
the city of Houston, which we will be 
announcing soon. 
Those of you living in and around 
Scott Street, the University of Hous-
ton, Texas Southern University, there 
will be a new light, a new opportunity. 
And then we will be able to expand on 
the Greenways project, neighborhood 
greenways. I have heard you. I have 
heard the neighborhood. And so we will 
have that opportunity. 
And through voting, the Jackson 
Lee-Espaillat amendment, it is in now, 
it is law, and it is going to the Senate 
to be finally passed. 
And I am going to be an optimist 
that we were able to have an amend-
ment in the Safe Streets program 
where funds are spent to give local gov-
ernments more control over where the 
funds for the new Safe Streets program 
are spent by requiring the State De-
partment of Transportation that ig-
nores local government. 
They are ignoring local governments 
right now in my community on I–45. 
They ignore them by expanding I–45 
and taking out houses and schools and 
buying 
up 
historic 
neighborhoods. 
They are wrong. TXDOT, you are 
wrong. And we will continue to inves-
tigate until you realize that you are 
wrong. 
But I have an amendment now that 
says that local governments must be 
heard, and they must be consulted with 
on the amount of dollars to help them 
carry out Safe Streets projects, and 
that is to use a Safe Streets program 
to set aside safety funds to reduce fa-
tality and serious injuries on public 
roads with a focus on vulnerable road 
users such as pedestrians, bicyclists, 
scooters, and motorcyclists. 
Why? People are dying. 
In my district, a woman stopped her 
car to help a handicapped person in a 
wheelchair get across the street, and 
another car hit her and the handi-
capped person and killed them without 
even stopping. 
Who needs to have the resources, but 
our local government? 
And then, of course, we have seen 
death take a toll on motorcycle riders. 
Bike Texas has been fighting for this. 
And we lost a young man a few years 
ago as he was riding his bike in the 
Heights area. He lost his life. I prom-
ised his family. 
The lady who lost her life pushing 
the wheelchair was Lesha Adams, 54, 
and she was helping Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ 
Perez to cross. Ms. Adams pulled over 
and got out, and as I said, another ve-
hicle struck them. And they were both 
killed. 
And on March 7, 2019, right before the 
pandemic, I went to the spot where 
David Leon Loya was killed in a colli-
sion with a school bus while riding his 
bicycle. That was the way he got 
around in the Heights. 
This is in their name, to make local 
governments take charge of those dol-
lars and to help stop that kind of vio-
lence, which it is. 
And then the motorcycle riders, they 
have motorcycle clubs, and they are ig-
nored. And in the name of Jamal Har-
ris that was killed around Mother’s 
Day or in May, this amendment was 
put forward. 
In the freeze we have suffered. People 
died. And so I have an amendment that 
was passed and will now become law 
that requires the EPA administrator to 
initiate a study on the distribution of 
wastewater 
infrastructure 
funds 
to 
rural communities, economically dis-
advantaged communities, and Tribal 
communities during the 20 fiscal years 
preceding. 
And the reason is, there has been the 
understanding 
that 
wastewater 
re-
sources in inner city infrastructure and

rural areas is poor, not working, and 
you feel the impact. I am grateful. But 
again, I am going to say voting. 
And then, of course, we know the 
freeze. So many died in early February. 
The President came to acknowledge 
something that we had never experi-
enced. Our whole grid shut down, which 
is why we need the American Jobs Plan 
in its totality. I stand with my friends 
in the Congressional Progressive Cau-
cus, the Budget Committee, and the 
Congressional Black Caucus, and all of 
the Democratic Caucus that we must 
go big. We must work with this bipar-
tisan legislation, but we must get cli-
mate change. We must get the care 
economy. And we must deal with the 
broadband and cyber. 
But the electric grids have been fail-
ing. And so my particular amendment 
implements a program under which the 
administrator may award grants to 
community water systems to carry out 
activities to educate and assist persons 
by the community water system in 
adapting and responding to bad acts 
and natural disasters, including sub- 
zero temperatures. 
What does that mean? It means that 
our pipes froze. People were still suf-
fering from freezing, and those pipes 
burst and destroyed homes. Not only 
did people die, they frozen to death be-
cause they had no electricity, and they 
had no water. 
And I remember standing and giving 
out water to thousands, being part of 
giving out water to thousands all over 
our community. We were giving out 
water in 2021. They had no water. Not 
only did they have no water, but it 
took a very long time. 
I will include a study to show you 
why wastewater is so important. The 
groundbreaking 2019 study and report 
is ‘‘Flushed and Forgotten: Sanitation 
and Wastewater in Rural Communities 
in the US.’’ And it was conducted by 
the Alabama Center for Rural Enter-
prise and the Columbia University In-
stitute for the Study of Human Rights. 
It indicated, sanitation is essential to 
everyday functions such as urination 
and defecation. Without a system in 
place to dispose of wastewater, individ-
uals experience environmental con-
tamination. The perpetual appearance 
of wastewater in and around homes 
that occurs when systems are absent or 
failing takes a significant toll on men-
tal health and the ability of individuals 
to live in dignity. 
Do you realize that that is occurring 
in America? That is why I am here 
today. 
And I am here today because no one 
is going to tell me with conditions like 
this that we don’t need the American 
Jobs Plan and that we don’t need the 
dollars that will stop flooding in Hous-
ton, which we have built up enor-
mously. 
No one is going to tell me that we 
don’t need the child tax credit for each 
and every one of you. That is why we 
will be in Houston on July 3. We will be 
in Houston July 3 because these chil-
dren need these resources. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how 
much time I have remaining, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 7 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to take a moment to physically 
hold this poster up and to emphasize 
how important our children are before 
I raise another very vital point. 
One, it was because of votes that we 
got the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program. And it will be because of 
votes that we got the pandemic child 
tax credit that you will get $250 for 
older children and $300 for younger 
children every single month. 
Meet me at the Saint John’s Church 
at 10 a.m. on July 3 to ensure that you 
get the right information. This is not a 
sales job. This is what voting and rep-
resentation is all about. 
I will conclude my remarks with 
something that has been, Mr. Speaker, 
very important, and I hope that its ex-
planation is one that is taken not his-
torically in the way that it should, and 
we ought not ignore the attack on de-
mocracy and to acknowledge the lead-
ership of this House for the January 6 
committee. I have worked on the select 
committee. I am a Member who was 
here for 9/11. And when I say ‘‘here,’’ I 
was literally in this Capitol and among 
others that fled out of this Capitol and 
watched the billowing smoke that was 
a result of the hit at the Pentagon as 
we were escaping. And so I take very 
seriously the issues of January 6. 
I will also briefly acknowledge the 
work that we have done with ensuring 
that Confederate statues were removed 
and put in a place of history but not a 
place that is a citadel of democracy 
when there were those that stood up 
against that democracy. 
I acknowledge the validity of the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
and pay tribute to his family who has 
sacrificed so much to try to make 
things right. 
But now I will proceed with what I 
think must be our next step with vot-
ing, and that is H.R. 40, the Commis-
sion to Study and Develop Reparation 
Proposals for African Americans Act. I 
want to take away any glare or mis-
understanding that this is a figment of 
our imagination, this is something 
that we should do in passing, it is an 
impossibility, it is a third rail, if we do 
this, something will happen. 
I welcome, and I am here, present, to 
speak to all of my colleagues, Demo-
crats and Republicans, but I want you 
to look at the back of this slave. The 
silence is deadening as to what oc-
curred for almost a quarter of a thou-
sand years; in bondage over 200 years. 
We have difficulty in detailing the 
actual facts of the precise brutality in 
every plantation and every nuance and 
every northern State and every south-
ern State and every western State and 
every eastern State because it was 
prevalent everywhere. There were dif-
ferent times when it ended. Certainly, 
December 1965 was when the 13th 
Amendment was so eloquently debated 
with difficulty, and it was passed. 
But H.R. 40 is the distinct oppor-
tunity internationally for America’s 
presence to be known that we are back, 
that we are willing to acknowledge the 
original sin. We are not here account-
ing for my neighbor, who will tell me 
that he or she did not have slaves. That 
is not the accounting that we are, in 
essence, looking at. We are not looking 
to be able to see whether or not my 
other neighbor just left slavery. 
Slavery is a part of America’s his-
tory. The DNA and the progeny of slav-
ery are here in America. You cannot 
ignore them. They are the foundation 
of this Nation. 
They built the place I now stand. 
Slaves. 
They built the White House. Slaves. 
They built infrastructure. 
They created cotton and made it 
king, never to be given any compensa-
tion for years of work. No health insur-
ance. No insurance. No workmen’s 
comp. No salary. 
But as the U.N. Human Rights Coun-
cil has said, reparations should not 
only be equated with financial com-
pensation, it should include restitu-
tion, rehabilitation, acknowledgment 
of injustice, apologies, memorializa-
tion, education, reform, and guarantees 
that such injustices won’t happen 
again. 
b 1300 
The legislation itself is a nonthreat-
ening and serious legislation. It is a re-
flection of what General Sherman tried 
to do. He tried to remedy the back that 
we see here today. He tried to give 40 
acres and a mule. 
Can you imagine the conglomerate 
that would have occurred if 5, 6, 10, 20 
slaves had come together with that? 
And believe me, slaves did not ask in 
anger. In fact, as they did not get it, 
they made their way. But as they made 
their way, we can cite 19 sites, almost, 
in America where what slaves built 
were destroyed. 
Greenwood, 100 years, is an example. 
Greenwood is an example of a cry for 
reparations. 
Mother 
Fletcher 
and 
Mother Randall. And our sergeant, her 
brother, articulate that they never got 
anything and all that they had in 
Greenwood was taken from them. What 
an unbelievable scenario that we are 
facing. 
Mr. Speaker, so my plea today is that 
as you’ve listened to me, I leave here 
to go fight for voting rights. But I also 
leave here with a challenge and an en-
couragement for the understanding of 
all that I have said. But, more impor-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3597 
July 1, 2021 
bust civil rights icon and legend, the late Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court, Thurgood 
Marshall. 
At the outset, Mr. Speaker, let me make this 
brief comment. 
Many of friends across the aisle, including 
Republican Leader McCarthy, have noted the 
fact that all of the persons affected by H. Res. 
503 were Democrats and none were Repub-
licans. 
This is hardly revelatory. 
After all, the Republican Party was founded 
in the 1850s because of its opposition to slav-
ery that Southern Democrats like future Vice 
President of the Confederate States of Amer-
ica Alexander Stephens boasted was the ‘‘cor-
nerstone of America.’’ 
In 1861, after the election of Abraham Lin-
coln as President, the eleven slave-holding 
states seceded from the Union, not to pre-
serve their heritage, but to keep their slaves. 
That led to the Civil War, in which more 
than 600,000 persons on both sides gave their 
lives and ended in the utter defeat and uncon-
ditional surrender of the Confederate Army led 
by its traitor general Robert E. Lee. 
Also, as a consequence of the Civil War, 
the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the 
Constitution were passed and ratified. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that at the time 
when it was needed most, the Republican 
Party was born and committed to the extinc-
tion of slavery. 
It was the pro-freedom, pro-civil rights party. 
The Democratic Party in those nightmarish 
days was centered in the ‘‘Solid South,’’ and 
proudly wore the label of the pro-slavery, 
white supremacy party. 
This was not lost on the American people, 
and for a century Black Americans overwhelm-
ingly self-identified with the pro-civil rights, 
anti-white supremacy Republican Party. 
Even after the national Democratic Party re-
nounced de jure racism and ‘‘states rights’’ at 
the 1948 DNC in Philadelphia, resulting in 
Strom Thurmond leading his fellow Dixiecrats 
out of the convention and running a failed bid 
for the presidency, Black Americans remained 
a core constituency of the Republican Party, 
while nearly all whites in the southern states 
were Democrats, distinguishing themselves 
from northern liberals by calling themselves 
‘‘Southern 
Democrats’’ 
or 
‘‘constitutional 
Democrats’’. 
All of this changed in 1964. 
That was the year the Republican Party 
nominated for president Sen. Barry Goldwater, 
an active and die-hard opponent of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. 
Southern Democrats saw in Goldwater’s 
support for ‘states rights’ a kindred spirit and 
vehicle to halt the federal government’s com-
mitment to extend the writ and guarantees of 
the Constitution to all persons in all regions of 
the country. 
Mr. Speaker, the result of that realigning 
election remains with us to this day. 
Before the Great Depression and the elec-
tion of Franklin Roosevelt, the overwhelming 
majority of votes cast by Black Americans 
were for Republican candidates. 
Even in the election of 1960, the parties 
closely competed for the votes of Black Ameri-
cans, with Republican Richard Nixon winning 
more than 35 percent. 
Fast forward to 1964. 
Republican Barry Goldwater was routed 
486–52 in an electoral college landslide and 
lost 43 states; Lyndon Johnson won the pop-
ular vote by 16 million votes (61–38 percent). 
Goldwater won only his native state of Ari-
zona and five Deep South I states—Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, and South 
Carolina. 
It is interesting to note that the five Southern 
states that voted for Goldwater swung over 
dramatically to support him; for example, in 
Mississippi, where Democrat Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt had won 97 percent of the popular vote 
in 1936, Goldwater won 87 percent of the 
vote. 
Lyndon Johnson would say the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 would cost Democrats the South 
for 50 years but it was worth it. 
What accounted for this change in voting al-
legiance, which persists to this day? 
The answer is simple and obvious, begin-
ning in 1964 the Democratic Party became, 
and was perceived by Americans, as the party 
of civil rights; the Republican Party not so 
much. 
So, Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that yes, 
the Confederate traitors whose statues are 
being removed from the Capitol were then 
members of the southern Democratic Party. 
The difference is that white supremacists 
have not been welcome or embraced by the 
national Democratic Party since 1948 and 
have been pariahs since 1964. 
We Democrats are not reluctant to remove 
and banish those who bring shame and dis-
honor to our cause of advancing equal justice 
for all Americans. 
I challenge our friends across the aisle to 
stop glorifying as ‘heritage’ a history of terror, 
injustice, violence, and racism represented by 
the persons whose statues are being removed 
and anyone who proudly waves a Confederate 
flag, like the one that disgraced the Capitol 
when it was paraded by domestic terrorists 
during the January 6 insurrection and attack 
on American democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. ROGER WILLIAMS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
due to President Biden’s failure to address the 
crisis at the southern border, I was not present 
in the House and unable to vote on June 30,

Had I been present, I would have voted

IN RECOGNITION OF ST. LUKE’S 
EPISCOPAL 
CHURCH 
ON 
ITS 
150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize St. Luke’s Episcopal 
Church on the 150th anniversary of its first 
service at its edifice on Wyoming Avenue in 
Scranton, Pennsylvania. The occasion will be 
celebrated with a service and open house on 
Friday, July 2, 2021. 
St. Luke’s Episcopal Church was incor-
porated at its initial location on Penn Avenue 
in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1852. Between 
1850 and 1860, the city rapidly expanded and 
increased in population, and a larger building 
was needed to accommodate the faithful who 
gathered each week to worship. The Lacka-
wanna Iron and Coal Company donated two 
lots in the 200 block of Wyoming Avenue for 
the new church. On July 5, 1866, the parish 
broke ground on its new building designed by 
top ecclesiastical architects Richard Upjohn 
and his son Richard Michell Upjohn in the Vic-
torian Gothic style. 
On July 2, 1871, the St. Luke’s Rector, the 
Reverend Able Augustus Marple officiated the 
first service with the Right Reverend William 
Bacon Stevens, the Bishop of the Diocese of 
Pennsylvania, delivering a sermon titled ‘‘the 
Lord in his Holy Temple.’’ The bishop adminis-
tered the rite of confirmation during a second 
service that day. Congregants were in awe of 
the beauty of the new church, calling it ‘‘an or-
nament to the city.’’ 
An architectural marvel, the church has 
been a significant structure in the city’s skyline 
for the past 150 years, towering above Wyo-
ming Avenue in the heart of downtown. It has 
undergone several renovations throughout its 
history. In 1905, the Jermyn family gifted a 
new altar and reredos, improvements to the 
chancel, a new baptistry, and new decor in the 
nave in honor of vestryman John Jermyn. The 
altar, reredos, and window design were done 
by Louis Comfort Tiffany of Tiffany Studios in 
New York. 
In 1898, Mary Throop Phelps funded the 
construction of the adjacent parish house in 
memory of her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Benjamin 
Throop. The Throop Memorial Parish House 
followed the national tradition of Episcopal 
parishes dedicating a parish house to serve 
the community. St. Luke’s provided a summer 
home for women and children, and under the 
direction of the then-rector Rogers Israel, the 
Parish House hosted the Girls’ Friendly Soci-
ety, the Boys’ Industrial Society, and a free 
kindergarten. 
Today, St. Luke’s continues to grow and 
prosper under the direction of priest-in-charge, 
Reverend Rebecca Barnes. She worked with 
the parish to establish Cypress House at St. 
Luke’s which offers social services in the 
greater Scranton area. The parish is dedicated 
to social justice initiatives and community out-
reach, and remains an open and welcoming 
Christian congregation with a tradition of musi-
cal excellence. 
I am honored to join with Mother Barnes 
and the entire congregation to celebrate St. 
Luke’s 150th anniversary on Wyoming Ave-
nue. The parish has been an essential part of 
the Scranton community, providing support 
and respite for those who need it and an inclu-
sive place for all to gather to worship. May St. 
Luke’s continue to welcome the faithful to its 
historic building for generations to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE N.E.W. COM-
MUNITY CLINIC 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the N.E.W. Community Clinic 
as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary. 
The N.E.W. Community Clinic serves Green 
Bay and the surrounding areas by providing 
quality, comprehensive and compassionate 
medical care to those who are underserved in 
our communities. The N.E.W. Community Clin-
ic’s mission is truly remarkable. Since the clin-
ic’s start on July 27, 1971, the N.E.W. Com-
munity Clinic has partnered with organizations 
throughout the Green Bay area. Given the ex-
ceptional quality care provided to patients, the 
N.E.W. Community Clinic has been recog-
nized by several healthcare organizations for 
their work. 
Over the last 50 years, the N.E.W. Commu-
nity Clinic has substantially expanded, both in 
size and the services provided. In 1975, just 4 
short years after their grand opening, N.E.W. 
Community Clinic gained the endorsement of 
the Brown County Medical Society and began 
working closely with all three local hospitals. In 
1987, the clinic opened a second location with 
support from the community through several 
funding initiatives. Today, the clinic has five lo-
cations throughout the Green Bay area where 
they offer dental care, lead screening, and nu-
tritional programs for individuals who are unin-
sured and underserved. To better serve the 
communities throughout Green Bay, the clinic 
also takes walk-in appointments, issuing refer-
rals to outside providers or medicals facilities, 
as well as offering pediatric care. 
For 50 years, the N.E.W. Community Clinic 
has upheld its mission of providing the best 
possible care to the people of Green Bay and 
Northeastern Wisconsin. Over 80 percent of 
the N.E.W. clinic patients stated that their im-
mediate health care needs were met through 
their visit, and 45 percent of those patients 
stated that the clinic prevented them from 
going to the emergency room. I commend the 
very important work does and dedication that 
the N.E.W. Community Clinic has shown to 
the Green Bay area and Northeast Wisconsin. 
I invite all members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the 
N.E.W. Community Clinic. The N.E.W. Com-
munity Clinic is a true credit to Northeast Wis-
consin and deserving of the highest degree of 
recognition.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SGT. 
JOSEPH A. COX, JR. 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Sgt. Joseph A. Cox, Jr. of 
Fort Wayne. Indiana. 
Four-plus years ago, tragedy struck when, 
on Sunday, February 12, 2017, Joe died unex-
pectedly while on duty. Prior to joining law en-
forcement, Joe was a combat veteran of the 
United States Marine Corps, Upon returning 
10 civilian life, Cox joined the Allen County 
Sheriffs Department. where he would serve for 
19 years. 
As a sergeant. Joe served in the Confine-
ment Division, Communications-Dispatch Cen-
ter. Civil, Warrants, and Patrol Divisions. He 
was also a member of the Honor Guard, 
SWAT Team and was handler to his beloved 
K–9 partner, ‘‘Gunny.’’ 
In addition to his work in law enforcement, 
Joe was an active member of his community, 
the consummate family man and a devout 
Christian. He was a member of Blackhawk 
Ministries, where he participated in programs 
Double Exposure and Marriage Matters. He 
also volunteered with Juvenile Justice Ministry 
of Youth For Christ. 
Today. we honor Joe’s memory by way of 
the Sgt. Joseph A. Cox, Jr. Memorial Park-
way, a roadway serving an area which Joe pa-
trolled for nearly twenty years. This is a testa-
ment to Joe and his peerless devotion to his 
family, community, and country. He is missed 
dearly, and though he is no longer with us, his 
legacy of service and selflessness endures.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RAILROAD 
COMMISSION 
OF 
TEXAS’ 
130TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
Railroad Commission of Texas on its 130th 
anniversary. 
Established in 1891 by the Texas Constitu-
tion, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) 
was created for the purpose preventing dis-
crimination in railroad charges and estab-
lishing reasonable tariffs. As the first regu-
latory agency created in the State of Texas, 
their primary responsibility included covering 
rates and operations of railroads, terminals, 
wharves and express companies. 
In 1917, the Texas Legislature expanded 
the Commission’s authority after declaring 
pipelines to be common carriers, thereby pro-
viding the agency the ability to administer con-
servation laws related to oil and gas. In March 
1919, their jurisdiction would once again in-
crease to include pipeline safety as well as the 
safety of alternative fuels, natural gas utilities, 
and the surface mining of coal and uranium. 
In the decades which would follow, the 
RRC’s authority evolved to meet the needs of 
our rapidly growing state. While its rail func-
tions have since been transferred to the Texas 
Department of Transportation, the Commis-
sion’s oversight has extended to include not 
only oil and gas exploration and production, 
but also pipeline transporters, the natural gas 
and hazardous liquid pipeline industry, natural 
gas utilities, the LP-gas industry, and coal and 
uranium surface mining operations. 
In recent years, the Commission has mod-
ernized technology for increased efficiency 
and has expanded transparency by providing 
the public with needed tools to access agency 
information. Further, the dedicated efforts of 
its professionals have contributed to the 
streamlining of operations while promoting in-
creased innovation and energy independence. 
For over 130 years the Railroad Commis-
sion of Texas has maintained a unified and fo-
cused mission of protecting the public, envi-
ronment, and economy of Texas. As the oil 
and gas industry continues to be an essential 
component of Texas’ success story, I con-
gratulate the Railroad Commission of Texas 
and its employees on this milestone anniver-
sary and wish them continued success as they 
continue to protect the state’s natural re-
sources, environment, and public safety.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIR COLA 
FOR SENIORS ACT OF 2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduced the Fair COLA for Seniors Act of 
2021, which would require using the Con-
sumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI–E) 
when calculating cost of living adjustments 
(COLAs) for federal retirement programs. The 
proposed index would adjust the benefits pro-
grams such as Social Security, Supplemental 
Security Income, civil service retirement, mili-
tary retirement, veterans’ pensions and com-
pensations, and other retirement programs. 
Current law uses the Consumer Price Index 
for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers 
(CPI–W) which measures costs solely of work-
ing individuals—unlike most Social Security 
beneficiaries. Using CPI–W does not ade-
quately consider the rising expenditures of re-
tirement, such as housing and healthcare 
costs. This inadequate accounting amounts to 
an effective decrease in benefits for those who 
rely on these federal programs. The proposed 
change will lead to increased COLAs, ensur-
ing that seniors are able to keep up with the 
rising costs of their real-world expenses. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives 
PINGREE
(D–ME), 
BEATTY
(D–OH), 
FITZPATRICK
(R–PA), STRICKLAND
(D–WA),

SARY OF THE WILLIAM BEAU-
MONT ARMY MEDICAL CENTER 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th Anniversary of 
the opening of William Beaumont Army Med-
ical Center in Fort Bliss, Texas. 
The William Beaumont Army Medical Center 
first opened in July 1, 1921 and has since be-
come a major medical asset for the U.S. 
Army—serving the needs of countless sol-
diers, veterans, military families, and El Paso 
residents. Whether through assisting victims of 
the August 3rd, 2019 domestic terrorist shoot-
ing or working day and night during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the medical center has 
always helped our community and continues 
to be an invaluable resource for El Pasoans. 
As the United States Army prepares to open 
one of the most advanced medical facilities in 
the country, the El Paso community is thankful 
for the Army’s support and wishes William 
Beaumont Army Medical Center the best of 
luck as it begins its years of service. 
Again, I am pleased to recognize the open-
ing of William Beaumont Army Medical Center.

JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE 
LIBRARY 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, on June 29, 
2021, during debate on H.R. 3005, To direct 
the Joint Committee on the Library to replace 
the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old 
Supreme Court Chamber of the United States 
Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall to be 
obtained by the Joint Committee on the Li-
brary and to remove certain statues from 
areas of the United States Capitol which are 
accessible to the public, to remove all statues 
of individuals who voluntarily served the Con-
federate States of America from display in the 
United States Capitol, and for other purposes, 
one of my colleagues in the majority argued 
that she held no responsibility for delays in ap-
proving North Carolina’s request to replace the 
Charles Aycock statue, due to the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library (JCL) only formally orga-
nizing on June 23 for the 117th Congress. 
However, this argument left out important 
context about the series of events related to 
the JCL this year. As my colleague knows, 
Democrats have controlled both the House 
and the Senate since January and at any time 
could have passed their respective resolutions 
appointing members to the JCL, allowing it to 
organize. But it took until April 16 and May 26 
for the House and Senate to pass their re-
spective resolutions. Even with those delays, 
the committee could still have been organized 
at any point after May 26. Yet it still took near-
ly a month, until June 23, for the committee to 
formally organize. Throughout this entire Con-
gress, the Democrats have been in the driver 
seat of the JCL, despite my colleague’s rep-
resentation otherwise. 
It is clear that Democrats have needlessly 
delayed the work of the JCL. Therefore, as I 
said in my remarks, if Democrats were truly 
concerned about the presence of offensive 
statues in the U.S. Capitol, they might start by 
being quicker to act on the business of the 
Joint Committee on the Library.

TRIBUTE TO FORMER ALABAMA 
CONGRESSMAN SONNY CALLAHAN 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today with a heavy heart to pay tribute 
to the memory of one of my closest friends, 
former Congressman H.L. ‘‘Sonny’’ Callahan, 
the gentleman from the great state of Ala-
bama, who peacefully passed away on June 
25, 2021. Sonny and I became quick friends 
upon his arrival to Washington in 1985. His 
humor and zeal for practical jokes were as en-
dearing on Capitol Hill as his ability to forge 
alliances across the aisle to create effective 
policy and legislation for the American people.

July 1, 2021 
As colleagues on the Appropriations Com-
mittee, Sonny and I traveled the world to-
gether, meeting with leaders from Singapore 
to Argentina to Israel and many nations in be-
tween. His gregarious nature was as prevalent 
during those international meetings as it was 
at home in the heart of Alabama. Sonny ex-
tended genuine kindness and friendship to 
folks across all walks of life and never lost the 
staunch work ethic that helped him build a 
successful trucking business in Alabama. Be-
fore being elected to Congress as a registered 
Republican, Sonny dedicated 12 years to the 
Alabama state legislature, serving both cham-
bers as a registered Democrat—proving he 
could get along with leaders of all political per-
suasions. 
I always had great admiration for the fact 
that Sonny was a Navy Veteran of the Korean 
War. There was no one he fought harder for 
in Washington than our veterans and current 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces. He be-
lieved in building a stronger national defense, 
advocating for better care for our veterans, 
and reenforcing foreign aid for key allies in the 
Middle East, especially Israel. 
It is one of the greatest honors of my life-
time to have served alongside my friend 
Sonny for 18 years in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. As President Abraham Lincoln 
once wrote, ‘‘the better part of one’s life con-
sists of his friendships.’’ Sonny Callahan is 
one of the most beloved leaders of Alabama 
and Washington, D.C., and I will always con-
sider him one of my closest friends. My wife 
Cynthia and I extend our deepest heartfelt 
sympathy to the Callahan family and the great 
wealth of friends he made across the country, 
and indeed around the globe.

AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the INVEST Act. 
This bill represents a substantial investment 
in American infrastructure that will touch every 
corner of this country . 
It will rebuild crumbling highways and 
bridges, reduce traffic congestion, enhance 
auto and pedestrian safety, expand transit op-
tions, help local governments finance their in-
frastructure and capital needs, and commit our 
nation to clean energy future. 
I want to thank Chairman DEFAZIO and 
Chairwoman NORTON for working with me to 
include in this bill the Metro Accountability and 
Investment Act (H.R. 694), which helps the 
federal government meet its financial obliga-
tions to the national capital’s transit system. 
The bill increases the existing federal com-
mitment to Metro, provides annual operating 
funds for the first time, and conditions new 
funding on important accountability and ethics 
reforms that will strengthen the role and inde-
pendence of the WMATA Inspector General. 
I also welcome the reinstatement of the 
Build American Bonds program, a direct sub-
sidy bond program that helps municipalities 
access financing for infrastructure project and 
which I have previously championed with my 
own legislation.

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR

TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as 
the senior Texas Member of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee, I strongly 
support House passage of H.R. 3684, the IN-
VEST in America Act. I inserted numerous 
provisions into the bill, including one to estab-
lish a grants program in the Department of 
Transportation to develop transportation work-
force training programs for workers adversely 
affected by industry automation, and another 
to assist communities to retrofit transportation 
infrastructure that creates obstacles to their 
mobility and employment opportunities to pro-
vide greater transportation equity. 
The INVEST in America Act authorizes a 
tremendous funding boost to our nation’s sur-
face transportation and infrastructure system, 
providing just under $550 billion over five 
years and bringing over $27 billion to my state 
of Texas. In addition to highways, roads and 
bridges, the bill makes a substantive invest-
ment in our nation’s transit system as well as 
our passenger and freight rail system, and 
makes great strides to improve environ-
mentally friendly policies by encouraging and 
funding alternative modes of transportation 
and decreasing traffic congestion to reduce 
carbon emissions and the harmful effects of 
climate change. Moreover, according to the 
Council of Economic Advisors, for every $1 
billion in Federal highway and transit invest-
ment, approximately 13,000 well-paying do-
mestic jobs are supported for one year. 
With respect to funding for passenger and 
freight rail, the bill provides a total of $95 bil-
lion in authorized funding, while specifically: 
Tripling funding for Amtrak to $32 billion. 
Providing funding for corridor planning and 
development of high-speed rail projects such 
as the Texas Central project, a proposed high- 
speed rail line between Dallas and Houston. 
Improving rail safety by addressing highway- 
rail grade crossings needs, requiring additional 
rail safety inspectors, addressing trespasser 
and suicide fatalities, and eliminating gaps in 
railroad safety. 
My congressional district, Texas’ 30th, in-
cludes the International Inland Port of Dallas 
(IIPOD), an intermodal and logistics district 
that encompasses 7,500 acres and five mu-
nicipalities while supporting over 17,000 jobs. 
The Dallas Inland Port is also supported by 
Union Pacific, who added an intermodal ter-
minal nearly 20 years ago to increase Class 
I’s Dallas/Ft. Worth container capacity. The 
Union Pacific Dallas Intermodal Terminal also 
provides intermodal access to the Ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach. 
The freight railroads invest $25 billion per 
year of their own private money into their net-
works and are critical partners in efforts to re-
duce transportation-related greenhouse gas 
emissions. Given the importance of freight rail, 
not only to the Inland Port of Dallas but to 
ports nationwide, I encourage the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure to con-
tinue to work with the freight railroad industry 
as the INVEST Act advances towards a 
House-Senate conference committee.

THADDEUS

YEARS 
OF 
COACHING MARYLAND’S YOUTH 
THROUGH CLUB LACROSSE 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. BROWN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Thaddeus C. Sheehy, Sr., upon 
his retirement from 25 years of coaching 
Maryland’s youth through club lacrosse. 
Coach Sheehy served the community as a 
dedicated volunteer, coaching Maryland’s sons 
by not only teaching them the game of la-
crosse but also instilling in them life lessons 
along the way. This commitment to help build 
character in his players and ensure their 
growth as leaders also extended to his own 
family, as Mr. Sheehy coached his three sons, 
Thaddeus, Jr., Sean, and Liam. 
Coach Sheehy, a 1988 graduate of Saint 
Mary’s Parish High School located in down-
town Annapolis, learned the importance of 
servant leadership through Saint Mary’s var-
sity lacrosse program. Coach Sheehy took this 
servant leadership philosophy into the Annap-
olis Lacrosse Club Bay Raiders, with the mis-
sion to help young men get better at the sport 
they love while giving back to their community 
and those who protect it. 
Francis McAndrews, who coached with Mr. 
Sheehy for 18 years including his last season 
as the Face-Off Coach of the Bay Raiders, 
commended his dedication and skills noting, 
‘‘Coach Sheehy placed the development of the 
entire player at the forefront of the team’s pri-
orities. For 18 years I worked alongside him to 
build leadership through the C–4: character, 
commitment, confidence, and courage in our 
young men, and I am proud to call Tad my 
friend. Tad had a successful style of building 
character through humor and was known to 
give each boy on the team a nickname—and 
very often those nicknames stuck well after 
their lacrosse careers!’’ Coach Sheehy could 
often be heard asking his players—‘‘what have 
you done for your academics, what have you 
done for your family, and what have you done 
for lacrosse today?’’ 
Sheehy coached the Annapolis Lacrosse 
Club Bay Raiders to be Maryland State Cham-
pions in 2015 and helped to take four teams 
to Anne Arundel County Champions in 2014, 
2015 and 2016. He was honored with the Life-
time Achievement in Coaching Award by the 
Annapolis Lacrosse Club Bay Raiders, while 
at his last lacrosse tournament on June 20, 
2021. 
I am honored to recognize Coach Sheehy 
today for his 25-year commitment to help 
shape Maryland’s young men and athletes into 
servant leaders, and for his leading by exam-
ple through his service to the Annapolis com-
munity.

HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
BISHOP 
MICHAEL 
SHERIDAN 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the leadership and service of Bishop Mi-
chael Sheridan in the Diocese of Colorado 
Springs, Colorado. 
When Bishop Sheridan arrived in Colorado 
Springs from Saint Louis in 2002, the diocese 
was still considered mission territory. Over the 
past two decades, Bishop Sheridan has 
worked tirelessly to ensure that, no matter 
where they live in the diocese, Catholics are 
served by a parish and a pastor. Under his 
leadership, several new parishes were estab-
lished, and where existing churches were in-
adequate to serve the growing Catholic popu-
lation, new ones were built. 
More importantly, Bishop Sheridan has 
overseen a robust vocations program that has 
attracted many seminarians, resulting in the 
ordination of new priests nearly every year 
since 2010. 
Bishop Sheridan is also known as an in-
credibly effective communicator and teacher of 
the Catholic faith. For over 10 years, he 
hosted a weekly radio show in which he inter-
viewed a wide variety of Church leaders, 
theologians, authors, and other experts. This 
outreach provided an invaluable opportunity 
for Catholics in Colorado to gain deeper 
knowledge of the issues facing the church lo-
cally and around the world. 
Bishop Sheridan is passionate about Catho-
lic education, and he did everything in his 
power to support and strengthen Catholic 
schools in the diocese. Notably, he made sure 
that tuition assistance was available for fami-
lies who had limited financial resources but 
wanted a Catholic education for their children. 
He also worked with local leaders of all faiths 
to support school choice so that all parents 
could have access to the best educational op-
tions for their children. 
Bishop Sheridan has been a strong advo-
cate for the poor and marginalized, and he 
has never flinched in the face of pressure to 
abandon or hide our brothers and sisters in 
need. In one of his most important accom-
plishments, Bishop Sheridan played an enor-
mous role in the construction of Marian House 
soup kitchen in 2008, and the adjacent 
Hanifen Center in 2009. Those two facilities 
have served hundreds of thousands of people 
since their opening with meals, emergency 
aid, employment assistance, and many other 
services. 
Under Bishop Sheridan’s leadership, the di-
ocese has also expanded its Respect Life 
Apostolate, which works to protect life from 
conception to natural death. This includes sup-
porting mothers in crisis pregnancies with 
baby items and adoption services, advocating 
for pro-life legislation on the local and national 
levels, and working to expand outreach to 
those who are imprisoned or homebound. 
Leaders are also judged by how they man-
age during difficult times. During his tenure, 
Bishop Sheridan led the faithful of a church 
that has been shaken by revelations of past 
mistakes. He has led during a time when the 
church is criticized both for defending itself 
and for advocating for its beliefs. He also 
helped navigate the uncertainty caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
As Bishop Sheridan embarks on a well- 
earned retirement, it is my highest privilege to 
honor and thank him for being a faithful serv-
ant to Colorado’s Fifth Congressional District.

IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN ROBERT 
‘‘BUZZ’’ 
BUSWELL 
AS 
TEN-
NESSEE’S 
SECOND 
DISTRICT 
VETERAN OF THE MONTH 
HON. TIM BURCHETT 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Purple Heart recipient and Vietnam War 
veteran Captain Robert ‘‘Buzz’’ Buswell as 
Tennessee’s Second District Veteran of the 
Month. 
Captain Buswell enlisted in the U.S. Army in 
1968 as a first lieutenant. In 1970, his platoon 
was attacked in Cambodia by enemy forces 
and he sustained extensive injuries. He was 
hospitalized for 19 months and received 27 
surgeries. He fought for his recovery and even 
had to relearn how to walk. He retired from 
the military as a captain in 1972. 
Buswell, whose father was a career officer 
in the U.S. Air Force, met his wife Donna in 
their high school glee club in New Hampshire. 
They have a son and a daughter. 
Captain Buswell received numerous medals 
and commendations for his service, including 
the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star Medal, the 
Army Commendation Medal with ‘‘V’’ Device, 
and the Combat Infantryman Badge. Just this 
year, Buswell was chosen as one of the na-
tion’s 2021 Purple Heart Patriot Project hon-
orees. 
After his military service, he earned his 
Master’s Degree in education and spent many 
years serving East Tennessee communities. 
He worked for the Boys & Girls Club, the Knox 
County Fire Prevention Bureau, and served as 
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s 
Hurricane Katrina ombudsman for Knoxville 
and Knox County. In 2012, when I was mayor, 
I had the honor of working alongside Buswell 
when he took the position of Knox County’s 
veteran service officer. He continues that work 
today as the county’s Director of Veteran and 
Senior Services. 
If there’s a veteran issue, program or event 
taking place in East Tennessee, it’s almost 
certain that Buswell is involved. He is an ac-
tive member in numerous veteran organiza-
tions. These include being a Life Member of 
the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Dis-
abled American Veterans, the Veterans of For-
eign Wars, and the American Legion. He 
helped charter the Vietnam Veterans of Amer-
ica Captain Bill Robinson Chapter 1078. His 
service to fellow veterans also includes in-
volvement with the Veterans Regional Mental 
Health Council, Honor Air Knoxville, and 
Wreaths Across America. Through the United 
Veterans Council of East Tennessee he estab-
lished a program serving hundreds of veterans 
free breakfast on Saturdays. 
Captain Buzz Buswell is a true American 
hero. He sacrificed to protect our country and 
fight for our freedoms. And he’s spent count-
less hours taking care of fellow veterans, mak-
ing sure they have the support they need and 
the recognition they deserve. 
I thank him for his service. It’s an honor to 
call him my friend.

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL OF 
THE 
GROSSMONT 
UNION 
HIGH 
SCHOOL DISTRICT 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of the centennial of the Grossmont 
Union High School District, a family of 17 high 
schools and programs serving more than 
20,000 of my constituents in California’s 50th 
Congressional District. 
In 1832, Abraham Lincoln said of education: 
‘‘I can only say that I view it as the most im-
portant subject which we as a people can be 
engaged in.’’ 
Four score and nine years later, a school 
district was established in El Cajon, California, 
with construction on its first school beginning 
in 1921. This same building is now the 
Grossmont Union High School District’s cen-
tral office, which serves as an enduring sym-
bol of East San Diego County’s commitment 
to the centrality of education and advance-
ment of every student. 
The Grossmont Union High School District 
takes special and deserved pride in its rich 
history—now made modern with safe and cut-
ting-edge campuses that support world-class 
academics. These schools meet the most fun-
damental mission: Empowering students to 
take their place as the leaders of tomorrow. 
I congratulate Trustees Rob Shield, Elva 
Salinas, Gary Woods, Jim Kelly, and Chris-
topher Fite, as well as Superintendent The-
resa Kemper and the thousands of dedicated 
educators and workforce that have engaged 
this most important subject for the past 100 
years.

who recently lost his battle with lung cancer 
after spending his life serving his community 
and his country. Dale graduated from Pennsyl-
vania State University with a Bachelor of Arts 
Degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences before 
going on to graduate from the University of 
Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business 
with a Master’s Degree in Business Adminis-
tration. He also attended the United States 
Defense Language Institute, where he was 
awarded an Associate of Arts Degree in Ara-
bic. 
Dale served as a Cryptologic Arabic Lin-
guist, Sergeant E–5 in the United States Ma-
rine Corps from 1999 to 2004. Dale not only 
honorably served his country in Iraq, he was 
at the forefront of the search for weapons of 
mass destruction in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
For his brave service, Dale was awarded the 
Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal 
(with Combat ‘‘V’’), the Marine Corps Good 
Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment 
Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, 
the Presidential Unit Citation-Navy, and the 
Marine Corps Rifle Badge (Sharpshooter). 
After his return from Iraq, Dale worked as a 
program manager for 6 years for Poole & As-
sociates as well as SAIC. In 2010, Dale joined 
General Dynamics where he became a Senior 
Program Manager and ultimately rose to the 
level of Director. 
In 2014, Dale played an important role in 
Range Generation Next (RGNext) (a joint ven-
ture of General Dynamics IT and Raytheon) in 
bidding 
and 
winning 
the 
United 
States 
Airforce’s Launch and Test Range Integrated 
Services Contract valued at $2 billion. The 
contract provided a sole prime contractor re-
sponsible for operations, organizational and 
depot-level 
maintenance 
as 
well 
as 
sustainment at Cape Canaveral Air Force Sta-
tion and Vandenberg Air Force Base. This 
was a significant and transformational contract 
which included the engineering support to all 
Space launch activities. RGNext was awarded 
this contract in April of 2015, and Dale was 
subsequently appointed as Deputy Program 
Manager of the contract. In this role he fo-
cused on mission and program leadership, or-
ganizational 
development, 
new 
business 
change proposals, and day to day manage-
ment activities of the broad contract. Dale ex-
celled in working with people and enjoyed the 
comradery of building successful teams in the 
workplace. His RGNext co-workers have 
shared with me that his constant mentorship 
helped them professionally and personally and 
they will forever be better for it. 
As a non-smoker and fitness advocate with 
no family cancer history, it is strongly sus-
pected by his doctors that Dale’s terminal lung 
cancer was most likely due to his exposure to 
Yellow Cake Uranium and Burn Pit toxicities 
during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Dale’s life un-
derscores the need for the U.S. government to 
support veterans like him, who have been ex-
posed to dangerous agents in the theatre of 
war and now face sickness or even death. We 
must uplift our veterans and honor their sac-
rifice to our country. 
Dale did an outstanding job while here on 
earth, and he served our country fearlessly. 
He made a difference in his professional ca-
reer, and his many co-workers have described 
him as incredibly personable, a great sup-
portive leader, a wonderful person, and a de-
pendable friend whose love for his family was 
always self-evident. I believe one thing Dale 
had in common with my fellow East Ten-
nesseans was his deep respect for his country 
that drove him to spend years in service both 
at home and abroad. Those who had the op-
portunity to interact with him have shared with 
me how very friendly and an openly giving 
person he was and will be remembered for all 
of eternity as. Dale will forever be cherished 
as a loving family man to his wife, Erin, and 
his sons Henry, Nathan, and George. Those 
who could find a way to describe him in a sin-
gle short sentence would say he was and will 
forever always be a patriotic Marine veteran 
and a loving family man. All those touched by 
his life are better for knowing him.

HONORING REVEREND CURTIS 
WEST HARRIS 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Reverend Curtis West Har-
ris, for whom a post office in my district is 
being named next week following enactment 
of H.R. 3847 last year. He was an influential 
and well-respected member of our community, 
who fought for social justice all his life. 
Reverend Harris was a trailblazer. Born in 
Dendron, Virginia, on July 1, 1924, Reverend 
Harris attended Virginia Union University in 
Richmond and then began work at Allied 
Chemical in Hopewell. During his time there, 
Reverend Harris served as a union shop stew-
ard and worked to promote diversity by advo-
cating for the employment of African Ameri-
cans in positions beyond janitors. When met 
with opposition, Reverend Harris sued Allied 
Chemical for violating regulations prohibiting 
discrimination. 
Ordained as a Baptist minister in 1959, Rev-
erend Harris continued his fight for social jus-
tice. In 1960, he was sentenced to sixty days 
in jail for staging a sit-in at a segregated drug-
store in Hopewell. Reverend Harris was ar-
rested over a dozen times for peaceful protest 
and civil disobedience. 
Reverend Harris joined the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference’s (SCLC) national 
board and would eventually become the lead-
er of the SCLC’s Virginia Chapter for over thir-
ty years. During his time with the SCLC, Rev-
erend Harris became one of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr.’s top lieutenants, marching with Dr. 
King from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. In 
1966, Reverend Harris organized a march to 
fight plans for a landfill in a predominantly 
Black neighborhood in Hopewell, ultimately 
coming face to face with the Ku Klux Klan at 
the steps of the Hopewell City Hall. 
In addition to his service with the SCLC, he 
served in leadership roles for the Hopewell 
Chapter of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People, or NAACP, at 
the Virginia Council on Human Relations, and 
with numerous organizations. 
Reverend Harris was highly respected within 
his community. He was active in local politics, 
serving as an elected member of the Hopewell 
City Council for over 25 years, and eventually 
as Hopewell’s first Black mayor. 
Throughout his time in public service, Rev-
erend Harris fought tirelessly for civil rights 
and educational and environmental justice. 
On December 10, 2017, Reverend Curtis 
Harris died at the age of 93. He was buried in 
Appomattox Cemetery, which he fought to in-
tegrate in 1960. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the life and accomplish-
ments of Reverend Curtis West Harris and in 
celebrating the renaming of the post office in 
Hopewell in his honor.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR JOE 
GROCHMAL 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to congratulate Joe 
Grochmal on entering his 68th year as a golf 
instructor in western Massachusetts. This 
milestone achievement deserves the highest 
praise for Joe’s hard work and steadfast love 
for the game, something he has instilled in the 
hearts of thousands of students. 
Sometimes referred to as the ‘‘Godfather of 
Western Massachusetts Golf,’’ Joe began 
working as a golf instructor in 1953. Although 
he frequently changed his teaching philos-
ophy, exploring new techniques to bring the 
most out of every golfer, Joe consistently 
shared with his students a genuine apprecia-
tion for the game of golf. During a career that 
spanned nearly seven decades, Joe dedicated 
countless hours to sharing his knowledge and 
expertise, meeting golfers young and old at 
local driving ranges after putting in a full day’s 
work. Joe truly represents the best of Massa-
chusetts’ First District, and that is why I am 
proud to join with his family, friends, and the 
entire western Massachusetts golf community 
in recognizing this milestone achievement. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to once again 
acknowledge Joe Grochmal. I am proud of his 
accomplishments and I wish him many more 
years of health and happiness, along with 
many more fairways and greens.

congressional district of Virginia where the 
Chesapeake 
Bay 
meets 
the 
James, 
Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers. This loca-
tion presents both challenges and opportuni-
ties. My district is home to the Port of Virginia, 
one of the largest and busiest ports on the 
eastern seaboard. With 95 percent of our na-
tion’s trade moving by water, it is essential 
that the port is able to maintain operations. 
Unfortunately, due to sea level rise, both at-
tributable to climate change as well as historic 
subsidence, these same waterways also pose 
a serious risk. State and local elected officials 
in Virginia already appreciate the significant 
threat sea level rise poses to Hampton Roads. 
Unfortunately, the cost to proactively and ag-
gressively address this problem head-on is far 
too great for any city to bear by itself. While 
Hampton Roads has already spent consider-
able sums of money to address the rising 
water and implement resilient infrastructure 
where feasible, the scope of the entire project 
to actually address the problem is expected to 
total in the billions of dollars. 
Hampton Roads is also home to significant 
traffic backups throughout the region, espe-
cially at waterway crossings. The widening of 
the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel is primarily 
being financed with local and state revenue 
from sales and gasoline taxes in the Hampton 
Roads Transportation Fund but it requires fed-
eral support. There are limits to how these 
major transportation projects can move for-
ward without federal assistance. For example, 
the Downtown and Midtown Tunnels, con-
necting the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, 
were in such a state of disrepair and need of 
expansion that the Commonwealth had few 
options other than to enter into a lopsided pri-
vate-public partnership leading to egregious 
tolls for decades to come. The Hampton 
Roads region is also in vital need of public 
transit investments. Our airports, roads, and 
bridges are in need of repair and I would urge 
the committee to commit crucial federal sup-
port for infrastructure in every state. 
This infrastructure bill includes much need-
ed investments in a cleaner and greener infra-
structure. This bill targets investments that will 
improve energy efficiency and resilience and 
grow local economies without passing the bur-
den onto local communities. 
I am pleased that this bill will also directly 
impact my district by dedicating nearly $24 
million in critically needed infrastructure funds, 
so that we can invest in the future of our com-
munities. With these funds the Birthplace of 
America Trail can expand in Newport News; 
the City of Chesapeake can begin a pilot pro-
gram for electric emergency response vehi-
cles; Hampton Roads Transit can move for-
ward with the Bus Rapid Transit project mak-
ing traveling around Hampton Roads without a 
car easier; Tidewater Drive, a major arterial 
road connecting to Naval Station Norfolk, can 
be repaired; and work on the Craney Island 
Access Road, which will help keep up with the 
increased import/export demands at the Port 
of Virginia, can advance. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill makes necessary in-
vestments that will create good-paying jobs 
and resilient infrastructure as we face the ris-
ing seas and changing climate.

RECOGNIZING COLONEL WILLIAM 
C. BENTLEY III 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize those men and women 
who have served this great Nation with 
honor—men such as Colonel William C. Bent-
ley III, United States Marine Corps. 
Colonel Bentley’s long and distinguished ca-
reer began after graduating from The Citadel 
and commissioning through the Platoon Lead-
ers Class. From there, a fruitful career as a 
USMC Helicopter Pilot blossomed. During this 
career, Colonel Bentley was stationed and de-
ployed across the globe—from Djibouti to Iraq 
to Europe, Colonel Bentley has seen it all. 
In his final command, Colonel Bentley led 
Marine Corps Installations National Capital 
Region-Marine Corps Base Quantico. In this 
role, I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing first-
hand his passion for the USMC mission. He 
has assisted me, my staff, and the citizens of 
Virginia in navigating complex issues with an 
attention to detail that every public servant 
should work to emulate. 
Colonel Bentley’s work ethic, duty to mis-
sion, and commitment to servant leadership 
are without equal. I believe that his personal 
drive to achieve excellence in his work has 
and will set a very high standard for his peers. 
I would also like to thank Colonel Bentley for 
the service and sacrifice he has made, both 
for our Nation and our Marine Corps. His im-
peccable integrity, boundless work ethic, and 
loyal devotion to duty earned him the respect 
and admiration of myself, my staff, and the 
First District of Virginia. In retirement, I have 
no doubt that Colonel Bentley will continue to 
serve the Nation honorably and with distinction 
in whatever path he chooses to pursue. 
I wish William and his family the best of luck 
as they continue their journey together. It was 
an honor and a pleasure having William serve 
at Marine Corps Base Quantico. We all can 
sleep soundly at night knowing that members 
of our all-volunteer force like William stand 
ready to defend our country and take the fight 
to our enemies, far away from their families 
and the comforts of the United States of 
America. 
I thank Colonel William C. Bentley III, as he 
has done a fantastic job. Best of luck to him 
and may God bless him and his family as he 
moves into this next chapter.

HONORING JAMIE MATHIAS 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the passing of one of our 
great local educators, Jamie Mathias, a Social 
Sciences teacher within Del Oro High School 
for 22 years. Jamie’s singular goal for stu-
dents was to encourage each one to better 
themselves; be that in the classroom or 
through athletics. Jamie always pushed stu-
dents to reach their next level and become the 
person he knew they could be. 
Jamie was a father figure, a coach, and a 
mentor to many students during his time as an 
educator. His academic impact on our commu-
nity will be felt for a very long time. The young 
minds he molded and inspired that are now 
spread across our county are the living legacy 
of what a great teacher will leave behind. 
Most importantly, Jamie was a family man, 
devoted to his family and raising his children 
to be exceptional members of our community. 
They carry with them the many life lessons 
that Jamie imparted over the years. My deep-
est condolences and prayers go out to the 
Mathias family, especially to his wife and chil-
dren. I thank Jamie, for his extraordinary im-
pact in our schools, and the countless stu-
dents he encouraged.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
REMOVING 
FEDERAL BARRIERS TO OFFER-
ING OF MOBILE WAGERS ON IN-
DIAN LANDS ACT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduced the Removing Federal Barriers to Of-
fering of Mobile Wagers on Indian Lands Act. 
Tribal government gaming is the primary 
source of revenue for hundreds of tribal na-
tions throughout this country who otherwise 
would not have the basic resources to provide 
for the health, safety and general welfare of 
their citizens and others who live on tribal 
lands. This economic development activity has 
been key to tribal economies since the United 
States Supreme Court first affirmed the inher-
ent sovereign right of tribal governments to 
conduct gaming on their lands in 1987. A year 
later, in 1988, Congress enacted restrictions 
on tribal government gaming through the fed-
eral Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This law 
affirmed the right of tribal governments to con-
duct gaming on their lands but tried to balance 
the equities between tribal and state govern-
ments when tribes are conducting Las Vegas 
style gaming. 
Not every tribal nation is able to conduct 
gaming, but for those who are located in via-
ble gaming markets, it has proven to be one 
of their more successful economic ventures. 
Many tribal nations have become economic 
engines in their regions, employing thousands 
of people and investing tens of millions of dol-
lars into the regional economies on an annual 
basis. 
However, the gaming industry is quickly 
evolving and more and more states are legal-
izing some form of gaming activity that pri-
marily utilizes the internet. Sophisticated, well- 
financed digital companies that did not exist 
even ten years ago are changing the gaming 
industry before our eyes. Online sports betting 
seems to be the popular choice this year for 
many state legislatures. 
As tribal governments begin to prepare to 
move their gaming activities into the online 
world, there have been some questions about 
whether such gaming activities would continue 
to be primarily governed by the federal Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act. The federal law gov-
erning tribal gaming was enacted in 1988, 
prior to the internet being readily available, 
and the law does not expressly address the 
internet. As you can imagine, setting up these 
new gaming systems involves significant finan-
cial investments. Tribal governments should 
not be required to make these investments 
without having clarity and comfort of what laws 
will apply to them. For that reason, I am intro-
ducing this bill to clarify the federal Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act and make clear what 
the congressional drafters would have done in 
1988 had the internet been around at time. 
This bill would clarify that for purposes of tribal 
government gaming, the location of the wager 
occurs at the location of the server, unless a 
state and Indian tribe otherwise agree. Making 
this clarification will keep intact the current 
system of tribal gaming and eliminate any friv-
olous litigation. Tribal government gaming has 
been around for more than 30 years and this 
bill merely clarifies how that system of gaming 
should evolve into the internet. 
This bill does not authorize any type of 
internet gaming; that is within the authority of 
each state to do. All this bill does is clarifies 
the location of where the wager takes place 
for purposes of tribal government gaming. It 
clarifies that internet gaming will be conducted 
by tribal governments under the same frame-
work that they currently conduct gaming in 
their physical casinos. 
As someone who has long lived in a state 
with more than 110 federally recognized tribal 
nations, I have seen firsthand how tribal gov-
ernment gaming has benefitted the tribal na-
tions, their citizens, the surrounding commu-
nities and the state government. This bill is 
merely intended to provide some clarity and 
comfort as tribal gaming moves into the next 
frontier of the internet. As the United States 
Supreme Court confirmed in 1987, tribal gov-
ernments retained the inherent sovereign right 
to conduct gaming on their lands. Congress 
needs to provide the clarification in my bill to 
ensure that tribal gaming is not relegated to 
the same fate as Blockbuster, but can move 
forward and thrive like Netflix in the era of the 
internet.

CHILD TAX CREDIT 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, there is a 
special place in every parent’s heart for sum-
mer with our children. 
My son, Jordan, used to put on his little 
cleats and a big hat, and run out onto the field 
to play TeeBall with his friends on Saturday 
mornings. 
After that, we’d go to the pool to cool off, 
eat lunch under a shady tree, play in the back-
yard as day turned to dusk, and read a story 
together as he drifted off to sleep. 
Truly, summer is for hard-working parents to 
spend time with the little ones they love most. 
It is for our children to grow and live and play. 
And that’s why I’m so proud we just passed 
the Child Tax Credit into law. It means more 
money in the pockets of middle class families. 
Now, over 680,000 families here in Georgia 
will receive a tax cut, and these credits will lift 
over 160,000 children out of poverty. 
This is more funding for Georgia families to 
protect our children and lift up our community.

SPEECH OF 
HON. JAHANA HAYES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, l rise today 
to voice my opposition to Amendment No. 97/ 
No. 188 of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in America 
Act. 
This amendment was included as part of an 
en bloc which l supported, however, I do not 
support this amendment. During my time in 
Congress I have been an ardent supporter of 
high-speed rail, building rail capacity and im-
proving existing infrastructure in Connecticut, 
the Northeast, and across the country. Unfor-
tunately, I do not believe this amendment and 
the specific compact it seeks to create are the 
best path forward for rail in my state, the re-
gion or the country. The INVEST in America 
Act presents us with an opportunity to make a 
once in a generation investment in our trans-
portation systems and infrastructure, and in 
rail in particular. I am concerned that pro-
posals like this take away from our ability to 
implement comprehensive, fully vetted plans, 
that are free of redundancies. 
As we look towards the future of rail in the 
United States, we must be sure that we part-
ner with state and local transit authorities, and 
stakeholders. We must also be sure to con-
sider and mitigate the climate and environ-
mental risks that stem from these projects. 
Congress must advance a bold vision for 
our Nation’s infrastructure, and I look forward 
to the INVEST in America Act passing the 
House. I hope the Senate will quickly begin 
working on this vital issue.

RECOGNIZING BRUCE WARNER’S 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize a distinguished citizen of my 
state of Oregon. Bruce Warner has spent his 
life in public service in a significant variety of 
roles. 
Today, Bruce steps down after ten years as 
Board President of the TriMet Board of Direc-
tors, which is my region’s major transit district. 
During that time, he oversaw successful labor 
negotiations, a commitment to transition to 
zero-emission buses, the construction of a 
new light rail line, and the hiring of executives, 
managers, and employees that reflect the 
greatest number of people of color in a public 
agency in Oregon. 
His devotion to serving his community is 
truly exceptional. 
He was born in Fork, Washington and 
raised in Port Angeles. He graduated from the 
University of Washington in civil engineering, 
and while he is a Husky fanatic, we have 
never held that against him. He is an Orego-
nian not by birth but by heart. 
He began his career as a young civil engi-
neer designing parks and culverts before

quickly moving to Portland where he worked 
for the Army Corp of Engineers. Living far 
from work in distant South East Portland, 
Bruce rode a bus to work. He says that expe-
rience began shaping his thinking on transpor-
tation, equity, land use, and social responsi-
bility. How transportation is provided as a 
service became part of his life-long critical ex-
amination. 
He started as a City Engineer for Hillsboro 
Oregon and then was elevated to the director 
of Washington County’s Land Use and Trans-
portation. Again, ideas of equity, fairness, land 
use, and transportation continued to churn in 
his mind. 
It came as a shock to many when, as the 
new director of the Oregon Department of 
Transportation Region One, he moved head-
quarters from a suburb to a regional center in 
downtown Portland. And, he limited employee 
parking and encouraged the use of transit in-
stead. Transit over traffic. Pretty revolutionary 
for a leader who oversees freeways and high-
ways to make a land use decision based on 
transit opportunities and equity for employees 
and the public. 
He took a brief sojourn from ODOT to lead 
the solid waste efforts at our regional govern-
ment and because of his tremendous talents, 
quickly became Metro’s Chief Operating Offi-
cer. 
He was then tapped by the governor and 
state legislature to lead the Oregon Depart-
ment of Transportation. His service was re-
membered as a healing time for the agency 
with the legislature and closing the urban/rural 
divide. 
He planned on retiring from ODOT, but was 
recruited to become the director of the Port-
land Development Commission where he sup-
ported small business development programs 
for communities of color; light rail construction 
in downtown; and one of his proudest achieve-
ments, the creation of affordable housing. 
He tried to retire once again, but duty 
called. He was asked to be the temporary 
Hillsboro City Manager. 
Oregon’s governor most recently tapped 
Bruce to chair the TriMet Board of Directors. 
Under Bruce’s leadership, TriMet built the Or-
ange Line with the stunning Tilikum Crossing 
and using a historic number of minority cer-
tified contractors. Also, under construction cur-
rently is the Division Transit Project employing 
the largest minority contract award in Oregon’s 
history. 
During his free time, Bruce serves on 
boards of the Volunteers of America and Help-
ing Hands, helping people in recovery. 
A calming influence, famous for bringing 
people together, and settling problems, this 
leader is still trying to retire. It won’t surprise 
me if he is tapped again. But until that time, 
I thank Bruce Warner.

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SUR-
FACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my support for the INVEST Act which fi-
nally, at long last, includes robust funding for 
roads, bridges, rail, and new incentives to ad-
dress climate change equity and most impor-
tantly job creation. However, I want to clearly 
state my deep concerns for an amendment 
adopted by the House, which creates a so- 
called North Atlantic Rail Interstate Compact 
to control the development of high-speed rail. 
I share the intent of the authors of the 
amendment 
to 
support 
high-speed 
rail 
throughout the Northeast. Connecticut and the 
Northeast region are home to some of the 
most densely-populated areas of the country, 
which are served well by mass transit, and 
high-speed rail would have significant positive 
impacts for our region and our nation as a 
whole. That is why I am proud to support the 
underlying bill, which triples funding to Amtrak 
and provides a 500 percent increase in the 
funding dedicated to improving high speed 
and passenger rail. The resources provided in 
the INVEST Act signal an unprecedented op-
portunity for the New England region, at the 
state and federal levels, to work together with 
common purpose to build on the work already 
being done to expand rail service in the north-
east. 
I remain concerned, however, about an 
amendment added to En Bloc No. 1 to estab-
lish a North Atlantic Rail compact. While I ap-
preciate the goals of this proposal, I believe 
that it is duplicative of existing interstate re-
gional rail efforts and short-circuits established 
cooperative long term rail planning in the re-
gion. The North Atlantic Rail compact has as 
a goal a multi-phase rail development vision 
for the northeast that includes initial ‘‘early ac-
tion’’ projects, many of which are already 
under development, and longer term goals of 
a cross-Long Island Sound tunnel and a new 
right of away across the rural communities of 
eastern Connecticut. Notably, many of these 
longer term goals reflect previously considered 
plans for rail expansion in the northeast and 
contradicts already-completed environmental 
assessments for existing high-speed rail plans 
and could cause significant negative environ-
mental impacts in our region. 
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) 
has already done extensive study on many of 
the concepts listed in the North Atlantic Rail 
plan which have been ruled out as part of the 
Northeast Corridor (NEC) FUTURE com-
prehensive plan for the route from Wash-
ington, D.C. to Boston, Massachusetts. The 
existing NEC FUTURE plan has taken years 
of work with stakeholders with thousands of 
public comments and has met crucial environ-
mental milestones to move forward. As noted 
by Amtrak in a June 28, 2021 letter to the 
House Transportation & Infrastructure Com-
mittee opposing the underlying compact pro-
posal in the amendment, ‘‘Amtrak, state 
DOTs, the NEC Commission and FRA already 
have the institutional capabilities, the collabo-
rative framework and the requisite rights to ad-
vance high-speed and other intercity pas-
senger rail service in New England.’’ 
This compact as proposed in the amend-
ment is also duplicative of existing regional rail 
cooperation between the Northeast Corridor 
states. The Northeast Corridor Commission 
and the NEC Future plan has been developed 
in partnership with state departments of trans-
portation, metropolitan planning organizations, 
and local communities. In contrast, the NAR 
has been included as part of this bill without 
the support of major stakeholders such as the 
Connecticut Department of Transportation and 
without clear plans for oversight, transparency 
and public engagement that are inherent in 
existing regional planning efforts and state and 
federal agencies. 
This is a critical flaw, as many of the goals 
at the core of this compact would occur in and 
disproportionately impact Connecticut in the 
near and long term. As an alternative, the un-
derlying bill authorizes expansion of interstate 
rail compacts that would be competitively ap-
proved and funded to develop plans to expand 
high speed rail through interstate cooperation 
and coordination. That is the approach that 
should be taken on this effort, rather than a 
duplicative organization without the full buy in 
of critical stakeholders. 
I appreciate that there have been significant 
changes that Chairman DEFAZIO of the House 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
and his professional staff made to the original 
NAR proposal, including making the North At-
lantic Rail into an interstate compact instead 
of a federally-chartered special purpose entity, 
and most critically, requiring ratification from 
each state in order to go into effect in that 
state. The original proposal would have cre-
ated an unaccountable federally-chartered en-
tity with control of funds and eminent domain, 
which the Committee wisely eliminated from 
the plan. Unfortunately, these improvements 
still fail to justify the need for an additional 
interstate compact on top of existing state and 
regional entities and requires extensive eval-
uation and review as this bill moves forward. 
As the House and Senate come together to 
finalize the surface transportation reauthoriza-
tion bill, I will continue to raise these concerns 
with lead Congressional negotiators. Addition-
ally, I hope that my colleagues consider 
weighing these impacts against the existing 
mechanisms which are already in place to cre-
ate high-speed rail in the Northeast, including 
NEC FUTURE, and the underling authority the 
bill provides to expand cooperative interstate 
rail compacts. Just last week on June 24, all 
18 voting members on the Northeast Corridor 
Commission unanimously approved the CON-
NECT NEC 2035 plan, a 15-year action plan 
to rebuild the Northeast Corridor, and which 
could provide $70 billion in state-of-good re-
pair funds over the next 15 years. The existing 
framework of the NEC FUTURE already has 
the organization, funding, environmental safe-
guards, stakeholder support, and local buy-in 
to make high-speed rail a reality for our region 
more quickly and more effectively than the 
NAR proposal could do. 
In closing, despite these concerns, which I 
believe can and will be addressed in the proc-
ess and based on the overall historic oppor-
tunity that the INVEST Act provides, I will vote 
in the affirmative to keep this process moving 
forward.

July 1, 2021 
an ostensible charge to construct an ill-de-
fined ‘‘North Atlantic Rail Network.’’ Am-
trak is strongly opposed to the adoption of 
this amendment and the likely negative con-
sequences of such a decision for the North-
east Corridor and the national rail network. 
Adopting the amendment would establish— 
without any hearings, committee consider-
ation, studies or opportunity for those im-
pacted by the proposal to be heard—support 
for an infeasible proposal, previously re-
jected because of the harm it would do to the 
environment, by an advocacy group called 
North Atlantic Rail (NAR) to build a new, up 
to 225 mph dedicated high-speed rail line be-
tween New York City and Boston. 
The dedicated high-speed rail line’s route 
(NAR Alignment) would not follow the exist-
ing Northeast Corridor (NEC) alignment that 
parallels Interstate 95. Instead, it would 
travel beneath the East River in a new tun-
nel; cross dense urban sections of Queens and 
Long Island to Ronkonkoma; turn north to 
Port Jefferson; traverse the Long Island 
Sound in a 16-mile tunnel to Stratford, Con-
necticut; and after passing through New 
Haven and Hartford, turn east across Eastern 
Connecticut and Rhode Island to Providence, 
from which it would follow the existing NEC 
rail corridor to Boston. Most of the line 
would be built on elevated viaducts. Exten-
sive portions of the high-speed line would 
need to be constructed along newly acquired 
and cleared rights-of-way on which there are 
no rail lines or existing transportation cor-
ridors today. 
Building a high-speed rail line along the 
NAR Alignment was evaluated in the com-
prehensive, five-year NEC FUTURE planning 
and environmental review process—and re-
jected in the Record of Decision (ROD) issued 
by the Federal Railroad Administration 
(FRA) in 2017 because of the harm it would 
cause to the environment, its costs and fail-
ure to provide needed investment to the ex-
isting NEC. Instead, FRA, eight NEC states, 
the District of Columbia and Amtrak en-
dorsed a Preferred Alternative that would in-
crease track capacity and speeds along the 
existing NEC alignment, and build dedicated 
high-speed tracks parallel to it where war-
ranted, to minimize environmental impacts 
and benefit all Amtrak and commuter pas-
sengers on the NEC rather than just those 
traveling on high-speed trains. 
The prior rejection of the NAR Alignment 
is not the only crucial fact undisclosed in 
the cursory description of the NAR Proposal 
on NAR’s website and in its handouts. 
Federal safety regulations governing Tier 
III (above 186 mph) high-speed rail equip-
ment would preclude the operation of con-
ventional speed (125 mph or less) intercity 
and commuter trains over any portion of the 
NAR Alignment. This means that passengers 
traveling from currently served NEC cities 
such as Stamford or Bridgeport to Boston 
would have to change trains to travel on 
high-speed trains over the NAR Alignment, 
as would passengers from New London, 
Springfield, and Northern New England. It 
also means that New York City-to-Boston 
trains would not be able to operate above 160 
mph—which will soon be the maximum speed 
between New York City and Boston—over 
the NAR Alignment until the entire line was 
completed, which NAR acknowledges would 
be decades away. 
While NAR’s advocates claim that the 
NAR HSR Line would cost $84.6 billion, and 
‘‘Early Action Projects’’ (investments in 
other New England rail corridors) an addi-
tional $23.4 billion, they have not provided 
any engineering or cost study to substan-
tiate those figures. 
Building a new 240-mile high-speed rail 
line, much of it through heavily populated 
areas where there is no existing rail line or 
right-of-way, would require purchasing or 
condemning innumerable homes and busi-
nesses, and routing the line through parks 
and wetlands. Maps prepared for the NEC Fu-
ture study indicate that the least intrusive 
route along the NAR Alignment would: 
Bisect Forest Park in Queens on a viaduct, 
and travel in a trench through Eisenhower 
County Park in Nassau; 
Be built on trenches or viaducts through 
residential neighborhoods and business dis-
tricts alongside the Long Island Rail Road’s 
heavily 
traveled 
Main, 
Hempstead 
and 
Ronkonkoma Lines (on which service would 
have to be curtailed during construction); 
and 
Follow new alignments, primarily on via-
ducts, between Ronkonkoma and Port Jeffer-
son, and through numerous communities, 
parks and wetlands between Hartford and 
Providence. 
While the ‘‘Early Action Projects’’ listed 
on 
NAR’s 
website 
are 
all 
worthwhile 
projects, they are not new ideas and have no 
connection to NAR’s high-speed line pro-
posal. In fact, most of them would not con-
nect with a high-speed line built along the 
NAR Alignment. The massive levels of fund-
ing it would consume would make it less 
likely that these projects would be funded. 
Likewise, a federal funding commitment to 
the NAR Alignment—which would cost more 
than the Biden Administration’s proposed in-
vestment in all passenger rail projects 
throughout the country—would leave little 
federal funding available for projects in 
other regions. 
The amendment would give NARC, the 
Compact it creates, responsibility for plan-
ning and constructing the New York City-to- 
Boston high-speed rail line. NARC would be 
tasked with planning other New England 
passenger rail improvement projects, a re-
sponsibility currently held by FRA, the 
states, the NEC Commission and Amtrak. 
NARC would gain these important and com-
plex responsibilities once only two of the 
seven New England states ratified the com-
pact creating it, even though it would have 
no resources or employees at that time. It 
would be governed by an unwieldy 17-mem-
ber Board on which the federal government 
and each NEC state would have the same 
number of votes (two) on issues relating to 
the construction of a federally-funded high- 
speed rail line from New York City to Boston 
as Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. 
Oddly, the amendment would not give NARC 
the legal authority possessed by Amtrak and 
states to condemn properties necessary for 
the construction of the NAR Alignment, or 
the remedies Amtrak has if freight railroads 
that own rail lines on which Early Action 
Projects would be constructed decline to 
allow those projects. 
Amtrak recognizes that the advocates for 
the NAR proposal are well-intentioned. We 
share their vision of faster service between 
New York City and Boston, where Amtrak 
carries more travelers than all airlines com-
bined despite inadequate infrastructure and 
investment that makes the trip on Acela 45 
minutes longer than traveling the same dis-
tance from New York City to Washington. 
The best way to accomplish that is to ad-
vance 
the 
series 
of 
investments 
con-
templated 
by 
NEC 
Future, 
which 
will 
produce 
near-term 
benefits—shorter 
trip 
times and more trains—for all NEC rail users 
as each project is completed. 
Fifty years after the creation of Amtrak, 
the stars are finally aligning in ways that 
would provide New England with the im-
proved and expanded high-speed, intercity 
and commuter service it needs and deserves. 
For the first time in Amtrak’s history, we 
have an Administration, a Congress and mul-
tiple New England state partners who sup-
port making the types of investments other 
countries have made to develop world class 
passenger rail services. Because of climate 
change, an unprecedented pandemic, a grow-
ing population, and increasing congestion in 
other modes, the need for investments in 
passenger rail service to provide mobility, 
reduce emissions and spur an economic re-
covery has never been greater. Amtrak and 
our state partners stand ready to seize that 
opportunity. 
Two months ago, I testified before your 
committee to urge support for investments 
to reduce trip times between New York City 
and Boston to less than two hours and thirty 
minutes. Amtrak and our New England state 
partners along the NEC are about to begin 
one of the most important steps in that proc-
ess: a study to evaluate alternative align-
ments—including their environmental and 
community impacts—for increased capacity 
and higher speeds between New Haven and 
Providence to identify a Preferred Alter-
native, as contemplated by the NEC FU-
TURE ROD. The NEC Commission is about 
to release its CONNECT NEC 2035 report, a 
15-year roadmap for implementing NEC FU-
TURE’s vision for expanded and faster pas-
senger rail service. In April, we released our 
‘‘Amtrak Connects US’’ vision that would 
provide or expand Amtrak service, also over 
a 15-year time period, on the same intercity 
corridors off the NEC Main Line that are in-
cluded in the NAR’s list of ‘‘Early Action 
Projects.’’ 
Amtrak, state DOTs, the NEC Commission 
and FRA already have the institutional ca-
pabilities, the collaborative framework and 
the requisite rights to advance high-speed 
and other intercity passenger rail service in 
New England. Right now would be the worst 
possible time to throw a monkey wrench 
into the progress they are making by cre-
ating a new bureaucracy with poorly defined 
and overlapping aims and yet no institu-
tional capability. Continuing to move for-
ward with the NEC FUTURE investment pro-
gram, which has already received Tier I envi-
ronmental clearance, and advancing the 
‘‘Amtrak Connects US’’ vision and state rail 
plans, offer the best, fastest, most cost-effec-
tive and most environmentally responsible 
path to achieving the improved and expanded 
high-speed, intercity passenger and com-
muter rail service that residents of New Eng-
land expect and deserve. 
Sincerely, 
WILLIAM J. FLYNN, 
Chief Executive Officer, Amtrak.
